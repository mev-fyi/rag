00:00:00.200 - 00:00:37.236, Speaker A: Good morning, everyone. So in the next 2020 minutes, we want to discuss one of the questions that after regulation pops up everywhere is like, is Mecar or MeCa the upcoming EU blockchain regulatory framework? Is that the Holy Grail? And in the last couple of years, you sort of seen three approaches to blockchain or crypto. The first one is the american one. The american one is like, we do not agree what it is. We will sue companies being active, and that's still ongoing. So that's the american approach. You even have two agencies battling who's in charge.
00:00:37.236 - 00:01:11.664, Speaker A: I think after FTX and all that we've seen, that's probably not the best approach. But a much older and long term approach has been here in Switzerland. It's been very pragmatic by actually having discussions between the government, the regulatory bodies and the industry. Just recently you saw that about the staking guidelines. For a while, famous said, if you do staking, in the case of bankruptcy, you basically need to be a bank. If you do staking, it's a security. There was a discussion and it was updated and I think at the moment it's more workable.
00:01:11.664 - 00:01:38.106, Speaker A: So it's a very pragmatic approach here for the last ten. The crypto value is ten years old. And now you have european approach and the european approach. As you guys know, there's this old saying, the US innovates and the EU regulates and the EU really likes regulations. I must say I'm a bit surprised. Mecar only has 166 pages, if you want to read it. Why? I'm saying that the EU AI act has thousand pages.
00:01:38.106 - 00:02:07.302, Speaker A: So I don't know if that says anything about crypto versus AI, but the question is here is, and that's a discussion we had many times, is this the Holy Grail? Will it now attract all the companies Coinbase circle? They're in Germany, in France. Will Switzerland be left out? Is that the better approach, the approach? Or are the Swiss still having a leg up? How do you see that? What's your experience with EU and rail regulation? And I know you have some first hand experiences. Tell us.
00:02:07.318 - 00:02:51.374, Speaker B: Yes, thank you. I think that in general framework, it's very important at the end of the day to have some sort of regulation. I think that exactly what you said before. The challenge is that us is having and also listening to what is happening in business models that are still being developed in the US. And the lack of clarity of what happened all the time with a centralized exchanges, et cetera, has made the country to lose a very interesting opportunity. In this space and Switzerland, even it's a small size. As I told you multiple times, I am always mesmerized to see the extent of the ecosystem here in Switzerland compared with the same experience when you go abroad.
00:02:51.374 - 00:03:49.104, Speaker B: There are very few places that have this level of activity. And I say this, that to me, some sort of regulations is important. The point is, excessive regulation as well is something that is detrimental for the growth of a BB ecosystem. You have an ecosystem, you have platforms interacting with each other, you have users wanting to use the system, et cetera, when there is no friction between all these processes taking place. And I think that Mika is trying to do too many things at the same time, but in too many different jurisdictions. And one thing that I like of the ecosystem here is how approachable different people of different stakeholders at all levels. You were talking about the statement about Finland related to staking, how closely knit together all the people is in this space.
00:03:49.104 - 00:05:14.550, Speaker B: With respect to Europe, I think that a very simple example of what was happening in the past years was the following. We are very interested here in our university, like in most of universities of the world, we are very interested in identification of our students, because, for example, you know that there is a lot of administrative burden when we need to certify students that are incoming. The previous studies that they have had, specifically, if they are from other countries, even as simple as if it is a student coming from a european country as well. There is a lot of paperwork involved because the processes didn't evolve for the last eight years. And we at the University of Zurich were running some pilots, actually with people, with industry stakeholders here, with Swisscom, and trying to have a certification system for our own university. And the important thing here is this is certifying identities of students is a standard process that the university needs to have. But because it is a standard process, what you need to do is to do it at the level of the administrative people that is involved in charge of doing this.
00:05:14.550 - 00:05:52.704, Speaker B: And we run this pilot. We had in our faculty issued a lot of certificates in blockchain for one year. We're trying to think to expand it and expand it to a national level. And this is something that is very simple here, because there are only 20 universities. When I. When we were discussing the results of the pilot, I came to discuss the same issue with stakeholders of other european universities from EU. And what they told me was, look, what happened with digital certification is that we started having pilots in 2017, 2018.
00:05:52.704 - 00:06:56.054, Speaker B: We ran it locally inside of our own labs. We saw that it was feasible, but at the point in which we reached administration all the time was, it is not possible because we do not have the right to do that. We need first a regulation on how these identities are going to work out. And when they came out after a few years, the inherent complexity of what were the processes and how it would be implemented ended up creating a situation in which after five years, all the universities are completely stalled at the european level. In this part of identification. You see that even now we are discussing with a network of which the University of Zurich belongs to, of european universities, all the process of digital certification regressed, if I have to say, for the past five years, and nobody knows how to do a process of this simple, and that is in the benefit of everybody else, as it is this one.
00:06:57.394 - 00:07:04.202, Speaker A: So it's the technologies here, but the processes are bogged down by bureaucracy. That doesn't sound too surprising if the.
00:07:04.298 - 00:07:07.218, Speaker B: Good way of summarizing it, one of.
00:07:07.226 - 00:07:55.010, Speaker A: The interesting things when you talk about regulation, it's everyone says, we want to have regulation, or the right of the smart regulation, but what it basically is, when you talk about regulation, it's always a trade off. Regulation is like you provide rules, but you also provide enough freedom to innovate, because innovation at the end of the day is freedom to experiment. Now, if you stop that very early on, it does doesn't happen. So one of the questions I'm also, be sure, active with other universities. One of the things I hear a lot is now the EU has this regulation, you can debate it. Apparently there are whole, certain things are not covered, but what about the knowledge and the expertise? Is that available? I heard one story, like, for example, for Germany, that Bafin, the regulator in Germany, has little expertise. So it's really challenging.
00:07:55.010 - 00:08:13.266, Speaker A: And I went to a presentation recently by FInmA here, they said the same thing. They said it's very hard to understand the technology, it's for them as a regulator. They're not developers, they're no coders. So I think Switzerland at least has ten years track record. Do you see it as enough education, expertise in Europe, or will that be a hindering point?
00:08:13.290 - 00:09:38.782, Speaker B: No, I think that you have to see that the scale of the things are completely different, because we are talking about a jurisdiction that has ten times, sorry, 20 times the population of Switzerland. So here, one thing I have some team members have participated in discussion routes with Finma related to this staking thing. And actually the questions that Finma was asking were very pertinent because they have been exposed to the space for a lot of time. And we humbly at the University of Zurich, but also high salut ETH, et cetera, have been producing knowledge to practitioners as well, having in discussions with practitioners for the past seven years, because we are very active. I think that we are now writing a very interesting initiative together with a network of universities here in Switzerland. I am really happy to see the level of activities that in a lot of faculties and from completely different disciplines, how seriously this topic is being taken by ourselves, by academia as well, not trying to do knowledge transfer into industry. And this is something that I am a little bit biased here, but if I have to see how the same groups react or behave in other places of the world, in other jurisdictions, they are much more marginal to the discussion also with the stakeholders.
00:09:38.782 - 00:09:55.194, Speaker B: And this is what you are asking now, I think that here there is a nurturing of the ecosystem, but also of government and regulators, in which they are really trying to acquire the knowledge that is important in order to foster the acceleration of the ecosystem.
00:09:55.824 - 00:10:45.450, Speaker A: And that's interesting, because recently Finma, if you want to read that, they published an annual report, and they talk about crypto, among other things. And they say whenever they have fintech applications, it takes them, on average, two months to respond, on average. Maybe some of you have had different experiences, but it's quite responsive, and I heard different numbers. If you want to try this in Germany or in France, you can multiply those months by three, four, five times. So it's quite a fast, and a lot of that has to do that. They have been exposed to too many things. But one thing that FEMA came up, and one of the things they said explicitly, and coming back to your education question is that at the end of the day, as a regulator, when you get a white paper, buy some pro project for some coins, whatever it is, you basically, at the end of the day, as a regulator, have to sort of understand the code, and that makes it much harder.
00:10:45.450 - 00:11:03.424, Speaker A: They're not used to looking at code. Regulators are used to interact with entities. With the bank. How do you see that? Have you had experience? You've been exposed to FEMA. How would you rate their, you know, understanding of code and algorithms? Is that is exist? Is it lacking? Do you need more education?
00:11:03.584 - 00:11:44.018, Speaker B: Well, obviously it is. I think that the, let me say the following thing. Pinema has been very open all the time to try to better understand the algorithms that are behind the system. I was involved in a very early stage of the swiss ecosystem in a project, and actually they were looking at the logic of the algorithms that we were trying to implement for a marketplace in a very detailed manner. And I think that this is experience that they in general have. And I think that they gathered. If they also have very low response times nowadays, it's because they understand far, far better what they are trying to, what they are looking after.
00:11:44.018 - 00:12:29.114, Speaker B: Okay. And this is a very interesting thing. And also in the discussions of the, that I had with the people that went to discuss with them, I think that, as I say, the questions were far more relevant than the ones you would usually think of. Regulators. Someone may criticize the speed at which the clarification related to different incarnations of a staking, for example, is being done, but that's a completely marginal thing. I think that the steps are going to the right direction also, bringing clarity to the space constantly, and they are acquiring their knowledge. And I would say that it's not only Finma, if you talk to people from SNB as well, they know very well what all these systems are about and which are the potentials that they also bring to them.
00:12:29.934 - 00:13:16.150, Speaker A: One of the, I think, standout features of the swiss regulation, the Swiss actually legal framework, is it's often very pragmatic, it's business friendly and spaced on dialogue involved with one company, and that is getting a license and you can have an exchange with them. You get a response, you get feedback. In your experience, have you seen that in Europe as well, or other different mindsets to rail regulation? One friend recently said here you still looked at as sort of an equal as a business partner. If you try the same thing in Germany, you first looked upon that you're doing something very suspicious or even criminals. So the mindset is very different. Have you experienced that in Europe as well? What kind of mindsets do you exist?
00:13:16.222 - 00:14:25.374, Speaker B: Yeah, but also, in a way, I may be saying something, perhaps I'm generalizing too much. One other thing that this also led to the ecosystem is basically trying to do what the EU or the countries want, because you have two options there at the european level. Either you try to do your own business model and then you face a lot of challenges because people do not understand, people have a lot of prejudices about this business area, and then the option is you go into a minefield. The other option is you just try to do a business at the country level or at the european level completely aligned with the government or with other stakeholders. And this is exactly one thing that is completely degrading the level of innovation that you have in this stage, because you're not using your slogan, you do not have the opportunity to do what you really want to do or leverage on the opportunities that these new platforms allow you to develop.
00:14:25.754 - 00:14:40.186, Speaker A: So, as we saw, we're approaching the end of our session. What's your outlook? Is Mika going to be a boom for the entire industry? Will Europe become the leading light when it comes to blockchain? How do you see that and in those, in comparison to Switzerland?
00:14:40.290 - 00:15:38.330, Speaker B: I also want to hear your opinion about this. But before that, to me, I think that the problem here is that Mika forces people to get into this regulatory framework in very short timeframes at which you do not have the knowledge, capacity to absorb and to make rational decisions in the timeframes that have been imposed. And so what I fear is that as it is currently implemented, it's going to actually create a buffer zone in which people try to become compliant. There's going to be not a very elegant situation with respect to how these things are resolved. And we will have a time period in which innovation is most likely going to decrease because people will just try to accommodate to the regulations and the decision makers will not be there to do the right decisions. And I think that this is a very challenging thing. I think that Switzerland has a very interesting lead on this.
00:15:38.330 - 00:15:39.654, Speaker B: But what's your opinion?
00:15:40.594 - 00:16:25.382, Speaker A: I think, to summarize what I've, I was member of parliament for seven years, so I've seen the government side and also mentioned before, when it comes to innovation, innovation is creativity and it means freedom, and you need certain guardrails. So you, you have to strike a balance between let people try things and fail and sort of prevent bad outcomes. And if you are too freewheeling, I think we saw that in the US with FTX, it can be really bad for the outcome. So that's probably not the best approach. I feel like the U is, as always, very administration bureaucracy focused. And to my understanding, I don't know if you agree, but innovation doesn't happen because government is very much involved. And I've seen that the government, even if it gives money, certain governments are throwing out money.
00:16:25.382 - 00:17:00.024, Speaker A: They always want to interfere, and that's not the best. Governments are not innovators. And I think Switzerland still has this balance between a framework. We have crypto banks, we have crypto brokers, we have exchanges, we have everything custody. There's a lot of clarity on that side, but you can still innovate and there's still some empty space. I still believe that Switzerland will, when it comes stability and predictability, which are important for businesses, Switzerland is a good place to be. The only caveat that there is, as we have in financial banking, is market access.
00:17:00.024 - 00:17:35.174, Speaker A: How do you access from Switzerland? European market. And I know there's a lot of talk about doing this through Liechtenstein and there might be ways of doing it. So we'll see. I think that will be, for me, the big question mark. Can, will Switzerland be shut out from the european market? Will it be so strictly enforced or will we have access? And the ecosystem here is still very strong and I know that predictability is attractive. There's a few companies who are still looking at Switzerland and a lot and to finish because. And also I'm happy to be here at the university because of the developing talent and the research being done.
00:17:35.174 - 00:17:40.742, Speaker A: This is really appreciated on a global scale because it's about knowledge and expertise. So we'll see.
00:17:40.918 - 00:17:42.670, Speaker B: Fantastic. Thank you very much, Alex. It's a pleasure.
00:17:42.742 - 00:17:43.094, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:17:43.134 - 00:17:43.830, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:17:43.982 - 00:18:19.574, Speaker C: Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen. We still have a few minutes for questions, if there are any questions. Yes, we are a little bit ahead of time, which is obviously a good thing. Are there any questions? Sorry for that. We are a bit short on microphones.
00:18:20.554 - 00:18:39.764, Speaker D: Thank you very much. Thanks for a great conversation. The question is around a comparison of regulation across different jurisdictions. If you can compare EU, UK, Switzerland, the Menas, UAE, US, Singapore, where would you start a company today if you're starting a startup?
00:18:43.824 - 00:19:04.880, Speaker A: No, I can answer in two jurisdictions. Singapore I know very well since Lunatera Crypto's dead. I think that's a very short and brutal summary and that's just the case. And it's a good showcase. What happens if there's a big fall out? The government didn't like that. They were in the press. Singapore government doesn't like that and they're all owned citizens were impacted.
00:19:04.880 - 00:19:28.310, Speaker A: And the interesting bit, I think we have a lot of discussion is about do Dubai, obviously, recently the first time. But the interesting thing about Dubai, yes, you can get easily licensed. It's interesting, it's good to start up. It's a really thriving ecosystem. But they have the same problem as we just discussed, whatever. They have like 20 plus free trade zones. Some license are just for one free trade zone, some are in the region.
00:19:28.310 - 00:20:12.730, Speaker A: So it's a very small market. So obviously it has attract a lot, but the audience or the client base is still very small. So I think Dubai is still faced by the same problem we have. Where are the big consumers? And there's obviously Asia, so I think obviously it attracts a lot of attention. And on the US, as I said before, I see a lot of companies trying to leave the US because it's just very, very unfriendly, just a lack of clarity. And again, it's a good showcase that for a business that's actually the worst. If you have bad rules, okay, but if you have no rules, and I mean, just look at Sec now got permission to go after Coinbase because of the staking.
00:20:12.730 - 00:20:19.414, Speaker A: I mean, this is terrible. It's insane what's happening. So that's my take on those three regions. I don't know if you want to add on.
00:20:19.934 - 00:20:48.444, Speaker B: No, I go pretty much in line with what you are saying. I think that also Liechtenstein is a very interesting breach, but it is also exactly. Now, the fact that Mika was implemented as well at the European Union level also changed as well the original way in which all the digital assets were treated as well. And listens. I think that the sort of independence that Switzerland has in that space basis makes it interesting.
00:20:51.184 - 00:21:10.124, Speaker A: Maybe just add on. One interesting question is where do you go in the EU? It's sort of, you can go to Germany, to France. And one of the recent countries that popped up is interesting is Austria. That seems to be, some people perceive that's the most crypto friendly or understanding of the crypto industry. But I'm interested to hear if anyone has views on that.
00:21:13.924 - 00:21:14.664, Speaker B: Please.
00:21:15.004 - 00:22:38.044, Speaker E: First of all, thank you very much for your presentation. It's great to be here and thank you for the conference. My question is about, I mean, it involves a little bit doubt to the negative approach to european regulation because mica is more institution, I mean, service provider, company focused regulation. As I remember it explicitly states that purely decentralized models are out of the scope of the regulation. And when we look at the structure of mica, Marcus, in crypto asset regulation, it is a kind of identical, not identical, but similar copy of the markets, the directive of markets in financial instruments. So basically it regulates similar institutions who act in crypto industry. So my question is that if you put aside libertarian propaganda, do you think that regulating third parties or regulating crypto asset service providers a good idea? I mean, is it a good idea to regulate them strictly? Thank you.
00:22:38.464 - 00:23:28.384, Speaker B: If I understand right, what I would say is I think it shows a problem of doing a two targeted regulation. I think that the pragmatic approach to the regulation is exactly what you want to do that covers more general cases. And I think that the fact exactly that these kind of platforms that are actually the breadth of why all these ecosystems are interesting, I mean, this fact of having decentralized governance, we are talking about completely revolutionary ways of running organizations, and we are still sticking our, or some regulators are sticking themselves to traditional models, shows the short sightedness and the problem of trying to be excessively tight on which are the mechanisms in which the, the conditions under which people can operate or platforms can operate. And it's also a lack of understanding of what these technologies enable.
00:23:30.324 - 00:24:28.416, Speaker A: Maybe just a very basic observation. I've been in crypto for many years, almost, I don't know, 80 years. And one of the conundrums of this decentralization debate is it really goes against whatever the government believes in, because if I get up now and just punch in the face and break your nose, someone will call the police and say, hey, I did an action against you. So how we live in our society is someone takes an action, you're responsible for the action. So all the regulation, or actually criminal law, all sorts of law, is what kind of actions do people do? So the idea of there is no one or a very vague group of people taking actions really goes against whatever the government is believing in, what you call Dao or DeFi, whatever. And FIMa recently said, you know, from a legal perspective, they have to regulate entities and entities that are run by someone that can be held accountable. So the moment you go into this DAo discussion, it just doesn't reflect, it's not that FEMA doesn't want to do it.
00:24:28.416 - 00:25:01.826, Speaker A: They just, by law they can't. And I think that's a conundrum that will exist because it goes against the basic principles, how we live in. Having said that, I've been in this industry and even a former politician, I like this discussion a lot because I like to call it, you have to poke the bear every now and then and just get this discussion going. I don't know if you want to. I want to live in a world of Daos, I'm not sure. But the idea and the discussions and the thoughts about that is very refreshing. And I think Switzerland has those discussions, and I think it will stay with us for a couple of years.
00:25:01.826 - 00:25:31.974, Speaker A: There's no quick solution. One of the answers, FEMA always said when there recently this DeFi panel said, we have to stick to what the law says. If you want to have Dallas or more decentralized, you have to talk to the lawmaker, to parliament. You have to convince politicians that this is a good idea. It's not a regulatory topic, but it's a wonderful discussion to have. And as a person who likes liberal ideas, one should poke the bear or the government in a friendly way.
00:25:38.494 - 00:25:49.954, Speaker C: There's another final question. I see. Please keep it short. The next session will start in just a few minutes. Oh, over here.
00:25:52.174 - 00:26:16.604, Speaker F: Well, thank you so much for this talk. I would like to follow up on the political issues, which is basically, as you mentioned, we have to convince politicians to be, like, crypto friendly somehow. How do you see the landscape regarding, like, political lobby, maybe blockchain interest in some parties or candidates? Like, do you think we will see in the future stuff like the blockchain party office, stuff like that.
00:26:20.224 - 00:26:50.994, Speaker A: I mean, there used to be a private party and private pirates. No private excuse, Pirates party. And it was run by Alex Rouss. Roussel. He's one of the key figures in the bitcoin community, if you should follow him in telegram. So there has been approaches like that. I mean, I think what happened with the ICO guideline and also the DLT framework, we had this unique opportunity where there was a lot of enthusiasm about innovation, and the parliament passed that law without any opposition, which was amazing.
00:26:50.994 - 00:27:25.094, Speaker A: Having said that, there's blockchain federation, a lolloping group, there's a parliamentarian group of digital assets. What I have seen, I don't think you see that everywhere. I think the bandwagon has moved on to AI. When you talk to politicians, that's what they're worrying about at a moment or think about. And sort of crypto and blockchain has been bit toned down. So at the moment, I can't see a party like that happening and anytime soon. And last but not least, I think it's, again, what I've seen is in Switzerland, you can have those open debates.
00:27:25.094 - 00:27:50.324, Speaker A: There's different party members that opened it, but it's a very tricky topic for politicians. You know, I've been in this space for many years, so I'm claiming I understand a little bit. I'm not claiming I understand. I'm not a developer, but those discussions are very tough for politicians, and AI is as tough as crypto. So making those topic available to politicians is also an educational benefit. You know, I think something for the universities.
00:27:52.424 - 00:28:13.226, Speaker B: Yeah. The only thing that I would say is related to this idea is the problem is having the full platform for such a political organization as well. It's very difficult. I think it's only one angle. I think that either you. It's the difficulty of trying to completely change a system from within. Okay.
00:28:13.226 - 00:28:16.594, Speaker B: And that's why my conundrum appears as well.
