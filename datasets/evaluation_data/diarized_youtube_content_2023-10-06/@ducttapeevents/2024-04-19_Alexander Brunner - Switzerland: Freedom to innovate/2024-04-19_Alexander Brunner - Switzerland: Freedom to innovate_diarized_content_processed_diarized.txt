00:00:02.200 - 00:00:23.622, Speaker A: Thank you. Well, for the next 20 minutes, I want to talk about something I guess all of you are interested in. It's innovation, but I want to take a little bit different angle. I want to ask about what is good and what is bad. Innovation and how can Switzerland compete globally on a scale. And I have a few interesting slides. So this is Sunday afternoon.
00:00:23.622 - 00:00:46.454, Speaker A: You're here on a quite nice day on a Sunday afternoon. So it shows your dedication to innovation. Congratulations to all of you of making it that far. And I got to ask you a few questions. I hope you don't mind, but innovation is a buzzword. Every politician, every entrepreneur, every CEO is using the word. And I was wondering why you're in that sector.
00:00:46.454 - 00:01:03.992, Speaker A: Why do you care about innovation? Some people want to get famous, become a celebrity. Some people want to save the world. Some people want to make money. Maybe I'll just go a quick show of hands who's into innovation because they want to get rich. All right. Okay. Yeah.
00:01:03.992 - 00:01:10.440, Speaker A: Be honest. That's perfect. I like that. I'll come back. Anyone wants to save the world? Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
00:01:10.440 - 00:01:22.020, Speaker A: Oh, multiple wonderful. More people saving the world. Anyone becomes. Yeah, sure. And everyone's become famous, maybe famous. That's. That's interesting.
00:01:22.020 - 00:01:34.636, Speaker A: The famous bit is in Switzerland. I know. I'm okay with money. Perfect. Perfect. So I like you're a bit engaged, so I'll keep it that way and I'll get back to you. You want to add something? Sorry, you're.
00:01:34.636 - 00:02:00.514, Speaker A: I wonder, how is it possible to get one without the other? Interesting question. Interesting. I don't know. We can debate, maybe compute into Q and a. Interesting question. But my key point this afternoon is, and that's sort of the title of my presentation, I strongly believe that it matters a lot where innovation happens. And congratulations, I think you're in one of the best places to make sensible innovation or good innovation.
00:02:00.514 - 00:02:25.982, Speaker A: And that's what I want to show to you. So I truly believe that it's important where it happens. So let me try to convince you. So, as with a program, can innovation be good or bad? And anyone thinks that innovation can be, let's say, I think a lot of you believe it's going to be good. Anyone think it can be bad, too? Someone? Noddy? No, it's always, ah, someone. It's always both. Yeah, it's always both.
00:02:25.982 - 00:02:41.654, Speaker A: I like that. I like that. Okay. Yeah. Because normally it's like, yeah, innovation. You know, like, okay, so we'll come back to that and other question, that if you believe that it matters, and I'll try to convince you that it's important where innovation happens. I think Switzerland is a great place for innovation.
00:02:41.654 - 00:03:17.784, Speaker A: I'll prove it to you. But my question is, when you look at us, in the last year, they invested $42.5 billion in AI alone. The entire sector in Switzerland, VC funding last year was below 4 million. I think the peak was 4 billion last year, lower. How can we, as tiny little country, compete on that scale? I'll try to come back to that, but I think it's an important question if you believe that's important, where innovation happened. And what I like to show is, like, everyone likes, some of you guys want to get rich, everyone likes numbers.
00:03:17.784 - 00:03:53.332, Speaker A: Have you seen that Saudi Arabia wants to invest 40 billion into AI? You've seen that. And they also want to develop AGI. So I tried to make my first point why it matters where innovation happens. So I joke to my wife. I said, if they're going to develop autonomous cars or any type of tech, what kind of data do they have? They will only have data from male drivers. Why? Because until very recently in Saudi Arabia, women were not allowed to drive. Furthermore, as you know, if you get punished in Saudi Arabia, they're still chopping off hands and hanging people.
00:03:53.332 - 00:04:52.280, Speaker A: What kind of AGI comes out of a country that has that data set? Ever thought about that? Just think about it. I'm not saying it's gonna happen, but it maybe makes you think about, hey, maybe it's important where it happens. But then, as you guys like numbers, it's like poor Saudi Arabia, 40 billion? What about 7 trillion? Like what? 7 trillion to work into Agi? So again, the US, never shy of out competing anyone, puts those massive numbers out there. I know it's debated if he said that or not, but I think the direction is clear. So how can we compete in the future with the US? And does it matter? We say, hey, it's okay, the US are all fine. Or does it matter where innovation comes from? And as we are a crypto conference, I'd like to show that sometimes bad things happen, even in us. Who thinks that 25 years for Sam Altman is not enough? Anyone thinks he should go to jail forever? Okay.
00:04:52.280 - 00:05:03.648, Speaker A: One, some people think it's too long. Okay. Some. Okay. Anyone thinks that 25 years is right. Okay, interesting. There you go.
00:05:03.648 - 00:05:24.884, Speaker A: But obviously. So there's a lot of debate how many people have got hurt or not. But the only thing I'm trying to say is innovation can go both ways, as you said. But more interesting, when we talk about the US. And that's one of the first interesting points. And I have, I'm interested. When you think about it, it seems like quite often things go bad in us.
00:05:24.884 - 00:05:52.084, Speaker A: I mean, you got Elizabeth Holmes from Terranos, you got Adam Newman there. You can debate how bad it was or not. From Wework, we got Sam Bankman fried, we got Silicon Valley bank. So it seems, at least when something goes wrong in the US, the outcome is pretty darn big. But the question is, when you talk about innovation, it's about failure. We all know things can go wrong. So the question, I think that's a society question.
00:05:52.084 - 00:06:39.412, Speaker A: And coming back to my point, it matters that we have a discussion, is how much downside do you want to have when you do innovations? How big of a downside are we as a society comfortable? And the interesting thing about the US is they seem to be quite comfortable with pretty big downsides, because the upsides are so big. The more the upside, the more you accept the downside. So the interesting question here is, and it's a bit also with Sam Bank, Van Fried, what kind of innovation you want to have? You want to move fast and break things, fake it until you make it. How much do you want that? And how much do you say, hey, actually, we don't want those extreme outcomes. And I come back to that because it has to do with Switzerland. So what I'm trying to say, I'm trying to prove the point that innovation can go both, both ways. And probably, as the gentleman here said, you always have a bit of both.
00:06:39.412 - 00:07:05.482, Speaker A: You never quite know. It depends. Before he went to jail, Sam Bankman, fried, he met Biden, he met the CFTC. See, he was very highly regarded. All of a sudden, he's in jail. Anyhow, coming back to my point, why it is important where innovation happens. Have you seen that? Very recently, I think, dated 28 March, the SEC got in a court case, now got the permission to sue Coinbase.
00:07:05.482 - 00:07:35.176, Speaker A: I know Coinbase is suing the SEC as well. So it's an interesting dance. Have you seen that? Because it's interesting what they're saying. They're saying they got the permission now to sue Coinbase because they now believe that staking is a service, that's a security service, and then the SEC is in charge, and they say it's an unregistered activity, it should be registered. So it's very interesting. And as I'm sure all of you are aware, this is the SEC. Then the CFTC, the other regulator, has a different view, and they like to feud about it.
00:07:35.176 - 00:08:04.918, Speaker A: So this is insane. It's literally insane to watch how a big country like the US gets something like that so wrong. One of the regulators, two regulators are feuding who's in charge and what it is. And they're suing each other or suing a big player. Let me contrast it to Switzerland, who has seen that end of last year, the fame mother regulatory changed its practice on staking. Who's aware of that? A few. Okay, a few.
00:08:04.918 - 00:08:32.402, Speaker A: Great. Well, it's very interesting. And now my point, why it's important where innovation happens. Finma put out a proposal last year about how to treat staking service providers, and they focused very much on what happens in a bankruptcy case. How directly can you access your coins? And to be frank, in the light of FTX and some others, it's a valid question. But they were a bit restrictive. Basically the result was you had to be a bank, and that was very bad for a lot.
00:08:32.402 - 00:08:55.530, Speaker A: So a lot of the industry got together. There's the swiss blockchain federation, the lobby organization, and they had a discussion with Finma. And Finma updated their staking provision. And I understand from most of the service provider that's something they can live with. And it shows a quite contrast to the US. Do you agree? The US is suing without giving clear guidelines. And here there's a debate going on.
00:08:55.530 - 00:09:14.470, Speaker A: It's co creation. Again, it matters where innovation happens. And someone whom you all like, I'm sure, I hope here at Ethereum conference is Vitalik. And he worries a lot about innovation too. And he worries about cars. Who's aware of that? That he's worried about cars. Interesting.
00:09:14.470 - 00:09:40.522, Speaker A: Okay, following him. There's a key term in there, privacy. He worries about cars, because autonomous cars, or semi autonomous cars collect a lot of data. A Tesla has six cameras and collects up to 19 terabyte of data every day sends to the US processes. Ellen Moss said, and use it for AI, whatever they do with it. Your data, you are collecting. When you drive a Tesla, you're collecting data not about yourself, but your entire surrounding.
00:09:40.522 - 00:10:01.278, Speaker A: He worries about that. I do too. And privacy is obviously something, a value that's embedded innovation. You can ignore it or say, hey, it's important. So he worries a lot about that. He worries a lot about it. He recently had a blog post at the end of last year where he's contemplating, because there's two opposing forces.
00:10:01.278 - 00:10:16.034, Speaker A: One is privacy. I think anonymity is the wrong word. It should be privacy. And you have to have sort of compliance. You want to prevent bad actors using certain things. You know, that's the sanction list. And that's something you need to find a balance.
00:10:16.034 - 00:10:34.676, Speaker A: And he worries a lot about it. Read up. And he published a paper with the University of Basel. Interesting. Why the University of Basel? Because University of Baseline is in Switzerland, and we Swiss care about privacy. Again, it makes a big impact if you do this here or somewhere else. It matters where innovation happens.
00:10:34.676 - 00:10:54.864, Speaker A: And sorry to keep pushing, but that end of last year, who has seen that? He wants. There you go, a few. Who knows what a cypherpunk is? And I'd just like to say, I'll come back to that. You have to be very careful about the spelling. It's Yph. It's not B. Okay, so it's cyberpunk.
00:10:54.864 - 00:11:13.024, Speaker A: It's not cyberpunk. I saw on the channel someone talks about cyberpunk. It's the wrong thing. Sorry, I have to be a stickler because it's important. So he wants Ethereum become more cypherpunk. So anyone knows what a cypherpunk is or a concept? Anyone? Yes. I don't have a micro.
00:11:13.024 - 00:11:52.832, Speaker A: I think you can shout. I have to stand here. Do you want to answer? Perfect. You got it. You nailed hundred points. And why is it important? Because bitcoin, we don't know 100% who invented it, but the first transaction happened in California among the cypherpunks. The whole crypto movement, the whole bitcoin movement is cypherpunk.
00:11:52.832 - 00:12:16.858, Speaker A: If you don't know about it, read up about it, because it's the DNA of all what we're here for. And he cares about it and I care about it because that's the point. As you correctly said, cypherpunk is. It's a technology movement, and they care about cryptography. Cryptography. Do you want to make things private? You want to protect certain information. It's privacy enhancing, and it's about social and political change.
00:12:16.858 - 00:12:52.724, Speaker A: But first and foremost, it's the worry that the state becomes omnipresent with the data and the technology now available to the state. That's the cyberpunk movement. You want to have check and balances. It's not about total anonymity. I mean, some are maybe libertarian, but basically it's giving the tools to us so we can protect ourselves from an overreach from governments. Yes. Comment? I think it would give clarity because the concept is new that one of the key points is that they consider privacy as a human right.
00:12:52.724 - 00:13:13.084, Speaker A: Correct. And not all philosophical movements see privacy that way. Correct. Perfect. But it's a human right that you can protect yourself. It's high privacy from overreach from the government. All right, interesting coming back to Switzerland, who knows? David Shaum, he's a cypherpunk.
00:13:13.084 - 00:13:43.092, Speaker A: He was instrumental. He created e money or e cash, excuse me, that was a predecessor to bitcoin. He's a cryptographer. And a lot of the cryptographers in the US are cypherpunks because they want to protect. And he recently talked about privacy in pilot for wholesale CBDC. I know Holt says CBC, CBC is not everyone's favorite topic, but he did that with the Swiss National bank. And now look at what the Swiss National bank said about the pilot.
00:13:43.092 - 00:14:06.724, Speaker A: What does it start off? He's a board member. Privacy is an important user requirement, but it's difficult to solve. And he goes on about this balance between privacy and compliance. You have to do this. But what I'm trying to say again, does Swiss care about privacy? If you go to South Saudi Arabia, would you expect the same statement? I don't know. I will guess not. So it's important that we do it here.
00:14:06.724 - 00:14:52.210, Speaker A: So sort of coming to the second point, how can we compete? Switzerland is the world innovation champion. There's different stats. The UN has done the World Intellectual Property Organization. But why is so innovative and is that enough for us to influence post positive change when it comes to technology? Well, we have a bit of a track record. And in June last year, we were awarded as the number one crypto hub in the world by Coin Coindesk. It says zug, but basically they meant Swiss Switzerland, but now something totally different. Who has watched the Nvidia GTC conference? Okay, so this is Jensen Wang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, and he is on stage with robots.
00:14:52.210 - 00:15:04.294, Speaker A: Which robot is real? Do you know? One robot, two or three? You see four robots. One is real, the other are sort of projections. Anyone ideas? Any guesses?
00:15:04.674 - 00:15:07.214, Speaker B: Paul, Paula knows we have microphone here.
00:15:09.874 - 00:15:29.794, Speaker A: Yes, yes. That's on stage in Silicon Valley last month. Let me show you. That's what I taped last month at ETA in Zurich. If it. Or if it runs. This is 30 minutes from here.
00:15:29.794 - 00:15:50.490, Speaker A: That thing was developed by Disney Research Lab. Disney research lab develops here in Switzerland. We've ETH this robot. That robot was on stage. The real robot that was on stage was made in Zurich. It's tech developed in Switzerland that it's cutting edge. We're really cutting edge.
00:15:50.490 - 00:16:17.068, Speaker A: I think that's the point I'm trying to make here. Yeah, that's fair, fellow. My girls even touched, touched it, they were very excited. So finalize, how can we compete? And another gentleman who started in Switzerland, ATR, is Albert Einstein. He said, creativity is intelligence. Having fun? So what do you need for innovation? Innovation is experimentation. It's about trying out things.
00:16:17.068 - 00:16:37.252, Speaker A: We all agree trying new things, but things fail. But it's two parts. You also need certain guidelines of certain things. You don't want to happen when it gets too bad. But the innovation bit is creativity first. And for that you need freedom. And I think this is the contrast to other, like when you do something, innovation in Saudi Arabia and China, certain things you're not allowed to do.
00:16:37.252 - 00:16:57.758, Speaker A: Because the government doesn't want to do that. No, because it's not. Switzerland is very free. And one of the reasons why we world champion is this, the human Freedom Index. I think for ten years, consecutively, we're the freest country in the world. Switzerland, you're living in paradise, if you will, if you like freedom. And we're here, so we're at the forefront of that.
00:16:57.758 - 00:17:48.434, Speaker A: But I think there's one thing missing if we want to compete on a global scale, and that's my key message. Beside that you're all in the right location, is we have to improve. If one thing, and I think one thing that we have as Swiss become better, and I like that a lot of you raise your hands when it's about making money, because I recently I'm writing a book about AI based on interviews, and I interviewed this gentleman, he's Stefan Grycken, he's ex Google Silicon Valley, he has a startup here, cradle Bo. They're doing genes sequencing on pro protein development with AI. And he said the problem with Switzerland is this first time founders or swiss founders, they think about the product. We Swiss like quality, we like the best product, we like to be amazing, like this little robot on stage, it's amazing. The interesting thing is I asked the guys what's the commercial application? It's going to be starring in film.
00:17:48.434 - 00:18:17.308, Speaker A: They said, no, CCGI is better. What about theme parks? Well, you need to control it. We don't know yet. So those researchers had no clue how to make money out of it's super tech, but it's like no clue how to make money. They literally said that's the guys in the US, they're going to figure out how we're going to make money out of this thing. Which was a very swift statement, because what he said the second time founders think about distribution, how to sell your product. And I do believe that Americans think about distribution first.
00:18:17.308 - 00:18:51.296, Speaker A: They think first, how can we sell it and then develop the tech, the Swiss, we develop the tech and then we have the product. But I think to summarize and finish up, if we as a swiss country need to go up against the big guys, whoever you think that is, if it's us or Saudi Arabia, we are free to innovate. We have the creativity, it's our secret sauce. But I think we have to learn how to become better at commercializing and at selling products at scale. It's my belief. I've been a consultant for more than two years. I was executive in different startups.
00:18:51.296 - 00:19:19.752, Speaker A: I've seen it again and again, and I hope that you get inspired to really go on this product journey. I'm happy to have conversations if you want to learn something about it. And I think as Swiss, we have to punch above our weight the freedom and innovation bit we have sorted out. I don't worry about innovation in Switzerland. We have world tech coming out of Switzerland. We have to become bolder and better in commercializing and then we can compete and create tech. That's not Agi from Saudi Arabia, I hope with that.
00:19:19.752 - 00:19:21.004, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
00:19:25.824 - 00:19:29.244, Speaker B: Love it. Impressive. We have questions right away. I'll give you the microphone.
00:19:29.544 - 00:19:36.488, Speaker C: Hi, I'm sorry I walked in late to your talk. I'm not sure if you talked about Mika, but you were mentioning. Go ahead.
00:19:36.576 - 00:19:38.404, Speaker A: No, in the description it was.
00:19:38.784 - 00:20:13.244, Speaker C: Yeah, but what I did hear you say was the influence of us regulatory apparatus on crypto globally. But the reality is, Mika, actually are a set of regulations that the EU has issued. And I find Switzerland to be in an interesting situation because, you know, it participates in the EU common market, but it actually is not part of the EU, so it doesn't have any influence over decisions. But in a lot of ways it's become constrained. Right. Without having a voice at the table. And I think these conflicts are going to become more acute.
00:20:13.244 - 00:20:38.164, Speaker C: Financial regulation is another example of that as well as, you know, even though, you know, crypto is flourishing in Switzerland, like the swiss banking regulations are very compliant with us regulations and EU regulations. So how do you think about Mecca and the kind of very aggressive stance it's taken on a lot of issues, very thorny issues in crypto.
00:20:38.924 - 00:21:12.448, Speaker A: I had on Friday a chat, an opening chat with Claudia Sonia about that. I know in the description says, well, Mika, there's two views, very checking answers. I think this cross border issue in finance, as Swiss, we've had it for many years, it's in traditional finance and still we have the biggest wealth manager in the world based in Switzerland. So somehow we're Swiss. And that's sort of my answer to your question. We're very good in creating ties with other ecosystems and if you look at that, so we're actually a home of blockchain association we're running. We're really building ties with Dubai, with Singapore, UK.
00:21:12.448 - 00:21:43.686, Speaker A: I think we always a smaller country. We need to obviously look what the big guys are doing, but we also need to build ties with other countries and why this is something that we're very good at. There's so many international companies based here that help us reach out. So the downside is, yes, Mika will have effects. You know, we can't ignore it. But I think we've been historically very clever in sorting out how to still access those markets. So I'm not as gloom and doom as some people are and there's some workarounds.
00:21:43.686 - 00:21:49.046, Speaker A: You can go through Liechtenstein, potentially without going into details, but I think it's not the end of the world.
00:21:49.150 - 00:21:52.714, Speaker B: We like Liechtenstein. It's a wonderful place. It's gateway to Europe.
00:21:53.214 - 00:22:18.128, Speaker C: Yeah. But I'm going to push back here because I'm not just american, I live in Switzerland and it's not easy to open a bank account as an american in Switzerland. Right. And so it's not this sort of like, Switzerland will have to cooperate with trading partners like the EU and with the US. And it already does. And it already does have a significant amount of restrictions. So unless we actually think through these harder problems around how to balance.
00:22:18.128 - 00:22:39.294, Speaker C: Right. For example, privacy pools, like you mentioned. I don't think it's going to have. Just saying. I don't think it's going to have as much freedom to say, not comply with these jurisdictions within which it is nested in and within which it's trading, as you might think.
00:22:40.794 - 00:23:04.012, Speaker A: I think that's true. I mean, Americans in Switzerland, bank accounts that has a long history going back to the financial crisis, that's unfortunately a very unique problem. It's not that the banks don't want american clients, it's just that reporting is a nightmare when you have american clients. Clients. Sorry to hear that. You're not the only one. But my general observation, maybe a bit more the crypto libertarian view of mine is, I agree.
00:23:04.012 - 00:23:28.698, Speaker A: And I think I agree that you have to comply with certain standards in certain countries. And, Mika, you can't ignore. I mean, but the interesting bit about. The interesting big about blockchain and crypto is it's decentralized it's very hard to pin down where things happen. So I actually always said a lot of what is happening in Defi is sort of not regulated, doesn't fit in. Mika doesn't talk about defier. Even when it comes to stablecoin, there's a lot of gaps in there.
00:23:28.698 - 00:24:02.660, Speaker A: But the pure existence that there is an alternative out there is sort of what I call the poke the bear effect. And it's good that someone is poking the bear, and maybe Switzerland sometimes also poking the bear. We did it last time with Libra on diem. We got really reprimanded by the US, but we have a bit of a tendency to every now and then, poke, poke the bear. And I think even as crypto and ethereum community, sometimes you have to do things that are not completely thought through by the government, because then you push innovation forward. So I think without those alternatives, then we will be totally lost. We stay locked in.
00:24:02.660 - 00:24:20.704, Speaker A: So I agree that we need to mostly be compliant, but sometimes certain things get developed and then the regulator is to figure out what to do with it. And if the AI is a very good point, in case no one has really figured it out, but because it stays there, we start thinking about it. And Switzerland can do that. Yeah.
00:24:21.404 - 00:24:29.184, Speaker B: Powerful. One more question, please. I'll come to you. The last question, then we'll move. That's powerful.
00:24:30.404 - 00:24:46.728, Speaker D: I was just wondering, so you're suggesting that we need to be compliant. And what's I feel like in DeFi or building stuff on fear? What's the point of being compliant? The whole purpose of cyberpunk is not being compliant.
00:24:46.776 - 00:24:47.224, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:47.344 - 00:25:02.560, Speaker D: And things like just building a simple software like Tornado cash, it's just a simple protocol. Somehow they really go after those developers and put them in prison. Just like, you know, what's the whole point of it?
00:25:02.672 - 00:25:49.624, Speaker A: You'll answer, I have, you know, I've been in crypto for seven or eight years. I've made Vitalik and a few others. So I have, as a, I'm not libertarian, but I'm a liberal person. So I like that, that some people are doing things that are just not fully thought through. I think the reality is, if you really want to get depressed, besides Tornado cash on unbanked, the podcast recently, Paulo, or what's his name, the tether CEO, I keep forgetting his family. He gives an interview and he states very clearly, a lot of people think tether is not regulated. He says in the podcast they work with the SEC and FBI directly, so the Americans have a pass through.
00:25:49.624 - 00:26:12.760, Speaker A: So unfortunately that is happening, but it's too tech. It's such a complicated and fast moving spectrum that sometimes the regulator just doesn't catch up. And I think that's still good. I still remember in 2018, I was on stage, it was when. When the ICO guidelines came out, and then someone said something very simple or very similar. He said, oh, we decentralized. We don't care about a regulator.
00:26:12.760 - 00:26:39.168, Speaker A: And I still remember a lawyer friend of mine got up and he said, yes, the blockchain protocol doesn't care. The algorithm doesn't care. That's true. But if the police shows up in the morning at your house and knocks at the door, you're not decentralized. So that's sort of a bit the problem that exists. But the world has enough pockets where things, and you can't put the genie back in the bottle. Even China has tried to kill crypto, I think, six times, when I counted correctly, they haven't managed.
00:26:39.168 - 00:26:51.664, Speaker A: So my hats off to everyone who's trying. And really, it's a political, societal mission to keep pushing that and not giving up. And sometimes you have some hard experiences.
