00:00:00.800 - 00:00:16.062, Speaker A: Hello. You are in the Institute of Crypto Anarchy. I am Camille. I'm hosting because I love you so much. This is my community, and I keep coming back. Next we have Tien. He's a digital product designer.
00:00:16.062 - 00:00:41.204, Speaker A: Since 2015, he's worked on circonomy, a Dao, all about circular economics. He's currently freelancing because he was laid off since January, but on the job market. So if you're hiring, let him know. This is Cyberpunk V, Solarpunk 2077.
00:00:44.904 - 00:01:02.124, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you, Camille. Yes. Hello, everyone. My name is Tian Wen, and welcome to my workshop all about envisioning what a web three powered Solarpunk 27 feature should or could be. Before I continue, I just want to say we don't have a lot of people here, so please feel free to move up. And this is going to be.
00:01:02.124 - 00:01:33.644, Speaker B: Since this is going to be a workshop, you know, it's going to be interactive. So if you want to, like, move up, then that'd be great, but it's okay if you don't want to anyway. All right, I'll move on to introducing myself. So, yeah, Tian Yuanzhou is my full name, but you can just call me Tian. I have, in fact, my first name. Tian yuan has two meanings that make it so that I was born to be here in web three, because, so tianyuan means sky and yuan means dollar, or the chinese dollar. So poetically translate that to mean airdrop.
00:01:33.644 - 00:02:07.330, Speaker B: So that's one of the meanings. And then the other meaning is yuan means also the origin of the universe. And so because it comes from the center point in the go board, you know, go right. That center point means origin of the universe, you could also translate my name to mean shelling point. So for those who are. Who know the Refi world git coin, you know how shelling point has become a major concept in that world. Anyway, so, yeah, if you want to follow me, that's my twitter and telegram.
00:02:07.330 - 00:02:48.430, Speaker B: And yeah, other pieces about me is I've been an effective altruist since 2010, before concept. Been in web three since 2015, when I first met Vitalik, and been in refi since 2019, when I attended the world's first retreat organized by. And then the reason why and how I got to where I am today is because of this big question that I came up with for myself ever since I was a university student. And it's this question of how might we make the world a better place in a scalable, sustainable, and systemic fashion. And so, moving on. It's okay. I could just click yeah, it's fine.
00:02:48.430 - 00:03:55.254, Speaker B: Thank you. Okay, so how I got into where I am today thinking about Solarpunk, it all started way back when I was a student, and I fell into the world of social impact with these three organizations as, like, places where I got to exercise that passion for social impact. So engineers without Borders is a nonprofit in Canada, all about sending people from Canada to Africa to help the startups there, businesses there build and grow. Amplabs was a tech nonprofit founded by a friend of mine that was all about tackling homelessness and then shared changes, another fintech social enterprise founded by a friend of mine, all about microfinance. And yes, they're not web three, but that was, like, the origin point of my journey into social impact. And then my relationship with the world of Refi and Solarpunk was thanks to these three organizations. So because I attended their Refi retreat way back in 2018 2019, good dollar I worked for previously as their lead designer, and they're a crypto UBi project, one of the first to launch way back in 2020.
00:03:55.254 - 00:04:29.010, Speaker B: And then raise is an african based web three startup all about helping african business owners build and grow by tokenizing their businesses. And they recently, I worked with them recently, actually, because there I put raise because. So as Camille mentioned, I'm freelancing. So I did a project for them where I designed essentially, like, an impact investment DaO platform for raise. And then Defi current is another company I'm working for. They're not Refi. But, you know, like I said, I'm just freelancing because I was laid off in January and then the other two organizations.
00:04:29.010 - 00:04:48.266, Speaker B: So Refi Toronto is a monthly meetup group in Toronto, where I live and work, all about Refi. And then zirconomy is this Dao that's all about circular economics. And I'll talk about that a bit later. Okay. So why am I passionate about the world of Refi and Solarpunk? About it? Because of this video game. Who's heard of it? I hope someone has. Nobody.
00:04:48.266 - 00:05:24.264, Speaker B: Okay. All right. Way back when I was a kid, this video game inspired my love for Refi. Well, eventually, because this concept where the characters go on this journey of world regeneration and that, it's basically a journey of saving the world. But, yeah, so how it works is the main characters, they have to go to this tower called the Tower of Salvation. They have to ascend the tower, wake up a goddess, and then they're supposed to save the world. Now, you might be wondering, how the hell does this relate to Refi? Well, it turns out that in this video game, the world that the characters live in, this world is powered by Mana.
00:05:24.264 - 00:05:56.990, Speaker B: Mana is like this concept that the closest approximation to that concept in our world is like oil. It's this resource that is used everywhere by everyone. And so in the world that the characters live in, it's called Sylvarante. Mana is low. So it's not a flourishing world, not a prosperous world, but they find out that there's actually another world that is a sister world living in parallel to their world. That world has a lot of mana, and so they're more flourishing, more prosperous. And so when one world has more mana, the other world has less mana.
00:05:56.990 - 00:07:06.880, Speaker B: It's like an hourglass effect. And so how this relates to my love for Refi and Solarpunk and our world is, I think we live in a world where there is an hourglass effect, where the global north, which is mainly the western world, it is prosperous because it has taken advantage of the global south. So we take resources from the global south to enrich the global north. And so not only do we have this division between global north and global south, but we have also, unfortunately, created a world, or inherited a world that of nature, to create a bunch of artificial assets that basically, like, essentially forms this other dichotomy of ecology versus economy, where we prioritize our economy over nature or ecology. Okay, with all that said, I've come up with three activities for this workshop. These three activities are going to help us answer these three questions of why Solarpunk 2077, where and how? And then what is stopping us? Or what is it going to take for us to get to Solarpunk 2077? Oh, ok. Ok, thank you.
00:07:06.880 - 00:07:40.540, Speaker B: Thank you. All right, so for the first activity, we're going to help answer this question of why Solarpunk 2077. So why did I call it that? Is because it's inspired by this video game, Cyberpunk 2077. Who's played this game? Or heard of this game? Ok, 2345. Okay, so for those who don't know what this video game is about, I actually have this game, but I haven't played it myself. But. Or who would like to explain this video game's premise? Would anyone? No one? Okay, I'll explain.
00:07:40.540 - 00:08:21.298, Speaker B: Okay, so the premise of this video game is, in the year 2077, the world has no countries. The concept of countries do not exist anymore, because instead of countries, it's mega corporations. They rule the world. And there's like half a dozen of these companies that rule the world with an iron fist, both literally and figuratively. And so literally because they use cybernetic, cybernetically enhanced super soldiers to run the police states of these corporate countries, or corporate states. And so why does this matter? You might think this is so far fetched, but I. Whoops, I don't think it is.
00:08:21.298 - 00:09:35.194, Speaker B: Because, you know, number one, why 2077? Well, you know, we have this concept called the singularity, and people predict it'll happen in 2045. And it's like, yes, 2045 is not 2077, but you can imagine once the singularity happens and companies take advantage of that, they could potentially build a cyberpunk 2077 just a few decades later. And also, it's not far fetched to believe that companies can become countries when we already have companies that engulf the size of countries right now with all these big american tech companies that are essentially corporate states already. And so it matters for us to think about, to look at, sorry to care about this, because we have all these movies, tv shows, and video games centered with a cyberpunk aesthetic or genre. And like, one of the most famous, we've all heard of black mirror. And I think it might be entertaining for these movies, tv shows, and video games to exist. But I don't think it's good for us to continue to always tell these cyberpunk stories.
00:09:35.194 - 00:10:10.268, Speaker B: And the reason for that is because of how human civilization evolves. So I came up with this model years ago, and it's basically, I think human civilization evolves through ages. And that, you know, I didn't come up with that. Anthropologists did. Right? We went from the Stone age to the current age of information, but I came up with the specifics of what happens within each age. So within each age, I believe it evolves in this way where we go from engineering to economics to environment, and then it rinses, lathers, repeats, so on and so forth. And so what do each stage mean? So the engineering stage is the technological stage.
00:10:10.268 - 00:10:42.844, Speaker B: It's the foundational stage of each age that influences the economics, which is not necessarily about money. It's more about how we organize ourselves socially or how we determine value, define value. And then, so that's basically all about the social constructs of that age. Then the economic stage defines the environment stage. And what is the environment stage? There's actually two dimensions to that. So there's the natural environment and the artificial environment. So based on the social structures, which is based on the technology, we have a certain impact on the natural environment of the world.
00:10:42.844 - 00:11:57.980, Speaker B: But we also can utilize the social structures that are built on the technologies to create artificial environments, which is basically culture. And so I believe it rinses, lathers, repeats, because with the stories we tell in every previous age, that influences how the next age will be, because the stories we tell will inspire what are the future technologies we create, the future organizations we create, and so on and so forth. And so, given how I believe this is how human civilization evolves, if we continue to tell cyberpunk stories, then it'll be a self fulfilling prophecy, and we will eventually be able to build that cyberpunk future because it's self reinforcing, self censoring, and self destructive. So what do I mean by that? If. If we continue to basically be negative, tell negative stories, and be pessimistic about our future, then it'll be all those things. It's similar to how if you're always negative, or if I'm always negative about my current job situation, then no one's gonna want to hire me because they're gonna think I'm this negative person, and then I'm gonna go down this downward spiral, and I might end up doing something bad and maybe killing myself or something. I'm not gonna.
00:11:57.980 - 00:12:33.276, Speaker B: But I'm just saying, like, that is a possibility, right? And so I don't think we need. If we as a human race, continue to tell these negative stories, it'll be all those things. So. And I believe that web two is the path that if we continue to just enable web two to get bigger and bigger, that will lead to cyberpunk. Whereas Solarpunk, I think, is the ultimate or the end game of what we're doing here in the web three world. And so I think it'll be something that will be revealing, liberating, and constructive for humanity. And so here's a.
00:12:33.276 - 00:13:10.464, Speaker B: Before I tell you what the activity is, here's just a fun fact. I do believe, though, it's not all bad. I think western Sci-Fi especially, has been very cyberpunk, cyberpunky. But in actuality, actuality, chinese Sci-Fi has not been. It's been more optimistic. And why am I only focusing on the relationship between America and China? It's not only because I'm chinese, but it's because it's been said that the most important relationship, geopolitical relationship of our century is going to be between America and China. So I think it is important to look at how non western storytelling is happening in a Sci-Fi context.
00:13:10.464 - 00:13:44.866, Speaker B: Who here has seen wandering Earth, for example? Wandering Earth? Okay. Okay. My friend here. You know, it features a story of humanity coming together, banding together to build, to make Earth into a spaceship that could fly away because, well, the sun is about to explode, and so why does the earth need to fly away? Well, we're gonna move Earth to the nearest galaxy of Andromeda. And then also, humanity has been able to dig holes underground to basically put humanity underground, because, you know, if the earth is floating in space, it's going to be cold or freezing. And that's an understatement. And so they've been able to successfully do that.
00:13:44.866 - 00:13:57.146, Speaker B: Right. That's pretty optimistic. Right. And it wasn't just one human being that did all that. It wasn't rugged individualism that saved the day. It was everyone working together to save the day. And, yeah.
00:13:57.146 - 00:14:42.194, Speaker B: So with all that said, the first activity and, oh, so, by the way, how I ideally wanted to do this is I would break all of you up into three different groups, but each group will focus on one of the three activities, so we're not going to do one after the other. So the first activity is. Sorry. One of the three activities is basically about culture, about storytelling. And so how might we green pill the audience is the question that I would like you to answer. And so how this activity is going to work is you'll pick a medium, tv show, movie, or video game. And why these three? Why not a comic book or why not a book? Is because these visual mediums of storytelling, I think, is more accessible to the average user, the average person.
00:14:42.194 - 00:15:24.542, Speaker B: It's easier to consume a tv show, movie, or video game than a book because it just is. Yeah, I know that gitcoin, for example, does have a comic book series that they've been running ever since they launched, but I haven't even read their comic book, and it's just hard to consume a reading medium. Right. So you pick a medium, and then you pick a distributor, and then you pick your antagonist and your protagonist, and then you create a story around it. And then in your group, I would like you to also act it out in front of everyone at the end. Yeah. So we could figure out these groups later.
00:15:24.542 - 00:16:02.312, Speaker B: Maybe I'll present all the three activities first, and then we could figure out the groups. But before I move on, I just want to know who here already has an interest in this first activity of storytelling? Oh, we got these two. All right. Okay. Got three people who are interested, by the way, who here doesn't understand the concept of green pilling? Oh, okay. Okay. So green pilling was coined by the folks from Gitcoin or giveth, there's even a podcast about it.
00:16:02.312 - 00:16:47.036, Speaker B: And it's basically about, like. So you obviously know what the Matrix was about, right? And there was this red pill, blue pill concept. Green pilling is basically revealing to people that there is this world out there of people who are building towards that solarpunk future. Like, there are regens out there, there's refi. There's all this good stuff that's happening. But, like, the average person doesn't know that this good stuff is happening because mainstream media has flooded the news with bad news, right? Like, most people out there, the average person thinks crypto is full of scammers and pyramid schemes. And, like, I just recently saw John Oliver did another episode of cryptocurrencies, and it's basically saying the same thing.
00:16:47.036 - 00:17:22.676, Speaker B: You know, it's full of scammers, all thanks to SPF. So. So with all this bad storytelling out there, we need to combat that. And so the way to combat that is by green pilling people. All right, so, yeah, so that's activity number one. And then I'll have you to scan this if you want to partake in this activity so that I don't have to go back and show all these slides again. So wait for you to scan it before I move on.
00:17:22.676 - 00:18:00.684, Speaker B: Any questions or comments? By the way, I know I'm speaking quite fast. I hope you were able to follow. I just know that I'm just being cognizant of time, that's all. Okay, I will move on to the next activity as the second activity is all about where solarpunk exists. I believe we have Solarpunk already today. I've seen instances of it, use cases of it, but it's mostly in the triple r of remote, rural, and roaming. It's mostly in these remote, rural, and roaming places.
00:18:00.684 - 00:18:50.394, Speaker B: And I don't think that's good, because where are the highest population densities of the world? They're not in the remote, rural, and nomadic parts of the world, right? They're in the urban centers. So I believe if we continue to just move, I mean, if we ignore the urban centers of the world, then Solarpunk, to me, is an escapist's dream. And I put these two books here because. So this book is more touching upon the subject matter of how in this current neoliberal, capitalistic world, there's a lot of people who want to escape that. And so that's why we have solarpunk in the remote, rural, and roaming parts. This book is not really related to why Solarpunk exists in these three parts of the world. But this book is also about escapism, and it talks about how the rich wants to escape the current disasters or the coming disasters of the world.
00:18:50.394 - 00:19:30.832, Speaker B: So escapism is very much alive and well, and I don't think that's good. We shouldn't use escapism as a way to cope with the problems of the world. So where should solarpunk be? I think it should be in the cities, because two thirds of humanity will be in urban centers by 2050. Cities consume 75% of the world's natural resources, and 50% of solid waste are emitted in cities, and 60% of greenhouse gases are emitted in the cities. And so we need to build circular cities. I don't know who here knows what that concept is or has heard of that concept? Okay. One, not, oh, yeah, you have.
00:19:30.832 - 00:19:57.376, Speaker B: Oh, you haven't. Okay. All right. So a circular city is similar to the concept of a green city, if you've heard of that, or a smart city. But smart city to me, is like, it's more of a web two construct, because I've seen the criticisms. It could lead to surveillance state, essentially, right? But circular city is all about harnessing the concepts and the principles of circular economics, which has three core principles. I actually don't remember them at the top of my head, but at the end of the day, I'm just going to summarize it like this.
00:19:57.376 - 00:20:52.504, Speaker B: Circularity is all about ensuring that the physical resources of our world are kept in a loop, in a constant loop, instead of in a linear fashion, which they have been, for the most part, ever since the supply chains of the world became global, became multinational. We take from the global south, and then we just throw it back into the landfills of the world. Yes, and I know recycling exists, but there's been recently a lot of information out there, knowledge out there about the fact or research out there about the fact that recycling is broken. Not a lot of companies actually recycle. There's a lot of greenwashing and so on and so forth. So, you know, we need to build cities that are circular. And this concept is coined by the Ellen MacArthur foundation, who is one of the pioneers in the circular economics world, or school of thought, or whatever you want to call that.
00:20:52.504 - 00:21:10.404, Speaker B: And so you may have heard of the concept of the network society, or, sorry, the network state. And then if you've heard of the network state, you might have also heard of. Oh, yeah. Oh, okay, okay, I can continue, or.
00:21:11.584 - 00:21:45.116, Speaker C: Sorry, I am Julia from Crypto Commons association, we the group promoting the crypto Commons framing. And you were mentioning before, and we have a solarpunk hub in the Alps in Austria. But I totally agree that solar panc should be more in the cities and less like in these micro communities, because the impact that you have building your own small communes in the forest is so small and all the big things will happen in the city. So we should make city solar plants cannot escape in the rural areas.
00:21:45.260 - 00:22:35.074, Speaker B: Yes. Amen to that. Thank you. Thank you. And, yeah, so, and then, you know, obviously, if you're in web three and you're thinking about city building or whatever, you're going to gravitate towards this concept of the network state, right? But then if you've heard of network state, you might have heard of the counter to that being network society or the coordination. There has been some backlash towards that concept of the network state, and it's primarily done administered by this organization, sorry, by this person called the blockchain socialist, but he's interviewed a bunch of different people over the last year or so, all about combating that network state concept. And then inspired by that, I came up with this concept called the network village, which is another spin off, or it could just be another way to call a network society or a coordination.
00:22:35.074 - 00:23:26.924, Speaker B: But actually, no, I will say that my concept is slightly different. So, inspired by overthrowing the network state and the existing coordination concepts and application, a network village, which is inspired by also the concept of the global village, which is coined by Marshall McLuhan, a thought leader, way back. He passed away, but he coined the concept of the global village, which was basically the idea of the Internet before the Internet became a thing. And I think the word village conveys more of a sense of community. The expression it takes a village to do something, or it takes a village, that's an expression that exists. I think it carries the right vibe. And even the concept of a global village was all about interconnectedness, so I think that is a better name anyway.
00:23:26.924 - 00:24:18.706, Speaker B: So what is a network village? So I think network village should be about upholding cooperation over competition, similar to network society, but the other three are about interdependence and circularity. The third property is that similar to how network society says, you don't need to have physical land. So I said, physical land may not necessarily need to be purchased, but I believe a physical resource must be governed in a commons based approach. And then each network village will be a node, and they will exist in an on chain, or they will exist where that on chain governance and activity could occur. And so this is going to lead into the activity. So the activity is, how might we make cities more circular, powered by web three, starting today? And we'll do that by forming a network village. So the five things.
00:24:18.706 - 00:24:58.996, Speaker B: So how do we do that? Is, number one, pick a physical resource that needs circularity, such as plastics, electronics or metals, clothing or food, etcetera. You must have some combination of software and hardware to ensure circularity is applied to that physical resource. You must apply on chain mechanisms to manage and govern this phigital commons. Phygital being a combination of the word physical and digital. And then it must be applied to a urban center or suburban center, not a remote rural, and it cannot be nomadic. An example of a network village is something I came up with is centered on something called precious plastic. It's this project that exists out there.
00:24:58.996 - 00:25:39.246, Speaker B: It's a physical machinery that can break down plastic into tiny pellets. And so what if you had a network village that was centered on precious plastic, which specializes in breaking down plastics in a pellet form, and it can be reused? And so imagine each machine being a node in this network village. Yeah. So that's the second activity. If you want to do this one, then scan the QR code, man, hopefully we'll have enough time to even do these activities. I think we will. Okay.
00:25:39.246 - 00:26:10.122, Speaker B: All right. I'll make sure to move back and let you scan the other QR codes if you missed any. Okay, so the last activity, the third activity, three for web three, is all about politics and geopolitics. I know it's a very touchy subject matter, but I think it's an elephant in the room that must be addressed, I believe, politically. So web two versus web three is essentially about platform capitalism versus platform socialism. So respectively. So, essentially, I think web two is all about platform capitalism.
00:26:10.122 - 00:26:59.148, Speaker B: Web three should be about web three socialism. And these are two books that I think they're companion pieces that should be purchased to understand what these two concepts mean. But, yeah, I mean, it's already, I think, pretty evident that web two is platform capitalism, because, I mean, every one of these web two companies out there is a platform that has become a SaaS product that just, like, monetizes your data. Right. And that is pretty much the state of web two. And so this leads us to asking the questions of what is Solarpunk's political leaning and what are Solarpunk's geopolitical implications? So, politically and geopolitically, I think Solarpunk is left leaning and then geopolitically, actually, before I touch on that. So that graphic over there summarizes how these other aesthetics fit into the political spectrum.
00:26:59.148 - 00:27:11.980, Speaker B: So we have atom punk, which I actually didn't know about until I was preparing for this conference. But atom punk and Solarpunk are more left leaning, whereas steampunk and cyberpunk are more right leaning. Satan punk.
00:27:12.012 - 00:27:12.984, Speaker C: Like cosmos.
00:27:13.724 - 00:27:14.340, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:27:14.452 - 00:27:16.864, Speaker C: Satan punk. Las Cosmos.
00:27:18.844 - 00:27:56.920, Speaker B: I don't know, maybe. But yeah, so I think it obviously makes sense the cyberpunk is right leaning because it is very much so about propping up companies. Right. And making sure that they're the king and they lead and decide everything. I mean, the idea that a company can become a country, I think, is one of the most fascist concepts you could come up with. Honestly, I actually don't know. Yeah, probably.
00:27:56.920 - 00:28:23.196, Speaker B: Probably. No. Or socialist. And then on the right side is. So it says the horizontal is economic, left versus right. And I would believe that the vertical is more, as you said, like, maybe.
00:28:23.220 - 00:28:28.940, Speaker C: It'S more technological intensity. Funko. More technological and the other.
00:28:29.052 - 00:28:45.280, Speaker B: No, but, yeah, maybe. Maybe that too. Yeah. So how much technology it is. And then maybe it's also about, like, how much, as you said, authoritarian versus, I guess, democratic. Yeah. And then.
00:28:45.280 - 00:29:07.004, Speaker B: Okay, so I'll move on to geopolitics. I think Solarpunk would align itself with the concept of a multipolar world more so than the current unipolar one. So what those concepts mean are, like, right now, the world is. Or the world has been unipolar ever since the end of. Or world War two. The OR. No, ever since the end of the cold war.
00:29:07.004 - 00:29:19.544, Speaker B: Right. Where basically America and the west is like, the leader. They decide everything. They make up all the rules. Us dollar dominance is a concept that exists because of.
00:29:19.584 - 00:29:50.784, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I just wanted to add, I really love in the presentation. I really enjoy every slide. I think in the crypto space, it's very frequent to go away from politics and just find your comfort in technological solutions or economic incentives so you don't have to think about all this shit that is going on and the fact that all the world is going right wing or authoritarian and. Yeah, yeah, I think we should include it in the conversation because all the technological and economic incentivization is good, but, yeah, this is quite crucial.
00:29:51.324 - 00:29:52.356, Speaker B: Agreed. Thank you.
00:29:52.420 - 00:29:54.416, Speaker D: Can I just make the point that.
00:29:54.580 - 00:29:56.280, Speaker B: I feel like what web three is.
00:29:56.312 - 00:30:02.680, Speaker D: Doing is it's not necessarily making it more like left wing, like socialistic.
00:30:02.712 - 00:30:04.324, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. Yeah.
00:30:07.944 - 00:30:24.286, Speaker D: So my observation is maybe that web three is making the world from capitalism in a way, to hyper capitalism, where what that means is today capitalism is only for the people who are well connected and already wealthy. Right.
00:30:24.350 - 00:30:24.994, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:25.294 - 00:30:58.290, Speaker D: In the future, through web three, capitalism is essentially accessible to everyone. So anyone in the world who has a great idea can basically propose it and it might get invested in and it could be the next big thing overnight. Right. And I think, yeah. The reason I believe in web three is because I see it as the ultimate form of capitalism getting rid of the problems as that capitalism has today, which in a way makes it more socialist. Right. Like, the concepts converge, but I guess it's a different way of looking at it.
00:30:58.362 - 00:31:15.992, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I've also heard that argument and I believe that that is fine, too, if it's like, truer to the ideology. But I mean, as you said, if it becomes more accessible to everyone, then it has a potential to become more socialist. Yeah.
00:31:16.048 - 00:31:41.912, Speaker D: Like, maybe it's not an exclusive thing. So what I'm talking about is a world where anyone can propose ideas and anyone can invest in other people's ideas. Maybe that covers a part of the spectrum. Other things is we need public goods, funding and structures, economic incentive structures that make that work, which is more of like a left concept. Yeah, we need both for the Solarpunk world.
00:31:42.008 - 00:32:09.664, Speaker B: Sure. Yes, I can agree with that. Yeah. Shoot. Just wanted to say one final point about the geopolitics side of things is I think it just naturally makes sense that blockchain and stuff fits with multipolarity because of looking at how blockchain became or where we are today. With web three, we have multi chain. So multichain, multipolarity, plurality, then those are concepts that naturally align with one another.
00:32:09.664 - 00:32:34.386, Speaker B: And then. Yeah, so I'll move on. Just two more slides before the activity. I don't know why it's not showing, actually. Okay. Just to address one more thing about. Okay.
00:32:34.386 - 00:33:06.560, Speaker B: Okay. All right, well, I guess I'll very quickly just comment on what you said earlier, Mel. There is also a book that's coming out, though, about how. Well, sorry, the title of the book, I think, is how capitalism ruined blockchain. Sorry, you have the book? Wow. Wait, it's out already? Oh, okay. Okay.
00:33:06.560 - 00:33:30.914, Speaker B: Okay. Sure, sure. Okay, cool. Okay, so, yeah, sorry, two more slides very quickly, I think, you know, Solarpunk is and should be against a one world government. I wrote that because, you know, right now we kind of have a one world government and it's like ruled by the three pillars of America, that which being Silicon Valley, Wall street and Hollywood slash Broadway. But mostly Hollywood. Oh, my gosh, this is awesome.
00:33:30.914 - 00:34:07.032, Speaker B: Yeah. Blockchain radicals, how capitalism ruined. Okay, amazing. Yeah, sweet. Okay, and then why does this all matter? Because I think the west is experiencing late stage capitalism and internationally, inherently, capitalism is imperialistic. And I've touched upon all those things earlier already. So finally, inspired by this guy on Twitter by the name of omniharmonicarmonic, he created these propaganda posters to propagate the concept of Solarpunk.
00:34:07.032 - 00:34:39.783, Speaker B: And so the activity is basically to create solarpunk propaganda because I think we should fight fire with fire. Okay, so I know time is running short. Not sure how to do this, but if. Hmm, well, let's just try to do this as fast as possible. Maybe we only pick one, actually, maybe that's the best way to do this. We pick one of the three activities and we just do it as an entire group. Or we break up into two different groups to do it or something.
00:34:39.783 - 00:34:50.266, Speaker B: Yeah. So let's do a quick vote. Who wants to do which of these three activities? We got the culture one, the politics one, and the circular city one, or the network village one.
00:34:50.450 - 00:34:51.626, Speaker D: I like this one.
00:34:51.730 - 00:35:08.650, Speaker B: You like this one? Okay. All right. Oh, you like this one too? Okay, how about you? All right, let's just. Okay. Okay. Oh, sweet. Okay.
00:35:08.650 - 00:35:17.914, Speaker B: Okay, how about this? Fine, we'll try to. We'll try to break it up. So network village, go over here. Politics, go over here.
00:35:19.094 - 00:35:20.030, Speaker D: You mean that one?
00:35:20.102 - 00:35:36.094, Speaker B: Yeah. Or propaganda. Come here. Solar punk propaganda. And then culture over there. Which one do you want to be? Oh, you're just listening. Okay, come on, participate, people.
00:35:36.094 - 00:35:54.834, Speaker B: This is a workshop. Okay, fine, so you want to be. Which one are you? Politics. Okay, fine, go to him then. He's quite authoritarian, though, so be careful. Yeah, no, not yet. I want to.
00:35:54.834 - 00:35:59.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I did. I created the name. Thank you. Thank you.
00:36:03.014 - 00:36:04.954, Speaker E: Did you bring everyone under the hood?
00:36:05.134 - 00:36:05.866, Speaker B: Under the hood?
00:36:05.930 - 00:36:07.970, Speaker E: Yeah. Is everyone under. Under some hood now?
00:36:08.042 - 00:36:10.250, Speaker B: I don't, I don't know. There's some.
00:36:10.282 - 00:36:12.294, Speaker E: Still some people that. Are you.
00:36:14.474 - 00:36:20.094, Speaker B: What about you? You don't want to participate? Come on, come on.
00:36:22.954 - 00:36:26.066, Speaker E: Everyone has a. Everyone has an opinion about politics?
00:36:26.130 - 00:36:38.206, Speaker B: Yeah. Yes. Yeah, for sure. Well, if you scan this QR code, you're going to see all the slides, basically, and then. Oh, sorry. No, no, the slides to this activity. Sorry.
00:36:38.206 - 00:36:56.592, Speaker B: This QR code will be for this activity, so. Yes, but I will come to each of you as well. Okay, so I guess we only got the two activities of network village and politics. Hello. You're new. Do you want to join a group? Right now, quickly. Okay, so, well, so there's two activities happening.
00:36:56.592 - 00:37:09.740, Speaker B: Two activities. One is about propaganda. One is about network villages. So network villages is about, like, how do we basically create circular cities with, like, web three, basically. Which one sounds more interesting from us?
00:37:09.772 - 00:37:11.292, Speaker D: You're expecting a poster?
00:37:11.428 - 00:37:14.516, Speaker B: Sure. A poster is fine. Yes. Even just one poster?
00:37:14.580 - 00:37:16.424, Speaker D: Yeah, maybe we can generate.
00:37:19.844 - 00:37:36.520, Speaker B: Yeah. So you can join this. Yes. Okay. Okay. Let me, let me summarize this one. So this one is, well, given the time that we don't have, but I'll read it anyway.
00:37:36.520 - 00:38:01.072, Speaker B: So if you're a political candidate for your country, what would your silicone pitch be? Create the propaganda posters or headlines. If you were a United nations representative, what would your silicone pitch be? Let's create a decentralized propaganda ministry and call it propaganda dao. So as to propagate Solarpunk messaging like the following, courtesy of omni harmonic tactics. Use some of these tactics like bashing bandwagon and bombastic. So what are they bashing? Like, you can bash your opponents. Bandwagon. Join us.
00:38:01.072 - 00:38:11.320, Speaker B: Join us. Don't join them. Bombastic. Be. Be loud and be like, what is it? Like? Sensationalist. And then inspiration. Focus your messaging on either of the following.
00:38:11.320 - 00:38:32.230, Speaker B: How we live, work and play, our relationship with each other. Machinery and nature. Fud sells. Let's create Fud about cyberpunk. Fud is fear, uncertainty, adult. Maybe a good headline to inspire you is make earth great again. And then last but not least, let's be manipulative and persuasive.
00:38:32.230 - 00:38:46.020, Speaker B: Be rhetorical and personal, inclusive and emotive. Language and tricolon. Tricolon just basically means use the power of three. Like, I've been using three a lot. Right. I have three activities, three this, three that. So use the power of three.
00:38:46.020 - 00:38:58.332, Speaker B: The magic number three. And, yeah, so this is inspiration. You could google this guy or Twitter this guy, omniharmonic. He's created these posters already. Like, capitalism is a death coat. That's so bombastic. That sounds scary.
00:38:58.332 - 00:39:31.854, Speaker B: Become a disciple of the living earth and so on and so forth. So this is inspiration for coming up with, given that we don't have much time, if you could just create one awesome poster, that would be great. Or even, like, several headlines. Yeah. And then on your side, I'll go back. So, yeah, this is. Yeah.
00:39:31.854 - 00:39:41.342, Speaker B: Yes, yes, you got it? Great. Thank you. Yes, I got it. I got it. Yeah, great. Wonderful. So, yeah, you could just pick a.
00:39:41.342 - 00:39:47.414, Speaker B: Let's go. Oh, okay. More people. Hello. Welcome, welcome. So you missed. This was not a talk.
00:39:47.414 - 00:39:55.878, Speaker B: This was a workshop and you just came at the time where we were doing the activity. So wait, you're new. Come over here.
00:39:55.886 - 00:39:56.750, Speaker E: You have a few ideas.
00:39:56.782 - 00:40:12.850, Speaker B: Come on, don't be scared. I don't bite. So there are three activities. Right now, there's two groups working on one of the, like, two of the different activities. Excellent. One of the activities about culture, one of them is about politics, which those guys are working on. One of them.
00:40:12.850 - 00:40:27.414, Speaker B: And then the third one is about network villages, which those guys are working on. So what do they mean? I wish you were here earlier. I explained what they are. But basically the culture one is how do we tell Solarpunk stories?
00:40:27.574 - 00:40:39.414, Speaker E: Elaborate on those points so we could write down just a few aspects about cooperation, competition in interdependence and circulation, basically.
00:40:39.534 - 00:40:42.174, Speaker B: Living in harmony with points.
00:40:42.214 - 00:40:45.006, Speaker E: For example, especially cities are competing about.
00:40:45.110 - 00:40:47.758, Speaker B: So we do have solar punk already within the world of web three.
00:40:47.846 - 00:41:10.666, Speaker E: Let's keep our focus to one city. Let's just think out of this perspective of one city, not other cities can also do. Right now, we are trying to solve the following problems. Like, how can we make maybe cooperation and competition a little bit more transparent? And that also means, I also mean the competition within our city.
00:41:10.850 - 00:41:13.770, Speaker B: The first one is about storytelling. How do we green pill the audience?
00:41:13.922 - 00:41:32.918, Speaker E: You know, what Greenpelling, which department gets how much money are we investing more into our clean water systems or into our energy supply? Basically, because I know, because I work for the city of Munich, by the way, as an IT consultant. I know there's also like, just a.
00:41:32.926 - 00:41:40.994, Speaker B: Lot of, like, anti crypto news out there, right? So, like, nobody. Like, for example.
00:42:06.514 - 00:42:07.130, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:42:07.202 - 00:42:32.264, Speaker B: Thank you. Yes. Okay. Okay. So we're gonna present very shortly. Feel free to write still while I'm talking. But I just wanted to my last slide.
00:42:32.264 - 00:43:13.256, Speaker B: So how does all of the stuff that I've presented about relate to my work, or how does the workshop relate to my work? Well, as I mentioned, I'm working on something called cerconomy. That's just like a side refi project that I'm doing. And what cerconomy is, is we're building a platform enabling the creation of network villages and a network village. Best way that I've been able to sum it up is it's a web three based circular city framework. And then in parallel, we're also trying to build a learn to earn platform for circular economy web three projects. And then last but not least, is this product that I call fine, it's a product to unify the Refi world or refi project. And.
00:43:13.256 - 00:43:46.482, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's just a summary of how my work is related to the workshop. Okay, so we're coming close to the end of this workshop, so I'm gonna have the team politics or team propaganda, or team propaganda come make their presentation once they're. Are you ready yet? Okay. Okay. All right, we'll give you. Wonderful. Thank you.
00:43:46.482 - 00:44:09.494, Speaker B: Oh, yes. No, wait, wait. Are you ready to present anything? Something. It's okay. It doesn't have to be perfect. Why don't you just present first? Yeah, yeah, come on. Did you.
00:44:09.494 - 00:44:21.314, Speaker B: If you didn't, maybe we could just. Are you cool with, like, Camille's idea? Okay, fine. Okay. Given that we don't have much time, we just have a presenter idea.
00:44:22.534 - 00:45:09.234, Speaker A: I have way too many. I've seen conference t shirts and a just. I would really like to create better outfits from this conference waste and wear them to the conferences or around because I know the clothes I wear are becoming more valuable as I wear them and then have the articles of clothing represented on a blockchain in my closet or the articles of clothing in my closet represented on a blockchain. So my girlfriends can. And I can sort of trade the tokens, but also trade the physical clothes because that's valuable to me.
00:45:10.334 - 00:45:15.794, Speaker B: Wonderful. Awesome. So basically, circular fashion powered by web three.
00:45:18.694 - 00:45:27.064, Speaker A: If you shimmy in the clothes, it makes them more valuable. Your energy, your skin follicles.
00:45:29.564 - 00:45:43.704, Speaker B: Proof of dance. Shimmy. Wonderful. Okay, wonderful. That's great. All right. Team propaganda.
00:45:43.704 - 00:46:16.904, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, sure. Please bring your computer up here for those who were not here for my workshop. So the ones that just trickled in for the next person. Are you curious to know what you missed out on? Yeah. No, this guy with the mustache. Really? How dare you? Oh, uh, you can just plug it in. It'll be easier.
00:46:16.904 - 00:46:48.876, Speaker B: Yeah, come on. Come on up. Okay, so for those who missed my workshop, it's all about how we can create Solarpunk 2077 starting today using a combination of culture, politics and circular economics. Team over here is going to present their political. Okay, come on. Yeah, come on, come on, come on, come on. They're gonna present their propaganda poster that is all about supporting the Solarpunk vision.
00:46:48.876 - 00:46:59.344, Speaker B: All right, yeah, sorry. Oh, yeah, just unplug there. And you could just unplug and you could just stick it on top. You could just place your computer on top.
00:47:06.624 - 00:47:42.944, Speaker D: So we want to make earth green again. We are the solar punk dao. And if you get. If you vote on us, you will get a token and you can vote directly on the issues that we are voting on in the political system. And we think that we are about to enter regularity, as Chen already said. And the amazing thing about that is that technology will enable us to move all industry off earth. And at the end of this century, we think that the Solarpunk world is a world where our world is.
00:47:42.944 - 00:48:10.020, Speaker D: Nature has been restored, and cities are these almost museums where just people live. And all industry is on the moon or in low Earth orbit or wherever else. And if you vote for Solarpunkdao, we will make that happen altogether. And we will all own this future together. So join us. Make Earth green again. Well done.
00:48:10.020 - 00:48:13.420, Speaker D: Our team. We're gonna win together.
00:48:13.572 - 00:48:26.984, Speaker B: Yeah. Woo. Thank you, Mel. Thank you, Mel. But I just have to do with my trump voice. Make Earth green again. Thank you.
00:48:26.984 - 00:48:51.104, Speaker B: This will be the greatest and best dao the world has ever seen. Trust me. Okay. All right. Thank you all for your time and for your participation. Okay, I will let Camille introduce the next person, I guess.
00:49:04.904 - 00:49:05.924, Speaker C: Yeah, you can.
00:49:14.304 - 00:49:22.344, Speaker A: Hello, it's me again, Camille. You're in the Institute of crypto Anarchy. This is Philippe. Please welcome him.
00:49:50.824 - 00:49:51.844, Speaker D: It works.
00:49:53.064 - 00:49:53.704, Speaker B: One, two, three.
