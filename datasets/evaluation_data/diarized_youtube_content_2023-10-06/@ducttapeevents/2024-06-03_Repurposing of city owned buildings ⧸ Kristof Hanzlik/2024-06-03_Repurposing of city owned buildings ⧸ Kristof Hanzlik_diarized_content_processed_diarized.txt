00:00:09.720 - 00:00:37.614, Speaker A: And we're back for more infrastructure. This time, repurposing of city owned buildings with Christoph Henslich. Welcome on stage and let's discover this topic. Hello, everybody. This is working. Cool. My presentation will not be as polished as the one you've seen before.
00:00:37.614 - 00:01:29.214, Speaker A: It's beautiful. It was beautiful, and I completely admire what the ladies do here. I will be touching a similar topic, though it might be a little more abstract and on the other hand, a little more like real at the same time. I want to describe a project we started in the year 2016. So it's like eight years ago. You might have heard 20 minutes ago about the lengths of processes that happen in Czech Republic or in Prague especially. So the project is, it's called campus Hibernska.
00:01:29.214 - 00:02:31.764, Speaker A: It's in the very center of Prague. And we managed to create 8000 meters square meters of public space out of, let's say, thin air, out of nothing. And if you had some time, if you haven't been yet, being from Prague or Czech Republic, or if you have some time this weekend, I strongly recommend going there. This is the website, obviously without the gibberish on it, but what you can find there is lecture halls, cafes, cinemas, stuff rainwater flushed public toilets, the first ones. And it is in the very center. So over there you see one of the gates to the old town. This is the Czech National bank, obviously on purpose, because it's kind of connecting to this topic here.
00:02:31.764 - 00:03:04.678, Speaker A: And this is it. Basically six buildings kind of stuck to each other in the very heart of the city. So who are we? Architect? Yes. Nobody really knows what we do. We don't either, but we try to pretend. You see the naked girl on the picture there. We don't really build buildings.
00:03:04.678 - 00:03:56.822, Speaker A: We come up with ideas and speculate. And sometimes I try to compare it with us, with doctors, because people can relate to doctors, not to architects. And we approach city or buildings as the doctors, the human body. We are not afraid of cutting in. And obviously, as long as it's standing, as long as the patient is ambulant, we say it's a success. And you might have noticed our office is called colcol, like collaborative collective. So collaboration is a very important topic in the sense in architecture especially.
00:03:56.822 - 00:04:47.706, Speaker A: And I would say it would be the very same in the IoT business. Basically, you need to be prepared to step over borders of your industry. You need to be able to understand that there is a semantic gap between. People use the same words, but sometimes they don't really understand what they are talking about. I said eight years ago, eight years ago, there was a big topic, smart city. Iot everything running. And we said, smart city is not about smart benches.
00:04:47.706 - 00:05:39.944, Speaker A: There's all respect to the very person who managed to place anything in the public space. As lady said just before me, it takes years and an incredible amount of energy to actually change something in public space. But what do we say? We don't care about smart benches. The smart city is about smart people. And year 2016, the time in it flows exponentially. The time in building business does not. And we are talking about extraneous bodies.
00:05:39.944 - 00:06:27.974, Speaker A: The city, on one hand, is very physical, the same as buildings are. On the other hand, the city is very abstract. It's an interplay of many players, many buddies who have different relationships and stuff. Now, the example of campus Hibernska is actually two bodies guessing together. After about 650 years of living in the same flat. The city and the university, one of the oldest universities in Europe, being based in Prague for 650 years, has never ever had an official relationship to the city. The university was founded by the king.
00:06:27.974 - 00:07:04.552, Speaker A: The city has its own governance. The city takes care of gymnasiums, high schools and stuff. University is governed by state. They don't meet, they go like this, and they don't even like talk. They have no place to talk together, but there are different opportunities. So this is the building with all the stars. Just behind me is the gate to the old town.
00:07:04.552 - 00:08:01.044, Speaker A: That's the national bank everybody should be interested in. Yes. So it's just there. And as I shown the bench, it was a time, 2016 was a time when you might have all opinions about the politicians who were back then in power, but they were actually single people. For example, Rudbiskova, who managed to convince the politicians to talk to universities. Those 650 years of gap being crossed closed. Some people obviously refused to get out of their gaps.
00:08:01.044 - 00:08:46.092, Speaker A: Some people were, for example, the faculty of arts back then, led by the first woman dean in those 650 years, was where. So the faculty was able to actually look out, look ahead and take a chance, taking chances, very important. Okay, so how do people approach buildings? So they say, okay, we want to collaborate. Yes, we want to work together. Dear City, we are based in the very center. We have no space. Maybe you have some buildings, maybe you have some space you could give us.
00:08:46.092 - 00:09:16.724, Speaker A: Not very simple to give, just like that, public space to someone. Legal problems. But the city does not have empty spaces. And if they have empty spaces, they look like this, you know, it's 8000 space, cuts away from power, from heat, from water, from anything. And okay. On one hand it was empty. On the other hand, it was full of pigeons.
00:09:16.724 - 00:09:52.234, Speaker A: And in czech spot, it's the guys with machine guns running around were actually playing there, or headed as a playground. So you see those, it's bullets. It's like paintball, but with proper bullets, proper guns. It was funny. You could find tons of these brass bullets, but no spots on the walls. They don't miss. They always, like, hit the.
00:09:52.234 - 00:10:29.714, Speaker A: So for many people, completely dead end. You know, you can't. Oh, I'm not going there. It's full of pigeons and stuff. But then it's architects you need. Because we are trained to think speculatively. Yes, we might seem to be informed, but still we are naive, and we look out and we have the freedom to ask silly questions.
00:10:29.714 - 00:11:23.204, Speaker A: Silly questions. Very important, because all our work is in the future, and all we do is we put different people, different industries together to achieve something. This is basically describing the state of affairs in Czech Republic, worse than Cameroon. Basically, this is what we have to work with to get a building permit. It's about two years time, and the windows of opportunities are very short, open only for very short. We are from Prague. I live in mastrana, so all my childhood was about Neruda, but this time it's not Jano Neruda, but Pablo Neruda.
00:11:23.204 - 00:12:16.974, Speaker A: Some people might know. It's a chilean poet, and in one of his poems was a thing he described as a mold principle, because mold is the time when death comes back to life. When you have the rotten apple, it's actually blooming with life again. Died, but now it's coming in, looking around or other places, you can throw a party of your lifetime on a field somewhere. So sometimes you don't need to have everything polished and beautiful to actually start something. Obviously, he saw this opportunity, so we had to start now. But now meant 2016.
00:12:16.974 - 00:12:43.694, Speaker A: And if your general projects take ten years, so you look in 2026, and how will the world look like in 2026? So you don't know. We are almost there. Not yet. Two more years. So you look ten years back, and you said, ah, it was the iPhone. One man. The world has changed in ten years between this.
00:12:43.694 - 00:13:23.606, Speaker A: So we did not really know how to start a project. Whom are we designing it for? If we said, we are designing it for the future of ten years, the urge was there. We had to start the project now. Okay, where am I? Yes. And you need some determination because you have generally no budget. If you don't have an institution, you don't have money. If you think of a future institution, basically.
00:13:23.606 - 00:14:06.894, Speaker A: Sometimes you have to start and clean out the pigeon shit. And obviously the determination of the dean of the Faculty of Arts back then, she found 500,000 crowns, 20,000 euro to clean out the first two or three spaces. Cafe, kids corner and a pub or concert hall. And then you talked. But you need to know how to talk to the city. And the philosophers in the Faculty of Arts don't really, but we do, because we do stuff in public space a little bit. First month, you can get almost anything from the city for free.
00:14:06.894 - 00:14:41.612, Speaker A: Obviously, if you're not running a commercial business, almost instantly, not really difficult. You ask and they give it to you. No politicians involved. After that, you can prolong it for five more months, maybe six, but I was not sure. Still no politicians involved. And unless you can't earn no money there, so you have six months. Keys from a building or from space that's empty.
00:14:41.612 - 00:15:24.196, Speaker A: It's pretty good. Within those six months of 2016, there was about 200 events that happened, placed, were documented, and in the very end printed out in a book of this, like this, thick. And obviously, if the one leg you're standing on is the city, it's all fine. The other leg you're standing on is the university. The city is politicians, the university is academia. The politicians need to be elected again. Obviously the only one, and I mean, they don't want to deal with is the students.
00:15:24.196 - 00:16:05.586, Speaker A: So because the students, you know, they all do. They do all the crazy things we don't understand, but we love them. It's our future. So suddenly the momentum of things that were happening the whole summer and stuff in campus Hibernska, empty space was so big that there comes the first lease. And obviously, you know, the city is getting involved, it can't look that bad. So first million of crowns is like €40,000. Obviously not an investor, not refurbishing, just maintenance.
00:16:05.586 - 00:16:38.724, Speaker A: It's a different budget. We have budget for maintenance and money for investment. Very difficult. Four years later, totalling of 80 million crowns. That's about €3 million. We had 8000. Infrastructural, very simple, but usable space, heating, electricity.
00:16:38.724 - 00:17:28.290, Speaker A: In every room there was a light bulb. Obviously some rooms nicer than others, but usable. The general square meter renovation in Czech Republic is 50,000. We managed to spend like €400 per square meter. And what we got a courtyard, living courtyard with a cafe in the very, very center of Prague. Like cinema, co working space, two galleries again, rainwater flush, public toilet is raining outside, so it's good news, six minutes. But it's a cool party place, all sorts of things.
00:17:28.290 - 00:17:53.794, Speaker A: Interesting program is happening there. But there is another principle behind it, you know, University of 14th century. The only accessible part of a university in 14th century, when the Charles University was founded, was the gate, you know, behind that. Oh, no, no, no. Knowledge is power. You're not allowed. 19th century, that was getting better.
00:17:53.794 - 00:18:41.994, Speaker A: It was the lecture halls that you could actually enter for public, but nothing else. And we tried to convert it. So the university for 21st century is not about elected students, it's not only about researchers, but it's about public space. And the role of university is to educate people, people of all ages, genders and everything. It tries to minimize the closed space. So it is an infrastructural space, like streets, roads, switch, for example, that the city owns and supports. But it's the university who curates this space.
00:18:41.994 - 00:19:17.742, Speaker A: Yes. Curated public space, obviously. It's all sorts of beautiful ideas. It's good to have university on your side because nobody really tries to discuss things with university because the power of university. Show me another institution in this era that has such a long history and track record of being the one. Okay, little more pictures. Toilets.
00:19:17.742 - 00:19:41.034, Speaker A: Yes. Rainwater, flush toilets. I love them. And where are you going? Yes, so after. I'm missing the logos. Interesting. After 650 years, the university actually started talking to the city and the city to university.
00:19:41.034 - 00:20:34.494, Speaker A: Five years after 2016, these two extraneous buddies managed to found a common legal body, whatever that means. But now they have a company legal body that they can support again legally. And it runs. Yes. To conclude the lecture, this is Ibrinska number four, the one I was talking about. But then this is the Czech National bank. Yes, we are here at the sort of fintech event I'm looking at, the Hibernika number two.
00:20:34.494 - 00:21:05.254, Speaker A: It's a very similar story. The house is empty and for last two months, I think it belongs to the city. So maybe someone in the audience might have an idea what to do in an empty building right next to the Czech National bank. I'm just trying to direct your thoughts. And as I've said, we are architects. We build buildings. I'm missing pictures there.
00:21:05.254 - 00:21:34.154, Speaker A: Again, I wanted to show you some real stuff we do well, you can go to Colcocc. We build buildings sometimes, but sometimes we work on a more in a very abstract level to convince the multiple players in public space we work with. So this should be it. If anyone had any questions.
