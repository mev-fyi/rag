00:00:00.650 - 00:01:04.626, Speaker A: All right, so we have the order flow panel now starting. I don't want to share too much information or get two people too excited. So for this panel, I think we have a really exciting set of individuals on here. I think last time I wrote a dashboard that I looked at, a dashboard that said, okay, where do all the transactions on Ethereum look like? There was about a good chunk of it came from Uniswap. Another good chunk of it came from MetaMask, a good chunk of it came from Cal Swap. And I think all encompassing, including One Inch, we covered about, like, 95% of all the transaction flow that hits Ethereum. And so I'm really excited that today we have all of the culprits for that order flow here on the panel together, and we can grill them a little bit.
00:01:04.626 - 00:01:08.900, Speaker A: So I'll hand out this mic, everyone can grab a mic, and then we can get started.
00:01:17.850 - 00:01:19.430, Speaker B: We just doing intros.
00:01:20.570 - 00:02:31.990, Speaker A: No, I'll do the intro for you. So I think it'll be faster that way. So we have Robert, who's head of Product over at Flashbots DDA, who's working over at the Consensus, looking at across all the different product suites that they have. We have Anton from one inch, Felix from Calswap and mevblocker and Teo from Uniswap. So I sort of primed this by saying these guys have a lot of the activity that ends up hitting Ethereum. I think one of the questions that we've been asking and talking about regarding order flow over the course of the last year has been sort of ringing the drum, or hitting the drum about the dangers of exclusive order flow. And I think one of the things that I want to bring up and sort of have as a starting point for conversation is the fact that basically every single participant on this panel now has some kind of private order flow solution where they're exclusively routing order flow to a subset of market participants as opposed to routing it to the public transaction pool.
00:02:31.990 - 00:03:10.490, Speaker A: And I think a lot of this is often done under the guise of protecting the users. So what I want to start with is the question of how much of this is protecting the users versus creating some systemic risk to the ecosystem. How do you make the decision of should you route privately or should it be routed publicly? Let's start that as a discussion point. I will say I really want the entire group to be involved here. I want to move sort of directly into Q A questions. And so I will let the conversation flow fluidly. I'll only jump in and add additional conversation when it dies down.
00:03:10.490 - 00:03:20.440, Speaker A: So, yeah, without further ado, how would you tackle that question? No one no, wait, I can go.
00:03:21.770 - 00:04:32.014, Speaker B: You framed the question as how much of it is protecting the users versus creating systemic risk? And it's sort of an or A or B but I think it's A and B to be frank. I think it is clear that there are reasons why you would route your transaction flow, your intent flow or whatever form it takes to a private mempool. Culprit number one here with Flashpots Protect, you don't want to be front run in the public mempool, maybe you get an mev kickback something like this or best execution. And at the same time I think the nuance is that we need to provide these solutions with a clear path to how we can make them more permissionless and not rely on any set of entrenched actors like you're saying. And I think if we can get to that place, the risk that is systemic becomes much less and that's why for all of Flushbot's products we try to make them permissionless for all market actors. And I think that that was a small other nuance as a part of the intro that you gave. So users can choose where they send their order flow when they use Flashbots Protect, what builders you send to and any of the order flow that goes through our mevshare node is permissionless to search on for anyone in the world as well.
00:04:32.014 - 00:04:43.700, Speaker B: So I think it's A and B, we do want to protect users, we want to give them these benefits. I think private mempools are going to come up and we still want to address that long term systemic risk as well.
00:04:44.950 - 00:05:53.186, Speaker C: I think the systemic risk more so than the private mempool is actually the mev prone application design that we developed and use on chain today. And uniswap is just one of the biggest examples here, where x times y equals k is a great mechanism for price discovery for long tail tokens has a bunch of really cool advantages, but also comes with a drawback that it's substantially prone to front running and ordering attacks. And basically, well, we think that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, but these drawbacks need to be addressed on some level as well. Right? And so that's where the private memcoo comes in. It's not a solution that we see as the long term way to handle mev on Ethereum, we think we need better dex designs, we need better swap mechanisms that are not substantially prone to these type of attacks. But until we get there and until we can convince all the people, not just in this room, but in the community that they shouldn't be using the public mempool with kind of mev flawed designs. We need easy to use, easy to understand, easy to adopt solutions.
00:05:53.186 - 00:06:07.600, Speaker C: And I think that's where Map locker. That's where also now with uniswap X one intrusion, cowswap, of course, comes in as an attempt to cover up some of the mechanism flaws that we've developed over the last years.
00:06:08.530 - 00:06:56.000, Speaker D: Yeah, I think there's a massive timing question in all of this. The way you were protecting users over the past year is not the way you're going to protect user this coming year or even three years or five years from now. So I think it's about being practical. There's an end state that we all wish for, but on the path from here to this end state, there will be different iterations today, actually, we can say the space, even mev supply chain space is very early, right? Like there's so many innovations in all sorts of directions. And I think as a wallet, for example, you would want to leverage all those innovations while being quite practical about it in the short term so that you get the best outcome for the user. But we also work towards the end state.
00:06:57.570 - 00:09:04.210, Speaker E: I would say that it's very interesting how we saw that since Arbitrage opportunities really created in 2016 2017, we saw a huge evolution of order flow. And initially we thought that protocols should protect users, traders from this mev. But from what we can see now that it's not possible to be solved on protocol level, I mean, there is no any way that all those DEXs protocols would include kind of protection from this. We should wait until Ethereum or any other chain layer one consensus will change and process mem pool differently, protected somehow from front runs, back runs, and anything or we also can see that evolution ended up that three major platforms, like One Inch, Cowswap, Uniswap, they changed their mind recently, they changed the order flow. So all those platforms decided that it's not possible that every user will protect itself because users use different software, different wallets, different DApps, and it's so hard for them to protect themselves. And it's much easier to put this order flow on professional fillers as uniswap call them, resolvers as One Inch call them, or solvers as Cowswap call them. So it's much less participants, like tens or hundreds of participants who are professional and can protect users from all these risks.
00:09:04.210 - 00:09:12.954, Speaker E: And now we're here. But I believe that we will probably see any kind of protection on consensus on layer one.
00:09:12.992 - 00:09:53.320, Speaker F: Layer I'll just add to that that I think it's important to have a degree of perspective here as well. Right? Ultimately all these systems are still noncustodial all trades set on chain. There's not that much that can really go wrong by hosting sort of order dissemination infrastructure off chain. Sure, I think it's important to have a roadmap to a slightly more decentralized state, but of all the mechanisms within the order stack to have slightly more centralized, I think yeah, order dissemination is probably okay for now.
00:09:54.090 - 00:10:57.226, Speaker A: Maybe a question for the room. So I think a lot of the trends that we're seeing is pulling some of this execution logic from on chain to being off chain, relying on some counterparties to do this execution, do the validation, and sort of have like pre inclusion guarantees. The struggle there is that it involves some level of trust. You need to have some relationship with these counterparties to make sure that they're operating in a way that's in line with sort of your expectations. And I think a lot of the questions that you guys are spending time on is how do we make sure that these counterparties are behaving in the way that we expect them to behave? So I have maybe like a two sided question. On the one hand, I want to hear sort of from the room. When you hear about this design problem, what do you think are the key concerns in both having sort of these aggregators of order flow, be policing? Who the counterparties are allowed to participate in their game are what sort of comes to mind as some issues in designing systems in this way.
00:10:57.226 - 00:11:14.160, Speaker A: And then also for you guys, the question and I want to lead into is how do you go about identifying these counterparties and making sure that they're sort of behaving within the parameters of your protocol? I saw one hand over there, let's see if we can toss the mic to him.
00:11:15.410 - 00:12:01.054, Speaker G: So the first concern that comes to my mind, because I'm a lawyer, is that when you have those centralized or semi centralized intermediaries, they look like intermediaries. Also under, for example, Eomica, and they may be classified as, for example, service providers who provide reception transmission of orders, or service providers that provide execution of orders. And there is a lot of requirements, basically you have to become a financial institution almost to provide that. Right? And you may hope, oh yeah, I will do reverse solicitation to the EU. No you won't. It's an exception, it's not going to work. I think this is an underappreciated problem for going this way.
00:12:01.054 - 00:12:47.760, Speaker G: Right? So if you go away from decentralization but of course there are concerns there that can be addressed and there are conversations with regulators that can be had successfully, I think. But for that you need answers to how do I benchmark best execution, for example, right, if you want to compare yourself, I'm better than TradFi or I'm safe, I'm trusted. So you need to have answers. Okay, so best execution and then the question is so is best execution, can it be best execution on cowswap, best execution on one inch, or best execution across all DeFi? Or do you benchmark yourself against binance? Right, so I don't think anyone has a legal answer to that, but these are the sort of questions that you will need answers for and quite quickly.
00:12:50.690 - 00:12:51.440, Speaker C: But.
00:12:53.650 - 00:13:02.994, Speaker A: Any response to that, the regulatory front of the concerns I introduces, any regulators in the room, put your hand.
00:13:03.032 - 00:13:05.620, Speaker F: Up defer to our legal team.
00:13:07.750 - 00:13:28.598, Speaker A: So, I mean, one question that this does bring up is the idea of best execution and how do you guarantee that? One way to constrain what the counterparties can do is to say you need to beat a certain threshold. So what's the right way to sort of define actually what's the best execution that you need to be able to beat? Everyone has sort of this problem when they're initiating transactions.
00:13:28.774 - 00:13:47.790, Speaker E: I believe Uniswap X would agree that Dutch auction is probably one of the key solutions to the best execution because it's like arbitrage traders competition would make it better for the user.
00:13:49.170 - 00:13:51.120, Speaker F: Yeah, I would agree then.
00:13:53.190 - 00:13:59.090, Speaker D: Is that true even in highly volatile conditions or for long tail tokens?
00:14:00.090 - 00:14:53.958, Speaker F: Yeah, I think it's all relative. Right. But the important part is creating this competitive environment on an order by order basis. But I agree with the member of the audience here, which is that defining best execution in crypto markets is really this non trivial problem. Right? Because you do have these synchronicity issues between blockchain based markets and centralized exchanges. Not everybody has access to the same flow. The way that we sort of think about best execution in the context of Uniswap X or execution that we're happy with is using a combination of uniswap v two and uniswap v three as a benchmark, right? And we try and give swappers users some price improvement over that benchmark and then we guarantee that sort of the lowest price that they're going to get.
00:14:53.958 - 00:15:00.600, Speaker F: The ending price of the auction will be the uniswap v two v three aggregate price.
00:15:02.410 - 00:15:04.042, Speaker B: You talked about giving users the best.
00:15:04.096 - 00:15:06.534, Speaker C: Value for their transactions on a one on one basis.
00:15:06.582 - 00:15:07.878, Speaker A: How do you deal with value that's.
00:15:07.894 - 00:15:18.108, Speaker C: Not 1000 transactions have value, but that.
00:15:18.114 - 00:15:39.584, Speaker D: Is solved by I mean it's one of the problem that ofas are meant to be solving if you direct folder flow to them. But obviously it's early and not everyone is able to capture that value. But you can expect that that would be a natural evolution of the system to capture that correlative value of transactions.
00:15:39.712 - 00:16:51.948, Speaker C: I mean, I think actually this is part of the answer to Stefan's question that sparked this discussion is how do you ensure trust? And I think the repetitive nature of your interactions as a protocol like cowswap or mevblocker or one ensure uniswap is that you have these repetitive interactions. And for example, on mevblocker we can talk about how we build trust with the block builders that we route our traffic towards and it's by assuming good intent, monitoring them, observing them, and then when they misbehave, they get cut off from the order flow and will have to pay a penalty to get relisted. And the demand from builders that get cut off from that order flow is huge. Like the value of the 5% of transaction volume that mapblocker is processing is very large. And so that repetitive value to me can be used to assume or ensure some of the trust that we talked about first just from the COSWE perspective. Want to just also talk about best price here because I think we take quite a different approach to one inch fusion and Uniswap X in that we don't want to upper bound the value of the best price that a user can get. Basically, if there is a price swing block to block that goes beyond your uniswap or your one inch fusion Dutch curve, we still want solvers to bid that price.
00:16:51.948 - 00:17:34.740, Speaker C: And there's no kind of limited upside for the user what the best price can be. On the downside, what we enforce is what we call Ebbo Ethereum best bid and offer. It's similar to the NBBO on lit exchanges. We basically look at the well known baseline liquidity accounting, uniswap balancer SushiSwap which are probably also at curve at this stage. But basically what is the price that you would have been getting on the lit AMMS? That is kind of the baseline but then the sky is the limit. If a solver can improve prices by more than the curve dictates then by all means they should get priority to access your flow and all that value should flow back to the user.
00:17:34.900 - 00:18:22.616, Speaker A: Aren't we sort of shooting ourselves in the foot with this concept of Ebbo? Right? On the previous panel we talked about how LPs are just losing a ton of money to LVR and toxic flow and they always have sort of outdated prices. But then we're also benchmarking what good quality price execution is based off of all of these LPs in these pools. So we're almost saying okay, here market makers, you can come in and join this system and provide some liquidity. The benchmark that you have to beat is all these uninformed traders are providing liquidity in this open market they're sending toxic flow towards already. How does this sort of make sure that the users have the best price? If you're relying both on the market maker for setting the price and for improving it upon that set price right.
00:18:22.638 - 00:18:51.484, Speaker C: So it's a lower bound. Right. It's actually the second line of defense that the user has when they trade on cowswap. The first line of defense, which is always guaranteed is the limit price that you put in your order. Second line of defense is Ebbo getting the best price that is visible on chain which of course is maybe not the absolute best price that can be achieved. But looking at traditional finance, NBBO is also not the greatest price you can achieve. Dark pools usually give you better price wholesalers can give you better price execution than what you can find on the lid exchanges.
00:18:51.484 - 00:19:37.056, Speaker C: Yet it is what defines price improvement, what defines kind of if you do worse than that then it's a pretty clear sign something is off. And the real the holy grail of what is the best price is the off chain competition. And basically sure there's centralized aspects of to it now, but at the end of the day how I see the centralized or this decentralized competition is just a consensus for data availability. What were the bids in the auction that were proposed by a certain point in time that was enough to be considered valid for the competition. And if there's consensus around that, it's very clear which solver in a way had the right to execute. And if they misbehave, then well in Kausov's case there's a bond that can be slashed. I think there's different protocols, have different models on how to enforce that trust.
00:19:37.056 - 00:19:51.140, Speaker C: But to me that is the unlimited upside for the user best price off chain guarantee with some more layers of defense on chain seems like given the current status quo a good solution.
00:19:51.900 - 00:20:50.024, Speaker E: I would agree on that. But there is one thing which is really hard to compare. Since more than one orders are being budgeted together with each other, it's hard to compare which of proposals of solvers is better. For example, if we have two or three users orders which solver going to fill in one transaction, we can't compare them directly because it's not one number, it's three number, it's three different prices which each of the user would get. And I'm not sure if there is any kind of truly sustainable and decentralized solution to find which offer is better. Like it could give better rate for one user or for other user and we can be sure that one of these users is not related to this solver also. So it's hard problem, right?
00:20:50.062 - 00:21:37.480, Speaker C: I think I'm not an economist actually economist was on the panel before. But just in economic theory there's this concept of equilibrium prices in a perfect economy where demand and supply matches. And what we are talking about in Kowswap with multi dimensional batch auctions we're looking at a barter economy. And so the Holy grail of what an optimal solution would look like is a competitive equilibrium or I think Rajan equilibrium, how it's called sometimes as well. The reality of the mechanism today is that we are trying to approximate this by maximizing surplus which has the drawbacks that you mentioned and we're actively working on finding ways to approximate these equilibriums in more exact ways. But yeah, I mean that is an ongoing challenge.
00:21:38.140 - 00:22:38.540, Speaker B: So I think in general I agree that all of the sort of metrics that we've talked about are flawed in some way and the best that we can do is try to have a maximally competitive market. And I think what stance that we've taken, the approach that we've taken with Flashbots Protect with mev Share has been having permissionless execution against users flow. So anyone in the world can go to Mev Share, flashpots net, go and look at the transactions that are coming through Flashpots Protect, see them, try to search behind them and we think that this permissionless kind of execution on users transactions is going to maximize competition in the long run and give users the best price. What we're really trying to build towards also and what I think the Holy grail here is, is having some sort of crypto and economic guarantee for any given trade that you can point to that says the user here got the absolute best price possible. I think that kind of guarantee is what is going to make crypto stand out from traditional finance. And that kind of guarantee is, I think, how we win in the long term.
00:22:39.120 - 00:22:42.556, Speaker A: So you need to have a proof of best execution or a proof of.
00:22:42.578 - 00:22:44.556, Speaker B: Best price, something like that.
00:22:44.658 - 00:22:46.030, Speaker A: What does that look like?
00:22:46.740 - 00:22:49.120, Speaker B: I don't know. Why don't you help me find it? Stefan?
00:22:56.740 - 00:23:21.476, Speaker C: On the proof of best execution, I feel like that isn't possible on chain insofar as the builder is the only one positioned in the supply chain to be able to provide that guarantee. Because a lot of the problem of providing optimal execution is looking at incoming memple transactions and accounting for the private.
00:23:21.508 - 00:23:22.424, Speaker H: Flow on top of that.
00:23:22.462 - 00:23:36.780, Speaker C: Right, and so if you're bound by the access to purely the mempool, which a lot of them aren't already, you can't even guarantee that. So you could only give that guarantee after the execution is finished and you've seen all of the other transactions that have been included.
00:23:37.120 - 00:24:02.550, Speaker B: Yeah, but I think this assumes that there isn't some way to define a strategy that executes at the time of building a block also that has access to both mempool transactions and private transactions. And I think if you get into a more expressive way of searching on transactions and building blocks like we're trying to do with Suave, then I think you can absolutely do that and take in all that information at blockbuilding time and provide kickbacks to user with that. But we're not there today. To your point.
00:24:04.440 - 00:24:27.070, Speaker A: What role does payment forward or flow have to play on top of this? It's something that there's rumors that it exists and people are paying forward or flow and approaching people and making deals. Is this something that we've seen in practice? Is it a mechanism that should be enshrined? If so, why not? Or is order by order basis really the only way to look at things?
00:24:30.500 - 00:25:08.540, Speaker B: I think it is something that's happening in practice. I think all of us have heard either some of some rumors or some concrete instances of exclusive order flow deals that exist out there in the market. I think what we should be aiming for in the broadest terms are the lowest barriers of entry with a maximum amount of competition possible. I'm open minded to whether that happens on an order per order basis or some other time frame. I haven't seen super compelling models for how you have a longer time frame that keep barriers to entry as low as possible. But if people have those kind of designs, then I'm open minded.
00:25:09.040 - 00:25:11.020, Speaker A: Doesn't everyone pay for order flow?
00:25:19.250 - 00:25:28.030, Speaker B: I think paying for high quality access to mempool transactions is very different than going to a wallet and saying, hey, you're going to exclusively send to Nathan and only nathan.
00:25:35.590 - 00:25:36.980, Speaker A: I didn't hear the question.
00:25:39.270 - 00:25:46.374, Speaker H: Who should decide where the flow goes? So should the user decide where your transactions go or should it be down to the wallet or the IFA or somebody else?
00:25:46.492 - 00:25:47.782, Speaker B: Yeah, good question.
00:25:47.916 - 00:26:16.670, Speaker D: I think it depends. You're going to have very sophisticated users who know exactly how to execute their transaction the best possible way. We might want to make their decision themselves with their own user preferences. And then you can have people who need a curated experience, something a little bit more abstracted and where the wallet hopefully can help them make the best choices and direct the transaction in the best way to optimize outcomes.
00:26:17.650 - 00:26:22.020, Speaker A: Have we seen an experience where the user really picks where the order flow goes yet?
00:26:22.710 - 00:26:33.670, Speaker D: Well, you picking your RPC endpoint is in a way so yes, it does exist. I suppose people who use mev blocker, some of them do it from a wallet, right?
00:26:33.820 - 00:27:43.814, Speaker C: Yeah. But I would actually say that we with Mfblocker follow a slightly different philosophy that we believe users should have complete control and offer a variety of different flavors of the endpoint. There's a no revert endpoint, there's a fully private endpoint where none of your flow gets shared and then there's the default endpoint which shares back running opportunity without the signature. But we believe that really the importance is to give users sensible defaults that are protecting them and that are secure. And I think in that sense, I would say that's one of the design philosophies that Mavblocker differentiates from Mafshare for example, where I understand that it's really up to the user to fully specify their preference of builder, selection of information leakage and all these things which we see in practice not happening. And we think giving the user sensible defaults and running with that has been working quite well. I would love for every user to decide what they do with their order flow, but the reality we see it with cowswap as well, the reality is wallets have the control and I think also the responsibility to act in the best interest of their users and give them sensible defaults.
00:27:43.942 - 00:28:16.306, Speaker B: I think one of the challenges with that is that we're still iterating towards what I think makes sense as sensible defaults and I think all of us agree that we should do that. But taking a data driven approach. And iterating towards that, I think, is what makes the most sense at this time. And we might be a little bit more conservative with where we share our order flow as an example. But a user should be empowered to choose to send to our friends the HFT Builders if they would like. And I would love to see Medblocker allow users that range of preferences on where they send their order flow.
00:28:16.338 - 00:29:18.940, Speaker E: Right now let me raise one more issue here that I'm not sure what would happen and how much is sustainable is this way, but what if everyone will start using map blockers flashboards for preventing front runs, back runs on their transactions? It seems like problem will not disappear, problem will move to another slice. It will be solved differently. I'm not sure but there is a chance that these systems will start working on top of own mempools at some point in time. Just imagine no one is using ethereum mempool, everyone is using like private mempool. So we can't solve this problem this way. I mean it solves this problem for those who use it. But if everyone is going to use it, we need another solution, I believe.
00:29:19.390 - 00:29:22.700, Speaker A: Well then you sell access to the private mempool to the top bidders, right?
00:29:23.310 - 00:29:25.100, Speaker E: Kind of, probably.
00:29:27.390 - 00:29:39.470, Speaker H: Sorry, can I follow up on the sensible defaults very quickly? You talked about sensible defaults. Surely that implies an opinion about what you think something sensible is. Do sensible defaults open you up to regulatory risk?
00:29:41.090 - 00:29:43.578, Speaker C: We are asking for examples of sensible defaults.
00:29:43.594 - 00:29:44.238, Speaker A: Sorry, I didn't fully ask.
00:29:44.244 - 00:29:54.150, Speaker H: Yeah, so if you're putting forward sensible defaults, you're having an opinion about what something is. So at that point are you opening yourself up to regulatory risk?
00:29:55.290 - 00:30:04.406, Speaker C: I can't comment on the regulatory risk. Did you want to have an example of a sensible default or that was just a comment on we should look into regulatory risks. Yeah.
00:30:04.428 - 00:30:24.010, Speaker H: So a sensible default would be no front running, right? So we say you can't front run on this endpoint and that's like a sensible default. So if all of a sudden you're saying okay, no front running on our default endpoint and you do allow front running on another endpoint, does that open you up to a problem from opening up to regulators?
00:30:24.170 - 00:30:25.840, Speaker C: Okay, I don't know.
00:30:27.090 - 00:31:08.334, Speaker D: I think the problem is sensible default. You need to educate them by data. But I wanted to come back on the payment for flow question because there's maybe one area where it sort of makes sense. Maybe as a short term tactical solution, it's the access to an Ofa. For example, you might have searchers who participate in ofa exploit the information in a malicious way of system for example. And you could have permissioning system and gatekeeping. But one other way of doing gatekeeping is maybe to allow people to participate for a set number of blocks or set period of time and pay for it.
00:31:08.372 - 00:31:08.670, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:08.740 - 00:31:15.530, Speaker D: And that could be a tactical way to solve some of those problems, participate.
00:31:15.610 - 00:32:02.042, Speaker F: Sorry, I just want to add that I feel like again, we can't really let perfect be the enemy of the good here. I think there's some degree of consensus that auctions are just a good way of getting better execution. What best execution is I think frankly most users don't actually care about that much today. Otherwise they wouldn't be trading on decentralized exchanges to begin with. And it's a problem that we should spend time thinking about and try and solve over time. But again, it's not sort of overwhelmingly important to solve today. I think one of the more interesting design questions in the ofa space right now is this one around order privacy.
00:32:02.042 - 00:33:00.180, Speaker F: And I think Flashbots are taking a really interesting and perhaps conservative approach here. It's something that we spend a lot of time thinking about in the context of uniswap X orders. So right now we don't reveal users addresses, but we do reveal the pair and order size. The more information that these ofa participants these fillers have available, the more potential they have to front run those orders. There's a degree of information leakage there. At the same time, information leakage is important in order to understand whether you're being adversely selected or not. So continuing to sort of monitor this privacy versus price improvement tradeoff, which I do think is a bit of a binary one, is going to be quite interesting over time.
00:33:00.950 - 00:33:50.050, Speaker I: And while we're at this topic, I'm curious to see a show of hands because while we were talking about the mechanism for uniswap X, we did think a lot about should we do more batched way of routing or should we just do one by one? I think Doug, I don't know if Doug is still here, but he mentioned this potential dynamic of kind of winners curse in an order by order auction scenario. So I do want to see if you think sort of payment for order flow or auction on a batch basis is better than order by order auction. Raise your hand. You think it's worse, raise your hand. So most people just don't have a.
00:33:50.120 - 00:33:53.140, Speaker A: Do you think both are necessary? Raise your hand.
00:33:54.310 - 00:33:55.380, Speaker F: How do you do.
00:33:57.830 - 00:34:24.186, Speaker A: Mean? I won't leak all the secret sauce, but I think it has something to do with the way that Dizier was talking about permissioning access to an auction. And so it's not just that you have anyone that's able to participate in the auction. You can have an auction that's be permissionless to access while still requiring sort of payment for seat at the table to bid on it. And then you have a mix of.
00:34:24.208 - 00:34:28.086, Speaker F: Both in that scenario, auction on auctions.
00:34:28.278 - 00:35:13.370, Speaker B: I think one philosophical belief that I have is that we should be trying to do net new things, net new mechanisms that have a potential to be better than what exists already. And I think we've seen payment for order flow in the traditional financial system. I think there's a possibility that we can do better and I think we should strive towards that. I think there's a large unexplored design space, particularly with privacy here. So we're talking about privacy in the context of people having information or not. But as an example, I think we have not yet explored what it looks like for a searcher to colocate their bot inside of a private environment where you have access to the user's transaction there, but not outside of it. And you restrict what the searcher can do inside of that private environment so you can't front run, you can't trade outside of certain parameters, something like that.
00:35:13.370 - 00:35:32.290, Speaker B: So I think there's a large space for us to iterate and to try to do better than payment for order flow, to try to do better than traditional finance and maybe we'll fail and we'll fall back to the status quo in traditional finance and that's fine. But my philosophical bent is that we have to strive to do more and strive to try to iterate and have better mechanisms.
00:35:32.630 - 00:36:45.450, Speaker C: I was actually interested in the Uniswap decision to hide some of the information. I think it's somewhere aligned with the fundamental difference also of mevlocker and mev share around information sharing. I think we generally take a more open approach and try to use artificial order flow and other things to basically confuse what is right and what is real and what is not real order flow versus trying to limit very much the amount of information we do share. I think the flashboards dashboard doesn't contain much of the bundle like which bundles are actually being background, but I would assume that because of this approach, mavblocker actually has significantly more search integrations and at least today refunds than Mavshare. And I was just wondering for Uniswap, if you guys had done analysis, actually looking at we know for market makers that of course, if they see who is the counterparty like Vitalik is trading, then of course you want to be on the other side of the trade. It's like the least toxic flow you could get versus if you don't know this information, you might be more reluctant. So I wonder, have you actually quantified this trade off and is this something that's more like a gut feeling intuition or found on research?
00:36:45.600 - 00:37:34.858, Speaker F: Yeah, I think we were basically guessing. And again, the problem is that this information leakage especially. So if you think about the Uniswap Labs web interface, the median trade size there is on the order of three to $500 at a time. Right. So if those orders are being front run, it's going to be very difficult to identify them in the data. Right, like really it just looks like noise. So yeah, frankly there's various different parameters that you can decide to obfuscate, one them being address, one them being order size, pair direction, those kinds of things.
00:37:34.858 - 00:37:54.794, Speaker F: We started with address and we're very open to parameterizing this over time as more research comes to the table. But yeah, we're also conscious of the fact that these fillers that we're working with do need a degree of order information in order to provide price improvement.
00:37:54.842 - 00:37:55.390, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:55.540 - 00:38:56.914, Speaker B: I think for a little bit of color on our design decisions around privacy. And an interesting place of touch off for discussion with Felix in particular is that when Flashbots was operating a relay in the proof of work days, we were sending bundles and clear text to miners. And what we found was that miners wouldn't always treat those the way that we expected them to. There's all sorts of misbehavior that happened and it in general just takes a lot of time and investment and resources to identify when someone actually misbehaved in the system. And sometimes you don't know because these are systems you make assumptions in synchrony and you don't know if someone saw a bundle and you're like not exactly sure why a transaction went ahead of someone. And in thinking about how we designed our order flow auction, we didn't want to have a system where we were playing a cat and mouse game with searchers where we actually considered the same exact design from a blocker as an example, where you kind of randomize transactions, throw it out into the world. You kind of try to confuse people.
00:38:56.914 - 00:39:27.870, Speaker B: But we thought it ended up resolving down into us trying to randomize parameters, someone figuring it out, then us iterating on it going investigating, okay, has anyone figured out this system? We're not iterating on it again. And we're trying to build a game where we don't need to do that kind of policing, we don't need to constantly have the human resources in the system to know that it is working correctly. That's one reason why we are further on the privacy end of the spectrum as opposed to randomization or something like that.
00:39:28.020 - 00:40:07.450, Speaker C: Yeah, in a way I see this as the value add of mev blocker, right, like we take on this curation, this investigation, basically we make sure that sensible defaults are set for the user and you have the best experience, you have all the searchers integrated, you have most of the block builders online. And so basically looking forward to the research flashboard is doing is amazing and very interesting on that front as well. Right now we think that by offering this service and this value add, we can give a better experience to the user in today's reality. But yeah, I mean, this is where the two products differ and it's good to also compete.
00:40:07.870 - 00:40:52.274, Speaker F: My personal belief here is that, again, if you think about the median Uniswap Labs interface user, they just don't have and this is why Fillers want to participate in the Uniswap X ecosystem, they just don't actually have that much valuable information to the point where it's even worth sort of front running or basically trading ahead of their orders. Which is why I sort of, again, personally defer more on the side of sharing as much information as possible because I think that's going to translate to optimized price improvement.
00:40:52.402 - 00:41:43.930, Speaker C: Just maybe just one word here, because we've actually at Kauswab also been looking, working very closely together with DAOs or other decentralized institutions, which is just very difficult to be private even if we had perfect trusted enclaves, just because they have a voting process, their thought process is kind of public. And we believe that if there's any doubt of your intent being absolutely private, then probably the best thing you can do is to make it as public as possible and create kind of this. Tomorrow at 12:00 a.m.. I'm going to make this trade and please solvers, resolvers, fillers, line up, and try to give me the best price possible. And so, yeah, if we cannot guarantee full privacy, then maybe opting in for extreme publicity and making sure that we have this visibility for everyone and try to make competition as frictionless and easy to access as possible is probably the best approach.
00:41:44.910 - 00:41:59.566, Speaker D: It's also having as much data as possible so that you can analyze and identify problems after the facts and identify outcomes, behaviors, and iterate over time, really.
00:41:59.748 - 00:42:00.590, Speaker A: All right.
00:42:00.740 - 00:42:08.930, Speaker F: Sorry. I do think the equation does change materially when you're dealing with $50 million orders versus $300 orders.
00:42:10.550 - 00:42:23.018, Speaker A: So I'll make a prediction. Unfortunately, we're at time, but I think we're sitting in somewhere today on ethereum where, like, I don't know what percentage of transactions are private and never hit the mempo.
00:42:23.054 - 00:42:24.598, Speaker B: Would you guys say 10%?
00:42:24.684 - 00:42:27.480, Speaker A: About 10%, 15%.
00:42:30.010 - 00:42:30.838, Speaker F: Is it matt in.
00:42:30.844 - 00:43:06.606, Speaker A: The back that says 15. So show of hands. A year from now, and I want the room to be engaged in this again, will there be less than 20% of transactions that are private? If you believe that there's less than 20%, put your hand up. If you believe that there's 20% to 50% of the transactions are going to be private, put your hand up. If you believe that there's going to be 50% to 80%, put your hand up. And if you believe that there's going to be 80% plus you can put your hand up.
00:43:06.708 - 00:43:08.686, Speaker C: Are you going to fund the prediction market for this?
00:43:08.788 - 00:43:16.660, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Let's find out a year from now which one is right. Thank you, panelists. Thank.
