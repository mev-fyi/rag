00:00:08.320 - 00:00:12.142, Speaker A: Four fantastic panelists. Quick introduction for myself, Rob Sarro, and.
00:00:12.158 - 00:00:13.394, Speaker B: Investor at Full Capital.
00:00:14.214 - 00:00:23.630, Speaker A: But I'd really like to kick off by everyone introducing themselves and really understand what they're working on in the permission layer right now, we'll start with Kendall.
00:00:23.822 - 00:00:32.234, Speaker C: So I just spoke, so probably heard my intro, but I'm Kendall, co founder of Proximity, and we are working with a lot of in your teams on some chance.
00:00:33.934 - 00:00:47.554, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, my name is Ahmed. I'm one of the co founders at Bioconomy. And at Bioconomy we provide a full stack account traction solution for developers. We're currently the biggest infrastructure provider for account distraction right now in UBM.
00:00:48.454 - 00:01:04.144, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Magnus Resnick. I'm the head of research at Special Mechanisms Group, which is a division within consensus that works on mev research and special projects. As far as the permission layer goes, I work somewhat with Linia and with NMS.
00:01:05.604 - 00:01:13.984, Speaker E: I'm Austin Adams. I'm a researcher at Uniswap Labs. I work on protocol design on Uniswap V four and a lot of our other products.
00:01:18.404 - 00:01:38.604, Speaker A: All right. So, yeah, to really kick it off, I think blockchain presents significant barriers to entry not related for wallet and fees associated with each transaction. So to kind of add a little bit of life in the beginning of the panel, I think we should kind of go through spiciest takes. I would like to start off first. When it comes to transaction fees, specifically, I like to start off with Max.
00:01:40.224 - 00:02:45.196, Speaker D: Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on this. I think if you follow me on Twitter, you know that I'm not a big fan of 1559. I guess the framing that we should always think about transaction fees is, is it efficient? Do we have the people who want to get on chain, getting on chain the most? People who want to get the most? That should be what happens. And then the other thing, which I think 1559 tried to address is should users have low regret? Should they be overpaying or underpaying? How do we try to fix that? And I think 1559 took a stab at it, and I'm not super happy with where we got. I think you look at a 1559 price chart and it has enough fluctuation. If you look at 1 hour 50 59 price chart, it looks very similar to like a 60 year housing price chart because the parameter of the update roll in 1559 is too fast. And so you'll have, you know, within the span of ten blocks, which is like two minutes, you'll have prices going from 40 way to 80 way.
00:02:45.196 - 00:03:10.804, Speaker D: And if you're a user, you know, facing that, that's pretty hard. If you're just the average user, do I want to use the chain right now? Do I want to wait two minutes and see if the price goes down by half? I think we want to have a system where users can just look at the chain and say, okay, the price is around 40 way right now. It's probably going to be around 40 way for the next hour because demand is pretty steady and that makes the user experience and the user choice and want to do a lot easier.
00:03:12.104 - 00:03:26.564, Speaker E: I think it's like a follow up on that. It's also really hard to do gas estimates. We do a lot of gas estimates for our users. It's extremely hard. We essentially just have to put it at max and then it causes issues like congestion a lot.
00:03:27.124 - 00:03:31.284, Speaker B: It's ten x hard over here. It's ten x hard over the counteraction.
00:03:31.324 - 00:03:34.664, Speaker E: And all of that 437 is bad.
00:03:35.444 - 00:03:37.464, Speaker A: Can you explain on that why it's.
00:03:39.164 - 00:04:09.094, Speaker B: So essentially. Well, all of four, 30 transactions are happening on l two s at the moment. And so you essentially need to calculate the l two gas fee, the cool date on l one as well. And every l two has just different ways of doing gas. Right. And so when you're supporting these new chains and these applications, what essentially happens is, you know, you'd have to really just integrate. There's no sort of common way of integrating everything.
00:04:09.094 - 00:04:24.454, Speaker B: So that's one aspect, and the other aspect is the entry point. So the entry point kind of leaves a buffer when it comes to gas, and so it just becomes a bit harder to estimate. We are actually coming out with huge.
00:04:24.494 - 00:04:26.166, Speaker E: Improved gas estimations from our side.
00:04:26.190 - 00:04:38.274, Speaker B: We're actually going to put out an SDK that's going to be fully open sourced. The team could use it that will hopefully kind of say, okay, this is probably how gas estimation should look like, so we'll probably cover that next week.
00:04:39.694 - 00:04:50.564, Speaker A: That's awesome to hear. Now, when it comes to, I guess, to circle back a little bit more on the spicier side of takes, I'd like to hear something from Kendall. I know you kind of went through the abstraction side of things.
00:04:51.864 - 00:04:52.176, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:52.200 - 00:05:05.896, Speaker C: I mean, specifically on the fee model. I think my spicy take is that, well, I think it's actually more at the chain level. I think that the economics of most chains are kind of broken, especially with, you know, I'm saying this about here.
00:05:05.920 - 00:05:07.208, Speaker B: But like, even the fast chains, I.
00:05:07.216 - 00:05:32.428, Speaker C: Think it's unclear, especially with the securities. I think the cost of securing a chain is going to continue to trend towards zero, especially as we were able to like get more efficient with CPA approves and prove every single state transition. And I think that's actually going to have like a pretty important reckoning for those chains in the space, so less about specifically transaction fees, but ultimately that's how many chains are kind of securing themselves.
00:05:32.476 - 00:05:34.984, Speaker B: And I think that's going to cause some issues in the future.
00:05:36.044 - 00:05:42.624, Speaker A: And then, Austin, from the application side of things, what are the things that you're thinking through and does that result in anything spicy?
00:05:43.004 - 00:06:23.624, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think last week we had to do a ton of work because our arbitrum fee calculations were really off. It's like not trivial at all to integrate these new chains. So like users always, or chains always come to us like we want to be on the uniswap interface. Can you just integrate us? It's really easy. And I'm like, it is not easy. It is like the hardest thing to do, and one of the reasons is because transaction fees or cash fees is really hard. And also there's enough difference between chains that it makes it very hard to integrate, especially like on the level of flow that comes through the interface.
00:06:24.444 - 00:06:31.144, Speaker A: Do you think this becomes more like a user education problem or developer education problem?
00:06:32.124 - 00:06:58.664, Speaker E: I don't think a user should be expected to calculate their gas. I think it's fundamentally impossible for them to know. I think one of the good parts, I guess about 1559, there are good parts about it, is that like 95% of our users land on chain within one block because they're willing to pay for the gas. Could they have paid less and got the same opportunity? Probably that's what they're indicating is they want to be on the chain as fast as possible.
00:06:58.744 - 00:07:00.264, Speaker B: So that's, I guess, good.
00:07:00.424 - 00:07:30.194, Speaker E: But yeah, I think like maybe a technical thing. I think it's also just like, the multi chain world is very new. So like, we integrated on, we integrated Uniswap V two on l two s recently, and I actually did all the deployments for it and it was really hard. It's just like I had to get an etherscan code, I had to get gas on every chain, I had to check all the addresses on every chain. I had to go look at their scanner, and it's just like, it is not easy to be a chain developer either.
00:07:30.234 - 00:07:57.704, Speaker D: I just think we're not there yet. And I think it's obviously we should expect users to try to estimate their own fees, but one of the things to recognize is even for people who are at the scale of Uniswap or USA with Metamask, with hundreds of millions of transactions, it's still not trivial to estimate the fees. And we would appreciate if it was easier so that we can give users a better experience.
00:07:58.444 - 00:08:01.220, Speaker B: Just one more quick take here is.
00:08:01.412 - 00:08:02.828, Speaker E: A couple of years ago, we actually.
00:08:02.876 - 00:08:25.624, Speaker B: Looked into fixed price transactions in the form of gas, and then we sort of realized this was an entirely new company. So if anyone is building this, I'd love to talk to you, because I think if anyone were to offer so fixed price transactions, it would be pretty amazing. It would heavily improve the UX, but it's very, very hard to do.
00:08:27.044 - 00:08:38.764, Speaker A: Can you kind of touch on a point that I want to jump into where it comes from? What are the tools that developers need to put them in the best position to assist the abstraction, for instance?
00:08:43.024 - 00:09:25.904, Speaker D: Yes. One thing I'll say that is a little bit concerning now is that more transactions are moving to private channels. And so there are certain entities within the supply chain that have more information about what the state of unpool is and what fees you need to get in than others. And if you're not like sophisticated and not tied into the supply chain, you just don't see half the order flow. So you don't see half the things that are competing with your users for the spotlight block. And it'll be nice if you can figure out a way that level the playing field. So you didn't basically have to run a blockbuilder to have all the information required to estimate transaction fees.
00:09:27.454 - 00:09:35.502, Speaker E: Yeah, I think like a lot of the non, a lot of the non, sort of like blockbuster flow comes from our interface. That's still like very difficult for us.
00:09:35.518 - 00:09:38.678, Speaker B: To even know what it will be. And it.
00:09:38.686 - 00:09:41.294, Speaker E: So it just ends up and it affects users a lot.
00:09:41.334 - 00:09:41.486, Speaker D: Right?
00:09:41.510 - 00:10:04.754, Speaker E: Like they really want to be in the next block because we're trying to buy something and we functionally just have to max out their gas. Like they just always max out their gas fee. And it's like it's a reveal of preference that users are willing to pay for that inclusion speed. But is it like a really great optimal outcome? Like, sure, they can pay more, but should they? Especially when gas fees are so high.
00:10:05.294 - 00:11:06.604, Speaker B: I guess to go from intention, to answer your question, at least on the 407 side, what we've been seeing is that lots of applications want to enable account attraction, which is great. I would say, like, people typically ask me like, you know, who's your competitor? I say it's actually the EOA inertia just because of the fact that when it comes to adapt, you know, they want to basically build what the users are and essentially where all this tooling currently exists. And so it's a really interesting, I would say, balancing act to ensure that devs have enough tooling to ensure that they can attract it more the users that they actually can, you know, be it if they onboard via smart wallet or they actually onboard EOA. And so whether it's, you know, working with embedded wallets, making integration super simple, or ensuring a new app chain becomes native, a from the get goes well are like, you know, just a few words of making sure developers have the right, you know, things that they need to provide the best experience for them.
00:11:09.484 - 00:11:27.412, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think that is one of the big challenges with the contracted wallets is that if you're targeting crypto natives, they almost certainly have some form of wallets already. So I mean, if you're a brand new chain, you might have a little bit of an easier time. You have hard enough time to use it anyway so that you can put them in a fresh wallet.
00:11:27.508 - 00:11:28.652, Speaker A: But if you're an l two or.
00:11:28.668 - 00:11:40.204, Speaker C: You'Re building an EVM ecosystem and you do have to fight them in your should, I don't think there's a really clean way or I don't think the experience tends to be better enough to actually motivate these users to migrate.
00:11:40.364 - 00:11:57.824, Speaker B: I think we're just made depend on the app experience. So this is why some dapps are like, yeah, we'll just do it, we know what ux is. Yeah, and you're right. In terms of users, they shouldn't need to know. Right. And so it's still, yeah, it's something where from the Dapp level, if it makes sense.
00:11:59.724 - 00:12:06.394, Speaker A: So what do you think those like essential elements are? If you have to distill down to three things for the end users.
00:12:08.334 - 00:12:10.942, Speaker E: So just to clarify, like what in.
00:12:10.958 - 00:12:13.686, Speaker B: Terms of what did they use for?
00:12:13.750 - 00:12:20.434, Speaker A: Like the user centric approach, like when it comes to designing for end users, for abstracting as much of the complexity as possible.
00:12:21.094 - 00:12:45.794, Speaker B: So one thing is definitely spend some transactions. 99% of our transactions right now are all gasless transactions. And so that step you want to spend. The second aspect, I would say this is emerging and I really hope to see more of it. It's just that it's still very early. It's the concept of paying gas in unity token. So we just supported trust wallet with their new account attraction wallet.
00:12:45.794 - 00:13:31.370, Speaker B: On the native app, we essentially provide the litmus into a gas in over 250 tokens across seven union chains. And right now, given all the transactions that are happening, like, it's very clear what ends up being passed. The first one is USDT, and the second is the actual trustworthy token because they allow users to pay less gas if you pay the trustworthy token. So I would say this is like an emerging thing that, like, for users, if they kind of see that value add, then you would be able to do it. And then the third is more. So this depends on the Dapp wanting it for the user. Like, we can talk about session keys, but let's say if it's just for the user themselves, I would say this.
00:13:31.370 - 00:13:40.306, Speaker B: We still don't have a world where, like, if I'm using metamask and this is, I think, what you guys are doing, which is great, like, you know.
00:13:40.330 - 00:13:42.442, Speaker E: This consolidated view of, I have accounts.
00:13:42.458 - 00:14:11.714, Speaker B: Across, I have this account and it has ETH across, you know, these three different chains. I know April to this new help too. How can I just batch send my ten ETH across three chains and send it to my transaction? And I think, you know, we still don't have that ability. And, you know, it would be really awesome to see that. But that is on the smart house as well. So the name of stuff, not the current. So I'd say those three things for the, at least for the user point of view.
00:14:14.334 - 00:14:16.550, Speaker A: Does anyone have anything additional to that?
00:14:16.662 - 00:14:45.974, Speaker D: Yeah, I really agree with the first two there. I think my third might be just not making the user do more than one transaction to take an action, just approvals. Where I first got into it, I felt like that really confused me. I signed my approval and it's on chain. Like, why do I not have to swap in my wallet? So I think we need to get better at one click and kind of bundling all that stuff together so it's seamless and invisible for the end user.
00:14:46.954 - 00:15:06.242, Speaker E: We've sort of gotten into like one click swaps in the uniswap wallet, sort of, sort of more control. I think one of the things that is really confusing to users is they're like, why do I need ETH at all? It's very confusing, especially when a user gets sent money, they're just like, why.
00:15:06.258 - 00:15:12.722, Speaker B: Do I need a second token to do something? It's not having these native ways of, like, they don't have to deal with.
00:15:12.738 - 00:15:16.898, Speaker E: That at all is pretty difficult for them. Especially, like, when it's a user's first.
00:15:16.946 - 00:15:18.530, Speaker B: Item on chain, they might not even.
00:15:18.562 - 00:15:27.124, Speaker E: Like, know what's happening. So I think, like, yeah, extracting away gas is very important and having better ways of doing.
00:15:29.064 - 00:15:29.352, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:29.368 - 00:15:59.674, Speaker C: I think having to understand that your token might be on, might be on like, a different l two or a chain or whatever it is that you may know exists is a bit of a complex experience. We're probably going to see that with a lot of, like, you know, pay your friends USDC for dinner or something and pay it to you on, like, to even CK sync or something that we all do pretty well, but maybe they've never heard of that or even have heard of ML two. The way that is, you have to explain to them, oh, yeah, that's supported on these exchanges, but not in these exchanges. It just becomes like a frustrating experience.
00:16:00.694 - 00:16:19.074, Speaker A: Austin, you mentioned within the Uniswap app, you're getting to the one squads. Do you believe that the interface is where everything lives and this is what all the users need to worry about, and it shifts kind of the competition to one layer below all the other services to provide for them on location?
00:16:20.014 - 00:16:32.950, Speaker E: Yeah, I think users will naturally go to where it's best for them. I'm sort of a believer that, like, the user doesn't really care about, like, one or two bits. They just sort of want their thing, and they want it now, and they want, like, good average execution.
00:16:33.022 - 00:16:34.398, Speaker B: They just want good outcomes.
00:16:34.446 - 00:16:36.206, Speaker E: They want their things when they want it.
00:16:36.350 - 00:16:37.686, Speaker B: And we should be competing to give.
00:16:37.710 - 00:16:57.226, Speaker E: Them the best prices, best gas, best, I don't know, like, experience. So I think, like, those things should and have to be abstracted away from the user. It's quite insane that we're like, all right, you have to go to your metamask approved or wallet, but you can't prove too much. And then you gotta go set your sluggish tolerance, and then you gotta go.
00:16:57.250 - 00:16:58.394, Speaker B: Do all this stuff.
00:16:58.554 - 00:17:02.682, Speaker E: It's just like, do you really expect, like, your grandmother to do that and.
00:17:02.698 - 00:17:03.818, Speaker B: Then not lose all their money?
00:17:03.866 - 00:17:11.813, Speaker E: It's just, like, not feasible at all. And that's like, it's not just for, like, uniswap. I think it's just for, like, every interaction to have on chain.
00:17:13.473 - 00:17:57.524, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the user needs to get what they expect to get almost every time. And right now they may be getting it 95% of the time, and we're good. And a lot of users, like you were saying, austin, are they will sign their transaction and they'll just stare at it and wait. So, you know, maybe we could just lower block times. Then they could be waiting slightly less long, but also just make sure that they can get in to the next block. If they're the type of person that will just sit there and anxiously stare for their $10,000 swap or whatever to go through would be pretty nice. And we can always make sure that they could get it in the next block if they're not censored because the builder is trying to manipulate the base feed or something.
00:17:59.504 - 00:18:09.154, Speaker A: Speaking of blockbust, Max, you tweeted earlier today that the perfect chain does not exist. Would love to understand, like, your thinking behind that and have everyone.
00:18:10.934 - 00:18:56.414, Speaker D: Yeah, I think I was being sarcastic that I think the perfect chain doesn't exist right now, but we know what it would look like. And one of the things there is 200 millisecond lock times. And that just goes back to what I was saying where the user just doesn't want to be sitting there waiting for 12 seconds or 24 seconds if they don't make them first block. That's just an anxious and painful experience for the user. So I think 200 millisecond block times would be a great way to do that. Another thing I put in there on my wish list for the perfect chain was a multiple proposer architecture, where in case one of the proposers doesn't want to clean being by somebody else, that just contributes more to that seamless. I did the action that I was supposed to do.
00:18:56.414 - 00:18:59.574, Speaker D: I expected to get my swing hands here.
00:19:01.714 - 00:19:06.814, Speaker A: Does anyone else have anything to add to their perfect chain? Any disagreements?
00:19:08.074 - 00:19:22.774, Speaker E: No, I think maybe 200 milliseconds now. Maybe get it down lower and get it done higher. But yeah, I think this number doesn't super matter. I just think it's like, 12 seconds is kind of a lot. I do like a lot of my.
00:19:23.094 - 00:19:27.054, Speaker B: Stuff, like, in the EVM ecosystem, like, I'm altoos now.
00:19:27.214 - 00:19:34.470, Speaker E: It's like, commonized to be like, your friend. You know, you do your transaction and you open, you know, army scan or optimism scan.
00:19:34.502 - 00:19:35.366, Speaker D: It's just done.
00:19:35.510 - 00:19:43.862, Speaker E: You're like, it's done. I'm happy. I don't have to just, like, wait there and just click it until it, you know, indexes or something or if it gets mine.
00:19:43.918 - 00:19:45.366, Speaker B: So it's quite nice.
00:19:45.430 - 00:19:49.434, Speaker E: Just like, open up armor scan and have it done. I think it's important to learn a.
00:19:49.434 - 00:19:52.146, Speaker B: Lot of times, and I think it's.
00:19:52.170 - 00:20:10.162, Speaker D: Not just do I get aim in the next block. It's also when does probabilistic finality, that's enough for the exchange to credit my balance exist? And that's one of the, like, if you ever, like, move money to coinbase or something that isn't really painful, just to wait for the. Whatever, whatever it is, 35 blocks or.
00:20:10.178 - 00:20:12.774, Speaker E: Something that they take lower on days.
00:20:13.674 - 00:20:13.962, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:13.978 - 00:20:15.506, Speaker D: Because they have lower lockdowns. Yeah, of course.
00:20:15.570 - 00:20:16.978, Speaker B: Well, I think also they control.
00:20:17.106 - 00:20:20.826, Speaker D: They also control base, so they didn't trust. That was the thing I noticed.
00:20:20.850 - 00:20:23.274, Speaker E: I moved money to Coinbase from arbitram.
00:20:23.314 - 00:20:25.122, Speaker B: And it took a lot longer than.
00:20:25.138 - 00:20:26.254, Speaker E: I did on base.
00:20:27.234 - 00:20:29.618, Speaker B: Is that a technical reason? I don't know, but it is.
00:20:29.666 - 00:20:32.694, Speaker E: It was much nicer user experience to have a fast.
00:20:35.074 - 00:20:36.354, Speaker A: Any other comments on that?
00:20:36.394 - 00:21:19.048, Speaker B: Or this is just like a personal anecdote. I was in London, my wife was in Dubai. I had to do a payment, you know, and I was like, all right, let's just go on Google, meet, share your screen, just go through metamask. I need you to swap some things. Took me 20. Took 20 minutes to swap one token to USDC and then actually send that. And then I said, okay, this is why, you know, we exist as a company, because, you know, fundamentally, you know, why is it taking, you know, my wife, who doesn't know much about crypto, and me just helping along that journey around 1520 minutes to do that? And so, yeah, I mean, just.
00:21:19.048 - 00:21:22.844, Speaker B: Just to throw, you know, just to add up to what they were saying.
00:21:24.224 - 00:21:35.838, Speaker C: One thing I'll add to the exchange example you guys are giving is that even these really fast and cheap alternator chains, there tends to be like, a fixed sort of withdrawal fee of like a dollar less, which for a lot.
00:21:35.846 - 00:21:36.774, Speaker B: Of people maybe isn't a big deal.
00:21:36.814 - 00:22:01.798, Speaker C: But for a good segment of the people we're trying on for actually can make a pretty big difference. If you're trying to draw like, 510 bucks, a dollar is a lot. And I guess what's interesting is, like, the gas fees are not necessarily, I mean, if you're using arbitrary stuff like that, maybe. But I think we actually really need to get that. That's where gas fees actually become, like a really big difference maker. It's like that fee needs to be as close to zero as possible if we want people to use this for a broad amount of, like, the actual.
00:22:01.886 - 00:22:04.604, Speaker B: Real world payment use exist outside the west.
00:22:06.944 - 00:22:12.924, Speaker A: Speaking of use cases, what are the use cases that people are excited about when it comes to this chain of traction?
00:22:16.064 - 00:23:04.328, Speaker E: I think it'd be kind of nice to have swaps done one chain and then have, like, settlement done on mainnet, for example. I think, like, it would be very nice if we could abstract away from users and devs that they're on different chains and then they can sort of just like trade where it's the best prices. Because we see this in practice, like, you know, arbitrary has better arbitrary liquidity. Optimism has better optimism liquidity. And like users, a lot of users actually come to mainnet and they're like, why is this optimism liquidity bad? Well, that's how it is. And they don't really like that. So it'd be kind of nice if like you could do trades on one chain and then have them settle here in your wallet without actually having to deal with all the complexities behind bridging.
00:23:04.376 - 00:23:05.684, Speaker B: And the costs as well.
00:23:07.144 - 00:23:46.684, Speaker D: I think I'm most excited about gas sponsorship and paying gas other tokens. Actually, one of the things we notice in the user flows is that there's quite a few users who will queue up a swap and then we'll go and they will see that they just like don't have enough gas or gas and then they will cancel their swap. And I think obviously they're queuing up the swap, they're probably pretty interested in doing it. So moving at friction, we can see that's a very tangible segment of the population that wants to swap and they can just, you know, pay their gas even if they don't have it sponsored for them. They would be much happier.
00:23:48.064 - 00:24:31.774, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's so many things to be excited about. You guys ready? Said quite a few things. One thing I would say is there was one really cool integration which we did, bio modules using account traction, which enabled a perk aggregator to allow their users to sign a trade or arbitrary, but the actual trade will sign the transaction option, but the actual trade is happening on optimism. And so this essentially allowing users to do transactions on different chains regardless of where they are. And I think we're still yet to see like the best solve UI design for this. It'll be really cool to see so how this could look like in the future.
00:24:33.434 - 00:24:50.102, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm excited to give developers the opportunity to not necessarily lock themselves into a given ecosystem. Like maybe they can still, you know, part of the ethereum because it would be an l two, but they don't necessarily have to pick a specific l two. There's just like we're going to enable ways for them to kind of sit.
00:24:50.198 - 00:24:52.862, Speaker B: A bit above that. And I think that that's kind of.
00:24:52.878 - 00:24:57.326, Speaker C: One of the harrowing choices you have to make as a developer is like which chain or l two or whatever.
00:24:57.350 - 00:24:59.110, Speaker A: It is do we kind of focus.
00:24:59.182 - 00:25:06.390, Speaker C: On, and there are some benefits doing that. But there are also some serious drawbacks and that's not necessarily really a core part of what most, or at least.
00:25:06.422 - 00:25:07.446, Speaker E: A lot of these navs are trying.
00:25:07.470 - 00:25:08.810, Speaker A: To build, that they're trying to build.
00:25:08.842 - 00:25:10.374, Speaker E: For just end users.
00:25:11.394 - 00:25:24.854, Speaker A: And then throughout the permission layer, like where do you see all those different innovations, new use cases like the value actually flow to and can be captured, like what entity ends up being the successful out of all this?
00:25:25.474 - 00:26:07.184, Speaker D: I'll tell you, I hope it isn't. Which is the validator, the proposer who just basically runs a piece of software and for some reason right now is getting a huge cut of the revenue by running this PBS auction that doesn't really take that much to run. I really hope that we are able to build systems that can keep the validator from getting a huge cut of the pie and distribute it to users and to the people who are making these or experience actually good. I think validators are important. I think they deserve revenue and I think they get revenue from the protocol. I don't think they need a huge additional boost of revenue from. From MeV that comes about due to change traction or whatever we do.
00:26:07.764 - 00:26:45.764, Speaker E: Yeah, I think it's also like really, really hard today to build systems that don't have validators coming first. We think a lot about how to build systems that are good for like armed users, be swappers via LP's. And it's just extremely hard because this first look at last that like validators and blockbusters have, I think, like Hayden posted a tweet recently, like $2 billion has been given to ETH validators from the Unispop protocol. And like a lot less of that has flown to LP flow to the protocol like the DAO itself.
00:26:47.104 - 00:27:18.864, Speaker B: I generally think, of course, those who own the uses, the front end will ultimately create them all value and which goes part and par with, you know, convenience fees are, I think, going to be going to be the norm as well for users. Like, you know, how we are seeing users not just paying the swap fee of metamask, but essentially just wanting to pay higher gas price right to get the swap executed. So I think if we're able to provide, just vetting the exit people will pay for.
00:27:21.024 - 00:27:26.744, Speaker C: Yeah, pretty much echo all of that. I think the closer to these you are, the better position you are. I think Metamask has been a very.
00:27:26.784 - 00:27:28.004, Speaker B: Good example of that.
00:27:28.384 - 00:28:32.104, Speaker D: Well, obviously, but I think that is, you know, it may sound like, hey, that's not going to users, but I think the closer the incentives are to the user the more the users could get out of it. I mean, you're going to see a bunch of places that see there's a lot of value for providing a good experience to the user and then they're going to go for a good user experience. And I think that's exactly what we want. The further away that experience, the further away that value flow is from the user. And the less it requires you to provide a good experience, the less incentive there is to do it. And I also think if you look at credit card points, you look at Chase every year, their margin on their credit card rewards program is squeezed even tighter because everybody else realizes, hey, there's a lot of value from providing a good credit card program that has good features and good rewards, and they have to spend more and more to keep that up. And I hope for the users that that's what's going to happen in the ad tier as well.
00:28:32.884 - 00:28:34.404, Speaker E: Yeah, it's quite hard to sort of.
00:28:34.444 - 00:28:35.024, Speaker A: Like.
00:28:36.724 - 00:28:42.976, Speaker E: Of like all the transactions, like, very little of that flows to the entities who sort of like build the.
00:28:43.000 - 00:28:44.040, Speaker D: Protocol and things like that.
00:28:44.072 - 00:29:09.492, Speaker E: And so it's very difficult. Like we could cut down a part of the fees going to certain users or certain like subsets like validators and things like that, and then cut down costs from everybody by just providing a little bit of that. What was going to validators to others. It's very difficult to sort of like the economics of making money as a protocol or a DaO or like a entity in the space.
00:29:09.548 - 00:29:11.132, Speaker B: Very difficult at this moment just because.
00:29:11.188 - 00:29:14.024, Speaker E: A lot of the value is weirdly flowing.
00:29:16.124 - 00:29:16.484, Speaker B: Now.
00:29:16.524 - 00:29:27.184, Speaker A: To wrap it up, one last thing I want to ask is what would you want to see from a UX perspective change not in the near term, but five years out? And how feasible is this prediction?
00:29:28.644 - 00:29:59.566, Speaker E: I just want to know. I would really like a better way to do like gas estimates on l two s and like, I think like foundry is actually just may have to fix this today. They just fixed their gas profile there. So I may be wrong right now, but it's. We were doing gas golfing for l two contracts. It was just like possible to figure out how much we were actually saving our users because of, of what? The cost of posting and maintenance is not included. But I actually may be wrong.
00:29:59.566 - 00:30:02.354, Speaker E: I think maybe foundry fixed that today.
00:30:03.054 - 00:30:27.424, Speaker D: Address is always one step ahead. I guess my biggest request is can we get some shorter block times, whether it's on Mainnet or on the l one s or whatever? I just think users need to be more quickly interacting with the chain and have more feedback, and I think that will make their experience so much better.
00:30:28.924 - 00:30:55.004, Speaker B: I would love to see us using, at least myself to be using crypto more by mobile. I'm using it a bit, but it's like, what, maybe 15% of my crypto activity I'd love to see like, it being more moving, 80 90%. So I don't think we have the apps for that yet, nor the relevant tooling. So I love to see us get to the point.
00:30:57.184 - 00:31:04.324, Speaker C: I would like to be able to go between chains and not acquire the das tokens, so how are we to make that happen?
00:31:07.504 - 00:31:10.024, Speaker B: Well, thank you again everyone, and a big thanks to the panelists.
