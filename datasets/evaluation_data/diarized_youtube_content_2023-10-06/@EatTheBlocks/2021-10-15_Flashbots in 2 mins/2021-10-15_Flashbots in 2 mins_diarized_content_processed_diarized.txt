00:00:00.330 - 00:00:33.122, Speaker A: On Ethereum, miners have an unfair advantage. That's what we call me V since 2020, miners have made more than $700 million using techniques like front running and sandwich attack. Flashboard is a research project to fight against meV. What is Mev and how can flashboard protect against it? That's what we'll see in this video. If you are new here, I'm Julian and on idoblocks I teach blockchain development. You MeV means miner extracted value. It's a flow in Ethereum that allows miners to make money off users.
00:00:33.122 - 00:01:11.742, Speaker A: When a transaction is sent to the Ethereum network, it goes into the mem pool of each miner. The mempool is an order list of all pending transactions. If a miner sees a transaction that is profitable, like a liquidation or an arbitrage, he can steal the opportunity for himself by sending the same transaction with a higher gas price. That's what we call front running. Another kind of mev is a sandwich attack when a miner anticipates a price increase by wrapping a buy order with its own buy and sell order. This allows the miner to benefit from the slippage created by the initial transaction at the expense of the trader. Flashbot comes to our rescue with flashboard, we have searchers, relayers, and miners.
00:01:11.742 - 00:01:38.054, Speaker A: Searchers are the users of the flashboard service. They create an order list of transactions with their own transaction first and with the other transactions coming from the public. Ethereum mempool searchers make sure to select the most profitable transactions for miners. This transaction list is called a flashboard bundle. Then they send this bundle to relayers. Relayer acts as a layer of defense in case of a denial of service. Attack relayers forwards the bundles to flashboard miners.
00:01:38.054 - 00:02:21.042, Speaker A: Flashboard miners are miners who run a modified ethereum client called Getmev. They select the most preferable bundle and mine it in the next block. Miners get paid by searchers with direct ether transfer in a smart contract instead of with transaction fees. This guarantees searchers that they will only pay miners if their transaction don't fail to select transaction with flashboards. You can combine the ethers library with the flashboard plugin for ethers, and if you want something even most simple, you can use the flashboard protects API the flashboard protects API, handles all the low level details and offers a simplified interface. It will also resend transactions that didn't get mined. So now you know what are flashboots? A great use case for flashboots is to do an arbitrage with flash loans.
