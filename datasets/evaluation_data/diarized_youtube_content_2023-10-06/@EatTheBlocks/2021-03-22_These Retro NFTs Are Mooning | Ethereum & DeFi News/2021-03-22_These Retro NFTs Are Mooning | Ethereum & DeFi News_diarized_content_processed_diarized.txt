00:00:08.010 - 00:00:35.522, Speaker A: Alive. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news and Ethereum and DFI. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. And if you know me, I'm Julian, your host. And on my channel iddoblocks, I teach blockchain development. And if you are already a blockchain developer and you want to get started in DFI, you want to find your first DFI job and you want to learn DFI development.
00:00:35.522 - 00:00:57.742, Speaker A: Tomorrow at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight I'm going to do a free webinar on how to get started in D five. So I put the link in the chat. Please let me know if you can see the link because sometimes YouTube does some weird stuff and sends all my link. Super weird. Hi everybody. Hi.
00:00:57.742 - 00:01:21.110, Speaker A: See antanda abracadabra llama. Six. Six. Hi everybody. Yes, sorry I was a little bit late today because I had some technical problem with Chrome, but this is fixed. So we're going to get started with the price of ether. What's going on? So we are going sideway.
00:01:21.110 - 00:01:57.054, Speaker A: This week is a little bit boring. Nothing special happened. I think everybody is impatient to break the all time high that we had a couple of weeks ago. The gas price is going up again, unfortunately, a little bit. And when it comes to ethereum 2.0. So currently the current yield is 8.2% and we have 111,000 validators, so it's more than any other blockchain.
00:01:57.054 - 00:02:24.220, Speaker A: And according to Vitalik, at some point we could have up to 1 million validator. All right, then we're going to continue with the market cap of Defi. So we do have a stable market cap in DeFi this week. However, the number. Oh, how comes this is not loading properly? What's going on? DeFi plus. Okay, let me reload this. Okay.
00:02:24.220 - 00:02:56.582, Speaker A: Yeah, so quite stable this week. However, in terms of the number of ether invested, it keeps going up, which is very good. So currently we have about 9.3 million ether invested out of roughly a total of 115,000,000. So that's about 8% of all the ether invested in DFI. Okay, so next, let's have a quick look with the rate. So die on DYDX, 14%.
00:02:56.582 - 00:03:16.790, Speaker A: Die on ave 15% on dy DX 14% on Ave for dies. Really good then. BusD is so crazy. On Ave bUsd 33%. This is a stable coin. And then another stable coin that I didn't know. Tusd.
00:03:16.790 - 00:03:42.046, Speaker A: Yeah, here on Ave, 100%. So you can see that you can have some really nice return even with doing some really simple thing like just lending some stable coin. Okay, so let's see now, the Defi token. So how are we doing this week? Well, this week we have much more green than red. So a really good week. So first ASD. So that's the token of Airswap.
00:03:42.046 - 00:04:18.910, Speaker A: So airswap, this is a peer to peer exchange for Es 20 token. It was one of the first Defi project, but other project like Uniswap totally eclipsed airswap. So some of you may not have heard of them before, but they were really one of the first one. And so the advantage of peer to peer trading versus liquidity pools like Uniswap is that you have more privacy and you have less front running. And so this week we had a huge price pump and this is related to a new feature which is introduced by Metamask. And thanks to this new feature, Airswap received more trading volume than usual. Important detail.
00:04:18.910 - 00:04:41.282, Speaker A: The team of Airswap also work on the new feature of Metamask. And I will actually talk about this new feature a little bit later. Then we have the MLN token which pump a lot. So this is the project of enzyme. It used to be called the melon protocol. This is basically indices for the DeFi industry. It's a little bit similar to the set protocol.
00:04:41.282 - 00:05:17.534, Speaker A: It allows anybody to basically create your crypto hedge fund. And so this project was created by an ex prop trader of Goldman Sachs. So prop trader are the traders that trade the capital of the bank. So they are really the sort of elite of traders. So that's a huge plus for enzyme to have someone like this in their team. Then what else do we have in the winner here? The coin of BF finance. So this is a yield aggregator on the binance smart chain, also CBaT.
00:05:17.534 - 00:06:03.970, Speaker A: So the token of compound for the bat token went up like crazy. Okay, so then what about the loser? So for the loser, we do have NFTX, which is basically an index for nfts. So I want to get some exposure to nfts and I was thinking of buying some NFTX. So maybe a good buying opportunity here, like a nice crash of 34%. Then Polka starter also went down, default here, Saffron finance. But overall, yeah, Sushi also, I also want to take a position in sushi. So maybe a nice buying opportunity here.
00:06:03.970 - 00:06:48.510, Speaker A: All right, so next we're going to continue with the news for Defi project. And so we start with Metamask. So Metamask Mobile introduced swaps which is a new feature to buy and sell tokens directly from your wallet. It's basically a Dex aggregator, like one inch, but integrated in your wallet. So super convenient. It's connected to many exchanges on Ethereum and it tries to find the best allocation so that you can get the best price and the lowest slippage possible. It also reduces your gas fees, since you just need to approve each token once, instead of approving the token for all the exchanges.
00:06:48.510 - 00:07:44.414, Speaker A: So the swap feature was already released before for the Metamask Chrome extension, and now it comes to mobile as well. So to give you a bit of background, Metamask already had some problem with the App Store on iOS, so they were removed from the App Store a few days in the past because Apple wasn't happy that you could bypass their built in payment system by using some dapps, which mean they cannot get their cut. So it's possible that the App Store tries to ban metamask again after they release this new feature. We will see. All right, so next we're going to continue with Sushiswap. Sushiswap is going multi chain and has just launched on Avalanche, which is an Ethereum killer. Sushi Swap is the largest decks on Ethereum by volume, so it's a huge win for Avalanche.
00:07:44.414 - 00:08:34.322, Speaker A: And actually since the launch of Avalanche Ethereum bridge on February eigth this year, the smart contract activity on Avalanche has boomed like crazy, with transaction increasing by more than 1000% and unique wallets increasing by 1007%. Next news from Anchor Finance. So this is a new protocol targeting a 20% fixed yield on stablecoin. Fixed yield. This is powered by staking return from multiple proof of stake blockchain. So they mentioned in the article that they cannot freeze account, but I don't know how they can be decentralized if they integrate with several blockchains. I'm really, really curious to read their white paper.
00:08:34.322 - 00:09:18.090, Speaker A: So this is a project by Terraform Labs, which is a company that has raised $25 million from top investors in the industry like Coinbase or Penterra Capital. So it really looked like a serious project to me. So then news from one inch. So one inch. The DeX aggregator released a new version, v three, and it allowed for some gas savings. For some trades, it allowed to save up to 10% compared to if you traded directly with Uniswap. So I find it really crazy that they can lower the transaction fees even though one each actually adds a layer of code on top of Uniswap.
00:09:18.090 - 00:09:51.814, Speaker A: So they probably have a system where they have an internal buffer of coins which allow you to directly tap into their liquidity instead of going to uniswap. That's the only explanation I found that explain why they can lower the gas fees. So by the way, I told you to buy some one inch token when it was super cheap a few months ago. And look what happened. Look what happened. It's beautiful. Look what happened.
00:09:51.814 - 00:10:32.710, Speaker A: A very nice pump. Yes, I made a video about one inch just around that time. All right, so then some news about gnosis. So gnosis released a new tool for Daos called snapshot. So this is integrated with gnosis safe, which is the most widely used multisig wallet in the industry. So this new tool allow users to more easily participate in the governance of DeFi protocol. It also comes with gas savings compared to if you directly use the governance interface of various DeFi protocols.
00:10:32.710 - 00:11:09.214, Speaker A: So then we have a ton of project that launched on binance smart chain this week. So we have zero x. So DRX is one of the earliest decentralized exchange on Ethereum, but it didn't get as much traction as Uniswap, mostly because it requires to pay transaction fees with their token. So that was their initial mistake. Since then they corrected it. But yeah, compared to Uniswap, they are much, much smaller. So we also have BZX, which is launching on binance smart chain.
00:11:09.214 - 00:11:54.818, Speaker A: So BZX, which became unfortunately famous, well infamous at the beginning of last year because they were one of the first protocol that got hacked with a flash loan. At that time, the industry didn't know yet the danger of flash loan. And then we also have Ave, who is talking with, giving a hint that it might expand to other blockchains. So they haven't mentioned explicitly binance smart chain, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be one of the first blockchain they expand to. And so another big news from Ave is that now they accept liquidity provider token from balancer and Uniswap. So that gives you some really nice opportunity of yield farming. You can make money as a liquidity provider on this project.
00:11:54.818 - 00:12:26.246, Speaker A: And on top of it, you can also lend ULP token to Ave. And so basically you make money twice. Double bubble. Then some news from Dune analytics. So this is a tool to analyze data on the blockchain. It's very useful if you want to find some trading patterns or if you an entrepreneur and you want to understand how users are using the blockchain. And so they just released their v two with a brand new interface.
00:12:26.246 - 00:12:51.362, Speaker A: So if you are interested in June analytics. You can check on my channel. I actually have a video just on that. It's a very powerful tool that really gives you a high level picture of what's happening on the blockchain. Then we have a couple of hacks this week. So first of Aron finance. So this is a stable coin on Binance smart chain, and they were hacked for 170k.
00:12:51.362 - 00:13:21.562, Speaker A: We also have another hack of pancake swap. So pancake swap, which is a clone of Uniswap, but on Binance March. And so you can buy and sell, yes, 20 tokens on it. DNS attack. So they were attacked with their DNS. And so basically, after this attack, it rerouted users to the website of hackers. So just to be clear, it's not a hack at the smart contract level, but at the front end level.
00:13:21.562 - 00:14:20.154, Speaker A: And so when users thought they were using the website of Pancake swap, it was actually the website of the hacker which created some malicious transactions that sends user tokens to a bad smart contract and just stole everything. And then we have another attack like this for creme Finance, which is a big lending protocol on binance smart chain. So exactly same hack as pancakeswap. So, yeah, lately we've seen a wave of hack on Binance smart chain, and that's because we have a lot of users. So, yeah, it attracts a lot of attention of. So since I'm showing you a tweet of CZ, the CEO of Binance, who talk about safety, I want to take advantage of this to enrich your crypto culture. So a few years ago, there was a hack on Binance, and CZ tweeted with, the misspelling funds are seifu.
00:14:20.154 - 00:14:33.570, Speaker A: And so it became a meme on Twitter right away. There are even some video about this. So, yeah, if you see this on. Yeah, now you know what it means. This is a crypto humor. Crypto humor. So don't use this.
00:14:33.570 - 00:15:18.034, Speaker A: Don't use crypto humor in a date. It will not work, I'm telling you. All right, we going to talk of NFT a little bit with mooncats. So, ten days ago, someone on Twitter found out about mooncat, which is an old blockchain game that was released even before cryptokitties. So in this project, you can get some cat NFT for free. It was forgotten in 2017, but after this guy on Twitter found out about it, there was a gold rush to get all of this free cat NFT, hoping it would have the same success as crypto punk. And so there were 25,000 of these nfts that were mintated for free.
00:15:18.034 - 00:16:07.410, Speaker A: And so now some of these NFTs, they trade at an average of $1,800. So, yeah, it's a nice airdrop for NFT people. All right, then we're going to talk of Elon Musk, who just put up for sale one of his tweets about NFT. So this is a tweet about NFT that he's selling as NFT. So we already have some bids going for $1 million. All right, so next we're going to talk of some controversy. So because NFT are getting so popular, there were some artists that started to criticize NFT, saying that it consume too much energy because you have to mine them and it's bad for the environment.
00:16:07.410 - 00:16:44.526, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm really not sure about this because at the same time, this artist might also, I don't know, take a plane or travel for some exhibition or some concert. If we don't do NFT, then we have to do art in another way that also consume energy. So, yeah, I'm really not sure about that. I don't really see that. Then we're going to talk of visa. So who is working on a bitcoin integration. So that's really super huge, really big announcement this week.
00:16:44.526 - 00:17:31.290, Speaker A: So let me quote the CEO. So he's saying we're trying to do two things. One is enable the purchase of bitcoin with visa, and secondly, working with bitcoin's wallet to allow bitcoin to be translated into a fiat currency and therefore immediately be able to be used at any of the 70 million places around the world where visa is accepted. So this is great. And I hope they continue with other crypto like ethereum. All right, next we're going to talk regulation with the FATF. So this is the Financial Action Task Force, an international organization for financial regulation.
00:17:31.290 - 00:18:14.918, Speaker A: So they released a new document where they basically suggested to implement the same anti money laundering rules as we already have for traditional finance, but for decentralized applications. And they also explicitly mention NFT. So of course that would be really bad for the industry. But no panic yet, because this FATF thing does not create rules that have any sort of legal status. It's just a set of recommendations that each country has to transcribe into their own legislation. So we're still very far to have any law against DeFi, but it's good to keep an eye on them then. Talking of other blockchain.
00:18:14.918 - 00:18:47.202, Speaker A: So for Cardano this week, we had a big pump for the ADA token going up 20% after the announcement of their listing on Coinbase pro. And there was another pump a couple of days later when it was announced to be listed on Coinbase, Coinbase Pro and Coinbase. Like two different announcements. So double pump for Ada. Very nice. All right, so that's it for now. Next we're going to do the Q a section.
00:18:47.202 - 00:19:17.470, Speaker A: So let me briefly remind you the free training on Defi. So this is going to be tomorrow. I put the link in the chat. So in this free training, I'm going to teach you how you can get started in Defi as a developer and how you can learn defy and how you can work at a Defi company. So you have to register because this will not be on YouTube tomorrow at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. All right, so Q and a time.
00:19:17.470 - 00:19:41.014, Speaker A: Let me scroll up in the chat. So who do we have here? Ayodeji. Hi, I forgot the nickname. Hi, Rudy Guilloni. Hey, Derek Adaba. Say, why don't you use brave browser? Yeah, good point, good point. Yama eth is a stable coin this week.
00:19:41.014 - 00:20:05.566, Speaker A: Hey, last week I found a game called Mooncat Rescue. It looks like a takeup of a cryptokitties. It also reminds me of Minecraft. Have you heard of it? Yeah, I just mentioned it before. Did you manage to get any of the free cat? Because now on average they sell for almost $2,000. Abracadabra melon is awesome. Yeah, I need to have a look at it.
00:20:05.566 - 00:20:26.114, Speaker A: I think some of the indices perform really well. Coinbase was considering to list. Huh, interesting. The coinbase pump. We should have a website for like just you monitor all the new listing of Coinbase, but I'm pretty sure it already exists. Actually, llama meme is far better store of value NFT wise. Bbk.
00:20:26.114 - 00:20:44.506, Speaker A: Are there any smart contract casino? You do have some games with smart contract. Oh, there is one of these game with super famous. It's basically nobody can lose. Everybody win. I forgot, I forgot. Maybe somebody remember my team. Coin Jr is the best.
00:20:44.506 - 00:21:10.830, Speaker A: Don't forget to subscribe. Thanks man, appreciate. Steve, have you checked out the Solana ecosystem? Not yet, not yet, but maybe I should. Do they have any active ecosystem with some defi stuff like this? I'm not aware of it. Smash the like button. Yes. Abracadabra for NFT is really good bands protocol for NFT.
00:21:10.830 - 00:21:38.742, Speaker A: I don't know that one lama saying Apple hates. Unfortunately, crypto radium is integrating sushiswap on Solana. Wow, that's great. Yeah, I mean, I think we have a good entry point for the sushi coin here because it went down this week, but there were a lot of really bullish announcement for sushi. So. Yeah, I'm quite interested in sushi. Abracadabra.
00:21:38.742 - 00:22:15.634, Speaker A: Question for Julian. What about the uniswap v three will be a game changer? Yes, absolutely. I think once uniswap v three is released on a big chain, uniswap has enough inertia that it can bring with it a lot of other defi protocol. And so that's when we're going to see some movement back from binance smart chain to ethereum l two. So that'd be a very interesting development. And also it will be a big boost for the price of ether when this happened. Paris brother, teach us how to deploy arbitrage contract on BNB.
00:22:15.634 - 00:22:32.350, Speaker A: Yes, I have a video on that flash loan arbitrage on binance smart chain. It was maybe one or two weeks ago. Yeah, check it out. Abracadabra. Question for junior. Any thought about graph link or. I think you already asked me last week, but no, I didn't check out this project.
00:22:32.350 - 00:22:54.900, Speaker A: Okay, but next week, promise I'll check it out. I had rug pool of $1.3 million for full sale. I don't know this project. Is it on finance? Matching two T-U-T-R dex rug pool, 2.4 million. I also don't know about that one.
00:22:54.900 - 00:23:17.340, Speaker A: All right, llama. British comedian John Cleese is selling his silly drawing as NFT as well. Yeah, I saw it. My God, you're so crazy. Rakadabra. I told you that when Cardano was at zero point 30 at missed the Cardano pump. That's too bad.
00:23:17.340 - 00:23:29.006, Speaker A: Mega Montana. Hey, Julian, I need help testing my contract. What resources should look at. I already have your course. You can check out on my channel. I have a video about testing. So.
00:23:29.006 - 00:23:54.520, Speaker A: Yeah, you type testing smart contract. I think I'm going to be the first result. Abracadabra is saying if you want a game for like a casino game on smart contract, you have the dice casino. I didn't know about that one. Osama, what do you think about lottery in NFT? I haven't heard of any project like this. So yeah, if this is your idea, go for it. Create the project.
00:23:54.520 - 00:24:21.342, Speaker A: Mr. V thought of uniswap v three. I am just expecting it. But there is nothing special about it to say except that it's going to be great when it comes out. But yeah, the main point would be the migration to l two. Chen Phil, 49, pull together for the lottery with no loss. Oh, yeah, that's the name I was looking for.
00:24:21.342 - 00:24:37.254, Speaker A: Yeah. Pull together. Yes. Okay, guys, well, I see no more questions. So we are going to wrap it up here. So thanks, everybody, for coming. And yes, if you haven't subscribed yet, subscribe to.
00:24:37.254 - 00:24:52.406, Speaker A: For the free training on DfI tomorrow. I put the link here the last time. Yes. So for those who subscribe, I will see you tomorrow at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. All right, guys, have a great week. I'll see you soon.
00:24:52.406 - 00:24:52.770, Speaker A: Bye.
