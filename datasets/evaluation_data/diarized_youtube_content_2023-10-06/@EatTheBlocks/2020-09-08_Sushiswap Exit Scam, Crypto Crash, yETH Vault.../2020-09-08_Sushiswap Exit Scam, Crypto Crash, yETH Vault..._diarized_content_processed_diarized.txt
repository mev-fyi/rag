00:00:15.380 - 00:00:47.748, Speaker A: We are live. Welcome for this weekly stream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi. For those who don't know me, I am Julian, your host. And on my channel, idoblocks, I teach blockchain development and how to find your first blockchain job. And before we continue, quick shout out to my two courses. So if you want to become a blockchain developer, six figure blockchain developer, that's my course. And if you want to learn how to do arbitrage, flash loan, I have another course on that.
00:00:47.748 - 00:01:30.684, Speaker A: For those who are here, say hi in the chat so I can see who is here and tell me where are you coming from? So that's it for the introduction. So as usual, I will start with Ethereum, then we'll do the news on Defi. And finally we'll do the Q A. So we'll start with the big news on Ethereum that the crypto crash, unfortunately. So we were having this amazing bull run. We thought we were going to the moon and it kind of taper off around like 480 in the past week. And then there was this huge decrease.
00:01:30.684 - 00:02:16.504, Speaker A: Hi Edgar. In the chat from South Africa. And so then there was this huge drop and now we are at about 340 something. So what the hell happened? Actually, nothing happened directly on crypto and what happened was on the stock market, it started to drop a lot. And unfortunately we have this correlation sometime between the crypto and the stock market. I don't really like this correlation. I would really love to see less correlation here because one of the first reason why we invest in blockchain, in cryptocurrency is because we want to have no correlation with the normal economy.
00:02:16.504 - 00:02:48.552, Speaker A: So on the one hand, okay, well, as I said, I don't like this correlation. On the other hand, central banks will support the stock market. So if crypto is correlated to stock market, actually indirectly, we benefit from this support from the central bank. So there is always a positive way to see it. So that's it for the price of ether. So next, let's have a look at what happened for gas prices. So gas prices are super important because the past few months they have been through the roof.
00:02:48.552 - 00:03:28.490, Speaker A: And that's the number one problem in terms of usability in defi. Hi, crypto barrog from the UK. So now, probably because the price of ether dropped a lot, we can also see that the gas fee went down a lot. So it's still very expensive to do a transaction on Ethereum, but at least now it's somewhat more acceptable, like not even a few days ago when gas price were like 200 or 300. Just if you want to send some ether it can cost you 15 or $20. Just insane. So hope this gas fee going to keep going down.
00:03:28.490 - 00:04:10.820, Speaker A: Talking of gas fee, there is this important use I saw. So apparently there are some Ethereum core developer who are discussing possible change in the gas rule to solve to reduce the gas fee. So I'm going to explain what it is exactly. So there is a feature in Ethereum that not many people know. When you save data in smart contracts, you need to pay for some gas. So most people know this. But what you might not know is that when we delete data from a smart contract, we have a refund of gas.
00:04:10.820 - 00:05:22.140, Speaker A: So some developers, some smart developers use this thing to do what we call gas tokens. So gas token, this is a mechanism to buy gas when it's at a cheaper rate and use it later when it's more expensive. So it works basically by creating some dummy smart contract that store a lot of data but nothing useful. So you create this smart contract with a lot of data when the gas is cheap and then when the gas is expensive, you delete this smart contract and you get a refund because you free up a lot of space on the blockchain and so you get a refund in gas. And so this way you can have a benefit from it. So in order to make this more accessible, some developer created some ES 20 token called gas token that do this automatically. But the problem is that some developer realize that these gas tokens, sometimes they take a lot of space on the blockchain and they contribute to make the gas price more expensive.
00:05:22.140 - 00:06:00.376, Speaker A: So core developer are considering removing this refund gas feature of Ethereum. So that means that would potentially break the gas tokens. So we'll see what they decide, but I think if it can benefit everybody, it's probably a good decision. All right, so that's it for the gas token. So next we're going to zoom in in defi. So as you can see, that's the first week since a very long time that the total market cap of defi went down. Well, actually, compared to last week, it's slightly more.
00:06:00.376 - 00:06:37.360, Speaker A: So. Last week it was 7.778. But we had this peak and this big drop. And this is not really defy itself that is dropping. It's almost entirely because of the drop of ether, which itself is because of the drop in stock market. So here in the chart, if you change this to ether, you can see that the drop in terms of ether is much less. So that shows you that the drop in the defi market is mostly due to the decrease of price of ether.
00:06:37.360 - 00:07:15.512, Speaker A: But actually the interest is still there, no problem. Maker went back to the first place and Ave went down a lot. So Ave was number one and there was this huge decrease like -70% it doesn't really change my long term opinion for Ave. I mean this is still one of the best project in d five. So I'm sure we're going to see Ave coming back to the top very fast. So let's not be too worried here. Next, let's see the situation for the price of the defi token.
00:07:15.512 - 00:07:47.192, Speaker A: So here I'm using the page of Congeco. They have a page for Defi token. So as you can see, that was really bad week for Defi token. We are -40% for some of this. That's pretty violent. It's probably going to continue as long as the decrease of ether will continue. And I think this might be a good thing because the price of this token will increase way too fast.
00:07:47.192 - 00:08:19.908, Speaker A: So maybe some buying opportunity here. All right, next, quick situation on the rate. So Dai is doing pretty well on Ave and DyDX like 7%, 6%. So this is some pretty nice return. And you can see that USDC is much less. So most of the time the rate of die are quite above USDC. Oh and ether on Ave is at 6%.
00:08:19.908 - 00:08:46.872, Speaker A: This is weird because usually the rate for ether is super low. Interesting. All right, so that's it for the rate. So next I'm going to move on to the main piece of news for this week. So the sushi, give me some sushi. So Sushi was announced to be the Uniswap killer. So this is basically a fork of Uniswap.
00:08:46.872 - 00:09:25.444, Speaker A: So what they did, they took the code of Uniswap, they rebranded it for their own name, they took the same smart contract and they introduced a new feature. So they reward liquidity provider with governance token. So nothing new here, this is just basic yield farming. So they just basically took Uniswap and added yield farming on top of it. So it's nothing really too innovative actually. The v three of Uniswap will probably have a governance token with yield farming. A lot of people invested.
00:09:25.444 - 00:10:11.588, Speaker A: As soon as Sushiswap launched, the price of the governance token went through the roof. It was created by an anonymous developer. So already when you see anonymous developer and you see a lot of people get excited on the project, just in a matter of days, that should be a red flag. And of course, what had to happen happened. So this anonymous developer, chef Nomi, announced that he will leave the project just after having sold all his governance tokens. So there was a pre mine, I believe. So that was supposed to be to fund the development of the protocol.
00:10:11.588 - 00:10:43.570, Speaker A: And he was the one who controlled all these tokens and he sold them. And I think he made something like 13 million. So that's pretty insane considering that they probably only work a few weeks to fork Uniswap. So it's quite a nice highly rate. I think his message here was quite hypocritical. Blah, blah, blah. You don't intend to do any, I'm sorry I'm a semi scammer, but please treat me like a normal person is basically what he's saying.
00:10:43.570 - 00:11:52.264, Speaker A: And then, of course, people were really furious. Okay, well, maybe I'm being a little bit tough here. It's not a scam per se in terms of he didn't steal the money of anybody, but still, as people were not expecting him to just pump and dump the token like this, because now who want to participate in this protocol, really? So in the meantime, after he did this, he transferred control to someone else who is not an anonymous developer. So that's the CEO of another DeFi project, or FTX. Shitty behavior here can be considered as a scam, but still, a lot of people were disappointed. And so what happened with sushiswap? This is part of a broader movement of what we start to call the food Defi on a crypto Twitter. So there are many other projects like this, which basically what they do is they take an existing DeFi project, they fork it.
00:11:52.264 - 00:12:30.340, Speaker A: So that means they copy paste the code, they rebrand it, and they slap on top of it a feature of yield farming with a governance token. And of course, nobody cares about the governance token. They just want to get the coin and sell it right away and make money. So, example of this we have. Okay, so this guy, actually, they haven't done anything bad. So I don't want to say anything bad, but I just want to say this is part of this movement of the food defi. So cream finance, they are forking compound finance, and they have put a governance token on top of it.
00:12:30.340 - 00:13:13.648, Speaker A: And we also had yam before. So the problem with yam, what happened if you haven't followed, is that was basically a sort of mix between maker DL and ample force. And so they were really successful. But within a couple of days, very quickly, there was a bug in the so the yam experiment failed pretty fast. So here we have different example of food defi project that failed. So sushishwa, because of the guy who demoed the token yam, because of the bug cream finance. So far so good.
00:13:13.648 - 00:13:44.504, Speaker A: I hope it's going to be fine. And there are a couple of other stuff I think we are like something like kimchi or some other stuff. So whenever you see something about food in Defi and some anonymous developer and some governance tokens, some yield farming. Careful. I'm not saying this is a scam, but careful. You can play with it, but don't put too much money in it because we don't really know what this is about. All right, so that's it for the food in Defi.
00:13:44.504 - 00:14:35.736, Speaker A: So now we're going to move on to Ave and Realty, who are doing a partnership together. Realty is a blockchain project to put real estate on the blockchain. And so with this partnership, you'll be able to use your real estate as collateral with Ave. So yeah, I think that's pretty cool. We see this merger of the blockchain world with the real world. So I think that's really bullish for crypto because a lot of people who have real estate now, they can use their existing real estate to create, to borrow token on the blockchain. So it will help to fuel the funding of DeFi.
00:14:35.736 - 00:15:05.664, Speaker A: So that's awesome. Next, I want to move on to another cool news. Andre Conrey, the founder of Yon Finance, who is one of the most respected builder in the DeFi space. So he explained a new vault on yon finance called Y Eth. So what is this thing? So yarn finance. If you never heard of this, that's a way to. We call this a DeFi aggregator or yield enhancer.
00:15:05.664 - 00:15:43.052, Speaker A: So the idea is that there are many people who want to make money in DeFi, but they don't want to bother to study the different protocol. So on yuan finance you can invest some stablecoin like Dai or USDC. And yuan Finance will automatically allocate your coin to the protocol that have the highest yield. So they are integrated with a couple of them. So on the lending side, your token can be lend on Ave compound. DYDX can also be invested as a liquidity provider on uniswap balancer and curve. And on top of it also you get the liquidity incentives.
00:15:43.052 - 00:16:14.552, Speaker A: So if there is any yield farming on this protocol, then it also comes to boost your yield. So far it was only possible to invest in this with a stable coin. But now you can invest in ether. And so here, this is the gift of it. So for the ether vault, basically your ether is going to be invested to mint some die. So on the macro dao system. So technically that means you borrow some die against your ether.
00:16:14.552 - 00:16:57.204, Speaker A: So maybe you have, let's say you have for $150 of ether, then you can borrow for $100 of die. And with this die, this die is reinvested to the y die vault. So that's another vault of the yon finance. And this vault, this is the one that will actually do the investment to the other DeFi protocol. So basically y ETH is a thin wrapper around wide eye. This is a convenience, but I think that's quite smart because there are a lot of people who are sitting on ETH and they couldn't use yarn finance. So it's going to increase the liquidity of learn finance.
00:16:57.204 - 00:17:47.044, Speaker A: It's pretty smart. All right, so that's it for why ETh. So next I want to talk about the DeFi Composite index of Binance. So here, this is an announcement of Binance, who announced that we're adding a few new tokens to this index. So the DeFi composite index of binance, this is an investment product that allow you to invest in a basket of DeFi tokens in a very easy way, so you don't have to individually pick the different DeFi token that you want. You just invest in this index and you get an average of the yield of all these tokens. And technically this is what they call a perpetual contract.
00:17:47.044 - 00:18:27.190, Speaker A: So that means you can have some leverage, up to 50 leverage. So careful, because 50 leverage, that's really insane. You can lose your deposit really quickly. But I think that for people who want to invest in DeFi tokens and don't want to bother to do the transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, then they can go to finance and you can save a lot on gas fee. And that's a very easy way to just collect the average yield of the market. So this way you are sure that it's going to be harder to make some mistakes. Probably on average, all of these tokens going to have a really nice return.
00:18:27.190 - 00:19:08.288, Speaker A: So that's it for this, for Defi and Ethereum. So now I'm going to focus on the news for developers. So there is a new version of solidity, the programming language for smart contract. So now we can write function at the file level. So this is called free function and the id is to replace libraries. So here in your file, you can write directly your function, and after that you can write several smart contract that make use of this function. So this function cannot access directly the state variable of your smart contract.
00:19:08.288 - 00:19:54.000, Speaker A: If you access this, then you need to pass a pointer like this. Otherwise if this is for integer, then in a simple variable you can pass them directly. So yeah, new feature of solidity. Next we have news that there is a new maintainer for Webster Js. Webster JS this is the most popular Javascript library to interact with Ethereum. So chainsafe, which is famous blockchain projects, receive a grant from the Ethereum foundation to become a maintainer of Webster JS. So that's a good news because Webster JS had a lot of criticism in the past because the Ethereum foundation didn't care about this project enough.
00:19:54.000 - 00:20:35.164, Speaker A: So there were only one or two developers working on this project and there were a lot of bugs going from one version to the other every time. It was very painful, a lot of people complain. And that's actually the reason why there was this, one of the reason why there was this other project created, which is called ether. So that's a sort of alternative to Webster JS. Now they are almost equally popular 50 50, but this grant for Web three js is going to reboost a little bit this library. So yeah, it's good news. And finally compound announced that they are releasing a new JavaScript library called compound JS.
00:20:35.164 - 00:21:20.350, Speaker A: So that's basically the equivalent of the Uniswap SDK, but for compound. So with this it will be much easier to interact with the compound protocol. All right, so now I'm going to move on to Q A, but before so, quick reminder for people who are interested in my two course. This is the link for six figure blockchain developer and the link for profitable flash loan. So let me scroll up and look at the message. So Cryptobarog asking me would you consider doing more on NFT, how to code, how to deploy and market, maybe looking at the gaming community? Yeah, could look into this. Yeah, it's a good idea.
00:21:20.350 - 00:21:55.620, Speaker A: Hi Almikael. So Almikael said putting your house as collateral is scary. Yeah, of course. But I don't think you do this if this is where you actually live. Maybe, probably it's more if you have some other real estates that you use that you just go from time to time, but they are not your primary residence, maybe your secondary residence. You could do this and maybe you wouldn't do anything too crazy on the blockchain. Kim hi from Japan.
00:21:55.620 - 00:22:03.012, Speaker A: Great life. Hey, thank you, Jung. Then we have tripati. Hi. Thanks. Like this. Hi, Julian.
00:22:03.012 - 00:22:20.450, Speaker A: Summer camp introduced me to this. Yeah, summer is a good time to get into blockchain. So. Really say. Also, I think ethers 4.0 is the only word that support native apps. I think now we are at ethers 5.0.
00:22:20.450 - 00:22:37.872, Speaker A: I didn't know that. Support native. Native app. Interesting. Abdul saying, I haven't had any luck with web3 and native apps I haven't tried. But I believe in you. I mean, yeah, doing native blockchain app, this is really something more advanced.
00:22:37.872 - 00:22:58.520, Speaker A: Cryptogas. Yo. Crypto, baroque ratata or DJ solar. I think you mean MC solar. Do you mean the MC solar? Yeah. Almika. Imagine a boat liquidating your cdp.
00:22:58.520 - 00:23:12.880, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Oh, man, that'll be terrible. My God, what a terrible future. Mr. Han Solo, I'm doing the exact thing for NFT art music. I use unstoppable domain pinata ens. Oh, interesting.
00:23:12.880 - 00:24:08.944, Speaker A: Yeah, it's good to know. All right, guys, any more questions? Can you share some details on using flash loan for merging tradings on platform like DYDX, et cetera? Okay, so in my course on Flash loan, so we basically use the flash loan feature of DyDX to do arbitrage between uniswap and Kyber, but to use flash loan for my. Okay, so there is no point in using flash loan with margin trading because already with flash loan, you have all the money you want in the road. It's like, flash loan is like margin trading on steroids. So, yeah, what you want is how to use flash loan with the flash loan feature of DyDX or the flash loan feature of Aave or the Flash loan feature of uniswap. Yeah. That's what you want.
00:24:08.944 - 00:24:19.530, Speaker A: Yeah. Crypto. Barrack. Yeah, this is McSola. Yeah, I'm surprised you know him. So I've subscribed for your program, but didn't receive any email. After you.
00:24:19.530 - 00:24:37.228, Speaker A: Okay, please send me. Okay, I think you send me an email. I will look at your email cryptogurt saying, I follow two years from Portugal. Wow, you've been following my channel for two years? Yeah. Cheers to cryptogurts. Yeah. This is awesome.
00:24:37.228 - 00:24:56.424, Speaker A: I love when I meet people who've been following me for such a long time. Yeah. Crypto. Are you on GN discord? Oh, yeah. I think crypto barrack is talking of the private chat of the ether block student. Yeah. So when you take one of my course, a six figure blockchain developer, all the course on flash loan.
00:24:56.424 - 00:25:19.640, Speaker A: Then you get access to a private chat on discord with all the other students. So that's pretty cool because that's pretty lively people. Students help each other. They give each other new ideas. I'm always very surprised about the quality of my students. I mean, these guys are really smart. And, yeah, it's super cool to hang out on the chat.
00:25:19.640 - 00:25:39.580, Speaker A: And then now Nino Nomad say, hey, bro. Hey, Nino. All right, guys, any more question? No? All right, well, I think we're going to wrap here. So thanks, everybody, for coming here, and I'll see you soon on my channel for another video. Cheers. Peace.
