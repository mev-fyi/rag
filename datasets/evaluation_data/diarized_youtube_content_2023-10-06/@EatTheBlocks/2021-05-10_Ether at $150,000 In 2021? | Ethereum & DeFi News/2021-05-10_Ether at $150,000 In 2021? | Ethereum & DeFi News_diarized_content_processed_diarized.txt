00:00:05.370 - 00:00:47.690, Speaker A: You and we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and D five. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. And if you don't know me, I'm Julian and on my channel, itoblocks, I teach blockchain development. And hi to everybody in the chat so quickly for new people here, I launched a token for the channel, the ETB token, so that is on binance smart chain. I gave this token for free in an airdrop and the first feature of this token will be to vote for the videos of the channel on YouTube.
00:00:47.690 - 00:01:30.466, Speaker A: So I'm still working on the app to do the voting. So that's going to be the Dao app. So I'm going to release it probably at the end of this week. This week I need to test it first. So probably that next week we're going to do the first vote for the channel. We already have quite a lot of activity on the token here, so I guess maybe this is some transfers on Pancakeswap because I know that someone created a liquidity pool on Pancakeswap. So it's all you can do now for the token, but from next week it will have a real utility.
00:01:30.466 - 00:02:07.454, Speaker A: You'll be able to use it for voting. Okay, so we are going to start with the price of ether. So absolutely fantastic week for ether. Once again, it's two weeks in a row that is absolutely mind blowing. So we reach $4,000 this week. Ether is really going to the moon. So since the beginning of the year, ether has increased of more than 400%, which can be compared to roughly 100% increase for bitcoin.
00:02:07.454 - 00:02:32.886, Speaker A: So much, much better for ether. So ether has a market cap of about $480,000,000,000. That's more than the market cap of JPMorgan. Very, very important milestone. And it's about 44% of the market cap of bitcoin. But just a few months ago it was just 20%. So ether is very quickly catching up on bitcoin.
00:02:32.886 - 00:03:17.260, Speaker A: It's very interesting development. Another very bullish metric. So ether reached almost 8 million active addresses on Sunday, which is above the previous record of 7.14 million reached on January 2018. Another important fact is that this time the rise of ether is totally uncorrelated to either bitcoin or the stock market, and it's very different from previous profit increase. This time ether is really going its own way, which means that the recent increase is much more significant. So how can we explain this? So let's have a look at first.
00:03:17.260 - 00:04:21.950, Speaker A: Let me see first, a big reason is the recent surge in interest from institutional. So institutional finally start to realize that ether is the real deal, not bitcoin. And a proof of this is the existence of a so called Coinbase premium, which means that currently it's more expensive to buy ether on Coinbase versus other exchanges. And that's because institutionals prefer to use Coinbase to buy ether, because Coinbase is more regulated. We also have another proof that there is a very high interest from institutional for ether, and that's because of the option market. So the option market is typically driven by institutionals, and we can see that the option market is at the highest ever for ether. So in terms of open interest, we are above $3 billion.
00:04:21.950 - 00:05:16.910, Speaker A: So that's much more than just a year ago. And finally, another reason for the recent increase in ether could be what we call a gamma squeeze. So a lot of option traders sold so called naked calls, meaning that they didn't hedge themselves, they just sell the calls, never thinking that ether could go up so fast. But not ether went up way past the expectation they have to buy some ether in panic to meet their obligation. And so this is a huge buying pressure for ether. So where will ether go next? So, to answer this question, we can ask Gary Tan. So Gary Tan is one of the early investors in Coinbase, and he famously turned $300,000 into 2 billion.
00:05:16.910 - 00:06:03.242, Speaker A: So this guy predicts that ether will reach $10,000. But is $10,000 enough? No, we want more. So actually we might go above ten k, because Derrybit, which is a crypto exchange for option, introduced the highest strike ever for the option on ether. They introduced a strike at $50,000 for next year. So that means that some people are now betting that ether will reach $50,000 next year. But is $50,000 enough? No, we still want more. So that's why we have an even more crazy prediction.
00:06:03.242 - 00:06:48.854, Speaker A: So someone called Nikhil Shamapan wrote an 80 page report to back a claim that ether will reach 150k. So it's not the first person who would justify a super high prediction. A couple of weeks ago, we also had Hathor Hayes, ex CEO of Bitfinex, who also wrote a long article to explain his super high prediction for Ether. I think his top prediction was something like $400,000. So we start to have more and more famous people making some super bullish prediction. Next, some news for Ethereum 2.0. So nano ledger now supports signing transaction for the deposit contract of Ethereum 2.0.
00:06:48.854 - 00:07:31.850, Speaker A: So this allow you to stake your ether from your nano ledger. Before, if you wanted to stake, you had to send your ether from your nano ledger to another address, which make you lose the safety of your hardware wallet if you're going to do staking. So it's a big improvement for nano ledger. In terms of gas fee, we are still at a low level, even though we had like two big spike. That's because of the increase in trading of Ethereum, but still low gas. Gas price is low. However, because the price of ether is so high, the total transaction fee are still very high, unfortunately.
00:07:31.850 - 00:08:14.150, Speaker A: Then let's look at the market cap of Defi. So we keep increasing, and that is largely due to the increase in ether. Because if we look in the number of ETH locked, we had this big decrease in the last few weeks. So I don't know why it's going down, but ideally we want to lock as many ether in DFI as possible. But anyway, in terms of total value locked, we are slowly but surely approaching 100 billion. So probably before this summer we'll reach $100 billion locked in Defi. It's a huge milestone.
00:08:14.150 - 00:08:39.506, Speaker A: Then, in terms of the top DFI coin, what do we have this week? We have a mostly winner, 200% vote. This coin. I don't know that one, actually. I don't know many of this project here. Let me see. Do we have any famous project that went up a lot? Yeah, we have a chain link here. One inch, that's it.
00:08:39.506 - 00:09:13.594, Speaker A: But for the really crazy gain, basically a lot of new project. And for the loser, not many loser this week, nothing too spectacular. Yeah, cream finance here -20% dodo finance, saffron finance. Yeah. So positive week for ether, positive week for DFI token as well. Then let's have a look at news from Defi project. We're going to start with Uniswap, which is the main news of the week.
00:09:13.594 - 00:10:05.706, Speaker A: So Uniswap v three launched just a few days ago. I already explained the main updates of Uniswap V three in a live stream a couple of weeks ago. But in a nutshell, the biggest change is called concentrated liquidity, which make Uniswap more capital efficient. So basically Uniswap V three as an lp, you don't just provide the two assets of the pool, but you also have to specify the price range where your liquidity will be active. So for example, you can decide to provide liquidity only between 3000 and $4,000 for ether. This means that we need a lower amount of assets locked to provide the same liquidity and get the same level of trading fees. And a good metrics to measure this capital efficiency is the ratio of trading volume to total value locked.
00:10:05.706 - 00:11:00.522, Speaker A: And for a certain value locked, we want the highest trading volume possible. So we want this ratio to be high. And so here in this tweet, the founder of Uniswap shows us that the ratio for v three is almost four times higher than for v two and almost 44 times higher than for v one. So you can see that there is a huge improvement from v one to v three. And this will probably help Uniswap reassert its leadership in the dex ecosystem, especially in front of Sushiswap. And since Uniswap is so important in the dfi ecosystem, this is going to be very bullish. So next step will be when Uniswap will migrate to l two chain, and they are planning to do that by migrating to optimism this summer.
00:11:00.522 - 00:11:47.290, Speaker A: And when this happens, it's going to be huge because Uniswap will catch up with spuncake swap and get back its place as the first Dex across all blockchains. And last thing, if you want to analyze the data for Uniswap, check out this dashboard on dune analytics. If you never heard of dune analytics, it's a great tool for creating dashboards for blockchain and defi. And I actually have a video about it on my channel. Oh, yeah. Still another thing to show you about uniswap V three. So check out this tool if you want to play around with the different parameter as a liquidity provider, because for Uniswap V three, it's a little bit more technical.
00:11:47.290 - 00:12:35.382, Speaker A: You don't just provide your LP token, but you also have to decide which range you want to provide your liquidity for. So for that, you need a dashboard to help you play around with the parameter. So here we have a very nice tool for LP liquid provider for Uniswap V three. Okay, so next we have some news from Maker Dao. So, huge step for Maker Dao, the creators of the Dai stable coin. So the Maker Dao foundation has sent $400 million of their treasury to the Dao smart contract of maker. So now the DAO is in control of the funds and it has become a true decentralized project.
00:12:35.382 - 00:13:26.842, Speaker A: So building a true decentralized ecosystem is really hard. So usually projects are very cautious and proceed very incrementally until they become totally decentralized. Well, for Maker Dao, they have finally completed the last step in their decentralization. So it's going to be super interesting to see how their DAO experiment will cut for them, how the funds are deployed and if it leads to better decisions compared to when it was centralized. Next, we have a new project called Impermax Finance. So this is a new lending protocol that accepts the LP tokens of other project as collateral. So we already saw some protocols like Ave accepting LP tokens as collateral.
00:13:26.842 - 00:14:02.630, Speaker A: But Impermax finance goes even further and accept an even wider range of LP tokens. So this is a great opportunity for yield farming. You become an LP liquidity provider on Uniswap. You get your LP tokens and then you lend them on Impermax and you get some extra yield. And then some news from Quinta Finance. So this is a new derivatives protocol. It allow you to trade some derivatives and also some real world assets.
00:14:02.630 - 00:14:39.140, Speaker A: So for example, stock, let me see, stock forex, stock forex, et cetera. So this makes me think of the Wall street bet Dap that was released a couple of weeks ago. So now real finance, I mean real finance, I mean centralized finance is coming to DeFi. So we start to see more and more of this. And so Quinta, under the hood, leveraged the synthetics protocol to give you access to all these tokens. And they recently reached $1 billion in total volume. So this is growing fast.
00:14:39.140 - 00:15:31.394, Speaker A: Then some news from Stockx. So Stockx is one of the leading technology for l two chains on Ethereum, and they reach $1 billion traded across two side chain, including the side chain of DYDX. So do some research on the L2 solutions, because all this project, their tokens are going to increase like crazy. So that's from the investment perspective and also from a developer perspective, of course, this is going to become more and more relevant. Then some news from Rari Capital. So this is a yield aggregator which was unfortunately hacked for 15 million. So this involved a flash loan on DYDX and another yield aggregator called Alpha Omera.
00:15:31.394 - 00:16:05.294, Speaker A: So it was pretty complex. It happened across Ethereum and binance smart chain. So it's the first cross chain hacked that we hear about. Then some news from value defy. So value Defi was hacked $10 million a first time this week, just because a single line of code was missing. That's probably the most expensive line of code ever. So they were hacked a second time in the same week for another $11 million.
00:16:05.294 - 00:16:41.126, Speaker A: And before that they were already hacked of $7 million in November last year. And so later someone found something interesting about them. So apparently one of the co founder of this project was a pet actress. So at this stage, with so much incompetency and so much sly, I don't really trust them at all. So did they hack themselves? Well, it's totally possible. Totally possible. Then wanted to show you this website, crypto fees.
00:16:41.126 - 00:17:18.120, Speaker A: So they just released their v two. It's a website show the fees of various blockchain and defi project. So here you can see that Ethereum is the blockchain that received the most trading fee, transaction fee way more than bitcoin. And very interestingly, uniswap V two has more trading transaction fee, I mean, trading fee compared to the transaction fee of bitcoin. So that really show you the power of Ethereum. You have a single d five protocol with more transaction fee than the whole bitcoin chain. It's absolutely huge.
00:17:18.120 - 00:17:49.060, Speaker A: Then what do we have, Gary? I think I missed a tab here. Where did I put this? Okay. I think I missed a tab. Yeah, sorry about that. Yeah. So basically, the NFT news of the week is a new NFT project of Gary Vaynerchuk. So he released his own NFT project.
00:17:49.060 - 00:18:26.454, Speaker A: And so, yeah, it will be a sort of fun club. Basically, when you have the token of Gary, you have access to his conference and some events. So, yeah, it's always cool to see famous people popularize blockchain in any way they can. Then some news from Coinbase. So Coinbase is closing its office in San Francisco. I actually wonder if it's the first public company to not have any headquarters at all. So it comes in the wave of an exodus outside out of San Francisco.
00:18:26.454 - 00:19:11.900, Speaker A: So a lot of people are going out, going to the SaaS in the US, in Austin, Texas, and also in the southeast in Miami, which is becoming a new crypto hub. So, yeah, really? First big company without a headquarter. Very cool to see this. Then some news from stablecoin. So, Tether, the largest stable coin with 64% of market share, reach $1 trillion of transaction volume since the beginning of this huge milestone. So the amount and the activity of stablecoin just keeps going up. And we now have about 80 billions of stablecoins in circulation, and it's growing really fast.
00:19:11.900 - 00:19:41.554, Speaker A: Then some news from SNP. So SNP released three crypto indices, one for bitcoin, one for ETH, and also a so called megacab combo. So that's a combo of the first two. And they're using a partner that provides crypto data to Wallstreet called Luca. So we already discussed Luca before. They basically want to become the next Bloomberg, but for enterprise crypto. So this is not the first crypto indices for Wall street.
00:19:41.554 - 00:20:41.570, Speaker A: There are already some, like a crypto index from Bloomberg and another one from galaxy. So these indices are very important because they will allow big players from Wall street to start investing in crypto, and that's going to be a lot of money. Then some news from the ETF world. So van Eck, which is an ETF startup, has filed an application for an Ethereum ETF to the SEC. So van Eck already filed an application for a bitcoin ETF and is currently being reviewed by the SEC. So if this new application is approved, it would be the first ether ETF in the US, but not in the world because we already have some ether ETF in Canada. Okay, so next, some news from regulators in the UK.
00:20:41.570 - 00:21:22.358, Speaker A: So a big regulator in the UK won investor against investing in crypto by saying that they risk losing all of their money. And someone on Twitter post reply by this chart. So that's basically the purchasing power of the british pound during the last millennium. Yeah, so very interesting. Okay, so next we're going to do the Q and A. So let me go up in the chat, see what we have here. So we have to.
00:21:22.358 - 00:21:42.726, Speaker A: Hey, man, we have IO deji. Hey, we have a plv. Hey, Joan. We have Constantin, we have TShx. We have a thinking blockchain. Freeman, Nilesh Dixon R 24. We have Dixon Paris.
00:21:42.726 - 00:22:31.580, Speaker A: Bitcoin delight. So bitcoin delight is saying, is there a big doing options for 365 days? I believe so. Because the strike at 50k was for 2022. So, yeah, I believe so. TShX saying you can buy cryptocurrency on Amazon, such as storage coins and collectible. Did you know think, do you mean like some physical coin? And they have a private key, but you need to trust that nobody ever copied the private key. Are you talking about this? Nilesh? What can you say about the bank of England governor? Oh, yeah, I just commented on that.
00:22:31.580 - 00:23:06.962, Speaker A: Corporal pool, will eIP 1559 help with the gas fees? Yeah. Or will they still be high but consistent and predictable? Yeah. So it's supposed to help with the gas fees. It's not going to be the ultimate solution. Of course. The L two chain are going to help way more in the short term, but still EIP 1559 is a step in the correct direction. It's maybe going to help like 20%, but 80% of the help is going to come from l two chain.
00:23:06.962 - 00:23:47.620, Speaker A: What about Dao? Maker. Yeah, I already talked about this just before jpool saying I'm new and I get money jet for this man. What do you mean? Freeman, cryptoverse, you are number one. Thanks, man. Constantine, could you make some videos about cloud storage for blockchain app, please? Thank you. Cloud storage for blockchain app. What is special about this? Do you mean things like ipfs? Actually, ipfs is not a blockchain, but I don't know if it's what you mean.
00:23:47.620 - 00:24:05.370, Speaker A: Iudegi. Too many rush projects out there. Yeah, I mean, you know, this is a bull market now. So it's a big, big rush right now. No, then TP. Hey, man, you're right. Let me know if I can be a tester on the DaO or whatever.
00:24:05.370 - 00:24:28.318, Speaker A: I'm still leveling up my skills before I send you my proposal on teaching. Okay? Yeah, for sure. So I'm probably going to start the testing for the students of my courses. They're going to do some internal testing, and if it works fine, then I'm going to release this publicly. Thanks for the help. Abracadabra. Wow, this ETF is huge.
00:24:28.318 - 00:24:43.734, Speaker A: Biggest news ever. Yeah, for sure. I think one of the two biggest crypto event this year. Okay, so you have like Coinbase IPO. That was one of the biggest news. Then you're going to have the bitcoin ETF, ether ETF. Yeah.
00:24:43.734 - 00:25:11.946, Speaker A: These are going to be monumental. So out of the three major event in the crypto world this year, we already had one and we still have two to go. So, yeah, we still have a lot of increase potentially. Which is better, Ada or Polkadot? Polkadot. Ada at this point. Yeah, it's kind of a joke, really. Plv.
00:25:11.946 - 00:25:38.150, Speaker A: Julian, technical question regarding security. What are the Access limit that a smart contract has when it's approved using a wallet? I think it's very difficult to answer in the general sense. I mean, it really depends how the smart contract is written. Yeah, it's really difficult. I need to see the code to answer you. Exactly. Basically, you do what you want with a smart contract.
00:25:38.150 - 00:26:10.206, Speaker A: Could it access the different tokens? Because beyond the one used in a transaction, if you approve a smart contract to spend one token, you can just spend this token. That's it. Abracadabra. Let me skip this. Marco IO either block. Your solidity course has really helped me out to learn how to deploy and create smart contracts. Great to hear this abracadabra question for Julian.
00:26:10.206 - 00:26:54.560, Speaker A: Where are we standing with London? Oh, you mean the London folk? Yeah, I think everything is going smoothly so I think it's going to happen without a hiccup. Yeah. Parasnas, what do you think about Phantom network? Actually, one of my students who was released a big project on the phantom network and I is getting some help from their think. I think Phantom network. I think their niche is privacy. That's all I can say. But I haven't studied more than that.
00:26:54.560 - 00:27:22.258, Speaker A: Fish. YouTube guys, do you know any safe farms on mean? Don't waste your time on Tron, really. Just focus on ethereum and binance. Smart chain like Tron is just finished. There is nothing on Tron. Okay, dream merchants. Best arbitrage bot for defi with multi token and multi platforms.
00:27:22.258 - 00:27:45.326, Speaker A: Wow. I mean, it's impossible to give a general answer. You have to do your own research based on your tolerance in risk and what you want to trade, et cetera. Freeman, cryptovers will give you free lesson. Nilesh, what can you say about eos? Yeah, forget about it. Eos is done. Dan Larimer left the project.
00:27:45.326 - 00:28:12.358, Speaker A: Nobody use it anymore. Us is just a waste of time. All right, guys. All right, I think we have no more questions, so we going to call it a day. So thanks, everybody, for coming to this live stream, and I will see you soon on eat the blocks. Have a great day. Have a great week.
00:28:12.358 - 00:28:12.866, Speaker A: Bye.
