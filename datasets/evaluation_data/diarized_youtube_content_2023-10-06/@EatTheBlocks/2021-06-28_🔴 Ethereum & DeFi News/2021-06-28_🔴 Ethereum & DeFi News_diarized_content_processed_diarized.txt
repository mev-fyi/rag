00:00:08.640 - 00:00:31.390, Speaker A: And we're live. Welcome for this weekly stream on the greatest and latest news in Ethereum and Defi. I'm Julian, your host. And if this is your first time here on Etherblocks, I teach blockchain development. Hi everybody. In the chat we have George, we have Daryl, Eric, Tshx, Dan, action photo divanshu. Hi guys, guys.
00:00:31.390 - 00:01:12.090, Speaker A: So before we start very briefly, so I'd like to mention that this week we're going to have a live training on how to create a fork of safemoon. So how to create your token on the binance smart chain. I've already done this live training about one month ago and I'm going to do another one this week. This is going to be Thursday. So if you want to attend, check out the link I just put in the chat. And second thing. So last week I did a live stream where I launched a new concept called Idoblocks Project.
00:01:12.090 - 00:01:58.164, Speaker A: So I'm not going to re explain. You can check out the live stream, but if you want to participate for the first project we're going to build together, you can register on this mailing list. It's totally free to participate. All right, so let's start with ether. So this week for Ethereum, so we had this news about EIP 1559, which is about to happen in a couple of weeks. So this is going to be a huge improvement in the ecosystem of Ethereum. So improve ux for the users because users will not have to deal to manually set the transaction fee right now.
00:01:58.164 - 00:02:36.560, Speaker A: It's a big issue for Ethereum user. They always have to decide what's the gas price and sometime it's not enough and the transaction fails. And obviously we cannot really have mainstream adoption with this. So with EIP 1559, the complexity is going to be moved to the wallets and it's going to be huge improvement for user. Here in this Twitter thread, Evan Vaness explained the different benefit of EIP one five nine. And of course it's going to be super bullish for Ethereum. Then.
00:02:36.560 - 00:03:21.212, Speaker A: Other news, there is this lightweight Ethereum client that is being developed by status. It's called fluffy. So lightweight clients, they are very important because they allow to improve the decentralization. So for bitcoin, we already have lightweight clients, but for Ethereum, because the technology is more complex, we didn't have them yet. That means that a lot of wallets actually rely on Ethereum nodes that are run in a centralized way, like for example infira. And so that means you need to have trust in these nodes that are run centrally. But in the future, we won't need access to these nodes for wallets.
00:03:21.212 - 00:04:09.180, Speaker A: We could have this lightweight Ethereum node that run, for example, on mobile. So that's extremely important for decentralization. Then here we have an important research that was done about the Ethereum 2.0 validators. And so what's super important to notice is that actually most of the validators got all the reroads that they deserve. So there are very few validators that actually missed and that were penalized. So that means there is very little optimization to do for validators.
00:04:09.180 - 00:04:43.212, Speaker A: That means everybody can run a validators. It doesn't matter if you are really good technically or not. And this is extremely important for decentralization because, for example, for the current situation with proof of work with mining, you have to be super good technically to actually make money as a miner. But with Ethereum 2.0 validator, you don't have any edge, even if you are really good technically. So that's way better for decentralization. And still on the topic of Ethereum 2.0,
00:04:43.212 - 00:05:04.928, Speaker A: so a couple of metrics. So we have 173,000 active validators. That's way more than any other blockchain. And the end goal is to have roughly 1 million validators. And when we reach this number, it's going to become absolutely impossible to break Ethereum to censor it. Absolutely. Yeah, this is huge.
00:05:04.928 - 00:05:34.152, Speaker A: And so now we have 5% of the Ethereum supply that is locked in Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract. And so the more ether that is locked, of course, it's all of this ether. That means for all this time they cannot be sold. And so that's bullish. For the price of Ethereum, then we're going to see the metrics for the Defi market cap. So we are quite stagnant for the total value locked.
00:05:34.152 - 00:06:14.472, Speaker A: It's hovering over on 50 billion here in terms of number of ether. Also, we're still on a downward slope, unfortunately. Then in terms of the biggest protocol. So let me switch back to the total value locked. So ave is still number one with 10 billion curve compound. Uniswap slept a lot is only 5 billion. Now then we're going to see the tokens, the top token in DeFi, the worst token of the week.
00:06:14.472 - 00:06:50.992, Speaker A: So for the top token we have loop ring. So loop ring. They've introduced a new liquidity mining incentive, if I remember. Well, yeah, we have a cream, a couple of token in the green, but you can see that really this week it wasn't that great? I mean the biggest gain was 5%. So it was really bad week for DeFi token. And when it comes to the loss we have much more. Like for example pulse the token for polka starter -40% almost badger dao -30% one inch.
00:06:50.992 - 00:07:22.652, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty valid for DFI token this week. Then we are going to continue with the news for DFI project. First we're going to talk of risk harbor. So risk harbor is a marketplace to manage DFI risk and they just launch on Mennet and they are offering protection for two protocols. So harvest and Bandbridge users. So they have raised money. They have raised $3.25
00:07:22.652 - 00:08:03.596, Speaker A: million. So it's one more protocol that deals with Defi risk. That's super important with all the hacks that we have. Probably that in the future when you use a DeFi protocol it's going to be standard that at the same time you buy some insurance. Then we have this article of the defiant that explained the latest kind of scam in DeFi software. So basically in this kind of scam the developers do not steal the assets of users, but all they do is that they basically dump their token on the market. They just make a lot of money.
00:08:03.596 - 00:08:58.252, Speaker A: They exit the protocol. So even though nobody is stealing the cone of other people, it's still really bad for investor. Then some news from Polygon. So even though currently we have lower ethereum gas fees on main net, one big trend that we see is that users are still sticking to polygon. For example, for the top ten defi dap on Ethereum in the last seven days on Ethereum it has attracted a new 100,000 unique active wallets. But for polygon it was 242,000 unique wallets. So double the number of new user on polygon on the last seven days was twice the number on Ethereum minutes.
00:08:58.252 - 00:09:40.760, Speaker A: So it's super impressive. If you guys have been following my live stream, you probably know that I believe that the coin of polygon is, I think it's still called matic on exchanges. I think this is one of the coin with the most potential. I believe at some point it's going to be bigger than the market cap of binance smart chain. Then we're going to look at DeFi on the Tezos network. So even though DeFi on Tezos is still at the very beginning, there are still already a couple of projects. And so here we have a nice analysis of adapt radar.
00:09:40.760 - 00:10:32.360, Speaker A: So if you're interested in Tezos, have a look. Then there is this interesting article about, sorry, I meant to talk about this article here. So there is this super cool article about the DaO landscape and I especially liked here this infographic. So that's a summary of the main daos and they group them in different categories, protocol, DAo, investment, daos, et cetera. So daos, they are a really super important part of the industry. So I really recommend you check out this article. Then we're going to talk of NFT.
00:10:32.360 - 00:11:15.604, Speaker A: So we have the NFT with the most charging volume for the last seven days. And actually it's pretty stable if you compare to last week. So I think last week was almost exactly the same. Axie, infinity, NBA, topshot, crypto punk, et cetera. Then there is this interesting article about the most common scams in NFT. So it's super important to understand this if you want to invest in an NFT, for example, you have an artist impersonation, someone who pretend to be super famous artist, then yeah, fake storefront, deceitful biding. So that one is a little bit more sophisticated.
00:11:15.604 - 00:11:55.220, Speaker A: So there is a way to affect the bidding. So to make you believe that something is super valuable. There is also one thing they haven't mentioned in this article, but I think which is quite important. So sometime you have some artists that create an NFT and they tell you that it's going to be the only one, but actually they can mint other ones. So if you know how to read Smart contract, that's typically something that you can spot in the solidity code. Reddit announced a new project on NFT. It's called Crypto News.
00:11:55.220 - 00:12:33.200, Speaker A: So this is a limited edition of NFT for a couple of design here. So this is going to be auctioned on OpenSea. And when you buy one of these, it's going to replace your avatar on Reddit, basically. Then on Twitter. So Jay Z Put as is a profile picture, a crypto punk that he bought before. So he bought it for $126,000. It's super cool to see a celebrity to keep pumping NFT.
00:12:33.200 - 00:13:16.130, Speaker A: Then we had the most expensive piece of real estate in Decentraland. So there was someone who bought some real estate for $900,000. That's absolutely insane. So there's actually an entity called Republic Realm. So from what I understand, this is a sort of investment fund, but for virtual real estate. Then some news about NFT on Wax. So there is an NFT marketplace that is seeing a lot of gain, a lot of growth on wax this week.
00:13:16.130 - 00:14:03.660, Speaker A: Then some news about some comic who start to be more and more into NFT. And so there is a digital comic book that is going to let the fan decide what's going to be the future of the plot. So it's really nice to see NFT allowing more interaction. This is a very unique use case for NFT. We haven't seen this before. Then we have news about enterprise Blockchain and Regulation. So Visa PayPal are going to join crypto VC Blockchain to create a fund of $300 million for crypto.
00:14:03.660 - 00:14:33.364, Speaker A: It's very important to see that kind of news in this bear market. When all the prices are going down. You need to keep your eyes focused on what VC are doing. So VC keep investing. So that's really the most important. Then some news about Goldman Sachs. So Goldman Sachs started to do some trading on a blockchain network managed by Morgan.
00:14:33.364 - 00:15:26.244, Speaker A: So JP Morgan launched a blockchain network for the repo market. So that's quite technical. This has to do with money market. But basically, just to make it simple, JP Morgan created an enterprise blockchain network for trading and Goldman Sachs start to do some trading on it. And they're also using a digital version of the US dollar, which is called the JP coin, I believe. So, yeah, this is really in the trend of basically a general trend that we start to see this year, where centralized finance start to adopt a blockchain technology for their own purpose. Then there's some news of a microstrategy, which is one of the company that is one of the biggest supporter of crypto in the big corporate.
00:15:26.244 - 00:16:19.284, Speaker A: So they've added another $500 million of a bitcoin in their treasury. So even though the market has been quite down recently, it's always very good signal for the market to see microstrategy that keep believing in crypto. Then we have some news of the bank of Israel that adopt Ethereum for a trial to create a digital version of the shekel. So the shekel, which is the national currency of Israel. So I don't know exactly why they need Ethereum for this digital version of the shekel. Maybe it's going to be one of the reserve currency. But anyway, it's super positive for Ethereum to see central bank start to buy ethereum.
00:16:19.284 - 00:17:09.160, Speaker A: And I do think that this year we're probably going to start the first version of central bank coins. Then we have some bad news from the UK. So the UK government is on the hunt for businesses that deal with crypto assets and that have not registered. So they've made basically a list of different companies that they start to target cardano markets here, ripple markets, et cetera. And also from the UK. Another bad news is that they've announced that Binance isn't allowed to operate in the UK. So unfortunately, a lot of bad news for binance recently.
00:17:09.160 - 00:17:41.060, Speaker A: Then some news from Anderson and Horovit. So a 16 z, which is one of the biggest investment fund in the silicon Valley. And so they launch their biggest crypto fund ever, $2.2 billion. I think this is how many funds they had already, is the crypto fund number three. So, I mean, they just keep launching new crypto fund. That really tells you that there is a huge appetite from investors to invest in crypto.
00:17:41.060 - 00:18:23.648, Speaker A: So it's very good for us developers because a lot of this money is going to end up as a salary for developers. Then some news from El Salvador, which is going to do a bitcoin airdrop. Yes, they're going to distribute $117,000,000 of bitcoin to its citizens. So it's about $30 of bitcoin to each adult citizen. And this comes in the wake of another news for El Salvadors. A couple of weeks ago, they announced that bitcoin will be legal tender in the country. And this news is very important because, you know, sometime we might think that all countries are going to fight crypto in the same way.
00:18:23.648 - 00:18:57.500, Speaker A: Every country going to be united. For example, recently we had this global tax launched by Joe Biden, and some people say, oh, yeah, this is the end of crypto. All the countries are coming together. They're going to do the same for crypto. But no, we forget that not all countries have the same interest, the same incentive, the same policy. So while you're going to have some country that start to really go against crypto, other countries are going to be super favorable. And because we kind of have a consensus across all countries, that's why it's going to be very difficult to totally outlaw crypto.
00:18:57.500 - 00:19:41.400, Speaker A: Then some news about chain analysis. So that's a company to do some analysis on the blockchain that's very used by law enforcement, for example, when they want to track criminal on the blockchain. And so they have raised $100 million and for a total valuation of $4 billion. That's huge because we start to see more and more crypto company with a billion dollar valuation. Obviously, we have Coinbase, but now we also have many other company like this. So I remember a few years ago when channelizis was just starting, they were far from this kind of Valuation. And just in a few years like, they grew so fast, it's really insane.
00:19:41.400 - 00:20:25.210, Speaker A: Then we have some news from Citigroup. So they are launching a new digital asset unit in their wealth Management division. So that means they're going to propose some Investment Product for Crypto to their wealthy customer. So that means, once again, there is a lot of demand from wealthy people to invest in Crypto. Then some news from Elon Musk. So Elon Musk may debate with Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter. He may debate with Jack Dorsey at an upcoming Bitcoin event.
00:20:25.210 - 00:21:43.020, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's probably going to be interesting and probably we're going to have a lot of volatility for Bitcoin, as always, when Elon Musk talk about Crypto, then we have some news about the SEC. So the SEC is going to delay the ipo of RobinHood because of its growing Crypto Business. I don't like, like, we all know what happened at the beginning of the year during the GameStop saga when they prevented investors basically, from buying Gamestop, totally siding with their investor, who happened to be this big fund that were losing to these Redditors. So, yeah, not a big fan of Robinhood. I don't really see what can they add to crypto except to add an on ramp for people who want to invest in crypto. But, yeah, generally, I don't really like this. Then we have some news from Huobi, An Exchange in China, which we started to ban CrypTo Derivatives for users in China.
00:21:43.020 - 00:22:46.992, Speaker A: So, yeah, in the past few weeks, we had really a ton of negative news coming from China. Then one of the big news of the Week is, of course, John McCafe. So one of the Top Celebrity in the CrypTo Industry that was found dead in his Cell in Spain. So he was arrested by Spanish authority because he's wanted by the American government for tax evasion and other things. So, yeah, I mean, there is a lot of debate around his death because he tweeted at least one time, maybe twice, that if one Day someone, people find him hanged in his cell, he wouldn't be from his own volition. And he didn't really give any sign that he was depressed, that he was planning to commit suicide. So, yeah, there are a lot of rumors, especially because I think he had some link with Epstein.
00:22:46.992 - 00:23:32.464, Speaker A: So, yeah, of course, that reminds the death of Epstein. Personally, I don't have any info, but, yeah, I mean, that's sad. John McAfee was really one of the biggest figure in crypto. And even though he has, let's say, an interesting story, the fact is, I think he was appreciated in the crypto industry, especially in the bitcoin crowd. So yeah, it's sad for crypto. Then some news from other blockchain from the Solana ecosystem. So they just tweeted an infographic about all their DAP and I was pretty impressed.
00:23:32.464 - 00:24:33.770, Speaker A: I didn't realize that they grew so much already. So yeah, I'm considering doing some tutorials about Solana because I think this is something super. Then some news from Chainlink. So there is a crypto project called Conexon that is going to launch a new chainlink node that's going to bring real time sentiment on the crypto market on chain. So that's going to be interesting for maybe a new category of strategy in defi that leverage this sentiment info, maybe for a new kind of yield farming, for example. Then there was a small hike on the binance machine, only $500,000. Usually we're used to a million of dollars, so it looks like a small one.
00:24:33.770 - 00:25:37.512, Speaker A: And then some news for developers. So there was a new version of remix that was released and now they've released an update with the update for the London hard fork. Also we have a new release of solidity, so it's mostly a bug fix. And what else? We have a tool that was released by Coinbase called Solidify. So that's a tool to automatically detect and classify the security risk in smart contract. And finally, we have a toolkit from oping to allow you to build project on top of their options. So it's pretty interesting because opin, this is an interesting protocol, but it's also quite complex.
00:25:37.512 - 00:26:35.456, Speaker A: So it's typically the kind of project you can use to play around, try to build on top of open without spending too much time in the details of the implementation. All right, so now we're going to do the Q A, but very briefly, let me remind you of the two announcements. So first announcement this week on Thursday, I'm going to do a new live training for the safemoon token. So if you want to fork Safemoon and create your own token on the binance smart chain so you can register for this event, I put the link in the chat. And second, if you are interested in building projects together so you can check out the live stream I did last Friday, I explained this in more detail. And if you want to be involved in this, we're going to build a project together. You register here.
00:26:35.456 - 00:27:00.330, Speaker A: This is free to participate. Okay, so let me scroll up in the chat and we'll see the question. All right, Davenshu, please shout out to my token bill hates on binance smart chain. Okay, so I see a lot of sad emoticons. So I guess your token didn't fare very well. I guess. Too bad.
00:27:00.330 - 00:27:36.556, Speaker A: Action photo. When is the proof of stake schedule for Ethereum? Well, there are different phases and one of the phase that is coming very fast is basically the switch from proof of work to proof of stake. And this can happen in the next few months. Georgie, can you share all those articles? Thanks. Okay, maybe next time. But I have no easy way to share them in the chat. Masa.
00:27:36.556 - 00:27:51.864, Speaker A: Hey, sir, what do you think about polycrystal? I don't know. Don't know. This project, Georgie, Polygon is way, way faster and cheaper than eth. So my bet on polygon. Yes. Action photo passion. I try to buy some tron today to start to collect some tron, but just can buy.
00:27:51.864 - 00:28:06.844, Speaker A: Your transaction aren't going through. Is it because it's Chinese and Europe is like banning it? No, I think there is no relationship with this. Maybe your gas price was too low. No. Action. Full of passion. Weird then.
00:28:06.844 - 00:28:21.440, Speaker A: Thank you for the explanation. Mjs. Yo, Julian. Awesome as always. Thanks man. Mjs. You believe that it would flip bitcoin by market cap this bull run you can see on ratio gang or trade view.
00:28:21.440 - 00:28:49.128, Speaker A: Yes, even if it doesn't happen during this bull Run, it's going to happen eventually. Georgie. Mjs. What is a great tutorial to learn how to use Dex tools? Okay, I will have a look at Dex tools because several people mentioned this zenith. Love your work. Thank you, Gabrielle. Great.
00:28:49.128 - 00:29:10.704, Speaker A: Matthew Harmon. The good news is that if bitcoin was going to drop below 20k again, you probably would have with all the recent news. Maybe, but I mean personally, as I always said, really invest on the long term. Just do some dollar cost averaging. Only invest what you can afford to lose. And if you do all of this, you're patient. Really.
00:29:10.704 - 00:29:40.620, Speaker A: On the long term, there is no way you can lose. Really if you're really patient. Of course, if you want to become rich super fast, then it's not going to work. Okay, so then team b rip my cafe. That was a great antivirus those days. Yes, crypto Michael, you say I'm late. Yes.
00:29:40.620 - 00:30:18.996, Speaker A: This Matthew. Has anyone had heard of the price aggregator or. Yes, yes, I've used it, but I'm not sure if it's still maintained then. Jaysha, can you please describe use case MongoDB in either blocks project one is just to store the result of the vote because we're going to do the vote off chance so that it doesn't cost any money to vote. So that there is no friction at all. Because I really want to maximize the utilization. I don't want people to not vote because they have to pay.
00:30:18.996 - 00:30:33.604, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is it, Batman. Smash the like button. Thanks, man. Appreciate. All right. All right, guys, are we running out of questions already? I believe so.
00:30:33.604 - 00:31:03.076, Speaker A: So let me share once again the toolings of this week. So first they're going to be a new session for the live training on forking safe moon. So this is going to be this week, Thursday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. And second thing, if you're interested in the ETB project, that's something I explained last week. You can register here. Hi, I'm senor net developer and I'm looking for a way to get out of here.
00:31:03.076 - 00:31:43.630, Speaker A: I just started learning, so et and I'm thinking of becoming a blockchain developer. Yeah, I mean, if you already have a developer background, it's going to help you a lot, that's for sure. A default. Say, how can I get some covenant or Mumbai with the faucet closed? Well, you can ask people on Twitter and just wait for the faucet to come back online. How much is going to take to learn a job as a blockchain developer? Okay, so I have a free training on that. Let me see. If you want to know how you can get your first blockchain job, you register to this free training here.
00:31:43.630 - 00:32:01.328, Speaker A: Okay. Okay, guys, well, I see no more question. So we are going to stop here. So thanks for coming to this dream and have a great week and I will see you soon on eat the blocks. Bye, guys. Have a great week. Bye.
