00:00:09.060 - 00:00:28.904, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi. I'm julian, your host and on the blocks I teach blockchain development. Hi to everybody. In the chat we have crypto Michael Trendletkai, George Kennedy Krong, Joe Biden. Hi guys. Hi.
00:00:28.904 - 00:01:06.410, Speaker A: Hi. So first announcement this week. So next week on Tuesday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight, I'm going to do a free training on how to become a blockchain developer and get your first six figure blockchain job. So this is going to be a free training. This is for complete newbie who are new to the industry and they want to know how they can get from where they are now to a position where they have a job in the blockchain industry. Well paid, interesting remote, everything.
00:01:06.410 - 00:01:40.784, Speaker A: So I'm going to explain the method that I've used myself as well as thousand of my students. That's how we did to get our first blockchain job. So if you want to attend, you have to register. You just give me your name and email and I will send you the link a couple of hours before the live training. This is going to be next week. So August 3 at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight this is for newbies next announcement.
00:01:40.784 - 00:02:25.030, Speaker A: So this week we're going to do another live stream on Friday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. This is going to be to vote for the winning project for the ETB project. So ETB project this is a series of hackathon where we build project on top of the ETB token, the project the token of ether blocks. And so the first project is a voting app that allows to vote based on the number of token we have. So we have a couple of people who participated and they're going to do a demo this Friday. So I'm going to show you their demo and after that we are going to vote and the winner is going to win $1,000 plus we're going to use its code after.
00:02:25.030 - 00:03:28.100, Speaker A: So you're going to see this live stream on my channel. And if you want more info on ETB project, you can check out this page on GitHub. Then we have a quick message from our sponsor, nervous. So what is nervous? Nervous is a blockchain platform for universal applications. The nervous network is an open source public blockchain ecosystem and a collection of protocols so that you can create the next generation of public network. And I'm really excited to announce that nervous is going to make big waves in August because they're going to launch a new program called August for builders where basically they're inviting all blockchain developers to participate in beta testing of their newly launched layer two solution. So they have basic blockchain and they also have layer two solution, one called Pulley juice.
00:03:28.100 - 00:04:15.572, Speaker A: So Polyjuice God woken their two layer two solution and they also have a bridge that they call the Force bridge. So it's really a full ecosystem. And they also have a campaign of gitcoin bounties, so you can make money if you solve some of their bounties. And finally they are going to launch a Dex on the platform called Yokai Swap. And this is going to be open for better testing throughout the month of August. So if you are interested in nervous, you can check out this link. I put it in the chat and we also going to do a workshop video on August 5 on my channel.
00:04:15.572 - 00:04:45.836, Speaker A: So we're going to do a deep dive in their technology and for that we're going to have a developer of Novos so super excited to check out this blockchain together. Okay, so we're going to continue with the price of ether. So finally guys, finally. Good week. I was losing hope. It just seems like it couldn't keep the floor at 2000 and boom, we smashed it. Boom, finally.
00:04:45.836 - 00:05:27.900, Speaker A: So I don't know if this is the return of the bull market, it's too soon to say. But what is really nice is that you can see that here we are going up on a very strong volume and it's very, very important because if you go up with a low volume, it's not really significant. So hopefully it's going to continue. We will see generally during summer the market is very crazy. So whether it goes up, whether it goes down, I wouldn't worry too much. We have to wait for fall for September to really see what's the direction of the market in general. When it comes to the gas price, it's always very important to keep an eye on the gas price.
00:05:27.900 - 00:06:03.332, Speaker A: We are stable even though it's going up a bit, but not too much. You can see like we're still maintaining this big drop that we had before. So that's good because the network is more usable. Then we have some news on Ethereum 2.0. So we have exceeded 200,000 validators. That's absolutely huge. I don't know if you guys remember, but a couple of months ago when it went above 100,000 validators, I already told you how amazing it was, how it was just way above any other blockchain.
00:06:03.332 - 00:06:42.912, Speaker A: I mean, I believe the next biggest blockchain in terms of number of validators is probably something like 10,000 validator or maybe 15,000. So that really show you like Ethereum is really an Order of magnitude above in terms of technology. You have all these other blockchain and say, oh, we're going to beat Ethereum, we're going to be more scalable. Okay, how many Validator you have? Because it's easy to get very scalable when you have 21 validators, like Binance, Smart chain. So when you see metrics like this that really show you the power of Ethereum. And so currently there are 6.6 million of Ether that are being staked.
00:06:42.912 - 00:07:12.450, Speaker A: So these ether are locked for a couple of years until we do the transition complete to EthereuM 2.0. So that's a total of $14 billion and so 6.6 million. So you can compare this with the total supply of Ether, which is about 120,000,000. So that's about 5% of the Total Supply. But it's going to keep growing. And of course, the more ether that is locked, the more bullish it is because this ether cannot be sold on the open market.
00:07:12.450 - 00:08:00.584, Speaker A: Then we have some news from Reddit. So Reddit launched some community point a couple of months ago, and so they announced that they are scaling the community Points by using Arbitram roll up. So Arbitram is a technology for L two scaling solution, but itself, this is not a chain. So any developer, any project can build their own integration with their own implementation of Arbitra. So Reddit is going to use this tech to scale the community point and they're going to start by doing it on the Rinkabee TestNet and then they're going to migrate to mainnet. So it's really cool. The team of Reddit, they are quite adventurous.
00:08:00.584 - 00:09:01.680, Speaker A: They're always looking to create a new cool thing. And it's super cool that they chose Ethereum because Reddit is such this huge social network and it's much more open compared to Facebook or one of these huge giant social media. And at the same time, they can experiment by just putting the community point on the blockchain so themselves they don't take too much risk. So I think it could be a great way to really showcase Ethereum at a production scale because know they have this huge amount of users, so very bullish for us. Then we have some news from the seller blockchain. So they have launched a new bridge that can instantly do some token transfer between Ethereum, Arbitram and a couple of side chains. So more integration for Ethereum.
00:09:01.680 - 00:09:45.424, Speaker A: Then we have some news from Stockware. So Stockware, which is another project that does its own implementation of optimistic roll up of zero knowledge roll up. Sorry. And so they are launching their alpha version for one of their networks. So this is going to be one more l two scaling solution. It's really, really good that we have this big competition right now on Ethereum, because I really feel right now the focus is being put back on Ethereum. Like if you go back maybe six months ago, there was like Finance March and there were like all these copycats of Ethereum right and left.
00:09:45.424 - 00:10:44.790, Speaker A: And it seems like now the discussion is coming back to Ethereum. We are really comparing the l two scaling solution, but of Ethereum, and it's going to be much harder for all the blockchain to compete with this. So this is still very early for Stockware, but it's good that they are still making some progress. Then some news from optimism. So on July 20, the Optimism Team announced that they will commit all the earnings of their project to fund public goods. And so Vitalik buttering made a guest appearance and explain how we could create a public good dao, and then that could create the right incentives for the creators. So maybe we're going to have some innovation with Dao after this.
00:10:44.790 - 00:11:22.508, Speaker A: Then we have some news from ECC, which is one of the big Ethereum conference. So this just happened in Paris, and this is probably one of the most underrated, by the way, probably one of the most underrated conference for Ethereum. This is really for builders. This is not as high profile as a Defcon. This is way cheaper to attend. But in terms of quality of the presenter, in terms of the vibe, this is probably one of the best. The food was great, too.
00:11:22.508 - 00:11:53.568, Speaker A: Often you go to conference, you pay your ticket like $1,000, $2,000 and the food is disgusting. East CC, this is in France. I'm french. If there is one thing we can be proud of, it's food, right? So usually the food is pretty good and it's super interesting. And so you can watch all the videos on this YouTube channel. Next we're going to continue with the news on Defi. So the market cap of Defi continue to recover.
00:11:53.568 - 00:12:35.072, Speaker A: We're still very far from the peak of a couple of months ago. We are at about $60 billion, but still we are going in the right direction. So here we can see this big plunge in the chart. I'm pretty sure this was a technical glitch because nothing bad happened during the past week for the market. In terms of ETH locked in the system, we are plateauing here. So about almost 10 million eth. And in terms of the ranking of the protocol, so Ave is still far in front of everybody else with a $12 billion curve finance compound.
00:12:35.072 - 00:12:54.184, Speaker A: Instadap. Instadab. That was number two a couple of weeks ago. Uniswap still hasn't recovered, still very far. Sushi swap still far behind Uniswap. Yeah. And we have a quick swap, which is basically the leading decks on Polygon now that start to be bigger and bigger.
00:12:54.184 - 00:13:19.584, Speaker A: I think this is the biggest project on polygon right now, 1 billion. And as we go. That'd be interesting to see that all this polygon project going higher and higher in the chart. Then let's check the crypto fees. So, this is basically a dashboard that tells you what are the protocols that earn the most money. So this compares both blockchain and protocol. And so here we see a change in the chart.
00:13:19.584 - 00:13:45.528, Speaker A: So binance smart chain is catching up on Ethereum, and he actually went above Uniswap. So Uniswap was above finance marching. But now binance smart chain is catching up. Uniswap V two is strange. Uniswap V two is very close to V three. So that means the migration isn't complete yet. Ave compound sushi swap.
00:13:45.528 - 00:14:21.256, Speaker A: I mean, you can see the top earner for the protocol. This is still on Ethereum and bitcoin, which is just so far below. Like mainstream media. They are just focused on this line here, but they're just completely missing the point. That means that a protocol like sushiswap, which is the mainstream media, of course, doesn't know anything about sushiswap, but right now, sushiswap is making more money than bitcoin. Okay, so next we're going to continue with the top winners and loser for the DFI coin. So that was a very good week for everybody.
00:14:21.256 - 00:14:50.896, Speaker A: So hedge plus 90% mp coin, mp token plus 70%. Reserve ride, token plus 60%. The token of Rari plus 60%. So NfT are doing well at the moment. Venus, which is one of the leading project on finance, marching plus 50%. So, yeah, we have this big push in tokens right now. And when it comes to the loser, we have very few loser this week.
00:14:50.896 - 00:15:19.752, Speaker A: Almost none. It's really difficult to lose money this week. Okay, so next we have some news from Sushi swap. So sushi swap is back from the dead. Sushi swap with a Uniswap V three. They kind of lost it to uniswap a big time recently. Sometime we heard like they were doing some new project, like a token launch pad or something.
00:15:19.752 - 00:16:04.344, Speaker A: But to me it always felt like a gimmick compared to Uniswap because really the big, big innovation in a deck space, it was Uniswap V three. And I think sushi swap, I was afraid they were just doing their little side project right and left. But it seems, no, they've been working all along on something super serious. So they are announcing they're working on a new generation of decentralized exchange that they will call. And basically this is inspired by some discussion they had with Andre Cronhey from yearn finance. This is a completely new development. This is not going to be a fork of Uniswap V three.
00:16:04.344 - 00:16:32.716, Speaker A: And this is very important because with the new license of Uniswap V three, you cannot fork it. If you fork it, they will sue you. So now they've learned their lesson. They protected themselves. And so other project have to innovate. And so this new generation of Dex is going to offer four kind of pools. So one, which is a constant product pool where you're going to have two assets of equal value weight.
00:16:32.716 - 00:17:18.864, Speaker A: So it's basically what we have now. So a simple pool, then mixed pools, then we have mixed pools, then centralized pool that require user to specify a price range for token asset to increase liquidity. So basically you need to have v three and then weighted pool that can be composed of assets with different weights. So it seems to me they are sort of combining what we have in uniswap. So basically they're combining the old version of Uniswap with the new version of Uniswap with balancer. So it's quite interesting, but I hope that they're going to come up with innovation of their own, really. And on top of that, they're going to do some innovation on the front end as well.
00:17:18.864 - 00:18:14.820, Speaker A: So they're going to have a better way to write the order in order to really basically reduce the slippage by going to the smart. Basically, they want to come up with the best pass in all their pools so that you, the trader, you pay the least amount of slippage possible, the least amount of gas cost, et cetera. So it'll be really cool to see a real innovation from sushi swap and not just some copy from somewhere else. And then there is this article in the defiant that explain how you can farm up to 152 ApR in Balancer polygon pool. So yeah, so balancer now is on polygon and you can go full digen with super high yields at the moment. Super cool. Okay, we're going to continue with news from cream finance.
00:18:14.820 - 00:18:55.736, Speaker A: Cream finance which is a leading lending protocol on binance smart chain. And so they are going to create a stable coin based on euro. So interesting, because right now all the stablecoin, they are based on the US dollar, nothing on the euro. So it's going to bring more european user to the. Then. Then we have some news from Uniswap. So Uniswap announced that they are going to remove certain tokens from their interface.
00:18:55.736 - 00:19:39.900, Speaker A: So here let's be clear. They removed this token from the front end, but of course they cannot remove this token from the back end. So from their smart contract because this is a decentralized protocol and this is a permissionless protocol. So anybody can create any liquidity pool, nobody control this. But they're just saying that basically you can still trade this token if you want, but not using their front end, you have to create your own front end. And they are doing this on about 100 token. And this token are basically about tokenized stocks, options and derivatives options on Ethereum.
00:19:39.900 - 00:20:29.576, Speaker A: But mainly it seems it's everything that is really competing directly with Wall street, especially for tokenized stocks. If you guys remember, binance had to remove their tokenized stocks from their exchange also because they started to have some regulatory scrutiny. So I think this is a prudent decision of Uniswap. That shows you that Uniswap is also sensitive to pressure from the US because most of their team are in the US. The CEO, I think he is in New York. So yeah, even though they work on the blockchain, they can also be arrested if they don't comply. But it doesn't change the fact that the protocol is still decentralized.
00:20:29.576 - 00:20:59.130, Speaker A: So you can still trade this token from other front end if you want. And this is not the first time they do this. I think they were criticized, but I think that was one year or two year ago. They basically banned their front end to be accessed from Irene and. Yeah, and at that time there was a huge backlash against Uniswap. From my point of view, I don't think it's a big deal. You can just create your own front end.
00:20:59.130 - 00:21:40.772, Speaker A: Okay, so then we're going to continue with fundraising. So thesis, which is a crypto venture studio. So basically they help to build a couple of blockchain projects, they have raised $21 million. And so with this fresh capital at hands, they are going to launch new projects. So, including a web three wallet, et cetera. By the way, guys, if you are new on my channel, the reason why I give information about all these companies that raise money is because when company raise money, they have to spend it very fast. That means they're going to hire a lot of people.
00:21:40.772 - 00:22:11.432, Speaker A: So if you're a blockchain developer, you're looking for your first blockchain job. You hear about a company that is raising money. What does it mean? If you're interested in this company, you send your cv right away. And because they need to spend the money fast. So just by being one of the first already, you win. Then we have some news from. News from Magic, which has raised $27 million.
00:22:11.432 - 00:22:49.164, Speaker A: So magic is a company that is working on a solution to improve the UX of users. For a blockchain application especially, they developed their passwordless logging solution. So magic is really working on something very important because one of the biggest barrier to entry for new user is the UI Ux. When you're new and you have to use metamask and you have to connect the metamask and. Oh my God, this is so bad. So I've used their passwordless logging, and this is pretty good. And it can work both for blockchain, but also for non blockchain application.
00:22:49.164 - 00:23:27.620, Speaker A: So I do think they are onto something really good. Next, we have some news from FTX, which is a big crypto exchange, and they managed to raise $900 million. So I think this is the absolute record for a crypto company. I don't think any crypto company raised more money than this, apart from in an IPO, of course. So, yeah, congrats to them. And they are doing this in the middle, I mean, at the beginning of a bear market. So that's pretty impressive.
00:23:27.620 - 00:24:23.976, Speaker A: And the previous record here, that was set by circle, which raised 140,000,000 in May. So it's also a good metric that crypto companies are raising more and more money. That means they're really getting bigger and bigger. Okay, next we gonna talk of Defi hack. So we had one Defi hack this week from Thorchein, which already had a hack last week, and so this time they lost $8 million. And that's because the hacker apparently wanted to teach them a lesson, because apparently originally he could have stole for way more money. So I don't know, are we supposed to thank the hacker for his nice gesture? Oh, thank you.
00:24:23.976 - 00:24:52.320, Speaker A: You just stole 8 million instead of 20 million. Thank you so much. Okay, then we're going to talk NFT. Okay, so here we have our dashboard for NFT price, for secondary price. So here we keeps going up. So we are clearly in a bull market for NFT, not for all collection. So for example, on super rare, still going down.
00:24:52.320 - 00:25:21.932, Speaker A: But for example, Artblocks is doing well. Crypto punk not doing well, vfriends doing well, bold apes. So it really depends on the collection, but in general it's going up. Then we have some news from Openc. Openc, which is the biggest NFT marketplace, also the oldest, and they raised $100 million for a total valuation of 1.5 billion. So that's really huge.
00:25:21.932 - 00:26:16.140, Speaker A: So they raised money from a 16 z, which is one of the most prestigious investment fund in the US, very involved in crypto recently. So with this capital, they're going to continue to scale their NFT platform. They're going to hire a lot of people, of course. And now they are also working on adding transactions on the polygon platform that will enable them to scale really a know like NFT. They are much more sensitive to low transaction price compared to DeFi because DeFi, in DeFi you have two categories. You have wealth and you have a retail investor. But wealth, they can afford huge transaction fees because they are trading so much.
00:26:16.140 - 00:26:58.892, Speaker A: Retails, not so much. But when it comes to NFT, you have a lot of NFT that have a low price, especially when it comes to game. So it's even more important for NFT that we have this scalable blockchain. So it's great to see polygon that is getting a lot of traction not only in DFI, but also in NFT now. Okay, so talking of polygon. So polygon, which is currently the leading l two scaling solution on ethereum polygon is raising a 100 million dollar fund to support blockchain game developer and NFT creator. So obviously there is this huge push of polygon for NFT at the moment.
00:26:58.892 - 00:27:48.330, Speaker A: Very smart. And then we have some news from basically a new series of NFT that is called Stoner Cats. And apparently they're going to be some famous crypto people in there, like Vitalik Buttering, also some actor. They're going to be Ashton Kutcher, et cetera. So I think it has the potential of cryptopunk. So yeah, if you're into NFT, check this out. These are probably going to be very expensive, so maybe it's a bit hard to buy them in whole, but probably you can buy like a fractional NFT of a stoner cat by using NFTX, for example.
00:27:48.330 - 00:28:51.676, Speaker A: Okay, so then we have some news from a project called Autograph NFT. So this is a new project that's going to allow anyone with a Twitter account to digitally sign NFT. So that means that celebrities, influencers, et cetera, can sign token at the request of their. Yeah, that's a very smart way to monetize, to allow all these influencers to monetize their. Then we have a new project, ZK NFT. So that's basically a proof of concept NFT marketplace, which is built on ZK sync, which is zero knowledge scaling solution. Then we have a new project called Pow NFT.
00:28:51.676 - 00:29:38.680, Speaker A: So this is a project that allow you to lend and borrow NFT. So basically a sort of compound for NFT. So very smart. We haven't seen a lot of project like this so far. I think it has a lot of potential. Then we have this interesting article from DAP reader that explained the recent big increase in blockchain games, especially axie Infinity, cryptoblade, alien world. And here, especially if you're interested in recently, Axie Infinity is this game that had this crazy increase.
00:29:38.680 - 00:30:06.352, Speaker A: It's growing like crazy. And so here this article explain what's going on. So if you are into blockchain game, you absolutely have to check Axie infinity. It's really where it's happening at the moment. Okay, so now we're going to talk of enterprise, blockchain and regulation. So we have sad news. So the Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith is back in jail after allegedly checking his coinbase account.
00:30:06.352 - 00:30:59.236, Speaker A: So he violated the terms of his bail and now he's in custody. So this is a researcher. He went to North Korea, I think, a couple of years ago and he did some conference about blockchain, but the US government really didn't like it. And basically because of all the sanction on North Korea, basically said that they claim that he was helping North Korea to evade a sanction, which I think is total bullshit because this information that he gave them is completely public. Like, everything we do on the blockchain is public. North Korea need to have the help of an Ethereum developer if they want to invade a sanction. So yeah, this case is total bullshit.
00:30:59.236 - 00:31:31.040, Speaker A: And that's very mean. Programming is free speech. It shouldn't end up like. Then we have some news from Binance. So binance us is looking to do an ipo. And so this is from the mouth of CZ, their CEO. So this is so CZ said that right now the crypto space start to be heavily regulated.
00:31:31.040 - 00:32:18.930, Speaker A: So binance has to make a big pivot from a technology startup into a financial service company. But of know this is not by chance he's saying this now. I mean, if you've been following the news the past few weeks, the past few months, you've heard all the terrible news on binance in all these countries. They have the regulators that approach them and tell them, hey, we're going to shut you down. You have to stop your services now. So there is like almost this coordinated action from all these countries that really attacked binance because binance, yeah, that's true. I think they're incorporated in Malta and they haven't worked as hard as Coinbase to be regulated in a big country.
00:32:18.930 - 00:33:20.960, Speaker A: So I think now they realize that probably have no choice but to be regulated in the US so that the US authorities stop to harass them. And after all the other country they're just going to follow suit. But there is also another possibility, which is that as I already mentioned, is that Coinbase that recently did their IPO, now they have a lot of money and they're probably also looking to buy binance. So it's not impossible. If during this year we hear a big announcement of Coinbase that say, hey, okay, we want a finance, we make you an offer, I don't know, like $50 billion, you can accept or not. So it's also a possibility. Okay, so then we have some news from european regulators that want to set some new rules for crypto, especially when it comes to AML.
00:33:20.960 - 00:33:59.890, Speaker A: So they want to require all the crypto service providers to enforce some strict KYC policy to detect the money laundering and terrorism financing, blah, blah, blah. And I also want to prohibit anonymous crypto wallets. So I think this one is really crazy because basically anybody can create an anonymous crypto wallet. So technically this is just not feasible. So this is probably a little bit uninformed. Like they need to keep working or keep doing some research. They're not ready yet to do regulation, I think.
00:33:59.890 - 00:34:55.252, Speaker A: Okay, so then we have some news from the Central bank of South Korea, which is working on their central bank, on their CBDC. And so they've hired a blockchain company to design what it could be. So now really most central bank, they are working on their CBDC. So maybe that this year we're going to see the first CBDC in production and next year probably we're going to have this huge wave of next. So there was a rumor this week on Twitter that Amazon may accept bitcoin as a payment. Next. So that was basically one of the main reasons for the crypto rally this year.
00:34:55.252 - 00:35:47.916, Speaker A: So thank you, Amazon, but I hope this is. Then we have some news from chain analysis and PayPal. So a top executive of a chain analysis is going to move to PayPal in order to help them to navigate the crypto regulation. So PayPal right now is doing this big move into crypto and they're hiring in every direction. And finally, last news, so on the definity blockchain. So definity is facing a class action lawsuit because the ICP token is considered an unregistered security. So in other words, Polishan.
00:35:47.916 - 00:36:15.756, Speaker A: Oh, I didn't see that. Polishan, Andres and a 16 z and definitive funder have also been implicated in the suit. Okay, this is not cool because polychain and Az is basically a 16 z. They are one of the biggest investor in crypto. Okay, this is not cool. Okay, well, I hope everything's going to be fine for these guys. Okay, so now we are going to do the q.
00:36:15.756 - 00:36:56.280, Speaker A: And a quick reminder. So next week, so Tuesday, so August 3 at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight, I'm going to do a free live training on how to get your first blockchain job, remote and remote and making $100,000 a year. So I'm going to explain you the method I used for myself, the method I've been teaching the thousand of students of idoblocks. So if you are a newbie and you're wondering how you can break into the industry, you have to attend this training. This is completely free. This is going to be a video training.
00:36:56.280 - 00:37:25.730, Speaker A: We're going to do this over Zoom, and you have to register so that I can send you the link to the training. All right, guys, so I'm going to scroll up and check out the questions. So who do we have? We have Ari, citroy, synapse, THX, Cesar, plv, AJA, 80, sk. We are on the path to 10,000. Yes. O'Neill, Bronson. Yes.
00:37:25.730 - 00:37:43.112, Speaker A: I got 80 saying, go binance, smart chain. Fernando saying, you are great. A hug from Colombia, America south. Thanks, man. Ruben, your company got to have meaning, though. Ryan, morning. You're awesome, Julian, I love your content very much.
00:37:43.112 - 00:38:01.272, Speaker A: Thank you. From USA. Thanks, Ryan. Synapse Novosa, if you call it that, would be crazy. Oh, I think you're talking of the possibility that coinbase tried to buy binance. Yeah. Byron.
00:38:01.272 - 00:38:23.572, Speaker A: Cats, eth transactions and flash loans. Still very expensive. When is the binance smashing flash loan update? So the code should be available in about two, three weeks. Batman is working on it. So Batman is the support staff of either blocks. I get 80. Wow, a 16 z.
00:38:23.572 - 00:38:54.432, Speaker A: Yeah. It's very surprising he's in the lawsuit because usually, you know, like, this guy is very smart. He's always managed to have so many lawyers that protect him from every direction. So I really don't know how this can happen. John Hill, can you teach me to write a smart contract for a game? So I would suggest to first learn solidity blockchain development in general. And when you know how to do this, then you start to search for NFT tutorials. I do have some NFT tutorials on my channel.
00:38:54.432 - 00:39:27.908, Speaker A: But first start with the basic of a blockchain. Dave. Hey, is it possible to use external tokens on the testnet, like USDC? If so, how can I do it? So there is no official deployment of USDC on Testnet. It's just each project that develop their own version. You can just deploy an ERC 20 on Testnet and you call it USDC. And here you go, you have your USDC. Gregory is saying, come to San Francisco.
00:39:27.908 - 00:39:49.650, Speaker A: I would love to. Cesar bitcoin forever. Yeah, why not? But I prefer Ethereum. Ryan, is it possible to get blockchain job without a. Yes. You know, blockchain companies, maybe, except the top one. And even in general, in the tech industry of general, degrees are less important.
00:39:49.650 - 00:40:15.864, Speaker A: This is not a regulated activity. You don't need a sort of license to be a programmer. You just need to be good. So if you can demonstrate to any company that you're a good developer, that will always take you over. Some guy who come from, I don't know, Stanford or MIT, but the guy cannot code. Of course, if you have a big degree, of course that's a bonus. But if you don't have it, really don't stress over it.
00:40:15.864 - 00:41:04.970, Speaker A: It doesn't really matter. Okay, Ari, for you, in which specific field of blockchain the next big innovation should be made? Bridge NFT. Defi. Okay, so I do think now for Defi, we start to see a little bit more hurdles from regulators, especially regulators. They don't like when we try to do like tokenized talks or this kind of thing. So I don't think DeFi is under threat under the short term, but let's say there is some resistance coming. But when it comes to Defi, I think DeFi regulators are not going to care so much.
00:41:04.970 - 00:42:03.176, Speaker A: Sorry, I meant game and NFT, when it comes to game and NFT, regulators are not going to care so much. So I think short middle term, there is a huge potential to grow the market for basically, if you can bring DeFi to NFT and to blockchain game, I think that's a very smart way to go, like mixing the two. Kelly Hilabi, is there a limit for the amount of addresses in one contract array variable? Well, good question. No, but it costs money to store data on the blockchain. So the more data you put on a smart contract, the more it costs. So that's probably going to be your practical limit. Gregory, check out flow protocol and dapper labs.
00:42:03.176 - 00:42:38.544, Speaker A: Yeah, flow protocol. So this is the blockchain of dapper Lab built for games. Absolutely. Irfan, smart contract security, please, can we have a dedicated course in detail of all the hacks? Yeah, that's a very good idea. So I don't know if you're aware of it, but we have two live training on security right now. So you go to the catalog of the course of feedblocks and the first live training, this is about smart contract security from the point of view of the developer. So you try to protect yourself against a hacker.
00:42:38.544 - 00:43:17.012, Speaker A: This is defensive. And the next live training, this is from the point of view of a smart contract auditor. So this time you try to put your feet, try to put yourself in the feet of a hacker and you try to attack an existing smart contract. So already check out these two life training. We might do a full course later, but already with this you should learn a few things. And these two life trainings, they were not done by me, but they were done by another instructor who is a specialist in cybersecurity since many, many years. So that's a guy who is really solid people who took this two life training, they loved them.
00:43:17.012 - 00:44:26.120, Speaker A: Absolutely. Aga zero 80, have you seen any example of crosschain governance meeting? Example I am on binance smart chain and I want to control farms. Minting on polygon. Example of cross chain governance or minting? No, this is super tough because if you want to do anything cross chain, usually this is centralized, so that's tough. Gregory, about security, how do you think about threat management? Tools, techniques, tips? Okay, so I refer you check out the curriculum of this two life training because the instructor of this two life training has more interesting things to do than me. Daniel Miller, how do I validate if a coin like USDC on the Polygon network is legit? And how does the price follow the native coin? Good question. So I would go to the website of the project of USDC and probably they have a page where they list all their deployment.
00:44:26.120 - 00:45:13.704, Speaker A: Now it's possible that you have a sort of third party that creates a coin which is pegged to USDC on polygon. So in this case you have to trust the creator of the project that their peg is working. First of all, check the website of the project to see if they have other deployment. And second, try to understand if they have like third party pegged deployment. Okay, th shake saying thanks for the information about the american sharing his information to North Korea. I'm gonna follow what happens. Yeah, scary, scary case, huh? Sabu Victor, have you heard of Elrond? If you know, you should look it up, I think you will like it.
00:45:13.704 - 00:45:49.012, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, I just heard the name, but I haven't tried it. Thank you. Altem. How can I use USDC on mainnet? Let's say I want to sell some information as NFT to accept payment in USDC but not ETH. You mean you want to accept payments? Well, so if you want to accept payment crypto payments, there are a couple of solutions. So you have Coinbase. What is this Coinbase merchants? I don't remember.
00:45:49.012 - 00:46:29.840, Speaker A: But there is a service from Coinbase. There is, I think a conify a couple of basically payment provider for crypto. A lot of them are pretty restricted in terms of the number of coins that they offer. So you probably have to do some research to find a provider that is appropriate for you. But if you want to accept crypto payment in just one coin, actually you could build your own project. It's not too difficult. Okay, I purchased both.
00:46:29.840 - 00:47:17.196, Speaker A: I think you're talking of the live training on smart contract security. Great. Artem saying how to calculate what is the price of smart contract deployment. Basically, first you can deploy this to a local development blockchain like a ganache, and it's going to tell you how much gas it used to deploy the contract. Then you multiply this gas cost by the current gas price on the network and here you have your price. Ari Siegehoy, do you plan to have a class on regulation and legal aspect of the blockchain industry? I'm hesitating to becoming a company in Canada because I don't know the legislation, not at the moment. But I have to tell you that the blocks is really growing.
00:47:17.196 - 00:47:36.608, Speaker A: And so right now we are hiring more and more teachers. So currently we are focused more onto technical stuff. But it's not impossible that at some point in the future we start to look at this kind of topic, but thanks for the suggestion. I got zero 80. Thank you. You're the man. Have a good week.
00:47:36.608 - 00:47:59.672, Speaker A: Have a good week. Thanks, man. Reeve R, what do you think about FTM? I don't know FTM. Bob. Aria, what about my road to blockchain developer? B, I'm starting from zero and I just learned the basics of HTML Css. I'm doing the basics of Javascript now. My plan is to look into react next and then solidity.
00:47:59.672 - 00:48:39.640, Speaker A: Okay, so this is a good plan and you also need to know how you're going to use this knowledge in order to get your first blockchain job. Because if you just have the knowledge in itself, it's useless if you cannot get a job. If you want to learn this, I suggest to register for my live training next week. So I very rarely do that kind of live training. So yeah, register and I'm going to explain how you can get your first blockchain job in the industry. Okay, so guys, I think we almost done. So last question.
00:48:39.640 - 00:48:51.070, Speaker A: FTM is the Phantom network. Oh yeah, I know the name, but yeah, I don't know much about them. Ari C. Choi. You're welcome. Have a good week. Okay, guys, so thanks everybody for coming.
00:48:51.070 - 00:49:14.076, Speaker A: And don't forget that this week on Friday we have another live training. Sorry, live streaming for ETB project. We're going to vote on the best implementation for the first ETB project. And next week we have the free training how to become a blockchain developer. All right, guys, have a great week. See you soon. Bye.
