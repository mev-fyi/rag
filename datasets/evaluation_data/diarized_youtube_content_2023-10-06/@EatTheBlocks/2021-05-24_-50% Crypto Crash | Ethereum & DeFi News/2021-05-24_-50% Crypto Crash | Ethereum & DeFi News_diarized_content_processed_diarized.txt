00:00:13.380 - 00:00:34.240, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and defy. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight, even though recently I've been more and more late. I'm so sorry guys. So if you don't know me, I'm Julian, you host and onidoblogs. I teach blockchain development.
00:00:34.240 - 00:01:09.320, Speaker A: And so quickly, before we jump into the news of crypto, so two things. So first of all, tomorrow at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight, I will be doing another live training. So a private live training to create your own token on the binance merchant. And we will fork Safemoon. So if you want to book your seat, you can go to the website of the blocks and book your seat. If you cannot make it for tomorrow, if you purchase your seat, you will still be able to access the recording.
00:01:09.320 - 00:01:56.952, Speaker A: And actually we are going to start to do this regularly. And so the week after that, in one week, we already have the next live training, which is a schedule, and it's going to be a live training on developing apps on Polygon, Polygon which is the leading l two scaling solution on Ethereum. And this time it's not going to be me who teach it, but it's going to be a new teacher. Alexand, which used to be my students, find his first blockchain job and really is super good. And it was so good that actually I wanted to hire him for this live training. He's an expert in Polygon. And so let me put the link for the second live training for next week.
00:01:56.952 - 00:02:47.412, Speaker A: So I'm super, super excited to start having some other teachers for the platform. We interviewed so many different teachers really find the best for this live training and really Alexand really impressed me by his capacity to explain things clearly. You can actually find a video of Alexander on my channel, I think something like six months ago I interviewed him on my channel. And so if you want to see him talking, you can search on my channel, student find first blockchain job and you will find his video. So hi everybody in the chat, who do we have here today? We have Dixon, we have George, we have Artemi, we have Dan, we have CM. Tada. Dunami, TShx, Plv, NatO, Dunclair.
00:02:47.412 - 00:03:11.420, Speaker A: Wow. Many people. Amazing. All right, so we're going to start with the market. So we're going to start with bitcoin. So bitcoin, big decrease this week. It was a terrible week, not only for bitcoin, but for ether as really, really terrible week in crypto.
00:03:11.420 - 00:03:46.680, Speaker A: It's probably the worst week since one year or something like this. So why this happened? So, of course, we had a couple of tweets of Elon Musk that started this whole crash. It was about one week ago. And then we had some additional negative news from China. So Beijing decided to basically ban crypto. So they banned banks and payment firms from providing services related to cryptocurrency. They also said that they're going to crack down on bitcoin mining and trading activity.
00:03:46.680 - 00:04:27.480, Speaker A: It's not the first time that China said some really negative things about crypto and after backtrack. So we don't really know if this is going to be long term or not. But, yeah, so that was a really terrible week for crypto. However, not all is negative because, for example, in Russia, russian officials said that they're considering a partial lift on the ban on cryptos. Really? We don't really know where we're going in terms of regulation. Like, one week we have a bad news, one week we have a good news. So I just think that either way, the market is going to overreact.
00:04:27.480 - 00:05:07.252, Speaker A: So when it comes to the market cap of Defi, well, it was also a big crash because a lot of it is indexed on Ethereum. So here we went from almost 90 billion to 50 billion, almost divided by half. That's such a shame because we were about to break the 100 billion threshold, but we totally missed it. Also, the number of ether in the system decreased. So, yeah, it's really bad everywhere. And when you look at the price of the Defi token, that's also really terrible week. We almost have only red.
00:05:07.252 - 00:05:30.124, Speaker A: So the token of the Venice protocol and the binance smart chain. Something bad happened. We'll talk about this later. Really a lot of really terrible performance. I think uni also was something like -50% sushi swap, like all the pancake swap, -50% almost. We have very few green token here. Yeah.
00:05:30.124 - 00:05:50.164, Speaker A: I mean, the best performance was 11%. Yeah. Such a big joke. All right, so it is what it is. As a blockchain developer, you cannot really overreact to this. Investors always overreact. But us, we got to keep building.
00:05:50.164 - 00:06:23.148, Speaker A: And actually, it's what I see on eido blocks, because the past few days and the past few days have been absolutely excellent for the sales of my blockchain courses. And actually, this month is going to be the best months ever for either blocks. So that show you one thing. Traders might be selling, but builders keep building. Keep learning. So don't be scared, guys, I haven't sold one way of Easter. I'm not going to sell anything -50% no problem.
00:06:23.148 - 00:06:48.040, Speaker A: I'm still in. We are in a period of volatility. It is what it is, but it doesn't change anything about the long term outlook of crypto. So if you're new to crypto, you got to be used to this, really. Don't freak out then. So we're going to talk, give some news about some defi project now. So let's start with Uniswap.
00:06:48.040 - 00:07:22.544, Speaker A: I mean dexes in general. So because of this crazy market volatility, all the dexes on Ethereum reached some record level volume. We went above 10 billion when we combined all the trading volume. So yeah, all the decks smashed their record. Uniswap, sushi swap, et cetera. Then especially about Uniswap V three that was just released a few weeks ago. It just flipped the trading volume on compared to Uniswap V two.
00:07:22.544 - 00:08:14.292, Speaker A: So that's for the daily trading volume and for the monthly trading volume. Probably in a couple of weeks it will flip Uniswap V two. So Uniswap v three is more capital efficient, which means with less capital, liquidity providers can earn more trading fees. So logically it should soon become the first Dex on Ethereum. Then some news for Sushiswap, which is the second largest Dex on Ethereum. Originally that was a fork of Uniswap, but they started to add more and more custom feature and they are going to introduce a launch pad. So a launch pad allow project to easily launch their token on a decentralized exchange with a liquidity pool right away.
00:08:14.292 - 00:09:16.736, Speaker A: So it's sort of like a token sale plus a listing, but in the same operation. And it is really becoming the standard way of launching your project. So with their launch pad, you will be able to configure different kind of token. So you can choose if it's a governance token, if it's just a standard ES 20 token, you have different choice. And when it comes also to the way you're going to sell to distribute your token, you have different choice. So it can be a basic crowd sales, it's basically like an ICO, it can be a dutch auction, what they call a batch auction, so can be a little bit more sophisticated. So if you are a crypto builder and you're launching your token, why would you use a launch pad like this? Well, the big advantage is that you are going to leverage the huge user base of Sushiswap, because each of this launch is going to be broadcasted in the community of Sushiswap.
00:09:16.736 - 00:09:53.264, Speaker A: So it's going to help you a lot for marketing technically. It also help you a lot because you're going to use their smart contract that have been audited, that are probably more safe than what you could create, build yourself. So it's also going to help you a lot. Also, a lot of the logic, the parameters they will suggest really makes sense. So it's a guarantee that you're not going to do a mistake. However, in terms of downside, when you use a launch pad, it means that you are going to be less free because you have to choose according to the options they give you. So this might not suit you.
00:09:53.264 - 00:10:24.680, Speaker A: You also need to be approved by their launch pad. So it's not as permissionless as if you were launching your token on your own. And for the first project launch on their launch pad, it's going to be a token called Sake. So actually this token is going to be super expensive. I think that one sake is going to be something like $2 million or something like this. Absolutely insane. So it's token with a very limited edition, and each token is redeemable against a bottle of sake.
00:10:24.680 - 00:11:12.652, Speaker A: So it better be super good, because at $2 million per bottle, man, you better appreciate each micro, each moment, really, seriously. And this is a project that is done by the team of Sushiswap themselves. So they are dog fooding their own launch pad. All right, so then some news from Polygon, which is the leading l two scaling solution for Ethereum. So polygon has a lot of traction. Their tokens went up like crazy, of course, with the crypto crash, it went down, but now it's back up again. And so they already have 75,000 active users for the last seven days.
00:11:12.652 - 00:11:50.804, Speaker A: It's absolutely huge. And the leading application on polygon is called quickswap. Quickswap, which is basically a Dex and quick swap, also start to have some significant traction. So, yeah, it's really finally a project that you have to keep your eye on, because a lot of what you see today on Binance March and in the future, it's going to go on polygon, I can tell you that. Then we're going to talk a little bit of binance march. So it was pretty bad week for binance smart chain, because they saw a couple of attacks. So the first attack came on the Venice protocol.
00:11:50.804 - 00:12:37.056, Speaker A: So Venice is a lending protocol on binance march, and that's the biggest one and it saw $200 million of liquidation. But these weren't really normal liquidation. That's because a lot of this liquidation were triggered by a manipulation of price for the xvs token. Xvs is the native governance token of the Venus protocol. And so the attacker manipulated this price by placing large order and trigger all this liquidation. It's unclear how they took advantage of this, but the fact is a lot of people lost money because when you are liquidated, part of your collateral is seize and auction. So I'm not sure what's the penalty for the Venice protocol.
00:12:37.056 - 00:13:07.504, Speaker A: I know that on compound is 5%. I guess this is similar on Venice. So, yeah, for example, if you borrowed for, I don't know, like $10,000 on Venice and you liquidated, well, you lose $500. So it's not ideal. Then another bad news for binance smart chain. There was a big attack for the bunny market. I'm losing track.
00:13:07.504 - 00:13:57.852, Speaker A: Yeah, basically the bunny project was attacked by using a flash loan from pancake swap. And so in the end, so the price of Bud bunny token was manipulated, and in the end, the project lost $45 million. So, yes, one of the largest attack on binance smart chain. Okay, so next we're going to continue with some news for NFTs. So, first of all, there is this really nice dashboard for Opensea where we can see the open volume of Opensea. So here we can see that OpeNC now is trading almost above 100 million for the past few months. So it start to be quite significant.
00:13:57.852 - 00:14:34.350, Speaker A: Then you can see the comparison with wearable, which is the number two NFT marketplace. Really, OpeNC is still way ahead. OpeNC was the first NFT marketplace. They recently raised a ton of money. And even though we don't talk so much about them, but they actually are the largest NFT marketplace, and very important, you have to check out their trading fee. And so they've been making between five and 10 million of trading fee each month for the past few months. So it's clearly a project that is making serious money.
00:14:34.350 - 00:15:25.288, Speaker A: So these figures are very far away from what we can see on Uniswap, but this is already quite encouraging. Next, some news from another NFT project called Uniqly. This is an NFT trading protocol. And so this allow you to have fractional ownership of NFT, because the big problem of NFT is that you have to buy a whole NFT, and this can be extremely expensive. But with uniql, you can buy just a fraction of an NFT. And so they saw a huge increase in their user base of 800%. And that was largely due to one of their project which is called the Jenny Dao.
00:15:25.288 - 00:16:15.420, Speaker A: So in the Jenny Dao, if you are not knowledgeable in NFT, you just invest in a Dao. And they're going to invest in a couple of NFT projects. So it's a very simple way to invest in next till NFT. So we saw the first sell of an NFT for a YouTube video that is called Charlie Beat my finger. So why this YouTube video was so famous is because apparently that was the first viral video released I think in 2014. And yeah, so someone bought it for an NFT and as a result it will be removed of the channel to make it more special. So that actually gives me some idea for the video of the blocks.
00:16:15.420 - 00:16:45.392, Speaker A: I'm kidding. Don't worry guys, I'm not going to remove any video. Yeah. Okay, so that was it for the menus of this week. So next we are going to do the Q and A. So very briefly let me remind you of two live trainings. So next week, in one week they're going to be a live training for developing blockchain application on Polygon, which is the leading l two scaling solution on Ethereum.
00:16:45.392 - 00:17:21.772, Speaker A: If you are a blockchain developer, you need to know how to develop some app on Polygon because this is the leading l two scaling solution. This training will be done not by me but by a teacher that we hired. Is the first teacher we hire on idoblox. He used to be a student of idoblox, is one of my best students. He found a job after following my course and he's super good technically, is really an expert on polygons. That's why we chose him. We interviewed many teacher and he was really the best for this topic.
00:17:21.772 - 00:17:55.304, Speaker A: So if you guys are interested, I put the link in the description in the chat and also have another training. Okay, so actually let me see, let me show you the other training. That's for tomorrow. Other training. If you want to create your own safe moon and create your own token on finance smart chain, tomorrow at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight, I'm going to do this. So this is going to be outside of YouTube.
00:17:55.304 - 00:18:22.036, Speaker A: You need to book your seat and this one is going to be with me. All right, so let me scroll up and see what kind of question we have. So what do we have here? What a crazy week. TP saying this for real will come back even stronger. Yes. Dixon saying ether resisting like a king at 1700. Yes.
00:18:22.036 - 00:18:33.048, Speaker A: Georgie hi, Julian. Hi, everybody. Georgie, I've lost $2,000 in a pancake swap bunny Hack. I think that you're going to talk about that. Oh, yeah, man. Oh, that sucks. That sucks, man.
00:18:33.048 - 00:18:54.444, Speaker A: You know what? Don't think about it. Think about all the money you're going to make in the future. All right? Abracadabra. Viva la France. Thanks, man. Dan Biton saying, make sure to book a spot in the safe moon next safe moon live be. It's going to be epic.
00:18:54.444 - 00:19:04.100, Speaker A: Thank you, Siama Tamda. Hey, Julian. Dunamis. Peace, everyone. Thx hi, Julian. Plv. Hello, guys.
00:19:04.100 - 00:19:13.828, Speaker A: NATO saying you caused the flash. No, no, no. It's not me. Dunkler. What a. Yes. Yes.
00:19:13.828 - 00:19:30.312, Speaker A: But you know what? Personally, I was ready for this. I knew this could happen at any. Yeah, I wasn't surprised. And I'm not worried. For me, everything is fine. I slept perfectly fine. I'm not worried at all.
00:19:30.312 - 00:19:52.864, Speaker A: The blocks is doing great for me. It doesn't change anything. But of course, I'm sorry for people who lost money. But you got to think long term, okay? If you invest in crypto, if you decide to build your career on crypto, this is for long term. Short term. No, you got to be ready to take these hits. Vision music hello.
00:19:52.864 - 00:20:07.956, Speaker A: Julian, where is the link for the live training tomorrow? Okay, yeah, I just copy pasted it in the chat below. Lucas hello from USA. Hey, man. Alper. Hello from Istanbul, bro. Hey, man. Lucas.
00:20:07.956 - 00:20:27.420, Speaker A: Jordan. Julian, have you considered creating grid trading boats? I'm not aware of a grid trading boat. So you teach me something new. I need to do some research. Shiv. Hi, JP actual. How does one bridge eth from the binance smart chain to Polygon? I'm not sure to understand the question.
00:20:27.420 - 00:20:51.396, Speaker A: I think you're asking me how the bridge work between Ethereum, between binance marching and Polygon. This I don't know. But in the training on Polygon next week, we're going to explain how the bridge work between Ethereum and Polygon. Dunclaude say China banned bitcoin. I think you mean China banned bitcoin already. Two or three times. Yeah.
00:20:51.396 - 00:21:05.316, Speaker A: It's not new. Really? Yes. Saying I think you need to check how Erosh works. Okay. I don't know this project, Christian hi, everyone. Abracadaba. It's called Pancake Bunny.
00:21:05.316 - 00:21:13.488, Speaker A: Yeah. MP. Hello, Julian. TP. Hello from TP fifth star. Hey, man. Constantin.
00:21:13.488 - 00:21:45.040, Speaker A: Hello, Julian. Is it the same price for every live training? For now, yes. For now, yes. We might do a subscription sometime in the future, but at the beginning at least it's going to be sold individually and at the same price. Yeah. Kali, when I build my trading boat following your tutorials, but each time my boat execute I get a sandwich attack by other boats and get a bad rate. Any way to avoid this? By the way, love your tutorial.
00:21:45.040 - 00:22:26.420, Speaker A: Thanks, man. Yeah, so you can put some required statements where only your address can execute successfully the transaction. So there are some boat that are smarter that can still figure it out but it's going to improve the situation already. Kimberly, if I've purchased lifetime in the blocks membership, is the safemoon training still pet? No. So lifetime membership, it includes all the live training. Don't worry. By can we pay in crypto for tomorrow? Yes, yes you can go in the faq and it's explained how to do that.
00:22:26.420 - 00:23:01.596, Speaker A: THX, what's the Dodge coin price today? I don't check Dodge coin by and what time will be live in UK time please? You have to check but I think UK is UTC plus one. And me, I give my time in UTC plus eight. Yeah, so you have to remove 7 hours. So if it's 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. Yeah, it's eleven minus seven for the UK, which is 04:00 p.m. Yeah, 04:00 p.m.
00:23:01.596 - 00:23:48.088, Speaker A: UK time. Constantine, do you think this crash is the same which happened in 2017? Well, first of all, we need to wait a little bit to see if it's not a local crash and not a long term crash because maybe now it looked like a crash, but maybe the market is going to bounce back and in the future it will just look as a blip on the chart. So we don't know yet. We need to wait to really see if it's a big crash or not. But yeah, you guys got to be believer. You got to stay in it. If it's a big crash like the one in 2017, you got to understand that the guys who do really well during the next bubble, they are the one who stay between cycles.
00:23:48.088 - 00:24:20.436, Speaker A: If you just pop up when things are going up and then you leave right away, you will never benefit from the next bubble. Like for example, eat the blocks totally exploded during this bull run. It has been absolutely crazy. It was multiplied by ten in terms of everything. And the reason why we were able to do this is because I was already there during the previous cycle. I didn't just stop eat the blocks in the meantime, I keep working on it. And so that's the same for your career as a blockchain developer.
00:24:20.436 - 00:24:51.808, Speaker A: You want to keep working on it. But in any case, I think this time is different, even though we might have a crash, but there is still a lot of money that was invested in the space and this money is not going to evaporate like now. This money is in the treasury of many blockchain projects and they have to spend this money no matter what. So really, I'm really not. Wait for the prospect of careers in blockchain. Franco, hello from Argentina. Hey, man.
00:24:51.808 - 00:25:50.576, Speaker A: Natho, the guy who did the flash loan learned from you, sir, I don't know about that. Isaac Valdez, what do you think of definity and the Internet computer? Will you be looking into the custom smart contract language they created called Motoco? Okay, I haven't followed much this project. It seems a little bit too niche for now. Maybe if it gets bigger in the future, but yeah. Zach, do you have resources for the Python arbitrage boat? No, I do all my boat with Node js. Yeah, no, wait a second, wait a second. No, I do have one boat in Python, so that's to do some sentiment analysis on the subreddit of Reddit Wall street bets.
00:25:50.576 - 00:26:42.928, Speaker A: So I released this video a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, so check search a video for Wall street bets sentiment analysis trading boat. You'll find my video. Aman live training can be done after the day of launch. I have semester exams right now, so after the date of the live training, the recording will be available on the website of idablocks. So you can watch the replay. It's just that you won't be able to ask questions live, but you can still watch the replay and you can still ask questions in the chat because instructor will also provide support for two months in the chat after Shiv polygon or Ethereum network to make institutional level dapps.
00:26:42.928 - 00:27:01.692, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to come soon. Anansi Yamba. I almost finalized my personal project. Can I send you a video with a quick demo? I would really like to have your feedback. Okay. So actually receive a very large number of emails. So if you guys have questions about your own project or about the YouTube video.
00:27:01.692 - 00:27:41.828, Speaker A: Unfortunately, I can't really provide support for this. But what you can do is you can ask your question in the Facebook group of idWblox. And the Facebook group has grown a lot and now it's pretty active. And when you take one of my course, you also have access to the private discord, which is even more active. And the discussion are super high quality. What else do we have Christian, do you plan to use avalanche C chain focus or demo coding? Avalanche? Maybe if there is enough demand. So we're going to keep doing this live training hopefully every week with a new topic.
00:27:41.828 - 00:28:07.888, Speaker A: And so, yeah, if we find some good instructor for avalanche and we have enough demand for that, we might do it. Yeah. Andresh Petrovic maybe burner exporter learn flash loan from you by is perfect. Thanks Julian. I will send you some crypto for tomorrow course. Will you send use your discord or telegram once we will have. You will have access to.
00:28:07.888 - 00:28:40.632, Speaker A: I will put the link to the discord in the course she for the polygon training tomorrow. Can a noob attend it with no prior knowledge? It's going to be tough because we. Okay, so first of all, there's a confusion. So polygon is not the training of tomorrow. Tomorrow is going to be safemoon. Polygon is in one week. And polygon is not really a training for beginner because we're not going to teach everything from the beginning.
00:28:40.632 - 00:29:17.450, Speaker A: You need to already know the basics of blockchain development. So solidity, smart contract, how to create, adapt, et cetera. So yeah, I don't think it's really suited. If you're a beginner, start with my playlist on solidity on my channel. Start to exercise yourself. And after, in the future you can still buy the training, but just you won't be able to have the live, you'll have the replay, but it still be very valid. Anthony, what do you think about phantom opera? Yeah, they're making more noise, that's for sure.
00:29:17.450 - 00:30:14.920, Speaker A: Interesting. I just haven't really looked at it more closely, but I know that they start to have some traction. Xl eight, will you teach people how to make a coin on the Ethereum blockchain? So the training of tomorrow, it's for creating a coin on binance smart chain by forking safemoon. But everything I teach in this live training is also applicable to Ethereum because Ethereum and binance smart chain are the same technology. Constantin, thanks for your answer. How can we purchase the lifetime membership? Okay, so unfortunately the lifetime membership, it was only available for special occasion like Black Friday last year. So most likely it will only be available for this Black Friday this year in November, but not in the meantime, unfortunately.
00:30:14.920 - 00:30:49.376, Speaker A: Promise Iowa between finance and TroN, which is the best platform to build a blockchain programming now binance smart chain because Tron is kind of dead now blockchain that. I don't have money to join this course, but I want to learn. Yeah, I have more than 400 videos on my YouTube channel. So, yeah, just start with my free videos and you can already learn a lot. Isaac Valades. The ICP token is number ten on coin market cap, and it stands for Internet computer protocol. It's one of the largest project of its kind in crypto.
00:30:49.376 - 00:31:23.116, Speaker A: I recommend you look into it. They launch their main net. Cool. Yeah, I've seen this token pop up on my feed, but yeah, I need to do some research. ThX, what's the best way to report a scam token? I mean, there is no central authority to manage scam. It's more twitter, for example. If you have bad things to say about a token Twitter, maybe you can add mention to some decks like Uniswap and pancake swap.
00:31:23.116 - 00:31:54.196, Speaker A: Maybe they have a security team to put this in a scam than that. Other than that, it's a little bit difficult. Aman Kumar can you do a front running boat? Front running boat maybe. But it's not easy to do because you need to look in the transaction pool of a node. So it's quite technical. It's quite technical. Isaac Valdez.
00:31:54.196 - 00:32:23.440, Speaker A: They have live demo of DAp running at web speed right now and more blocks than ether already, which you are talking of. The ICP protocol, I presume. Jurgu, you look a little like Tom Kavanaugh. Yeah, I mean, I take it as a compliment, I guess. Jack Breeding. Hi, Julian. What's your take on Pearl's chain eth fork? I don't know.
00:32:23.440 - 00:32:55.864, Speaker A: I need to check it out. Yeah, I spent so much time preparing this live stream, and then there are always all these projects that I don't know about. Yeah, it's the crazy thing in crypto, you always miss a lot of news. But that's okay as long as you focus on the news. For the main chain, it's the most important exhalate. How much liquidity should we add to a token, and can we take the liquidity out of this if the project fails? It's really up to you. You decide.
00:32:55.864 - 00:33:34.404, Speaker A: This can be tens of thousands of dollars. But you have to think of the fact that when you add liquidity, you also have to provide two tokens, the token itself, and also another token like BNB or some stable coins or something that you cannot mint yourself. So you need to have enough money to buy these as well. So you're limited by this. Yeah, you can take the liquidity out if the project fails. But be careful because if you do this too fast. This is called a rug pool, so careful with this abracadabra says scam token.
00:33:34.404 - 00:33:51.208, Speaker A: You can report at token. Sneefer how interesting. Piervo, do you think there are any future for Tron? No, I don't think so. I think that was just a marketing stunt. Justin Tron. Yeah, great marketer. But yeah, apart from that they really have nothing.
00:33:51.208 - 00:34:34.668, Speaker A: Binance smart chain, you can say that they are centralized so it's bad, but at least they leverage the user base of the binance exchange which has a strong strategy so they really have something that differentiates them. But for Tron it's just a copy and paste of Ethereum and that's it really block tech dev, do you have telegram for free learn. So we have a private discord for the students of the pet courses, but for everybody there is also a public community. That's the Facebook group and you'll find the link in the header of the channel by wise. Final question for you, boss. Julian. Thanks man.
00:34:34.668 - 00:35:04.260, Speaker A: What video of yours would you recommend to watch in preparation for tomorrow? And will you provide us link to specific videos please? Yeah, so I actually mentioned all of this on the sales page of the live training. So you can access, you can check this out, you will find all the link, but very quickly. I have a series on solidity, so check that one. I have a video how Ethereum work. Check also that one. I also have a video on ES 20 token. Yeah, so these three videos are the main one.
00:35:04.260 - 00:35:31.468, Speaker A: Dixon. Hey Julian, could you please do a video on using Chainlink Oracle? It's very underdocumented, especially when you want to make your own Oracle adapter. So this typically might be available as a live training. Yes, but very good suggestion. Jack deep, can we make limit orders on pancake swap? Not directly, but you can build something that allow you to do it. I might do a video on that. Yeah.
00:35:31.468 - 00:35:47.990, Speaker A: Tshx. What's token sniper? Okay, question. Mesona. A video about Mempool will be great. Ha ha. Difficult is where we learn. Yeah, actually this is a kind of super technical stuff that could be a live training, maybe a live training with this.
00:35:47.990 - 00:36:21.164, Speaker A: When China wants to load their bags, they remind us of the ban. Yes, exactly. Alper, you German of French. I'm the country of good food. Yeah, sorry my german friend, but yeah, french people, we're very proud of our food. Do you know how many people should be involved in a blockchain project? Dex? Tokeniquitable creation? Sorry if that question sounds silly. No, it's not.
00:36:21.164 - 00:37:17.020, Speaker A: I mean, you can just start on your own and you do as much as you can and you talk about your project and then you try to have other people who join who can help you. There is no exact answer for this question, but typically teams of software developer, they are between a couple to maybe 1020 developer who work together. It's already a big team, but I would say a couple of developer already. You can be quite efficient because you see the more people you have in your team, the more you have to communicate with them and then it becomes really difficult. The communication doesn't scale well with the number of developers in your team. BlockTech dev can you make a video to explain APY in defi liquidity pool works. So I have a video on YouTube to explain how to calculate APY.
00:37:17.020 - 00:37:52.508, Speaker A: You can check this. Jack deep, what's your review on Solana blockchain? I think I checked very quickly. It seems they have smart contract in rust and yeah, it just seems more complicated than Ethereum. This is all I can say for now. So this is really going to slow down the adoption. Every time you see one of these blockchain that maybe is like maybe more powerful than Ethereum, but the blockchain tools are also more harder. Don't use a simple language similar to Javascript every time you see this.
00:37:52.508 - 00:38:30.132, Speaker A: That means the adoption is going to be more limited. Clearly. Mercena, how would you proceed to execute pre order transaction on chain like limit orders? Do you have any advice? You might want to have a look at the. Oh, what's the. I have a blank here. What is this project that has been used since a couple of months and that reduced the transaction fee on Ethereum? Sorry man, I have a blank. But oh, flashboat.
00:38:30.132 - 00:39:27.572, Speaker A: Yeah, so you probably can do this with flashboat. Yeah, so do research on flashboat. Andrew, nice Zimco, any opinion why BNB jumping for almost 40% in a day? Did I miss any news? I just think you're going to see a lot of coin jumping back up because the crash over the past few days have been really excessive. So it's basically like the huge gdp growth that we have in 2021, it's just a mechanical gdp growth after the big crash we had in 2020. So yeah, just a mechanical increase, I would say. Then. Res are there still opportunities to make monies with flash loan? So there is never a moment in time where you don't have opportunities anymore.
00:39:27.572 - 00:39:50.800, Speaker A: It's just that actors becomes more and more sophisticated and becomes more and more competitive. But people still make money with flash loans. Of course. What is saying french food is the best? Yes, exactly. That was the smartest comment of today. Azer teeth. Okay, so I'm going to translate in English.
00:39:50.800 - 00:40:40.768, Speaker A: Do you explain the whole process for the coin? Liquidity lock ownership, renounce, et cetera in the course. So I'm going to liquidity lock. I haven't thought about this especially, but I can maybe add it. Renounce ownership. So, yeah, I haven't planned it now, but probably this can be part of the Q A section. Yeah, it's hard to interact with contracts on Solana Iy saying yes, indeed. Jake breeding ethereum has a network effect.
00:40:40.768 - 00:41:08.740, Speaker A: There is no eth killing anymore. Yes, iy saying flashboats. Yes. Flashboat, pool teeth gist. Is it worthwhile to learn how to use geth if I'll be building dapps? If you're just getting started, I would say don't bother with this. When you're developing dapps every day you just use truffle and ganache. Very few people use guest directly.
00:41:08.740 - 00:41:36.204, Speaker A: You would use guest if you want to do some advanced stuff like access the mem pool or maybe working on a sort of private testnet, but for most use case, you don't need it. So, yeah, I would say don't forget about guess at the beginning. Iy Julian, are you the one behind these flashing attacks? Yes, but please keep it a secret. Z. Hi, Julian. Hey, man. Abracadabra.
00:41:36.204 - 00:41:41.744, Speaker A: See you next time, guys. I'm driving. Yeah. Great to have you. Abracadabra. Jake Breeding. Julian, your face is out of frame.
00:41:41.744 - 00:41:54.040, Speaker A: Oh, man. Yeah, at some point I'm going to improve my setup to have like a bigger face. Abracadabra. Avivala, France. Yes. Thanks, man. Young Michael Metamoon is great project.
00:41:54.040 - 00:42:19.532, Speaker A: Go, go. Okay, I don't know that Azatis, thanks. Your video are very helpful. Okay, great. Well, guys, I think we're reaching the end of this live stream. So what we're going to do now is just going to quickly copy paste the link for the training of tomorrow. So if you want to learn how to create your own safe moon.
00:42:19.532 - 00:42:34.990, Speaker A: And lastly, if you want to develop dapps on Polygon, there's another upcoming live training next week. I also put the link in the description. Okay, thanks, guys. Have a great.
