00:00:00.410 - 00:00:01.770, Speaker A: On the left I have a contract.
00:00:01.850 - 00:00:04.846, Speaker B: With hundreds of lines of code and I don't know what it does.
00:00:04.948 - 00:00:06.442, Speaker A: On the right I have a graphical.
00:00:06.506 - 00:00:08.394, Speaker B: Representation of this contract.
00:00:08.522 - 00:00:12.718, Speaker A: It shows the functions that are declared in this contract and how each function.
00:00:12.804 - 00:00:18.282, Speaker B: Calls into other functions. It also shows how it connects to other contracts.
00:00:18.346 - 00:00:19.350, Speaker A: So in this video I'm going to.
00:00:19.360 - 00:00:24.030, Speaker B: Show you a vs code extension that allows you to visualize your smart contracts.
00:00:24.610 - 00:00:28.738, Speaker A: So so the first thing that we'll.
00:00:28.754 - 00:00:36.790, Speaker B: Need is to install the vs code extension. So I'll click on this extension logo and then search for solidity.
00:00:37.930 - 00:00:41.862, Speaker A: The Vs code extension that we're going to install is called solidity.
00:00:41.926 - 00:00:45.290, Speaker B: Visual developers click on it and hit install.
00:00:45.440 - 00:00:56.270, Speaker A: After you install the extension, open the contract. For this example, we will open unisoft b three pool contract and open the command palette by hitting ctrl shift v.
00:00:56.340 - 00:01:03.086, Speaker B: And then type Surya Surya to generate a graph for this contract that we.
00:01:03.108 - 00:01:05.546, Speaker A: Have opened, we'll execute the command call.
00:01:05.588 - 00:01:12.754, Speaker B: Graph for active editor. On the right you'll see a graph pop up. Let's take a look at this graph. I'll zoom in.
00:01:12.872 - 00:01:16.046, Speaker A: Notice that you can see some circles and some lines.
00:01:16.158 - 00:01:27.078, Speaker B: Some lines are white and other ones are green. Each circle represents a function and each arrow means that a function is calling into another function. For example here you see the function.
00:01:27.164 - 00:01:29.626, Speaker A: Mint and the arrow points to a.
00:01:29.648 - 00:01:31.834, Speaker C: Function called balance zero.
00:01:31.952 - 00:01:33.658, Speaker B: This means that inside the mint function.
00:01:33.744 - 00:01:36.474, Speaker C: It'S calling another function called balance zero.
00:01:36.592 - 00:01:38.186, Speaker A: The green arrow means that it is.
00:01:38.208 - 00:01:43.594, Speaker B: An internal call, whereas the white arrow means that it is an external call to another contract.
00:01:43.722 - 00:01:45.630, Speaker A: So if I zoom out and follow.
00:01:45.700 - 00:01:56.318, Speaker B: One of the white arrows, you can see that the white arrows are calling a library called tick mask and ticks. This also applies to external contracts.
00:01:56.494 - 00:01:58.098, Speaker A: You can also click on a function.
00:01:58.184 - 00:01:59.698, Speaker B: For example, I'll click on the function.
00:01:59.784 - 00:02:02.446, Speaker A: Swap and notice that only the functions.
00:02:02.478 - 00:02:05.010, Speaker B: That are called by the swap are highlighted.
00:02:05.510 - 00:02:08.194, Speaker A: So for example, the swap function calls.
00:02:08.242 - 00:02:10.470, Speaker C: Balance one and balance one.
00:02:10.540 - 00:02:13.926, Speaker B: If I follow it calls static call.
00:02:14.108 - 00:02:20.486, Speaker A: Let's take a look at another example. If I click on the function flash then I can see that it calls.
00:02:20.518 - 00:02:42.666, Speaker B: Into internal functions balance zero, balance one, flash and iunisoft b three flash callback. It also has some white arrows, meaning that it is calling an external contract or a library contract. And you can see here that it is calling some simple functions like add, add, safe, transfer, Maldiv and Maldive rounding.
00:02:42.698 - 00:02:46.942, Speaker A: Up and to close the graph just click on the axis and also close.
00:02:46.996 - 00:02:48.222, Speaker B: This file as well.
00:02:48.356 - 00:02:52.494, Speaker A: Don't save so that was a quick video about a BS code extension that.
00:02:52.532 - 00:02:55.380, Speaker B: Allows you to visualize a smart contract. Thanks for watching.
