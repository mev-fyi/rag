00:00:13.690 - 00:00:58.314, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi. Today we will be talking about the uni token yield farming, Defi pulse index and a major crypto exchange that becomes a bank and much more. We'll do the q and a at the end, as usual. For those who don't know me, I'm Julian, your host, and on my channel eat the blogs, I teach defi blockchain development and how to find your first blockchain job. And before we continue, quick shout out to my tool courses. If you want to become a blockchain developer and make year like I used to make, register for my course six figure blockchain developer.
00:00:58.314 - 00:01:15.730, Speaker A: And if you want to learn how to make arbitrage flash loan, check my other course on flash loan. So hi to the people in the chat. Hi Nick. Hi Jaywood. Hi jan, hi Thomas. Hi siyam, Tanda. Hi everybody.
00:01:15.730 - 00:01:42.620, Speaker A: It's great to have you. Where you guys from? Tell me in the chat. So we will start with the prices of ether. So it's a bit flat this week, it's a bit boring. It's not too bad because stocks are a bit done in comparison. So yeah, nothing special here. I hope we'll be back to the 400 level very soon.
00:01:42.620 - 00:02:38.058, Speaker A: Yeah, so the situation on the gas fees, very important to keep an eye on this because currently that's one of the main problem of the Ethereum network. So unfortunately we are back to crazy town with super high fees. It's probably related to all this uni token yield farming that happened on uniswap. That's the explanation for the gas fee. It's not ideal. I really hope that we're going to get back to 100 guac with this is really difficult unless you trade for really big volume, like people who do yield farming, who successfully yield farm like they put like five k, ten k. If you just do like one k or $500, it's going to be a bit tough with this really high fee.
00:02:38.058 - 00:03:13.394, Speaker A: All right, so next let's have some news about Ethereum. So one of the core developer of Ethereum. So Ethereum 1.0, not Ethereum 2.0. So released a paper in which he said he believed that we can scale Ethereum by ten times without any shouting, without Ethereum 2.0. So far it's just one researcher who said this. So we probably need other researcher who bring in two cent just to validate his thesis.
00:03:13.394 - 00:03:51.090, Speaker A: But if it's true, that's really big because that means that before we get Ethereum 2.0, we could have some substantial scaling gain on the Ethereum blockchain and that could really of course, decrease a lot the gas fee. So let's cross our finger and wait and see what happened here. All the news about Ethereum 2.0 this is an article posted by Daniel Ryan if you into Ethereum 2.0, Daniel Ryan is someone that coordinate and make the synthesis of a lot of different information. So what he posts is always very interesting.
00:03:51.090 - 00:04:27.786, Speaker A: So if you've been following Ethereum 2.0, you probably heard of the medala testnet. So that's a testnet where basically they were trying to see if all the different client for Ethereum 2.0 were working well. And they have been mostly successful, except that at some point there were some synchronization problem, but it was resolved quite quickly. And so now they are talking of launching another testnet that will be short lived. So they call this the Spadina testnet.
00:04:27.786 - 00:04:56.170, Speaker A: So this is going to be short lived. It's only going to be three day. And so this testnet will be closer to main net. So it will have the same parameter as testnet. So in other words, really this is the last step before we get the launch of main net for Ethereum 2.0. So that's super bullish for Ethereum. When I talking of Ethereum 2.0,
00:04:56.170 - 00:05:29.342, Speaker A: main net, this is not the final version. So there are different phases. And for phase zero, we won't really be able to use it. I believe we'll be able to stake already, but that's it, there'll be different phase. So that just means this is one step on the roadmap for the final release of Ethereum 2.0 where when we can actually use it, this is probably going to be in 2021 or 2022. So let's not get too excited, but still a little bit excited.
00:05:29.342 - 00:05:53.402, Speaker A: But it's probably going to be bullish for the price of ether, that's for sure. All right, so next we're going to talk of the market cap of DFI. So let's go to my favorite website, DFI pearls. So we are at almost 9.8 billion. So that's 1.35 billion more than last week.
00:05:53.402 - 00:06:16.178, Speaker A: So it's very good. As you can see on the chart is like almost vertical. This is really amazing. The rebound kind of continues. So that's good. So if you remember when the stock market went down a couple of weeks ago, we had this sharp decline, but quickly we went into rebound mode. So that's really cool.
00:06:16.178 - 00:06:49.642, Speaker A: And actually, if you switch to the view in ether, the rebound is even more impressive. So that's very cool in terms of the project. So Uniswap is almost back to the first place. And if you check its market cap, then you can see that it has recovered all the liquidity that was stolen from sushi swap and more. Meanwhile. Meanwhile for sushi swap, let's see what happened for sushi swap. Sushi swap, where are you, number ten? Wow.
00:06:49.642 - 00:07:23.778, Speaker A: Sushi swap went down lot. So sushi swap started to lose liquidity and I'm really not surprised about it. They totally lost their credibility with the whole chef nomi screw up. So that really show you that you can't just do a copy paste of Uniswap and expect to become the next Uniswap. That can give you some initial traction. But if you don't really inspire confidence, then very quickly you can lose the liquidity that you take. So yeah, I mean, I think this is really well deserved.
00:07:23.778 - 00:07:48.126, Speaker A: Uniswap, they are way more credible than sushiswap. So yeah, I was interesting to follow this story. All right, so now let's see the market cap for the top defi token. So let's see this in Congeco. I love this page for the top defi token. So everything is down. Look at this page.
00:07:48.126 - 00:08:18.598, Speaker A: Red, red and with two digits most of the time. Wow, this is really scary. That's kind of weird because the market cap of Defi went up a lot. So yeah, maybe this is really a good buying opportunity. That's it for the prices of token. Oh yeah. So here you have a graph on Twitter where you can see that most of the tokens are down 40% from their 30 day high.
00:08:18.598 - 00:08:47.042, Speaker A: Yes, the BZx -87% like a real disaster. Sushi swap wire. You better sell your sushi right away because it's not worth a lot. Yeah, you can see some food defi token. You can see their token is really down. All right, that's life. Defi is super volatile, so if you accept it can go up a lot, then you got to be prepared for the whole ride when you go down.
00:08:47.042 - 00:09:20.720, Speaker A: All right, so now let's have a quick look at the rate. So I see many people, they never have a look at rates, but that's a mistake because even though you can make a lot of money with the yield farming and all the crazy degen stuff in defi, you can also make money simply by lending your money in some exchanges like compound, et cetera. So it's always important to keep a look on that. So for example, here with die, you can get 5% on Ave. Yeah, it's not too bad. DyDX 3%. Yeah, well, 5% on Ave, it's not too bad.
00:09:20.720 - 00:09:57.382, Speaker A: And as usual on Fulcrum, I don't know why we have this crazy rate. If anybody know why we have this crazy rate on Fulcrum, I'd be really curious to know. Maybe that fulcrum does uncollateralized loan. I don't know, but that seems crazy to me. We can have this rate. All right, then we going to continue with the news on different Defi project. All right, so the big, big news this week is that Uniswap has introduced a governance token.
00:09:57.382 - 00:10:26.900, Speaker A: So the uni token. So with this token you can govern key protocol decisions except for the control over the treasury. That's smart. I don't want to give access to the money, but actually at some point with your uni token, you will be able to vote on the treasury. But this will be delayed until October 17, I guess. Kind of makes sense. It's kind of scary for them to open up like this, so they want to stage how they do it.
00:10:26.900 - 00:11:07.738, Speaker A: So the way these tokens are going to be distributed is in two phase. So first you have the airdrop. So anyone who interacted with the Uniswap protocol since its beginning, everyone received 400 uni tokens. And at the time when it was released, that was equivalent to $1,200. So since that date, it changed a lot. Yeah, so I think it almost more than double and now it's going down a bit. But yeah, at the beginning it was 1200, so I mean, it's kind of a stimulus check by uniswap.
00:11:07.738 - 00:11:39.930, Speaker A: That's really nice. And these tokens were distributed regardless of the volume traded. So if you. Well, or if you're just a regular guy, you get the same amount of money. So yeah, I think this is really nice because that's really the first time we see that kind of distribution. There were more than 50,000 addresses that are holding uni token after just a day after they did it. So it's already higher than addresses, holding maker and comb tokens.
00:11:39.930 - 00:12:20.178, Speaker A: So this is the first phase of the distribution, but there is a second phase which will be the liquidity mining. So anybody providing liquidity in Uniswap will receive some uni tokens similar to what we have seen in other protocols. So this is going to be restricted to four poles. East USDT East USDC East Dai and ethrapcoin. So liquidity mining is proportional to liquidity. So the more liquidity you provide, the more uni token you will receive. And it seems to be a fixed amount per pool, so you will get more tokens if you provide liquidity in smaller pools.
00:12:20.178 - 00:13:02.038, Speaker A: So for the token allocation, I think they have a nice graph. Yeah, we can see it here. So, total, there will be 1 billion unitoken minted. The initial airdrop represent 15% of the total. The rest will be put in circulation over the next four years. So there will be 60% that's going to the user of the community, 21% to team member and future employees, and 17% to investors, and the rest to advisor. So everything which is given to investor and employee will have a vesting period of four years.
00:13:02.038 - 00:14:03.586, Speaker A: So that's good, because that guarantee us that they will not dump their token on the market as soon as they receive them, unlike the infamous chef nomi. So, yeah, that's quite bullish for the uni tokens. So let me give a bit of context here, because Uniswap was criticized for raising 11 million in its latest investment run from a big VC fund in the Silicon Valley. And why were they blamed for that? Because the critics said that that makes Uniswap not really align with the community interest. So sushiswap leveraged this sentiment by saying they haven't raised any money from VCN. That was a little bit the marketing. So, of course, the fact that Uniswap introduced the uni tokens now is obviously a response to sushi swap.
00:14:03.586 - 00:14:43.550, Speaker A: They saw all the liquidity going away and they had to react quickly. I think that initially they planned to release the unit tokens for Uniswap V three, but because of what was happening with sushi swap, they had to make it happen faster. So, as I said before, we saw all the liquidity taken away by Sushiswap returned to Uniswap. So that means what? The response of Uniswap was really good. It was very successful. So I think this is very, very bullish for the future of the project, because that was a test, that was a big test. Some other project tried to attack them, but they were able to figure it out and find a solution.
00:14:43.550 - 00:15:21.194, Speaker A: And we want to have this test. Like, if this is just a smooth sailing and nothing happened, how can you be sure that when there is a problem, they will react well? So, yeah, I'm happy there was this test and they passed it. I mean, if you want to make a comparison, same thing for the Mendala testnet, there were some problem during the testing, and that's good. We want to have problem and to solve them, otherwise we don't grow at all. Okay, so good news for Uniswap. So next news. So, Defi pulse introduced a defi index.
00:15:21.194 - 00:16:00.890, Speaker A: So the Defi pulse index. So that's a capitalization weighted index of ten popular defi tokens. So you have wifi, land, SNX, comp maker, Bal, and other. Actually, you have the full list here. So capitalization weighted, that means that it's constantly readjusted according to the market cap value of each token. So, for example, I don't know, if wifi represents 10% of the total market cap of all these tokens, then this must be reflected in the index. So in order to build this index, they used the set protocol.
00:16:00.890 - 00:16:38.110, Speaker A: So the set protocol, if you never heard of that, this is a really cool project. So it didn't get a lot of exposure recently, but it's a shame because it really has a lot of potential. So we set, anybody can be a fund manager on the blockchain. Set protocols call each of these funds a set. So there are two kind of sets. There are sets that are managed by the set protocol itself, and there are also self that are managed by third party, like the DeFi pulse index. So with this DeFi pulse index, this is a very, very easy way to invest in DeFi without having to risk everything on a single token.
00:16:38.110 - 00:17:18.962, Speaker A: So in terms of risk management, that's really good. It's also a great way to minimize gas fees because you just need to pay for one transaction to buy the index. And after the index, that's the rebalancing itself. So you don't have to cover these gas fees. And in this context of super gas fees, this is super important. So if you've been on the fence about DeFi, you're really excited about all these crazy yields, but because of the Ethereum gas fees you really turn off that might be a good opportunity to finally get started. And by the way, like I said before, anybody can create a set on the set protocol so yourself, you could also be a fund manager.
00:17:18.962 - 00:17:43.390, Speaker A: So really encourage you to check out the set protocol. I think we're going to hear more of this protocol in the future. All right, so, next piece of news. So BZX managed to recover the funds that were stolen in the hack. So if you haven't followed. So BZX, this is sort of a derivative exchange. So an advanced decentralized exchange.
00:17:43.390 - 00:18:36.990, Speaker A: So it had a very good beginning at the beginning of this year when it were launched, but it was attacked several times at the beginning of the year, very shortly after its launch, for a total amount of $1 million. So that was a very complex attack using a flash loan. And I think I covered this attack in one of my video about flash loan on my channel. And after this attack, of course, the team of BZX decided to post the spot contract, and so they went back to work to fix it. And so, yeah, on top of it, they managed to recover the fund. So that's really nice for all the investors. All right, so next, so Kraken, one of the big centralized exchange, became a bank in the US.
00:18:36.990 - 00:19:08.442, Speaker A: So that's really the first centralized exchange which managed to do this. That's really big. So it will not be a bank like all the banks because it cannot have fractional reserves. So like traditional bank, if you deposit $1,000, they don't keep $1,000, they just keep maybe $100 and the rest they lend it. This is how they make a lot of money. But of course, if there is a bank run, then that means you finally realize that they don't have all the money. So this can be a huge issue.
00:19:08.442 - 00:20:00.982, Speaker A: So you will never, never have this issue with Kraken. So in terms of peace of mind, that's really good. So I think also this means that the importance of all the bridge between fiat money and crypto will progressively be less important, because now if you can just keep all your crypto in a bank and have it guarantee everything, you don't have to protect your private key, then I think we'll see more people keeping their money in crypto, maybe not in ether, but at least in stablecoin. And I'm expecting more exchanges to introduce this. So, really positive for Defi. All right, so that was the news for Defi. So now we're going to go over the news for developers.
00:20:00.982 - 00:21:07.770, Speaker A: So first there is a context, so the underhanded context that is organized by the team of solidity. And so in this context, you have to create a smart contract that look innocent but has some security vulnerabilities. This year, the theme of the context is upgradable smart contract. So you have to make an upgradable smart contract that has some security vulnerability, but it's not at first look, you don't really see them. And the main requirement is that in the mechanism, it has to be flawed such that there is just a single account in control, even if it doesn't seem like it. So in terms of prizes, let me see, where do they have the prizes? So yeah, you have one ticket to Defcon, you have some access to some PED developer tool? Yeah, but I think the best price is the ticket to Defcon six. Well, I hope that at that time the COVID epidemic will be over, otherwise we're going to have a virtual.
00:21:07.770 - 00:21:56.586, Speaker A: No, I mean, no, Defcon six is this year. No, it will be virtual, unfortunately. Okay, so they show you the price, but to me it seems like the real price of this context is that if you are selected as one of the finalists, you can show this off on your cv and you can use this as a leverage to get a higher pay, really? And I think this is also a great way to learn about security. So if you're interested, the submissions open at 1 October and end of October, and the winners will be announced by the end of November. All right, next. First release of Webstery. So, Webstery, which is the most popular library to connect to the Ethereum blockchain.
00:21:56.586 - 00:22:37.050, Speaker A: This is the first release since the project was taken over by chainsafe. So chainsafe, this is a tool for security analysis. And so for this release, they rewrote everything in typescript. So this will probably make it easier to use Webstery in typescript project. Why does this matter? It matters because in typescript is more and more required for high end, front end position. So it's a good idea to switch to typescript, even if personally I don't like the sort of extra complexity it brings. But carrier wise it can really bring some benefit.
00:22:37.050 - 00:23:08.182, Speaker A: And next create ETh app. So that's a tool that allow you to very quickly bootstrap some decentralized application projects. So they added support for web3 model. So Webster model. This is a project I think I cover in one of my video. This is a project that allow you to very easily integrate many kind of wallets. So not just metamask, but you have access.
00:23:08.182 - 00:23:37.850, Speaker A: I think it covers like five or six wallets. So yeah, that's very good to make your DAP compatible with all kind of wallet available. It's a good news. And finally, I wanted to briefly mention this project, ethers rs. So that's basically a port of the Ethers library. So Ethers, this is a little bit similar to web3, but this is like an alternative to web3, allow you to connect to the blockchain. And so this is a port of ether.
00:23:37.850 - 00:24:20.438, Speaker A: But in rust, if you never heard of Rust, this is a low level language that is becoming super popular. It was created by Mozilla and now it's being used more and more as a sort of replacement to c. So this can be useful to use rust for blockchain if you need to do something with high performance. For example, if you want to do some arbitrage on the blockchain. However, you have to know that rust is way more difficult than Javascript because you have to declare all the type in solidity. But also you have a lot of very advanced concepts. So this is really not for the faint of heart.
00:24:20.438 - 00:25:03.722, Speaker A: If you have a background in low level languages and you are curious, you can check it out. But if you're a beginner, I really don't recommend to check out ether rust. All right, so now finally we're getting to the Q A. So let me just quickly repost the link to my two course six figure blockchain developer to learn blockchain development and profitable flash loan to learn flash loan arbitrage. All right, so now I'm going to scroll up and see what are the question and answer all the questions in order. Okay, so, hi again, two people haven't greeted yet. Thomas Philip J.
00:25:03.722 - 00:25:27.042, Speaker A: Nelson Fox. Wow, we have many people in the chat today. This is amazing. All right, so someone asked me why market is down. Market is not really down, it's slightly increasing. I would say stable slightly increasing. All right, Philip said this is the finally pre recorded market is way down.
00:25:27.042 - 00:26:10.666, Speaker A: It depends. No, I mean if you see the seven week average of Ethereum, like I show you, maybe two days down, but over the week, no. Okay, so how ZK roll up affect fee? Well, zero knowledge roll up. This will allow to offload some transaction on layer two. So this will reduce the transaction fee. Of course. Someone said, oh, it's funny how I say it's like THX, like the logo from the first six star movies.
00:26:10.666 - 00:26:51.610, Speaker A: Okay, I guess this is a private joke between me and THX. Someone say gold gym, hello, how to fork Uniswap. Well, I mean, you're in good luck because this is the last video I published last week. So check out my video of last week and I show exactly how to fork Uniswap. All right. No, let me see. Sushi swap is just innovation in research on research in tokenomics.
00:26:51.610 - 00:27:23.986, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean they didn't invented the yield farming. Uniswap vitriol is going to be game changing. Hold all those units. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I trust Uniswap long term uniswap v three layer two side chain. Yeah, that's a prediction. I've made a couple of weeks ago that we'll see more and more d five project moving to layer two because, yeah, I mean, they understand that this is really an obstacle to more liquidity.
00:27:23.986 - 00:27:59.790, Speaker A: So that's going to be interesting to see all this layer two integration. One thing that will be a little bit annoying is that we're going to lose composability. So if you want to do complex operation where you combine protocol, ABC, et cetera, if we move a lot of this liquidity on layer two, that won't be possible anymore, at least temporarily. All right, let's see the other question. Ena who say I've claimed my 400 unitoken. Yeah, great. J rude who say I claim 800 double woohoo.
00:27:59.790 - 00:28:45.220, Speaker A: Ena who say got almost six eth. Wow, this is amazing. I think one inch will also enter the token fight. Yes, but one inch is an exchange aggregator, so I don't really think they have the same kind of challenge for liquidity. All right, will DydX one platform will issue token like uniswap? I mean, at this stage this is pretty sure that most DeFi project will do some yield farming, liquidity mining. I mean they saw that it works and the liquidity walls start to be more and more intense. So I don't see why they wouldn't do it for sure.
00:28:45.220 - 00:29:19.550, Speaker A: We need Ethereum 2.0 ASAP. Yeah, but unfortunately before it's finally released, it's still probably going to be one, two years because they don't want to rush things. Like if they make a big mistake and there is a bug on the main net in the future, that's the whole credibility of the Ethereum project that will be affected. So they prefer to be late. Sorry. I mean, they prefer to be late but safe than to rush things and lose credibility.
00:29:19.550 - 00:30:06.434, Speaker A: All right, let's keep scrolling down. See the other question, proof of work is slow and expensive. Yeah, this is going to be proof of stake in ether 2.0. All right, sushi swap repo doesn't have updated source. Yeah, it's possible I haven't check out their repo. Not all projects publish their smart contract as open source, but if they haven't published the source of their smart contract, you can use tools that are called disassembler to go from the upcode on the blockchain to the solidity code. But I haven't used these tools.
00:30:06.434 - 00:30:47.494, Speaker A: You can check out some security tools allow you to do this. So cryptoconome asks, hey, could you do a video how to do swaps using Uniswap on Ethereum. Yeah, it's already done. You can check out one of my video on Uniswap. I think that was a couple of weeks ago. On uniswap V two, I explained everything, especially in solidity, how it works. Senobyte asks, is it profitable to grab a chain link node? I haven't tried, but I think you can just stake some coin.
00:30:47.494 - 00:31:34.934, Speaker A: I'm not sure you have to run a validator yourself. I think you can stake some coin to a validator, but I need to look more in detail. If anybody know anything about Chainlink staking, let us know. Fox Raymond, where is more money for Dev in trading or building? I mean, you can do both really. If you can build something that can be useful for traders, that can be very interesting. And it's actually what we do in my course on profitable flash loan, we build a boat that do arbitrage on the blockchain. So what you could do is if, you know, you can take the code of the course and turn it into a service that you monetize, for example.
00:31:34.934 - 00:32:29.254, Speaker A: But you can also use your development skills to do your own trading. So you can do your own trading, you can build a service, or you can build something for someone else. So what's Vincent is asking, what's your forecast for the future of crypto as Covid is like an accelerator of digital transformation? Yeah, this is a good question. Let me see. Okay, so first of all, it's going to put a huge pressure on the job market. So I think people are going to start to search for other ways to make money. And of course, crypto is one of them, so they're going to invest in crypto.
00:32:29.254 - 00:32:59.700, Speaker A: That's really the first step. But second step would be to be a blockchain developer. So, yeah, that's the link I would see between Covid and blockchain. You will put more people in difficult situation and they will see blockchain as an opportunity. Also, we might have a high inflation in one to two years with all the money that was printed. So it will drive even more people to crypto. Yeah, so that was a pretty long answer.
00:32:59.700 - 00:33:29.226, Speaker A: Okay. KMC is asking what will happen to device space if tether collapses. That's not good. I'm not sure. What's the market cap of tether? Is it the biggest stable coin? I believe so, yeah, that would be really bad. But this is not the only stable coin that will definitely not kill the defi space. And I know there was a lot of controversy over Tether but really in the end it never really collapsed.
00:33:29.226 - 00:34:02.390, Speaker A: So I think it's just too much conspiracy here. Jane Nelson asking how do you feel about the future of Solana if you were starting a new d five project? I haven't followed Solana. Is it a layer two solution? Yeah, I don't know that one. Naraj asking if you're building a Dex now and plan to release by generic so would you recommend eth 20 over Ethereum 1.0? It's too soon, it's too soon. Don't worry about this. Just develop over Ethereum 1.0.
00:34:02.390 - 00:34:35.700, Speaker A: Ethereum 2.0 in terms of for the blockchain developers, you will be concerned about this in one or two years when it will be released in full. So right now, just focus on Ethereum 1.0. And on top of it, one of the goal of Ethereum 2.0 is to be backward compatible with Ethereum 1.0. So most of the smart contract you build for Ethereum now, they should also work in the future. So don't worry about this, just use the tools you have now and you should be fine.
00:34:35.700 - 00:35:18.094, Speaker A: Thomas Franklin is asking, when is your advanced solidity course dropping? Yeah, so it's a really good question. Okay, so I have some bad and good news. So the bad news is that I haven't made really too much progress there because I started to do something and I wasn't happy of what I've done. I wasn't inspired really. So I took a step back and I felt like it's going to take me more time to build this course because I really want to build something great. However, in comparison, there is another course I wanted to do, which is a course for defied programming. And for this course everything is already well defined in my mind.
00:35:18.094 - 00:35:55.606, Speaker A: I know exactly what I want to do. So I'm still considering it. But I might switch the priority and decide to release the course on defy programming first and do advanced UC programming after. I'm going to do a poll to see what's the priority, what people want first. But yeah, so that's the situation on the course. Cryptogunome is saying using Python, I recommend to use node JS and JavaScript. Really, it's really the most compatible Python.
00:35:55.606 - 00:36:18.834, Speaker A: You can only use it on the back end, you can use it on the front end. So you have to do context switching all the time. So also you have decent support for blockchain and Python, but you have even better support for JavaScript and node JS. Really make it easy for yourself. Use JavaScript. That's the easiest I'll say. Great work done here.
00:36:18.834 - 00:36:45.510, Speaker A: I will enroll your flashlone code very soon. Great Ena, looking forward to have you cryptogram swaps on Ethereum using Python. No, use JavaScript. Someone is asking if the blocks ZK roll up and Ethereum 2.0. So ZK roll up is a scaling solution for layer two and Ethereum 2.0. It's a scaling solution for layer one. So these are complementary.
00:36:45.510 - 00:37:12.014, Speaker A: But what's going to happen is all this layer two solution, they will fill the gap until we have Ethereum 2.0. So first of all, it's going to be only layer two. That will save Ethereum for a while. And after there will be Ethereum 2.0. So we'll have massive scaling on the blockchain. And if we still need more scaling then we'll have the layer two. So there will be like two scaling solutions combined.
00:37:12.014 - 00:37:53.274, Speaker A: So in the end ethereum will be massively scalable. Will the d five project be popular on Polkadot? Polkadot is just an intermediary. So I don't really see defi project being on polkadot. I just see Polkadot being an intermediary to go between blockchain. Can you do some video on Zkat roll up dap? I could have a look. I'm not sure we have any framework that is ready yet, so I'm not sure if it's only something ready for researcher or if it's actually ready to be used in production. Fox saying tether won't collapse as long as people believe this is worth one dollars.
00:37:53.274 - 00:38:42.878, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. I think we're going to be fine for tether, but just diversify into die. The only thing I didn't like about centralized stable coin like tether is I think this happened on USDC a couple of weeks ago. They froze an address because that was related to some case of corruption or terrorism or something like this. So of course we always think, oh, I'm not a terrorist, I'm not a corrupted person, blah blah, I will never have this problem. But still, I don't really like that using crypto and still have the disadvantages of centralized coin. If you know how to write profitable flash loan, what are you making? Setting training? Just execute your profitable flash loan.
00:38:42.878 - 00:39:17.290, Speaker A: No. Okay, so I'm going to be very straight here. I think this is a very cynical way to see it. So I don't know what I'm doing here on this channel is what I really enjoy doing is teaching people how to thrive on the blockchain, how to become a blockchain developer, how to build your defi project, et cetera, is what I like. So doing a profitable flash loan, it takes time, right? It really requires you to make some adjustment, to try different things, et cetera. And this is not my job. I'm not an investment fund.
00:39:17.290 - 00:39:32.690, Speaker A: I'm a teacher. I teach. So I teach you how to build a flash loan. But you probably need to make some adjustment. This is not like some copy and paste thing where I'm not selling a trading boat. This is different. I teach you the process of building this.
00:39:32.690 - 00:40:02.746, Speaker A: So if you're someone you just want to make some quick money and you're not interested at all in building, don't take this course. This is not for you. This is a course for people who are really interested in the process, who are willing to put some effort, et cetera. We're not here on this channel. I'm not the kind of guy who will encourage you to make you think you can make a lot of money easily by doing nothing. No, you have to make some effort. You have to earn it.
00:40:02.746 - 00:40:27.460, Speaker A: That's for sure. Okay, so let's see the other question. Does the flashlight how to find the arbitrage opportunities? So this is a script. So this is not an organic process where you have to look yourself. This is a script that all the time. Check out the price differences between different exchanges. Yeah.
00:40:27.460 - 00:40:54.310, Speaker A: So uni crypto, massively undervalued. Yeah, probably it's going to go much higher. All right, guys, well, I think we exhausted all the question. Any more coming? No. All right, guys, well, I guess this is pretty much it. So thanks, everybody, for coming here on the show, and I'll see you later this week for other videos on my channel. Peace.
00:40:54.310 - 00:40:56.450, Speaker A: Bye.
