00:00:07.370 - 00:00:34.790, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly recap of the blockchain news. I'm Julian, your host ennotoblogs. I teach blockchain development. Hi everybody. In the chat we have Chris Jim Colon, blogs Vasham Jim hi everybody. So as usual, if you are new here and you want to know how you can become a professional blockchain developer, check out this free training.
00:00:34.790 - 00:01:24.002, Speaker A: I put the link in the chat at the top and also second link I wanted to share with you tonight. If you are interested in participating in the hackathon of the blocks, register to this mailing list. So the current hackathon is on NFT. We are building an NFT collection on developers and this Friday we'll have an office hour call Friday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. So if you want to receive a link to the zoom call, register at this link. And first, we're going to start with our sponsor for this live stream, Phantom.
00:01:24.002 - 00:02:07.330, Speaker A: So Phantom is a crypto wallet for Solana, and this is a wallet with a beautiful UI. It's really beautiful. Compared to metamask, it's way more beautiful. And so of course it can do the basic functions, sending and receiving your crypto, but it also has some extra features. So it can also collect your nfTs, it can also swap token. So this is similar to Metamask. You can buy and sell your token in the wallet and they are going to add a lot of defi feature and on their roadmap they are also going to go multi chain.
00:02:07.330 - 00:02:49.090, Speaker A: So with one wallet you'll be able to access all the blockchain, including their Defi protocol. So give it a try because the UI is really know. And in the wallet the UI is one of the most important. All right, so let me put the link to Phantom in the chat. Yeah, you can extend the chrome extension. They are on every browser, Google Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, et cetera. Okay, so we're going to continue with the price of ether.
00:02:49.090 - 00:03:38.770, Speaker A: So this week we reached a new all time high, more than 4300. That's pretty awesome. We briefly went back under 4000, but now we are back above 4000. So super good results. So of course, Ethereum is following the lead of bitcoin, which also reached a new all time high of $67,000. And we had news that there was more than $2 billion of Ethereum that was burned thanks to EIP 1559. So of course, since this update has been introduced, there's been also a big factor in the recent increase of Ethereum.
00:03:38.770 - 00:04:26.398, Speaker A: Then I wanted to show you this new website, gasprice IO. So it gives you the current gas price, but to visit a really nice UI and it has been updated for EIP 1559. So if you scroll down here, you will see the detail of the recent gas price including the base fee and the other component of the fee. Because now with EIP 1559 we have different component in the fee. And what's really cool also is that you can see the price in us dollar for a set of couple actions. So simple ether transfer of here. It's interesting.
00:04:26.398 - 00:04:57.178, Speaker A: I don't know why transferring die is cheaper than USDC because this is supposed to be almost the same code. Interesting. Also swapping assets on uniswap, et cetera. So very, very useful. If they want to make their tool even more useful, they can make it multi chain. So this will be really awesome. All right, so next there is this interesting piece of research called spring roll up.
00:04:57.178 - 00:05:56.654, Speaker A: So this is basically a new kind of zero roll up that would allow a sender to do an unlimited number of transfer with the same amount of data on chain. So this is pretty badass because that means that you can scale Ethereum like crazy. So it's really amazing. All the innovation that is going on with Ethereum, with the scaling at time, it feels like we've maxed out Ethereum. We are stuck because we've already done all the possible optimization, but there are always some researchers that find something really cool. All right, so next there is this new product of Gitcoin grant. So this is to allow open source project to create some grant to collect the contribution in a decentralized way.
00:05:56.654 - 00:06:39.706, Speaker A: So if you have a project on GitHub and you want to receive some contribution, then you can use this tool. It's pretty cool. Then there is this new project, Cismo, super cool. So this is to aggregate reputation on a public profile, but without giving away all your account. And it make use of zero knowledge attestation. So this is really the bleeding edge of innovation. So how would it work and what are the different use cases? So one of the use case would be for token gated community.
00:06:39.706 - 00:07:36.080, Speaker A: So you know you have a couple of Dao where to get inside you need to have a token. So with Cismo, basically you can mint a zero knowledge badge that says for example that you are the owner of a crypto punk. But it's not going to reveal which crypto punk and which Ethereum address possess this crypto punk. So if you do other transaction with your crypto punk, that this transaction can remain more discrete, a little bit less public. Then another use case would be for aggregating a DeFi score. So, for example, you could have a system where we aggregate a score based on your different interaction in deFi, but without revealing exactly what you've done in Defi. So, for example, we could have a system of credit score like this.
00:07:36.080 - 00:08:39.166, Speaker A: Another use case would be for governance. So you could have a badge, an NFT badge that proves that you are the owner of a certain number of governance tokens, so that you can vote in some Dao, for example, but you don't have to reveal exactly which address owns all of this. Then we have some updates from East Global. So currently there is a hackathon in Lisbon. And so this is the list of all the finalists. So if you're a developer and you want some inspiration for what to build, either to learn or because you want to launch your own blockchain project, it's always super interesting to check out what they're doing at east online because the project are always so innovative. Then we're going to continue with the market cap in DFI.
00:08:39.166 - 00:09:03.366, Speaker A: And so huge news. We finally crossed this threshold of $100 billion. So we've been waiting for this a long time, but finally we are there. So just even one year ago, I think we were at something like $20 billion. Yes. So we multiply the market cap by five in one year. So it's pretty badass.
00:09:03.366 - 00:09:56.838, Speaker A: And by the way, if you want to take a bet on the market cap of DeFi, but you don't want to bet on any individual token, you can invest in an index which is called a GPI Defi Pulse index. This is quite useful. All right, so next let's see the winner and the loser for the DFI token. So, ample force plus 80% GMX plus 70 convex finance plus 70 torsion rune of torch and 65% frac share plus 60% curve plus 50%. And for the winner, we don't have a lot keep network keeper network rari governance well, recently Rari did really well. So I think it's fine if one week they rest. McDex, this is a deck.
00:09:56.838 - 00:10:38.546, Speaker A: So -50% DyDx -40% Lido Dio minus eleven. All right, so now let's continue with news of specific defi project. So now we have news from synthetics. So the exchange of synthetics Quinta is going to launch a competition of futures trading. So if you are into trading and you want to make some money, check it out. Then there is this DAO that is managing a real property on a blockchain. So the.
00:10:38.546 - 00:11:39.610, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's, I mean it's, you know, every, every time, every week we, we hear something more crazy on, on DaO. Like I love what's happening on Dao and I really think this is going to be the next bubble. Then we have some news for hacks. The plasma bridge of Polygon just fixed a vulnerability had and it paid a bounty of $2 million and there was more than $850,000,000 at risk. Then there is an update on the attack on index finance. I think that was one of the biggest DFI hack ever. And so the attacker was identified and the attacker was offered to keep 10% of the hack if he gives back the phone.
00:11:39.610 - 00:12:36.970, Speaker A: But he did not give back the phone after the deadline. So his detail are going to be sent to law enforcement. But I really wonder what's going to happen in this case because I really wonder what kind of court of justice can decide in this case. Because even though ethically it's bad if a hacker just used the code of a smart contract, I don't know if this can be qualified legally as something criminal. So it'd be really interesting to see the first judgment that happened on this. There is this story. So someone who committed his private key to git and one of the NFTs he owned dependent on his private key, but he was able to rescue his NFT thanks to flashbot.
00:12:36.970 - 00:13:22.606, Speaker A: So interesting story. Then some hack coming from Coin market cap. So there is more than 3 million email that were coming from coin market cap that are traded on the black market. So be careful there. Then we're going to continue with fundraising. So we're going to start with Animoka brands which just raised $65 million. So Animoca Brands is an investment fund that invested in a couple of big blockchain gaming project.
00:13:22.606 - 00:14:07.690, Speaker A: So they are based in Hong Kong. They have a total valuation of 2 billion and they invested in many super famous blockchain project like the sandbox. So they're all about blockchain gaming, the Metaverse, et cetera. And they are doing super well during this bull run. Then there was a company raised $100 million. So this is an NFT company that partner with the baseball league. And so this is called Candy Digital.
00:14:07.690 - 00:14:43.830, Speaker A: And basically they are going to do the NFT for the baseball league. So it's really cool to see all the major sport association getting really deep into NFT. Then a decentralized exchange called ZK Link just raised $8.5 million. And so this is an exchange that using zero knowledge roll up. So really zero knowledge roll up. This is the bleeding edge of scaling solution.
00:14:43.830 - 00:15:37.430, Speaker A: And so this is currently available in Testnet and they offer cross chain token swap facility across Ethereum, Binance, Marchan, Polygon and the Huobi Eco chain. And it's going to add support for more blockchain and also do some very unique stuff like cross chain farming and staking facility. Then Vala Ventures. Oh, sorry, no, Valenture. This is the investor, the company that raised money, this is called Zanpool, raised $27 million. So this is a Hong Kong company that is into payment infrastructure and they provide off ramp services. So this is to onboard new investors to the world of crypto.
00:15:37.430 - 00:16:23.742, Speaker A: Then the big money raise of the week was from the crypto exchange, FTX, that raised $420 million. So that's one of the biggest raise ever in crypto. Now they have a total valuation of 25 billion. And so recently FTX has a lot of traction. They are basically a sort of smaller binance. They are doing really well at the moment. Then we another money raised.
00:16:23.742 - 00:17:13.430, Speaker A: So from a company called Mojito that raised $20 million. So basically they are developing an NFT commerce suite. So they are basically developing some technology for NFT and their technology powered the metaverse marketplace of. So stay by, I think, I don't pronounce it well, this thing. So we saw this name pop up recently in NFT in a lot of big deals. This is an auction house. All right, so then copper, a crypto company in the UK is going to raise $500 million.
00:17:13.430 - 00:18:09.894, Speaker A: So they are custodian for crypto, which means that they keep the crypto mostly for institutionals, 500 million. This will finally put them in the top three of the biggest money raise ever in crypto. Then I'm going to continue with NFT. And so there was this cool thread on Twitter that explained a little bit how to make money in NFT. But from a high level perspective that basically explain that basically with NFT you can make a lot of money, but at the same time it changed the culture. And so if you can find an NFT that you think can have an impact on the culture, these are the ones that going to make a lot of money. So you can read more on the thread.
00:18:09.894 - 00:18:47.426, Speaker A: But that was pretty interesting. Then there is this tool, NFT tool, where basically you can check the current floor price of the NFT you sold. So this is to show you if you lost money or not. So very smart little tool. Then there is an artist that sold for $7 million of NFT on Ethereum, even though the NFT have not been minted yet. So this is Tyler Hobbs. So previously he has been successful in NFTs.
00:18:47.426 - 00:19:26.142, Speaker A: So it's pretty cool for him. They can be so successful even before he create the NFT. Then there is a baseball legend that is going to launch his own NFT collection. So Willis May. So maybe some of our american friends are knowledgeable with him. So I'm french and in Europe we don't really follow much baseball, but it's cool to see all the superstar in sport being so much into NFT. Then Reddit is going to build their own NFT marketplace.
00:19:26.142 - 00:20:32.594, Speaker A: So Reddit, they already launch community point that are supported by Ethereum. And so they keep going into blockchain. So it's super cool because Reddit, they already have their user base. And out of all the social media, Reddit is probably the one which is the closest to the ethos of blockchain. Then some news from Coinbase that signed some big sponsorship with the NBA and the coinbase which is making a big push to get into NFT. Then we're going to continue with news on enterprise, blockchain and regulation. So the Associated Press is going to partner with Chainlink to provide economic, sports and election data by using Chainlink.
00:20:32.594 - 00:21:15.610, Speaker A: So it's going to be really cool because once they do this, then it's going to open up a lot of possibilities for blockchain app. Then we have some news from Facebook. So Facebook is releasing a new payment system that allow people to send payment at absolutely no fee. This is called Novi. And so the new system, Novi, is going to be powered by Coinbase custody. And Elizabeth Warren has something to say about this. So she asked Facebook to stop their new service, Novi.
00:21:15.610 - 00:22:07.794, Speaker A: She's totally against it, apparently. Then some news from Australia. So the Senate committee of Australia has issued some recommendation about the regulation for Daos and capital gain tax event and CDBC. So all the regulators around the world this year, they are doing something about crypto. Then some news from the creditor of Mongox, the exchange that was hacked in 2013 in Japan. So they are going to receive $9 billion in bitcoin. And so the trial for Mongox lasts so long, I think the trial started in 2014.
00:22:07.794 - 00:23:01.670, Speaker A: So finally, people who lost money during Mongox will be compensated. Next, we have some news from Robin Hood that is launching a crypto wallet and they have a waitlist of well over a million people. So personally Robinhood would probably be the last company I use to buy some crypto. Then we have some news from finance. So there was a flash crash in bitcoin this week that went down to $8,200. And so they blamed this flash crash because of a bug in a client trading algorithm. Then some news from Peter Thiel, one of the co founder of PayPal.
00:23:01.670 - 00:23:58.730, Speaker A: So Peter Thiel want to buy small bitcoin and Peter Thiel, which is usually very pro crypto. All right, then I have some news from Binance Spotchen, which is going to adopt a fee burning mechanism like in EIP 1559. So the burn will be initially set at 10% of transaction fees. Then some news from the flow blockchain. So that's a blockchain for NFT that is created by dapper Labs, the creator of cryptokitties. And so now the control of flow has been decentralized. So now flow is controlled by the community before it was controlled by dapperlabs.
00:23:58.730 - 00:24:42.854, Speaker A: And finally, I wanted to share with you this quick tool I find on GitHub. So this is a sniping boat to snipe token on any exchange that use a uniswap v two. So basically this allow you to buy new token as soon as they are listed. And of course, the idea behind this is that usually token moon during the first few hours. However, be really careful because with this tool you have no control over what is bought. Exactly. So you can buy some really bullshit coin.
00:24:42.854 - 00:25:14.642, Speaker A: So careful with this. All right, so now let's see the questions. So, quick reminder, if you are new here and you want to learn how you can become a blockchain developer, check out my free training here. And if you want to participate in the hackathon of it, the blogs where we earn some prize and we build blockchain together, register to this newsletter. And currently we are doing a hackathon on NFT. If you want to know more about it, register to this newsletter. You'll get all the info.
00:25:14.642 - 00:25:29.482, Speaker A: All right, so let me see what we have in the chat crypto hall of Fame. Great show. Thank you. Dendan. Hi, God andeto crypto jakes. Hello, Julian. I sign up to your training program.
00:25:29.482 - 00:25:45.310, Speaker A: I hope to get the best of it. I bet you will. Loeico Divin Providence Julian, what are your thought on ample force? 86,000 API on Ave. Wow. Crazy. I didn't see that. Usually when you see crazy API like this, it doesn't last a long time.
00:25:45.310 - 00:26:00.030, Speaker A: It's just for a couple of days. Dixon. Hey, Julian, when is ten k? I don't know. Maybe next year. Me personally, I will keep my eth for many years, so I'm patient. Jed. George.
00:26:00.030 - 00:26:14.502, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Yash, Vera. Hi, Julian. I missed all the previous office hours for the third hackathon. Is there a recording? No. Oh, you know what? Several people asked me this. Okay, so I think from now on we will record this course.
00:26:14.502 - 00:26:35.774, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks for asking, Yasha. Very good remark, Alan. I need to start learning blockchain. Where can I begin? Okay, so you follow my free training. That's what I mentioned just before. You'll see the link, which is a pin at the top of the chat. Gilux, Vogel, what's the best chain to release the dap in? There are so many chain now.
00:26:35.774 - 00:26:55.510, Speaker A: I skip Suana because of the different language for now. Learn a lot from Julian. Training. There isn't any better. Thanks, man. Yeah, I mean, this is a very difficult question. It really depends.
00:26:55.510 - 00:27:44.478, Speaker A: If you are worried about transaction fees, you can launch on one of the l two of Ethereum, like Polygon or arbitrum. I think that would be a safe choice. Yeah, I think if I were to launch a new project now, I would probably launch directly on the l two then. God known. Adding to the question above, what's the best chance to deploy an NFT collection too? So for NFT collection, if Ethereum is the blockchain, which makes nft the most valuable. Whenever you see some crazy sale for NFT, this is for an NFT on Ethereum. Gilux Vogel.
00:27:44.478 - 00:28:03.340, Speaker A: I would say Solana for night. Seems a lot of NFT stuff goes. Yeah, Solana, a lot of NFT stuff. All right, so, Asubi, anything about Nigeria releasing their CBDC? No, I didn't know this news. Wow. Super cool. Very interesting.
00:28:03.340 - 00:28:27.730, Speaker A: Jlux. We would have deployed on Solana if we didn't have to rewrite all the code for. Yeah, yeah. The fact that it's in rust, I think this is a big barrier to adoption then. Done. I want to go pro. But how? Check out the link I put at the top of the chat.
00:28:27.730 - 00:28:51.190, Speaker A: Idoblock.com slash bootcamp Dixon Fadol Avil Kenso, thank you for making the flash loan. Course. Welcome. Akshay. Can you recommend some Twitter account for crypto news? Actually, I'm not super active on crypto Twitter, so I'm not the best person to ask. Jama beans.
00:28:51.190 - 00:29:31.470, Speaker A: Why is the owner address always seemed to be the first memory slot in contract? It's because the memory slots are defined based on the order of the variable you declare so if in general, people declare the owner addresses as the first variable. So that's why it's the first memory slot. Loiko, thanks a lot for this live format. All right, guys. All right, well, I think this is the end of the news for today, so thanks, everybody, for following, and I will see you soon on etherblocks. Have a great week, everybody. Bye.
