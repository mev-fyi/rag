00:00:08.970 - 00:00:35.030, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome everybody for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi. I'm Julian, your host and on the blocks I teach blockchain development. Hi everybody. In the chat we have Javier Pizza, Bella, Dan Ganesh, Jek Joe Biden Ganesh. Hi guys. So, so, so first of all a couple of announcement.
00:00:35.030 - 00:01:20.750, Speaker A: So tomorrow at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight we're going to have a new live training on Ethereum 2.0 staking. So if you want to book your seat, I'm going to put the link in the description and this is going to be done by Alexon who already did a live training for us a couple of months ago. And also tomorrow this is the deadline if you want to take advantage of the launch price for the subscription of the blocks. So I've reintroduced the subscription of IDWblox one week ago. So with this you pay monthly and you have access to absolutely all the courses.
00:01:20.750 - 00:01:54.590, Speaker A: For example, if you want to follow all of my live training with a subscription, you have access to all of them. And since I've just relaunched this, there are special launch price. And so after tomorrow midnight, the price is going to increase. So you still have one day to get your hand on a subscription. So I put the link as well in the chat next announcement. So we are going to talk about idablocks project. So if you never heard of Idoblocks project.
00:01:54.590 - 00:02:41.200, Speaker A: So basically this is a series of hackathon where we build project on top of the ETB token. So the ETB token is the community token of eat the blocks. It was airdrop a couple of months ago. And so we did our first hackathon and in this first hackathon the topic was to build a voting app so that in the future we can use our governance token for all sort of vote. And so a few people participated to this last week. One week ago, sorry, we did a demonstration that was demo day. And so people, the different participants show their demo and people voted after this.
00:02:41.200 - 00:03:13.842, Speaker A: And so here is the result of the poll. So we had three participants, we had Mark, Samit and Jan. So I messed up because after I created the poll I basically added this link here for their GitHub. So Google form like show two different results but basically you have to put them together. For example, Yan here. So this is the green and the green and the orange. So he is the winner with almost 60% of the vote.
00:03:13.842 - 00:03:44.594, Speaker A: And the two other participants, Summit and mark, they have about 20% each. So congratulations to all of them, and thanks for your participation. That was great. And of course, special congratulations to Jan for winning this hackathon. So we will use the app of Jan. So this is the app here. And yeah, so as you can see, this is really beautiful.
00:03:44.594 - 00:04:29.970, Speaker A: It reuses the styling of it, the blocks. And so if you want to check the demo, you can check the live stream of one week ago I showed the demo, so I'm going to deploy this and give it a URL with it, the blocks inside. I'm going to send an email to everybody. And so for the next hackathon of eat the blocks, we will use this app. And also Yan also has won a cash prize of $1,000. So congratulations to him, but also congratulations to the other because everybody worked hard on this project. And in any case, if you lost or if you want to participate in the next project, this is absolutely no problem.
00:04:29.970 - 00:05:09.840, Speaker A: And actually no further than this Friday, we're going to do the next live stream on ETB project. We're going to launch ETB project two. So in the meantime, if you have any idea on what kind of project we can build for this second hackathon, you can send me an email. Julian@etbixblocks.com some people ask me in the chat, where is the link? Okay, so I put two link in the chat, one link to the live training of tomorrow, and one link to the all access subscription. So you can scroll up. You will see the link.
00:05:09.840 - 00:05:42.950, Speaker A: All right, so next we're going to continue with the price of Ethereum. And it was a wonderful week. Great week. We have a super big increase here, and we are back in a territory above $3,000. And what's great is that you can see that this increase is on a high volume, which means the increase is more significant. So I hope now we are strongly back in a bullish territory. That's great.
00:05:42.950 - 00:06:19.202, Speaker A: Actually, I wasn't so optimistic. I thought maybe we'll have to wait another six months, but we're already back in bullish territory. So that's amazing in terms of the gas price. So we can see that the gas price on the blockchain start to go up again. Usually this is quite correlated with the price of ether. And of course, the reason of this big price increase is because there was the London hard fork the past week. And so for the London hard fork, the big change in the network was EIP 1559.
00:06:19.202 - 00:07:10.906, Speaker A: And with this change, it totally changed the way that we calculate gas. And so now gas is calculated in a different way, which is much more user friendly, where the user doesn't need to estimate the correct gas price. The wallet will be able to estimate this. So there is a big improvement from the user experience and also a big fundamental change in the economics of Ethereum, because now ether became a deflationary asset. And here we can see that Ethereum burned for $12 million of ease in the first 24 hours since EIP 1559. So there are a lot of people who are confused by this. EIP 1559 doesn't mean that we're going to burn token on every block.
00:07:10.906 - 00:07:53.918, Speaker A: Actually we can either burn token or burn ether or create ether depending on various parameter. But it has been estimated that probably we will burn more token that will create. So that means there we're going to be less and less ether in circulation, which will be very bullish for the price of ether. So we had a couple of tools that appear to help us to visualize this. So here you have this dashboard, etherchain.org, and so you can see more detail about how much ether was burned. And another interesting dashboard is this simulator.
00:07:53.918 - 00:08:42.926, Speaker A: So it anticipates where the supply of ether is going to go, depending on the market parameter. So this can be interesting to check out as well. Next, we also have some news on the tooling side for users. So metamask has been updated for EIP 1559. So I'll be really curious to send transaction in the next few days, see if we pay more or less compared to before. Next we also have this website to estimate the gas after the update of EIP 1559. Next we have some news on Arbitrum.
00:08:42.926 - 00:09:32.634, Speaker A: So arbitram, this is one of the most promising l two scaling solution for Ethereum. So this is going to be used to, this is basically like a secondary ethereum network that's going to attach to the main one and that's going to be used for scalability. And so they are not the only one to do this. There is Polygon, there are a couple of project, but Arbitram is one of the most promising one and they are launching their main net in a few weeks. And so it's going to give one more l two block chance to play with and probably we're going to see some d five project that start to launch there. So all of this l two scaling solution of course, is going to give back to Ethereum its momentum. So yeah, right now during this summer, we have a lot of things going on for Ethereum.
00:09:32.634 - 00:10:05.530, Speaker A: We have 1559, we have all this l two scaling solution coming online. So that's why currently this is super bullish for ether. Okay, so we are going to continue with the situation on. Oops, I think I forgot a tab here. So the tab for the defi market cap. Well, actually, the market cap for Defi went up the past few weeks. This is largely due to the increase of ether.
00:10:05.530 - 00:10:33.926, Speaker A: And here we have the top defi token. So the top number one is the token true Phi. So that's because they raised $12.5 million from a 16 z. So 233%. Usually for the top defi token, this is between 50% to 100%. But 233, that's really huge.
00:10:33.926 - 00:11:10.930, Speaker A: Then we have badger Dao plus 166%. And what else? We have alpaca finance, 55%. And globally we have a lot of green this week. And if you check out the loser, not many loser, you see, like the worst loser was 7.4%. So the mp stable coin, which is not very stable. But overall, you see, we only have a handful of negative tokens. So this week it was really difficult to not make money in defi.
00:11:10.930 - 00:12:06.174, Speaker A: Okay, so next we're going to continue with news for specific DeFi project. And we have some news from Gelato. So Gelato network is a network of both for DeFI, and they released a user interface where you can basically help you to pay down your debt on Ave if you are close to liquidation. So basically, a feature is similar to D five saver. And then we have some news from Ripple back from the dead. So Ripple, which was one of the darling of 2017, and also earlier this year, there was a ripple moment. They confirmed that they are going to launch a new feature called Federated side chain.
00:12:06.174 - 00:12:48.750, Speaker A: And on this sidechain, they want to be able to add DFI, NFT, et cetera. Okay, so I am really not bullish at all for Ripple, because Ripple, that was supposed to be this enterprise blockchain in 2017, and it ended up being a totally dead chain. And all the enterprise partner, in the end, nobody came, nobody really cared about Ripple. And in the end, banks, now they are building their own blockchain outside of ripple. So it just seems too little, too late. So, yeah, I'm not expecting anything crazy from Ripple. They just try to catch the bandwagon, but, yeah, just too late.
00:12:48.750 - 00:13:39.710, Speaker A: Then some news from Avi. So, Ave, which is the top lending protocol on Ethereum, they are exploring Solana and avalanche layer two expansion. So, yeah, Ave, they're already on a couple of l two on Ethereum. And so they're looking to expand to a more mo blockchain. Then we have some news from chain link, which has just released a new standard called cross chain interoperability protocol. So basically this is a standard to exchange data between blockchain. And because they are the leader in Oracle, they have a good chance to make this standard, to impose this standard in the industry.
00:13:39.710 - 00:14:16.800, Speaker A: Okay, so we have some interesting statistics about Ethereum addresses for DFI. So these addresses increased by 65% for the last quarter. So you know that we had an amazing season for DFI that peaked roughly may 13 up to when Elon Musk did his bad tweet. And now we're back. But yeah, this is a very important metrics. Basically, what is the user gross for DeFi? And it's going up. So very important.
00:14:16.800 - 00:15:03.750, Speaker A: Then we are going to talk investment. So first here there is a big money raised by Mesari, which raised $21 million. If you're not familiar with Mesari, this is a top provider of data for blockchain. They are more on the enterprise side. So that's why if you're not in the enterprise blockchain segment or if you're not really involved with trading, you might not have heard of them, but they are really a heavyweight in the space. So they just raised a lot of money. Currently, every project that does a blockchain API raise a lot of money, then nagic network.
00:15:03.750 - 00:15:32.902, Speaker A: So this is an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data. So basically another blockchain API. So it can also be seen as a sort of alternative to the graph. So they raised $8.8 million. And then we have some news from onrep invest. So they've just raised $6 million.
00:15:32.902 - 00:16:12.690, Speaker A: So this is a project that allow financial advisors to easily invest in DFI and in blockchain. And that's very important because we have to target the gatekeeper and financial advisors, they control. Together they control trillions of dollars. So now with this product, they will be able to suggest to their client some allocation to crypto. So this means more money is going to flow to crypto. Then we have some news from a project called Crystal that just raised $6.6 million in seed funding.
00:16:12.690 - 00:16:52.862, Speaker A: For a seed funding. It's pretty impressive. Crystal is basically a DeFi dashboard that allow you to manage your different DeFi protocol from a single dashboard. So a little bit like Insta DaP, a DeFi saver, et cetera. And so they currently support Ethereum, Binance, smart chain, Polygon Network, and they plan to integrate more protocol. So yeah, I mean, this kind of project, maybe it doesn't look like it because this is, quote unquote, just a front end. But now, because we have so many blockchain and so many l, two, et cetera, there is really an infinite number of protocol to support.
00:16:52.862 - 00:17:37.840, Speaker A: So it's really a lot of work. And this kind of project can become really valuable because in the end, if they control the distribution for different DeFi protocol, they are basically the interface between this protocol and the end users. And so it's possible that in the future some DeFi protocol are going to pay to be included in some of this interface. It's totally possible. Then we have some news from trust token. So trust token, which is the operator of a DeFi protocol called True Phi and a stablecoin TUSD, and they just raised $12.5 million.
00:17:37.840 - 00:18:23.686, Speaker A: Then we have some news from Sense Finance. We just raised $5.2 million. So this is an advanced DeFi protocol that allow you to decompose any asset that pays some interest, and you can decompose this into a principal and into a yield component and you basically repackage them. So this is quite advanced. And it kind of make me think of the kind of financial product that basically triggered the financial crisis in 2008, CDO, et cetera. So it's useful not for the average investor, but this is useful for really advanced investors.
00:18:23.686 - 00:19:13.798, Speaker A: Or maybe if big banks in the future come to DeFi, they will be the typical users of that kind of project. So if we want to bring the big guy big money to DeFi, we need that kind of protocol. But before this is ready, I can tell you they're going to be a lot of hack because these protocols are super complicated. So it's really next level stuff. So it's good that we're working on this, but I can tell you that you can expect a lot of hack in that kind of advanced DeFi stuff. Okay, so then we have another money raise from a crypto company called Zen Ledger, which raised $6 million. So this is a company that allow you to do your tax reporting.
00:19:13.798 - 00:20:01.434, Speaker A: And so they are raising money in a very specific context because right now in the US, lawmaker are debating a new bill for crypto. So we're going to talk more about this later. But this environment, of course, this is very good for Zen Ledger. All right, so then the hack of the week was done on popsicle finance, which was hacked of $25 million. Okay, so next we're going to continue with NFT. And we had a really good metrics this week. So the weekly NFT trade volume surpassed $300 million for the first time.
00:20:01.434 - 00:20:48.826, Speaker A: So this is a big milestone. But we're still far away from the volume on the Dexes. So I think the weekly volume for Dexes is probably above $10 billion, a couple of, maybe between ten to $30 billion, something like this. So this is still a fraction of the DEx, but huge increase in NFT. And really it feels like to me. So last year we had Defi Summer and maybe this year we're going to have NFT summer. Who knows? Okay, so what else do we have on NFT? So we have some news from Axie Infinity, the blockchain game, which became super popular and grew super fast.
00:20:48.826 - 00:21:29.314, Speaker A: And they went above $1 billion in all time trading volume. So absolutely huge. This is really going exponential because out of this 1 billion, about 800 million was generated in the last 30 days. Currently Axio Infinity is above crypto punk and NBA topshot. So it grew very fast. Then some news from Louis Vuitton which launched its own NFT. Okay, so you can see that this is a corporate website because it takes like a couple of minutes to load.
00:21:29.314 - 00:22:07.394, Speaker A: So they don't understand that people in crypto, they cannot wait. So, I mean, already everybody has left Louis Vuitton. This is too late. So yeah, some new NFT from them. Okay, so then the brand Burberry is also launching its own NFT. Then the NFT marketplace makers place has raised $30 million. And this NFT marketplace was famous because it's on this marketplace that the beeple collection was sold for $69 million.
00:22:07.394 - 00:22:34.378, Speaker A: So that was the absolute record at the time. Then we have some news from a project called Ad Block. So this is a new NFT project and it's becoming the new big trend. So let me see if I can show you how it looks like. Yeah. Okay, so it looks like this. So this is in the category of what we call a generative art.
00:22:34.378 - 00:23:32.670, Speaker A: So basically what's cool with generative art is that it's generated with equation. So that means that you can have basically all the data of the NFT can be stored on chain and then you have an equation on the front end that's going to reconstitute the image based on the data that are saved on the blockchain. This is different from NFT that just store the hash of the image and the actual image data outside of the blockchain. This generative art, everything can be stored on the blockchain. And so that's why I think that's the kind of NFT that has the most potential. Okay, so after we have some news from Cryptopunk, which is one of the darling of NFT. And so there was a huge spike in sale of crypto punk recently.
00:23:32.670 - 00:24:14.918, Speaker A: What's very interesting to note is that there is a strong correlation between the sale of cryptopunk and other collection. So if you're trying to analyze where the NFT market is going, pay attention to what's happening on cryptopunk. Okay, so next some news from FTX, which is one of the big crypto exchange. And they are launching NFT sport platform. So there are a lot of crypto exchange now that try to get into NFT. There was Binance, which launched its own platform a couple of weeks ago. So now it's FTX.
00:24:14.918 - 00:25:07.270, Speaker A: And on top of it, FTX has a partner with some franchise on esport. So I guess they're going to have some exclusive deal. Basically they're going to get some exclusive NFT. Okay, so next we're going to continue with news for enterprise blockchain and regulation. And we have some news from Coinbase that is acquiring a crypto data aggregator called Zabo. So Zabo has a team of ten people, so they're going to be joining Coinbase. And this is interesting for all the builders and all the entrepreneurs out there because a lot of people think that the way you really make a lot of money when you create a company and you don't have token, but let's say you're doing a crypto company without token.
00:25:07.270 - 00:26:02.090, Speaker A: So basically the ultimate event will be an IPO. But not everybody does an ipo. But before an IPO, actually what can happen is you can be acquired by bigger company and so that can provide you with an early chance to exit. So if you build a useful service and Coinbase is interested in this, then you can have your big exits in a couple of years. And you know that Coinbase, they just had the IPo, so they have a lot of money to spend. So you're going to see that they're going to do a lot of acquisition because they're going to leverage their money to do a lot of organic growth like this. Okay, so then we have some news from irogrey, which has just released a new legislation to regulate digital assets.
00:26:02.090 - 00:26:55.742, Speaker A: So basically they want to legalize digital assets in the country which will allow businesses in irugre to accept crypto payments. And that would provide a regulatory framework so that they can really incorporate crypto in their financial system. So this is the second country in South America that appears to be very crypto friendly. A couple of weeks ago, there was also a lot of good news from Salvador that made bitcoin a legal tender. So it's really nice to see some positive news from regulators. Okay, so the big news about regulation this week is the fight for the crypto bill in the US. So what's the context in the US currently they are debating this big bill, which is called the infrastructure bill.
00:26:55.742 - 00:27:50.818, Speaker A: So this is the administration of Joe Biden that wants to spend a lot of money to stimulate the economy, but this time they're not going to write checks to people, but they're going to invest in a lot of infrastructure project. And in the middle of nowhere, we don't know why someone, some senator somewhere was like, maybe he was like sleeping in the room and he just woke up crypto. Guys, I have something to say. Let's put some crypto stuff there. I don't know. They decided to put some crypto completely unrelated and it seems like what they put inside this bill is not really well thought out. So basically they want to impose some crazy requirement that would make pretty much everybody a broker, even developer, which means basically you have some crazy reporting requirement and it will just make life impossible for the crypto industry in the US.
00:27:50.818 - 00:28:43.140, Speaker A: So right now this is really a hot debate in the US and of course the crypto community is voicing this approval. And so hopefully they're going to be some waivers, some change in the law that will give us some exclusion, especially for developers. So we cross our finger. But if they vote a bad law, unfortunately it could trigger maybe a temporary crypto winter because that would be really bad news if the law passed as it is. Okay, so next some news from the Federal Reserve in the US that made some comments about stablecoin. So this governance said that he doesn't think CBDC are so good. Instead he thinks that private stablecoin might be better.
00:28:43.140 - 00:29:36.674, Speaker A: So far we didn't have so much news about private stablecoin. There was maybe Libra of Facebook a couple of years ago in 2018, but very quickly it completely flopped. All the partners just dispersed and that was the end of it. And now there is this governor that makes this remark. But the thing is, as an end user, I don't see why I would use the private stablecoin of Facebook or something because if they do anything I don't like, then I don't have anything to say. Whereas if it's a CBDC, okay, well this is centrally controlled, but at least this is from the government. So they have basically as a citizen, they are supposed to not do something bad to you.
00:29:36.674 - 00:30:29.534, Speaker A: So, yeah, I'm really not bullish on private stablecoin. Okay, so then we have some news from Hobi, which is an exchange in China. And so they just hired the former homeland security, someone who used to work for Homeland Security and who will be joining as a CEO. And so they're doing this in a context where regulators start to be more and more strict to crypto exchange. So they're trying to hire all these people who work in big government agency so that they can navigate the regulatory environment more easily. Okay, so then some news from binance us. The CEO of Binance US, Brian Brooks, just resigned.
00:30:29.534 - 00:31:09.460, Speaker A: So he used to be the former head of the office of the controller of the currency in the US. So that's basically some top regulator in the US. So he joined in April, and now he quit only a few months after that. And that's really bad because that probably means that there was a huge disagreement at the top. And that really comes at the worst moment for Coinbase because, you know, Coinbase had a string of really bad news the past few months. They were like all the regulators in the world that started to go against Coinbase, basically. So I don't know why this is happening, but it couldn't happen at a worse moment.
00:31:09.460 - 00:31:52.206, Speaker A: And there are also rumors that the CEO of Coinbase is actually looking for a candidate to replace him because he want to find someone who is more knowledgeable in regulatory stuff. Because you understand that right now, this is the problem number one of binance, and you'll be happy to step down and not be CEO anymore. And I guess it makes then, then another bad news for binance. So they're going to restrict derivative trading for Hong Kong users. So this is not the first country where this happened. They already announced this in Europe a couple of weeks ago. Yeah.
00:31:52.206 - 00:32:35.930, Speaker A: So basically, it's becoming more and more difficult for binance to offer derivative tradings anywhere in the world. Okay, so then we have some bad news for Monero. So Monero, which is basically, you can consider it as a sort of cousin of bitcoin. This is sort of a private bitcoin where basically everything is anonymous in Monero. Actually, when I first got into blockchain in 2017, my first project, I had to fork Monero, and I was super complicated because Monero is such a complex cryptocurrency. So in Monero, blockchain, basically, you don't know anything. You cannot tell where the money come from.
00:32:35.930 - 00:33:17.174, Speaker A: Everything is just so private. Of course, regulators are super against Monero. And the main maintainer of Monero, Ricardo Spagni, was arrested in the US and I think he will be deported to South Africa. South Africa is looking for him because they accuse him of having done some fraud with his former company. So apparently he did some tax fraud, issued some fake invoice. Basically that's what they're accusing him of. But yeah, so this is really bad news for Monero.
00:33:17.174 - 00:34:04.866, Speaker A: But in any case, you know what, I don't think that Monero had any future because really this is a completely private blockchain. So it's exactly what the regulators don't want. So there was no scenario under which Monero could win in the end. So it's sad, but yeah, sucks. Okay, so then some news for developers. So there is this new project, super cool, which is called use DAP. And basically the idea of this project is to add a developer tool in your browser for decentralized applications.
00:34:04.866 - 00:34:53.810, Speaker A: So you know, when you develop web application, you have the chrome dev tool where you can inspect the HTML, the CSS, Javascript, et cetera. And so this project is trying to do the same thing, but for decentralized application. And so you'll be able to see various events that happen in your DaP. For example, when metamask connect to the network, when the user approved, allow the DAP to connect to its account when some calls are sent to the blockchain, when it received a new block, et cetera. So it seems really. Yeah, I'm quite curious to see how it work out. Okay, so then we had this very useful tutorial of quicknote to show you how you can fork Ethereum mainnet with hot hat.
00:34:53.810 - 00:35:35.480, Speaker A: So hot hat, this is an alternative framework to truffle and one of its main selling point is that it allow you to fork the Ethereum mainnet very easily. And that's very useful because this allow you to test your spot contract against the real data of Menet. This is really a killer feature. So very useful tutorial here. I think that was my last news. So now we're going to do the Q and A. But yeah, just as a reminder, so tomorrow we are doing a live training on Ethereum, staking for Ethereum 2.0.
00:35:35.480 - 00:36:35.942, Speaker A: So if you want to register, you see it, I put the link here. And if you don't want to bother to buy all the live training separately and you just want to access all the courses of it, the blocks you might want to consider to, you might want to consider to join to take a membership on IdWblox so I just launched this one week ago. And so with this you can access all of my courses and there is a special launch price and it's going to end tomorrow at midnight after the price going to increase. Okay, so then we're going to do the Q and A. All right, so who do we have here? You have Ganesh, Ancap, inaccio Martin, Mike, Salomon, Charles hi, Julian. Happy to catch your live, Constantine. Hey, drink, drink there.
00:36:35.942 - 00:37:07.426, Speaker A: Hello. Thx I'm at the beach with my parents and my sister, but I'm making sure I have time to catch you. Awesome. Watching the live stream of eat the blocks from the beach, man, this is the best thing in the world. Ignacio Britos did you take a look at proof of humanity? No, but I think they contacted me on LinkedIn. So if you are from them, I will answer you on LinkedIn then. Abdelu Forman YouTube hello.
00:37:07.426 - 00:37:26.930, Speaker A: Share compare. Okay, this is a french fellow, Alexander Barry. What's up, Julian tennis ball. Hi, Constantine. Deflationary asset. Yeah, we're talking of the impact of EIP one five nine on Ethereum. Mohammed.
00:37:26.930 - 00:37:57.630, Speaker A: Hello, Constantine. Easyip 1559. And good news for flash loan, transfer fee would be lower, which means we'll have more winning transaction. Yeah, I mean, if in the end we have lower gas fee after EIP 1559, this is good for flash loan because every time we fail a flash loan, we still have to pay transaction fee. So that would means that now the cost of failure would be lower for flash loan Abdulu. Okay, so I'm going to translate in English. Hi, Julian.
00:37:57.630 - 00:38:28.718, Speaker A: I'm studying computer science. I'm watching your video to learn more about solidity, spot, contract and DAp. And I would like to know if I get better. If. Okay, and what's the rest of the question? If it would be possible to do an internship. Okay, so I haven't really thought of any internship at idoblox. Maybe in the future, but.
00:38:28.718 - 00:38:58.514, Speaker A: Right. Currently, no. But maybe Helio Rosa will eip one five nine bring the gas price down? I'm working on a project that has this point. It's not very viable on ethereum. Yeah, we'll have to wait and see. It's very difficult to anticipate what's going on on the market, but a lot of people made this prediction, so cross our finger. Nicolas Delgado.
00:38:58.514 - 00:39:21.214, Speaker A: Hey, Julian, how are you? Greetings from Argentina. Hey, man. Jake Brady. Hey, are you up on Pelsechain? No, I don't know Pelsechain. Richard hot forking ethereum with full state. Okay, so I thought he was already busy on either hex blockchain. So it will be a morrow of all as 20 contracts release the biggest airdrop in history.
00:39:21.214 - 00:39:55.500, Speaker A: Okay, I'm going to check it out, but what does it bring to the table besides just forking ethereum? Joe Biden, what are oracles? Oracles allow you to get outside data in the blockchain. And Chainlink is the big leader in this. And because especially in defi, this is very important to have outside data. So this is really a big part of the puzle. And we have Batman here. Hello, everyone. Hope everyone is having a great day.
00:39:55.500 - 00:40:15.690, Speaker A: Jake breeding real world data written on BC blockchain, you mean? Oh, I think you were answering the previous question. Rich argal. Good afternoon, everybody. Kenny's bolt token. I love you. Have learned much by watching you. Very good, Batman.
00:40:15.690 - 00:40:36.514, Speaker A: Smash the like button, everyone. Yes. Lesson to Batman. Always listen to Batman, no matter the situation. Okay, so then we have GSJ. This guy from FTX is on a row. Forex shock.
00:40:36.514 - 00:41:01.360, Speaker A: I love your show. Thanks, man. Greg Green, can't wait to enroll your training. Awesome. GSJ, can you explain into further detail channeling CCIP? No, I just saw the article, so I can't say more, but maybe later. But normally we are going to release a training of chainlink on edoblox. We are working with them.
00:41:01.360 - 00:41:40.506, Speaker A: Okay, Jake breeding at Edoblox, what is your favorite stablecoin and why? I like Dai? Because of the decentralized nature. Yeah, I like dai too. But what I don't like about Dai is that it's not as ubiquitous as tether and USDC. So I quite like USDC because it's more ubiquitous. It's in more exchanges and at the same time, it doesn't suffer from the bad reputation from tether. So, yeah, I like USDC. Alexander Barry Binance, not Coinbase, is getting all the hit.
00:41:40.506 - 00:42:17.830, Speaker A: Yes, unfortunately for them, Constantine, all other payments in stablecoin are taxed. It depends which country you're from. Some country, they have no laws at the moment. But I know, for example, in Singapore. Singapore, that's the case. If this is a payment, they don't care if you receive a payment with stablecoin, with crypto, whatever, you just have to pay based on the value at the time of the transaction. Jake breeding, it's a shame US get to regulate the rest of the world, usually by force for financial regulation.
00:42:17.830 - 00:42:37.818, Speaker A: Unfortunately, clearly they are the leader. Not for everything. For example, for regulation about privacy and then data. Usually Europe is the leader, but for finance. It's the US network gig. Decentralized. Best, then CDBC, then private.
00:42:37.818 - 00:42:55.682, Speaker A: Yes, it makes sense. We have seen how Zuckerberg is controlling Facebook and WhatsApp. Why do we want Libra? Yeah, no interest. Okay. Jack breeding. I know, right? If you're a mega supporter, your grocery cost 20% more in Libra. Yeah, thanks.
00:42:55.682 - 00:43:55.030, Speaker A: But not. Okay, so info bits, you use magic mushroom frequently? No, it's not my thing. Grandka Gm Hey Julian, what do you think about the liquidity adding features of safemoon? Does the liquidity actually increase price floor? The number of BNB remain the same, but the number of token increase? Yeah, that's interesting, but I don't think we have enough data to really see how it would work. There are basically just them and just some copycats who did this. But I like the idea. And generally if you have more liquidity. So this is not supposed to increase the price, but this is supposed to reduce the slippage.
00:43:55.030 - 00:44:36.750, Speaker A: Because if you have more liquidity with the same proportion of the two assets, then they're going to be less slippage, which means if you want to buy or sell a large quantity of the coin, it's going to have less impact on the price. And that's very important. Okay, so what do we have after Zach Bowles Morales IO has free archive nodes for Ethereum, BSE and polygon. If you're developing on a fork, you should check out as there is no block limit. Okay, interesting. Helio Rosa Grandpa GM do you mean the function that dumps token to the market? Swap tokens for ethereum? Iirc. Seems kind of dangerous.
00:44:36.750 - 00:45:46.358, Speaker A: CM Tamda and D Zima will the EIP 1559 going to help Ethereum alone or all the EVM compatible? Okay, so right now eip one five nine is only on Ethereum. So after it's up to the other network to decide if they want to incorporate this update or not. It's really on a case by case basis, but normally a couple of them should follow suit. Alireza when you don't make money on crypto, you sell courses. Mohammed adi Frediansa I hope etB will be like wi Fi or will be like wi fi or uniswap. Yeah, I hope so. Network geek do you have, do you have, do you, do you have GitHub for flash loan? So there is a GitHub where I have all the code for in the blocks.
00:45:46.358 - 00:46:08.400, Speaker A: Ronnie hey Julian, great work. Thanks, man. GSJ thank you Julian, for. All right guys, so thanks everybody for coming. And don't forget so tomorrow we have. Okay, so three announcements. Announcement number one.
00:46:08.400 - 00:46:30.600, Speaker A: Announcement number one. So tomorrow there will be a live training for ethereum staking 2.0 at 11:00 p.m. UTC, plus eight. Then second, tomorrow, this is the end of the launch price for the subscription of it, the blog. So I put the link here. Okay.
00:46:30.600 - 00:47:12.674, Speaker A: And finally, Friday, we're going to do another live training for ETB project number two. So if in the meantime, you have some idea, some suggestion on what could be this next project that we're all going to build together, then you send me an email. Julian@idoblox.com. Rodrigo, how do I subscribe to your courses monthly? I just put the link just above in the chat. Ronnie, don't forget to talk Riz Raphael about the project. Yeah, I mean, he will answer to you directly. All right, guys, so everybody have a great week, and I will see you later on in the blocks.
00:47:12.674 - 00:47:14.146, Speaker A: Bye, guys. Bye, guys. Bye.
