00:00:00.490 - 00:00:28.338, Speaker A: Hi guys, this is julian and you are on idoblox. And in this video I'm going to talk about the hidden benefits of solidity. So if you are learning solidity, you might think that you can just use this knowledge for Ethereum smart contract. But it's actually much better than this because you see the technology of solidity is reused in many other blockchains. One example of this is Ledger, the blockchain for permission blockchain.
00:00:28.434 - 00:00:30.118, Speaker B: So this is used by a lot.
00:00:30.124 - 00:01:05.120, Speaker A: Of big companies like a bank or in the supply chain industry who want to form consortium and exchange data privately. So they cannot use public blockchain, but they need to use modified blockchain that are more private. And so one of this project is called Hyperledger and it does use solidity. So if you use solidity for Ethereum smart contract, you can also use your knowledge for hyperledger. Another example is quorum. So quorum is a technology developed by Morgan. This is another form of permission blockchain where we use in financial services.
00:01:05.120 - 00:01:33.290, Speaker A: And you can also reuse Sudipi smart contract. And actually quorum is an actual fork of Ethereum. And finally, there is also the Tron blockchain. So Tron, which is really good for games that also use solidity, smart contract and the three blockchain I mentioned. This is actually a small subset of all the blockchain that use solidity.
00:01:33.630 - 00:01:36.506, Speaker B: And actually it's not just solidity, but.
00:01:36.528 - 00:02:05.570, Speaker A: It'S also ethereum in general. So Ethereum solidity and all the development tools are used in many different blockchains. So if you invest in learning Ethereum programming, actually you can leverage your knowledge across many other area, many other blockchain. So it's really good investment. So that's why I think there are many hidden benefits in learning solidity. And if you are learning solidity now.
00:02:05.720 - 00:02:11.366, Speaker B: I have a few gifts to give you because I've prepared five tips that.
00:02:11.388 - 00:02:18.374, Speaker A: I've learned over the years that have helped me a lot, like how to do a console log in solidity, for example.
00:02:18.492 - 00:02:21.734, Speaker B: And if you want to access these tips, all you have to do is.
00:02:21.772 - 00:02:34.058, Speaker A: To register for my free course link in the description. That's it for this video on the hidden benefit of solidity. See if you like it. You give it a like and see you for the next video. Bye.
