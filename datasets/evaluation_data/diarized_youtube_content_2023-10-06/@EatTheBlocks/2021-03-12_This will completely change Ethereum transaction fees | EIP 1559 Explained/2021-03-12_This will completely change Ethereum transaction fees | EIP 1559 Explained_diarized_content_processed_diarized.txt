00:00:00.330 - 00:00:45.158, Speaker A: When you send a transaction on Ethereum, do you enjoy dealing with gas price? Probably not, and nobody does. EIP 1559 is an upcoming update of Ethereum that will completely change transaction fees. It will simplify the user experience when you send a transaction. It may also reduce transaction fees and have a bullish effect for the price of ether. However, miners are not very happy about this update and they are doing everything they can to prevent ERP one five nine from happening. Hey, if you don't know me, I'm Julian and at etherblocks I teach blockchain development. When you send a transaction to Ethereum, you have to pay a transaction fee to miners.
00:00:45.158 - 00:01:23.522, Speaker A: In the current system, you specify how much to pay miners thanks to a parameter called gas price. Miners select the transactions with the highest gas price and mine them in priority. There are a couple of problems with this system. First, the current system make the transaction fees more expensive. The Ethereum protocol doesn't provide any help to estimate the gas price. It's up to each user to estimate what is a good gas price given market conditions. This estimation is done by wallets, and each wallet has its own estimation algorithm to be sure to get your transaction mined.
00:01:23.522 - 00:02:03.086, Speaker A: Most wallets overestimate the gas price. This creates a negative feedback loop where users send transaction with an infected gas price, which makes other wallets overestimate the gas price even more, which result in higher transaction fees for everybody. The second problem with the current system is that it gives a bad user experience. It's up to users to decide what is the gas price when they send a transaction. Wallets provide a suggestion, but as a user, you still have to make sure that the gas price suggestion is good. If you overestimate the gas price, nobody will refund you. You will just pay too much, and miners are the only one who benefit.
00:02:03.086 - 00:02:40.490, Speaker A: And if you underestimate the gas price, your transaction might never be mine. Can we do better than this? Yes, we can, and that's what EIP one five nine is all about. In the new system of EIP 1559, the transaction fees will have two components, the base fee and the occlusion fee. The base fee is a fee that will be burned, which means this ether will be destroyed. This base fee is determined algorithmically by the ethereum network. The sum of all gas spent by all transactions in the block is capped. That's what we call the block gas limit.
00:02:40.490 - 00:03:05.986, Speaker A: Once we reach that cap, next transaction needs to wait the next block before it can be included. Currently, the block gas limit is set at 12.5 million gas. With EIP 1559, the block gas limit will be increased to 25 million. When the block gas utilization is below 12.5, the base fee will decrease and if it's above, it will increase. When it comes to the other part of a transaction, the inclusion fee, this is the fee paid to miners.
00:03:05.986 - 00:03:29.722, Speaker A: This is paid at the discretion of the center of a transaction. There was some research done to see how much this inclusion fee should be, and the result was one way. So let's take an example. Let's say that the base fee is 50 gwe. For the inclusion fee, we take one GUI total. Our gas price is 51 guay. For a transfer of ether, the total gas cost will be 21,000 gas.
00:03:29.722 - 00:04:12.926, Speaker A: So if we multiply 21,000 by 51 guay, we have a cost of about $1.92. Under normal condition, when the block is not full, users don't compete with each other. As long as they pay the base fee and the inclusion fee, they're pretty much guaranteed to have their transaction mined. And for wallets, it's super easy to estimate the gas cost since the current base fee is known. When you send a transaction, you specify the inclusion fee and the maximum gas fee you will pay. Contrary to current transaction with EIP 1559, you will get a refund if you end up needing less gas. For example, if the base fee plus inclusion fee that you end up paying is less than the maximum gas fee you specify, you will be refunded the difference.
00:04:12.926 - 00:05:07.466, Speaker A: Now what happened if the block is full? In this case, miners cannot include all transactions in the block. They have to choose the most profitable transactions depending on the inclusion fee. And this is very similar to what we have currently, but it's expected that this situation won't happen too often, and if it does, the developer of Ethereum might decide to increase the block gas limit. So in this section we saw that EIP 1559 was great for the user experience. But what about the implication for ether price? One big criticism of Ethereum is that it's inflationary because of minor block rewards. Currently, the annual rate of inflation is 5%. This makes Ethereum a poor fit for being a store of value, and this is why bitcoin and its hard cap of 21 million bitcoin make it more appealing for being a digital gold.
00:05:07.466 - 00:06:06.106, Speaker A: I've seen a couple of other videos that say that Ethereum will become deflationary as a result of EIP 1559, but this is not so simple. With EIP 1559, the base fee of each transaction will be burned, which will remove some ether from the total supply, but at the same time, new ether will be created for each block and given to miners as the block reward. Exactly like before EIP 1559. We already know in advance how much ether is created for each block with block rewards, but we don't know how many transactions will be mined in future blocks and with which base fee. If the utilization of the network is high, the base fee will be higher. There will be more transactions, which means the quantity of ether burned as base fee will be superior to the quantity of ether created by minor block reward. In that case, the total supply of ether will decrease.
00:06:06.106 - 00:06:57.682, Speaker A: But if this is the contrary, which is if the network usage is low, we won't have enough base fee burn and the creation of ether of minor block reward will be superior. In that case, Ethereum will continue to be inflationary. The demand for Ethereum is super high even with high transaction fees. That's why I believe that the deflationary scenario is much more likely, and that's why I believe the price of Ether will go up as a consequence of EIP 1559. So we have seen that EIP 1559 is good for users, it's good for investors. What about for miners? With a new fee model of EIP 1559, miners will earn about 30% less and of course they don't like it. So 60% of miners are against EIP 1559.
00:06:57.682 - 00:07:36.142, Speaker A: If they wanted, they could keep mining the old version of Ethereum without EIP 1559, which would fork the Ethereum network. Could that mean trouble for Ethereum? I don't think so. The community has already decided to adopt EIP 1559 is scheduled for the burling fork this summer. If miners do not follow the EIP 1559 update, they will keep mining the old Ethereum chain. But if they do this, they will spend real money to mine a worthless version of Ethereum. So you can be sure that exchanges will follow what user want, not miners. It will be like bitcoin versus bitcoin cash.
00:07:36.142 - 00:08:02.006, Speaker A: The ether markets on exchanges will be the ether of the EIP 1559 chain. Miners aren't stupid. They don't want to lose money. So I believe that no matter what they say, in the end they will follow the opinion of the Ethereum community and go with EIP 1559. And another thing to consider is that miners made so much money recently. In February 2021, miners earned almost $1.4 billion, their best months ever.
00:08:02.006 - 00:08:40.220, Speaker A: So even if they take a 30% decrease in their fee, I think they will still be fine. So yappy 1559 is going to happen, even if miners are unhappy about it, it's going to improve significantly the user experience. It may also reduce transaction fees a little bit, but that's not the main goal. And for us developers, it's going to simplify how we send transactions, since we won't have to deal with estimating gas prices anymore. Since we are talking of Ethereum transactions in this video, it may be a good idea to have a refresher on what is inside an Ethereum transaction and how it works. And for this, you can check out this video. I will see you there.
