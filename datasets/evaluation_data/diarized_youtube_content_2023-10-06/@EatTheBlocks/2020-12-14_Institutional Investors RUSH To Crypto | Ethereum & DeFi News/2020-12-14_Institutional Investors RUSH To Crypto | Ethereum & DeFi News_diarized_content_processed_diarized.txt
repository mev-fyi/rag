00:01:02.600 - 00:01:34.140, Speaker A: Test. Test. Is there a sound now? Is there a sound? Sun sound. God damn it. Is there a sound? Sun it. Test now. Okay.
00:01:34.140 - 00:01:59.714, Speaker A: Oh, my bad. Okay, I'm going to do the intro again. I'm going to do the intro again. Okay, sorry about that. Okay, so we start from the beginning. Oh, man. Okay, so welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and D five.
00:01:59.714 - 00:02:25.420, Speaker A: I do this every Monday at 10:00 a.m. East coast at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. And in this video, I'm going to be talking of Ethereum two. We're going to see how the situation is going on the network. Then a D five project that did a giant 400% gain over the last week. What happening in the chat? Just no video.
00:02:25.420 - 00:03:07.534, Speaker A: What's that? What do you mean no video? Who's saying no video? What? Really? You guys say no video? Hey guys, can you see the video? Because in the chat someone said no video. I'm not sure about that. Okay, well, let's just keep going. So, nfT news, ton of news for enterprise. And if you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host. And on my channel, eat the blocks, I teach blockchain development. And very important, my course on DeFi programming is going to be released on December 20.
00:03:07.534 - 00:03:31.900, Speaker A: I'm going to show some exclusive previews. So if you want to see these previews, just register with the link I just posted. Yes. Okay. Yeah, so register for that. Okay, so let's get started with the price of. Damn, I closed that.
00:03:31.900 - 00:04:07.850, Speaker A: Bad tab management here. Yeah. So let's start with the price of Ether. So this week was not many change, this week like -3% so we kind of did a dip. But I think here some institutionals started to do some accumulation. So we backed at the original level. So, yeah, not much happening on Ethereum for the price this month for the gas price.
00:04:07.850 - 00:04:41.030, Speaker A: So, yeah, I always like to monitor the gas situation, see what's going on. So gas price, it's nothing special. Stable here. Yeah, I don't know why I feel powerful when I monitor the metrics of the Ethereum network. Makes me feel in control. Okay, so then we're going to see the situation for Ethereum 2.0. So currently we are at almost 1,500,000 ether that are locked.
00:04:41.030 - 00:05:11.878, Speaker A: So yeah, I mean, people kept pouring in to become validator. So that means that the current yield decreased a little bit. So when we just launched, we were close to 16%. Now we are at 2.5% something and it's going to keep decreasing as more people are coming. But still it's a very nice rate. And so next, let's see some metrics for the beacon chain.
00:05:11.878 - 00:05:42.138, Speaker A: So here what's very important is the network participation. So here, 99% has some deep here, some dip. But overall we're still very high. A lot of active validator, 32,000, a lot of people that are waiting to be accepted because you need to wait. There is basically a limit of 900 new validators a day. So 12,000. That means there's more than a week.
00:05:42.138 - 00:06:10.722, Speaker A: Actually it's probably more than ten, maybe even like two weeks of waiting if you want to become a validator. Yeah. And here below, you can see that the blocks keeps being mined. So yeah, everything is going well on e two. There were a couple of slashing events. So some people actually lost some of their ether because they had some problem with their validator. Basically they validated some blocks that were not correct.
00:06:10.722 - 00:06:53.778, Speaker A: So we did have some slashing even, but very few. Okay, then some news from the Ethereum foundation. So there are always people who think that the Ethereum foundation doesn't do much, but actually Ethereum foundation is super busy doing all sort of thing. So on the blog of Ethereum, they explain a little bit what they do. So let's scroll down and see a little bit all the different teams. So you have some teams for Ethereum one, some team for Ethereum 2.0. So not everything is easy to understand.
00:06:53.778 - 00:07:28.922, Speaker A: Like just the name of some teams already is difficult. Like this one for example, apply ZKP. I mean, I'm sure this is super smart. Okay, so yeah, I mean they do like some really deep research stuff for Ethereum 2.0. So it's not things that are sort of consumable for the rest of us, but still, it's still very important for the communities here. So all these things here are going to be used internally, probably ethereum, to research. Super important then.
00:07:28.922 - 00:08:12.634, Speaker A: Ewasm. So ewasm, this is a new virtual machine for the ethereum network that's going to use webassembly under the hood. So right now the EVM has been built in a very custom way, but it's better if we can reuse some building blocks that are bigger, like the webassembly. So yeah, here it's the teams about this formal verification. This is about remix solidity is a big team, zero knowledge proof. Zocrat is related to zero knowledge proof. Yeah.
00:08:12.634 - 00:08:58.714, Speaker A: So you can see a little bit what they're doing here. Okay, so next let's see the situation for Defi token. So that was really good week. We had some insane gain like 400% for idle finance. I will talk more about idle finance after and see why it increased so much here. Default Protocol 142% Wing Finance 61% Wing Finance this is a cross blockchain DeFi protocol hacker 47% hacker this is a collection of different DeFi project index. This is basically a DFI index that invest in many.
00:08:58.714 - 00:09:23.330, Speaker A: Defi protocol 43% cover. This is an insurance token 12% and for the losers, we don't have so many. So worst loser 33%. So all of this project, to be honest, I never heard about them. I don't see any really famous project that got a big decrease. Oh yeah, ample falls here. Saffron finance.
00:09:23.330 - 00:09:53.660, Speaker A: They are really volatile. They have some really good week and some really terrible week. But I think the project is serious hedge. I think they're doing insurance on the blockchain keep the token of the keep network of andre Cornhe, et cetera. So overall, pretty good week for defi token. Okay, so next, what the situation for lending. So lending this week is pretty cool.
00:09:53.660 - 00:10:24.740, Speaker A: Yeah. 5.21% tether on compound. Actually, when I talk of compound, I always forget that there is also the liquidity binding incentive. So you get actually a couple of percent on top of what you see here with the comb token reward. And actually, if you're interested in this, you can check out my video on how to calculate APy yield in deFi. I did this video a couple of weeks ago.
00:10:24.740 - 00:10:48.602, Speaker A: A couple of days ago, sorry. Yes. Then some really nice return here. Almost 6% with USDC on Ave. Yeah, it's pretty solid. Okay, so then let's move on to the market cap in DeFi. So in DeFi, 14.55
00:10:48.602 - 00:11:16.742, Speaker A: billion, small decrease of 400 million compared to last week. But if we switch to ether, we can see that actually in ether the picture looks a little bit better. So we start to see some ether flowing back to defy again. Yeah. So what's really important to know is that we have the competition of Ethereum two staking. But as more and more people are staking Ethereum 2.0, then the yield is going to be lower and lower.
00:11:16.742 - 00:11:54.526, Speaker A: And so we'll see some people slowly coming back to DFI. Yes. So not much happening otherwise for the market cap in DFI. So then we're going to talk of idle finance, who did 400% for his token this week. So what is this? Idle finance is a yield optimizer like Yan finance, but with a little bit more control. So you can specify the level of risk that you want. So here, base yield, risk adjusted, et cetera.
00:11:54.526 - 00:12:22.426, Speaker A: And compared to Yun finance, it just feels a little bit better productized. So they launched that token two weeks ago, this is a governance token. And last week they reached 100 million of assets deposited in the protocol. So yeah, clearly they're doing pretty well. And last month they raised 1.2 million from VC. So yeah, because of that, I like this project.
00:12:22.426 - 00:13:00.470, Speaker A: Yeah, really like this project. Then there is this report, financial report of yarn finance, that was created by the community. So it hasn't been audited by any accounting firm, but it has some interesting insight. So yeah, this is for the period from August 20 to October 20. So here you can see some inside. For example, net income was almost 4 million. Most of this revenue coming from this product, the Y vault.
00:13:00.470 - 00:13:45.158, Speaker A: Then in this y vault, most of the revenue is coming from the Y USD vault. Then you got some other insight, like 80% of the expenses, security cost and salaries. And yeah, if you're interested you can dig into it. But I think it's interesting to see this and probably we're going to see some other Defi community that start to do some report like this. And also that's a good sign that is sent to regulators because as we know, regulators start to look more and more at Defi. Okay, so then we're going to talk of NFT. A couple of news for NFT this week.
00:13:45.158 - 00:14:10.654, Speaker A: So super rare introduces a new auction system. Super rare. This is one of the leading marketplace for NFT. They've been running for quite a while. I didn't know actually. They've been running for more than three years and so they had a lot of time to listen to their users, take some feedback. And thanks to this, they revamped the auction system.
00:14:10.654 - 00:14:48.482, Speaker A: So with a new auction system, they have more security and transparency. It prevents frauds. So here I think they use some technical word. I didn't know about it. Let me see, where do they put this? Oh yeah, here they prevent fraud such as the chandelier and phantom beads. Okay, so I don't know what it is, but maybe some people who are familiar with auction know that sort of thing. But basically what I understand is that before, because their system wasn't complete, the process was partly done on Twitter.
00:14:48.482 - 00:15:27.240, Speaker A: Like the guy who was doing the auction had to mention some sort of initial price on Twitter. And so, yeah, I mean, that was a little bit sloppy. And so, yeah, so now everything is done in the smart contract and is much more secure. So, yeah, we're going to see if with this, they can increase the amount of auction they do every month. Then next we have this other project, send co. So another NFT marketplace. I didn't know about them.
00:15:27.240 - 00:15:51.660, Speaker A: So with the marketplace, you can buy tweets from verified accounts and put it in NFT. Guys, this is just so crazy. Like blockchain just never stop. One week, maybe you see some craziness on the blockchain. You think, okay, that's it. That's the most crazy we'll see next week. There is the guy finding something more crazy.
00:15:51.660 - 00:16:20.966, Speaker A: For example, you can find a tweet of Donald Trump that you like, or Biden. Yeah. You buy the tweet and then they create an NFT and you own that tweet. I mean, this is just so insane. Okay, so cryptokitties. So this is a blockchain game if you never heard about it. Yeah.
00:16:20.966 - 00:16:59.714, Speaker A: So there is a crypto kitty who was accepted as a collateral in a crypto loan. So there is this project, there's this lending platform called NFTFI that has approved a loan with a collateral of $25,000, which is a crypto kitty. Basically, someone borrowed money by pledging his crypto kitty. So, yeah, this is really crazy. Yeah, I really show you what I was talking about, the merger of NFT and Defi. We started to see some hybrid project like this. So, yeah, it's pretty cool.
00:16:59.714 - 00:17:29.260, Speaker A: There is really a lot of innovation to be done in NFT and compared to defi, still very underdeveloped. So a lot of opportunity there. Then I wanted to show you some nice nft I saw on this website, people. So let's see. I really like that. Mean, to be fair, I've never saw some design like this online. Really, the first time I saw this was like for NFT, just so creative, just so beautiful.
00:17:29.260 - 00:18:00.102, Speaker A: Yeah, I really wonder how much time they take to do it. And it's just insane, like how much they sell it. Like $90,000, $50,000, $100,000. Guys, seriously, I feel bad because I'm trying to sell my course to become blockchain developer. But no, you shouldn't be a blockchain developer. You should be an NFT artist. Makes way more money.
00:18:00.102 - 00:18:34.100, Speaker A: Guys, it looks simple like this, but we don't know exactly what it takes to reach that level. Maybe it's like a team who do this picture. Maybe these guys have been doing these for years. I mean, there is more to it than what we see here. But, yeah, I find this Nft to be really beautiful. I'm not sure I would buy them for, like, 100K. It's kind of insane, but, yeah, it's kind of interesting to see this.
00:18:34.100 - 00:19:14.960, Speaker A: Okay, so we're going to leave the world of art to go in the boring world of enterprise. The boring world, but still necessary because we need this guy to really take off. In Defi, we had a lot of institutional who invested in crypto recently. This really good. You probably heard of microstrategy, but this is not the only one. So, first of all, mass mutual invested $100 million in a bitcoin. So mass mutual, this is an american company that.
00:19:14.960 - 00:19:44.082, Speaker A: This is a life insurance that serves 5 million clients. They have a revenue of $30 billion, an asset under management of almost $700 billion. Okay. Some really big guy. And very, very important. The most important, they have the headquarter in Springfield. Springfield, which is the city of Homer Simpson.
00:19:44.082 - 00:20:14.850, Speaker A: Like you should know. Right. So, yeah, it's very bullish because it sends a signal to other life insurance and pension funds. It's really, really good. A strategy at Morgan said that mass mutual bitcoin purchases represent another milestone to the bitcoin adoption by institutional investors. One can see the potential demand that could arise over the coming years as the other insurance companies and pension funds follow mass mutual example. Yeah, I wouldn't say more.
00:20:14.850 - 00:20:52.766, Speaker A: JPMorgan wouldn't say more. Then microstrategy, add $1 billion of bitcoin and ether. So microstrategy is a company that provides business intelligence software. Okay, well, I have to tell you something, because my first internship, when I was just out of grad school, I used a business intelligence software, and that was just so boring. It's incredibly boring. Seriously. So these guys are in a very boring business.
00:20:52.766 - 00:21:28.806, Speaker A: Boring, but lucrative. Lucrative. And so this company, Microstrategy, this is one of the largest player for that kind of software. In August and September, they already bought 425,000,000 of bitcoin as a reserve asset for their treasury. This is actually their primary reserve asset. And so it's how they became famous, because before, we didn't really heard about this company. This is just like the sort of company that makes a lot of money, but they are just in the corporate enterprise world, but really they never really make headlines.
00:21:28.806 - 00:21:55.058, Speaker A: And they started to become famous in crypto because they started to use bitcoin as their reserve asset. So it's like, very unusual for this sort of company. They announced that they will raise $400 million to invest in bitcoin. So this is a new investment. See, this will be just for qualified investors only. So, in other words, you got to be rich. You got to be rich, or you cannot invest in them.
00:21:55.058 - 00:22:35.802, Speaker A: And at the end of this investment, they will have 1.2 billion invested in bitcoin, which is about 0.3% of the total market cap of bitcoin. So I'm actually a bit surprised that they can raise money to do this, because it's not an investment company. This is a software company that sells a boring software to big company. They already make a lot of money, but maybe they have some really cool CFO, like maybe some guy who watched my channel, I don't know. And so, yeah, that guy decided to be very innovative.
00:22:35.802 - 00:23:25.514, Speaker A: So I actually don't know how does this work legally, how they are even able to raise money in order to invest in bitcoin? I really don't know how this work. Maybe some people who know more about legal stuff can tell us. Yeah. Okay, so another institutional who invest a lot of money in crypto, this is Grayscale, that invested $1 billion in bitcoin and eth this week. So, Grayscale, we talk a lot about it. This is an investment company that managed cryptocurrency. This is a subsidiary to the digital currency group DCG, which also owns the cryptocurrency news and digital media company coindesk.
00:23:25.514 - 00:23:55.494, Speaker A: So if you're present a lot on crypto, Twitter, there were so many conspiracy about them. Some people, yeah, they manipulate the price of bitcoin, blah, blah, blah. So many bad stuff. I don't know why they have this really bad reputation when it comes to me. I don't care about all these rumors. All that matters is that this is a big company, and they invest a lot of money in crypto. So that's good.
00:23:55.494 - 00:24:26.446, Speaker A: So they have $7.3 billion in assets under management, mostly invested in bitcoin and in ETH. I think this is actually the bigger holder of bitcoin with 5 billion of bitcoin in their portfolio. So this is more than 1% of all the market cap. Yes. Okay, so then another institutional that invest a lot in crypto is coin shares. This is another fund of crypto assets.
00:24:26.446 - 00:24:56.860, Speaker A: I would put them in the same category as grayscale. And then we had fidelity digital assets that will allow its institutional customer to use bitcoin as collateral against cash loan. So this is one of the biggest asset manager in the world, Fidelity, with 3.3 billion. No, not billion. Not Julian. Not possible.
00:24:56.860 - 00:25:14.738, Speaker A: I think I wrote the wrong letter here. No, it should be 3.3 trillion. Okay. Which is more than the GDP of France should be the GDP of Japan. Yeah. So basically they manage as many assets as Japan produced in one year.
00:25:14.738 - 00:26:14.206, Speaker A: Not bad, right? So with this new service that will target bitcoin investors who are keen to turn their holding into cash without selling like hedge funds or miners. So they will not make the loan themselves, but they will partner with Blockfi, which is a crypto lending company. And in order to receive the loan, we need to also have an account with blockfi. But this is just for institutional, institutional investors to get started. But, yeah, it's good because it's going to create some extra demand for bitcoin because the more use we can have of crypto and the more bullish it is for the price. So this is pretty good. Then we have JP Morgan that settled a repo on its private blockchain.
00:26:14.206 - 00:27:07.990, Speaker A: Okay, so let's explain one of this. So first of all, what's a repo? So a repo basically allow banks like Morgan to trade large quantity of securities and to borrow cheaply, which allow party to cash to own a small return. It's like repo trade are like basically a short term loan. And basically you have a trader that sell an asset to another trader at a set price and they commit to repurchase the same asset at a different price at a future date. And so these repo are really huge for short term financing on financial market. And they're also working on their own blockchain, which is called. What's the name of the blockchain? Onyx.
00:27:07.990 - 00:27:44.974, Speaker A: They've made a demo. So they completed this repo trade on their own blockchain. So, yeah, we'll see. JPMorgan has been very active in. They, they are one of the main contributors to something called quorum, if I remember well, which is a private blockchain project that has now almost merged with Bezu, I believe, or is very similar. They are also very close to consensus. I think there was a deal between Morgan and consensus.
00:27:44.974 - 00:28:07.454, Speaker A: I don't remember exactly. Was it Morgan who invested in consensus or the other way around? But they were. Oh, no, I think it was Morgan selling. Selling a team to. Yeah, yeah. Something like. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if like sometime next year we start to see some part of the financial market moving to private blockchain.
00:28:07.454 - 00:28:55.638, Speaker A: So of course it's not as good as public blockchain, but it's really a good. How do you say this? Super positive for blockchain in general to see all the traditional finance role coming to. So then Luca gets funding from SMP. So Luca is a company that produces crypto price data to Wall street companies. So they are basically like the Bloomberg of crypto. So just to give a little bit of context here. So SMP, which itself is a company that produces a lot of indices for finance, of course, the most famous one is the SNP 500.
00:28:55.638 - 00:29:29.134, Speaker A: So SMP is entering the crypto space next year by launching some new crypto indices. They've announced this last week. So they're already preparing everything, doing some acquisition that are relevant. That's why they're doing this. Okay, so next, still in the enterprise category. So Metamask is going to release an enterprise version of its wallet. So it's going to be aimed at trading firm and crypto custodian.
00:29:29.134 - 00:30:17.966, Speaker A: It will provide them with the institutional grade features, which mean it's going to cost a lot of money. So it's including the ability to swap tokens, borrow, lend and invest in Ethereum applications. Yes, it's basically a metamask on steroids. And the goal is to be used in professional defi trading desk. So what's the context? So Metamask has been struggling a little bit to generate some revenue. That's why they introduced this built in exchange in their wallet a couple of months ago, so they can start to make some money. So yeah, I think this is a pretty smart move of metamask to go after the enterprise world, which has much more money than retail.
00:30:17.966 - 00:30:51.454, Speaker A: Metamask for a long time, were just going after retail users and yeah, they had a lot of success in terms of the user base grew a lot. I think they reached something like 1 million developer a few months ago. So like really major milestone here. But in terms of revenue, they weren't making any. So now they start to be more greedy. They're like, yeah, guys, okay, enough playing around now we're here to make some money. No, but that's okay.
00:30:51.454 - 00:31:30.570, Speaker A: They gave so much to the community, so yeah, I want them to make money then. A japanese city is going to try a blockchain voting system. So this is just for local elections. So a slightly lower stake, but still we have to start somewhere. So yeah, I'll be curious to see what kind of blockchain they're going to use. Yeah, they should use ethereum, of course. Okay, and then we're going to see some news about regulation.
00:31:30.570 - 00:32:09.860, Speaker A: I love regulation. So there are some rumors about regulation on self hosted wallet in the US. So basically, self hosted wallet is just wallets that are not controlled by centralized exchange. Yeah, so we heard a couple of rumors, and so these rumors appear to be true. So Brian Armstrong, which is the CEO of Coinbase, reiterated his concern about this. So he tried to make this guy to reach out to this guy. Secretary, I don't know how you say this.
00:32:09.860 - 00:32:20.730, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Well, let's say Secretary M. We'll call him Mr. M. Okay. It's easier. So, yeah, he tried to explain.
00:32:20.730 - 00:33:18.730, Speaker A: Brian Armstrong tried to explain this guy how the project of regulation will be bad for the US, but the US is not the only one having really bad ids at the moment because France, my great country, is at war with crypto. And by the way, guys, this is a horrible flag. Seriously, like, who wrote this article? Like, yogita Catri? Like, seriously, where did you find this article? Did you guys run out of budget to hire some freelancer? What happened? This is a disgusting french flag. Okay, increase the flag budget for next article. Right. So basically, in France, they're going to be some new, very strict regulation that will make France one of the least welcoming country in the world for crypto. Yes.
00:33:18.730 - 00:33:36.130, Speaker A: We can be first at. Yes, yes. So this year in France, we won a couple of contests. So first, one least welcoming country for crypto. Yes. World most affected country by Covid. Yeah, we won already two times.
00:33:36.130 - 00:34:13.130, Speaker A: Yeah, let's keep going, friends. We're doing great. So, KYC procedures will be obligatory for any amount transferred. Before there was a minimum threshold of €1000 or below that, there was no KYC. So it's not only compulsory for fiat to crypto, but also for crypto to crypto, which is totally nuts. And the official bullshit reason is to fight terrorism. So, as you know, after the recent events of France, yeah, there was some terrorism, and some of these terrorists were financed with bitcoin.
00:34:13.130 - 00:34:40.274, Speaker A: So, yeah, of course it makes sense. We need to make KYC for everybody. Totally makes sense. Like, if terrorists cannot use fiat money, right? So, yeah, that's a problem in France and in Europe in general, we just have too many law, too many regulation. And talking about low, I'm actually going to teach you something. So do you guys know how we can say. How we say French? French.
00:34:40.274 - 00:34:59.458, Speaker A: In Chinese we say faguo. And it literally means the country of low. Fa. It's like this character means low, the country of low. So even the Chinese, they know. They know we have too many low. Okay, so next, some news for developers.
00:34:59.458 - 00:35:58.858, Speaker A: So there is new EIP for flash loan. EIP means ethereum improvement proposal. So that's basically a sort of specification to create some standard in the Ethereum community. So the goal of this specification is to standardize flash loans. So now we have different DeFi protocol that each do their flash loan the same way, but with this specification want to standardize all of this so that each flash loan provider respect a standard interface and maybe on top of it it can provide extra feature. Yeah, I would love it, I would love it because right now this is like super painful to have to deal with all these different flash on provider. Yeah, so I like this article of remix which documented the latest updates.
00:35:58.858 - 00:36:35.350, Speaker A: Actually the team of Remix has been hard at work, but because this is a tool that we just use the basic function of remix, so we don't always pay attention. But there are actually so many things you can do with remix. Like I had a look and I had no idea. For example, I didn't know it's possible to run some script in, some Javascript script in remix. So you can basically sort of simulate your dap in remix. So yeah, I like to try that. Then maybe some more internal update.
00:36:35.350 - 00:37:22.154, Speaker A: There is some unit testing also I never did unit testing in remix. I want to try that. The debugger, I used it already. Yeah, and after I think it's more like more internal updates but yeah, good job, good job remix team. And lastly there's this new project that shows you the different bug bounty for the Defi project. So that's a good way to monetize your skills. So it's probably not, I wouldn't recommend beginners to waste time here because it's probably above your level, but if you've been learning blockchain for like six months, one year, probably we can make it.
00:37:22.154 - 00:38:05.942, Speaker A: And as you can see, the rewards can be pretty high. So yeah, after it all depends how fast you do it. Let's say that 150 thousand dollars, but it takes you, I don't know, it takes you a year to do it. Well yeah, it's not so good, but I know this one, for example, $5,000 if you can make it in a couple of days or in one week, then it's a lot of money. So yeah, it's a nice way to monetize your skill. This is the end, so now we're going to do the Q A. Yeah, very quickly I put the link for the announcement for my defi programming course.
00:38:05.942 - 00:38:52.198, Speaker A: If you haven't registered yet, register. So this is just to be notified when the course comes out. The course is not out yet it's going to be released later in. Right. All right guys, so now I'm going up in the chat and see a little bit the question. So hi dunami, sergey abrah diraj thiech Derek Alex Batman Negus turkey neck. Yeah, we have many people.
00:38:52.198 - 00:39:58.806, Speaker A: Jill is here also. Okay, so first question. Let me see, let me see. Where is the first question? Julian, I have a question from abracadabra. What are your thoughts about all the Amm dexes which are trying to work cross chain on Polkadot like Polka starter, polka swap acala? Which one of the project could really work? Yeah, I think this is interesting in the sense that it could be used as a template to go between Ethereum and l two scaling solution side chain of Ethereum. So I don't really believe that there will be a lot of demand, for example between ethereum and maybe binance smart chain or something like this. But I think the main use cases will be inside the ethereum ecosystem between Ethereum and the side chain.
00:39:58.806 - 00:40:32.118, Speaker A: But I'm not sure that Polkast starter can do this. Yeah, I think Polkast starter it will be more like between Ethereum and binance smart chain. For example. Abrahad, a question Julie is having every Monday plus 300 subs. So I think I'm not alone. We like this upload plus 300 subs in one day. I wish I'm not there yet, but yeah, next year.
00:40:32.118 - 00:40:59.498, Speaker A: Let's do it. Next milestone then. Batman. Don't know if I missed it, but a lot of crypto companies now are going for bank status to hold crypto and vice versa. Interesting. I didn't know that. I knew that banks in the US can have this new regulatory status where they can be like a crypto asset custodian.
00:40:59.498 - 00:41:44.122, Speaker A: But I didn't know that crypto company also tried to go for bank status. Yeah, it's really interesting to see this convergence. Negastech asked me where do you think is best resource for DeFi Legos? What do you mean? Do you mean to learn or to a tool? So a tool is a nice tool we can use is called money Lego. And actually I have a video about this. This is a Javascript library if you want to learn. I have a ton of video about DeFi programming on my channel. So yeah, I have a playlist about Defi programming.
00:41:44.122 - 00:42:27.318, Speaker A: Then I have also another playlist for DeFi app projects. So yeah, can check my then Turkey Nick McConnell. What up Julian? Did you stake Eth for the beacon chat? No, I didn't, unfortunately, because I think the yield is pretty good. Probably it's going to stay. I believe it's going to stay, like above 10% for maybe half a year. Batman. Validate the ecosystem when banks use blockchain.
00:42:27.318 - 00:43:20.122, Speaker A: Yes, indeed, indeed. Abracadabra. Question for julian, from your point of view, does project as Acropolis was to stake and hold and invest with them, or is this just fomo because Andre Kone merges with know? Even though Andre Kone is very respected in the defi industry, I don't get so excited about partnership. I don't really see this as a huge validation of Andre Conore, which say, oh, this is an awesome project, blah, blah, blah. I just see it as Andre Conroy. You want to grow his own project, then you find maybe some other project that seems decent, then they want to do something together. They do it, he does it.
00:43:20.122 - 00:43:49.218, Speaker A: But I don't think Andre Connery necessarily think that means, oh, Acropolis is like the project of the century. Yeah. So I would say if you like Acropolis, you like what they're doing, you can invest. But, yeah, I wouldn't just follow Andre Connor. No. Then let me see, let me see. Next question.
00:43:49.218 - 00:44:03.862, Speaker A: Abracadabra. Questions for June. Hey, you know what? I love it the way you do it. Abracadabra. Because this is so clear, because I don't always know if this is a question for me or if it's just people chatting, but you. It's clear. It's like, question for Julian.
00:44:03.862 - 00:44:31.442, Speaker A: You know how to attract my attention. So, Julian, I would love if you could tell us more about ERC 313370. My God, this ERC is so long already. The code of the ERC makes me scared. It looks complicated already, which is used by rootkid. Okay. So, yeah, I can have a look, but just have absolutely no idea.
00:44:31.442 - 00:44:58.060, Speaker A: What is this? Maybe another video. Gary Sen says, yo, yo, Gary. Yo. Negative question. Where can I register for the course? Very good question. So I guess you mean six figure blockchain developer. Let me give you the link.
00:44:58.060 - 00:45:19.438, Speaker A: So let me add you. Can I do at? Yeah, I can do at. Okay, I'll post the link for you. Negastek. Okay. Javier saying hi. Hi, Javier.
00:45:19.438 - 00:45:55.710, Speaker A: Jose greeting, then Turkey. Nick saying, what do you think about tokenization of real estate or even tokenizing ownership on one's future income, like future athlete that need equipment and preparation. Okay, there are two different questions. So tokenization of real estate. Yeah, I think this is great. Actually. This is very relevant to me because I start to do some research about real estate because, yeah, I'm a stage in my life where maybe I would like to invest in the near future.
00:45:55.710 - 00:46:34.860, Speaker A: And I was checking the transaction cost. And if you compare to financial markets, this is so ridiculous. Like in France, we have to pay something like all fees considered something like 7% if it's like old houses, maybe 5% for new houses. So yeah, this is just 7%. That means if you invest hundreds of thousands of dollars, 7%. That means just to break even, you need to wait probably at least two years easy. So I think there are a lot of people who just take advantage of this system.
00:46:34.860 - 00:47:08.742, Speaker A: Too much friction here. So if blockchain can improve this, I know that the real tea on blockchain, I think they're on Ethereum is trying to do this. But the big issue we're going to face is basically we need a legal framework that recognize your ownership based on the blockchain. So I think it will come. I think for that we'll have a private blockchain. I don't think we'll have a public blockchain. I think we'll have a private one because there is also some privacy issue.
00:47:08.742 - 00:47:42.378, Speaker A: So I don't think authorities will be comfortable to put this on the public blockchain. Also, I think it's going to be implemented differently in each country. But yeah, I do think at some point we will see ownership will be moved to blockchain and then we can have way cheaper cost of transaction. Yes. And then the second question, like tokenizing your future income, I think. So you're talking of personal token. I have a video about this if you are interested.
00:47:42.378 - 00:48:18.890, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is super cool. We haven't seen much in this. There was just this guy, Alex, I think it's a french guy actually, who did this in San Francisco. He tokenized himself and then he promised to pay out his future income. But apart from this, we haven't seen much potential. But I think that's the kind of thing that can really make a lot of buz on social media. I could totally see media going so crazy about this, especially in this context of cris where it's just hard to find jobs, hard to make some income.
00:48:18.890 - 00:49:15.342, Speaker A: Government needs to be a little bit more open minded and let people be more creative, but unfortunately they do exactly the country. If they are unable to solve the solution, then they need to admit their lack of competency and just say, okay, well, I mean, why not accept that kind of creative solution? So yeah, I'm super excited about this. Like personal income, personal token Jose saying, do you hear about impermanent? Gain. It will work like an option. You pay a premium to protect from impermanent loss. So I know that there are some projects who are trying to solve impermanent loss, but I wasn't aware of this expression, impermanent gain. Do you know of any project who invented this expression? Yeah, I'd be curious about this.
00:49:15.342 - 00:49:42.150, Speaker A: Sergey is saying, question. There is a sense to develop arbitrage smart. Okay. Does it make sense to develop arbitrage smart contract at this time, will it be compatible with Ethereum 2.0? Yeah, so it's never too late to try to do some arbitrage. So that's what we do on my course on flash loan. Is it compatible with Ethereum 2.0?
00:49:42.150 - 00:50:32.666, Speaker A: Well, most likely, yes, because Ethereum 2.0 will do everything they can to be backward compatible with Ethereum 1.0. We don't know exactly for sure, but just I can tell you, in general, as a developer, most project, they try to stay backward compatible because it'd be such a mess if there is this huge split between Ethereum one and Ethereum two. Actually, Ethereum one will become one of the shots in Ethereum 2.0. So I think it requires that there is backward compatibility. Yeah. Okay, so, Gary, sentence.
00:50:32.666 - 00:51:07.458, Speaker A: I believe that crypto exchanges want to position themselves for CDBCo. You mean like the sort of government blockchain? And that's why they have been applying to become banks. What do you think I haven't done enough research about this? I need more research about this. But, yeah, maybe not all exchanges want to do this, but maybe the bigger one, like Coinbase, for example. Yeah, I think for the really gig sense. Yeah, I think they might be able to become bank. Yeah, totally possible.
00:51:07.458 - 00:52:06.318, Speaker A: Like the smaller one or the one that seems a little bit less legit. I don't think so. Crypto era said, which crypto do you invest in? Ethereum. Ethereum. And I also have some stable coin in some lending protocol, like I have some tether in compound, but nothing too exciting. But yeah, I think now I want to start to invest more and maybe be more a little bit systematic, like maybe every month, invest maybe 10% still very conservative, maybe like 10% of my income and maybe like 5% in rock solid crypto, like ETH or bitcoin and the rest in more speculative thing and keep doing this every month. But I would be a holder.
00:52:06.318 - 00:52:29.100, Speaker A: I wouldn't be a trader. I would just keep the crypto for a long time. Except for the really risky one. The really risky one, like the moon and then I'll be down to sell them right away. But ETH and bitcoin, I'm a holder for years, four years. I don't care if there is like a huge crash, I just keep it. I keep it.
00:52:29.100 - 00:53:07.910, Speaker A: But one thing which is super important is you shouldn't invest too much of your income or of your personal asset, because otherwise you start to become really emotional and then you start to check the price every day and you start to make really bad decision. Like me for example, if I just invest 10% of my monthly income. If bitcoin or ether crash, well, it's a bit annoying, but it's not the end of the world. But if you start to put everything, you're going to be too emotional. So that's the big mistake. Right? Art Jean saying, great content, man. Thank you.
00:53:07.910 - 00:53:18.554, Speaker A: I've been following your tutorials and video for a while now. Please don't stop. There is not much content like yours on YouTube. Oh man. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Yeah, it means a lot to me.
00:53:18.554 - 00:54:14.990, Speaker A: Yeah, this is really a lot of work and I appreciate it. Yeah. Then wakas Wahid saying, what is best, ether js or web JS? What defi stack is best? Before I used to use web three and now I start to use Ether js more and more because I think the API makes a little bit more sense. But really I don't think it matters so much. You can be a good blockchain developer by using either of them, really, it's just a matter of personal preference. As for the rest, yeah, use Javascript, react, bootstrap, truffle, open zeppelin, the really, really classic stuff. I don't use typescript, I like to keep it simple.
00:54:14.990 - 00:55:18.162, Speaker A: Yeah, Josie, Josie is saying, where will go the proof of work? Miners of ETH 1.0 when proof of work ends well, they will just get rid of the old machine and they will become staker. Actually, a lot of the current miners, they staked for Ethereum 2.0. It's like in every industry, technology evolves. So when they made their investment for the current mining machine, they knew that it wouldn't be forever and they made a lot of money, especially at the beginning. They probably huddled a lot of ether and yeah, now they're just going to scrape their old machine and become staker. I'm not sure exactly how they're going to run their validator nodes because the whole point of Ethereum 2.0
00:55:18.162 - 00:55:46.138, Speaker A: with proof of stake is that everybody can run a validator node. You don't need any specialized hardware. So we will see if in the future we'll see some specialized hardware coming up for Ethereum 2.0. We'll see Nana then. Abracadabra. Question for Julian. What do you think about proof of work after Ethereum 2.0
00:55:46.138 - 00:56:48.720, Speaker A: and end of BTC mining already? Yeah, I think I kind of answered the same question before for Josie Negus Tech. Question for Julian. For a blockchain developer, who should one follow in Twitter? You should follow me. That's it. Only Vitalik buttering. Who else? Who else? There's this guy of bankless, sort of defi newsletter. Who else? There is? Yeah, maybe you can follow the CEO of Truffle like this guy.
00:56:48.720 - 00:57:13.590, Speaker A: Who else? But to be honest, I'm not on Twitter very much. Yeah, I know. It can just take you so much time to be like, to follow all the conversation. Yeah, I'm not a Twitter guy, Gary Sente. This channel has helped me to get started on blockchain development. Thank you. Yeah, thanks, Gary.
00:57:13.590 - 00:57:30.858, Speaker A: Abracadabra. Negus tech traitor. We are all gel maximalists here. Yeah. Okay, turkey neck. Thank you for the content. It's awesome.
00:57:30.858 - 00:57:44.066, Speaker A: Hey, thank you, Turkey Davian. Thanks for everything, Julian. Been a developer for a long time. A new video inspired me to pick up solidity. I'm now the lead developer for. Cool, cool. Awesome.
00:57:44.066 - 00:58:40.558, Speaker A: I'm really happy to hear it. Yeah, it's cool. Yeah. And if some of you want to talk about your personal project sometime, I accept a personal interview on my channel. So if you're working on a project you want to talk about it, you can send me an email. I cannot guarantee that I accept everyone, but yeah, sometimes I see that some people work for some blockchain project here. Gary Sante, so what happened to the NFT id you mentioned before? Do you mean which nft id you mean to create a voting system for the content of ewlocks? Is that what you mean? Yeah, I mean this one I haven't forgotten.
00:58:40.558 - 00:59:13.120, Speaker A: But yeah, right now I'm not focused on that. Right now I'm focused on the course on Defi and Batman saying mining is far from dead. Actually, miners had the Eth two id. Very few of us see the benefit as you can easily make those gains with ETH movement. Yeah, my mining is far from dead. And for bitcoin, it will continue for a lot of time, that's for sure. Okay, guys, well, I see no more questions coming, so I think we'll wrap it up.
00:59:13.120 - 00:59:33.090, Speaker A: Yeah, that was great. A lot of people today. Sorry for the mess up at the beginning, the mic problem. There is just so many technical problem that can happen with live stream that you guys have no idea. You think this is simple, but everything can break. Like Internet connection. My camera.
00:59:33.090 - 00:59:50.060, Speaker A: But this is life. This is life. Yeah. Okay, guys, well, we're going to wrap it up. Thanks for coming here and I'll see you later this week. I'll probably do another live stream him. I'll tell you by email.
00:59:50.060 - 00:59:54.598, Speaker A: Have a good week and I'll see you later. Yeah, see you guys. Bye.
