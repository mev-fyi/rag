00:00:00.410 - 00:00:25.842, Speaker A: Hi, guys. Today we are doing an interview of Federico of Liquidity Folio, formerly known as Uniswap Roi, which is a tool to manage your investment in DeFi. Federico is a very prolific builder in the DeFi space. He has built multiple projects and is here to tell us his story. He already came to the channel, and so today he's going to give us an update on all of his projects. Welcome, Federico.
00:00:25.906 - 00:00:27.686, Speaker B: Hey, Julian, thanks for having me.
00:00:27.788 - 00:00:46.058, Speaker A: So last time we spoke, you were still working on Unisoft RoI. I think we last spoke maybe one year ago and you were doing all the tools. I think you were doing a tool on compound at some point and your business was growing. And so now it seems like you decided to merge together your different project.
00:00:46.224 - 00:01:09.630, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So this is a little bit of a 2.0 interview. I mean, we had the first one a year ago. During the course of a year, DFI grew a lot, probably 20 x or 40 x, something crazy like that. So as you mentioned, I built before I started with DFI a couple of years ago, really building something. And then I built a few projects.
00:01:09.630 - 00:01:42.030, Speaker B: The one that was definitely growing the most was Uniswari. So really kind of kept investing there and then building it out. And now, yes, the tool has been growing a lot, given the increase in the liquidity, the number of investors, number of participants in DeFi. So it's been steadily growing. And also the tool has been keeping expanding. It used to be a tracking tool. Now it does a lot of more on the insides, help people with the allocation.
00:01:42.030 - 00:02:19.846, Speaker B: And also more recently, there is this new layer, two aspects, matic and quickswap and binance marching. It's expanding also there as well. Maybe I can give the users just a quick glimpse of what the tool is. So this is liquidity folio. We are in a user account. Essentially the tool allows you to first track your liquidity pools portfolio. And so you can track the variation of the liquidity you have, but also how much you're earning, the fees and liquidity mining.
00:02:19.846 - 00:03:06.258, Speaker B: And basically, if you have multiple addresses, you can zoom in, you can see the different pools, you can see what level of data you really want in order to understand what's happening to your liquidity. And then the other thing you can have views of, summary views. So, for example, you can see, okay, here is how much this user has. About four hundred k of liquidity is earning about $500 a day across all these positions. So you can stay on top of how much you're earning. And then if you still have to invest or you want to invest more liquidity, then you have kind of a catalog on this section called pools. You have a catalog of all the pools available across uniswap curve balancer.
00:03:06.258 - 00:03:36.962, Speaker B: So basically all the sushi swap, all the biggest layer one exchanges, and also a few other, as we said, on L2. So you can really understand where to move, maybe next investment, where it makes more sense in terms of the income that you're able to generate. And yeah, plus a bunch of other features, the allocator optimization and so on and so forth. But this is kind of broadly speaking, why people use the tool and kind of the main use case.
00:03:37.016 - 00:04:05.270, Speaker A: I'm really impressed because last time I checked, when Uniswap ROI, it was good. But clearly liquidity folio graphically in terms of the UX, is really one level above. So yeah, congrats. That's really a big improvement. And so I'm trying to understand who would use this tool. One of the most specific investment you can do in Defi is by investing in yon finance, for example, that does all the optimization for you. But it seems like people would use your tool are maybe a little bit more active.
00:04:05.270 - 00:04:12.350, Speaker A: They want to do the reallocation themselves. So basically you are your own yearn finance in this case, right?
00:04:12.420 - 00:04:49.002, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And there is different category of people. Some people want to have a quote unquote money manager similar to your finance with the strategies, which is also pretty expensive. I mean, it has a cost, obviously, like the 220 model they have. But some other people, they really want to have custody of the funds, especially who has a bigger amount of capital. They prefer to have custody and really to decide where the capital should go. But that's a lot of really preference, and that's a reason.
00:04:49.002 - 00:05:39.366, Speaker B: And the other reason may also be that, for example, things like urine finance, they automatically dump, in a sense, or they buy, they convert the liquidity mining tokens. As soon as they are received, they get swapped. Some people, they actually want to have positions in sushi or CRv, or they actually want to held this token. And so it's just easier for them to manage. The architecture of their liquidity is a little more flexible. It's going to be very interesting with users of V three, what happens, because it's going to be much less, in a sense, much less passive. And so more and more people will need to either become a little more active or again, there will be more providers of strategies and management, I guess.
00:05:39.468 - 00:05:43.818, Speaker A: Okay, that's interesting, because you see Uniswap V three as a big opportunity for you, too.
00:05:43.904 - 00:07:08.920, Speaker B: I think so, because, well, I guess what's happening with Uniswap V three, also, like balancer, there's a new version, V two, I guess, coming out is that these protocols are moving, in a sense, a little more away from the application layer and more heavily into the protocol layer. And so basically what that means is that, for example, Unisop will be more and more a base protocol for the liquidity, rather than, at least for now, like a way to do the management, to give an example, like in the unison v three, the people will not just pull the liquidity into one pool, but they will have to decide how much liquidity per tick of price they want to allocate. What is the minimum tick, the maximum tick. So there's a number of parameters that will need adjusting. And so the question is, if I'm a passive investor that used to invest in units of v two, can I still expect to invest as passively and get the same return? Or should I either become more active, or at that point, if I don't want to be more active, either use something like liquidity folio that manages the liquidity for me, or even something like vault type, similar to urine. So I guess that's kind of what's happening. We'll need to see how exactly this play out is still a little uncertain, but I guess the complexity is going up.
00:07:08.920 - 00:07:10.438, Speaker B: That's the idea.
00:07:10.604 - 00:07:28.394, Speaker A: And you mentioned one thing that you say, generally, people who use your tool are people who have a little bit more capital. So I wonder from which amount of money it would make sense to use your tool. And second, what is the optimal reallocation frequency? Right.
00:07:28.432 - 00:08:13.740, Speaker B: That's a great question. So, in terms of using the tool, I think there are users of all sizes, actually, as you can imagine in defi, still, there is a long tail, and I would say still 90% of the user in number are very retail, maybe a few hundred dollars, a few thousand dollars, but that's kind of a small size. And there is a bunch of group of users that obviously have a lot more capital. Everybody really can invest in pools. And that's also the beauty of it. You don't need a lot of money. Like, you can invest $100 into a liquidity pool or $1,000, and then if you want, you can use liquidity poly to track and see how it's going, whether it's making money or not.
00:08:13.740 - 00:09:25.310, Speaker B: And then, obviously, if you have smaller capital, the percentage of gas that you'll need to do the allocation is higher and so maybe it makes more sense to let it run. But I would say in general, as it stands today, liquidity pools, they don't need to be reallocated too often. So even something like maybe weekly or biweekly, like taking most people, I would say they come to the tool and they take a look, and maybe every couple of weeks they decide, okay, so maybe here, this other allocation would make more money also because it's worth giving it some time to make averages versus going toward a peak. Maybe there was a spike in volume. The fees are very high on a certain pool, but it's not sustainable. Versus if you give some days, if volumes are shifting and fees are shifting, then it makes sense to change. So it's almost the opposite to programmatic trading, where you do a lot of obviously, like super high frequency stuff with liquidity pools is typically right now, pretty passive.
00:09:25.310 - 00:09:29.410, Speaker B: Maybe once a week or two, once a month type of allocation.
00:09:29.750 - 00:10:00.460, Speaker A: Okay, so yeah, you don't have to be this super active investor who just rebalance every day, because otherwise you need to be like this big. Well, I like to talk a little bit about your experience as a defi builder. So I understand that you are a developer, and so you coded most of at least uniswap roi. I don't know about liquidity folio. So how was the experience of building everything by yourself? Did you have to hire people or did you just did everything?
00:10:01.630 - 00:10:46.410, Speaker B: I mean, to date, really, liquidity folio, I've been building it myself at my own pace. This came after building and selling another company. So I had some time and didn't have a lot of pressure to necessarily run too fast or I could adapt with the speed of the changing market in a sense. So I've been building it myself. And yeah, it's been great to build something in a market that is growing so fast. So I guess also your audience of people like learning the blockchain. It's a great moment.
00:10:46.410 - 00:11:02.800, Speaker B: It's probably still going to be a great moment in months, in the years to come to build products, because there is already a lot. But the amount of users that are coming into defi is also huge.
00:11:03.250 - 00:11:13.570, Speaker A: I wonder. Okay, so you coded most of it, but for the design, because I can see the ux of liquid folder looks really like, professional. Did you hire some designer to do something or you did everything yourself?
00:11:13.720 - 00:11:49.146, Speaker B: No, I did it myself. To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not maybe too creative. And so I copy a lot whenever I see something that I like, even in other places, I just maybe remind myself when I need something, I can take inspiration here and there. It's a lot of also inspiration from other places. But yeah, compared to uniswapperi, that was way more basic. And now this version is a lot more, I would say, to operate.
00:11:49.258 - 00:12:04.900, Speaker A: Sometimes we meet developers like you that are good not only in coding, but also in design. Man, I hate it when it happens. I prefer to meet a developer who tell me, oh yeah, I suck at design, so at least I can relate. But you have everything.
00:12:06.790 - 00:12:16.534, Speaker B: Serious people that probably are very strong in one thing. I tend to do all the different fronts, but maybe not as strong.
00:12:16.652 - 00:12:23.702, Speaker A: That was for the coding, but what about to acquire users? Because it just seems like you let the tools grow organically.
00:12:23.846 - 00:13:06.658, Speaker B: Yeah, that's interesting. The growth of the tool has been completely organic. The only maybe trick and also why that kind of accommodates us is the I started when I launched Uniswap, that was my first experiment with YouTube. Never had a YouTube channel, but I started talking about Uniswap and talking about the tool, how to use the tool. That was almost two years ago on YouTube, on a small channel. Now the channel also grew. It's not as big as either blocks, but has a very, I would say, pretty strong community of liquidity providers.
00:13:06.658 - 00:13:42.542, Speaker B: It's very specialized in liquidity providers. And I think a lot of the traffic to liquidifolio also come from YouTube. It's sort of a circle. And within liquidity folio, I also make sure that there is a section called content. And every time I publish a new video on YouTube, inside to the user of the glypholi, there is a red light on the content. I try to create a sort of a cycle between the software, the media, maybe people then subscribe or share. So that's one channel, the other channel, definitely Twitter.
00:13:42.542 - 00:14:25.380, Speaker B: So for people that may want to consider launches of defi crypto, Twitter is probably where the action is. And again, it's a little bit of a cycle. So people use the tool, maybe they subscribe or they start following. And then again, the other thing is really collaboration with other projects. I mean, liquidifolio lends itself to collaborate with balancer and quickswap, and even all these new exchanges. And so when, for example, there is one integration, there's some new feature with curve, typically also the protocol that the main. Right, the main other project are happy to share it, to retweet it.
00:14:25.380 - 00:15:00.862, Speaker B: That's another sort of hack. I think it's a way more robust way to grow things compared to traditional marketing. Even if I guess in Defi, really traditional market doesn't really exist. I would say options if you want to go. Maybe people that raising money, they have a little more budget, things to consider are definitely hackathons. So people sponsor hackathons, sponsor channels or content like for example the defiant or newsletters, they typically also take sponsorship. So that's something I also want to consider.
00:15:00.862 - 00:15:09.934, Speaker B: But yeah, so crypto find a way to almost reinvent also the way you do distribution. And that's very cool.
00:15:10.052 - 00:15:26.718, Speaker A: That's very impressive. You've built your thing on your own. It took some time, but it grew little by little. And now it really start to be at a nice level. And I'm wondering in the future, are you thinking of hiring people and are you interested in getting investors?
00:15:26.814 - 00:15:58.462, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll see. I mean, there is a lot of movement and a lot of sometimes requests for maybe invest. We'll see. Exactly. I think also in terms of the strategy right now, liquidity folio is a data play and analytics play. So yes, it's in web free and d five, but it's very much in the analytics with the analytics angle. And then I think the question is even what we said about units of b two and balance of unions of b three.
00:15:58.462 - 00:16:40.714, Speaker B: And so all these new versions coming out which require maybe a more active management, how to bring liquidity fall not just in the data aspect but also into the investing, the management of liquidity. And so if that's the direction, then there is a lot more smart contracts and integrations and things to build there security. And so definitely on that direction, there will need some help and maybe some investment to develop that front. So really depending on where we go from there in that direction, I think it will change.
00:16:40.912 - 00:17:10.866, Speaker A: And I was also thinking, so you're not the only tool that helped Defi investors. So there are also this other thing like this sort of defi dashboard, like Xerion. But it seems like you are much more focused on liquidity providers. You don't try to cover every DeFi protocol, you just cover a few of them, but you do it really well and with the mindset of really making money as a liquidity provider. So I understand that's like your positioning.
00:17:10.978 - 00:18:25.854, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly what it is. The way I see it is even in the current positioning of analytics tools and data, there are like horizontal platforms that are very strong. And by the way, I use them and my user also use them. So Zyrian Zapper, they cover everything and they do it pretty well. They give you the balance of your address the account, and they're free, by the way, all these tools are free, so everybody is using them. Liquidity folio, to some extent is a little bit competitive, but it's actually not really because, as I said, user interchangeably use one or the other, plus liquidity folio when they provide liquidity, because it just does the liquidity pools, but it tries to do it very in depth in terms of tracking, but also in terms of optimization, helping you in the decision making. On top of that, there are also paid versions that especially larger investors are happy to get into to have more visibility and data and so on.
00:18:25.854 - 00:19:00.178, Speaker B: So I think even if people want to build new products, this is an example for the data and the analytics, but even more into quote unquote financial products, defi smart contract, probably there is still space to carve out niches or carve out positioning that, yes, may in a sense compete with the bigger protocols, but they actually go and satisfy a specific need or a specific angle. And I think there is a lot of space to do that still.
00:19:00.284 - 00:19:42.998, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. And so I have an advice to ask you. So I have some ether, and I was thinking, okay, well, my ether is sleeping now, so maybe I could be a liquidity provider on, I don't know, maybe uniswap and use your tool. But the thing is, I don't really want to get an exposure on something else. So let's say I want to invest like 10,000 ether as a liquidity provider. So that means I would need to, for example, sell half my ether into die and then 50 50, invest this in uniswap as a liquidity provider. But if I do this, I also lose exposure to 50% of my ether, right?
00:19:43.084 - 00:20:36.920, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say if that's the concern, curve is probably a very good option. Maybe I can show you quickly. But the idea, like, for example, I'm here in this pool section, and I see curve. Now, basically the idea with curve is that, yes, you have pools, but you can have pools on only one asset, right? So, for example, if we search just ethereum, as you said, so these can be essentially pools where. Anyway, so we find pools that only have ethereum. So, for example, if you invest in there is the staked ether pool, and that is giving you 10%. I mean, ten to 20%, depending if you boost your yield with curb the synthetic ether, give you 14%.
00:20:36.920 - 00:21:04.146, Speaker B: And that's just with ether. You can do the same with, for example, if you want exposure to bitcoin, there are also pools with exposure only to bitcoin. So for example, you don't have to have dollars, you can do just that. And this can be a way, like for example, if you don't want to change sum into dollars, that can be an option and still giving you some.
00:21:04.168 - 00:21:23.574, Speaker A: Pretty nice. Okay, that's super interesting. I haven't thought about this. And if you do this, the fact that the market is going to be less volatile compared to if it was like Ether versus dai. So does it also mean that my APR is going to be lower?
00:21:23.692 - 00:21:52.254, Speaker B: Right, yes or no meaning right now you can see here. So basically, if you consider these pools with ether, essentially the ROI is made into two components. One is the fee. And right now the fee is pretty small, right. So we're talking 30 days for the staked. Ether is zero point 35%. But then a lot of the return is actually coming from liquidity mining right now.
00:21:52.254 - 00:22:33.582, Speaker B: So the minting of CRB. So as of today, it doesn't make a huge difference in terms of the volumes. Also, because at the end of the day, yes, there is no volatility because the pair is obviously spec one to each other. But that's the idea of curves. So really concentrate all the volumes of people that want to go from ether to stake eater or from ether to synthetic eater, right. So condensate all this volume there and apply the fee. Even if it's not almost like the pairs of curve, they don't require volatility to have demand for them in a sense.
00:22:33.582 - 00:22:33.950, Speaker B: Right.
00:22:34.020 - 00:22:57.474, Speaker A: Okay. Wow. Super interesting. I really haven't thought about. I mean, I'm glad I get to talk to an expert. If there is one guy in Defi who knows how to optimize your yield as a liquidity provider, it's you. So if you guys are interested in being a liquidity provider, definitely check out Nikwi tufolio.
00:22:57.474 - 00:23:10.482, Speaker A: I'll put the link in the description. I'll also put your Twitter below. Well, thank you Federico. That was super interesting, super inspiring also for a lot of defi builder on my channel. Yeah, thanks Federico.
00:23:10.546 - 00:23:12.022, Speaker B: Fantastic. Thanks for having me.
00:23:12.076 - 00:23:14.694, Speaker A: And then good luck with liquidity folio. I talk to you soon.
00:23:14.732 - 00:23:15.826, Speaker B: Thank you, bye.
