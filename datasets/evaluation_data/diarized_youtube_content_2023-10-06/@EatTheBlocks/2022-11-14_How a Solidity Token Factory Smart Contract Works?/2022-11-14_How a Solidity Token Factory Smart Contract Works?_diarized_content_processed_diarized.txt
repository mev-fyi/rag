00:00:00.250 - 00:00:33.202, Speaker A: Let's take a look at how a solidity token factory smart contract works. Okay, so here we have some code. We're using the MIT license and the latest version of solidity, and then we're importing the open Zeppelin library for the ERC 20 token. And then we go on to our first contract, the token contract. We're passing in a name, a ticker symbol, and a circulating supply. Circulating supply will be sent to the person that calls this function. So when the token is deployed, the circulating supply gets minted and sent to the person that deployed the contract.
00:00:33.202 - 00:01:03.726, Speaker A: They will effectively own all the tokens. Now we can just copy this code into remix and deploy that token straight from there. But if we go back to the code, we've got a second contract here, a factory contract, and the job of a factory contract is to deploy code from within the smart contract itself. So we're going to deploy the token contract from the factory contract. So let's go ahead and see how this works. So we've got an array of addresses and a token count and an event at the top. Now we've got a deploy token function, and this is available to anyone, it's a public function.
00:01:03.726 - 00:01:49.914, Speaker A: We're passing in a name ticker symbol and supply again, and it returns the address, the address of the token that we're about to mint. We then go ahead and create a new token using this contract here, or the ABI for this contract. Then we're going to transfer the entire supply to the person, to the end user that called this function. The reason for this is because the factory contract is actually deploying the token. It means that the contract itself owns all the tokens because the contract is message sender. So that's getting sent the total supply of that token, and we then need to transfer them out to the end user. We then push the token address to the array, increase the count, and emit the token deployed event, finally returning the token contract address to the user.
00:01:49.914 - 00:02:02.910, Speaker A: In effect, we've created a factory contract which is able to go live on the Ethereum main net somewhere and run off ERC 20 compatible tokens for anyone that wants one using just a name, a ticker symbol and a total supply.
