00:00:00.250 - 00:00:44.434, Speaker A: Solidity events are confusing. We already have many other data variables so why would it events events are useful if you need to record data on the blockchain, but you only need to consume this data from outside the blockchain. The advantage is that it's cheaper compared to a variable in a smart contract. For example, an ERC 20 token emits a transfer event when a transfer takes place. To use an event there are three steps. First you need to declare the event type in solidity, then in a function of your smart contract you emit an event. And finally in your application you listen to these events using libraries like Webstery or ethers Js and if you want to go even deeper in your knowledge of Webstery and become a professional Webstery developer, check out my Webstery bootcamp.
