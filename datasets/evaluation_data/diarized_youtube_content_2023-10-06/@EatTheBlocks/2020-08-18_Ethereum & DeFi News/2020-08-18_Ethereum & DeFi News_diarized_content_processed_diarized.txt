00:00:49.370 - 00:01:25.074, Speaker A: Guys, finally getting started, there was a little bit of setup. This is the first time I do the streaming that way. Super happy to try this with you. So for this first live stream, I like to cover a little bit the news of Ethereum and Defi, see what happened in the past few weeks. And also we'll do a surprise tutorial at the end. So hello everybody. Fishnew, Madhuka, Rami, crypto dog trader.
00:01:25.074 - 00:02:04.202, Speaker A: Then there are many others. So first we'll start with the news. So I'm going to cover different Ethereum newsletter that I follow and going to tell you what matters, what doesn't. So I'm going to stop sharing my face and I'm going to show my screen instead. And now you can see my screen. Okay, so. Oh yeah, someone said, just got the class yesterday, but start learning today.
00:02:04.202 - 00:02:25.726, Speaker A: Antonio Arnold. Yeah, I saw that. Welcome, Antonio. So we're going to start with the week in Ethereum. So that's one of the oldest, I think the oldest newsletter on Ethereum and that's my favorite one. It's very comprehensive. It cover Ethereum stuff for developer layout too.
00:02:25.726 - 00:03:02.410, Speaker A: This is actually a bit overwhelming so you're not expected to follow everything which is in this newsletter because it's a little bit too much. But we're going to see what's important. Okay, so here, Ethereum one eth one, that's basically the current protocol. So even though we're constantly talking about Ethereum 2.0, actually there's still some development ongoing on Ethereum one. So it's not always the most exciting, but sometimes it matters. Let me go over this quickly.
00:03:02.410 - 00:03:34.600, Speaker A: Netamine, blah blah, memory usage. Yeah, so this is netamine. This is an Ethereum client written in C sharp. But as blockchain developer we don't use it directly. Binary triformat. What is this super technical? This is more like for blockchain core developer ether two, prismatic client update. Okay, so prismatic is something interesting because they are one of the leader who are implementing Ethereum 2.0.
00:03:34.600 - 00:04:07.162, Speaker A: So on their blog and on the communication in general, you can get a lot of info about what's coming in east 2.0. I believe that recently someone in the East 2.0 team said that maybe the first testnet would start in six months. A stable test net will be in six months or something like this. So that's cool. But as blockchain developer, it doesn't concern urge directly. It's more like something you check out out of curiosity.
00:04:07.162 - 00:04:34.940, Speaker A: But it won't change radically the way we develop blockchain application and layer two. So there is actually a lot going on in layer two. So I don't know why we just have two links here. Yeah, so layer two, this is basically an alternative way of scaling. It's a 2.0. That's the way of scaling of the protocol. Layer two, that's the way of scaling of that kind of work with the current Ethereum and also with Ethereum 2.0,
00:04:34.940 - 00:05:09.794, Speaker A: it's kind of similar to Ethereum 2.0 in that it doesn't concern us directly, except that when we want to have a lot of user, it's going to be cool that it works. The problem with layer two is that you lose composability for Defi. That's very important. So I kind of follow layer two out of curiosity. But yeah, it doesn't really impact my daily workflow. And then my favorite section for Rick and Ethereum is stuff for developer.
00:05:09.794 - 00:05:40.720, Speaker A: That's what concern us the most. So let me see what we have here. Gelato automation protocol and ift likewid automate. Okay, so I think this is a sort of zapier, but for Ethereum. So zapier is this service where you can automate different stuff on the web. You can take the output of mailchimp and plug it into another service, into Google sheet, whatever. So there are some sort of.
00:05:40.720 - 00:06:24.682, Speaker A: This is like the same thing, but on Ethereum then Budler deploy. So Budler, this is a sort of alternative minimalist framework, alternative to truffle. So to develop spot contract. So this is a plugin for this framework. So actually, just after this review of the news, I'm going to do a short tutorial on Budler. So we're going to see this in more detail. Seth, this is also an alternative tool for developing smart contract that's been developed by the team of maker Dao.
00:06:24.682 - 00:06:42.420, Speaker A: And so apparently we can do some debugging with steps through. Cool. But I don't use Seth, debugging your transaction. We don't know this tool. Maybe it was to check it out. Build Ethereum dap on Python. Oh my God.
00:06:42.420 - 00:07:16.682, Speaker A: Recently I had a client for a coaching. He needed something to be done with Python and I broke my Python install. I'm so sad. I was trying Brownie. That's a framework for developing DAP, but using Python. And it asked us to install a tool that totally broke my Python install. So I probably need to wait a bit before I get back to Python talking about Python.
00:07:16.682 - 00:07:37.470, Speaker A: So there is Viper, which is an alternative programming language for spot contract. And it looks like Python. So if you're into Python, Viper might be cool. And they released this new version with some breaking change. Cool. I got to check it out. Actually, I might do a tutorial on Viper.
00:07:37.470 - 00:08:10.170, Speaker A: If you guys have any interest for Viper, let me know in the chat so I know what to do. Synth machine in three dts. This is a switch tutorial. Let's move on. Transaction fees on Ethereum in first half of 2020 exceeded 2019. Okay, let me see the graph. So I think this is super important because you can see we already exceeded the Ethereum fee of 2019.
00:08:10.170 - 00:08:55.646, Speaker A: So that's very important because the Ethereum fee also exceeded bitcoin, I believe in the past few weeks. So that really show that the protocol is really used. And I also show you that ether probably is very undervalued compared to bitcoin. If there is more usage on Ethereum, then ether from my opinion, should be higher than bitcoin. So that's very bullish for us. Ethereum believer Austin Griffin XMoon exchange what is this? Get your Reddit moon onto Mennet. Okay, so this is cool.
00:08:55.646 - 00:09:54.880, Speaker A: So the moon token, this is a token that was introduced by Reddit a couple of weeks ago that is on Ethereum. So that's very bullish for Ethereum to have a company like Reddit started to use Ethereum for their community. And so with this exchange, I believe the way it works is that you can transfer some x moon tokens. So probably these are some token that have collateralized with real moon token and you can transfer them on a layer two chain at either a very low cost or no cost at all. Probably before you trade on this, probably you need to lock your moon token on a spot contract as Austin Griffith built this exchange. That's pretty cool. That's the kind of side project that you could do for yourself.
00:09:54.880 - 00:10:24.726, Speaker A: Pretty cool. Oh yeah. Very important. Metamask v eight. So they released a new version and the key feature is a new kind of privacy control that is very fine grain. So before when you needed to approve a DAP to use your accounts, but that was all or nothing. But now you can select which account you want to approve for a specific DAP.
00:10:24.726 - 00:11:02.470, Speaker A: So that allow you to use some account for some Daps, some other daps, without letting this Dap know about the other account. So that's pretty cool. And other than that, I think they released also a new UI that is supposed to be more intuitive. They have a list of transactions also that show you the different type of transaction so that's more user friendly. Introducing web3 encryption. I don't know what this is. And yeah, like a ton of other stuff.
00:11:02.470 - 00:11:33.994, Speaker A: So I tried to install it. So I uninstalled my metamask, reinstall it, but it was still version seven. So maybe this is announced, but not released yet. But yeah, we got to check this because this is super important. Every user use metamask. Yeah, and as you know, if you've been studying blockchain, you know that metamask is a huge pain in the ass. Let me know in the chat what is really hard with metamask.
00:11:33.994 - 00:12:11.802, Speaker A: I want to know. So dao and standard. I don't follow Dao as much, but probably I should because I think this is becoming super important. We see more and more defi projects that start to have a Dao for their governance. So Tony docash a privacy solution, creating molok dao. Kyber dao. That means we'll see more governance going through this DAO application later.
00:12:11.802 - 00:12:46.946, Speaker A: So defi, so this is important. Synthetics launches binary option. So if you don't know what are binary option. So these are basically options where you have a fixed payout if a certain event happens. So you can say okay, well if ether is above $100, then I'm going to receive 50 die, otherwise I'm going to receive zero. So it's a different kind of payoff than a traditional option. So options already are quite advanced.
00:12:46.946 - 00:13:26.194, Speaker A: But binary option, this is even more advanced. So this is really for advanced trader then we have zero x matcha, Dex aggregator. So that's a decentralized exchange that is supposed to be easy to use. So yeah, they have a very simple user interface that you can use to search different markets. That is a Dex aggregator. So that means it will try to break down your order into different exchanges to find the best rates. So that's pretty cool.
00:13:26.194 - 00:13:52.006, Speaker A: And that's actually similar to another project called Paraswap. And I think that one inch also does this. So yeah, that's something that is very useful for trader. And then what else do we have? It's not easier to host on ipfs. The latest Uniswap front end. Oh yeah. So actually uniswap.
00:13:52.006 - 00:14:31.226, Speaker A: So I don't know if you guys remember in last year, but I think there was a scandal at some point. They blocked Iran, I think because of some regulation in the US. And there were some people who complained. But don't forget that Uniswap only controls the protocol, the spot contract, but the front end, you can always host your own front end for Uniswap or for any defi protocol. That's actually something that many people don't know. So for fun you could build an at native front end for Uniswap or any other framework and put it on ipfs or wherever you want. Let's scroll down.
00:14:31.226 - 00:15:03.150, Speaker A: Ogre V two. Yeah, ogre. So this is a protocol for doing bets. A bit similar to notice, I check the release note, but I didn't find anything groundbreaking. Let's scroll down. USDC hit 1 billion in circulation on ETh. So I think that tether is still by far the biggest stable coin.
00:15:03.150 - 00:15:47.234, Speaker A: But USDC is also getting bigger. So yeah, that's cool. Stablecoin getting really important on Defi and I think that's pretty much it on week in Ethereum. So I'm quickly going to go over two other newsletter, but they are much, much shorter and after we'll do our tutorial. So this week in DeFi, I also like this newsletter. So that's more focused on DeFi, a little bit less for developers directly, but that's also important as blockchain developer to follow what's happening in DeFi because right now that's really the main focus. So let me see what they say.
00:15:47.234 - 00:16:33.914, Speaker A: So probably we're going to see some similar news to week in Ethereum. Zero X launch mancha yes, we already saw that. Synthetics release binary option already saw that. Next is mutual releasing. I don't know what's this? The graph? Oh, this is important, the graph closing a 5 million investment. So the graph is an API for a service to easily create GraphQL API on Ethereum and they are really used by many Defi protocol who want to create an API but don't really want to put the work to do their own rest API. So you can very easily create your graphql API with the graph.
00:16:33.914 - 00:17:11.180, Speaker A: And so they are closing a big investment. So that's good news for Defi and probably that this guy going to be hiring. So if you're looking for a job, that might be a good hint. BZX releasing governance token detail okay, so well I guess a lot of Defi protocol now are copying what happened for comp token. So you're going to see maybe the same thing happening on BZX. However, maybe that users will be a little bit more careful because there was this big hack at the beginning of the year. So yeah, let's see how it plays out.
00:17:11.180 - 00:17:32.946, Speaker A: Curve release governance token and do detail. Okay, well I think we're going to see even more yield farming on curve. Launching a dao. Well, everybody is launching a DaO maker. Adding two more token can see and ZRX. So yeah, that's probably bullish. For the price of these two.
00:17:32.946 - 00:18:02.330, Speaker A: Collateral compound changes its comp token distribution model. Okay, so I read the article. So as you all probably know, yield farming was totally crazy. Recently a lot of people were sending their token to compound to accumulate this comp token. And the way it worked is it was given in proportion to the interest rate. So the higher the interest rate, the more comp token. And that caused some interest rate to go through the roof.
00:18:02.330 - 00:19:03.102, Speaker A: That was the case of bat token, for example. And that really made the system a little bit unsustainable and dangerous and so that we don't want to repeat the same mistake of the past. So compound governance took the decision to change the way they distribute their comb token. And so now instead of being distributed proportionally to the interest rate of the market, it will be distributed proportionally to the amount that you borrow or lend to in the protocol. So that will effectively reward more fairly the real user of the protocol that provide value. So after this, we saw already rates going down on compound and probably that yield farming on compound is going to decrease a little bit. But we have all these other protocols that are copying what compound has done.
00:19:03.102 - 00:19:32.418, Speaker A: So yield farming is probably going to continue for a while, but just on different protocol. Okay, so that's it for this week in Defi. Now quickly, let's go. By the way, guys, I'll check out the chat, but just after I finish all of this stuff. Recap D five week of June. So that's the defiant, another d five newsletter. I like it a lot.
00:19:32.418 - 00:20:02.100, Speaker A: So let's see what they have to say. There is now 100 million bitcoin secreting ethereum driven by wrap bitcoin that is used to do some farm yield. So I believe this is on curve. You can do some nice yield farming with wrap bitcoin. She also mentioned here that the curve decks really increased a lot. Its trading volume. I think now this is the second largest trading platform.
00:20:02.100 - 00:20:38.670, Speaker A: The success of curve is pretty amazing. Oh yeah. So there was an attack for balancer. So that's a DeFi protocol where you can create a pool with different allocation like be 20% this token, 30% this token, et cetera. And it's actually trader that pays to participate. Investor who pay to participate in the pool all the way around. Oh, I don't remember.
00:20:38.670 - 00:21:28.366, Speaker A: But there was something confusing about balancer. It was basically the contrary compared to a normal investment fund. And yeah, so a lot of people have been doing yield farming with bow token but unfortunately there was this big hack, so not good synthetics launch binary option. We already saw that zero x launch Mancha and the graph raised familiar. So you might think, okay, well that's a little bit redundant to read different newsletter. But no, because if you see the same info being quoted different time that really highlight the fact that this is a really important news. So it's important to know what's really important and what is less important.
00:21:28.366 - 00:22:32.050, Speaker A: Okay, so I think we are done with the newsletter. So now we're going to do a tutorial for buildler. So buildler, this is an alternative framework for writing Ethereum spot contract and it is much more lightweight than truffle. So it appeals to different people, I guess. So we're going to try it out and see if it's easy. So let's go. So I'm going to show you my terminal for that's okay by the way, I'm going to show my face also.
00:22:32.050 - 00:23:14.750, Speaker A: I can do it. Okay, well I'm still a beginner with this live stream as you can tell. Okay, so the first thing we will do is we going to setting up a project. I'm reading the doc here. So we're going to execute NPX Butler and if you have Butler installed, it's going to use it, otherwise going to install it. So did it do anything? No, didn't do anything. Okay.
00:23:14.750 - 00:24:11.920, Speaker A: If you run NPX Biddler in the path without one, you'll be shown. Okay, so why you don't work Bibler, is it Bibbler unit in it command. Not fun. Why you don't work builder? Damn. I'm trying to figure out what's happening with builder you may have. Okay, let me ask in the chat, has anyone used builder before? Damn, I thought this thing would work. Okay, that's a good lifetime for doing an improvised tutorial.
00:24:11.920 - 00:24:51.420, Speaker A: Okay, well, guys, I think I will need a little bit more research for this builder thing because it's not as straightforward as I thought. I'm going to put back my face and we can chat a little bit. Okay. Yeah, I'm back online. Yeah. How's it going guys? So now let me go through the chat a little bit. Tom's crypto asks, hey, how can I start earning my first dollar in crypto? Building, exchange and collecting fear? What do you suggest? Yeah, well, that depends.
00:24:51.420 - 00:25:58.656, Speaker A: If you're a developer, you can earn money by either creating your project so you can create your project, you can be a sort of programmer trader by doing defi thing like liquidation, flash loan, et cetera. By the way, guys, I have a course on flash loan for those who want to learn this, so I'm going to put this in the chat. But it was basically, I released this a couple of weeks ago and it was a huge success. So the second way would be to do some things like Flash loan, for example, and you can learn this in this course. And the third thing will be to become a blockchain developer. So probably the fastest is to become a blockchain developer. It probably will take you a couple of months before you can start to learn this.
00:25:58.656 - 00:26:24.196, Speaker A: So, by the way, this is my other course if you want to become a blockchain developer. Okay, so, yeah, three way to earn money as a blockchain developer. Let me see the other question. Exactly. Viper tutorial. Yeah, some people are into Viper here. Do more video or more advanced contract installity.
00:26:24.196 - 00:26:52.384, Speaker A: Yeah, I can do that rattle 99 who tell me how to fix my problem with builder. Yeah, but. Okay, well, I thought I was like, I had to install it globally, so, yeah, I probably need to do more research on. Yeah, yeah, no problem. Tom scripto. Yeah, any other. What? Okay, well, I'm curious.
00:26:52.384 - 00:27:29.964, Speaker A: So I want to cover a lot of defi protocol, and I'm wondering which one you want me to cover first. So please let me know in the chat. What is the next crypto protocol that you want me to cover? Let me see. Okay, well, I'm thinking of. For one of my next one, I'm thinking of doing synthetics, because I think synthetics is really exciting. Hey, Richard. Hello.
00:27:29.964 - 00:27:44.828, Speaker A: Have a nice day. Hey, it would be great to learn how to build a stable coin. Oh, yeah, I've thought about that. Yeah. Thanks for reminding me. That's actually a really good idea. Yeah.
00:27:44.828 - 00:27:58.010, Speaker A: Well, you know what, DP Cheto? I might actually do it. Yeah. Thanks, guys. Really great. When I get some good idea opinion. Seems nice. Okay.
00:27:58.010 - 00:28:19.404, Speaker A: Yeah. I could consider this Nexus mutual. Nexus mutual. I think this is an investment fund. I don't think this is a DeFi project. I'm going to check it out, go more into detail about flash loan arbitrage. Yeah.
00:28:19.404 - 00:29:14.768, Speaker A: So in the course, I go into a lot of detail. We do an arbitrage on DYDX. We use DyDX flash loan, and we do an arbitrage between Kyber and uniswap. And so we do a monitoring script in a node js. And every time we find an arbitrage opportunity to create a transaction, send it to our flashloan spot contract, and we borrow tokens from DYDX, we do the arbitrage and we make a profit. And there will be a bonus on liquidation as well, because liquidation is also something that is really interesting, but somehow people are not as excited about liquidation. But I think this is a mistake because liquidation are probably actually most important.
00:29:14.768 - 00:29:38.660, Speaker A: Arbitrage from irogrey here. Hey, Gpchetto. Yeah, Nexus is a token. Okay, well, prudent my ignorance. Crypto is just moving too fast. You think you know everything, you follow the news and yeah, someone tells you about something super important. You should have known.
00:29:38.660 - 00:30:35.690, Speaker A: What about a quick startup video? How to create a business with a protocol? Okay, well, actually, yeah, I was thinking about this, like how to create your own defi project as an entrepreneur. But I was thinking about a course. Yeah, maybe it could be a video on YouTube. Are there any arbitrage aggregator does that even. No, no, because when someone fund an arbitrage, they will just use it. I think what could exist is maybe some sort of Dao that does some arbitrage, but I don't think we're going to see a tool that directly does arbitrage. Maybe they're going to be a tool that can help you to do an arbitrage, but maybe that will just be some part of the task, but not the whole thing.
00:30:35.690 - 00:31:11.830, Speaker A: Can you mentor me? I will be your young Jedi. Okay. Yeah, man. Yeah, I can mentor you some people sometime. Ask me some question by email. So I'm getting really busy, guys, so it's getting a bit difficult for me to answer to all the email. So if you have a task that you want to do, and it is important, then you can book 1 hour in private coaching with me.
00:31:11.830 - 00:31:45.368, Speaker A: So eat the blocks. Eat them blocks. Eat them up. Yeah. What is the scope for gambling in? Really? What I like about DeFi is not so much about gambling, it's more about how can you be smart, pay attention and combine your skills as a programmer who knows how to do smart contract. And yeah, take advantage of that. So yeah, I think that's what's really cool in Defi.
00:31:45.368 - 00:32:30.140, Speaker A: In avid token, the number of token changes directly in the wallet. How does this work in the Ave smart contract? I think I have to know more precisely the question, but I can tell you that the smart contract of AavE is on their repo, so it might not be too complicated to check out their code. Has anyone look at orfeed? Yeah, look at orfeed. It's a tool to help to do some defi arbitrage. That's cool. But I find it a little bit limited. I'll be interested in doing another version of feed, maybe a little bit more powerful.
00:32:30.140 - 00:32:59.428, Speaker A: I don't know any programming, but I would love to learn more about liquidating maker Dao. CDP vault. Okay. Yeah, rami. Well, as I was mentioning before, in my course, profitable flash loan, you'll find the link above in the course, in the bonus section, there is a bonus video on liquidation. I think we're going to use DyDX. So that's another kind of liquidation.
00:32:59.428 - 00:33:37.840, Speaker A: But what matters is that we do liquidation. It's not so important that it is on DYDX, mechodo or something else. If you don't know any programming, there is an extra training in this course for people who don't know any programming. So that can be something useful. How to search multiple pair. How to search for multiple pair and flash loan. You mean do arbitrage for multiple pair? Well, you can do what's called a triangular arbitrage, where you try to, like, if you have three different assets, ABC.
00:33:37.840 - 00:34:03.836, Speaker A: Then basically you can go from a to c by two a. So you can go directly if there is a market, AC, or you can also do from a to b and from b to c. And so based on that, you can have like a sort of more sophisticated arbitrage. Yeah, I'm paying $1,500 for a good boat. Wow. Well, it's good. It's working.
00:34:03.836 - 00:34:23.650, Speaker A: Yeah. Do we have some furocombo? Oh, yeah, I know. Fruit combo. They released a new feature to share your combo. Yeah, it's pretty cool. How about a tutorial on using oracles? Yeah, that's another good idea. Well, I think we got some pretty solid id here.
00:34:23.650 - 00:35:00.460, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, thanks, guy, for following up to here. I think we're going to wrap it up. Last question, is there any defi tool to help pay if you're a gas price in transaction? You have the gas station network, but I'm not sure this is exactly what you want. Yeah, guys, so we're going to wrap it up here. So, yeah, thanks for following. Think this live and let me know in the comment what you want me to cover for my next live stream, which defi protocol.
00:35:00.460 - 00:35:04.120, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great, guys. See you. See ya. Bye.
