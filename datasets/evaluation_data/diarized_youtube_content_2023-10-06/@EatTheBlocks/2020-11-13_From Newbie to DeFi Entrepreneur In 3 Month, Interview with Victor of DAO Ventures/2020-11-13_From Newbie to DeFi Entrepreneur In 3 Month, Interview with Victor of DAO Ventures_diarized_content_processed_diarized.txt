00:00:00.570 - 00:00:17.210, Speaker A: Hey, today I'm receiving Victor of Dao Ventures. So, Victor is a former student of mine. He took one of my course, and now he's building his own Defi project. So he's going to talk about Ezfi project, how he started to build it. Welcome, Victor.
00:00:17.290 - 00:00:25.142, Speaker B: Hey, Julian. Thanks for inviting me and be part of this good community with the blocks. It's my pleasure to be.
00:00:25.236 - 00:00:44.662, Speaker A: Actually, we were just chatting in the chat of my students, and you were mentioning that you were looking for developer. And then I saw the link of your project at a while at sun school. And so, yeah, I suggested we have this interview. So first tell us about what you are building. What is this thing? Dao Ventures.
00:00:44.806 - 00:01:14.690, Speaker B: Okay. In short, we are doing DeFi, or decentralized finance. Robo advisory and asset management tool. So you could imagine that as actually as Robinhood in the traditional fintech world, but specifically for Defi. Make Defi more available and accessible to more people, so that they are actually more comfortable in participating in DeFi growth and movement.
00:01:15.850 - 00:01:21.480, Speaker A: So, yeah, it sounds like a new flavor of yen finance, right?
00:01:21.850 - 00:02:03.342, Speaker B: Yep. So we are kind of like similar to yen finance, I think as any other asset manager protocol in Defi. We are actually one of the. Or we are actually considered one of their customer as well in DeFi, due to the composability nature of Defi. But yeah, whatever we are providing is similar to yin finance. The only differences is that we are actually trying to make ourselves a little bit more trusted and more secured, because we are actually based in Singapore and all the founders are actually from fintech technology and also in crypto for a long time. So that is actually one of the unique advantages.
00:02:03.342 - 00:02:04.306, Speaker B: And second one.
00:02:04.328 - 00:02:04.562, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:04.616 - 00:02:18.306, Speaker B: We're actually doing this in a way that we are putting our own money as mean Ian finance. We know that Andre is actually a really strong developer, and he actually started this because he really wanted to grow and innovate in the Defi.
00:02:18.338 - 00:02:18.630, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:18.700 - 00:02:28.806, Speaker B: So I think we are following his footsteps. We are doing the same. But the difference is that we want to target the southeast asian asian market, and we wanted to bring this to the mainstream for the crypto investors.
00:02:28.918 - 00:03:22.786, Speaker A: Okay, so I really like two things about your project. Like, first that you have a co founder from the fintech world, because I think they will be better for dealing with a regulatory issue. And I also like that you localize your project a lot, so you're going to do some very specific marketing, and it's always better to be specific as opposed to when you try to target the whole world, which is the big mistake of many projects. They want to be the next Google, the next Facebook, et cetera. But it never happened because you have to start somewhere. So, yeah, I really like. So in terms of the regulation, so currently in DeFi, we don't have too many regulations, but we start to see the SEC in the US start to be a little bit more angry and start to sue some crypto projects.
00:03:22.786 - 00:03:41.620, Speaker A: Okay, so currently the crypto projects they sued were a little bit shady, but maybe in the future they're going to start to go for DeFi. So are you guys already anticipating this? Especially you guys are based in Singapore, which is very active in the financial sector. So do you know how it's going to play out?
00:03:42.710 - 00:04:24.480, Speaker B: Yeah, that is a great question. So there are a few angles here, right. But the first thing that we wanted to shoot for is actually to be secured, trusted and compliance, even though despite we are being a DeFi. Right. We know that DeFi, a lot of interaction is actually with the smart contract. A lot of crypto and regulators actually understand about this. So I think if you were to do it right, most probably we will be working very closely with the authority, for example, mas in Singapore, to be working closely with them, with the lawyer and the association to actually bring in the compliance and regulation into the DeFi world.
00:04:24.480 - 00:04:59.206, Speaker B: That is actually one of the path that we need to do if you wanted to make this a real legitimate big company. But it's actually not new. Just to give an example why I say it's not new. For example, Aave, as we know they are based in the UK. Actually, Aave got an FCA license in UK as well. So of course the license is specifically for UK residents and for them to convert their fiat to crypto. But it shows that they are actually trying their best to actually be regulated, despite being a DeFi protocol.
00:04:59.206 - 00:05:41.194, Speaker B: So I think we are shooting the same direction. And I believe that DeFi is really new and this is natural if you wanted to be as good and as legit as possible, so that the mainstream investors will not be rug pool or be scammed. Right. I think being compliant and having all these kind of processes will create trust. And subsequently with this trust, more investors from traditional market, from finance market, from the bitcoin holders, and from even some other robot advisory in the region, they could potentially tap into DeFi. And that will create growth and trust in DeFi. So if you ask me, that is actually the bottleneck we need to break through.
00:05:41.232 - 00:05:44.460, Speaker A: So do you think at some point you will have some KYC on your product?
00:05:46.030 - 00:06:30.310, Speaker B: Good question. At the end of the day, something that we need to be aware of. But of course, that being said, any other crypto project is a startup, right? There is always a question about getting the product market fee, getting the right funding, getting the right growth, while balancing the requirements and needs so that you can continue to grow. I mean, let's use some example that actually we can refer to. I will not be surprised. You will say that in the beginning of fintech companies such as mean, when they started, they will have this problem as know the SEC or the regulators in us would like to actually be part of their process. But because they are small, nobody will say anything.
00:06:30.310 - 00:06:39.514, Speaker B: Right. But once you reach to a certain size, like binance or Binx, now you need to be careful about all these things that you're saying because you are one of the big players in the.
00:06:39.712 - 00:06:55.490, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And next, can you tell us a little bit about how you guys actually create yield for the investment? Like which protocol do you invest in and do you do the rebalancing for every transaction?
00:06:56.230 - 00:07:29.402, Speaker B: Okay. So actually that goes into our solution and our positioning and our product to our investors. Right. So make no mistake in DeFi, I think there are two, three main ingredients that a lot of non DeFi will not understand it, but I think you and me will understand it. The first one is actually non custodial. So in DeFi, right, in the traditional centralized finance, we are actually depositing our money to the exchanges wallet. So the responsibility and the capital actually stays with them.
00:07:29.402 - 00:07:34.906, Speaker B: If they get hacked or if they run away, your money is gone. You reduce that risk by being non custodial.
00:07:34.938 - 00:07:35.086, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:35.108 - 00:08:08.758, Speaker B: That's number one. And the second one, that is actually specifically for DeFi, which is actually composability. We know it. You can actually take a flash loan to do arbitraging, to do investment in different DeFi protocols, and then you can actually cycle the loop in the several times over as long as you complete it within the transaction or you pay the relevant gas fees. And all of these are automated. Right, because it's just interacting through the smart contract. But that is actually not something that the traditional investors or the centralized crypto investors actually are able to do, because it's about interacting with smart contract.
00:08:08.758 - 00:08:59.206, Speaker B: And the third part is actually because of the composability nature of DeFi and transparency of all these strategies. A lot of traditional finance will not understand this, right? But your winning strategy is meaningless in DeFi because all the strategies are just, you can see the contract and their strategies in the smart contract. So because of this, I think the best way for us to do is actually to copy whatever that is working in the market and we optimize it accordingly to our customers. So for example, we know that in the yen finance protocol, one of the best performing strategies that I have is called YCRV. Yvol. I mean, instead of me competing with them, what I'm going to do is I'm going to work with them. Why should I compete with a good player while we can just work together with them to invest together with them?
00:08:59.228 - 00:08:59.558, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:59.644 - 00:09:03.020, Speaker B: So we will become one of the investors into their protocol as well.
00:09:03.470 - 00:09:07.722, Speaker A: Okay, so it's very smart. So you basically use yarn finance as a back end.
00:09:07.856 - 00:09:41.960, Speaker B: Yes. So for a startup perspective, what did I say? Right. As we know, we do developer and we are doing smart contract. Every line of code requires dedication and look at the smart contract to ensure that there's no exploit or the way they write the code is make sure that no future hackers could actually arbitrage out the market maker formula. So what we are trying to do, we just copy whatever 80% work on the yen and we just customize it a little bit according to our need and then we are able to launch it to the main net.
00:09:43.050 - 00:10:18.834, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think this is something that many developers don't understand is it's different to just write code and to make it a product. So what you guys are doing, you are productizing an existing piece of code and that's really where you add a lot of the value. Because if you just write code, you publish it to GitHub and you hope that some vc is going to notice you and invest $1 million, then you're dreaming. It doesn't work like that. Yeah. So you got to make it into a product, get some traction, and then only then some investors are going to start to notice you.
00:10:18.834 - 00:10:36.360, Speaker A: Okay, I see it now. Can you talk a little bit of what was the process for you of getting in the blockchain? What made you interested in blockchain? When did you start and how did you learn to code?
00:10:37.870 - 00:11:11.566, Speaker B: Wow. I will try to make it as short as possible. That is actually kind of like, I think both our career. I've been delving into startups and technology since the pre mobile app days and my first project was actually creating a camera mobile app at the same time as Instagram in 2009. That was like 1112 years ago. Obviously we are just like venturing into creating new cool stuff that is on an iOS system and a mobile system in hope that we can make into a billion dollar startup.
00:11:11.598 - 00:11:11.794, Speaker A: Right?
00:11:11.832 - 00:11:43.694, Speaker B: But obviously I did not go into that part. But along the way I did my first startup, second startup, and of course Darventures is actually my third big startup that we're actually doing right now. So how do I delve into the blockchain smart contract? Initially I did not understand about bitcoin. The first blockchain project that I actually get into is actually ethereum. It's not bitcoin. I was not into finance. I do not even buy bitcoin five, six years ago.
00:11:43.694 - 00:12:15.122, Speaker B: So in 2016, actually, I was looking at one problem. The problem is actually how do we democratize an insurance industry? How do we make the insurance industry to be more transparent? Because of that, I was having a problem in search of a solution and I discovered blockchain. So I went to Ethereum, Defcon two in Shanghai. I met Vitalik and the early know. There's a surprising thing. When I was looking back right now, I did not even buy any ethereum then. I was looking at from a technology and product perspective.
00:12:15.122 - 00:13:08.114, Speaker B: I bought a mining machine instead because I was trying to understand how to connect to the Ethereum network and configure the gap node ecosystem so that I can understand the technology, right? So I'm kind of like the nerd product person, but I did not buy any of the Ethereum. Kind of like hindsight, it's kind of funny. But anyway, so that was the start of my experience into the blockchain, into understanding about the whole ecosystem of blockchain and Ethereum and ever. And of course smart contract. But as we know, right, in the last several years, the only application on smart contract is just ICO. That is the only thing, people create their own coin and launch it, right? And then you claim ownership of the token. But it's just that I think this year into 2020 is whereby the whole boom started, right? And actually that gives us, a lot of us developers actually understand the power of smart contract.
00:13:08.114 - 00:13:18.550, Speaker B: And that's how I decided that, hey, I need to go deep dive to really understand the coding aspect of it and start to do something with Ethereum smart contract development.
00:13:18.630 - 00:14:01.000, Speaker A: I think your journey in blockchain is quite typical. Like you've been into it for some time, but maybe from a high level perspective investor. And at some point when you decide to launch your own project and you realize that you don't have these coding skills and it's going to make it harder to launch your own project, except if you're willing to spend a lot of money, but that's not the best idea. And so that's really what motivates you to learn this is to build your own project. And so from the moment when you started to learn blockchain programming to the moment you were able to build your project vo venture, how long was that?
00:14:03.210 - 00:14:31.762, Speaker B: I still remember when we were chatting on your group chat and through email, I was interested to learn about your courses. Right, thanks for that, Julian. Your work and your courses are actually awesome. So it was like two to three months at most. That is how the duration is, and I'm not even spending 10 hours a day to learn the code. Right. So I'm just going through the tutorial and the process, which actually makes me appreciate the complexity of it.
00:14:31.762 - 00:15:17.938, Speaker B: And then what we need to do as a programmer and what the programmer are facing. Yeah, just a couple of months, I think I get a gist out of it and understand how the programming works for solidity and of course Javascript development. And also because of that I understand that solidity, smart contract or smart contract Ethereum is actually a very dumb application. It is so dumb that it just sit on the blockchain without doing anything. It's not something that will work on its own, it's just a piece of a document on the smart contract. The only time that it will be interacted with it is somebody call a function within a smart contract through javascript. So that is how I understand how the whole mechanics of smart contract working.
00:15:17.938 - 00:15:26.050, Speaker B: Yeah, but it takes me a couple of months and my background, despite me being having a product lead and a product manager who were working on different products.
00:15:26.120 - 00:15:26.546, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:26.648 - 00:15:58.122, Speaker B: I think I only have very basic development. I can do a little bit of python, I can do HTML and basic stuff, right? But when it comes to doing real full stack development and of course blockchain development and of course front end. So that actually requires me to rekindle and restart my whole programming from scratch just to get myself used to it. Just a couple of months, I think is sufficient for us to create something from scratch.
00:15:58.266 - 00:17:06.950, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's important for people to know this, because a lot of people that never got into tech stuff always think wrongly that blockchain is so difficult because they think they need to write the Ethereum protocol. But no, the whole point of this ecosystem is to make it easy for people to launch their product, as I often say, actually smart contract programming. Actually, to me it's even more simple than front end, for example. But a lot of beginners, they don't realize, but like front end, you know, you have so many moving parts like HTML, the CSS, the Javascript, the HTTP request, like you go in every direction. But with smart contract, I wouldn't say it's easy, but it's not as hard as what people say and the code is shorter and the interaction are quite clear. You have like this smart contract that called this one, whereas in a browser there are just a lot of things you need to understand. I hope this is inspiring for people who are thinking of building their own defi project.
00:17:06.950 - 00:17:14.840, Speaker A: And also I wonder, so you say, you based in Singapore and me, I always view Singapore as really the blockchain hub for.
00:17:19.130 - 00:17:57.090, Speaker B: Singapore is actually, I mean, I was actually based in China, but I moved to Singapore last year because I believe that Singapore is the emerging market for the fintech and blockchain and crypto is part of it. So I moved to Singapore for that. I never looked back because Singapore is really a nice place for any developers or for any people to be based here. I mean the country is good and it's well run. I mean if you look at the current pandemic, we know it right. Singapore is still controlling it very well, I mean, same as Taiwan as well. But for Singapore, I believe that looking at right, this is where the future of fintech and finances.
00:17:57.090 - 00:18:35.102, Speaker B: I think there are two key examples why this is actually happening. All the big giant companies in China, such as Alibaba, Tencent and even byteance, they are announcing they are going to set up the main headquarter in Singapore because they wanted to be part of this movement here. And they are hiring like what, 3000 engineers here. I think there is not enough engineers in Singapore for this reason. So that is number one in Singapore. And of course there are really big players here. Facebook is here, grab is know all the giants are here and of course the financial companies as well, that's number one.
00:18:35.102 - 00:19:14.746, Speaker B: And the second one is that in Southeast Asia or hopefully upcoming Asia, all the fintech and crypto will be coming to here as well. If you look at Coinbase, Coinmarketcap, Binance actually have presence here. I mean BMAX is based in Hong Kong, but I'm not sure what is the next step. But coming to Singapore is actually the next step to expand to this region. And because of that we wanted to Dao Ventures to be based here because Dao Ventures. Dao Ventures, you know, kind of funny side note, a lot of people who do not understand crypto will be asking Dao, is this something to do with the asian Zen thing? But people in crypto we know that dow, we are talking about decentralized autonomous organizations.
00:19:14.778 - 00:19:14.926, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:14.948 - 00:19:35.170, Speaker B: Dao Ventures. So what we wanted to do is to create a financial application similar like a VC. But of course, right now is a Defi robo advisory to invest into defi protocols. But being in Singapore will give us the really good advantage to take the timing and the growth of defi in this region.
00:19:35.690 - 00:20:24.398, Speaker A: Yeah. And to complement what you said, I think Singapore is going to become even more important for blockchain in Asia in the future, because with everything that's happening in Hong Kong, I think more and more companies are moving from Hong Kong to Singapore. So before, it was like always a fight between Singapore and Hong Kong for who would be the first one for the financial center in Asia. It was 50 50 for a long time. And I think now it's clear that Singapore is going to win this battle. I think we're going to wrap it up. Before we end, I just want to reemphasize that you are looking for a developer for your project Dao venture.
00:20:24.398 - 00:20:32.950, Speaker A: So if anybody is interested, they can reach out to you via Twitter. I guess maybe I can put your Twitter handle in the description.
00:20:33.850 - 00:20:55.706, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll send you a Twitter handle. Of course, LinkedIn and just one support email will do as well. They can email to us at our email, and I'll be arranging a chat with. So Julian, for this, I would like to express my gratitude as well. So yesterday I just had a call with one of the fellow community members from either block, and then he added me through the discord chat.
00:20:55.738 - 00:20:55.886, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:55.908 - 00:21:04.734, Speaker B: And we were just talking to him and, yeah, kind of like I met somebody from across the world in the blockchain development, interested to do something together through your community.
00:21:04.852 - 00:21:05.182, Speaker A: Okay.
00:21:05.236 - 00:21:07.570, Speaker B: That is actually something you'd be very proud of.
00:21:07.720 - 00:21:51.630, Speaker A: Thank you. It's really hard to start a community. At the beginning, there is just you. I remember I started with a private telegram chat one year ago, and there were less people, but there was some discussion, but it wasn't as active. And at some point, the community grew. I added more course, and then people say, hey, can we have a discord chat? You can have a different channel. So then we moved to discord, and then I saw the community growing organically with students getting together, doing some sub project, for example, for my course on a flash loan, and some students, they built their own extension for the flash loan, and they are running it on a private server.
00:21:51.630 - 00:22:22.840, Speaker A: And also, like you mentioned, so some of the students meet each other for projects. To me, that's really the huge value of communities like this. Anyway, I hope that this was really a good inspiration for everybody who want to build their own defi project. Even if you're not a technical person, you can make transformation, learn coding in a few months, and you're able to build your project. It's possible. Thank you, Victor, and I'll talk to you soon.
00:22:23.770 - 00:22:25.170, Speaker B: Thanks, Julian. Bye.
