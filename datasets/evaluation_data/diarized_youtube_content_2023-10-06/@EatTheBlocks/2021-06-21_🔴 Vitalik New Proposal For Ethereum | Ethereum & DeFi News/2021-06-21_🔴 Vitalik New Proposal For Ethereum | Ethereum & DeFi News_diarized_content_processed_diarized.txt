00:00:09.120 - 00:00:27.140, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly stream on the latest and greatest news, ethereum. In Ethereum and Defi. I'm Julian, your host. And on the blocks I teach blockchain development. Hi guys. In the chat we have Siatan dad, we have Dan.
00:00:27.140 - 00:01:09.252, Speaker A: So before we start with news, two quick announcements. So first, tomorrow we are going to do a live training on an NFT marketplace. So if you want to learn how to build an NFT marketplace, check out the curriculum. I put the link in the description. And second, they're going to be another live stream this week. So I'm going to launch something new called Edoblocks Project. So basically, since I started the channel, the community of developers grew a lot.
00:01:09.252 - 00:01:51.120, Speaker A: We now have 500,000 view per month on the channel. And I receive a lot of message of people who want to start projects with me. And so I'm going to give you an opportunity to do this. So we are going to build a project together and it is going to be based on the ETB token that I airdrop a couple of weeks ago. So I'm going to do a live stream to explain everything, how it's going to work and what's going to be the first project we're going to build together. So I put the link for the live stream in the chat. So register if you want to receive the link for this live stream.
00:01:51.120 - 00:02:21.788, Speaker A: All right, so we're going to start with the price of ethers. That was a really bad week. We keep going down, unfortunately, we broke the $2,000 level. So we have to put this in the general context. The stocks are going down, all the crypto market is going down. And that's because we start to have big fears about inflation. So the inflation is back in the US.
00:02:21.788 - 00:03:01.544, Speaker A: I think we are already at something like five, 6%, so way above the target of the Fed, which is 2% annually. And we had some comments of the Fed that said that they will probably start to raise the interest rate from 2023. So actually when they say this, it means they're going to do it sooner. And so when they raise interest rate, it's bearish for markets. And crypto is one of the markets. So that's the main reason why we have this downtrend. In terms of gas price, it's super low.
00:03:01.544 - 00:03:56.504, Speaker A: Now, we haven't seen this level since most than one year. So on the one hand it's good because we can use Ethereum at a cheaper price, but on the other hand, it is also a sign of the recent decline of the crypto market. So next some news about Ethereum. So we had some announcement about the London heart fork. So the London upgrade is going to include some very important change like EIP 1559, which was going to be a big change on how gas price are compute, on how a transaction fee are calculated. And so first we're going to have a deployment on public testnet. So in the next few weeks this upgrade is going to be deployed to Robstone, et cetera.
00:03:56.504 - 00:04:45.672, Speaker A: And for Mainnet we don't have an exact date yet, so most likely will be in the summer, but it's going to be a bullish news when we know the exact date. Then a new release of Geth, which is the main client for Ethereum. And so there was an improvement, and now we can sync a full geth node in just 7 hours. Before it used to take several days. So even though we're talking a lot of Ethereum 2.0, we still have a lot of innovation in Ethereum one that is going next. Vitalik buttering has published a post to explain a new proposal on the state of Ethereum.
00:04:45.672 - 00:05:37.320, Speaker A: So that's called verkel tree, not merkel tree, verkel tree. So it's quite technical, but basically the general idea is to. A problem we try to solve in the blockchain is how to make the blockchain more light. So with less data, because as we keep adding data to the blockchain, it becomes bigger and bigger and it starts to be unsustainable. So in this new proposal, we're going to have a concept of a state expiry. So basically if some state was not accessed after a certain time, it's going to be removed from the blockchain, but there will still be a mechanism to re access it. That's the basic idea of Vitalik.
00:05:37.320 - 00:06:25.484, Speaker A: So it's quite technical, but the gist of it is we still have a lot of work that is being done to improve the effectiveness of the data storage on the blockchain. Then some news about l two scaling solution. So there is this company called stockware that is working on a project called Stocknet. So Stocknet, this is basically an implementation of zero knowledge roll up. And so they're going to launch the alpha release on Robston. So it's one more l two scaling solution. Then we have a new service called ETh Sign.
00:06:25.484 - 00:07:18.344, Speaker A: So this allow you to sign agreements on crypto networks. Basically for example, if you want to sign some contract, instead of storing the contract on a centralized server, you can publish it on the blockchain, so you don't rely on any centralized third party to sign your contract. This application was actually when Ethereum was first released. That was one of the first application that people were thinking about this signing thing then. So let's check out the market cap for DFi. So that was another bad week. So we down to 50 billion.
00:07:18.344 - 00:07:50.564, Speaker A: So we have a support here at 50 billion. We're probably going to cross it. So of course, it's largely due to the decrease in the price of Ethereum. Also, in terms of the number of ethereum locked in defi, we are also going down in terms of the main project. So we have had a lot of change. So now the main project is Aave, and one of the main reason is Ave. Now it's going full multi chain curve finance.
00:07:50.564 - 00:08:23.052, Speaker A: Nice. Number two, compound maker instadap has gone up a lot and Uniswap. So there is a big drop in Uniswap. For a long time, Uniswap was the king of defi. Not anymore, but also Uniswap released their v three recently. So right now there is a migration that is going on from v two to v three. But as people start to learn how to use Uniswap V three, I think it's going to come back up in the ranking and sushi swap.
00:08:23.052 - 00:09:06.540, Speaker A: Now it's less than 50% of Uniswap. So at some point we thought that sushi swap will overtake Uniswap, but this is not the case at all. Then let's continue with the top defi coins. So it's been pretty bad week for defi coin. We have a very few green coin here. If you check the loser, we have many more loser with some really big drop here, -80% -50 -30 balancer -30 et cetera, et cetera. So, yeah, really bad week for DFI.
00:09:06.540 - 00:10:05.800, Speaker A: Then we are going to continue with a drama on curve finance. So basically, curve finance is considering suing another protocol, saddle finance, because they accuse them of having stolen some code. So it's a little bit similar to uniswap v three, which started to protect itself with a license that's not allowed to be copy pasted to prevent all the folks. So we will see if at the end there is a lawsuit that ensued. So that would be interesting to see how it works technically, because curve finance, this is a dao, they don't have a legal entity yet. So if there is a lawsuit, I really don't know how it's going to work out. Then some news about alchemics.
00:10:05.800 - 00:10:51.916, Speaker A: So there was a bug in their code that allowed people to basically withdraw their collateral even if they haven't repaid their loan. So as a result they have lost a couple of million dollars. So there wasn't any single attackers. It was just everyone that was able to, all the users that were able to withdraw more money than what they should. Then we're going to talk of NFT. So here are the ranking for the most traded NFT collection for the last seven days. So axie infinity, still number one board, ape yacht club.
00:10:51.916 - 00:11:24.460, Speaker A: So this is a newcomer NBA topshot still among the top one. Crypto punk. Also sorare wearable here, Decentraland. And then we're going to continue with specific news about NFT project. So sorare, which is one of the biggest NFT marketplace, is launching some cards for team of soccer. So currently this is the euro in Europe. So this is a timely release.
00:11:24.460 - 00:11:58.980, Speaker A: Then we have the NFT marketplace of binance, which is coming up in the next couple of days. So I'm pretty bullish about this. Binance is pretty good with products. They have a big user base and generally every time they release a new product, usually it's a big success. And I'm pretty sure it's going to add up a new utility to the BNB token. So it's bullish for BNB. Next, still about Binance.
00:11:58.980 - 00:12:49.160, Speaker A: So on the NFT marketplace we already have some info about what's going to be one of the first project that's going to be released. So es spot. So yeah, that's also because currently this is the euro. So you'll see a lot of NFT project pushing things that are related to soccer. Then another NFT project about Rick and Morty's. If you don't know Rick and Morty, that's a, so there we are going to have some NFT about Rick and Morty. Then some news about engine.
00:12:49.160 - 00:13:55.192, Speaker A: So engine, this is a company that does blockchain gaming and they're going to release some limited edition NFT of then McLaren had signed a deal with Tezos in order to create some NFT for fans. So we haven't heard a lot about tezos. So it's a bit surprising. I guess there's some good salespeople at the Tezos Foundation. I don't know. Then Mark Cuban, who is the owner of the Dallas Maverick, is also a billionaire that has been a big supporter of crypto and he's announced that they are going to release some tickets with NFT starting next season. And so this is super cool because when you buy a ticket for some game that become really famous, your ticket can become a collector, a special item.
00:13:55.192 - 00:14:39.610, Speaker A: But if this is an NFT for the secondary market, it's way more simple. So we are going to basically introduce finance for these items. So I think this is very smart. I can definitely see a big use case for this. Then we're going to talk of enterprise blockchain and regulation. So Microstrategy announced that they purchased an additional 13,000 bitcoin for about 500 million in cash. So it's pretty refreshing to see some big companies that are doubling down on their commitment of crypto in the middle of this bear market.
00:14:39.610 - 00:15:32.344, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, micro seller has been one of the biggest supporters of crypto since the very beginning. So, yeah, it's always good to see some news about microstrategy because it sends a signal to the other big company that are following the lead of Michael Seller. If they see him buying bitcoin, then they're not going to panic, say, okay, well, we can keep buying. Then we have some news about the gpus. So the price of GPU worldwide are falling. And of course, part of it is because there is this crackdown in China for crypto mining. But also we're going to have this transition in Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake, where we're not going to need a GPU anymore.
00:15:32.344 - 00:16:40.530, Speaker A: So it's not surprising then this company, Signum, is going to launch a new product to allow institutional to access decentralized finance. So it's going to be very bullish for DeFi because currently DeFi is not very easy to use for all these institutional actors, especially when it comes to KYC, et cetera. They are really concerned about respecting every regulation. So if they have some product specifically designed for them, it's going to add some liquidity in DeFi. It's very good. Then we have some news about Goldman Sachs, who is planning to add some ether option. So this is very important because a lot of institutional, actually, they don't want to enter the crypto market with directly ether, bitcoin, et cetera, but they are more keen to gamble on the derivative market and with instrument like options.
00:16:40.530 - 00:17:27.760, Speaker A: So it's pretty good for ether. Then some news about China that made another really bad statement this week. China said that banks must block all the crypto transactions. So banks must not support any company that does trading, clearing and settlement for crypto transactions. So we've had a consistent stream of bad news in the last few weeks, the last few months, even from China. And of course, this hasn't helped the crypto markets. So still in China, the province of Sichuan ordered that the state power grid cut the supply for all the mining farms.
00:17:27.760 - 00:18:31.152, Speaker A: So yeah, it seems like basically the whole mining industry is just getting totally shut down from China. And yeah, China is being super negative now. Then some news about a company called Coincloud that is going to install more than 2000 kiosks worldwides to sell some cryptocurrencies. Then Portugal is going to grant some crypto license for a couple of exchange. So maybe it's going to be the next Malta. Then Galaxy Digital announced that it's going to provide liquidity for Goldman Sachs bitcoin futures. So one more institutional that is providing services for crypto, then grayscale.
00:18:31.152 - 00:19:23.060, Speaker A: So this is one of the biggest crypto fund is exploring additional assets and in particular coins in DeFi. So all these coins might be added by Grayscale Bancorp, one inch curve, et cetera. So that's pretty bullish for all these cons because you're going to have a lot of institutional that start to invest in this. Then some bad news. So now we have reports of scammers that are sending some fake ledger, and basically they're telling people that this ledger is a replacement for the existing one because the existing one has some problem. So people transfer their coin from the good ledger to the bad one. And of course, they already know all the private keys of this ledger.
00:19:23.060 - 00:20:07.924, Speaker A: And this is related to the data breach that exposed almost 300,000 customers. So if you receive a parcel that claims to be from a ledger, make sure to not use this ledger. This is a fake one. Then we have some news of a real estate guy who is going to invest $100 million in decentralized social networking protocols. Project Liberty. I've never heard of that one. Then Amber Group has just raised $100 million in the latest funding run.
00:20:07.924 - 00:21:24.920, Speaker A: So Amber Group, this is a trading firm in crypto that provides services to, you know, it's very important in a bear market like this to stay focused on what the institutional are doing, not what the retail market is doing. And you can see that institutional, big companies, they keep investing in crypto, there is no problem at all. Then a security audit firm has raised $5 million in order to keep developing themselves. And so they do some advanced stuff for smart contract security. We're going to see a lot of money invested in security because we really need more security so that regulators can start to trust crypto now with all the scam we have on binance, marching, et cetera, it doesn't do a good advertisement for crypto. Then a company called TRM Labs has raised $14 million. So this is an intelligence firm based in San Francisco.
00:21:24.920 - 00:22:02.628, Speaker A: And so basically they build tools to analyze what happened on the blockchain. And this is used mainly by government agencies to track criminal. So I'm really, really for that kind of tool, even though it's eroding a little bit our privacy. But again, we need to show regulators that it's possible to catch criminals on the blockchain so that they stop to think that blockchain is only for criminal. We need to be able to stop criminals on the blockchain. Super important then. Talking of bitcoin.
00:22:02.628 - 00:22:33.120, Speaker A: So we have some news from Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano. So he said that bitcoin is his worst enemy and it will lose to Ethereum. So it's pretty rare to see Charles Hoskinson saying good things about Ethereum. There was a lot of drama with Charles Hoskinson. He was one of the first person in the team of Ethereum back in 2016, and then there was a big clash and then he left to do his own thing. So. Yeah.
00:22:33.120 - 00:22:55.050, Speaker A: Well, thank you, Charles. We always appreciate the positive comments. Then let's continue with the news for developers. So we have a new release of Hot Hat. Hat. Hat is an alternative framework to truffle is getting a lot of traction, and I think these days it might be even more used than truffle. There's probably a flippening here.
00:22:55.050 - 00:23:41.210, Speaker A: So there was a new release of hot Hat with a couple of updates. So mainly they support three DT 0.8 and other stuff. We have a new service, wayroll, that allow to wrap several transactions in a single one. And finally, Chainsafe announced a new SDK to easily develop a blockchain game. And so if I understood well, this is an SDK for unity. So in unity you'll be able to add some features to connect to all the web3 ecosystem, basically.
00:23:41.210 - 00:24:19.376, Speaker A: All right, so now we're going to do the Q and A, but very briefly reminder. So tomorrow we are going to do a live training on how to build an NFT marketplace. It's not going to be on YouTube. It's going to be on the Edoblocks academy. If you want to book your seat, I put the link here. And your instructor for this course is Nader Dabid. So Nader is a senior developer that is extremely knowledgeable in NFT used to work at AWS.
00:24:19.376 - 00:25:02.768, Speaker A: He wrote a book, react native in action. So that's really a heavyweight in the development world. And I'm super excited about this training. Then the other quick announcement I wanted to make is that this week, Friday, we're going to do another live stream where we're going to launch something new. We're going to launch idoblocks project. So with the blocks project, we are going to build a project together based on the ETB token. And basically I'm going to explain everything, how it works Friday and I'm going to explain what is the first project we going to build together.
00:25:02.768 - 00:25:23.780, Speaker A: So if you want to build project together with the Etherblocks community, register for this live training. I just put the link in the chat, so let me scroll up and see what kind of question we have today. Hi, George. Hi, Thx. Hi, Mr. Han Solo. Hi, Alvaro.
00:25:23.780 - 00:25:34.844, Speaker A: Hi, rich agai. Good afternoon. Just farm stablecoin and the week will be good. Yes. Hi, batsman. Smash that like button, everyone. Yes.
00:25:34.844 - 00:25:44.824, Speaker A: Hi. Abracadabra. Eric, Joe Biden. Hey, hey. Hi there. Abracadabra. Question for Julian.
00:25:44.824 - 00:26:13.572, Speaker A: Could you cover the hack of r finance? Seems to me as a pure inside job, but they blame bank run. Okay, so I missed that news. Maybe later this week. Yeah, thanks for the suggestion. Arcadus, has iron finance crash impacted Defi a lot? Okay, so same answer. Siam Tamda. Julian, can you please show us how to add dexes on the profitable flash loan course that you are updating? Like giving us things to note.
00:26:13.572 - 00:26:48.916, Speaker A: Okay, so for this course I'm working on, first update is how to have a flash loan on binance marching. It's probably going to be released this week and then maybe we can think of other updates. Abracadabra. They had 2 billion locked and now like 20 million. Actually, I think you're talking of RN finance. Is it on finance marching or ethereum? Sounds like binance marching. Then a lot of people said that it's been a bad week.
00:26:48.916 - 00:27:04.484, Speaker A: Yeah, sometimes there is nothing we could do about it. Unfortunately. Abracadabra. Only thing which is going up is worse to invest now in twin decks and three. Okay, I don't know this project. Abracadabra. Question for Julian.
00:27:04.484 - 00:27:41.808, Speaker A: What is the better crosschain, Dex three or Thor decks? And why? Okay, so I don't know this chain. I need to have a look, man. You allow me to put my token on the binance march and months ago. Never got to say thanks. Yeah, I'm glad the blocks could be helpful. Then what else do we have Amif. What blockchain is the digital yuan built on? I believe it's the appropriatory blockchain.
00:27:41.808 - 00:28:01.560, Speaker A: I'm not even sure if they folk on existing technology. Yeah, I'm going to do some research. Abracadabra. Okay, no, it's not a question. Then what do we have? What do we have? Alvaro, I will never miss your videos again. Wow. Extremely informative.
00:28:01.560 - 00:28:16.332, Speaker A: You are a great person. Thanks. Thank you, Alvaro. Then abracadabra. ETB to the moon. Yes. Virtual reality hamster.
00:28:16.332 - 00:28:26.212, Speaker A: Hey, Bernardo. Hi. From Rio. Hey, man. Spin boy. I want an eat the blocks then t shirt. Yeah, man.
00:28:26.212 - 00:28:46.548, Speaker A: I should do my own merch at some point. Abracadabra. Aaron finance was on binance, marching and polygon. That's bad. Champaru. Hyman Rashad. What's your opinion about vchain, Thor? I just know that they are focused on logistics.
00:28:46.548 - 00:29:01.070, Speaker A: That's it. That's it. Bracadabra for Julian three and Thordex are l one crosschain dexes, which mean you can now swap bitcoin to ether, et cetera. Okay. Wow, that's super cool. Super cool. I'm going to check that out.
00:29:01.070 - 00:29:36.890, Speaker A: All right, guys, I think we are running out of questions so quickly. Let me copy paste the two links of today. So first link, if you want to participate in a live training tomorrow to build an NFT marketplace, follow this link. And second, if you want to register for the second live streaming of this week, register here. So I'm going to explain a new thing we're going to do on eidoblox called edoblocks project. We're going to build a project together based on the ETB token. This is going to be super cool.
00:29:36.890 - 00:30:24.040, Speaker A: Let me see. We still have a few questions. Would you be able to do a tutorial for yield farms using the UI like pancake swap? So it might be a live training later? Yeah. Mr. Blocks, can you recommend some good resources to get into learning EVM? Well, first, start with my series on solidity on my channel. You'll learn quite a bit. Tshx, do you think Ethereum will get its value back soon? I think night is going to be a negative cycle probably for a while because inflation is going to depress the equity market and unfortunately, crypto seems to be quite corroded to this.
00:30:24.040 - 00:31:11.912, Speaker A: So, yeah, expect, I would say between maybe three to six months of negativity. But personally, I never tried to time the market because I'm in it for the really long term because I believe the really big gain are made, really, on several years. So really, I don't care if tomorrow ether goes to $1,000, $500, it's just going to shake the weak hands. But I'm not going to sell anything. I'm not going to sell one cent one way. I just keep everything, and I keep it for the very long term. And also, I do think, in any case, the best investment you can make is in yourself, in your skills, in the own project you build.
00:31:11.912 - 00:31:34.344, Speaker A: So don't feel so constrained by the shortened fluctuations of the market. Okay. Kevin Kimity just started working as a junior developer thanks to Edoblocks money. Thanks. Wow, man, I'm so happy to hear this. Virtual reality still at work. Idoblox.
00:31:34.344 - 00:31:46.852, Speaker A: Thank you. Jake breeding. Hey, man, check up on toast chain. Biggest airdrop in history. Eat fork. Oh, cool. All right, guys, so I think this is it.
00:31:46.852 - 00:32:01.936, Speaker A: No more question. So thanks for attending, everyone, and don't forget to come for the second live stream this week. It's going to be Friday. We are going to launch something new called idoblocks Project. All right, guys, thanks for coming. Have a great day. Bye.
