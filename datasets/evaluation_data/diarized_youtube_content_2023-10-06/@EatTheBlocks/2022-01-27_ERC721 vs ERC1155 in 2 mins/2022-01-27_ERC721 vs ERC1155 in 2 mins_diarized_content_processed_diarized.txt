00:00:00.490 - 00:00:46.954, Speaker A: In this video, we're going to learn the ERC seven two one and the ERC 1155 token standards. Both of these token standards are for creating nonfungible tokens, also known as nfts. For those of you who don't know, nfts are simply a way in which we can show digital ownership of unique or rarer assets on a blockchain. An ERC seven two one allows us to create assets that are totally unique and clearly show who has ownership of that asset. For example, if I was an artist, I could turn one of my paintings into a digital asset and freely sell it on an open marketplace. Then, thanks to the properties of the ERC seven two one and the Ethereum blockchain, we're able to clearly see when this asset was created, who created it, who owns it now, and what price they paid for it. This is a powerful standard because the information is immutable and can't be tampered with.
00:00:46.954 - 00:01:39.026, Speaker A: Which means that it is easy to verify who owns an asset, and it is easy to determine if someone has made a fake copy of your asset. An ERC 1155 is similar to the ERC seven two one because they both have the ability to create digital assets that are totally unique. However, unlike the ERC seven two one, the ERC 1155 also has the ability to create digital assets that are not unique. For example, if we wanted to create a card trading game where we had ten copies of a card and the goal was to collect all ten copies, we can easily do this with an ERC 1155. But this is the confusing part for a lot of people, because now that we can have copies of an NFT, it is technically no longer unique. Nonunique assets are not actually a bad thing. ERC one one five five s are gaining popularity when creating assets for virtual worlds or games because typically you might not want every sword in a game to be unique.
00:01:39.026 - 00:01:57.180, Speaker A: You probably want two or three types of swords, but then hundreds or even thousands of copies of those swords. Although ERC seven two ones are currently the more widely adopted standard, I think that ERC 1155s will eventually take over as gaming and virtual worlds grow in popularity. That's it for this video. See you later.
