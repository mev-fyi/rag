00:00:00.330 - 00:00:37.926, Speaker A: Synthetics staking rewards contract is one of the most influential contracts in Defi. So in this video I'll explain what it is and the math behind it. And later on we'll write some code. So first of all, what is it? The staking rewards contract is a contract where you earn rewards for staking, a token. Let's say that there is a staking rewards contract. The owner of this contract will be able to set the rewards and the duration, the amount of reward to pay and the duration that they're going to be paying. For example, let's say that this owner sets 1000 rewards that are to be paid out for the duration of one week.
00:00:37.926 - 00:01:17.210, Speaker A: So the owner sets the rewards and sets duration and sending the 1000 rewards. Once the owner sets the rewards and the duration, the users will be able to stake their token and start earning the rewards. For example, let's say that the user stakes 200 tokens into this contract. Besides this user, there are many users that have already staked their tokens inside this contract. So for this example, we'll say that the total amount of tokens that are staked is 2000 tokens. One week later, this user withdraws all of his tokens that he staked 200 tokens so he will get the 200 tokens back. And let's now calculate how many rewards this user has earned.
00:01:17.210 - 00:01:59.930, Speaker A: This user staked 200 tokens out of the total of 2000 tokens that were there. The amount of reward tokens that is being paid out is 1000 tokens per week. And this user has staked it for one week. So we multiply this by one week. So this will be equal to 200 divided by 2000 is one over ten times that by 1000, that will be 100 per week, times it by one week and we get 100 rewards earned. So this was an overview of how the staking rewards contract worked. The owner of the contract sets the rewards and the duration and then sends the rewards token into the staking rewards contract.
00:01:59.930 - 00:02:14.050, Speaker A: The users stake their token and over time the users will earn the reward tokens. It's.
