00:00:06.590 - 00:00:28.346, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the greatest and on the greatest and latest news in Ethereum and defy. I'm Julian, your host. And on edoblocks I teach blockchain development. Hi to everybody in the chat. Hi, Eric. Sujan Tren IMF George Plano saga so quick announcement, tomorrow at 11:00 p.m.
00:00:28.346 - 00:00:58.338, Speaker A: UTC plus eight we are going to do our next live training on smart contract security. So this time it will be on smart contract audits. So smart contract security. This is the highest paid skill in crypto, but especially inside this niche, the niche. In the niche, the absolutely highest paid skill in crypto is to do smart contract audits. You can make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year make doing this. Unfortunately, there is absolutely nobody that teaches you how to do this.
00:00:58.338 - 00:01:30.582, Speaker A: Well, we're going to have a pro that teach us. So it's going to be sue hell, who is a professional security expert in cybersecurity. He's been in cybersecurity for many, many years. He's already done a live training previously with us. It was a huge success. And for this live training, we are almost completely booked. So if you want your seat, make sure to book it now and after the replay will be available.
00:01:30.582 - 00:02:02.866, Speaker A: So let me copy paste the link in the chat. All right, so we are going to continue with the price of ether. So that was a bad week of ether. Unfortunately, we could not stay above the support at $2,000 yet. We're back at the territory below that. So that's not great. But you have to know that generally during summer, this is a time of a lot of uncertainty in crypto.
00:02:02.866 - 00:02:38.114, Speaker A: So, you know, July, August can be very volatile, but it's not really meaningful. And after everybody is back from a holiday in September, serious things can start again. So probably that we're going to see some rally in the summers. Don't freak out if during this summer it decrease a lot, during the fall it's going to be much better. All right, so then in terms of gas price. So we're still very low, a slight decrease. But generally speaking it stayed pretty low.
00:02:38.114 - 00:03:19.470, Speaker A: So the Ethereum blockchain is more usable these days. And so last week we had a big announcement for the London mainnet fork. So this is the next big upgrade of Ethereum. There was already a successful upgrade on Testnet, and so now the code of the Ethereum client was updated to officially schedule the upgrade. So it's going to happen on this block, which is roughly between August 3 and the fifth. So it's going to be very soon, and of course that's going to be bullish for ether. And in terms of the big upgrade.
00:03:19.470 - 00:03:54.940, Speaker A: So there is this nice infographic here that explain everything. So basically, the main upgrade is EIP. Where is EIP? 1559? How comes it's not there? How comes you're not there? Okay. I was afraid. I was like, what? Yes. So yap 1559. This is the main change, but there are still some others.
00:03:54.940 - 00:04:34.242, Speaker A: All right, so next news. This is a news about a documentary that's going to be done on Ethereum featuring Vitalik buttering. And they've already raised a $2 million for this documentary, which is above their goal. So it was crowd founded. So it's going to be called Ethereum the infinite Garden. It's going to be cool, really, to get the words out. The mainstream media and most of the public is always focused on bitcoin, but we need to shift the narrative and repeat the word Ethereum.
00:04:34.242 - 00:05:03.822, Speaker A: Ethereum. Ethereum. So that people understand that it's what they need to focus on. Some news from Ethereum. Name service ens. So EnS is a service of Ethereum that allow you to attach a name to an address exactly like the DNS on the Internet. We had some statistic for ENS, and so it grew about 10,700 addresses in June.
00:05:03.822 - 00:06:10.722, Speaker A: And so now we have about $300 million attached to EnS. On the one hand, it's good that we have so much money attached to it, but at the same time, it also make it more prone to attacks, because now there is more money on the table. So probably that with time, the ENS service is going to become more and more expensive as it's attached to, it's secured more and more money. Then we have some news from Ave, the founder of Ave, which has tweeted that he's interested in building a Twitter on ethereum. And this comes after a remark of Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, that said that he wants to build a new sort of defi platform built on. I mean, I'm not sure if Jack Dorsey is serious, but I do believe that the founder of Ave is serious. So maybe this is going to be a proposal for their dao.
00:06:10.722 - 00:06:51.694, Speaker A: And I do think one of the big, really untapped potential of the blockchain is really social network. We only had a few attempts at this, so we had a steamit. I don't know if you guys remember, that was during the previous bull run in 2017. That was basically a sort of decentralized medium where author were paid based on number of visits on each of their article. And it got a lot of success at the very beginning. Sometime you could make like $200 if you wrote an article, but after it kind of started to be forgotten. But I think this is really a shame because right now we have defi.
00:06:51.694 - 00:07:48.914, Speaker A: This is obviously the main application of blockchain. And then we have NFT and game, the second biggest application. But I think another axis for development is social media. And so far we were blocked by the high fees. But now with all the work that is being done on scalability, all the layer two scaling solution, maybe we start to be closer at the point where we can actually think of developing social network on blockchain. All right, so next, some news from a Defi protocol called Superfluid that raised $9 million. So that's basically what we call a streaming protocol that allow you to pay people, but in a stream, instead of just being paid at the end of the month, you are getting paid continuously.
00:07:48.914 - 00:08:27.694, Speaker A: So it's really a big breakthrough in DFI. Then some news from Conex that just raised $12 million. So Connex is an interoperability project. It basically connects the different l two scaling solution on Ethereum. So for example, polygon, optimism, et cetera. And as we have more and more liquidity, that moves to this l two chain, that's going to be very useful because if people have to come back to l one before changing to another l two, it's going to be a big issue. It's going to be very costly.
00:08:27.694 - 00:08:57.670, Speaker A: So Conex is going to solve this very important problem. Then we're going to continue with the market cap of DFI. So a small decrease this week, 55. So, yeah, I mean, we are hovering just above a 50 billion. Yeah, it's been a while like this in terms of the number of ether locked. So it keeps going up. So actually, the decrease in absolute value here in dollar value is because of the decrease of the price of ether.
00:08:57.670 - 00:09:47.580, Speaker A: But yeah, you can see that more and more ether is being locked in the system and in terms of ranking. So ave is still the number one, the only protocol above 10 billion instadap solid. Number two, Uniswap is still quite far away. It used to be number one, sushi swap also way after Uniswap. And yeah, surprisingly, curve finance now is above uniswap, but it's probably not going to last because really uniswap v three to me is absolutely superior to curve finance. Then some news from the DFI coin so the biggest winner and loser of the week. So empty said dollar here, biggest increase with 50%.
00:09:47.580 - 00:10:26.550, Speaker A: Then we have Olympus. It's olympus dao plus 40%, almost YFI, so plus 13%. Small increase. Bella protocol, small increase as well. And finally, harvest finance here, almost nothing actually, when I checked just before, it was plus 10%, but now it almost come back to zero. So they announced their Vtuber. Apparently there is not much effect, unfortunately.
00:10:26.550 - 00:10:52.430, Speaker A: Okay, so then for the losses. So we also have a lot of loser this week. We have the boring dao token, but this is the old one, so I don't think it's very relevant. Thorchain. I think there was a big hack, if I remember well, alpha finance, instadap. So instadap recently rised a lot. So yeah, I mean, it's still very volatile.
00:10:52.430 - 00:11:35.802, Speaker A: Bounce out on this protocol, synthetics -30% et cetera. So really a lot of winner, but of loser. Also this week, very volatile week for defi token. Then let's check the dashboard for crypto fees. So, yeah, ethereum is still far ahead of other blockchain, like binance, spotchain, Uniswap v three. This is the top earning protocol across all blockchain. So that's always interesting to compare this figure to the actual market cap, because really, we can be sure that long term, the price of a token should be correlated to the fee that the protocol is able to earn.
00:11:35.802 - 00:12:21.440, Speaker A: So by these metrics, I do believe that the token of uni is really undervalued. Ave really deserve its place for the top market cap. It deserves its place in the top market cap of Defi and Ethereum, because you also earn a lot of fee. And if you check quickswap also makes quite a lot of money. And if you check the protocol on binance smart chain, they are far below this. So, for example, pancake swap, which has way more user than uniswap in terms of the fees that are collected, is way, way below. Do we even see it here? Let me see.
00:12:21.440 - 00:12:41.762, Speaker A: Do we even see it here? I'm not even sure. Where are you? Pancake swap. Yeah, so we should see it somewhere. It's weird. We don't see it. Anyway, let's keep going. So we're going to continue with specific news of Defi project.
00:12:41.762 - 00:13:32.014, Speaker A: And there was Uniswap that announced their deployment on optimism. So optimism, which is one of the main alternative to a polygon for all the l two scaling solution. So now you can use optimism to deposit, trade and provide liquidity. They've been working on this integration for a very long time. So now we have uniswap on optimism. Do we have Uniswap on polygon? I'm not sure yet, but it's definitely going to help a lot to have all this d five protocol that moves to l two scaling solution. Then we have a new integration, a new partnership between yield and rebound.
00:13:32.014 - 00:14:14.590, Speaker A: So if I understand correctly, this allow you to do some yield farming by stacking some rewards. So it's a pretty advanced trade. So it's not for beginner, but you can check the article on the blog of ribbon Finance if you're interested. Then some news from Cream finance. So cream Finance, which is a lending protocol, has basically provided a credit line from the Iron bank to plead a Dao. So this is two Dao. This is the first time we have this alone between Dao.
00:14:14.590 - 00:14:51.434, Speaker A: Then we have some super cool news from Shapeshift. So, shapeshift, if you're a newcomer, you probably never heard of Shapeshift. This was one of the first very old crypto project. I think they were created maybe in 2015 or 2016. So that was one of the first projects that allow you to trade crypto in a decentralized way. It was not a Dex, it was another technology. And there was a time when they had a lot of traction, but I think they received a little bit too much regulatory scrutiny and they did not like it.
00:14:51.434 - 00:15:32.620, Speaker A: So they started to take the route of a decentralization and they announced that the corporate entity is going to dissolve into a DAO. So this is the very first time we hear this. We have this legal entity that just going to disappear and dissolve into a decentralized entity. And so all the people who hold some token on shapeshift, this is going to be moved to the DAO. But this is the first time we hear this. So super interesting to see how it's going to work out for them. Is it going to be better as a Dao or on the contrary, are they going to regret it? We will see.
00:15:32.620 - 00:16:07.038, Speaker A: Okay. No, we already covered this superfluid. Then some news from the Phantom wallet. So this is a defi wallet, which currently support the Solana blockchain. And they have raised $9 million by a 16 z. So a 16 z. This is one of the most prestigious investment fund VC in the Silicon Valley.
00:16:07.038 - 00:17:00.262, Speaker A: So when you raise money, it's not just, what matters is not just how much you raise, but also from whom you raise it. Because when you have this guy very famous, like a 16 Z, who invest in your company, of course this is a signal that you send to the market. And after if you want to raise even more money, that means there won't be no problem because you have this huge bullish signal of a 16 z. Then some news from certic. So certic is a company that does a smart contract audit and they raised $37 million. So it's really a big raise and they're going to double their team. So currently they are at a 100 employee and so they're going to double this.
00:17:00.262 - 00:18:01.754, Speaker A: So with a lot of demand for smart contract auditors, then we're going to continue with the DFI hacks. So first there was an exploit for the bridge of any swaps, any swap. This is a project to convert your crypto between a cross blockchain and they were hacked for $8 million. Then some hacked from Thor Chen that lost almost $8 million and they offer a bounty to the hacker if it returns the fund then. And then some hack from Bondley Finance. So that was a minting exploit which means someone managed to mint way more token that they should have been able to. And so $6 million were lost and that was done using the admin account.
00:18:01.754 - 00:18:44.546, Speaker A: So you know, this is always very weird when you have a protocol that is hacked with the admin account. People always wonder, is this the team that hacked themselves? So it's not great for Bondley Finance. And their token dropped by more than 60% following the hack. Then we're going to talk NFT. So here we have a matrix on NFT. We can see the secondary price of the last 1000 sales and actually it has increased a lot. And here you have some other metrics per collection or per NFT marketplace.
00:18:44.546 - 00:19:41.770, Speaker A: So here, superware, average ad block, this is a collection name, average crypto, punk me beats, hash mask and see and average boat apes. So this one I've been doing super well recently. Then we are going to continue with a news from superware which is one of the top NFT marketplace. And so superware, they already introduced an artist royalty. So they allowed artists to earn money for secondary market. But now they introduce another kind of royalty which is called collector royalty. So basically if you are among the first buyer of NFT in the secondary market, basically you're going to receive, let me scroll down to the chart because there is a chart that explained this.
00:19:41.770 - 00:20:35.100, Speaker A: So basically the first buyer, they will receive a share of the royalty for the next few sell. So basically that encourage the first buyers of the NFT to help for the next sale. So that helps for the secondary market. So this is the first time I heard this concept. And superware is really doing a lot of work to fluidify their secondary market for NFT because you see like having a good secondary market, this is really the key for the NFT markets to work. And this can really totally expand the size of the NFT market a lot. If people can know that if they invest in an NFT there is a liquid secondary market, then you're going to have way more trading for NFT and it's going to be awesome.
00:20:35.100 - 00:21:36.990, Speaker A: Then we have this awesome report of DAB radar on Axie Infinity, which is currently one of the most successful blockchain games. So their game totally exploded recently by over their governance. Token AXS grew by more than 800% during the past months according to coin Gecko. If you are in NFT, check out Axie Infinity because this is where we have all the excitement at the moment. Another game that is being very successful at the moment is crypto blades and their number of players increased by 200%. So the number of user of a protocol, this is really a metric that you have to follow because usually this is correlated to the increase in price of their token. Then we're going to continue with enterprise blockchain and a regulation.
00:21:36.990 - 00:22:33.618, Speaker A: So we have a news from a grayscale which is the largest investment fund for crypto. So investment fund they don't invest in, basically they're not VC, but they invest in token directly in crypto asset. And so they started a fund on DeFi token and it's going to be based on a new Defi index produced by Coindesk trade block division. So basically if you want to invest in Defi in a very simple way, you don't want to select yourself all the different sub project, then maybe you can check out the different. Then we have some news from Binance, some bad news from Binance. It's been a really bad streak of bad news from Binance the past few weeks. Like every week we have more negative news.
00:22:33.618 - 00:23:38.866, Speaker A: I hope it's going to end soon. So Binance said that they're going to stop supporting purchasing tokens linked to stock. And it's only three months after they started this new offering because there was many regulatory bodies across the world that started to issue warning. They say, hey man, you start to get a little bit too close to centralized finance, so you cannot really do this. But not all hope is lost because we can still do it in a decentralized way. So I don't know if you guys remember, but a couple of months ago I mentioned that Wall street bets, which is a famous subreddit for traders for a stock market, WallstreetBet was introducing a Dao, basically that allow you to invest in a basket of stocks of stock trading outside of the blockchain. But you basically can invest in this dao on the blockchain and they do this by using some oracle.
00:23:38.866 - 00:24:39.030, Speaker A: So now we can still have basically the stock market on the blockchain, but it will be done in a decentralized way, probably centralized exchanges will not risk to do this because this is just too dangerous for them. Then we have some news from Alibaba, which is one of the biggest e commerce websites in China. So, sorry, Alibaba is the mother company. So the website is Taobao and basically they are making a maker festival. So this is some special event for their merchant, for developers and it's going to include NFT art. And also we have some news from the near protocol which is working with Webstery games. So Webster game, this is a chinese gaming firm on blockchain.
00:24:39.030 - 00:25:41.378, Speaker A: So Nia protocol is partnering with all these companies to sell an NFT, which is related to real estate. So I'm a bit surprised to see some positive news about blockchain in China because recently there was this huge crackdown on the miners activity in China. So it's good to see that there's still some people doing then. Okay, first I miss the news here. So we have a news from El Salvador which announced that the government will launch their own crypto for consumers. It's basically going to be another central bank digital currency. And that's interesting because recently El Salvador also announced measure very supportive of bitcoin.
00:25:41.378 - 00:26:31.058, Speaker A: So we were always under the impression that if central bank were working on their own CDBC, it means they would be against the other crypto, but apparently not for El Salvador then still in the CDBC domain. So we have some news from the European Central bank which is preparing for a digital euro. So we heard a couple of announcements already in the past few weeks. So we have one more statement of an official that give a hint that they are working on this. Then China, which is also working on their own CDBC. So they published the white paper of their ecny. So their CDBC.
00:26:31.058 - 00:27:39.342, Speaker A: And this white paper confirms that there will be smart contract programmability. So this is very important because, you know, as blockchain developer we worry some time because basically we mostly focused on Ethereum, so public decentralized blockchain. And we wonder, okay, well, in the future when there will be all this CDBC. What if the central bank decide to ban all the public networks? Well, first of all, I don't think this is going to happen because this is almost impossible to enforce. But even in the worst case scenario, if this happened, all these central banks, probably a lot of them, they're going to reuse the technology of all the public networks or mainly ethereum. So all the smart contract skills that you learn now on Ethereum, this will be transferable to many other part of the blockchain industry, including CDBC. So your experience as smart contract developer will be very welcome by the central bank and all the entities that are going to build on top of this digital currency.
00:27:39.342 - 00:28:26.740, Speaker A: So really you are not wasting your time. Then we have some news from the SEC that settled some charges he had against an ICO. So yeah, recently we haven't heard a lot of action of the SEC against ICO. It was really a thing of the know, like one, two years ago there was a lot of action, but now ICO pretty much dead. So yeah, this was just an aftermath of some procedure that started before then. We have some news from Russia. So a crypto industry association in Russia launched a project to attract some crypto mining firm in their country.
00:28:26.740 - 00:29:26.820, Speaker A: After all the bad news from China, because now you have all these miners in China who are searching for the next destination. So you have this huge migration out of China now. So you have different countries that try to compete for the attention of these miners. Then we have some news from Turkey, which is going to introduce a regulation for cryptocurrency. And this regulation will be mainly based on the regulation in Europe, in the US. So it's always super important to follow what's happening in terms of regulation in Europe, especially in the US, because you have a lot of other countries, they don't create their own regulation. They basically check, I mean, for financial stuff, they check what the US is doing and they basically do the.
00:29:26.820 - 00:30:08.770, Speaker A: Then some news from. Let me see. I think I missed something here. I missed something. Okay, well, I missed the top, but basically there was a news from Malaysia that seized 1000 bitcoin miners. That was some gang apparently, that stole some electricity, that was doing some bitcoin mining. And so that was a viral video that circulated on YouTube where basically you can see this huge truck that is basically destroying all these bitecoin miners.
00:30:08.770 - 00:30:46.190, Speaker A: We have some news from PayPal. So PayPal announced that they are increasing their limits for customer purchase of crypto to $100,000 per week. And that is only in the US. So if you are in other country, you cannot buy crypto on your PayPal account yet. Right now it's only the US. They are testing this. And then we have some news from France.
00:30:46.190 - 00:31:49.934, Speaker A: So the regulator of France, the regulator of financial markets in France, the AMF, basically suggested that the regulation on crypto should be done at the european level and not at the national level. So actually for crypto builders, this is a good news because that means if you have to comply to a crypto regulation in Europe, it will be done at the european level, not at the country level. So that would mean less work to do then some news for developers. So we're going to talk of Open Zeppelin, and Openzepling just released an integration with subgraph. So subgraph, this is this project to easily read data from the blockchain. And so now Openzepling has released an NPM package that allow you to read from subgraph really easily. So that's super cool because Openzepling has a big distribution across developers.
00:31:49.934 - 00:32:33.714, Speaker A: So it's probably going to increase a lot the adoption of a subgraph. And finally here we have this interesting piece of code. So this is a fee estimator that uses a new API of Ethereum eth underscore fee history. So basically you can estimate the fee after the London folk by using this snippet. So probably it's going to be used mainly by library like Webstery or wallet. So probably you're not going to use it directly as a blockchain developer. But if you are curious, if you really want to see under the hood how it's going to work, you can check out the code.
00:32:33.714 - 00:33:05.194, Speaker A: Okay, guys, so now we're going to do the Q and A. So very briefly, I mentioned once again. So tomorrow at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight, we going to have another live training on smart contract security. And we're going to learn how to create smart contract audits. So this is the highest paid skill in crypto? Absolutely highest paid skills. If you know how to do smart contract audits, I mean, you can make up to 200, $300,000 a year.
00:33:05.194 - 00:33:31.426, Speaker A: It's absolutely insane. This is not for beginners, I have to say. If you're beginners, don't start with this. We are really talking of the elite of blockchain developers. And so we're going to have an expert in cybersecurity that's going to teach us this. It's Suhel Msasi already did another live training on security with us and it went really well. We almost completely sold that.
00:33:31.426 - 00:34:08.890, Speaker A: So yeah, if you are interested, I put the link in the chat. All right. And now I'm going to scroll up and check out the question. Okay, so who do we have here? So we have Bleno Saga, Mahunas, Muibi, Sujan tiansheks, blano, Los fings batsman, crypto Michael atem. Hey, do you answer CDt themes question? Hope you do. Yeah. Okay, you can ask your question, Artem.
00:34:08.890 - 00:34:48.282, Speaker A: Now if you're still here, Matthew, we have Batman said, what about the self destruct devalue? Looks like gas token is dead. Oh, yeah. So Batman was referring to the upcoming updates in the London hard fork. So there is an upcode self destruct. So that so far allow you to destroy a smart contract. And basically because you reclaim some space in the blockchain, you have a refund. And so the whole gas token system that allow you to reduce your gas spending, this whole system is going to be dead because of this.
00:34:48.282 - 00:35:25.766, Speaker A: So if you use gas token, you have to move to something else. Javier Roman, can I make Twitter running on USDA? You can try. I've seen in machine learning that they try to solve every problem using this new shiny tech. And it's hard and usually fair. Yes. But for social media on blockchain, I think this is absolutely needed because when we start to see the crazy censorship on social media, this is really taking a bad direction, at least for me. So I do think right now one of the big failure of blockchain is that we don't have any success on social media.
00:35:25.766 - 00:35:45.070, Speaker A: So I absolutely want to see some social media based on blockchain. Ari Siswa hey, man. Matthew, are you going to talk about Thorback hack? Yeah, very briefly. I mentioned it. GSJ. Hey there, Julian and eat the blocks, gang. Hey, man.
00:35:45.070 - 00:36:17.918, Speaker A: Joe Biden, how do you think about the potential east and dodge merge and Vitalik meeting with the top Dodge Dev on the 20th of this month? I don't think much of it's been a joke since the beginning. I don't really know the point of the meeting with Vitalik. Maybe to do some buzz on Twitter. I really don't know about this. What is your opinion on Polkadot and Facebook partnership? Yeah. Cool. Let's see if they can give some boost to Polkadot.
00:36:17.918 - 00:37:02.194, Speaker A: So far there wasn't much traction on Polkadot. So yeah, it's good for them if they can help us, but not much to say on Polkadot. Matthew, I foresee a problem with NFT coming up. Really? What is this problem? Manhunas dogcoin increasing its community support over the globe. Sanche mjs hey there, you heard Ave is making a twitter like platform. What is your take? Okay, I already mentioned this before in the live stream. I think it's just a tweet from their CEO, but I don't know if he's serious.
00:37:02.194 - 00:37:34.558, Speaker A: I don't know if the community is interested. Maybe it's going to be a vote on the deal. Matthew Ideally, NFT metadata should be stored under storage contract. Curious as to how many people aren't doing this. You don't need metadata. It's what is being done right now. For example, if you have an image, you have the hash of the image which can be stored on the blockchain and the actual image outside of the blockchain.
00:37:34.558 - 00:37:50.590, Speaker A: That's one possibility. You can have the URL of a server stored on the contract. Also, Jeremy Hoser. No more CDBC please. Yeah, well unfortunately it's not really going in this direction. So. Yeah, 2021 definitely.
00:37:50.590 - 00:38:28.126, Speaker A: It's going to be the year of CDBC. Jv Roman I think the problem is people think NFT are immortals but they are hosted in some random thing. So maybe some NfT art could even be lost this way. Actually, NfT art, if the image is derived from all the data on chain, then nothing can be lost. Cm tanda thank you. Julian Moran JsG ethereum documentary featuring Vitalik Butterin raise 1000 is yes, I mentioned this. Bags.
00:38:28.126 - 00:38:57.466, Speaker A: Hi Julian, how are you bro? Hey man. Cm thunder I am mad at you Julian because you promised up to update the course last week. Okay, so I think you're talking of the course on profitable flash loans. So actually Batman is helping us on this. So normally we should have some news in two weeks. I'm very very sorry about this. I know I keep delaying but I just realized I need some help.
00:38:57.466 - 00:39:26.450, Speaker A: So now help is on the way. So we should have the code ready in two weeks. The video will need to wait a little bit more but yes, we are working on this. Finally. For real. Bax what you mean about vertical tree? Oh yeah, I know it's one of the new research thing of Vitalik but I haven't really looked at this. George Kenishi I've heard that polybuny was hacked.
00:39:26.450 - 00:39:54.422, Speaker A: Have you? No, I didn't check this hack unfortunately. Moran Kurdistan. Do you have information about ripple flare token? I don't know this token. Then Marco dot thought on coolcats reaching a 0.9 east floor in a short amount of time. I don't know this project. No Matthew interesting.
00:39:54.422 - 00:40:16.230, Speaker A: Smart contract security. Here are some tools. I don't know, maybe you didn't finish your sentence. Matthew coders bit hey man. Mark Anthony hey man. Also Matthew is saying also learn python. Why should we learn python? Matthew H two lsoft yo.
00:40:16.230 - 00:40:43.230, Speaker A: From Paris. Hey man. Grand car pub hi coders bit what about shib? Yeah, no shiba. Not much to say. And there was some activity, some news a couple of weeks ago when they did the airdrop to Vitalik and he burned it. But apart from this, not much to say. Daniel Miller how does staking vip 20 token work? It's not different from yes, 20 token.
00:40:43.230 - 00:41:11.346, Speaker A: You lock them in a contract and then it's up to you to decide how much new token you want to create. Isham. Exactly. Dodge is a joke. Yeah. Atem altu fiel here's my question on solidity. Is it possible to make east account creation using only solidity and front end technology like generic public and private key? Okay, so generation of account is done completely off chain, it's completely decentralized.
00:41:11.346 - 00:41:37.994, Speaker A: So you generate this with Javascript and the blockchain is absolutely not involved. So there are some risk of collision. But these risks are so low that it actually never happened. Psychedelic wizard hey bro. Is flashing with arbitrage and liquidity still profitable? It's not more or less profitable than before. You still have liquidator arbitrage and that still make a lot of money. So this hasn't changed.
00:41:37.994 - 00:42:12.938, Speaker A: This is actually correlated to a liquidity. So every time the price change a lot, you have a lot of arbitrage and liquidation opportunity. Then let me see. Platform mango, what is your opinion on Cardano? Are you going to do a course on Cardano? Maybe, but I haven't received a lot of requests at the moment so maybe, but not the priority. Grand Kapov julian but your lifetime pies love you. Keep educating us. Awesome.
00:42:12.938 - 00:43:12.202, Speaker A: Grandka Paul Ari Sishua hi julian, do you offer help for audit with your team? Okay, you can email Raphael at raphael@eattheblocks.com he's a member of my team that helps with that kind of request. Shuan Ketlai hey julian, normally where do you find those reliable sources on all the blockchain news? I was thinking to share all this info in my local language. I just go through the different newsletter, I just pay attention to Twitter and also I have someone to help me. Dan, who is a member of my team, so does a great job helping me every Monday. Yeah, so it really takes a lot of time every week to do this. Basically Isham Ahmed.
00:43:12.202 - 00:43:42.102, Speaker A: Should I learn solidity to write smart contract in ethereum or rest to write smart contract in Solana? If you're just getting started, definitely learn solidity and ethereum because that's by far the biggest demand on the market. Solanai is much more niche. It's still valid, but I wouldn't make it. This is not the priority if you're a beginner. Really? Isham. Matthew. Okay, he's answering to someone else soon.
00:43:42.102 - 00:44:49.242, Speaker A: Julie, can you do a video course on Mev? Maybe a live maybe. Maybe it's a good idea, but it's not easy to find good people to teach this mjs thought on the fox token based on shapeshift decentralized. I wasn't aware of their token, but I just think it's super cool to have this news of shapeshift just dissolving into a dao. I mean, this is really very cyberpunk and probably we're going to see more of this in the future. Aga Zero 80 Julian, any guidance on securing token farm against flash loan exploit? Wow, this is. This is. Okay, so you got to make sure that, for example, in your defi project, you use an on chain oracle, you're vulnerable to flash loan attack.
00:44:49.242 - 00:45:23.094, Speaker A: But if you use an off chain oracle. So basically an oracle that doesn't change in intra block, but only change between block, then normally a Flash loan cannot do anything to you. But I mean, I'm just speaking a little bit too fast here. So maybe there is another thing I haven't thought about, but that's the main issue is with on chain Oracle. Constantin. Hi, Julian. What do you think about masternode? Please? In terms of profitability, I think I lack of context here.
00:45:23.094 - 00:45:54.906, Speaker A: Masternode. It really depends masternode of which blockchain. So you really got to analyze this on a case by case basis. I would just say some people who run Master node makes money, some other not. Matthew Vitalik paper on MeV proposed separating block sequencer from block proposer. Okay, cool. So maybe this can be merged in ethereum one and we don't have to wait for Ethereum two.
00:45:54.906 - 00:46:11.320, Speaker A: That would be really cool. Mark, you start on building on polka dot moonbeam. No, not much to say. I haven't studied much polka dot, unfortunately. Thunjuli saying then it's making fun of. Exactly. Exactly.
00:46:11.320 - 00:46:50.340, Speaker A: Then Moran Kurdistan. When Idoblox token will be available to buy, I release the Beast man. Okay, so me personally, I do not handle at all the market of idoblox. Me, I've just airdrop it for free. I don't sell the blocks token, of course. So if you were in the airdrop initially, well, you should have some. Otherwise I do think this is listed on pancakeswap, but again, I don't manage this.
00:46:50.340 - 00:47:41.058, Speaker A: Oh yeah, by the way, some news for the ETB token guys. So we are doing a sort of a hackathon at the moment. So we're basically building an app to make the vote with the ETB token. There are several team that are working on this, and the team that produced the best voting app will have a reward of $1,000. So if you're interested in this, first, you can join the Facebook group of idoblocks, and second, you can check out in the GitHub repo of itoblocks. There is a folder on the ETB project. And so I explain everything.
00:47:41.058 - 00:48:23.290, Speaker A: So basically, now we're going to do this project regularly. I think we're going to do something like one project a month. And every week we do a Zoom call for the builders of the current project where we exchange ideas what to build next, if they have any technical questions for the current project. So yeah, check this out. If you're experience, that might be interesting. If you're a beginner, it's probably too complicated. Then what do we have? What do we have? Thx.
00:48:23.290 - 00:48:45.174, Speaker A: I never thought dogecoin was a scam. I don't think it's a scam. It's just a joke. Constantine, is it still possible to launch ICO in France? Or we should create an ieo? I think it's too late to launch an ieo anywhere. Sorry? An ICO anywhere? Yeah. Look at initial Dex offering. And even then, make sure you have your lawyer, everything.
00:48:45.174 - 00:49:00.406, Speaker A: Because now this is not 2017 anymore. You got to be careful. Ari is saying, have a good evening. Same man. Thanks, psychedelic wizard. We'll catch up to your profitable flash loan course soon, brother. You're awesome, bro.
00:49:00.406 - 00:49:17.780, Speaker A: Keep it up. Thank you. Varun Dusan. Hi. Is auditing similar to blockchain security? Yeah, it's basically when you learn blockchain security, smart contract audit. It's one of the top skill. It's like the niche in the niche, really.
00:49:17.780 - 00:50:05.934, Speaker A: Platform mango, when are you going to release advanced three t course? I don't know. This course has been put on hold because basically right now I'm delegating to other teachers. So instead of this, we probably will have a series on live training. So, for example, in advanced solidity, one of the sections was on security. Well, we do have two live training on security. So check out the live training instead. Grand Karpov is it possible to pay more attention only to solidity and not master Javascript web3 ether so you do have to master a minimum of javascript and web3 because for example for testing you cannot just do solidity.
00:50:05.934 - 00:50:44.586, Speaker A: For testing you need to know some Javascript, some web3, but you can focus most of your effort on solidity. Maybe it can be like 80% of your effort on solidity and 20% on the rest. In general, it pays more when you focus on smart contract instead of the front end because there are very few people who are skilled in smart contract. You'll find a lot of entrepreneurs. Maybe they took a boot camp on Javascript or on the front end. So maybe they can do a little bit the front end. But for smart contract they are always scared.
00:50:44.586 - 00:51:09.640, Speaker A: And that's where you as a blockchain developer, you can really realize your full value when you are being very rare on the market. GSJ muchas gracias bro. See you next time. See ya man. Kilian Mongi okay, so I'm translating because this is in French. I'm watching your course since a couple of weeks. Thanks for this precious information.
00:51:09.640 - 00:51:41.182, Speaker A: Thanks man. Aga 80 thanks so much. Trend Catlight thank you. Devan Shu Sega how to contact for business inquiry or collaboration so you have my email at the end of the description. Majunas thanks man. Meet you soon with brand new update awesome. Isham if you learn three t, will it help in writing smart contract using other languages? Yeah, because if you learn solidity, you'll learn how smart contract works.
00:51:41.182 - 00:52:01.302, Speaker A: But don't worry too much about other smart contract. Language like solidity is 99.99% of the market. So just focus on this. In the past, at some point we had some interest around Viper, but it's completely dead now. Now it's just solidity. Sunjun Li, you're the best.
00:52:01.302 - 00:52:16.390, Speaker A: True pioneer. Thank you. Thanks man. What do you think about convex finance? I haven't checked this project. Matthew. I feel so too. Motoko is a good second language.
00:52:16.390 - 00:52:25.514, Speaker A: I don't know this. Constantin. Okay, thanks for the answer. Interested in Cardano as well. Have a nice day. Thanks man. Hisham I will check it.
00:52:25.514 - 00:53:00.074, Speaker A: Thanks for the info. Constantino, is your DAP 30 course still available or is it too much deprecated and it's not actual? Today it's still very much valid because solidity, most of what you learn in the course, you can still use it. Today. I'm actually about to update Dap 30. If you want the link, you can send me an email at julian@idoblox.com the link is in the description. All right, guys, so I'm going to copy paste one last time.
00:53:00.074 - 00:53:17.162, Speaker A: The link to the live training of tomorrow on the smart contract audits. It's going to be at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. You can book your seats now. Okay, guys, thanks for coming tonight. A lot of people, a lot of questions. I love it.
00:53:17.162 - 00:53:22.038, Speaker A: Have a great week and see you soon on indoblocks. Bye, guys. Have a great week. Bye.
