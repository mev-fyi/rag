We just released Gamefi 101, a new course where you will learn how to build a Gamefi application on the Ethereum blockchain. You will have a really nice project to show on your portfolio. And tonight we are closing the registration for this new course, so you have less than 24 hours to get your hand on it. So if you are interested, check out the link down below. Bye.
