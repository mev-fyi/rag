00:00:03.050 - 00:00:46.410, Speaker A: And we are live, guys, welcome for this live stream on Ethereum and Defi news. If you don't know me, I'm Julian and you are on etherblocks, the best channel for blockchain developers. So we're gonna talk of Defi prices. And one of Defi news, a couple of stuff happened this week. We're going to talk of how we can value a governance token. So that's very important because now DeFi is all about this governance token that go to the roof. We're going to talk also of open, which is an insurance for Defi.
00:00:46.410 - 00:01:25.846, Speaker A: So let's get started. So here we are on DeFi pills to track the growth of all the DeFi protocols. We can see that the meteoric ascension to the moon is continuing, so we're going to soon reach $3 billion of market capitalization. That's really insane. It all started around mid June with the compound governance token. And since then it never stopped with all these other protocol that started to introduce their own governance token. So here we can see that we are climbing really steep once again.
00:01:25.846 - 00:02:07.826, Speaker A: So this is amazing. And this is especially amazing because during this time, if you see what's happening with the other coins, so bitcoin, et cetera, you go on coinmarketcap. It's quite boring, it's quite stable, but DeFi is making its own history. So that's really amazing. What's interesting to note is that compound went down a little bit and maker climbed back up to the first spot. That's normal because compound changed the rule for the yield farming. So it became a little bit less interesting to use compound for all the people who are doing some yield farming, but it's not really meaningful for the long term.
00:02:07.826 - 00:02:46.798, Speaker A: Compound is still an awesome protocol and apart from that, ave has grown a lot. Plus 50%. That's really insane. Balancer is also continuing his ascension and curve is just amazing. Plus 80%. So my guess is that very soon we will see curve in the top three and maybe in a couple of months or even faster than that curve might actually be at the top spot here. So then we're going to check a little bit the different coin, different defi coin.
00:02:46.798 - 00:03:32.320, Speaker A: So here we can see for the big change we have the synthetics governance token. Plus 13% ample force. Plus 20% ample force. So this is an alternative to make a deal or die. The big difference is that they don't change the supply, but instead they change the price to the adjustment and keep the price stable. So if the price of ample force go above one dollars. Then the price of each token is going to be divided but the supply itself is always going to be the same.
00:03:32.320 - 00:04:04.810, Speaker A: Then land token, it also continue to go up. Balancers, they started to do their liquidity mining and so their token is going up. So that's not surprising. And yeah, so we have some really nice gain for the defi tokens. So next let's have a look at the rate. It's always important to also check that. So die is still doing pretty well.
00:04:04.810 - 00:04:41.954, Speaker A: On ave you have a nice 7% if you lend your die. That's really amazing because a lot of people, what they do is that they log the eth into maker dao, then they rescue some dai, and with dai they use them for other things, other protocol. But if you don't know what to do with them then you can just lend them on ave. And this is pretty sweet. And you can see here that USDC is still below Dai. ETH doesn't really give you any good return. But that's not surprising because people don't use the ETH directly.
00:04:41.954 - 00:05:12.730, Speaker A: Usually in defi they prefer to use the dai. Yeah so that's it for the interest rate. And let's check out quickly the situation on compound. So yeah, total supply, total borrow has went down. Yeah, that's because now yield farming has moved to other protocols such as balancer. And here what I find interesting is if you see the market of DAi. So here you can see that the total supply is very similar to the total borrow.
00:05:12.730 - 00:05:49.100, Speaker A: And the difference between the supply apy and the borrow API is very small. But for other markets the difference here between the total supply and total borrow is bigger. And you can see that the difference in rates is also bigger. So if you want to have a tight spread here, you got to look the market where you have a very similar total supply and total borrow. Yeah, that's something I noticed this week. Okay, so that's it for the news on prices and rates. So now we're going to see the Defi news new thing that happened.
00:05:49.100 - 00:06:41.066, Speaker A: So first of all, the BZX protocol launch is governance token, BZRX. And it listed this token on Uniswap. So that's what we call an initial Dex offering an Ido. It's not an ICO, it's a new thing Ido. And there was a big issue that happened when they listed the token because there was one trader that made more than five hundred k in thirty minutes. And that's not a hack, he just used the spot contract. So what he did was revealed by Roman Storm, who is a security engineer working on a privacy solution.
00:06:41.066 - 00:07:36.862, Speaker A: I don't remember which one. So basically what happened is there is a crypto trader that started to spam the ethereum network to prevent traders from buying the token. And so he bought all the token himself at the low price and other people were not able to buy the token, so the price was artificially low. And when he bought all these tokens, after he stopped to spam the network, and then other people were able to buy from the Uniswap pool, so mostly from this trader. But now of course the price was higher and so he was the only liquidity provider and he made a lot of money. So yes, according to onchain data, he made half a million dollars. So yeah, that's pretty crazy.
00:07:36.862 - 00:08:05.990, Speaker A: He was able to do this and he didn't do anything amazing. That wasn't very sophisticated. All he did was just spamming the network with buy orders. That's it. So there are other Defi protocols that were thinking of also doing the idea. Initial this Dex offering for the tokens. But after this happened, they have delayed operation because they want to take some time to understand what happened next.
00:08:05.990 - 00:08:59.570, Speaker A: We have Ave who revealed that they made a $3 million talking sale with one with a VC. So that's a little bit unusual. We haven't really heard about this before. Usually the investment of VC, they are not in DeFi tokens, but they are in a share of the actual company. So here we can see that for the first time a VC has invested directly in a DeFi token. And so I think that's very bullish because usually VC do things that are smart, so it's always better to follow the spot money. So probably in the next few weeks or months we're going to see more news like this, deals between VC and DeFi protocol, where they buy large quantities of token.
00:08:59.570 - 00:09:44.710, Speaker A: And of course this is always very bullish for tokens. The Avi token kept increasing after this announcement. Another cool thing this week in Defi is rari. So that's a new government's token in the NFT space. So for gaming, you probably heard of Opensea, the marketplace for NFT and Ethereum, but there's also this other project, I don't know how to say. So they are the first one to introduce the idea of a governance token, but for NFT. So this is basically liquidity mining, but apply for gaming in blockchain.
00:09:44.710 - 00:10:21.986, Speaker A: And so it has just started. So if you have missed some yield farming opportunities for other protocol, then you can get some with the rari token. We don't know yet how it's going to play out for game. Is it going to be as successful as for DeFi? But that's an interesting experiment. That's really cool to see that games are emulating what we're doing in Defi. Okay, so that was it for the important news of DeFi this week. And so now I would like a.
00:10:22.008 - 00:12:09.510, Speaker B: Little bit to talk about governance token and how to value them, because we saw all these governance token really going up and so people are really excited and they want to buy a lot of governance token because they think they're going to go to the moon. Of course there is the risk that it's a bubble. So how can you evaluate if the price of the governance token is right or not? So governance token actually are a little bit similar to what we find on the stock market. So when you have the company, you have different class of stock, you have the common stock, and you have also other kind of stock where they're just voting stocks, but you can have dividends, they don't give you the right to have dividends on the company. So I would say that governance token are a little bit hybrid because they give you both voting rights and in some cases they also give you some interest. Let's start with the interest, because that's probably the easiest to evaluate. So if you know that there is a governance token that gives you some interest, some share of the transaction fee of a DeFi protocol, well, what you can do is you can take an average of the trading volume over the past, I don't know, six months or one year, and then you calculate how much of this ended up as fee that was paid to governance token holder.
00:12:09.510 - 00:12:57.750, Speaker B: And after you can divide the amount of money that is given per token. And so with this, that gives you a figure, and you can compare this figure with other governance token. And so it's difficult to have an absolute meaning of this figure, but if you compare it with other token, then you start, perhaps something interesting. So this is just a part of the valuation for your governance token. The other part is what's the value of being able to vote for the token. And that one is a little bit difficult to evaluate.
00:13:00.010 - 00:13:01.414, Speaker A: Because really that really.
00:13:01.452 - 00:14:05.130, Speaker B: Depends on what's your personal interest in the token, in the DeFi protocol. So this one you can basically compare between different protocol. See, like in a protocol, how much for one token, what's the percentage of the vote you get and how much money you need to pay for that. Okay, so let me put it a little bit more simply. Let's say if you wanted to have 1% of the vote for coupon, how much would it cost you? And then if you wanted to have 1% of the vote for another protocol, how much would it cost you? And so by comparing this value, you can have an idea of which governance token is more expensive or not. So yeah, that's my non scientific attempt at valuing governance tokens. But we don't have much else at the moment.
00:14:05.130 - 00:14:07.386, Speaker B: So we need to have something, we.
00:14:07.408 - 00:15:00.414, Speaker A: Need to try things to do these valuations. Okay, so next I wanted to tell you guys about this new DeFi protocol oping. So that's basically insurance for DeFi. That's very cool because I introduced options to the blockchain. So actually I used to work in equity derivatives in banks. So when I see all of this I feel very familiar and yeah, I see finally options are coming to blockchain. So what's the problem here? Let's say that you have your ETH, all the tokens and you are afraid that the price will go down, but you still want to keep your ETh because maybe the price will go up.
00:15:00.414 - 00:15:40.774, Speaker A: So how can you solve this dilemma now? Well, you can buy an insurance and you can do this by using options. So options are used in traditional financial markets. Maybe some of you know, what's an option? Maybe some other, I've just heard about it and don't really know how it work. So I'm going to explain you very briefly how it work. So you have two kind of option, call option and put option. So for call option, that's a financial instrument that gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy an asset at a certain price. So it works like this.
00:15:40.774 - 00:16:25.254, Speaker A: You have to pay some money in order to buy the option. Here in this example, you buy an option. So we said the option premium, you buy it at 120 and it gives you the right to buy for example a stock. So here in the example, this is a stock, but it could be a token at a price. So we say the strike price of 25. So if the price of Microsoft is above a certain value, so it needs to compensate for the premium, then you start to make money and you can actually make a lot of money. And so that's the idea of a call.
00:16:25.254 - 00:17:03.954, Speaker A: Now what's a little bit difficult to understand is that you can be long a call, so you can buy it or you can sell it. So in this case the payoff is a little bit different. If you sell it, that means that you make this profit. So you receive the option premium up to the strike price. And if the price of Microsoft goes up, then you gradually lose money. So here, the more the price of Microsoft goes up, the more you lose money. Because you have to pay the person that is long the call.
00:17:03.954 - 00:17:42.400, Speaker A: The person that bought the call. So that's a cool option. And then we also have a put option. So a put option. This is the contrary. That gives you the right, but not the obligation to sell an asset at a certain price in the future. And so here that means that with my long put option, basically I will make money.
00:17:48.070 - 00:17:49.106, Speaker B: If the price of the.
00:17:49.128 - 00:18:19.290, Speaker A: Asset decreased below a certain strike price. So that means that even though if I really own the asset, actually it will be compensated by the payoff of my put option. So this way I can be insured that I will not lose money if my asset lose money. And so, like for call option. Like for call option. Sorry. You can be long or put or short for put option.
00:18:19.290 - 00:18:55.974, Speaker A: So here, if I buy an insurance, I'm long. But if I sell the insurance, that's the contrary. The payoff is symmetrical here to the horizontal axis. And so in this case, I make money if the asset increase in value or stay put. And I lose money if the asset decrease in value. Because I have to reimburse the person that bought the put option or that bought the insurance, if you want. So what we can do is use this put option to insure ourselves against if.
00:18:55.974 - 00:19:30.494, Speaker A: And there are a couple of things to understand about option, how to value them. So this is actually quite complex. So there is something that is called the delta. So with the delta, you have to understand that the value of an option depends on its price of the price of the underlying asset. So for a call option, the more the underlying asset goes up, the more the value of the option goes up. And this is the country for a put option. Next you have what we call the Vega.
00:19:30.494 - 00:20:16.400, Speaker A: So that's the sensitivity to the strike price. So the strike price is basically the reference from which you start to make money or lose money. And so depending on the strike price, then we'll have a different value for the option. So if I sell you an option where, let's say like now ether trade at 230 and the strike price is 230, this will have a certain value. But if another option for 240 will be cheaper. Because right now I can't really make any money with this option. So when you value option, you always have to consider the strike price.
00:20:16.400 - 00:20:41.562, Speaker A: And then you also have to consider time. So an option is more valuable if, if it has an expiration that is in the long term. Oh yeah. So that's something that I haven't mentioned. So when you buy an option, it has an expiration. And so you have two kind of option. You have european option and american option.
00:20:41.562 - 00:21:36.934, Speaker A: So with european option, you can only exercise them when you reach maturity, and with american option you can exercise them whenever you want. So if you buy them today and you can exercise them tomorrow after tomorrow up to a certain point. And so if you have very long maturity for your option, that means that it gives you more chance for your option to be valuable at some point. And so that means the price of the option should be bigger. So when you buy your option, it has a certain value, but as time passes, just because the remaining time is less and less, then this will make the price of the option go down. So that's why if you want to buy some longer term option, this is always more expensive. And finally, to tie together, there is a pricing model that is called black and shawl.
00:21:36.934 - 00:22:36.654, Speaker A: So that reminds me of my day in finance. So we use this mathematical model to price an option. You don't have to actually understand how this work to buy and sell option, but it's good to know that it exists. And what's really difficult with option is that a lot of parameters depend on each other or are related on each other. So for example, if you see that maybe that the volatility will increase but the price will decrease, if you combine the different effect of different factor, you might have very surprising result on the price of the option. So the reason why I'm saying this, because it sounds easy, when you see the website of open, you just say, okay, I'm going to sell or buy this option, I get it. But the thing is, these options are more complicated than what you think.
00:22:36.654 - 00:23:28.800, Speaker A: So here this is the interface of open, and here that's how you would hedge your Ethereum risk, by buying a put option. So here we can see that we have different strike price with different expiry. So here I have a very short expiry in a couple of days with a strike price, which is a little bit below the current east price. And if I have a longer maturity, then the strike price is even below, is even lower. And that kind of makes sense because if we have a longer maturity, it's more likely that the final price, this option will be in the money. So we decrease the strike price, you can buy or sell this protection. So here we are in buy, but we can also sell it.
00:23:28.800 - 00:24:42.230, Speaker A: So sell it is if you don't think that ether will go below this value, 230. So in this case you can sell insurance to someone and here they tell you how much collateral you have to provide, and hopefully the price of Ethereum will not go down below 230, and so you will just earn the premium and you will not have to pay anything. But if it does go below 230, then some of your collateral is going to be seized in order to reimburse in order to pay the person that bought the option. So really you have to understand that it can be very risky to be a seller of a puta, seller of option in general, and you can also be a seller of a call option. So if you do this, this is the other way around, you lose money if the price of Ethereum goes up. And you have to understand that this is even more risky because in this case sky is the limit. So the price of ether can go really high.
00:24:42.230 - 00:25:27.654, Speaker A: And so potentially what you'll have to pay to the other party can be infinite. Of course it's never going to be infinite, but the range on the upside is way bigger than on the downside. So it's very risky to sell a call option. And another thing I wanted to show you here, so yes, you have call and put option, and they also have documentation for the protocol they are using. So they are using a protocol called convexity, and so anybody can interact with their spot contract. So here they have their documentation. Actually, I might do a video just on this in the future, because I think that's super interesting.
00:25:27.654 - 00:26:08.862, Speaker A: If you are excited by this, let me know in the chat. That's it for the open protocol. Then we'll go quickly over the news for developers. So I didn't find too many things exciting this week, except I saw this new library, snarkjs. This is a JavaScript library to implement zero knowledge proof. To implement zero knowledge proof. So I think it works in the front ten in the browser and in node js.
00:26:08.862 - 00:27:06.902, Speaker A: And so the news of this week is that they've implemented a part of their feature in Webassembly, so that's like a more efficient version of JavaScript in the front end. I know that what I said is technically wrong, but just to make it simple, that's a way webassembly, a way to make your JavaScript code run way faster. But I read a little bit the description of this and I think this is still a little bit too low level for your everyday run of the mill developer. So I think we need some higher level framework that make use of this library because I really wasn't able to build anything just with the description here. If you start to read they say something like including the universal powers of Tao ceremony. Wow, that sounds like very, I don't know, edgy to me. But if you're into privacy you can have a look.
00:27:06.902 - 00:27:39.550, Speaker A: And another cool stuff I saw is a tutorial of conveys for how to build on DFI with USDC. So there is nothing magical about USDC. This is an ES 20 token. So if you know how to manipulate ES 20 token, you know how to manipulate USDC. But they show you how you can get some testnet USDC. So that was the valuable thing that you can learn on this tutorial. And they also use ether js.
00:27:41.170 - 00:28:14.182, Speaker B: Okay guys, so now we're going to do the Q A. So let me check all the message. Whoa, a lot of message today. Hi Samad crypto traders van Lightspoon, Chloe, Ena, Batman. So yeah, I see some people who said they're interested in me doing the tutorial on open. Cool. So what people are saying your face is covering most of your shot.
00:28:14.182 - 00:28:49.730, Speaker B: Oh man. Okay, my bad. I'll make my face smaller in the future when you think ethereum 2.0 will be ready. I don't know, they already said that probably they will delay the launch of the first testnet this year. When I say testnet, I mean stable testnet because they already have some testnet now, but they are what we call Alpha testnet, meaning they are short lived testnet that they can kill at any time. I don't know, maybe at the end of the year we'll have the first stable testnet.
00:28:49.730 - 00:29:05.434, Speaker B: Otherwise early next year I think. Thanks for the content, Julian. Yeah, thanks Chloe. Sve. Hey, you're great. Keep on the great work, okay? Happy to join. Hey sama, doing your course these days.
00:29:05.434 - 00:29:32.638, Speaker B: Your content is awesome. You're a great mentor. Hey, thank you, Samath. All right. Okay, guys, well, if there aren't any more questions we're going to stop here. So yeah, don't hesitate to tell me in the comments what you want me to cover for the next live. Oh, question here, do you expect the price of Peter? Yeah, for sure.
00:29:32.638 - 00:29:53.810, Speaker B: When we'll have some positive announcement for ethereum 2.0. Of course, most likely that will make the price of ether goes up, but we can never be sure of these things. It really depends. Okay, guys, well thanks for following and I'll see you for my next live stream. See you soon, guys. Bye.
