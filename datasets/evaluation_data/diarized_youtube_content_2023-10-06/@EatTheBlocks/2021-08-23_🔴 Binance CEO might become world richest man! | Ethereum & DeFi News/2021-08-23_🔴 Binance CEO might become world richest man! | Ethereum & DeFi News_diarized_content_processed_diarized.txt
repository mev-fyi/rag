00:00:07.190 - 00:00:38.578, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi. For those who don't know me, I'm Julian, your host and on the blocks I teach blockchain development. Hi everybody. In the chat we have Salvatore Georgia. Ciao Pizza Bella Tshx, Jim Bob, synapses nervosa. All right, so first for those who are new here, if you want to become a professional blockchain developer, take my free training.
00:00:38.578 - 00:01:19.634, Speaker A: This is a series of email that's going to give you some extremely useful tips to find your first blockchain job. And second announcement. So we are releasing a new project. This is token maker. So this is basically allow you to create your ERC 20 token visually with no code. You have a couple of options, you can customize your token. So if you don't want to create your token yourself and you want something quick and easy, check it out.
00:01:19.634 - 00:02:04.080, Speaker A: I posted in the chat as well. Next we going to start with the price of Ethereum. So this is another good week even though it wasn't as spectacular as last week. But yeah, now we are well above 3000 and maybe in a few weeks we will reach 4000 again. So everything is going well and in general going towards the end of the year. Usually this is very good for crypto market and when we look at the gas price. So we picked out one week ago and now we are going down a bit.
00:02:04.080 - 00:02:57.802, Speaker A: And here we have an interesting chart that shows the evolution of gas price since the London hard fork and the introduction of EIP 1559 that changed the rules for the calculation of gas. And so you can see that the main effect was to reduce the volatility. So not necessarily to reduce the peak. So the peak are as high as before but this is less volatile. So this is a better user experience for user because user don't need to start to wait for a specific time in the day when the gas price are better. It's an evolution. Next I wanted to show you this dashboard that analyze the Ethereum network according to the different clients.
00:02:57.802 - 00:03:26.134, Speaker A: So here you can see the vast majority of clients. I guess you can also see the most popular operating system for miners. So most people are mining on Linux, some people are mining on windows. Wow. They are courageous. And a couple of other stats. Then there is an update of ether scan.
00:03:26.134 - 00:04:22.170, Speaker A: So now they added this green bulb here next to transaction of type two. So transaction of type two they are the transaction that use the new rule of calculation for gas price because you still have the option to send the old type of transaction. Next, we have a release of a new client for Ethereum two that is called Lodestar. And what is interesting with Lodestar is that it's written in typescript. So if you want to dive into the code base of Ethereum, but you were afraid because most clients use like low level language like go or rush. Well, with Loadstar, this is typescript. So this is almost like a javascript, so that gives everybody a chance to dive into the code of Ethereum.
00:04:22.170 - 00:05:03.542, Speaker A: Okay, so next update, next news. So now Lido is available on Ledger Live. So Ledger live, this is an app that you use with your nano ledger hardware wallet. So basically with Lido, now you can stake your Ethereum directly from your hardware wallet. So let's make it more convenient to stake and also cheaper. Next, we have some news for Ethereum l two. So there is a new Ethereum l two scanning solution that is based on optimistic roll up.
00:05:03.542 - 00:05:34.286, Speaker A: And specifically they use the technology of the optimism project. So this new project is called the Boba network. I love the name Boba network. And they just launched their mainnet beta. And this is managed by a company that is called Enya. And they were already in the crypto space for a few years before they were a core contributor to the OMG network, which is another scaling solution for Ethereum. OMG network.
00:05:34.286 - 00:06:34.790, Speaker A: They were big in 2017, 2018, and recently we didn't heard a lot about them. But yeah, we see so many new l two scaling network popping up right and left. Next we have some news from Stocknet. So Stocknet is building a tool to transpire EVM to kero. So Kero, this is basically the virtual machine that they are using on their zero knowledge scaling solution. With this, I understand that we'll be able to directly take deploy our solidity smart contract to stocknet. So this is very good for adoption because the problem with all this zero knowledge scaling solution is that usually they have their own programming language for spot contract, but that's really a problem for adoption.
00:06:34.790 - 00:07:25.026, Speaker A: All right, so next we have a new wallet that is called tally that is coming up. So this is the two main characteristics. This is a wallet owned by the community. So they are very decentralized and also they are super focused on defi and also they really don't like metamask. Apparently, tally is a community owned and operated web three wallet building off the road of the early metamask team. Okay, so meaning that they don't agree with the decision of Metamask recently. What they don't like especially was, let me see, there was this commit in August last year where basically metamask changed the license.
00:07:25.026 - 00:07:57.582, Speaker A: So before it was an MIT, very permissive license, you can do whatever you want. And after they used another license where basically you cannot use their code if this is for a commercial wallet. And because they wanted to protect themselves from a competitors, which is unnerstable. But yeah, the team of tally doesn't like them for that. And. Oh yeah. So here also they point out there was this line of code that was added in metamask infrared block key.
00:07:57.582 - 00:08:42.826, Speaker A: So potentially that could indicate that metamask is preparing to block certain countries. So tally is saying we will never block any country. We'll be much more open, much more community based. And when you look at the first screenshot, it looks pretty good to me. So it kind of makes me think of like the Arjun wallets, but distributed as a chrome extension. So we'll see what happened. It never hurt to have one more wallet, but I just hope that they're not going to start to have a different API compared to Metamask because it's going to be one more wallet to integrate for our DAP and it's going to make everything more complex.
00:08:42.826 - 00:09:07.750, Speaker A: So, yeah, I hope they stay in line. All right, so next, let's see the d five market. So we have reached a new high. So, not sure this is all time high, but we are getting close to the all time high. That was roughly mid May. Yeah, 80, 87 or maybe 90 billion, something like this. So yeah, we are getting really close.
00:09:07.750 - 00:09:27.162, Speaker A: So that's great. And in terms of the number of ETH locked in Defi, this is also going up. Then in terms of the biggest market cap for the DeFi project. So Ave is still number one. Instadap curve. Uniswap yasm climbed back. So Uniswap used to be number one.
00:09:27.162 - 00:09:58.034, Speaker A: Now lead number six. Sushiswap still below Uniswap, so not much change in the ranking. And when it comes to DfI on binance, smart chain, so we can check Dfi station. And it's also growing. So 30 billion, but still way below Ethereum. So roughly one third of Ethereum. All right, so next, let's check out the price of the DFI token.
00:09:58.034 - 00:10:23.242, Speaker A: So that was a really great week. So Pangolin plus 200% coin, 98 plus 100%. Nerve finance plus 100% loop ring. So this is a decentralized exchange deploy on its own. Zero knowledge network plus 50%. Luna also is doing well. Trustwap.
00:10:23.242 - 00:11:25.582, Speaker A: And when we check out the loser so cream finance, harvest finance, ample force, badger Dao. But that was difficult to lose money this week, really. All right, so next we're going to continue with specific news for DeFi project. And first we have one each network that is expanding to optimistic Ethereum, which is one of the top l two scaling solution for Ethereum, one inch, which is the top aggregator on Ethereum. So now they're going to be on optimistic. And so I'm guessing that if you use one inch on optimistic, it's going to be connected to the decks of optimistic only, but not the one on Ethereum. So next we have a new project that was launched.
00:11:25.582 - 00:12:15.422, Speaker A: It's called beta Finance. So this is not live on Ethereum mainnet. So this is a lending protocol that has a spatial feature, it allow you to short sell your token. Next we have this article of Andre Conrey, who is one of the most famous builder in the space. And so he's basically explaining how we could change liquidity mining by giving out options instead of the asset itself. Because the problem with liquidity mining is that people who are just interested in making money, but they don't really care about governance, they just tend to sell the token right after they earn it. And so that's not good for the price of the token.
00:12:15.422 - 00:13:19.378, Speaker A: So if instead we gave some option with a strike price, which is not at the money, but a little bit out of the money, that will somehow protect against this. So maybe the future of liquidity mining then some news from green finance, which they are changing their governance token to a new one, and the new one will be non transferable, will be non tradable. So basically it will really remove the financial value because you cannot make money of it. The only way you can profit from it is if you really care about the governance of the token. And so that's valuable to you, but you won't be able to transfer it. Then some news for hacks. So this week there was a vulnerability that was found in one of the smart contract of sushi swap, that's called Mizo.
00:13:19.378 - 00:13:45.054, Speaker A: There were about $350,000,000 that were at risk. So Miso is not, this is not the main smart contract of sushi swap. This is not related to trading, but if I remember well, I think this is related to the launch pads. Basically this allow you to launch new project. Yeah. So it's like a side project of sushi swap, but still 350,000,000 at risk. That was huge.
00:13:45.054 - 00:14:29.310, Speaker A: But anyway, that's fixed now. Next we're going to continue with NFT. And we have this new stat that came out. So OpeNC has not surpassed HC in terms of volume, was 1 billion traded in August. So that's really crazy because, you know, HC, that's a company that was launched, I don't know, like maybe five or ten years ago. And with way more employee, way more high profile than OpeNC, way more mainstream media coverage, and you can see how fast everything is growing on the blockchain. This is really insane.
00:14:29.310 - 00:15:20.926, Speaker A: Okay, so next we're going to continue with an update on crypto punk, cryptopunk, which is one of the top NFT collection out there. And so cryptopunk announced that they will migrate their image on Shen. So currently what they do is that they compute a hash of the image, they store the hash on Chen and the actual image is hosted outside. But in the future, the image will be stored on chain. Actually, each cryptopunk doesn't need so much space. So for cryptopunk it's going to be doable. And so it will make cryptopunk more sustainable because now you know that you don't rely on an external server to see the image of your cryptopunk, cryptopunk again.
00:15:20.926 - 00:16:00.730, Speaker A: So Visa announced that they bought a cryptopunk of $150,000 and why they did this. So I quote the article. So cryptopunk pioneer, the NFT technology and the wave of NFT commerce. So visa wanted to own a punk. The decision was less about the individual punk, but more about cryptopunks in general, given that it is a historical NFT project. All right, so next we are going to continue with enterprise blockchain and regulation. And we have some news from the CFTC in the US.
00:16:00.730 - 00:16:43.400, Speaker A: So this is one of the top regulator and they've indicated that they consider Ethereum to be a non security commodity. So that's good for Ethereum. We heard many times that the US regulators don't consider Ethereum as a security. Next, we have some news from binance. Good news, which is good because recently there were only bad news for finance. So finance is considering obtaining investment and protection from government funds at a valuation of 200 billion dollar. And Singapore is one of the most likely options.
00:16:43.400 - 00:17:38.886, Speaker A: And CZ, the CEO, owns 92% of the share of finance. So if these deals go through, that means that his personal net worth will be equal to $184,000,000,000 and he would become the richest man even before Elon Musk. That's really insane in terms of if this really happened, you guys have to realize, like in terms of speed usually to become the richest man in the world, it just takes decades. And now with blockchain and binance, binance was actually the fast, I think it was the fastest growing company in history or something like this. So yeah, if these deals go through, that would be really insane. And what's interesting is to compare Coinbase and finance. Of course, they are the two biggest centralized exchange.
00:17:38.886 - 00:18:32.502, Speaker A: And so Coinbase profit in the first quarter was about 800 million and its current market value is 54 billion. And finance profit is about four time the one of Coinbase. And so the valuation is also multiply four times to about 200 billion. Then some news from binance again. So binance is going to impose a KYC for all user because before, basically it was possible to create your account on binance with just your email. But recently they started to face a lot of regulatory scrutiny and so they are tightening everything on binance. Then we have some news from Immutable X, which is one of the top l two scaling solution for NFT.
00:18:32.502 - 00:19:30.906, Speaker A: And so they were planning initially to reward american user with their own token, but because they're a little bit afraid that the regulators won't be happy, instead they're going to reward them with ether. Okay, so next we have this news. Twitter is going to start a project to create a decentralized social media. And next we have this interview of Vitalik on Bloomberg. And he actually comments on the plan of Twitter to build the decentralized social media. And generally speaking, he's very skeptical of all the effort of all this social media to get into blockchain. For example, when you come to Twitter.
00:19:30.906 - 00:20:29.378, Speaker A: So I think Twitter, they have several projects on the blockchain, but for one of them, they basically want to bring Defi to bitcoin. But yeah, it really makes no sense because bitcoin doesn't have native capabilities contrary to Ethereum. So that's what Vitalik is explaining. Next, we have some news from Coinbase that said that going forward, they will allocate 10% of their quarterly net income into crypto assets. So Ethereum, DFI, token and many other crypto, and they are the first us publicly traded company to have ether on their balance sheet. Next, we're going to continue with news for all the blockchain and we're going to cover Cardano. So Ada is doing super well right now, super hot.
00:20:29.378 - 00:21:18.922, Speaker A: And this is ahead of the Alonzo fork in September, which will bring smart contract functionality. And all the indicators show that the token is super overbat at the moment. So yeah, everybody's expecting a big, big correction for Cardano. Next, there is this interesting project. It's called Open Front End. So this is basically a project to create open source front end for different defi projects because we see more and more defi projects that block users based on their location. We saw that with Uniswap a couple of years ago, but there were a couple of other projects that follow suit.
00:21:18.922 - 00:22:11.934, Speaker A: And so with this, the idea is to have all these open source front end so that if any official front end is blocked, then anybody can quickly deploy their own front end. And what's really interesting for developer is that there are bounties of eight k to start building a front end. So if you are good for the front end, check it out then with this new EIP which is being discussed. 37 22 posture. So this is an EIP for decentralized social media. And it's very simple. The idea is that for decentralized social media we want to commit the data on the blockchain, but we only need to have the blockchain log it.
00:22:11.934 - 00:22:47.150, Speaker A: That's it. And the cheapest way to do this is by using Ethereum event. So that means that you post your data on the blockchain as an event and after you'll have a front end that listen to all these events and rebuild the thread of messages in the right order. But that also means that it won't be possible to change your message after all. Right, so next some news about it online. So this is going to be one of the biggest hackathon. This is going to be in September.
00:22:47.150 - 00:23:19.922, Speaker A: So it's a great way to showcase your skill as a developer. And then we have this update of remix. And so they support the new type of transaction. So type two transaction. So that's the transaction with EIP 1559. And finally we have an update for open Zeppelin, the solidity library. So in this update they've released a modular system of contract for on chain governance.
00:23:19.922 - 00:24:05.666, Speaker A: And this is all based on Governor Alpha and Governor Bravo, which are two governance smart contracts of sushi that are very used by many other projects. All right, so now we're going to continue with the Q A. Yeah. So briefly, very quickly, if you are new here and you want to become a professional blockchain developer, I highly suggest you to take this training. This is a short series of email with super useful tip if you want to get your first job in the industry. All right, so let's scroll up and let's see what we have. Okay, Salvatore.
00:24:05.666 - 00:24:13.074, Speaker A: Hello master. I'm there every Monday. George hi, everyone. Ciao, pizzabella. Hello, guys. Tshx. Hey, Julian.
00:24:13.074 - 00:24:24.086, Speaker A: Nowadays we can win crypto for uploading music to TikTok using Ogis. Cool. I didn't know. Jim Bob. Hello. Julian Chow, Pizzabella. Visa battle crypto punk.
00:24:24.086 - 00:24:37.210, Speaker A: What a day. Yes. Synapse nevosa gutentag Salvatore. I'm preparing a joint to enjoy the video. Shiv. Nanda. Hi, Kimberly.
00:24:37.210 - 00:25:00.600, Speaker A: Hi, Julian. Greetings from Miami. Hi, Kimberly. Wondering about your recommendation for the best cold storage wallet. I think you mean hardware wallet. Yeah, Ledger is good. It's just that Nano Ledger, the user experience isn't great because the screen is very small.
00:25:00.600 - 00:25:24.702, Speaker A: Another wallet that I've tried, actually, I have a video on my channel is a grid plus lattice one. So this is a bigger wallet where you have a big screen and you can see clearly what's going on. So, yeah, depending on your budget, I would go either for grid plus lattice one or nano ledger humor. Akil. Doing great, sir. Awesome. Tripati defi news.
00:25:24.702 - 00:25:52.034, Speaker A: Let's go. Yeah. Synapse consensus owned by Morgan. I get the distrust. Really? They're owned by Morgan? Maybe JPMorgan has a share, but I don't think they're the majority owner. But yeah, I mean, of course, consensus is going more corporate these days, right? Osval Tlos? I don't know. What's that? Is it the name of a project? Grand Kapov.
00:25:52.034 - 00:26:17.150, Speaker A: Hello, Julian. How much different is Ada smart contract from Ethereum? And do you think we can benefit from learning it? So I'm checking out Cardano right now. I don't have anything interesting to say yet, but probably sometime in the next few weeks, you'll hear about it. Yeah. When is hello from Malaysia? All right, very well. Short. Love you, bro.
00:26:17.150 - 00:26:47.122, Speaker A: Thanks, man. Asubi, how mining could possibly disappear? You mean mining for proof of work? Yeah, I mean most blockchain that are going from proof of work to proof of stake. Adrian Long, the new ERC 7210 80 for open ziplin was awesome. Okay. I wasn't aware there was an update. Someone from Bangladesh. I'm from Bangladesh.
00:26:47.122 - 00:26:58.758, Speaker A: Love you, bro. Thanks. Edwin Long. Good for game industry. ERC 721. I think you're talking about Jordan Greer. Thought on baseline protocol.
00:26:58.758 - 00:27:17.778, Speaker A: Haven't looked at it. All right, forex Shack. Love your work. Keep it up. Thanks. Okay, guys, I think we are reaching the end of the Q A here. All right, so thanks everybody for coming here tonight and I will see you another day on my channel.
00:27:17.778 - 00:27:21.950, Speaker A: Have a great week, everybody. Bye bye. Bye, guys. Bye.
