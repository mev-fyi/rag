00:00:00.330 - 00:00:53.430, Speaker A: Can you get a rate of return of 1 million% in DeFi? According to some defi project, yes. Lesson you can make a lot of money in DFI, but you can also lose a lot. So in this video I will explain the seven main investment strategies in DFI and tell you how much you can realistically earn and what are the risk with staking your lock your crypto in exchange for some interest? There are two kind of staking ether and ES 20 tokens. With ether staking, you can make an annual return of 8% on your ether. You get rewarded in exchange of securing the network by running a validator and locking your ether. You can run your own validator yourself, but it's a bit technical otherwise. You can let other people run a validator for you by using a staking pool like anchor, but that will take some fee.
00:00:53.430 - 00:01:34.934, Speaker A: There are a couple of risks with ether staking. If you run your own validator and you lose or don't protect well your private key, you will lose your ether. Another issue is that if your validator goes offline or you validate a wrong transaction, you can be penalized and lose a part of all of your ether. Another issue is that the rate of return continually goes down as more and more people stake their ether until it bottoms out at around 5%. Another risk is that your ether is locked, so if the price of ether drops and you want to sell it, it's not possible to exit your position. You have to wait until ethereum 20 is fully released in a few years. The other kind of staking is with ESC 20 tokens.
00:01:34.934 - 00:02:06.790, Speaker A: You can make a few percent annually for staking your tokens. When you stake ESC 20 tokens, you get some interest in exchange for locking your tokens. In a smart contract, you get rewarded for indirectly supporting the price of the token. While your tokens are locked, you cannot sell them, and this is bullish for the token. In terms of where you can find staking opportunities, it's not hard. Nowadays, most DeFi projects let you do staking with the governance token. Staking is simple, not very risky, but the return on investment is not very high.
00:02:06.790 - 00:02:48.674, Speaker A: In the next strategy, we are going to see something a little bit more exciting. In DFI, it's possible to lend your token. When you lend stable coins, you can earn between three to 30%, and if you lend ether or wrap bitcoin, it's usually much lower, up to a few percent. Only with lending protocol, you don't need to be matched against a borrower. When you lend your tokens, you just send them to a pool and you get in exchange an IOU token that you can use later to redeem your initial tokens plus the interest. Because borrowers need to post a collateral, the risk of not being reimbursed is pretty low. However, the risk is not zero.
00:02:48.674 - 00:03:25.642, Speaker A: If the price of a collateral decreases too quickly, there won't be enough time to liquidate the position of a borrower and the system can become under collateralized, which means you will lose some money. In terms of projects that do lending, there are many of them. On Ethereum, for example, you have compound and Ave. And on binance smart chain, you have cream finance. Lending is cool and you can make up to 30% a year, which is not bad at all. But can we go higher than that? Yes, we can. In traditional finance market there is a special kind of market participant called market maker.
00:03:25.642 - 00:03:59.746, Speaker A: Market makers make a lot of money. They provide liquidity, meaning that they allow anyone to buy or sell some asset at any time. A market maker constantly has buy and sell limit orders around the current market rate. They buy lower and sell higher. They constantly earn the difference between their buy and sell price. It looks easy, but to do this efficiently you need to have a lot of capital and a lot of expertise because you need to readjust your price all the time. In defI, everybody can be a market maker, even if you don't have the capital or the expertise.
00:03:59.746 - 00:04:40.658, Speaker A: We actually don't use the word market maker, but instead we say that we provide liquidity. All you have to do is send your tokens to a decentralized exchange. For example, if you provide liquidity for the ETH die liquidity pool, you provide 50% of eth and 50% of die. When traders want to buy or sell the tokens, they trade against the token of the liquidity pool at a price determined by the code of the smart contract. Traders have to pay a small fee of about 0.3% for each trade, and these fees are paid to liquidity providers. In some cases you can get a rate of return of 100% or more, but it's not without risk.
00:04:40.658 - 00:05:28.886, Speaker A: The first risk you take is the exposition of the assets in the liquidity pool. For example, if you are a liquidity provider for the ETH, a die pool, you are exposed to the price variation of the two assets. Another risk is called impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is a topic of its own, but in very simplified terms, it means that arbitrary can take advantage of big price movements to trade at bad prices and take value out of the liquidity pool, which means liquidity provider will lose some money. In general, the trading fees more than compensate for that, but sometimes not. And lastly, we also have the risk of a smart contract hack. Projects that allow you to be a liquidity provider are decentralized exchange like uniswap or sushiswap on ethereum or pancakeswap on binance smart chain okay, so it's getting more interesting.
00:05:28.886 - 00:06:08.654, Speaker A: By being a liquidity provider, you can earn some really high rate of return. But can we get even more than this? Yes, with yield farming you can get a rate of return of a few hundred of percent, sometimes even thousands. It's completely insane. There is no strict definition of what is yield farming. It's just a combination of other DeFi strategies. For example, one problem with DeFi strategies like being a liquid provider or lending, is that the rate you get changes at every block. One popular yield farming strategy is to reallocate your money to the most profitable defi project at every block.
00:06:08.654 - 00:06:51.226, Speaker A: However, if you try to do this yourself at every block, you would spend too much money on transaction fees and it wouldn't be worth it. Some projects do this reallocation automatically for you. That's what we call yield aggregator. Because these projects pull together the money of many people, they can afford the fixed cost of transaction fees for rebalancing the portfolio at every block. Yarn finance is the most famous yield aggregator on ethereum and on binance smart chain there is autofarm. Another interesting yield farming strategy is to combine different rewards. For example, on compound, when you lend token, you earn an interest rate, but on top of it, compound gives you a reward with the governance tokens to give you an extra incentive to provide liquidity.
00:06:51.226 - 00:07:19.958, Speaker A: That's what we call liquidity mining. There are many projects that offer liquidity mining. Usually when you see insane rate of return in DeFi, that's because of liquidity mining. But the rate of return with liquidity mining is calculated as if the price of the reward token stay the same the whole year. But that's not going to be the case. So for example, if you see an insane rate of return of 1 million%, it's just a theoretical rate of return. But your actual rate of return over the year likely won't be that high.
00:07:19.958 - 00:08:07.782, Speaker A: In general, with yield farming, everything is very short term. When a new strategy of yield farming is getting popular, you get some instant yields, but quickly it decreases and you have to rotate your fund to the next popular yield farming strategy. In terms of risk, yield farming is quite risky because you have to interact with many deFi protocol, which make you increase the chance of using a smart contract that will be hacked sometime. In yield farming, we're also leveraged, so in case of a market crash can be pretty violent. So clearly yield farming is not for beginners, it's for advanced defi users only. Next, I'm going to talk of a much more simple strategy with trading. You can have crazy returns, ten x 100 x on your initial investment, or even more.
00:08:07.782 - 00:08:27.774, Speaker A: Trading is simple. You just buy a token and wait for the token to appreciate. That's it. For some tokens, you can buy them in centralized exchanges, which mean you don't need to deal with wallets like metamask. You just click on a few buttons and that's it. In terms of risk, you can lose all of your capital if the price of the token drops. So you need to make sure you understand the project and you trust the team.
00:08:27.774 - 00:09:12.938, Speaker A: In terms of risk of hack, the code of an ES 20 token is pretty straightforward. If this is a standard implementation, it's impossible to hack an ES 20 token contract. However, if there is a function to mint more token and the admin of the project can execute this function, there is a risk. If the admin is a designed hacked, or he or she can mint more tokens, sell them, make a lot of money, and create a massive inflation for the rest of the token holders. Apart from this, even if the risk of hack is limited on the code of the ES 20 token itself, you are still indirectly exposed to the risk of hack of the other smart contract of the project. Because if they are hacked, investor will lose confidence in the project and the price of the token will drop. Trading is simple.
00:09:12.938 - 00:09:47.826, Speaker A: You can earn a lot if the token appreciates, but you can also lose everything. So you got to be careful. Next, I'm going to show you one of the most powerful way to make money in d five. With liquidation, you can make 100,000 of dollar in a single transaction. In 2020, the profits of all liquidators was in the million of dollars. To understand liquidation, we need to backtrack a little bit and explain the concept of collateral. In defi, in lending protocols like compound, when you borrow money, you also need to lock a collateral.
00:09:47.826 - 00:10:28.446, Speaker A: This is used to make sure that you will reimburse the loan. The value of the collateral needs to always be above the value of what you borrowed. There is a safety margin for the collateral requirements. For example, if you borrowed 100 die, which is about $100, the requirements of your collateral will be that it always stay above $150. If at any time the value of your collateral falls below the requirement limit, your account is considered not solvent and can be liquidated by anyone. In a liquidation, the liquidator reimbursed the loan and in exchange get the same value in collateral plus a bonus. This bonus is the profit of the liquidator.
00:10:28.446 - 00:11:06.462, Speaker A: For some big liquidation, this bonus can be pretty huge, 100,000 of dollar or more. In terms of risk, there aren't many. If you are not fast enough, and another address already liquidated the account you were trying to liquidate, your transaction will fail and you will lose a transaction fee. At most whiskey and gas price that are pretty high. We are talking of hundreds of dollars, but you never put at risk the amount of the liquidation. For example, if you're trying to liquidate a loan of $100,000, this $100,000 is not at risk in the liquidation process. So is it too good to be true? Well, you got to be really fast to be successful at liquidation, and this is quite competitive.
00:11:06.462 - 00:11:51.870, Speaker A: Next, there is another technique in defi which is pretty amazing. This is called arbitrage. With arbitrage, like for liquidation, you can make a lot of money, 10,000 of dollar, $100,000 in one transaction, or even more. The idea with arbitrage is that you will take advantage of a price difference for the same asset. So let's say that ether is trading at $2,000 on a decentralized exchange like uniswap, and $1,900 on another decentralized exchange like sushi swap. So in that case, you can buy some ether at 1900 on sushi swap and resell it on uniswap at 2000. If you do it with one eth, that's a profit of $100.
00:11:51.870 - 00:12:28.838, Speaker A: But if you increase the size of the arbitrage, you can see that it can rapidly make a large profit. In terms of risk with arbitrage, it depends on how you do it. If you do your arbitrage in two transactions, it's possible that the opportunity of the arbitrage disappears for the second leg of the operations. In this case, you will have the choice of either keeping the asset you just bought, but you are exposed to its price variation, or you resell it, but potentially at a loss. If you create a smart contract to do, the arbitrage is different. In that case, the arbitrage is atomic. Either you make a profit or the whole transaction is canceled.
00:12:28.838 - 00:13:09.970, Speaker A: If that's the case, only the transaction fee will be at risk, which is a few hundred bucks. Can everybody do arbitrage, like for liquidation, you have to be the first one to detect the opportunity and act on it. It's also possible for some miners to front run your transaction and steal your trade id. Out of all the Defi strategies I show you, the ones with the highest potential are liquidation and arbitrage. However, you need to have some capital for that, unless you use a defi instrument called a flash loan. Flash loans are really fascinating, and if you want to know how to make money in DeFi, you gotta know about them. And for this you can check out my series on flash loan.
00:13:09.970 - 00:13:10.660, Speaker A: I will see you there.
