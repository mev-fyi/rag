00:00:00.410 - 00:00:49.420, Speaker A: Hello. Welcome to this newsletter of Edoblocks, the first in 2019 and I'm sorry if it's been a while since my last newsletter, so I was on holiday but now I am back. So for this newsletter the first thing is smart contract security. So I release a new course on Edoblox Pro. If you want to write smart contract then check out this free so I've already published a couple of video on overflow, underflow default function, visibility front running, and I will also publish some other videos about intransy attack, Evilvar, keyword, and other stuff that I will publish in the next few weeks. So check it out. You can have access to this if you become a member of Edwox Pro for $10 a month.
00:00:49.420 - 00:01:46.174, Speaker A: Then the next thing is I've done an interview of the founder of Crypto Job List, which is one of the largest job board for crypto jobs. So if you're a blockchain developer and you're looking to find some jobs, then check out this interview and a lot of insight from the founder of Cryptojoblist. What is the current state of the blockchain industry and what is the best way to find a job? Then I found this cool tutorial on how to build a decentralized DNS system on top of Ethereum. So this is the part two. I've already mentioned this tutorial in a previous newsletter, but this is the following. So it's a pretty long tutorial, but very detailed. So yeah, really like it and nice website.
00:01:46.174 - 00:02:54.050, Speaker A: Also, then I find this article on the blog of Coinmonks, which is about an error that can happen in solidity, which is stacked too deep. So it's basically when you have too many variables in a function in solidity, then the compiler complaints this article deeps dive in the Ethereum virtual machine and explain you why this happens. It's pretty interesting if you want to understand the inner working of the Ethereum virtual machine, then I find this tutorial on how to write upgradable smart contract with Truffle and Zeppelin Os. So zeppelin Os. So you're probably aware of open Zeppelin, the framework for smart contract, but the same organization has also produced Zeppelin OS, which is a separate tool to basically manage your production deployment of smart contract. So you can think of it as an equivalent of what is this tool that we use on Ruby to deploy software? Oh, sorry guys, I'm having a blank. But basically it helps you to manage your production deployment.
00:02:54.050 - 00:03:41.726, Speaker A: It's pretty interesting. I'm actually going to do a tutorial on this on interblocks Pro pretty soon then there is a release of open Zeppelin 2.1. So the big news this time is that now open Zeppelin will work with solidity 0.5.0. So that's good because so far they've been lagging behind, they've been stuck with solidity four, but now you can use three DT five. So that's cool. If you use open Zeppelin that make sure to upgrade your smart contract. Then I find this tutorial on how to monitor Ethereum events using eventum eventum.
00:03:41.726 - 00:04:21.598, Speaker A: I've already shown this tool in a previous newsletter, so it's a tool that allow you to listen to ethereum events and stream this to Kafka on RabbitmQ. So it's a powerful tool, but it's not really easy to use. And so this tutorial is basically a very practical tutorial that shows you how you can string all the pieces together into a working system. So I find it quite interesting. It uses Docker compose. So with Docker compose basically you don't have much to set up, everything is automatic. So yeah, it's pretty cool to check this out.
00:04:21.598 - 00:04:58.358, Speaker A: And then I find this introduction to mitral classic and symbolic execution. So it's actually not so much about mitral classic, but it's more about what is symbolic execution, which is the underlying technique that mitral classic is using. So mitral Classic is a tool for analyzing smart contract. If you never heard about it. Next. So there is this new website which is called Eth Hub. So Eth Hub is a sort of online community for developers.
00:04:58.358 - 00:05:30.230, Speaker A: So in particular they want to build an extensive documentation for Vius, part of Ethereum. So that's a more approachable documentation for some of the most complex part of the Ethereum. So it's pretty cool. They have also a podcast that actually I've started to listen, it's called into the ethereum. I like it. They have a weekly newsletter, but the main part is the website with all the documentation. So here you can see, oops, the ascend, which menu doesn't.
00:05:30.230 - 00:06:14.494, Speaker A: Yeah, so here you can find like Lola of Doc in the development section. Then final link is a summary of the upcoming Constantinople update of Ethereum client. So it is due in actually just a couple of days. So it's not a big hot fork, it's a small hot fork. There is nothing too revolutionary. There is a new upcode in the EVM which is called create two that will be good for state channel and layer two solution. And the other changes are quite minor.
00:06:14.494 - 00:06:54.734, Speaker A: But if you want to know the detail, then check out this thread on Reddit. That's it guys. Thanks for following this video. And as usual, if you want to learn more about programming smart contract and decentralized application, then check out my website, idoblox Pro where I release a new video every week and for $10 a month you can get access to all the video. There are already 9 hours of content and I'm adding new content very quickly. So thanks for following and if you enjoyed this video, give it a thumbs up. And if you want to see more video like this, subscribe to the channel.
00:06:54.734 - 00:06:56.620, Speaker A: See you for the next video. Bye guys.
