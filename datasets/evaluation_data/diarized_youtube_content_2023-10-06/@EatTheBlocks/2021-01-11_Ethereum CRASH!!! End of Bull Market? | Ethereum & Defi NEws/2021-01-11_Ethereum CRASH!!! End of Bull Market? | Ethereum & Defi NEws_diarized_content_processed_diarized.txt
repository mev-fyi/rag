00:00:10.790 - 00:00:35.580, Speaker A: You. And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and defy. And I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. So in this video, I'm going to be talking of ether, going nuts. We almost reach all time high.
00:00:35.580 - 00:01:10.490, Speaker A: I'm going to be talking also of Ave Gochi, which is a new kind of game that is real game changer. Super, super important to follow this. Also super important news in the regulatory category. And if you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host. And on my channel, etherblocks, I teach blockchain development. So very quickly, here is my course if you want to learn defi development, but for that you need to know already blockchain development. And if you want to learn blockchain development, this is my other course.
00:01:10.490 - 00:01:57.018, Speaker A: Okay, so we are going to start with ether. So it was another crazy week for ether because we went above $1,000 and we reached almost all time high, which was reached in 2017. In 2017, I think it was something like 1410 or something like this. So we were really not far. But at some point also, we have to realize that we were really overbought. So it's really normal that we went down after this. So yeah, this is just a short term setback, probably now we're going to have a support at 1000 and we're going to have more accumulation from people.
00:01:57.018 - 00:02:32.200, Speaker A: And yeah, I'm really not worried about the setback we had. Hi people in the chat thx Cinebytes, Eric Alexander. Hi everybody. So in terms of gas price, because we're in this bull market. So the gas price is also in the bull market. So for the first time we saw some really insane gas price, like above 200 gray. So now Ethereum start to be expensive again, and that's a real problem, as we will see later for some project.
00:02:32.200 - 00:03:03.150, Speaker A: So let's see the situation for Ethereum 2.0 quickly. So we have approximately $2.5 billion locked in Ethereum 2.0. So yeah, it's really a lot of money that is locked super good in terms of how much you can make. Now it's close to 10% is slowly going down as more and more people are staking. And if you want to follow what's happening on Ethereum 2.0,
00:03:03.150 - 00:03:31.430, Speaker A: you check out beacon scan, which is a website of ether scan, but for ethereum 2.0. And so you can see a couple of data like basically the network participation chart. Super important. That tells you how many validators are online. You can see how many active validators we have here, almost 60,000. So as you can see, we're going to have many, many more validators on e 2.0 than we have miners on Ethereum one.
00:03:31.430 - 00:04:01.540, Speaker A: And that's on purpose. It's really to make the mining more decentralized. Even though we don't say mining for Ethereum 2.0. Here you can see the latest block, so you can see that everything's going fine. Like we have new blocks that are happening very frequently. Okay, so next let's see the situation for the Defi token. So we have a lot of green this week.
00:04:01.540 - 00:04:38.462, Speaker A: So here ieath, this is basically the invert of ether. So when ether is going down and ies is going up. So because ether just went down here, so ies is really going up. Then MKR the token of maker Dao. So the project of Dai went really crazy. 100% yam finance here, 55% saffron finance is basically really a roller coaster. Saffron finance like one week is going super high, the other week is going super low.
00:04:38.462 - 00:05:08.760, Speaker A: So yeah, personally I would not hold this token. Yeah, synthetics also has been doing really well. Synthetics has been going up in the ranking, so it's normal that it's going up. And then let's see the loser here. What about the loser this week? So we have less loser than winner. So that's good. Ample falls here is not doing well.
00:05:08.760 - 00:05:32.974, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, I don't know a lot of this token here, a lot of this loser, I don't know them. Yeah. Farm. This is a yield aggregator. Yeah. So more winner than loser this week. What about for the market cap of the market cap in DFI? Okay, so we were doing really well.
00:05:32.974 - 00:06:09.050, Speaker A: We reached at the top 23 billion something and then it went down because the price of Ethereum went down also. But one thing that I don't like is that actually the number of ether in Defi keeps going down. So I don't like this trend, but still, because the price of ether keeps going up. So we had this huge spike here. And so in terms of which project are winning. So maker now is really the leader. Ave solid second and uniswap.
00:06:09.050 - 00:06:34.738, Speaker A: Uniswap is back to its place, the most used decentralized exchange compound. Ave uniswap compound synthetics. I mean that really makes sense. These are the most like solid defi protocol and sushiswap. Now we can see a big gap between sushi swap and uniswap. It's normal but now we can see all the Defi protocol are red because ether is going down. Matic is doing well.
00:06:34.738 - 00:07:03.674, Speaker A: Matic is becoming more and more popular for games. Yeah. Okay, so next, let's see the rate quickly. What's the situation on the rate co crypto lending rate. So it's not as crazy as last week. Like last week was really insane, but still like tether on compound like 11.5% USDC on Avid 1362.
00:07:03.674 - 00:07:36.774, Speaker A: So yeah, we have some really nice right here. Okay, I quickly wanted to show you this thread. So it's this guy who said like he turned $800 into 1 million flipping shitcoin on Uniswap. So I don't know if it's bullshit or not, but it's quite entertaining to read it. I don't know, it seems legit, but it's just like, it seems so insane. High can go from 800 to 1 million. Maybe it was good, maybe it was not that good.
00:07:36.774 - 00:08:11.614, Speaker A: But yeah, I mean, check it out. I really enjoyed it. Okay, so now we're going to start to give news for Defi project. So we're going to start with future swap that introduced its beta. So future swap is a Defi project that offer perpetuals on chain. So perpetuals are derivative financial products a little bit similar to futures, but with no expiry date. So in a nutshell, with perpetuals you go long or short for an asset with a high leverage.
00:08:11.614 - 00:08:28.966, Speaker A: So on future swap, they offer you up to 20 plus 20 time leverage. It's really, really high leverage. You got to be careful if you use this. This is not for beginner. They originally launched an alpha version in April 2023, days after launching. The daily trading volume reached 7.1 million.
00:08:28.966 - 00:09:03.998, Speaker A: And the team of future swap was very surprised to grow so fast considering it was just an alpha launch with no audit in their smart contract. So they kind of freaked out a little bit that were a little bit too successful, too fast, and they decided to pull the plug and pause the project until they completed the audit. And it took more time just to make sure everything is fine. So during all this time since April, they've been working hard to improve their project. So now they feel ready. So they just announced they will do their beta launch soon. So their token is called FST.
00:09:03.998 - 00:09:40.618, Speaker A: And I didn't see any price yet, so I don't think it has been launched yet. I don't think they don't have any market, but it's basically one more derivative Defi project that is launching this year. We already saw a couple for options, but not many for futures. I think it's one of the few Defi project for future. So for your information, actually work for them, for their prototype. I think that was like one year and a half ago or something like this. And the CEO actually was one of my first student on Indoblocks.
00:09:40.618 - 00:10:11.038, Speaker A: He took my blockchain course. So, yeah, I'm quite proud to see this project being launched. Yeah. So I'm super happy when I see some students of mine being successful. That guy, he took my course and then he raised $1 million, and then he was able to hire people and build his project. So you can see that really, you can start from nothing and you meet investor and, yeah, it just takes off. Things can go really quickly in crypto.
00:10:11.038 - 00:10:57.026, Speaker A: Next I'm going to be talking of shapeshift. So Shapeshift was created in 2014 as one of the first noncustodial exchange. That means with Shapeshift, user never give their crypto to the exchange. So because they only traded crypto to crypto, there was no KYC requirements. That was really important. But in 2018, regulators forced them to add a KYC procedure. The reason was because shapeshift was acting as a market maker in the exchange, and apparently that was a reason to impose KYC.
00:10:57.026 - 00:11:46.258, Speaker A: So they've been doing KYC since all this time, but they said recently that they are not happy with the lack of privacy of KYC procedure and they want to get rid of them. So that's why from now on, they will change their business model and now they won't do any market making, but there will be only a Dex aggregator, like one inch routing orders to the Dex that offers the best price. So one inch gets some competition. They didn't talk of any token, but I think they'll probably introduce one. Yes. So that was shapeshift really one of the very, quite an old blockchain project that finally embraced DeFi. So that really show you how DeFi is becoming so powerful.
00:11:46.258 - 00:12:46.140, Speaker A: Like everything revolves around DeFi these days. Then some news about Aragon. So Aragon is one of the leader in terms of blockchain based governance system, and they focus on building a system of decentralized courts. So instead of having the system we have now, maybe in the future we will be able to go through smart contract for some litigation, arbitration, et cetera. So this week there was a mass resignation of developers at Aragon. So why they left? Because they were unhappy with a lack of transparency in the project. So before they left, there was like 52,000 ether from the project, initial ICO in 2017 that was moved onto various exchanges December 15 and December 22, and they didn't get the answer they wanted.
00:12:46.140 - 00:13:13.406, Speaker A: Apparently a bit of confusion there at Aragon. So actually there is someone who took my course who also work at Aragon. So I don't know if he's among the eleven people who quit. So I have to say, before this happened, I heard some bad things from Aragon. Not myself. I didn't have to deal with them myself. But this is things I've heard, for example, on Twitter.
00:13:13.406 - 00:13:54.346, Speaker A: I know a few months ago there was a scandal where there was basically some project that partnered with Aragon because Aragon has a sort of program where they finance some developers to build some stuff on top of Aragon. And so these are the projects. They built something on top of Aragon. And I was supposed to receive some funding from Aragon, but a part of this funding was never sent and there was like a big dispute from them. I also know about some ex employees and freelancer who used to work at Aragon and they gave me some bad feedback. Yeah. So quite a lot of bad news from Aragon.
00:13:54.346 - 00:14:23.690, Speaker A: So I don't really know what's going on with the project. I hope it doesn't collapse because it's really one of the first projects on Ethereum and it's really one of the leader for blockchain governance. So I think they're really important for the ecosystem. So yeah, let's wait and see what happened. But in the meantime, if you hold some Aragon token. Yeah, I wouldn't hold any personally, not right now. Then I wanted to show you this tool.
00:14:23.690 - 00:15:04.306, Speaker A: It's called sweepos. So it allow you to move all of your token in one transaction. So this allow you to save some gas fees, which is especially useful in this period of high gas fees. So for developers, it's really good example of a simple tool that you can create yourself just with one developer, you can do it and this can be useful for a lot of people and that's really a way to get your name out there. So yeah, I really like this kind of inspiration for developers. Then we're going to talk of NFT and games. We're going to talk of Ave Gotchi.
00:15:04.306 - 00:15:40.782, Speaker A: So it's a new blockchain game. It's a mix of defi and NFT. So with Ave Gotchi, you collect some characters that each have their unique features, a little bit like cryptokitties, and each character is backed by some. A token. A token? A token you have when you lend money to Ave. So with this Ave Gochi, NFT, you get some interest from Aave. So the value of the token has two parts, the value coming from the character, that depends basically on the traits, if it's more or less rare.
00:15:40.782 - 00:16:26.930, Speaker A: And the other part is the interest you get from Ave with the a token. So that was supposed to launch on January 4 on Ethereum main net. So they had their audit ready, the code was ready, really everything was ready. They just had to push the button and boom, that was launched on the moon. But no, it didn't happen. Because of the big bull market on Ethereum, the gas fees went super high and at the very last moment they decided to delay the launch because they just realized with these high gas fees, it wasn't feasible to play that game on Ethereum right now. So in the end, a couple of days later they announced that they would do the launch on Matic, which is a side chain of Ethereum that has no gas fees.
00:16:26.930 - 00:17:12.474, Speaker A: Faster transactions, which is extremely important for games, for Defi, even if transaction fee are high, if you trade a lot, well you can sort of amortize part of this fixed cost. But for games, we're always doing some very small transactions, so nobody's going to pay high gas fees for game. So I really love this project. It's so smart, really it's going to set a new trend like this combination of NFT and Defi. I absolutely love it. So I can tell you right now, you will see other games like this this year. So this one is the original, but we're going to see some folk, some copy paste of Avekochi, I can tell you in terms of competitive advantage.
00:17:12.474 - 00:17:48.518, Speaker A: So they are the first one to do this. Of course they have the first mover advantage. They also have the advantage to not have launch before they move to the side chain. So because if they were already deployed before the gas fee went up, now it would be really difficult to do the migration. But because they haven't deployed yet, now they can just decide to launch on the chain they prefer. So also good for them. So all of this is very bullish for Matic, which has a token, if I remember well, also for the token of Ave, because they use Ave in the backend.
00:17:48.518 - 00:18:41.366, Speaker A: And what about GHST, which is the governance token of Avegochi? So it's already launched and unfortunately it's been going down since the launch, I mean since the launch of the token. But when Avegochi, the game, when it launched on Matic, the GST token will be redeemable against accessories that can be used in the Avegochi game. So that's something that is going to support, is going to give some value to the token. So before they do the launch on Matic, the price of the token is probably keep going down. But when we have a firm date, when they're going to do this launch on Matic, it is probably going to pump. Okay, so next, steel about NFT. So we had a record sale this week about crypto punk.
00:18:41.366 - 00:19:14.470, Speaker A: So cryptopunk, this is really one of the first NFT projects. So it has some historical significance. And so last week someone bought a crypto punk at a record price already. But this week this record of last week was broken again. So this time someone spent $150,000 to buy this crypto punk. Just out of curiosity, so it looks like this. So it's like figures like this, I think you have a few hundred crypto punk.
00:19:14.470 - 00:20:08.262, Speaker A: Very interesting. The guy who bought this crypto punk posted this on Twitter and so he explained his reasoning. So, I mean, if you sort of intrigued by NFT, but you're still not sure if it's worth to invest in it, check out this thread to see really the argument of the guy then still in NFT, we have another record sale for my rendus. I don't know if I pronounce well. So this is a virtual game where you have some citadel, so like basically some castle. So it's not even launched, but they already sold some NFT representing some asset in the game. One of them was the NFT for Citadel and this sold for $800,000.
00:20:08.262 - 00:20:45.410, Speaker A: I mean, really, that's just insane. It's like not only someone who is spending almost $1 million for something on the blockchain, so something totally virtual, but something in the game that is not even launched that really tells you this year NFT is going to be insane. It's going to be really insane, for sure. Okay, so next we're going to talk of hacks. So there was a hack this week in Defi Saver. So Defi Saver, this is a tool to manage your defi investments. This is like a nice dashboard and allow you to manage your defi easy.
00:20:45.410 - 00:21:13.238, Speaker A: So there was a white hat hacker that found a vulnerability and exploded it. And he took a few millions out of Defi Saver. But after he gave back the money to Defi Saver, because this is a white hat, he has a nice white hat, means he's a good guy. Because like the bad hacker, the bad guys, when they hack, they have this black hat. Okay. It's very important if you don't wear the hack. If you don't wear the hat, it doesn't work.
00:21:13.238 - 00:21:54.042, Speaker A: Even if you're like, you're a genius, if you don't wear the correct hat, it just doesn't work. Very important. We start to see more and more white hat hacking, which is very good, actually, because it means more people are working to make defi safer. So this, in itself, this is good. Side note, when you use a tool like this, like Defi saver, it's important to realize that on top of the risk you take for the defi protocol, you also take the risk of the tool you use, because usually this also uses smart contracts. So it's like an additional risk. Okay, so next quick story.
00:21:54.042 - 00:22:42.038, Speaker A: So, in Hong Kong, someone who was selling his bitcoin basically was stolen. So I think that guy met the other guys with local bitcoins. And so they met in some coffee shop, and after, I don't know why, the guy, the seller, he went into their car, which you should obviously never do. And, yeah, basically they forced him to give them his private key. They didn't give the money, and they kick him out of the car. And so the guy basically lost 3 million Hong Kong dollar, which is, I think, $3 million. This is something like $300,000 or more.
00:22:42.038 - 00:23:05.034, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, actually, I should know it because I used to live in Hong Kong. Come on, Julian. Yeah, but basically, if you use local bitcoin, be super careful, especially if you want to do a large. I mean, really, unless very special situation. If you want to sell a lot of crypto, just use a centralized exchange. Seriously, like, if you use local bitcoin, then you have that kind of risk.
00:23:05.034 - 00:23:39.818, Speaker A: So it's not really worth the risk to me. Okay, so after, we're going to see some regulatory, very important, what happened this week. So we have a news from the OCC, which is, as everybody know, everybody know that the OCC means the office of the controller of the currency. I don't know why we say comptroller, why we don't say controller, why we have to say the p. Comptroller. It looks like more complicated. So this is the regulator of the banking industry in the US.
00:23:39.818 - 00:24:07.026, Speaker A: They approve banks. Last week, they approved banks to use blockchain and stablecoins. So this is absolutely amazing, amazing news for crypto. I hope you guys realize how amazing it is. So it means banks will probably start to offer some crypto accounts with maybe the possibility of transferring crypto between banks. So we might even have some at the beginning. I think we have some sort of crippled crypto with them.
00:24:07.026 - 00:24:41.070, Speaker A: That means probably you cannot do a lot of things like they restrict what you can do with your crypto. But still it's just to start with, it's still a big step forward. Once we have this, people can start to have their salary paid in crypto in their bank. And I mean once we have this, that's it, that the floodgate will open. That's the beginning of mass adoption. So super happy to hear about this. Next we're going to talk 1 second here, I mess up my window.
00:24:41.070 - 00:25:18.522, Speaker A: Okay, so next news for developer. So I wanted to show you this tool called TX two, Uml. So that's a tool to visualize a transaction in a UML schema. If you never heard of UML, that's basically some sort of graph system used by developer, basically to describe, to write the specification for software. And so that's a CLI tool. So you have to run it from the command line and you can install it from NPM. It's very, very easy to use.
00:25:18.522 - 00:26:02.082, Speaker A: You just here, you run this command in your terminal plus the name, the hash of the transaction, and it will produce this really nice schema. So that will allow you to understand what's going on. So it only works for mainnet transactions. And you do need access to an Ethereum archive node in order to use it with some special API enabled. So infira does not offer you access to the API you need, but there is a service which is called archivenode IO that offer you what you need. So check out the documentation of the package, it explains everything. Then news about Bitquery.
00:26:02.082 - 00:26:36.078, Speaker A: So bitquery, this is an API for blockchain. They have APIs for Dex trading, DFI, money flow, and they cover Ethereum, but also other blockchains. And they release a new API for Ethereum 2.0 to get data from the beacon chain. So this is a graphql API. So it's a little bit different from traditional rest API, but it's very nice that now we have some data from east two. So if you want to build some dashboard for east two, for example, and in the back end you can use Bitquery.
00:26:36.078 - 00:27:11.918, Speaker A: And lastly, I wanted to quickly talk about east global hackathon. So they are organizing this hackathon market make from January 15. This is a three week hackathon. So it's always a really good way if you want to get started in the industry, to participate in the hackathon. It's not for total beginner. You probably need to have already a few months of experience, because if you're just a total beginner, nobody will want to work with you. So first learn blockchain on my channel, on my course.
00:27:11.918 - 00:27:45.850, Speaker A: And after you can participate to the hackathon. For people who are experimented already, you can do it. And when you do a hackathon, also you have to check out the reward that are offered by different projects. For example, Avegochi, the game I talked about just before, they're going to give some token for people who build on their ecosystem. So you can take advantage of this if you want to participate in the hackathon. Okay, so next we're going to move to Q A. So yes, quickly let me post the link of my two courses.
00:27:45.850 - 00:28:32.698, Speaker A: So Defi development mastery, if you want to learn defi. And first you need to know blockchain development. So if you don't know blockchain development, I have another course, six figure blockchain developer that teach you everything. All right, so let me go up in the chat, I'm going to see if there are any question cryptocurrency. I need a way to send ether to a compromised wallet and get stuff back without boat taking it all. It's going to be difficult. If a boat knows the private key of one of your Ether, then as soon as you send some ether, you would steal it.
00:28:32.698 - 00:28:53.806, Speaker A: So careful, careful. No crypto currency. Aveguchi agent here. We all voted to launch on Matic instead. So it seems like you're someone involved in the governance. Yeah, it's really nice project. I love it.
00:28:53.806 - 00:29:36.470, Speaker A: I love it. Then cryptocurrency and quick token went up 50% last night and g hst on matic is expanding quickly because we're all preparing to buy our portals. Okay, so guys, that means we are bullish on GHST. This is going to pump. This is going to pump. Okay, so then Dunami saying, lord got to show up with the right height, like a uniform. Yeah, the hat is very important when you code.
00:29:36.470 - 00:30:05.400, Speaker A: Very important to have a hat. As you can see, I don't have a hat. This is not good crypto current. Julian, please contact me about some schooling. I don't know what you mean exactly, but if you have a question, you can ask me in the chat or after, you can send me an email if you want to have question about my course. I mean, I don't know if it's what you mean, but julian@idablocks.com. I just put it in the chat, my email.
00:30:05.400 - 00:30:34.590, Speaker A: Then Voitex saying, do you have a solidity course available. So not just on solidity, but on blockchain in general. So this is six figure blockchain developer. I put the link just before. One part of the course is on solidity, another part is on build on testing. Another part is on building the front end. And really, the goal of the course is not just to teach you the tech, but also to get you a job in the blockchain industry.
00:30:34.590 - 00:31:07.340, Speaker A: Tariq asking me, what do you think about Solana? I haven't had a look about it, but, yeah, I hear more and more things about Solana, so maybe I need to check it out. Abdul saying, but in v three, the rebalance function is public and is not triggered during a deposit. Can you tell me why is that? Which project are you talking about, Abdul? I'm not sure what you mean by v three. Cryptocurrency. I'm thinking Tai Chi network might be used to retrieve funds in compromised wallets. Okay, I wasn't aware of that. Interesting.
00:31:07.340 - 00:31:33.426, Speaker A: Yes. So cryptocurrency is confirming. Guy is confirming Gsht and matic, and we quickly pump up more. Okay, so you guys, you know what to. Okay. Okay, guys, so seems like that's it for questions today. So thanks for following the stream, and I will see you later this week on my channel.
00:31:33.426 - 00:31:35.870, Speaker A: Have a great day, everybody. Bye.
