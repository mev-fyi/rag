00:00:00.250 - 00:00:45.894, Speaker A: Okay developers, welcome back. In this video we're going to look at today's sponsor hash stack. They're the first DFI lending platform to provide crypto loans with only a portion of the collateral using their open protocol. If you're new here, I'm Calvin and at eat the blocks, we help web two developers transition into web3 you in the DFI space. Similar to traditional finance, if you want to borrow any funds, you need to provide collateral. Collateral minimizes the risk for the lender and is used to secure your loan. Typically, if you want to borrow $100 from places like Compound Ave or makerdao, you would need to put up something like $142 in collateral.
00:00:45.894 - 00:01:25.346, Speaker A: This kind of breaks the main reason for needing a loan in the first place. Hashtag solves this problem by allowing you to secure a loan up to three times your amount of collateral. So to get the same loan from hashtag of $100, you only need to provide 33 dollarsthirthirty $0.03 instead of 142 on other platforms. Not only do you get access to the funds with low collateral, you also earn interest on the crypto you deposit as collateral. That makes life a little easier and more profitable. Their crypto native lending protocol open provides a solution to the over collateralization of loans and they've just released their closed beta testnet.
00:01:25.346 - 00:02:13.362, Speaker A: Hashtag's open protocol is able to integrate with platforms like Pancakeswap to facilitate in app market swaps. If you have your own Pancakeswap fork, you can utilize the hashtag open protocol within your own decentralized exchange. Your users will no longer have to switch between Dapps to swap the borrowed tokens into other coins, overall providing a better user experience. Right now, open protocol supports major liquid coins like bitcoin, Tether, UsDcoin, BNB. Hashtag has received 1 million in seed investment after releasing the open protocol testnet. Some of the first investors to back Hashtag were Moonrock Capital, Ghaf Capital, partners market across and chain Ridge Capital. The funds raised will be utilized towards talent acquisition, product development and growth.
00:02:13.362 - 00:02:33.680, Speaker A: They are also currently hiring and you can find some of their roles in their documentation. Hashtag has the potential to be a pioneer in the Defi lending space by offering these under collateralized loans using their open protocol. We'll leave a link in the description below so you can go and check them out. That all for this video. Thank you for watching and we'll see you in the future.
