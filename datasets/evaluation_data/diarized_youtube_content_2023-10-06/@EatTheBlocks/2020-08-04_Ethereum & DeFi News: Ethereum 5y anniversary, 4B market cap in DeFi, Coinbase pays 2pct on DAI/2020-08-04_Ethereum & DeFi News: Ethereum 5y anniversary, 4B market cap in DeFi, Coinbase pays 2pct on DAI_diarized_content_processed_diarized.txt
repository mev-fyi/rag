00:00:24.670 - 00:01:12.674, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome guys, for this weekly newsletter on Ethereum and Defi. And this week I really had a lot of trouble to find what was really the highlight of the week because that was so many stuff happening in Defi, like the volume of the decentralized exchange at an all time high, a lot of announcement, a lot of super exciting stuff in Defi. So we're gonna go over all of this stuff. We start with the price of Ethereum, which keeps rising and rising. It almost doubled in a couple of weeks. So that's super cool.
00:01:12.674 - 00:01:47.046, Speaker A: Of course that's fuel because of the huge growth that we have in Defi now. Because people, when they want to get in Defi, first they have to buy first ether and then start to buy some defi token like dai or governance token, et cetera, et cetera. I see some people say hi in the chat. Hi guys. Hi Batman, Jumin Raphael. Hey, what's up? That's super cool. Hope this trend is going to continue long term.
00:01:47.046 - 00:02:15.240, Speaker A: I'm of course very bullish on ether because when they're going to be ether 2.0, it's going to have some interesting value. We'll be able to stake the ether and have some interest. So it's probably going to happen. Ethereum 2.0, the launch of the first phase stable, probably is going to be in the one year, but because of this long term I'm really bullish. Hi.
00:02:15.240 - 00:03:26.534, Speaker A: Hey Matt, what's up? All right, so next I want to show you this website I found out flipping, watch this, show you how Ethereum is doing compared to bitcoin. So if you have some friends who are maximalist and you want to argue over whether ethereum or bitcoin is the best, then you can show them this website. So here, one thing where Ethereum is above bitcoin is the number of transactions you can see here, more than 1 million in 24 hours, versus 300,000 only for bitcoin. So it's more than four times more for Ethereum. And this metrics for me is super important because that show you the usage of the network. And really, I mean that show you the demand of people for Ethereum, the market cap. Well, even though this is still only 20% of bitcoin, this for me is a less important metric because that only reflects the investment of retail investor.
00:03:26.534 - 00:04:24.586, Speaker A: I mean, it's not only retail investor, we also have Wales, but we have a lot of retail investors. So we have a lot of dumb money in the ecosystem. So for me, the market cap is not really the best metric and the trading volume, we can see that ether is at 70% of bitcoin, which is really amazing because when you see that the market cap is so much different. So that really tells you that usage on Ethereum is really high. Yeah, so that's it for the flippining watch. So also, on the topic of comparing Ethereum and bitcoin, I wanted to show you these statistics that I found on Twitter that are pretty cool. So ethereum for the last 50 days had a continuous streak where its daily transaction fees were higher than bitcoin.
00:04:24.586 - 00:05:05.450, Speaker A: So again, one more metric that show you the higher usage of ethereum. So that's really cool. And also since we're talking of ethereum, I wanted to show you that we've changed the gas limit. So the miners have voted and they changed the gas limit from 10 million to 12 million. So hopefully it's going to improve the situation for gas fees. Gas fees are pretty crazy right now. They are at 100 guay recently.
00:05:05.450 - 00:05:47.126, Speaker A: So you have a lot of operation that used to cost just a few bucks and now it's like ten or $15. So you better invest more money to make it worth it for small transaction. Unfortunately it doesn't really work. Raphael asked me in the chat guys work and I learn more about yield farming. Do you have any videos? Yeah, I have a couple of videos on yield farming. You can check out my channel, I have maybe three or four. And then we'll go over DFI pearls to check the situation of the market in Defi.
00:05:47.126 - 00:06:20.722, Speaker A: So here we can see the total value locked in DeFi. We went over 4 billion over the last week. So that's pretty amazing. You can see we are really growing really fast. And importantly, maker went back to the first place that used to occupy for a long time. And then when yield farming started, compound took the first place. Not maker is back at the first place with more than 1 billion locked in Dai.
00:06:20.722 - 00:06:59.966, Speaker A: So that's pretty amazing. And here you can see most of the top defi protocol. Everything is going up Ave also that used to be lower and now is above synthetics. So Ave is really a big time favorite of many defi user. Okay, so that's it for the global market cap of defi. Now let's see on the token situation. So this is not coin market cap, but this is Defi market cap, another website similar to coin market cap, but just for the token on Defi.
00:06:59.966 - 00:07:32.410, Speaker A: And so here you can see the main token ranked by market cap. So this is the token of compound is the largest market cap of all. We can see that synthetics is doing pretty well. The token of Ave also is doing pretty well. Some token have some really wild volatility. So amperforce -20% amperforce is really new project. So that can explain this crazy volatility.
00:07:32.410 - 00:08:20.214, Speaker A: That would be cool if this website showed a change over the last seven days. I think this is a little bit more relevant than what happened just in 24 hours. Question in the chat, Anthony, I'm doing a d five startup. What would you say the market needs more of? That's a really great question. Well, I think right now it's really difficult to follow all the different tokens and all the different strategy you can have. So I would say something that help investor understand the different possibility. I was also thinking of some sort of visual tool where you can compose a sort of complex strategy.
00:08:20.214 - 00:08:54.296, Speaker A: Like you drag some boxes and you can say, okay, I invest in this protocol and after with this token that I get, I do some yield farming on this one, et cetera. So like some visual way to invest in defi. I haven't seen this so far, so I think that would be really super interesting. What do you guys say we are not seeing? Oh shit. Oh damn. Okay. Oh my bad, guys.
00:08:54.296 - 00:09:34.040, Speaker A: Okay, can you guys see my screen right now? Yeah, I think now you guys can see my screen. This is this website, defi market cap. Okay, my bad. Technical mistake. All right, so yeah, that's it for defi market cap. So now I'm going to move on to the rate for the week. So we go on defi rate and we can see the different interest rate for Defi.
00:09:34.040 - 00:10:00.428, Speaker A: So one thing which is interesting is dai. So right now on the compound, this is 6%. So if you have some dai, that's pretty sweet. USDC. As usual, the rates are lower than dai because people don't like centralized, stable coin. They prefer dai USDT on the compound. I really don't know why it's so high, but that's pretty crazy.
00:10:00.428 - 00:10:20.628, Speaker A: 8%. Usually USDT is lower than die. So I mean that's pretty sweet. We have some really high rate here. So that's it on the situation for the rate. Batman says just a few tab open. Yeah, I'm a simple guy.
00:10:20.628 - 00:11:01.248, Speaker A: Yeah, I like to be really focused. All right, now we're going to see the situation for the transaction on a decentralized exchange. So here we have some figures provided by dune Analytics. Dune analytics is a tool that you can use to create some dashboard and create some analysis on Ethereum and defi. That's really cool. And so someone created this dashboard, and here you can see the total Dex volume in the last 24 hours, 240,000,000. And on seven days, it's 1,700,000,000.
00:11:01.248 - 00:11:51.264, Speaker A: So that's really huge. And who gets the lion's share of this? This is uniswap, and in second, we have curve and then DyDX. So just to give you some idea why this is important, well, someone on Twitter explained this. So uniswap, in the last 24 hours did 126,000,000 of volume. This is one third of Kona base, 50% of Kraken, more than Jamie, Nipolo and Binance us combined. I think we are pretty close to the flippening, really like this moment when decentralized exchanges overpass centralized exchanges. And that's funny, because not so long ago, I think that we were still very far.
00:11:51.264 - 00:12:30.188, Speaker A: I think the market share of Dex compared to centralized exchanges was just 1% or something like this. And now we see that the trading volume of Uniswap was actually more than a couple of centralized exchanges. So it seems like the flippening is going to come way faster than expected. So that's really good news for all of us who are really invested in Defi. It means that our effort are going to pay sooner rather than later. So it's super worth it to be a blockchain developer right now. Here, another interesting figure.
00:12:30.188 - 00:12:59.670, Speaker A: So the monthly Dex volume hit 4.2 billion in July. And so as a comparison, in 2019, over the whole year, it was 2.4 billion. So that means in July, that was almost two times the total trading volume of last year. So that's absolutely huge. All right, so that's it for the part where I analyze the market situation.
00:12:59.670 - 00:13:45.844, Speaker A: So now we're going to give some more specific news on what happened in DeFi, and we're going to start with Coinbase at NAS offered die holder 2% interest. So that's pretty cool. If you are end user, you don't really want to use DeFi protocols. You are a little bit afraid. Well, you can still be very comfortable in your centralized exchange and still make some money. However, be aware that 2%, this is less than what you could do in actual d five protocol. So as I show you just before on DFI rate, if you invest your die in compan, you'll make 6%.
00:13:45.844 - 00:14:20.700, Speaker A: So that's significantly more than what Coinbase offers you. Of course, behind the scene, probably, that coinbase itself, what it does with your die, is that itself, it invests in compound, so it pocket in the difference. But really there is no reason to let Coinbase make this money. You can just invest in compound yourself. That's not very complicated. The only difference is that you have to manage your private key yourself, so you take more responsibility, but in exchange you get four extra percent. But anyway, that's a good initiative of Coinbase.
00:14:20.700 - 00:14:58.876, Speaker A: And I think we're going to see this more and more. We're going to see some centralized exchange that provide you some interface where you can invest in DeFi protocol. And of course they're going to take their cut, but for a lot of users, it's going to make DFI more accessible. It's going to contribute to fueling even more money in DeFi. Pretty cool considering they're offering zero point 15% on USDC. Yeah, I think they used to offer 2% on USDC, but they cut it down. I'd be curious to know if this is a fixed rate or a variable rate.
00:14:58.876 - 00:15:32.230, Speaker A: I don't think this is a fixed rate because otherwise they will have to take a risk over the year. So, yeah, then next news, we're going to switch to the default protocol. So Defos, they introduce a new thing which is called yield market. And so let me scroll down. They have a chart somewhere. Where do we have. Yeah, I think this is this one I meant to show you.
00:15:32.230 - 00:16:18.756, Speaker A: So the idea is that you provide an s 20 token. I think they only accept some stablecoin right now, and in exchange they give you a d token. So D USDC, DUSDT, et cetera, and they're going to invest your ES 20 token in the various DeFi protocol and get the best yield. And so at any time you can redeem your d token against the original token that you invested and you get the principal plus the interest. So it's very similar to why earn that I showed you last week. That's basically it. Optimize your investment in various DeFi protocol without requiring you to do anything.
00:16:18.756 - 00:16:57.068, Speaker A: So that really offers a lot of value. Someone say in the chat, Conbile said annual percentage yield 2% current annualized yield offer for die rate is subject to change. Yeah, so that's the key part rate is subject to change. So this is a variable rate, not fixed rate. Okay, thank you for that. So for the yield market, I was explaining you. So that's basically like y earn, but the difference is that this is optimized for gas because every time you invest, it doesn't do the rebalancing.
00:16:57.068 - 00:17:41.712, Speaker A: So in yearn, every time you invest in the same transaction, it also rebalanced the whole pool. So if there is a better investment in DeFi protocol B, then it's going to take money from DeFi protocol a and change it to b. So you, the investor, you pay not only for your transaction, but you also sort of support the ecosystem because you have to pay for the gas fee for rebalancing. And so that makes the whole transaction more expensive. So with this new protocol of default, this doesn't happen. The rebalancing is decoupled from the investment phase. So that's one interesting thing.
00:17:41.712 - 00:18:05.796, Speaker A: Interesting difference. So I think that this idea of yearn is going to be copied by many other protocol that's like yield farming. That's really one big breakthrough. So expect more protocols like this to come out in the next few months. That's for sure. Next. Another big news this week is the launch of V two of Ogre.
00:18:05.796 - 00:18:42.012, Speaker A: So ogier, we don't talk of ogre very often, but that's a shame because actually Ogre is one of the biggest team of smart contract developers, if not the biggest team. I think they have like maybe 20 or 30 smart contract developer in their company. It was one of the biggest. ICO think they raised hundreds of millions. That was in 2016, I believe. So that was really something amazing. And so what they do is a prediction market similar to gnosis.
00:18:42.012 - 00:19:24.912, Speaker A: So they basically allow you to create market where you can bet on a real world event. Like could be anything, could be will the temperature in New York next week will be above 30 degree. That could be the result of a football match. Could be anything you want. So it works with Oracle. So it integrates outside data into the blockchain with Oracle and that really leave the door open for a lot of possibility. For example, you could do some insurance market, you can create some derivative financial products.
00:19:24.912 - 00:20:06.380, Speaker A: And so they've been working on their V two for a very long time and finally they released it. So one of the main change, I think they don't say it here, but one of the main change is that now the markets are in Dai before the markets were in ether. So of course people want a stable coin. So that's one of the main change. And there are many others, but I'm not super familiar with Ogre. But if you are in prediction markets, you should study ogre and gnosis. And on my channel, actually, if you look up the past video this year I have a video that explains gnosis.
00:20:06.380 - 00:20:44.392, Speaker A: All right, so next. So I wanted to show you this fork of Wifi. So, Wifi, this is this governance token of the wine earn protocol. I explained how it worked last week. And so there was this korean developer who decided to fork Wi Fi, and so there was a lot of controversy over it in China. People started to be super excited about it. Some people said that was legit, some people said it wasn't.
00:20:44.392 - 00:21:36.920, Speaker A: And at the end, the outcome is this is a scam, apparently. So the creator of these folk have exit scam, leaving a lot of investor holding the bag. So yeah, that's the sad end of the story. So what can we learn from this story? Well, anybody can fork any DeFi protocol, that's for sure. However, in this case, the way that guy fooled everybody. So that was an anonymous developer who folk the protocol, and we already had some anonymous developer who developed some DeFi protocol. So this in itself doesn't mean this is a scam, but there can be an indication.
00:21:36.920 - 00:22:16.532, Speaker A: And so that guy folked his protocol. And so instead of investing too quickly in that, I think it's best to wait a few weeks to see what's going on. So, yes, don't jump on some sudden announcement like this. Yeah, it's a shame for people who lost money. Then we're going to go to another news about synthetics. So synthetics decommissioned its foundation. So the foundation of synthetics was responsible for managing the money, the governance of the protocol.
00:22:16.532 - 00:22:58.768, Speaker A: Basically, this foundation is going to be unwind. Instead, we're going to have three dao that governs the protocol. So the protocol Dao. So this will control the evolution of the protocol, protocol upgrades, et cetera, and then the grants dao and synthetics Dao. So both of them manages the finance of synthetics. So if you have a project to submit to synthetics, you have to submit it to one of these two dao. So this follows a global trend in DeFi, where we see many other projects switching to Dao.
00:22:58.768 - 00:23:37.760, Speaker A: So that means that as a blockchain developer, it's becoming more important to understand how a DL work. So in one of my course, we build a DL from scratch, for your information, FYI. All right, so that's it for synthetics. So then we're going to talk briefly of AAve. So Ave, one of the most popular Defi protocol. So that's a lending protocol. You can lend and borrow tokens.
00:23:37.760 - 00:24:28.160, Speaker A: So they are going to do a token migration from lend to AAve. And so Ave. This is going to be a governance token, and in the end you're going to be able to stake this token and earn some share of the trading fee on Ave. But if the system has any problem, if this is hacked, then some of this ave token can be liquidated to cover for the losses. So that's really a staking mechanism. In most cases, this is probably fine, you won't lose money, you will make some interest, but if something bad happened to the protocol, you can lose everything. So that's the risk profile.
00:24:28.160 - 00:25:16.080, Speaker A: But we really see a lot of defi protocol adopting this model of the governance token that you can stake and earn some trading fee. Then we're going to move on to happy news. So there was this Defi project, Sablier Finance. So that's a project for paying employees on the blockchain, and it invented this new concept of streaming money. That means when you're getting paid with Sablier, you're not paid in one time at the end of the month. But this is a continuous stream of money, so every second you get paid a fraction of your pay. So that's pretty sweet.
00:25:16.080 - 00:26:25.060, Speaker A: Someone asked in the chat, is it possible to hack forsage smart contract? I don't know what is forsage smart contract, but yeah, in the past we had many example of smart contract that got hacked. It's never the Ethereum protocol that got hacked, it's always the solidity code. So that's why we have all these expensive audits that needs to be done. But even after an audit, we cannot be sure 100% that a contract is unhackable. Unfortunately, that's the sad reality of smart contract in Ethereum. So coming back to mainframe and several years. So mainframe, this is an ICO in 2018, and I think what they did was a secure communication protocol, and that didn't really work, and they decided to reposition themselves in Defi in February this year, and so they acquired Sabli.
00:26:25.060 - 00:27:24.852, Speaker A: So there are two things to say about this. First, as a blockchain developer, that's really inspiring, because that means that you can create your DeFi protocol, and one way you can make money with your deFi protocol is by being acquired by another DeFi project. So we don't know exactly what's the total amount of the acquisition, but we're probably talking of a few hundred thousand dollars. So I think there are two co founder. So I mean, you can make the computation, but they probably made a significant amount of money with this acquisition. So that's a sort of side benefit when you create a DeFi protocol that maybe you don't think right away that's really cool. So what mainframe is going to do with sablier? They're going to create defi bonds.
00:27:24.852 - 00:28:21.484, Speaker A: So that's basically going to be a lending protocol. So maybe you're going to say, okay, well, what's the difference with compound Ave, et cetera? We already have some lending protocols. So the difference is that first of all, because they market this as bond on the blockchain, I think they're going to target some enterprise. Because when we talk of bond, this is the vocabulary of big companies, not of small company. And second, they have a different mechanism that allow them to have collateralization well below 150%. So they mentioned it here, usually all the protocol or they require you to have 150% ratio of collateralization. But thanks to their mechanism, it's going to be much lower than this.
00:28:21.484 - 00:29:08.552, Speaker A: So it's going to be a way more efficient way of borrowing money. So for borrowers is really cool. So yeah, we'll see if their project take off. I'm pretty bullish because when you see what happened to compound and mean, we saw that lending protocol in DeFi, they are super popular. So if they can improve on existing lending protocol, that's very bullish. So if I were you guys, I would keep monitoring this project and try to see when they release their governance protocol and when we can do yield farming. So John Hill in the chat asked me when moon.
00:29:08.552 - 00:29:43.808, Speaker A: Yeah, we are mooning just right now. Someone else in our Cesar asked me, what do you think about ample force and its rebase system? I don't know. So far. I think I prefer the die system. I don't really like the idea that I don't really know exactly how many coins I have in my wallet. Because with ample force, they modify the supply of tokens to keep their peg to one dollars. Just as a user, I find it really confusing.
00:29:43.808 - 00:30:08.540, Speaker A: Also, I don't think they are as mature as die. I mean, that's for sure that they just launched. So I think recently the price of their token was like $0.69 or something like this. So I mean, we can see some wild volatility here. So of course over a few days, probably it's going to come back to one dollars. But this is a bit scary.
00:30:08.540 - 00:30:40.600, Speaker A: If you hold some ample falls and you see this valuation, this is supposed to be valued at one point and you see $0.69, that's not ideal. So I would say with Ampere force, let's wait and see. All right, so next news. Polka dot raises 43 million in a private sale. So polka dot. If you never heard about that, that's a solution for blockchain interperbility.
00:30:40.600 - 00:31:20.256, Speaker A: So hard to say. Basically it connects different blockchain. And so that's by parity, the company that was created by one of the guys that originally worked on the first implementation of Ethereum. So parity used to develop a software called parity. So same name, it's easy. It was one of the main implementation of Ethereum written in rust. But last year or early this year, they announced that they stopped development on Ethereum for parity to focus fully on Polkadot.
00:31:20.256 - 00:32:02.896, Speaker A: So they are not really a competitor of Ethereum. This is more like a sort of complement. So I think blockchain interoperability is positive for all blockchain because this is going to make all the blockchain increase in value. John Hill asked me in the chat fastest way to learn to code flash loan. All right, well, there is a simple answer to this. You take my course on flash loan, so you can see the link in the description. I also have a free training on flash loan, so you can also find the link in the description.
00:32:02.896 - 00:32:25.130, Speaker A: Oh yeah, Raphael. Yeah. Gavin Wood is the guy who created. Yeah, thank you. I had it on the tip of my tongue, black blossoms. How do you have time to read all the crypto news? Yeah, that's a tough one. Well, basically what I do is I read a couple of newsletter and I try to summarize the info, find what is the most important.
00:32:25.130 - 00:32:54.070, Speaker A: There are really a lot of news. That's true, but not all the news are really important. You really have a lot of noise, especially when it comes to price speculation. I think this is like really low value. You can spend a lot of time trying to study these patterns and not get anything out of it. So yeah, you need to learn how to separate the signal from noise. And one good way to do this is to not follow the news every day.
00:32:54.070 - 00:33:56.500, Speaker A: Me, I try to follow the news with this video. I do it once a week and already this is enough. Do you intend to create tutorials to develop using substrate on Polkadot? Not really, because this is more at the level of blockchain core development, but me, what I teach is really how to build smart contract and decentralized application on top of blockchain. This being said that maybe if in the future there is some framework that is built for developers on top of Polkadot and that becomes easier to develop, then I may do a tutorial at this point. All right, so let's come back to Polkadot here. So the reason why I wanted to mention this news is that this is a big investment, 43 million. If you start your company tomorrow, you're not going to get a 43 million investment from investors.
00:33:56.500 - 00:34:46.484, Speaker A: When you get started, you go to see what we call angel investors, or you go to see your family or anybody you can find, and they'll give you like $20,000, $30,000, $50,000 or $100,000, but that's really in the upper range. And with this money, you're supposed to build a prototype. And after one year, maybe that you can get 1 million with the first run of a VC investor, and a couple of years after that, maybe you can get three, five millions, and maybe after that you can get 10 million. But 43 million, that's extremely significant. So that's very interesting that this happened outside. After the ICO era of blockchain. This is during a private sale.
00:34:46.484 - 00:35:21.732, Speaker A: So that means in order to be allowed in this private sale, you need to be a qualified investor. So you need to have a certain amount of money. So in the US, I think to be a qualified investor, you need to own, to make at least $200,000 a year. And I think you need to have a certain amount of asset, probably a couple of millions. So really this is not for everybody. And these people are well informed, they are smart people. So if they are willing to invest that much money into Polkadot, it probably means that they have good reason.
00:35:21.732 - 00:36:04.992, Speaker A: So I think this is super cool that now we start to see some really big investment in blockchain, but totally outside of the ICO era. Big investment made by smart people. Earlier this year, we also had a big investment of this VC fund in the US. I made a video about it. This VC fund of Mark Anderson, they created a fund for crypto of 500 million. So that is very telling of what smart people think about blockchain. So following the price of bitcoin and ethereum and following the market cap, this is one thing, but what really matters is when you get that kind of news.
00:36:04.992 - 00:36:27.208, Speaker A: So that's super bullish. John Hill said can pay for the course in crypto. Yeah. Okay, well, I'll put my address in the chat just after. Yes, you can pay in crypto. So that's it for Polkadot. So next news.
00:36:27.208 - 00:36:56.800, Speaker A: So now specifically for developers. So last week there was a new version of Soliti that was announced, solidity version 0.7. So that comes pretty fast because 0.6 came not even six months ago. So for this new version, there are some breaking changes and there are some new features. There aren't too many changes though. So if you wrote some code with three t 0.5
00:36:56.800 - 00:37:26.380, Speaker A: or three t 0.6 that is mostly compatible like 99% with three t 0.7. So don't panic, this is not a big deal. So the list of change is pretty big. But because I like you guys and I want to make your life easier, I created a video on what's new in three t 0.7. So if you want to save some time, go watch this video. I only focus on the most important feature.
00:37:26.380 - 00:38:05.640, Speaker A: All right, so that was pretty much it for the news on Ethereum and defi this week. If you guys have any question in the chat, I can answer now. Otherwise, otherwise we're going to stop here. All right, well, I guess this is it. So bye guys, and I'll see you the next week for another newsletter on Ethereum. Defi on Defi and Ethereum. Bye.
