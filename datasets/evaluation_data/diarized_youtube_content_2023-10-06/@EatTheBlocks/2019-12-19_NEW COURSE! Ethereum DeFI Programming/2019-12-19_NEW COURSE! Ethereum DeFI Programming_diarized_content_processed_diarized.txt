00:00:00.410 - 00:00:43.978, Speaker A: Hi guys, in this video I'd like to make a quick announcement about an upcoming course on DeFi or decentralized finance. So if you never heard of DeFi before, this is a segment of Ethereum that is growing very fast. A lot of new projects are building on this. So basically DeFi is about rebuilding finance. On the blockchain you have project like maker Dao and Dai compound, Uniswap, agnosis. All of these projects they redefine finance, but they implement their project in a smart contract in a totally decentralized way. And the DeFi is really growing like crazy.
00:00:43.978 - 00:01:26.294, Speaker A: If you see the charts of the amount of money that is traded on DeFi project in 2019, it has grown like crazy. And there are many developers who start to jump on this opportunity to build their own DeFi project. Unfortunately, the documentation is not great. It's not always easy to integrate your smart contract with other smart contract of other DeFi projects. So in this course on DeFi, I'm going to introduce you the many DeFi projects. So Dai companion, Uniswapnosis, et cetera and I'm going to show you how you can integrate with their smart contract with solidity. So register to this course.
00:01:26.294 - 00:01:39.810, Speaker A: It's totally free. You will find the link in the description down below. If you have any question about this upcoming course on decentralized finance development, just ask them in the comments. Thanks for watching. See you soon. Bye.
