00:00:03.370 - 00:00:40.166, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi. And today we'll be talking about couple of stuff. First, Filecon, which just launched its mainnet network last week. We'll talk of whether or not it's still worth it to invest in the file call tokens now. Now we'll talk about news about your favorite Defi developer, Andre Conrey, and also big news about layer two. We'll also talk of NFT and a new marketplace you have to know and many other stuff.
00:00:40.166 - 00:01:14.174, Speaker A: And as usual, we'll do the Q and A at the end. If you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host, and on my channel ego blocks, I teach blockchain development and how to find your first blockchain job. And before we continue, quick shout out to my two courses. If you want to become a professional blockchain developer and make $100,000 a year like I used to make, check out my course, six figure blockchain developer. And if you are interested in profitable flash loan with arbitrage, check my other course on flash loan. All right, so, hi to people in the chat. Hi Felix.
00:01:14.174 - 00:01:40.118, Speaker A: Hi Eric. Hi Pierre. Hi ThX. Hi everybody. We're going to start with the price of Ethereum, as usual. So this week we're going down a little bit. I think that people are waiting for the result of the talk for the stimulus package in the US, and it's going to influence the stock market and then it's going to influence bitcoin and ether.
00:01:40.118 - 00:02:12.626, Speaker A: But one thing that I think is pretty bullish is I do think this talk, the stimulus talk will end before the election. So hopefully we'll have a nice boost here. And also, there was the news this week that grayscale, which is a big crypto fund, is investing more and more in ether. So it's going to really support the market. Okay. So as you know, I'd like to keep an eye on the gas price because that's super important. So the cooling off of the gas price continues.
00:02:12.626 - 00:02:42.746, Speaker A: I think this week we've seen regularly gas prices of about 15 gWe. I mean, it's been such a long time since we last heard about gas prices like this. This summary was crazy. It was like 200, 300 guid. So finally it's coming down to almost reasonable level. So obviously this is related to the decrease in yield farming activities. So that means we can use our favorite defi protocol without paying a fortune for every trade.
00:02:42.746 - 00:03:27.520, Speaker A: So all in all, this is good. So now we're going to switch to the market cap and the price of DFI token. So this week for the whole market cap of DFI we're at 1118 billion. So it's barely more than last week when we were at 11 billion something. We are still going sideways so clearly there is a slowdown, but at the same time it still hold on, it doesn't really crash. So I would say it's not so bad when it comes to the crypto token. So we do have a lot of red.
00:03:27.520 - 00:04:05.018, Speaker A: So here if you see the negative performance, we really have a lot of red. The token governance of metastable curve swerve which is a fork of curve land pickle Ave. We really have a lot of red. If you see the green, we do have some green, but much less these tokens. I have no idea about this project, never heard of them. Ample token here, that's the first famous one I see in the green. What else? Yeah, genbtc, rap, BTC, barely positive, but yeah.
00:04:05.018 - 00:04:36.520, Speaker A: So that's not a great week for Defi tokens. So then we're going to talk of the rate. So what do we have to notice this week for the rate? So for die we have 6% on DYDX. So yeah, 6%, that's pretty cool. Then uni tokens we have 16.57% on compound. So yeah, that's very healthy yield here.
00:04:36.520 - 00:05:16.974, Speaker A: So then that's it for market cap in defi token prices. And next we're going to switch to the news about Defi protocol. So of course the main news for this week is for their website. Okay, yeah, the website is like pretty fancy as some really fancy animation. So the big news of this week is the launch of the main net of Filecoin. After three years of development and a couple of delay, investors started to be really frustrated. But yeah, finally it was launched.
00:05:16.974 - 00:06:17.150, Speaker A: So what is Filecoin? Filecoin is a decentralized storage solution. So it aims at competing with existing cloud technologies by offering better prices, faster data access and also censorship resistance. So I want to talk about the technology and also about the price of the token. So first we start with the tech, because if you want to understand the price of the token, you need to understand the text. Hello, am I back live? I think so. Can you guys confirm me? I'm back online. Okay, so there was a crash, my computer crashed and I just restarted everything.
00:06:17.150 - 00:06:41.636, Speaker A: Is it working? I think so. Can you guys hear me? Can you confirm in the chat? It seems you guys hear me. Okay, awesome. Yeah, so sorry, I think I had too many tabs open. Yeah, that really sucks. Okay, so that basically messed up my whole presentation. I've prepared all the tab for everything.
00:06:41.636 - 00:07:31.492, Speaker A: So yeah, it's just going to be me talking now. I was talking of ipfs, basically, ficoin is built on top of ipfs, and we need to understand what is ipfs first if we want to understand what is filecoin. So IPFS is a decentralized network for storing data. So with ipfs you can store and retrieve data in a decentralized way by connecting to all the computers that are part of the IPFS network. So everybody can participate in the IPFS network. And you don't need to stake any coin, you only need to run an ipfs node on a server. That's it.
00:07:31.492 - 00:08:36.884, Speaker A: So one key element of ipfs is the idea of hash. So when you want to retrieve data on ipfs, you don't specify a URL like on the web, but instead you specify the hash of the data you want to retrieve. Or in other words, you specify the signature of the data. So when you want to retrieve data from the network, you can check that the data is correct by calculating the hash of the data and making sure it's equal to the original hash that you use to retrieve the data. So that's how you can protect against data corruption and not honest network participants who will try to fool you. So there is a limitation of ipfs, and it's very important to understand it because the whole point of filecoin is to solve this limitation. So on ipfs, when you upload data on the network, it's only uploaded on your local ipfs node.
00:08:36.884 - 00:09:15.136, Speaker A: After two days, the data on your node is automatically removed. So if you want to keep it, you need to pin it. And if you want others to pin it for redundancy, for example, you need to convince them to do it. So it will cost them money to store your data on a node. So you need to pay them. So what if you are not a technical user and you don't want to run your own ipfs node? And also how you can find other ipfs node operators to store your data. So Filecoin solved this problem by building a marketplace on top of ipfs.
00:09:15.136 - 00:09:59.184, Speaker A: So with Filecoin you can easily find ipfs node operators who are willing to host your data in exchange of money. So we call these ipfs node operators miners. This marketplace is implemented in a blockchain where miners have to upload a proof that they actually store the data. And once they upload this proof they can get paid in the file token. The token of Filecoin. So now we're going to talk of the token of Falcon, try to understand its valuation. So Filecoin raised about $200 million for its ICO in 2017, as well as $50 million from VC.
00:09:59.184 - 00:10:49.456, Speaker A: So it's probably enough to last a few years. So the token of Filecoin is called filth, that's a token ticker. And there are about 200 million fill token issued, but only about 15 million are in circulation. So the rest will be distributed progressively to early investor over the next few years. So it's never good when you have such a low proportion that is in circulation because you always have the risk that the massive supply of remaining token can be dumped in the future. But in this case, the release is going to be quite progressive. So in terms of ICO prices, so during the advisory sale, so that's where you had like all the wells, all the vc, the price of the token was then in a general token sale.
00:10:49.456 - 00:11:47.876, Speaker A: So in other words, for the rest of us, the price of the token was one to $6. So that's how much these guys have bought at the ICO. And the current market cap of the token is 500 million. So the Falcon main net launched on October 16, and then the fill token started to trade the same day. So it reached a peak price of more than 100 US, which is 100 times more than for the early investors. So obviously these guys who invested early in the ICO, like profited massively, and since then it came back down to about $30. So what about now? Is it still worth it to buy some fill token? So it's not obvious to give a yes or no answer, but I'm going to answer this question by talking of the pros and cons.
00:11:47.876 - 00:12:28.928, Speaker A: So on the positive side, Joanne Bennett. So he is the creator of Filecon and is also the creator of IPFS, the technology Filecon is based on. That's why technically I really trust the team of Filecon. So IPFS is an open source project that is very active and it's already been running in production for a few years. So we can say that Filecoin is really built on solid foundation. So it's another really positive point. It's possible that in the future it will become standard for decentralized application to host their front end on ipfs using Filecoin.
00:12:28.928 - 00:13:22.880, Speaker A: Currently, Dapps host their front end on centralized server, so they are not truly 100% decentralized. For example, we saw that last year, the US government demanded that uniswap block certain sanctioned countries from its front end. So if you have a community based frontend that is deployed on ipfs, you will never have this problem. So if Dapps really grow in volume, Falcon will really benefit from it. Also, another very positive point is that Falcon has raised 52 million from some of the most prestigious vcs like Anderson Horowitz, Sequoia. These guys are really smart. So it's always a very positive signal to have a project be backed by such vcs and not just retail investors.
00:13:22.880 - 00:14:05.472, Speaker A: So that was for the positive side. Now on the negative side, there is a lot of competition. Siacoin storej not to mention Amazon s three service. So one of the main promises of Filecoin is to offer a cheaper storage solution than existing cloud providers. But I really don't see how it's possible. A lot of Filecon miners will probably use Amazon cloud services to host their Filecoin node. So if they run their own physical server, that's another story.
00:14:05.472 - 00:14:46.800, Speaker A: But probably at least at the beginning, they will use Amazon. So they will have the cost of Amazon plus the cost of a file coin. So for me it has to be more expensive than Amazon S three. Also, second negative point is the kind of users who really care about censorship resistance is the crowd of privacy focused users. So this is basically the kind of user that would use brave Mozilla browser. So brave is growing fast, but Mozilla is really not doing great. So I'm not really sure what is the size of this crowd that really care about privacy.
00:14:46.800 - 00:15:37.276, Speaker A: That's pretty negative point. And also we heard about miners, so Filecoin miners who complain that running a falcon node is really expensive. So on Twitter you had a lot of people who complained about this, and as a result, there was a huge proportion of the miners of Filecoin who just stopped mining, at least temporarily. So maybe that the developer of Filecoin will have to adjust some parameters. But yeah, so at least it explained why the price of the token has dropped a lot to about $30. So I would say a lot of coins of positive side, but also a lot of negative thing. So all in all, I'm kind of neutral on filecoin.
00:15:37.276 - 00:16:40.724, Speaker A: I don't really have a strong opinion in either direction, but this is a solid project technically at least. Okay, so next I want to talk about our favorite developer, Andre Cronhey. So Andre Kronhi released a new blog post where he says that he does not build for speculators because he's really tired of just releasing a product that is not ready and have people invest in it. But guess what? The same thing happened again because he was working on a new token for governance. And so he said on his medium blog that this new token has absolutely no value, but people still started to send money to it. Someone even bought for like $200,000 of this new token. So I think people, how do you say they know the deal with Andre Conrad, they know how he works, but they still ignore his warnings because they know that there will be people who buy his token no matter what.
00:16:40.724 - 00:17:30.388, Speaker A: So any new project of Andre Conray has speculative value, no matter what Andre Conray does or says. So I really think that now Andre should acknowledge this fact and not just hide the fact that he just said to people not to invest in his project because he knows what's going to happen. It's what people will do. So maybe it's time to test his project on Testnet and not on main net like Andrea Conray. So I don't know if you guys follow what happened with EMN. So EMN was basically a game that was developed by Andre Conrey. And so as usual, he test on Mainnet and some people sent some money to the smart contract of the game, even though it wasn't finished and there was a critical security bug inside.
00:17:30.388 - 00:18:19.060, Speaker A: And so much money was stolen by a hacker who found the vulnerability. I think there was like 15 million of dollars that were stolen. A lot of the investor that lost money during this event, they decided to do a lawsuit against Andre Conrey. So this is really crazy. I really don't see how in the world they would win this lawsuit of time and money wasted in lawyer fees. So yeah, I just think these guys are really irresponsible for both first investing in not released product and then suing Andre Connor who never promised anything. I see this is totally baseless and these guys are just wasting their time just massively.
00:18:19.060 - 00:18:47.996, Speaker A: Okay, so next I want to talk of layer two. So on layer two, couple of news. So Coinbase wallet. So that's the mobile wallet of Coinbase is testing the optimism scaling solution. And synthetics is also moving to phase two of its own. Trial of optimism sidechain. So optimism sidechain is an l two scaling solution based on zero knowledge roll up.
00:18:47.996 - 00:19:32.964, Speaker A: So you have like two companies that are using it to do some trial. So yeah, it seems like pretty bullish for optimism. I hope that by the end of the year we'll see at least one major defi project that has moved to l two scaling solution. On Ethereum, you also have polymarket, a prediction market, which is also moving to layer two. So we're going to see more and more news about layer two by the end of the year. Okay, so next I want to talk of nfts. So there is this new marketplace that is called superrate, sorry, super rare.
00:19:32.964 - 00:20:04.944, Speaker A: So super rare is the largest digital art gallery. It's a little bit like a combination of Instagram and Christie's. And digital art volume is growing super fast at like almost 50%. Months over months. And super rare, I'm going to put the name in the chat because maybe I don't pronounce it right, super rare. So it has 83% of the market share. So most of the volume is coming from the primary market auctions.
00:20:04.944 - 00:20:45.596, Speaker A: That means when a creator puts their creation for sale for the first time, and the rest of the market is collectors who resell the NFT. So the two most successful super rare creators have earned $276,000 and $100,000 respectively in this year alone. So that really show you that you can really make a lot of money with NFT. And super rare takes a 15% commission. So we don't really have any basis for comparison. So it seems high, if you ask me. But actually we do have a basis for comparison.
00:20:45.596 - 00:21:37.152, Speaker A: So in the traditional art world art gallery, that will take 40% to 50% commission. So 15% commission in comparison, that's much, much lower. So in total, artists have earned over 8 million on superware, and collectors have earned about $900,000 from secondary sales. So, yeah, it could be like some alternative way of making money on blockchain by buying some NFT and reselling them. But a big problem of NFT is that some NFT and reselling them, but a big prime of NFT is that they are non fungible. So probably we're going to see some sort of product that can turn non fungible NFT into fungible NFT. And actually, I released a tutorial just on this topic last week on my channel.
00:21:37.152 - 00:22:26.460, Speaker A: So check it out if you're interested. So next we're going to talk of investment. So this quarter of 2020, there was $900 million of VC money that was invested in crypto companies. So how big is this? Let me give you some element of comparison so you can compare this to about $500 million that were invested last year for the whole year and $600 million that were invested during the first half of this year. So clearly the trend is accelerating. In one quarter, we had more money invested by VC to crypto companies than during the whole year, during the whole time last year. And this is happening during the year of COVID when the whole world economy is crashing.
00:22:26.460 - 00:23:11.164, Speaker A: So can you imagine what it's going to be when the whole world economy is going to be back on track? I mean, this is going to be a real gold rush. This is going to be insane. So you have to be ready before the gold rush starts, otherwise you will be trampled by the crowd. And that means if you're not already a blockchain developer, you need to start learning now. Okay, so next we're going to talk of a few projects that have raised money recently. So Ave, which is a big d five favorite, raised $25 million last week, and this comes after a previous round of $3 million that were raised in July. So if you don't know Ave, that's basically a lending protocol similar to compound.
00:23:11.164 - 00:23:48.952, Speaker A: But what makes Aave really special is that they have a lot of extra features like delegated lending, where an address can let another address borrow on their behalf by providing collateral for the other address. And of course of Ave is flash loans. They are actually the creator of the concept of flash loan. And second project that raised money this week is boardroom, which raised $2.2 million. So I had no idea about boardroom, but it's actually quite interesting. So what they do is they are a sort of zapper for governance.
00:23:48.952 - 00:24:31.060, Speaker A: So they create a single unified interface from which you can participate in the governance of multiple protocols like voting, staking, et cetera. So remember, the reason why I mentioned all of these VC investments is because when you have a company that raise money from VC, they have to spend the capital quickly. They just can't sit on the money and say, oh, we're just going to chill and keep it in the bank. And yeah, wait a little bit. We want to play it safe. No, VC wants very high return on their investment and they want it to happen really fast. So a big part of this money will be used for hiring.
00:24:31.060 - 00:25:13.492, Speaker A: So when you hear a blockchain company that just raised money from a VC, if you are looking for a blockchain job, it means it's time to send you cv. Don't wait. Absolutely, don't wait. Okay, so next, I want to talk a little bit about regulation. So last week, the SEC commissioner, Hester Pierce, I'm not sure if I pronounce, well, it's basically some top executive that the SEC, he mentioned that Defi governance tokens could potentially be classified as securities. And he mentioned explicitly uni and the sushi tokens even airdropped as securities. So this comes in the context of bitmex that was sued recently.
00:25:13.492 - 00:26:07.050, Speaker A: So could they come for DeFi next? Well, there is not much regulation on DeFi so far, but apparently they're working on it. So if they do decide that DeFi tokens are securities, it will clearly be negative for the industry for sure. But until we have more specific news about this, we really can't speculate too much. Also now Spain is working on a bill to require crypto investors to disclose their holdings and profits. Yeah, I mean, at this stage, I think we can pretty much expect that this is going to be the case in most countries. Okay, and this week next, usually I do a section for the news for developers, but this week, really, I didn't find anything especially interesting for that. So we're going to move straight to the Q and a quickly.
00:26:07.050 - 00:26:36.450, Speaker A: I'm just going to just copy paste again the link to my two courses. So six figure blockchain developer and flash loan. Let me see. Yeah, six figure blockchain developer and flash loan. My two courses. And after I'm going to go up in the chat and answer all the questions Q a time. Okay, so let me scroll up.
00:26:36.450 - 00:27:07.828, Speaker A: So question. So will be Jeng saying, I don't think blockchain can handle huge amount of data. The bitcoin and east transaction are slow and expensive. That's how you know blockchain capacity. Yes. I mean, that's basically the big frame of industry is focused on solving that problem. What about definity? I don't know about definity.
00:27:07.828 - 00:27:56.376, Speaker A: Roland is asking. So Saif is saying, are decks like uniswap a threat to exchanges like Coinbase? I mean, yes, absolutely. If you see the trading volume of Uniswap, it's actually now bigger than Coinbase, which was something unthinkable of even like six months ago. At the beginning of the year, Coinbase was largely in front of Uniswap. So nobody could think that a couple of months after that Uniswap would be above. So, yeah, of course that's why Coinbase is adding deFi feature, so that people can still participate in Defi, but from Coinbase. But what a lot of people industry believe is that in the future, centralized exchanges, there will just be an onramp for fiat to defi.
00:27:56.376 - 00:28:29.316, Speaker A: So people will use the KYC procedure of decentralized exchange, will buy some crypto ether, and after they will move to Uniswap, et cetera. Creative takeo say how to start smart contract with Tron. So TrON is just a copy paste of Ethereum. So everything that you learn on my channel about Ethereum, solidity, truffle, et cetera, you can reuse everything. The only difference is maybe that they have renamed some of these technologies. So I'm not sure they use a webster. Maybe they use a sort of fork of web three.
00:28:29.316 - 00:29:07.004, Speaker A: So you just have to learn the name of their copy paste. But it's going to be largely the same thing. Steve is asking, can you do a video where you cover the main smart contract interface to interact when building an API for Uniswap? Yeah, I could do that. I have really a lot of video on Uniswap already. I have like an introduction to uniswap, v one, v two, how to photo, but how to build an API for Defi. So maybe you can already start to look at this. Davion is saying, hey, I love your video on the Unishop exchange.
00:29:07.004 - 00:29:26.470, Speaker A: Would you do one on how to set it up on a local testnet? A local testnet? Yeah, I think the video I did was for a local. What do you mean local testnet? You mean like Covan, but you set it up yourself. I mean, this is.
