00:00:05.370 - 00:00:27.582, Speaker A: You. And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news on Ethereum and Defi. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. And in this video, I'm gonna be talking of Ethereum, which recovered from the crash one week ago. I'm gonna.
00:00:27.582 - 00:00:53.830, Speaker A: I'm gonna talk of polka dot, which is an Ethereum alternative that is getting a lot of traction. It's very important to pay attention to this. I'm going to be talking of the latest news in Defi. So synthetics launch something that is going to be a real game changer. And also we have big news on the institutional side. With a huge bank in the US making a move to crypto, it's a super important development. If you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host.
00:00:53.830 - 00:01:29.538, Speaker A: And on my channel, etherblocks, I teach blockchain development. And before we continue, quick mention to my new course on DeFi development. If you want to become a developer in the defi industry, which is exploding now, and that has a huge demand in developer, check out this course. But for this course, you need first to be a blockchain developer. So if you don't know blockchain development, you need to follow my other course first. Okay, so hi to people in the chat. Hi ThX.
00:01:29.538 - 00:01:52.474, Speaker A: And I'm sure there are more people, but maybe they are sleeping now. I don't see too many people today in the chat. What's going on, guys? Show your face. Okay, don't be shy. We're going to start with Ethereum. So Ethereum is recovering from the crash one week ago. We all remember there was this horrible crash.
00:01:52.474 - 00:02:29.482, Speaker A: I think there was something like -33% something like this. So I mean, it's really scary for newbies if it is their first crash in crypto. They think, oh my God, this is the end of the world, guys. This is really nothing. If you've been in crypto for a while before, for example, at some point for bitcoin, I think the largest crash that was like maybe six or seven years ago, it was like -95% okay, so this crash like -30% come on. This is really nothing. It's just the weak hands, like all the newbie that.
00:02:29.482 - 00:02:42.094, Speaker A: Oh my God. Oh my God, it's too much. I cannot take it anymore. No, it's crypto. It's why you can have the crazy gain. You have to be able to go through tubular in the period. So it's fine, it's fine.
00:02:42.094 - 00:03:07.618, Speaker A: I don't care. Like -30% -40% -50% I don't care. I'm still there. I don't even check the price. Who cares? Also very important statistic is the second week in a row where ether beats bitcoin. Very, very noticeable. Like before there was always bitcoin that has more performance than ether.
00:03:07.618 - 00:03:54.550, Speaker A: But maybe this is the beginning of the flippening. What I believe is that Ethereum is really undervalued to bitcoin. So going forward, it's better if ethereum doesn't go up too fast like we saw a couple of weeks ago, because if that go too fast, for sure, at some point all the buyer are exhausted and then you're going to have a big crash. So I just hope that the growth in the next few months is going to be a little bit slower so that it can be a little bit more smooth. But yeah, we don't have control over this. Unfortunately, very important for the price of ether. So grayscale, which is one of the major crypto fund, raised $700 million in a day.
00:03:54.550 - 00:04:35.010, Speaker A: So that's the largest money raise they've ever done. So the majority of this money is going to bitcoin. But now they also started to invest in ether. So it's also bullish for us. I mean, I'm sure you guys also hold some bitcoin, but when it comes to ether, it's going to be good as well on the gas price. So this week we are cooling down slightly compared to last week, but still we're on really high plateau. And now with the really high ether price, it's already becoming super expensive to do transaction on Ethereum.
00:04:35.010 - 00:05:24.178, Speaker A: So in terms of Ethereum 2.0 this week, there wasn't much traction, not many new money invested, but I mean, that's fine. We already have way enough, we don't need any more. Now, if we have more, it's a bonus, but it doesn't really impact the project today. So here you can see the yield that you will make now if you become a validator. So now we are below 10%, as we have more and more people is slightly going down. And then I like to check out bitcoin scan, which is the explorer for the Ethereum 2.0.
00:05:24.178 - 00:05:55.854, Speaker A: You can see the stats of the beacon chain. So the main chain of Ethereum 2.0. So here, network participation, like we're still very stable, close to 100%. Here you can see the blocks, everything's going fine. And for the active validator now we only have 50,000 pending before we had more. So, yeah, I mean, the number of new validators that are applying to be in east two is start to slow down a little bit, but that's normal. Like when Ethereum 2.0
00:05:55.854 - 00:06:29.830, Speaker A: was launched, there was this huge enthusiasm. Now it's declining a little bit, but yeah, in the future it's going to come back. All right, so today, exceptionally, exceptionally, I'm going to talk of some other blockchain. Usually I'm all about Ethereum, but this week I felt like there was some important news I needed to tell you. So first news about Polkadot. So Polkadot is a competitor to Ethereum. They built something that is a little bit similar to the vision of Ethereum 2.0
00:06:29.830 - 00:06:55.920, Speaker A: with a central blockchain and many separate blockchain. However, all of these blockchain are specialized contrary to Ethereum 2.0, where all of this, we call this. How do we call this. I forgot, what's the name? Anyway, all of the sub blockchain in Ethereum 2.0, they are exactly the same, whereas in Polkadot they are specialized. So anybody can add his or her own blockchain, from what I understand.
00:06:55.920 - 00:07:15.894, Speaker A: And so I find this super exciting, really. It's not just you do smart contract, but you can actually create your own sub blockchain. I'm super excited. It's been a long time. I haven't been excited by a blockchain project, I have to say. So, yeah, super good. So I think I'm going to start to study this project.
00:07:15.894 - 00:07:47.182, Speaker A: And what is interesting for their token is that it's still relatively cheap compared to other, which is very important for people in crypto. People like to see token with low price. So I see a lot of potential for appreciation for Polkadot. But of course, do your own research, be careful. Disclaimer, the whole thing. The whole thing. I'm not responsible except if you make money.
00:07:47.182 - 00:08:08.454, Speaker A: If you make money, I am responsible. Okay. If you make money, you tweet. It was thanks to Julian, but if you lose, you don't talk about it. All right, so next news. Dan, Larry Murray quit eos. So eos, that was supposed to be an Ethereum killer, but it didn't quite work out.
00:08:08.454 - 00:08:38.030, Speaker A: So you see the token price stay flat in 2020 while the rest of the crypto market was rallying. So clearly there's a big problem with this project. So to be transparent, I never like eos. I never liked the technology, and I didn't like the leadership, the technology. I already tried a couple of tutorial and I found that. That was so complicated. They use c plus plus and there is all this crazy tooling.
00:08:38.030 - 00:09:06.170, Speaker A: Yeah, that was just so kind of retarded compared to Ethereum. Really? So, yeah, I didn't understand why we have to make it so complex. Using C plus plus for smart contract. Are you kidding me? That's the worst choice possible. And about the leadership, Dan Larimer. So this guy's already the third project he abandoned. He abandoned beach share, which was the earliest crypto exchange.
00:09:06.170 - 00:09:43.480, Speaker A: He abandoned also steemit, which was a decentralized medium, like a decentralized blogging platform where authors were paid according to the number of views. My suggestion to EOS developers is just put your life jacket on, jump off the ship now, and swim to the Ethereum boat, because our boat is way bigger, it's nicer. We have more money, we have more people, we have a swimming pool on the top deck. I mean, come. It's going to be fun. It's going to be fun. Come now.
00:09:43.480 - 00:10:20.346, Speaker A: Okay, next news about the insurrection in the US. So the storming of the capital. So apparently there are some french guy that sends some bitcoin, $500,000 of bitcoin sent to the insurrectionist in the US. So now apparently France is in the conspiration. Omen, this is not good for France. I'm telling you, this is not good for us. America will attack us like we are funding the interaction with crypto.
00:10:20.346 - 00:10:46.380, Speaker A: Okay, this is very serious. I'm joking. I don't know if this is true or not, but I just think this is a really weird story. Like why someone in France would be very, very weird. As if they don't have enough money in the US. Come on, come on. Okay, so next, let's see the market cap of DFI, which keep going up.
00:10:46.380 - 00:11:23.062, Speaker A: So 25 billion this week. And the reason why I'm especially happy is because this time it's not just due to an increase of the price of ether, because the price of ether was pretty stagnant this week. It's actually due to the number of ether going up in the defi ecosystem. You can see, like, we had this long outflow, and finally this is flowing again in Defi. So this is, for me, the most important trend. So let's hope that this is going to continue. And then on the ranking side.
00:11:23.062 - 00:11:49.054, Speaker A: So maker still number one, but okay, let's switch back to USD value. Uniswap earned back is spot. So now it's the second project with like 4 billion locked. Wow, that's really huge. With a huge increase day to day. So congrats to Uniswap. I mean, to me, uniswap, it deserves to be number one or number two, really.
00:11:49.054 - 00:12:14.182, Speaker A: It's such an important project. And ave very good too. Compound in the top curve and sushiswap now you can see is like half of uniswap now synthetics also doing really well. The top derivative project on Ethereum. I'm happy for balancer too. Yeah, balancer for a long time it was like really way down in the ranking. Now it's very high.
00:12:14.182 - 00:12:31.740, Speaker A: I mean, now when I see this ranking, I feel like it really makes sense. It really makes sense. Maybe yon finance deserves to be a little bit higher, but yeah, Dydx. I think they deserve to. Dydx loop ring. I see these two, a lot of potential there. Yeah.
00:12:31.740 - 00:12:42.026, Speaker A: Set protocol. Set protocol also has a lot of potential. Hedge. Yeah, this is like option stuff. So potential but risky. Matic. Matic.
00:12:42.026 - 00:12:58.082, Speaker A: Oh my God. Matic is going to do something good. Matic. That's for sure. Okay. I think they've added some project before it stopped at like top 50, but now we have more project. Okay, cool.
00:12:58.082 - 00:13:15.962, Speaker A: So then let's have a look at the rate. So the rate this week, what do we have? Crazy. We have 20% for die on DYDX. Pretty sweet. 14% USDC on DYDX. Cool. Tether on compound 12%.
00:13:15.962 - 00:13:36.714, Speaker A: Yes. Very good tether. Because as you know, as you should know, I have some tether on compound. Okay. So I'm happy when it goes up. Okay, so next, let's see the winners and the loser for this week. So first the winner.
00:13:36.714 - 00:13:57.462, Speaker A: So we have perp. So that's basically a derivative project. It's doing super well. Mph. So this is a lending protocol. But what the difference with compound is that you have a fixed rate. So probably they do a lot of magic in the back end to make it a fixed rate.
00:13:57.462 - 00:14:26.506, Speaker A: Probably they use some sort of derivative or something like this. So yeah, interesting. I think giving you a fixed rate on your lending, on defi, this is something that's going to take off a lot because companies, they want to have some certainty when they invest their money. They want to know in advance how much it's going to make them. Curve finance. So yeah, curve finance is the top decentralized exchange for stablecoin. So cream.
00:14:26.506 - 00:14:38.894, Speaker A: This is a fork of a Defi project. I think this is the fork of compound. I think they're based in Taiwan, actually. Well, I should know. I am in Taiwan. Grt. So this is the token of the graph.
00:14:38.894 - 00:14:56.598, Speaker A: The graph. A lot of potential MTA. This is an algorithmic stablecoin if I'm not mistaken. So algorithmic stablecoin is still very experimental. Yeah, sushi is doing well. Edgeget, this is a defi derivative project, so quite speculative. One inch the aggregator.
00:14:56.598 - 00:15:26.062, Speaker A: This is really the market leader for aggregator I think a lot of potential for one inch uni. Yes, the leader of the centralized exchange. Yes. A lot of green this week. You know, like when you see so much green like this, you feel like, how about your formal factor guy? When you see so much green on the scale from zero to 100, how much is your formal factor? I mean mine is like 1000. So it's always the same thing. You see this and you're like, oh my God, you can't lose.
00:15:26.062 - 00:15:43.578, Speaker A: So then you start to put ten k and then next week, of course, everything is red. Always like this. Always like this. So then let's see the losers. Not many losers this week. And the loss are pretty limited compared to the wins. Okay, this one I have no idea.
00:15:43.578 - 00:16:19.250, Speaker A: Nec ESD, I don't know. Pico, this is a folk, some wrap bitcoin here. Wrap bitcoin, wrap bitcoin, wrap bitcoin genbtc not many loser in the famous DeFi protocol, mostly less known project. Okay, so next I want to talk of Dex volume. So we often hear people who say that DFI is just a fad. We had the Defi summer in 2020 and that's it. It will never come back.
00:16:19.250 - 00:16:44.122, Speaker A: Ha. You guys defy guy, you are so stupid. Blah blah. Well, for the last two weeks it was the best ever for Dex trading volume. And just halfway through January, we're already at the total of September volume. So I feel like we're going to have a very quick return of defi. Very quick.
00:16:44.122 - 00:17:16.530, Speaker A: This is going to be violent. This is going to be really violent. Okay, so next I wanted to show you this tweet of balladjees. I don't know how to pronounce his name properly. So his tweet is the crypto version of any product ends up being far more valuable than the original. Bitcoin, is already more valuable than PayPal, and will eventually be more valuable than gold, and the various defi apps on Ethereum will be more valuable than their fintech cognates. Actually, I'll learn a new word in English.
00:17:16.530 - 00:18:03.890, Speaker A: Who knows what's the meaning of cognate? Not even sure I say it properly. Okay, this is your challenge for next week. Try to use the word cognate in a sentence. Okay, this is your challenge, and next week you tell me how you manage this. So who is this guy? This guy is an angel investor and entrepreneur. He was formerly the CTO of Coinbase and is a general partner at Andresen Horowitz, which is one of the biggest vc in the Silicon Valley. He was also the co founder of various companies like Earn, which was acquired by Coinbase, and also Coin center, which is a non profit organization to lobby for the crypto industry.
00:18:03.890 - 00:18:26.198, Speaker A: So Coin center is not very known in the crypto Industry, I mean, except from the professional. The retail doesn't know anything about this, but this is very important. So yeah, so this guy clearly is someone super important in the crypto industry. And yeah, he give us this word of encouragement. But the more important guys is this new word, cognate. Okay. Enrich your vocabulary.
00:18:26.198 - 00:19:05.020, Speaker A: Okay, then we're going to continue with the news specific news for DeFi project. So, synthetics, they just launched their SNX staking live on optimistic ethereum l two. Okay, so we're going to decode this. What does this mean? So first of all, synthetics, if you've never heard about it, this is a derivative protocol on Ethereum. It allow you to create a synthetics assets. This is basically for advanced trader. If you're a beginner, synthetics is not for you.
00:19:05.020 - 00:19:50.226, Speaker A: So this is just a phase of the migration to l two scaling solution. So the migration of synthetics will be completed in several phases. So of course we're in the context of very high gas fees. Most d five protocol are trying to find a solution by moving to a side chain. So optimistic ethereum is one of the most promising l two scaling solutions. So right now there is a race between the various l two scaling solution to quickly attract as many defi protocol as possible so that they can become the sidechain for DFi. So the team of synthetics wrote a blog post to explain why they chose optimistic ethereum, because there are many, many other alternatives.
00:19:50.226 - 00:20:32.058, Speaker A: So the gist of it is that they have reviewed many l two scaling solution. They believe that the community is going to settle on optimistic ethereum, because first you can redeploy existing solidity smart contract without rewriting them for optimistic ethereum. So this is super important because you have other solution for scaling where they have specific smart contract language. So of course this requires a huge engineering effort to do the migration. So it's a big blocker. And second reason why they chose they think it's the best side chain is because you don't lose Composability, which is an extremely important requirement. DeFi is all about combining money legos.
00:20:32.058 - 00:21:10.178, Speaker A: So if you start to fragment the ecosystem, it really loses a lot of its value. So DeFi protocol try to avoid this. So according to synthetics, the experience of interacting with the protocol on optimism will be similar to what you have on l one. So the main chain, except that right now only metamask is accepted, and they are going to launch a new staking DAP for this migration. But for now, you have to use the old DAP. So I mean, it's not entirely ready. They have launched, but still some stuff to iron out, some little detail.
00:21:10.178 - 00:21:48.462, Speaker A: But overall, this is the first really big d five protocol that announced that actually start its migration to l two. So it's good. Very soon, I'm sure we're going to have like a couple of big DeFi protocol who migrated there and the fee will start to go down and we'll see even more money coming in Defi. That's the plan. That's the plan. Okay, so next, some news about stablecoin. So tether, which is the biggest stablecoin, just minted a record $2 billion in one week.
00:21:48.462 - 00:22:39.550, Speaker A: So now we have over 25 billion tether, who circulates across ethereum, if you want to make some comparison, one year ago it was only 5 billion. So that was a huge progression in one year. So the growth come from a variety of factors. So you have some people who don't put their trust in their local bank and currency who start to invest in stablecoin. Then the growth also come when traders start to aggressively sell bitcoin into tether, and the growth also come from. So I'm going to quote the article, the ability to see us to use tether as collateral for an increasing number of derivative products. So they are talking of default protocols like compound, et cetera.
00:22:39.550 - 00:23:27.118, Speaker A: Yeah, that's important development, the rise of the stablecoin, because really that's going to capture the attention of regulators. Regulators, okay, they might be a little bit concerned about bitcoin, but what they're really concerned about is stablecoin. So probably at some point this year we're going to see some friction between regulators and stablecoin. But this is like the mainstream adoption is going to go through. It's going to require the widestream adoption of stablecoins. Super important to follow the news, the updates about stablecoin. Then let's talk of some on the investment side.
00:23:27.118 - 00:24:10.054, Speaker A: Which startup raised money? So this app called what's this mapme, it's a travel app. They raised $50 million. So the fresh capital will go toward the launch of a multi currency wallet and enable a DFI ecosystem on their platform. Okay, so I have to say I am very surprised, so very surprised, because of two things. First, this is a travel app, and I don't know how they pulled it off, but they raised 50 million in the middle of the pandemic, where travel is probably the worst impacted industry. So I don't know how they were able to pull it off. These guys must be so smart, all the investors.
00:24:10.054 - 00:24:34.542, Speaker A: Stupid. I don't know. But yeah, they must be doing something amazing. Really? Because really, investors are not stupid. So, yeah, they must be doing something great. And I don't know, what's the relationship between travel app and defi this? I really didn't get it. But anyway, it's always good when you hear of a company that raised money, and this is to build defi project because it means more money to pay your salaries as developers.
00:24:34.542 - 00:25:16.346, Speaker A: So that's then some news about big bank. So Goldman Sachs is about to enter crypto market with crypto custodian. So let me give a bit of context here. So Goldman Sachs is one of the three big bank in the US, the other two being Citi and Morgan. So in the business world, Goldman Sachs is really one of the most prestigious bank, if not the most prestigious. When I was studying my master in finance in France, working at Goldman Sachs was the dream of most classmates. Like if you say your friends, your classmate, that you just had an interview at Goldman Sachs.
00:25:16.346 - 00:25:44.234, Speaker A: Oh my God, you're like a semi God. So it's really a big deal that they are thinking of moving to crypto. So if they move to crypto, it's going to be huge boost for the credibility of the entire industry. And are not the only one considering this move. JP Morgan is also considering becoming a crypto custodian. So we might have two big us bank who become crypto custodian this year. So an interesting quote from the article is this.
00:25:44.234 - 00:26:26.054, Speaker A: A tectonic shift took place in the role of crypto custody this week as San Francisco based Anchorage attained conditional approval from the OCCs. That's a regulator in the US to become a national digital bank and unequivocally meet the definition of qualified custodian in the process. Okay, so remember last week, the OCC. So the regulator said that banks will be allowed to transfer stablecoin. So yeah, things are moving really fast for stablecoin and regulation. And I'm really surprised. I was expecting the regulators to be super against stablecoin, but recently we had some super bullish news.
00:26:26.054 - 00:27:15.394, Speaker A: So yeah, let's wait and see. Okay, so next for regulation, some news from Christine Lagade, which is the head of the European Central bank. So she has called for global regulation on bitcoin, leveling the cryptocurrency. Reprehensible. So Christine Lagade, for those who don't know, was also the ministry of finance in France ten years ago. And I know it because she used to be the boss of my dad. Yes, my dad used to work at the french ministry of finance, and sometime on the weekend he would be on call and once in a while there were some issues and he had to fix stuff in emergency.
00:27:15.394 - 00:27:56.062, Speaker A: Can you imagine the stress guy, it's like the president of your country. So you're a developer, okay, the president of your country call you and say, hey, what's up with the tax? What's up? Like your code took all the money in the bank account. We said the tax rate is 20%, not 100%. People are breaking everything in the street, they are furious. Fix the bug now. And then you have five minutes to fix the bug in your Javascript code to fix for the entire country. So then you find it, you fix it, you write the test, you commit the code, you push to GitHub, you trigger continuous integration, push to production, run database migration, refund excess tax, and boom, problem solved.
00:27:56.062 - 00:28:12.150, Speaker A: And the president give you a thumb up emoji on GitHub. Nice job. And then that's it, back to Netflix. Nothing happened. Okay, guys, I think I went a little bit too far, so I'm afraid that there are only 5% of people who understood my joke. It's programmer you more. Okay.
00:28:12.150 - 00:28:56.600, Speaker A: You will understand once you're programming Jedi. Okay, so next, still talking of a programmer, but this time it's not about you more. Well, I mean, maybe it's funny for us, but not for him. So this guy, he forgot his private key, he lose all of his bitcoin? So Stefan Thomas, a german born programmer living in San Francisco, has two guesses left to figure out a password that is worth, out of this week, $220,000,000. Well, actually now it's 260. The password will let him unlock a small hard drive known as an iron key, which contain a private key to a digital wallet that hold 7002 bitcoin. 7002, very important.
00:28:56.600 - 00:29:38.418, Speaker A: So the problem is that Mr. Toma years ago, lost the paper where he wrote down the password for his iron key, which gives user ten guesses before it sees up and encrypts the content forever. So can you imagine how stressed out he will be when he will try, when he will do his last two attempts? Oh my God. What would you do? I don't know. Hire a psychologist to try to get into your mind and see what is the most likely password. What's the process? It's like you have to do an investigation in yourself. Okay, I know what he should do.
00:29:38.418 - 00:30:00.694, Speaker A: I know what he should do. He should create a prediction market, a defi prediction market for whether or not he's going to figure out the password. And he buy a lot of the negative bet. Okay. That's how it's going to monetize the situation with Defi. You always have a solution. Okay? And then he tries the two remaining combination and when he does this, he should stream it on YouTube.
00:30:00.694 - 00:30:34.862, Speaker A: Seriously, it's gonna make so many views. This is gonna be insane. But yeah, it's actually sad for him. But you know what? What I think about this is the money that is too easily gained can also be too easily lost. So that's why I don't really get jealous of people who win the lottery. They don't really appreciate the real value of their money because they didn't really work hard to get it. In general, sometimes you hear about crazy stories like this, but that's fine.
00:30:34.862 - 00:30:56.214, Speaker A: We are normal people. We have to work hard to make money. That's. So then some news for developers. So there is this article of Andre Kronhe that wrote about building Defi as a dev. So it's a follow up of a rent that he wrote almost a year ago. So some context.
00:30:56.214 - 00:31:20.494, Speaker A: So Andre works on a lot of DeFi projects. At the same time, I think it's probably overworked and he received a lot of complaints from users on Twitter. So I think he's just on too many projects at the same time. So this is the perfect recipe for burning out. So let's see what he has to say. He say, I quote, development takes time much longer than even you as a developer think it will. Nine out of ten ideas will fail.
00:31:20.494 - 00:31:51.034, Speaker A: You can spend months or years building on something that conceptually you thought would take a few weeks. This is part of the process. So what do I have to say about this lesson? You need investment. Okay? If you want to launch your own defi project, you do the prototype yourself. But quickly you need to do some research to find how you can get some vcs to invest in your project. Because probably it's going to take years before you actually launch the full version. So factor in this element.
00:31:51.034 - 00:32:31.494, Speaker A: If you want to launch your Defi project, you will need some investment at some point. Okay, so next quote of this article, but now add hundreds, sometimes thousands of people shouting on telegram, discord and twitter when it will be released. Why hasn't been released? Give us an update and often significantly more hostile messages. So take something that is already difficult and make it exponentially worse. As Defi developer, our work is incredibly public. The good, more eyes, more peer review, faster development cycles. The bad, your mistake, are used as ammunition against you and you will use for weeks and months after they have been rectified.
00:32:31.494 - 00:33:23.690, Speaker A: Your delays are seen as incompetence and your failures are amplified tenfold. So what do I have to say about this? It's true that the way we develop software and blockchain and Defi is just totally different from other area of the tech industry because there is all this money that is involved. Most blockchain projects have some sort of tokens with many retail investors, whereas for traditional startups you have professional investors, vcs, who do not expect new features being shipped every single day, who do not expect some financial result in the next months or even the next year. This guy, really patient. So yeah, we get all this really investor with unrealistic expectation. But on the other hand, we get funding way more easily in the blockchain industry. So it's really the other side of the coin, or should I say the other side of the token.
00:33:23.690 - 00:33:45.502, Speaker A: So I mean, really, we can have it all. We don't control the reaction of all these people, we just have to accept it. If you want to be a builder in blockchain defi, you will have that kind of shitty reaction site. For example, on my channel I have a couple of haters from time to time. I got used to it. My technique is very simple. I just do not engage with the haters.
00:33:45.502 - 00:34:10.966, Speaker A: It's as simple as this. If you feel like someone is being negative and does not add anything to the conversation, no constructive criticism, you just ignore the message. You hide a message, block them, who cares? You're busy, you have stuff to do, you stay focused on your goal and you ignore the irrelevant stuff. That's it. That's the price to success. You will have this, it's no big deal. So yeah, that's what I have to say in response of this article of Andre Corone.
00:34:10.966 - 00:34:38.590, Speaker A: And last thing I want to show you is this site of one of my students. So that's basically like a Reddit for crypto. So it's really beautiful. It's simple. It can easily be monetized with ads and it already adds some user, as you can see. So I really love it. So I wanted to show you this to show you that you don't need to do something complicated.
00:34:38.590 - 00:34:59.674, Speaker A: You can start with a simple project and can be useful and you can have some traction quickly. So, yeah, that was the inspiration of the week. Okay, so now I'm going to do the Q A. So let me post quickly the link to the. Okay, so. So let's scroll up. Let's see who is here.
00:34:59.674 - 00:35:23.380, Speaker A: Hi, Akesh. Miho. Tucano, Joe. Bstn, Batman, Ford. Cenobite. Abracadabra. Edwin, you is asking me, is Defi yield farming out yet? Just after the video today, I was scripting the video just after, I will record it.
00:35:23.380 - 00:35:59.334, Speaker A: Abracadabra. Oh, it's called substrate. Oh, yeah, you were responding to when I was talking of Polkadot. So Miho saying there is a lot of hype on Cardano. Yeah, I haven't really followed Cardano, but already with Polkadot, I don't have enough time to be on Ethereum and Polkadot and Cardano. So really, I don't see what's so revolutionary about Cardano. Like Polkadot, I can really see the difference compared to Ethereum, but Cardano, it just feels like some sort of alternative version of Ethereum with a couple of years of delay.
00:35:59.334 - 00:36:29.218, Speaker A: Basically nothing groundbreaking. Denny's on what's the best your course to start to become a blockchain developer? If I have a front end development, you. So you need to have a background in web development to do my course on blockchain development. So, yeah, if you want to become a blockchain developer, then you can take my course. Six figure blockchain developer. You have the good background. And after, if you want to specialize in Defi, you can take the course on Defi.
00:36:29.218 - 00:36:43.414, Speaker A: But first, the basics is six figure blockchain development. Let me see. Adrian Tron. Look nice. The energy thing in there. Tron. I'm not a fan of Tron.
00:36:43.414 - 00:37:09.454, Speaker A: For me, it's just a copy paste of Ethereum. I never really saw what was so incredible by this. Deborah. I'm having one white flag for you, Julian, so no stress. Oh, yes. When I was talking of this french guy who sent some bitcoin to the insurrectionist in the US. Crypto.
00:37:09.454 - 00:37:27.546, Speaker A: Saying what? Crypto? Dz asking, what do you think about harmony project? I don't know. I don't know, I will check it out after the live abracadabra. Question for Julian. Okay, this is what I love about abracadabra. He always say, question for Julian. So I know this is a question for me. Love it.
00:37:27.546 - 00:38:04.578, Speaker A: So if you have to choose Uniswap or one inch or sushi. Oh my God. Oh, tough question. Well, I would say uniswap first and one inch a close second. Yeah. Because Uniswap has been there for so long. So really at this point it has been the risk a lot, but one inch, I think one inch is more risky, but maybe it has more potential than Uniswap because it's really going to be a protocol that give you access to the end users.
00:38:04.578 - 00:38:40.726, Speaker A: So in the future probably that everybody will use some sort of exchange aggregator like one inch. So Uniswap will be more like a sort of backend protocol and you'll have some sort of front end protocol in front of it that probably capture most of the value. Yeah. So that's why I have to say. What do you think about link, Ronnie saying this? Well, I mean they are the leader for oracles and oracles are super useful. So yeah, bullish on link. Okay, rakadabra.
00:38:40.726 - 00:39:07.190, Speaker A: Say Ben? Could be, maybe, maybe. But I think the ecosystem of chainlink is way more developed than Ben. Okay, question for Julian. Abracadabra, how you see the main net of Cardano could be that so massive. So I've just studied Cardano like maybe a couple of months ago. I checked their technology and everything seems so backward. Like their programming language, the tooling.
00:39:07.190 - 00:39:23.390, Speaker A: I was like, oh my God. It was basically like Ethereum in 2015. Like they're starting from the beginning and they're posting this news. Oh yeah, it's so exciting. And in six months we can do some smart contract. Great. Guys, you are just a six year late.
00:39:23.390 - 00:39:58.140, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I really don't see it happening for Cardano. Abracadabra. Yes. SNX have a lot since $3. Nice profit question for Julian, what do you think about the tether suit? Could that harm defi? Actually I didn't even follow that news. But I know tether has been through a couple of controversy at this point. Seems like they were able to figure it out in the past.
00:39:58.140 - 00:40:32.630, Speaker A: They have some big corporate backing, so I think they will figure it out. But if you don't feel comfortable with tether, you can switch to USDC or DAi. Actually maybe USDC better because Dai in the back end, they use some tether as collateral. Okay, let's see. Let's see, what do we have next? Ron Miller. Hello from Dallas, Texas. Yeah, hi, Ron.
00:40:32.630 - 00:41:00.970, Speaker A: I always wanted to visit Texas, man. One day I want to visit the south of the US, like maybe do a road trip from Las Vegas to the east coast, like going through all the national park and with all this scene that we see in movies like the Red Mountain. I don't know the name of this. I think it's near the Grand Canyon. Like you have so many of this landscape. Yeah. Abracadabra.
00:41:00.970 - 00:41:30.566, Speaker A: Question for Julian. Any news about the ERC 31 3370? My God. Oh yeah, I think you asked me so many times. Hey, you know what? Okay, you know what? I'm going to put it right away on my to do list for the next week because I think you've been asking me for a month something like this. Actually, I was about to do it last week, but I messed up with the number. So I think I searched something like ERC three three seven, and I was like, oh, I cannot find it. Okay, but now I get it.
00:41:30.566 - 00:42:23.654, Speaker A: Like 31 three seven. Ariel saying, is three t going to change drastically in Ethereum 2.0? No, because they're going to keep the same EVM, the Ethereum virtual machine, so there is no reason to change. Also, keep in mind that solidity, the programming language you use to write the smart contract, is not what actually runs in the blockchain, because this is compiled to something that is called the EVM opcode. So even if something were to change at the EVM base at the EVM level, then in the code of the 3d compiler, that makes the translation from the high level three t code to the low level opcode, they can update this path so that the opcode it produced is different. But for you, the programmer, what you see will be the same. So first of all, the EVM will stay the same.
00:42:23.654 - 00:43:13.714, Speaker A: And even if it change, there are ways to keep it the same. For programmer Lloyd, question your physique figure course include 8 hours of support from you? Or did I say anything like this in a sales page? No. Okay, so you have support from me in the sense that if you have question, you can ask me by email or you can send me in the chat. But just to be clear, I don't assign a number to this, it's just when you have a question, you ask me. But you don't have a dedicated number of hour, or you don't have like 8 hours of private one to one, if that's what you're asking. It's just the course is what you pay for this is the access to the video plus the community where you can ask question to me and to other students. Yeah, Bt.
00:43:13.714 - 00:44:05.290, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. If you have question about the course, I will help you. I will unstuck you. Crypto Muslin, any thought on XDai? Have you looked into using it as a layer? Yeah, actually I was doing some research for a tutorial a couple of months ago and I compare it to Matic and it seems like Matic was more developed and I've heard more projects that are considering maybe matic. So number one, it seems like optimistic Ethereum is gaining most traction. Then matic close number two and then Xdai. THX, where can I post links on either blocks? What do you mean ThX? I don't know what you mean posting links on either blocks.
00:44:05.290 - 00:44:31.326, Speaker A: Lloyd saying I came in late. Was the optimism l two soft launch covered? No, it wasn't, but I covered the migration of synthetics to optimism. But I think you were asking about optimism itself. There is abracadabra. There is tether suit running right now. Okay, well, thanks. Abracadabra.
00:44:31.326 - 00:44:57.562, Speaker A: We're going to check that up. Kelly Ben Osman. Hi, Julian. Question for Julian. What's the best ecosystem to build NFT? Good question. So I know that Tron was popular for, is popular for games, but now we start to see more and more NFT that are mixed with Defi. And so for that, Ethereum will be better.
00:44:57.562 - 00:45:34.774, Speaker A: Also the main marketplace for NFT, they are on Ethereum. So yeah, I would say Ethereum, even though you have the high gas fees, still mt, do you have a course to price option or price option that included all videos? Okay, so this was during Black Friday. There was an offer for everything, but now I don't have one. Probably for next Black Friday I will do another one. Yeah, but not right now. Crypto. Stanley, I have an awesome project idea.
00:45:34.774 - 00:46:25.486, Speaker A: Can we collaborate together? I'm super busy on my mean, you can send me what you want to do and maybe I can try to link you up with someone, but most likely it's going to be tough. Shazan, Tariq. Hi, Julian. Hi, Shazin. Yeah, so Shazan is one of my students and recently he's been killing it on some freelancer. I mean, really, congratulations, because sometimes it's a bit hard to start on freelancer website, but yeah, Tariq, you're doing great as a freelancer. Okay, so ThX, I want to post links on how to get TikTok coin back, but ThX, are you in a private of.
00:46:25.486 - 00:46:33.560, Speaker A: I think you are. One of my student. Right. Yeah. You can post in the discord. Yeah. Okay.
00:46:33.560 - 00:47:00.800, Speaker A: I think we are reaching the end of the question. Maybe I can wait like another 10 seconds just to see if we have the last questions. But after, we are going to wrap it up. Oh, yeah. So for people who arrive late, the tooling to my main course is so course on Defi, this one and six figure blockchain developer. This one. Okay.
00:47:00.800 - 00:47:11.160, Speaker A: Yes. So you can post anything you want in a private discord. No problem. Yeah. In a general chat. It's good. It.
00:47:11.160 - 00:47:24.820, Speaker A: Okay. So, guys, I think that's it. Yeah. So, yeah, thanks for coming and I will see you later on my channel this week. Have a great day. Bye, guys.
