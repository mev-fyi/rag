Liquid staking token with traditional staking, you earn some yield in exchange of securing the ethereum network, but you have to lock your ether with liquid staking. However, you get a liquidity staking token in exchange of your stake. Ether liquid staking tokens are regular ERC 20 tokens, and you can use them as collateral in DeFi protocols to earn even more yield. For example, you can use them to lend money on compound or be a market maker on uniswap, and that would come on top of your staking yield. If you are a webster developer and you want to leverage this trend, you could build a yield farming app for liquid staking token.
