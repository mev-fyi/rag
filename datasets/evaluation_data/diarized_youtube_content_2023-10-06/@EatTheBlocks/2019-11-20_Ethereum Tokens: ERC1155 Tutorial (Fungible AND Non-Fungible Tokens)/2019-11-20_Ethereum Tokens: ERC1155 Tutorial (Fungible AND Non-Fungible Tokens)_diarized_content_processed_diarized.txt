00:00:00.250 - 00:00:42.086, Speaker A: Hey, this is Julian and you are on it. The blocks. And in this video, I'm going to explain what is ERC 1155. So with ERC 20, you can represent fungible assets, and with ERC 721, you can represent nonfungible assets. But sometimes there are several ERC 20 token or several ERC 721, or even a combination of both that are related, for example, in collectible games like cryptokitties. So you can have your character, but also some accessories or for events, you can have different categories of sitting economy, premium, et cetera. And that will force you to deploy many ERC 20 token and many ERC 721 token.
00:00:42.086 - 00:01:19.858, Speaker A: And that's a bit complicated to manage all these different smart contract. So it would be really nice if you could manage all these assets in a single contract. And that's exactly what ERC 1155 does. So with ERC 1155, you can have any combination of fungible and nonfungible assets. So it's a sort of combination between ERC 20 and ERC 721. So you identify each asset with a token id, like for ERC 721. However, unlike ERC 721, you are not restricted to an amount of one for each asset.
00:01:19.858 - 00:01:54.622, Speaker A: So if an asset has an amount of one, that's a nonfungible asset. Otherwise that's fungible. You are free to have any combination you want. All right, let's see the solidity interface. So first, let's start by the most important function, safe transfer, from which is used to transfer token. So in the case of ERC 1155, so you use it both for delegated transfer and for normal transfer. So when you transfer a token, like for ERC 721, you need to specify its id and you can also forward some data to the recipient.
00:01:54.622 - 00:02:49.794, Speaker A: If this is a smart contract, in all cases, it required that if the recipient is a smart contract, it implements the receiver interface of ERC 1155. So your recipient smart contract has to implement these two function on ERC received and on ERC 1155, batch received for batch transfer. And for each of this function, the recipient smart contract can also receive some additional data here. And that leads me to the other transfer function, save batch transfer. From that allow you to transfer several token at the same time. So you'll specify an array of recipients and an array of token id, so the recipient can be different addresses, all the same one. For example, in the case of a character in a game, then you can have a set of accessories that belong to the same character and you want to transfer them all at once.
00:02:49.794 - 00:03:34.478, Speaker A: So next, to get the balance of an address we have two function, balance of and balance of batch. So the first one balance of gives you the token balance for a specific token id and a specific ethereum address. And for the other function balance of batch, it's the same thing, but you can specify an array of owners and also an array of token ids. So that's very useful if you want to have the balance of all the tokens owned by a specific address. And finally, there are two function related to third party transfer. So with ERC 1155 you can allow another Ethereum address to spend all your token on your behalf. So you will call this set approval for all function.
00:03:34.478 - 00:04:24.030, Speaker A: You will specify who is the address allowed to spend a token on your behalf and if you want to approve it for the second field you pass the Boolean value true. Otherwise if you want to revoke the approval then you pass false. And you can also know if an address has been approved by an owner by calling is approval for all. And once an operator has been approved he will call the safe batch transfer from function or the safe transfer from function. And next, there is an optional interface for ES 1155. So that's the metadata interface. So in this extension you have a single function that text as argument, a token id and it returned a string which is a URL that's going to return a JSON document with all the metadata of the token.
00:04:24.030 - 00:05:00.214, Speaker A: So in the ERC 1155 specification there is a description of the structure of this JSON document. So you can have a name, a description, an image and all this stuff. But the point is that you will define the metadata of your tokens outside the blockchain. Also you will notice that there is no global metadata for the whole ES 1155 token. So there is no name function, no symbol function, no decimals. This is managed individually for each token and outside the blockchain. So with all these tokens, standard ES 27 20, 111 55, et cetera.
00:05:00.214 - 00:05:43.314, Speaker A: That's really a lot of information to learn. So that's why I've prepared this short cheat sheet with the most important information summarized in a single place. If you want to get it, all you have to do is to follow the link in the description. All right, that's it for this tutorial on ERC 1155 tokens. If you want to know more about the standard you can check out the official specification at this address. In the next video I'll explain ERC one 4100, which is a token standard for security tokens. So contrary to all the tokens we've seen so far, it's been designed to comply with existing regulation, and thanks to this compliance with regulation, it's actually way easier to represent real life assets with this token.
00:05:43.314 - 00:05:51.626, Speaker A: So make sure to watch this video. If you have any question, post your question in the comments down below. Thanks for watching guys. See you for my next video. Bye.
