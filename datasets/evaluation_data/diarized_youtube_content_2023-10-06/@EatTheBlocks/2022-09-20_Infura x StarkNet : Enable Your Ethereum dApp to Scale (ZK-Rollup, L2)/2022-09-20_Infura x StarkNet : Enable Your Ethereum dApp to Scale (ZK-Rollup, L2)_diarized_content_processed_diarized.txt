00:00:03.370 - 00:00:08.990, Speaker A: Welcome back, YouTube. This video is brought to you by consensus, a market leading blockchain technology company.
00:00:09.140 - 00:00:10.654, Speaker B: Today we're going to be talking about.
00:00:10.692 - 00:00:17.594, Speaker C: One of their partners, Starknet. Starknet is a leading L2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain.
00:00:17.722 - 00:00:20.346, Speaker A: The Starknet wide release with developer tools.
00:00:20.378 - 00:00:25.990, Speaker C: From Infura provides highly anticipated benefits to developers and end users alike.
00:00:26.410 - 00:00:53.870, Speaker A: If you're new here, I'm jack and on eat the blocks. We help web two developers get into web3. Starknet is a permissionless, decentralized ZK rollup. DAP users can benefit from better scaling without compromising security, higher throughput and lower transaction costs. On Starknet, the rough numbers are a 40 x scale compared to Ethereum. Developers are able to rapidly build, test.
00:00:53.940 - 00:01:23.602, Speaker C: And deploy Ethereum based dapps with out of the box programming templates and instructions available through the truffle box for Starknet. They can also deploy and scale on Starknet with the newly integrated Starknet chain on Infura. All of this while mitigating and reducing risk by leveraging diligence's security and smart contract audit service. I will also explain later how devs can expand the functionalities of metamask for the needs of their unique DAP. With metamask snap Starknet was created by the company Starkware.
00:01:23.746 - 00:01:30.646, Speaker A: Their main mission is to bring low fees, high speed, scalability and interoperability to the blockchain.
00:01:30.838 - 00:01:47.850, Speaker C: Starkware improves many different parts of the blockchain. Some of their main use cases include nfts, derivative trading, automated market makers, and spot trading. Starkware has already partnered with many big and trusted blockchain companies, including DyDX, Immutable.
00:01:47.930 - 00:01:50.382, Speaker A: Openzeppelin Ledger, and more.
00:01:50.516 - 00:02:12.114, Speaker C: A lot of these companies also interact with the Starknet blockchain. Starknet is built on top of ZK Starks invented by Starkware. They enforce the integrity and privacy of computations on the blockchain using novel cryptographic proofs and modern algebra. ZK starks allow blockchains to move computations to a single off chain Stark prover.
00:02:12.242 - 00:02:14.534, Speaker B: They then verify the integrity of these.
00:02:14.572 - 00:02:57.394, Speaker C: Computations using an on chain stark verifier. So what does all this mean exactly? Well, starks being zero knowledge means that the inputs used by off chain provers are not exposed to the blockchain, which protects people's privacy. They're scalable because moving all computations off chain exponentially reduces the blockchain verification costs. They are transparent because the security of zkstarks doesn't rely on setup ceremonies. These ceremonies would usually use multiparty computations where they all add their own randomness to verify integrity. This creates extra input data that needs to be kept hidden from the rest of the blockchain. ZK starks are all transparent and nothing needs to be kept hidden.
00:02:57.394 - 00:03:34.414, Speaker C: Lastly, ZK starks have argument of knowledge or Ark proofs can only be generated by an offchain prover that executed the computation along with all needed auxiliary inputs required by it. So now that you know the basics of Starknet, let's talk about its partnership. On June 29, 2022, Consensus and Starkware announced a strategic partnership and a set of product integrations that will make Starknet the first ZK rollup L2 supported by Metamask. This isn't just normal metamask though. To actually understand how this works, we need to take a look at Metamask.
00:03:34.462 - 00:03:58.306, Speaker D: Flask and snap introducing metamask flask and snaps for developers Metamask Flask is a fork of metamask for developers, a parallel distribution with our most cutting edge features and ideas. The first such feature is snaps. Snaps lets developers introduce snippets of code to extend the functionality of metamask and create completely new kinds of dapps.
00:03:58.498 - 00:04:15.134, Speaker C: Alright, so this is exactly what they have done. Consensus and Starkware have created a starknet snap for developers to build with. This would not be possible before due to Starknet being a non EVM network. Infura has also added Starknet to its platform and they are now opening its.
00:04:15.172 - 00:04:16.846, Speaker A: Private beta to the public so that.
00:04:16.868 - 00:04:19.006, Speaker C: All developers can experience the power of.
00:04:19.028 - 00:04:20.970, Speaker A: The infura network on Starknet.
00:04:21.050 - 00:04:27.582, Speaker B: Developers can now access the Stark network via Infura API endpoints with the Starknet JSON RPC methods.
00:04:27.726 - 00:05:09.566, Speaker C: Cairo is the main programming language for Starknet, but due to Infura, developers can implement their business logic and their smart contract of choice and deploy it on Starknet. For example, solidity smart contracts deployed on Ethereum can choose to route transactions to Starknet with the Infura endpoints provided to them. To try out the integration of Metamask and Starknet, you'll first need to install Metamask flask in your browser. Head over to Metamask IO flask to find a link to download the Google Chrome extension. Once flask has been installed, you can then install the Starknet snap. I will leave a link to this app in the description. Once downloaded, a Starknet account will be deployed automatically for you.
00:05:09.566 - 00:05:26.006, Speaker C: You are now able to deploy more accounts, make transactions on the Starknet, and interact with Starknet smart contracts. You can now integrate your own Starknet dapps and experiment with them through Metamask. If you haven't developed on the Stark network before, no problem.
00:05:26.188 - 00:05:29.042, Speaker B: Watch out for EattheBlock's next video on Starknet.
00:05:29.106 - 00:05:30.418, Speaker C: We'll show you how to take advantage.
00:05:30.434 - 00:05:41.366, Speaker B: Of Starknet for your solidity project using the Infura platform. Shown here is an automated market maker app, something that you could use a Starknet to build. Alright everyone, that's it for this video.
00:05:41.468 - 00:05:43.140, Speaker C: Thanks for watching and I'll see you later.
