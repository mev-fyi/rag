00:00:02.150 - 00:00:32.820, Speaker A: You. And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and defy. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. So in this video, I'm going to be talking, of course, of course, of GameStop, the full story of how amateur traders cause billions of dollars of losses to Wall street hedge funds. Everybody is talking about this.
00:00:32.820 - 00:01:11.680, Speaker A: Then we're going to talk of the Reddit partnership between Ethereum and Reddit. This is really big news. Then Mark Cuban, the famous billionaire, moves to NFT. And then I'm going to show you how you can do a mining rig in your lambo. Yes. If you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host, and on my channel, etherblocks, I teach blockchain development. And if you are new here and you want to learn how you can become a blockchain developer, make $100,000 a year and work remotely, check my free training.
00:01:11.680 - 00:02:09.726, Speaker A: Okay, actually, it's the wrong address, Julian. Why is this the wrong URL? This is the correct URL. Okay. This URL here, this is my free training. Okay, so let's move on to the price of ether. So what happened this week? That was a little bit of a roller coaster? Yes, a lot of movements. So first we couldn't really break off the all time high, so we went down, then we hit a support, then we try to climb back to the all time high again, but there was a new resistance, so it fell.
00:02:09.726 - 00:03:11.158, Speaker A: And so now we are back in the middle. So, yeah, I mean, nothing is happening now, but probably we're going to have a big breakout now because we've really tested all the support. Okay, so what's coming? So I found some info about institutional investors who are buying ether. So I quote the article, ether latest really to all time high appears to be driven in part by the sort of institutional investor who pile into bitcoin in 2020 for its digital gold narrative. So exactly as expected, now we have some movement from bitcoin to ethereum. I quote again, more institutional investors are seeing ether as a store of value. According to Coinbase annual review for 2020, the crypto exchange noticed a growing number of its institutional clients who have taken position in ether for a strong return.
00:03:11.158 - 00:03:54.930, Speaker A: These clients predominantly bought bitcoin in 2020. Yeah, so first they come for bitcoin and after they continue with Ethereum. So next we're going to talk of the partnership between Ethereum and Reddit. So it's super important. So it was announced on Reddit itself. So I quote the post to explain what's going on. Our intention is to help accelerate the progress being made on scaling and develop the technology needed to launch large scale applications like community points on Ethereum.
00:03:54.930 - 00:04:47.700, Speaker A: We introduced community points last year to give more ownership and control back to users through decentralized technology. So currently community points are only on two subreddits, cryptocurrency and another one for Fortnite. And it's only live on the rink B networks, not on main net. So it's a little bit vague. They didn't say exactly what this partnership is going to do, but my guess is that they're going to build l two scaling solution which will be specialized for social media. And I find this very exciting because Reddit has the most important thing, which is a big user base. So if they build something that work, it will be used.
00:04:47.700 - 00:05:25.850, Speaker A: And as you know, we are in the middle of this crazy censorship by big tech. Everybody realized this, I think. So it's just a matter of time before we start to get some decentralized social media. So I'm happy to read it start to help for this. So it's not probably going to have to wait before something is ready, but it's really going in the right direction. Okay, so next we're going to talk of very important mining rig for ether. So question for you guys, what is more cool than a lambo? A mining ring in a lambo.
00:05:25.850 - 00:05:50.710, Speaker A: Okay, so everything is powered by the battery of the car. And an important detail, the trunk needs to stay open to avoid overheating, otherwise your lambo will burn. Okay. You don't want this to happen. And another important detail, you need to have your license place, which is called holdler. So these guys did all of this. He's a real crypto fan.
00:05:50.710 - 00:06:30.062, Speaker A: All right, then we're going to see the gas usage for Ethereum. So it's overheating again. Like we can see the gas fee is reaching 100 gwe on a regular basis. So yeah, the next defi cycle we've already started is already there. Then let's see quickly what's happening on east two. Yeah, we didn't have too many new contribution this week. It's stable.
00:06:30.062 - 00:06:59.918, Speaker A: Also, knife, your stake is at 9.2. And in terms of the activity on the network, mostly, okay, we have the big drop in participation here, 96, but globally. Okay. And here we can see all the empty block being mine. And here we can see we still have some validators that are asking to join Ethereum 2.0. We have 76,000 validators. So very soon we're going to have 100,000.
00:06:59.918 - 00:07:26.770, Speaker A: This is way more than the number of miners on eth one. So this is really the goal of Ethereum 2.0 to be much more decentralized. All right, so now let's see the market cap for DFI. So 27 billion this week. So we reach all time high here this week after we are like this big drop. But now we're like we're back on track in terms of the number of ether that is invested in Defi.
00:07:26.770 - 00:08:06.660, Speaker A: We keep going up. So this is extremely important because otherwise sometimes you see the market cap of defi, which is going up, but it's only due to the price of ether. But you need to make sure that actually the number of ether in the system is also increasing, which is the pretty slightly above what we had one week ago, but still slowly going down. And in the ranking we had quite a lot of change this week. So now ave, number two, Uniswap. Number four, sushi swap is really well behind sushi swap. Uniswap now 1 billion difference between both.
00:08:06.660 - 00:08:31.910, Speaker A: Yeah. So next let's see the rates. So what's crazy for the interest rate this week? So 33 freaking percent for die on dy. DX. If you lend your die, it's pretty insane. USDC, almost 11% here. Otherwise nothing crazy at tether here, 7% on compound, 8% on Ave.
00:08:31.910 - 00:08:57.694, Speaker A: Yeah, it's nice. Okay, so next we're going to see the top Defi coin. So this week we had this crazy performance of bot. I have to admit my ignorance, this is the first time I hear about this protocol. 300 freaking percent. Then 240% for badger. See, this is a dao.
00:08:57.694 - 00:09:36.720, Speaker A: So apparently they're doing really well. But I did some research on Twitter and apparently there is a multi sig admin key that controls everything. So it's not really an ideal governance. So apparently they want to update this in the future. But yeah, every time you see this in the smart contract and admin key that control everything, it's not really ideal. Then what do we have? So index, this is a yield optimizer, like yarn finance doing super well. What is dodo? This is a new kind of Dex doing super well.
00:09:36.720 - 00:09:56.182, Speaker A: Cake. So this is basically one of the top defi project on binance smart chain, like almost doubling in value one inch, one inch. The Defi aggregator. I told you guys, I told you guys a couple of weeks ago. I told you about one inch. And look at that. Look at that.
00:09:56.182 - 00:10:48.722, Speaker A: If you had listened to me so yeah, I told you around this time, like at the beginning, first half of January, I talk of one inch and look at what happened to the freaking token. It's just a real explosion. Okay, so make sure to listen to Julian. All right, next we're going to continue with the update for the DeFi project. So Kyber, they just announced their v three. So they want to transform into a hub of liquidity protocol, each specialized for a different use case. And they are also going to launch what they call a dynamic market maker, which allow liquidity pool creators to customize.
00:10:48.722 - 00:11:29.566, Speaker A: The pricing curve seems complicated, so actually it just means something simple. It means that the liquidity provider will earn more or less relative to their contribution size. So if you are like a big contributor, you will earn more compared to a small one. So this will incentivize. Well then ether will not longer be the only quote currency. So now the pool will allow multi quote pair and direct token to token. So exactly like on uniswap.
00:11:29.566 - 00:12:12.062, Speaker A: So it will be a little bit more flexible and they will maybe add a derivatives protocol as well. So in other words, it's going to become much more, much bigger, much more complex, much more feature. So what do I think of all of this? Okay, so what's the situation here is that Uniswap is the main competitor of Kyber. A big reason for the success of Uniswap is because it's so simple. But with this new upgrade, Kyber will be more powerful than Uniswap. Yes, but it will also be much more complex. So I wonder if it's going to be like with balancer, which is more powerful than Uniswap, but is still less popular than uniswap.
00:12:12.062 - 00:12:35.802, Speaker A: So yeah, the simplicity of Uniswap is really, I think a huge advantage. So this is on the negative side. On the positive side, Kyber is one of the first decks. It's a very underrated protocol that really deserves to be higher in the Defi ranking. It's really a shame that we don't talk about them a lot. So their token KNC already increase of 25%. Yes.
00:12:35.802 - 00:13:13.982, Speaker A: So next balancer, which is a sort of more, how do you say that? A more powerful uniswap. They introduced a gas reimbursement program. It's quite original. I'd never heard about this before. So it's basically for four weeks, they will basically pay for your gas fee in order to incentivize liquidity. So yeah, it's quite cool. It's like one more creation of Defi one more way of giving incentives if it's successful.
00:13:13.982 - 00:13:59.730, Speaker A: Of course, every Defi protocol is going to do this for sure. Of course that means the balancer, very important detail. The balancer community has approved 30,000 bar token to be used to fund this gas reimbursement initiative. So that means there are going to be some selling pressure for the bow token in order to finance this. But on the other hand, it's also going to do more trading fee for balancers. So if the extra trading fee are more than the money that is spent to reimburse the gas, then it's going to be a win. Otherwise it's going to be a loss.
00:13:59.730 - 00:14:53.158, Speaker A: Then. Quick update on zero knowledge roll up. So this is one of the most promising technology for layer two scaling solution. And so stockware, which is a leading company for l two scaling solution, they are building what's called a composable ZK roll up, which mean that when you are using their technology, when you are on a side chain, you will be able to trade with another side chain. And so if we can do this, that means that there is no penalty really by being on a side chain. So it would be very useful in order to scale Ethereum. So let's keep monitoring the situation with a stockware, which is really one of the top leader for l two technology.
00:14:53.158 - 00:15:24.750, Speaker A: All right, so then I saw this on Twitter. An id for a DeFi project called the big squeeze, and I find it pretty cool. So people pull eth in a contract, you can pull funds at any time one x amount of ETH is deposited. All funds are used to market. Buy a token to short squeeze the token purchase. This way no one has to worry they are the last one to buy in the squeeze. So yes, it's basically a little bit like Wall street bets, but in a smart contract, so I don't think it's too difficult to do.
00:15:24.750 - 00:15:55.894, Speaker A: So if you're devs and you're looking for some id, you can check this out then. Hack. So this week there was a hack for sushi swap. There was 81 ether stolen. So it's not a very critical bug, and they already figure out how to fix it. And the sushiswap token was pretty much unaffected. But yeah, it's pretty surprising because at this point, sushiswap has been really like battle tested.
00:15:55.894 - 00:16:28.286, Speaker A: It's been months and months and we didn't think there would be a bug at this point, but still this happened. But fortunately it's small thing, it seems mostly contained. Okay, so next we're going to talk of NFT and Mark Cuban. So Makuban created his first NFT on rarible, which is rarible, one of the top marketplace for NFT. So Mark Cuban is the owner of a spot team in the US and he's a longtime supporter of crypto. He didn't talk much of ether before. It was mostly bitcoin.
00:16:28.286 - 00:16:55.446, Speaker A: But it's nice to see more and more interest for Ethereum from one of these big crypto gurus. So after this announcement, the rari governance tokens, that's the governance token of the Raribl marketplace. It gained 59% in 24 hours. So the NFT space is really like a sleeping giant for me. It's really going to grow so much this year. Exactly like DeFi. If 2020 was the year of DeFi, then 2021 is going to be the year of NFT.
00:16:55.446 - 00:17:25.282, Speaker A: So some people made so much money in crypto and they don't know how to invest their profits. So they would happily pay like hundreds of thousands of dollars for NFT. So you're going to see a lot of crazy purchase this year. So one buyer spent over $80,000 for two NFTs of Mark Cuban. And then he did something very surprising. He burned one of the two NFT he bought. So burning means destroying.
00:17:25.282 - 00:17:56.702, Speaker A: So to destroy an NFT, what you can do is you create an address. You don't save the private key, you send your NFT to the address and that's it. Nobody will be able to get this NFT. So it's really interesting because some people create, so you can create more scarcity by destroying your own asset. And you hope that the remaining NFT will be worth more than the sum of the two. So it's first time I hear about this strategy, like the burning strategy. Very interesting.
00:17:56.702 - 00:18:46.094, Speaker A: So this is the NFT in question here. Yes, this is Mark Cuban Eric doing his little dance. I am not sure I would have put 80,000 for that, but yeah, why not? Okay, so next, let's talk of investment. So DYDX raised $10 million from vcs, including a 16 z and polychain capital, which are two of the most famous vc in crypto. So DYDX is a Dex for advanced traders. They have a great user interface. They also have advanced features like margin trading and perpetuals, which are basically like feature but without an expiry date.
00:18:46.094 - 00:19:18.762, Speaker A: So their trading volume exploded last year. It went from 63 million in 2019 to 2.5 billion in 2020. And they are one of the few protocol that offer free flash loans technically you have to pay two way, but it's almost nothing. For all the other flash loan provider, you have to pay something like zero 1% or something like this, which can be a lot if you do some arbitrage. So it's a very underrated protocol. They have been at the bottom of the ranking on DFI pearls, but it's not going to last long.
00:19:18.762 - 00:19:50.194, Speaker A: They are really one of the first DeFi protocol. They have been battle tested already. Very solid code. And the founders were formerly engineers working at Coinbase. It's a really solid guy. So I quote the article, our goal is to become one of the largest crypto exchange period. To accomplish this, we are building a layer two system with stockware enabling cross margin perpetual, allowing for significant improvement to trading at scale.
00:19:50.194 - 00:20:24.554, Speaker A: Okay, so they are working on some layer two system and it's expected to come out in February. So unfortunately it seems like there is no token for DuidX. So I don't really know how to capitalize on this info, but in general I'm bullish on this project. Okay, so next investment from terraform. So they raised 25 million from Galaxy and Coinbase. So two very famous centralized exchange. So they are doing stable coins for ecommerce.
00:20:24.554 - 00:21:13.498, Speaker A: So it's also the company behind the chai payment app, which is an ecommerce wallet, very used in Asia and powered by stablecoins. Personally here in Taiwan, I've never heard of this chai payment app, but it seems like it's more famous in Korea, maybe. So they are not going to be on Ethereum, but they are on Cosmos. The project was launched in 2018 and one of the co founder is behind one of South Korea larger ecommerce sites. And already before this investment, they already had 32 million invested from finance and polychain. So yeah, I mean, now they really have a lot of money in the bank. So that's going to be useful.
00:21:13.498 - 00:21:58.960, Speaker A: And they already have 2 million user in Korea. So I quote the article, we look forward to using the funds for building key pieces on. Okay, so then that token is the Luna governance token. So it's minted and burned in order to enforce the peg for any terra stablecoin. So the governance token absorbs the volatility to defend its stablecoin utility. So it means like if the stablecoin moves a lot, potentially the terra stablecoin is going to lose value. So I like that they have the backing of good investors because.
00:21:58.960 - 00:22:33.050, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's really important. I also like that they have experience in e commerce and I like that they are really specialized in e commerce, but I don't like that they are on Cosmos and not Ethereum. I think it could be successful in their market. In Korea, it's like a little niche. I think they know this niche really well, but outside I'm not sure with Cosmos they really isolate themselves. So yeah, let's keep an eye on this project. But I'm not really convinced with the choice on Cosmos.
00:22:33.050 - 00:23:18.406, Speaker A: Okay. So after I saw this discussion on Reddit. So it's basically calling for a YC equivalent for crypto. So the problem in crypto is that you can raise money higher than $1 million, but if you're trying to raise 500,000 to 1 million, you pretty much have to create a token. Otherwise it's amount that can be a little bit too small for VC. So in order to fill this gap, it'd be really interesting to have an equivalent of a Y combinator. If you've never heard of Y Combinator, it's one of the most famous startup incubator in the US, especially for tech companies.
00:23:18.406 - 00:23:57.582, Speaker A: They've funded some of the most prestigious tech company, one of the most successful in the US, like Dropbox, I think they funded their Airbnb and many others. And over the years they've expanded the scope of what they do. And so usually they invest a few hundred thousand dollars in new projects. So it's like small size, but spread across many, many projects. And they invite you in Silicon Valley and you meet a lot of investors. So it's like super well respected and well known in the tech industry. If we could have some Y combinator, but for crypto.
00:23:57.582 - 00:24:33.114, Speaker A: So I know that YC in general is pretty interested in crypto. So maybe at some point they're going to have a batch just for crypto company. I don't know. Then we're going to talk of other blockchain, bitcoin. So Elon Musk added just bitcoin in his Twitter profile and it was enough to trigger another pump, but it didn't last, though. It went up like, I think plus 10% one day and almost in the same day it just fell back off. So, yeah, he just literally just added this in his bio on Twitter.
00:24:33.114 - 00:25:08.300, Speaker A: Like just super easy, just this little thing here. And that was enough for the big pump. Panthera is launching a new bitcoin fund. So Panthera is one of the biggest crypto fund. So I quote, we are really seeing an inflection point with more coming in the market. Over the last couple of months, we've had a ton of inbound calls from endowments and others that are trying to get exposure to the space. So potentially there is a big pump in bitcoin which is coming.
00:25:08.300 - 00:26:11.946, Speaker A: Interesting statistics about bitcoin. So there are more and more large bitcoin holders. So addresses with at least 1000 bitcoin now hold close to 30% of the total capacity. So this is more likely good for the long term stability of bitcoin supply because large institutions are typically long term investor who will hold their position for many, many years. The amount of bitcoin held for three years or longer has actually increased since mid 2020, which show that there is a growing number of truly long term holders. Also, interestingly, the total number of the onchain transfer value has grown in 2020, but not on exchanges. So that means that we see more and more trades that are being done outside of exchange in an OTC manner.
00:26:11.946 - 00:26:45.494, Speaker A: So that means peer to peer. Yeah. So that probably means that there are more and more institution who trade, because this institution, they don't just go to place their order on finance. They say, hey, we want to buy like for 50 million of something. No, they go through what's called OTC desk. So it's basically brokers that are specialized in doing this. Then we're going to talk of Dodge Coin that has really big pumps.
00:26:45.494 - 00:27:18.660, Speaker A: That was one of the biggest crypto rally of the year time ten. So it's another pump that was triggered by a tweet of Elon Musk and also by some redditors wanted to do the same thing as for GameStop. And so of course, if we talk of Dogecoin, we have to talk of some Dodge coin meme, because that's the best thing about. Yes, that one, the little dog who is going to rocket and. Okay, so that one is like one of the most famous meme, crypto meme on Twitter. Yeah. All right.
00:27:18.660 - 00:27:55.306, Speaker A: And of course we have to talk of the GameStop situation. So first of all, before we get into this, we need to talk about short selling. So what is short selling? So short selling that lie to bet that a stock is going to go down. So for this, you borrow, let's say you borrow the stock from someone at $100. You borrow the stock, then you sell it right away. So you have the money of the sale, then the stock goes down at, let's say $80. And now you have to reimburse the loan of the stock.
00:27:55.306 - 00:28:45.082, Speaker A: So you buy back the stock at 80 and you reimburse the stock. And so your profit is 100 -80 equal 20 so this is in the case when everything goes fine, but the problem is, if the stock doesn't go down, but instead goes up, now you have to buy, buy the stock at a higher price, like maybe 121,000, et cetera. And so in this case, you have a loss. But the big difference compared to being long on a stock is that with a short position, the extent of your loss is infinite, because if you just buy for $100 of a stock, at worst it can go to zero. At worst, you lose $100. However, when you do the other bets. So when you are short, the stock can increase infinitely.
00:28:45.082 - 00:29:25.962, Speaker A: So that means that if you are short on a stock which is $100, then the maximum you can lose is not $100, it's infinite because the stock can go to 200, 300, 400, et cetera. So it's very, very risky. So, hedge fund started to short a stock, which is called GameStop. So, GameStop, this is a brick and mortar shop that sells some video games. So, of course, at this time and age, it seems a little bit outdated. It's a little bit like a blockbuster in the US for movies. And so some traders of Wall street bet, which is a popular subreddit for traders, figure out that hedge funds have a massive short position for GameStop.
00:29:25.962 - 00:30:32.146, Speaker A: So they decided to buy a lot of GameStop stocks to do what's called a short squeeze. So, a short squeeze is when you have a lot of people who took a short position on a stock and they are getting closer to expiration, they need to reimburse the loan, but they don't find any stock on the market to buy. So then basically, they are forced to accept any price of the market because they have to reimburse the loan contractually. They have to do it. So whatever, it doesn't matter what's the price of the stock, they have to buy it. And so if you have this information, you know, a lot of people have this short position just before the expiry, then you have a lot of leverage over them. So, yeah, all this Redditor, they went on to buy a lot of Gamestock stocks, and the price went up like crazy, and hedge funds, at the end, started to lose more and more money, and they had to close their bet.
00:30:32.146 - 00:31:17.374, Speaker A: And so some of these hedge funds, like Melvin Capital, lost more than 50% of their value. It's just absolutely insane. So brokers like Robin Hoop, so these are the company that allow retail investors to invest. They received some calls from all these hedge funds, and to help them, they didn't accept buy orders anymore for Gamestop, and they even forced some customers to sell. So of course, there was a big scandal. It's really the story of the rich against the poor. Actually, Robin Hood, the broker that got unfamous for refrigerating the buy orders, he couldn't have a worse name.
00:31:17.374 - 00:31:45.770, Speaker A: I MEAN, they took from the poor to give it to the rich. It's exactly the contrary. So, of course, the media love this story and they talk about it a lot. And the subreddit Wall street bets grew like crazy after this event. They added, like several millions new members. So there will probably be a spill of effect on crypto. These people, I mean, all these people of Wall street bets that got really angry, they're really primed for crypto, really, because they saw what happened with centralized finance.
00:31:45.770 - 00:32:22.174, Speaker A: Even if you win, you can still lose. So with Uniswap and all the other dexs, they can never really block you from trading like Robinhood did. So I think it's really a great justification for crypto. And we're going to see some of these new Wall street bet people coming to crypto, that is for sure. Okay, so next, quickly, let's talk of regulation. So India is against crypto. So India plans to introduce a law to ban private cryptocurrency such as bitcoin.
00:32:22.174 - 00:33:03.794, Speaker A: Okay, so first of all, there is an error in the article because bitcoin is not a private cryptocurrency. But anyway, that ban private currencies such as bitcoin in the country and provide a framework for the creation of an officially digital currency during the current budget session. Okay, so basically they're doing to do their own crypto and they don't want any competition. So it's not the first time that India is really against crypto. In 2018, there was an indian government panel that recommended banning all private cryptocurrencies and proposed up to ten year of jail time for offenders. Wow. I think they are some of the most mental about this.
00:33:03.794 - 00:33:37.822, Speaker A: Seriously? Like jail time for offenders. Oh, my God. They've been against crypto beforece. It's not surprising that they say this, but you noticed the article just said they plan to introduce the ban on bitcoin, but it's not the first time that they plan it. So I think they're going to receive a lot of pushback. It might just be some politics that make, like, some crazy announcement, but I'm not sure they're going to do it in the end because it's going to be very difficult to enforce the ban, really. Okay.
00:33:37.822 - 00:34:10.114, Speaker A: So after news for developers. So the DefcoN in Bogota this year was delayed. So DeFCOn is the biggest annual conference for Ethereum. Last year it was canceled and people hope we could do it in 2021. But yeah, with the COVID situation it's still not sure, unfortunately, but it's not going to prevent Ethereum from making big progress. Last year we were able to roll out Ethereum 2.0 even, no matter that it didn't matter that there wasn't any conference.
00:34:10.114 - 00:35:04.854, Speaker A: So it's more like the icing on top of the case to have Defcon, but Defcon on not Defcon. As long as we have Twitter, it's fine. Then there's a new version of three t 0.8.1, no major new feature, but just some internal stuff. Then solidity developer survey was just released, so let's see what we can so the big majority of respondents were in the US. So yeah, basically the physical location where we have the most blockchain dev is on the west coast, in Silicon Valley of course. But crypto is very decentralized.
00:35:04.854 - 00:35:46.198, Speaker A: So we have a little bit of crypto everywhere, 8% in India, Germany, it's very distributed. Then 82% of the respondents stated that they are currently employed. So yeah, I mean really, it's really easy to find a job in crypto. 4% identify as students, 14% stated to not work at the moment. So 14% of unemployed people, probably between two job or probably learning. How many years have you coded professionally as part of your work in any language? So this is very interesting. The majority is between six to ten years.
00:35:46.198 - 00:36:14.110, Speaker A: So this is quite different from other niche like Javascript for example. You will have much more junior developer. So yeah, you have a big chunk of developer who come to blockchain who are already quite experienced. But if you are a newbie, don't be scared. You can also start with blockchain. This is fine, totally fine. Then the following applied to me.
00:36:14.110 - 00:36:42.786, Speaker A: So I use solidity outside of work for my personal project. Yeah, of course the blockchain devs, usually they are passionate. They don't just do solidity at work because they have to do it, they also enjoy doing it as well. I use solidity at work, 70% I code at work. Another programming language. Yeah. So you have a lot of smart contract programmer who also do a little bit of front end.
00:36:42.786 - 00:37:15.186, Speaker A: So they are really what we call full stack blockchain developer. In bigger company you can have some specialized smart contract developer that do only solidity, but it's not the majority and almost 30%. I manage a programming team. Okay. I contribute to open source project written in solidity infrequently. Never yes, a minority who does it sometimes. So open source is amazing, but if you are a newbie, it might be a little bit difficult.
00:37:15.186 - 00:37:50.302, Speaker A: Open source is good once you start to have two, three years of experience and you can be really helpful for a project. But the thing is, if you're a total newbie, you try to contribute for an open source project. Actually, people don't really want to hold your hand and show you the ropes and stuff. It can be a bit boring for them. So yeah, better to work on your own project first and only after you start to be an open source. Some other learning from this survey. Okay.
00:37:50.302 - 00:38:29.098, Speaker A: Solidity developer experience most respondent believe that the solidity developer experience had some or much improvement over the last year. So yeah, now the state of the dev tooling is much better. I remember when I first got in blockchain in 2017, it was totally different. Totally different. Solidity challenges the biggest challenge in developer experience is the availability and quality of tooling, also seen as critical aspect id integration and better documentation. Oh yeah, error handling. Error handling in solidity is not easy.
00:38:29.098 - 00:39:09.634, Speaker A: Most like dreaded and anticipated. Yeah, error handling and debugging. Debugging is notoriously difficult in solidity, unfortunately. Okay, that's it. Now we're going to do the Q and a section, so I'm going to just quickly post again the link to my free training if you want to learn how you can become a blockchain developer. All right, so let's scroll up and see all the questions. So, hi, explorer de Cohen, C mento.
00:39:09.634 - 00:39:25.526, Speaker A: Please make a review about Alpha Omera V two launch today versus Yun finance. All right, yeah, I saw this project. I didn't have enough time to prepare it. Maybe next time or maybe later this week. Jake breeding. Greetings. Thanks for the info.
00:39:25.526 - 00:39:46.078, Speaker A: Have you gotten into DCN decentraland yen yet? Go claim eat the block's name before someone eats it up. Yeah. No, yeah, several people told me about Decentraland. Yeah. Okay. I didn't know we can buy some names on decentral. Thx.
00:39:46.078 - 00:40:03.030, Speaker A: Hi ThX. Easyfi. Jake breeding easyfi moving up slowly but nicely. They are like compound on matic network. Interesting. So now you have some defi protocol that stopped on sidechain. Okay, well, this is really a new trend.
00:40:03.030 - 00:40:32.980, Speaker A: Very interesting. Skins para Sgsgo saying hey mate, do you know anything about the cake token from pancake swap? I just know that they took 100% the last week but that's it. So it seems like the biggest. Yeah. On binance smart chain, pancake swap is really in the top. You also have Venus. Venus is exploding at the moment.
00:40:32.980 - 00:41:00.954, Speaker A: I don't know if Venus is like a lending protocol or a Dex. I need to do more research on binance smart chain, to be honest. Quickswap needs some love the union matic, dirt cheap, fast transaction, little bit of a ghost tone right now. Okay, interesting. Yeah. I mean, if you're really willing to take some risk, you can buy some token on protocol that don't have people yet. And when you explode, you make a lot.
00:41:00.954 - 00:41:45.980, Speaker A: But yeah, it's also risky. But I've heard some stuff from quickswap from several people. Jake breeding, how do you approve? You don't have private key when you send to burn. Is there a new address on ethereum that you can send to burn token? It's a good question. It's a good question. I don't know, how could you do this? Let me think. Maybe there is a better way, I think, or what you can do is you deploy a smart contract that have nothing.
00:41:45.980 - 00:42:19.814, Speaker A: Basically you can have an empty smart contract. You just do like contract my contract, curly braces and nothing inside. Then you deploy this smart contract, then you send a token to this smart contract. And since there is no function to restore the token, that means the token is locked forever. And so since smart contract don't have any private key, in that case you can prove that the token is really locked. So, yeah, that would be one way to do it. Vinnie Pexoto, how do you see the boost and feasibility of staking pools with Ethereum 2.0
00:42:19.814 - 00:43:25.962, Speaker A: and proof of stake? The boost and feasibility. I don't know what you mean exactly, but yeah, for sure, staking pool is going to help a lot to stake eth two. So if you're interested in building your own staking pool, I actually have a tutorial on my channel. Which criteria should be considered when choosing the best one to stake? If, if they give you, if they allow you to, if they allow to redeem your eth before east two is completely released, that would be, I mean, I don't know how they could do this, actually, but I think that binance, what they do, they don't allow you to redeem your eth before, but they give you interest before. So this is, for example, interesting. But the problem with staking pool is that there is a centralized part, so you really have to trust the team. So, yeah, I mean, I would only invest in staking pool that already did a project before.
00:43:25.962 - 00:44:19.354, Speaker A: If it's like a new team, it's a bit difficult to really trust them with this because it's really. No, no. How Jake breeding saying, how shady are hedge funds betting on businesses to fail? Yeah, I mean, this is part of the big uproar. Now it start to be seen as not ethical to do some short selling. So you have a couple of financial institutions that said that they will not offer short selling capability anymore. So maybe that this event is going to be a big blow to short selling. Who knows then 2017 vet, I love your name.
00:44:19.354 - 00:44:50.254, Speaker A: You have to be on both side, buyers and sellers to make a market. So there is nothing wrong with betting against a company. We just want it to be fair. I mean, you can still bet against a company by bidding lower than the market price. Like if the market price is there, then you say, okay, well, you know what, I think the fair price is there. So you're still indicating to the market that you think the price should be lower, but it's a little bit less violent than short selling. But yeah, I mean, this is an interesting debate.
00:44:50.254 - 00:45:47.606, Speaker A: I think Jake breeding, well, when you have an institution and low on your site to block buying, then yeah, it's shady as fuck. Yeah, that's a really long debate, Sam. Hey Julian, what do you think of Myro Protocol? Did you know you can claim free Mir token if you held uni? I don't know Myro protocol. I think this is on Cosmos, right? I didn't follow much cosmos stuff, but now I start to follow a little bit more blockchains because before I was like 100% ethereum and now it seems we start to have more and more action on other blockchains. So yeah, it's a lot of stuff to study really. Jake breeding Jill Kami makong tobo. Do you have any telegram group to join? There is a discord group, but this is a private discord group only for the people who take one of my course.
00:45:47.606 - 00:46:33.958, Speaker A: Otherwise there is also a free Facebook group for anybody. So you'll find the link in the banner of my channel. But typically the Facebook group is a little bit, there is less volume on it and it's slightly less volume and usually I spend more time in the discord group. Thx. Why do countries have to ban cryptocurrency? Yeah, because they want to keep power and they see it as a competition with the national currency. But I think it's going to be super hard to enforce. To me really seems like really uninformed politicians who are just doing some gesticulation, but I'm not too afraid of that.
00:46:33.958 - 00:46:52.422, Speaker A: Yeah, not too afraid. Turkey. Nick McConnell. Do you know Grayscale has private placement for Ethereum trust? What is your opinion? No, I wasn't aware of that. That's good. Yeah. We want to see some of this institutional money flowing to eth.
00:46:52.422 - 00:47:11.006, Speaker A: Yeah. So we can go to ten k. This is the goal, guy. Ten k. The goal. Geo Cami, do you train people to become blockchain developer? Yes, I have a course special for that. So register for the link I posted above the bootcamp.
00:47:11.006 - 00:47:29.010, Speaker A: This is a free training. It's going to show you how you can become a blockchain developer. And at the end you'll have a link to follow my professional training. Okay. 2017 vet Myra is awesome. You can buy stock equivalents. I just bought silver.
00:47:29.010 - 00:47:42.954, Speaker A: Oh, cool. Oh yeah. So silver, this is the new crazy thing from Wall street bets. Super cool. Gary Sente. Yo, Julian, what's your prediction for the brow one? Which Alcoins? Oh, wow. Really difficult question.
00:47:42.954 - 00:48:23.910, Speaker A: I mean, it really depends on your risk appetite. But I would say probably the alcoin with the most potential, I would say would be a DeFi project on other blockchain and ethereum. That may be binance, smart chain, Cosmos, polkadot, et cetera. But this is also more risky. Then a little bit less risky you have ethereum and then a little bit less risky you have bitcoin or ether. And other than that you can also buy the crypto of some Ethereum competitors. So I think, yeah, Cardano.
00:48:23.910 - 00:48:45.280, Speaker A: I don't think the Cardano tech will overcome Ethereum, but I think the token still have some appreciation left. Dot Polkadot. I'm pretty bullish on that. Yeah. And a couple of Ethereum killer. I think during this bull run that token is going to appreciate as well basically everything. Basically.
00:48:45.280 - 00:49:14.454, Speaker A: I think in this bull run it's really difficult to do a mistake. It's kind of a big trap. Like now everybody feels they are so smart because we are all winning, but we also have to take some profit. Okay. Because the thing is, when the bull run is going to be over, unfortunately, you're not going to have like a nice announcement and say, ladies and gentlemen, this is the end of the bull run. Please do your selling before tomorrow. 09:00 a.m.
00:49:14.454 - 00:49:41.694, Speaker A: It's not going to be like this. So if you don't want to be surprised, you have to do some profit taking so that rapidly, during this bull run at least you withdraw in profit the money you invested so at least you are hedged. Okay? And I think that's the big mistake of most people. Everyone is like, no, man, I just stay. I huddle until the end. They never do any profit taking. And then when it's the end of the bull market, then shit hits the fan.
00:49:41.694 - 00:50:17.840, Speaker A: Yeah. So you got to be careful about this, okay? Do you need experience being a developer to take your course? No. So if you take six figure blockchain development, there is a package, the jump starter package, where you have an extra training on web development. So you can be a total newbie and you can get upstube speed. First you learn web dev. So Javascript, HTML, CSS. And after, once you follow this extra training, then you start with the actual course.
00:50:17.840 - 00:50:40.638, Speaker A: Batman. Hey, what's up, Batman? Turkey? Nick McConnell. What is KevM and how it will work? So EVM is Ethereum virtual machine. Kevm. It's probably the EVM which is adapted to another blockchain. Cardano. Smart contract.
00:50:40.638 - 00:51:03.674, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, so Kano doesn't use the technology of bad. Yeah, my bad. My bad. All right. Okay, guys, so I think this is pretty much it today. So thanks, guys, for joining, and I will see you later this week on my channel.
00:51:03.674 - 00:51:06.070, Speaker A: Have a great day. Bye, everyone. Bye.
