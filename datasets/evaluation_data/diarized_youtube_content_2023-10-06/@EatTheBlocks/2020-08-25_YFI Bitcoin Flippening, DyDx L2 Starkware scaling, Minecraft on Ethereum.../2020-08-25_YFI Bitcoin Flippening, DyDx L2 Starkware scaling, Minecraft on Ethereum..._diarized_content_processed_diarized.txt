00:00:09.670 - 00:00:58.890, Speaker A: And we are live welcome for this weekly live stream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum. Nd five for those who don't know me, I'm Julian and you are on edoblox. And on this channel I teach blockchain development and how to find your first blockchain job. So as usual, first I will talk by myself and we'll do the q and a at the end. So before we continue, I want to do a quick mention to my two courses. First, if you want to become a blockchain developer and make year like I used to do, you can check out my course, six figure blockchain developer. And if you want to learn how to do flash loan arbitrage, check out my other course on flash loan.
00:00:58.890 - 00:01:41.954, Speaker A: So first we will start with the prices of ether. So during the past week it went down a little bit, we went up to 440 and then, so we have this support at 400 and we went below the support and now we went back just at the support. So I mean we had a lot of increase for the past few weeks. So I think this is kind of expected that it slowed down a little bit. But long term, I'm still very bullish on ether because of ether 2.0 staking that's going to create a buying pressure on ether. And also ether is the default currency of Defi.
00:01:41.954 - 00:02:18.706, Speaker A: So you have many defi investors that take their profit in ether. So that's another natural buying pressure for ether. So next we going to see the transaction fee for Ethereum. So we can see that we are still very high, but it start to go down a little bit. So a slight improvement, but this is still not great. So actually there was a proposal to reduce the minor reward by 75%. EIP 28 78.
00:02:18.706 - 00:02:57.322, Speaker A: And of course miners are not super thrilled by this proposal. So certainly that it's going to be rejected. So of course this proposal would have improved the situation for the transaction fee, but that's maybe a little bit too tough for miners. So there is another proposal, EIP 1559, which will change the calculation the reward of minor that will probably be adopted. So I think it's a bit tough to have EIP 1559 and also this other EIP passed at the same time. I in the chat I see some message. Hi crypto Balrog.
00:02:57.322 - 00:03:35.690, Speaker A: Hi Edgar. So another solution to reduce the transaction fee on Ethereum is that more DeFi protocol. Migrate to layer two and I will talk more about this later in this video. So that's it for the situation of Ethereum in general. So now we're going to focus a little bit more on DFI. So first, the market cap of DFI, it increased just by 300 million compared to one week ago. So we are slowing down the rate of increase.
00:03:35.690 - 00:04:13.160, Speaker A: Before, we used to increase by 1 billion a week. I think that's okay. I mean, we can go to the moon every week, it's not a disaster. And then in terms of market cap, so maker is still number one, Ave is still number two, not much change curve number three, compound. And we still have uniswap in nine position. But actually in terms of volume of decentralized exchange, uniswap is number. And I didn't know that yarn finance increased so much.
00:04:13.160 - 00:04:47.570, Speaker A: Yeah, you can see the two project of Andre Curve finance and yarn finance at three and fifth position. So yeah, I mean, this guy is really a superstar in the Defi world. Like everything he does gets super successful. All right, next we're going to see the situation for DeFi token. So a lot of positive here, a lot of green. I like this. So yeah, I mean, all the usual governance token, they're all going up synthetix Ave curve.
00:04:47.570 - 00:05:28.154, Speaker A: So that's super positive. And of course, the big news for the big increase of the week, that's Wi Fi. So the governance protocol of yern finance. So now we say that this is the flippening because it's above the price of bitcoin. So here it's pretty amazing for the people who did some yield farming at the beginning, like the kind of return you can get on that is pretty insane. So next we're going to see quickly the situation on rates. So the rates are a bit down for Dai, the highest is still on DYDX.
00:05:28.154 - 00:05:53.286, Speaker A: So that's like last week. And USDC actually give pretty good yield at almost 7%. It's pretty sweet. And bat gives you 15% on Ave. Wow, it's pretty good rate. All right, so that's it for the situation of DeFi prices. So now we're going to do the DeFi news.
00:05:53.286 - 00:06:43.350, Speaker A: So news about specific project. So as I was mentioning before, one of the solution to solve the problem of high transaction on Ethereum is that some DeFi protocol migrate to some layer two solution. So basically layer two solution allow you to do blockchain transactions, but outside of the transaction, outside of the blockchain. So it's not as safe as layer one, which is the Ethereum blockchain itself, but it's much cheaper. So stockware is one of the project that is working on layer two solution. And I think that's actually one of the most advanced project on that. So DyDX, the famous decentralized exchange, announced they're going to partner with stockware.
00:06:43.350 - 00:07:25.154, Speaker A: So let's see what going to be the benefits for the traders. So of course significantly reduced gas and trading fees. So I think the way it's going to work is you're going to need probably to do one transaction at the beginning. So a normal ethereum transaction that cost a lot of money. And then once you've done your transaction, the next transaction on this layer two chain will be very cheap. And when you want to exit this, then again you need to do an expensive transaction. Also you can do trade size that are lower because your transaction fee now, since they are lower, then it makes sense to just trade for 100 or $200.
00:07:25.154 - 00:07:54.058, Speaker A: Currently it doesn't really make sense to do small trades because your transaction fee is going to be so high. Like if you want to trade, I don't know, $100 and your transaction fee is $50. This is crazy. You're never going to make a profitable trade like this. You're also going to be able to get more trading pair. You're also going to be able to have instant trade settlement. So that's very important because currently every time you do a trade, need to wait at least 15 seconds for your transaction to be mined on the blockchain.
00:07:54.058 - 00:08:16.594, Speaker A: But market condition can change very quickly. So that's a big issue for trader. So instant trade settlement, this is really awesome. And yeah, so these are the really big benefits for Trader. I think they plan to release this at the end of the year. So we're going to need to wait a bit for that. But yeah, it's exactly what I was expecting.
00:08:16.594 - 00:09:04.930, Speaker A: Now we see all these DeFi project trying to develop solution on layer two. So this is going to be a temporary solution before Ethereum 2.0 is rollout. Oh, by the way, there is one disadvantage to layer two solution is that we lose interoperability. So if you are on DyDX on a layer two and then you want to take your funds from DyDX to another protocol, first you need to exit this layer two with normal Ethereum transaction and after you need to do another Ethereum transaction to send to another DeFi protocol. So it's not only advantages, it also has disadvantages, unfortunately. But this is probably just a temporary solution.
00:09:04.930 - 00:10:17.686, Speaker A: All right, so next news is Andre Conge, the creator of Un finance and curve finance announced that he's working on a new project y interfinance, which is a new insurance project for DeFi. So this is still very early. This is just a draft. He just briefly said that they're going to be three component insurer vault, insurer vault and claim governance. So the idea is that if you're an insurer, you send your token, for example, your USD C, to one vault, and if you want to be insured, then you're going to be insured by using the liquidity that was provided by the insurer. I think insurer are not obliged to reimburse you if they estimate that your claim is not valid, but if they do so, you have a way to punish them by withdrawing your fund from the vault. And so it will make the operation unprofitable for the insurer.
00:10:17.686 - 00:10:49.906, Speaker A: So there isn't really too much detail. This is still a very early draft, so I would just say wait and see. But in general, everything that is done by Andre is very high quality. So I mean, I think this is really exciting. This is not the first project for insurance in DeFi. There is already open that I explained in a previous video here on my channel. But the problem of open is that they got hacked really early, like a couple of weeks ago they launched and almost right away they got hacked.
00:10:49.906 - 00:11:31.806, Speaker A: So of course they excuse themselves, they said they're going to fix the bugs, et cetera, but that's never too good for the trust of the protocol. So that's why I'm super bullish about this project. None of the project of Andre has been hacked at the moment and he has so much liquidity on curve finance and yarn finance. So I think it's going to be easy for him to attract a lot of liquidity to this new project. So super excited, but we need to wait and see to have more detail on that then. Next news. So tether is moving 1 billion USDT from Tron to Ethereum.
00:11:31.806 - 00:12:10.394, Speaker A: So that's about 8% of the total supply. So that's super bullish for Ethereum and D five project. There's going to be some extra liquidity that we're going to see in defi that also show you that Ethereum is the dominant blockchain. And all the copycat of Ethereum, like Tron, are really doomed to fail. Like they don't provide anything new, they just copy past. So yeah, I mean, they can temporarily steal some value because their transaction fee are lower, but in the end the money comes back to Ethereum. So it's good news for all of us who are focused on Ethereum.
00:12:10.394 - 00:12:40.362, Speaker A: And this is one more proof that you shouldn't waste too much time with other blockchain. Really. There is a rumor that apparently the exchange that is behind this is Binance. And then next news. Talking of Binance, Binance announced that they're going to launch a new feature. So a new DFI saving product. So it's one more centralized exchange with trying to get into DFI by adding a UI for DFI project.
00:12:40.362 - 00:13:18.338, Speaker A: So you can get up to about 15% apy by saving some return on investment on your stable coin. So they have three stable coin where they offer this buy USD, that's finance, USD, then tether and USDC. So that's pretty sweet. If you're a user of Binance now, you can make some money off your stable coin. It's pretty sweet, it's pretty positive for DeFi. Next I find this article on the blog of Coinbase. That's basically a bunch of advice if you want to list your s 20 token on Coinbase.
00:13:18.338 - 00:14:07.202, Speaker A: So why this is very important because when you list your token on Coinbase, usually the value of the token goes up like crazy because all of a sudden you have all this liquidity. So like this is a huge buying pressure. So if you are thinking of launching your DFI or your blockchain project and you have an s 20 token, that might be a good idea to know to keep this guideline in mind. So of course verified source code. So that's easy. They mentioned audit somewhere, external audit, thorough documentation, et cetera, et cetera. So it might seems like obvious, but it's good to go through all this list and make sure you have all the chance to be listed.
00:14:07.202 - 00:15:15.338, Speaker A: So next I want to show you this project called DeFi safety. So that's a project that show you the sort of evaluation of the safety of different DeFi protocol according to different criteria, among which is do we have an audit or not? So of course for protocol that were hacked like BZX, or do we have other one that opinion I think was hacked also? Yeah, yam was at the bug. So of course this one I read aave seems pretty mean. Of course you need to do more research than this, but this can give you some sort of, in the early indication of whether something is safe or not. By the way, this is an example of project that you could build yourself. Like nice little project that can be very useful to the community. It's easy to do, and if you are the creator, it's also a great way to showcase your skill and to gain some visibility in DeFi and blockchain talking of little cool project you can do yourself.
00:15:15.338 - 00:16:06.442, Speaker A: So here is another project called USD on Ethereum. So that's a dashboard that show you the different USD market cap of the different asset on ethereum. So for ethereum this is 11 billion then, of which we have 8 billion of tether, 1 billion something of USDC, et cetera, et cetera. So they said that soon they're going to show some historical data. So that's also typically a kind of project that you can do yourself as a developer. You deploy this either on a digitalocean or even more simple, on what's, oh, I forgot the name of this project I use all the time. Like what's this thing where.
00:16:06.442 - 00:16:37.990, Speaker A: Oh, Heroku. Yeah, Heroku, yeah. So an example of simple project you can do. So next, I want to show you this thread on Twitter. So these are seven indicators that you can use to evaluate a defi project. And for each indicator it tells you if this is positive or negative, and also it tells you where you can find the indicator. Hi to the new people in the chat, Parker, face and Lucas.
00:16:37.990 - 00:17:16.260, Speaker A: I will answer to all the questions in the chat at the end, guys. So here, first indicator, total value locked over fully diluted market cap. So usually for token, we don't have all the token that are in circulation. Some of them are locked. So the more we have in circulation the better. Because if that's not the case, then the token that are locked, if they are unlocked and they're released on the market all of a sudden, then it can have a huge impact on the market. For example, if this is a governance protocol, then they can outvote the other people.
00:17:16.260 - 00:18:09.070, Speaker A: So that's something that is very important. And you can find this indication on defi pulse or coingecko, then, I mean, I'm not going to do the seven because we need to spend too much time on each of them. But here you have price market cap on revenue, a percent of token supply on exchanges, user growth, unique address growth. So yeah, this, we can find it on a dune analytics, a couple of dashboards, and then non speculative usage. So that one, I don't think this indicator really exists, liquid inflation rate. So this one, I'm not sure to understand it, but they say not, rule of thumb, none of them. But we can find it on Mesari.
00:18:09.070 - 00:18:49.994, Speaker A: Interesting. All right, well anyway, if you are interested in evaluating Defi project, like check out this thread. These are some really good guidelines. So next, I wanted to show you this new game eth verse. So that's basically how could I describe this? Maybe you guys have heard of Decentraland? So Decentraland is one of the most famous game on Ethereum. That's basically a virtual world where you can own some different assets on Ethereum. And so Ethereum is a little bit like Decentraland, but it's built on top of Minecraft.
00:18:49.994 - 00:19:58.446, Speaker A: So I think this is very spot because they didn't waste the time to rebuild all the technology of the game, all the graphics, they already leveraged everything that was done on Minecraft. And what they did that instead of just having the asset being stored in centralized server, they connected this on the Ethereum blockchain. So for players, this is much safer, because if Ethverse decides to stop the game at some point, then your assets are still on the blockchain and anybody in the community can decide to run their own version of Etherse and do a fork. So basically that's a guarantee that anything you own in Ethverse will be really sustainable and long term and nobody can take it away from you. Yeah, I think it's pretty cool. The graphics seems, the image super nice, it seems super high quality. So yeah, I mean, if you like games and you like things like Decentraland, the interest in starting in a game like this from the beginning is that usually everything is really cheap.
00:19:58.446 - 00:20:43.218, Speaker A: Like if you want to buy some land or buy some object, that's going to be super cheap. And so what some people do is that they buy a lot of it and then just wait like six months when the game become popular, and then they just resell everything and make a huge profit. It's kind of interesting. Okay, so next I want to talk about how you can get help for your blockchain or defi project. So this is the blog of the Ethereum foundation. And so the Ethereum foundation has a program of grants, so they can give you money if you do a project that benefits the community in general. But they cannot give grant to all the applications because they receive way too many.
00:20:43.218 - 00:21:16.030, Speaker A: So in some cases they might say, okay, well, we can give you money, but we can still provide you some sort of support. And they give some examples. So for example, there's this guy on Twitter who is pretty active defi dude. He had this idea of creating an archive node. So basically he want to run an Ethereum node in archive mode. That means you can query the state of Ethereum even in the past. So that's very useful if you want to, for example, show some events.
00:21:16.030 - 00:22:04.480, Speaker A: If you want to do it with Inferra, you cannot use the free version of Infura, you need to use a paid version of Inferra, and that can be expensive. So what they did, these guys, they created an archive node that they run on AWS, and the Ethereum foundation didn't give them money, but they gave them AWS credit so that it doesn't cost. This guy run this Ethereum node for other project like save dice. This is a hackathon project. They connected this guy to a smart contract auditor who did the audit of their code for free. So they saved a lot of money. Normally a smart contract audit, it can easily take you to like ten k or even more.
00:22:04.480 - 00:22:42.138, Speaker A: So if you want some help for your blockchain and defi project, think also of the Ethereum foundation and they can help you beyond just grant. So that's really good to know. So next news. So now we're going to switch to the news for developers. So metamask is changing their license. So Metamask is an open source project, so they need some funding. So the current license is MIT, which is very permissive, that allow anybody to do everything they want.
00:22:42.138 - 00:23:39.574, Speaker A: Metamask has served 4 million users, so it's an extremely popular wallet for Ethereum. That's the most popular by far. So in the future, if your DAP has less than 10,000 monthly active users, no change, you can keep using metamask, but if you start to have more than 10,000 monthly active users, you will need to enter a commercial license with metamask. So they don't give detail, but that probably mean that you will have to pay a monthly fee based on usage. I saw some angry people on Twitter, but really that's not really fair. They have provided a lot of value to the Ethereum community, so it's normal that at some point they start to charge people for the anecdote. I think the founder of Ave suggested that instead they could use some tokenomics in order to find some funding.
00:23:39.574 - 00:24:33.674, Speaker A: So with a system of tokens they could get some remuneration. We'll see which model they adopt in the end. But if you're just getting started for your blockchain project, you shouldn't be impacted because it's only above 10,000 monthly active users. So next I want to mention a tool that is super convenient for blockchain developers, so that allow you to do some smart contract monitoring. So I want to show you the different screen that you have. So let's say you have a decentralized application and you want to see all the transaction that went through your smart contract. So you can create an account and they'll show you a dashboard where you will see the list of all the transaction with the status showing you if that was a success or not, the network, the date, et cetera.
00:24:33.674 - 00:25:12.342, Speaker A: You can also filter transaction according to different criteria, and you can also do some debugging, gas profiling. So for example, if you want to do some optimization for gas, that's very useful to know how your user use your smart contract and which function costs the most gas. So you can use this to have an id. Also, if you have a lot of failed transaction, you can use their debugger. So I've actually already used their debugger, and that's really super good. It shows you in a very clear way the sequence of all the function calls. So this smart contract called this one, this one called this one, et cetera.
00:25:12.342 - 00:25:43.054, Speaker A: And up to the point where you have the failure, you also see in which line of solidity code it corresponds. So that's a very valuable tool. You can use it for free. So, yeah, I mean, you guys definitely check this out. All right, so now for the Q A section. So I'm going to go over all the section first. Cryptobarrock asked me, hey man, have you been able to make some profit using furukombo? No, I haven't.
00:25:43.054 - 00:26:33.042, Speaker A: So I think Furukombo is an amazing tool, but it's a tool to understand the logic of flashloan, to experiment. But realistically, it's going to be very difficult if you just keep refreshing the price of different exchanges manually and try to scramble to do it quick to do your arbitrage in furukombo. So you probably need to have a system with a script that monitors automatically prices. So if you want to do some arbitrage, or if you want to do some liquidation, you need to have some script that monitor this on server. And when your script detects an opportunity automatically, it send a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain to do your liquidation or your arbitrage. That's actually what we do in my course on unprofitable flash. No.
00:26:33.042 - 00:27:04.400, Speaker A: Do you have cheapay high transaction fee if flash loan transaction fails? Yeah, I mean, that's exactly the same. If your transactions fail or it succeed, you still have to pay the miner for running your transactions. So yeah, that's an issue. Like if your flash loan transaction fail, you actually can lose like 30, 40, $50. So currently the gas prices are pretty high. So that's annoying. In the future, if it comes back to $510.
00:27:04.400 - 00:27:20.418, Speaker A: That might be a little bit more acceptable, but yes, this is definitively a problem. But normally, if your script works well and you send a transaction fast enough, then flashlight should work. Lucas. Hi. From Sweden. Hey, mega, Montana. Hey, guys.
00:27:20.418 - 00:27:41.340, Speaker A: Oh, we have someone. We have a chinese guest who writes in Chinese. Okay, so I can read Chinese a little bit. Let me see if I can translate. You say it's all in English. The Chinese can understand. Yeah, I mean, dude, yeah, we all speak English, man.
00:27:41.340 - 00:27:59.082, Speaker A: Then Barry says, sold a lot of land in decentralized for the same price as real property. Really, man? Wow. I hope you meant a lot of money. Like, sounds really exciting. Hi, shree. Hi, Julian. I've developed full decentralized tic tactical game in Ethereum.
00:27:59.082 - 00:28:23.522, Speaker A: I would love to collaborate with you. I don't really know what you mean, but you can send me an email at Julian with an E. Julian@idablocks.com. Okay, we still have some Chinese. Let me see if I can translate this. This is in simplified Chinese. So I'm here in Taiwan where we use traditional Chinese.
00:28:23.522 - 00:28:39.610, Speaker A: So this is a different kind of Chinese. I'm not sure I can get. Oh, I think he keeps saying, oh, this is all in English. This is all in English. Yeah, man. I'm not in China for sure. This is in English.
00:28:39.610 - 00:29:18.280, Speaker A: What's the best mobile app for Defi? I think you mean the best mobile wallet. I mean, I'm not sure if there is one best, but I know that the Azure wallet is very popular because it has some built in integration with different DeFi protocol. So that's pretty cool. I know on Dharma is not a popular one. And I think they actually pay for some of your transaction cost. I don't know how they can finance it. Maybe they aggregate all the transaction at one time in the day.
00:29:18.280 - 00:29:59.270, Speaker A: Yeah, so I heard about this about Dharma. So you can check it out then. What is the best layer two solution, in your opinion? Mostly focus on faster transaction and cheaper one. Okay, so I haven't looked too much at layer two solution, but I believe that stockware, the one I mentioned before, I think they are quite advanced. And the fact that DyDx decided to partner with them, this is very bullish because DyDX, this is done by guys who are really solid. They've done a very advanced protocol that is very successful. So I trust these guys.
00:29:59.270 - 00:30:42.626, Speaker A: And if they chose stockware, they've probably done their research. So, yeah, I would say stockware is probably a solid one. I'm buying the course of flash loan. Is it easy to swap on other Dexes other than uniswap and Kyber. Yeah, I mean, actually, I have a bonus on the course that show you how you can do it with other assets. I don't show how to do it on other Dexes decentralized exchanges, but, yeah, the logic is very similar. The logic is with your script, you have to detect a difference in price, and then in a smart contract, you buy on one exchange, you sell on the other.
00:30:42.626 - 00:31:13.470, Speaker A: So once you know how to do the full process for two exchanges, it's not too difficult to change this to other. No, my friend, I considering whether to unsubscribe from your channel, but I don't understand. Okay, I think this is the chinese dude. Yeah, man. I don't really know what to tell you. I'm not in China, so I don't speak Chinese. But yeah, I mean, learn some English and come back, buddy.
00:31:13.470 - 00:31:27.090, Speaker A: Crypto. Thanks for the response. Keep up the great content. Thank you. Hello, sir. How to make money at the Ethereum game developer. I'm not too much into game.
00:31:27.090 - 00:31:50.890, Speaker A: I'm really focused on Defi. But you can check out what they did with. What's this game? Cryptokitties. So basically they make money. They have a marketplace. When you want to sell your virtual kitty, they take a cut out of this. And another one is regularly they sell some new virtual kitty.
00:31:50.890 - 00:32:28.302, Speaker A: So when you buy this new kitty, all the money goes to the game creator. So two ways, on transaction fee and on new character, new item. Why ethereum transaction fee so high these days? Well, it's because Ethereum is the best blockchain and defi is largely on. I mean, just the demand is really high. So we should take it really positively. There are all these bitcoin maximalists that say these stupid things. They say, oh, ethereum will not work because the transaction fee are too high, blah, blah, blah.
00:32:28.302 - 00:32:49.718, Speaker A: This is so stupid. It's like if you see a restaurant, there are too many people and there is a front line with a lot of people waiting, and you're saying, oh, the waiting line is too long. This is bad. No, this is good. It means people want to go to these restaurants. So that's the same thing for Ethereum, means the demand is really high. It's just a matter of time before we figure out a solution.
00:32:49.718 - 00:33:46.990, Speaker A: But as I said before, Defi protocol will start to migrate to layer two solution. So by the end of the year, I predict that in three, six months, we will start to see a decrease of transaction fee because now DFI protocol know very well that this is a big issue and people will leave if the transaction fee keep being this high since three, six months, we're going to start to migrate to layer two for some defi protocol and it's going to reduce the transaction fee a lot. Any thought on Zzz finance? I haven't looked at this protocol. Stephen Edgar asked me, julian, please create a tutorial on how to make an Ethereum wallet. Yeah, I can have a look at it. That's one of the projects in six figure blockchain developer, one of my course that I mentioned at the beginning. You'll find a link in the chat.
00:33:46.990 - 00:34:14.002, Speaker A: Oh, yes. So for people who don't know about my two course. So here to become a blockchain developer and the other one to create flash loan, then. Have you checked out the monolith? No, I don't know about this project. I guess this is a game. I don't know about that one. Do Ethereum gambling game qualify as defi? No, gambling qualify as gambling.
00:34:14.002 - 00:34:50.654, Speaker A: So gambling is really strong on Tron and on EOS, not so much on Defi. Yeah, I mean, that's gambling. That's nothing special. I don't really like the sketchy aspect of gambling in general, and I'm happy that this is not really the focus of Ethereum. Yeah, I think the big niche really is Defi. Defi is the thing that will make Ethereum grow like 101,000 times. Your follower from Saudi Arabia.
00:34:50.654 - 00:35:14.282, Speaker A: I know you can read my name. Weasel name. Hi, weasel. Hello. Can we do multiple swap in uniswap in one transaction? Yeah, you can. That's actually what makes uniswap so amazing. So when you trade with uniswap by using their router smart contract, you actually specify a pass.
00:35:14.282 - 00:36:03.530, Speaker A: So if you want to go from token a to token b to token c, if there is no market between token a and c, but there is a market between a and b and b and c, then you specify a pass. And so that's how you can do a complex trade. I'm not sure if that was what you were asking, or maybe you were asking maybe you want to do from a to b and maybe from d to f, or like two totally unrelated transaction, if that's what you're asking. No, we can't do this. Actually, I was thinking of maybe creating a tutorial on this. In any case, last week I released a tutorial on uniswap V two on my channel. So check it out, because a lot of people told me that was great, that was very useful.
00:36:03.530 - 00:36:23.118, Speaker A: Lex say true about the gas fee. Look at what happened when yam hit. People still pay 300 500 gui easy. Yeah, that's insane. At this level, you have to trade like at least 20,000 us or something like this. Otherwise this is not worth it. All right, thanks, man.
00:36:23.118 - 00:36:34.322, Speaker A: Yeah, no problem. Ashwin. Steven, say zzz. Got to over 1000 in just a little over a week. It's trying to be a better yarn finance. Oh, interesting. Okay, well, I'll check it out.
00:36:34.322 - 00:37:01.670, Speaker A: Yes, we are like Yun finance. Then we are like the Yun finance II from China. Now we have ZTZ. I mean, seems like people are going crazy over Yun finance. That's cool. Lex got it this week. Still have to use it in the raw, right? Okay, Lex, I always have a question in my mind.
00:37:01.670 - 00:37:47.770, Speaker A: What is the difference between the second and first edition of Uniswap? So there are a couple of difference. First, before in the first version of Uniswap, they were using ether. So you had like, for example, a pair of, I don't know, an ES 20 token against ether. So now they use wrap ether instead of ether. And second, now you can have market with two different ERC 20 token. So for example, I don't know, USDC versus comp token, for example. Also, now you can do this complex trade with the path, as I mentioned before, like from a to b, b two, c, et cetera.
00:37:47.770 - 00:38:08.180, Speaker A: And I think in terms of gas fee, I think it's also improved. And there are also some other changes. But check out my video on uniswap v. Two. But you don't have to care about Uniswap V. One because all the liquidity has been moved to uniswap v. Two.
00:38:08.180 - 00:38:30.778, Speaker A: Crypto. Balrog is asking non blockchain question. Can you share a Spotify playlist for the rest of us? Blockchain? Like what? Music. How can I find some blockchain music? You mean like some techno? I don't know. I like to work with some jazz. Like some. Some chill stuff.
00:38:30.778 - 00:39:00.686, Speaker A: Yeah, something without lyrics. Because if there are some lyrics, I just can't really focus. All right, guys, well, I think we're running out of question here. Yeah, that's it. Okay, so, guys, thanks for following. If you're interested it in becoming a blockchain developer, check out my course six figure blockchain developer. If you want to learn how to create Flash loan, check out the other course, profitable flash loan.
00:39:00.686 - 00:39:06.270, Speaker A: And I'll see you for my next video on my channel. Bye, guys. Bye.
