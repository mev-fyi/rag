00:00:17.890 - 00:00:46.666, Speaker A: We are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream of the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and defy. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. So in this video I'm going to be talking about ether new all time high binance smart chain that overtakes Ethereum DFI and we have a ton of new DeFi project this week. So a lot of news. If you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host.
00:00:46.666 - 00:01:18.246, Speaker A: And on my channel idoblogs I explain blockchain technology. And tomorrow, February 23 at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight, same time, I'm going to do a free training how to get a $100,000 blockchain job in 2021. So if you are a newbie and you want to get started in the industry, register for this free training. It will not be on YouTube. So you need to register to get the link. And I put the link in the chat.
00:01:18.246 - 00:01:42.260, Speaker A: There are already many people who register. It's going to be amazing. It's probably going to be my biggest free training since the beginning. We have a ton of new people and we are going to start with some fun with Christine Lagarde. That explain bitcoin. Listen up guy. It's very, very important.
00:01:44.150 - 00:02:08.182, Speaker B: Hello, I am Christine Lagarde and I am here to tell you that you should have fun staying poor. We are going to do absolutely nothing to help you and you will enjoy it. You will own nothing and you will enjoy it. It will be great. Anyway, now, I'm sure you've all heard of this thing called bitcoin. It is very dangerous. It is going to boil the oceans.
00:02:08.182 - 00:02:37.506, Speaker B: And you should stay as far away from bitcoin as you can. Please do not buy any bitcoin. Take your trust and put it in the European Central bank because you may have heard of something called austrian economics. The Austrians don't know anything about what they are talking about. Only the central banks can save the world. And I am here with Christine Agard to save the world. And you might ask yourself now, but Christine, central banks have never helped the world.
00:02:37.506 - 00:02:56.140, Speaker B: How are they going to help this time? Well, this time is different. And you might be saying to yourself, well, I am a citizen of the European Union, so how is this going to benefit me directly? Can I borrow some of this money that is being printed? And the answer is no, you may not. Only a bank may get some of this money.
00:02:59.630 - 00:03:11.866, Speaker A: So funny. Hey guys, tell me in the chat, can we hear clearly when I play a video like this. I really wonder. Okay. And I have another one. So we're not going to play all of it, just a small part. But you can watch the rest after the live stream.
00:03:11.866 - 00:03:15.098, Speaker A: And it's funny. So, bitcoin, explain before Christ.
00:03:15.204 - 00:03:31.106, Speaker B: Rat skins and one of those tepid lemonades. It's one chicken, mate. It's not a chicken. No. That's much better than a chicken, my friend. That is gold. What? Gold.
00:03:31.106 - 00:03:35.350, Speaker B: The currency of the future. Great. Come back in the future.
00:03:35.500 - 00:03:36.274, Speaker A: Rat scared?
00:03:36.322 - 00:03:48.534, Speaker B: No. I don't think you understand. This has unlimited use. Can I eat it? No. Can I wear it? No. Can I use it as firewood? No. Starting to sound pretty limited, mate.
00:03:48.534 - 00:04:00.574, Speaker B: But you can melt it and then turn it into whatever you want. Can I turn it into food? No, you can't eat. Is this going to take long? Hold on your horses, mate. We are dealing in futures here. What's that?
00:04:00.612 - 00:04:21.560, Speaker A: Is that all right? Yeah, but you can watch the rest after. Right. It's funny. Yeah. Guys, so, as you know, last week the NASA rover Perseverance landed on mass. And we already have the first image. Martians actually be crypto holder and they support.
00:04:21.560 - 00:04:51.054, Speaker A: Okay, okay. So it's very touching to see next. Let's be serious. Let's be serious. Okay, so, crypto market survey. So, in the US, there is a majority of American that believe crypto is a safe investment. 25% already own crypto, and 27% saying they plan to invest this year.
00:04:51.054 - 00:05:19.606, Speaker A: That means potentially we could have a majority of American who own some crypto by the end of the year. And also the Google searches for bitcoin haven't reached the all time high of 2017 during the previous crypto market bull run. So that means really still have a lot of room for improvement here. So this is not the end of the bull run. It's probably not even the middle of it. Yeah. So I really think, like, a phenomenal pump is coming.
00:05:19.606 - 00:05:58.342, Speaker A: This is going to be really nuts. Okay, so, zed, we're going to continue with the price of bitcoin. What's going on this week? So we reach an all time high of 2030, $8 to be exact. And now we are right in the middle of a crash. So, at the same time, if you check out the price of the BNB token, which is the token of binance smart chain is pretty stable. So I think that what we see here is kind of an overreaction of what happened with the sudden popularity of binance smart chain. Some people are freaking out.
00:05:58.342 - 00:06:34.654, Speaker A: But, yeah, this is really just an overreaction. Then we have what's happening for gas price. So it's stabilizing a little bit. So after the big increase of the week before, now we have very high plateau. It's probably because of the recent popularity of the binance smart chain. We'll talk more about this a little bit later. But yeah, now we have stopped to increase like crazy the gas price on Ethereum Z.
00:06:34.654 - 00:07:06.140, Speaker A: We're going to check the Defi market cap. So it's pretty stable this week. About 40 billion was the same last week. So considering all the action on binance marching this week, actually I feel like Ethereum defi resisted pretty well. And also there is no ether outflow from Defi. So overall I would say not too bad. Then let's see the situation on the rate.
00:07:06.140 - 00:07:22.106, Speaker A: So we still have some nice rate here. 9% tether, 9% USDC. 8% die. But a little bit lower than last week. Oh my God. USDC, completely insane. 42% for die.
00:07:22.106 - 00:07:51.434, Speaker A: I don't know what's going on there. Okay, so then let's check out the price for the top Defi token. All right, let's bring this tab here. So first there is this important metric. If you see the market cap of the top 100 defi token, it will soon reach $100 billion. So it's really big milestone. Then let's see the winner and the loser for this week.
00:07:51.434 - 00:08:23.570, Speaker A: So front, this is the biggest winner this week, 153%. This is a dashboard for Defi. We also have Trustwap, 150%. So the reason why Trustwap increased so much is because they released a new website and mainly they introduced a new feature. Now you can buy some swap token with credit card. So of course that triggered the huge inflow. Dodo, that's a new kind of asset.
00:08:23.570 - 00:08:46.762, Speaker A: Automated market maker pumping like crazy. Then we have pancake swap pumping like crazy. So yeah, I mean, we can see Pancakeswap and also Venus here who are pumping. It's normal because this week binance smart chain was really crazy. Then we have Bancor pumping. What else? Yeah, uni pumping a little bit. Yeah.
00:08:46.762 - 00:09:33.214, Speaker A: But overall we actually have more loser than winner. Like if we see the red this week is more red than green. So not a great week for the Defi token. In general here cover insurance protocol agic and option protocol acropolis yield aggregator NFTX allow you to invest in NFT. Yeah, a lot of red here. Okay, so then we are going to continue with the news of Defi project. And first, Uniswap that has reached a new milestone 100 billion dollar in total trading volume since the beginning.
00:09:33.214 - 00:10:03.086, Speaker A: That's really a lot. So even though they are under attack from all fronts, like from Ethereum with sushiswap, and from project on other blockchain, like pancakeswap, actually they are still resisting. Okay, I believe. And also related to uniswap. So they have released this other project, uni, sock. So it's basically a limited edition NFT. If you have it, you can redeem it against sock.
00:10:03.086 - 00:10:23.820, Speaker A: So I think it kind of started as a joke. And you only have 500 available, and it has reached almost $80,000. It's pretty insane. Yeah, I think it seems like now it's crashing a little bit. Yeah. So big pump on the stocks by. I wouldn't buy that.
00:10:23.820 - 00:10:33.514, Speaker A: Wouldn't buy that. Okay, so then we have this new Defi project coming out. Hi fi. Just the name. I like it.
00:10:33.552 - 00:10:34.006, Speaker B: Hi fi.
00:10:34.038 - 00:11:04.246, Speaker A: I don't know, it sounds neat. I like it. So it's a new lending protocol that was formerly known as mainframe. Yeah, I mean, hi fi, I think, is much better than mainframe for a name. So what they do is fixed rate lending and borrowing, which is different from most other lending protocols, like Ave compound, which have variable rates. So for borrower, it means they can know exactly how much they will pay for their loan. And for lenders, they will know exactly how much they will be paid.
00:11:04.246 - 00:11:47.578, Speaker A: So it's a much more predictability for everybody. It's implemented as a zero coupon bond. So a zero coupon bond is a special kind of bond where basically there is no coupon, so there is no interest. Let's say you pay a zero coupon bond $70, and a couple of years later, when you are reimbursed, you are reimbursed not 70, but 100. So all the interest are compounded and paid at the end with the principal. And I guess the reason why that shows this is because I guess it's probably more simple to implement this in smart contract. So it opened up the possibility for what we call rate swaps.
00:11:47.578 - 00:12:19.242, Speaker A: So, rate swap, it is something that is used, a financial instrument that is used in traditional finance. Retail investors usually never heard of what is a rate swap. You can google it after. But basically, it's huge. In traditional finance, it's really something huge. So if rate swaps start to take off on Defi, it's one more use case. As I said before, hi fi was formerly known as a mainframe.
00:12:19.242 - 00:12:59.094, Speaker A: And they acquired a Savlier, which is a protocol for paying salaries on the blockchain, actually the founder of Savlier is also quite active in the blockchain dev tooling. So he built something called a create eth app, which is a tool to quickly create new blockchain project. Yeah, it's just for your crypto culture. So if you want to invest in this, the token is called MFT. Not NFT, MFT. And it's actually still quite low since what they're doing is pretty original. I predict a bright future for these guys then Vesper finance.
00:12:59.094 - 00:13:23.218, Speaker A: So it's another new DeFi protocol. It was released after a few months of beta. So it's a yield aggregator, similar to yarn finance. It automatically invests your money. It's built by block, which is the company of Jeff Gazik. So Jeff Gazik is a heavyweight in the blockchain industry. He used to be a bitcoin core developer, so obviously he knows what he's doing.
00:13:23.218 - 00:13:47.510, Speaker A: And I was actually contacted to work for one of his company that does blockchain in space. It's called spacechain. But unfortunately I was too busy with block so I couldn't really follow suit. But yeah, if you're interested, check out space chain. It's a really great company. So this project, Vesper Finance, is not the first yield aggregator. There are many others, but it's backed by really big name in blockchain.
00:13:47.510 - 00:14:20.530, Speaker A: So yeah, I believe in it. And so their token is called the. Then, then another new project, Rye. So it's a new stable coin, it's a fork of Dai, and it's co founded by Amin Soleimani. Now, I always have trouble saying his name. And so he's an early builder in the ethereum space. He's also the founder of Spank chain, which is an ethereum project for the adult.
00:14:20.530 - 00:15:09.874, Speaker A: So the goal of Rye is to be less centralized than other stablecoins. So USDC tether are controlled by a centralized entity, and Dai uses USDC and tether as collateral, so indirectly it make it centralized. So Rye want to solve this problem. And last week the company behind Rye, reflexor Labs, announced that they will raise $4 million. So yeah, for Stablecoin project, I would say it's a little bit difficult to have a positive opinion because I think stablecoin project is what we call a winner take all market. In the end, we only have a stablecoin that is better than the other, less volatile, and that's going to just take over pretty much all the market. And now we start to see a lot of competition in stablecoins.
00:15:09.874 - 00:15:52.514, Speaker A: Like a lot of algorithmic stablecoin. So, yeah, it seems to be like a pretty crowded place. I think we're going to see some consolidation at some point this year. All right, so next we're going to talk of Bitwise, which is launching a new crypto fund. So Bitwise is an investment fund for crypto and they just launched a new fund specialized in DeFi, and it will have the biggest DeFi token. So here you can see what they will have and with the weight. So the funds will be held by Anchorage, which is the first crypto bank to be approved by regulators in the US.
00:15:52.514 - 00:16:27.242, Speaker A: It's headquartered in California. And everything went really fast for Anchorage. They were approved last month and they already have some customer. So as a retail investor, you can't invest in the fund directly because it's for accredited investors only. So probably we're going to see mostly institutionals. If you are wondering which Defi token to hold, you can follow what they have in their phone. I pretty much agree with all the token they hold, except Yuma.
00:16:27.242 - 00:17:16.542, Speaker A: I don't think they have as much traction as the other and zero X. Yeah, there used to be a pioneer in the decentralized exchange space, but recently we didn't really see much traction in Zero X. But yeah, all the other one. I pretty much agree with that selection. All right, so next, this week was really busy for liquidation. So some people ask me, do we still have some money to make in flash loan and in liquidation? Do we still have some opportunity? And the answer is obviously yes, because we saw the largest liquidation event of all time in Defi. So usually liquidation and arbitrage opportunities happen very rarely, but when they do happen, it's a lot happening at the same time.
00:17:16.542 - 00:17:55.390, Speaker A: It's a little bit like if you're waiting for a big wave, so you need to have your script ready, and when the opportunities strike, then it's bloody. Next, some news about NFT. So there was a new big NFT sale. So there was $1 million of crypto punk that was bought by a well on Sunday. If you never heard of crypto punks, it's one of the most popular NFT series. There are 10,000 of them, and it's basically a pixelated little avatar. And the company behind Cryptopunk is called Lava.
00:17:55.390 - 00:18:34.034, Speaker A: Lava Labs. Yeah. So they are the authoritative source of information for Cryptopunk. I'm not sure if we have some Dao that invest in crypto punks so that retail investor can invest in them. Yeah, we'll be interesting to know, then still in NFT, someone saw the new car of Elon Musk in Decentraland, which is a blockchain based game to buy some real estate. And yes, there's a cybertruck of Elon Musk is in the game. Yes.
00:18:34.034 - 00:19:10.858, Speaker A: So, guys, if you are in Decentraland, I don't know how it works exactly, like can you buy the car? But I know some people are making money with Decentraland. Apparently there is a whole economy that is working where people are like flipping a parcel in Decentraland. Then we're going to talk of investment. Defi company that raised money. So Nexus Mutual just raised $2.7 million in the token sale. So it's a decentralized insurance protocol for DFI.
00:19:10.858 - 00:20:02.180, Speaker A: So DFI insurance is going to be huge, guys, and Nexus Mutual wants to capture a big part of it. So their goal in 2021 is to sell $1 billion worth of coverage spread across 30 protocols. And I had a look at their token NXM and it just had really nice dive. So maybe a good buying opportunity here. Then we're going to talk of Dapper Labs, the creator of cryptokitties, and also an NFT platform called NBA Topshot. And so in total, they sold 100 million of dollars of NFT since the beginning. And they just announced that they raised $250,000,000, I think is one of the biggest investment in a Defi company so far.
00:20:02.180 - 00:20:41.310, Speaker A: So these guys are getting really big. Then we're going to chalk of the hack of the week. And this happened to cryptopia, which is an exchange in New Zealand. So it's so bad that they were hacked because they are already suffering, because they were already hacked of 24 million in 2019. And so now they are in liquidation. That means that's the end of the company. And then there was this hacker that didn't care at all, and he saw a wanted animal and he thought, oh, you know what, I'm going to end it.
00:20:41.310 - 00:21:16.006, Speaker A: And so it was only $45,000 that was hacked again. And weirdly, that was stolen from a cold wallet. So if you never heard of cold wallet, it's basically wallets that exchange keep offline in order to protect the money. So all exchange have this. And most of the money of customers, they are in cold wallet, not hot wallet, so totally disconnected from the Internet. So it's really weird that the hacker was able to steal from the cold. Then we're going to talk ETF.
00:21:16.006 - 00:21:56.742, Speaker A: So we had a big news this week. The first bitcoin ETF was approved in North America. And so they collected more than $400 million of asset under management in two days. And one analyst said that the ETF could reach $1 billion in asset under management by the end of next week. So potentially a big pump for bitcoin. And just after that, we had another announcement, a second canadian ETF that started to trade last week and already traded 200 million of share the first day. And to give you a comparison, most ETF for the first day, they trade below $50 million.
00:21:56.742 - 00:22:39.334, Speaker A: So obviously that was one of the most popular ETF, and it's not finished because our canadian friend cannot stop their bitcoin frenzy. They're all about bitcoin. And so we're going to have a third bitcoin ETF in Canada. So it just doesn't stop. So it's really a big deal because it's been years that the industry has been waiting for an ETF in New York. And so finally, it's really refreshing to see all of this action in Canada. It's really going to open the floodgate because now it's more difficult for New York to resist when they see that other financial places are doing it, because now they don't want to lag behind.
00:22:39.334 - 00:23:22.318, Speaker A: So it's going to put a huge pressure on them next regulation. So India keeps being crypto earned friendly. So India, top securities regulator, reportedly wants IPO promoters to get rid of any holding of cryptocurrencies before their company consider filling for an IPO. So I think that India is really going against the tide here because at the moment seems like most other countries start to be more crypto friendly. So I don't think India is going to keep up in this direction for long. Yeah, it's going to be a little bit tough to continue. Like, then we're going to talk politics.
00:23:22.318 - 00:24:25.080, Speaker A: So Andrew Young, who is a Democrat, who was running for the presidential election before, is now running for mayor of New York City, and he wants to turn New York City into a hub for the crypto industry. So New York City is very symbolic because for the financial industry, this is where we have the biggest exchanges, Wall street, et cetera. So so far, it has been pretty resistant to crypto, but there was a lot of lobbying for crypto with the Winklevos brother, for example. And now we see the tide turning for Wall street. We start to see some support for. So New York City might become more crypto friendly and we might finally see a bitcoin ETF as a result. Okay, so then some news for other blockchain so bitcoin this week there was a new all time high at 58,000.
00:24:25.080 - 00:24:52.682, Speaker A: So now everybody's really confident that we are going to reach $100,000 this year. And the volume is pretty high. So we were at 70. And it seems like this day today it's like even 90. So usually in the weeks before it was more like 50. So yeah, it's getting more and more intense. And what's also interesting about bitcoin is actually about Ethereum.
00:24:52.682 - 00:25:36.750, Speaker A: So we start to see more and more bitcoin that are moving to Ethereum. Now we almost have 1% of the bitcoin supply on ether. On Ethereum, this is thanks to synthetics bitcoin token, like Gen, BTC, WBTC, et cetera. It represents 63 times the total bitcoin of blockstream liquid and 158 the total bitcoin on the lighting network. So clearly, clearly this is all happening on Ethereum right now, even for bitcoin. So that really shows you the power of Ethereum. Next, some news of binance smart chain.
00:25:36.750 - 00:26:12.742, Speaker A: So the big news of the week is that DeFi and binance smart chain overtakes Ethereum. So I already covered this in another video last week, so I'll let you go watch this after this live stream. But very briefly. The Defi dapps with the most users and the most trading volume are now on binance smart chain. So it has been really, really shocking for a lot of people on Ethereum. And the BNB token, which is used to pay the transaction fee on the binance smart chain, doubled in one week. So if you want to follow what's going on on Binance smart chain, check out this website, Defi station.
00:26:12.742 - 00:27:14.350, Speaker A: It's like DeFi post, but for binance smart chain. So following all of this, we saw a lot of drama on Twitter with CZ, the CEO of Binance, telling Unisop to move to a binance smart chain. And there was also another drama with binance halting the draw of ether, which made some people wonder that it was on purpose to hurt Ethereum. But in any case, the most important is that the funds are safe food according to Cz. Okay? Very, very important. So let me show you some crypto culture, guys, okay? Oh no.
00:27:14.500 - 00:27:15.182, Speaker B: Oh God.
00:27:15.236 - 00:27:15.646, Speaker A: No.
00:27:15.748 - 00:27:17.230, Speaker B: Bundles are safe.
00:27:19.490 - 00:27:21.550, Speaker A: I need to withdraw my funds.
00:27:23.890 - 00:27:25.470, Speaker B: Bundles are safer.
00:27:52.410 - 00:28:30.222, Speaker A: Okay, so next, some news about Polkadot. So Polkadot just released a plan for the parachain launch. So parachain are the polka dot equivalent of Ethereum 2.0 shard chain. However, the big difference is that each shard on polka dot can be customized for specific needs. So next step is to roll out parachains on kusama which is the testnet of polka dot. So potentially we're going to see some nice pump for the then some news about Cardano Cardano.
00:28:30.222 - 00:29:06.686, Speaker A: So user will be able. Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. So they're going to do the mari hard fork soon with this in early March. And so with this hard fork users will be able to define their own custom tokens through the multi asset ledger. So expect to see some action here. I predict that it's going to be similar to binance smart chain. We're going to see some nice pump at the beginning, especially if we see some token that start to launch on Cardano.
00:29:06.686 - 00:30:06.530, Speaker A: I think these tokens are going to pump quite fast then some news from secret network so this is a blockchain based on the Cosmos SDK tender mint. It was launched in May 2020 and the main feature of this blockchain is privacy preserving smart contract. So that means application built on secret network can utilize encrypted data without revealing anything to anyone, even the nodes in the network. And they just released their first DAP secret swap which is a decentralized exchange like Uniswap. So the big difference is that it has privacy feature that prevent to be front run by boats. So potentially it could be really interesting for doing arbitrage with flash loan. Okay so now we are going to do the Q and a very briefly.
00:30:06.530 - 00:30:37.680, Speaker A: I put the link to the live training for tomorrow. If you are a newbie in the industry and you want to learn how you can get your first blockchain job, make sure to register for this training. This will be outside of YouTube so you need to register to get the link. It will be tomorrow, February 23 at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. Okay, so let me scroll up and check out all the questions. Wow, we have a lot of activity today.
00:30:37.680 - 00:31:10.610, Speaker A: Hi Raman CM Tanta, Gary Sente, Stan Nilesh, Eric Badier, Jim Miller, Ayodeji Davinci is saying e 1500. No way. No way. Davenshu can Ada ever be $2? Yeah, I think so. It can be $2, can be $10. I think Ada is going to pump a lot. Alton hello th shx like this.
00:31:10.610 - 00:31:45.220, Speaker A: Hey I recently saw people using bitcoin for bad stuff on tv. They stream it on a twitch like program called D Live. Okay, I never heard of that. The tv news reported they were using that particular money to help fund the US Capitol insurrection interesting. Yeah. There were also some rumors that said some french guy funded the US Capitol insurrection. Yeah, seems a little bit conspiracy news to me.
00:31:45.220 - 00:31:58.802, Speaker A: BGA infotech. I like the dump and bleeding market. Let it bleed. Yes. That means we have some nice entry opportunity. Stan. Hey, Julian.
00:31:58.802 - 00:32:28.450, Speaker A: Do you hold any crypto? Yes. So basically all the people who pay me with ETH, I just keep the eth. But apart from this, I don't do enough trading. So yeah, I want to start to invest more into altcoin. I probably want to take some cardano, probably some loop ring. What else? Maybe optimism. I'm not sure if they have a token matic.
00:32:28.450 - 00:33:26.770, Speaker A: All the l two scaling solution on East BNB finance marching and maybe some djen stuff on finance march and like some up and coming project. But yeah, basically everything I invest for this super risky stuff, I only invest what I can afford to lose. So yeah, I'm quite conservative. Bga infotech, do you have a product? What do you mean? I have courses to learn. Blockchain development, if it's what you mean, then Neela is saying, does gold prices and cryptocurrency price are inversely proportional if gold price among crypto goes down, is it true? No, I don't think so. That'd be interesting. But I believe that gold and bitcoin are pretty correlated because they are used for a similar purpose, which is to preserve wealth.
00:33:26.770 - 00:34:04.794, Speaker A: But in the future, it's possible that probably bitcoin is going to outperform gold because this is a better form of gold. Are you excited for the flare network? I haven't heard of it. Back's question for Julian. Gas price 751,500 gray well, I hope not. And especially now with finance smart chain, I think we're going to see some stabilization for the gas price on ether. Gary Sente, can you explain what are Launchpad hope this is different from. So I think you are referring to the binance smart chain.
00:34:04.794 - 00:34:34.778, Speaker A: Launchpad. It's basically a way to easily onboard project so they can be listed on binance, I believe. I think it's what you mean. But Launchpad can mean very different things according to the project. So yeah, it's really project specific. Ibrahim, is there an Ethereum telegram group? So there is a Facebook group for idoblocks. So you'll see the link in the header of the channel.
00:34:34.778 - 00:35:20.938, Speaker A: And also there is a private discord group for people who took one of my Jason Porter. Hey, when the link for the free training be sent out, it will be sent 30 minutes before the training tomorrow. Yeah, so it's at 11:00 p.m. So I will send it at 1030 and we will use Zoom. So guys, if you haven't installed zoom yet, make sure to install it because you need it for the. See, let me see. Mark.
00:35:20.938 - 00:35:35.866, Speaker A: Talk about getting kicked when you're down. I don't know. Marona saying great, great news. Thank you. Crypto is taking over the world. Yes. Kellen Chase.
00:35:35.866 - 00:36:11.530, Speaker A: An NFT sale like that in 20 minutes sounds like money laundering to me. I couldn't quite possibly comment on that. Marinas, you'd be impressed to know how fast investors put their money in project like this. Yeah, now money is flowing really quickly. Nilsh will binance make ethereum less lucrative? I don't think long term Finance is going to hurt Ethereum. I think everything we see is just short term solution not coming, especially with the layer two scaling solution. So if not, it's going to accelerate the movement.
00:36:11.530 - 00:36:38.030, Speaker A: Now, builders on Defi know that they have this huge pressure, so they have a huge incentive to solve the problem quickly. It's not like binance do something and that's it. That's the end of the game. Like they're going to be a reaction from Ethereum. So yeah, this is dynamic. All right. Abdullila saying binance marching is centralized.
00:36:38.030 - 00:37:02.786, Speaker A: Yes. They have 21 validators. Gary sent it. Do you have Cardano, Julian? Not yet, but I'm waiting for it to dip below one dollars. And Anna, take some. Nilesh, does has Cardano give tough time for ethereum? Not at all. Jay Dune.
00:37:02.786 - 00:37:22.014, Speaker A: Hey, Julian. Where are you from? From France. Where are you in Taiwan now? Oh, well, it's a long story. I've been in Taiwan for a long time. I've been in Asia for more than ten years now. Used to be in Hong Kong, Taiwan and yeah, just love life here. Taiwan is great.
00:37:22.014 - 00:37:53.178, Speaker A: And during the COVID it's amazing because here there is almost nothing. So it's like, almost like life is almost normal here. So yeah, we are really lucky. Bga, what do you think? Phantom Foundation? I don't know this Jason Porter. Will you be sending out the link to watch tomorrow? Yes, it'll be 30 minutes before the training tomorrow at 1030 G. Miller. Great job.
00:37:53.178 - 00:38:14.494, Speaker A: Thank you. Mega Montana. Hey, nanny, opinion on BNB token? Yeah, BNB token, I think is going to continue to pump. So it was at 300, I think not even one day ago. Now it's retracing to 250. Maybe it's going to continue to retrace a little bit, but it's going to keep going up. Will BNB token kill is certainly not.
00:38:14.494 - 00:38:34.200, Speaker A: Certainly not. Batman. Hey, Batman. Freaking snow make me late. Okay, so I guess Batman, seems like you live in a very cold region. Cold region. Actually it could be Texas because it's snowing in Texas right now.
00:38:34.200 - 00:39:13.454, Speaker A: Daff ready? Is your lifetime all access pass still at 497? No lifetime access pass. It's finished already? It was for Black Friday in November. It's finished. Gilbani, what is the best place to find your project except Gitcoin? GitHub. Okay, wait a second. What do you mean? You mean project to invest. But you mentioned Gitcoin, so I'm guessing you mean project as a developer.
00:39:13.454 - 00:39:42.474, Speaker A: I think you mean. Yeah. So in this case I would check out GitHub. You search for some keywords like ethereum, crypto, trading bot, everything you want and then yeah, you go through the result actually for a couple of machutorial. That's how I do it. I just search on GitHub, I find some nice code, I modify it and yeah, you find a lot of cool stuff on GitHub. Ita binance marching and ethereum will be together.
00:39:42.474 - 00:40:07.058, Speaker A: Have infinite mindset. Yes, I love it. Meruna is saying bona bona. I think it means good night. Nani R is saying hi to all the indian love from India. Yeah, the miners. Are you in yield farm on smart chain? No, no, but I should be.
00:40:07.058 - 00:40:30.054, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe I should do some yield farming on auto farm. Seems like it's where it's at now. What's your opinion on yield farming? I think it's cool, but at the same time don't have any dream of becoming rich with yield farming. It's for fun, really. Zagriu. Hi everybody. Hi Zagriu.
00:40:30.054 - 00:40:47.182, Speaker A: Batman. I'm in Canada actually. I had a feeling you're in Canada. I don't know why, I had a no Jill saying. Yeah, your question was for developer. Okay, I already answered that, Michael. Sorry for the Noob question.
00:40:47.182 - 00:41:37.010, Speaker A: Does BNB chen as minor like ethereum, how does the transaction get validated? So it's a proof of authority consensus, which basically means you need to be pre approved validators to mine transaction. Yeah, so it's not really a blockchain, it's really a glorified database. Kevin, what's your process of learning code? Do you watch tutorials? Yeah, of course. Watch video, read article. I also like to read the code so very often for defi project maybe the documentation is not great. So I just like to read their solidity code and try to understand what's going on? I see crypto. Have you heard mention of the student coin token? You skip my question.
00:41:37.010 - 00:42:02.866, Speaker A: Sorry, man, didn't see your question before. So no student coin. I never heard about this. All right, guys, so, yeah, I think this is almost the end of it. Gary Sente so we are two months in 2021. What year is going to be for NFT, DFI, ETF? Well, I would say all of the above. I think this year, this is really the explosion of crypto.
00:42:02.866 - 00:42:32.638, Speaker A: I think it's going to go in every direction, really. I think it's going to be like 2017, but power ten, it's going to be like an explosion, guys. It's going to be a real firework. Edwin finance smart chain training. So on my channel I have a couple of videos for binance smart chain. But what you have to understand is you won't find any training just for binance smart chain. The keyword is Ethereum, because binance smart chain reuses all the tech of Ethereum.
00:42:32.638 - 00:42:58.422, Speaker A: So if you want to build on binance smart chain, you basically have to search for tutorial for Ethereum. And after, you only have to make a very small modification to make it work on binance smart chain. But it's almost the same thing. Yes. Okay, so let me put the last time, the link to the free training tomorrow. How to get a blockchain job. Blockchain developer job in 2021.
00:42:58.422 - 00:43:24.860, Speaker A: If you are new in the industry, make sure to register for this training tomorrow at eleven P UTC plus eight. And guys, I think we are going to stop here. I think this is the end of the question. So, yeah, that was great to see you, all of you today. And I'm going to see some of you tomorrow for the free training. Yes. All right, guys, thank.
