00:00:00.250 - 00:00:29.010, Speaker A: For the first time, I am worried. A blockchain is eating the launch of Ethereum. Defi is exploding on its blockchain and might soon catch up with Ethereum. We can just sit there and do nothing. We have to find out what's going on. I'm Julian, and on my channel, Ethoblox, I explain blockchain technology. So first I'm going to tell you about a couple of projects on the blockchain that is competing with Ethereum.
00:00:29.010 - 00:01:00.954, Speaker A: First, we have Venus. Venus is the biggest DeFi project in terms of transaction volume at the moment across all blockchain. This really came out of nowhere. What is the Venus project? This is a combination of two projects on Ethereum, compound, the lending platform, and mechodao, the creators of the Dai stablecoin. On Venus. Like on compound, you can lend your coins and borrow all the coins based on the collateral you deposited on the platform. And on top of it, you can also mint some stable coins called Vi based on your collateral.
00:01:00.954 - 00:01:33.082, Speaker A: Andre Cronhead, the creator of Yon finance, is planning to do a project like this on ethereum, but Venice already did it on another blockchain. The next project to know is autofarm. Autofarm is number two in terms of users and transaction volume. Out of all the Defi project across all blockchain, this also came out of nowhere. This is so defi you think you are on top of it. You have your eyes everywhere. You spend the whole day listening to everything, and you wake up the next day just to find out that you've been missing on something super important.
00:01:33.082 - 00:02:05.902, Speaker A: So autofarm is a yield aggregator. Like Yan finance on Ethereum, it constantly monitor the market and reallocate your coins to the d five project with the highest yield. For some polls, we have some crazy yield, up to 354,000%. And finally we have pancake swap. Pancake swap is the first DeFi project across all blockchains. In terms of users, pancake swap is a decentralized exchange where you can buy and sell tokens. I checked the code and it's pretty much a copy and paste of uniswap on Ethereum.
00:02:05.902 - 00:03:00.546, Speaker A: Nothing very original here, but because it was one of the first decentralized exchange on these other blockchain, it got really popular really fast. So it's pretty clear that one of the biggest reason why people are going to this other blockchain is because of the crazy yield there. But what is this other blockchain I've been talking about? I was talking of the finance smart chain. It was launched by Binance in September 2020, and in six months it has already grown tremendously. The price of the BNB tokens, which is used to pay transaction fees on binance smart chain is increasing very fast. In terms of unique active wallet, it has grown a lot and you can also analyze the ranking for the different d five project on DAP radars. In terms of transaction volume, the top DeFi Dapps are now on the binance smart chain, and for users it's even more impressive.
00:03:00.546 - 00:03:28.474, Speaker A: The first DFI app on Ethereum is synthetics at the 15th position. I was really shocked when I saw that. But keep in mind that these stats are only for the last 24 hours, but it does show a trend. This is DFI station, a website that leads the biggest DFI project on a binance smart chain. So this is the equivalent of DFI pulse. On Ethereum, we are already at $9.5 billion of value locked on binance to go from 1 billion to 9 billion.
00:03:28.474 - 00:04:03.878, Speaker A: It took 50 days, but on Ethereum it took 270 days. So it grew much faster on binance smart chain. Why people are coming to binance smart chain very quickly the first reason is, as I said before, because of the very high yield of DeFi project there. And second, we also have much lower gas fees on binance smart chain. On Ethereum it's becoming a huge problem and now only wells can participate in some DeFi projects. Does this mean that the party is over for Ethereum? Not so fast. The tradeoff on the binance smart chain is more scalability in exchange of more centralization.
00:04:03.878 - 00:04:44.034, Speaker A: They only have 21 validators versus 12,000 nodes on Ethereum. In the short term, people would just want to make a quick buck on DFI project and nobody care about this. But in the future, at some point regulators will come and ask Binance to shut down some defi apps on the binance smart chain. They will be forced to comply and that will be a huge hit to the credibility of the binance smart chain. So here is my advice. If you are a beginner, learn Ethereum first and after, once you know Ethereum, learn binance smart chain. It's based on the technology of Ethereum so you can reuse all your Ethereum knowledge.
00:04:44.034 - 00:04:48.500, Speaker A: And to get started on binance smart chain. I have a tutorial here, I'll see you there.
