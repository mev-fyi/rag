00:00:08.310 - 00:00:49.110, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly live stream on the latest and greatest news about Ethereum and defy. We do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. If you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host, and on my channel, itoblogs, I teach blockchain development and if you are a newbie on my channel and you want to become a professional blockchain developer, register for my free training. I put the link in the chat and also some news of the idoblox token. So a few weeks I airdrop a token for the channel and since then I haven't given you.
00:00:49.110 - 00:01:15.920, Speaker A: So I'm working on a system to vote for the token. So this is going to be a DAO app and I still need to do some testing, but most likely it will go live this week. So don't forget about the token, it will be useful very soon. So hi everybody. In the chat, we have abracadabra, we have George Kenichi, we have Dixon. We have Dunkler Lord. We have Jeremy G.
00:01:15.920 - 00:01:45.778, Speaker A: So we're going to start with the price of ethers. So that wasn't a good week. Unfortunately, we increased very fast in the past few weeks, probably a little bit too fast. I think that was a little bit too much euphoria in the market. So yeah, what happened just had to happen. We had a drop, but that's okay. That's crypto.
00:01:45.778 - 00:02:14.526, Speaker A: If you are new to crypto, you think that's the end of the road, that's the end of the bull market, blah, blah blah. But no, if you've been in this for a while, you know that you shouldn't be afraid of that. It's totally unexpected. And it's also related to some negative tweets, especially after Elon Musk. We will see this later. So in terms of gas price. So recently the trend has been to go down for the gas price on Ethereum.
00:02:14.526 - 00:03:00.910, Speaker A: And we know that this is so key because if we have high gas price, a lot of people are going to leave the platform. So we had a really good trend the past few weeks, but unfortunately this week it went up again. So then some news about ether scan, the blockchain explorer for Ethereum. So they've added support for ENs name. So if you've never seen ens name, it's basically addresses where basically you have a domain name. So maybe it can be like your name eth, something like this. So it's more clear than just the zero x plus all the gibberish and so now on ether scan we have a support for ENs addresses, so it's a big improvement for usability.
00:03:00.910 - 00:03:58.530, Speaker A: Also, other news for ether scan, they have not reached Alexa top 1000 or top 100. I think it's top 1000, which means they are above in the 1000 most visited website on earth. So that means there is an increasing interest for Ethereum, which is great. Then some news about flashboard. So there is now 85% of the hash power of the Ethereum network that uses flashboard and the profits generated by flashboard for miners reach $45 million. So flashboard is a new system for the gas price bidding that works off chain and it allowed to reduce significantly the gas price on Ethereum over the past few weeks. And if you want to follow what's happening with flashboards, you can check out this dashboard.
00:03:58.530 - 00:04:50.302, Speaker A: Then we're going to continue with the market cap of DFI. So of course, following the decrease in ether, of course the market cap decreased a little bit. We were about to reach 90 billion and now we are closer to 80 in terms of the number of ether in the system. We actually were on a downward trend and now we are bouncing up a little bit. Now we also have some indicator for the number of bitcoin locked in ether because thanks to project like a wrap bitcoin, we start to have more and more bitcoin in DFI. So actually number of bitcoin locked in the system is going up. And really, when you see this total value locked, you can see we're really close to 100 billion.
00:04:50.302 - 00:05:21.706, Speaker A: So I really think it's just a matter of weeks before we reach this. Okay, so next let's see the bigger winner and loser for the defi coin. So ave the kind of aave is doing really well. Yarn finance. Yeah, no, sorry, ave this is actually the new ticker. This is the old ticker here. Then sushiswap is doing well? Yeah, I think sushiswap has been really undervalued because we saw some of price action for Uniswap.
00:05:21.706 - 00:05:50.470, Speaker A: But sushi hasn't been doing great, at least for the price action. And I don't see any reason for that because sushi is a great project as well. But all in all, it wasn't too great. Oh yeah. So another thing I've noticed about coin gecko is that it seems like we are missing some coins. For example, I know it was a great week for Polygon, so formerly known as Matic. I think they grew of 60 or 80%.
00:05:50.470 - 00:06:25.300, Speaker A: So I'm going to do some comparison with the other dashboard because it seems like coin gecko misses some coin. Yeah. So what about the loser? So we had way more loser than gainer this week because that was a bad week for crypto. Apaca finance yield aggregator, wex. Never heard about that one. Let me see one inch, which is a Dex aggregator on Ethereum, amperforce, stablecoin. Yeah, so a lot of pancake swap, so a lot of red this week.
00:06:25.300 - 00:07:06.906, Speaker A: I don't panic, I like it when I see a lot of red. It means that you have a lot of discounts. So yeah, just a buying opportunity for me. Okay, so next we are going to continue with news for defi project and we're going to start with balancer. So balancer V two is live and the main feature is a reduced gas fee up to 50%. If you never heard of balancer, this is basically a more sophisticated uniswap that allow you to do some sophisticated liquidity pool. You can basically do some sort of automated investment fund on the blockchain with balancer.
00:07:06.906 - 00:08:04.734, Speaker A: And I think this is going to be the back end of more and more defi project and they have really high ambition. Balancer wants to be the first decentralized exchange on Ethereum, so they basically want to be the new Uniswap. So I'm super excited of all these new projects that are going to be built on Balancer V two. Then some news about uni, the token of Uniswap. So Vitalik buttering made a proposal so that uni, the governance token of Uniswap, be used as an oracle token to create a new kind of oracle for ether USD. So why we need this? So stablecoin needs an oracle for the price of ether USD. So currently the oracle of Uniswap, they are only for assets that are on the blockchain.
00:08:04.734 - 00:09:04.982, Speaker A: So for example, we have oracle for ether USDC, but this is not sufficient to have this. To do stablecoin, we actually need to have the price of crypto token versus fiat. So in order to do this we can already use chainlink and it's great. But Vitalik thinks that there is a room for a more simple alternative which is specialized in high value and use case that are okay with a high latency. So he thinks that the uni token is in a great position to create this oracle, mainly because it has a high market cap. And in the design of this new oracle, it would be very costly to do an attack because the attack is correlated to the market cap of the token. So yeah, in the past, Vitalik buttering has launched a lot of ideas that were later implemented by builder in the space.
00:09:04.982 - 00:09:39.440, Speaker A: For example, Uniswap itself. Originally he was a post of Vitalik buttering. So it's very likely that Uniswap is going to act on this. Then some news from binance smart chain. So on Twitter I find this graph. So that's basically that gives you the top coin on binance smart chain by developer activity. So pancake swap among the first 10 x.
00:09:39.440 - 00:10:08.406, Speaker A: I wasn't even aware that they were on binance smart chain. Yeah. So that can give you some idea if you want to buy some coin on binance smart chain. Then some news of pancake swap. So there was a new record for the number of active user for pancake swap. They reached 1.7 million active users.
00:10:08.406 - 00:11:02.614, Speaker A: So it's now the biggest decentralized exchange in front of Uniswap, largely because binance smart chain has lower fee. But now with Uniswap V three that has just launched, maybe that we're going to see Uniswap going back to the first place, especially since Uniswap V three is also going to be on a side chain of ethereum with lower transaction fee. Then we have news of a default protocol called b earn that was hacked, $11 million. So the hack is still under investigation. Another hack for this week, x token that was hacked for $25 million. Then some news about NFT. So we're going to talk of crypto punk.
00:11:02.614 - 00:11:42.130, Speaker A: So there was a bundle of cryptopunk that was sold for $17 million in an auction of Christie's. So Christie's already did a couple of auction for NFT. So if you never heard of crypto punk, this is one of the first NFT project on the Ethereum blockchain. So back in 2017, there were tens of thousands of these characters that were given away for free. So cryptopunk looked like this. So at that time, nobody really cared and it got a little bit forgotten. But that was still a community that kept leaving for this crypto punk.
00:11:42.130 - 00:12:32.280, Speaker A: And recently with the NFT hype, basically NFT came back in the highlight. And so there was a vibrant community that suddenly got so interested in this crypto punk and their price went up like crazy and a lot of people forgot they had some crypto punk and all of a sudden some of them realized that they became millionaire. So yeah, the interest for crypto punk keeps being very strong. And the creator of the cryptopunk launched a new project called Midbits. And it basically looked like a sort of 3d version of cryptopunk. And so they already sold for $80 million of these nfts. So these guys are doing really well.
00:12:32.280 - 00:12:58.042, Speaker A: Then we have another NFt sale of Merriam Webster. So that's a dictionary. And they sold an NFT of the definition of NFT. So it's like an squared. Very, very smart. Okay, so next, some news from tether. So last week there was a new episode in the saga of Tether.
00:12:58.042 - 00:13:31.834, Speaker A: So Tether revealed the breakdown of its reserve for the first time. And it's really big deal because tether is the biggest stable coin in circulation with 57 billion outstanding. So it's really crucial that people keep trusting tether because otherwise we're going to see a giant wave of liquidation in DFI and it's going to get really, really ugly. So let's see, what are these reserve? There is a nice chart somewhere here. Okay. So we can see that they only have 3.87% in cash.
00:13:31.834 - 00:14:00.930, Speaker A: The rest is mostly short term debt. So we also call this money market instruments, to be more specific, these short term debt instruments, we have treasury bills. It's basically government bonds, reverse repo. So that one, it's a little bit like short term bonds. Also commercial paper. So this is the bulk of it. So commercial paper.
00:14:00.930 - 00:14:35.886, Speaker A: These are big companies that need some money for their treasury, maybe to pay, for example, to pay some salaries. But usually the maturity is very short, it's lower than one year. So these are usually very safe because the maturity is short. And the people who borrow with this bond are usually really big companies. So really, in this breakdown, nothing is very risky. But some people freaked out knowing that only 3.87% was in cash.
00:14:35.886 - 00:15:12.310, Speaker A: But you have to know that for large amounts, it's really normal to invest in something. You don't just keep cash, it's just called good treasury management. So we also do it in defi. For example, we start to have some dexes that invest their liquidity in lending protocols to increase the yield of liquidity providers. Also, you have to know that other stablecoins have not disclosed their reserve. So you cannot really compare tether to other centralized stablecoin at the moment, like USDC. So there wasn't any drop in the price of tethers.
00:15:12.310 - 00:15:57.334, Speaker A: That really show you that the majority of investors have no problem with the treasury of tether. So no panic, no problem. All right, so next, some news from binance. So binance is being investigated by the US Department of Justice and the RIS. So binance is famous for not accepting us customers, and they also recently hired some people, used to be regulators, to make sure that they are compliant with us law. So you might think that binance is low risk, but still it might not be enough. Actually, I have my conspiracy theory about this.
00:15:57.334 - 00:16:36.994, Speaker A: I already mentioned this before. So this is a conspiracy theory. Okay. I don't know if it's true, but it's not impossible. So basically there is something in the US which is called economic warfare, where basically the US government is suspected in some cases to launch some bogus investigation when you want to force some foreign company to sell to us companies. For example, the Astom, which is a french company. Astom was investigated a couple of years ago because of some supposed corruption of some of its executive.
00:16:36.994 - 00:17:12.290, Speaker A: And when the guy flew to the US, he was arrested. And for a couple of years he was in jail. And basically the thing they accused him of, it had absolutely no relationship with the US. And later we suspect that they did this to basically intimidate some top executive at Alstom and basically force them to sell to a general electric. And it's not the first time that this happened. It's already happened with some other companies. So since Coinbase just did the ipo, and now they have a lot of cash on their hand, they have more than 100 billion.
00:17:12.290 - 00:17:53.946, Speaker A: They could probably use that money to buy binance. So one possibility would be that the US government tried to intimidate binance, try to intimidate some of the executive, and basically do some secret deal. Tell them, look like we're going to stop all the investigation, but you have to sell to Coinbase. So of course, I have no privilege, no special insider information to justify this, but it wouldn't be impossible. It's not impossible at all. Okay, so then we're going to talk of bitcoin. So Elon Musk announced that Tesla will stop accepting payment in bitcoin.
00:17:53.946 - 00:18:44.270, Speaker A: The main reason is because of concerns over the energy consumption for bitcoin mining. Later, Elon Musk also suggested that Tesla might also sell its bitcoin holding. And it's really sent shock sways in the crypto community because so far, Elon Musk has been one of the most famous figure in the business world to support bitcoin. So that was really a big reason for the decrease not only of bitcoin, but of the whole crypto market, including Ethereum. So we don't need to stress too much about this. It was cool to have the support of Elon Musk for a while, but crypto was already doing well before Elon Musk was supportive, so we will do well without him. That's not a problem at all.
00:18:44.270 - 00:19:30.394, Speaker A: I'm not really worried. Next, some news about Dogecoin. So Elon Musk was very active on Twitter last week, and he proposed to do an upgrade to dogecoin to make it more efficient. His tweets, of course, sent dogecoin to the, you know, at this point. Okay, his tweets may move the markets now, but from now on, I don't really take him seriously anymore for crypto because I don't know if he's joking or if it just decided to become a troll. So, yeah, I wouldn't be too worried about what he says on crypto Twitter. Next, news of another cryptocurrency called the shipped tokens.
00:19:30.394 - 00:19:55.346, Speaker A: So this is a new crypto, which is described as a dodge killer. And Vitalig was airdropped half of the supply in a marketing stunt, even though he asked for nothing. So he gave some of it to a charity and for the rest, which was about $6 billion, he burned it. Yes. That means he burned $6 billion just to show that it's worth less. Wow. Just wow.
00:19:55.346 - 00:20:32.590, Speaker A: How many people would have done this? Like, you know, you can have $6 billion for free and no, you don't take it. Well, in reality, he probably wouldn't be able to sell for 6 billion because if he did this, since he had 50% of the supply, he would have really killed the market. But still, he lost a lot of money and he did it just because he didn't believe in this token. So, yeah, it's really commendable. Okay, so next, some news for developer. We're going to talk of Inferra and truffle. So Inferra and truffle now support polygon.
00:20:32.590 - 00:21:32.760, Speaker A: So polygon, if you never heard what it is, it's a sidechain of ethereum, and we're going to see a lot of defi projects that move there because it has lower transaction fee. So it's probably time for some polygon tutorial on my channel because now we have all the development tools that support it. So, yeah, probably going to do some tutorial about this. Okay, so next, some news about alchemy, which is an API for Ethereum developer. So they created a new API for historical token transfer. So I quote the article, imagine if there was a method that could answer how much Ether sushi USDT has Vitalik buttering sent to Elon Musk? Well, with Alchemy transfer API, now you can do this in a single API call, you can fetch historical transactions for any address and any token without having to scan the entire chain for each of your users. So that's huge.
00:21:32.760 - 00:22:05.200, Speaker A: That's really very convenient because scanning the whole blockchain, if you want to know the whole transfer amount, is not very easy. Then some news from ETh Global. So there is an upcoming hackathon for DeFi in June. So Hackathon are really a great way to get noticed. Find a job, find funding if you want to launch your own project. And I published an interview of a team who won an NFT hackathon a couple of weeks ago. So if you want some inspiration, check it out.
00:22:05.200 - 00:22:41.686, Speaker A: It's not for total beginner. I don't recommend hackathon to people who are just getting started because in a hackathon you will be in a team with other developers who are not total beginners. So if you're beginners, you're going to slow down everybody. So yeah, first do some tutorials on my channel, for example. And in a few months when you feel you are better, then you can go participate for some hackathon. And finally, Steeler is global. So there were another hackathon for scaling Ethereum and they've announced the twelve finalist.
00:22:41.686 - 00:23:15.782, Speaker A: So if you are really into scaling, and scaling is super important, check out the name of this project because we might hear about them more in the future. All right, so back to the question. I'm going to do the Q and a now. Yeah. Quickly back to my free training for how to become a professional blockchain developer. If you are new here and you wonder how you can become a professional blockchain developer and find your first blockchain job, take this training. It's free.
00:23:15.782 - 00:23:32.426, Speaker A: I put the link in the chat. Okay, so I scroll up in the chat. Wow, we have a lot of activity today. This is amazing. Okay, so let me start from the beginning. Okay, so flip the coin. Hi man.
00:23:32.426 - 00:23:54.270, Speaker A: We have Dan. Oh yeah. Okay, so Dan, the guy is very important. We have a new member in my team, also Dan Biton in the chat. So probably we'll do another video to introduce him. But as I mentioned recently, I'm hiring some teacher to do some blockchain course on it. The blocks.
00:23:54.270 - 00:24:20.918, Speaker A: And so Dan, he's the guy who. So you're probably going to hear about Dan more in the future. Okay, so who else do we have? So we have plv, we have HZ. Hello from Austria. We have Batman, we have Jules Tshx. Okay, amazing. Vanny.
00:24:20.918 - 00:24:55.750, Speaker A: What could be nice could be a way to delegate voting power to representative or a delegate of some sort. You mean for the voting system of eat the blocks, you mean? I think that's what you mean. Interesting concept. So at the beginning I'm just going to do it simple where you just vote directly, but after, maybe we could have a system like this. Okay, I see some German in the chat today. We have some friend from Germany. We have Hugo Chavez in the chat.
00:24:55.750 - 00:25:18.978, Speaker A: Tshx. Did you know that Tesla stopped accepting? Yes, yes, but I'm not too worried about mean. Bitcoin was never really supposed to be used as payment. It's more store value anyway. Yeah, I didn't know Abracadabra is german. I didn't know that. All right, Dixon Fado.
00:25:18.978 - 00:25:44.834, Speaker A: Why does Tesla accepted of bitcoin even matter? Yes, exactly. It's not like bitcoin was made to just buy Tesla. People are still so uneducated about this. Dodge coin will be replacing bitcoin on the Tesla side. Maybe Dixon doesn't chain link. Oracle already provide that functionality. It allow you to query for prices on the blockchain.
00:25:44.834 - 00:26:39.414, Speaker A: Yes, but the chain links are not very easy to use, so I think Vitalik here suggests a more simple alternative that might be enough for a simple use case. Abracadabra. Question for julian. Man, aren't you bored of getting all the bear market message from people who never saw bear market? Yeah, I'm used to it now. I just don't react too much when people tell me, do you think it's the end of crypto, blah blah blah. Personally, I don't really try to time the market. It's okay if there is a top and I miss it and then there is a crash and I don't sell my token, it's okay because I'm in this in the long term and so I can sell some of my token in the next bull run.
00:26:39.414 - 00:27:08.554, Speaker A: I don't need to sell in this one. So, yeah, I'm really in this in the long term so I'm not too stressed if there is a crash in the near future. And I really encourage you guys to be in blockchain, really for the long term, that's how you're going to really benefit from it. Okay, Dixon. ThX, this elon is such a troll. Check his tweet from yesterday. Yeah, at this point it became a troll.
00:27:08.554 - 00:27:29.202, Speaker A: Totally agree. Mohamed, what do you think of Cardano? Nothing special. It's too little, too late. Yeah. Just nothing special. No. What do we have? Christopher just flew my first live stream.
00:27:29.202 - 00:27:44.678, Speaker A: Great to be here. Yes, welcome, Christopher. Interstellar said, don't sell your soul. Solana. Yeah, I just started to check the documentation of Solana. It seems complicated. Seems complicated.
00:27:44.678 - 00:28:14.582, Speaker A: I'll probably do a tutorial on it at some point, but yeah, I don't see Solana taking off like other blockchain. Clearly not with a smart contract in rust. No way. All right. Okay. I need to improve my german game because there is a lot of german tonight in the chat. Lyosha, what's happening with optimism? Does anyone know? I don't think there was any special news this week.
00:28:14.582 - 00:28:36.706, Speaker A: They are doing fine. It's one of the leading sidechain for Ethereum with Polygon. But now really, the number one that we hear the most about is polygon. And by the way, I think the Matic token is going to go to the moon. Amazing. Vanny. Many centralized exchange investors use the crypto but apparently lack tight risk management, to put it mildly.
00:28:36.706 - 00:29:22.646, Speaker A: Yeah, it's very possible. Mike Amiri, dap dev job. What do you mean? Do you have a question more specific? If you check the last video on my channel, I interview the founder of Crypto Job list, which is the top job list in crypto. So if you want to find more info about blockchain dev job, check out this video. My cryptotv. Are the current fees on Ethereum going to make you flee to another blockchain? So the token of it, the blocks, was deployed on binance smart chain because of the transaction fee problem. But in the future we might move this token back to Ethereum or to a side chain.
00:29:22.646 - 00:30:10.406, Speaker A: Yeah, but I just wanted to make it simple and choose binance smart chain. Then what else do we have? Anton, hey, what's your opinion on balancer technology? How does it compare to other popular defi's? Yeah, it's one of the most advanced decentralized exchange a contrary to many other Defi projects. They're doing some true innovation, which is great. Basically, balancer can be used if you want to do something complex. If you want something more simple. Uniswap is probably better, but it has a lot of potential, especially with the v two. Yeah, I think right now it's uniswap number one, sushi swap number two on Ethereum.
00:30:10.406 - 00:30:40.260, Speaker A: But I think in the future balancer is going to replace sushi swap. Then what do we have? What do we have? What do we have? I lost myself in the chat. I lost myself in the chat. 1 second, guys. 1 second guy. I need to get back on track. To get back on track.
00:30:40.260 - 00:31:14.618, Speaker A: 1 second. Okay, is there any good layer to project apart from polygon? Yeah. Optimism. Xdai, what else? Yeah, these are the main one. What is the point of maker coin? It's just for governing die. Yeah, it's also used in the stablecoin system. It's basically if there is a depegging relative to dollars, some of it can be created or minted or burned.
00:31:14.618 - 00:31:41.606, Speaker A: So yeah, it's also used in the pegging mechanism. Okay, I'm having some trouble saying your name. Sorry. Indy Rajit. When Ethereum will recover. I mean, come on, we just started to have a dive, so maybe the dive will continue for another week or two and then it will be back up. But yeah.
00:31:41.606 - 00:31:56.300, Speaker A: It's too soon to say, but yeah, long term, I'm not worried. Zishan, can you please make a video? How ethereum l two scalability work like polygon. Matic harmony. One. Yeah, polygon. I'll probably do it. Yeah.
00:31:56.300 - 00:32:20.660, Speaker A: Abracadabra, saying Elrond. I'm not sure if they have anything special, really. Elton. Okay. No, this is in German. I can read this. Dan Biton saying hi to everybody.
00:32:20.660 - 00:32:59.334, Speaker A: Happy to be part of this great adventure. Yes, and very happy to have you in the team, Dan. Anton, what do you think of synthetics project? Yeah, it's a very important project. Especially recently, it was used to bring some off chain assets into Ethereum. Especially we had Wall Street Dap that was launched on Ethereum. It's basically a decentralized investment fund, but for stocks, not for onchain assets. And the only way to do this was to use synthetics assets.
00:32:59.334 - 00:33:26.890, Speaker A: That's basically token that track the price of some stocks. And this was done through synthetics. So very important project to bring traditional finance into the blockchain. And also for derivatives. Synthetics is very important. Fish fat saying made my first binance martian token last night, thanks to you. Cheers.
00:33:26.890 - 00:33:49.200, Speaker A: Great. We have Hugo Chavez in the chat. Yes, absolutely. Hz there is the Ethereum apprenticeship. I don't know what is else. What else do we have? Dixon? It's never the end of crypto. Yes, exactly.
00:33:49.200 - 00:34:36.480, Speaker A: Crypto always comes back stronger. Like how many times in the past we had naysayer, like negative people, the media, et cetera, saying, oh, that's the end. Okay, bitcoin -90% in 2013, we had some crazy crash like this. And in the end, crypto always came back stronger, a little bit less volatile than before, with more user, more money, et cetera. So, yeah, now crypto is never going to die. Amaz is asking, how much time do I need to become an experienced blockchain developer? Well, it depends on your background, but I would say if you are already a web dev, probably in a few months. Otherwise it can be six months or a bit more.
00:34:36.480 - 00:34:58.920, Speaker A: Yeah, but for most people, a few months is enough. All right, abracadabra. Question for Julian. Did you notice that Vitalik gave back the Shiba token to the dev of Shiba? Actually, I mentioned this. I think he burned the token, which means. Yeah, he just basically put the coin to the trash. Basically.
00:34:58.920 - 00:35:46.840, Speaker A: Question for Julian, any bullish news which could drive the price? Very, very good question. Well, the bullish news will be when we start to have some big deFi project on Ethereum that have some traction on either optimism or polygon. And this is going to happen this summer. I think this is going to be a big one. Other than that, for more general news, probably around this summer, we're expecting one of the first bitcoin ETF to be approved. So that's going to be a really big one. What else do we have? We have inflation going up.
00:35:46.840 - 00:36:34.740, Speaker A: The inflation in the US this year is expected to be 3.5%. So probably we're going to see some money going from Fiat to crypto, because more and more investors start to realize that the value of their fiat is going down a lot this year because of inflation. So I think inflation is good for crypto. Jill saying when the blockchain security course would be available. Yes, good question. So, yeah, maybe next month. Actually, it will probably not be a full course, but it's probably going to be a live training because we are going to launch a series of live training.
00:36:34.740 - 00:37:17.970, Speaker A: It's going to be 1 hour live stream where either me or other teacher teach something very specific. And at the end there is A-Q-A. Except this is not going to be on YouTube, this is going to be on in the blogs. And so I think one of these livestream will be about blockchain security. Then what do we have? Julian, can you provide some liquidity for utokian? Yes, good question. So first I will focus on the voting DAP. Basically the DAO.
00:37:17.970 - 00:37:42.570, Speaker A: I hope to put it online this week. After that I will take care of the probably next step will be staking. And after that, probably we can start to look at the liquidity. But first, I want to focus really on the utility of the token. Abracadabra balancer is cool because you don't have to pull only two tokens. You can pull max eight. Not sure how many.
00:37:42.570 - 00:38:18.598, Speaker A: Yes. So actually the Wall street bet DaP is implemented with a balancer pool. So that's why they have eight stocks in their index, because this is the max of balancer. Joseph, I can't claim my ETB token with the address I provided any help here, so you can send an email at julian@indoblocks.com and I will see what I can do. Mike saying do a blockchain security course. Yes, we will do this.
00:38:18.598 - 00:38:56.850, Speaker A: Abracadabra. The Elrond was related to the macro dao. Elrond, Katizi and more are under direct control of the macro dao. Not just that. Okay, I didn't know that. Okay, so now I want to do some more research on that fish fat. Any place to volunteer to help a project? I'm new to the dev space and I want to learn more, so it's a bit difficult to answer you in general, but basically check out the new DeFi project that are being created and if you're like one of them, you start to hang out in their community and start to ask if you can do anything and most likely they will have some task.
00:38:56.850 - 00:39:43.810, Speaker A: Doesn't matter if you want to do some code, if you want to help with the marketing in general, they are more than happy to have a volunteer and this can actually end up in a real job, even if this is a fully decentralized project. Chocolate salty balls doesn't binance make synthetics redundant as they are doing the same thing and bigger player in the game? No, because Binance is. Do you mean binance the exchange or binance smart chain? Binance. The exchange is centralized. Even binance smart chain. This is also centralized so they can do a centralized alternative. But this is going to appeal to some user who don't care so much about decentralization.
00:39:43.810 - 00:40:32.770, Speaker A: But synthetics is the real deal because this is decentralized. Abracadabra. Question for Julian, any news about ETF for bitcoin or ETH in USA? I just know that last week there was a new application for an ETF for ether. And I also know that the SEC is supposed to answer in the next two months for some of the ongoing application. So we're going to have some more info about this very soon. And if this is positive, it's going to be bigger than the tweet of elon Musk. I can tell you that phone boost, if you can choose only one token to put $5,000 on it, would be matic.
00:40:32.770 - 00:41:04.330, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. Which now has been rebranded into polygon. Chocolate is saying Canada has bitcoin ETF. Yes. So it's good to put some pressure on Wall street. What do we have? What do we have? I own BTC ETF in Canada, so I don't pay taxes on my. Good, very good, very smart.
00:41:04.330 - 00:41:33.182, Speaker A: Lyosha, what is your backup in case Ethereum fails? For whatever reason? I really don't think it will fail. And even if Ethereum the network would fail, Ethereum the technology would prevail. Because really you have so many copycat of Ethereum that use the technology of Ethereum. So I think the technology itself cannot fail. No way. Then. Whoa.
00:41:33.182 - 00:41:52.646, Speaker A: You know Wall street dap. The yield there is just insane. Oh, really? Oh, I should have bought some. Vic told you. Hi. Do you offer monthly subscription plan to access your courses on blocks? No, I used to a long time ago, but it's not the case anymore. Yeah, you see, x token was exploded by flash loan.
00:41:52.646 - 00:42:19.138, Speaker A: X token going to reimburse? Maybe. Oh, interesting. We see more and more of this protocol. Who reimburse the hack then? Abracadabra. Question for Julian, man, do you think about Certik? Seems like they are approving weird project. I don't have any opinion about them. Yeah, I just know there are many security companies, some of the most reputable one.
00:42:19.138 - 00:42:53.130, Speaker A: For example, you have open zeppelin, I think consensus. Also they have one certic. I don't think they are among the most famous. Yeah. Do you advise companies and help and launch their token? We are launching soon a utility token, so I might do it in the future. Currently I don't do it. Do you have any videos or classes on defi strategy? Way to calculate API.
00:42:53.130 - 00:43:08.354, Speaker A: Okay, so I have a video on how to calculate APY on the channel. And I have a course on Defi. It's called Defi mastery. Yeah, Batman. Smash that like button, everyone. Thanks, Batman. May I? Hello.
00:43:08.354 - 00:43:47.322, Speaker A: I randomly find you in my recommendation. Yeah, you have a very good recommendation, HD. Can I start the 3d course with no previous programming experience? Or should I learn Java or Python first? I think you are talking of my course six figure blockchain developers. So if you take the jumpstarter package, there was an add on on web development for people who are total newbies. So I recommend to take this. And even with no programming experience, you can make it. What else? Yuvraj.
00:43:47.322 - 00:44:22.860, Speaker A: Hey, Julian, the heck is happening with Ethereum right now? Yeah, don't panic. It's mostly related to the crazy tweet of Elon Musk. So it's fine. It can keep crashing. You know, this is crypto like minus 1020 -30% even -40% who cares? I'm not selling. Okay? I am not selling. Anton, do you think to start making DAP reviews from your subscriber to provide some feedback, good practice, et cetera? I haven't thought about it.
00:44:22.860 - 00:44:47.086, Speaker A: Yeah, why not? Why not? Yeah, I need to think about it. But I like the idea. Very good idea. Marcena. Hey, Julian, what would be your comments about that stack for that react plus typescript plus redux. Okay, so redux. I think with some recent updates to react, I think it's less used now because now a lot of the state management is being done in react.
00:44:47.086 - 00:45:17.370, Speaker A: Typescript, if you are doing really a big project and you know what you're doing, you can use it. But if this is a quick prototype and maybe you don't know typescript this much, careful, because typescript can really slow you down. Yeah. So it really depends on your context. What else? Thx, did you know that hackathon website hack money reminds me of the. It's their theme. Yeah, I love that design.
00:45:17.370 - 00:45:36.782, Speaker A: Really good design. Abracadabra, HB token to the moon. Yes. Hey, mosquito boat. Hey, do you think x sigma has potential? Never heard of it. Mosquito balls. It's defi backed by Nasdaq company will host NFT marketplace.
00:45:36.782 - 00:46:06.294, Speaker A: Okay, no, I need to do some research. The real J's and C Julian, don't sell. Yes, I don't sell. Kira and code. I am an experienced full stack developer with experience in Java and JavaScript. Is it a good idea to change from web development to blockchain developer? Please suggest. Yeah, because web development is much more generalist and as a web developer you'll be doing fine, but you'll be more of a commodity.
00:46:06.294 - 00:47:02.014, Speaker A: There is a clear market price for web development and there are like a ton of developers on the market already. Whereas for blockchain development it's much more specific. The number of blockchain developer is much smaller and at the same time the demand is very high. So that's why the salary are much higher. In terms of salary, the kind of salary you can have as a blockchain developer are at least 20 30% above what you would get as a web developer, and even more if you start to specialize as a security specialist or as a defi specialist. So yeah, if you want to improve your career, that's clear that I recommend blockchain. Also, at a personal level, I think it's much more exciting to be building the financial system of the future instead of just working on the web in general.
00:47:02.014 - 00:47:17.006, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Dixon saying never sell. Take it to the. Exactly. Abrahcadaba will cut this part. I'm not selling.
00:47:17.006 - 00:48:02.174, Speaker A: And make a meme. Yes, exactly. Ical misimo. Monero sounds like a good project, but for some reason, the price and market cap are still pretty low. Did I miss something? I mean, Monero is a great project for privacy coins, but I think a couple of months ago, there was a wave of exchanges that started to unlist Monero because a lot of government were very against it because this is so private that it's really targeted by government who don't want criminals to use it. So Monero, I think in terms of regulatory risk, I would say it's pretty high. Also, they don't have smart contract capability.
00:48:02.174 - 00:48:31.434, Speaker A: So they basically help to develop some interesting ideas for privacy on the blockchain. But I don't think that they have a lot of potential in terms of user base. Yeah. Alex Lynn, Safemoon thought. Lol. Yeah, so I'm going to do a live training on Safemoon as actually, it's going to be next week, next Tuesday, I'm going to announce this to people who are on my mailing list. Yeah.
00:48:31.434 - 00:48:53.602, Speaker A: So I'm going to do a live training for how to create a token that's going to be a clone of safemoon. Laosha, thanks for the great stream, as usual. Yeah, my pleasure, folks. Raymond. Hey, man. Julian, do you know the Excel platform? I don't know. Kadia, do you think that market is overflowed by new coins? What is the best strategy to be successful if you create new coins? Wow.
00:48:53.602 - 00:49:14.366, Speaker A: It's a very difficult question. Yeah, there is a lot of new coin that are just copy paste of others. So the best is you can be inspired by some existing coin, but ideally you want to bring something new. Yeah, that's for sure. Abracadabra. Thanks for the stream, Julian. Viva la eat the blocks.
00:49:14.366 - 00:49:20.074, Speaker A: Yes. Thanks. Abracadabra. Rezaga. Hello, sir. I'm your fan from Indonesia. Awesome.
00:49:20.074 - 00:49:28.446, Speaker A: Welcome. Mosquito balls. X Sigma is an all time low. Highest price was $88. Nice one. Dollars. Wow.
00:49:28.446 - 00:49:45.138, Speaker A: Doesn't seem too great. Dixon, did you get a chance to check sunswap? No, I did not. F one. F. One. Hi, all. Is there a blockchain developer wanting to join a crypto project? Feel free to contact.
00:49:45.138 - 00:50:14.950, Speaker A: Okay, so if you want to find some employee, some partner, some volunteer, you can ask in the Facebook group of it the blocks. You find the link in the header of the channel. Mosquito post. I think the market is overloaded with new coin that's the reason for ETH crashing altcoin season everybody and buy new coin with ETH and BNC. Yeah, I don't think this is the end of the bull market. I really don't think so. Ryan Rodriguez pretty new to blockchain.
00:50:14.950 - 00:50:50.110, Speaker A: Where can I start with blockchain development? Have good experience with Java react so you can take my free training. It will explain you what you need to learn to become a blockchain developer. I put the link in the chat safemoon cash. Yeah, I will do a live training on safemoon. Marsona I'm a new but I'm not surprised to see that state is managed within react only today. Okay, it's a technical question. It's annoying to handle it among multiple deep components.
00:50:50.110 - 00:51:12.150, Speaker A: Thanks a lot for your feedback. Yeah, no problem. All right, guys, I think we are reaching the end of the stream. That was great to see so much activity in the chat today and yeah, guys, so have a great week and I will see you later on the channel. Have a great week. Bye guys. Bye.
