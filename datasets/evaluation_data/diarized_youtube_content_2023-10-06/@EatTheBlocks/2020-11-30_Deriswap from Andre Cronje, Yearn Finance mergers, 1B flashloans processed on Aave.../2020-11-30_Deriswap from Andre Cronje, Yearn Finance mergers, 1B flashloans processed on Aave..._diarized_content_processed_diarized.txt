00:00:08.610 - 00:00:47.040, Speaker A: And we are live. Hi guys, welcome for this weekly stream on the latest news of Ethereum and Defi. I am Julian, your host. Today what we are going to talk about, first of all, for those who are new to this, so I do this every Monday at 10:00 a.m. East coast time. So in this video we will talk of Andre Cronrey because there are a lot of news of the project of Andre Conray. We're going to talk of Ethereum 2.0
00:00:47.040 - 00:01:30.894, Speaker A: and many, many other stuff. There are a lot of news this week, super important and also we'll do the q and A at the end as usual. So if you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host, and on my channel blocks I teach blockchain development and how to find your first blockchain job. And quick reminder, this is the last day to take the lifetime all access pass of blocks. So with the lifetime pass you get access to all my blockchain courses, both for the courses that already exist and the one that will be released in the future. So you pay a one time fee and you keep access to all the course forever. I launched this for Black Friday last week and today is the last day to get it.
00:01:30.894 - 00:02:10.154, Speaker A: So you have until today at midnight UTC and after it won't be available for enrollment anymore. The reason why I have to limit the enrollment is because there is a live teaching component. So I have to make sure that not too many people sign up, otherwise the class will be too big. So hi to everybody in the chat. Hi Thx, hi Abrahadabra, hi George, Cyril, Jill, super cool to see you. So we're going to start today with the price of ether as usual. So us was very flat this week.
00:02:10.154 - 00:02:44.962, Speaker A: The week before we had a big increase with the deadline for the deposit contract of Ethereum 2.0. So there was a lot of excitement and after the excitement fell back a little bit. So it's possible that some wealth decided to dump some ETh on the market to accumulate more ETH. So don't be scared because clearly with ETH 2.0 launching next month, the fundamentals are very good for Ethereum. So everything is fine. Okay, so now let's see the gas prices.
00:02:44.962 - 00:03:10.014, Speaker A: So gas prices are pretty flat. So we do have a spike that happened last week. It's the first spike since a while. So yeah, I mean very stable here. So next we're going to talk of the situation on Ethereum 2.0. So Ethereum 2.0, the next version of Ethereum is coming next week.
00:03:10.014 - 00:03:47.420, Speaker A: So last week, last week on November 24, there was a very important deadline, so we needed to stake 524,000 something ether in the deposit contract in order for Ethereum 2.0 to launch. If we missed that deadline, that means that Ethereum 2.0 would have been delayed. But we met that deadline. So you can see the total stake is 850,000 something. So we are way above the minimum required to start Ethereum 2.0.
00:03:47.420 - 00:04:17.010, Speaker A: So of course that was very huge relief for the community, because before that, the deposits were a bit slow. Some people were afraid that this wouldn't launch, but finally it launched. Basically, the deposit really accelerated in the last run. So you can still become a validator. This is really a big misconception. A lot of people think that now it's too late. No, basically 524,000 was just the minimum that we needed to meet.
00:04:17.010 - 00:05:02.878, Speaker A: But of course, now you can still register to become a validator. And if you're interested in this, check out my video on this. I think one or two weeks ago I released a video for how to become a validator on Ethereum 2.0. The big question is how much we can earn, because once you lock your 32 e, this is locked for a few years. So it better make money. So it does make money when you lock your ether and you are validator. So if you want to know how much exactly, so you can check out this website, launchpad Ethereum, and it gives you a curve with the interest rate you will get according to the total ether that is staked.
00:05:02.878 - 00:05:54.274, Speaker A: So currently we are here, so we are at about 17%. So still a very healthy rate. But as we're going to get more and more eth stake, it's going to go down. So just to give you some overview here, so on this chart you can see it goes up to 10 million, and after it sort of plateau, it kind of stop at around about 5%. Yeah, 4.9. So in total we have 113,000,000 of ether in circulation. So realistically, what's the percentage of this that can be staked? Yeah, I don't think we're going to get more than five or 10% of all the ether stake, and it's probably going to take some time before we reach that level.
00:05:54.274 - 00:06:27.486, Speaker A: So, yeah, that can give you some idea of how much you will gain. Okay, so next we're going to go, of course, Ethereum 2.0, start tomorrow, December 1. That's the Genesis block. Okay, so next on the defi market. So this week we have slightly less than last week. So here it went up because the price of ether went up.
00:06:27.486 - 00:07:08.682, Speaker A: But if we change to ether we can see that actually we keep losing ether that are locked in defi. So I don't really like to see this train, but that's life. Like sometime the market goes down. This is not the end of the world. Next let's see the rates a little bit. So how much money can we earn? Reese rate so what I like rezrate is this is one of the easiest way to use Defi. So if you're a beginner, what you can do is use your stablecoin and lend them on some protocol like duidx, avia or compound so you can get some really nice rate.
00:07:08.682 - 00:07:38.242, Speaker A: Like for example die on ave 5% DYDX 528 USDC 6.26 it's pretty nice. Yeah, almost like 5% here for tether on Ave. Keep in mind that this is basically a variable rate. So it doesn't mean that you are going to lock this rate for the whole year. But it changed all the time. Okay, so next let's see the defi tokens.
00:07:38.242 - 00:08:11.802, Speaker A: So we have a lot of green this week. If you see here the seven day performance, we have some really nice performance. We have a cream token like 32%. We have pickle here. So I will explain what happened for pickle and cream. What else? Orion protocol. So this is a d five project that it's a sort of aggregator of Dexes but across blockchain.
00:08:11.802 - 00:08:37.650, Speaker A: And it is also an aggregator of centralized exchange. So this is sort of the ultimate aggregator that gets liquidity from everywhere. So a very ambitious token. For the second week straight we have I eth which is performing like crazy. But that's super weird because I eth is inverted ether. So ether now is going up. So inverted ETH should go down.
00:08:37.650 - 00:09:06.738, Speaker A: So I really don't understand. Maybe there is a mistake on coin Gecko because if you look at the chart it's not like 600% at all. So yeah, it seems like there is a bug here in coin gecko. And for the loser, let me see. Saffron finance. So it was way up last week because there was some news on the coin market cap. So the project went up like crazy.
00:09:06.738 - 00:09:28.326, Speaker A: But after the initial hype it falled down. But it's normal. I think Saffron finance is a very serious project. We have a BZX here which is not doing great. And do we have any famous token? Yes, surf finance. So let's say fork of a protocol balancer wifi. Yeah.
00:09:28.326 - 00:10:08.654, Speaker A: So, yeah, curve. But all in all, we have more green than red this. So after I'm going to explain, we're going to do a zoom on cream and pico because there are some important news this week. Okay, so next we're going to switch to the news about DeFi project. So first there is swap, which is the latest project of Andre Conray. So basically, with this project, Andre Conray wants to combine swap features, option and loans in a single project. So to be clear, in defi we use the word swap to mean exchange tokens against another one.
00:10:08.654 - 00:10:54.690, Speaker A: But you have to know that in traditional finance, it means something totally different related to rates. So if you're a finance guy, don't be confused when you see swap in DeFi. So the motivation for this project is to optimize the use of liquidity. So in this article on his medium, Andre explained why he thinks that swap futures, option and loans are related and what kind of synergy we can have by putting them in the same spot contracts. To be fair, it requires some advanced knowledge in trading to fully understand what he's trying to do here, especially in the field of options, which is something quite difficult. So it's a very experimental project. So be very careful if you want to invest in this.
00:10:54.690 - 00:11:20.894, Speaker A: If the experiment is successful, it really has the potential to revolutionize most deFi products, to be honest. But I'm actually a bit skeptical because it just seems a little bit too complex. I'm a bit skeptical, but in DeFi we have the right to do experiment. We should do experiment. So, yeah, let's let Andre do its experiment. Let's see how it goes. Then.
00:11:20.894 - 00:12:02.214, Speaker A: We have some news of merger and acquisition in DeFi. So it's the first time that we have that sort of news. So basically, yearn finance is going to merge with Pico Finance. So Yearn and Pico are both yield aggregators. So you send your tokens and the protocol invest the token in other DeFi protocols to make you more. So both of these projects are similar and they're going to merge. So when there is a merger between two companies, in general, the bigger company absorb the smaller one.
00:12:02.214 - 00:12:46.850, Speaker A: So the total value locked of yarn finance is 433,000,000 and for pickle is 31 million. And also yearn finance is the protocol of Andre Conrey, which is a developer with an awesome track record in the DFI ecosystem with many project. Pickle, on the other hand, doesn't have such a great track record and was hacked of 20 million very recently. So it only makes sense that it's yarn finance that absorb pickle and not the other way around. So the price of the pickle token went up a lot after this announcement. However, the price of yarn finance went down a bit. So you have to know that it's always like this during a merger.
00:12:46.850 - 00:13:23.778, Speaker A: The price of the share of the acquirer goes down a little bit and the price of the share of the acquired company goes up. It's always like this. So the actual merger will occur when Yearn V two launches, which is still currently under development. And the developers of Pico will keep working on the project by building some strategies for Yearn V two. So they will use the core infrastructure of year in order to build their strategy. And they will earn a 10% performance fee. So if their strategy makes money, they make money.
00:13:23.778 - 00:13:54.250, Speaker A: If it doesn't make money, they don't earn anything. And there are also a couple of features that are designed to pay back the victims of the recent hack of people. Okay, so that's the first merger of the week. So then second merger of the week still involving yearn finance. So this time, yearn finance and cream finance. So cream finance is a lending protocol like Kompan. So Yern Lp token can be used as a collateral in cream after this merger.
00:13:54.250 - 00:14:32.902, Speaker A: So this will increase the liquidity of cream finance and in return, yen strategies will get access to leverage through cream, which can potentially increase the yield of vault on yarn finance. So this was announced on November 26, and at that time it made the price of the cream token go up a lot. Then another merger still with Yen Finance. This is really crazy. So with the COVID protocol. So cover is a protocol for DeFi insurance. So at the center of the COVID protocol is a token called claim.
00:14:32.902 - 00:15:10.050, Speaker A: So with the merger, claim can become a borrowable asset for yern and cover can provide better security by providing some coverage to Yern vault. So again, there will be some synergies here. So that's it for the mergers of the wig. That is really a lot. Then there is an integration of yearn finance with the argent wallet. So argent is one of the leading Ethereum wallets, especially on mobile. So they use an architecture called smart contract wallets, which allow them to be a non custodial wallet.
00:15:10.050 - 00:15:42.400, Speaker A: If you never heard of what's a smart contract wallet, you can check my channel. I have a video about this. So with this integration, you will be able to invest in Yern finance vault directly from your argent wallet. So it's going to bring more liquidity to yern finance. So I'd like to do a little reflection on all these mergers. So I'm really glad to see Andre partnering with other projects. Seems like he start to understand that he cannot do everything on his own.
00:15:42.400 - 00:16:30.238, Speaker A: Still, that's really a lot of partnership announced very quickly. It feels a little bit messy to me, so I would still prefer that Andre focuses on one partnership at a time. There is difference between just building a project like a developer and actually turning it into a product. And it seems like Andre is a great builder, but so far I haven't seen anything that show that he can be a great entrepreneur, that he can actually productize the project he works on. So, yeah, that's my impression at the moment. But regardless of his skills as an entrepreneur, I've been thinking something else about Andre Crone. So whatever he does always have an impact on the market.
00:16:30.238 - 00:17:20.318, Speaker A: So it could be interesting to build a sort of crypto fund just based on what he publishes on Twitter or on his medium. So you need to react really quickly and I don't think it's possible to build some AI smart enough to figure out what to do. So the way it could work is if you create a team of, like, I don't know, three or four people with different shifts. So there is always somebody awake monitoring the news of Andre Conray. And so these guys will have some alert in place, some automatic alert, and as soon as Andre says something on any social media, so right away you analyze what he says and if it has potential impact on your token, then you buy the token very quickly, you keep it a few hours and then you sell it after the hype goes down. So I know it sounds kind of crazy, but it can totally work. Yeah.
00:17:20.318 - 00:17:42.600, Speaker A: Pretty sure about this. Yeah, but this is a crazy idea. Okay, so then next news about agnosis. What is gnosis? Agnosis is a prediction market. So it allow you to create any sort of bet. But on the blockchain. I actually have a video on my channel if you're interested.
00:17:42.600 - 00:18:27.646, Speaker A: This is pretty interesting project, but also quite complex in terms of smart contract. And so this week they announced that they are going to decentralize their governance by releasing a DAO. So the governance will be done on a smart contract. And so that's why the price of the gnosis token went up so much this week. Then next news Ave reached a big milestone for flash loan. So they've processed over 1 billion in flash loan since they launched in January. So now we hear more and more about flash loan, but for the newbies, you have to know that Ave, this is the protocol that first introduced flash loan.
00:18:27.646 - 00:19:05.758, Speaker A: They introduced the id. So if you don't know, what's the flash loan? So, very briefly, this is a way to borrow a lot of money on the blockchain without any collateral. And you can use this money to earn more money by doing, for example, arbitrage or liquidations. A question that comes back a lot is how much you can earn with flash loan. Well, there is this article about liquidations. So a lot of this liquidation, they use flash loan, actually. And so here you can see what were the profit of liquidation from 2018 to January 2020.
00:19:05.758 - 00:19:51.806, Speaker A: And so here you can see that we are talking of hundred of thousands of dollars. So it's about like 50 to 100 people who are running this boat in a profitable manner, and here's the profit that they are making. So flash loans are always like a fascinating topic for newbies all the time still about flash loans. So there is this new project called Flashboat. So this is a sort of open source boat for liquidation and front running. So they want to democratize flash loans, liquidation front running with flash loans, so that no privileged entity can get all the rewards. So they will make this available to everybody.
00:19:51.806 - 00:20:33.626, Speaker A: And so in the future, you can use the open source software to find more opportunity. So it's quite complementary with Keeper, which is a project released by Andre Conray to create a marketplace of liquidators. So we'll see how far they go then. So there was a big event that happened on the DAi market. So a lot of liquidation on the compound protocol. So compound protocol, this is a protocol to borrow and lend crypto. And the way it works is you have to provide a collateral, and if a collateral falls below a student's threshold, anybody has the right to reimburse your loan, and that person gets a bonus.
00:20:33.626 - 00:21:06.850, Speaker A: So that's what we call a liquidation. So compound uses the oracle of Coinbase to get the price of DAI. But the price of DaI on Coinbase moved a lot at some point last week. So it actually triggered a lot of liquidation on compound. And a lot of people who borrowed money, they lost money because of this. So they're quite angry. So here you have the CEO of Kampan, which explained different fixes.
00:21:06.850 - 00:21:47.566, Speaker A: So first, maybe it could be modifying the market parameter for Dai, like the borrowing cap, for example, and also some other ways to modify the oracle so that it's not so sensitive to coinbase. Yeah. So here with events like this, you can see that with Oracle, we are still a lot of progress to do. We still have some accident like this. It's not perfect, doesn't work 100% of the time. Then in news about filecoin. So filecoin is going to offer wrapped file coins.
00:21:47.566 - 00:22:31.422, Speaker A: So first of all, what is filecoins? Filecoin is building a decentralized storage network on top of ipfs, which is itself a decentralized file system. So it's basically way that allow you to share your file, but in a decentralized way. So Filecoin launched a couple of months ago after many delay. And one key part of the system is the fil token that allow you to pay for storage space in the network. So Anchorage, which is a crypto custody provider, is partnering with Tokensoft to tokenize fil token. So the token of Falcon, and this will be done on Ethereum. So it will be similar to wrap bitcoin.
00:22:31.422 - 00:23:20.210, Speaker A: We will have wrap falcons. To get some wrap falcon, you will have to lock your token, and in exchange you will get some wrap falcon on Ethereum, and you will also be able to go in the other direction. So this is very important to bring some liquidity to the filecoin network, because there are already a lot of liquidity on Ethereum, but users don't necessarily want to move their asset to another chain. So with this bridge between the two different chain, it can really help Filecoin to take off. Next news. So sushiswap, which is a folk of uniswap, the most famous decentralized exchange, sushi swap, avoided a hack this week. So there was still $10,000 that were stolen.
00:23:20.210 - 00:24:01.566, Speaker A: So the hacker managed to steal this. But the team of sushi swap was very reactive because they figured out very quickly that something wrong was going on. So what's really interesting is height was resolved. So the team of Sushiswap saw that and they wanted to communicate with the hacker very quickly. So they sent a transaction to the attacker with a message. And in this message, they offered a bug bounty if the attacker returned the money and helped to fix the contract. But I think that what happened in the end is that the team of sushi swap managed to fix the contract themselves in hours.
00:24:01.566 - 00:24:40.170, Speaker A: And so, yeah, just $10,000 lost. And this will be taken from the trading fees. So no capital will be lost for Sushiswap. Yeah, it's interesting, this system of bug bounty, when a contract is hacked, this happened a couple of times already, where you have the manager of a project say, okay, hacker, be a nice guy, return the money, we'll give you a reward. Yeah, I mean, it can work. So Certic launched an insurance for stolen crypto. So certic is a smart contract auditing firm.
00:24:40.170 - 00:25:17.560, Speaker A: So they released a new membership service called Certic Shield that offers reimbursement of stolen or lost crypto. So users will receive compensation if the coins get stolen by hackers based on certain reimbursement limits. So to participate in the service, user must provide crypto to a collateral pool. The more you invest in this pool, the more protection you get. This collateral pool will be used to reimburse the stolen coin, so you will earn a fee. If you provide your coins to the pool, it will cover crypto tokens across any blockchain network. So it's a very ambitious project.
00:25:17.560 - 00:25:58.030, Speaker A: So there is already a multi chain defi lending protocol called Kava, which is the first member of Shield. So, but it's not clear if the collateral pool is blockchain based or centralized. So if it's blockchain based, what if this collateral pool get hacked itself? That means the next project we need to do is an insurance for this insurance defi. Never stop, guys. Never stop, always get more crazy. Then I wanted to show you this project hack alert. So this is a tool to be notified when there are some hacks and vulnerabilities in Defi.
00:25:58.030 - 00:26:19.786, Speaker A: It can be used to protect your capital or to do some trade. For example, you can short some tokens of protocol that were just hacked. It's a really good example of a simple project that you can do yourself. By the way, it's not very complicated to do that sort of thing. Yes. So next we'll do news for developer. We don't have much news for developer this week.
00:26:19.786 - 00:27:17.466, Speaker A: So first, open, there is a new release of open Zeppelin, which is a very popular framework for three DT smart contract. So now it's version V 33, and now they support both V six and three DT version six and seven. But before you had to use a special tag to use three DT version seven. It's a very quick update. And next there is a new release of Ethereum Js. So what is this? This is an implementation of the Ethereum virtual machine implemented in typescript, and that is used behind the hood by Ganesh, for example. So why it's interesting, it's very interesting because you can understand if you dive into the code on GitHub, you can understand the core of the logic of Ethereum in a much easier way than if you are trying to read the code of the go or the rust implementation of Ethereum.
00:27:17.466 - 00:27:53.094, Speaker A: So yeah, that's the big interest of Ethereum Js okay, let me copy paste the link to the lifetime pass if some people are interested. As I said before, today is the last day to get it. Today at midnight UTC I will remove it. It won't be available anymore. So let me scroll up in the chat and see if we have any question. So stablecoin.org said how much cost to run a validator? Let's say I use AWS or other cloud provider.
00:27:53.094 - 00:28:40.220, Speaker A: Not much because validators were designed to run on a commodity hardware. So it's not like an Ethereum one client where if you want to do some mining you need a very powerful machine. For validator you can take some very cheap ec two instance, or on digital ocean you can just take a cheap machine, you can check out the specification, the minimum recommended specification, it's on the technical documentation of Prism. But yeah, I think, let me think about it. I would say to be quite conservative, I don't know, between like $50 to $100 per month, but yeah, I'm quite conservative. It might be less. Actually.
00:28:40.220 - 00:29:01.338, Speaker A: There is a text to speech program that use blockchain. It's called 15 AI. Oh, I didn't know that. Interesting. Abacadabra say okay, I don't understand that one. Hi Batman. Hi Aaron.
00:29:01.338 - 00:29:36.234, Speaker A: Aaron saying hey bro, I have a big doubt about flash on arbitrage boat. If I make a boat and if 400,000 people use it, would it work? Please someone help your arbitrage boat, you make it for yourself because you just make it for yourself. The flash loan, you deploy it for yourself. So yeah, flash loan, arbitrage boot. This is a personal thing. Yeah, okay. Leo saying, okay, let me scroll down, scroll down.
00:29:36.234 - 00:30:15.542, Speaker A: Other question, wakas. I talk about Libra coin. Yeah, I mean Libra, that was a project that received a lot of hype, I think two years ago in 2018 when it just launched, that was so crazy because Facebook launched it. But then quickly some partners left. I think PayPal left already and most of the big player, I think visa left and also Facebook started to get some pushback from the congress in the US. So yeah, I think most of the hype around the project kind of died. And I don't know, I feel like many people don't want it to happen.
00:30:15.542 - 00:30:32.702, Speaker A: Like the US government doesn't want this to happen, visa, et cetera, like centralized finance. They also don't want it to happen. It's only Facebook who want it to happen. Really. So yeah, not super bullish on Libra coin to be honest. Yeah, abracadabra. Check.
00:30:32.702 - 00:30:55.890, Speaker A: Defi pearls, token, DPi. I don't know that one. Gary Stan said bitcoin just went to an all time high. Yeah. So now it seems like we are back to Altcoin season. So probably we're going to see more action in Altcoin. But yeah, I mean bitcoin for me, like bitcoin, this is something you should keep for several years really, and you got to be ready for the ride.
00:30:55.890 - 00:31:30.522, Speaker A: Yeah, clearly. But I think in the past week we saw some money from bitcoin flowing from bitcoin to altcoin and I think it will continue. Zillopian saying what will happen when e two will be a real thing? Well, the life on the ethereum network will continue. We'll still have smart contract. DAP is just that. It will be much more scalable. So that means that when we'll have the next big bull market with a lot of retail users, we will not have some crazy transaction fees.
00:31:30.522 - 00:31:47.526, Speaker A: The network will still be usable, there won't be any bottlenecks. So finally we can have really mainstream adoption. So that's really the big difference. Abracadabra amini jew. You will find it awesome. Dpy. Okay, thank you.
00:31:47.526 - 00:32:13.850, Speaker A: I will check out this project. Any other question guys? Otherwise we are going to wrap it up here. Yes. Okay guys, so I think this is it for today. So yeah, thanks for following today and I will see you later this week for all the videos on eat the blocks. Have a great day, guys. Bye.
