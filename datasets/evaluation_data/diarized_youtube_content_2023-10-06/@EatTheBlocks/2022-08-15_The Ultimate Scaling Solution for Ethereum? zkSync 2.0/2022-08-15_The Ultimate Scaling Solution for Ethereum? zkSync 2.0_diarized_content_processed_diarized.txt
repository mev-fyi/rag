00:00:00.650 - 00:01:04.554, Speaker A: Zksync ZK roll up technology combined with ESPU data sharding is the end game, hitting 100,000 plus transactions per second without sacrifices on any of the four factors, namely programmability, scalability, security and decentralization. That was Matlabs when introducing Zksync to bono, even Vitalik buttering himself, talks highly about this layer two scaling solution. So let's dive in and see what it is about. If you're new here, I'm Stefan, and on eat the blocks we help web two developers get into web3. So because of the Ethereum now well known shortcomings, namely transactions being too expensive and too slow, some potential solutions emerge, notably layer two solutions. And what the layer two based technology does is essentially taking transactions in separate environment out of the main chain where they can be processed or verified, and then batched up to be put back into the main Ethereum blockchain. Now, optimistic rollup and ZK rollups are the two most used layer two technologies besides optimistic chain validium and plasma.
00:01:04.554 - 00:01:45.902, Speaker A: For the rest of the video, I'll refer to Zksync 20 as simply zksync. And so Zksync is getting a lot of traction right now because of the very little friction, or even no friction at all. In some cases importing your application that's on the EVM onto zksync. And that's a big deal because it basically means that developers don't have to rewrite their smart contract from scratch in order to take advantage of Zksync. On top of that, it is based on Zk rollup which is based on ZK proof. Now ZK proof allows you to verify information without revealing it basically, and therefore ZK rollups, as ethereum.org puts it, bundle hundreds of transfers off chain and generate a cryptographic proof known as snark or succeed non interactive argument of knowledge which is then posted only one.
00:01:45.902 - 00:02:21.770, Speaker A: In other words, Zk rollups only need the validity proof instead of all the transaction data. Hence it contains less data which reduces the footprint which allows to more scalability. So what zksync is capable of making transfers quick and cheap. Zksync is smart contract friendly with Zksync 20 testnet featuring smart contract insolidity or reusing existing solidity code. Zksync is friendly for exchanges with atomic swap already available on main net. Zksync has native support of nfts and finally Zksync support is implemented for all the main platforms and you can actually try Zk sync 20 right now, they built an UX on the guerreli testnet. Let's have a look.
00:02:21.770 - 00:02:59.302, Speaker A: So you connect with your metamask and there is your wallet. It will be empty when you first connect. So you can either use the provided faucet right here, which will send an automatic tweet, or you can send some tokens yourself using the network info right here and add it to your metamask network. Okay, let's pause right here. If you try to send your ERC 20 tokens onto the Zksync network, it won't work because the address of layer one is different from an address on layer two. So to see it in your metamask for dive, for example, the layer two address will be this one right here. That's an address on layer two.
00:02:59.302 - 00:03:32.638, Speaker A: So once you have received your test token, we can do a transfer to see how cheap and fast it takes. So I'm going to send some dai to my second test account and see how it goes. So you click on transfer and you pass the address, you select the token. And what's cool here is that you don't have to pay the network with ETH. And that's really handy, because if you do some transactions on multiple networks, you need all different native tokens. Eth for ethereum, BNB for binance, avax for avalanche, et cetera. And sometimes you just don't have enough.
00:03:32.638 - 00:03:53.986, Speaker A: So it's nice to be able to choose how to pay the network. And as it turns out right here, I actually don't have any east right now, but I can choose to pay the network, for example, with link. And I'm going to send Tendai now let's see how much it's going to cost me. I confirm with metamask. I wish it had clear signing. Maybe it's coming in the future. Okay, so it was instant.
00:03:53.986 - 00:04:11.102, Speaker A: If I go back to my balance and we look at the link token, I can see that I have almost lost nothing. It's much, much cheaper. So ZK sync 20 really cool. A validate. If you want to dig deeper, the doc is the best friend. Let us know in the comments section. What do you think of it? And check out more more videos right here.
00:04:11.102 - 00:04:13.370, Speaker A: Thank you for watching and I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
