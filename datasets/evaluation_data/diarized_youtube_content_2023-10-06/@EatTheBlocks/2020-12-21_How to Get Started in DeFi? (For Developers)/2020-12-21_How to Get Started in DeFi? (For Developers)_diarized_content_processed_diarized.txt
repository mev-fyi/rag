00:00:10.940 - 00:00:32.804, Speaker A: And welcome for this live training on how to get started in Defi. I'm super, super excited to finally do this training. I've been talking about doing this for a while. Finally it's happening. Guys. Let me know if everything is okay with the sound because I had some sound problem recently in my streaming. Just confirm me in the chat.
00:00:32.804 - 00:01:08.736, Speaker A: Tell me, Julian. Sound is okay. So 2020 was an amazing year for crypto and especially for DFI and user growth. So market growth was absolutely insane. User growth was absolutely insane. And VC invested more and more money in also. You can see how much money each defi company has raised here.
00:01:08.736 - 00:01:39.160, Speaker A: I mean, I didn't know Defi company raised so much money. All of this is obviously very bullish. And really, that means two things for us. So first, if you want to work as a developer for a defi company, the market is really in your favor. Okay? As a blockchain dev, you can make one hundred k per year. But on top of it, if you specialize in DeFi, you can increase this by ten or 20%. And I'm being really conservative.
00:01:39.160 - 00:02:15.780, Speaker A: Second, if you want to launch your DFI project, now is really the best time. All the indicators are green. If you play your cards well, you can get user funding, employees, everything, really fast. And we've seen some crazy exit, like the founder of sushi swap who made 19 million. Yes, I know he reimbursed it, but just to show you how crazy DFi is, really. So in this training, first I will explain the mistake I made when I first learned Defi development and what I learned from it. Really? Then I will explain how you can find your first job in Defi as a developer.
00:02:15.780 - 00:02:39.808, Speaker A: Then I will tell you how you can build your defi project the right way to do it as an entrepreneur. Then I will present to you my new Defi course. And finally, there will be A-Q-A session where you can ask me any question you want. So, hi to everybody in the chat. Well, I'm so happy to see that so many people. I mean, I don't think we've seen so many people before. It's like the absolute record.
00:02:39.808 - 00:03:22.216, Speaker A: So, hi. Anav Batman bitcoin Angola agon crypto Barrog Bullion Eric Tony Turkey Neck defect crypto Gary Center Banana THX Tony Wireless Dunamis Vasil oh my God. I mean, I can't do it all, but this is awesome. This is awesome. Someone asked me if I'm chef Nomi, maybe. Who knows? Yeah, who would have thought? Who would have thought? Okay, so a little about me, who I am. I'm Julian and I've been in the blockchain industry since 2016.
00:03:22.216 - 00:04:03.752, Speaker A: Yes, I know some of you already know me, but you know, I need to onboard the newbies. I've created many courses and tutorials about blockchain on my YouTube channel, idoblocks, and also on my blockchain school, itoblox Pro. I've also worked for many project in Defi in blockchain, including lending block, which is a cross blockchain lending platform for institutional investor. I was the first employee. We built the prototype and then we raised 10 million during the ICO in 2018. It was my first blockchain job. I made 100k that year.
00:04:03.752 - 00:04:19.232, Speaker A: And I work remotely. That was my best professional experience. Really, really amazing. Then I worked for some Defi company. I worked for Future Swap, which is a Defi project that does feature on the blockchain. It's really, really great project. And the CEO is actually an alumni of my blockchain course.
00:04:19.232 - 00:04:32.790, Speaker A: And he raised $1 million for his company. So really great success story. It's really amazing. I work for ZFI, which is another Defi project. Yes, I know Defi Zfi. It's not a mistake. Okay.
00:04:32.790 - 00:05:01.992, Speaker A: And they do an auto saving wallet a little bit like Dharma. It's really, really cool project. This is a company of the Y Combinator, which is a really famous investment fund in the US. And before that, in my previous life, in my previous career, I used to work for the dark side. I used to work in finance for a big bank called de General. And yeah, I work on the trading floor in the field of equity derivatives. So that was very exciting.
00:05:01.992 - 00:05:30.304, Speaker A: Like in the wolf of World street, except I was in Hong Kong. Yeah, very fun. But yeah, I left that field. And I am from Paris, France. I lived in many different parts of the world. I live in New York, Hong Kong, and now I live in Taiwan. Okay, so enough about myself bragging.
00:05:30.304 - 00:06:06.252, Speaker A: Okay, so now I'm going to tell you a little bit the mistake I've made when I first learned DFI. So in 2019, I already heard of that thing called DFI. There was already Mechodio Dai uniswap. But for some reason, I didn't pay attention right away. What a mistake. What a mistake. Then comes 2020, and I hear about this Defi thing again, and I see the word defi in all the blockchain newsletters.
00:06:06.252 - 00:06:26.040, Speaker A: At some point, I'm like, julian, you do a YouTube channel on blockchain. Maybe you should check out Defi. Maybe. So I started to scramble to learn it. And it was hard, it was very chaotic, very confusing. There were all these different projects. I really didn't know where to start.
00:06:26.040 - 00:07:04.020, Speaker A: So I just decided to learn every protocol under the sun. So yeah, I looked everywhere, tried to understand like bit and pieces right and left. And that was really overwhelming. I was just so confused all the time. I was so frustrated because I kept reading about the articles, like people talking on Twitter, and I didn't understand what they were talking about. So frustrating. Then I started to study directly the code of the smart contract of this DeFi project, because there was not really any good documentation, so there was no choice.
00:07:04.020 - 00:07:42.608, Speaker A: But the problem is that the production code, the code you write for production, there are a lot of indirection, it's very difficult to understand. So yeah, that was hard to really understand what was going on. And I also struggle to develop Defi app because oftentimes they are only available on main net. But it's not really easy to develop on Mainnet. If you want to do read only, that's fine. But if you want to send transaction, you do want to spend all your money developing on main net and maybe you'll make some mistakes. So you want to avoid this, really.
00:07:42.608 - 00:08:26.168, Speaker A: So, yeah, that was quite frustrating. Then I started to do more and more videos about DeFi. And then you fast forward almost one year. And so now everything is much more clear for me. And so basically I work on a solution to learn DeFi more easily. If I was new now, how I would do it, to learn defi more easily? Well, one thing which is good is that DeFi, you know, this is very much an experiment. And at the beginning it wasn't clear what were the building blocks of DeFi, the concept.
00:08:26.168 - 00:09:27.004, Speaker A: But now I think we've already experimented enough, so we start to understand what are the building blocks. So if I had to learn Defi again, the first thing I would focus on a few DeFi concepts. So for example, what is an automated market maker, what is a stable coin, what is an oracle, what is a Dao, et cetera. And the key, the thing that most people don't understand is that you need to study this concept, but kind of independently from any DeFi protocol. I know it sounds kind of stupid, but let me explain. If you try to study the concept and the implementation at the same time, then you start to see some detail of the implementation, which is always more complicated. So you need to be able to study the concept itself, just itself, without any specific implementation.
00:09:27.004 - 00:10:17.532, Speaker A: And I will explain you after how you can do this. Then once you understand really the basic building blocks independently, independently of any DeFi protocol, then you can start to learn the DeFi protocol. So when you learn DeFi protocol, you need to understand that there are way too many protocols out there. Every week we hear about some new DeFi protocol like someone tried to shell their coin or their project, and it's very difficult to know what's serious from what is not. And unfortunately, we have a lot of really not serious project. So in this chaos, you need to understand that there are only a few protocol that are very fundamentals. And a lot of other protocols, they just do copy paste on these few protocols.
00:10:17.532 - 00:11:20.928, Speaker A: I am talking, ladies and gentlemen, I am talking of maker Dao for the stable coin die, which is so fundamental for the rest of DFI. I am talking of Uniswap, the decentralized exchange for as 20. That was really the first one that pioneered the idea of automated market maker. Before we had auto book on decentralized exchange, Uniswap really brought this new revolution. And then we have compound the lending platform, and this is pretty much it really. With this three protocol, you will see that a lot of other protocol, they just copy and paste or they do some variation of ids already implemented in this protocol. So I know it can sound frustrating, like maybe you want to study the new cool protocol or what, but already if you focus only in these three protocols and you know them really well, for example, mechodio, this is a stable coin.
00:11:20.928 - 00:12:05.136, Speaker A: You think that that's easy, right? No, it's actually super complicated. So only with these three, you will have enough work and you focus on them, you learn them well. You will do way better than if you just know a little bit of many different protocol. Also, another thing that is very important to know, and many people don't know this, is that there is the difference between what we call user orientated protocols and developer orientated protocol. So user orientated protocol, you have a lot of the new projects are like this. Basically they really marketed heavily for users. They do really nice user interface, but actually in the back end maybe that they delegate everything to other protocols.
00:12:05.136 - 00:13:03.290, Speaker A: For example, yarn finance is now yarn finance is the backend for many other Defi protocol. And then you have developer orientated protocols. So this protocol, for example, mechodio, Uniswap and compound these one, maybe they don't really have some great user interface, but in terms of their programming, their smart contract, the concept that they developed, these are really smart and they were built so that they are really at the center of the ecosystem so that other projects build on top of them. So you want to focus on this protocol that are really developer centric. So yeah, that's super important to understand this for deFi protocol. Next. So once you know the building blocks of Defi, once you know a few fundamental defi protocol, you need to build your own defi project.
00:13:03.290 - 00:13:58.490, Speaker A: So it can be quite complicated if you're not careful. So one trick is that you can start with a read only project with JavaScript. So you can do some dashboard for some project where you show some metrics about some defi project. And this already, especially if you come from the world of web development, this will be easy to approach it that way. Then once you do your nice dashboard, the next step will be to do some integrations with Defi project, but more deeply. So this time you will actually send transaction to this defi project and you will do this from solidity. Because from solidity, from a smart contract you can do really a deeper integration, you can do things that are not possible with Javascript, but this is more complex and this is only step two.
00:13:58.490 - 00:15:07.084, Speaker A: That's my tips for DeFi project and then some tips and tricks that I figure out after a lot of painful moments. So when you develop defi application, often you have to connect to Mainnet and you don't want to spend your money on mainnet because it's not good and you can also break things. So what you can do is use the forking feature of Ganache and it allow you to fork Mainnet and basically have a local copy of Mainnet on your laptop. And with this you can have the best of both worlds because you have the state of Mainnet, but this is isolated on your laptop. So this is really amazing. Unfortunately this is a little bit flaky, this feature of Ganache, it doesn't work all the time. Then of course you can use a public testnet like a Covan ringbee, et cetera, because some DeFi project also deploy to this network.
00:15:07.084 - 00:15:53.432, Speaker A: But the problem is that these deployments are infrequent. So sometimes maybe they update their protocol on Mainnet, but they forget to do it on Testnet. Also, sometimes you have no liquidity, sometimes they don't even use the same asset. Maybe one die token will be different address between DeFi protocol on Testnet, some problem like this. So it's not always easy. And then what you can do, another possibility is to develop locally and then you can do what is mock. So it's basically you do some sort of fake version of Defi project with just the interface so that you can interact with this contract.
00:15:53.432 - 00:16:42.072, Speaker A: But actually there is no implementation so it's not ideal. But really if you are stuck, you can do like this. So I would say there isn't just one great solution to solve all your problem for defi development, but it's more like a sort of set of tools that you can use and you can adapt for your specific situation. Okay then I want to talk about finding your first job as a Defi developer. So if you guys follow me, you're already probably aware of the m loadfire method. If not, don't worry because I will re explain but very briefly. So m loadfire, this is not specific to Defi.
00:16:42.072 - 00:17:25.368, Speaker A: I apply this to blockchain in general. So aim first you need to define your target. Okay? Because if you don't define where you want to go, you can never go there. So you need to write somewhere exactly what you're looking for. So write. Okay, I'm looking to work in DeFi and if you can be more specific like in DeFi, what interests you? Because now DeFi start to be bigger and bigger. So are you more interested in decentralized exchange, in prediction market, in lending protocols, in the yield aggregators? So yeah, you really have to define your target first because all the rest will depend on your target.
00:17:25.368 - 00:18:06.884, Speaker A: Then load. So load. Basically you need to prepare a nice portfolio of project that is consistent with the goal you defined before. So if you want to work in a specific niche of DeFi, then you will do project that are relevant for this. You just need a few projects, but you need to have at least one of them which is really nicely fine tuned published on GitHub. You can even buy URL and make it really nice because people will ask you questions about this project during the interview and then fire. Then you start to send your cv for interviews.
00:18:06.884 - 00:18:45.140, Speaker A: You start to be really active in the community so that you can get noticed. So you get active on community chat of some defi project. If possible you go to hackathon. So yeah, I mean nowadays there are no physical hackathon, but there are still some virtual hackathon. It's a great way to meet people, try to be helpful for some Defi community. It's basically try to get your name out there, show them that you know what you're talking about and you will see that some offers will come really naturally. Yeah, so that was very simplified, the m load fire method.
00:18:45.140 - 00:19:18.524, Speaker A: Then next item on the menu. So how to create your blockchain, your defi project as an entrepreneur. So DeFi is amazing for entrepreneurs because of several reasons. First of all, it's relatively easy to get funding for your Defi project. As I showed you before, there was this graph with all the investment from VC, and it's going up every year. This is absolutely insane. We don't have this in any other industry.
00:19:18.524 - 00:19:45.016, Speaker A: Like, you guys are extremely lucky to be in DeFi. Then there is a community of passionate users who are very willing to try any new project. Okay, so you go on Twitter, you have an army of Defi users, and when they hear about a new project, they just flock on it. They will send their coin, they will try, they will interact with you. And maybe we are spoiled. We are in Defi. We don't realize it.
00:19:45.016 - 00:20:07.100, Speaker A: We think this is normal. No, this is not normal. Let me give you an example. Let's say you're trying to do some app for taking note or some to do list app. You think if you release a to do list app on Twitter, you will have like a crazy community of users who say, oh, yeah, that's great. Another app for taking note to do list. This is amazing.
00:20:07.100 - 00:20:33.384, Speaker A: That's what we need. Nobody will care, right? So it's going to be super hard to get users, but in Defi, it will not get hard. You can get hundreds of user, really easy, if not more. So this is something that is hard for most entrepreneurs. So let's be happy about this. Let's realize our luck. And then there are very few regulations for Defi at the moment, even though it might start to come in 2021.
00:20:33.384 - 00:21:03.920, Speaker A: But right now, thanks God for crypto to crypto. Still, we don't have a lot of regulation. So no regulation, it means it's good for small entrepreneur. When you have regulation. It's only good for the really big guy, the corporate who can have their army of lawyers or like a huge team to make sure they are compliant. And the small guys, they are left out. So the fact there is no regulation, it's good for us and it's bad for the big guy who, they don't want to do stuff that are unregulated.
00:21:03.920 - 00:21:36.888, Speaker A: So, yeah, we have to take advantage of this because it's not going to last forever. We're going to have more regulation at some point, that's for sure. And also what is great is that you can build on top of any existing DeFi project. So really, this is this system of open APIs. It's not like on the web where if you use the data of someone else, you need to use the API. So first of all, do they have an API? For example, banks don't have API. And if they have an API, you need to register, you need to take the API key and you need to respect their term of service.
00:21:36.888 - 00:22:07.060, Speaker A: And if you do too many calls to the API, then they will ban you. And if they realize that somehow you're a competitor, then they will revoke your access without justifying themselves, without any reason. So everything rely on their permission. But in Defi on the blockchain, you don't need all of this. If you like a Defi project, you think you can build something better on top of it. Boom, you build something, integrate with the smart contract, no need to ask for anything. So this also is something very lucky.
00:22:07.060 - 00:22:42.992, Speaker A: That's why I think really DeFi is so good for entrepreneur. So this summer we had the crazy defi craze with all the yield farming. Now it's cooling down a bit, but already I can see it's coming back a little bit. Like it doesn't cool down for a long. You okay, let's say now you're convinced. Okay, well, I'm going to create my first DeFi project. How should you do it? Okay, so the big mistake of many different entrepreneurs, that they think they can just hire some Defi developers for chip and they will just do the marketing and you will be fine.
00:22:42.992 - 00:23:04.816, Speaker A: No. Okay, already blockchain developers, they are super expensive. So Defi developer, that will be even more expensive. Okay, so forget about the idea of hiring some Defi developer for chip. No, what you have to do is you have to learn development yourself. And basically you will be able to do the initial prototype. So you will save on money.
00:23:04.816 - 00:23:36.352, Speaker A: And second, you will also save in terms of development time because you won't need to do all the back and forth with the development team. And this is super important because at the beginning you want to be fast. Maybe what you do is going to break, maybe it's not going to be a very strong software, but at least it needs to be fast. If you are slow, you're out of the game. And the only way to be fast is to not delegate, not hire people. Otherwise you do all this back and forth, all this email chat, et cetera. Oh no, I mean like the box, you put it here.
00:23:36.352 - 00:24:09.112, Speaker A: Oh no, this function you do here. Oh my God, oh my God, you're going to pull your hair. It's going to be horrible, I'm telling you. Actually, if you look at many successful entrepreneurs in blockchain and Defi, many of them, they were developers and they first built their prototype. I think. For example, we have Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase. He was a developer, I think the founder of DYDX, who was an employee at Coinbase.
00:24:09.112 - 00:24:38.084, Speaker A: I think he was also a developer. We have many exchanges, examples. Then once your project is built, you need to get some user, actually, you need to develop your online presence even before you start to build your project. Okay. Don't do the mistake of the submarine. The submarine is the guy who just worked in his cave and he worked for six months. He doesn't want to release anything to the world.
00:24:38.084 - 00:24:52.312, Speaker A: And he's like, oh, no, it's not perfect yet. We can't show it. We need to keep working on it. And then he works on it, works on it. And at some .6 months later he show it to the world and this is the big launch. And then he launched it.
00:24:52.312 - 00:25:17.372, Speaker A: And then what happened? Nobody cares. Crickets, nothing. Because the guy was just in his mind and he didn't know what he was doing. So, yeah, right away you need to talk about your project, get it out there, get some feedback. Really, don't be shy. So how can you do this? Well, you have to be active on Twitter. So really learn how you can be good on Twitter with conversation.
00:25:17.372 - 00:25:45.412, Speaker A: This is something that you can learn. This is very important. Have a medium where you have a consistent release schedule. Maybe like every week you post something. Then you can contact some crypto influencers, like me for example, so that they can talk about your project. I mean really get the words out there. And also don't always talk about your product.
00:25:45.412 - 00:26:27.544, Speaker A: You can also talk about topics that interest your users. And then sometime you talk about your product, but because your user, at first they don't care about your product, they care about their problem. So that's also a mistake I see often. But yeah, so there is a real effort, you really need to make some effort to get some traction. And then once you start to get some traction, some users, you need to start to look for funding. Because for VC investor, what they want to see is users, especially if there is some sort of exponential growth of your user, they love it. Even if you don't make any money, you don't need to make any money.
00:26:27.544 - 00:27:15.770, Speaker A: Actually, you probably won't make any money, but they want to see this growth in users. So you show them that you have some traction and it will help you tremendously. Also a good way to be noticed, so similar to if you want to become a developer, is to do hackathon. This is actually how many D five projects started, included the two browser who created instadap, who were, I think, 18 and 19 years old at that time, and they raised 2 million from some of the most prestigious investor in the US after a hackathon. So, really beautiful story. Yeah. Okay, so I think this is it for building your defi project.
00:27:15.770 - 00:28:04.132, Speaker A: So now, next, it's finally time to talk about my new course. So today, lady and gentlemen, lady and gentlemen, I have the pleasure to announce you my new course, defi development. Market mastery. I should play the music of century folks like, you know. Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun so this is a course to teach you how to build Defi applications. It has three parts. First part, defi concept.
00:28:04.132 - 00:28:55.832, Speaker A: So basically, I teach you all the elementary building blocks of defi, automated market maker, liquidity mining, flash loan, dao, et cetera, independently of any Defi project. So that's going to make it way easier to understand what's going on. Really. Then the second part is the integration with some Defi project, some DeFi protocol. So we have integration with DAi, uniswap, and compound. I might add some others in the future, depending on the request from students. But at the beginning already with this, it's going to be enough.
00:28:55.832 - 00:29:48.024, Speaker A: So I really took time to do a lot of research on this protocol, to understand them deeply and deliver the information in a concise way. And really, the most important thing, you have a ton of schema, a ton of explanation, and also a part on coding. And then we have a part on projects. So we have four projects. First, a dashboard for compound, where we show the situation on the market with a different apy for compound. Quick note, so far, the project, actually, I didn't have the time to finish them, but I wanted to let you know exactly when you can expect them. So I put the delivery date for each of them.
00:29:48.024 - 00:30:10.072, Speaker A: For example, compound project. The code is finished. Part of the video are finished. So tomorrow I'm going to deliver this, then yield farming. Actually, I probably will deliver it before January 7, January 14, and January 21, the last one. So you have the exact release schedule. But I'll try to be faster than this.
00:30:10.072 - 00:30:41.764, Speaker A: Second project, yield farming on compound to maximize the comp reward that we get. Then we're going to build a bond on a defi bond. So we're going to combine NFT and defi. That's one of the really hot stuff. Then from the final projects, that's going to be a bigger project. We're going to do a Defi wallet with integration to compound and uniswap. So it's going to be like a small version of Arjun if you ever heard of this wallet, this is a super popular Defi wallet.
00:30:41.764 - 00:31:28.836, Speaker A: So basically this is what we call a smart wallet with a smart contract inside. And this allow for really deep integration with DeFi protocol. And then you have a couple of bonus. So how to fork uniswap and then some other stuff for development workflow. Disclaimer this course is for people who already know blockchain development. Okay. So if you are a new developer, then if you don't know blockchain or you don't know coding at all, you need to do my other course, eat the blocks.
00:31:28.836 - 00:32:03.716, Speaker A: Six figure blockchain development. So let me put the link, let me put the link. Okay, so this is the course on Defi. And here this is the course for blockchain development. So if you don't know blockchain development, take six figure first, because in this course on Defi, I'm going to assume you already know blockchain development. Okay, so I'm not going to introduce truffle solidity, web3, et cetera. I'm assuming you already know this.
00:32:03.716 - 00:32:32.472, Speaker A: So this is the first disclaimer then. Disclaimer too. Yes, some of the project are not finished. Well, I just said it. And then another thing I wanted to tell you is that special offer for launch week. So it's going to last until Monday, 28 December at midnight UTC. So I will offer you for free an extra training on finance.
00:32:32.472 - 00:33:13.130, Speaker A: So this is really ideal if you're a developer you want to get into DeFi, maybe you didn't have a finance education. So I will cover a few important things like equity market, bond market volatility, how to price an asset, derivatives and other stuff. And this will really help you to understand better some stuff in DeFi. Because oftentimes in Defi, we kind of assume you're a finance guy. But actually a lot of people, they are not finance people. So yeah, I think this is going to be super useful and yeah, so for the price of launch, this is going to be 147, but I think I'm going to increase this once I add new material to it. Yeah, so this is really launch price.
00:33:13.130 - 00:33:56.936, Speaker A: Okay, so then we are going to do the Q a session. So Q a session. Q a session. Okay, so 1 second guy. Oh yeah, I just put my, let me see my address. My address is this one. If some people want to pay in crypto and then you can send me an email after julian@ittheblogs.com.
00:33:56.936 - 00:34:18.748, Speaker A: If you do your crypto payment. So I'm going to scroll up in the chat. Let me see. Oh my God, so many questions. Can I manage this? Can I manage, guys? So. So let me see. Thx.
00:34:18.748 - 00:34:29.764, Speaker A: Hi, Julian. I never thought. Ethereum and defi news will be moved to Tuesday. Cannot believe you're doing this on. Yeah, yeah. It's okay. It's okay for this week.
00:34:29.764 - 00:34:46.208, Speaker A: Next week it's back to normal. Defi crypto. Thanks for your courses. Keep up the good work. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Mega motorcycle.
00:34:46.208 - 00:35:08.850, Speaker A: Hey, Julian, I just purchased dapps 30. Will it be able to help me implementing Defi protocol compound ave dap 30 is good to learn blockchain development. It can also help you with Defi. But the thing that is specialized for Defi, this is this new course. But if you don't know blockchain already, you did well with DaP 30. It's what you need. It's what you need.
00:35:08.850 - 00:35:31.430, Speaker A: Okay, let me see. Someone said yesterday I received an offer of blockchain dev. The course is gold. Which course did you take? Okay, I think it's defi crypto. I don't know which course you took, but I think he took one of my course. He got an offer as a blockchain dev. Great.
00:35:31.430 - 00:36:03.376, Speaker A: Do you ever do pet consulting on Project Julian? Not at the moment. Rarely at the moment. I'm super busy with the courses. Fox raymond. Julian, why get a job? Why not start a project and raise fund with a token? Yeah. I mean, yeah, the course on Defi will also help you to start your defi project. Is there a discord where people interested in starting Defi project can meet and chat? Well, this is one of the benefits.
00:36:03.376 - 00:36:50.290, Speaker A: When you join one of my course, you get access to the private discord chat of the blocks with all the other students. So it's really great to network. I know that some students already did some project together. So yeah, this is one of the of the big benefits then. Let me see, let me see, let me see. I'm scrolling down and scrolling down. Scrolling down, scrolling down, scrolling down, scrolling down.
00:36:50.290 - 00:37:04.864, Speaker A: Where do I. Okay. Tiego Amaral. Hi, Julian. By the way, if I miss your question, please ask it again because there are many. Maybe I missed some of them. Hi, Julian.
00:37:04.864 - 00:37:33.308, Speaker A: Can you give some step on how to develop an aggregator? Like one inch? Not now. Maybe another time. Maybe this is something I will add to the course, actually. Okay. Marcio saying you say it's important to be fast. How long would it take to an entrepreneur with only basic knowledge of Javascript to learn enough to develop a functional mvp prototype. In DeFi, it's probably a few months.
00:37:33.308 - 00:38:26.430, Speaker A: So in this case, I recommend to start with my course, six figure blockchain developer, and then after you complete it, then you can take the course on Defi. But first you need to have a good foundation in blockchain because otherwise you're going to struggle a little bit. It's going to be too much complexity at the same time. Abracadabra. Question for Julian, could the yield app be more successful than Celsius because they focus at DeFi? I'm not sure what you mean, but yeah, yield farming, it really can make a lot, but it's just that you have to monitor it a lot because the situation changes very rapidly. So one day it makes a lot of money, next day you lose money. Let me think, let me think, let me think.
00:38:26.430 - 00:39:13.224, Speaker A: Let me scroll down. Stefan says, what if I'm not a developer at all? Yeah, if you're not a developer, Stefan, take six figure blockchain developer course first, and then you can take the course on Defi. Dominique, I'm buying these course and all the other. Do we have a course pack? There was an offer for Black Friday with a course pack, but not now. No. Defi crypto. Say it may be part of the monthly.
00:39:13.224 - 00:39:31.584, Speaker A: Okay, defi crypto. Just FYI, the monthly offering, I think the one you have. This is finished already, so I don't accept new people. This is something very old. The monthly subscription to eat the blocks. It's like when I just started eat the blocks. I had this, but now it's finished.
00:39:31.584 - 00:40:01.004, Speaker A: So, yeah, no new people for that. Like peace, saying, do you accept crypto as payment? Yeah, I put my address. Edgar, is the live ending here? Please continue. Julian. Yes, I'm still here. Defi crypto already pay for the monthly course. Is this a separate payment? No, it's included in your thing.
00:40:01.004 - 00:40:27.444, Speaker A: But as I said, this is an old thing, so new people cannot take it. Is this course more advanced that DAP 30 are the new thing that the previous one? Yeah, it's more advanced. Yeah, definitely. There is less content, of course. DAP 30 is so huge. It took me almost one year to do DAP 30. But, yeah, in terms of level, the complexity, yes, this is.
00:40:27.444 - 00:41:06.240, Speaker A: Well, the decentralized exchange in DAP 30 is really like the biggest tutorial I have across all my courses. But in terms of the Defi concept, yeah, definitely there are more advanced in this course on Defi no. Then, Edgar, tell us about your moonshoot id. All Defi guys have their own little id. Oh, man, if only you knew. I was just so busy rushing to finish this course, I had no idea to talk about my moonshoot id. But whenever I have some idea for an app, I just share it.
00:41:06.240 - 00:41:33.610, Speaker A: For me, ids is cheap. What matters is the implementation. Can you get into blockchain or Defi world without focusing much on the front end development? Just with solidity? Yes, absolutely. You can choose to be a solidity specialist. And actually, you will pay better than to be a front end specialist. It will be even more rare on the market. You will really stand out.
00:41:33.610 - 00:42:10.550, Speaker A: If you want to do this, you need to be great at security, for example. Need to be very rigorous, very serious, be really good at testing. But yeah, very oftentimes you have some entrepreneurs who come to you and then they want to do their blockchain project. And they say, oh yeah, I took some Bootcamp to learn some programming so I can do the front end really easy. But the thing I really cannot do is the smart contract, and that's your edge just right there. Because since it's so scary for them, then you are so unique for them. You provide so much value so they can pay you more.
00:42:10.550 - 00:42:28.750, Speaker A: No defi crypto. I completed all the six courses. Great. Amazing. No, man. Will there be a discount for guys who are already your monthly subscriber. If you're monthly subscriber, you have it already.
00:42:28.750 - 00:42:59.856, Speaker A: No, man. So no need for discount. Prince, where the flash loan included in this course? So there is a lecture on flash loan. So this is how to provide flash loan in your defi project. So really here we take the point of view of someone who build a Defi project. So you offer flash loan to other people. But I think maybe what you mean is how to use a flash loan.
00:42:59.856 - 00:43:23.164, Speaker A: And so in this case, I have another course on flash loan. You can see it on my course catalog. Let me see where it is. I'm going to post it after. But yeah, I have another course on flash loan. Hello, Julian. Well done.
00:43:23.164 - 00:43:58.170, Speaker A: What do you think about the graph? Is it easy to implement with your courses? No, I don't touch the graph. The graph is a cool project, but it's like a tool. It's one of the many tool you can use for blockchain and defi, but it's not really central to understanding how Defi work. Edgar has basically asked me a question in French. He said, am I happy to have left? Yeah, yeah, I'm happy. France has its pros and cons, but I'm happy where I am. Yeah.
00:43:58.170 - 00:44:38.100, Speaker A: Nance, you use the graph. No, I don't j way so mean. You say, noobs make me sick. Nans say, can you give it a roadmap so that we have to follow starting from zero? Yeah, so I kind of gave it already. So, first, for Defi, you need to learn the individual defi concept, defi building block. Then you learn some defi protocol, and then you put everything together by building your own project. So this is basically what we do in the course.
00:44:38.100 - 00:45:23.090, Speaker A: But I'm not sure if you're asking this from the position of someone who is already a blockchain dev or someone who is a non coder. So if you're a non coder, your first step will be to learn a bit of web development, especially front end. And then you learn blockchain development with solidity, smart contract programming. And once you know blockchain development, then finally you can take the course on Defi. So, you know what, let me post the link again. Okay, so for the course on Defi, this is this link. Okay, then let me see.
00:45:23.090 - 00:46:06.450, Speaker A: For the course on flash loan, this is another one. And for the course, Garrison, is it in a lifetime pass? Yes. And then for six figure blockchain development, this is this one. So if you're just getting started, take six figure blockchain development. And if you're a total beginner, take the jumpstarter package. Okay, then, next question. Paul, what are some of the risks with Defi that you might not have with traditional finance? Well, the risk is kind of.
00:46:06.450 - 00:46:38.632, Speaker A: This is the two side of the coin. So this is a disadvantage of decentralization. If you make a mistake or if someone steals your money, then there is no customer service that you can complain to. You're just crude, basically. They just take your money or you make your mistake and you have to own it. So I would say that's one of the big disadvantage. Also, if somehow the system kind of start to become crazy, there is no way to really shut it down because there is no central counterparty.
00:46:38.632 - 00:47:24.052, Speaker A: So, yeah, this is an issue. Yeah, I mean, Defi is not only positive compared to traditional finance, but I think there is more pros than cons, for sure. Anap saying, what are the sources used for financial knowledge? I'm not sure what you mean, but as I've said. So for this new course, defi development mastery, if you buy it during the first week, I will give a free training about finance, finance basics. So if you're a developer you want to get into DeFi, but you don't know finance. Then I'm going to teach you the basics of finance. And with this knowledge, you can understand Defi very easily.
00:47:24.052 - 00:47:49.896, Speaker A: Because in Defi, really, people assume you know finance already. So it can be a problem. Sergey said, do you plan to do a training on how to run a chain link node? I might add a lecture on chainlink on the defi course. If there is some demand, I might do it. Yeah. Blessing. Emma.
00:47:49.896 - 00:48:08.232, Speaker A: Hey, Julian, please. I send you an important email. Yeah, I will check it out, blessing. No worry. This week I was busy as hell. I was so focused on finishing this course, so I didn't do a good job answering email. But yeah, don't worry, I will check your email.
00:48:08.232 - 00:48:39.276, Speaker A: Blessing, troll time, saying, what kind of daps are we going to build here in this Defi development mastery course? Yeah. Okay, so this is at the end of the curriculum. Four app. First a dashboard for compound, where we show the different API for compound. Then yield farming on compound. So how to optimize your yield farming on the compound platform. Then some defi bonds.
00:48:39.276 - 00:49:00.564, Speaker A: So we're going to mix NFT and defi. This is really something really cutting edge. Then we're going to do a defi wallet, a little bit like Arjun, which integrates with a couple of defi protocol. So, as I mentioned before for the project, actually, I was a little bit late. I didn't have the time to finish them. So you can see the delivery date. So, for example, compound dashboard.
00:49:00.564 - 00:49:35.220, Speaker A: This is going to be delivered tomorrow. Then yield farming compound, January 7, January 14. And last project, January 21. But if I can, I will deliver this faster and the rest of the course is delivered already. Okay, what about creating a full crypto course ecosystem? I'm not sure. What do you mean a full crypto course? Are you talking of learning blockchain development? In this case, I already have one. It's six figure blockchain development.
00:49:35.220 - 00:50:19.750, Speaker A: Federico said, I don't see the defi course on the index. Yeah, I will release it in the catalog, but you can follow the link I put on the chat and you can access it already. Barry street, you mentioned you are coming with advanced solidity course soon. Will that in regards to being a solidity specialist? Yes, of course. To specialize in solidity and possibly become a security specialist, that kind of thing, which is, I think, one of the best specialization as a blockchain developer. Maybe as good as a DeFi specialization. Yeah, defi and solitude, the two specialization that work really well.
00:50:19.750 - 00:50:58.620, Speaker A: Best way to get in touch with you. My email. Okay, I put it already but I put it again. Julian@eattheblocks.com. Yeah, I just put this in the chat then. Barry, will you be coming out with the full blockchain security course? Well, I mean, security will be part of the advanced course, so we can audit. Yeah, security will be part of advanced three DT Prabhat saying how to enroll.
00:50:58.620 - 00:51:15.872, Speaker A: Yeah, you can follow the link in the mean. Okay, let me put it again. I put it again. The link. Okay, Nance, say you write in French, but I translate. Thanks for your answer. Excellent.
00:51:15.872 - 00:51:34.980, Speaker A: Your model. Wow. Thank you, Nance. What are the good finance books? Oh, there is this one. It's called option pricing and derivatives. Something like this. I just have a remote memory.
00:51:34.980 - 00:51:54.608, Speaker A: But I will mention this in the finance life training for people who take this course. But yeah, there is this famous book for all people who take a master of finance. I bought it too. And basically it teach you like option pricing, that sort of thing. There is one in particular which is really famous. Batman. I'm so excited to start.
00:51:54.608 - 00:52:23.112, Speaker A: Yeah, Batman. Nonsense. Can you do a course on Bezis cash? I don't know what it is. I'm going to need to do some research. Oakland said, any chance you can cover l two scaling? Are these ready for implementation? L two scaling. Right now this is still not very much used. So if in the future it becomes a big part of DFI, I might add it to the course.
00:52:23.112 - 00:52:53.232, Speaker A: But right now I don't see any big usage. So we need to wait. Godwin, say hello. Godwin, onit said if I'm already enrolled with the defi course, Roblox Friday special will still be qualified for the finance course. Yeah, I think you mean you bought the lifetime pass. Yeah, you can attend the finance course, no problem. Godwin saying just starting off in blockchain.
00:52:53.232 - 00:53:25.400, Speaker A: Quite excited. Great song. Hey, Julian, is it possible to make more tutorials on ether js? Yeah, maybe. Well, actually in the course on Defi, all the project we do, they will be with ether js. Because actually I prefer this library to Webster. Marcio saying your post and links aren't showing in the chat, at least to me. Really? Okay, I post again, but this is weird.
00:53:25.400 - 00:53:47.664, Speaker A: Weird, weird, weird. 1 second. Let me release the course in the catalog. Publish course. Okay, let me see. Okay, so I just published it. So now you should also see it in the catalog.
00:53:47.664 - 00:54:15.752, Speaker A: So let me check what happened if I go to the catalog. Defi dev mastery. Yeah. Okay, so you see guys, if you go to the homepage of ether blocks. Now you will see it. Okay, mega Montana. When the defi course will be on the market.
00:54:15.752 - 00:54:32.260, Speaker A: It's there. It's today. It's just launched. Share the link in this video description, please. Okay, I will do it too. Really? Turkish? Yeah. You don't see any link? None of the link show up in YouTube chat.
00:54:32.260 - 00:54:57.884, Speaker A: Oh, really? Okay, guys, I didn't know about this. Oh, my God. YouTube is just so freaking stupid. Okay, 1 second. 1 second. Where can I. Okay, I will tweet it.
00:54:57.884 - 00:55:38.628, Speaker A: I will tweet it. I will tweet it. For people who watch my live stream on Defi, this is the link to show. Oh, my God. I wasn't aware of this problem with the link. This is so stupid. Maybe this is the new rule.
00:55:38.628 - 00:55:54.908, Speaker A: I think we didn't have this problem before. Okay, I tweeted it. Yeah. So people who follow me. Okay, guys, this is my Twitter handle. So find me on Twitter. Okay.
00:55:54.908 - 00:56:36.088, Speaker A: And then I just tweeted the link. Yeah, I just tweeted it. Okay, let me see the question. Batman saying little issue logged into blocks and it just has start course curriculum. Nothing to select. Is it unlocked yet? I will check out Batman just after the live stream. No links.
00:56:36.088 - 00:57:04.360, Speaker A: Okay, just finished the six figure course. I'm really excited for the Defi course. Amazing. Okay, so you guys how to learn how to program a defi project? Jimmy? Yeah, maybe you can rewind a little bit the stream. But yeah, basically the stream was about this. But yeah, the course I'm releasing is also about this. So defi development mastery.
00:57:04.360 - 00:57:22.540, Speaker A: Yeah, guys. So for people who missed this. So I post the link in the chat, but apparently YouTube removed them. So I also tweeted the link to the course on my Twitter. Okay, J. Claypatch, you can see my Twitter handle before. And yes, this is open.
00:57:22.540 - 00:57:43.620, Speaker A: I will also send an email to everybody. So you will also receive the link. Jim Baker, do you recommend doing a solidity course before the Defi course? Yeah, you need to know blockchain already. Yeah, I will not teach the blockchain in the defi course. You need to know it already. So follow my course. Six figure blockchain developer.
00:57:43.620 - 00:58:21.952, Speaker A: Six figure blockchain Dave, that's the one you need to start with. Antelichi, do you think it's too late to start a d five project now in order to catch the 2021 bull run? No, we're still at the beginning of the bull run, so. Nice. Exactly the right time. In six months or one year, it might be different. But right now it's good. Kangang saying, julian, can you tell us more about how to become a CDT specialist? Well, this is a bit off topic, so I will do another live stream on this when I launch the course on advanced solidity in about three months.
00:58:21.952 - 00:58:42.630, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is going to be Harshell. Can I pay defi course in installments? I haven't planned this. Harshall. Jimmy, thank you so much, sir. Yeah, thanks, Jimmy. Do you accept? Yes, yes. I have a crypto address.
00:58:42.630 - 00:59:07.944, Speaker A: Let me paste it again. Let me paste it again. Yeah, and after you send me an email, Julian, at. And yeah, with a link to your transaction. Have you sort of setting up your own project? Well, you know, with everything I'm doing on YouTube already, I'm quite busy. I don't know how you couldn't manage it. Hey, Julian.
00:59:07.944 - 00:59:15.360, Speaker A: What a pleasant surprise to catch you on YouTube. Happy holidays. Hey. Hey, Amal. Hey, it's good to see you. Yeah, long time no see. Happy holidays.
00:59:15.360 - 00:59:49.240, Speaker A: Yeah, you catch me towards the end of the stream, Amal. Yeah. Hope you're doing good. Any more question? Any more question, guy or this is the end? This is the end. Okay, guys, well, I think we are going to wrap it up. So yeah, the course is open for enrollment. So if you want to learn defi development, check out my course, defi development mastery, where I really go deep in the defi ecosystem.
00:59:49.240 - 01:00:26.390, Speaker A: Yeah, like peas. Julian. The link can be seen on YouTube chat. Yeah, I said to other people, oh, what do you mean really? My crypto address is also blocked by the YouTube chat. Oh my is the. If you want to see my crypto address, I think I didn't put it in the faq of the course on Defi. Go to the page of.
01:00:26.390 - 01:00:55.410, Speaker A: Okay, I'm going to show you where to find my address. So where to find my address? You go to the course on flash loan, for example, and you go in faq and then you see can I pay with crypto? Okay. And here you can see my address. So that's how you can find it. My wallet address. Nuns say thanks, you're a boss. Thank you.
01:00:55.410 - 01:01:28.560, Speaker A: And your email too. Yes. Julian with the E. Julian at it the block. Okay, maybe let me write it, julian@ittheblocks.com. This one, julian@ittheblock.com. Okay, darren saying, do I need to learn any other language other than three DT for blockchain development? Yeah, you need to learn Javascript, javascript and three DT.
01:01:28.560 - 01:01:55.600, Speaker A: So yeah, if you're a beginner, start with my course six figure blockchain developer you learn blockchain and when you're ready, you can move on to defi. Modern say I have zero knowledge about computer. How can I start? You eat the blocks. Six figure blockchain developer. That's the name of my course. I need to start here. And you take the jumpstarter package is for total beginner.
01:01:55.600 - 01:02:15.628, Speaker A: And you also teach you the basics of web development. Web development 1st, 2nd blockchain development third defi. Okay. Ama say you need julian. Yeah, I think so. Ama after this episode, I think is the next thing I'm going to do. Yeah, I'm going to buy my ETH address.
01:02:15.628 - 01:02:40.268, Speaker A: It's going to be most simple. Travis, financial training available for those who bought Black Friday bundle. Yes, black Friday. It's like the special free pass for everything. You have access to everything. Abracadabra. Here we can see live how is centralization, but no link, no addresses, et cetera.
01:02:40.268 - 01:03:16.984, Speaker A: Yeah, but I think this is the new thing, YouTube blocking the external links. Before we didn't have this problem. Or maybe there is a new setting or maybe this is a new rule, but yeah, this is stupid. Stupido. Then, Ricky, do you have any advice where to learn the strategy basics for the Defi course? Yeah, take a six figure blockchain developer. He will teach you three DT Hashal. Should I learn basics of react or complete react to start with defi basics of react.
01:03:16.984 - 01:03:43.560, Speaker A: You don't need to be the king of react. Don't worry about this. Val says so. I need six figure blockchain dev first, then this new course. Yeah, if you are a beginner, if you don't know blockchain development already, start with six figure blockchain dev. Yeah. And after you can get the course on defi once believe crypto can use elementor be used with eTH contract.
01:03:43.560 - 01:04:09.132, Speaker A: I'm not sure what you mean. Not sure what you mean. Believe crypto. Can you ask your question another way, turkey neck saying once you have joined the courses, which is the first step you recommend. I know web Dev. Okay, so if you know web dev, six figure blockchain dev, you take the basic package. There are two package, one for total newbie, but it's not your case.
01:04:09.132 - 01:04:30.852, Speaker A: And one for people who already know Web Dev. Take six figure blockchain dev, you learn blockchain development. You're going to learn solidity, how to do dapps, and then you can continue with defi development. Asha, thanks, man, for clearing dapt answering question. Yeah, no problem. My pleasure. All right, guys.
01:04:30.852 - 01:04:46.970, Speaker A: All right, guys. Is it it? Is it the end of the question? Yeah. I'm really sorry about this failure for the link. Failure. This is the first time we have this. I'm going to investigate. I don't know what happened.
01:04:46.970 - 01:05:05.330, Speaker A: That's the pleasure of the live stream. It's like you never know what's going to happen. Like one time it's a problem with the connection. The other time it's like you forget to turn on your mic. The other time the connection is not good. There is always some surprise with live stream. You need to adapt in real time.
