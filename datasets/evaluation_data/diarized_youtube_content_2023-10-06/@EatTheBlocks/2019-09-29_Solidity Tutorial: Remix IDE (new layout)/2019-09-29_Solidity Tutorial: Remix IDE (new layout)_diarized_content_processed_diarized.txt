00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.446, Speaker A: Hello, this is julian and you are on edoblox. And in this video I'm gonna teach.
00:00:04.468 - 00:00:16.206, Speaker B: You how you can use remix the IDe for solidity in order to develop your Ethereum smart contract. By the way, I created a free email course to teach you how I.
00:00:16.228 - 00:00:18.142, Speaker A: Got my first remote blockchain job.
00:00:18.196 - 00:00:36.566, Speaker B: Paid $100,000 a year. So if you want to learn all my secrets, you just have to sign up at this URL. First things first, in order to access this ide, all you have to do is go to this URL in your web browser and that's it. There is absolutely no setup. Remix is an online IDE so you.
00:00:36.588 - 00:00:39.878, Speaker A: Have absolutely nothing to install. This is super, super convenient.
00:00:39.974 - 00:00:51.446, Speaker B: Before we continue, there is a little caveat about solidity. So if you've watched or read other tutorial about remix, you might have seen the old layout.
00:00:51.558 - 00:00:53.126, Speaker A: So you can still see the old.
00:00:53.168 - 00:01:21.014, Speaker B: Layout if you click on use previous version. So it's going to ask you do you want to reload the site? Yes. And you're going to recognize the old interface. Blah, blah blah blah. Okay, so the old interface of remix is still accessible. However, for this tutorial series we're going to use the new interface. So I'm going to reload remix in my browser so that I can see the homepage again.
00:01:21.014 - 00:01:30.758, Speaker B: And this time you will see three buttons. Solidity Vipers workshop so actually you can use remix not only for solidity, but also for Viper.
00:01:30.854 - 00:01:33.798, Speaker A: So in this tutorial we're going to deal with solidity.
00:01:33.894 - 00:01:35.946, Speaker B: So here you have to click on.
00:01:36.048 - 00:01:38.218, Speaker A: Solidity and it's going to set up.
00:01:38.304 - 00:01:58.402, Speaker B: Remix for developing on solidity. Okay, so after you should see this. So let's see what are the different part of the layout here on the left part of the screen, this is basically your menu, so you have different icons and if you click on them then you will see that the UI will change.
00:01:58.536 - 00:02:00.434, Speaker A: You don't need to understand all the.
00:02:00.472 - 00:02:24.762, Speaker B: Menus, but the most important one are first the file Explorer here on top. So that's where you can see all your smart contract. Then here you have your compiler. So there are different version of solidity and if you click on the drop down then you can select which version you want. So in general it's better to use the latest one. So for this series we're going to teach Solidity 0.5. So all this version from 0.5.0
00:02:24.762 - 00:02:50.206, Speaker B: will be valid, but 0.4.26 et cetera, these are too old for us. We're going to keep 0.5 point eleven now and if you want you can manually compile a smart contract. But what is better is to tick autocompile here so that every time you make a change, remix is going to automatically recompile the contract for you. But generally you will only access this menu at the beginning of project when you set up the compiler version.
00:02:50.318 - 00:02:51.698, Speaker A: But most of the time you're going.
00:02:51.704 - 00:03:07.970, Speaker B: To spend your time here in this menu, the deploy and run transaction. So this menu is how you can deploy your smart contract to the local Ethereum blockchain of remix, and also how you can interact with your smart contract.
00:03:08.050 - 00:03:09.302, Speaker A: So we're going to come back to.
00:03:09.356 - 00:03:13.750, Speaker B: This menu in another video of this series once we know a bit more of solidity.
00:03:13.830 - 00:03:15.722, Speaker A: But the point to understand is that.
00:03:15.776 - 00:03:18.170, Speaker B: Remix actually runs for you a local.
00:03:18.240 - 00:03:22.150, Speaker A: Development blockchain and gives you a nice graphical interface.
00:03:22.230 - 00:03:42.930, Speaker B: That basically means that you don't have to do all the complex setup that you see in some Ethereum tutorial where you have to create private key, create an Ethereum network riz remix. You don't need to do any of this. Remix already takes care of everything. So this is really plug and play. And for the other menu they're a bit advanced except for this one.
00:03:43.000 - 00:03:45.470, Speaker A: So this one is the plugin manager.
00:03:45.550 - 00:03:51.650, Speaker B: So you can actually customize the appearance and functionality of remix with this menu.
00:03:51.730 - 00:03:53.414, Speaker A: So you can see for example that.
00:03:53.452 - 00:04:17.534, Speaker B: We have a couple of plugins that are activated like deploy and run transaction security compiler. So at least you need these two ones to develop. And after if you scroll down then you will see some inactive modules that you can activate. If you want, we will explain some of them in future videos, but at the moment we're just going to stick to the default configuration that we got.
00:04:17.572 - 00:04:20.334, Speaker A: When we click on the solidity button here.
00:04:20.452 - 00:04:25.118, Speaker B: By the way, you might notice that it really looks like the layout of visual studio code.
00:04:25.204 - 00:04:29.298, Speaker A: This is not by chance, visual studio code was clearly an inspiration for the.
00:04:29.304 - 00:04:32.450, Speaker B: New layout of remix and I think it works pretty well.
00:04:32.520 - 00:04:35.570, Speaker A: So they did a really nice job of improving everything.
00:04:35.640 - 00:04:43.618, Speaker B: This is really nice. Then we need to go to the file Explorer here and if you want to actually edit a smart contract, you're.
00:04:43.634 - 00:04:45.186, Speaker A: Going to click on one of the files.
00:04:45.218 - 00:04:51.862, Speaker B: So for example, you have some example smart contract like ballot sol. So oh yeah, by the way, solidity.
00:04:51.926 - 00:04:53.834, Speaker A: File end with Sol.
00:04:53.952 - 00:05:31.938, Speaker B: So here you'll see this extension. So let me click on that one. And here on your right you will see the editor where you can see the code and you can code your smart contract and you have some nice syntax highlighting. And since it is recompiled every time you change something, then if there is an error then you will see it here in the gutter. So if you go over the cross then you can see the passer arrow. So this is very convenient. When you develop, you don't have to manually save the file and recompile, you just can use the syntax highlighter.
00:05:32.114 - 00:05:34.600, Speaker A: This is a really nice developer experience.
00:05:34.970 - 00:05:40.134, Speaker B: All right, so in this video we're not actually going to deploy smart contract and interact with them.
00:05:40.172 - 00:05:41.382, Speaker A: This is still a bit too early.
00:05:41.436 - 00:06:05.050, Speaker B: But I just wanted to give you a general idea of what is remix and what are the different parts and how you navigate. And also remember, remember that there are two different layout, the old one and the new one. So make sure you are using the new one. That's it for this video. We're going to stop here. And in the next video I'm going to teach you what is the basic layout of a solidity smart contract.
