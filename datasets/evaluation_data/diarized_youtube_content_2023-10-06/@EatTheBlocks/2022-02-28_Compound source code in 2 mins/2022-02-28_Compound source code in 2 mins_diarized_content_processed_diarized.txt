00:00:00.330 - 00:00:44.854, Speaker A: In this video, I will explain the three ET source code of compound compound is a lending protocol built on Ethereum with over $7 billion in total value locked. It was one of the first protocols to offer an algorithmic interest rate, and to this day it remains one of the most influential DeFi protocols ever created. If you are new here, I'm Julian and at idoblocks I help web two developers transition into Webster you it compound was founded in 2017. It's a decentralized, blockchain based protocol that allow you to lend and borrow crypto, and you can also have a say in its governance with its native token comp. This is the source code for the protocol. The smart contract is located inside the contracts folder. The protocol is broken down into several smart contracts.
00:00:44.854 - 00:01:19.762, Speaker A: C token and comptroller are the most important ones. C tokens are compound native ERC 20 tokens which are issued when you supply assets to the protocol. For example, when you lend 20 eth, you may get 25 c eth in exchange. The exchange rate and issuance of c token are handled by Ctoken Sol. This contract has 20 functions like transfer approved balance of et cetera. The min french function means c tokens when a user supply assets to the protocol, the borrow rate per block and supply rate per block. Set the interest rate using compound interest rate algorithm updated after each block.
00:01:19.762 - 00:01:57.818, Speaker A: Finally, the accrue interest function is responsible both for collecting interest rate for total borrowers and it stored the interest in a reserve which is sped to users who have lent assets. Another important contract is comptroller, which is the risk management layer of the compound protocol. It determines how much collateral a user is required to maintain. Each time a user interacts with the C token, the comptroller is asked to approve or deny the transaction. Users call enter market to decide whether they want to supply assets to a particular pool or not. And finally, the exit market function is called to exit the position in a particular market. So that's it for this explanation of the compound smart contract.
