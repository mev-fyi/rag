00:00:00.330 - 00:00:26.850, Speaker A: What if you want to send two transactions to two different smart contract and make sure that if either of them fail, the other one fell too. In other words, you want to group these transactions together. Are you gonna use Webstery and send two transactions? It's not gonna work. The solution is on chain in another smart contract. And I'm gonna show you this in this video. Hey, I'm Julian and on my channel eat the blocks. I teach blockchain development and solidity.
00:00:26.850 - 00:01:02.172, Speaker A: In this example, we want to call the full function of contract a and the bar function of contract b and group these two transactions together. So we are going to call this two function from another smart contract. So let's create it. And we're going to create a function that's going to call this two other function. This function is going to accept two argument that it's going to forward to these two other function. Foo and bar. And in body of our function we're going to execute these two other function.
00:01:02.172 - 00:01:42.380, Speaker A: First we create a reference to the smart contract a. So you need to know the address already. And you call the foo function. You forward the argument and you do the same thing for the contract b. And boom, you have grouped these two transactions. Either both the function call to foo and bar succeed or if either of them fail, the whole thing is going to be canceled because they are grouped inside our group execute function. If you want to learn other cool solidity tricks, I have a playlist full of them, so I'll see you there.
00:01:42.380 - 00:01:42.490, Speaker A: There.
