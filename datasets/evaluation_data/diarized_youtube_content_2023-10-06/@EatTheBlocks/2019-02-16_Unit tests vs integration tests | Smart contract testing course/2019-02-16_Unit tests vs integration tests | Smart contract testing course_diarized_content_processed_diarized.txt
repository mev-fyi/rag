00:00:00.170 - 00:00:01.454, Speaker A: In the last video I told you.
00:00:01.492 - 00:00:05.034, Speaker B: About TDD, which is a high level development approach.
00:00:05.162 - 00:00:06.734, Speaker A: In this video, we will go down.
00:00:06.772 - 00:00:09.086, Speaker C: One level and talk more specifically of.
00:00:09.108 - 00:00:11.290, Speaker D: The main kind of tests that exist.
00:00:11.450 - 00:00:14.782, Speaker E: Unit test and integration test this video.
00:00:14.836 - 00:00:19.038, Speaker B: Is part of a full course on smart contract testing on Edwox Pro.
00:00:19.124 - 00:00:20.686, Speaker F: In this course, I'll teach you how.
00:00:20.708 - 00:00:26.098, Speaker G: To use the test driven development approach to develop your smart contract with the truffle framework.
00:00:26.194 - 00:00:27.526, Speaker B: If you want to have access to.
00:00:27.548 - 00:00:31.302, Speaker G: The source code of the free episode, go to the website of edwox Pro.
00:00:31.356 - 00:00:33.314, Speaker B: And create a free account by clicking.
00:00:33.362 - 00:00:35.686, Speaker H: On sign up unit tests are the.
00:00:35.708 - 00:00:37.126, Speaker C: Most simple kind of tests that you.
00:00:37.148 - 00:00:38.982, Speaker F: Will find with unit test.
00:00:39.036 - 00:00:41.146, Speaker I: You test a single function or a.
00:00:41.168 - 00:00:43.274, Speaker C: Single class in isolation from the other.
00:00:43.312 - 00:00:44.490, Speaker E: Parts of the code.
00:00:44.640 - 00:00:46.426, Speaker D: Your unit test should make sure that.
00:00:46.448 - 00:00:49.258, Speaker F: The function performs its duty on its own.
00:00:49.424 - 00:00:51.418, Speaker H: It's important to understand that with a.
00:00:51.424 - 00:00:54.778, Speaker C: Unit test, you should isolate the function from its environment.
00:00:54.954 - 00:00:59.870, Speaker F: For example, if you unit test a function a that calls another function b.
00:00:59.940 - 00:01:01.598, Speaker I: You should find a way to provide.
00:01:01.684 - 00:01:04.394, Speaker F: A fake function b to function a.
00:01:04.452 - 00:01:05.922, Speaker I: To avoid testing as well.
00:01:05.976 - 00:01:08.866, Speaker F: Function b from function a this is.
00:01:08.888 - 00:01:11.234, Speaker C: What we call mocking and that's an.
00:01:11.272 - 00:01:14.114, Speaker I: Advanced topic that we will cover later in this course.
00:01:14.232 - 00:01:16.786, Speaker C: Integration tests are a little bit different.
00:01:16.968 - 00:01:25.526, Speaker E: Integration tests allow you to test an entire system. That's why they are also called endtoend test. Integration tests allow you to test that.
00:01:25.548 - 00:01:28.406, Speaker D: The different part of your code interact well together.
00:01:28.588 - 00:01:30.790, Speaker E: Typically, you will get much more value.
00:01:30.860 - 00:01:39.254, Speaker I: Out of integration test than unit test. Integration tests are much closer to feature specifications than unit test.
00:01:39.452 - 00:01:43.102, Speaker D: Usually, integration tests are harder to do than unit test.
00:01:43.236 - 00:01:45.086, Speaker B: However, we will see that with the.
00:01:45.108 - 00:01:47.246, Speaker I: Trough for testing framework, it's not a.
00:01:47.268 - 00:01:48.910, Speaker F: Problem for smart contract.
00:01:49.250 - 00:01:51.390, Speaker H: I've sum up the main differences between.
00:01:51.460 - 00:01:53.534, Speaker F: Unit test and integration test in this.
00:01:53.572 - 00:01:55.306, Speaker I: Table for your reference.
00:01:55.498 - 00:01:56.958, Speaker H: That's it for this video.
00:01:57.044 - 00:01:58.590, Speaker A: In the next video, we will continue.
00:01:58.660 - 00:02:00.954, Speaker D: To dive deeper into test by explaining.
00:02:01.002 - 00:02:03.930, Speaker G: What is the arrange act assert testing pattern.
