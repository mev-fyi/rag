00:00:09.040 - 00:00:55.344, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this live stream on the latest news of crypto. I'm Julian and eat the blogs. I help you to become a blockchain master. So who do we have today? Let me know in the chat where you guys are from. So today we are going to start first by my free training. So if you are new here and you want to learn how you can make it in the blockchain industry, how you can become a six figure blockchain developer, register for my free training.
00:00:55.344 - 00:01:42.194, Speaker A: I'm going to give you the complete roadmap step by step for a complete beginner. So we're going to put this in the chat in the blocks.com roadmap. All right, so with this out of the way, so let's see the price of bitcoin. So what just happened? Watch. Alright, so you see, I was doing my shot, I was putting my range. And just when I did this, I was about to say that we were about to rebound on the range and boom, we have a nasty, nasty candle here.
00:01:42.194 - 00:01:56.364, Speaker A: We just broke. We just broke the range. Come on. On bitcoin, you suck. And we have really, really strong volume on top of it. Okay, this is bad, guys. This really, really sucks.
00:01:56.364 - 00:02:31.094, Speaker A: I was hoping that we could go up that that was the end, but no, so we broke this range. Well, now we gotta wait for the next support. Okay, that sucks because we actually had a pretty good, good inflow this week. So this shows you the inflow into the bitcoin ETF. And we only had almost positive inflow this week, just a few negative day. But overall it was largely positive. So that was pretty bullish.
00:02:31.094 - 00:03:00.956, Speaker A: Another thing that was bullish for bitcoin was the inflation. So inflation is persistent. So that would make people put money in bitcoin. And finally, everybody is anticipating the bitcoin halving in eight days. Now this is April 17. So yeah, I don't, I don't really buy this, this crash today. So yeah, I clearly see it as an entry point.
00:03:00.956 - 00:03:43.950, Speaker A: So, you know, in the run up of the halving in eight days, like we're gonna see some massive green candles. So yeah, still a very, very good entry point here. All right, so next we gonna talk of base. So base, you know, right now this is the super popular chain from meme coins. Everybody is going there. This is the blockchain of coinbase and the total value locked on base is exploding. So here on Defi llama, you can compare the value of llama versus the value of base versus other chain.
00:03:43.950 - 00:04:19.188, Speaker A: So here you can see it in pink. And so it's growing up really fast, Solana as well. But you can see that base already caught up with optimism in my catch up with arbitrum. Even so, very, very bullish on base. So if you're a blockchain dev, you are thinking of launching a project. Base is really where it's at. And on Twitter, we had an update from the team of base, so they've decided to increase the gas target to a higher level.
00:04:19.188 - 00:05:04.408, Speaker A: So the gas target, basically that's a parameter that defines how much gas can be spent in a block on base. So the higher the number, the more transaction we can fit into a block on base, which mean the lower the transaction fees. And so here they've stated that their goal is to achieve up to 400 x cheaper transactions. So that's absolutely insane because this is already really, really cheap. So ultimately, base could even compete with Solana. So, yeah, I'm really, really bullish on this blockchain. And so let's see our coins on base.
00:05:04.408 - 00:05:44.714, Speaker A: So one of the coin that I mentioned before was Iro. So that's the leading Dex on base. And that's, I believe this is probably the best proxy. If you are really bullish on base, IRR is the best proxy for that because that's the token of the main Dex, which is supported by, by Coinbase Ventures. So that's basically the VC arm of Coinbase. And yeah, I already mentioned this project a couple of weeks ago. And so, I mean, it hasn't, it's going sideways now, but at the same time, it's also not collapsing.
00:05:44.714 - 00:06:16.944, Speaker A: So because the TVL is going up, I believe from there we probably still have a nice ten x. If you check the market cap, we'll still, still a pretty reasonable level, 300 million. So that's a mid cap. You know, everything below 1 billion to 100 million, that's a mid cap. So yeah, we still have a nice, nice potential here. All right, so after, let's see some meme coins. So, well, Degen, yeah, that classifies meme coins.
00:06:16.944 - 00:06:32.334, Speaker A: So basically, Degen, this is, this l three. So that's an l three of base. Yeah. Sounds crazy. And it's kind of a joke, really. But because we don't really need l three. I mean, we're still trying to figure out how l two are going to work, but.
00:06:32.334 - 00:07:17.034, Speaker A: So this is the first l three and it's relatively cheap at the moment. Market cap, 500 mil, but the price is low and, you know, I mean, that's stupid. People refer retail investor, they care a lot about the price price, even though the market cap might be bigger. But if the price looks cheap, way below $1, then it looks cheap for retail investors. So that's definitely good thing for that coin. And so I believe DJN has some nice potential, nice upside, potentially a ten x as well, then bread. So that's one of the biggest meme coin on base.
00:07:17.034 - 00:07:43.016, Speaker A: Still going strong. Yeah, like he didn't collapse at all. Still going up. So, yeah, very still bullish on Breit. Then we have Toshi. So another meme coin, Toshi is going well. So when I told you, when I told you about Toshi one week ago, he was cheaper than that.
00:07:43.016 - 00:08:28.810, Speaker A: So I hope you listen to me because, yeah, Tochi quite bullish on this one. Next, let's talk of renders. Render. This is this AI blockchain that is, that is, that has a lot of traction right now. And so why render is worth mentioning? Well, that's because. So that's because of these tweets. So basically what's going to happen is that we are expecting the earnings of Nvidia, and if the earning of Nvidia are positive, then it's going to have an impact on all the AI coins.
00:08:28.810 - 00:09:06.800, Speaker A: And render is one of the biggest one. So if you are confident in Nvidia, might be interesting to enter into a position on render right now. Right, so next, let's see, let's see the price of ether against bitcoin. So this chart is not looking good for ether. So bitcoin is going well. But unfortunately, ether is not following up. And actually it's going worse and worse.
00:09:06.800 - 00:09:52.466, Speaker A: So, I mean, before, like we were during the last bull market, everybody thought that there would be a flipping, a flippening, but it looks less and less likely right now. And there are a couple of reasons for that. So first of all, for there is the lawsuit against ETH that reduces the chance of an ether ETF. Then we have all the meme coins that are going to other blockchain, like Solana and base. So that's an outflow of capital from Ethereum. But I think that, very simply, there's a much more simple explanation. And it's just that all this inflow of money going into the bitcoin ETF actually just support the price of bitcoin that takes off, but the money just stay there.
00:09:52.466 - 00:10:42.978, Speaker A: And the money hasn't really rotated into other coins. And so because there is more money that is going into bitcoin and ethereum, then mechanically we have this relative difference that we start to see, but I believe that that's temporary. And so when you see Ethereum that looks really cheap like this, that's for me, it's not a signal to sell. Exactly. On the contrary. All right, so next let's discuss the lawsuit of SEC against Ethereum. So the SEC, as you know, is trying to sue the, trying to sue Ethereum and Ethereum foundation especially.
00:10:42.978 - 00:11:44.634, Speaker A: So that that really surprised everybody because they went after all those projects that were more or less legitimate. But Ethereum, like, nobody thought that they would come after Ethereum. So there is two reasons why they might to try to do this. So first, it's because if they manage to classify Ethereum as a security, basically is going to force the hand of us spot exchanges to delete the token. And another thing is that it's going to be easier for them to deny an Ethereum ETF. So two reasons why they might want to do this now, what would happen if they managed to classify, if they win the lawsuit, which I think is highly unlikely, but basically it would really cause chaos. I mean it would, I think the industry would recover, but in terms of price action, just when it happened, like he would, that would be at least a few weeks really bad on the market.
00:11:44.634 - 00:12:39.878, Speaker A: So now there are different scenario of what would happen if they win the lawsuit. So one of the more unlikely response is that Ethereum goes back to proof of work, because the whole reason why Ethereum can classify as a security, it's because of the new mechanism, proof of stake. So if they go back to proof of work, then it would nullify the argument of the SEC. But I think this is really unlikely because the Ethereum ecosystem is well engaged in the proof of stake. Consensus in terms of energy consumption is also way better. So I really don't see the Ethereum switching back to proof of work. Now the second scenario would be that basically the liquidity flows to another blockchain like Ethereum classic etc.
00:12:39.878 - 00:13:10.690, Speaker A: Which is still on proof of work and hence is not a security. The I don't think that's likely because the ecosystem on etc. Is really, really basic. I don't think there is as much trust in their ecosystem around it. So I don't think this is going to happen. Then another scenario is that the liquidity move to other blockchain like XRP Solana. So I would say that's a little bit more likely.
00:13:10.690 - 00:13:49.124, Speaker A: So this is quite possible, but even more likely. So temporarily, I think that would be some change of liquidity to another blockchain. But ultimately I think that it would come back to Ethereum because the crypto industry would basically completely leave the US. So it has already started, but if the SEC win this lawsuit, that would basically kill the crypto industry in the US. But that wouldn't absolutely kill crypto. So that would just be temporary chaos on the market, but eventually Ethereum would be back on track. So this is what I think are the different scenarios that are possible.
00:13:49.124 - 00:14:42.610, Speaker A: Alright, so next, this week we had some news about this lawsuit against the hacker who hacked mango coin. It was last year, it was a giant hack of $100 million. So guy was found in his suit and so lawsuit is starting this week. And that this triggered this whole debate on whether or not code is low. Because the whole defense of this guy is that, yeah, I mean, maybe that was a hack, but I just used the code of the smart contract. So I mean, this is a very interesting ethical debate. And so depending on what's going to be the judgment, it's going to have a huge impact on the future judgment on whether or not we can sue hackers or not.
00:14:42.610 - 00:15:11.062, Speaker A: So to follow. All right, next, Vitalik published this new article on degen communism. So super interesting. Basically it's about having the right values in decentralized system. So it gives a couple of examples. For example, let's say in a crypto project, there is a hack. So what we could do in terms of.
00:15:11.062 - 00:15:55.522, Speaker A: So what we do now when there is a hack is if there is any sort of refund, the refund is proportional to the size of your wallet. But what we could do is actually give a priority to the small wallet. So we give more to the guys who are smaller, basically. Another, another interesting idea is we already talked about this last week, is for meme coin. So meme coin are here to stay. Instead of just debating whether they are morals or not, we could try to inject some morality in them. For example, in meme coin, you could have a portion that is sent to a charity for each transaction.
00:15:55.522 - 00:16:33.134, Speaker A: And so maybe that's, it seems on the surface that it's like a ridiculous thing, but actually there is a real social utility. So another example of degen communism. And then Vitaly gives a couple of other examples of chain this time. So you think that the only tax that we should have should be a tax on land value. So it doesn't depend on what you build on the land, but just tax on the land. And it also suggests a harbinger tax on intellectual property. So basically, any sort of IP the owner would have to give the value.
00:16:33.134 - 00:17:18.684, Speaker A: It's estimated of the value of the IP and then there will be taxed percentage of that. So yeah, interesting article and not too technical because a lot of time the article of Vitalika is super complex, but this one everybody can understand. All right, so we're going to do the Q and a. But first, if you are new here and you are thinking of getting into the blockchain industry, check out my free training. I'm going to tell you exactly step by step, what you need to do to become a blockchain developer. So let's see what we have in the chat. We have Thx always there.
00:17:18.684 - 00:17:52.798, Speaker A: Good to see you have Zach. How likely do you think this is to happen? I think you were talking of the lawsuit for the SEC against Ethereum. I think that they're going to drop it because they're going to have so much political pressure against them. We already see this happening against the bitcoin ETF. There was more and more voices against the SEC and they didn't want the ETF too, to happen. And in the end, it did happen. So I think for Ethereum, this is the same thing.
00:17:52.798 - 00:18:23.754, Speaker A: There are too many account, too many people who've built things on Ethereum, including in the establishment. So at this point, really, even the rich and powerful don't have any interest in Ethereum. Crashing all right, guys, so if we have no more question, we're gonna stop here, here. So thanks everybody for coming, and I will see you later this week. Bye.
