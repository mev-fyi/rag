00:00:00.250 - 00:00:22.686, Speaker A: In solidity. There are three different ways of sending ether, but only one of them is the correct one. The first way of sending ether is the send function. It returns false on failure. It forwards 2300 gas, and it's safe against reentrancy attacks. The second way of sending ether is the transfer function. It also forwards 2300 gas and is safe against reentrancy attack.
00:00:22.686 - 00:00:56.590, Speaker A: But contrary to send, it throws an error on failure. And finally, we have the call function. This is a low level function that was initially created for calling the functions of other smart contracts, but because of a bug that appeared with send and transfer, it's now the recommended way of sending ether. However, when you use it, you have to be careful because it makes you vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
