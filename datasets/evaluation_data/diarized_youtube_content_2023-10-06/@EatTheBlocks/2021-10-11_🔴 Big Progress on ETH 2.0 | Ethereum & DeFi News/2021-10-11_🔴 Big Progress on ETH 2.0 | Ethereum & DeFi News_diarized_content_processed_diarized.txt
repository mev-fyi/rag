00:00:09.510 - 00:00:41.830, Speaker A: And we're live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi. I'm Julian and on the blogs I teach blockchain development. Welcome everybody. In the chat we have Andrea Batman Salman. So for those who are new here, if you want to learn how you can become a professional blockchain developer, check out my free training. I put the link in the chat and then a couple of announcements.
00:00:41.830 - 00:01:36.018, Speaker A: So recently we have deployed the staking app for the ETB token. So ETB token, this is the community token of the Etherblox community. And so now you can stake your ETB token to get even more ETB token. So actually first you need to go on pancake swap and provide liquidity in the pancake swap pool for ETB rap BNB. And then you're going to stake your lp token on the staking app. And here we can see that recently I think the chat is cut off here on my screen, but there was a lot of liquidity that was added recently to the pool of the ETB token. Then still on the ETB token ecosystem.
00:01:36.018 - 00:02:24.186, Speaker A: So regularly we do hackathon where basically we build project based on the ETB token. And so the next hackathon that we're doing is an NFT collection where the theme is developer. Each NFT represents a developer with a different trait, and this NFT collection is based on the ETB token. So you'll find more detail here. So let me put this in the chat. But if you are interested in participating in this hackathon, check out this page on GitHub. And actually this Friday we're going to do an office hour for participants.
00:02:24.186 - 00:03:02.882, Speaker A: If you want to receive the link for the Zoom session, check out this document. All right, so next we're going to move on with the price of ether. So it was a good week. We are back in bull market, so hopefully we're going to test the resistance at 4000 very soon. And we had a really good news this week on ethereum. So there was a launch of a Devnet for Ethereum 2.0. So they're going to be several phases in order to reach Ethereum 2.0.
00:03:02.882 - 00:03:55.134, Speaker A: And one of them is to replace the consensus mechanism of Ethereum one from proof of work to proof of stake. And so this weekend, the researchers of Ethereum gathered and launched basically a sort of private testnet in order to make sure that this change of the consensus algorithm is going to work well. And so their test worked. So they probably do some other testnets and hopefully maybe we can have this change happening on main net in a couple of months. Then we have some news from Stocknet. So which is a scaling solution for Ethereum. So Stacknet Alpha is coming to Mainnet.
00:03:55.134 - 00:04:31.230, Speaker A: So there are many scaling solution for Ethereum. But what is special about Stacknet alpha is that they use zero knowledge roll up, which is basically the most promising technology for scaling solution. But this is also the most experimental one. And they're making some progress. So that's very good. Then some news on Arbitrum, another scaling solution of Ethereum. So they've launched their blockchain explorer, abysscan IO.
00:04:31.230 - 00:05:16.666, Speaker A: So you can explore transaction on their blockchain. Exactly like for Etherscan. All right, so next we have this analysis done by ether scan on the Ethereum bridges. And so they have an interesting chart. First of all, in June there was the 8 billion total that was tracked on bridges, and now it's 18 billion. So a huge increase. And in terms of the balance held on this different bridge, so the biggest bridge is the bridge of polygon.
00:05:16.666 - 00:05:42.870, Speaker A: Then the second one is running. So running. This is the side chain of the game. Axi infinity avalanche here, 16%. And so this is interesting, really shows you what are the bridges that are the most popular. All right, so next, let's see the market cap for Defi. So we are at almost $91 billion.
00:05:42.870 - 00:06:17.714, Speaker A: We are going up. And so probably that we're going to break the limit of $100 billion very soon. When it comes to the market cap on finance smart chain, this is pretty slow. It doesn't evolve. It's not as fast as Ethereum. So there isn't so much momentum right now on binance smart chain in terms of the crypto fees that were collected on different blockchain projects. So we are slowing down.
00:06:17.714 - 00:07:00.286, Speaker A: So Ethereum 30 billion, but it is below the seven day average fees. And after the ranking doesn't change too much, bitcoin still very far away. And after we see a couple of scaling solution here, arbitram, optimism, et cetera. And the other blockchain, all these Ethereum killers still very far away. And yeah, Cardano here hasn't really taken off. All right, so then we're going to see the top winner and loser for the DFI coins. So we have a lot of winner this week with the spell token plus 200%.
00:07:00.286 - 00:07:33.370, Speaker A: Popsicle finance token almost, plus 200. STP Network plus 150. Wonderland plus 100. Badger dao. Very good. And fought the loser. So we have Joe, I don't remember, what's the name of this project? I think this is a decks on Solana, if I'm not mistaken -30% Lido dao -20 serum -15 radio -15 c 98 minus minus twelve.
00:07:33.370 - 00:08:41.946, Speaker A: But in general more winner than loser this week. Then let's continue with the specific news for DeFI project so year and finance. The top yield optimizer on Ethereum announced that they are going multi chain and they are deploying first on the phantom net work. Next, there is this new project called Soldex that basically allow developer to lend their trading boat in exchange of commission. So if you want to experiment with programmatic trading and make money, this can be an interesting opportunity. Then we have this interesting opinion of a portfolio director at Pantera Capital who believe that the DFI market is undervalued. So Pantera Capital, this is one of the biggest investment fund in crypto.
00:08:41.946 - 00:09:33.534, Speaker A: They manage $5 billion. So their opinion are quite valued in the space. Then we're going to continue with money raised and the creator of Axie Infinity, Sky Mavis, has raised $150,000,000. They have a lot of traction with their game. Axio Infinity is one of the hottest NFT project at the moment, with more than $2.2 billion in trading volume up to now. Then we have another money raise for a protocol that is doing $8.5
00:09:33.534 - 00:10:13.210, Speaker A: million for an advanced DeFi protocol strip finance that is doing a decentralized exchange for fixed interest rates. So this is something maybe esoteric for most investors. We don't really use that sort of thing. This is called interest rate swaps in the traditional finance and this is used mostly by institutional investors. So this is not something that most of us will see. But for all these big investors, this is interest rate strap here. This is something very important.
00:10:13.210 - 00:11:02.540, Speaker A: And so this is coming to DeFi and it's going to help for the adoption of DeFi for all these institutional. Then we have another money raise, $3.75 million for Thor swap. So Thor swap. This is a multichain decentralized exchange and this is maintained by a team of anonymous developer distributed across the globe. All right, so then we're going to continue with another money raise. So Aka, this is an investment fund, raised $30 million for a new crypto fund.
00:11:02.540 - 00:12:07.294, Speaker A: So with this money, they're going to invest in a crypto project. Then there is a huge money raised by an indian crypto exchange, $265,000,000 for this exchange coin switch cuber. And so now it reached a valuation of more than $1 billion. So it has become a unicorn then bit oasis, which is a crypto exchange in Dubai, has just raised $30 million. Then the next money raised from Stader Lab that has raised $4 million. So this is a project about staking, and currently they support the terra network. Next, we're going to continue with the hacks of the week.
00:12:07.294 - 00:12:29.782, Speaker A: So there was a bug that was reported in rocket pool. So rocket pool, this is this staking service for Ethereum 2.0. And they have a bug bounty problem. Bug. Bug bounty program. And someone reported a vulnerability. So this is for a feature that they haven't launched yet.
00:12:29.782 - 00:13:11.030, Speaker A: So no money was lost. Basically, when you have your own project, if you can afford it, it's great to have a bug bounty program before you launch it. Exactly. For this sort of thing. All right, so next we have some update from compound. So last week, compound announced that there was a bug in the logic of the distribution for the comp token. And the CEO of compound, Robert Lesner, made this really weird tweet where he asked people to return some of the comp token.
00:13:11.030 - 00:14:06.562, Speaker A: And now he announced that part of the vulnerability was partly exploited. So basically there was a function in their system that's called the drip function here, and if you call it, it distributes all the comp reward to the recipient. And so someone called it. Basically everybody received their excess comp token currently because of this. Then there was this hack, that very strange hack that happened with someone that. Okay, so it's some researcher, I think. I mean, someone did a contract in Yale.
00:14:06.562 - 00:15:02.310, Speaker A: So, yel, this is a low level language for smart contract. Most people do not use yelp, most people use soiti. But someone did a smart contract with this language and there was a vulnerability in it and someone was able to exploit this vulnerability. But that's very strange because the solidity code was never deployed. So that means that the hacker was able to do some decompilation. So decompilation is when you take the code of the smart contract and a low level code, the EVM bytecode in this case, and you are able to reverse engineer this and to find the solidity code of the contract. So that's a very advanced exploit, and the guy lost $1 million in this hack.
00:15:02.310 - 00:15:41.170, Speaker A: All right, so next we're going to continue with the news on NFT. So here the market for NFT is think has reached a plateau now. So there was a big hype at the end of the summer, but now we are flat. We are not going up, not going down. We have this interesting study for NFT. So the NFT market surpassed $10 billion in secondary sale. And what's interesting to see is that Ethereum.
00:15:41.170 - 00:16:20.866, Speaker A: So here, this is in dark blue. On this chart, Ethereum is the leader for the NFT market, but we have a new blockchain that is starting to be more and more popular for NFT. This is the ronin blockchain. This is the secondary scaling solution attached to Ethereum. And this is run by Axie infinities. This is basically the blockchain of axie infinity. Then in this chart we also can see that the blockchain of dapper Labs, the creator of cryptokitty flow, also is getting some traction in purple here.
00:16:20.866 - 00:16:49.980, Speaker A: We barely can see it. This is the NFT ecosystem on polygon, so still very slow. And for binance, smart chain in yellow. The NFT market is almost non existent at the moment. All right, so next we have an update from ENS, Ethereum name service. And so now they support an NFT avatar. Very cool.
00:16:49.980 - 00:17:52.800, Speaker A: Then we have a new project in an NFT space called Infinity. And that's going to be a competitor to OpenSea, which is community driven. And so they are trying to bootstrap their liquidity by doing a vampire attack on. So for that they are using different mechanism. They're going to do an airdrop for Opensea users. Also, everybody that has listed some NFT on OpenSea will automatically be listed on Infinity without spending any additional gas. Then we have some news from board API ad club, one of the biggest NFT collection, and they announced that they're going to launch a project sometime, a token sometime next year.
00:17:52.800 - 00:18:37.434, Speaker A: Then we have some news from mechaverse. So this is a new NFT series that I launched last week with about 9000 avatar. And so they made $60 million in sales. And actually for most of these NFTs, people who bought them didn't even see the picture yet. So it's pretty insane. Then another NFT collection that has just launched is cool cats and they've made their 1st $1 million in sales. Then we're going to continue with enterprise blockchain and regulation.
00:18:37.434 - 00:19:25.710, Speaker A: So the SEC subponid USDC stablecoin circle. Okay, so this word subpoenid, actually, I don't know how to say it, subpoena, but I just know it's a complex word that means a request for information. Basically. I'm a little bit surprised that they're asking questions to circle because at the moment circle was considered the most regulatory friendly, stable coin. All the attention was on tether. So I hope that we're not going to have any bad surprise from circle then the USFDIC. So this is an insurer for bank deposits.
00:19:25.710 - 00:20:08.774, Speaker A: They are studying how to provide insurance for stable coins. So this is extremely important. So currently this is an organism, a government organism in the US that provides insurance for all the bank deposit in the US, up to $250,000. If your bank goes bankrupt and you have less than $250,000, the american government is going to guarantee your money. But of course, we don't have this for stablecoin. We have to trust that the company that manages stablecoin are trustworthy. And recently we had all this drama will tether, et cetera.
00:20:08.774 - 00:20:57.420, Speaker A: So even though no catastrophe has happened so far, it would be better if we could have the same guarantee as for banks. And so maybe that the FDIC is going to do this. So it would be really amazing. It would really give a lot of credibility to all these stable coins. Then we have some bad news from the US government. So apparently they are planning to crack down on crypto and they are asking several agencies to think of how to regulate in different ways. So probably we should expect more bad news in the next few months.
00:20:57.420 - 00:22:07.280, Speaker A: Then we have a reaction from Vitalik, who said on Twitter that he doesn't agree with the way El Salvador became so bitcoin friendly, because they basically force a lot of businesses to accept bitcoin. But he said that this is contrary to the ethos of the industry and he would have been better if it wouldn't have been compulsory. Okay, so next, some news from Bitman. So, bitmen, which is the manufacturer of many bitcoin miner, and Bitman says that they will no longer ship bitcoin miners in mainland China. So in 2017, 50% of their revenue came from mainland China. It was 40% in 2018. So we don't know exactly how much it was this year, but it's probably going to have a significant impact on their sales.
00:22:07.280 - 00:23:10.434, Speaker A: Next, we have some news from the fifth largest american bank, which is going to offer custody for bitcoin, litecoin and bitcoin cash in partnership with the New York Digital Group. So, yeah, this is super cool to see bank now offering custody for bitcoin. It's a bit strange that they also do it for litecoin, bitcoin cash, and not for Ethereum. So I believe this really weird choice of crypto is probably because it's something that they started a few years ago when the landscape was a little bit different. So probably that they're going to update very soon. And also offer support for ethereum because really it doesn't make sense to offer support for litecoin and not ethereum. Next, still on bitcoin.
00:23:10.434 - 00:23:49.918, Speaker A: So bitcoin has hit $1 trillion in market value. Bitcoin already hit that level a couple of months ago, sometime in May, and now we are back at 1 trillion again. So that's amazing. Then we have some news from Shiba that is up more than 400% in a week. And so they became the twelveth largest cryptocurrency. And finally, news for developer. So there is a new API for flashboard.
00:23:49.918 - 00:24:36.830, Speaker A: So flashboard, this is the system that allow you to prevent front running. And now you can use the flashboard by using an API. So that's much easier for everybody to use their system without digging deep in the documentation of flashboat. All right, so next we are going to do the Q A. I'm going to repost quickly the link to my free training for people who are new here and who want to learn how they can become a six figure blockchain developer, you can check my free training. You're going to receive a couple of tips that are very useful for newbie. All right, so let me see what we have in the chat.
00:24:36.830 - 00:24:46.130, Speaker A: Tyler. Hi. From New Jersey. Thx, Pierre, Amy. Hello. From Toronto, Andrea Patrick, evil. Jake.
00:24:46.130 - 00:25:03.334, Speaker A: Good morning. From Ahmed Freeman. Go, go eat the blocks. Yes. Jake. Breeding post chain testnet is live to play around with. Then George Kennechy.
00:25:03.334 - 00:25:41.730, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Francois Vikesh, Aziz Habib. How can I use ethereum if gas price always crazy high? You use a scaling solution like polygon or arbitram. Now we start to have many. Okay, guys, it seems like the chat is a little bit more quiet than usual tonight. Well, if that's the case, then that's fine. We're just going to end the chat a little bit earlier.
00:25:41.730 - 00:25:59.590, Speaker A: Okay, well, that's it. No more question. Okay, guys, well, thanks everybody for coming and I will see you later on the channel. Bye. Everybody's.
