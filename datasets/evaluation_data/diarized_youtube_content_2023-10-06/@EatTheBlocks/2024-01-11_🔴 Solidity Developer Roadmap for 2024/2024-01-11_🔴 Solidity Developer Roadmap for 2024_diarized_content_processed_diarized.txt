00:00:54.650 - 00:01:31.022, Speaker A: Hello everybody. Can you guys hear me? Hello? Hello. Can you guys hear me? Yeah, should be fine. All right. If you can hear me, let me know in the chat where you guys are coming from. Hello? Hello? All right, awesome. Okay, cool.
00:01:31.022 - 00:01:55.986, Speaker A: So today, welcome for this training on how to become a three t developer in 2024. So I see everybody in the chat wh Christian, super smart. Antonio Samuel Yannick. Aturo. Shamro. Amazing. Italy, Spain, Sao Paulo, France, Montreal, Canada.
00:01:55.986 - 00:02:53.274, Speaker A: From all over the world. Amazing. Okay, so super excited to see so many people today, and we're going to spend about 1 hour together and at the end you will know exactly the step that you need to take in order to become a solidity developer in 2024. So I will give you an exact roadmap step by step, and I will also share with you a couple of stories and some tips and hacks that you can use to become a solidity developer way faster. So if you are new here, I'm Julian, your host, and I've been a blockchain developer since 2017. I have been working with solidity smart contract every day and I've also trained a whole army of solidity developers here within the blocks. And yeah, so that's pretty much it about me.
00:02:53.274 - 00:03:27.362, Speaker A: So I'm going to talk about different points. So first I'm going to share with you in more detail my story. Then I'm going to tell you about the job bucket for three DT. Then I'm going to tell you about the prerequisites. Then I'm going to give you a complete roadmap to become a 3d developer. And I'm going to explain you how to find a job as a 3d developer. And finally, I'm going to share with you more about the 3d bootcamp that will happen next week.
00:03:27.362 - 00:04:28.246, Speaker A: Then we'll do a q and a session where you can ask anything you want. And yeah, so any question you have in the chat, you can ask and I will answer later. Okay, so let me share with you my presentation, make sure it works. Not sure. All right, so this is my presentation. Not sure if you guys can see it clearly because unfortunately I just have one monitor with me, so it's a bit tough to see. Let me see.
00:04:28.246 - 00:05:04.382, Speaker A: I'm going to check with my phone. Eat the blocks. Let me see. To have some feedback here. Let me. If I can see it from, okay, I can see it from my phone. Okay.
00:05:04.382 - 00:05:45.346, Speaker A: So unfortunately this is not centered. I'm going to fix this. My God, it's always so difficult to use Obs. Okay, let's try something. All right, let's try again. If it fix it, I need to hire a professional streamer, because I'm really struggling every time I do a stream. OBS is the worst software in the world.
00:05:45.346 - 00:06:06.540, Speaker A: Okay, let me see if it's more centered. Now, let me see. Just wait a second so I can see the feedback. Yeah. Okay. Slightly better, but that's not great. Okay, well, we'll try like this.
00:06:06.540 - 00:06:52.454, Speaker A: All right, so first we're going to start with my story. So, yes, I'm Julian from France. So, yeah, as you can see, I use every cliche to make it clear that I'm from France. I always wear a french hat with a baguette, and I'm on my bicycle, and I grew up next to the Efeld tower. But when I started my career, I dropped my french hat, my baguette, and my bicycle to go to Hong Kong, where I work in finance. I wanted to be the next Wolf of Wall street, but I failed. I was more like this guy who was let off from Lehman Brothers, and I went to Taiwan to learn Chinese.
00:06:52.454 - 00:07:30.934, Speaker A: I wanted to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, and I met a bunch of software developers who were digital nomads living in different countries. So I decided to learn coding because I was really inspired by this story. I really wanted to do the same thing, like be really free, basically. And I learned by myself. No boot camp, no outside help. And really looking back, not sure that was a great idea, because not getting help was a mistake. It took me way too much time, but in the end, I made it.
00:07:30.934 - 00:08:06.030, Speaker A: And for the first few years, life was okay. I love my job, but I wasn't making much money. And one day I had enough. I thought, hey, who said that I have to be poor if I'm a coder? Why do I always hear about this coder who makes six figure? But it's never me. It's always other people. Why? I'm struggling with all those bullshit customers who don't pay anything, always going from small job to small job, always hustling, blah, blah, blah. So that was really horrible.
00:08:06.030 - 00:08:42.460, Speaker A: And I decided to get a full time job. Those were my three criteria. So it had to be six figure remote, and it has to be interesting, and basically, Lee, in order to do that. So I applied everywhere, but I didn't hear anything back. Or when they did answer, it was a polite rejection later. So I wondered, what should I do? And I started to be really strategic. I realized that I had to specialize in a specific niche, and I had to build my personal brand to sell.
00:08:42.460 - 00:09:21.320, Speaker A: So I chose solidity to specialize myself. And I also started to create some content, mainly on YouTube but also on LinkedIn. And it worked really well because three months later, boom, I find my first full time job as a software developer. Everything I wanted six figure remote and interesting. So I was really happy. So here you can see me doing a conference shortly after I got hired. So it's crazy how everything just changed in just a few months, really.
00:09:21.320 - 00:09:57.906, Speaker A: And I just had the right strategy, basically. So all of this is great, but what about now in 2024? Can we still find a 3d job like that? So we're going to find out. So crypto in general, the TLDR is that market is up. Crypto ETF are incoming. We thought it would be yesterday, but there was this little issue on Twitter with the SEC. If you follow basically the Twitter account of the SEC got hacked. They announced the ETF, but it didn't come.
00:09:57.906 - 00:10:43.630, Speaker A: But anyway, it will probably come very soon and what's going to be launched is going to open the floodgate. We will see trillions of dollars come into crypto. So we're going to have another massive bull run. We also have the interest rate that are expected to decrease next year, this year, because they are really high right now. And so you want to be ready before the bull market start, because when it start, you'll have much more opportunities, but also more competition. And to be competitive, you need to be in advance compared to others, which means you need to start before them. Okay, so the general crypto context is positive.
00:10:43.630 - 00:11:19.358, Speaker A: But what about now? Are there a lot of serenity jobs? And so for that, I went to a website called Webster career. It's a big job bot for crypto. And so there are currently about 3500 serenity jobs. So sometimes some serenity jobs are with other keywords like blockchain. So we don't even see everything here. And on top of it, we also estimate that about two thirds of the job market are outside of all these job advertisement. This is what we call the hidden job market.
00:11:19.358 - 00:11:48.834, Speaker A: So that means that right now we can estimate that there are probably 10,000 serenity jobs. And this is before the bull market. That means when the bull market starts, this number might be multiplied by Tim. So we might be talking of 100,000 serity jobs. So yes, there are a lot of serenity jobs, and this is only going to get better. But what about the salary? So here's the market study of Webstery career. Webster career.
00:11:48.834 - 00:12:31.062, Speaker A: So here for junior you can make on average $100,000 then on average. So junior and more senior is 130. And for the max it can go up to even saw some crazy salary like 500k. So obviously these are some really good salaries. And the reason is that why this salary is so high is because of the imbalance between demand and offer, of course. So most of these jobs are remote. So it doesn't matter where you live, you can travel the world while you work.
00:12:31.062 - 00:13:27.654, Speaker A: As a solidity developer, it's exactly what I did before. I was working in Asia, traveling everywhere, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and I was working remotely. As a solidity dev, you can really do a lot of traveling. This is really one of the aspects of the job that I like the most. And you can also have some remote job for other techniques like JavaScript, Python, et cetera. But because those are a little bit more common to find in terms of developer who can do them, it's a little bit more difficult to negotiate remote job, but for solidity, it's so hard that basically companies cannot afford to ask you to be at a specific location. Okay, so all of this is really cool.
00:13:27.654 - 00:14:09.070, Speaker A: We have well paid job, can be remote, but before you can get that, you need to learn solidity. But what do you have to know exactly? So we're going to break it down. So you have three technologies to master the Ethereum, basically understanding the Ethereum blockchain. Then you need to understand the solidity programming language as well as the EVM. So that's the Ethereum virtual machine. And you also need to understand fundry. So that's a smart contract framework that is very popular.
00:14:09.070 - 00:14:45.754, Speaker A: Right. So here is with more details. So EVM, three DT language you need to know also solidity patterns. So what are the different patterns we use in smart contract? You need to know testing, you need to know yel and gas optimizations. YoL is a low level language for solidity. Gas optimization is how you make the smart contract less costly to execute. And you also need to know how to integrate with real life smart contracts.
00:14:45.754 - 00:15:34.782, Speaker A: So you need to know the big project in defi, in NFT, and for the DaO. All right, so this is the roadmap to learn solidity. But once you've learned solidity, the big question is how you can monetize your skills. And there are several way to do it. So you can be an employee working full time for someone, you can work as a freelancer. So if you want to be a little bit more independent, you can also be an entrepreneur and launch your own project. So this is for how you work as a solidity dev.
00:15:34.782 - 00:16:29.540, Speaker A: And you also have different way to specialize yourself as a blockchain developer. So I want to give you the high level picture so you can be what we call a full stack blockchain dev. So you do everything, you do solidity, but you also do the front end, usually smaller project. Are more interested in this, you can be just a solidity dev. And this is really one of the best option because that's the most in demand skill. So if you want to absolutely maximize your salary and make sure you are in demand, you can just say, look, I'm just going to do solidity development and you don't have to compete with the massive army of web dev who knows how to do front end. So this is a very smart way to do it.
00:16:29.540 - 00:17:10.094, Speaker A: You can also be specialized in smart contract security. It also can make a lot of money. However, in order to be good at smart contract security, first you need to know solidity. So I see a lot of people who are jumping directly to smart contract security. But in general, these guys are people who were already in security. I mean, in general web security, they know how to find bug, et cetera, for web two apps and then they switch to web three. But for most people, the smartest way is to first focus on solidity because that's the core skill that you need.
00:17:10.094 - 00:17:52.570, Speaker A: And after you can continue with smart contract security, you can also specialize in a gas optimization. So that is very specific, even more specific than solidity. You can specialize in specific use case like DeFi or NFT, and you can also specialize in mev. So that's basically trading boat for the blockchain. And that's a small niche, but it's also very well pet so many, many ways to monetize your skill. But no matter what you choose, you will need to be very good at solidity. And so let's say that you want to monetize your skill with a job.
00:17:52.570 - 00:18:44.294, Speaker A: How will you find a job? So there are many job board to find a job, like crypto job list, like crypto job list, for example like LinkedIn. So you have many job on LinkedIn, indeed many different job boards. Some of them are not specific to blockchain and some of them are specific to blockchain, like crypto job list or web three career that I showed you before. And in order to get a job, of course you will need to get a portfolio on GitHub so that people can see that you're not a complete beginner. Another way is to have open source project, but it works well, but it's really difficult. You need to be accepted. Your contribution need to be accepted in open source project.
00:18:44.294 - 00:19:17.750, Speaker A: You need to spend a lot of time to understand their code, et cetera. So unless you are senior, I wouldn't recommend that. Then you have networking, so you make friends, you go to real life events, you spend time in online communities, and you make friend. And that's a very powerful way to find a job. And then you have personal branding. So this is what I'm doing, what a lot of people are doing also on Twitter and LinkedIn. So you basically produce content to showcase your knowledge.
00:19:17.750 - 00:20:16.874, Speaker A: And LinkedIn is actually great for that because that's quite easy to get some views and you get recruiters that start to contact you quite fast. Personally, when I started to be active on LinkedIn, I got a massive surge of incoming leads in my inbox. I had so many people contacted me, it was like every day like five or ten people. That was absolutely insane. Okay, so do we stop here? Because I basically gave you the full roadmap. So next what you could do is you could find some free courses online on solidity. But we have to be honest here, how many of you would actually do something? How many of you will actually wash the free course to the end and move your ass to actually get a job? Because the problem is that we tend to not value the free stuff.
00:20:16.874 - 00:20:46.850, Speaker A: That's unfortunate, but it's just the way it is. Most people who just consume free courses, they end up just watching the beginning. They give up, they don't do anything and they are back to square one. They just wasted their time. Nothing happened. So I prefer to take a more active approach to actually get you result. That's why I going to introduce you the solidity boot camp of eat the blocks.
00:20:46.850 - 00:21:15.310, Speaker A: So in this boot camp you will become a solidity pro. At the end of it. This will allow you to acquire a rare in demand skill. You will be in demand on the job market. You will be able to make six figure with this new skill and more. Six figure is conservative, but once you have one or two year of experience, it can go even higher than this. We can go to 100 and 5200.
00:21:15.310 - 00:21:54.454, Speaker A: Even more than this, you can work remotely and you can also create your own blockchain project without having to hire a blockchain developer if you're an entrepreneur. Okay, so here is the core curriculum. So we're going to do a deep dive into the Ethereum virtual machine. So that's what execute the smart contract. We're going to see a module on advanced solidity, including solidity patterns. We're going to see advanced testing using the foundry framework. We're also going to do a deep dive into Yale.
00:21:54.454 - 00:22:31.110, Speaker A: So that's a low level language for smart contract. And we're also going to do gas optimization and also going to show you how to integrate with real life smart contract. And finally, I'm going to show you how to have a professional development project process. So you will really see the difference between just doing some tutorial and an actual professional process. And that's very hard to get this knowledge because you really need to go through the experience. This is not really something I can show you in a course. This is only something you can actually do.
00:22:31.110 - 00:22:58.222, Speaker A: And so we will do this live. So the boot camp will be one month, start next week, January 15, and it's going to be 1 hour 30 per day that you need to reserve for the boot camp. It's going to be Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. And then you get the time here. So 08:00 a.m. Eastern time. 08:00 a.m.
00:22:58.222 - 00:23:11.060, Speaker A: Pacific time. 11:00 a.m. Eastern time. 05:00 p.m. Central european time, and 11:00 p.m. China Standard time in Asia. All right.
00:23:11.060 - 00:23:45.440, Speaker A: And we will cover, in terms of technologies, it's going to be Ethereum, three DT and fundry. This is where the job bucket is the largest. You're going to have access to code reviews, so you'll have homework. And then when you submit your homework, I will give you feedback. We'll pull request. This is really one of the best part of the boot camp. Like, students really love that.
00:23:45.440 - 00:24:10.402, Speaker A: You're also going to have access to the lecture recordings. So if you cannot make it for a live session, that's okay. You can see the recording. You're also going to have a lifetime access to our private discord. And so people are very reactive there. The instructors are also reactive there. You're also going to have a review of your cv, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
00:24:10.402 - 00:24:41.200, Speaker A: So that is something invaluable. Students really love this because a lot of people, they try to apply to a job, but their profile is terrible. They have no chance of getting a job with a terrible cv, LinkedIn, et cetera. And most people, they never get any feedback. So that is something extremely valuable. So in order to sum up, so here's what you get, here's the value that is offered. So the core curriculum itself.
00:24:41.200 - 00:25:12.300, Speaker A: Basically, the value of this is $3,000. Then the code review. It's a lot of time that you will spend with professional three t dev. So that's another $3,000 lecture recording, that's $250. Then laptop access to discord community, another 250. Then the review of your cv, 500. So if we add everything, the value of this boot camp is $7,000.
00:25:12.300 - 00:25:46.478, Speaker A: But because I know that not everybody can afford that, and I want to give you as much value as possible, I decided to offer it for $600 only. And really, that's not the long term price. This is because this is the second cohort of this boot camp. But long term will not stay at this price at all. It will go up a lot. So there are only 30 seats available. So basically it's first come, first serve.
00:25:46.478 - 00:26:25.040, Speaker A: Last time, everything was gone in 48 hours. So I suggest to book your seat as fast as possible. So you go to this address, eatoblocks.com bootcamp. And so I'm going to put this in the chat. So. Oh, yeah, sorry about the problem with the slide, but basically I just have one screen, and so it's just impossible to adjust it.
00:26:25.040 - 00:27:06.986, Speaker A: I'm traveling at the moment and, yeah, with my streaming software, it's just almost impossible to adjust. So sorry for this issue, but yeah. Okay, so hopefully you still got something out of the presentation. So here I put the link in the chat. All right, so you guys have the link in the chat for the boot camp. Okay, so let's go back to the presentation. Yeah, so a little bit more about ido block.
00:27:06.986 - 00:27:33.382, Speaker A: So we've trained 15,000 students since 2017. And so we've been around the block for a long time. And in terms of the feedback that we get from students. So here is some slides I wanted to share with you. So here we have someone who got a solidity job in two months. Here, another feedback. I've tried learning solidity with udemy courses, but I didn't get it.
00:27:33.382 - 00:28:11.502, Speaker A: Long wind in theory, with no ongoing help. When I did the edoblocks bootcamp, I finally got it. And someone else who got his first three et job, someone who got two offer from two employers. And here, someone who found a job as a blockchain dev at bikonomy after following our smart contract course. We also have students who created their own blockchain project. So here's someone from Microsoft who created his own project. I'm glad I stumbled across you as a teacher.
00:28:11.502 - 00:28:38.746, Speaker A: You rock. Okay, we also have someone who created this d five protocol future swap raised $1 million for his project. We have someone else who creates secural finance who is now a big API for Webster Dev. We also have some video testimonial and everything is, you will find everything on the page of the bootcamp. Eattheblock.com bootcamp. Yeah.
00:28:38.746 - 00:29:23.606, Speaker A: By the way, these videos here, they are testimonial from the first cohort, the cohort that just finished and yeah. So the big question is for our next success story, be amazing if that could be you. So if you want to book your seat, you go to eattheblock.com bootcamp. We have 30 seats only and so now we going to do the faq. So 1 second, right. By the way, someone just sent me a message and told me there are just 27 seats available now on the website.
00:29:23.606 - 00:29:50.020, Speaker A: So that's because we already have three sale. So that's crazy. It's just been like two minutes. We have three sale already. So yeah, it's going really fast. All right, you know what, I will probably send the slides. I will make the slide available to the people who are on my mailing list.
00:29:50.020 - 00:30:20.402, Speaker A: So yeah, you'll be able to watch the slide after that. All right, so let me see if we have any question now. So let me see. Yeah, a lot of people are saying it's too zoom. Yeah, sorry about that. Was struggling with my streaming software. Janelle.
00:30:20.402 - 00:31:13.774, Speaker A: Hello, Julian, how are you? What type of platform do you recommend for junior CBDT full stack developer platform. What do you mean platform? You mean develop like tools to develop? Remix is great and fundry but I'm not sure it's what you asking. All right. No, I'm sure I have a specific use case. I've been studying how to get my bitcoin. I said to evm yet it's a little bit too specific in terms of. Let me continue with the question, but a lot of the jobs on the site are months old.
00:31:13.774 - 00:31:38.590, Speaker A: Ricky is saying. Yeah, so you have some jobs that are old, but you also have some new ones. Shamroen, I would gladly take one hundred k. Yeah, once you have enough skill as a solid dev, you can do it. Collaborate is getting into three t still early in 24. Yeah. So in the grand scheme of things, we're still very early in the development of this industry.
00:31:38.590 - 00:32:29.326, Speaker A: It. All right, so what else? Like when did you become h. When the pass is readily available. Don't understand this. Right. So Ricky, does being an engineer help kickstart your blockchain career in any way? Yeah, it does help you a. So when you are developer already.
00:32:29.326 - 00:33:06.490, Speaker A: It's going to help you a lot because developer really like this. Right then Yanl is asking upwork. Yeah, upwork is good to find freelance jobs. It's great to get started, but rapidly you want to get off this platform because usually the client there aren't great. Okay. I work for a crypto exchange as a senior Golang at the moment, but I don't work directly with coding. Smart contract.
00:33:06.490 - 00:33:27.860, Speaker A: That help. So yeah, that helped a lot. Of course you're already in crypto and you're doing back end. So yeah, that helped a lot. Valley. Hey, I watched your video and I'm now working in Webster security. Awesome.
00:33:27.860 - 00:34:00.570, Speaker A: Very happy to hear this. Okay then. As a net developer, it's easy to switch to 3d. It's no more easy or hard that coming from another language. What matters is that if you are already a dev, it's always a good thing. Right? Let me share again the 3d boot camp here. You can see the boot camp in the chat.
00:34:00.570 - 00:34:22.098, Speaker A: By the way, I'm not sure exactly what is showing on the stream. Is it my face? Because on my software it's showing my face. But YouTube is telling me something completely different. Let me see. Okay. I don't know, it seems to be my. Wow, this.
00:34:22.098 - 00:34:35.238, Speaker A: This is so crazy. We need a platform to massively simplify the stream guy. This is crazy. Yanel. I'm from VBA. I follow Julian course. Amazing.
00:34:35.238 - 00:34:52.510, Speaker A: If you understand quickly the web, it will be good. Amazing. Okay, thank you Janelle for your comment. That's very nice. All right, everybody tell me. Yeah, it's my face. Amazing.
00:34:52.510 - 00:35:34.300, Speaker A: Yeah. I just realized that basically doing a stream with a single screen is almost impossible. What few website you can recommend to apply for web three t developer jobs remote. Yeah, I mentioned it before, you have crypto job list, the first one webstery career. And you can do a Google search, like blockchain job website, something like this. If three t dev makes so much, where do you spend time on YouTube? Please don't say, only to help us. So this is a common question.
00:35:34.300 - 00:36:01.074, Speaker A: Some people saying, oh, make so much money, how comes you don't do it? So actually I used to do it and then I moved on. This is as simple as possible. So I enjoy doing what I'm doing now. I enjoy doing those videos. And yeah, a lot of things make more money than what you're currently doing. That doesn't mean you will do them. So me, I'm an educator and so this is what I'm doing.
00:36:01.074 - 00:36:34.234, Speaker A: So in this case, anybody who teaches anything is not legit because he should be doing the thing instead. So like a professor of math should be a mass researcher, I don't know, like professor of cooking should be a chef at a restaurant. So no, I cannot accept this kind of argument. All right, crypto job list isn't working. No, it is working. It is working. Let me google it.
00:36:34.234 - 00:37:02.354, Speaker A: Cryptojoblist.com. Let me see if it's working. Yeah, it's perfectly working. All right. Yeah, it's not all about money. Okay, any other question? How to get started in solidity? So I'm going to put once again the link to the boot camp in the chat. We are starting next week, the solidity boot camp, January 15.
00:37:02.354 - 00:37:32.894, Speaker A: It's going to be a one month intensive boot camp and we have 27 six available at the moment. Collabor is really helping. I've used his GitHub repo, it's massive. Okay, thank you, Coll, thank you for your support. Hello June. I follow your course at the moment that the web 3101 is enough to apply for job. Yeah.
00:37:32.894 - 00:38:05.962, Speaker A: So web 3101 is great. But as I've mentioned a couple of last week, I'm going to focus right now on the boot camp because with the boot camp we can go much more into depth. So if you took Webster 101, then yeah, try to use it as much as you can. But from now on I'm going to focus on the boot camp. I need to continue with spot contract security. Start with solidity only. Okay.
00:38:05.962 - 00:38:39.294, Speaker A: And once you're good at solidity, you can move on. Getting 500 errors since few days. Thank you. Talking of crypto, jobless. Yeah, this is not my website, so I can't say, but all I know it's working for me. Arash, will you make course on fundry? So in the boot camp three t bootcamp I'm doing, we cover fundry. Ricky, what sort of project should you have on your GitHub to get your first job? Anything that isn't too beginner friendly.
00:38:39.294 - 00:39:37.480, Speaker A: So that's the problem with a lot of the free course. You see that the project are a little bit too simple, so you need something a little bit more advanced, like for example a decks or some dashboard that shows some data from blockchain protocol. You can have many different kind of projects, but what matters is that you do them in a professional way and not just like a tutorial. Okay, Yanni, what kind of Javascript and frontend library? We need to jump in solidity. So in Javascript, if you just do solidity, you don't need front end library. If you do front end, you can use a library called ethers js. But first, if you just focus on solidity, there's just one language to learn and this is why I love it.
00:39:37.480 - 00:40:16.222, Speaker A: What do you think of smart contract in Rust? I think that's great. Rust is great, but most of the Job market is for solidity cal variety. Once again, large projects such as gamma have been hacked and there is no end to it. Yeah, so that's very unfortunate. But that also means that as a solidity dev, you are in high demand because if you know smart contract security, a lot of projects will want you. What about Polkadot? What do you think? I don't think much. We don't hear much about polka dot and there are no jobs for polka dot.
00:40:16.222 - 00:40:54.320, Speaker A: One last doubt, Julian. What is the order of the course to learn from you? Not sure what you mean, but when you take the three t boot camp, you don't have to worry about the order. We will have a lesson on different dates. So you just have to show up and you will get the content in order. Cola wool, what's your take on EVM and other non EVM? Does one stick to EVM and ignore the. Yeah, just, just stick to EVM. This is the most important technology right now.
00:40:54.320 - 00:41:40.640, Speaker A: All right, so guys, here is the link to the boot camp. It's a one month intensive boot camp to become a solidity dev. And we start Monday next week. Okay, any other question about the boot camp or how to start your career in solidity? No, sk, actually, you have a lot of product in course list. No, I've already mentioned I'm retiring all my courses now. We only do the boot camp, so all those courses, this is the past. Now we just do the boot camp.
00:41:40.640 - 00:42:15.964, Speaker A: All right, so is there any other question? No. All right, so if there is no more question, then we're going to end the stream here. So thanks for everybody for coming here. And yeah, check out the boot camp that starts next week if you want to get started in solidity. Is there a time slot during the week? I think you mean for the boot camp. Yeah. So that's 08:00 a.m.
00:42:15.964 - 00:42:32.672, Speaker A: Pacific time, 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, 05:00 p.m. European time and 11:00 p.m. China time. Ricky Khan. They still stay up if you already pet for them, right? Yeah. You're talking about my course.
00:42:32.672 - 00:42:56.136, Speaker A: Yeah, they will stay online. Alex Borch, what is the schedule of the boot camp? Yeah, it's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. If you follow the link that I posted bootcamp, you will find the schedule detail of everything. Antonio, thanks. I will start bootcamp today. Awesome. Oh yeah.
00:42:56.136 - 00:43:31.540, Speaker A: And you also can check out the video testimonial on the page of the bootcamp. So you scroll down and you'll find three video testimonial of the previous cohort. So these are a student that just completed the boot camp. So very fresh testimonial. Sk, are there outdated? So the video courses? Some of them, yes. However, the bootcamp is not outdated. Bootcamp is completely fresh, up to date Shamrun saying, is it okay if I can't make it live for the bootcamp? Yeah.
00:43:31.540 - 00:43:53.630, Speaker A: So you'll get access to the recording of the bootcamp every session and you will also know which homework you have to do. So if you just want to submit your homework, that's fine too. You can do it in async, although it's better to show up, of course. But yeah, some people did it. Async for the last cohort. Okay, Alex Borge, interested. We'll look into.
00:43:53.630 - 00:44:54.080, Speaker A: I mean, I. For this boot camp, I'm really happy. I'm really happy because the student of the first cohort were really happy. I think I did a really good job and as you can see, I was not very present on YouTube because I spent all my time in this bootcamp because I really wanted to do something of quality, make sure everybody is happy, give a lot of time to the students, make sure it's interactive, they can ask me questions. And yeah, I think I really delivered on that. So yeah, proud of myself, proud of the team, and yeah, it's a great way to get you started in solidity. All right, favour, what can one start applying for internship? I don't know, but usually you don't really find internship in solidity.
00:44:54.080 - 00:45:15.110, Speaker A: If you're a beginner, it's better to start with freelance job. Really. Right here. One more time. The link to the boot camp starting next week. Okay, guys, so no more questions. So we are going to stop here if there's no more question.
00:45:15.110 - 00:45:44.936, Speaker A: So sorry about the little issue about the zoom that was too zoomed in because I'm traveling, so I'm not in my studio. That's why live is a little bit. We had some issue, but the bootcamp has no issue at all. Okay, so let's stop here. Thanks everybody for coming and I will see you later. Bye, guys. Bye.
