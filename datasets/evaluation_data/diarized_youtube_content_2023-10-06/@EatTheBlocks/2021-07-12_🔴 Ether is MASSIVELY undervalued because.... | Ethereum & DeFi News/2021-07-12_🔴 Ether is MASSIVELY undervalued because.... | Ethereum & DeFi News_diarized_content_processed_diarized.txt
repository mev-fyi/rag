00:00:08.690 - 00:00:44.494, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly stream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi. I'm Julian, your host, and you are on idoblogs where we teach blockchain development. Hi everybody in the chat. Hi to Gabrielle, Evan, David, Batman, Sia, Greg Hub, we have Dan, we have Hugo Chavez, TSX Chow, we have crypto, Mikhail, many people. Awesome. Okay, so before we move on to the news, quick service announcement.
00:00:44.494 - 00:01:25.642, Speaker A: So we have launched something new which is called Idoblox Project. Basically we are building project together. It is basically a hackathon of about one month where everybody can participate. And we are building project on top of the ETB token. And for the current project it started two weeks ago and we have until the end of the month. And so we are going to do a voting app in order to vote for future project with the ETB token. And the winner of this competition will get $1,000 as a reward.
00:01:25.642 - 00:01:57.980, Speaker A: And in the future, probably the reward will be in ETB token. So we already had a couple of discussion with people involved in this project. All the developers who participate, we did a Zoom call this weekend. They're going to be another one this week. So if you are interested, you can check out this document here. This is on the GitHub repo of it, the blocks. This is not really for beginners already, for developers who are a little bit, maybe with one or two years of experience already.
00:01:57.980 - 00:02:32.874, Speaker A: And then we are going to start with the price of ether. So yeah, this week we had a small decrease, so went up to 2400. And so now we are in a range here around 2100. But at least we don't go below 2000. So at least we are holding this in terms of the gas price. So it's still pretty stable. It actually went up a little bit, but overall it stays stable.
00:02:32.874 - 00:03:16.420, Speaker A: So currently the Ethereum blockchain is a little bit more usable compared to before. I don't want you guys to lose hope for the price of ether, because there are many reasons why ether is still extremely undervalued. And so I found this tweet storm that explained this very well. So some of the points are interesting. For example, Ethereum is the biggest blockchain when it comes to the stablecoins, the biggest market cap of stablecoins. They are on Ethereum, the defi industry, most of it is still on Ethereum, even though we have the competition of binance smart chain. But in terms of market cap, we're still ahead.
00:03:16.420 - 00:04:09.170, Speaker A: What else in terms of the number of Dap especially the biggest Dap, almost all of them in the top 100, they are on the Ethereum blockchain. The community of developers is still number one, way above the other blockchain. And yeah, I mean, it's really a lot of good reasons. So if you need to find some hope for the price of ether, check out this tweet storm. All right, so then we're going to talk of one of the next updates that we'll have this year for Ethereum. So basically, a big change that's going to happen is the merge, when Ethereum l one will become a proof of stake. And so this is expected to happen this year.
00:04:09.170 - 00:04:55.534, Speaker A: And so here this document explain what we need to do in order for this to happen. Then we have some news from the Arbitram project. So this is the l two scaling solution on Ethereum. And they've just announced that they've onboarded 300 project on Arbitram. So it's growing really fast and it's good that we have many competing project for l two scaling solution. And here we have some gross metrics. So here everything is growing super fast on arbitrum product update from ether scan.
00:04:55.534 - 00:05:33.774, Speaker A: So now it shows you a pop up where it show you the transaction fee saving thanks to the EIP 1559. Then we are going to continue with the market cap of Defi. So we are stable. Nothing changed this week in terms of the number of ether locked in Defi. We keep rising slowly but surely we keep going up. And here in terms of the biggest market cap for individual projects. So Ave is still number one.
00:05:33.774 - 00:06:22.126, Speaker A: And now instadap is number two, is super impressive. I remember back in the days, instadap was totally at the bottom of the charts, because really one of the main strength of instadap is that they have access to users, they are protocol agnostic and this is extremely valuable, of course, curve finance. So it's very strange. But curve finance now is above Uniswap. Uniswap now is only number six, and Sushiswap is well below. All right, so next, let's have a look at crypto fees. So this is a dashboard that tells you what is the average fee for a different blockchain and different project as well.
00:06:22.126 - 00:07:06.746, Speaker A: So Ethereum number one finance machine, number two, less than 50% of the fee of Ethereum Uniswap vitri, this is super impressive. Like just a single project makes almost more money than the entire binance smart chain. So super impressive. And bitcoin is very, very far. Even though the market cap of bitcoin is way higher than Ethereum, actually in terms of fee, it's way lower. So that really show you that relatively to Ethereum, bitcoin is really overvalued. Next, we are going to talk of the top defi coin for this week.
00:07:06.746 - 00:07:35.694, Speaker A: So the biggest increase was for the token of Insta DAP plus 160%. And that was probably because they had an internal discussion on their forum where they started to discuss what could be the revenue model of instadap. Because at the moment it's free. So it's funded by VC. So usually when your project is funded by VC, your product is free to use for a couple of years. And after at some point you start to think of monetization. So they start to be at this phase.
00:07:35.694 - 00:08:28.038, Speaker A: And of course if they start to monetize, then probably that some of the profit will be shared to the token holder. Then we had a big increase for the synthetics token, and that's because they announced that they're going to launch on the optimism network. Then the token of Alpha Finance plus 50%. So that's a launch pad on Polka Dot. And so they just released their first project, then the auction token, so plus 44% they announced the v three, and then we have Dodo plus 40%. So they announced a new collaboration, and there was also a tweet of binance that thanked the project. And in terms of the losers, we have more winners than loser this week here.
00:08:28.038 - 00:09:16.674, Speaker A: Polkat starter minus -20% bond bridge -20% Rari -30% but Rari in the past few weeks was doing very well. So yeah, now it comes back down a little bit, then we're going to move on with a specific news of d five project. And so we have some news from Andre Khonje. So Andre Kwanre, that's basically a developer that is extremely productive. He is the creator of many, many projects in DFI. So especially in the late 2020, we heard a lot from him and the past few months less, and now he's back. And so he announced that he's going to release five prototype.
00:09:16.674 - 00:10:03.010, Speaker A: So he doesn't really intend to finish to actually release production project, but he does this prototype so that they can inspire some teams that can be taken over. So we have a Levx leverage on chain spot perps. So perps, this means a perpetual swap. Yes, basically some advanced product for trading production market. So this is Defi insurance ave delegate. This is to use a feature of Ave where you can do a credit delegation. What if this one curve goes metapool okay, so I don't know, curve enough to understand this one and fixed forest.
00:10:03.010 - 00:10:46.290, Speaker A: And basically he wants to do, I think, zero governance synthetics, and he want to be more involved in this project. Okay, so next we're going to continue with a cool story of someone who bought a Tesla. You bought a Tesla? Thanks to, you know, I just had a look at the picture and seriously, this guy wins. So much for the cool factor. Look at the shape of the Tesla. Like all white, looks so cool, the clothes, the haircut, everything, like, so cyberpunk, like, seriously, congrats. Great style.
00:10:46.290 - 00:11:25.610, Speaker A: So basically, that guy, he financed the whole operation thanks to Defi. So he took a loan, thanks to some lending protocol, and then he staked some of the money. And thanks to the yield of Defi, then he's able to pay for the leasing of this car. So, yeah, this is a car on tally finance with Defi. Super cool story. Next, I wanted to show you this product update from a product called the Token Terminal. So this is basically a dashboard to help you a value token.
00:11:25.610 - 00:12:10.862, Speaker A: And they are introducing a new metric. So price to earning. So it's basically for the earning, they add all the protocol revenue. So that's similar to the idea of the p ratio for centralized finance for stocks. Because this is a big problem in DeFi, we have no idea what should be the correct price of a token. So maybe that the industry is going to start to define some metrics and from there our valuation will start to make more sense then. So some news from a new company called Coin cover.
00:12:10.862 - 00:12:31.886, Speaker A: New, actually, they started in 2018. So they do a DFI insurance and they raised about $9 million. So the Defi insurance sector is exploding at the moment. We have a ton of project. Then some news from Xerion. So this is a Defi dashboard. So a little bit similar to instadap.
00:12:31.886 - 00:13:12.034, Speaker A: It allow you to manage all your defi investment from a single dashboard. And so they raised $8 million for the development of their project. Then we have some news from the Shiba token. So Shiba, that was a meme coin that got famous a couple of weeks ago because they did a giant airdrop to Vitalik. And Vitalik decided to basically burn all the tokens because he thought that they were not valuable. And so they launch their product. So Shiba swap, and they already have $1 billion locked in their platform.
00:13:12.034 - 00:13:47.922, Speaker A: So it's one of the fastest growing project at the moment. Next, we have some news from balancer. Balancer, which is a Dex. This is a sort of alternative to uniswap, but a little bit more advanced, more sophisticated. And so they released a new kind of liquidity pool called stable pool. So this is for assets that trade at very similar price, for example, stablecoins. And so they're basically trying to compete with project like curve finance.
00:13:47.922 - 00:14:41.210, Speaker A: But contrary to curve finance, they don't just do stable pools, but they do many other things. So there is this interesting article of the defiant that explain how you can avoid crypto scams. So what you should watch out for. So first of all, the type of scam that exists, then the different sign that it might be a scam. So you have to need to have a look at the team page, see if people have a LinkedIn, et cetera. If you can't find anything about them, the white paper are there, are they real white paper or they just call white paper, but there is nothing inside. Crazy promises locked in liquidity or can they just redeem their liquidity at any time, et cetera, et cetera.
00:14:41.210 - 00:15:23.130, Speaker A: Then some news from Chen. Swap. So this is a project that allow you to exchange assets between blockchains and they were hacked for $8 million. Then we have some news from the graph. So the graph, this is this project that allow you to read data from the blockchain, but in a decentralized way. They just launched the last part of their project, which is called curation. So basically, now the graph protocol has released everything that we're planning to do.
00:15:23.130 - 00:16:01.314, Speaker A: So now everybody can create subgraphs. So it means if you have some idea about some sort of data set that might be interesting for the community or for the project, then you can create your own subgraph and become a provider of this data. And then you get paid if people are happy, of the data that you provide. And so that's probably going to be very bullish. For the token of the graph, then we're going to talk NFT. And so I wanted to show you this dashboard for NFT. So here you can see the average price of NFT on superware.
00:16:01.314 - 00:16:29.070, Speaker A: So here we had the bubble, it just picked somewhere in April. And so now we're still going down. We're pretty much going down for a lot of metrics, except for some collectible are still doing great. For example, average mibits. Now, cryptopunk still going down. Hashmask still going down. Borrow apes they picked more recently.
00:16:29.070 - 00:17:27.010, Speaker A: And yeah. So if you are into NFT, it's a good way to summarize the information. Then we have some news from Axi Infinity. They did more than 22 million in daily trading volume which translated into 1 million of revenue daily. So if you annualize this revenue, that means that this compete with some of the biggest AAA game like Fortnite, et Cetera. So now blockchain game are really doing great. Then we have subdued from what is this one? Sorry, I'll lose myself in my notes.
00:17:27.010 - 00:17:57.030, Speaker A: 1 second. Yes. So the mystic axie NFTs now are more expensive than cryptopunk for the cheapest one. So yeah, for a long time cryptopunk was really the favorite in the NFT world. But now there is this new collection that start to get a lot of traction. Next, some news from NFTX. So NFTX, this is a project to get a fractional ownership of an NFT.
00:17:57.030 - 00:18:35.622, Speaker A: So sometimes, actually a lot of time NFT are very expensive. This is very difficult for just the average investor to invest in an NFT. So they basically break down NFT into multiple es, 20 tokens so that you can have a fractional ownership. And so they've just released their v two and they're going to have some really cool stuff like something which is called smart order. So with a smart order you can just place an order for a collection. So you say, for example, I want to buy for, I don't know, a certain amount of crypto punk, but maybe you don't know exactly which crypto punk. So you can do this.
00:18:35.622 - 00:19:02.160, Speaker A: Now. You can also do NFT flash loan. So I think this project is what they're doing is super useful and they are the leader in what they are doing. Fractional NFT. So super bullish on this project. Then some news from Sushiswap. So they've announced that they are working on an NFT platform.
00:19:02.160 - 00:19:29.320, Speaker A: And so little by little, Sushi is turning into a one stop shop for Defi. They are doing a lot of different things. I know they're also doing a launch pad. So really a lot of activity on sushi. Then some news from Israel. So the new president of Israel received an NFT for the presidential oath. Very interesting.
00:19:29.320 - 00:20:06.120, Speaker A: See some NFT in politics now. Next we are going to talk of enterprise blockchain and regulation. So first some news from Circle, which is the company of USDC, which is the second largest stable coin after tether. They have about, I think $25 billion of USDC in a circulation. And so they've announced that they will become a public company. So super good news. So after Coinbase, now we have USDC circle going public.
00:20:06.120 - 00:20:47.890, Speaker A: Personally, I actually prefer USDC compared to tether when it comes to stablecoin because there aren't so many drama with circle. So just as an investor, it just makes me feel a little bit more comfortable to have a USDC instead of tether, even though I don't think they're going to be any big issue with tether, but we never know. Then another crypto project that will become public this year. So that's a crypto exchange that is called bullish. I actually never heard about it. It was launched very recently. And so that's an exchange backed by block one.
00:20:47.890 - 00:21:33.550, Speaker A: So block one is the company of Eos. So this exchange will go public at the end of this year and they are valued at about 9 billion, which is much smaller than the coinbase at 100 billion. But it's really good to have all this news of crypto company going public. It's going to give a lot of credibility to the industry. Then we have some news from the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the bank de France. So this is basically the french central bank. And so they are experimenting for their CBDC.
00:21:33.550 - 00:22:21.438, Speaker A: I never can say it right. CBDC, central bank digital currency, where this is basically a central bank that are trying to do their own crypto. So basically the central bank of Singapore and of France, they did basically a money transfer across border by using CBDC. So yeah, we start to hear more and more news about CBDC. So yeah, probably at some point, either this year or next year, we're going to have a central bank that launched the. Then. Then we have some news from Germany.
00:22:21.438 - 00:23:24.440, Speaker A: So the Germany regulators has granted institutional funds the ability to invest in crypto. So it's going to provide more and we start to hear more. This is not the first time we hear news like this. We also heard news from the US where some of their investment fund where people save their money for their retirement, some of these funds start to have an allocation for crypto. Then there was this tweet of this study of analyst of JPMorgan that expect the staking reward of blockchain of crypto to grow to reach 40 billion by 2025. Though they estimate that currently it's a $9 billion business. So it's going to be multiplied by four in four years then.
00:23:24.440 - 00:24:08.670, Speaker A: So a us senator bought some share of grayscale bitcoin in ether trust. So it's good to have some politician that start to have some stake in crypto. Then we have some news from a swiss bank called Signum. So they become the first bank in the world to offer Ethereum 2.0 staking. So that's very interesting because we see Coinbase becoming more and more like a bank. And also on the other side, we start to see some bank that try to become more and more like centralized exchanges.
00:24:08.670 - 00:24:41.694, Speaker A: And next, news from Sentender in the UK. So this is a continuation of the saga of Binance. So senter in the UK has started to block payment to binance. So if you are a client of this bank, you can no longer send your funds to binance. And they are not the first one to do this. You also have barclays. I started to do it, yeah.
00:24:41.694 - 00:25:19.130, Speaker A: So this is really a bad series for binance. Then we're going to talk of bitcoin. So there was a huge drop in the hash rate of bitcoin. Let me see where we have the hash rate here. Basically because of all the ban that happened in China. So right now there is a great migration in the industry. So miners that are moving out of China, they're going to other country.
00:25:19.130 - 00:26:10.780, Speaker A: And so now the hash rate on bitcoin is a 50% down. But what's really amazing is that the bitcoin blockchain has shown that it was very resilient, because even though the hash rate decreased so fast, so suddenly there were no problem of forking the blockchain kept adding new blocks. There were absolutely no problem. And lastly, we have some news from Cosmos. So Cosmos is creating a crypto App Store that will go beyond just Cosmos. Actually, the company behind Cosmos is called so tendermint. They were working on this project of a crypto App Store and so finally they revealed it.
00:26:10.780 - 00:26:54.120, Speaker A: So they are going to launch a better version this month for Cosmos and after, they will expand to other blockchain in September. And so this crypto App Store is going to be called Emirates, and it will begin with a non custodial dashboard, which means user will keep control of their fund. So they are not the first one to announce a project like this. There is also coinbase that want to do a crypto App Store. On the one hand, of course, in crypto we don't like anything that is centralized. So it's a little bit weird. Just the concept of an App Store, which is something centralized to distribute decentralized app.
00:26:54.120 - 00:27:45.634, Speaker A: This is a little bit weird, but as long as they don't have the monopoly of the distribution for these apps, I think that's positive because it's going to help some more mainstream users to start to discover this app. But I just hope that this App Store do not become too big. Okay, so next we are going to do the Q and A. Let me scroll up in the chat. I forgot an announcement I forgot to make. So next week we are going to have a live training on smart contract audit. So this is really the highest pet skill in crypto.
00:27:45.634 - 00:28:21.170, Speaker A: If you know how to do smart contract audit, that's really where you can command the highest salary. So we are still finalizing the curriculum. We're going to send an email probably tomorrow about this. But yeah, just quick announcement here and then let's see which question we have tonight. We have HH Benquita. Hello. Constantin, Norway Nico, Oleg, Dave Shefford Greetings.
00:28:21.170 - 00:29:02.990, Speaker A: Javier Rabbik Julian, can I get your email? Something I want to contact and thanks. You can check in the description, you'll see my email. Dad, what do you think about KCC blowing up? Right now I know how to deploy any KCC token. What's KCC? Javi, how about voting in Testnet to make votes? Oh, I think you were talking of. Were you talking of the voting app for the ETB token? Yeah. So the voting app for the ETB token is going to be off chain so that it's free. We could have made it on Testnet, but yeah, I just decided to make it off chain.
00:29:02.990 - 00:29:45.310, Speaker A: It's going to use a signature just to make sure that the votes are authenticated. And maybe in the future we will migrate this on chain. But at the beginning I want zero friction. We have JSJ. What's up Julian? Hey, what's up man? JSJ is curve used through synthetics? I'm not sure what you mean. I think curve and synthetics have some sort of partnership, but I don't remember this exactly. Rabeg.
00:29:45.310 - 00:30:46.046, Speaker A: Guys, I want to fetch old pools from pancake using code. How is it possible? I'm not sure exactly what you mean by fetch old pool, but maybe you can listen to the events where new pools are created. Basically, the factory contract emits some events every time a pool is created. Software language tutorials can you give information about the use of binance API and operations such as wallet in Laravel or in a language? Okay, so you can use the Binance API regardless of which framework you're using. It doesn't matter if it's PHP or Javascript. Personally, I would recommend to interact with Binance API with node js because they have a library, but if you want you can use. But they have their docs already so they have some endpoints.
00:30:46.046 - 00:31:17.494, Speaker A: So this is really a classical API. Nothing tricky here. Tshx. There should be a mobile version of Axie Infinity. Yeah, probably as a game, it would make sense to me then. Abraham, how about Ave? I don't know. What was this question about? You should do a video about what's happening with Binance.
00:31:17.494 - 00:31:49.702, Speaker A: Legal issue. Are you allowed? Of course I'm allowed. I think last week we covered extensively all the legal issues of binance. Yeah. Mjs. Hello, everyone. What is your opinion on the Binance debacle this past week? Yeah, that mean, I do think in general, the american government is against Binance because this is not an american company and this is a big competitor to Coinbase, which just went public.
00:31:49.702 - 00:32:17.120, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's something. I've already said that a couple of months ago. I'm expecting a lot of shit going, a lot of problem going for binance. But at the same time, I would say that the team of Binance is really resourceful, so I also trust them to solve the problems. Then we have Kalil H. Hi, David Anderson. Still bullish long term on Matic, of course.
00:32:17.120 - 00:32:53.110, Speaker A: Kelly, why cannot add custom token in the new interface? What do you mean? Kadir Kevin Zhang. Hi, Julian. Have you heard of the energy Web foundation project and the crypto climate code? No, I haven't heard about this. But I know that politics start to criticize crypto more and more for their overall consumption of energy. It's kind of a tricky question. It's true. On the one hand, this is an important issue, but of course, for politics, this is a giant excuse.
00:32:53.110 - 00:33:31.170, Speaker A: Of course, when they criticize crypto for energy consumption. Of course they don't care at all about energy consumption. It's just because they're looking for any excuse to go against crypto. But anyway, I don't think they're going to be able to use this against crypto very long because more and more cryptos start to switch to a proof of stake. So, yeah, I'm not too worried about this. Kalil H on mew so minor extracted. Not sure what's your full question, Kalil? My ether wallet.
00:33:31.170 - 00:33:57.562, Speaker A: I don't use my ether wallet, so I can't help you here. Trend. Hi, Julian. Will central bank just adopt any existing layer one blockchain or they will just develop their own layer one? They will develop their own layer one because they want full control. Especially they want to be able to freeze people money. Yeah, that's the big thing, Mick saying in French. It sounds like a french accent.
00:33:57.562 - 00:34:28.554, Speaker A: Exactly. Bitcoin delight. Bitcoin will dump hard soon. Great scale about to sell. Where have you heard about this rumor? I don't think so iodeg, any information review on convex finance? I don't know this project. Sim Tamda, do you think it's a good thing to update the flash loan course into binance since binance have this? Yeah, yeah of yeah, I'm a bit late on this. I will update, I will try to finish this update this week.
00:34:28.554 - 00:35:20.614, Speaker A: But yeah, I mean Binance. I'm not worried long term, that will solve the problem. Abraham, best programming language for crypto or blockchain for smart contracts, solidity and for your front end JavaScript. Victor asks, which project do you think is a current leader for lending when using cryptocurrency as a collateral? It's basically between compound and Ave. It seems like compound at the moment they are doing less innovation on the protocol itself and they are more focused on other things. Like for example, they are building a new service to allow institutional to lend their money with fiat and basically they generate yield with the protocol. They are also working on their own defi chain.
00:35:20.614 - 00:36:07.706, Speaker A: So yeah, they're doing a lot of different things outside of their protocol, whereas Ave is more focused on just their protocol. Then Blablu is asking why I don't speak French. Well, because this is a channel in English. I might do a channel in French at some point, but yeah, the problem is the audience is much smaller in French. When you're a developer in general, you have to learn English. Like for all the language, for all the tech project, the best documentation, the best info, it's always in English. But it's not so complicated because we're not using complicated English for technical stuff.
00:36:07.706 - 00:36:48.340, Speaker A: We always use the same word for technical stuff, so it's not so difficult. Just Faizal is the ETH we talk on TWTR. I don't understand. Not sure what you reference the ETH, Reorg. I haven't heard anything about this. Rahul, is there any installment for your blockchain development course? Yes, there is. You can scroll down on the sales page and you'll find a link for that musical me saying in French, how are you? Hey man.
00:36:48.340 - 00:37:26.980, Speaker A: Jaguk. Grayscale unlock. Look it up. Okay, I'll look it up, but that's know because Grayscale is like one of the big crypto fund mjs. Do you think Kucoin eventually will be next after binance?
