00:00:08.520 - 00:00:30.580, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and defy. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. Well, actually it's eleven 08:00 p.m. Sorry, I'm a little bit late tonight and if you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host. And on either blocks I teach blockchain development.
00:00:30.580 - 00:01:07.000, Speaker A: Hi to everybody in the chat. So we have Nora Onshen, T. Samuels, George Eric, Crypto, Michael Jason Bourne, and quickly, quick mention to the upcoming airdrop of idoblocks. So if you're not aware yet, Idoblox is releasing its own token. So this is going to be used to vote for the content of idoblox. And in the future they're going to be many other features like staking and it's going to be used in other projects as well. So everybody can get some free token.
00:01:07.000 - 00:01:38.964, Speaker A: All you have to do is to register for the airdrop and after you have also to claim the tokens. This is going to be on binance smart chain. So you need an address on binance smart chain for this. So I put the link for the registration in the chat. So if you haven't registered yet, do it now. Very important, make sure that you control the private key of the binance smart chain that you use for the airdrop because you're going to need to send a transaction to claim your token. So you cannot use the address of an exchange.
00:01:38.964 - 00:02:16.672, Speaker A: It's not going to work. All right, so we're going to start with the price of ether. Where are we this week? So we have reached a new all time high, 2500 something. So that was absolutely amazing. Like a phenomenal bull market, like a straight line. And of course, usually when ETH pumps like this, after it goes down a little bit, so it crashed even below 2100. And so overall on the week we are flat.
00:02:16.672 - 00:03:17.080, Speaker A: But I do think now we've set a new precedent between 2003 thousand. So we're going to be back at 2500 soon. And I find this interesting tweet of Justin Drake on Twitter. So he is a famous researcher in the Ethereum ecosystem and he published a study saying that the combined effect of the upcoming EIP 1559 and the switch to proof of stake will produce more buying power than the deposit contract of ETH two and grayscale holding combined. So Yapi 1559, this is an upcoming change to Ethereum that's going to basically help to lock more ethereum, burn more ethereum sorry. And so I have a video on this and for the deposit contract of east two that Justin is referencing. So he referenced when Ethereum 2.0
00:03:17.080 - 00:03:47.650, Speaker A: was started last year. And so for this, the validators had to lock some ether, which basically lock away some ether for a long time, which prevent this ether from being sold in the open market, which is bullish for Ethereum. And about grayscale. So it's a big crypto fund that started by investing in bitcoin. And recently it also started to accumulate some. Yes. All of this to say that ETH is going to pump, basically.
00:03:47.650 - 00:04:45.024, Speaker A: All right, so next, what do we have next? Let's see what we have on the crypto market. So we set a new height because of the pump of ether of more than 60 billion this week and after it came down because of the market crash. But if you check out the number of ether that is locked, we keep going up. So now we are at above 11 million. So soon we will have more than 10% of the available supply of ether locked in DFI, which is really good. Then if we check out the top winner and loser for the DFI coin, what do we have? So the top winner is the coin of maker. So that's probably related to their recent vote.
00:04:45.024 - 00:05:26.688, Speaker A: So they voted recently whether or not they should ask a 16 z, which is one of the top investor, to be more involved in the governance of maker. But this proposal was rejected. So basically the community is very happy basically to work as a community without the influence of VC. Then what else do we have? Rari, which is an NFT marketplace, is pumping really nicely now. Ample force, the stable coin of. Okay, I'm getting confused here. Yarn finance, pumping a little bit.
00:05:26.688 - 00:05:53.924, Speaker A: The coin of Chainlink, the coin of harvest finance. And what else do we have for the loser? Okay, so SFI, Saffron finance. Yeah, Saffron finance is extremely volatile coin. Really? I don't really know how to analyze this coin. Polka starter. Wow, big drop this week. Yeah, so we heard a lot about Polkadot like a couple of months ago, but since then it's been pretty quiet.
00:05:53.924 - 00:06:27.584, Speaker A: We've heard other Ethereum killer, but not so much from Polkadot. Yeah. Then Dodo finance. Also big drop here, Kyber. It's weird because last week they've announced a new feature, so I would expect them to pump a little bit more zero x. Also it's a bit weird because they've just released their dao, so the token should pump as well. Okay, so next we're going to continue with the news of the various d five projects.
00:06:27.584 - 00:07:18.020, Speaker A: So first we're going to talk of ZK Porter. So there is a lot of debate in the world of the l two chain on whether optimistic roll up or zero knowledge roll up will be the best solution. So usually the trade off is that you always have to sacrifice some security if you want more scalability. And ZK Porter is a new technology for l two chain that allow you to do up to 20,000 transactions per second, to be compared with 15 transactions per second currently on Ethereum. And you can do this with more security than the alternative technical solution for l two chains. So for example, you will be able to trade on Uniswap with a transaction fee of about three cent. So this solution, ZK Porter, will be available on Zksync V two in six months.
00:07:18.020 - 00:07:54.300, Speaker A: So Zksync is an l two chain which is created by the same team, matter labs. So since l two chain are going to become so important, it's very important to follow what's happening with this new technical solution for l two chain. And yeah, probably we are just a few months away from a big migration from Ethereum l one to ethereum l two every week. We have so much news for l two. I'm really, really excited by this. Next, some news about gelato V two. So that's a new defi protocol to automate certain tasks.
00:07:54.300 - 00:08:50.072, Speaker A: So basically you offer some reward to execute some functions. It has several use cases like limit order dollar cost averaging for amms and aggregators, and also stop loss for liquidity provider, which allow liquidity provider to eject from liquidity pool when their implemented loss becomes too great. So the whole system coordinates a decentralized networks of boats. And there is a feature to prevent boats from front running each other, which is very important. So it's a little bit similar to another project called the Keeper Network, which is a project of Andre Kwanri, then some use from Zerox, which is one of the oldest decentralized exchange on Ethereum. They just released their DAO. So the DAO will only initially control the community treasury.
00:08:50.072 - 00:09:16.504, Speaker A: So it gives some extra value to the zero X tokens. That's why before I was a little bit surprised that Zero X decreased this week. Then some news from rebound finance. So this is an option protocol. And recently they launched a new product called Theta Vault. This allow you to sell covered calls and basically earn high yields. So covered calls.
00:09:16.504 - 00:09:57.432, Speaker A: This is an advanced strategy in the option market in traditional finance. And now it's available in DeFi, so only use this, if you know what you're doing, because this is really advanced, then Enzo Finance has raised a $5 million. So that's a new DeFi protocol to do some social trading on Ethereum. So that means you can create strategy or follow the strategies of other traders. That's a little bit similar to the set protocol. Then some news from DVIX. So DVIX protocol raised $1.5
00:09:57.432 - 00:10:43.190, Speaker A: million. This is a protocol that is building volatility indices for Ethereum. So for those who don't know, in traditional finance, the VIX index is an index based on the volatility of financial markets. This is often called the fear index. So when this is high, it means that markets are very volatile, options are expensive, and conversely, when the index is low, it means that options are cheap and the market becomes more stable. So this kind of index is not really used by retail investors, but mostly by professional traders and a big finance company. So this is the kind of infrastructure that is needed for derivatives in DFI and especially for options.
00:10:43.190 - 00:11:12.732, Speaker A: Then we're going to talk of Pendle. So Pendle is a new DFI protocol that raised $3.7 million. They are creating a market for yield derivatives. So yield derivatives are exclusively used by finance professionals to hedge some risk related to the change in interest rates. So these are the biggest markets in finance, bigger than stocks, foreign exchange, et cetera. So it has absolutely a huge potential.
00:11:12.732 - 00:12:03.596, Speaker A: So I'm not going to go into detail because it is quite complex, but basically the point is that this is the kind of necessary infrastructure that we need if we want to onboard really big financial institutions on DeFi. And that's really interesting to see so many derivatives project in DeFi. It really means that we're going to have a new phase of DeFi where we really have the big actors that need all this infrastructure. Next, some news from three swap. So they raised $3 million. They are building a cross chain aggregation protocol. So they will aggregate the liquidity on different dexes across different blockchain, like Ethereum and finance smart chain.
00:12:03.596 - 00:12:30.728, Speaker A: So we see more and more of this protocol that are crosschain. Then we're going to talk of NFT with meme V two. So meme is an NFT discovery and farming platform. So this project started as a joke last year, but it rapidly grew in popularity. The V two of the meme NFT platform was just released. So they now have a gorgeous interface. It's really beautiful.
00:12:30.728 - 00:13:21.000, Speaker A: They will soon be integrated on Alt, and they managed to get beeple on their platform, which I think is a huge win because Beeple is one of the most successful NFT artists. He recently sold the most NFT, the most expensive NFT ever for $69 million. Next, some news from Snowden. So Snowden just sold an NFT for about $5.5 million. It gave the proceeds of the sales to the freedom of press association. It's pretty nice when you see some people leveraging their reputation like this to do some charity donation to charity.
00:13:21.000 - 00:13:57.616, Speaker A: Next. Disaster girl. So this is an NFT sold for about $400,000. So this is like a meme which is often used on Twitter. So what is the story behind this picture? So I'm going to quote here. So four year old Zoe run to the burning house in her neighborhood in January 2005. Her dad was a few steps behind with a camera and quickly stamped a few photo of Zoe flashing a devilish green in the infino ablaze discovered by Internet konoa serves.
00:13:57.616 - 00:14:42.288, Speaker A: It rapidly spread to every corner of the world, becoming one of the most recognizable images of the 21st century. So it's the first time I hear of an NFT of just a regular picture without any editing. So it's quite interesting. Then we're going to talk of NFT burning. So digital artist pack has launched an NFT burning platform called Burn Art. So in some future NFT collection of this artist, you can only pay with an ash token. And to get some ash token you will need to burn some NFT.
00:14:42.288 - 00:15:29.480, Speaker A: So that means you will send your NFT and this NFT will never be available for anybody in the future. So the conversion rate between the NFT and ash token will be determined by some algorithm depending on the available supply. So the more NFT that are burned, the fewer ash everyone will get. Basically then we're going to talk of usps. So the United States Postal Service will soon get into NFT. So from what I understand, they will use blockchain to have some traceability in the chain of custody. So from the moment the mail is posted to the moment it's received, everything will be traceable on the blockchain.
00:15:29.480 - 00:16:19.490, Speaker A: And they will first offer the posters tokens exclusively for legal professionals and government agencies and they will later extend to the general public. So they reported a revenue of $73 billion from postage in 2020. So potentially there is a huge market for NFT here. Then we're going to talk of the Coinbase IPO that happened this week. So they just went public on Wednesday, if I remember well, they're becoming the first crypto company to go public so they went public for $100 billion, which is absolutely huge. And so early investor Gary Tan tweeted about how he turned $300,000 into 2 billion usd. So one of the best investment of all time.
00:16:19.490 - 00:17:12.400, Speaker A: And now you can see the price of Coinbase on Yahoo Finance. So the ticker is coin. And so you can see that the price went from about $400 something to about $331. So with so much cash, they will probably do a lot of acquisition in the coming years. So if you are a crypto entrepreneur, you could get a nice paycheck coming from Coinbase. Then some news from consensus. So they just raised $65 million from Wall street companies like JPMorgan, Mastercard and UBS, as well as some blockchain companies like protocol labs and the maker foundation.
00:17:12.400 - 00:18:35.660, Speaker A: So I quote, with this money, they're going to accelerate the convergence of DeFi and web3 application on Ethereum with enterprise blockchain infrastructure. So basically consensus products, they want consensus product to be the primary point of access to Ethereum for developers, enterprise and consumers, which makes Webster accessible and useful. So for your information, consensus owns major piece of infrastructure in blockchain like metamask, truffle, infura, but also some more enterprise product like codify and crorum. So I quote again, when we set out to raise around, it was important for us to patiently construct a diverse cap table consistent with our belief that similar to how the web developed, the whole economy would join the revolutionaries on the next generation protocol. So yeah, basically they want to have investors from really diverse background, both from blockchain and also from traditional finance. So I think it's a good thing that we see Wall street invest in blockchain companies because now they have an exposure to the upside of blockchain, which means that they will have a less incentive to fight so hard the fact that blockchain start to disrupt their own business. So we want Wall street to have a stake in blockchain.
00:18:35.660 - 00:19:17.008, Speaker A: Next, some news from Shisha Finance. So Shisha Finance, this is a mutual fund for DFI based in the UiE. So they just raised $9.4 million over two weeks in the token sale. So in terms of exposure you will get if you invest in this fund, this is a little bit similar to what you get with DeFi indices like the Defi Pulse index, but except that this project is a little bit more centralized which means that it will appeal more to mainstream users. Then some news from the defiant. So the Defiant is one of the leading newsletter in DFI.
00:19:17.008 - 00:19:53.444, Speaker A: They just raised $1.4 million from investors in the blockchain space. So the money will be used to build a data platform. And Camila Russo, who is the CEO of the Defiant, used to be a journalist in the finance industry working for big media companies. So she's really well connected. She also wrote a book called the infinite machine which basically tells the story of how Ethereum was created. Next, some news from VC investment in crypto.
00:19:53.444 - 00:21:05.020, Speaker A: So I find this interesting report, I quote, that say there were twice as many crypto venture capital deals larger than 50 million in the first quarter of 2021 than they were in all of 2020. So we have much more big deals, big investment this year. So when you have larger investment run, it means that the industry is getting more mature because we have companies that are getting bigger and need more capital. It can also indicate that there is some consolidation in the industry where smaller companies are getting acquired by bigger companies who need more capital for these acquisitions. So this is like a traditional pattern we see in all industries where at the beginning you have many small companies and later they are less but bigger companies. Then we're going to talk of regulation with this new publication about Token Safe harbor. So this is from haster mps who is, I think she is the big boss of the SEC if I'm not mistaken.
00:21:05.020 - 00:21:57.300, Speaker A: So basically this is a set of new proposals from the SEC to be more crypto friendly. So I quote the article. Earlier today I released on GitHub an updated version of the Token safe Harbor proposal. The safe harbor seeks to provide network developers with a three year grace period within reach understand condition they can facilitate participation and the development of a functional or decentralized network exempted from the registration provision of the federal security laws. Okay, so does it mean that during three years we are fine and then we go to prison? I don't know, but yeah. Anyway, it seems to be positive. Then some news from other blockchains.
00:21:57.300 - 00:22:38.824, Speaker A: So first from a binance smart chain. So pancake swap, which is a big decentralized exchange on finance, smart chain recently surpassed uniswap total value locked for the first time. So it hit yesterday almost $8 billion, which was about 100 million higher than Ethereum. So that makes the pancake swap the largest by asset locked. So pancake swap has grown very fast. It only had about $150,000,000 locked just three months ago. So it's like a phenomenal growth.
00:22:38.824 - 00:23:12.804, Speaker A: Very impressive. Then some news from another protocol on binance marching called Mount to mount, the developer of Pancake Bunny which is a Defi aggregator on binance smart chain so it's basically a little bit like yarn finance. It allow you to have the highest yield. They recently raised $1.6 million from binance labs. Still on binance smart chain. News from nerve finance, which recently raised $2 million.
00:23:12.804 - 00:23:44.236, Speaker A: So this is a decentralized exchange for stable coins on binance smart chain. So a little bit similar to curve finance, but on finance marching. So in the past week, their total value locked grew from 200 million to 600 million. So maybe one of the next big decks on finance smart chain. Then some news from Avalanche, which is one of the so called Ethereum killer. So how do you pronounce this? Ben key finance. Yeah, let's go with Ben Key Finance.
00:23:44.236 - 00:24:16.948, Speaker A: So Ben Key finance is a DeFi protocol on Avalanche, and they raise $6 million to build an automated market maker on avalanche. So yeah, I've heard a few good things on Avalanche recently. The DFI sector is growing. Next we're going to talk of Heco. So Mackiswap, which is the biggest decks on Heco, has raised $1.4 million. So these funds will be used to build a yield farming platform and automated market maker.
00:24:16.948 - 00:24:46.704, Speaker A: So Mackeyswap was developed by a cross chain Dex aggregator called Uni layer. And so Heko is an EVM based blockchain. So based on the technology of Ethereum. And that was launched by Huobi Exchange, which is a chinese exchange. Yeah. So I think that Heco is really at the very beginning of the adventure in Defi. Then some news from Solana, another Ethereum killer.
00:24:46.704 - 00:25:43.220, Speaker A: So step finance, which is a Defi project on Solana, raised $2 million. So this is a defi dashboard that allow you to manage all of your d five position on Solana from a single dashboard. So this is a little bit similar to instadap or Defi saver on Ethereum. Okay, so now we're going to do the Q a so quickly, I'm going to repost the link to the airdrop for the token of if you, if you're new here and you never heard of the upcoming token, basically this is a token that allow you to vote for the content of the blocks and the token is completely free. To get it, you just need to participate in the airdrop and basically give your binance smart chain address. So I put the link in the chat. You have until the end of this month to register.
00:25:43.220 - 00:26:09.880, Speaker A: Okay, so let me scroll up and go a little bit in the chat to see the question. Jason Bones, Julian said he will be late today. His tinder girl didn't leave apartment. Very good. All right, so th shakes. Hey, Juan Inaccio. Hey, Artemi.
00:26:09.880 - 00:26:20.192, Speaker A: Hi, Sudiza. Greeting lil guillotine. Hey, Kilber. Hi. From Brazil, Mayo Gonzalez. Thanks for your video, bro. Really helpful.
00:26:20.192 - 00:26:31.670, Speaker A: Thank you, Perminus. Hey, Gulab. Hi. Abracadabra. Hi, Richard. G. Hi.
00:26:31.670 - 00:26:49.416, Speaker A: Thx saying dead Mao five is about to raise an NFT called hypno currency. Wow. Interesting. Hi, Ayodegi. Pluto is asking me in French. I translate. Do you still offer the boot camp? Please let us know.
00:26:49.416 - 00:27:11.970, Speaker A: I have no boot camp. I have a course. So my main course to become a blockchain developer is a six figure blockchain developer. You can find the link in the description of the live stream. A question for Julian from abracadabra. Your opinion on safe moon safe BTC. I didn't have time to check it out, but it's noted for next time crypt technology.
00:27:11.970 - 00:27:35.224, Speaker A: What's up? Question for Julian. Where is the EIP 1559 standing now? I think it's going to be activated in the next hot fork, which is Berlin, so coming very soon. Llama six six. Hi. Fun time with meme coins today. Abracadabra. Question for Julian.
00:27:35.224 - 00:27:58.080, Speaker A: The rune protocol made cross chain between l one layer. Will that be a game changer? I haven't researched the rune protocol. I haven't researched that. Abracadabra. Gelato is late. They are working project which already work like Unilayer uni trade. Yeah.
00:27:58.080 - 00:28:23.044, Speaker A: Interesting that maybe I should do a video on all of this project where basically are there to sort of organize like automated tasks on Ethereum. Because this is something super important. This is related to front running. This is a big problem. Nora on chain, any binance smart chain news? Yeah, at the end of the. Just before there was a section on binance marching. Jason Porter.
00:28:23.044 - 00:28:55.172, Speaker A: Julian, I heard a bitcoin developer Jimmy song claiming that Ethereum is crap security wise. Because is touring complete? What do you think about. No, no, absolutely not. I mean, the fact is, Turing complete means you can run any computation, but you have to pay some gas. So your program cannot run forever. Yeah. No, the track record of Ethereum for security is great.
00:28:55.172 - 00:29:15.636, Speaker A: Like all the hack you've heard about Ethereum. It's not related to the protocol itself, but it's always related to bad programming on smart contract. But Ethereum itself was never hacked. Only the smart contract. Hi angu kristna. Hi constant. Hi, June.
00:29:15.636 - 00:29:40.370, Speaker A: Have you got an opinion on Dogecoin? It's just a joke, but as long as we have this bull market, it will pump with the bull market. But there is no fundamental on Dodge coin. So yeah, be super careful. Christian cakes. Hi. Abracadabra. Bought pancake swap for 70 cent and still having them.
00:29:40.370 - 00:29:56.132, Speaker A: Great. I do think pancake swap coins are really going to pump. Someone is asking voodom Luna terra. I haven't researched this. Ghetto finance. Hi Julian, everyone. We launched ghetto finance.
00:29:56.132 - 00:30:16.076, Speaker A: It will integrate blocks, token yield, farming and staking. Wow, this is great. Amazing. I just released the token of ewblox and already a lot of people come to me for. I'm super happy. Yeah, ghetto finance. Don't hesitate to send me an email.
00:30:16.076 - 00:30:31.910, Speaker A: Julian@edoblocks.com. And you tell me more about your integration. Super happy about it. Fox Raymond. Great token video, detailed tip on ledger. Okay. Not sure to get the question.
00:30:31.910 - 00:31:04.972, Speaker A: Jill. Hello from Cameroon. Hey Hnner. Hello Hatimon. Hello, Jason Porter. What do you think is the best way to get experience in Defi as a new blockchain developer? Well, that's to build your own Defi project. So the easiest is to build some sort of dashboard where basically you show some information about some Defi project.
00:31:04.972 - 00:31:34.712, Speaker A: And next you can do some project where you actually send transaction to the blockchain. So this is the next step. You can check out my course on Defi. That's called a D five mastery. That's also in the description of the stream. Jules, what do you think about API three? I'm not aware of this project. Jill, how long to be a blockchain developer? In 2021? I have a video about this on my channel.
00:31:34.712 - 00:32:22.180, Speaker A: So search how long to be a blockchain developer? But specifically it depends on your background. Can be anywhere from a few months to six months, one year. It also depends. What do you mean by a blockchain developer? If you mean a junior, of course it takes less time, but quite quickly you can get your first gig as a freelancer and from there you move your way up. And after you get a job, Constantin, I can see your DaP 30 quote on your website. Have you removed it? It's still available. It's just that it's not in a catalog because it's a little bit similar to another course I have, but just a slightly older.
00:32:22.180 - 00:32:46.764, Speaker A: I'll put the link so that you have it. I put the link in the chat to DaP 30 if you are interested. Okay, next question. Next question. Abracadabra. Thor protocol Crosschain swap. L one.
00:32:46.764 - 00:33:58.870, Speaker A: Okay, I not aware of the Thor protocol. So many stuff. So many stuff like I can spend the whole week preparing this live stream and still like so many things I don't know about this, it's crazy. Serenity source hi Jill, where to take some smart contract security course in DAP 30 there is a section on security but I'm going to have a new course that is coming out about advanced solidity and this will have a section on the security Fd Dodge coin got a strong community but not the best protocol and team. I don't know much about Dogecoin so I couldn't quite possibly comment domains feed did you plan to create a tutorial how to list a custom token in Polkastarter or similar platform? Yeah, maybe I'll do some tutorial on Polkadot. Yeah Cr developer hi, any recommendation to learn about smart contract security development? Yes, same answer as before. This will be in my course on advanced solidity, but in the meantime you can also check one of the bonus section of DAP 30 that I linked just before there is a section on solidity security.
00:33:58.870 - 00:34:35.568, Speaker A: Dylan have you looked into Solana smart contract? Are they different than if? No, if I'm not mistaken I think this is an EVM based blockchain. No? Yeah, I don't know much about Solana. Question for Julian abracadabra the that you are doing is it can't. I can't. I can't hide the fact that I was born in French. So even though I left France a long time ago, I still have a lot of mannerism. Okay, so I think we have no more questions.
00:34:35.568 - 00:35:19.452, Speaker A: So I'm going to copy paste the last time the link to the airdrop of the ether blocks token. So if you haven't registered yet, make sure to register. You have until the end of the month to get your free token. Oh, last question. Graphical bus do you know of any books for building cryptocurrency? Not on Ethereum, no. Building cryptocurrency, it's something that very few people do. So you don't really have tutorials about this? I do think you have some tutorials on YouTube to build your own crypto, but really at this stage I don't really see the value in creating your own cryptocurrency.
00:35:19.452 - 00:35:58.892, Speaker A: There are already a lot of them. Now you have to build on top of a crypto like Ethereum or like binance smart chain then. Do you have any course purely related to defi? Yes, it's called defi mastery. You can see in the description of this video. I released it a couple of months ago and I think this is one of my best course. Like absolutely everybody love it. Lil Gutin, do you think run state will be targeted for being a security in the USA? Well, I have absolutely no idea about this.
00:35:58.892 - 00:37:06.284, Speaker A: I heard that the fact to split an NFT into fractions could be considered a form of security by the SEC, but I don't know. Another question, Dylan, is my metamask address acceptable for the airdrop on binance smart chain if I have that network linked? Yeah, I mean, as long as you control the private key, which is the case on Metamask, you can use your ethereum address and that will work too. But just make sure to not use an address from an exchange like binance or Coinbase, because in this case, you don't have access to the private key and you cannot sign transactions. But you will need to sign a transaction to claim your token. First you register for the airdrop with the link I put just above. And then next month, you will need to do a transaction to the binance smart chain to claim your right. All right, guys, so I think this is it.
00:37:06.284 - 00:37:18.496, Speaker A: No more question. So thanks everybody for coming here, and I will see you later this week for other videos on my channel. Have a great day. Have a great week, guys. Talk to you soon. Bye.
