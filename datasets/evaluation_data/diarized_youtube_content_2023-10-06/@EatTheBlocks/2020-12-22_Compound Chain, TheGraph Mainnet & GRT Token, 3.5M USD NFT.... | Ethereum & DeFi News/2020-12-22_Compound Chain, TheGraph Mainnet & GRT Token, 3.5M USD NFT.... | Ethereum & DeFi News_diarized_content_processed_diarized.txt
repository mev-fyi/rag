00:00:06.420 - 00:00:28.680, Speaker A: You. We are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. But today, exceptionally, it's on Tuesday. But next week we're going to be back on Monday.
00:00:28.680 - 00:01:12.300, Speaker A: So in this video I'm going to be talking of compan, who is building their own blockchain, which is really big news. We're going to be talking of NFT, which are totally on fire this week with a record sale of 3.5 million. We're going to be talking of Dodo, which is a new kind of decentralized exchange with superpower, basically. And if you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host. And on my channel, idoblocks, I teach blockchain development. And quickly, quick mention to my new course, Defi development mastery, that I released yesterday is still hot from the oven.
00:01:12.300 - 00:01:30.864, Speaker A: So it's a course to teach you defi development if you want to build your defi project. If you want to become a Defi developer. Check it out. Hi everybody in the chat. Hi Agun Kankan Sven. Eric Black Love thx hi everybody. Sven's telling me the sound is great.
00:01:30.864 - 00:02:10.504, Speaker A: Thank you. Yeah, I know in my previous stream I had some problem with my sound, but fortunately we are back to normal. Okay, so let's check out the price of ETh. How are we doing this week? So it was a week with a lot of emotion because ether topped up at $650 or even more, almost 675, which is the highest since 2018. So it's really a big deal. Of course, you're probably aware also that bitcoin finally went through the glass ceiling at 20k. So now we're above twenty k for bitcoin.
00:02:10.504 - 00:02:45.652, Speaker A: And after for Ethereum, there was a pullback because we had the news about the news train of COVID in the UK. So it's kind of a global news and it spooked stock market a little bit, which had a ripple effect on the crypto market. But it doesn't really change the global trend, which is super bullish. Then what we have for the gas price. So gas price for the last week is here. So it's kind of stable but slightly going up for here. We have a spike.
00:02:45.652 - 00:03:16.710, Speaker A: So yeah, I predict that very soon the gas price will rise again. The decrease that we see now is just temporary. It's really temporary. Then let's see the situation for Ethereum 2.0. So how much money do we have? We have a lot of money in the deposit contract. So this is the ether that are locked for validators for Ethereum 2.0. This is just phase zero that has launched a couple of weeks ago.
00:03:16.710 - 00:04:02.210, Speaker A: So we have passed more than $1 billion worth of ether locked in the deposit contract. So a huge milestone. And now if you stake now, you will make about 11.7%. And the more people who stake then, the less the yield. Basically, if you're interested in becoming a validator, you can check out my other video where basically I do it a full tutorial to show you how you can set up your own validator node for Ethereum 2.0. Then let's check out the statistics for the beacon chain. So this is beacon scans, basically ether scan, but for Ethereum 2.0,
00:04:02.210 - 00:04:27.492, Speaker A: basically there are several chain in Ethereum 2.0 and the main one is called the beacon chain. So here you have the beacon scan. And here what's interesting to see is the network participation chat chart. So we want it to be as close as 100%. It means all the validators are running their software properly. But here we had some dip.
00:04:27.492 - 00:04:48.464, Speaker A: I don't know why we had also another dip here, but globally is going well. And here you can see the latest block. So here we can see the network is ticking. I think it's every ten second or something like this. We have a new blocks. Right now it's just empty blocks. But when the migration to Ethereum 2.0
00:04:48.464 - 00:05:30.430, Speaker A: will be complete, this will be blocks full of transaction here. Okay, so next let's see the price for defy token. So we have a nice 50% for Dodo Yuma, 34% this one MMCB, never heard of that one. PBC. I guess this is some sort of tokenized bitcoin like GenBTC synthetics here, 20% GenBTC, 20% rap bitcoin. And in terms of the loser, let me see how many loser we have also. Okay, so actually I think we have slightly more loser this week.
00:05:30.430 - 00:05:52.864, Speaker A: Duck, which is the token of the. Is it the duck token of Duck DL? I'm not sure. Idle finance here -50% cover. This is a token for options. We saw a lot of derivative defi project launching recently. Hacka Finance. This is a yield aggregator index.
00:05:52.864 - 00:06:21.810, Speaker A: The same saffron finance that was super, super volatile. Yeah, we have more loser than winner this week. Then the situation for, let me see, the defi market for the defi market in general. So in terms of total value locked. This is a new high. This week is much higher than one week. Ago.
00:06:21.810 - 00:07:23.072, Speaker A: So what's always interesting to see is the variation due to a change in the number of ether in DeFi, or is it because of the price of ether? So you can see this here. So we can see that the rise is not only due to the increase of ether, but also because more ether are coming back into Defi. So what happened a couple of weeks ago when we had the big decrease is that a lot of tokens were going to staking in particular and staking for ETH two, but as basically the yield reward for east two are going down. As we have more validator, then it becomes less and less interest, progressively less interesting for people to stake. So the appetite comes back for DeFi. Here, let me see. In terms of change for individual protocol, it's always interesting to see what moves a lot.
00:07:23.072 - 00:07:57.580, Speaker A: Like, do we have any big change with two digit Kyber? Wow. Kyber -20% so I don't know why we have this, but it's pretty bad. So, Kyber, it's this project. It was one of the earliest decentralized exchange, and it's kind of zero x. They never took off, really. It's a good project, but I think their design was a little bit more complex than uniswap, and as a result, the liquidity never really exploded. So 12 million is not great.
00:07:57.580 - 00:08:27.780, Speaker A: Really. They haven't done much progress this year in terms of market capitalization, but it seems like now they are focusing more on enterprise users. So they will probably do a pivot. Yeah, I don't think they will try to compete with uniswap. Really? And then who else do we have here? Any big mover? No, that was pretty much still. Yeah, DyDx also, this is a protocol. I would like to see them higher in the chat.
00:08:27.780 - 00:08:57.724, Speaker A: They really take a lot of time to take off. This is basically DuadX, one of the earliest really advanced Defi protocol. So recently we started to see a lot of derivatives, really advanced stuff. But actually, DYDX, they started to do this a long time ago. So, yeah, I really hope for them that they're going to take off one day. Okay. Now, what's really interesting to see also lastly, is basically the war between Uniswap and sushiswap.
00:08:57.724 - 00:09:36.844, Speaker A: So not so long ago, Uniswap was much higher. It was like maybe at almost 3 billion. But then the liquidity mining incentive stopped, and so we see a lot of liquidity that started to fly, to go out of eswap and back into Sushiswap. But now the Uniswap community is talking about reintroducing a liquidity mining incentive to fight back. So we're going to see what happens. But personally, I'm more in favor of Uniswap because this is the project that really introduced the idea of an automated market maker. They are the most serious one.
00:09:36.844 - 00:10:18.896, Speaker A: They are backed by VC, backed by the community sushiswap. I never really took them seriously. For me, this is the sushiswap is just a short term thing, really. Okay, so then situation on the rate, can we make money with interest rate, please? So dive 4% on compound, almost 5% for USDC tether most 5%. So on top of it, you also have the reward of the comp token. So you can add a couple of percent on top of this. Actually, for my course on defi development, one of the project, we're going to build a dashboard for compan where we show the APY, including the comp token.
00:10:18.896 - 00:10:48.900, Speaker A: So it's really good to learn how we can figure out the calculate APY in defi. Then here for USDC, 6% on average, pretty good. Almost 7% for USDC. On DYDX, it's pretty good. Okay, so then we're going to move on to the news for Defi project. So big, big news. The big news of the week is compound.
00:10:48.900 - 00:11:28.256, Speaker A: So compound, the lending platform, is planning to launch their own blockchain outside of Ethereum. And that's called the compound chain. So they are doing this to solve two problems. First, the high transaction cost on Ethereum, and second, they also want to have cross blockchain ability, which is not possible right now on Ethereum, of course. So this is really a big news because compound is really the project that kickstart the Defi summer craze. After they introduced the yield farming feature with the comb tokens. Before summer is really when DeFi started to take off like crazy this year.
00:11:28.256 - 00:12:11.240, Speaker A: And after we had many other projects that started to do some copy paste of this farming, liquidity mining. So they are really influential in DeFi and they have the ability to really take with them a part of the defi industry if they go to another blockchain. So I think this is pretty significant. So the new blockchain they want to launch, compound Xian, will have its own token called cash. And this token will be used to pay for transaction fees. This new token will be similar to Dai, so it's going to be pegged to the dollar. So it will be a stable coin.
00:12:11.240 - 00:12:56.360, Speaker A: And companchen will be governed by the compound. Governance structure that exists on Ethereum with the comb token. So the comb token took plus 10% after this announcement. That makes sense because that means this is an extra power for the holder of the comb token. They are building a testnet with some limited features implementation, and they are planning to do a release in early 2021. So although the price of token went up on Twitter, the response from the community was pretty negative because many people worried about the centralization risk of this new chain because it will use a POA consensus algorithm. So PoA means proof of authority.
00:12:56.360 - 00:13:37.524, Speaker A: So in other words, all the validator needs to be approved first. So we have the same problem over and over, which is if we want to have lower transaction fee, this will be at the cost of more centralization. So it's really difficult to have both decentralization and low transaction fee. And that's why Ethereum 2.0 is taking so much time. They're really working on a hard problem, but it takes time. So personally I don't like this initiative of compound because I would prefer that they build a layer two scaling solution for Ethereum, but not really a sort of competing blockchain for DeFi.
00:13:37.524 - 00:14:30.424, Speaker A: I think it's just going to fragment the ecosystem. I think they should do something which is closer to Ethereum. So yeah, we'll see what happened, but what is possible to happen is that another big d five project, like Uniswap or another one. I think what's going to happen is they're going to move to an l two solution, or maybe partially like Matic or something like this, and then we're going to see some traction in the community. We're going to see maybe two or three projects that go in the same direction. And then once we have a couple of DeFi projects on a side chain, then it's going to be network effect, everybody will follow. And so, yeah, I really don't think that in the end compan will be able to get any traction with the blockchain.
00:14:30.424 - 00:15:07.136, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think it's going to work. Then. Some news from Dodo. So Dodo token went up by more than 50% this week, so it's worth paying attention. So Dodo is a new kind of decentralized exchange. So why the token went up? So currently they have a liquidity mining incentive where basically if you do some staking, they do 100% staking. I don't know exactly what it means, 100% staking.
00:15:07.136 - 00:15:45.280, Speaker A: Does it mean 100% reward for yellow farming? But it's basically check out their liquidity mining program because I think it's quite nuts at the moment. And so they raised a $5 million in September with a private sale. Private sale means we don't know exactly who are the investor. But I read some rumors on Twitter that said that it's maybe Coinbase or finance who invested. I couldn't find a confirmation on that. But in any case, $5 million raise is good already, no matter if they have some prestigious investors. And so also they have a lot of news this week that can explain the token appreciation.
00:15:45.280 - 00:16:28.348, Speaker A: So they're going to launch version 1.5 next week, version two. So wow, they're really rolling that feature very quickly. What's so special about this new decentralized exchange? So first of all, it's supposed to have lower slippage. That means you can make bigger trade and you have a better price because they use a variation of automated market maker, which is called proactive market maker or PMM. Okay, so we have so many abbreviations in Defi. So we have Amm for automated market maker and now we have a new one, PMM.
00:16:28.348 - 00:17:19.952, Speaker A: So what's next? I think you know, if you want to create your defi project, you have to create a new abbreviation. Okay, very important. So for example, what about SMM for Soros market maker, you lose your money every time. So in their documentation they say it uses an advanced algorithm that use an oracle to compute the price. That's very different than normal Amm, like Uniswap, where the price only depends on the relative amount of tokens for the token pair. So I'll be curious to see this new PMM system in more detail. But potentially it can have a huge security vulnerability in the pricing formula because if the oracle is hacked, the pricing will be messed up.
00:17:19.952 - 00:18:07.724, Speaker A: And hacking an oracle, which is outside of the blockchain, is way easier to do than hacking a smart contract on the blockchain. So they will have to address this vulnerability. Another benefit of dodo is reduced impermanent loss. So impermanent loss, basically it means that if you are a liquidity provider in a decentralized exchange, you can lose money compared to just holding the underlying tokens. And so this is one of the big problem for decentralized exchange. And so Dodo said that they're reducing this. And also another big thing is that liquidity provider on dodo can deposit just one token, no need to deposit a pair of token.
00:18:07.724 - 00:18:40.332, Speaker A: You know, like if you want to deposit, if you want to be an LP on Uniswap, you need to deposit a pair of token. For example, if this is the market ether die, you need to deposit 50% of ether, 50% of die. But you might not want to take a double risk on each asset. So on dodo you can have a single risk exposure. And really that's a big advantage for liquidity provider. Okay, so next, moving on to tornado. So tornado cash.
00:18:40.332 - 00:19:21.540, Speaker A: This is the largest privacy solution on Ethereum. They allow you to trade tokens in an anonymous way on their sidechain. So someone made a proposal for decentralizing their governance by introducing a new token called ton T-O-R-N. So they will do an airdrop for the early users of tornado. So in the articles of four days ago, they said the airdrop is valid until block 11,400,000 something which is already in the past. So it's too late for the airdrop if you are not already a user of tornado. It was really for the early user.
00:19:21.540 - 00:20:08.568, Speaker A: And so besides governance, this token will also be distributed to liquidity providers as part of a liquidity mining program. So yeah, I mean if there are more demand, basically if there are more users that want to use tornado, then this token is going to go up. I'm pretty bullish for this token because I think the demand for anonymous transaction on blockchain is quite high. Then next news, this new project, DeFi triple seven. So I'm actually super excited about this project. I think this solve a very important issue. So it basically improved the user experience of Defi dapps a lot.
00:20:08.568 - 00:20:55.668, Speaker A: So with this project you can use any DAP without any DAP browser and that's really big. So first you need to wrap your tokens into dfI seven. Seven tokens. I love this name, like triple seven. It's like a Defi gem is born or something. So then once you wrap your token into this DFI token then what you can do is then you can basically how to explain this? You can trigger an action for your token by sending to an Ens address. Let me show you here for example here.
00:20:55.668 - 00:21:40.016, Speaker A: So you can basically interact with DeFi protocol by sending some asset to an EnS address. And this EnS address is connected to a smart contract that do some action like swapping on uniswap or something like this. So it's really another way to interact with DeFi. Basically it's like some sort of pre programmed action in smart contract that are accessible with an Ens name. Like a little bit like a URL. If you don't know what's Ens, this is ethereum name survey. This is basically a system that maps URL like this to addresses on the blockchain.
00:21:40.016 - 00:22:20.572, Speaker A: So potentially it's a radically new way of using decentralized application. It's very, very innovative. I think it came out of a hackathon and yeah, I'm really curious to see where it goes, but yeah, I'm pretty sure these guys will do well. I'm pretty sure they will find some investors because their id is really. Then next news, wrap finance. So wrap finance is a DeFi project that allow user to deposit crypto token in exchange for stablecoin loan. So this is a lending project and they were attacked by a flash loan.
00:22:20.572 - 00:23:05.008, Speaker A: They got stolen, 8 million. So from what understood from the hack, it's a classic case of rug pool. So basically the attacker used the flash loan to manipulate price of an asset that was used in the protocol. Thanks to this, they were able to trick their smart contract and withdraw more token that they should have. Yes. So another day, another flash attack. Now, almost every week we have some flash on attack in DeFi, then it is NFT time.
00:23:05.008 - 00:23:39.816, Speaker A: So a lot of news for NFT this week. So we're going to start with news from Nifty Gateway. So nifty Gateway is a marketplace for NFTs. And so last week there was a massive, massive auction of $3.5 million for 20 pieces of digital art with the most expensive one going for seven, seven, seven usd. So like almost 800,000 usd. This is the absolute record for an NFT auction.
00:23:39.816 - 00:24:33.950, Speaker A: The last record was 55,555 and $0.55. Hey, what's up with these weird prices in NFT? So the artist that sold this piece of art is called b people. And this is a very famous digital artist is this guy here? Right here. And yeah, look how he celebrated. Look how he celebrated. Wait, I'm going to get. Seriously, seriously, if, if I make so much money like this just by selling some digital art, I think I'll celebrate like this.
00:24:33.950 - 00:25:14.776, Speaker A: I was like, come on, what am I doing as selling blockchain courses? I should be digital artist doing NFT, right? Seriously, this guy made so much money and so quickly, look at what he said. Okay, so that's basically his description here. He said, bro, I just learned what the fuck is NFT two weeks ago. So he doesn't know anything about blockchain. I'm not going to act like I have a ton of intelligent shit to say here. This crypto space seems super interesting, though. I see a ton of potential to do some weird shit nobody has done yet.
00:25:14.776 - 00:25:37.312, Speaker A: Also, I'm not going anywhere. And I'm going to keep working my fucking ass to make anyone who didn't buy this now look like a goddamn moral. This is so crazy. It's like there's this random dude, like walking in the street and he's like, oh, where is this new thing? Crypto? Okay, cool. Let me do my little digital thing and boom, like $3.5 million. Come on.
00:25:37.312 - 00:26:23.404, Speaker A: Okay, to be fair, this guy is actually super famous. So, yeah, let me give you his resume a little bit. So, yeah, he has worked for Apple, he has worked for SpaceX, Nike, Coca Cola, do be, Pepsi, Samsung, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and many other. You also work for artists like Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber, Kate Perry, Eminem, dead mouth five, and many more. So really, I mean, this is like a major figure in the space. Of course, it's not like you can just show up and make the same. Still pretty inspiring.
00:26:23.404 - 00:27:10.316, Speaker A: So, unfortunately, I couldn't find the piece of art that is sold for 20 million. This is the collection called everyday something. But we still have some other stuff. So let's see quickly, because it's really crazy. All right. I mean, really, when you look at it, it really looked like there is a lot of work. Me and all.
00:27:10.316 - 00:27:52.892, Speaker A: You wanted to do this? How long would it take? I'm not even sure how to do this. I mean, really, that guy has some talent. So, yeah, it's really interesting. Then next, where are we going? We are still staying in the NFT space with Sorare, which is an ethereum based collectible game. They sign up Real Madrid and Jira Piquet. I don't know who is Jira Piquet, but probably someone famous in sports. So they sign up two big win for them in the same week.
00:27:52.892 - 00:28:36.644, Speaker A: So in this game story, you'll be able to buy some NFT about Real Madrid. So, yeah, I really think for games, doing things related to sports is clearly a big win. But for that, you probably need to have some relationships with people who manage the brand of these people. So clearly there is a lot of potential there, but clearly some big barrier to entry as well. Then I wanted to show you about this project called sweater. I'm not sure how to pronounce it. So this is basically an NFT minter.
00:28:36.644 - 00:29:01.440, Speaker A: So you create some design here. Let me see how it works. Let me show you my shitty design skill. Okay. Let me put some uniswap leak on here. Some Christmas tree, some Christmas trees, some dinosaur. Yeah, good to go.
00:29:01.440 - 00:29:19.792, Speaker A: Mint token. And can I change the price. I mean, seriously, this is worth 3.5 million. No. What do you guys think? I just need to put it on nifty giveaway gateway and I'll be like that guy. What was this guy name already? Gipple? Beeple.
00:29:19.792 - 00:30:15.700, Speaker A: Yeah, like beeple. It's so easy to make money, right? No, but seriously, this is a good idea for a simple project that I wouldn't say it's easy to do a project like this because, you know, there is a lot of time in a lot of things in the user interface, but clearly it's doable with one person probably like take one month, something like this, and I can totally see this kind of project taking off, the kind of project you can do a solo. I really like to see that kind of simple and useful project. Then we're going to talk of enterprise blockchain. So news with Microsoft. So Microsoft will use blockchain to improve its supply chain for SSD orders, shipments and all the stuff they deal with. They need all of this equipment for Azure.
00:30:15.700 - 00:30:51.252, Speaker A: And so they will use a private blockchain built on quorum, which is quorum, which is a blockchain based on Ethereum, also a private blockchain. So yeah, we can see some nice use case of blockchain for supply chain by a major player. This is pretty cool. Then here news from. Where is my article? Where is my. I mean, yeah, you can tell they have a really shitty website. This is the CME group.
00:30:51.252 - 00:31:33.410, Speaker A: This is basically a trading exchange in Chicago. They do a lot of future and they have a nice shitty website where we don't find the info we want. So basically they announce that they're going to do eth futures and it's going to launch February eigth and one contract is going to be equal 50 ether. So yeah, clearly it's not for small player. But now we start to see more and more enterprise and the corporate that holds some crypto. So these people also have a bigger need. So probably they'll be fine with that sort of size.
00:31:33.410 - 00:32:28.196, Speaker A: So it's nice to see more and more centralized finance, which is coming to integrate more and more blockchain stuff. Then we have Germany that announced they will legalize on chain securities. So I've talked about this before. I think that really what we're going to see happen is more and more security that are tokenized on the blockchain a little bit like we saw with wrapped bitcoin. Now we see more and more bitcoin traded on Ethereum instead of on bitcoin at some point, there might be the flippening. We will see more trading volume for bitcoin on Ethereum. I think in the future maybe we'll start to see some stocks also that start to trade on Ethereum, maybe some wrapped Microsoft stock or something like this.
00:32:28.196 - 00:32:47.780, Speaker A: And man, when we start to see this, this is it. This is the end of centralized finance. But it will happen. It will happen. I'm confident about it. Then news from Coinbase. Coinbase is going to do the IPO.
00:32:47.780 - 00:33:36.212, Speaker A: They're going to be basically a public company. And so they filed some document for the SEC, some draft registration. So I don't know exactly when is the IPO, but yeah, it's going to be a huge milestone for DeFi. It's going to be really the first, I mean, defi blockchain in this case, it's going to be really the first big blockchain company that does an IPO. And to the eyes of the public that really make blockchain looks more legit because IPO, you know, it's like something very high profile. So you don't really do IPO for things that are not really serious. So we're going to see really the media that start to change their narrative about blockchain and retail.
00:33:36.212 - 00:34:08.550, Speaker A: Accepting more and more than blockchain is the way to go. So next, some news for developers. So we have a new major version for Solidity 0.8. So yeah, new releases are coming really fast. I'm actually quite frustrated because I work so hard to keep my course up to date, and as soon as I finish a course, the team of three DT basically is like, oh yeah, nice job, Julian. Oh, sorry buddy, there is another version. Sorry, you have to restart everything.
00:34:08.550 - 00:34:45.520, Speaker A: I'm kidding. You know, like basically the release of solidity, they are largely backward compatible. But when we change the major version, which is the one in the middle, there are some breaking changes. So in this case, the main change is that we don't need the safe math library anymore to check for overflow or underflow. So not underflow, overflow, throw an error natively. And also some changes about how we deal with addresses. I will probably do a video about this new version of three DT later this week.
00:34:45.520 - 00:35:14.980, Speaker A: There is also a new version for three DT for the 0.7 branch, now with three DT 0.7.6. Then another news. So this time about the library ether JS, which is now more used than Webstery. So this is the JavaScript library to interact with Ethereum. This is an alternative to Webstery. Some developers prefer it to Webster because it has a more simple API.
00:35:14.980 - 00:36:01.380, Speaker A: And Ether JS was actually built by a developer who didn't like Webstery and wanted to improve it. I have a tutorial on ether JS if you are interested. Then we have a new multi testnet faucet of mycrypto. So my crypto, this is a website that is a wallet for Ethereum. They've been in the Ethereum community since the beginning, before it was part of another project, I don't remember the name, and the two co founder had an argument. So I think it was a male and a female co founder. And so the female went on to create my crypto.
00:36:01.380 - 00:36:52.532, Speaker A: But I mean she's really famous in the community, how comes I forgot her name? She's really famous. What's good with this faucet is that this is a multi testnet, so it's more convenient. However, you need to use an account hosted on my crypto. You cannot directly send the EtH to metamask. So yeah, this could not ideal then use about the graph. So the graph is a graphql API for querying data on Ethereum. And they've been online for a few years already, but they've just launched their main net and with this launch they're finally reaching the final stage of their development.
00:36:52.532 - 00:37:46.324, Speaker A: So the graph solves the problem of the centralization of Ethereum APIs like inferra. So even though Ethereum is decentralized, we lose some of this centralization, because most dapps use some centralized APIs like Infira to read data from the blockchain. If the data reported to the user is false, users could take bad decisions based on this wrong data. So with the graph, the idea is to have a decentralized network of computers that provide access to Ethereum. And we call these computers the indexers. There are currently 200 indexers, and since June, the usage of the graph grew very rapidly, increasing ten time from 1 billion monthly queries to over 10 billion this november. So really they're going through an exponential growth.
00:37:46.324 - 00:38:37.050, Speaker A: This is really crazy. The graph is already used by really very famous project like Curve, Uniswap, Decentraland, and they've already raised $20 million total from really top investor in the Silicon valley. At the center of their system is a token called GRT. And users of blockchain application pay some GRT tokens to access some blockchain data. And so these GRT tokens are paid to indexers to compensate them for their service. Indexer also stake some GRT tokens if they provide bad data, some of their tokens will be slashed. So the more dapps use the graph, the more demand we'll see for the here.
00:38:37.050 - 00:39:05.540, Speaker A: So you can see a nice increase of the. Okay, this is the price of GRT. So following the announcement of the main net, you can see a nice increase of the GRT token. Well, we had a pullback, but yeah, overall this is a nice increase. So I really love this project. I really love this project. They're doing a great job.
00:39:05.540 - 00:40:08.024, Speaker A: They built a very solid tool for developers. But the big question I have is who is willing to pay for just reading data? Because users clearly won't accept to pay directly. It's a little bit like when you go on your newspaper website and they ask you to pay to continue to read the article, nobody want to pay. So that means the companies behind blockchain application will pay for the users, but they will find a way to pass this cost to user of their Dap one way or another. So maybe we can have several tier of user for blockchain app in the future, like free tier where we use decentralized Ethereum API like Infira and paid tier for people who really care about more decentralization. And this paid user, their data will use the decentralized Ethereum API like the graph. Maybe this is an okay.
00:40:08.024 - 00:40:39.424, Speaker A: Okay, so now it's q a time. And so, yeah, reminder, this is my course on defi. So let's see if today, guys, please let me know if when I post a link in the chat, you guys can see it because yesterday, I don't know why YouTube did not let me post any link. So I've just posted the link of my course in the chat. Please let me know if you see it. Okay, so let me scroll up a little bit and see if we have any question. Let me see.
00:40:39.424 - 00:41:05.028, Speaker A: Hi, two people. Hi, Batman. Silky wizard. Dunamis, karim Jew. Llama th shx cryptocurrency, Ichun liao Jose. Okay, so, so let me see, let me see. Llama saying where that for Christmas.
00:41:05.028 - 00:41:44.470, Speaker A: Julian, I think you were talking of the thing I designed before with this sweater thing. Hi, Julian. What could be the advantage of learning smart contract programming on sidechain, xdichain, BSTC, et cetera. Yeah, that's useful. We're going to see more and more sidechain usage, but you have to know that most of these sidechain, they reuse the technology of Ethereum. So solidity, truffle, et cetera. So really there isn't such a thing as you learn smart contract programming in general.
00:41:44.470 - 00:42:09.870, Speaker A: So you learn this on Ethereum, and then you can learn the differences for the side chain. But the core skill is smart contract programming. There is nothing really too specific about sidechain. They just reuse everything from Ethereum. Okay, another question from Josie. Do you know which programming tool is used to program layer two technology? Zero knowledge roll up. Optimistic roll up.
00:42:09.870 - 00:42:40.048, Speaker A: I mean, nothing too different. This is the technologies of the web, like Javascript, Python, et cetera. There is nothing too special about it. ThX is asking. No, sorry, no question. Okay, let me keep looking for question Sebastian saying, hey, man, I really like your lives. Yeah, thanks, man.
00:42:40.048 - 00:42:59.836, Speaker A: Appreciate. Okay, well, I mean, we don't have too many questions. Oh, Barry is telling me that we see my link in the chat. Okay. Oh, my God, I hate YouTube so much. You know, like yesterday it was the launch of my course. It was so important that everything works fine.
00:42:59.836 - 00:43:16.500, Speaker A: And I don't know why. For the only time, since I do live for that time, especially the links don't work. But now, today, the links work again. I don't know what's wrong with YouTube. That's life. That's life. Okay, guys, so no llama is asking me a question.
00:43:16.500 - 00:43:53.312, Speaker A: Are you staking Ethereum two at the moment? No, I'm not. Because it needs to do some monitoring of the node. And really, I cannot do this. I'm already so busy with my course. Black love changes. Hey, Julian, can you tell me after using command line vim, how can I close the editor and open other folder? You know, this is so funny you asked me this because exiting Vim, this is one of the big problem for newbie who use vim. Okay, let me show you guys something.
00:43:53.312 - 00:44:13.396, Speaker A: You're going to laugh. Exiting Vim. I think there is like some meme somewhere. Oh, yeah, this one. Let me see. Yes, it's like a meme. Basically they made fun of the book of.
00:44:13.396 - 00:44:45.292, Speaker A: Really? They make fun of Vim. So exiting Vim eventually just memorize this faulting contextually, depending instruction. So, yeah, basically the short answer is first, you do escape. Okay. So you press escape several times to come back to the. What's this mode? Because, you know, there are three modes in Vim anyway. It basically bring you to the top mode of Vim.
00:44:45.292 - 00:45:11.850, Speaker A: And after you do column Q, or if it doesn't let you, you do column Q, exclamation point. It's going to do a false quit. Yeah, no, I know this is such a simple thing, but yeah, beginner really struggle there. You know what? Actually, you gave me an idea. I think I'm going to do a video. Seriously? Just about quitting Vim, exiting Vim. And I'm sure the video will do really well.
00:45:11.850 - 00:45:29.750, Speaker A: Okay. Joke, joke, joke. Okay, guys, no other questions? No? Okay, well, we are going to wrap it up here. Okay, guys, well, thanks for coming here. And I'll see you later this week on my channel.
