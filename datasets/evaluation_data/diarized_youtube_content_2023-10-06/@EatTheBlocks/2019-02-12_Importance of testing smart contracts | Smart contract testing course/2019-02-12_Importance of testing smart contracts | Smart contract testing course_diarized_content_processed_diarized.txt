00:00:00.330 - 00:00:42.630, Speaker A: In this video, I would like to explain you why you should care about smart contract testing. This video is part of a full course on smart contract testing on Edwox Pro. In this course, I'll teach you how to use the test driven development approach to develop your smart contract with the truffle framework. If you want to have access to the source code of the free episode, go to the website of Edoblox Pro and create a free account by clicking on sign up in a traditional web application. After you deploy your code to production. If there is a bug, you can always fix the bug in the code and redeploy your application on your server. How about smart contracts? Well, unfortunately, it's not that easy with a smart contract.
00:00:42.630 - 00:01:21.700, Speaker A: After you deploy it, the code is immutable on the blockchain, which means you can't change it anymore. This is very similar to what we see in the hardware industry where once you ship your device, its code cannot be changed anymore. For this reason, it's absolutely critical that you get it right before deploying your smart contract. You will not get a second chance to fix bugs. Our main line of defense against this is to make sure our smart contracts work properly by thoroughly testing them before deployment. This is what this course will teach you, so I hope that you realize the value will get of this course. Let's continue in the next video.
