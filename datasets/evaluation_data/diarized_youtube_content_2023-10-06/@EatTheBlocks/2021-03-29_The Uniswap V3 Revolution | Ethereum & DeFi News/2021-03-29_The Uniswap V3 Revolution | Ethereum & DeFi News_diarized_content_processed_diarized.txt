00:00:00.330 - 00:00:31.440, Speaker A: You and we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and defy. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. If you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host, and on my channel, itoblogs I teach blockchain development. And hi to everybody in the chat. Hi Antoine seeing make load.
00:00:31.440 - 00:01:37.556, Speaker A: So today I have a special request for you guys, because I would like to have a better system to allow you, the community, to vote for the content of eat the blocks. And so so far the process has been pretty organic, but also pretty chaotic, where people just randomly send me some emails sometime and just make some comments about the kind of content they want. But in the future I would like something a little bit organized. So that's why I've prepared this vote. So that would be really awesome. If you guys, after the live stream, if you could go on this link and vote and tell me basically what is this really long link, let me know guys, if you can click on the link for the vote and if you can access it. Right? So yeah, I would really appreciate to have your feedback on this.
00:01:37.556 - 00:02:26.020, Speaker A: It's super important because really if I can get the best feedback about what kind of content you want, then the channel is going to be way better. So let me know if you can see the link in the chat and if you can access it. All right, we're going to start with the ether market. So crypto markets went sideways this week, including Ethereum, which wasn't too bad considering that it was a really bad week on the stock market. And so today, at the last moment, we just had a really nice pump from ether. So we almost have no loss for this week for the ether gas price. The gas price is pretty stable, but on a high plateau, unfortunately.
00:02:26.020 - 00:03:16.612, Speaker A: And when it comes to the market cap of DFI, so it's a little bit lower than last week, but the number of ether that is locked in the system keeps going up. So we're going to soon reach 10 million ether. So that's the most important thing actually. Then when we look at the rate, so what do we have this week? So we have 17% for tether on compound. And the other very high figure I saw was SUSD. So the stablecoin of synthetics, which is at 15% on Ave. Then for the top defi coin of the week, let's see what we have.
00:03:16.612 - 00:03:48.748, Speaker A: So we have IDEX, which is back from the dead, the best performer of the week. So if you never heard of IDEX? It means you are new to crypto because IDEX basically is one of the oldest decentralized exchange. So at the beginning, IDEX was like, the interface was really terrible and the user experience was really terrible. But that's how I sold my first crypto bonus. That was in 2018. And now they've improved a lot. Now they have a whole KYC project.
00:03:48.748 - 00:04:27.550, Speaker A: So it's not really fully defi, it starts to become a little bit more corporate, but yeah. So this week their token, really boom, like crazy. Then we have trust swap. Really good week. The token of pancake swap also, then some token, I don't know, we have the token of the melon protocol, which has been rebranded enzyme, and it pumped because it did an integration with Ave. So that's basically with the enzyme protocol, you can basically create your own invest a hedge fund on blockchain. It's a little bit similar to the set protocol in that regard.
00:04:27.550 - 00:05:12.100, Speaker A: So we also have curve finance, which is doing really well. Who else? NFTX, which is an index for NFT. Actually, I want to buy some NFTx because that's an easy way to get some exposure to NFT without having to pick yourself all the NFT. And then when it comes to the loser, we don't have so many this week. So sushi, it's actually a pretty good buying opportunity for sushi because sushi is the number two decks on Ethereum and I think this is undervalued. Badger Dao, which is basically a project. They want to bring DFI, but via bitcoin on Ethereum.
00:05:12.100 - 00:05:46.284, Speaker A: This is quite special. Then we have uni -12% so this is a bit weird because uni just announced that they will release their V three. So normally it should go up. So I also think this is a good buying opportunity here. Okay, so next we will continue with the main news of the week, which is uniswap V three. They just announced their new version. So the big change in V three is something called concentrated liquidity team.
00:05:46.284 - 00:06:46.360, Speaker A: So liquidity providers in V three will be able to select their price exposure. So instead of just saying that you want to provide an amount of liquidity on top of it, you will also specify that you want your liquidity to be used only for a specific price range. And trading fees will only be paid to liquidity provider who have specified a price range that contains the current price. So a big advantage is that it's far more capital efficient, which means, in other words, that liquidity providers will get a higher return on their capital. Another big advantage is that liquidity provider will limit their risk of impermanent loss. So if you never heard of impermanent loss, it's a kind of risk that is specific to automated market maker and defi, where liquidity providers can lose money when the volatility is high. So usually impermanent loss is more than compensated by trading fees, but not always.
00:06:46.360 - 00:07:59.144, Speaker A: And you have tools like Uniswap ROI to help you evaluate this risk. So if we compare these to traditional exchanges where liquidity providers are actually called market makers, it's as if you place an infinity of limit order over a certain price range. And if any of these limit orders is executed, it updates the other limit order by subtracting the amount that was traded. So we have talk of liquidity providers, but what about traders who are the participant that consume the liquidity? So a part of the big improvement in capital efficiency will be passed on to traders with lower slippage, which means in simple terms, that they can basically, if they buy a large quantity, then they will have a better price. So Uniswap even claims that there will be less slippage than on exchanges focused on stable coins like curve finance. So this is a really big claim. So you have some really nice animation in the article of the official announcement to help you understand this idea of concentrated liquidity.
00:07:59.144 - 00:08:17.584, Speaker A: So they did a really nice explainer here. Animation here. Like another one here. So yeah, really nice job of uniswap. So they have an example that I find pretty useful. Okay, so let's explain. So let's say you have Alice and Bob.
00:08:17.584 - 00:08:57.836, Speaker A: They both want to provide liquidity on the ETH die pool on Uniswap V three. Each of them have $1 million, and the current price for ETH is 1500 die. So Alice decides to deploy her whole capital on the entire price range. So she deposited 500,000 die and 333 ether. So total is worth 1 million. Bob, instead create a concentrated position where he deposit only within the price range of from 1000 to 2000 2500. He deposit just a part of his money, which is equal to 1080 $3,000 and he keep the rest for himself.
00:08:57.836 - 00:09:50.288, Speaker A: And so he can invest the rest in any defi protocol he wants. So Alice has put more than five times the capital as Bob, but they will earn the same amount of fee if the east dice price stays within the 1000 to 2050 price range. So that show you that someone with much less capital can make the same amount of fee. So a consequence of this change is that position are no longer fungible let me see what you see. Yeah. Position are no longer fungible. So when you are a liquid provider and you invest in uniswap V three, and you don't get an ES 20 token in return, instead you get an NFT, a non fungible token that is completely unique to the price range of your position.
00:09:50.288 - 00:10:58.724, Speaker A: So that means that we will lose some composability because it will be more difficult to do some yield farming where you take an LP token from Uniswap and reinvest it in another defi protocol like you would do with AavE. For example. Currently you can take some LP token of Uniswap and put them in Aave to earn some extra yield. But this being said, even though in theory each LP can have an entirely 100% customized position, in reality it may be that we will see only a few standardized kind of LP tokens. For example, maybe that we will see some kind of dynamic strategy where the price range of a position is constantly readjusted at every block, depending on the current price of the asset traded. A little bit like sort of yarn finance specialized in Uniswap v three. It's possible that almost all the LP provider, all the liquidity provider of Uniswap in the future will use this service instead of directly investing in Uniswap.
00:10:58.724 - 00:11:38.260, Speaker A: So in this case, we could still have some form of composability. So another change is the fee system. So in Uniswap v. Three, we will have three possible fee zero point five, zero point three percent, and one percent. So pools with non volatile asset like stablecoins will have the lowest fees, whereas pools with the most volatile assets will have the highest fees. And so this will help to compensate liquidity provider better based on the risk they are taking. If they are providing liquidity for volatile assets, it's no more that they have higher trading fees.
00:11:38.260 - 00:12:37.264, Speaker A: Another more secondary improvement is for the oracle. So with the new oracle in Uniswap V three, it will be far easier to build advanced trading indicators like simple moving average, exponential moving average, et cetera. And even though the oracle is more advanced, it will consume 50% less gas compared to v two. Next very important detail. So Uniswap will protect the innovation with a two year business source license to prevent forks and so called liquidity vampire attack. So normally that means we shouldn't see a ton of forks like sushiswap, but at the same time, I don't really know how they can enforce this license because we are talking of smart contract and decentralized application. So the only centralized part would be probably they can act on the DNS of some of the front end for this folk.
00:12:37.264 - 00:13:41.760, Speaker A: Like if there is a fork that violates their license, maybe they can attack the DNS provider and say that they cannot provide DNS service for this project. I don't know, but I think they're going to have some challenge to actually enforce this license. But we will see in terms of launch date. So it will be launched on Ethereum testnet in the next couple of days and it will be launched on Ethereum main Net on May 5 and it will be launched on optimism shortly after. So optimism, which is an l two scaling solution on Ethereum. All right, so what do I think of all these changes? So first of all, I was really impressed by this new system of concentrated liquidity that was really refreshing to finally see a true innovation in DeFi instead of just another copy and paste of some existing DeFi protocol. So Uniswap was the protocol that first introduced the concept of automated market maker and now they introduced another innovation in deFi.
00:13:41.760 - 00:14:55.830, Speaker A: So this is a true financial innovation right here, and it didn't exist anywhere else in DFI, but also in the financial world. So it's pretty amazing for developers. This also brings a lot of opportunities. So since Uniswap V three is more complex, few user will use it directly instead to be an LP on Uniswap V three, most user will use other protocols built on top of Uniswap. So as blockchain developers, this is a great opportunity for Dfi. It will be super positive because it will make decentralized exchanges even more competitive compared to centralized exchanges because now we'll have even lower slippage and even higher capital efficiency compared to before inside Defi, it will help Uniswap to consolidate its position as the first DfI exchange, especially in front of Sushiswap for Ethereum. Since Uniswap will launch on optimism as well, which is one of the leading l two scaling solution with cheap transaction fees, this could really reverse the trend of assets leaving Ethereum for binance smart chain so in May, Ethereum will be back guys.
00:14:55.830 - 00:15:43.916, Speaker A: So if you want to play around with their smart contract, the code is available on GitHub. The documentation for V three is partially released and like I said before, they will soon have a release on Ethereum public testnet. I will also probably do a video for Uniswap V three for developers, but I just want to make sure that they have finalized the code and nothing will change. Yeah all right, so next we're going to talk of the hop protocol. So this is a bridge across l two on Ethereum. It will allow you to move a token from an l two chain to another one. It will integrate with optimism, polygon, xdine and arbitrum, which is l two that I didn't know, it's not yet launched.
00:15:43.916 - 00:16:14.264, Speaker A: So yeah, this is going to be very useful. And now, so the l two chain on Ethereum are becoming more and more needed. And so this will improve the user experience. We really need both the developer tool and also the user tools to be much better for l two. So this is a step in the good direction. Then we have this new project called the Shutter network. So that's a project to fight front running on Ethereum.
00:16:14.264 - 00:16:54.440, Speaker A: So it works with a system of encrypted transactions. And it's interesting to see that we have more and more attention that is given to front running on Ethereum. There is this new term that has came up, it's called Mev miner extracted value. And so now there is a whole part of the industry that is focusing on this problem. So after the scaling problem, I think this is one of the most pressing problem we have on Ethereum. And so if we can solve the scaling problem and the front running problem, it will make Ethereum the first blockchain for Defi again, that is for sure. Next we're going to talk of the hack of the week.
00:16:54.440 - 00:17:26.444, Speaker A: This happened on binance smart chain for total deck. So this is a decentralized exchange on binance smart chain. So $2.5 million were stolen in BNB token. That was a rug pull, which mean the scammer pull out the liquidity and took off with the money. So their telegram, the website and Twitter were deleted and people were really pissed because the smart contracts were audited by a security company called Tech rate. But they totally missed the potential for a rug pool.
00:17:26.444 - 00:18:13.824, Speaker A: Yeah, there are a lot of scamming defi, but in particular on binance smart chain. So you got to be really careful when you invest in your project. Okay, so then we're going to talk of NFT with people, which is the most successful NFT artist. He sold an NFT at a record of 69 million a few weeks ago. And so he converted his earning of $53 million into ether right away from ether to hot cash right away, because he was scared by the volatility of ether, which I think is fine. He's not really a blockchain guy, he's more of an artist. So he's not comfortable with crypto.
00:18:13.824 - 00:18:43.144, Speaker A: That's fine. But after he said that NFT is absolutely in a bubble, I don't see the need to criticize NFT. Just after he made so much money from them. It almost made him look like a scammer just saying that. So, I mean, maybe he didn't think much when he said that, but, yeah, that wasn't really smart of him to say that, really. And I don't know if NFT are in a bubble right now. I mean, this is a new way of rewarding artists.
00:18:43.144 - 00:19:16.184, Speaker A: We will see another NFT from John Rees, who is one of the actor of Monty Python. So he sold an NFT of the Brooklyn bridge. And so the biding start at $100, but he said that you can have it right away if you pay 69 million. Yeah. Let me see. This is on openc. What's the bid right now? Okay.
00:19:16.184 - 00:19:51.564, Speaker A: Yeah, about 40k. Interesting. Yeah, I wouldn't buy it. All right. Then another NFt of the Time magazine, which is doing an NFT for some of the most famous cover they did. So I have to say I don't really get it because they can already sell their physical magazine. So I don't really see the point of them doing nft of the magazine because for artists, NFT makes sense because you have a lot of artists that aren't really able to monetize their work, but with time, they are supposed to be able to sell their magazine already.
00:19:51.564 - 00:20:19.804, Speaker A: So, yeah, I'm not in favor of NFT for the Time magazine. Then another NFT that sells for a lot of money. So that's an ad for uniswap. And this sold for $500,000. I think we do have a video somewhere. Let me see. Where do we have the video? Okay.
00:20:19.804 - 00:20:47.620, Speaker A: I lost it. I thought we had a video somewhere. Yeah. So that's not a beginner artist who did this. That's someone who already had some brand recognition in the industry. She already worked for Batman versus Superman and Wonder Woman, and she also did some stuff for Diablo four of Blizzard. So, yeah, that's not a beginner.
00:20:47.620 - 00:21:19.100, Speaker A: Then we're going to talk of something really cool from very nifty. So very nifty. An NFT project just introduced an NFT flash loan. This is the first time I hear about this. So you can borrow one of them of their 18,000 NFT. And one of this NFT is hash mask, which is a collection of NFT by 70 artists. So if you hold one of the NFT, you are rewarded with some NCT tokens.
00:21:19.100 - 00:21:43.652, Speaker A: So the team of very nifty made a profitable NFT flash loan by borrowing some hashmask NFT. Then they claim their NCT token reward. Then they reinburse the NFT flash loan. And finally they sold the NCT token. So that's very interesting. Currently the flash loan are free, but that won't last. They will add a fee in the future.
00:21:43.652 - 00:22:35.748, Speaker A: So I'll probably do a tutorial on that later because I think this is super cool. So what's interesting with NFT flash loan is that it's very new and probably too small for professional arbitrary and liquidators at the moment. So if you start to study this now, I do think you have a chance of making money with NFT flash loan, but it will probably not last. You will probably become more competitive in the then still in NFT. So there was a hackathon just for NFT. And so you can check out the winners of this hackathon if you want to find some inspiration. If you are a builder and you want to build something in the NFT space, and if you are a developer and you like one of their project, you can always send them a message and say that you want to help and maybe some of them are hiring.
00:22:35.748 - 00:23:16.080, Speaker A: You never know. Okay, so another important news is that I think that Openc raised, I think, 24 million. So you know, Openc, which is basically the leading marketplace for NFT. So yeah, it's really good to see them raising so much money. And that's really a sign that VC are taking the NFT industry very seriously. Then we have another money raise. But I think I also missed the link.
00:23:16.080 - 00:23:47.784, Speaker A: So that's blockchain.com also raised $300 million. So blockchain.com, that's one of the leading wallet for bitcoin, one of the leading blockchain explorer also. They were one of the first one, basically one of the first wallet. I think they existed since like 2013 or something like this. It's one of the first crypto company and I think they were initially funded by Roger Vere, if I'm not mistaken.
00:23:47.784 - 00:24:36.668, Speaker A: And so for the story, I met their CEO, Peter Smith in 2017 in London when I was getting started in the crypto industry. And so I had a job interview there. And so, yeah, I met at some point for the interview, I met with their CEO and they have a pretty cool office in London, but in the end I didn't work for them. So yes, that's for the. Then, then what do we have next? We have news from Visa who just announced that they will accept USDC to settle transaction on their network. And they just performed the first test transaction on ethereum. So it's going to help a lot to make stablecoin more legitimate in the business community.
00:24:36.668 - 00:25:14.132, Speaker A: That's very. Then. Then news from the OKX exchange in Korea, which is going to close because the new anti money laundering regulation make it too expensive to operate an exchange. But they still have some other location. So it's always a bit sad to see regulation killing some crypto business, but fortunately, we haven't seen this yet happening. For Defi, next, some news from Ray Dalio. So, Ray Dalio, he's a legendary investor.
00:25:14.132 - 00:26:27.040, Speaker A: So he thinks that even though bitcoin has proven itself, it's still very likely that governments will end up banning it like it banned gold. So that's something that very few people know, actually, gold was a ban in the US in the Great Depression because people were selling fiat money for gold as the value of fiat kept falling. Owning gold was forbidden in the US until the 70s. Yeah, well, I mean, I know that some governments, like India, are thinking of banning crypto, but I really doubt some western government, like the US or Europe, will outright ban crypto, because I think crypto is slowly infiltrating the business community, and I think at some point it will become too politically costly to ban crypto. So even though this is a scary prospect, I don't think this is going to happen. All right, so next we're going to talk of bitcoin with Fidelity, who apply for a bitcoin ETF in New York. So we already had some bitcoin ETF approved in Canada before this year.
00:26:27.040 - 00:27:00.408, Speaker A: And in New York currently, we have four or five applications at the moment. So fidelity is a full part of Wall street, really part of the establishment. So if there is a company that can get its bitcoin ETF approved, it's them, really. And on top of it, everyone is expecting the SEC to approve the first bitcoin ETF this year. So, yeah, it's probably a matter of months now before we get the first bitcoin ETF in New York. And, yeah, it will be super bullish for bitcoin. Next, some news from Tesla.
00:27:00.408 - 00:27:42.360, Speaker A: So, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, announced you can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin. And he also said that they won't sell the bitcoin. They will hold on to them. So, yeah, very, very bullish because there will be some bitcoin that will be locked, basically for so. But it was a little bit worrying that he didn't pump the price of bitcoin this time, because usually any announcement of Elon Musk about bitcoin is really bullish. So yeah, it's as if the market had too much good news in the past few weeks and now, like a drug addict, when you take too much drug, it doesn't do any effect. So yeah, a bit strange.
00:27:42.360 - 00:28:14.480, Speaker A: Then we're going to continue with some news for developers. So open Zeppelin. The library for solidity has just released is version four, and it now supports solidity 0.8. Next, some news from remix, the IDE for solidity. So remix now has workspaces. So that means you have one file system per workspace. So it's better to work on separate projects.
00:28:14.480 - 00:28:43.308, Speaker A: So I've been using remix since the beginning and these guys have done a phenomenal work. They just kept improving, adding feature all the time. These guys are really doing a great job. Next, I wanted to show you this new framework for blockchain devs. It's called use Dapps. So it's a new front end framework for decentralized application. It has some very useful react component for Dapps, like components for tokens, and it also keeps the front end up to date.
00:28:43.308 - 00:29:33.976, Speaker A: So I would put it in the same category as drizzle, another front end framework for DAP, and it was created by the creators of Waffle, which is one of the most popular testing library. Then I wanted to show you this news about Curl. So if you never heard of Curl, that's basically a command line tool that allow you to do some HTTP request. It's used by many entities, many people across the web. I think there is a figure somewhere that said that it runs on 10 billion machine or something like this. 10 billion installations. The guy who created Curl, he wrote this blog to talk about how he created Curl and the experience running Curl.
00:29:33.976 - 00:30:41.120, Speaker A: And there was one statistic that I wanted to show you guys to make a comparison with blockchain. So since the beginning of Curl, which is 23 years old and used by the entire web industry, there were only $4,400 payout in bug bounties. I don't know if you realize, but that's so tiny for a tool that is used by the entire industry. But in the blockchain industry, even for the smallest project, if you go on a gitcoin and try to see how much money was given to their project as grant to fix some bugs, it's going to be much more than this. At least $10,000, $20,000 so it's really telling that in crypto, a project like Curl have so much less money than many, many blockchain project that are way smaller than Curl, that I really show you the power of blockchain, the fact that we have so much more money than other niche in the tech industry. So yeah, let's be grateful of this. Let's be really grateful.
00:30:41.120 - 00:31:21.320, Speaker A: All right, so we're going to do the Q and A, but just before I want to tell you quickly again about this poll I am doing. So basically I want to improve the way I select the content for the YouTube channel of eat the blogs. I want basically a system of Feedback where you guys tell me what you want. Basically, I will make some proposal and maybe there will be a new vote each I. So there are different possibilities how we can implement this vote. So please go on this link and vote. It will just take you literally 1 minute.
00:31:21.320 - 00:31:40.448, Speaker A: So I just put the link in the chat. Let me know if you have any problem to access this poll. But it's very important. Yeah, so please send your vote there. All right, so let me go up in the chat and see which question we have. Hi, Fadul. Hi tshx.
00:31:40.448 - 00:31:56.760, Speaker A: Hi Mohammed. Hi, Freddie. Hi Singh. Tracer or ledger, which one is secure? Both of them are secure. Really? Hi. Abracadabra. Hi, Javier.
00:31:56.760 - 00:32:21.490, Speaker A: Hi, Fox. Uniswap V three is not exciting. Ethereum is only for whales. We are normal users. Yeah, but when uniswap V three will be deployed on optimism, finally normal people will be able to use Ethereum again. Iodgi is saying uniswap v three plus eip 1559, supposedly. You mean that you will solve the gas problem? Well, part of it, yes.
00:32:21.490 - 00:32:54.712, Speaker A: All right, let me see. What do we have after this, Fox, Raymond? How about 1 April Ethereum miners attack? Oh, I haven't heard about this. Is it the thing, really? Abracadabra? Ethereum miner can't even reach 51%, so it's not even a threat. Okay. Thx it's almost spring break. Yeah, well, no spring break this year with COVID unfortunately. Abracadabra.
00:32:54.712 - 00:33:10.512, Speaker A: Question for Julian. Visa announced they will settle USDC transaction over ETH. Will this pump should. It should. I mean, eth pump just today. So I don't know. I think visa made the announcement just today.
00:33:10.512 - 00:33:21.104, Speaker A: So. Yeah, it could be the reason of the pump of today. Yes. Lo partage de savoir. Hello, everyone. Hey, man. Fabio Olivera.
00:33:21.104 - 00:33:45.208, Speaker A: Hey, bro. Learning a lot with your video. Keep rocking. Thank you. By the way, have you been successful doing flash loan in binance smart chain. So me, I don't run my own flashon because I'm too busy to do tutorials, but I have a video on flashon on binance smart chain. And so it's between bakery swap and pancake swap, which are both fork of Uniswap.
00:33:45.208 - 00:34:05.990, Speaker A: So it simplified the arbitrage because this is the same interface for the two protocols.

Absolutely. Fadel not sure what an ETF is exactly.
00:34:05.990 - 00:34:53.670, Speaker A: That's an exchange traded fund. So it's basically how to say, it's a way for a finance company to make themselves available to investors with a stock. So let's say you're a hedge fund and you won't allow retail investor to invest in your hedge fund. It's not really doable to do an IPO and to issue a stock like a huge company would do, because an IPO is very costly. But they can create one of these ETF. With this mechanism, retail investor can access their trading strategy. Basically.
