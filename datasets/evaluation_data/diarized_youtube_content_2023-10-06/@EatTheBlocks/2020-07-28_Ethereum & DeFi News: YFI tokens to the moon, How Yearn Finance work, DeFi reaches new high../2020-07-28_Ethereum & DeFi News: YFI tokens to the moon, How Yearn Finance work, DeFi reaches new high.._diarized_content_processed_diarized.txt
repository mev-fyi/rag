00:00:05.290 - 00:00:33.462, Speaker A: And we are live. Hi, everybody. Hi, this is Juliet, and you are here for the latest news on Ethereum and defi. Is the sound okay? Everything is fine. If you can hear me, let me know in the chat. So we're going to start with the prices of ether. So we had a huge increase in the price of ether this week.
00:00:33.462 - 00:01:06.340, Speaker A: We are at 330 something. So that's really nice increase compared to one week ago. And that was largely fuel because of the increase in defi. So that's really sweet. So let's see the prices on the defi front. So on the defi front, the market cap has increased a lot. So we are at 3,000,000,066 now.
00:01:06.340 - 00:01:33.980, Speaker A: We took like 18 months to go from zero to 1 billion, a couple of months to go from one to 2 billion, and from two to 3 billion. That was even faster. So defi is very much on steroid at the moment. That's really insane. You learn a lot of things one week and you think you've learned everything. And no, the next week you still have tons of projects. I mean, this is really hard to keep up, even for me.
00:01:33.980 - 00:02:04.334, Speaker A: So on the rate front, let's see a little bit the situation. So for die last week we were at roughly 6% on Ave. So it came down a little bit. The spread between Dai and USDC has widened a lot. So clearly Defi preferred to have some dai. And there is a reason for this, because Dai is more decentralized, as we saw a couple of weeks ago. With a stablecoin like USDC, you can have centralization risk.
00:02:04.334 - 00:02:57.646, Speaker A: Like there was an event where they seized the stablecoin of some address, or probably they did something wrong. But that's really why people prefer die. Apart from die, I don't see any really interesting rate, except maybe USDC on combined 3.7%. That's nice. But the rest, it has really came down since the beginning of the craziness of yield farming. So on the front of the defi, token prices, surprisingly, we are down for a lot of token like Compoundi, ample force synthetics east land. However, there is one token which is up like crazy.
00:02:57.646 - 00:03:35.858, Speaker A: And that's why I don't know how to say this one. Wifi. Yeah, you can say wi Fi. So that's the token of urine finance. And later in this video, I'm going to talk in more detail about this project, because I think that's really one of the most exciting project in DeFi right now. What do you think, guy? What is your favorite Defi? Project, this token, it was launched at roughly like $30 a couple of weeks ago and now it's something like close to 3000. So I mean, just huge return.
00:03:35.858 - 00:04:40.930, Speaker A: So that's absolutely insane. So now we going to continue with the news about blockchain and Defi. So big, big news is the banks in the US, they can offer a crypto custody service, according to the regulator. So before we only had a company called Gemini or Coinbase will offer this service, but now banks will be able to hold the private key for digital wallets. So that's bullish for the adoption of blockchain because you have a lot of institutional investors, like really big companies that hold a lot of money that don't really feel comfortable holding on to the private keys. So if they can give this to banks, that can really help to develop, to really increase the adoption of blockchain for really big company. So we should see this as a good news, even though personally we probably don't want to give up private key to banks.
00:04:40.930 - 00:05:18.974, Speaker A: But if big companies want to do it, that's cool. Then another big news is the Winklevos Gemini. So that's the exchange I was talking just before. They're going to offer custody of crypto blockchain domain. So for this we need to first understand two things. So Gemini and the blockchain domain. So first, as I was saying before, Gemini, this is a crypto exchange that has a service called Gemini custody where they can hold the private key for your crypto assets.
00:05:18.974 - 00:06:23.746, Speaker A: And there is another service which is called unstoppable domains that allow you to buy domain name that are written, that basically are stored in the blockchain. So they implement this with an ERC 721 token. The way it works is the domain is stored inside the yash 721 and it points to a hash, to a hash on ipfs. So it's fully decentralized. The ownership of the domain is decentralized and also the content is also decentralized on ipfs. And so now Winklevos Gemini, they can keep the custody of your crypto blockchain domain. So instead of holding the private key yourself of your domain, then you can give it to them for individual user.
00:06:23.746 - 00:07:03.538, Speaker A: That's probably not useful. But again, for b company, for enterprise, that's something that is really interesting because big companies, they don't really want to have this responsibility of holding private keys. So pretty sweet stuff. And by the way, if you never check that unstoppable domain, check it out. It's really sweet. If you want to do a fully decentralized website. Next, there was a big news, the rate of return like skyrocketed to 50%.
00:07:03.538 - 00:07:28.874, Speaker A: So that was on Ave. So that was really insane. And that actually prompted the mechodio community to increase the selling for Ethereum. So it's basically the maximum amount of Ethereum that can be hold as a collateral to mint some new dai. So that's been increased to 220,000,000. And that's because there is this huge demand for Dai. So that's pretty cool.
00:07:28.874 - 00:08:01.506, Speaker A: That's been that Dai is really popular. Everybody want a piss of it. Next new. Okay, so I think I'm done for the news about blockchain and defi. So now we're going to see the news about development. So first I saw this tutorial about testing Ethereum spot contracts. So this guy, Ben Hosser, I don't know how to say his last name, he's really into Python on blockchain.
00:08:01.506 - 00:08:48.050, Speaker A: So on his tutorial he teaches how to test smart contract with Bronnie. So brawny, this is a, let me see here. I mentioned Bronnie. So Bronnie, this is a python framework for developing spot contract, and that integrates really well with Viper, I believe. So if you are really into Python and you want to do blockchain, then that might be an interesting tutorial. Then another cool stuff I saw was edge toil to create an EF 721 token factory with webflow. So first, what is webflow? What is that? Hero so webflow, that's a visual tool to build websites.
00:08:48.050 - 00:09:40.934, Speaker A: So if you want to build a beautiful website, static website, and you want to do it quickly, then you can use this tool and dab. Hero, this is a tool to create decentralized application really easily. So it basically produces some HTML with some special code that is transformed by some Javascript. It looks a little bit like angular. So you can see it as a tool framework to build decentralized application in a simple way. And so what they did is they created a template in webflow for their tool. So now you can go to webflow, import the template of Daphero, and super easily create a decentralized application.
00:09:40.934 - 00:10:18.110, Speaker A: And so Daphero show you how to do this. So if you are into visual tools and you want to learn how to create a dapp super easily, and you're not really technical, then that's really a really good thing for you. Next, I wanted to talk about this project, create it app. I think I mentioned it before. So this is a Cli tool to very easily create some template for projects. This is basically based on create react app. So if you're familiar with this other project which is super popular for creating very quickly react application.
00:10:18.110 - 00:10:54.830, Speaker A: So with create it app, you can create the skeleton of a decentralized application. So that's super sweet. And recently they added some update. So now let me see, I wrote this somewhere. So now with this tool, what you can do is they added ether js, they added Makerdio, Kyber synthetics and uniswap v two. This tool is becoming better every week. So that's super sweet.
00:10:54.830 - 00:11:46.174, Speaker A: Okay. And lastly, I wanted to do a deep dive on this project, urine finance. So the token, I told you before, Wifi, this is the governance token of this project. So this project allow you to maximize the yield on your crypto assets. So if you have some Dai, some USDC, you want to invest them somewhere, but you don't really want to bother to try to understand, try to research which yield is the best, which project is the best. You just want to invest in one smart contract and have people do and have the smart contract automatically allocate to the best project. Then this yearn finance is going to do this for you.
00:11:46.174 - 00:12:30.854, Speaker A: So let me show you how it works. So 1 second, I'm changing window property diagram. All right. Okay. So this is a little diagram that I prefer for you guys. So I'm going to explain how I earn work and also how this is connected to the Wi Fi token. So that's super important to follow because Wi Fi is really the big thing right now in Defi.
00:12:30.854 - 00:13:02.194, Speaker A: So step one, you are going to invest your token into I earn. So for example, you have some dai or some USDC. So I think they only support some stable coin. So invest them in I earn. And I earn is going to allocate your token to the project with the best yield. So if this is compound, this is going to provide liquid to compound. And you also have other protocol, I think you have four or five other DeFi protocols and in exchange you're going to have a y token.
00:13:02.194 - 00:14:01.894, Speaker A: So if you invested Dai, this is going to be Ydai, if you invested USDC, this is going to be YUSDC, et cetera, et oh, by the way, so you may wonder, okay, once you invest once how this is rebalanced later? Well, every time someone invests in I earn, then automatically everything is rebalanced. So if another person maybe one block later invest in I earn again, then I earn is going to calculate what's the best yield. And if this is the same project where it already has all the token, then it just does nothing. It just leave everything in. For example, let's say we had everything in compound. DT just leave everything in compound. But if it figured out that now the best yield is from, for example Uniswap, then in this case he remove all the token from compound and invest everything in uniswap.
00:14:01.894 - 00:15:13.150, Speaker A: So you don't have to do anything, the protocol will reallocate the funds automatically. And second step two, once you have your wide eye or YUSDC, et cetera, you're going to invest in what we call the white pool. So the white pool, this is a pool of white token inside the curve exchange because curve Phi, which is another very popular project, this is done by the same author as I earn. So you invest your wide eye in this pool and in exchange you get a Y curve token. And so first of all, by investing in this y pool, you get some reward, I believe you get some crv token, which are the governance token for the curve exchange. And on top of it, of course, you get your Y curve, that this is basically the proof that you invested your ydai inside this pool. And after step three, you are going to invest your Y curve into wifi staking.
00:15:13.150 - 00:15:49.254, Speaker A: And so in exchange you're going to get some wifi tokens. And so with this wifi token you can vote on the I earn protocol. So don't be confused. Like the curve token, this is for curve finance and wifi, this is for I earn finance. So two different project, even though they are built by the same guy. By doing this you get some really nice yield and the whole operation is really beautiful because first if we just recap everything here, because you invested, you die here. So you get an optimal return on investment.
00:15:49.254 - 00:16:38.422, Speaker A: Then here step two, so you make some trading fee because you invest into this y pool and you also earn some curve token. And then step three, you also make some money with the wifi tokens. So yeah, I mean this is like a really great example of a yield farming. As always, this stuff is risky, so don't do it. If you guys aren't sure of what you're doing. The smart contract can have a bug. Some situation might appear that basically make the whole investment go in a bad direction.
00:16:38.422 - 00:17:14.310, Speaker A: So be super careful with this. So now we're going to go on to the question. So we have Perry Arskai, Johnson mega Montana. Okay, what's up bro? So do you think Cosmos or Polkadot will take a responsible market share away from ethereum? No freaking way. Just no way. Ethereum is just like gone so far. I just think these other projects that try to take some market share from ethereum, this is almost like cute at this point.
00:17:14.310 - 00:17:51.842, Speaker A: Really. I mean with Defi, with everything that's going on. No, there is no way. RF Skycar hi Julian, could you recommend something how to deal with high transaction fee madness from time to time? This is not profitable to move a swap asset inside defi space. Yeah, I heard about something called defi dao. So this is a DAO that aggregate liquidity from many different sources and that invest in some DeFi project. But because they invest in a large chunk that make it more interesting.
00:17:51.842 - 00:18:30.106, Speaker A: Like let's say they invest, I don't know, like $100,000 and the transaction fee is just ten or $20. Even though for a normal person that would be crazy. For the 40 ao that's still acceptable. So you might look into this. Otherwise what you can do is you just check ethgastation info and at different time of the day and when you see the gas is going down and boom, you invest. Also, if you invest higher amount, that can make the transaction fee more acceptable. Other question, Johnson lie.
00:18:30.106 - 00:19:39.602, Speaker A: I use Cheetokun help to save a bit of gas on one inch. Okay, well this is a good tip. Well, I didn't know you could save some guys with cheat token mega Montana, what's the bro? What do you think of engine development and ERC 1155? Yeah, I already covered ERC 1155 in my series on Ethereum tokens. I think that in some cases that might make sense. So I was working on this project for a customer on prediction market on ignosis, and we're trying to build a sort of meta token that sums up different bets that were related. So we use ERC 1155 in this case. That can be useful if you're trying to make, yeah, you're trying to make different investment, but that are somehow related and you want to sell this investment or you want to package this investment in a single container.
00:19:39.602 - 00:20:08.398, Speaker A: So in this case, the ASU 755 is great. And of course for gaming that's also great. Could you make video explaining proof of work versus proof of stake and Pom? I don't even know what Pom is. Yeah, I could do this. Yeah, it's a good suggestion. Yeah. Are you guys interested in I earn that? I explained before because I didn't see any question on that.
00:20:08.398 - 00:20:51.486, Speaker A: I mean, that's really the big thing right now. Like Wifi token is just like, it's the big news of this week, so I was a bit surprised not to see more interest on that. All right, guys, well, if that's all the question now, I think we're going to wrap it up soon. Oh, some question coming. Will participating in liquidity pools cover fees in some swap? Well, yes, but it's very difficult to answer in the general. You got to see with a specific example. But for sure, if you invest just $100 with the current gas fees, I don't think that's going to be really interesting.
00:20:51.486 - 00:21:25.080, Speaker A: So probably you need to invest at least, I don't know, like a couple of least. Yeah. When wifi rewrite return, it's still been quiet. Are you still staking in those pools? No, I haven't been staking there because I was too busy studying everything. But I should invest some because I think the wifi craziness is going to end soon. So. Yeah, I think most of the token appreciation is probably passed at this point.
00:21:25.080 - 00:21:40.010, Speaker A: Pom is proof of make. Okay, interesting. It's so many proof of something. That's cool. All right, guys, well, I think this time this is it. No more questions. Thanks for participating.
00:21:40.010 - 00:21:55.690, Speaker A: Betting and yeah, put in the chat or in the comments like what kind of project you want me to talk about next time, what kind of topic. That's super important to get your feedback right. Thanks guy. I'll see you soon on my channel. Bye.
