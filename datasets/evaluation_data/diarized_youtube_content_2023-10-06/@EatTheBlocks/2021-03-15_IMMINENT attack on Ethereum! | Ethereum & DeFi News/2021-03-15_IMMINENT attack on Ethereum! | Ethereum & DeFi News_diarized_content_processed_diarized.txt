00:00:07.290 - 00:00:35.382, Speaker A: Live welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. And if you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host. And on either blogs I teach blockchain development. And if you want get started in the DFI industry and find your first DFI job. I will do a free live training this month on March 23 at 11:00 p.m.
00:00:35.382 - 00:01:02.894, Speaker A: UTC plus eight. And for that you need to register to get started in Defi. I put the link in the chat. Okay, so last time YouTube censored my own link, so let me try to find a trick so that it doesn't do the same thing. Okay, let me know guys, if you cannot see the link. But yeah, I think I managed to trick YouTube. Hi everybody in the chat.
00:01:02.894 - 00:01:32.326, Speaker A: Abracadabra K. Foshman, ThX, Tucano, Espurao and FD. Hello from the US. Hi everybody. All right, so we are going to start with the price of ether. What's going on? What's going on this week? So we had a lot of hope this week. We thought we would go over two k, but it just fell short of our expectation.
00:01:32.326 - 00:02:13.078, Speaker A: We almost believed it and now we are back to square one. But at least that's nice. Like we had a nice pump. So yeah, we're all expecting to pass two k very soon. Also with bitcoin pumping at course it help and in terms of the gas price. So we've stabilized the situation, but still pretty high, still around 100. Gray and the big news for Ethereum this week is that this article that was published by Vitalik Buttering, which basically said that the merge with ethereum 2.0
00:02:13.078 - 00:02:36.794, Speaker A: could happen way faster than anticipated and it could be a matter of months. So that means in a couple of months Ethereum could switch to proof of stake. That's totally crazy. We thought that would happen in one year or even more. So that wouldn't be the final merge for ethereum 2.0 at this stage. It would just be the validation that happened on the beacon chain.
00:02:36.794 - 00:03:24.670, Speaker A: But we still wouldn't have all the different charts, so Ethereum wouldn't be scalable yet. So why this happened? It's because miners recently threatened to make a 51% attack on Ethereum. Yes, Ethereum. Miners said that is really, really crazy. Meaning that they basically threatened to mine a different version of Ethereum that's different from the one all the community agree with. It's because they disagree with the upcoming EIP 1559 update, which will reduce their fee of about 30%. So I've made a video about EIP 1559 last week where I said that I won't cry on miners because they made so much money recently.
00:03:24.670 - 00:03:51.910, Speaker A: In February, they made something like $1.4 billion. It's absolutely insane. I think this is really a game of chicken. You know, like when there are two cars who drive into each other and the last one who swerve off the road is a chicken. I think the miners can really afford to play this game because the community has the power, the users have the power. In the end, miners don't want to mine a coin that has no value.
00:03:51.910 - 00:04:27.170, Speaker A: They don't want to be like a bitcoin cash, so they can say whatever they want, but I think they will surrender at the very last moment. White flag, you will see. But in any case, I think this is actually, I love how the Ethereum community managed to turn it into something positive by making this merge with Ethereum 2.0 faster. So it could actually be bullish for the price of ether. All right, so next let's see what's going on with the market cap on DFI. So we haven't broken yet the all time high of about 40 billion that we reached last month.
00:04:27.170 - 00:05:00.234, Speaker A: But in terms of ether that is locked in DFI, it's really nice to see that we keep having more and more ether. So the total number of coin on Ethereum is about 110,000,000. So we are approaching 10% of the total market value of Ethereum, which is locked in DFI. So that's a very important metrics. And now we have more and more project that are worth 1 billion or more. So yeah, we have more than ten project over 1 billion here. So it's really nice.
00:05:00.234 - 00:05:36.582, Speaker A: And very soon we're going to have our first protocol at 10 billion. All right, so then let's talk a little bit of the rate this week. So it's pretty boring, except for dive 15% on Ave, 10% on DYDX, USDC 8% DYDX. But tether companion is pretty boring. Nothing crazy on the rate this week and for the price of the dfI token. So we have a lot of green and not a lot of red. So it's a really good week.
00:05:36.582 - 00:06:10.994, Speaker A: Let's see, what do we have here? The keeper network, 60%. What else do we have? Balancer, who is doing really well, 30%. Acropolis here, 30%. And how about the loser who is losing this week? So I don't know this project, I guess this is on finance. Smart chain saffron finance -30% saffron finance is just so volatile. It's like one week it's up, the other week is done. Yeah, trustwap here -30% almost creep finance uni is done.
00:06:10.994 - 00:06:44.522, Speaker A: Oh man, I want to buy some uni. So maybe a really nice entry point here. All right, next, I found this interesting comparison on Twitter. So the whole of DFI is currently valued at 85 billion, but this is to be compared with 100 billion dollar for Coinbase. And it really doesn't make any sense because either Coinbase is overvalued or DFi is undervalued, or both. But this really show you the upside potential we have for DFI. DFI is worth many, many times Coinbase then.
00:06:44.522 - 00:07:19.122, Speaker A: I really enjoy this article. The case for a $100 sushi. It's an interesting analysis that show you that sushi should be worth $100. And it's kind of funny because I was just thinking that sushi was an interesting coin last week. It's basically the more decentralized version of Uniswap, but without VC only governed by the community. It had a rough start last year with the drama with one of the founder who took all the money and after who brought it back. But it got better in the meantime.
00:07:19.122 - 00:08:06.338, Speaker A: And now it start to be more respected in the DeFi community. And now its market cap is still quite low, especially when you compare it to uniswap. And in the last 30 day it only increase of 22%, which is considered low in this crazy defi bull market. So personally, I see a lot of potential in the sushi token and I'm pretty interested in filling my bags with some sushi. Then we going to talk of specific news about DFI project. We're going to start with Ajan. So Arjon, which is one of the most popular DFi wallets, announced a plan to move to an l two chain.
00:08:06.338 - 00:08:45.566, Speaker A: So since Arjun is a wallet, they should support as many l two chain as possible. And long term it's their plan. But in the short term, they will focus on l two chain that use what we call Zk roll up. So there are several technology for l two chain, and Zk roll up is one of them. And specifically, Arjun is going to focus on an l two project, which is called Zk Sync. And they motivate the choice by saying that Zk sync has been live for months with a low transaction cost and fast finality. So yeah, I've seen a couple of projects announced that will go on Zksync.
00:08:45.566 - 00:09:39.562, Speaker A: And one interesting technical detail is that Zksync use a programming language called Zinc and they have a nice documentation. So if Zksync start to be popular, it might be interesting to check out this zinc language then some news of Maker Dao, the creator of Dai. So they said that they will release a bridge for die and other Ethereum token into optimism. Optimism, which is another big l two scaling solution. So with their bridge, basically you'll be able to move your die token back and forth really easily. Currently, optimism requires a seven day lockup period when you withdraw your token back to Ethereum. So with this bridge of Maker, it will reduce this lockup period a lot and will allow almost instant withdrawal of Dai.
00:09:39.562 - 00:10:25.562, Speaker A: So we do need this kind of big improvement in terms of user experience if we want layer to chain to start to have some serious adoption in the ecosystem. And when we start to have some adoption for l two, it means that Ethereum is back in the game for DFi. And it would be much harder for other chain to just do a copy and paste of Ethereum and just say, oh, we're the new chain for defi. No, not so fast, not so fast. And for your information, synthetics, which is another big d five protocol, is also working on an integration with optimism. So it's really one of the l two that is getting some serious traction at the moment. All right, so next we're going to talk of degenerative finance.
00:10:25.562 - 00:11:18.718, Speaker A: Degenerative finance is a partnership between Yuma and Yam Finance, and they are launching a stock index that will track the sentiment of the Wall street bet community on Reddit. So the index will feature the ten most bullish stocks according to Wall Street Bet. It will be available as a token on Ethereum in their project degenerative finance, early users will benefit from substantial liquidity, mining, reward and some NFT as a bonus. So guys, I think it's very important to give some context here and to give some credit. So I, Julian, was the first one who show you how to track the sentiment of Wall street bet Reddit here on my channel. Okay? So very important to mention it. Yeah.
00:11:18.718 - 00:11:59.214, Speaker A: So later, check out this video if you want to build your own index like Yuma and Yam Finance. Actually, this video I've made on Wall street, but it was one of the most popular video I've made for my channel. So yeah, it's pretty sweet. Next, so interesting stat here for Wrap BTC. So 1% of the supply of bitcoin is now tokenized on Ethereum. That's a growth of 100 times from 100 million to 10 billion in less than a year. So it really show you how Ethereum is like a liquidity black hole.
00:11:59.214 - 00:12:28.326, Speaker A: It attract everything in its wake. And we will see more and more people realize this. We will see more and more of this synthetic token on Ethereum. And I can't wait the day when we will see some synthetic stocks on Ethereum. This day will come and it will be really big. Then some news about stakewise, which is a protocol to easily stake on Ethereum 2.0. They announced that they'd raised $2 million.
00:12:28.326 - 00:13:13.398, Speaker A: So compared to other staking solution, they are more decentralized, they are governed by a Dao and they have some tokenomics with their swice token that basically is used for governance and that also share the staking profit. That's interesting because you stake on e two, but the problem is you have to wait before you can use your eth two ether. But with their system you can start to enjoy your staking profits right away. So I think this is something very useful then. Block Phi news for Blockfly. So this is an app to earn some interest on your crypto. And they just raised 350,000,000 from vcs for a valuation of 3 billion.
00:13:13.398 - 00:13:36.606, Speaker A: So just to be clear, this is a centralized project. It's not really pure defi, but you can get interest on your crypto there. And they kind of look like Robin Hood, but for crypto. Yeah, I had no idea they were so big. Yes, $150,000,000. Wow. Then we're going to talk of some hacks.
00:13:36.606 - 00:14:12.330, Speaker A: So this week, Dodo, which is a new kind of decentralized exchange, has been hacked for $2 million. It was done using a fake token attack. I never heard of this before. You know, it's what is funny with hack is like every week you get a new hacking technique. So once again a flash loan was involved, then another hack for roll who was hacked for 6 million. So their hot wallet, which has $10 million was hacked. So if you never heard of a hot wallet, this is based.
00:14:12.330 - 00:14:51.894, Speaker A: So usually crypto projects that are centralized have a system where they have two wallet, a cold wallet which is not connected to the Internet, where you store most of the user phone, and a hot wallet which is connected to the Internet where you have less user phone. But this is like a burfer that you need to have for your. So roll is a project to help creators to monetize their audience by creating their own coin. It's not NFT. It's different. It was created a few years ago before the whole NFT thing happened. And so they announced that they will provide $500,000 compensation for the hack.
00:14:51.894 - 00:15:27.910, Speaker A: But I really fall short of the $6 million that were stolen. Then we going to talk of NFT with people. So the most expensive NFT sell of all time happened with $69 million. It's also the third highest sale of an art piece by a living artist. It happened last week at an auction of Christie's. And this $69 million will be paid in ether. So it was a collage of five.
00:15:27.910 - 00:15:55.566, Speaker A: Let me see, where do I have the. Oh yeah, I have it here. This is a collage of 5000 digital creation. And the artist is called Beeple, which is an american artist that we started to see a lot in NFT. He already made the news with some big NFT sale, but this time it was really, really crazy. And so the buyer is anonymous and goes by the name of Metacovan. I love this name.
00:15:55.566 - 00:16:38.902, Speaker A: It's very cryptopunk. So Metacovan is an NFT whale who already bought a lot of NFTs before and is the backer of Metaperse, a fund that collects NFT to put on display in a virtual museum. It's a really interesting concept. The website of Metaverse described Metacovan de Bayer as an entrepreneur, a coder, an angel investor in the blockchain technology. A coder in blockchain? Could it be? Then we're going to talk of NBA top shots. So NBA top shot is one of the top NFT project. Even my roommate bought an NFT top shot.
00:16:38.902 - 00:17:07.454, Speaker A: So I mean, this thing is really going mainstream. So last week, users complained of some delay to withdraw their funds. And one user in particular got blocked because he tried to withdraw his funds too many times. Super weird incident. So he took it to Twitter and started to question whether NBA Topshot was solvent or not. So dapper Labs, which is the company that manages NBA Topshot, responded and they finally unlock his account. And if you never heard of daplabs.
00:17:07.454 - 00:17:37.470, Speaker A: So they are the creators of cryptokitties, which is one of the first blockchain game who became really popular in 2018. So the moral of this story is be careful when you use services that you don't control, where you don't control your private keys. Which is the case of NBA top. Yeah, not very then still in NFT. So Linsel Lohan, the famous american actress, is selling some NFT. Do I have an NFT somewhere. Yes.
00:17:37.470 - 00:17:51.186, Speaker A: Here. Yeah. It's not the level of people. It's not the same level. And currently the highest bid is $16,000. That's it. It's not even a million.
00:17:51.186 - 00:18:17.834, Speaker A: Wow. So cheap. So cheap. All right, so next, NFT, Taco Bell, the famous restaurant in the US, released their own NFT with mixed reaction on Twitter. Very mixed reaction. So I can see NFT being popular to finance artists, but for super big companies, I don't think it's as appealing really. But, yeah.
00:18:17.834 - 00:18:41.022, Speaker A: Nice try, Taco Bell. Nice try. All right, so next. Next, we're going to talk of regulation with Bill 38. So Bill 38 was introduced in January to give company status to daos. It just passed another big step, but it still has a long way before it becomes a low. So this is really groundbreaking.
00:18:41.022 - 00:19:28.638, Speaker A: This is really where crypto meets the real world. So that would mean that creating a legal company would be as simple as creating a dao on ethereum. And that probably means we need to make the company status evolve because maybe in this dao you don't really have a CEO. So that means, yeah, we really need to innovate on the definition of what is a company. And I feel like it's almost too good to be true. So I'm super excited to know what's going to happen with this bill because it could set an amazing precedent and other states could start to copy next, news from the IRS. So we're going to talk of operation hidden treasure.
00:19:28.638 - 00:19:58.780, Speaker A: And it's not the latest James Bond movie. It's an operation launched by the RS to make sure you pay tax on your crypto. They are training the agents to detect tax fraud with crypto. So Carolyn Schenck, which is national fraud council in the RS office, said these transactions are not anonymous. We see you. Wow, these guys are serious. So if you're american, make sure you understand the reporting requirements if you deal with.
00:19:58.780 - 00:20:46.170, Speaker A: Right. Next, binance is being investigated by the CFTC, which is a regulator in the US to protect american consumers. It's being investigated because of concern that it could have allowed American on the platform. So we all have in memory the unfortunate story of BitMex and its CEO who is being sued by the american government for allowing us citizen on its platform. So Binance want to avoid to suffer the same fate, of course. Okay, guys, so I am going to give you my crazy conspiracy theory. So a couple of weeks ago I watched this documentary of this ex executive of Alstom, which is a big french company.
00:20:46.170 - 00:21:48.394, Speaker A: So this guy explained how he was arrested in the US for bogus charges in order to force Alstom, his company, to sell to part of his activity to General Motors. And this happened a couple of years ago. And so this ex executive, he accuses the US of conducting an economic warfare against other countries, including its ally, where they find some bullish reason to sue some executive or CEO of foreign company when they want to force them to sell their company to american companies. And so Coinbase is going to ipo very soon. So they're going to have a lot of money. And so with the IPO money, could it be that Coinbase would want to buy Binance? Because Binance is really the biggest competitor of Coinbase. So I know it's a bit out there, it's really a crazy conspiracy theory, but I find that the timing for this investigation on binance is really weird.
00:21:48.394 - 00:22:07.590, Speaker A: And I know that Binance refuses american customer. For example, my roommate, who is american, he tried to create an account on Binance and was refused because he's american. So, yeah, I really think they enforced this rule of not allowing Americans. So, yeah, I don't understand why there is this investigation on Binance. Just. Right. Very, very strange.
00:22:07.590 - 00:22:47.998, Speaker A: Okay, so next we're going to talk of some news for developers. So open Zeppelin just released a new protocol, Sentinel. So this is a tool to do some smart contract monitoring. This can alert you when it detects some anomal activity or some hack. And it's part of a product that is called defender. So openzepling, they are really a big name for blockchain developers. They are the creator of the open Zeppelin framework, which is a solidity library, which is very used to create all the ES 20 token.
00:22:47.998 - 00:23:30.480, Speaker A: And a lot of developers don't know this, but actually open Zeplink is also very famous in the security space because they've done a lot of smart contract audits. So, yeah, I like to check out their product. All right, so now we're going to move on to Q A, and if you haven't registered for my free training, how to get started in Defi, do it now. I will explain you how you can get your first defi job. And what's the best way to learn DeFi development? Defi is moving super fast and it can be super, super confusing. So I'm going to make it simple for you. Let me put the link in the.
00:23:30.480 - 00:23:54.082, Speaker A: Yeah, so let me know if you cannot see the link, because sometimes YouTube, for some weird reason, sends all my own hack. Super weird. All right, so I'm going to scroll up in the chat and see the question. So, yeah, Abracadabra. Did you check the butterfly protocol? I saw your comments, but I saw it too late. Maybe another time. FD.
00:23:54.082 - 00:24:08.746, Speaker A: Hello from us Frank Bruno Simcoe nor streeting. Hey Broski, ghetto finance. Hi jen O'Bladen. Hello, Alton Joseph. Hello, good evening, Abrahcadabra. What are your thought about the. Okay, same question.
00:24:08.746 - 00:24:22.522, Speaker A: Sorry, man, I didn't have enough time for this one. Maybe in next live stream Iodg. Hello, Iodg. Please talk about it. Minor champion, EIP 3368. Okay, maybe another time. I never heard of that one.
00:24:22.522 - 00:24:41.286, Speaker A: Jeremy Hauser, reef finance. Looking great. What is that? Sounds like it just got wrecked. No. Is it why you're laughing? Abracadabra. OJ clips ramen for biggest yield farm. I want to hire Eido blocks for project contact myself.
00:24:41.286 - 00:25:00.986, Speaker A: I'm too busy. But if you want, I can put you in touch with all the blockchain dev. You'll find the link to my email in the description of the video. Abracadabra. Question for julian. Do you think the 51% attack is a real threat? No. Like I said, I think this is just a chicken game.
00:25:00.986 - 00:25:40.134, Speaker A: I think the miners don't really have the mean to enforce their threat, because if they decide to fork off the network of Ethereum, their version of Ethereum will be Ethereum cash, like bitcoin cash. It will have no value. So of course, they don't want to spend real money to mine, like a coin that nobody wants. And in any case, I think we might switch to proof of stake very fast because of this. So, yes, somehow I do think that their reaction could be a good thing for their Ethereum community. Let me see. I don't know how to pronounce this.
00:25:40.134 - 00:25:49.786, Speaker A: S key rtvred. Oh, my God. So hard to say. Whoa. The butterfly protocol is insane. I'm reading about that now. Shame on me, I missed that.
00:25:49.786 - 00:25:58.778, Speaker A: But the price is super slow. I'm buying. Okay, well, got to check this. Butterfly protocol. I like the name Osawin. Thank you. From Thailand.
00:25:58.778 - 00:26:21.926, Speaker A: Hey, Batman. What's up, everyone? Hope everyone is doing well. Yes. No one is also on Minnet. Not sure. What is it about abracadabra? Gun fact about butterfly protocol. You can buy web domain forever with NFT crypto, and you can sell the domain with full access.
00:26:21.926 - 00:26:41.342, Speaker A: Wait a second, wait a second. You make me dap now. I think I did an interview on Butterfly protocol. Yeah, you guys, like, check my channel? I'm pretty sure I did an interview on them. Yeah. Then Arakadabra pancake swap was hacked recently. Really? Oh my God.
00:26:41.342 - 00:27:22.490, Speaker A: Did it just happen? How could I miss this news? Man this is really big news. Okay well that really suck. I know at least ten crypto tube that are from the US and they trade live on binance for example. Crypto zombie. Really? I guess there are ways you can circumvent the system if you use a VPN, if you make a false declaration. But I don't think we can blame binance for being fooled by some people. We could only accuse them if really there is a large history of them allying american people without doing any check.
00:27:22.490 - 00:27:47.794, Speaker A: But it feels like they're actually doing checks. Kay Foushman do you think that pet network hack was from the team? I have no idea how to say. Anupam subscribe yes, one more sub. Yeah. Kay Foushman sorry if you talk about it either I missed the middle of the show. Yeah, you can go back after you can move the playhead. Abracadaba said PEd was inside job.
00:27:47.794 - 00:28:27.470, Speaker A: Yes maybe. Harper rodes question what would be a current problem in the blockchain space that a new developer could look to contribute towards solving right now? One of the big thing is try to do cross chain defi protocol. So defi protocol that integrates between different blockchains. So yeah, if you could build a tool that helped to do this, that'd be interesting. Of course you get the scaling problem. So on ethereum you could work either on ethereum 2.0 or on a L2 scaling solution.
00:28:27.470 - 00:29:03.050, Speaker A: That's pretty hardcore. Yeah. So scaling is a very big problem, but also very hardcore. It's not for beginners. Flavio Chichio hey kay foushman also, I have another question. I saw a transaction on Ethereum coming from a miner with zero fees. You mean a miner that paid? I mean miner can do whatever they want so they can include their own transaction with zero fee.
00:29:03.050 - 00:29:55.446, Speaker A: If this transaction just make them money, they don't care about paying fee to themselves. Anupam Kuma should I learn rust for Solana? Is there any market for that? Or learning three DT and east is enough for future? All right, so if you're a beginner, don't look at other blockchain. Focus on Ethereum because this is basically the standard in the blockchain space. You have Ethereum, the blockchain, the network, but you also have many other copycat like binance smart chain that uses Ethereum as well. So you start with this, you stay focused on this for at least six months and then once you start with feel comfortable, then maybe you can start to look at other blockchain. But start with Ethereum, Tukana, esporao. Question, uni token market cap way higher than its total value lock.
00:29:55.446 - 00:30:31.240, Speaker A: Seems like with so much competition in Dexes, it's overvalued. Does that make sense? I check out the market cap recently, and no, I do think that Uniswap is really one of the precursors. They basically invented the model of the liquidity pool with the automated market maker. And I do think it's going to be one of the biggest decentralized exchange in the future. So for me, I still think that uni is very undervalued. I think it's going to continue to blow up. So, no, I'm super bullish on uni.
00:30:31.240 - 00:31:07.842, Speaker A: Dimitri Fortesco just had a couple of interviews. Solidity interview for mid engineer would be great to have upcodes programming problem, like rolling payout, et cetera. I'm going to release a course on advanced solidity. Should be in the next few months. But if you want, on my channel, I have a video for solidity for blockchain interview. So you can search this Flavio Cisco, you did have an interview with the chief architect of Butterfly protocol. Yeah, I don't know.
00:31:07.842 - 00:31:55.634, Speaker A: I'm losing my mind. Of course, I think this is a great problem. They are super focused on what they're doing, basically buying a domain name in a decentralized way. And I think with what they're doing is super important because in the coming era of big tech censorship, the next step of censorship is censorship at the DNS level, where if you're not approved by the system, quote unquote, they're going to deny you your DNS at some point. So we do need, I think, a decentralized DNS system. Yes. Dimitri Fortesco, love your d five mastering course so far.
00:31:55.634 - 00:32:23.866, Speaker A: Yes, thank you for the feedback. Blzn 57 minor cream finance and pancake swap. Both DNS hijack. Okay, I guess that just happened because I just did my research for blockchain news today. I didn't see this. Okay, that's terrible. Yeah, that's one of the worst kind of hack because this is basically a hack from the front end.
00:32:23.866 - 00:33:10.454, Speaker A: So the smart contract itself, there are no bugs, but people, they use this fake front end that sends a fake transaction. It doesn't actually send a transaction to the real smart contract of pancake swap or cream finance. It just does something totally different. And because on our wallets, oftentimes we use a hardware wallet or even with software wallet, you can't really understand a lot of time what the transaction is doing. If this is a simple ether transfer or token transfer, the wallet is capable of telling you. Okay, are you sure you want to confirm to send this many token to this address? So this is easy. But as soon as this is doing something more complex where you call a function with some argument, then you just see some gibberish, some hexadecimal, and so users aren't able to confirm.
00:33:10.454 - 00:33:52.918, Speaker A: So I think next super important is to improve the user experience on wallet, where users can see exactly the name of the function they are calling. And very important also that you have a way to check the address of the smart contract to make sure this is the correct smart contract. Yes. Abracadabra. If pancakeswap use butterfly protocol, wouldn't be DNS hacked. If this is controlled with a private key, it'll be super almost impossible to do it. Frank Bruno, link, please.
00:33:52.918 - 00:34:06.582, Speaker A: Binance machine to East Bridge. You can check it. I think it's the video just before that one on my channel. Abrahadabra. Thanks for your work, Julian. Love this channel. Shingling you everywhere.
00:34:06.582 - 00:34:19.600, Speaker A: Oh, thanks, man. Really appreciate. I know you're here pretty much every time. I love it. And I mean, I know there are many of you who come here every time. I love it. It's what gives me some motivation to continue.
00:34:19.600 - 00:34:39.106, Speaker A: All right, guys, well, I think we reached the end of the question for today, so we're going to wrap it up here. So, yeah, one last time, for those who haven't subscribed to my free training, how to get started in Defi, this is the link, and I'll see you guys for another video on my channel. Have a great week. Bye.
