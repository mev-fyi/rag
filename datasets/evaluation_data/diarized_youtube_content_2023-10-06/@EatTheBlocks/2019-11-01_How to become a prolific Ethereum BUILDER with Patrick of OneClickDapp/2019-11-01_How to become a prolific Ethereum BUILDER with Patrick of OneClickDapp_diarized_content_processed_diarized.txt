00:00:00.250 - 00:00:08.190, Speaker A: Hi guys, and welcome for this podcast interview of Patrick of one click dap. So welcome, Patrick.
00:00:09.090 - 00:00:15.774, Speaker B: Hey, thanks. Pleasure to be here. I hope I can provide some good advice. And thanks for having me on.
00:00:15.892 - 00:00:40.330, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I'm really glad to have you here. So I first met Patrick this summer at Trufflecon. And at first I didn't know who he was, but after I realized, oh no, it's not just a patrick, but it's the Patrick of one click dap. So can you introduce yourself and talk of how you got into blockchain and after talk a bit about a one click dap?
00:00:41.070 - 00:01:22.850, Speaker B: Sure. So one click dap was a project I created. I started teaching sort of smart contracts to my friends and then I started teaching them in meetups and there was a big problem, which was people would write a contract and then they didn't have a website to share with people and they didn't have interface quickly to test. And so I was like, all right, well, I got to create a tool to solve this problem. And that's what one click dap was designed for. And so about my background, I didn't study software engineering in school. I did traditional engineering and I was working not in software.
00:01:22.850 - 00:01:30.106, Speaker B: And I kind of about two years ago, jumped into it feet first. And here we are today.
00:01:30.288 - 00:02:12.694, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think it's pretty amazing because in just two short years, you were able to learn fast enough so that you can really produce a tool that is widely used by the Ethereum community. So that really show that for people who want to become blockchain developer, they don't need to have started development like ten years ago. It can happen pretty fast. And I think the success of one click dap is that you really identify a specific problem and you gave a specific solution. I think that was really the key to success of one click dap. And actually I just checked it before this interview and I see that now.
00:02:12.694 - 00:02:16.040, Speaker A: You also added a paid service.
00:02:19.770 - 00:03:03.142, Speaker B: That was launched a long time ago. The paid service was always in mind, but I only did like one or two of the paid versions, so that's not really the focus. But I did recently add plugins for both truffle and for remix. So if you're in your truffle project, you can actually just run like NPMI one click. And then I think you just type one click and then it creates the dapps for whatever you have deployed in your truffle project. So it's kind of like right there in the command line, it's going to give you an interface immediately, and then remix. Also, if you just look in the plugins column and search for one click dap, it's going to be right there.
00:03:03.142 - 00:03:06.502, Speaker B: So you can go directly from remix to having it as well.
00:03:06.636 - 00:03:14.330, Speaker A: Wow, that's pretty cool. So, night seems like you are working on integrating what you've done with all the tools.
00:03:15.070 - 00:03:48.942, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's really nice because it's a very open community. It's like remix has the plugin system. Truffle built the plugin system, and actually now Metamask has a plugin system as well. And they just announced that at Devcon, and it's called metamask snaps. And if you're interested, there's a telegram group where we're trying to get ideas together for what snaps to build. And the channel is mm, snaps. That's the name of mean.
00:03:48.942 - 00:04:33.202, Speaker B: The first kind of example of a snap would be when a user goes to hit a transaction or process transaction. It's going to kind of check if an address is a real address or not. So if it's like a bad account, it's on a blacklist somewhere, it might give a little warning to you, say, hey, watch out for this contract. And then eventually they're going to add a UI component so you can kind of represent your own stuff within metamask, which is like, I think this is a huge game changer, which is why I'm so excited. I created the channel about mean, the Ethereum community in general. All these plugins are happening, and I'm super excited about it. I can't wait to build something for Metamask now, too.
00:04:33.336 - 00:04:41.190, Speaker A: So this metamask snap thing, is it like a sort of chrome extension inside the chrome extension?
00:04:42.650 - 00:05:29.160, Speaker B: Yeah, it's essentially a plugin, but I think that for the purposes of the Google Chrome store and maybe potentially the App Stores later on with Apple and stuff, the idea of having third party software within third party software is, know it's kind of a security thing, and they're trying to rebrand it as a snap instead of a plugin. But essentially, yeah, it's going to be an open thing where anybody can create a snap, and when somebody lands on your Dap, they actually get prompted to install your snap. And so then once it's installed, it kind of lives in their metamask, and then wherever they are, they can view that.
00:05:29.690 - 00:05:50.620, Speaker A: So one problem I see with this is there would be a lot of security consequences. So probably they need to have at least one person who review all the plugins, right? Yeah, but, yeah, the possibilities of this are really endless. Well, that's really cool.
00:05:50.990 - 00:06:07.286, Speaker B: Yeah, that's one of the first snapshot things that should be built is kind of like a checker that kind of checks the other snaps that you have installed. It's like, here's the good ones, here's the bad ones. You're absolutely right there about the security concern.
00:06:07.418 - 00:06:13.380, Speaker A: Cool. So you're working on that. And I think you're also working on some Dex project.
00:06:14.630 - 00:06:57.810, Speaker B: Yeah. So also around Devcon Aave, I think it's pronounced Ave. Formerly the ETH lend group, they announced a flash loan system, which is essentially within one block. You can borrow pretty much as much as you want. I don't know what the limits really are, but you can borrow a lot of money in a single block, so long as you return it in the same block plus a small fee. And you can do all of this without providing any collateral. So you can just have enough gas to process a transaction, but you can have access to a million dollars of capital.
00:06:57.810 - 00:07:49.070, Speaker B: And so this is really exciting for a couple of reasons. For instance, for closing out cdps that are under collateralized that can be done within a single block, and you can kind of reap the benefits of doing that. And you can also do arbitrage between the Dex exchanges. You wouldn't really be able to decentralized exchanges, but it's kind of like this really interesting idea of just like having a lot of money available to you, but you don't have any real responsibility because if the money doesn't get returned within the same block, the transaction will revert. So nobody's really on the hook. It's almost like the code is the collateral instead of you providing Ethereum as collateral.
00:07:49.230 - 00:08:38.100, Speaker A: Wow, that's pretty crazy. Yeah. So far on my channel, I was focused in general in blockchain and Ethereum. But I really think from now on I will switch the focus to DeFi because for a long time, I think on Ethereum, we were really searching what was the general focus of dapps. But I think now it's pretty clear, like Ethereum is for DeFi and other blockchain, like Tron or Eos, that are more like, for like, things are way more clear. And I really wonder, how do you get all these ideas and how do you always know what are the cool stuff that are being built? Maybe you follow some people, you go to some secret website. I don't know.
00:08:41.590 - 00:09:05.834, Speaker B: I think you just got to show up and go to these events, like wherever you are, there's some meetup nearby. If there's an ETh Global hackathon. You got to go to them. I mean, they're free anyways. How can you say no to that? Right? It's on a weekend. Try to get as much money together, buy a plane ticket or drive and meet people, and the ideas are going to come out.
00:09:05.952 - 00:09:15.440, Speaker A: Okay. So this leads me to my next question. So can you describe your experience going to hackathons? Because I think you've attended many.
00:09:16.850 - 00:09:43.158, Speaker B: Yeah, hackathons are a total blast. You should not, first rule, don't go in with the intention of winning money. That's not the point of hackathons. The point is to grow and develop and to meet people and come up with these crazy ideas. Right. So you should go in. Maybe you can have a couple of ideas ahead of time and think about the things that you might want to build.
00:09:43.158 - 00:10:08.334, Speaker B: But when you get there, find people that you don't know. Find people with different backgrounds as you, and you're going to sit down, you're going to come up with an idea that's probably nothing like what you thought you were going to build. And so that's kind of my first tip is go in with an open mind. Don't try to win, be open to new ideas and that sort of thing. And I guarantee you're going to have a fun time.
00:10:08.452 - 00:10:16.500, Speaker A: Do you need any sort of planning? Like do you need to know people before you go? You can just show up and try to go in the team.
00:10:17.190 - 00:10:45.980, Speaker B: Yeah. So there are team forming at the East Global hackathons and many others. They always do team forming. And if you don't know what East Global is, it's like if you see east and then like Boston or ETH New York or that those are all under the. So, yeah, if you're going to. There's, I guess there's other blockchain hackathons, too. It's the most common, of course.
00:10:45.980 - 00:10:49.100, Speaker B: But yeah, you can meet people there. Absolutely.
00:10:49.550 - 00:11:07.060, Speaker A: Wow. That's pretty cool. Actually. Recently I asked on Reddit, is there a website that lists all the hackathons but just for blockchain? And someone created this website. It's called just blockchain. Hackathons are really simple. Yeah.
00:11:07.430 - 00:11:08.130, Speaker B: That's awesome.
00:11:08.200 - 00:11:51.066, Speaker A: Yeah. I'll put the link in the description. Yeah. So for all the aspiring blockchain developer, if you're really committed, going to hackathon can really give you a head start compared to all the others that are not doing anything special. Yeah. Because you're going to meet people, you're going to build things and it's going to be fantastic for your personal growth, for your portfolio. Also, I feel like if you want to create your own project, so you don't want to be an employee, but you want to have your own thing with maybe employees and stuff, going to Hackathon might be a great way to start something because you don't even need to win a prize.
00:11:51.066 - 00:12:38.400, Speaker A: But if you do something interesting, you'll get a lot of positive attention and maybe at some point you can even get some investors. So just before I was reading about the story of instadap. So this is like a defi dap that allow to manage different defi service. Like I think you can access a uniswap on it, a maker Dao, the CDP saver and a couple of other things. And originally it started at a hackathon in 2018 and six months later they launched on main net. And after I think recently they got some investment. But I'm pretty sure they got this because of the exposure at the.
00:12:39.410 - 00:13:24.302, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And that's actually how we got started on a recent project of mine called Tribute. I basically put some questions up on Twitter about this new thing called RDAi, which is essentially when you earn interest from compound using CDI, right? So it's a borrowing and lending platform and if you hold the tokens, you can earn interest. Right. For yourself. And then RDAI came out which is like, okay, instead of earning interest for my account, I'm actually going to redirect that interest to somebody else. So now I can specify, say I have 1000 die and I have 7% interest I'm earning on that per year.
00:13:24.302 - 00:14:01.722, Speaker B: I can redirect that flow of money to somebody else and I keep my principal, I keep, keep my balance. I posted some questions on Twitter and I got a little bit of traction and we actually formed a group based on those tweets ahead of time to hack on it at East Boston and we created what is now. Yeah, going to hackathons and meeting new people. Those are the best opportunities to find a good idea and also to find the right people that you enjoy working with.
00:14:01.856 - 00:14:30.340, Speaker A: Wow, that's pretty good advice here everybody. Make sure to check out hackathon. If you go there, you're going to really stand out because compared to in the mass of developer, actually relatively few developers go to hackathon. So yeah, it's really a great idea. I think also you had a sort of like small warning for newcomer to the blockchain industry, right?
00:14:31.270 - 00:15:22.690, Speaker B: Yeah. So I mean, I would say if you're new to blockchain development. If you're thinking about getting in, you need to be a little bit mindful that it's a very new space and the ground rules are not there. There are no guides available that are very thorough or to help you understand what a career path might look like. And so because of this, you might get the sense that everyone's very welcoming and excited to have you and is willing to talk to you and encourage you as much as you need it, but that the biggest kind of voices right now in the space are not necessarily the right voices. And this is kind of true with anything new. But you need to be mindful that the people that are here that are going to be successful are doing it for the right reasons.
00:15:22.690 - 00:15:47.722, Speaker B: So if you have the right reason for doing it, then you'll be okay. But you just need to be careful about where you get your information from and how you go about it. So do your research, have a deep understanding of what you're getting yourself into before you kind of just jump in like I did, feet first. It was a little rough there for a while. Yeah.
00:15:47.776 - 00:16:11.394, Speaker A: Very wise word here. Yeah. So I think it's very useful for the newcomer. And I will add to this also not to be too obsessed with the price of crypto. I've noticed on my channel and also on my course for DAP developer that when the price of ether goes up, then I have more students. When the price of ether goes down, I have less. But I don't think it's the way you should think about it.
00:16:11.394 - 00:16:43.280, Speaker A: You should make a long term investment, really, if you get into it, you go for two, three, five years, even more. And really at the end, it's going to pay off. Even I can see it for me now, I have much more people who start to come to me, like companies who want to hire me or people who want me to get into their project, but because I've stayed inside for a couple of years already. But if I was obsessed with the price, then I would have quit already.
00:16:44.610 - 00:17:30.890, Speaker B: Yeah. You have to be here for the right reasons, and you have to be motivated. You have to take initiative. And one of the right reasons that I think is very important is you have to kind of be here for the movement. And I know that's a very open ended thing, but if you're here to make the world a better place, to spread the values of decentralization, and you have all of those kind of in the back of your head driving the rest of your decisions, then I think you'll be okay. But if you're here and you're looking at the price, like you're saying, and you're saying, oh, this is a fad, like, I want to get in, and it's cool and hip. Those are probably not as good reasons as being here for the movement.
00:17:30.890 - 00:17:38.414, Speaker B: Right? This is kind of like a movement. We're trying to create a new Internet. Right? Web three. That's what this is about.
00:17:38.612 - 00:17:55.960, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed, Patrick. Yeah. Very, very wise word here. So I think we're going to wrap it up. So if people want to check out your project, Patrick, so they can reach out to you on.
00:18:01.450 - 00:18:43.090, Speaker B: Want to. I want to emphasize the tribute thing that we're working. So, like I said, we started it at East Boston, and it's kind of like grown into this open source idea of how do we take the directed interest payments, right? Like, instead of me receiving interest, I'm going to send it to somebody else. How do we kind of turn that into a product that doesn't require a lot of education? Because it's a weird concept. This is kind of like a totally new idea. Nobody has a bank account where they earn interest, and then they can actually use that to pay for something, right? Like, no, you earn it and then you withdraw it and then you pay for something. There's a lot more steps there.
00:18:43.090 - 00:19:38.238, Speaker B: The flow doesn't exist currently. So what we're trying to do is simplify that into a couple of use cases for now. And I guess we're kind of following the Insta dat model, right? Try to make it really easy, try to make it simple, specific use cases, and then launch individual ideas around that. So, for instance, one of them is like an escrow contract, where instead of the money just sitting there and not doing anything, it can actually be earning interest. And so the idea is like, okay, if I have my RDI token sitting in the escrow contract, I can actually point the interest back to myself. Because when you put money in escrow, you don't have control of it. That's the whole point, is that someone else has control and they're managing it for you or it's managed by the contract.
00:19:38.238 - 00:20:23.842, Speaker B: So if we can point the interest back to ourselves, that'd be pretty cool, because then I'm not losing out on all the potential. Like, defi is amazing, right? Let's not miss out on it. That's an idea. And then another idea is giving to open source projects in the space. So how do we kind of split up that interest into multiple different paths and go a little bit goes to the burner wallet collective, a little bit goes to metacartel, a little bit goes to one click dap, say. And the idea of splitting up interest is very like, it takes a lot of cognitive effort. So that's what we're trying to do, is really simplify it down.
00:20:23.842 - 00:20:56.478, Speaker B: How do we represent interest in whole dollar amounts, for instance, like whole integer numbers? That's more easier to grasp, because if I tell you, all right, Julian, you have 1000 die and you earn 7% on that, it'd be hard to come up with a way to say, how do you want to divide that up? Do I want to say 4% goes here and 5% goes here, et cetera? Okay, that's helpful, but that doesn't demonstrate how much actual value is being sent. Right?
00:20:56.644 - 00:21:36.730, Speaker A: So I think for this, maybe you can use an id that is used in decentralized exchanges. I mean, in exchanges in general, it's the tick. Tick, have you heard of that? So tick means a sort of minimum amount that you can trade. So this exists in any market in general, you cannot trade like a very small amount, but there is a minimum size, so you can sort of enforce this. And in the interface of the user, instead of saying, of specifying some percentage, then everything can be in this unit.
00:21:39.310 - 00:22:21.450, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the next one. That's kind of similar. One way we decided was represent it per amount over time. So say, based on your amount of RDI that you own, or the amount of die that you own, you have the ability to send $10 a year, say, or $100 a year or $5 a month. And so it takes a little bit of computation to get those numbers, but when you show it on the front end, it's much more easier to understand. Somebody can go, okay, I understand, I'm giving one dollars a month to burner wallet collective. So that's kind of the goal is simplifying UI and making it easier to understand.
00:22:21.600 - 00:23:16.122, Speaker A: Yeah. Not only make it more simple for the UI, but also on the smart contract side, because as you know, on smart contract, we have problem with floating point numbers. You have to decide on some rules so that you never have to deal with a fraction. And recently in the project I'm currently working for, it is some deFi project, and it took me a lot of time to come up with rules so that we never have this issue in a decentralized exchange. We are, well, I mean, I think we talk of everything. Do you still see? Yeah. Guys, make sure to check out the two project of Patrick now.
00:23:16.122 - 00:23:33.920, Speaker A: So one click dap and tribute. I'll put the link in the description. And if you want to reach out to Patrick, I also put his twitter and yeah, thanks, Patrick, for coming here and we wish you good luck for all your project.
00:23:34.770 - 00:23:46.262, Speaker B: Thanks for having me on and I open any comments from anybody. If anybody needs help on something or wants to ask about how I got started, happy to share.
00:23:46.396 - 00:23:49.506, Speaker A: Cool. Thanks, Patrick. Bye.
00:23:49.698 - 00:23:50.610, Speaker B: All right, thanks, Julian.
