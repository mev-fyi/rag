00:00:00.890 - 00:00:39.706, Speaker A: Hi, this is Julian from it the blocks, and this is a new episode of my weekly newsletter about news and tutorial for Ethereum developers. If you want to see more videos like this, make sure to subscribe to this channel. Okay, let's get started. So this week our first link is about gas optimization tips. So it gas optimization tips basically will allow you to consume less gas in your smart contract. And that's very important because if your transaction costs too much money, then your DaP will not have any user. So check it out.
00:00:39.706 - 00:01:19.794, Speaker A: It's a cool little post. Next one, we have a link about common attack in solidity. So it's basically about how you can make your smart contract safer. So security is a really big deal when you program a smart contract. So for example, it talks about race condition in reentrancy, which is one of the most famous security vulnerability of smart contracts. So check out this article, it's pretty cool. And next we have a new standard, ERc nine nine eight, which is about gaming on Ethereum.
00:01:19.794 - 00:02:14.690, Speaker A: So this is related to ERC 721. So those non fungible tokens that are used among other things in cryptokitties and this cannot basically allow to have composable tokens where one address can own several seven to one token at the same time. And so it's easier to trade like different attributes of the same character. For example, next we have a tutorial for using Webstery Swift. So if you want to build a Dap on iOS, you can check out this tutorial. Next, this is a really good article on using DAP. So it's basically a vc.
00:02:14.690 - 00:02:54.106, Speaker A: So an investor that is really into Dapps and it talks about using Dapps and basically urge developer and people interested to not just study the code but actually also. So I used up and he talk about it and yeah, it's quite interesting. Next we have a free ethereum course. So that's a guy on Reddit last week. He basically said that he was preparing to release a pet course, but for some reason decided to make it free. So I check it out quickly. It's mainly about ICO and ERC 20 tokens.
00:02:54.106 - 00:03:37.878, Speaker A: So it's quite, quite a standout in terms of content, but it seems quite serious and complete. So check it out. And next we have an article about an analysis of Chainlink. So if you have never heard of channeling before, it's basically a decentralized oracle network. So it allow you to have your smart contract interact with the outside world. And it's one of the very important piece of infrastructure that we still miss to have fully functional DAP today on Ethereum. And lastly, we have a link about Spankchan, so I will not detail what is spankchain.
00:03:37.878 - 00:04:00.934, Speaker A: You can check it out yourself. Just make sure that you are in an incognito session and there is nobody behind you checking out what is on your screen because otherwise it's going to be funny. I don't say anymore. You'll find out yourself. That's it for today guys. I hope it was interesting for you. It was interesting for me.
00:04:00.934 - 00:04:13.706, Speaker A: If you like this video, you can give me a like and make sure to subscribe to this channel to see more videos like this. And I will see you very soon for another video about Ethereum development. Bye.
