00:00:00.330 - 00:00:21.930, Speaker A: Welcome for this weekly video on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and defy. I do this every Monday at 11:00 a.m. East coast time. So today is a little bit special. There was a problem in the initial live stream, so I had to rerecord the video. So what you see here is a prerecorded video. So today there won't be any q and a, unfortunately.
00:00:21.930 - 00:00:53.834, Speaker A: But, but we're gonna talk of super important stuff. So in this video, I'm going to be talking of East 2.0. Of course, we are only one day away from the deadline for the deposit contract. So east two, phase zero is a major milestone for Ethereum. So depending on whether we will reach this milestone or not, the price of ether could go to the moon, or on the contrary, it could crash to the ground if it fails. So it's super, super important. We also have massive gains in Defi tokens, even more crazy than last week.
00:00:53.834 - 00:01:18.914, Speaker A: So I'm going to show you which project exactly went up and we're going to zoom in on the top earner for the week. This week we're also going to have a ton of flash loan attacks in Defi protocol. I will explain what happened exactly and how much was stolen. So if you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host. And on my channel it's the blocks. I teach blockchain development. So on November 27, so it's this Friday at 11:00 a.m.
00:01:18.914 - 00:01:50.894, Speaker A: East time, I will do a live training on how to get started in blockchain. So if you are a newbie and you want to get started in the blockchain industry, but you are a bit lost, you don't know where to start. This training is for you. So I will cover how to get your first blockchain job and make $100,000 a year, how to build your own blockchain project, how to make money programmatically in D five. So if you want to participate to this training, you need to register to receive the link. This is completely free and this will make you save a lot of time. Also, you don't need to be a technical person to understand.
00:01:50.894 - 00:02:14.118, Speaker A: I've designed this training so that everybody can understand, especially beginners. So register now. You'll find the link in the description just below. So we'll start by talking of the price of ether. So ether is pumping like crazy this week plus 30% as we are approaching the launch of Ethereum 2.0. Phase zero. December 1.
00:02:14.118 - 00:02:49.474, Speaker A: Everybody's getting super excited. So there will probably be a huge price movement on November 24 at 12:00 p.m.. UTC, and I will explain why after. And I will explain the situation on the deposit contract when it comes to the gas price of Ethereum. So for the first time since a long time, gas price is going back up a bit. On the one hand, it's good that we have low gas price because we can use Ethereum without paying used transaction fees. But on the other end it also means that the network is less used, which is not good.
00:02:49.474 - 00:03:19.366, Speaker A: So it's probably better than gas fee. Don't go down too much before we get a scaling solution. Okay, so let's talk Ethereum 2.0. So Ethereum 20 is the next version of Ethereum, way more scalable, which could reach up to 100,000 transactions per second to be compared with 15 transactions per second currently. So the first phase of Ethereum 2.0, phase zero, is supposed to start next month. But for that to happen, we need to lock a certain number of ether to secure the network.
00:03:19.366 - 00:03:50.534, Speaker A: 524,288 ether to be precise. And at current prices, that's a bit more than 300 million of dollars worth of ether. So people who lock their ether will be able to earn a return of between five to 20%, depending on the numbers of avalidator. But they need to accept to lock the ether for several years. So that's the catch. The deadline to reach this number, 500,000 something. The deadline is tomorrow, November 24, at 12:00 p.m..
00:03:50.534 - 00:04:17.422, Speaker A: UTC. And currently we are at about 60% of the amount required. I think actually now since I last checked it actually went up, so I think we're even higher now. So we still need some ether, but we're getting closer. So tomorrow at 12:00 p.m., UTC, there are two options. Option one, we have enough ether locked, and phase zero of ether 2.0
00:04:17.422 - 00:04:42.610, Speaker A: will start on December 1 as initially planned. So that's a huge vote of confidence for Ethereum. The price will go up even more, and by the end of the year it will probably reach 1000 ether. Option two, we don't have enough ether locked. Tomorrow, phase zero of Ethereum 2.0 will be delayed. Although it wouldn't be the end of the world, it would for sure spook some investors and the price of ether will have a big correction.
00:04:42.610 - 00:05:36.514, Speaker A: So the big question is, will we reach this Rishall tomorrow? A lot of people assume that the rate of deposit is a little bit too slow, but it's important to know that there are two reasons why people want to delay their deposit. First, people want to keep earning money by using their ETH in defi protocol until the very end. There is no reason to lock your ETH before the deadline, except maybe that the gas fee will increase very close to the deadline. Second, people also want to know roughly how many ether will be locked in a contract when we are close to the deadline. And they need to know this in order to evaluate how much they will earn. So 524,200 288 ether is just a minimum, but we can lock more and probably we will actually lock more. The more ETH is locked, the less the yield which is paid to validators.
00:05:36.514 - 00:06:16.494, Speaker A: So we have two reasons that explain why people we want to wait until the very last moment to stake their ether into ether 2.0. And finally, last thing, if we still don't have enough ether tomorrow, even after everything I explained, I'm pretty sure that the Ethereum foundation has some sort of contingency plans to use its ether stash to contribute to Ether 2.0 if needed. The Ethereum foundation has about 0.6% of the total ETH supply. That's about 678,000 ether. So even by using just a part of their watches, they could complete the missing chunk of ether in the deposit contract.
00:06:16.494 - 00:06:54.638, Speaker A: So if you're interested in staking yourself, check out my last two videos where I explain how to run a validator and how to build your own staking pool which allow you to stake less than 32 ether. Next we're going to talk of the DFI market caps. So this week we are at 14 billion, that's 400 million more than last week. So it's going up. However, when you have a look at the chart in terms of ether, then the picture is not so rosy. Actually, you see a sharp decrease in the number of ETH which is locked in DFI. And so we can explain part of this with Ethereum 2.0.
00:06:54.638 - 00:07:53.086, Speaker A: Part of this ether is locked into Ethereum 2.0, but that only explain a small fraction of this, because for Ethereum 2.0 we only need 500 number of ether that is locked in Defi. So ether is going up and Defi yields are also good. So why people are withdrawing their ether from Defi? Well, recently there were a lot of hacks, so maybe that it spooked some investors. So I think that's really the main explanation. And also another thing to note is that in terms of market cap for a few DeFi protocol, so Uniswap went down a lot because the liquidity mining program ended and a lot of this liquidity actually went to sushiswap.
00:07:53.086 - 00:08:30.218, Speaker A: But I think that after some time it will return to Uniswap. Actually, the community of Uniswap is discussing to re implement to restart the liquidity mining incentive with maybe a lower reward for liquidity provider. Okay, so next we're going to see what happened to Defi token this week. So this week is even more crazy than last week. So we have something like 80% of the top hundred Defi token going up. So it's really beautiful. We get a massive 600% for SFI token.
00:08:30.218 - 00:08:54.514, Speaker A: So this is the token of saffron finance. And the funny story, actually, I got contacted to work for them and I said no. Stupid me. I'm sure I would have received some SFI coins in a package. Stupid me, I'll be a millionaire by now. Okay, so what is this saffron finance project and why the token is going up? I will discuss this just after. We also got a huge increase for ieath.
00:08:54.514 - 00:09:13.554, Speaker A: So this is a token traded on the synthetics protocol. This is supposed to be the country of ETH. When ETH goes up, it is supposed to go down. And conversely. So I really, really do understand why it went up, because ETH went up a lot. So I ETH should be done by now. Then we also have the syn token.
00:09:13.554 - 00:09:39.426, Speaker A: So that's the token of a new protocol called Sinlev. So this is a protocol to do some margin trading. For example, you can get a three time exposure to ether. And a couple of days ago they announced their integration with the oracle of chainlink. Also we have hedgeget. So this is a protocol for hedging your crypto positions with option. Recently we actually saw a lot of options protocol in DeFi.
00:09:39.426 - 00:10:21.330, Speaker A: This is getting really popular. And also we got a nice progression for frontier. So that's a protocol to manage your defi across blockchain. So it's a bit like instadap, but cross chain, and also a nice progression for easy Phi. So that's a lending protocol for layer two, which promised to offer a cheaper way to borrow and lend tokens. And for the losers, we don't have many of them, but one of the main one is pickle, which was hacked, but in general very few tokens in the red. So I will explain exactly what happened to pickle after.
00:10:21.330 - 00:11:02.430, Speaker A: So on the red side this week. So it's slightly more exciting than last week. So we have some nice rate here. Die USDC on DyDX, also die USDC and tether on ave 5% almost 6% 7.65. And me, I still have my tether on compound, still sleeping. So the reason why the rates are usually lower on compound is because this is an older protocol that is deemed more secure by investor. There is more trust in compound, so it's no more than investor require higher interest rate for other protocol.
00:11:02.430 - 00:11:44.506, Speaker A: So in DeFi, people tend to neglect the lending protocol because they want some crazy rate like 100% APR. But that's a mistake because you can still have some very nice rate compared to what you get with your bank and at a fraction of the risk compared to the crazy yield farming. So if you have less risk appetite or you just want to pack your coins between two trades, putting your coins in the lending protocol could be interesting. Okay, so now I'm going to talk a little bit more of DFI projects. So first, Saffron finance. So this is the project of the top performer of the top DFI coin. This week, SFI.
00:11:44.506 - 00:12:05.470, Speaker A: So plugs 600%. So I want to explain what is Saffron finance and why its token performs so well. So saffron wants to tokenize liquidity provider token. So this is a complex project. Let me give an example. So let's say you lend some tokens in compound, you get a liquidity provider token. Or we just say LP token.
00:12:05.470 - 00:12:52.482, Speaker A: This represents your claim. In the token you lend, the big risk is called impermanent loss. So basically because of the way this automated market maker work, when you redeem your LP token, it's possible that you actually lose some money compared to if you had just hold on the underlying token. So what if you could reduce the risk of impermanent loss in exchange of a reduced interest rate? Well that's exactly what Saffron finance does. So with Saffron finance, you send your LP token to their pool and you get another LP token. So you can choose, there are two kinds of LP token. One with higher risk and higher interest rate, and another one with less risk, but also less interest rate.
00:12:52.482 - 00:13:28.106, Speaker A: So technically, this is as if your LP token had been turned into a bond with different trenches. So why the token of saffron went up like crazy from November 19? So they are starting their liquidity mining program on December 1. That's one reason. The second reason is on November 18 they were added on coin market cap. So I think that's really what triggered the gold rush for them. And finally, last reason is because of tokenomics. So in their pool you have different trenches, you have the junior trench and the other one, the senior trench.
00:13:28.106 - 00:14:14.110, Speaker A: So the junior trench is the one that gives you the most money, but that is the most risky also. So Saffron finance makes you deposit SFI and Dai token to this pool. And so it helps to back the protocol in case of a hack. So what happened was a positive feedback loop. So the junior trench is attractive due to higher SFI yield. So users buy SFI, the price goes up, but as the price goes up, it also makes the yield of this junior trench go up, which also attract more user. But this user needs to buy some SFI in order to enter the pool, the price goes even further, et cetera, et cetera.
00:14:14.110 - 00:14:44.630, Speaker A: So, before you invest in saffron, be sure to consider this. So, first, this is a very young project. He has an anonymous team. His code is not audited. His code has some very business complex logic, which make it more likely to have more bugs. And finally, the product of saffron finance is very similar to what we call CDO bonds. And these CDO bonds were the main culprit for the financial crisis in 2008.
00:14:44.630 - 00:15:16.462, Speaker A: So in other words, it's an extremely risky project, probably the most risky I've ever seen. So be super careful. Okay, so next we're going to talk of DFI hack. So, this week, actually a lot of hacks. First, Pico was hacked for $20 million on November 21. So first, what's Pico? So, Pico is an onchain asset manager, a little bit like Yan finance. So on Pico, the equivalent of a pool is called a jar.
00:15:16.462 - 00:16:06.046, Speaker A: So you invest tokens in a jar on Pico finance. And Pico finance reinvest these tokens in other DeFi protocol to generate some yield. So recently, the team of Pico deployed a new jar related to Dai. This jar had several flows that were exploited right away by the hacker. The hack itself was pretty complex, but from a high level perspective, the flow was that Pico, like many other DeFi protocol, make itself updatable by having part of its logic swappable. So in the case of Pico, it was possible to add a new jar, which is a new investment strategy, basically. And once this new strategy is deployed, the problem is this kind of new strategy, they may not receive the same amount of testing than with the core contract.
00:16:06.046 - 00:16:43.626, Speaker A: And this can lead to vulnerability. So when you want to make your system more flexible with swappable logic, it can actually make your system more dangerous. Okay, so then, next hack, origin protocol. So origin protocol was hacked for 8 million. So origin protocol is a stable coin, which is backed by other stablecoin, and it has a built in yield farming mechanism. So you just have to hold the stablecoin and it will automatically accrue some interest. And the interest is converted into the stable coin.
00:16:43.626 - 00:17:18.780, Speaker A: So it's super, super convenient. So the hack used a flash loan plus a reentrancy bug. So I'm super surprised that they were exploded for a reentrancy bug because at this point, this is reentrancy bugs are very well known, we know what it is and we know how to avoid them. So, yeah, very surprising. There is a bounty of $1 million for anybody who offer some information about the hacker. And finally, last hack of the week, cheese bank was hacked for 3.3 million.
00:17:18.780 - 00:17:51.886, Speaker A: So Cheesebank is a new lending protocol on steroids. For the first phase, they only have a yield farming feature where basically you buy the governance token, you stake it and you get some reward. So someone used a flash loan to steal $3.3 million. So it's the same technique that was used for other DFI hack with flash loans. So first they borrow money was a flash loans. With this money, they're able to move the price of a token on Uniswap.
00:17:51.886 - 00:18:44.146, Speaker A: So in this case, that was the governance token of the protocol. Then they deposited some money in the pool of Cheesebank, they get some LP token in exchange, then they move the price of the governance token of the project on Uniswap, but in the other direction this time. And finally they redeem the LP token. They get back their initial investment plus some profit, because they manipulated the price of this LP token thanks to the manipulation on Uniswap. So the big, big problem here was that in the smart contract of Cheesebank, they were relying on the on chain oracle of Uniswap. But this is very dangerous and it's not the first time this happens. So I'm a bit surprised that they were hacked for that.
00:18:44.146 - 00:19:19.034, Speaker A: Okay, so next last hack. So Godaddy, which is the biggest hosting company, it's also one of the biggest domain registers. When you buy a domain name, you can use GoDaddy and a couple of crypto services were targeted. So basically what happened is hackers were able to redirect domain name of some crypto project. So this is not DeFi project, but only some centralized project. The hacking method was pretty simple. It's what we call social engineering.
00:19:19.034 - 00:20:16.820, Speaker A: So it's basically a hacker will call employee of GoDaddy and pretend that maybe they are their boss and they are in a meeting and they are in a rush and they need the access to something really quickly and the employees under pressure answer very quickly and, and give the info basically. So basically people were redirected to fake version of all this crypto project, but fortunately there was no password stolen, no money stolen at all. But still, this is quite scary actually, to give a bit of context, there was almost exactly the same kind of hack happening to my crypto wallet. I think it happened a couple of years ago, but in this case, unfortunately people lost millions of dollars. So the lesson is if you are building your own blockchain project, you should never delegate the management of domain name to employee. This is too important. You should manage this yourself.
00:20:16.820 - 00:20:37.046, Speaker A: Okay, so next news. Zapper raised $1.5 million from Coinbase Venture and another investment fund. So Zapper is a dashboard for DFI. So with one interface you can manage all your DFI investment. That's a little bit similar to Instadap or Zerio. So they already raised $1.5
00:20:37.046 - 00:21:03.454, Speaker A: million this summer. That's a really good sign. When you have a blockchain project that repeatedly raise money in a short time, that really means they have a lot of traction. That also means that they are going to hire a lot of people. So if you're a blockchain developer, you're looking for a job. That's a good idea to contact that sort of project just after they raise money. Okay, so now news for developers.
00:21:03.454 - 00:21:34.518, Speaker A: So first there is a new version of solidity. Not much new for developers actually. It's mostly bug fixes and compiler features, but still you have to update your solidity version in your project. Then an update for Webster. J the Java version of Webstery so the main version of Webster is in JavaScript, but you also have some implementation in other languages. If you can. It's better to stay with the JavaScript version because it's the best maintained.
00:21:34.518 - 00:22:05.278, Speaker A: But sometimes you have no choice and you have to use other languages. So for example, if you are doing a native app on Android, you have to use Java. Then an update on Fei. I don't know how we pronounce it. This is the new language for smart contract. It will be the successor of Viper and it will have a very pythonic syntax. So the main language for smart contract will probably remain solidity, but this one might become popular once it's released.
00:22:05.278 - 00:22:38.480, Speaker A: We'll see then. New tool I don't know how to pronounce this ette, so that's a new tool to index the data of Ethereum and expose it with a rest API so it's written in Golang. It uses two databases, Redis and PostgreSql. It's very useful if you want to access historical data of the blockchain in a simple way. So for example, you could build a blockchain explorer like Etherscan with this tool. Sometimes some people ask me if we can do backend blockchain project. Well, this is a very good example of a backend blockchain project.
00:22:38.480 - 00:23:17.798, Speaker A: And then we have Eastflow, which is a visual interface to query the API of Ethereum. So it's built by Quicknode, which is an Ethereum API service similar to Inferra. So Eastflow is a bit similar to Postman, but for blockchain. So you can connect it to different kind of node like ganache. It's very useful if you want to explore the API of Ethereum in an interactive way. Okay, so that's it for the news of this week. So usually when we do a live stream, then this is the time when we do the Q A, but this time because I told you I had this problem with the live stream.
00:23:17.798 - 00:23:46.374, Speaker A: So this is actually pre recorded video. So we cannot do the Q A this week, unfortunately. But be aware that this week is a little bit special. So first of all, I will have my live training this Friday, so make sure to register for it. This is a live training about how to get started in blockchain. You'll find the link in the description. And because this is a special week, I will do a new video every day.
00:23:46.374 - 00:23:56.770, Speaker A: So yeah, more video this week. Okay, guys, that's it for this video on the news of Ethereum and Defi. I'll see you for another video. Bye.
