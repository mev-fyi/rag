00:00:00.330 - 00:00:20.910, Speaker A: Today I receive Julian Butleu. How to describe Julian? Investor, entrepreneur, software developer, Defi enthusiast. Julian is one of these guys who does 100 different things at the same time and seemed to be great at everything. Welcome, Julian.
00:00:21.490 - 00:00:23.742, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. Hello.
00:00:23.876 - 00:00:31.218, Speaker A: So, Julian, as I ask each of my guests, the big question, how you got into blockchain?
00:00:31.314 - 00:01:10.910, Speaker B: It's a bit of a long story, but the short story is. So my background is mathematics and engineer. I moved to the state, I was involved. I mean, my master was in computer science, specialized in learning and deployed systems, stopped working for security defense company, moved to Europe, in Belgium. Then I had data center, like data center for that in my attic. And one of my friend in late eleven told me to challenge me to run this mathematical algorithm. It appeared to be bitcoin.
00:01:10.910 - 00:01:36.426, Speaker B: So then everything fall down into Mongox story and then Ethereum in 2015 in length, because I went to a bitcoin meetup and some people were talking about Ethereum, they were saying that it was a scam back then and bitcoin was the best. And then I took a look into it and I got quite excited about it and that's how I basically end up in a blockchain world. Oh, my God.
00:01:36.448 - 00:01:47.040, Speaker A: So that means you're one of these guy, which is mine, bitcoin at the very beginning, and then maybe forgot about it and woke up one day and like, oh my God, what happened? This is amazing.
00:01:49.010 - 00:02:26.634, Speaker B: Yeah, that was not the very beginning, but yeah, it was kind of late 2011, probably like two years after a year and a half, but I woke up in my Mongox account, basically, that's the empty gox, the bank in Japan that had 80% of all the bitcoin back then that got hacked by a russian guy. So I'm still like, in a part of the class auction with all these things. It's a unique story, I would say. I mean, all the people part of this Mongox stuff.
00:02:26.752 - 00:02:39.790, Speaker A: Yeah, this Mongox thing is such a famous event that happened in the blockchain world. I almost wish I lost some bitcoin in Mongox. So that I can also say, yeah, I was part of Mongox.
00:02:44.130 - 00:03:24.480, Speaker B: I was thinking about some people were actually talking about building an NFT badge, because what you can do with Mongox when you're actually part of the class auction on Mongox, they give you access to a token, I mean, authentication token, two FA token on your phone that you can basically prove that you are part of this class. So if you could actually easily make an NFT token for all the people that are actually part of this class auction or part of the MtGox stolen account, and you can basically prove that you got something that you want to say.
00:03:26.690 - 00:03:41.342, Speaker A: That's really cool. So you were doing this, and then you went from being a software developer to an entrepreneur and investor that runs an investment fund. So how did you make that switch?
00:03:41.406 - 00:04:28.702, Speaker B: Well, I'm still like a software developer. I basically spend most of my day 50, 60% programming. I wouldn't say like maybe front end programming, but mostly like back end programming maybe. So basically, after two years in Belgium, I left Belgium and then we went in Singapore. I was the CTO of Adventure business capital as well, over there specializing entrepreneurship. My friend asked me to go there, and then after a couple of months, I left and went to London where I started working for another startup. Was the first employee for the startup.
00:04:28.702 - 00:05:00.750, Speaker B: After two years, I basically started my own company in consulting. That was machine learning, consulting and all things about programming, mostly in web development. And in 2017, 2018, I recently focused the entire consulting company into blockchain. That's where right after that, I start building. Working on new companies. Yeah, basically. That's a long story.
00:05:00.900 - 00:05:12.542, Speaker A: So you started stake capital, so that's an investment fund focused on blockchain, and so you invest assets in different staking systems. Yeah.
00:05:12.596 - 00:05:58.480, Speaker B: So right before stake capital, we started a company called Flying Carpet. Flying Carpet was a company specialized in data observation from space. So we used satellite data to make prediction on the financial market. So for example, build a machine learning algorithm that can predict the production of coffee in Brazil, and then we could utilize that data to sell it to hedge funds. So then they can place the bet on the market. So any kind of commodity, and also, for example, the carbon credits market. So you can basically monitor a piece of forest and then calculate the production of carbon, like the absorption of carbon in the near future, and you can tokenize this.
00:05:58.480 - 00:07:03.214, Speaker B: That was actually really financial assets. And then I saw the market migrating into proof of stake. And because of my experience in bitcoin mining, bitcoin mining and then ethereum mining, I was like, oh, wow, this is actually a huge opportunity because I had personal asset and also friends assets that they needed some validation. So instead of using those assets, and then instead of using external services, I thought about building my own staking as a service, like undergoing staking as a service, but not a company. And then I quickly realized that it could be actually profitable. So that's how we start, Stacy, is to basically do validation on assets that need a validation. So we started with a few big partnerships like BSO.
00:07:03.214 - 00:07:38.794, Speaker B: That's the one that are used to equinix. Equinix is the biggest service worldwide. We also did like massive partnership with AWS for cloud services, but not just like free credits or whatsoever. It's actually like a real partnership with them. And then instead of doing this for ourselves, we thought about opening this kind of validation for the retails. And this is how we became probably like top three of five in a staking as a service industry. So now stake capital is very well recognized in the market for doing validating for different assets.
00:07:38.794 - 00:08:27.680, Speaker B: We do support about 1820 different assets, and our specialization is really, we focus on different verticals. So we focus on decentralized finance, obviously, but also like music, with audios, game, with Soha, we focus on two different verticals, because we want to be like an entire scope of blockchain and decentralization. And then eight, nine months ago, thinking as a service is good, it's difficult to scale because you need to grow the team. So it requires a lot of time on DevOps. So then my background is really like into mathematics and quants, high frequency trading, arbitrage in the traditional market. So I'm really into decentralized finance. So then I thought about moving.
00:08:27.680 - 00:08:57.190, Speaker B: So now, staking as a service is only 20% of the business model of stakeout, liquidity provider, market makers. And most of the business model is about arbitrage. So that's what we do. We focus on the market. We build algorithm, we build different scripts for doing all these kind of like three biggest pdas, market makers, liquidity provider, and arbitrage.
00:08:59.130 - 00:09:10.926, Speaker A: So you also start to focus on a lot of. Start to focus on Defi. And have you looked into liquidation, for example?
00:09:11.108 - 00:10:17.086, Speaker B: The reason why I looked into recreation was because we built the first flash loan on the market. And then as soon as we built flash loans, that's how we released flashboard, arbitrage, dow. And then a lot of people got interested in flash loan. And soon after, I think it was like one or two weeks after, people actually start using flash loan to do some kind of hacks or vulnerabilities, depending how you describe such activity on a decentralized ecosystem. So we actually utilize those flash loans to just empower some arbitrage. And what you quickly realize is that flash loans are good for liquidation, because liquidation, you need high capital, you need like a huge amount of liquidity, and then that amount of liquidity, that amount of arbitrage opportunity that you can capture on the market. Is actually reasonably big enough to cover the cost of borrowing money inside the liquidation.
00:10:17.086 - 00:10:45.610, Speaker B: So back then there was like an ave that was a zero point 35% fees on the money you could borrow. So for example, if you borrow $10,000, then you have zero point 35% fees on the top of it. So you actually needed to have an opportunity arbitrage opportunity at least of $35. So it's actually flashback good for liquidation. And this is how we actually end up doing flat for liquidation, but then we do all type of arbitrage.
00:10:46.590 - 00:10:54.762, Speaker A: Interesting. So now with all these defi projects going on, like other couple of projects that really interest you in particular.
00:10:54.896 - 00:11:33.482, Speaker B: Yeah, obviously I'm a big fan. It depends on what you're looking into. In a vertical of DeFi, you have, for example, paraswap. Powerswap is also like a french company, the CEO is great. Powerswap is decentralized aggregator. So you can basically swap any asset at the best market price, because they utilize all the different routes. And then they find, for example, if you want to change $1,000, like a thousand die, ten e, fine.
00:11:33.482 - 00:12:24.866, Speaker B: And you want to buy die, then maybe your ten e will be using Kyber Zero X, and then another DAP like ave or like curve. And then we'll do like 10%, 20%, and then boom, you'll get all the die at the best price without minimum sleepage. And another project for yield. I think it's curve finance. I think curve finance is probably one of the biggest potential on the market at the moment. It's playing in the same kind of basket of uniswap, balancer, compound and all different things. But the advantage of curb finance is the one that is responsible, like the CEO and probably the CTO and Michael is someone that actually builds everything.
00:12:24.866 - 00:12:33.660, Speaker B: So every day is actually shipping a new integration, a new pool, et cetera. So it's really exciting, because every day, curve finance is moving very fast.
00:12:34.770 - 00:12:39.934, Speaker A: Wow, this is really fascinating. Yeah, go ahead.
00:12:39.972 - 00:13:11.782, Speaker B: Curve finance is actually an auto market maker. Auto market maker. In traditional finance, we have market maker. So people that try to make the price or offer liquidity for people to buy certain of assets, and they buy and sell at the same time, and then they make profits on the spread. Curve finance. At the moment, it's focused on stable coins. Curve finance provide on chain algorithmic formula for doing auto market maker.
00:13:11.782 - 00:13:24.350, Speaker B: So anyone provide liquidity into curve will basically make a yield per year based on the fees that maintaining the pay one to one is going into the pools.
00:13:25.330 - 00:13:50.902, Speaker A: And I think this is really huge because people don't realize it. But to be a market maker, it's actually quite complex. You need to know exactly how much to bid, how often to readjust your buy and sell orders. And so really that's out of reach for most people. So, yeah, with curve, you can just send your token and boom, you're a market maker instantly. Yeah. So it's pretty cool.
00:13:50.902 - 00:14:17.978, Speaker A: And what I really appreciate in our conversation is that there are so many defi projects going on and sometimes it's a little bit difficult to know which one are really worth focusing on. So, yeah, it's really great to have the insight of an investor that really have some interesting things to say about that. Thanks a lot, Julian. If people want to reach out to you, I guess they can contact you by Twitter.
00:14:18.154 - 00:14:19.706, Speaker B: Yeah, my Twitter.
00:14:19.898 - 00:14:21.182, Speaker A: Okay, well, I'll put it in.
00:14:21.236 - 00:14:23.338, Speaker B: You can search the name online, Julian.
00:14:23.514 - 00:14:35.890, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll put it in the description. Okay, Julian, well, thank you a lot for your time, and I wish you good luck for state capital and all your blockchain projects. Bye.
