00:00:03.120 - 00:00:47.330, Speaker A: You and we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on Ethereum, on the news of Ethereum and defy. I'm Julian, your host, and we doing this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. And if you know me on either blocks my channel, I explain blockchain development. And for people who are new here, if you want to learn how you can become a professional blockchain developer and make one hundred k a year, check out my free training on. This is the wrong link.
00:00:47.330 - 00:01:06.740, Speaker A: Why do I have the wrong link? Oh my God. Julian. Bad preparation, bad preparation, bad link, bad link. Okay, this is the correct link. All right. Yeah, this is the free training if you want to learn how to become a professional blockchain developer. Hi everybody in the chat.
00:01:06.740 - 00:02:01.092, Speaker A: So we have Eric, we have Tshx, we have George, we have Jason Bourne, we have Jacob Rufino, Ogbuzuro Fado, many, many people. All right, so we're going to start with the price of ether because finally we go past the $2,000 resistance. And so we established a new all time high at $2,140. So it's really great. I'm really happy about this because this happened after weeks of going sideway. So maybe this will signal the return of the ether pump that we all been waiting. So this pump was largely fueled by the announcement of visa that they processed their first payment on Ethereum with USDC.
00:02:01.092 - 00:02:56.004, Speaker A: So really this was a really big news because if visa start to use Ethereum for payment, wow, that's going to be really huge. Okay, so the traffic on the website of Ethereum is up four times since December. So a huge surge of interest. Also very important. We have a lot of wealth of the ether, of wealth that is going out of exchanges. And this is usually very bullish for ether because usually people, they go to exchanges when they want to sell their crypto, but when they take out their crypto, it means that they want to hold all for a while. They want to keep the ether in their wallet.
00:02:56.004 - 00:03:30.832, Speaker A: So this is a really positive stats in terms of gas price. So gas price are stable, but on a really high plateau. And we broke above the 200 gray limit here, which hasn't happened since the end of February. So this is a signal that this is a return of the bull market on Ethereum. For the market cap of DFI, we just broke 50 billion. So that's a new all time high. And also the number of ether that is locked in defi keeps rising.
00:03:30.832 - 00:04:27.400, Speaker A: We had a huge increase this week, so that was caused by a whale that moved a lot of ether to compounds. That's why here we have this really big increase suddenly in terms of market cap of the major defi project, let me switch back to dollar. So compan took the first place before it was maker for a long time. Uniswap also took back its place as the first decks in front of Uniswap. This is probably because of the announcement for Uniswap V three. So generally Uniswap is more popular for wells, whereas sushi swap is more popular for retail investors. And I went down the ranking just to see what's happening with other protocol and I found an interesting stat with IDEX.
00:04:27.400 - 00:05:11.028, Speaker A: So IDEX was released even before Uniswap. But you can see that in terms of adoption is much, much smaller. They have only 21 million of liquidity because they use the old model of the onchain order book. So that really show you the power of the automated market maker model. Basically that was invented by Uniswap. So yeah, IDX even before Uniswap, but just complete in terms of adoption, just way, way behind Uniswap. Okay, so then we're going to see quickly the rate.
00:05:11.028 - 00:06:08.188, Speaker A: So this week the best rate is 32% for SUSD. So the stablecoin of synthetics on Ave, it's the second week in the world where it provide the highest yield for lenders. Then we have twelve point 77 for USDC on compounds quite high, 1176 for tether on Ave. So not so long ago we had a way higher lending rate on centralized lending platform like blockfi or Fulcrum, but it's not the case anymore. So that's interesting to note. All right, so next we're going to continue with news about the major d five project. So we're going to start with zkSync.
00:06:08.188 - 00:06:47.596, Speaker A: So this is an l two scaling solution for Ethereum that is using the zero knowledge technology. And so they release a new roadmap for their v two. So for their v two they will have smart contract capabilities. The v two will not use the Ethereum virtual machine. It will use its own virtual machine called the Zinc VM. They also will have their own programming language for smart contracts, but very important because their zinc VM supports the YOL language, which is a compilation target of solidity. It will be easy to port solidity contracts to Zk sync.
00:06:47.596 - 00:07:30.048, Speaker A: So that's very, very important for adoption. The v two will also have a native support for Ethereum wallets. It will be able to process 20,000 transactions per seconds, which is way more than for Ethereum main net and in terms of transaction cost. So they will have two kind of transaction. One of them will be about 100th of the cost of mainnet transaction and the other kind of transaction will be a fixed one dollars cost per transaction in terms of the timeline. So we're going to have a public testnet release in May this year. And for main net they are targeting August and before the launch of the v two.
00:07:30.048 - 00:08:29.828, Speaker A: The v one which is currently deployed will have an update and it will have a lot of features for the NFTs and this will be live in May. Then next update for quick swap, which is a decentralized exchange running on polygon, which is another l two scaling solution for Ethereum. So it has seen a 57% increase in the number of active user in the last seven days, and it became the first DAP on Polygon. So it's nice to see some adoption here for L2 scaling solution. That's how Ethereum is going to take back the lead in the DFI space. Then some news about Polygon, which was formerly called the Matic network. So the number of daily unique active wallet grew by almost 500%.
00:08:29.828 - 00:09:20.340, Speaker A: Quarter on quarter annual transaction volume increased by almost 300%, reaching $500 million. So yeah, a lot of activity on Ethereum l two here. Okay, so next big new project in DFI, the Fay stablecoin. So it attracted $1.2 billion in liquidity, is the fastest in DFI. There was never a DFI project that attracted so much liquidity so fast in the past. And so one of the main feature of this stablecoin is that it doesn't rely on any centralized collateral, which is one of the criticism against the DAI stablecoin.
00:09:20.340 - 00:10:08.092, Speaker A: So yeah, there is a lot of competition in the stablecoin. Basically everybody want to find a stable coin which is completely decentralized and also very stable at the same time. But that's something that is very difficult to achieve. All right, so next I wanted to show you this project openogs info. So this show you the treasury of the main Daos in DeFi. So that's a great example of a simple and useful project that you could do in one weekend as a developer. And so a part of the money in this DaO can be used to pay developers.
00:10:08.092 - 00:10:41.812, Speaker A: So that really shows you that there is no shortage of money to pay developers in DeFi. So here you can see Uniswap. They have a treasury of more than $5 billion. Actually recently the CEO of Uniswap asked on Twitter how to spend the money of the treasury because they have too much money. Yeah, compound almost 2 billion ave 1 billion. So yeah, this is absolutely insane. All right, so next we going to talk of NFT with this market report of DAP radar.
00:10:41.812 - 00:11:17.112, Speaker A: And so for the Q one, the first quarter in 2021, there was more than $1.5 billion in transaction volume for NFT. And so the biggest contributors were NBA, Topshot, cryptopunk and OpenC. That accounted for about 73% of the total transaction volume. Also interesting to see the Google trend for DeFI and NFT. Let me see, where is this stuff? Is it the next one? Oh, damn. No.
00:11:17.112 - 00:12:00.576, Speaker A: Okay, I forgot to load this tab, but I think it's in this article. So basically you can see that the Google trend for NFT is going up like crazy. So there is like a huge surge of interest. So since the beginning of blockchain, we've always been looking for the magical application that will make blockchain go mainstream. So I really love DeFi. But in terms of going mainstream, I already start to think that NFT could be more helpful than Defi because we have all these major stars that popularize NFT to really large audience. So I think NFT, this is it.
00:12:00.576 - 00:13:07.644, Speaker A: This could be this magical application that makes blockchain really famous. Next, I want to show you the top ten for NFT sale. Where did I put this? Where did I put the top ten? Okay, another missing tab. Okay, well, basically the point I was trying to make with this article I'm missing here in my tab is like, so this is another interesting report of DAB redder that showed the top ten of the NFT sale. And so this is composed mainly of what we call onchain generative art. So these are NFT where the image depends on data generated on chain, like a crypto punk, for example. And what's great about this is that as a developer, you can create a project like this because you don't need to have as much artistic talent as opposed to when you do some drawing, for example.
00:13:07.644 - 00:14:00.430, Speaker A: So even as a developer, you can create a successful NFT project. Then we're going to talk of primary versus secondary markets in NFT. So we've all heard of these crazy NFT sales, but are we in a bubble? So for this, we need to see if there is a secondary market. So currently the primary market is much bigger than the secondary market on super rare, the second biggest NFT marketplace. The secondary market is 36% of the total NFT sales volume. But secondary market is growing much faster than the primary market. And we had some example of NFT flippers who buy NFT as on price and resell it at a much higher price on secondary market.
00:14:00.430 - 00:14:51.172, Speaker A: So yeah, if we really want this NFT thing to be sustainable, we do need to see very active secondary market in the coming months. So yeah, we'll need to pay attention to these metrics. Then we're going to talk of palm, which is a new big NFT project. So that's a project of consensus. So Palm is an NFT sidechain connected to Ethereum. So this is done in partnership with the Henny Group and Heide Films, which are respectively companies specialized in arts and filmmaking. So it's great to have that kind of skills in the project because it's a great complement with the engineering skills of consensus.
00:14:51.172 - 00:15:39.432, Speaker A: So with their new NFT side chain, they will have low gas costs, fast transaction and it will be much more energy efficient than proof of work. It will be accessible via metamask. And a couple of projects already announced that they will launch on this side chain. So uniswap V three will launch trading will launch NFT trading on this side chain. We'll have also nifty, which is an NFT protocol and a couple of other NFT project. So most of the sidechain and the different l two scaling solution developed for ethereum are mainly designed for DFI. But NFT are really exploding.
00:15:39.432 - 00:16:25.340, Speaker A: And if we want Ethereum to capture this segment of the industry, we need scaling solutions designed for NFT. So I'm very happy to start to see some scaling solution on Ethereum that focuses on. Then we're going to talk of a new big NFT sale. So that's from Saturday Night Live, which is a famous show in the US. So they are selling their first NFT. So this comes after a viral sketch they did on NFT. So basically they took an excerpt of this sketch and they turned it into an NFT and they're selling it.
00:16:25.340 - 00:16:55.750, Speaker A: So the auction ends today and currently stands at $33,000. Let me see. Do I have the NFT somewhere? Does it show? Yeah, I think it's this thing here. Yeah. $33,000 for this. Then another big NFT sale of the week is overly attached girlfriend. So it sold for $400,000.
00:16:55.750 - 00:17:45.492, Speaker A: So the creator is someone who become famous for creating a meme in 2012. And so she decided to transform the meme into an NFT. So from what I understand, she is not an artist. I may be wrong, but I don't think she's not an artist, just a random person on the Internet who just became famous for a meme. And she was able to monetize this finally with an NFT. Next, another big sale of the week from Arac, who is a musician who sold several NFT for a total of $700,000. And so I quote, he said, I just made more income in one day that I've ever received for three of my original albums in almost ten years of work.
00:17:45.492 - 00:18:42.312, Speaker A: So I don't know this musician, but I google his name and I found an entry in Wikipedia and he also has a YouTube channel with 23 million views. So he's not a beginner, he's already established, and yet he made way more money with just a couple of NFT than in his whole career as a musician. So that really show you the power of NFT to provide income for artists. Then I want to show you this startup that basically is doing a digital, basically doing a physical frame to showcase your NFT. So I was talking about this a few episodes ago. I was talking of basically a potential great product for startup to do exactly this product. So yeah, in the future, when you invite some guests at home, you want to show off a little bit.
00:18:42.312 - 00:19:37.690, Speaker A: You want to show off the latest cool nft you bought. And I think that's super important because the main reason why people buy art is because they want to show their art to other people. So yeah, really interesting to see this. Dapper Labs just raised $305,000,000 from top investors. So Dapper Lab, this is the company that created cryptokitties, which was one of the first crypto game to become famous in 2018. At that time, that actually clogged the Ethereum network. Yes, they raised really a lot of money and this is to build a blockchain for game, basically.
00:19:37.690 - 00:20:10.516, Speaker A: Okay, so then we're going to continue with some news from PayPal. It's one of the big news of the week. So they launched a new service which is called Checkout for crypto. So it allows PayPal user to pay merchant in crypto. So this includes bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin. So the choice of crypto is really strange because bitcoin, cash and litecoin have become completely relevant in 2021. The payment.
00:20:10.516 - 00:20:40.712, Speaker A: So when a customer makes a payment to a merchant, this will be converted to fiat money. So it's not actually paid in crypto. So PayPal said that they won't charge their customer for swapping, for making the payment from crypto. To fiat. But however, there will be a conversion spread, which means that the rate of conversion to fiat will be lower than market rate. So there will be a fee. It's just that it's a little bit more sneaky.
00:20:40.712 - 00:21:36.480, Speaker A: Exactly like for Robinhood. So a couple of months ago, PayPal already announced a feature allowing PayPal user to change their PayPal money into crypto, but it was very limited because you could only go back and forth between your PayPal money and crypto, but you couldn't really transfer the crypto to another address. So now with this new service, it makes their crypto offering a little bit more useful for users. But still, for people who already have crypto outside of PayPal and want to pay merchant with it, they won't be able to use this new service of PayPal. It's not extremely useful. But this is bullish for crypto, because a lot of PayPal users will choose to keep their PayPal money in crypto to enjoy the price appreciation. And so it will lock some crypto for long term.
00:21:36.480 - 00:22:23.024, Speaker A: Next, we have a new product launching. So this is a robot advisor for crypto. This is called Macara. And so they will offer seven baskets composed of different crypto. And the backend will be powered by the Gemini exchange, which is the exchange of the Winklevos browser. So this will help investors that are struggling with the proliferation of more and more crypto assets and also users that are not very tech savvy and don't really want to deal with wallets themselves. This is basically a centralized solution for investing in crypto in a very simple way.
00:22:23.024 - 00:23:12.028, Speaker A: And so they will take a 1% fee, which is way higher than the usual zero point 25 for other robot advisor. Then we had a hack this week of the fourth Dao. So it was hacked for about $400,000. So there were five attackers and one of them which returned the fund. And so the bug has been identified by the team, but the token plunge of 80% in 24 hours. Then we're going to talk of CDBC. So central bank digital currencies.
00:23:12.028 - 00:24:13.380, Speaker A: So the bank of Japan will start experimenting with CDBC as a payment instrument. So the interest in CDBC and contactless payment has grown a lot with the COVID pandemic. And so there was a survey by the bank of International settlement that showed that 86% of central banks are actively researching the potential for. Then we had some news of potential new regulation for bitcoin in the US. So the ex SEC chair Jay Clayton warned that new regulation around bitcoins could be coming soon. So currently bitcoin is considered a non security by the SEC. But yeah, it might change at some point.
00:24:13.380 - 00:25:12.100, Speaker A: The SEC also so far has refused to approve any ETF for bitcoin and has also sued ripple. So yeah, we are unfortunately expecting some bad news from the SEC later this year, maybe against then. Then we're going to talk of the bitcoin market. So JP Morgan said that the recent decrease in volatility of bitcoin will make it more appealing to institutions that seek local relation assets that diversify portfolio. So with a low volatility, bitcoin could be more interesting than gold and we could have a target of $130,000. So at the moment, bitcoin three months volatility is 86%, which is to be compared with 16% for gold. So we still have a lot of margin before it's comparable to gold in terms of volatility.
00:25:12.100 - 00:25:56.084, Speaker A: Then Morgan Stanley announced that they plan to release a bitcoin product. So they will allow twelve of their mutual funds to invest in bitcoin in two ways, through bitcoin futures and through Grayscale bitcoin trust. And that was also another big bank that announced some future crypto offerings. So Goldman Sachs will offer some bitcoin investment to their wealth management client in the second quarter. And I quote, they said there is a contingent of clients who are looking to this asset as a hedge against inflation. And the macro backdrop over the past year has certainly played into that. Yes.
00:25:56.084 - 00:27:00.164, Speaker A: So for those who haven't been following the financial market recently, one of the big worries of the market is rising inflation and also rising price of commodities. So a lot of the commodities are going up like crazy because right now this is the economic recovery of the role. So people are trying to hedge against this. Then interesting market research here that said that bitcoin has decoupled from stocks and gold, but it's inversely correlated to dollar. So for a long time we criticize bitcoin for being too colorated to stock, especially during the market crash last year in March when the COVID pandemic started. So it's a good sign that finally it's not corrected anymore because it can play better its role of diversification asset. And last thing I wanted to show you, so quick news is more for developers.
00:27:00.164 - 00:27:56.520, Speaker A: So if you want to do an airdrop, you can use this project Astro drop that allow you to do this is basically a gas efficient way to do an airdrop by using merkle tree. So this uses some advanced crypto to do an airdrop in a gas efficient way, basically because if you do an airdrop in the most simple way, by just sending the token to the different addresses of the list very quickly, it can cost a lot of gas. Okay, so yeah, we're going to do the Q and A. So very quickly I'm going to copy paste the link to my free training on how to become a professional blockchain developer. So if you are new on my channel and you want to learn how you can make $100,000 per year as a blockchain developer, you have to follow this training. This is completely free. I put the link in the chat.
00:27:56.520 - 00:28:48.944, Speaker A: Oh yeah. For those who were here during the last live stream last week. So I basically sent a poll to everybody asking how you guys want to select the future content of idoblocks. There were different solution, one with a token, one with a web app, and different other options. So so far it seems like most people want a token and a decentralized application. So I'm going to close the vote soon this week and I'll do a dedicated video to talk about this. But yeah, it seems like we are going to the solution with a token for eat the blocks.
00:28:48.944 - 00:29:25.392, Speaker A: But yeah, I will do another video where I give more detail. All right, so let me go up in the chat and see what kind of question we have. Jason Boone say, how did you know a Tinder girl visited Julian? What? Let me see what kind of question we have. Hi from Cambodia. Hi from Mexico, Alexander Barry. Hi, Julian. Thanks for streaming tshx.
00:29:25.392 - 00:29:40.984, Speaker A: Did you know that people lost their nfts? No, I had no idea about this. GNB is. Hi, frenchie. Hey man. Dunkler lot, what is your favorite stable coin? Just die, I guess. This is simple. This is decentralized.
00:29:40.984 - 00:30:10.100, Speaker A: I mean, not as decentralized as some people want, but yeah, die is cool. Ether above 2100 gas fees, terrible. Yeah, sucks. Clinton, hi. From South Africa. Hey, man. Clay O'Neill, don't rebasing token count as a stable coin that don't require collateral? Yes, it's correct, Clay.
00:30:10.100 - 00:31:05.872, Speaker A: All right, you remember, what does this mean for DMG? Can you give more context? I'm not sure to see what this question about cinobite is the BSE hype over. Well, the initial hype, yes. Now it's going to have a high plateau and I think it's going to remain high. But as we have some l two scaling solution that start to go live on Ethereum, we're going to see some money flowing from binance smart chain to this l two chain. Yeah, that's for sure. Moro allegrini where's the poll? You can find the link to the poll in the latest live stream of last week. James Miller.
00:31:05.872 - 00:31:39.436, Speaker A: Hey, I'm a huge fan. Thanks, man. I already make over $100,000 a year, but I'm going to take your course because I just started blockchain holding company and I'm working on a series of smart contracts. Great. Yeah, I mean, you know, like when I say $100,000 a year, I'm actually pretty conservative. So there is a number of blockchain developers who make more than this, especially if you have a specialization like in D five, for example. Are you really good in solidity? You can go to 100 and 5200, but I like to give a conservative estimate.
00:31:39.436 - 00:32:22.110, Speaker A: So that's why I say $100,000 only, quote unquote only because for a lot of people this is a really good amount. George Kenichi saying a token with an airdrop for your. Yeah, yeah, we're probably going to do this. Yes, I'm going to do another video this week just about this, going to give more detail. James Miller the r token project does almost exactly what I want. Can you do a video forking it with the r prefix change? Hey, it rings the bell. Is it a token to redirect some interest? Because I think I did the video on that.
00:32:22.110 - 00:33:01.580, Speaker A: Do a search art token tutorial because I think I did a video of that like six months ago. I do so many videos sometime I forgot what I did. What do we have? Alexanderberry, will you do videos about Polygon and Matic project Ave just launched on there? Yes, absolutely. Luke Mala Farina, what do you think of uniswap v? Three pros and cons? Yeah, I love it. And I covered this last week, so. Yeah, check. Last week I covered this in depth.
00:33:01.580 - 00:33:45.210, Speaker A: Jason Boone. Hi, Julian. Checking out if the girl is visible? Yeah, I mean, I was like, what did I, did I leave something in the background or what? Frank Ziggler, salute. Julian, do you have a list of Dex aggregator for ETH L2 and for finance, smart chain with reliable API. For the moment I've only identified one inch and open ocean. Yeah, I haven't researched Dex aggregators in detail. I just know that one inch is really the market leader in this.
00:33:45.210 - 00:34:22.980, Speaker A: Yeah, that's all I can say. Clay, do you think rebasing token have potential to become widespread and useful, stable coins? Yes, but the problem of rebasing token is at the moment they are very volatile so they're not really usable. So we still need to work on the algorithm. Yeah, so we're not there, but definitely this is the future. A young discovery. Would you give me some discount to flash loan student to enter blockchain course? Yes. I typically don't do individual discount for courses.
00:34:22.980 - 00:35:03.164, Speaker A: Sometimes I do like special offer for a bundle, but yeah, no individual discount. James Miller yes, it redirects interest from lending protocol to charity. I check it out. Thanks. Yeah, so I'm pretty sure I did a tutorial about this. Yeah. Moro allegrini do you think arbitrage plus flash on binance smart chain is still worth it? Yeah, because what's cool on binance smart chain is that it's cheaper to experiment because when you fail in arbitrage you still have to pay for the transaction fee which can be expensive quickly on ethereum, but on binance smart chain it's a little bit more acceptable.
00:35:03.164 - 00:35:25.530, Speaker A: So for example, you can do an arbitrage between a bakery swap and pancake swap. I did a video about this. I did a video about this like a couple of weeks ago. So yeah, do some research on my channel. You'll find something interesting. Satoshi Nakumoto, you'll like to join a new coin Corp shareholder. Contact me.
00:35:25.530 - 00:36:37.280, Speaker A: What's that? Is it a joke or scam? Nilesh G-H-A which coin to buy now? Oh my God, what a question. First of all, never invest more than what you can afford to lose. And I would say I like all the coins for the l two scaling solution because this is going to grow a lot in the future. Also I like any sort of dao or index that invest into NfT because NfT are going to keep exploding. But it's a bit hard to select which NfT project to invest in, especially if you're not really an art expert. So yeah, better to just invest in some dao or index that select for you the good project. All right, Nilesh Marciano, what's the name of the video with the link to the vote? Okay, so it's the previous live stream.
00:36:37.280 - 00:37:04.810, Speaker A: So I do a live stream every week and then there is like one live stream, three video, one live stream. So if you go to the video section of my channel, it should be three video. Okay, you know what, I'm going to find it for you. Okay, you know what, let me find it. So YouTube. Let's go to my channel. Let's go to your channel.
00:37:04.810 - 00:37:56.264, Speaker A: Okay, where is it? Where is it? This one? I'm going to put it in the chat. This link here, check out the description of this video and you'll find a link to the poll. What else do we have? What else do we have? Jason Boone, have you checked terra money ecosystem writing smart contract there? Not yet. What's about them? Do they have a booming defi ecosystem? Something like this? I've heard that something is happening on avalanche. Apparently. Like avalanche. I know in defi they're big, but yeah, terra money.
