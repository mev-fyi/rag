00:00:00.490 - 00:00:37.538, Speaker A: In this video, I'm going to explain you the difference between debugging a call versus a transaction. Not knowing the differences between the two got me confused for a long time when I started coding. Smart contract so make sure to pay attention to this video. This video is an extract of a full course on smart contract debugging for solidity. You can create a free account on idoblox Pro to have access of the source code of the free episodes. When you interact with an Ethereum smart contract, you communicate with the API of Ethereum. This API is actually called the JSON RPC interface.
00:00:37.538 - 00:01:06.414, Speaker A: Don't worry if the name make it sound complicated. Under the hood is just a regular HTTP interface. This JSON RPC interface has different methods which are equivalent to routes for rest APIs. You can find a list of all the method at this URL. There are two methods that can be used to call the function of a smart contract. S underscore call and s underscore send transaction. S call is used if your solidity function has the view or the pure keyword.
00:01:06.414 - 00:01:54.990, Speaker A: Constant works too, but it's deprecated. F underscore send transaction is used if your solidity function has neither view pure or constant. When you use ethical, it means that your function will not modify the Ethereum blockchain and you will not spend any ether for the execution of the function. When you use eth underscore send transaction, it means that your function will potentially modify the Ethereum blockchain and that the execution of the function will cost ether. But when it comes to debugging, the biggest difference is that with calls you can use written statements in your the function, but not events, whereas with transactions it's exactly the contrary. The lesson of the story is that when you are debugging a function in your smart contract, make sure to be aware if it's a call or a transaction. That's it for this video.
00:01:54.990 - 00:02:00.890, Speaker A: In the next video, I'll tell you about the difference between syntax, runtime and logic errors in solidity.
