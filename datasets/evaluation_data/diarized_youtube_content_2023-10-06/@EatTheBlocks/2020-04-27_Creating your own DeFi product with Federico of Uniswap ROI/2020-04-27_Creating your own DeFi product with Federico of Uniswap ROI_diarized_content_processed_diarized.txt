00:00:00.410 - 00:00:09.418, Speaker A: Hi everybody. In this video I receive Federico, a very prolific developer in the Defi space. Welcome, Federico.
00:00:09.514 - 00:00:17.338, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. My name is Federico. I've been working in a few DeFi projects.
00:00:17.434 - 00:00:25.298, Speaker C: Specifically, some people watching may know, especially if they invest in unis.
00:00:25.434 - 00:00:31.506, Speaker B: One is called YouTube RoI, which is calculator for Defi investment, like the returns.
00:00:31.538 - 00:00:48.214, Speaker C: And to track your investments plus other projects. I found actually we connected with Julianne with your channel, and I used myself some of your video for learning more about the blockchain, especially at the beginning.
00:00:48.262 - 00:00:51.834, Speaker B: So thanks for the material and yeah.
00:00:51.872 - 00:00:56.800, Speaker C: Very excited to whatever to be discussed with you today.
00:00:57.250 - 00:01:26.390, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, I think I remember the first time you posted your link to Uniswap ri like more than a year ago on the ETH dev subreddit, and there was a lot of upvotes. And so can you remind us first what is Uniswap? Because I'm sure there are some people who watch this video and they don't even know what is Uniswap. So yeah, let's start from the beginning, because your tool basically built on top of Uniswap. So people need to first understand Uniswap.
00:01:27.870 - 00:01:35.146, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So basically Uniswap is a decentralized exchange. So the way it works is like.
00:01:35.168 - 00:01:42.314, Speaker C: User go to Uniswap to exchange typically ethereum for a token like theorem for a die or die for Ethereum.
00:01:42.442 - 00:01:44.826, Speaker B: In doing that, they pay a fee.
00:01:44.858 - 00:01:47.806, Speaker C: Which is a 0.3% of what the.
00:01:47.828 - 00:01:51.870, Speaker B: Value is, what this fee then basically.
00:01:51.940 - 00:01:59.170, Speaker C: Gets transferred to the people that are supplying the liquidity. So everybody can really provide liquidity to uniswap.
00:01:59.510 - 00:02:02.226, Speaker B: You need to decide what token you.
00:02:02.248 - 00:02:05.982, Speaker C: Want to pull liquidity for, for example, Dai or maker.
00:02:06.046 - 00:02:07.806, Speaker B: And then you will put your Dai.
00:02:07.838 - 00:02:10.306, Speaker C: And maker along with Ethereum into the pool.
00:02:10.418 - 00:02:12.390, Speaker B: And then by doing that, you invest.
00:02:12.460 - 00:02:15.766, Speaker C: And you accumulated the fees that the user are paying.
00:02:15.868 - 00:02:21.574, Speaker B: And so you create a return. What I built is built on top of Uniswap.
00:02:21.622 - 00:02:23.226, Speaker C: So for all the people that are.
00:02:23.248 - 00:02:34.446, Speaker B: Investing, they're asking Oba, how is my investment performing? What's the return? All the different components. They can basically plug their Ethereum address.
00:02:34.548 - 00:02:42.638, Speaker C: In the tool that I made, and they can see charts and they can see the ROI and track all the metrics about their investment, basically.
00:02:42.804 - 00:02:47.842, Speaker A: That's cool. Can you give us a quick demo? Can you share your.
00:02:47.896 - 00:02:57.810, Speaker B: Sure. So basically this is Uniswap ROI. Well, that's the home page. You can log in if you don't have an account.
00:02:57.880 - 00:03:03.526, Speaker C: It's easy to create, you just get started. You put a username which is anonymous, you can pick whatever you want.
00:03:03.628 - 00:03:10.242, Speaker B: And then basically what you see is it's a page where you can essentially.
00:03:10.306 - 00:03:15.382, Speaker C: Enter your Ethereum address. Like if you made any purchase, any investment in Uniswap.
00:03:15.446 - 00:03:17.898, Speaker B: If you don't, there's an example you.
00:03:17.904 - 00:03:21.190, Speaker C: Can load, or you can load any address on the blockchain and monitor.
00:03:21.270 - 00:03:30.042, Speaker B: And then here you're going to see all the address that you searched with their analysis. So for example, what you see here on the right is all the pools.
00:03:30.106 - 00:03:32.762, Speaker C: That with this address you invested in.
00:03:32.916 - 00:03:42.462, Speaker B: And you see the current value of the investments. Some of these portfolio wallets that I'm monitoring here, they have some investment in Uniswap.
00:03:42.526 - 00:03:45.854, Speaker C: And you see essentially a few metrics.
00:03:45.902 - 00:03:55.590, Speaker B: Which are really like the KPIs, you can measure your investment with like the ROI, like the overall ROI, and then what was caused by the price.
00:03:55.660 - 00:03:59.240, Speaker C: So for example, Ethereum can go up, down, the token can go up down.
00:03:59.790 - 00:04:07.850, Speaker B: Create for you a return or a loss, and what was caused specifically by Uniswap. And then from here, from your address.
00:04:07.920 - 00:04:10.410, Speaker C: Let'S pick one, then you can click.
00:04:10.480 - 00:04:11.754, Speaker B: And then you can zoom in and.
00:04:11.792 - 00:04:18.650, Speaker C: Say, okay, so with this address, I invested, for example, in the free pools, right? USDC, vat dai.
00:04:18.730 - 00:04:29.006, Speaker B: And then for each of the pool you can again zoom in and see, okay, so here is the chart of your investment and what was caused by Uniswap.
00:04:29.038 - 00:04:31.378, Speaker C: So the yield of Uniswap, which by.
00:04:31.384 - 00:04:54.954, Speaker B: The way, for example, this person invested for a year, about half a year, and he got a pretty nice return. And what was the component of the price, plus lots of other micro details and parameters. And Uniswap can be pretty complicated. So if you really want to understand.
00:04:55.072 - 00:04:57.466, Speaker C: Investment, you have all the metrics you.
00:04:57.488 - 00:05:01.066, Speaker B: Need to do that. And if you also want to, for.
00:05:01.088 - 00:05:06.842, Speaker C: Example, download for taxes or something, you can export it in excel, your investment divestment.
00:05:06.906 - 00:05:10.014, Speaker B: So it makes it easier to check.
00:05:10.052 - 00:05:11.550, Speaker C: What you're doing, let's say.
00:05:11.620 - 00:05:13.754, Speaker B: And you can visualize this if you're.
00:05:13.802 - 00:05:16.546, Speaker C: Like a dollar investor, like most of.
00:05:16.568 - 00:05:18.066, Speaker B: Us, or if you are like an.
00:05:18.088 - 00:05:22.306, Speaker C: Ethereum investor, you can toggle this and you can see everything in Ethereum if.
00:05:22.328 - 00:05:29.634, Speaker B: You want, that's if you already invested, if you don't.
00:05:29.682 - 00:05:31.494, Speaker C: So probably your audience, maybe they are.
00:05:31.532 - 00:05:42.358, Speaker B: Not, whatever, maybe they're not investing in unison yet. So what you can do, from the home page you can check out the pool section, and here you can see the yield of different pools.
00:05:42.374 - 00:05:43.706, Speaker C: So if you still have to.
00:05:43.808 - 00:05:44.906, Speaker B: Whatever you want to see.
00:05:44.928 - 00:05:48.774, Speaker C: Okay, where should I maybe invest? What's the sort of expected ROI?
00:05:48.902 - 00:05:53.006, Speaker B: You can sort the pool, you can find the different pools and you can.
00:05:53.028 - 00:05:55.440, Speaker C: See, okay, so here there is certain.
00:05:55.810 - 00:06:04.434, Speaker B: Return or something that can be more profitable or less profitable. And you can understand maybe where to.
00:06:04.472 - 00:06:06.530, Speaker C: Participate in the pool.
00:06:09.590 - 00:06:29.640, Speaker A: There are really two things that really impressed me, is one, the number of feature. There are really many different things like that must have took you a lot of time to build all of this. And second is the quality of the user interface. Have you hired any designer or it's just you who did all of this?
00:06:30.810 - 00:06:41.934, Speaker B: Well, thank you. No, I built it myself. But by the way, myself, I'm not even a developer per se, I'm an engineer, but I'm more on the business side in a sense.
00:06:42.052 - 00:06:45.070, Speaker C: Always been working in the business side.
00:06:45.220 - 00:06:51.358, Speaker B: But yeah, for me, programming is more of a. I wouldn't say hobby, but.
00:06:51.444 - 00:06:55.214, Speaker C: Something I picked up by experience and.
00:06:55.332 - 00:07:05.606, Speaker B: More without a professional, let's say education per se. So it took some time, I would.
00:07:05.628 - 00:07:12.130, Speaker C: Say, for any defi project that maybe also your audience may be interested in, considering.
00:07:12.210 - 00:07:14.326, Speaker B: There's always like two components, and this.
00:07:14.348 - 00:07:18.886, Speaker C: Is very specific to DFI. So if you work on SaaS or B, two b, it's a totally different thing.
00:07:18.908 - 00:07:20.662, Speaker B: But if you work on DeFi or.
00:07:20.716 - 00:07:23.366, Speaker C: Crypto, whatever, there is this financial component.
00:07:23.478 - 00:07:34.362, Speaker B: That takes a lot of time. I mean, to me, understanding Uniswap really well took me like two weeks, three weeks of intense study and just modeling.
00:07:34.426 - 00:07:36.414, Speaker C: And excel and whatever.
00:07:36.532 - 00:07:39.454, Speaker B: Just understand, okay, exactly how all these.
00:07:39.492 - 00:07:42.000, Speaker C: Calculations should be made and how it works.
00:07:42.370 - 00:07:46.558, Speaker B: And then obviously whatever, more of the coding, right?
00:07:46.644 - 00:07:57.462, Speaker C: Front end and back end. This was launched, as you reminded, in the summer last year.
00:07:57.596 - 00:08:11.602, Speaker B: Then from then it was more of a constant adding of pieces. Also based on what people said, that's.
00:08:11.746 - 00:08:12.694, Speaker C: How it got it.
00:08:12.732 - 00:08:14.060, Speaker B: But thanks for.
00:08:15.710 - 00:09:15.840, Speaker A: Well, I can tell you that there are a lot of non professional developers who will very much like to be able to do a project like this. So yeah, this is awesome. I think actually if you do deFi project, this is quite important to do a nice front end, more so than for other projects in other industries, because really, what is a Defi app? This is mainly a front end. And then you have the smart contract and I think the bar is quite high. Like if you see the different DeFi project every time, the UI is quite slick. So if you are wondering where you should put your focus, they're finally in making the front end really nice. Okay, so this is actually only one of your project, but you have.
00:09:18.530 - 00:09:22.106, Speaker B: Basically, I got pretty excited about defi.
00:09:22.138 - 00:09:23.166, Speaker C: Now that I have a little bit.
00:09:23.188 - 00:09:30.354, Speaker B: Of time, I'm sort of experimenting with the other ideas. Like Uniswap arrive is more of a.
00:09:30.392 - 00:09:36.242, Speaker C: Platform where also I can interact with users, and maybe then I can suggest.
00:09:36.306 - 00:09:38.934, Speaker B: Other products or other ideas and really.
00:09:38.972 - 00:09:41.094, Speaker C: Work with them to make them happen.
00:09:41.292 - 00:09:53.754, Speaker B: So one thing that I noticed that got picked some people's interest is that from Uniswapri, you can also pay, right? So the tool is free, but there.
00:09:53.792 - 00:09:56.694, Speaker C: Are some paid plans with some extra features.
00:09:56.822 - 00:10:05.626, Speaker B: And the interesting thing about this that people can pay with metamask. So for example, if I click buy now, it creates a transaction in metamask.
00:10:05.658 - 00:10:07.150, Speaker C: And I can pay directly with this.
00:10:07.220 - 00:10:27.686, Speaker B: And so some people wanted to use this for their own project too. And so I created a little store builder, which is called oneeat me. And basically what allows you to do is to essentially create the same thing, but for your own store. So you're going to be able to.
00:10:27.708 - 00:10:31.240, Speaker C: Create, for example, you can see here an example what you can create.
00:10:32.090 - 00:11:12.654, Speaker B: It's an editor, and you'll be able to create your own page, similar to whateverabout me or something like that. But the difference is that you can also create a product or as many products you want, and people can come and they can pay with metamask. So that's more a store builder. Why I built this is because DeFi is very cool. I like the investment aspects, but I would like it to see more connected to commerce and more connected to real applications. And so I think it's going to really become useful. When businesses are built on the blockchain.
00:11:12.702 - 00:11:20.610, Speaker C: They have payments on chain. So you can do all sort of other financial, commercial loans and trade finance.
00:11:20.690 - 00:11:24.646, Speaker B: And all sort of, sort of useful finance application.
00:11:24.748 - 00:11:27.560, Speaker C: Beyond just speculation. That's one.
00:11:29.390 - 00:11:42.042, Speaker B: The other one that I'm just finishing building is more of another coming from personal need is I'm trying to do dollar cost averaging with my ethereum and.
00:11:42.096 - 00:11:44.442, Speaker C: Whatever other things that I'm buying.
00:11:44.586 - 00:11:47.674, Speaker B: But it's very hard, right? So it's very hard to be consistent.
00:11:47.722 - 00:11:49.470, Speaker C: By the same amount all the time.
00:11:49.540 - 00:11:56.886, Speaker B: So I created this. It's called DCA land. And you're going to find, also, if you check out the calculator, you're going.
00:11:56.888 - 00:11:58.900, Speaker C: To find a little banner pointing here.
00:11:59.350 - 00:12:01.362, Speaker B: And basically the idea here is that.
00:12:01.416 - 00:12:05.422, Speaker C: You can automate your buying of ethereum.
00:12:05.486 - 00:12:07.794, Speaker B: So far, but it's going to be.
00:12:07.912 - 00:12:13.090, Speaker C: Working soon with other maybe pair to bitcoin tokens.
00:12:13.170 - 00:12:33.190, Speaker B: And for example, you can say, oh, I want to convert 100 die into ether once per week. It will estimate like this will have some cost, it will have a little fee, but then you're basically going to be able to start this stream of money. And the way it works is the.
00:12:33.200 - 00:12:35.774, Speaker C: Smart contract will take 100 die every.
00:12:35.812 - 00:12:46.146, Speaker B: Week from your wallet, put it on uniswap, take back the ethereum and put it back to your wallet. That's a little convenient thing that I.
00:12:46.168 - 00:12:49.426, Speaker C: Think will maybe help some users to.
00:12:49.448 - 00:12:52.062, Speaker B: Be more methodical and not buying bulk.
00:12:52.126 - 00:12:54.820, Speaker C: Just to see their value maybe going up or down.
00:12:55.690 - 00:13:10.970, Speaker A: So you mentioned that every week it will make a transaction. So I guess that requires some sort of relayer like some external entity that regularly call function in a spot contract.
00:13:11.630 - 00:13:21.374, Speaker B: Yeah, especially for your audience. It's also very technical. I'm sure they're going to get this. So basically the smart contract I built.
00:13:21.412 - 00:13:22.000, Speaker C: Here.
00:13:24.450 - 00:13:32.526, Speaker B: Gets signed by the user. So if I'm doing this, I will need to unlock the die first and then start it. So I'm signing and that I am.
00:13:32.548 - 00:13:38.034, Speaker C: Allowing the smart contract every, if there's a week, it's every whatever amount of.
00:13:38.072 - 00:13:49.318, Speaker B: Seconds to get 100 dies from my wallet and put it on uniswap and send back the ethereum. Now to execute the contract in the.
00:13:49.324 - 00:13:51.474, Speaker C: Future, you need a relayer to call the contract.
00:13:51.602 - 00:14:17.486, Speaker B: And so the other part of the smart contract is allowing relayers to execute the transaction and they will get back the gas that they spent, plus they will get back like a 0.2% fee. So the gas cost, for example, right now the price of gas is like six gigaway. And so basically right now it will.
00:14:17.508 - 00:14:20.414, Speaker C: Come at 0.1% plus 0.2%.
00:14:20.532 - 00:14:35.042, Speaker B: You basically spend 36 cent of die every week to get this thing going. So you have this two component. Right now I'm also providing a very.
00:14:35.096 - 00:14:42.690, Speaker C: Layer, but also hopefully in the future we'll also other, it's completely open to people to participate.
00:14:42.850 - 00:15:33.366, Speaker A: Actually you have three DeFi projects, you really have a lot of ideas, and you being also a user of Defi probably helps. And I wanted to ask you, let's say I'm a developer and I want to start building a lot of Defi project, but personally I always find this problem, which is there is always a part of me who is really interested in technology and another part of me who is also interested in building product. And I think these two things are really at ods with each other. So you, who is a prolific builder, what's your mindset? How do you approach building project? Do you already have the same tech stack that you use for all your project and you don't even try really to learn new Tech and you just reuse the same thing, for example?
00:15:33.548 - 00:15:47.020, Speaker B: Yeah, honestly, maybe also because of my background, I'm pretty basic because I think that at the end of the day, anything you build is useless if it's not used.
00:15:49.150 - 00:15:54.080, Speaker C: It's equally important to create something, but also in a sense, build it fast.
00:15:55.010 - 00:16:04.306, Speaker B: And see fast if people pay attention or they want to use it. If not, it's fine, you've killed it and you move on.
00:16:04.488 - 00:16:11.714, Speaker C: At least that's more of the approach. In terms of tech, the tech that.
00:16:11.752 - 00:16:25.126, Speaker B: I use is always, I mean, is what I know, which is probably a pretty basic stack. And then I try to prioritize maybe, as you said, so maybe a little.
00:16:25.148 - 00:16:28.746, Speaker C: Bit ui, because ultimately a lot of.
00:16:28.768 - 00:16:37.014, Speaker B: The defi users, well, for one, they are very used to experience compound like all these protocols.
00:16:37.062 - 00:16:44.282, Speaker C: They have very nice user interface and also make it, for example, responsive.
00:16:44.346 - 00:16:57.266, Speaker B: Right. A lot of people come from mobile and on the other side, really trying to understand a little financial application. Like for example, dollar cost averaging. Yes, I'm familiar with it, I've been doing it.
00:16:57.288 - 00:17:00.818, Speaker C: A lot of people do it. I think it makes sense. So, yeah, why not?
00:17:00.984 - 00:17:03.298, Speaker B: Or other store.
00:17:03.464 - 00:17:05.286, Speaker C: I experienced that people are paying with.
00:17:05.308 - 00:17:30.380, Speaker B: Ether, maybe other people want to get paid with ether, but it's a lot of experimentation. This point in time, everything is very nascent. But I would like to see more application coming up and also more monetization being made. Because at the end of the day.
00:17:31.010 - 00:17:33.760, Speaker C: I think a healthy system is when.
00:17:34.130 - 00:17:53.950, Speaker B: People get value and people receive this value, they're open to pay and it's all in equilibrium. So I think there is a lot of space to build stuff for your audience, your followers, and also build it in a way that has some monetization.
00:17:54.030 - 00:17:59.686, Speaker C: Obviously it's very early, and so how much of this monetization will be, is.
00:17:59.708 - 00:18:26.158, Speaker B: Probably going to be very little. But I think also at this point in time, it's very important to position yourself right, position, create. And the other important thing is also create an audience. So if you're able to create one product that maybe gets some usership right, and people really care about that, even like small add on or whatever informative product, then from there it can be.
00:18:26.164 - 00:18:32.174, Speaker C: Very nice because you have an initial group of people you can ask, you can brainstorm with it.
00:18:32.212 - 00:18:33.474, Speaker B: By the way, people in this space.
00:18:33.512 - 00:18:35.826, Speaker C: They'Re super early adopters and very open.
00:18:36.008 - 00:18:42.100, Speaker B: And then it's really like a distribution platform for everything you build next.
00:18:42.790 - 00:19:20.350, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. The idea of building one's audience is so important. And then when you launch your next product, you can really leverage your current audience. I'm going to put the link of these different project in the description of the video.
