00:00:10.410 - 00:00:55.502, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum, ad and defy. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. If you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host and on either blogs I teach blockchain development and quick announcement, this week we are going to do a live training on smart contract security. So if you are interested I going to copy paste the link in the chat for your information. Smart Contract Security this is the skill that pay the most in the blockchain industry and for this live training we have found an expert in smart contract security.
00:00:55.502 - 00:01:31.194, Speaker A: So I copy paste the profile of the instructor Suhil in the chat. This is not a developer that just learned security yesterday. This is someone who has been into cybersecurity for more than seven years. So you're going to get a top instruction here. Next, another service announcement. So if you are interested in being an instructor for Ed the blocks, we are hiring instructors. If you want to apply, you can apply here.
00:01:31.194 - 00:02:26.300, Speaker A: So basically the big benefit beside of course making some money is also that you get a lot of credibility when you are an instructor. So if you have, let's say between one to two years of experience in the blockchain industry, you can definitely apply personally. It's how I got my career started in the blockchain industry by teaching other and finally final service announcement. Another thing we are launching also is a Defi incubator. So it's basically we provide technical advisory, strategic advisory as well as financial resources to new DeFi project on EVM compatible blockchain. So Ethereum, Binance, smart chain and all the other EVM compatible blockchain. If you are interested, check out this page, you can send us your application and we will get back to you.
00:02:26.300 - 00:02:54.160, Speaker A: Okay, so hi everybody. In the chat today we have crypto Mikael, we have Paris, we have Dan, Abracadabra, Tshx. Hi guys. So we're going to start with the price of Ether. So it's the second week of recovery after the big market crash two weeks ago. So so far so good. I hope you didn't sell, guys, because we are going to recover, I can tell you that.
00:02:54.160 - 00:03:36.062, Speaker A: And if we look at the price of ether, of the price of gas, it keeps going down recently, which is very good. We haven't seen gas price like this for a long time. So it's very good for user, for the usability of Ethereum. And the big question is, why do we see this now? So one part of it is the effects of something that we call flashboats. It's a new mechanism to do the bidding of gas price outside of the blockchain. And this has been very, very helpful. And another reason is because now we have more and more layer two scaling solutions like polygon, which start to become more and more popular.
00:03:36.062 - 00:04:13.994, Speaker A: So finally you start to see that the transaction fee problem on Ethereum start to be resolved. Then we had an interesting tweet storm about statistic of Ethereum. So Ethereum flipped bitcoin for several metrics. In May 1 we have the minor fee. The minor fee on Ethereum were higher than the minor fee on bitcoin. This hasn't happened since a very long time. So this metrics is very important because basically security depends on the minor fees.
00:04:13.994 - 00:04:52.470, Speaker A: So that means that the security on Ethereum start to be better than on bitcoin. Another metrics that was very important is the options. So basically, the options on Ethereum start to be. The trading of these options start to be 60% of the bitcoin options. That's a growth of more than three times compared to the previous months. Most of these options are traded on an exchange called deribit. And yeah, so that really show you there is more interest in Ethereum very recently.
00:04:52.470 - 00:05:39.458, Speaker A: Then one of the big news of the week is about spacechain. So spacechain is a company that want to do blockchain in space, and they have launched a flight to the International Space Station with an ethereum node. So now Ethereum is in space. So I'm not sure if it's connected to Ethereum mainnet or if it's a private network running the EVM. I think it's the second case. There are some very significant technical challenges if you want to run blockchain in space, because you have a lot of latency in order to communicate with this satellite, you have a lot of latency. And so you can have a lot of problem of forking in the network.
00:05:39.458 - 00:06:31.978, Speaker A: So I don't think we have solved this problem yet. I think we will solve them at some point. But eventually, if we really want to truly achieve the vision of a decentralized blockchain that is completely censorship free, we do have a point of failure, which is governments are able, if they want to shut down part of the Internet and try to filter the traffic, basically to censor blockchain transactions. But in the future, when we will have a lot of Internet service provider who have satellite in space. We already have Elon Musk, who is launching his fleet. But when these start to generalize, it's going to be much harder for nation states to censor this part of the network. So really, I do believe if you want to achieve the true vision of blockchain, we need to have blockchain in space.
00:06:31.978 - 00:07:02.606, Speaker A: And that's what spacechain is doing. By the way, I do think that spacechain is one of the coolest companies in the space. The CTO is Jeff Garzig, who is a bitcoin heavyweight. He's been in the blockchain industry for a long time. So really great guy. Someone who is really knowledgeable. Actually, I think it was sometime last year I was in discussion with them to work for them, but unfortunately I was too busy on either blocks.
00:07:02.606 - 00:07:43.902, Speaker A: But yeah, I think these guys are doing something super interesting and super important. Next, we have some metrics about Ethereum 2.0. So there is more than 5 million ether that has been locked into Ethereum 2.0 deposit contract. So it's less than 5% of the total supply of ether, which is 116,000,000 of ether. But still it's going up. And the more ether you have locked in this contract, the more bullish it is for ether, because this ether cannot be sold for a few years until Ethereum 2.0
00:07:43.902 - 00:08:12.902, Speaker A: migration is finished. So it's a metric to keep an eye on. Then. Some news about nosis. So Nosis, which is one of the first company on Ethereum, was launched in 2016. Originally they were doing a prediction market, but in the meantime they started to do a lot of different things. And so they've announced that they're going to release a next generation Ethereum client.
00:08:12.902 - 00:09:03.702, Speaker A: So it's going to be based on open Ethereum, which was based on this client of parity technology, I forget the name. Basically it was the client written in rust, then I think it became a turbo guess, and now they decided to rewrite it from scratch because the code base is too old. It's 200,000 line of code, so they need to start from scratch. They cannot refactor anymore. And so for this new version of this new Ethereum node, the disk footprint is going to be much lower. So it's going to be 1.2 terabyte for an archive node, which is the most comprehensive kind of node you can have, and 430 gigabyte for a prune node.
00:09:03.702 - 00:10:03.450, Speaker A: So that's a significant improvement compared to what we have now. It's going to be more resilient to crash. It's going to have some API for developer, like one which is called parity trace and a lot of improvements. So even though we have a lot of the attention is focused on Ethereum two, we still have a lot of work going on to improve Ethereum one about layer two scaling solution. So news from ZK sync, which is about to release their alpha version. And so now they do have support for solidity and another programming language which is called Zinc. But I do think that solidity is probably going to be much more popular because it's easier for developers to deploy this smart contract.
00:10:03.450 - 00:10:50.486, Speaker A: Yeah, so curious to see what's going to happen with this layer two scaling solution. We have a lot of news for layer two scaling solution and that's really the key for Ethereum to get back its lead over the other blockchain. And probably in the second half of the year we're going to see a big movement back from other blockchain back to Ethereum, thanks to all this layer two scaling solution that start to be live and operational. Then we're going to talk DfI. So first we're going to start with the market cap of DFI. So we are going back up again with almost 70 billion locked in. DFI for the number of ether locked is still quite stagnant.
00:10:50.486 - 00:11:39.846, Speaker A: So we are still far from the peak of a few months ago, but I do think very fast we're going to be above 100 billion again. That was just a temporary blip on the chart, but we're going to be back in the upward direction, no problem here. Then I'm going to show you a couple of cool graph cool metrics for DFI. So these are some public dashboard that you can find on dune analytics. So there is this chart that I find interesting to show you, the daily Dex volume. So we had a big peak around May 20 and here we are clearly super down. Then this graph is pretty cool is the number of DFI user.
00:11:39.846 - 00:12:10.114, Speaker A: So here the total number of DeFI users. This is super important to monitor. 2.5 million user for DeFI to give you a comparison, I think for metamask we are between five to 10 million active user for each month. And here it's breakdown for different protocols. So here you can see like compound is stalling a little bit, uniswap keeps growing, balancer, et cetera, et cetera. Then another dashboard, pretty interesting, is focused on lending.
00:12:10.114 - 00:12:58.994, Speaker A: So here you can see the relative strength of aave, compound, microdao, et cetera. So this can really give you some color about the importance of different protocols. Then another dashboard about bitcoin on ethereum. So what's interesting is that we almost have more activity for bitcoin on ethereum than for bitcoin itself. So that really show you how ethereum is really a black hole for liquidity, can really absorb any kind of liquidity, including a lot of assets that are not native to ethereum. And the last dashboard I wanted to show you is a dashboard about gas prices. So here, for example, you can see the gas costs for the typical action for the recent gas price.
00:12:58.994 - 00:13:28.762, Speaker A: So you can see that these gas costs are very reasonable compared to a few weeks or even a few months ago. A few months ago sometime it was very usual to pay like 100, $200 for just one action. And here, finally for most of this action, we are below $10. So it's very good. Finally, we are slowly but surely solving this problem of the Ethereum transaction fee. So that's it for this dashboard. So next I'm going to show you the top defi token.
00:13:28.762 - 00:14:18.042, Speaker A: So this week we have more green than red, so which is very good. So first, the token of enzyme, which was formerly the melon token. So they announced that now their token can be traded on Matic. Also a project called Unslash Finance actually worked for them. They deploy 40,000 ether from the spartan bucket to the curve finance using enzyme finance. Also second project with a big increase is worldswap. So they do cross chain polygon transaction and they've done an airdrop for their holders.
00:14:18.042 - 00:14:59.740, Speaker A: They've also done a token buybacks. Actually I believe that token buybacks are more effective compared to token burn when it comes to price support. Then we have unilen finance, uft, also a nice progression, plus 60%. So this is a lending protocol available on polygon. This is flagged as a trending on coingecko. Then we have Tornado catch, which is basically a privacy solution. So there was a couple of coverage, this news about tornado cash.
00:14:59.740 - 00:15:29.378, Speaker A: There was also a governance protocol this week. So like some action for tornado cash. Then what do we have? We have the token of Kyber. So there was a mainland beta launch for a new version of Kyber. They now have a dynamic market maker protocol. So we can see like all the decentralized exchange are getting more and more sophisticated. After this, they had a big increase.
00:15:29.378 - 00:16:09.774, Speaker A: Okay, so next we're going to move on with the specific news of d five project. So first Uniswap. So Uniswap V three will be deployed on arbitrum after a community vote. So arbitrum is another l two scaling solution. Okay, so then we have this why I can't see this reload. Then we have this dashboard for Uniswap V three. So this allow you to calculate the fee you're going to earn as a liquid provider.
00:16:09.774 - 00:16:53.550, Speaker A: So Uniswap Vitri is a little bit more sophisticated. So you can just put your token and just magically earn money. You need to set some parameters. So with this tool you can estimate basically how much fee you would earn with such and such parameters. So if you want to be an LP on uniswap, probably it's going to be a tool that you're going to need to. Then some news from Curve Finance, which is curve Finance, one of the leading decentralized exchange for stablecoin. The big innovation of curve finance compared to other decks is that it has another price equation that allowed to have a less slippage for stablecoin.
00:16:53.550 - 00:17:32.566, Speaker A: And so both yearn finance and Converx finance are using the token of curve finance, which is called CRV. That's the governance token of curve finance. And so yeah, they are fighting for this CRV token. So it's very bullish for this token at the moment. Then there's some news from Matcha. So matcha is a Dex aggregator. So it basically allow you to optimize, to optimize your trade.
00:17:32.566 - 00:18:04.150, Speaker A: You don't have to select a specific Dex, you just say, hey, matcha, I want to execute this trade. Just find me the best price on whatever exchange. So it's a little bit like one inch. And so they've released their biggest update ever, Matcha 2.0. So now big, big update, they're going to enable fiat purchase thanks to a new partnership with Moonpay. So this is super important. We need to build these on ramps directly into DFI so that we don't rely on centralized exchanges like Coinbase, et cetera.
00:18:04.150 - 00:18:49.250, Speaker A: Then they're going to have a unified multi chain product experience with support for Polygon. So that's really huge. And a lot of other updates, so very good for Matcha. Then news from a project called Arcxifier. So this protocol will basically what they do is on chain reputation. They're going to issue a Defi passport for each address and you are going to be able to build your reputation on chain. So this is extremely important because currently for all the lending protocol in Defi, you always have to provide a collateral.
00:18:49.250 - 00:19:24.878, Speaker A: But that's very different from centralized finance where you can borrow money just based on your credit score. If you already need to have some assets to borrow money, it means we only lend to the rich. If you don't already have money, then we can never lend you money. So that's not right. It's really a big limitation of defi. So with this we will see the emergence of a totally new category of lending protocol that don't require to post any collateral. You have to know that this is a very controversial issue.
00:19:24.878 - 00:20:08.346, Speaker A: There are a lot of famous figure in the blockchain industry that are against system of reputation on chain. That for example Vitalik buttering is really against that kind of system. But I believe it's interesting to see how the experiment is going to play out because we need to find a way to have lending protocol that lend without requiring you to already have money. Otherwise we only lend to the rich. I do think this is the key piece of the defi infrastructure. Then some news from one inch, which is another Dex aggregator. So they've added support for flashboard transaction.
00:20:08.346 - 00:20:39.480, Speaker A: So this will allow you to lower your gas fee basically. So it's cool to see more and more defi protocol that support flashboard because this is the key reason why the fees are going down. Okay, so now we're going to talk of NFT. So this is the metrics from DAP radar. So we can see the metrics from the last seven days with the biggest NFT collection. So NBA, topshot, borrow, ap, axie, affinity. So these are collections that we see every week.
00:20:39.480 - 00:21:39.080, Speaker A: Rarible also one of the top exchange for nfts or are the same crypto punk. What do we have in terms of change? So the volume of openc is going up a lot. So plus 65% openc, which is the leader really for NFT trading, Axi infinity has double in volume in one week. Then for the top sale of NFT for specific NFT. So we had a land NFT. So I think that was in a crypto game, in a real estate game, I think then we have this robot for 236k. What do we have? We have this thing, this dream thing.
00:21:39.080 - 00:22:34.410, Speaker A: For how much? This for one hundred and fifty k, I think. Is it me bits? Yeah, it's like a famous collection for 145K. All right then some news about a startup, a data privacy startup that's going to do data privacy with NFT. They raised $2.3 million from investor in Hong Kong. And yes, I really don't know how it's going to work because it's super hard to do privacy on the blockchain and they want to do this with NFT. So yeah, super spookers what's going to happen with this startup? Okay then a new EIP.
00:22:34.410 - 00:23:41.678, Speaker A: So Ethereum improvement proposal for NFT. So basically this is a proposed standard for fractional ownership of NFT with a built in system for royalty distribution. So I guess every time the NFT will be transferred there will probably be a transaction fee that will be redistributed to the holders of the NFT. It actually gives me an id for a tutorial because I think I could do a tutorial like this. So if you're into NFT, check out this eip then still for NFT, we have this new project called NFT storage. So it's a free decentralized storage for NFT that is built on ipfs. So this is accurately in beta and it basically is going to improve the developer experience if you want to create an NFT and you want your NFT to be completely decentralized.
00:23:41.678 - 00:24:36.210, Speaker A: So the most simple thing with NFT is to just put the metadata, which means the image, et cetera. You can put the metadata on a centralized server and just have the name of the NFT on the blockchain with the ownership. But if you want your NFT to be completely decentralized, you can also store the image on ipfs. But ipfs as it is now, as a developer, if you don't know ipfs already, you need to do some work. So with NFT storage, this is going to be an API basically that allow you to use ipfs in a very simple way, especially for NFT. So it's good for. Then there is this article on the defiant that talks about the influence of NFT on a digital artist.
00:24:36.210 - 00:25:35.160, Speaker A: So yeah, really explain how artists from all over the world are joining this NFT revolution and how it really enable a whole new category of jobs. Basically because a lot of these artists maybe before they were doing this as a hobby, but they had maybe some other job to pay the bill, but now they can actually consider doing this full time. Then we're going to talk of enterprise blockchain and regulation. So first some news from Coinbase. So now you can use your Coinbase card with Apple Pay and Google Pay, it's really huge and you can earn up to 4% in crypto rewards on your shopping, 1% cash back in bitcoin, 4% cash back in stellar lumens. So for now it's only for us citizen. So it's kind of strange because usually in crypto us citizen are the last one to get access, but this time they are the first one.
00:25:35.160 - 00:26:32.898, Speaker A: So this is super important because basically coinbase. A lot of banks see Coinbase as just a crypto exchange, but actually little by little is going to turn into a crypto bank. People are just going to leave their crypto on Coinbase and they're going to use the Coinbase card to do some shopping. So they're going to attract more and more assets. So very interesting. Then some updates from Google. So Google banned all advertising about crypto services sometime in 2017 because at that time there was a lot of scam with icos, et cetera, but they updated the terms of services and now we can do some advertising for exchanges and wallets.
00:26:32.898 - 00:27:16.818, Speaker A: So only banks and institution that are registered as money transmitters. But it's good to see them being a little bit more flexible. Then we are going to talk about bitcoin. So the bitcoin price slipped because of some news from China. So Weibo, which is basically Twitter in China, decided to suspend the accounts of crypto influencer. So bitcoin price dropped by over 3% just after that. So China is quite strict with crypto recently then still news about China.
00:27:16.818 - 00:27:54.286, Speaker A: So there is this big crackdown on miners in China. And so miners are exploring the option after they were basically kicked out of China. And it's a big issue in the bitcoin world because there is a large portion of the hash rate of bitcoin that is in China. I think this is something like 30 or 40%. Yeah. Then we are going to another part of the world in South America, in El Salvador. So the president of El Salvador announced that there was a proposal to declare bitcoin illegal tenders.
00:27:54.286 - 00:28:36.894, Speaker A: That means you will be able to pay with bitcoin legally. And there was this tweet, interesting tweet about El Salvador. Great weather, world class surfing, beaches, beachfront, properties for sale. One of the few countries in the world with no property taxed, no capital tax gain for bitcoin, since it will be a legal currency. Immediate permanent residence for crypto entrepreneur. Wow, that's great. Okay, then we have some news from the bitcoin conference in Miami.
00:28:36.894 - 00:29:09.514, Speaker A: So, you know, with all the COVID stuff, all the conferences came to halt for a long time. So this is the first crypto conference since a while. And the CEO of Twitter was on stage. And so he discussed his views on bitcoin and he reiterated his commitment to make bitcoin the native currency for the Internet. So I don't know what it means. Maybe we'll see some integration with bitcoin on Twitter. I don't know.
00:29:09.514 - 00:29:48.440, Speaker A: I don't know what it means exactly, but it's always good to have some big billionaires supportive of bitcoin, except if it's missing some tab here. I forgot to open some tab. Okay, so quickly we'll talk of other blockchains. So on the Binance march and front. So there was a large number of projects that were hacked recently on binance smart chain. So on Twitter, Binance smart chain issued some best practices for new projects. So yeah, they are not really happy about this.
00:29:48.440 - 00:30:24.420, Speaker A: Then some news about Solana. So there is a new NFT marketplace which has been launched on Solana also, Solana is raising 450,000,000 in a bid to take on Ethereum. So we do have a lot of activity on Solana these days. I check out the doc of Solana quickly to see how difficult or how easy it would be for a developer. And it seems it's not that easy because they use rust as their programming language for smart contract. So I need to do more research. But at first look, it doesn't look super easy.
00:30:24.420 - 00:30:58.874, Speaker A: Then another tab I'm missing. But basically you can google the full may report of DAP radar. So this is a report for the DAP market. So the leading blockchain in terms of unique active wallet was binance smart chain. Pancake swap was the leading DAP with 350,000 daily unique active wallets. It's just huge. A few hundred thousand of daily active user.
00:30:58.874 - 00:31:54.550, Speaker A: Wow, it's really huge. 80% of the total value locked generated across all blockchain belong to Ethereum DFI, then a very important stat on the DAP market, Polygon saw a growth of 1100% in total value locked. So guys, I've been telling you since months, like Polygon is going to be the next Binance march. And in terms of market cap and everything, so you got to get started on polygon. And actually the live training of last week on Etherblocks Academy was on Polygon. So check it out if you are interested because more and more you will see a blockchain company that requires skills on polygon. Okay, and the last news, because I'm still missing the tab, unfortunately.
00:31:54.550 - 00:32:30.874, Speaker A: But last news. So alchemy, which is an API for Ethereum developer alchemy launch started to support arbitrum. So arbitrum is an l two scaling solution. Now if you want to develop on arbitram, you can use the API of alchemy. So it's much easier. Okay, so now we're going to do the q and a quickly as a reminder. So this week we will have a live training on smart contract security.
00:32:30.874 - 00:32:53.858, Speaker A: So smart contract security. This is the scale that pay the most in the blockchain industry. So it's a very good idea to specialize in this. You can follow the link if you want to book your. Then, then let me scroll up. Let me scroll up and see all the questions. Okay.
00:32:53.858 - 00:33:11.814, Speaker A: Hi Iodeji. Lending rate is so low. I haven't checked lending rate, graphic design and web solution. I heard the polygon was CFI like binance smart chain and not defi. Is that true? No, I don't think so. Polygon is really decentralized. It's not like binance smart chain.
00:33:11.814 - 00:33:29.422, Speaker A: Abracadabra. Question for julian. Did you saw the swiss army knife of polygon called Polisafu? It has many use case, but my favorite is polygon portfolio tracker launchpad et static yield farming. And they're moving to. Okay, no, no, I don't know fu. Interesting. I'll check it out.
00:33:29.422 - 00:33:56.486, Speaker A: Thanks. Abrahcadabra spinboy space chain empowers a blockchain in Uranus. Yes, exactly. You know what spacechain, what they're doing is really amazing. I think it's one of the coolest company in the blockchain industry. Iod. Why is nobody talking about XDAi? I think XDI they are focused on just yas 20 token transfer.
00:33:56.486 - 00:34:16.782, Speaker A: I'm not sure if they do generalized smart contract transaction. Yes, I think it's one of their big limitation. What else, Simon? Lol. The poly safu is exactly what I was looking for. Okay, well, I got to check that trend. Ketlai. Hi sir.
00:34:16.782 - 00:35:01.286, Speaker A: What's the inflation? What's the limitation of solidity in blockchain market? What do you mean? You mean the limitation of the solidity? You mean the programming language? Well, the limitation actually is not solidity itself. It's more limitation of the blockchain. Because we are limited by gas, we don't want to do something which is too intensive in terms of computational power. So because of this, we cannot put too much stuff in solidity. But it's more a limitation of the blockchain then. And then abracadabra. The polysafu is all you need for defi in polygon.
00:35:01.286 - 00:35:40.158, Speaker A: They have a feature token sniffer which autofind new token at Polygon so you can invest in them. Wow, really? You got to check that out. Graphic design and web solution saying I think most of the big influencers are blackbow XDI on purpose. I've asked that question on all the channel and they all blow it up or ignore it. No, I mean, there is no conspiracy. It's just that there is so much going on, and personally, I haven't seen a lot of big news on XDai, but yeah, XDai or no XDI, I don't care if it's tomorrow. There is more things happening on XDAi.
00:35:40.158 - 00:36:06.258, Speaker A: I'm going to talk about it, but I'm not for or against any solution. Then what do we have? We have Dixon, El Salvador, opening up to crypto. Looks like Paragra is following them in the same steps. Yeah, it's really cool to see that there is no consensus across all countries. But crypto. You have crypto who are for crypto. You have country which are for crypto, some that are others.
00:36:06.258 - 00:36:53.630, Speaker A: Because sometimes people are afraid that all the countries are going to get together and ban bitcoin, ban ethereum, et cetera. But no, I think it's extremely difficult to achieve consensus among countries, even though sometimes you might have the illusion that we have consensus. For example, we just had this 15% global corporate tax that has been signed by different countries. But it's just like a big announcement. But after this announcement, it doesn't mean that the actual law will be voted and maybe countries will find a way to fight it and to compete against each other in direct ways. So, yeah, countries do not have aligned interest. And because of this, that means it's impossible to ban crypto at a global.
00:36:53.630 - 00:37:30.810, Speaker A: Then what do we have? Dixon Faddle say, I don't like the idea of a Defi passport. Just use macurean assets as collateral. Yeah, it's going to be a very controversial idea. I really don't know how they're going to make it work. Ioyb bits, what do you think about Casper labs? I don't know about them. Dixon. They should make a system that verify ownership and use of NFT.
00:37:30.810 - 00:37:52.290, Speaker A: Yes. Bezag. Hello, bro. Hey, man. Gary, did you see the bitcoin conference? What are your thoughts? No, I did not have time to watch the replay. Dixon let creators rent them and list them by verifying ownership and permissions. I guess you're talking of NFT.
00:37:52.290 - 00:38:18.394, Speaker A: Bassett, can you explain uniswap V three? New version so you can watch? I think that was probably a few weeks ago. I talk in more detail about uniswap v three in a live stream. That was on the Monday Renjit saying press like, thanks, man. Mjs. Wow, that coinbase foresight. Time to invest on Coinbase stock. Yeah, I do think Coinbase probably in the next ten years is going to ten x.
00:38:18.394 - 00:38:34.874, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure about that. Batman. Hello everyone. Hey man, smash that like button everybody. Yeah. Thanks Batman, for all the support you provide to everybody. So Batman provides support in a private discord chat of the blocks.
00:38:34.874 - 00:38:53.814, Speaker A: And it's doing a monumental work. It's absolutely insane all the questions that are answered by Batman, man. I think everybody really appreciate you. Thank you very much. Mgs, what's your insight in atom? Looks promising. Let me see, let me see. I lost track.
00:38:53.814 - 00:39:00.600, Speaker A: 1 second. 1 second. I lost track in the chat. Too many message. No, I'm kidding. I like many message. It's very good.
00:39:00.600 - 00:39:17.866, Speaker A: Atom. No, I haven't looked at atom. Renjit, if anyone know next 100 x coin, please tell me now. Thank you. Well, I don't know if it's 100 x but I do think polygon is a really good bet. Simon. Hey, Abracadabra.
00:39:17.866 - 00:39:36.686, Speaker A: Can I buy the police? Okay, I don't know anything about then self nifi saying oh no, not dorsey. Thought police. Tumorsito salute. Julian. Hey man. Abracadabra. Quick swap.
00:39:36.686 - 00:39:51.980, Speaker A: Oh, this is a dex on polygon. Abracadabra. I'm done with binance marching. Only iddoblox is still there. Got wrecked so much at binance marching. So many rug pool and hacks and flash fails already. Sorry for you.
00:39:51.980 - 00:40:08.762, Speaker A: IO yb bits. What do you think about apeswap? Underrated. I just know vaguely I think this is a dex on polygon. But no, I didn't check it. Self nifi waiting on ing. I don't know about this project. Dixon.
00:40:08.762 - 00:40:33.670, Speaker A: Where do I buy matic? On any decks. Like uniswap. Any decks? Really? Ibrahim. Hi guys. Hey man. Iodigi. Julian, can I have all the links discussed today in the description? What do you mean? Which link? Iodji? Abracadabra.
00:40:33.670 - 00:40:54.270, Speaker A: Abracadabra. Binance for example. Problem is hard to withdraw. You need to buy Ethereum and withdraw your matic with Eth to your wallet. Okay, I'm not following. My brain is blowing off now. I'm not following too much logic in a single sentence.
00:40:54.270 - 00:41:11.010, Speaker A: ThX is the live training on a. It's a private class on blocks. Dixon. Fado. Abracadabra on Binance. Smart chain. Can I use pancake swap? Because I'm limited to using binance.
00:41:11.010 - 00:41:30.682, Speaker A: Okay, well, if you can only use binance, it means you cannot buy all the defi coin. But the main defi coin. You will find them on Binance. Then Oscanto. Let me see. Oscanto. 1 second.
00:41:30.682 - 00:41:48.174, Speaker A: I lost track in the chat I lost track. I lost track. Oh my God. Where I am. Where I am. Okay, will arbitrum will be on another chain like polygon. I keep reading about l two vs side chain, but I can't get it.
00:41:48.174 - 00:42:06.318, Speaker A: Mercy. So polygon will be a layer two scaling solution? Yeah, like polygon. Yeah, it'd be like a polygon alternative. Basically. Turk, what's your opinion on flashboard and have you check out mixed x mixed transaction? No, I don't know. Mixed transaction. Yeah, flashboard.
00:42:06.318 - 00:42:42.126, Speaker A: They are great because they allow to lower the transaction fees on Ethereum a lot. You pass. Do you also give courses on the weekend? So the live training in general they are in the week time, but actually most of the course on the Edobox academy they are pre recorded videos, so they are self paced. Course, you can take them at any time. And even the live training you have the recording after the live training. Iuyb Casper Labs is an ETH killer. I don't think so.
00:42:42.126 - 00:43:11.450, Speaker A: Fabricio talk about Solana. Yeah, maybe later in the next few weeks maybe I might talk about Solana. GSJ what's up, Julian? Am I correct to assume that Viper is similar to Python and solidity to JS? Yes. Which language would you suggest to begin with? Solidity. It's like 99.99% of the job market and of the smart contract, they are written with solidity. So yeah, you can forget about Viper for now.
00:43:11.450 - 00:43:39.170, Speaker A: Even if you are more familiar with Python and you like the syntax, just use solidity. Then what do we have? Gary Pushviews. Have you used the Alonzo testnet on Cardano and your thought? No, not yet. But Cardano. I don't have too much interest for Cardano to be honest. Raja week. Amen.
00:43:39.170 - 00:44:19.150, Speaker A: No spamming, please. No spamming. Okay. No, let me scroll down. Abrah Kadabra okay, first basic, can you help us on our dex project? So me personally, I don't do freelance, but I'm setting up a development team. So if you are interested in freelance project, basically I'm going to put an email in the Chat. Raphael@idoblock.com

Tren, is this right safe smart contract part of your jump started package class? No, this live training, it's a separate thing. So you have to register separately.
00:44:53.050 - 00:45:14.160, Speaker A: This is not for beginner. Okay, if you're a total beginner in solidity, do not take this training. It's only after you know how to write smart contract in me. Let me put copy past the link in the chat. Abrah Kadabua thanks for stream, Julian. Ciao. Thanks man.
00:45:14.160 - 00:45:30.360, Speaker A: Perkboy I'm unable to buy directly on binance in India. None of the card work. Please suggest. Okay, so guys don't ask that kind of question. We're not really the support of Coinbase or binance. So just ask them directly. They know better than us.
00:45:30.360 - 00:46:01.962, Speaker A: Raga Vendra I am a c sharp dev good. Yeah, it's always good when you have a tech background you want to get in blockchain.
