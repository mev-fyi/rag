00:00:04.800 - 00:00:52.384, Speaker A: You and we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and DFI. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. And in this video we are going to cover Ethereum new all time high, how a developer made $1 million with just one freelance project, a new version of the balancer protocol hash mask, which is the new NFT trend and many, many other stuff. If you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host, and on my channel in the blocks I explain blockchain development. And before we continue, quick mention to my upcoming training how to get a 100k blockchain job in 2021.
00:00:52.384 - 00:01:23.048, Speaker A: Right now the industry is in a big shortage of talent. This is the bull market, so it's really the time to getting I will do a free training on this month, February 23 at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. This will not be on YouTube so if you are interested make sure to register. So let me post the link in the chat. I will also post it in the description on the video. It's free to register.
00:01:23.048 - 00:01:40.560, Speaker A: If you want to receive the link, you have to register. It will not be on YouTube. Okay, so hi, two people in the chat. Hi siyatanda. Hi. Cut yourself. And we're going to start with some inspiration.
00:01:40.560 - 00:02:23.304, Speaker A: It's Monday so we're going to start with good news. So there's this guy who bought some ether a couple of years ago and he sold some to finally fund his dream of starting his own game, Dev Studios. It was his longtime dream. And so yeah, I mean it's really sd bull market. Some people are achieving their dream and these are the guy, he basically just paid off his mortgage of 20 years thanks to Ethereum and also bought a nice car. So yeah, I mean bull market, when you make some money sometime you have to take your profit. It's good to huddle.
00:02:23.304 - 00:03:00.564, Speaker A: Also, sometime you have to enjoy yourself a little bit. So we're going to continue with the price of ether, which is doing super well. So this week we had a new all time high at 1749. So this is really amazing. The bullish train really continue. And not long ago we were talking of Ethereum at $2,000 and it seems a little bit far away, but I think it's going to come really fast. Another important metrics is trading volume.
00:03:00.564 - 00:03:31.270, Speaker A: So here, let me change the max timescale. And so you can see the trading volume is really high and it's really important because if you have a bull market, but the trading volume doesn't really follow. It's not really meaningful. But here the trading volume is as big as ever. Someday it's 50 billion, which is equivalent to bitcoin. So that really tells you that this bull market is really strong. So next, it's meme time.
00:03:31.270 - 00:04:04.300, Speaker A: If you aren't happy single, then you won't be happy in a relationship. True happiness comes from Ethereum breaking two k, not from anyone else. Very important, guys, very important piece of wisdom for this Monday. All right, so we just passed 1 billion transaction on Ethereum. New milestone. New milestone. Another important metrics.
00:04:04.300 - 00:04:51.336, Speaker A: So with stablecoin, Ethereum settled more than $1.6 trillion in 2020, which is to be compared with 11 trillion by the visa network in 2018. That means maybe in 2021 the stable coins transaction will be above visa. It's totally possible we will see this flipening this year. So of course, this week, the big news for Ethereum is the launch of Ethereum futures on CME, which is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which is one of the biggest market for derivatives. So futures, et cetera, on the stock market, on commodities. And so now we also have future for Ethereum.
00:04:51.336 - 00:05:59.140, Speaker A: So what does it mean for the price of ether? So it's actually good for attracting more institutional investors to Ethereum because they don't want to buy ether and manage the private key themselves. For them, using future is easier to get an exposure. So potentially we're going to have big inflow of institutional thanks to this future. So there are some people in the crypto community who are afraid of this future because in December 2017, when the bitcoin futures were launched, some research was done actually to show that it was directly responsible for the bear market of bitcoin that happened just after. So you know what, I'm not afraid of that for ether because really, do hedge fund want to repeat what happened with GameStop? Seriously, I hope they're not crazy enough to do it because this time mommy and daddy won't be able to save them. It's all decentralized. So if traders want to keep buying ether to fight the short, there is nothing that can stop it.
00:05:59.140 - 00:06:30.236, Speaker A: We are in a really big bull market, so I'm really not afraid of the short selling of the short position from futures. All right, so then let's have a quick look at the gas price. So is heating up again. We haven't seen this since the Defi summer last year. So guys, this is official. Defi season is back. Look at this nice parabolic move in the gas price.
00:06:30.236 - 00:07:14.732, Speaker A: It means Defi season is back, so it's bad for a transaction fee, but it also means that everybody is super keen on ether right now. Okay, so next let's have a quick look at what's happening with Ethereum 2.0. So currently we have almost $5 billion locked in Ethereum 2.0. And about the yield, we are at about 9.1%. So still giving a very decent yield. And talking of staking, so there was this report from stake. So this is the service to stake your ether for Ethereum 2.0.
00:07:14.732 - 00:07:53.876, Speaker A: And so they reported a slashing incident. It means that basically some of the ether they lost, some of the ether they staked. And why this happens because they were running the same validator on two different machines, so they sent twice the same signature and they were slashed. So if you are a staker, you should never run the same validator on two different computer. You will have a problem. And if you want to make sure that you can stake safely, there is actually a software that I found on GitHub that you can run to do some monitoring for Ethereum 2.0 validator.
00:07:53.876 - 00:08:40.932, Speaker A: So as soon as there is a problem with your staking node, then you can receive some email, so that can give you some security, you can get some feedback pretty quickly. Okay, so next we're going to talk of the market in Defi. So we have reached a new all time High, 34.5 billion. That's really huge. And what I really like about this is it's not just due to the price of ether, which is going up, but we can see a nice flow back into Defi. So first there was this outflow last year, and finally people are putting their money back into Defi on ether.
00:08:40.932 - 00:09:03.280, Speaker A: So it's really nice in terms of the ranking. So ave is still number two compound, and Uniswap really went down in the ranking, not even below curveswap. Sushi swap. I never can say it. Sushi swap. Sushi swap. It's like a tongue twister.
00:09:03.280 - 00:09:34.164, Speaker A: So sushi swap is closing the gap with uniswap. I hope it doesn't go above Uniswap. I don't think it deserves it, really. Okay, so next let's see the winner and the loser for the top defi coin. So what do we have here? 200% xvs. Never heard of that project. Yuma 169 Acropolis 141% bondly.
00:09:34.164 - 00:10:04.850, Speaker A: This is a project on Polka dot 1330 x wa back from the dead. 125 back from the dead. This was one of the first decks, but basically never really took off Uniswap instead, got way more popular. So zero x, back from the dead. Badger, I think this is a yield optimizer. 83%. What do we have? Maker doing really well.
00:10:04.850 - 00:10:21.136, Speaker A: Doing well. Cake swap. So Dex on finance. Marching. All right, we also have Polkadot here. Doing well. And what about the loser? Actually, not a lot of loser.
00:10:21.136 - 00:10:54.012, Speaker A: You see, it's really difficult to find some loser this week. It's like almost all green. Yeah, like Hegeek. The option protocol dodo, which is a new automated market maker keeper. Yeah, but overall this week, if you were invested in DFI token, you're almost sure of winning. Okay, so here's some stats for the DFI market cap. So the top 100 DFI protocols have a market cap of 55 billion.
00:10:54.012 - 00:11:11.876, Speaker A: So you can compare with some big company. Goldman, 100 billion square 100 billions. Paypal 300. JpMorgan 420. So yeah, it really looks like we're catching up. Before, DefI was like really ridiculous compared to these big companies. But we are catching up.
00:11:11.876 - 00:11:32.136, Speaker A: We are catching up. And I'm pretty sure at the end of the year, this will be totally reverted. The top 100 D five protocol. I'm pretty sure that will be bigger than JPMorgan. Pretty sure. All right, let's see the rates quickly. Any good rates for people like me who don't want to take risk? Please, for all the chicken.
00:11:32.136 - 00:11:50.388, Speaker A: So tedder, 11% on compound. USDC, 10% compound. Yes. Pretty nice. Yes. Actually, this week you have the best yield on compound. Okay, so next, let's talk of the news for specific D five project.
00:11:50.388 - 00:12:39.872, Speaker A: And we're going to talk of balancer, which just announced its V two. This will be released in a few months. So the main architectural, architectural change between v one and v two is the transition to a single vault. Let me pull up the nice chart here. So everything will be in a single pool, will be in a single vault. So what are the advantage of this new design? So, first of all, it will be more gas efficient and the trading cost will be on par with Uniswap. So that was one of the complaints about balancer, is that because it's a more complex protocol, it's always more expensive to interact with it compared to Uniswap, which is already quite expensive.
00:12:39.872 - 00:13:24.028, Speaker A: So now they will fix this problem. Also, with this new design, it will be more simple because all interaction will be done through one single access point, which is the vault. So you only need to do one token approval in order to trade or invest liquidity. So it's going to be a lot of saving of a gas saving. It's also more capital efficient because pools will have full control over the underlying token. So, for example, you can do things like investing the liquidity in some deFi protocol like compound to boost the yield for liquidity providers. So it's going to make balancer pool more powerful.
00:13:24.028 - 00:13:44.024, Speaker A: So in general, I'm pretty bullish on balancer. They really have a lot of ambition. They want to be the first Dex this year. They are really very ambitious. So far, they've been the underdog among all the dexes, but I think there is really a lot of potential upside. It's basically like uniswap on steroids. Yeah.
00:13:44.024 - 00:14:17.780, Speaker A: So I think it could be the back end for other dexes, actually. So, yeah, pretty bullish on balancer then. Quick news about Uniswap. So even though the gas fees are super high, actually uniswap is still on track for a new all time high for the weekly active users. So this is amazing that even though we have all these crazy fees, we have still a big influx of new users. So potentially that means a lot of these new users are wells. We have more and more wells using Uniswap.
00:14:17.780 - 00:14:51.032, Speaker A: Then synthetics news. So synthetics introduced a new feature to short some crypto. So they already introduced this feature late last year, in 2020, but it was just at the contract level. And now they added this capability in the UI. So it works like for shorting a stock. So you borrow a crypto, you sell it, and you buy it back later, and you reimburse it to synthetic. So this is all secured by a collateral mechanism.
00:14:51.032 - 00:15:22.564, Speaker A: So there is no way for you to just run away with the money and not reimburse the crypto. It's not possible. It's not possible. All right then, primitive finance. So this is an option protocol, and they just launched the longest dated option in DFI. So you can buy or sell scores and put expiring in September 2021. So why would you use this? Well, it's ideal for liquidity provider.
00:15:22.564 - 00:16:01.030, Speaker A: If you provide liquidity to a pool, you take a risk on the underlying token. So for example, you can buy a protection with a pool a put, but which is really in a long time. Also, if you're going to do a long term bet without using a lot of capital, you want to bet on big price increase of ether, but you want to minimize the capital that you use. Then you can buy a long option with a very long expiry date. That's also useful. Okay, so next news about Everest. So Everest, I did some research.
00:16:01.030 - 00:16:58.216, Speaker A: To be honest, it's a little bit difficult to describe what they do. It's this sort of big defi project that they do many, many things, but it seems like one of their focus is providing some tools for institutional or big company, some tools for crypto. So they launch an on chain KYC solution. So the idea is that you do a KYC with them one time and you get an ENS domain name. And then other defi project they can check with mean any other kind of defi project they can check with them that you have do your kyc already by using zero knowledge proof. So with zero knowledge proof you can prove that you've done the KYC, but without revealing the data of your KYC, doesn't leak your private data. So I really love the concept because it means you keep control over your private data.
00:16:58.216 - 00:17:36.324, Speaker A: It's not going to leak to any other company. And also you don't have to do the same KYC thousands of times. So I really, really like the idea. Then some news about Nexus Mutual, which is an insurance for DeFi project. You can buy an insurance against any hack, any bug in smart contract. And so they have reached a new all time high in terms of active cover. So it's more than $700 million now, which are insured, which is a ten time gross since the start of 2021.
00:17:36.324 - 00:18:09.196, Speaker A: Just the start of 2021. So that means just in one month they have ten x they cover. So that's really exponential growth. So the COVID on many DeFi projects are maxat, which means it's not possible to buy protection because there is no enough liquidity. So you cannot buy protection on balancer, compound, curve maker, do unisop, et cetera. That means there is really a lot of demand. So currently I didn't know that, but 2.3%
00:18:09.196 - 00:18:48.612, Speaker A: of the total value locked in DFI is insured by Nexus mutual or other project. But still it's something. So I believe by the end of the year we'll probably be at something like 1520 or 30%. It's going to be a two digit percentage, which is insured. So yeah, I really foresee really a bright future for Nexus mutual. All right, next we are going to talk of NFT. So in January, the NFT market has seen tremendous growth.
00:18:48.612 - 00:19:19.320, Speaker A: So according to DaP radar, it grew from 3 million to more than $33 million in January. So really big, big growth in NFT. And we're going to talk of hashmas, which is the new crazy NFT project, which is trending like crazy so it's a collection of more than 60,000 artwork from 70 artists. So each hash mask is designed to be a unique avatar. So let me see. I think I do have some. Yeah, so these are hash masks.
00:19:19.320 - 00:20:08.320, Speaker A: So this is a unique avatar made up of individual components created by a group of anonymous artists. So there are different components, mask, character, eye color, skin, et cetera. And in just four days, this project raised over 10 million through a mask sale. So they basically sold the entire supply, everything they've done, they sold everything, $10 million. So beside the value of the artwork, each hash mask NFt accumulates ten name change token. So nct per day. And when you accumulate enough of this NFT, about 2000, you can change the name of your NFT.
00:20:08.320 - 00:20:43.472, Speaker A: So that means it's a sort of gamify NFT system where you accumulate this Nct token. That's how it works. And so right now, after the token, the initial sell, they are also very strong in secondary market. With $12 million traded already. It's more than all the other NFT projects. So yeah, that's a new trendy thing in NFT. Okay, so next, another NFT news.
00:20:43.472 - 00:21:26.428, Speaker A: So Logan Paul, the controversial youtuber, released his own NFT. So it's a mix of he uses Pokemon card in his NFT and yeah, so already a lot of people bought into it. And so we're going to see more and more celebrity who launched their NFT this year, that is for sure. Okay, so next, there was a shocking news this week, big shocking news. Yarn finance, which is really one of the darling of D five, the yarn finance was hacked. So it's the wide eye pool that got hacked. So the attacker robbed this pool of 11 million.
00:21:26.428 - 00:22:12.010, Speaker A: But actually because there was some exorbitant fee he had to pay, he only, quote unquote, only made 2.7 million. And the rest was paid in fees paid to ave and curve for liquidity fees and staking fees. So it's kind of controversial because actually, even though this is a hack, the liquidity provider in ave and curve are actually pretty happy because they made a lot of money. So yeah, it's kind of weird hack where it actually transfer value from one defi project to another. So this hacked worked with a series of flash loan from DYDx and Ave. And so the attacker used the funds as collateral to take a loan on.
00:22:12.010 - 00:22:49.216, Speaker A: So by doing this, it basically manipulated an exchange rate that was used on yearn. And so that's how it was able to hack the system. So yes, basically we call this kind of hacker depgging. So you manipulate an exchange rate. And so the attack would have been much worse. The security team fixed the bug in eleven minutes just by tweaking some parameters. There is in particular a parameter which limit the slippage that a single deposit can cause in the pool.
00:22:49.216 - 00:23:17.970, Speaker A: So that was at 1%, but apparently it was too loose, so they made it a little bit smaller and thanks to this, they saved 24 million. So it could have been much, much worse. And the price of the Wifi token actually didn't tank so much just of 11%. And following this, tether froze 1.7 million in profit from this hack. So actually the hacker only made. Only made 1 million.
00:23:17.970 - 00:23:41.028, Speaker A: Yes. So centralized power comes at the risk of decentralized finance. I don't like this headline. I don't like this headline. Yeah, sometimes centralized power is good, but I still don't like tether. Okay. And if you want to know exactly what happened, actually there's a full report on the repo of yern finance.
00:23:41.028 - 00:24:08.624, Speaker A: They explain in detail what happened. Okay, so next we're going to talk of investment. So opin, which is one of the leader in derivatives, DFI. So they offer options to bet and either to bet or to protect yourself. So they raised $6.7 million in a funding run this week. They already raised $2 million in a seed run last year.
00:24:08.624 - 00:24:45.820, Speaker A: So it's always very positive to see the same project raising money several times because it means it's basically like a validation of the work they did before. And so they want to spend this money on additional security, which include audits. Audits are always very expensive and bug bounties. And they will also focus on hiring for research and engineering roles. So if you're blockchain dev, you're looking for a job, send you cv. And they will also develop an automated market maker for options. So to my knowledge, this doesn't exist yet.
00:24:45.820 - 00:25:36.008, Speaker A: It's significantly more difficult to do this for options because compared to just tokens, because options are very customized financial product. But if you want to do an exchange, you need to standardize your financial product, otherwise it's very difficult to match buyers and sellers. So I'm really, really curious how they're going to manage to do this. Amm then news about Goldfinch Goldfinch is a new DeFi lending protocol focusing on loans without collateral. They just raised $1 million funding. And so what they do is lending to businesses in emerging markets. So these businesses, basically they borrow in stable coins from goldfinch token pool and then they exchange that for fiat.
00:25:36.008 - 00:26:29.630, Speaker A: So on the investor side, so if you provide liquidity to gold, finch, you can earn a very nice stable yield, very important, not variable stable yield, between ten to 14%. But of course, it's more risky than on protocols, like a compound where everything is collateralized, because in this case, there is no collateral. So everything depends on the credit worthiness of the borrower. All right, I think I highlight two interesting quotes from this article. DFI lending market grows to surpass 5 billion from less than 200 million a year ago. Yeah. So, wow, that really show you the growth of the market.
00:26:29.630 - 00:27:13.416, Speaker A: But, okay, it continues to say, but it still underestimate the true potential of DFI because all of this lending is over collateralized. So actually, the not collateralized market is much, much bigger. So another quote, these loans are only. So they are talking of the overcollateralized loan. Like, on compound, these loans are only useful for some borrowers, primarily margin traders and crypto holders who don't want to sell their positions. So what we are doing, this is the crucial step that finally open crypto lending to the majority of the world. All right, then we're going to talk of enterprise blockchain with IBM.
00:27:13.416 - 00:27:54.020, Speaker A: That is basically shutting down. Then they're almost shutting down the blockchain division. So they were focused on Hyperledger fabric a few years ago, but in the meantime, we had Hyperledger Bezu that came out. This is basically a blockchain software that is based on Ethereum and designed for enterprise needs. And so, yeah, when you have Bezu, really, you have no need for Hyperledger fabric because for Bezu, you can reuse all the tools of, you know, you don't want to have too many different technology at this point. Ethereum is really the standard for blockchain. So, yeah, there is really no need for fabric.
00:27:54.020 - 00:28:38.452, Speaker A: So, yeah, the lesson for IBM is to not bet against Ethereum. It was a really bad idea. And so there was a study of the Ethereum Enterprise alliance. So it's basically a sort of association that try to promote the use of Ethereum for enterprise. And so one of the question is, what language, blah, blah, blah, blah, do you use when developing application connected to Ethereum? Yes, solidity, et cetera. Here you can see that a lot of enterprise user, they basically use the tools of Ethereum solidity here, like most people use solidity in enterprise blockchain. This is the standout.
00:28:38.452 - 00:29:17.200, Speaker A: Okay, so next we are going to talk of PayPal that has a new crypto plan. So they want to launch a new business unit dedicated to crypto services. So later this quarter, users will be able to fund their accounts with crypto. So they already moved into crypto earlier. So now if you have a balance on PayPal, you can buy some bitcoin and some Ethereum. I think currently it's just in the US, but they're going to extend this to other regions. But in the future, you can also fund your balance with crypto.
00:29:17.200 - 00:29:57.324, Speaker A: So I highlighted this quote from the articles. Some executive at PayPal, we all know the current financial system is anti created and can envision a future where transactions are completed in seconds, not days. Okay, so when I read that, it's just ridiculous. We all know the current financial system is anti created. Are you talking of yourself? Paypal? Because really a lot of people, they have all these fantasies about fintech, but some fintechs, actually, they are even worse than bank because they are not regulated. At least a bank. Maybe it's old school, but it's regulated.
00:29:57.324 - 00:30:26.708, Speaker A: So if you have a problem, you can go see them. But PayPal, you have problem, there is no regulation. You're totally screwed. So, yeah, I'm not sure it really makes sense for Paypal to call the financial system anti credit because they're very much part of it. And probably the worst part. Probably the worst. Okay, so next beat Phoenix just announced that they have repaired the 500 million dollar loan to tether.
00:30:26.708 - 00:30:57.556, Speaker A: So if you never follow this, basically Tether and Bitfinex are related. And there was a lot of drama around this. And there was this story of loan where Bitfinex took a loan from tether. So tether wasn't collateralized 100%. And so there were a lot of people who were adapting, were in debt for tether that were not sure that tether was really strong. So finally, Bitfinex is closing this drama. It's good.
00:30:57.556 - 00:31:37.980, Speaker A: Tether is very important in Defi. It's basically the biggest stable coin with $25 billion in circulation. So it's very important that tether is rock solid. We don't want to have any problem with Tether. And if we have a prime with Tether, we just don't have just a prem with Tether, but we have prem with a lot of other protocol because, for example, Dai uses tether as collateral and tether is used in many, many DeFi projects. So even though this is centralized and centralization is bad, we still want tether to be rock solid. Okay, so next we're going to talk of all the blockchain.
00:31:37.980 - 00:32:18.776, Speaker A: So bitcoin Tesla just announced that they're going to invest $1.5 billion in bitcoin and also announced they plan to accept crypto payment. So as soon as they released this, BTC just pumped right away, plus 10% and just reached a new all time high. I think right now we're at 43k or something, so it's pretty sure this year we're going to reach one hundred k. And so recently, Elon Musk has been very supportive of crypto with his tweet last week. So he updated his Twitter profile, he had the word bitcoin, and already he pumped bitcoin pretty hard. So, yes, thank you, Elon.
00:32:18.776 - 00:32:52.296, Speaker A: Please do the same for Ethereum. We will be very grateful. Next news about binance smart chain. They recorded a recall transaction volume in January with $15 billion. So I was actually pretty shocked because it's actually that closing in. I had no idea they were this close to Ethereum. So this is the binance march, and it's the green line here, and ethereum is the blue line.
00:32:52.296 - 00:33:34.500, Speaker A: But I'm like, what the hell? It looks like in a couple of months, they're going to catch up with Ethereum in terms of transaction volume. But yeah, I was really shocked. But the activity is much more concentrated. It's just a few daps that make up all the volume contrary to Ethereum, which is a little bit more distributed. So here, this is the top defi dap by volume. And so actually, I was super surprised. I didn't know DyDX is actually the first one, compound, second and third one, Venus.
00:33:34.500 - 00:34:09.580, Speaker A: So Venus, it's kind of a mix between compound and Mechodao and. Yeah. So Venus project on binance smart chain, among the most active defi dap and pancake swept, which is basically a Dex on binance smart chain, also very high here in the ranking. Yeah. So binance smart chain is doing really well. Really good. Then we're going to talk of news for some news for developers.
00:34:09.580 - 00:34:51.100, Speaker A: So there was this developer who made $1 million because he solved a bug that was part of a bug bounty program provided by Amorphi. Amorphi is an insurance. And so they had this giant bug bounty program paying $1 million. And so the CTO of another blockchain project found a critical bug and, yeah, so he earned $1 million. So it's pretty insane. It has to be the most well paid gig ever in history. Just $1 million for I think was probably at most, it was probably a few weeks of work, but yeah, just completely insane.
00:34:51.100 - 00:35:25.924, Speaker A: Then I wanted to show you this new project of Sushiswap. Mizo. So this is basically a toolkit for launching a pool on Sushiswap. So it's a set of smart contracts so you can check out their repo. And so they basically give you some sort of boilerplate code that you can use to launch your pool on Sushiswap. So it's very useful. And then some inspiration for developer.
00:35:25.924 - 00:35:52.832, Speaker A: So, Paul Graham, who is one of the most famous investors in the Silicon Valley. So talk to a guy who had several generally good startup ideas, not hard work. Why? Because he was neither a programmer nor had a co founder who was. So he had to hire them. And that put him at the mercy of partners who had nothing to recommend them except access to money. So, guys, it's very important. If you want to launch your blockchain project, you need to learn how to code.
00:35:52.832 - 00:36:19.960, Speaker A: Okay? If you think you're going to be the guy who just managed the relationship and you're going to hire a coder and it's going to be awesome. No, it doesn't work that way. You need to be a developer. That's not me who say it. That's Paul Graham, who is really one of the best investors of our. Then. Then we're going to move on to the Q and A.
00:36:19.960 - 00:36:59.924, Speaker A: So, yeah, very quickly, let me copy past the link to the free training. So just as a reminder, on February 23, so this month at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight, I will do a free training on how to get a 100K blockchain job in 2021. So if you've been on the fence, like, okay, maybe you're following my channel, but you're not sure if really being a blockchain dev is for you really attend this training, because I will tell you exactly what you need to do to find your first blockchain job. It's totally accessible. Even. So, if you are already a developer, that's good.
00:36:59.924 - 00:37:27.090, Speaker A: But even if you are not a developer already, it's also possible. So make sure to register because I will not do this training on YouTube. Okay. It will be outside of YouTube. So if you want to receive the link, register. And yes, let me see what we have in the. So cut your source saying a little bit of open tabs? Yeah, I just have a few.
00:37:27.090 - 00:37:42.208, Speaker A: Okay. Joey. Hey, should I learn plotus or solidity? Solidity. I think plotus is. What is this language? Is it on tezos? Tezos, I believe. Yeah. Thx.
00:37:42.208 - 00:38:02.140, Speaker A: Hey, Julian. Did anybody else know it was the Mardi Gras? Season. I didn't get it. I didn't get it. I guess I missed some news, man. Tell me what about Madigra Bax saying go to three k. Yes, go to three k.
00:38:02.140 - 00:38:21.248, Speaker A: Jim Miller gas fees institution use features to hedge. Yes, but also to get exposure. Alexander. Hey, Julian, thanks for hosting the best defi news. Thank you, Alexander. VB streets binance marching versus ethereum gas fee yeah, binance marching. Obviously this is much lower.
00:38:21.248 - 00:38:35.856, Speaker A: That's why they're getting so much traction now. Alton. Hello, man. Megal Montana. Good morning from New York City. Good morning, Alton. Greetings from the Philippines.
00:38:35.856 - 00:38:54.376, Speaker A: Hi. The Philippines, it's same time zone as Taiwan, so it's very late for you. Gary Sente. Yo, Julian, what's up? How are you feeling about 1.5 billion Tesla backs pump? You know what, actually, guys, I will shock you. I will really shock you. But I almost have no bitcoin.
00:38:54.376 - 00:39:29.272, Speaker A: I think I have maybe like $200 of bitcoin. And the reason is because I think Ethereum is just so exciting. I don't feel like using my capital for bitcoin. Yeah, I prefer to play in Ethereum now, but yeah, for sure at the end of the year, bitcoin is going to be at 100k. I'm sure about that. But I think on Ethereum, just ether and d five coin I think are going to pump even more. Gary Sente, I believe Mark Cuban own NFT and Ethereum also.
00:39:29.272 - 00:40:00.384, Speaker A: Yes, indeed. I covered this last week, Tristan. Not sure if ether gas costs can be a major problem. Yeah, of course. So that's why you have all these projects on layer two scaling solution that are pumping up, that are launched right and left. And actually on this topic, so there is matic is a big layer two scaling solution. And so their token, I think appreciated by 100% over the last two weeks.
00:40:00.384 - 00:40:29.892, Speaker A: So in general, I'm super bullish for all the tokens of project for l two scaling solution. Like optimism, Matic. What else? There is also this decks on l two. Oh, I forgot the name. Okay, well, it will come back, but yeah, there is these decks on l two. And I'm also super bullish on that one. Gary Sente Julian, PayPal does not allow you to withdraw your coin from their account.
00:40:29.892 - 00:40:58.208, Speaker A: Yes, I'm aware of that. Yeah, no, I really dislike PayPal. Dentas Dao is the new GameStop. I didn't follow what was happening with Daos. Didn't follow that. Shazan. Hey, Julian, how are you? Can you please talk about the graph? The graph I've made a video about the graph a few months ago, but there isn't anything new.
00:40:58.208 - 00:41:22.990, Speaker A: Well, I mean, they launched their main net a couple of weeks ago, but apart from that, yeah, it's the part of the infrastructure of Ethereum. It's used mainly for reading data. So yeah, it's an important project, but it's not the project that excites me the most. Yeah, it's a good project, but yeah, nothing special. Batman. Almost miss it today. Oh, no.
00:41:22.990 - 00:41:50.064, Speaker A: How comes, Batman? How comes you dare to miss my live stream? Shazan. Okay, not just the same question as before for the graph. Gary Sensei, can you explain the morphers network? I think this is about supply chain, but I don't know more about it. Mobileaji greetings from Nigeria. Hey, man. Oh yeah. Fabio.
00:41:50.064 - 00:42:07.188, Speaker A: Loop ring. Yes. Okay. Yeah, that's the project I meant just before loop ring. I'm also really bullish for loop rink. Gary Santa. So what's your take on Ethereum futures launched by CME group? Yeah, it's good because it will allow a lot of institutional to get exposure to ether.
00:42:07.188 - 00:42:41.844, Speaker A: So it's going to pump ether and I don't think we're going to suffer from the short position because I don't think there are enough foolish people to try to short Ethereum because I think it would be like GameStop basically, except there is no way to stop the buying. Batman Lord. I will never let it happen again. Julian. Okay, very good. All right, guys, well, I think we are going to conclude here. So yeah, just before quickly, just let me repost the link.
00:42:41.844 - 00:43:06.284, Speaker A: So, yeah, make sure if you're a newbie here, make sure to register for my upcoming training how to get a one UK blockchain job in 2021. This is going to be February 23. So this month, in two weeks, you have to register to get the link. It will not be on YouTube. It. All right, guys, thanks for coming here and I will see you later this week for another video on my channel. Have a great week, guy.
00:43:06.284 - 00:43:08.248, Speaker A: Have a great week. Bye.
