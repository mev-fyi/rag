00:00:05.970 - 00:00:27.286, Speaker A: You and we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and defy. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. And in this video, I'm gonna be talking of Ethereum. That keeps going, keeps going up. New all time high.
00:00:27.286 - 00:00:48.462, Speaker A: I mean, you know, it's like Christmas. Like it's just too easy. Mastercard, which is moving to crypto. We're going to be talking of Ethereum competitors. We have some serious news from an Ethereum competitors that shows they are closing in on Ethereum supercritical info. You absolutely have to follow this. And if you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host.
00:00:48.462 - 00:01:21.198, Speaker A: And on my channel in the blocks, I explain blockchain technology. Quick mention to my upcoming trade training how to get a $100 blockchain job in 2021. This is going to be next week, on February 23 at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. So if you are a newbie and you want to get into the industry, make sure to register for this training. This is free, but you have to register because this is not going to be on YouTube. It's going to be outside.
00:01:21.198 - 00:01:35.878, Speaker A: So I'm putting the link in the chat and hi, people. In the chat, we have Eric. We have Dunamis. Hey, hey. We have Muibi. We have Chan chai. We have Tana.
00:01:35.878 - 00:02:03.786, Speaker A: Cool to see some activity in the chat. All right, so first of all, I want to thank all of you who are watching idoblocks because the channel is doing great. New all time high. Yes. During the last month, the views grew by more than 50%. I never experienced this since the beginning of it. The blocks, it's just completely amazing.
00:02:03.786 - 00:02:21.658, Speaker A: And we will reach 1 million views on the channel next month. It's going to be a huge milestone. And after we just keep going up gala, we're going to the moon. Like in crypto. Okay. All time high everywhere. All time high for ether.
00:02:21.658 - 00:02:47.314, Speaker A: All time high for ether blocks. All time high everywhere. Everywhere. All right, so as a crypto guy, you need to know the best crypto meme. It's very important because otherwise you cannot be accepted in the industry. All right? The blockchain company, they don't care about your coding skill. They want to make sure you know the meme.
00:02:47.314 - 00:03:08.234, Speaker A: Okay? This is the most important. So I selected for you the best meme when you crypto moon, but you remain the same boring guy. Yeah. I hope one day I can relate to that one. Okay, I like this one. How people think it's like to huddle. How it's actually like to huddle.
00:03:08.234 - 00:03:14.954, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, this, this is super important. It's not going to be a smooth road. Okay. It's not going to be a smooth ride. Oh, that one is so good. Okay.
00:03:14.954 - 00:03:41.418, Speaker A: Being a crypto trader is not stressing at all. John, 26 years old. All right. You don't want to be like that guy. Okay? So don't invest too much. All right, so we start with the price of ether. What's going on on ether? So new all time high at 1867, to be exact.
00:03:41.418 - 00:04:05.070, Speaker A: So we haven't tested 2000 yet. And later in the week, we almost lost all the gains of the week. And so now we're kind of going sideway. But you have to remember that before we increase really fast. So it's kind of normal. We have some consolidation. Now we're probably going to test two k, that is for sure.
00:04:05.070 - 00:04:43.614, Speaker A: So if it is not this week, it's going to be next week or by the end of the month. But yeah, we're going to test two k very soon then. Also, you have to know that it has been the first week when after ethereum, after the Ethereum future were launched on CME. So that was like a really big event. And so some people were predicting a big crash in ether, as we saw with bitcoin in 2017, after bitcoin features were introduced. But it did not happen. The crash did not happen.
00:04:43.614 - 00:05:24.380, Speaker A: So everything is good. Okay, so Mark Cuban Shields Ethereum. So in the defiant podcast, he said EtH has an advantage over bitcoin as a store of value. I love this dude, and I hope that he convinced his billionaire friends. So he's really excited about smart contract, which will lay the foundation for what he calls friction free banking. And because most of the innovation is happening on Ethereum, he believes ETh is becoming a better store of value than bitcoin. I agree.
00:05:24.380 - 00:06:07.870, Speaker A: So, yeah, one more billionaire who becomes crypto friendly after Elon Musk, I think before Makuban was not super keen on crypto. So, yeah, he made a big change. Yeah. So, yeah, we want to see more billionaires who are in crypto. So grayscale is adding another $93 million of ether to its crypto fund to really show you that the demand for ether is accelerating. So in December, 200 million were added to their Ethereum fund, and in the last 30 days, 339,000,000 were added. So it's going exponential.
00:06:07.870 - 00:06:37.426, Speaker A: It's going up. So gas price, what's going on for gas price? Gas price are super high. Soon it will be worse than for the last defi server. It's not great. This plus the higher price of ether that makes Ethereum transaction insanely expensive. I think now even for a simple transaction, it's something like $10 for ES 20 token. It's like maybe 20, $30 now.
00:06:37.426 - 00:07:11.546, Speaker A: And actually for the first time I had one student who wanted to pay me outside of the Ethereum network. So he wanted to pay me in busd on the binance smart chain. So yeah, I will add payment, a crypto payment for binance smart chain. Side note. Side note. Okay, so just something very important with this high gas fee is that you have to make sure that you will not be in a gas prison. So gas prison is when it's not worth it to spend your coin because you spend more in transaction fee than the value of the coin.
00:07:11.546 - 00:07:51.398, Speaker A: So make sure you don't have like dust that is spread out. You need to consolidate your position to make it worth it and escape the gas prison. Okay, what's the situation on Ethereum 2.0? So there are more than 3 million eth that are locked out of a total supply of 110,000,000. So that's about $5.5 billion at current prices. What about the yield? How are we doing for the yield now? We are at about, yeah, still 9%.
00:07:51.398 - 00:08:15.922, Speaker A: So it's pretty good yield. And we are approaching 100,000 validators. Soon we'll be at 100,000. And that's to be compared with 11,000 nodes for ethereum one. So Ethereum 2.0 hasn't started yet, and already we can see that we have many more nodes than on ETh one. So ultimately, Ethereum 2.0
00:08:15.922 - 00:09:00.126, Speaker A: could go up to 1 million validators, which will make it by far the most decentralized blockchain completely unbreakable, even if the worlds become mad Max in 20 years when we have coronavirus 30, which comes out. Okay, Ethereum is going to be there, I'm telling you. So then we going to check the situation for the DFI market cap. New all time high, almost 40 billion. So ether keeps flowing into DFI. This is something I'm very happy to see with 7.7. I don't know how to say number in English, guy.
00:09:00.126 - 00:09:30.326, Speaker A: I forget my English, sorry. 7.75 million if locked in ether. And so this is about 7% of the total amount of eth. So we have a lot of room to grow. Now we have more than twelve protocol with more than $1 billion locked so that's really huge. I remember when we had the first DeFi protocol above 1 million at the beginning of last year.
00:09:30.326 - 00:09:58.834, Speaker A: It was a huge milestone. But now we have twelve and soon we will have our first Defi protocol that reaches 10 billion. It will happen soon, in the next few weeks probably, or next few months. And next I want to show you the fierce battle between Uniswap and sushi swap. The battle is more fierce than ever. So here you can see the east looking sushi swap. Uniswap is going down and sushi swap, it is going up.
00:09:58.834 - 00:10:41.520, Speaker A: And sushiswap has almost caught up 1 million here, almost caught up with uniswap. So yeah, sushi swap, gradually winning some market share will be interesting to see what's happened next. All right then let's check out the rate. So this is if you lend your crypto in a lending protocol like compan avedx. So rates have been pretty high for a couple of weeks now. We have more than 10% for all the stable coins die, USDC, USDT across the board plus 10%. It's really nice to see this really high rate here.
00:10:41.520 - 00:11:27.918, Speaker A: Okay, so next we are going to talk of the winner and okay, let me do some googling here because I think one of my tab, I closed one of my tab by accident. Top 100 D five token. All right, some googling skill here. Some googling skill. Okay, load, load, load. And let's arrange this by change for the past seven day. Why you don't let me sort this? Okay.
00:11:27.918 - 00:11:45.974, Speaker A: Oh, I'm not on the correct website. I'm not on the correct website. I don't want this one. I want congeco. Sorry guys, some last minute improvisation, some technicality. All right, scroll down, scroll down, scroll down. Okay, I'm back.
00:11:45.974 - 00:12:10.982, Speaker A: I'm back on track. I'm back on track. So for the winner, we have mostly winners this week. So auto farm crazy, almost 900%. So it's a yield aggregator on finance, smart chain, so similar to yarn finance. And currently they have some crazy apy there like 500% for some of their votes. So really insane.
00:12:10.982 - 00:12:49.670, Speaker A: And in general on finance, smart chain is really quite crazy. Now APY finance, another yield aggregator on Ethereum. This time then we have NFTx. So this is a project to create an index fund for NFts which allow you to have a fractional ownership of an expensive NFT. And that is super useful because a lot of NFT, they are very expensive and basically it locks out of the market. Most people like you and me who just are not, probably not willing to invest $100,000 in some virtual app. I mean, it's beautiful, but yeah, $100,000, it's a bit expensive.
00:12:49.670 - 00:13:17.940, Speaker A: So with NFTX, you can invest in expensive NFT, even if you're a normal guy. So very useful project. Then we have, what do we have? Which is pumping this week? What do we have? Which is pumping? We have Rari. Where is Rari? I think it's that one. Rgt Rari. So this is a marketplace for NFT. And NFT are doing great.
00:13:17.940 - 00:13:45.654, Speaker A: PNT of the P networks. This is a project for portable tokens. So in other words, synthetics assets. For example, if you have tokens on Ethereum and you want to trade them on another blockchain like Binance march, and you can do it with Ptoken. So this is for inter blockchain communication. Very, very useful project. Then for the loser, what do we have? Cream finance.
00:13:45.654 - 00:14:08.882, Speaker A: Okay, let's scrub. Yeah, cream finance, they were hacked. It's normal, ample. So that's an algorithmic stablecoin, which is really struggling to keep its peg. It's really moving all the time. So yeah, the algorithmic stable coin is something that if it can work, can be really amazing. But currently it doesn't work.
00:14:08.882 - 00:14:32.354, Speaker A: It doesn't work well enough. Opium derivatives protocol. Yeah, alpha. They were hacked. So it's normal that they are losing, but overall not a lot of red here, mostly green. Okay, so next we are going to switch to the news specific news for DeFi project. So first, matic rebranding.
00:14:32.354 - 00:15:25.462, Speaker A: So matic network is one of the leader in a layer two scaling solution on Ethereum. And they, they are rebranding into so far matic network, they have seen a number of crypto gaming projects that choose it for scalability, purpose. And next with Polygon, they want to be able to bring major defi brand into Matic. So yeah, basically it's going to be between Matic and. So personally I'm probably going to invest in both tokens because they really solve a very pressing issue for Ethereum. So I'm really bullish for layer two scaling solution. Then some news about yearn finance.
00:15:25.462 - 00:16:39.230, Speaker A: So the yearn community decided to compensate addresses that lost money during their hack, because they were hacked for the wide eye vault one week ago. So to do that, they will mint some new Wi Fi token. And this new Wi Fi token will be used to take a loan of Dai through maker. And then after they will use this dye to reimburse addresses. So this is really the first time we hear about this, this system of borrowing money, borrowing some dai like this, it's very unique. So the Dai loan will be paid at with fees earned by the yearn ecosystem. So yeah, it's quite interesting because this is basically taking value off the token, but it's more like they are basically making user of yern finance pay compensate for the people who lost.
00:16:39.230 - 00:17:18.810, Speaker A: Yeah, I like this idea. So the Yern community said that it will be a one time thing and next time yarn users should probably buy protection on cover, which is an insurance protocol which is part of the yearn ecosystem. That's it for this news. Next, another news about yern finance. So they announced a partnership with Badger Dao. So this is deal which is focused on bitcoin. So you can expect more fun with your genbtc token in yearn.
00:17:18.810 - 00:18:10.266, Speaker A: So it's really impressive to see the yern finance ecosystem that just keeps developing and announcing new partnerships. So I really wonder which project didn't do a partnership with Yern Finance already. It seems that occupying the whole DeFi space at this point. But keep in mind that also with all this integration, it actually makes yearn finance quite risky because the surface area for the attacks is very large. It's not just the code of yearn finance, but it's also all this other protocol it integrates with. So really it's the other side of the coin. With then the Federal Reserve of Saint Louis in the US wrote a long report on DeFi.
00:18:10.266 - 00:18:40.870, Speaker A: They are finally waking up. I mean it's good to see that finally they're following what's going on. So it's really good article. It's a good intro to DeFi with many chart. Yeah, really nice summary. All right, so next we're going to talk of hacking. So what is the hack of the week? The hack of the week, ladies and gentlemen.
00:18:40.870 - 00:19:03.486, Speaker A: He has been won by cream finance and alpha finance. Congratulations. I'm being so mean, man. But yeah, they lost 37.5 million in two flash loan attack. I think it's the biggest DFI hack ever. I think it's an absolute record.
00:19:03.486 - 00:19:56.370, Speaker A: So I believe that all the projects that do insurance for DeFi, like cover, et cetera, I think they're going to do super well. I think in the future it's just going to be standard practice. Probably they're going to be some integration from. I think what's going to happen is when you are in the DeFi protocol, automatically you're going to have a widget just after you take a position, you're going to have a widget that says, okay, now do you want to buy cover for this? And yes, pretty sure it's going to become standard. Okay, so then some news about NFT. So we have a new record for an NFT sale. So there were nine plots of land on the blockchain game, Axi Infinity that were sold for $1.5
00:19:56.370 - 00:20:20.466, Speaker A: million. Wow. Just wow. It's the biggest NFT sale ever. And I'm just so jealous of the seller because I'm sure he's the kind of guy, he just saw this game at the very beginning and he said, oh, that's cool. Okay, let's buy some plot. And just bought that super cheap.
00:20:20.466 - 00:20:43.310, Speaker A: And then he forgot and then he came back and he realized he was popular and then boom, 1.5 million. Yeah, kind of very similar to the guys who bought bitcoin ten years ago. So, yeah, $1.5 million. Wow. Okay, so next we're going to Touch of Mastercard.
00:20:43.310 - 00:21:36.162, Speaker A: So Mastercard announced that they will support crypto on network. It's a major announcement. Really big announcement. So I quote the article, we will be very thoughtful about which assets we support based on our principle for digital currency, which focus on consumer protection and compliance. That means you should probably not expect Dogecoin on Mastercard, right? No, but seriously though, I think first they will focus on centralized stablecoins like Tether or USDC. So I quote the article again, this change may open merchants up to new customers who are already flocking to digital assets and help sellers build loyalty with existing customers who want this additional option. So they don't explain exactly what they're going to do.
00:21:36.162 - 00:22:22.350, Speaker A: I think customers will be able to pay in crypto in the future, but I'm not sure if the merchant will see the crypto. Maybe it will be changed directly into fiat money. Any article? They also mentioned some potential integration with CDBC. So central bank stable coins, which is the next big thing from. In terms of adoption, I think CDVC are going to be absolutely huge, but right now this is still in an early development. Then some news from BNY Mellon. So that's a really big bank in the US.
00:22:22.350 - 00:23:01.994, Speaker A: And they announced they're going to do some crypto custodial. So that means institutionals will be able to store the crypto at BNY Mellon, because institutionals, they don't want to deal with private key. They don't want this responsibility. So you can really see that Wall street is moving to crypto, and it's really incredible to see how fast it's happening. It's happening super fast. Not even just a few years ago that all the CEO of Wall street, they were just like making fun of crypto, just saying it's a scam, like the CEO of Morgan, et cetera. And now, one after the other, they just keep making some new announcements.
00:23:01.994 - 00:23:24.850, Speaker A: It's pretty amazing. All right, then, let's talk a little bit of other blockchains. So we start with bitcoin. So Twitter is considering buying some bitcoin. So it's a new trend for big companies. If you want to be cool, you got to have some bitcoin in your balance sheet. This is a new thing for top CEO.
00:23:24.850 - 00:24:04.130, Speaker A: So keep in mind that although this announcement can seem impressive, it's still a small part of their balance sheet that this company, they have huge balance sheet. So, yeah, small part of that, but it's going in the right direction. And Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, is actually a big supporter of crypto. He runs his own guys. Yes, and he also brought bitcoin payment to square cash app. So yeah, big, big support. Another billionaire who is pro crypto.
00:24:04.130 - 00:24:46.720, Speaker A: Next we can talk of Binance smart chain. So still kicking asses. So Venus protocol on binance smart chain is now the number one dap in all blockchain in terms of transaction volume above uniswap and sushiswap on Ethereum. So I've been thinking one thing. This is just a speculation, okay? But Sushiswap is such a dynamic community, I expect them at some point to create a version of Sushiswap on Binance smart chain. And maybe the same thing for Yun finance. Yes, I expect some move in the very near future.
00:24:46.720 - 00:25:23.322, Speaker A: BNB token, which is the native token of binance smart chain, is also doing very well. And Binance is also building a bridge to Polkadot. So in less than six months, binance smart chain just has had a huge impact on the defi industry. So it's definitely the most serious competitor to currently. Very serious threat to Ethereum. Then some news from Cardano, another Ethereum competitor. So Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, is doing some drama again.
00:25:23.322 - 00:25:54.900, Speaker A: So in a video on Twitter, he talked about progress and why Ethereum is not a serious competitor. So he said, I quote, ethereum first mover effect is worth as much as Myspace. Original success, nothing. Okay. Oh, man. I don't know why you find his sentence, but, wow. Then he said, cardano is not about the price or hype, it's about developing things.
00:25:54.900 - 00:26:30.926, Speaker A: And then he said, I was very angry if this does not appeal to you, there are ecosystem that do that. Tron is an example and there are dozen of others. It's really typical Charles hosting son here. He's always such a nice guy, right? No, but seriously, I don't understand why you always feel the need to do so much drama. That's one big reason I don't like Cardano. Yeah. So on Cardano, I do think the price of Ada is going to keep pumping because the price psychologically still very low.
00:26:30.926 - 00:27:13.470, Speaker A: It's under one dollars. So we're going to have some resistance at one dollars, but it's going to keep pumping. But in terms of the tech, even though they are releasing smart contract this year, they are just really so late in the game. So I don't think how they can ever make a comeback really seems like a lost coast to me. But anyway, we can still have some fun and check out the rent of Charles host Kingston from time to time. It's quite entertaining. So then some news from Avalanche, which is another Ethereum competitor.
00:27:13.470 - 00:27:42.182, Speaker A: So there was a big bug that was triggered by unusually high volume. So actually blockchain itself is not even working. So you know what guys, I want to be like Nelson. Okay. When I heard that I want to be like Nelson. Okay, so we hear Nelson from the Simpson. I'm so mean.
00:27:42.182 - 00:28:12.910, Speaker A: Okay. All right, so now we are going to do the Q and a very quickly I post the link to the free training. So this is in about one week. So February 23 at 11:00 p.m.. UTC. Plus head had to get a blockchain job in 2021. If you are new in your industry and you want to find your first blockchain job, register for this free training.
00:28:12.910 - 00:28:32.962, Speaker A: You have to register. It's not on YouTube. I will send you the link if you register and you'll be able to attend. All right, so let me see all the questions. So let me scroll up in the chat. Daniel Novak. Hey, John Obladen.
00:28:32.962 - 00:28:57.242, Speaker A: Hi, Steve Carey. Hey, check. Hi Julian, sorry I'm late. Happy landigrax. Julian. I am in dab 30 course. Awesome backs.
00:28:57.242 - 00:29:17.250, Speaker A: Awesome. John Peterson, best dev channel. Thank you. I really appreciate IoDG. Can you include Tron USDT as payment method? Okay, yeah, I can do it. Okay. Question from John Peterson.
00:29:17.250 - 00:29:44.780, Speaker A: How do we solve the east gas problem? Short and long solution. So long term solution is east two, but we can do anything about this. We just have to wait and see. It's probably going to be in two years, but in the meantime it's going to be layer two scaling solution like matic and optimism. So as a developer, check out the doc of this project. I might do a tutorial on my channel because I think it's quite important. Yeah.
00:29:44.780 - 00:30:17.640, Speaker A: Second hide. Have you used loop ring yet? No, but I want to try their dex is l two. No high gas fee on swap or transfer to other lt wallet. Pretty cool to see roll ups in a while. Yeah, so personally I want to invest in optimism, matic and loop ring uniswap alternative with less fee on Ethereum, you're not going to see a lot of difference. You have to go on binance. Smart chain pancake swap, for example.
00:30:17.640 - 00:30:58.930, Speaker A: Devante is link undervalued? I didn't check the price of link. I think there was a lot of hype before, so I think it pumped a lot already. Yeah, it seems like the market cap of link is pretty high. Okay, let me see. Hayodeji would say for cheaper decks you can check honeyswap on XDAi. Yes, Neil HJ, I've already subscribed to your course. How can I get in touch with you if you are in a private discord, you can send me a pm.
00:30:58.930 - 00:31:41.074, Speaker A: Otherwise you can send me an email at Julian at. Yeah, let me put it in the chat. Julian at though. Nilesh J. What's the threat to Ethereum other than binance? Okay, so for this you need to check my video Ethereum killers. It was, I think, a couple of weeks ago I released this video, so I explained everything. Stefan McCarthy really enjoy your recent Uniswap sushiswap flashlone arbitrage video.
00:31:41.074 - 00:32:30.226, Speaker A: Thank you for next step with that thought on JS other tooling library to monitor real time price difference and simulate execution. So you know that I have a course on flashloan where we have the complete thing, not just the solidity part, but also the node JS script. This is arbitrage between Kyber and Uniswap. It's not exactly the same thing, but you can be inspired for the logic. So yeah, for the tooling library, really use node js then Webstery or ethers JS to connect to the blockchain. I don't think you'll find any really useful APIs to monitor the price difference because you want to be really quick. So you want to do it yourself.
00:32:30.226 - 00:32:57.974, Speaker A: You want to do it from scratch. You code the node JS code yourself. If you use an API, there's going to be some latency and it's not going to be fast enough. So yeah, you just have to do it yourself. Jan. Hey Julian, what do you think may happen to defi when USDT really goes under? Will other stablecoin lose their peg as well? Maybe to the upside through increased buy pressure? Yes. So tether is the biggest stable coin.
00:32:57.974 - 00:33:31.000, Speaker A: I think they are at a $30 billion of market cap. And if you compare with Dai, so die is something like maybe 2 billion, so much smaller. But actually DAi, in one of their collateral, they are exposed to tether and many other defi protocol that depend on tether as well. No, I mean, it would be a real disaster if something bad happened to tether. But I know there were a lot of controversy around tether. But recently we had a good news for tether. Basically beat Phoenix, who took a loan of, I think that was 500 million.
00:33:31.000 - 00:34:02.430, Speaker A: They took a loan of 500 million from the tether foundation and that was one of the main reason of the drama. And they reimbursed, finally they reimbursed this loan. Yeah, but also we have all these other coins, stable coins that are being developed, the algorithmic stable coins. So right now they are not ready. But fortunately at some point they'll be ready. And when they will be ready, they will totally replace the coins like tether and USDC. But this is in the future.
00:34:02.430 - 00:34:30.506, Speaker A: This is not for now. Michael, join late, but here to support the channel. Yes, thank you, Michael. Ali Gerani, question here. How can someone schedule a one on one Zoom Skype call with you? You can go on. Okay, so for this, let me show you. You go there and here you go.
00:34:30.506 - 00:35:18.586, Speaker A: In private coaching, I just put the link, you book your session here and after I send you an email and we can schedule the time. All right, Ankit hello Julian, thanks for the great content so far. Yeah, welcome. Enkid Cabio was the flash loan hacked because of bad? Know with flash loan it's a little bit more difficult to spot bugs. So even if you maybe the code was pretty good. But there was one scenario that didn't anticipate it. So I wouldn't say it's bad code, but in any case, that was a security vulnerability, so they had to fix it.
00:35:18.586 - 00:35:53.250, Speaker A: But yeah, really like flash loan make the surface area for the attack way bigger. That's for sure. All right, seek and tide. Is Coinbase going to be the first publicly traded central exchange? Well, it looks like it. So they're going to do their ipo and people are talking of 100 billion dollar valuation, which is absolutely huge. So yeah, it's probably going to happen this year. Freddie is saying, hey, Julian, enjoy your channel.
00:35:53.250 - 00:36:31.760, Speaker A: How easy is it to code for the binance smart chain? Well, if you know how to code on ethereum, then it's pretty easy because basically binance smart chain is a copy paste of ethereum. So yeah, it's mostly the same three dt, truffle, web3, et cetera. I mean, you can reuse a lot of the same stuff. So you can check on my channel. I have a tutorial to create your first smart contract on binance smart chain. Sick and tired in saying that the websockets API of binance smart chain is really good. Okay, interesting.
00:36:31.760 - 00:37:19.920, Speaker A: Kabir, do you know of any good Defi open source project to contribute to? I don't know one specifically, but what you can do is first of all, be involved in the community, in a different discord community of some defi project. Try to have a feel of whether you like interacting with the community. And also on GitHub, you can search issue. Maybe I can do a demo live. Let me see, let me see if I can do this. Okay, so GitHub and you have a way to search for issue. Let me see.
00:37:19.920 - 00:38:14.430, Speaker A: Oh man, I lost my GitHub skill. But basically here you have a lot of way of filtering the issue. And so you can filter the issue to have some tag in it. Some example of tag is something like beginner friendly. You have like a couple of tag like this for open source project that are looking to onboard new people. And so you search issue like this on GitHub and you will be able to find projects that are beginner friendly. All right, Finman, is DSD worth buying at? Don't know this coin.
00:38:14.430 - 00:38:50.006, Speaker A: Don't know this coin. Julian, donate as a personal project, I would like to do something involving solidity and smart contract. Would you have something fun to recommend? Less risky than 2 million die flash loan for arbitrage. Okay, actually a flash loan, you don't risk anything because you don't use your own capital. You just pay for the transaction if you will just pay well, nice, quiet, high. Yeah, you don't risk any capital. But let me see, it seems to me, the way you're asking the question, it seems to me you're already a developer.
00:38:50.006 - 00:39:21.910, Speaker A: So let me see, what do I have in stock for you? Yeah, we do have something for you. Let me see. So let me see. I have a tutorial, a full tutorial to do election. I think I did this like, let me scroll down, scroll down. Oh yeah. Blockchain prediction market.
00:39:21.910 - 00:39:46.238, Speaker A: Yeah. So if you want like a full tutorial, something fun. This one. So it's basically you're going to code a prediction market on Ethereum. Let me put this in the chat. Okay then next question. Gary sent it.
00:39:46.238 - 00:40:29.238, Speaker A: Yo Julian, I might be late as always, but there are questions to be asked. When does EIP 1559 goes into effect? It's still subject of heavy discussion. So yeah, probably I should do a video about this because this is a really big topic in Ethereum. I will talk more about it later. Philippe Jimon, I was monitoring Unisop and sushi pools for around 2 hours, but there didn't seem to be any arbitrage opportunity. Is it even possible to have a profitable boat with just node js and infura? Well, it's not possible to give you a binary answer, yes or not. I can just tell you that it's more difficult to do it with inferra.
00:40:29.238 - 00:40:46.414, Speaker A: It's easier to do it if you have your own node. Nilesh, you do private coaching as. Yes, yes I do. Yeah, I posted the link just above. Gary Santi, can you explain also avalanche. Thank you. Okay.
00:40:46.414 - 00:41:18.540, Speaker A: Or in another video because I haven't researched it, but yeah, I just understand vaguely it's Ethereum competitor with smart contract capabilities. But to be honest, when I hear this, I already feel bored because there are so many projects that say the same thing and say we're going to be more scalable than Ethereum, we're going to do smart contract. Okay, great. And what about network effect? It's always like the same argument and I don't think that avalanche is very different for that. But I will have a look. I will have a look. Yeah.
00:41:18.540 - 00:41:45.518, Speaker A: Thanks for suggesting this, Gary. Okay. Sick and tired. Everest KYc seems like a breakthrough. What do you think? Do you think the token is a buy? So I don't know of any other project that is doing something similar. So that means currently they are the leader in their little niche. Actually talk of Everest KYC in the previous weekly livestream.
00:41:45.518 - 00:42:04.220, Speaker A: So yeah, check. You can check. There are timestamps in each video to go directly to the correct time. Finman DSD dollar set protocol. Okay. Algorithmic stablecoin, another algorithmic stable coin. Okay, interesting.
00:42:04.220 - 00:42:37.270, Speaker A: Ankit. Hello Julian. Other blockchain jobs that doesn't require development skills. Yeah, so I mean you can do stuff related to design. For example, they are like lawyers, community managers. There are people who do more like a management stuff. There are people who.
00:42:37.270 - 00:43:14.246, Speaker A: So for example, you could manage a team of developers. There is also a kind of job that I like which is very unique. It's called oh, what's the name of that? It's the kind of job where basically you have to deal with the community of developers. I think it's developer evangelist. Yeah, I think this is the name developer. Let me type this in the chat. Developer evangelist.
00:43:14.246 - 00:43:44.474, Speaker A: There are different name for this kind of job, but basically you have to write some tutorials to onboard developer to use some API. It's not very technical. You need to know a little bit of coding, but not too much. And there is one student of idoblocks who did that kind of job at Aragon, I believe. And I think he enjoyed his job really a lot. I think he was flown to conferences right and left. He met a lot of different people.
00:43:44.474 - 00:44:02.590, Speaker A: So it was really a hybrid between a communication and coding skills. Yeah. Okay, let me see. I think I talked for too much because now have a look at the chat. It's like ten more questions. But I love it. I love it.
00:44:02.590 - 00:44:48.138, Speaker A: Okay, big boss, can you describe how front runners get ahead of your flash loans? So they are mostly miners. Basically what they do is they analyze, they try to run your transaction, but by modifying the signing address, so they reproduce the step of your transaction but with their address. And if they notice that there is a profit, then they send their transaction first. That's how they do it. But it's pretty technical. It's really not easy technically to do this. Second target, team Wagner, who created AWS Lambda, launched Vendia.
00:44:48.138 - 00:45:14.098, Speaker A: It's a distributed compute platform that includes a ledger. What do you think about private blockchain and blockchain database? Hyperledger fabric. Okay, I think there are many questions. In one, let's focus on what I know. Hyperledger fabric. So Hyperledger fabric, that was an early attempt to do a blockchain for corporate. So a private blockchain.
00:45:14.098 - 00:46:06.786, Speaker A: But recently we had the news of IBM, who was very, very involved in Hyperledger fabric. And IBM, they are closing down their blockchain division. So I'm not too sure about the future of Hyperledger fabric. And in the meantime, we had another project, Hyperledger Bezu, which is basically copy and paste of Ethereum, but adapted for corporate, you can do private blockchain with. So I think Hyperledger Bezu has much more future than fabric because it reuses the tech of Ethereum with all the development tools, et cetera. And so ethereum, really nice, is like a standard in the blockchain industry. So Hyperledger fabric, it was like a relic of the early stage of the industry, but yeah, not too bullish.
00:46:06.786 - 00:46:35.922, Speaker A: On that. I'm a hyperledger fabric developer for last two years. I have beginner level knowledge on three dtes. I've watched most of your video on smart contract. How do I get more involved? Any roadmap? Okay, so Sally, make sure to register for my free training. I post it again in the chat. It will be February 23.
00:46:35.922 - 00:47:09.702, Speaker A: I will explain everything to get started on Ethereum in this live training. Neelash, what has your thought about Bezu Hyperledger? Well, I think I just answered that just before. Philip, could you make a tutorial on how to set up a full node? Yeah, I've been thinking about this. I think this is a great idea. Jake, what's the top three dapps to create right now? Wow, big question. Decentralized exchange on a layer two solution. Layer two scaling solution.
00:47:09.702 - 00:47:45.078, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a big 1 second one, but that one is super tough. It's super tough. Social network on the blockchain. I think we really need it. When we saw what happened with all the censorship recently, I think we need it then what else? Maybe another big thing is a yield aggregator. If you do a yield aggregator, you are sure that when you launch it you're going to have a lot of liquidity. However, people will not stay a long time.
00:47:45.078 - 00:48:45.910, Speaker A: They will stay like for a couple of weeks and then they will go to another. So just from the top of my head, like three ideas for dapps. Gary Sente, what's going on with NFT and billionaires adoption to their portfolio? What's your take? Oh yeah, it's so I think billionaire, you know, like they have so much money they can really afford to explore the space. So when they get started with crypto, they start with bitcoin, then they start to do some meme on Twitter and then they get bored and then they get into Eth and then they get into defi. And finally the last stage is NFT. But it's really possible that in the future for rich people it will be trendy to have some NFT. And when they invited someone and they show to other people, the NFT also apparently in the future, people will display their NFT at home with a monitor.
00:48:45.910 - 00:49:15.626, Speaker A: So instead of a painting, it will be like a monitor that show to guest the NFT that you bought. So yeah, I think it will be a thing. Yeah, I mean it's really Sci-Fi I love it. But yeah, it's happening. Filipe Olivera is it true that ago blockchain opening a new mine in Texas? Oh, I don't know blockchain? It's possible. Oh, yeah. Godwin Jimmy was confirming.
00:49:15.626 - 00:49:59.506, Speaker A: Yeah, the word I was looking for before is developer evangelist. It's a kind of developer position which is not too technical. So let me see. Stefan McCarthy, your first react app, a to do list in the web development course, seems to be similar to the content from the book pro Mernstack. If I read that book, do you think I can skip the web dev class? I don't know this book pro Mernstack, so I cannot answer you. But in the course, web development for blockchain, I did not copy material from anywhere. Okay, so it's completely custom.
00:49:59.506 - 00:50:31.470, Speaker A: I created this app myself. So, yeah, I didn't take it from anywhere. Stefan McCarthy, just take the six figure blockchain developer course for solidity and then be ready for the flash loan. Yeah, don't take the flash loan course first. The priority is six figure because that's what's going to give you the core skill that you need to get started in the industry. And flash loan is like the cherry on top of the cake. But yeah, start with six figure.
00:50:31.470 - 00:50:48.830, Speaker A: Yeah. Godwin Jimmy, there is blockchain technical writers too. Oh, yes. We were asking this question before. Are there jobs in blockchain that are not technical? Yeah, technical writer. Yeah, it's possible to do it. Nilesh.
00:50:48.830 - 00:51:31.082, Speaker A: So Bezu has absolutely big feature. John Peterson, how are boats attacking pre sales? So boats? Yes, I think this is related to. I think you're referring to initial Dex offering when a new token is launched, when there isn't a lot of liquidity. I know that some boats have been doing some manipulation, but I need to study this more. Yeah, I need to study this sick and tired. Nice. I had no idea IBM was more value on east.
00:51:31.082 - 00:51:52.674, Speaker A: Okay, moving on, moving on. In the chat Saif link for the free training. Yeah, it's just above. Okay, let me post it again. Yeah, post it a couple of times. All right. Gajesh.
00:51:52.674 - 00:52:04.586, Speaker A: Saying hi, Julian. Hi. Gazesh. Yeah, Gazesh, who is coming to a lot of my. Yeah, yeah. I'm really happy when I see the same faces showing up at every live stream. It's great.
00:52:04.586 - 00:52:37.654, Speaker A: It's great. Philip, is react better than Vue js for front end app development? If so, why? Yes, because react is really the standard in the industry. Most blockchain job will require you to know react, so you have to know it. Some company will require Vue, but it's really secondary. The first one is react. So there is always like two part to this argument. The first one is the job situation.
00:52:37.654 - 00:53:18.450, Speaker A: So for the job situation is react, and then the second one is personal developer preference. And this is really an endless debate. Some developers prefer react, some developers prefer vue. Both have their pros and cons. What is good with Vue is that it's very all integrated, so you don't need to stitch together a lot of different libraries. You have the router and everything is already combined and ready to use with react. It's more lightweight, it's more modular, but you have to do more work to assemble different libraries.
00:53:18.450 - 00:54:09.730, Speaker A: Asking do you think there will be rewards for running ipfs nodes? I think the docs mentioned rewards on the roadmap. I'm not sure this will be implemented at the ipfs level, but maybe some protocols on top of it. Like a file coin. Yeah, if you run a file coin node you get some reward. Gary, as far as programming language only solidity or is Viper also coming soon? No. So Viper, if I remember well, I think they stopped development and now they are working on another one called Faye Fe. But we really don't see a lot of activity on viper.
00:54:09.730 - 00:54:49.486, Speaker A: Uniswap V one was written with Viper, but for Uniswap V two it was rewritten in solidity and Uniswap V one was pretty much the only major d five project that used Viper. Oh no, you have curve also. Yeah, but yeah, no, it's nice, like 99% solidity. So yeah, don't bother with Viper. Or maybe only after you learn solidity, just for fun. You can check out Viper, but it's not the priority. Anup is asking are there good enough, good enough opportunities to make money in arbitrage and flash loan? Are you making money in arbitraging? No.
00:54:49.486 - 00:55:41.070, Speaker A: So me, myself, I'm not making money with flash loan arbitrage because it really requires a constant attention. It really requires you to tweak the parameters and follow this regularly. And unfortunately I don't really have the bandwidth to do this when you are like me and you publish three to four videos a week on your YouTube channel. Plus I have to also to create the courses in the backend to answer all the email, provide support to my students. I really have no free time for other stuff, but I would love to, but I have to make some choice. So are there good enough opportunities? And miners makes millions, even tens of millions a year. Miners, I mean arbitrary and liquidators, yeah, they make a lot of money, but yeah, it's not easy for sure.
00:55:41.070 - 00:56:03.160, Speaker A: It's competitive. Sick and tired is asking. Brandley has a new react cli coming out soon called braniac. It's similar to Angulara and Vue Cli. We'll let you know when we release it. Oh, okay, so you work for these guys? Okay, cool. Yeah, I wasn't aware of that.
00:56:03.160 - 00:56:30.800, Speaker A: Check it out. Forex shock. One hundred k a year is global. Lot of opportunities to make a lot more than 100k with these skills. Yeah, I mean, it really depends from which perspective you're talking from. Like if you're an engineer in the Silicon Valley, maybe 100k doesn't look so impressive. But for most people on the planet, 100k is pretty good already.
00:56:30.800 - 00:57:07.802, Speaker A: Yeah, you can make more than that. You can make a 100 and 5200 250. But me personally, I don't want to oversell dreams when I say that with my course you can get a job, blockchain job, paid one hundred k a year. I'm pretty confident you can do it. I could say, I know that some other people do this. Oh yeah, take my course and you're going to get paid 250k, for example. But the thing is, I don't feel comfortable saying that because really, now if you're talking of that two hundred k, two hundred and fifty k.
00:57:07.802 - 00:57:48.280, Speaker A: Now we are talking of guys who are a little bit more senior or maybe who have a very deep specialty in something like super strong in security or something like this. And I know it's not going to be all my students, maybe some of them will make it, but not all of them. So me, I prefer to give you a realistic figure. Of course it can go higher than that. Of course if you are specialized in something like security on DFI, for example, I have my course DFI development mastery, where basically we learn about DFI. So if you have this specialization, yeah, it can go above 100k. Yeah, for sure.
00:57:48.280 - 00:59:10.178, Speaker A: Jake, is it easier to get your first dev job at a startup, blockchain company or established company? Thinking of doing the 30 dev course once I finish another course, I mean. Yeah, so it's easier at a startup because you can talk directly to the founders or the person who you will work with. Whereas for established company usually they have a whole procedure there is like the HR, they're going to have some requirement and sometimes they make you pass some stupid test like some algorithm questions, some whiteboard thing that are absolutely not related to the task you actually have to do. You don't have any of this bullshit for startup. Okay, gashes, will you be starting shorts? You mean short selling in trading? No, I'm not really comfortable with short selling because the amount of money you can lose is Jake saying, hi, Julian. As far as hardware, do you use a laptop for a blockchain development? Any recommendation on brands, on gear that is helpful. So I'm currently using a MacBook Pro of 2015.
00:59:10.178 - 00:59:51.338, Speaker A: It's a big time favorite in the tech industry because it doesn't have the shitty butterfly keyboard that Mac introduced in. I think that was in 2016. You know, this very thin keyboard that is really not comfortable. So MacBook Pro 2015 still has the normal one, so that's good. However, it's heating up quite a lot. So this is something I don't like. So I was tempted to take the m one, the new cpu of Apple, but now they are going to release the M one x or M two with a MacBook Pro 16 inch.
00:59:51.338 - 01:00:16.342, Speaker A: So I'm probably going to wait for that. It's going to be probably in six months. But yeah, MacBook Pro are good. MacBook? Really? A lot of developers use MacBook Pro. Okay, Julian, you look tired. Take a rest and thank your time answering your question. No problem.
01:00:16.342 - 01:00:28.934, Speaker A: No, I'm fine, Nilesh, thanks for your time. Wish you health as you already have wealth. That's a good one. I love it. It's nice session on your behalf. Yeah, awesome. Nilesh.
01:00:28.934 - 01:01:00.406, Speaker A: Flavio. Hi Julian. How hard is it to find a remote blockchain job only with a personal project and previous non blockchain developer experience? Yeah, so it would be better if you already have some dev experience before, but it's not a blocker. You can still find something. It's still possible. Maybe it's going to be slightly longer, but still possible. One way you can sort of really force your way into the industry is by starting with freelance job.
01:01:00.406 - 01:01:50.294, Speaker A: In general, the requirements for freelance are always lower than for a full time job. So you can more easily get some experience with freelance. And then you add this to your cv. And so from there, when you apply to a full time job, then you have something a little bit more solid. But already with all the project we do in my course, six figure blockchain dev, especially the decentralized exchange, already with all of that, you're going to be pretty solid. There is a guy, one of a student, who took this course, and he did exactly what I said. I said you put this on your GitHub and basically he was contacted by a recruiter that saw the project on his GitHub and he was impressed by the project and he interviewed him and he hired him.
01:01:50.294 - 01:02:08.794, Speaker A: And I have an interview of this guy. Let me find it. Where this is. Let me see. Let me find this video for you. The testimonial. Oh yeah.
01:02:08.794 - 01:02:29.910, Speaker A: First blockchain job. Yes. So this guy here is exactly what he did. Put this on his GitHub and got a job. Okay. So I put the link here so you can check it out. Sig and tide.
01:02:29.910 - 01:02:40.226, Speaker A: I check out your code and it looks good. You know your stuff. You are giving the community a lot. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. Sick and tired. I appreciate gashes YouTube shorts.
01:02:40.226 - 01:03:16.740, Speaker A: I don't know what's to. It's a new feature of YouTube. It's like Instagram Stories. I never heard of that. John Peterson, what do you see as a new and upcoming project or space to pay attention to? Well, any layer two scaling solution needs to follow up with this. I like a yield optimizer that doing a cross blockchain stuff like basically like yield finance but across blockchain. I think that's super interesting.
01:03:16.740 - 01:03:57.200, Speaker A: I like things that mix defi and NFT, like NfTx that allow you to have a fractional ownership of an NFT. Yeah, but there's still probably many, many other things. But I'm just speaking from the top of my head here, Shadlik. I had a question about short selling also. When you short sell, do you have to use borrowed money? Do I have to leverage the exchange money or would it work the same using my own money or coin? No. So the idea with short selling. No, you don't need to borrow money.
01:03:57.200 - 01:04:28.150, Speaker A: You borrow a stock, then you wait for the stock to go down and then you resell it. But because the trade can also move in the opposite direction, which means you lose money in general. When you do short selling, you also have to post some collateral on the exchange. So before you do, you initiate the short sell. You will actually need to have some money. Yeah. So in an indirect way, you still need money to do short selling.
01:04:28.150 - 01:04:55.774, Speaker A: Darren saying standing up, we couldn't process your request at this time. Please try again later. Okay. Yeah, so I'm using Mailchimp. So sometimes they have these random errors. So either you can try again later or if you still have the problem, you can send me an email and I can add you manually to the list. So julian@idablocks.com.
01:04:55.774 - 01:05:47.054, Speaker A: Make sure to tell me which training you wanted to register for because I have many. Okay. Jake saying, wow, you are an Apple guy. I just hate how the Mac version of stuff like apps seems six weeks behind pc. Thank you for the. I mean, you know, there are always some inconvenient on Mac, but some disadvantages, but in general for development since most developers have Mac, all the tools for developers, first they work for Mac and after they make them work for Ubuntu for Windows. But generally the best support for developer tools will be for Mac.
01:05:47.054 - 01:06:10.314, Speaker A: So for me it's not even about religion or something like this, it's more about being practical. Sig and tide. I'm looking into AWS, cloud nine for my teams. I think it's great for open source and education, eliminates environment setup and gets people into code right away. Okay. Yeah, cool. Yeah, I saw some courses that were using this.
01:06:10.314 - 01:06:34.254, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe I should have a look about this interesting def data. Hey Flavio. Thanks Julian, you're awesome. Yeah, thanks Flavio. Def data. When can we expect ethereum transaction cost to go sub one dollars? Oh, it's not for now, not before a long time really. I think really it's when Ethereum 2.0
01:06:34.254 - 01:07:03.450, Speaker A: will be released. So I think we are talking of a few years. But in the meantime a lot of the industry is going to move to layer two scaling solution where the transaction cost will be quite cheap. Yeah, J Bam is saying, hey, do you have any tutorial on implementing governance in a protocol? Try looking in your vids. But didn't find anything. So on the course, defi development mastery. One of the tutorial is on Dao.
01:07:03.450 - 01:07:19.760, Speaker A: So let me find this. Defy development mastery. Let me put the link. Loading, loading, loading. Defy dev mastery. Okay. Yeah, you can check the curriculum here.
01:07:19.760 - 01:07:51.180, Speaker A: Okay. Jake Brady, are you going to mess around with Polygon software? Dev kit? Yes, I will probably do a tutorial on my channel, either on matic or on optimism. Yeah. Forex shark. I understand it's very good to lowball figures when selling courses. And you're speaking about working nine five type jobs and you can make a lot of money developing your own small project, token farms. Yeah, absolutely.
01:07:51.180 - 01:08:40.158, Speaker A: And in this space you can have investors faster than what you think. For example, I have friends who are doing startups in other industries and the guys constantly need to be the one who network with investor and they need to be introduced and they need to go to all these bars and then do all this effort to really get introduced. But what's amazing in blockchain is it's almost the other way around. It's almost investor who fight to get in touch with you. Really. So just by being in the space, if you start to have some social media presence and people start to follow you, you will find investors quite easily. And this is unique.
01:08:40.158 - 01:09:01.630, Speaker A: So we have to take advantage of it because it's not going to last forever. Godwin Forex shot creating a token is not the issue. The real challenge is getting use cases. Yes indeed. Sig and tired with cloud nine. My daughter is programming on her iPad and Chromebook. It's awesome and removes high cost of laptop.
01:09:01.630 - 01:09:53.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I never thought it that way. Yeah, interesting. Godwin small project and farm seems to be more profitable. However, the dev process is also not a work in the I mean you can reuse some of the code of yon finance, that's kind of a template in the industry. But ultimately you also want to add your own personal touch of it's development in general always takes a lot of time. So that's why rapidly, once you have some traction, you need to get some investors. It's totally unrealistic to think like, oh, you're going to have a main job and on the side you're going to do your little software project and you're going to do this for years until you make money.
01:09:53.394 - 01:10:40.686, Speaker A: No, at some point you need to make the switch and to say, okay, now we're going to raise money for my side project. Hey Batman. Hey, we have forex shark. When dev new project, I just follow hot trend and try to be second or third with whatever the hot new thing is. All right guys, well, I think this is it. So quick reminder for people who arrive late.
