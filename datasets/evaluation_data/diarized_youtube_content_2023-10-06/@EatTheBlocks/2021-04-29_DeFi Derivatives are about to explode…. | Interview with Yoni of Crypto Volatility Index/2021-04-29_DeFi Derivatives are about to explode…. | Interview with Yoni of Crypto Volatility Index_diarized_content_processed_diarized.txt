00:00:00.330 - 00:00:09.258, Speaker A: Hi, guys. Today we are receiving Yoni of the Crypto volatility index, a new crypto project that brings derivative to Defi. Welcome, Yoni.
00:00:09.354 - 00:00:10.910, Speaker B: Hi, Julian. Hi, guys.
00:00:10.980 - 00:00:15.770, Speaker A: Yeah, very happy to have you. So can you first briefly introduce yourself, Yoni?
00:00:15.850 - 00:00:58.570, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm a software engineer and have an MSc in computer science. In the last decade, I've been building financial applications. I previously led a team of engineers at the risk management department of UMTB, which is an israeli bank, and later on had a startup of my own in the field of algorithmic trading. And I've always been captivated by the financial market and what makes them tick. And I think it was in late 2017, I started reading about bitcoin, Ethereum. It was literally mind blowing. The dynamics of proof of work and proof of stake, the different pros and cons between different approaches.
00:00:58.570 - 00:01:22.550, Speaker B: It was a new level of the same ingredients that I love about the financial market. So I had to basically read everything I can about Ethereum and bitcoin and immediately started learning solidity and trying out some code. So right at that time, I heard about Coty, which I joined after a few months, and I've been working here ever since.
00:01:22.700 - 00:01:54.946, Speaker A: Wow. Your story reminds me of my story because I also used to work on finance, in finance, and then I switched to development. So, yeah, that kind of profile, of course, is super attractive for the defi industry. And like you, when I heard about blockchain for months and months, it's all I could think about. I think we're a lot like this. And so you work for this big company called Coty, and one of their project is crypto volatility index. So can you tell us more about this new project?
00:01:55.128 - 00:02:52.942, Speaker B: Yeah, so basically it was, I think, June last year at Coti. We were looking at how DeFi is rising, and we're very excited about the possibilities it opens up and the new products that can be built. And in general, in Coti, we have a very pragmatic approach. We really aim to solve real business needs and something that is really useful. And we are thinking, what can we do in this segment that relates to Koti's mission and some kind of maybe a hedging tool for merchants that use Koti. And then Neil Halwani, which is Koti's cto, he said, why don't we build a decentralized version of the VIX of the volatility index of the S and P 500? Can be a very interesting hedging tool. And we are all like, immediately.
00:02:52.942 - 00:03:24.858, Speaker B: Definitely that can be so useful. And also, looking at DeFi at that time, because right before DeFi summer, we saw that there is absolutely nothing in the derivative segment. So the industry could really benefit the industry. And ever since then, we've been building the protocol, and it's actually live on Ethereum mainet since January and expanding very fast, gaining a lot of traction since then.
00:03:25.024 - 00:03:55.000, Speaker A: Okay, excuse me, I'll stop you quickly. So for people who never heard of the VIX index, so that's the famous volatility index on the SNP 500, also called the fear index. So when the markets are very volatile, which means the price change quickly, this index goes up, and conversely, it goes down when the market is very stable. Can you tell us in DFI, who would be interested in an index like this?
00:03:55.450 - 00:04:15.360, Speaker B: Yeah. So in DeFi, as you know, volatility is a very big issue, even much more so than in regular financial markets. So it can benefit anyone that is looking to hedge themselves from volatility or profit from volatility, take trades related to it.
00:04:16.290 - 00:04:34.698, Speaker A: Okay, so there are two sides of the market. People who buy volatility, people who sell it. So typically, would it be a retail investor who sell or buy volatility, like what kind of actor and how practically they would use your index.
00:04:34.894 - 00:05:19.300, Speaker B: Yeah. So I would say there are basically two ways to use it, and each is suitable for a different market participant. So one way is to open a position on the volatility index if you're expecting the market to be volatile. So when volatility occurs, the index will rise and position holders will benefit. So we just had a very interesting example just now with the coinbase listing last week, I think. And it was regarded in advance as a significant event, very significant event for the crypto market. So right before the listing, the CVI index began to rise as the market was expecting volatility to increase around this event.
00:05:19.300 - 00:06:17.410, Speaker B: A possible trade in this case was to buy the index before the listing. Another possibility to profit, or to profit, is to invest in a different defi instrument and use the CVI as a tool to hedge against market volatility. So in case the market would be volatile both to the upwards or downwards, the CVI would rise. And this can be very beneficial, for example, for liquidity providers of certain pairs on uniswap, as it can serve as a hedge for what's called impermanent loss. So opening a position in CVI is suitable for anyone that expects the market to be volatile, and both as a hedging tool against volatility. Now, on the other side, it's possible to provide liquidity to our platform. So we have a platform that allows you to take trades on the CVI index.
00:06:17.410 - 00:06:42.370, Speaker B: And as with every market, there are two sides. You have volatility sellers and volatility buyers. As in regular financial markets, you have many institutional players and funds that are selling options. Some of them are buying options for hedging. So in CVI, we have liquidity providers. That's the other side. They are the volatility sellers.
00:06:42.370 - 00:07:14.710, Speaker B: So as time passes by, liquidity providers receive funding fees from the volatility buyers. This compensates them for the risk they incur for covering any profits of the volatility buyers. This is how the market reaches balance between the two sides. So if the index drops in value, the equity providers gain a profit. And also if it stays in place for a long period of time without moving, they also profit as they receive a funding fee paid by the volatility buyers.
00:07:16.010 - 00:07:29.126, Speaker A: Okay, so practically, if I want to bet that the volatility is going to rise, can I just buy the index? So is it just a token of some decentralized exchange or is it slightly more complex?
00:07:29.318 - 00:08:11.900, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's a great question. Right now, in the last three months, it's running as a platform that you can access the platform and open a position that would have, in that way you can be long on the index. And we're going to have working right now, going to have a version two coming up later this quarter. That would make things even better, that you would have different kinds of ways to do it and something that's been working on, and there will be different uxs that allows you to do it. Some will be very easy for those that don't want to go to a platform and open a position.
00:08:13.230 - 00:08:20.670, Speaker A: And in terms of potential returns and risk, how would you compare this with just owning a defi token?
00:08:21.970 - 00:08:25.680, Speaker B: Yeah, so my cat is here coming.
00:08:26.450 - 00:08:27.440, Speaker A: No problem.
00:08:30.370 - 00:08:31.680, Speaker B: Put her here.
00:08:38.230 - 00:08:40.210, Speaker A: It's the joy of working from home.
00:08:40.360 - 00:08:41.060, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:44.550 - 00:08:55.350, Speaker A: So I was asking you, how would you compare the risk and returns of, for example, buying volatility versus just trading a defi token?
00:08:56.090 - 00:09:25.540, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's a very interesting concept that you can use it as a hedging tool. So I would say the best thing to do is to regard it as part of your overall portfolio. How is this investment, how does it fit in? If it's something that you would like to take a short term bet on volatility, maybe you would take a short term position. If it's a hedging tool, you can fit it to cover any possible losses you would have if there would be a volatile market.
00:09:26.150 - 00:09:36.840, Speaker A: And out of these two use case like either speculation or coverage for other position, which one do you think will be the biggest use case?
00:09:38.170 - 00:10:02.480, Speaker B: Basically, as I see it, the whole derivative segment right now in Defi, it's quite unbelievable that we've been past defi summer and defi winter, and a lot of the industry is expanding so rapidly and the whole derivatives market is not there yet. It's like we're so early on. So I would say there are so many ways you can use.
00:10:05.810 - 00:10:29.000, Speaker A: Because I think so far with defi we haven't seen anything. We've seen a big growth, but this can be totally dwarf by a derivative defi, which in traditional finance is much bigger than the cash market. So do you think maybe in the next few months we'll have a huge influx of money in DeFi with all these derivatives project?
00:10:30.090 - 00:10:55.520, Speaker B: I think we're already there. We're seeing the traction that we have in the last few months and we're seeing vcs entering this area, a lot of investments going on. But I would say if you look at the users of the platform and users of volatility, buyers and sellers. 1 second. My cat here is.
00:10:57.970 - 00:11:26.438, Speaker A: That's all good. Hi, the cat. Wow, it's very fluffy. Yeah, he wants to be on YouTube as well. Do you think this is going to be a big market? So right now the website I use to measure what's happening in DeFi is Defi pulse, but I feel like maybe we need another Defi pulse but for derivative stuff. But it doesn't exist yet. I don't think so.
00:11:26.604 - 00:12:08.760, Speaker B: That's actually a great idea. I think we would definitely need that with all the traction that's going on. I was seeing a lot of interest in derivatives and I can tell you as a like developing in DeFi is so exciting. There are so many opportunities, so many things to build. It's quite remarkable that in the segment that we're in and CVI, the derivative segment, it feels like one and a half years ago. It's like so early on and we're seeing a lot of institutional prayers, a lot of vcs coming in and we'd like everyone to get interested in it. So everyone already into it.
00:12:09.290 - 00:12:27.260, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm super excited about this new part of the DeFi adventure. And can you give us some technical details of how your volatility index work with the smart contract? I guess there are some mean my audience, they finally super interested in this.
00:12:27.950 - 00:12:58.562, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So we are partners with Chainlink. So we built what's called an external adapter, which is code that is run by chainlink nodes and is aggregated by different oracles on chain. And the external adapter, what it does, basically it calculates the index, and then the index is sent on chain via chaining protocols, and it's the feed that powers our platform.
00:12:58.696 - 00:13:45.822, Speaker A: Okay, so use chain link external adapters. And so I understand that the heavy lifting for the calculation of the index is done outside of the blockchain and imported through Oracle, which simplified things a lot, because in solidity this is such a primitive language, it'd be much more challenging to do all these computations. So I think it's quite smart to do all of this computation off chain. It seems like in terms of smart contract, it's not as complicated as I thought, because basically the heavy lifting is done outside of the blockchain and then boom, you import the index and that's it. So after it's more about how you can create some layers so that people can buy and sell this index simply.
00:13:45.966 - 00:14:24.530, Speaker B: Yeah, so the first part was building the code that is sensitive on chain. So that's also, it has a lot of elements to it. What sources would you take and how would the calculation be done? There are different ways to calculate it, and it's all actually open source. You can have a look at chaining suppository. There are different ways to use different sources in that regard. And a lot of the heavy lifting and solidity side on the blockchain is creating the platform. So now you have an index and you want to trade it.
00:14:24.530 - 00:14:49.980, Speaker B: And when you have a tradable instrument, the market would never be in balance. So creating a balanced market in terms of supply and demand for any instrument and a synthetic product is quite complex, especially for volatility. So if you look at our code, it's like we have a lot of infrastructure that is targeting how to do this best.
00:14:51.070 - 00:15:00.380, Speaker A: And since everything is more complex, maybe more custom, would you guys see any use for NFT for representing some position?
00:15:01.010 - 00:15:35.058, Speaker B: Definitely. It's something we thought about, actually. We're seeing so many products that we can build on the platform and on the tech that we built, which actually became quite complex. You can have a look at our GitHub and see the code. It's very robust. So while building it, we were seeing, okay, this can be used for many more products related to volatility, and NFT could be one, but there are others that we're currently working on which will be part of our v two that will come later this quarter.
00:15:35.154 - 00:16:04.478, Speaker A: I think one very important question for you guys is whether you want to build a protocol that is used by end user directly or if you want to be more of a sort of back end that is used by other project. Because for example, this could be the back end for some insurance protocol that are a little bit higher level, some protocol that say okay, I'm going to provide you some insurance for implementing loss and you provide this. Have you thought of this sort of positioning?
00:16:04.654 - 00:16:11.854, Speaker B: Definitely. We're also in touch with some projects in this regard and it can be a perfect fit for those projects.
00:16:11.982 - 00:16:20.726, Speaker A: Yeah, well this is super exciting. I really love your project and I think that you guys are looking to hire some developers, right?
00:16:20.828 - 00:16:49.226, Speaker B: Yeah. So as we're expanding and seeing our development pipeline is so packed with a lot of features and we're actually recruiting developers, interviewing new developers every day on our local site. And we're also open up to offshore developers. So I know your channel, have a lot of views that are developers. You can surely reach out to us on discord and our Telegram group. Okay, so I'll put all the links.
00:16:49.258 - 00:17:19.670, Speaker A: To your project in the description down below if some people are interested. But I'm telling you, this is the future of Defi that is being built. Derivatives in Defi. This is the next big thing and this is going to be much bigger than what we have now in Defi. So yeah, if you are into finance and programming, this is for you. Thanks Yoni, that was super interesting and I wish you good luck for crypto volatility index.
00:17:20.570 - 00:17:22.978, Speaker B: Thank you. Thanks guys. Bye.
