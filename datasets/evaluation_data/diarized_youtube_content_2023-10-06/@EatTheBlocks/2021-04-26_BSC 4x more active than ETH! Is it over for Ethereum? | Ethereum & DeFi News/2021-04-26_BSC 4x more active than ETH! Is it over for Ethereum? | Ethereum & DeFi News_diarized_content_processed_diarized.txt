00:00:06.330 - 00:00:37.218, Speaker A: You and we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and defy. I do this every Monday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. If you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host, and on either blogs I teach blockchain development. So quick reminder for those who haven't followed the previous livestream, I'm launching a new tokens for either blocks. With this token you will be able to vote for the content on YouTube.
00:00:37.218 - 00:01:32.162, Speaker A: And this token is absolutely free. I'm giving it in an airdrop so you have to first register before April 30. So you only have a few days left to register. So I put the link in the description, but make sure to register because really this is some free token. And so for now we're just going to vote with this token, but in the future they're going to be some other features that will be added. And second thing is I'm going to do a webinar for basically hiring people on a freelance basis, mainly. So eddoblocks is growing fast and basically I want to hire teachers in order to create more blockchain courses.
00:01:32.162 - 00:02:18.994, Speaker A: So I'm going to do a webinar for this. And so this is going to be outside of YouTube. This is going to be this week, Thursday, April 29 at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. So it will be late here in Asia, but it will be beginning of afternoon in Europe and morning in America. So if you think you are interested in this teaching blockchain courses, or if you have some skills in social media, ads, marketing, or if you have an audience already and you want to become an affiliate of the course of it, the blocks come attend this webinar. So I'm going to put also the link in the description.
00:02:18.994 - 00:02:52.110, Speaker A: So let me know if you can see the link because sometimes YouTube is weird and just doesn't show my links. So hi everybody. Hi Nora onshen crypto Mikhail MP TsHX Iodeji Azartis Low Q well, many people. Awesome. Okay, we are going to start with ether. How are we doing on ether this week? So it was a very volatile week. We started badly, almost going below $2,000 before a huge rebound.
00:02:52.110 - 00:03:37.866, Speaker A: We reached a New all time high above $2,600. After that we came back down again and now we up. So it's really volatile this week, maybe $3,000 this week. I don't know, it's just so volatile. All right, next, talking of the price of ether, I found this interesting article of Arthur Hayes, who is the ex CEO of Bitmex, one of the biggest exchange for crypto derivatives. And he wrote an article to explain why he is very bullish for Ethereum. So based on price revenue models, he believed that Ethereum is very undervalued.
00:03:37.866 - 00:04:28.400, Speaker A: So he made a few calculations and estimated that if Defi on Ethereum only captures 0.1% of the banking industry, one ether could be equal to $4,000. So this is completely doable in the short term. And if DeFi and Ethereum capture 50% of the banking market, of the banking industry, one ether would be worth $2 million. And if Ethereum ever captured the entire banking industry, which probably never happened at this .1 ether in this case would be worth $4 million. But even without going to such extreme, we can see that even in the low valuation, Ethereum could be worse in the tens of thousands of dollars.
00:04:28.400 - 00:05:02.762, Speaker A: And for more context, Arthur Hayes is a big bitcoin maximalist. I think if I'm not mistaken, he wrote an article saying how ether was bullshit a few years ago. So you see that a lot of people are changing their mind. All right, so next, let's talk about gas. So, yeah, recently gas has improved a lot. Like you can see we have a big, big drop here. We haven't seen this since a few months.
00:05:02.762 - 00:05:53.450, Speaker A: Last time it was sometime in November. So this is largely due to something that is called flashbots that basically enable to have all the front runner, all the liquidators do their gas auction outside of the blockchain in a more efficient way. And so everybody can benefit from this improvement. So next, let's talk of the market cap in Defi. So we have reached a new all time high this week, but because of the fall of the price of ether, so now we are back to only $60 billion. But yeah, we can see that probably the next few months we're going to hit $100 billion. So it start to be really exciting.
00:05:53.450 - 00:06:21.074, Speaker A: Next for the top defi coins. So let's see what's the performance for the last week. So alpaca, which is a leverage yield farm on finance. Marching awesome performance here. Pancake swap, who had record volume up 50%. Really amazing compound, doing really well. Maker that had very important vote this week.
00:06:21.074 - 00:06:52.090, Speaker A: We're going to talk about this after. So it's doing well. Uni also is doing well. And then let's see the losers. Not so many loser this week. And what do we have? Badger Daos who is bringing bitcoin to Ethereum. Defi then we have loop ring, which is an L two Dex keeper saffron finance, which always is very volatile.
00:06:52.090 - 00:07:27.898, Speaker A: One week up, one week down. Yeah, but not so many loser this week. Okay, so let's move on to the news for Defi project. And we're going to start with balancer. So balancer is going to just release its v two on main net, so developers can use the new smart contract right away. And for the front end interface, it will be released on April 20 eigth. So that's one of the advantage of being a developer, you don't need to wait for the front end.
00:07:27.898 - 00:08:11.190, Speaker A: So the biggest difference when we compare balancer v one with v two is that all the money of v two will be in a single vault. And this allows a big gas saving compared to v one. And this new version will also allow people to customize the logic of liquidity pools. So for example, it will be possible to create a pool that reinvest the liquidity in a lending protocol to boost the yield that is paid to liquidity provider. So the goal of balancer is very ambitious. They want to be the go to platforms for developers, traders and liquidity providers. In other words, they pretty much want to become the new Uniswap.
00:08:11.190 - 00:09:09.260, Speaker A: And talking of Uniswap, it sets a new record last week with $10 billion traded over the week. So that means more money for liquidity providers of Uniswap. I haven't checked recently, but I'm pretty sure the ROI as an LP on Uniswap, depending on the pool, it can reach like 2030, 40% easy. Next, some news from synthetics. So synthetics is adding stocks to its list of synthetic assets. So we will have synthetic stocks for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and these will all be available as token on Ethereum. It means you will be able to buy these tokens on the blockchain even without any brokerage account.
00:09:09.260 - 00:09:57.066, Speaker A: The Synthetix DAO is going to give some incentive to liquidity provider of these pools for the next five weeks. So you're going to earn some extra income if you lp for these tokens. It's very important to incentivize these lps because stocks only trade during a part of the day. So if we want LP to keep their liquidity even outside of the trading hour, we need to give them some incentive. It also means that it's not possible for anyone to trade stocks even outside of the normal trading hours. So this will make trading stocks on DeFi superior to trading stock on the stock exchange. Because stock prices and synthetics can react to events in real time, even outside of the market hours.
00:09:57.066 - 00:10:35.666, Speaker A: So we might even see the open price of stocks on stock exchange. We might see this price be influenced by the price of synthetic stocks on Ethereum. It also opened up the possibility of new arbitrage between the synthetic stocks on blockchain and the actual stocks on stock market. A couple of months ago, I predicted that we would have stocks on the blockchain soon. This is already happening. I didn't think it would come this fast. And this signals the start of a major shift in the power dynamics between DeFi and centralized finance.
00:10:35.666 - 00:11:36.980, Speaker A: This is only the beginning, and in the future, you can expect to have more and more liquidity from centralized finance, which is going to be sucked into Ethereum and DeFi. So these new synthetics token allow a new category of Defi apps, such as the WallStreetBet Dap. So, yes, WallStreetBet is coming to crypto. So after becoming mainstream earlier this year, the Reddit community of stock investors is coming to the blockchain. So they have released a DAP to allow you to invest in a basket of stocks, but from the blockchain, and they are using the synthetics protocol to get some synthetic stocks on the blockchain. So they have distributed their token in an Ido, which is short for initial Dex offering. So this is basically an ICO and a listing on an exchange, but happening at the same time.
00:11:36.980 - 00:12:22.400, Speaker A: And they have used BSC starter for their token launch, which is a launch pad on binance smart chain. So following the launch of this DAP crypto discussion were finally allowed on the subreddit of Wall street bet, because before it was forbidden. So, yeah, clearly they can see that there is this huge overlap between the community of Wall street bets and the crypto community. So I think it really makes sense for them to open up the discussion then the Naos finance. So this is a new DeFi project for lending and borrowing. They just raised $5.1 million.
00:12:22.400 - 00:13:08.796, Speaker A: So what makes NAws Finance special is that you will be able to use real world asset as a collateral to borrow money on the blockchain. So it's one more project that connects real world to the blockchain. So it really seems to be a new trend. We see more and more projects like this, and I saw on the page that they have Mr. Block as an advisor, so he's someone famous in the crypto community here in Taiwan, and they also have some article written in Chinese. I'm pretty sure that these guys are based in Taiwan? I need to check, but yeah, the crypto community here in Taiwan is pretty good actually. Next, some news from Maker.
00:13:08.796 - 00:14:08.532, Speaker A: So maker, the company behind the Dai stablecoin, is considering accepting real world assets as collateral to mint new Dai tokens. So the first two real world assets to be accepted will be supply chain invoices and musician future royalty streams. Maker would work with two companies for this console fright platform for supply chain finance and paperchain, which makes musician royalty payments from Spotify instantly available. So this would only be the beginning. And after, there would be gradually more and more real world assets accepted by Maker, like maybe real estate, who knows? So this would be decided with a vote by the maker community. So real world coming to blockchain. This is really how blockchain will conceive the world.
00:14:08.532 - 00:14:58.132, Speaker A: So super exciting still from maker. Another news, so very important news from Maker. So there is an upcoming vote to update the liquidation mechanism. So there are a lot of changes, but the most important, most important is that they're going to accept partial bids. So that means you can submit a bid of any size for the liquidation, whereas before you needed to submit a bid in a lot of 50,000 die, which obviously was in favor of wealth. And the new liquidation mechanism will also have a support for flash loan, which means you won't need any capital at all, except to cover the transaction fees. That's it.
00:14:58.132 - 00:15:50.740, Speaker A: But to reimburse the loan itself, you could use a flash loan, probably natively, I guess so, yeah, it will be easier for everybody to do some liquidation. So potentially some nice opportunity here for liquidators. Next, some news from Ave. So Ave has just launched on Polygon, which is one of the leading l two chain for Ethereum, and the launch was a very successful transaction, exploded by more than 2000%. The transaction volume grew already to $250,000,000. So it's still way less than Ave on l one ethereum, but probably that soon we will have a flippening and Ave on Polygon will have more activity than Ave on Ethereum. L one, it's totally possible.
00:15:50.740 - 00:16:50.644, Speaker A: So Ave is one of the main protocol on Ethereum, creator of the flash on concept, one of the leading lending protocol. So it's really significant to see Ave successfully migrating to Polygon, and there is a liquidity mining program of polygon that gives $40 million of their token to lenders and borrowers of Ave. So that's 1% of the total supply of the Matic token, the native token of Polygon, talking of Polygon. So the total value locked is going up very fast. It was only $5 million when Polygon launched in October last year, and as you can see, it will soon reach $1 billion. So personally, I'm very bullish on Matic, the token of polygon. In the future, Matic could capture a lot of the value currently in some Ethereum killers like binance smart chain.
00:16:50.644 - 00:17:26.960, Speaker A: So if you want to see the potential of matic, you can compare it with the market cap of binance smart chain. For example, one day the market cap of polygon could be the market cap of binance marching. Yeah, it's really not impossible at all. Then some news from ample force. So this is an algorithmic stable coin and it's one of the first one, if not the first one, I believe. And they are releasing their governance token fourth. So it's going to be airdrop to their users.
00:17:26.960 - 00:18:03.004, Speaker A: So if you have used ample force before, you can enjoy your gift then some news from Alpha Homera. So Alpha Homera V two was just relaunched. So Alpha home era is a leverage yield farming protocol on Ethereum. Their V two was launched for the first time earlier this year, but it was hacked in what was one of the largest exploit of all time. In total, they were stolen $37 million. Yeah, it hurts. So now with this new release, hopefully everything has been fixed.
00:18:03.004 - 00:18:24.640, Speaker A: But be careful because this project is leverage yield farming. So leverage, it's risky. Yield farming, it's risky. So you compound two risk at the same time. So it's very risky. Then some news from pancake swap. So pancake swap alone became bigger than Ethereum.
00:18:24.640 - 00:18:59.692, Speaker A: In the past 24 hours, the number of transactions happening on pancake swap has been more than the entire Ethereum network combined. So it was 2 million transactions for pancake swap and 1.55 million for Ethereum. And one of the reason of the increase could be the surge in interest for safe moon. So safe moon is a token listed on binance smart chain. It's a new kind of token that basically charge fee every time someone transferred a token. I believe they also do some native yield farming.
00:18:59.692 - 00:19:35.512, Speaker A: So yeah, now everybody is talking about safemoon. And so that's a big reason why pancake swap is going so nuts. Right, next, so with all this hot project on binance smart chain, the binance marching itself is breaking new records. So in the last 24 hours, there were 6 million transactions on finance marching to compare with 1.55 million on Ethereum. Next use from this new project. NFTB.
00:19:35.512 - 00:20:06.032, Speaker A: So NFT is coming to Binance March. NFTB. This is a new NFT project, and they just raised $100 million from the Finance March and Ecosystem fund. So that's a huge sum of money, especially for such a new project, 100 million. Oh my God. So finance has some really deep pockets, and if you have a good idea, they won't hesitate to fund it. So this new project, NFTB, is a decentralized marketplace for NFT.
00:20:06.032 - 00:20:59.860, Speaker A: So you can mint, sell, buy and swap nfts at a fraction of the cost and at a fraction of the speed of other NFT platform on Ethereum. So it will cost between ten to 1000 less to mint NFT compared to Ethereum based platform like rarible. So I think this has really a lot of potential because really the big selling point of binance merchant is that it's cheaper. And cheaper is especially important for then we're going to talk of binance. So binance, which is the biggest centralized crypto exchange in the world in front of coinbase. Binance is going to offer tokenized stocks for the big stocks like Microsoft or Apple. So it's once again real world coming to blockchain.
00:20:59.860 - 00:21:45.920, Speaker A: This is coming at the same time as Synthetix announced they will offer something similar. So I wouldn't be surprised if very soon a large part of the stock trading industry moves on Shen, at least for the retail investors. So long term, I think it's going to be hard for companies like Robin Hood to compete with this, because really on chain stock trading will be superior to off chain stock trading. Then some news from tether, the stable coin. So tether just passed $50 billion of market cap. It has more than double since the beginning of the year. So the recent increase was helped by Coinbase Pro, which announced they will list tether.
00:21:45.920 - 00:22:28.180, Speaker A: So I'm happy to see the ecosystem finally trusting tether again after all the drama we heard before. Tether is really a central part of the crypto ecosystem. And even though nobody likes that, they are so centralized, we do need tether. So at some point in the future, when the decentralized algorithmic stablecoin like ample force, when this coin will start to work, they will probably replace tether, or at least complement it a lot. But we are still very far from this point. Then news from a company called securrency. So this is a crypto company that has just raised $30 million from banks in the US.
00:22:28.180 - 00:23:13.760, Speaker A: So they are providing compliance software to enterprise customer to support issuance, exchange administration and servicing of digital assets. So I know it sounds very boring, but it's actually super important. So big companies are always much more at risk to be sued if they are not perfectly compliant with regulations. So that's why they are always very cautious about respecting all the regulation. They prefer to miss business opportunities than risking to be sued. And yes, that's really one of the compliance is one of the main obstacles for these big companies to get into crypto. So companies like securrency, they will allow to build the infrastructure necessary for these big companies to get into crypto.
00:23:13.760 - 00:24:00.240, Speaker A: Then, some super exciting news from Wyoming. So a couple of weeks ago, I was discussing that in Wyoming, they were discussing a bill to allow daos to become legal entities. So the law was finally voted and will become effective July 1 this year. So this means in the future, it will be standout for daos to incorporate in Wyoming exactly like companies incorporate in Delaware. So daos will be created no matter what, and they will give their money to the most accommodating legislation. And so Wyoming saw this, and they are going to collect a nice paycheck. This is really easy money for the government.
00:24:00.240 - 00:24:45.520, Speaker A: They just have to be the first one. And for the other government that are just too slow, are not paying attention, they are not going to get any of this money. So this is really an example showing how crypto regulation makes more money for government, not less money. And for daos, of course, this is amazing. And once we have this, maybe we'll start to see some big companies that start to think about Dao, because now it's tied to a legal framework, and big companies want this. So, yeah, potentially after this, we'll start to see a huge development of Dao. So we're going to have Defi NFT and maybe a new, a big niche in blockchain, which will be Dao.
00:24:45.520 - 00:25:35.884, Speaker A: Then we're going to talk of bitcoin. So what's happening on bitcoin this week? So, Ethereum and other crypto had pretty good week, but bitcoin is still struggling, and the bitcoin dominance ratio is at its lowest since 2018. So that's really a proof that the bitcoin season and altcoin season theory is correct. Currently, people are rotating the assets from bitcoin to Ethereum to DeFi and to other altcoins. Then talking of bitcoin. So there was another application for a bitcoin ETF that was just filed in New York. So everybody believed that we are just a few months away from the first bitcoin ETF.
00:25:35.884 - 00:26:14.840, Speaker A: And that would be, of course, a huge boost, not only for bitcoin, but for the crypto community in general. So I quote the article, the SEC has rejected every bitcoin ETF application. But Gary Gensler, the SEC new chairman, could change the regulatory attitude to the novel investment product. Gensler is a former commodity futures trading commission. So that's the CFTC. He's a former CFTC chairman who taught crypto and blockchain courses at Massachuteset Institute of Technology. So basically this guy, he was eat the blocks but for the MIT.
00:26:14.840 - 00:26:56.724, Speaker A: And so now he's the head of the. And so there is a really high chance that we're going to get this first ETF that is approved. So yeah, expect a huge boost in the market sometime this summer. So next, some news from Morgan. So JPMorgan is planning to offer an actively managed bitcoin fund to some clients from this summer. So that's very significant because not so long ago, James diamond, so this guy, the CEO of JPMorgan, he was saying that Bitcoin was a scam, blah blah blah. So now they are totally changing their attitude.
00:26:56.724 - 00:27:32.512, Speaker A: So yeah, they do learn. We just need to give them some time. Okay, so next, some news from the NFL. So a player of the Kansas City team will take his entire salary of $920,000 will take his entire salary in bitcoin. So while I would personally prefer to get my salary in ether, it's always great for mainstream adoption when we have these famous people that make announcement like this. So it's good. Next, some news from developers.
00:27:32.512 - 00:28:11.840, Speaker A: So news from Remix, the online IDE for solidity, the programming language for smart contract. So remix is now available as a plugin for Vs code. So it has exactly the same feature as the web version of remix, except you don't need to leave your code editor, so it's much more convenient. Yeah. Then quickly wanted to mention this new product from a block native. So this is a simulation platform. This allow you to simulate transaction against the mem pool.
00:28:11.840 - 00:28:56.140, Speaker A: So this is very useful if you want to do arbitrage, liquidations, et cetera. Before, if you wanted to simulate transaction against the mempool, it was a little bit more technical, but using their tool you can do it much more easily. And very importantly they have worked very hard on the latency. So basically that means you can do your simulation really quickly and if you find some opportunity you can act on it very fast. Okay, so next we're going to do the q and a. So before quickly I'm going to remind you of the two important links this week. So first, the airdrop for the ether blocks token.
00:28:56.140 - 00:29:41.150, Speaker A: If you haven't yet registered for the airdrop, register now. You have until April 30. This is totally free to register for the airdrop, so really don't waste an opportunity. And second, for people who want to work with so either blogs is hiring teachers to create blockchain courses, some people in marketing, social media ads. And also you can work as an affiliate if you already have an audience. And basically you can make money by having affiliate links to my courses. So if you are interested in all of this, register for the webinar that I'm going to do this Thursday this week.
00:29:41.150 - 00:30:15.876, Speaker A: So April 29 at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight and we will discuss in more details how you can work with it. The block so personally, my career in blockchain just grew up so much after I started to teach some blockchain courses. So for me it was really a fantastic boost. And so now you have a way to do it much more easily than I did, because when I started I had no audience at all. But now you can leverage the audience off it, the blocks, to launch your own blockchain course. So yeah, register for this webinar.
00:30:15.876 - 00:30:39.792, Speaker A: This is going to be super interesting. Okay, so now I'm going to scroll up a little bit and see all the message. Wow, we have a lot today. Okay, so what do we have? Ayodeji good to be here today. Nora onshen eat the blocks token to the moon. Azertiz is telling me in French. Hi, thanks for your work.
00:30:39.792 - 00:30:53.232, Speaker A: Thanks, man. Loy Q hi, bro. Love you. Love your content. Thank you. Jake breeding what's good, Julian? Hey man. Edwin hi, Ms.
00:30:53.232 - 00:31:06.548, Speaker A: Hacker. Three to one you say everyone name and not my name. I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry. Hi, man. Sometimes I go a little bit too fast. Nihon is saying in French. Incredible that you are french.
00:31:06.548 - 00:31:26.930, Speaker A: Yes, I do. Loy Q is saying, I want ether at 1.5k. What? No way, man. No way. Jake breeding gas has really improved on east recently. And then polygon taking up some slack. Things are looking great, right? Yes, yes.
00:31:26.930 - 00:31:54.612, Speaker A: John Devila what about art token? Oh yeah. This week I didn't have any news about NFT, but I often do. I often do. Russell Brooks. How can you stake on east without getting wrecked on gas fees? You can use a staking pool like anchor. Yeah, basically you use a centralized solution and they do the staking for you. But you will have to pay the transaction fee to send them your east.
00:31:54.612 - 00:32:18.252, Speaker A: You have no choice, but just a simple ether transfer is still reasonable. Thomas de Bouver says CrV. CRV at CRV token. I didn't follow the news of curve this week, but I believe they have something new. But I forgot. Russell Brooks. I will probably do pancake.
00:32:18.252 - 00:32:41.000, Speaker A: I don't know what you mean. Look, you. Do you know any flash on opportunity on binance smart chain? Yeah, I did a video about this, actually. For example, there are two decks that are cloned off uniswap. You have bakery swap, you have pancake swap. So you can monitor the price differences on these two and use a flash loan to make money. So, yeah, do a quick search on my channel.
00:32:41.000 - 00:32:53.996, Speaker A: You'll find this video. It was probably a few weeks ago. Abracadabra. Polygon is matic. Yes, there was a rebranding. Russell Brooks. I have a small portfolio, so if gas is such high proportion, it's not worth it.
00:32:53.996 - 00:33:16.420, Speaker A: Yeah, so in this case, you can change to binance smart chain, and the fees are much more reasonable. You can also start to look at Polygon now you start to have some traction. Abracadabra, Russell. So use onxvolt. It will save you gas and yield for eth. Okay, I didn't know onxvolt. Need to check that.
00:33:16.420 - 00:33:39.700, Speaker A: Jack. Breeding easyfi is like the opposite of Ave right now. Hopefully things get worked out. I haven't followed. What is easyfi? Judging by the name of it, it looks like one of these centralized lending protocol, like a blockfi, maybe. Louie Q says easyfi CEO scam people. Okay, well, I know nothing about that.
00:33:39.700 - 00:34:02.880, Speaker A: Maybe abracadabra. Binance smart chain is full of scam. Yeah, a lot of scam on binance smart chain, so you got to be careful, okay? Abracadabra. Say pancake v two will burn much more cake token now. So that's bullish. Okay. I wasn't even aware they were about to release their v two.
00:34:02.880 - 00:34:18.276, Speaker A: Interesting. Paris, Nas. Hi, man. How are you? Hey, Jake breeding easyfi was trying to do some interesting things. We'll see how transparent they will be about everything. Okay, I can't comment. I don't know.
00:34:18.276 - 00:34:49.570, Speaker A: Easyfi, abrahadabra. Julian, it's not true. With NFtb altogether, to build program from finance is $100 million. And one of the first project which were listed on finance. Okay, so you think they didn't get $100 million of funding? You think that's the whole program of finance? Okay, well, maybe the article I read was misleading. I mean, personally, I find it super surprising, like how the hell they can raise $100 million. It just seems completely crazy.
00:34:49.570 - 00:35:05.920, Speaker A: Thx, I look up NFT art and I found a website and a coin of the same name. Okay. I don't know this project. Abracadabra bakery swap. Focus on NFT. Okay, interesting. You can't mint there your own NFt.
00:35:05.920 - 00:35:31.790, Speaker A: Buy NFt from Marketplace. Okay. I haven't studied much. Okay, you mean you can mint your own NFt from bakery swap? Really? Okay, interesting to check it out. Okay. Jake Breeding saying, that's cool. Too bad there are like 200 people in Wyoming and 20 of them have computer.
00:35:31.790 - 00:35:59.848, Speaker A: Yes, but it doesn't matter because what matters is just that DiA would decide to be incorporated there. You don't need to live in Wyoming. It's like Delaware. Abracadabra saying register. I think you mean for the airdrop of ew blocks. And sell me all your coins. Anton, what do you think of ripple and litecoin? They have large market cap, but technology is not so good.
00:35:59.848 - 00:36:16.732, Speaker A: Yeah, forget about them. This was really like a 2017 blockchain. But they have no reason to have any market cap at all. These are like phantom chain. Dixon. Fadel hello, Julian. Hey, man.
00:36:16.732 - 00:36:40.230, Speaker A: Edwin. Looking forward to make defi course more clear or more example how to follow guess. I think. Edwin, I think you took the course. So if you have some questions, some suggestions, you can send me an email. Jack breeding, congrats on the token I have to get on binance smart chain. Like today.
00:36:40.230 - 00:37:08.990, Speaker A: You just need to use an ethereum address and you can register for the airdrop. You just have to make sure you do control the private key. So don't use an address from a centralized exchange. It will not work. Laosha hey, is there any current defi project you are particularly excited about? So excited. I don't know if I'm excited, but I'm curious about safemoon because everybody is talking about it. So, yeah, I'll probably have to do a video about it.
00:37:08.990 - 00:37:29.380, Speaker A: Roma hey, bro. Would be a great idea to make a new series from a to z to follow the defi course. It's kind of hard to flow from the creation to the deployment of binance smart chain. For example, I watch almost all future tutorial. Great work. Wow. Vivla, France.
00:37:29.380 - 00:38:08.016, Speaker A: Yes. That's awesome because I really have a lot of videos that must have took you a lot of time. So I don't know if you're aware, but I have a course on Defi, so you can find the link in the description. So if you want something a little bit more structured. Before on my channel, I used to do more series but series on YouTube, it's a little bit harder because everything is just more chaotic. You don't know if people will really follow the whole series or not. I do more like individual videos then coinbase feed saying hype is real.
00:38:08.016 - 00:38:53.170, Speaker A: I think you mean for safemoon. The price is mooning right now, but I didn't have the time to look at the code, so I prefer not to say much about safemoon. Dixon thought on harmony chain, what's the point of sharding? Okay, no, I didn't know this blockchain. Homan, did you plan to start some course on Solana? This project is amazing. Maybe so, yeah, so as I was saying before, actually, let me repost the, okay, I'm going to repost the two link. So one link for the webinar for people who want to work with the blocks. So as I was saying, I'm going to hire some teacher to create some blockchain courses as well as other people.
00:38:53.170 - 00:39:21.930, Speaker A: So yeah, with the teacher I will hire, maybe one of them can do a course on Solana if there is some demon. The other link I wanted to remind you about is the link for the airdrop of the blocks. So for people who haven't registered yet. Okay, so let me continue the chat. We have a lot of questions tonight. This is great. Okay, so Nihon is saying, thanks for the content.
00:39:21.930 - 00:39:49.490, Speaker A: I will try to mix my skills in finance with. Yes, yes. It's a great combination to have some coding skills and experience in finance. This is exactly the kind of profile that Defi company love. Anton D. Hello. Do you think binance coin will continue rising to ethereum level or already reaches potential? It's a very good question.
00:39:49.490 - 00:40:40.224, Speaker A: I don't think it will reach the level of Ethereum. It will probably keep rising, but I don't see it reaching Ethereum. But more interestingly, I can see Matic, the token of polygon. I can see this token reaching the market cap of binance smart chain. So I see huge potential on no, Mikhail Gallerizo is saying no XRP, no repo eat the yes, yes. Michael Vic sell trade. Maybe a dumb question, but how does an NFT exchange ownership if it's immutable, or does only the NFT exchange define who owns what? Okay, so in the NFT token, what's immutable is the data attached to it.
00:40:40.224 - 00:41:15.580, Speaker A: But the owner of the NFT can change. Yeah, so this is updatable Michael saying anyone going to Miami for the bitcoin conference? Oh, interesting. I haven't followed this. This reminds me. Actually, this bitcoin conference is of historic importance because Vitalik buttering, he made the first announcement of Ethereum during the bitcoin conference in Miami. I think that was in 2013. Something like this, yeah.
00:41:15.580 - 00:41:38.072, Speaker A: Just for history's sake. Dixon saying lot of hype around moshi swap and one moon token on harmony. Okay, I got to check this harmony chain. I didn't know that. Okay. Abracadabra saying, viva la France. Yes, forex shark.
00:41:38.072 - 00:41:54.920, Speaker A: Keep up the good work. Looking forward to the airdrop and building some dapps for it. Yes, forex shark. Me too. Me too. I'm so excited. We're going to do, like, many projects with this token and with some videos also on the channel already.
00:41:54.920 - 00:42:41.880, Speaker A: The other day when I was building the airdrop, it makes me happy because this wasn't just a tutorial, but that's like a production app that people are really going to use. So it's like slightly more pressure, but it's also technically more interesting because you have to make sure that everything works fine. You have to handle all the different possible errors. Yeah. Okay, so Abracadabra saying, by the way, I made 13 x on safe moon and I'm out. Wow, this is awesome. Finn Robinson, do you still think Ethereum will reach $10,000 and bitcoin $100,000 this year? It's difficult to give dates.
00:42:41.880 - 00:43:14.528, Speaker A: Ethereum. Okay, so bitcoin $100,000 this year. Yeah, ethereum, 10,000. Okay. I think it will at least double or triple from where it's now, but, yeah, I would say I'm very confident it will reach at least 5000 and quite confident it will reach 10,000. Yeah. Okay, so aracadabra about matic, like two months ago after you mentioned that in the video.
00:43:14.528 - 00:43:20.592, Speaker A: Nice move. Wow. Yes. Nice move. Plv. Hi. From Argentina.
00:43:20.592 - 00:43:33.624, Speaker A: Thanks for all the material you share. I'm a programmer and this makes me easier to start developing. Dapps. Yes. This is the goal. Jack breeding so crazy. 100,000 bitcoin is only two x.
00:43:33.624 - 00:43:57.552, Speaker A: It's looking so damn good right now. Yes. Roman saying, I see a big potential in matic. Me watch my history trade getting matic at 24 2.4 cents. Oh, my God. I hope you fill your bags very nicely because now I think you've made like a 15 x, something like this.
00:43:57.552 - 00:44:37.752, Speaker A: Yeah, nice 20 x tuna. I'm a developer and I'm struggling to figure out is LP token or NFT or just ERC 20 is any way to figure out that from contract? Abi. Okay, so NFT it's ERC 721 and LP token, it's ERC 20. But in order to understand this, you can just use your common sense. So LP token, many people can have the same. So if many people can have the same, this is fungibles. Fungible is 20 NFT.
00:44:37.752 - 00:45:07.380, Speaker A: The whole point of NFT is that there is just one copy. So there is only one person who can own an NFT. So that means non fungible. So that's Yas 721. And yes, by looking at the ABI, you can figure out which interface they implement. Then Philippe Gimone saying ample force is pretty centralized. Okay, I haven't studied much ample force.
00:45:07.380 - 00:46:16.844, Speaker A: Anton saying, do you think serious regulation soon coming from US government because market is getting so large? Wow, big questions. I think it's going to go in both directions. Maybe we're going to have some bad news from regulations, but at the same time you're also probably going to have a bitcoin ETF coming soon. We have now so much interest of big money in crypto that any moves of regulators, that is in the world of crypto, if they regulate too much at this point, it's going to be costly politically. So I think now they will be very careful about what they do. Then. Low Q saying, hey bro, which platform is safest for DeFi staking? I recommend to just use the interface of the DeFi project that you want to stake for.
00:46:16.844 - 00:47:06.540, Speaker A: So if you want to stake for Project X, then you use the interface of Project X. But if you use some platform that allow you to stake in other DeFi project, that means now you have an extra risk because you have the risk of the DeFi project itself. But then you also have the risk of the interface that you are using. So if you can just use the interface of the DeFi project itself and also be careful with any centralized platform that allow you to do staking, then you lose a lot of the benefit of DeFi. The only thing you win in this case is lower fees. That's it. Smart crypto boy chan link, $1,000 end of year.
00:47:06.540 - 00:47:40.104, Speaker A: Yes, possible. Yeah, chain link at this stage does really establish itself as the clear leader in Oracle. So yeah, I'm very bullish for matic. Look, your prediction for matic with this level of adoption. Yeah, as I was saying before, I do think matic can match the market cap of finance smart chain. So I think right now for Matic, for polygon, we are at less than $1 billion. For binance marching, we are at 100 billion something, maybe $150,000,000,000 I believe so, yeah.
00:47:40.104 - 00:48:24.484, Speaker A: I do think formatic we have a solid like 100 x possible. Yeah. Okay then Jake breeding actually aren't LP token 720 ones? No, they respect the interface of Yas 20. No. Abracadabra, Juliana. So Marie Lopen coin was your work? No, it's not me. What else? Low Q.
00:48:24.484 - 00:49:33.276, Speaker A: I mean, which DeFi project is safest for staking? Wow, that's a very difficult one. When you do staking, that means that you are exposed to the underlying coin. So if the project is hacked, even if the staking mechanism is not hacked itself, but if another part of project is hacked and you stake the governance token, then the price of the governance token is going to turn to shit. So yeah, whatever you stake, that means you need to be comfortable having an exposure for the underlying governance token. Okay, so I think we are reaching the end of the stream because I don't see any more question. Yes, let me quickly put the links again. So if you want to work with the blocks and basically become a teacher and teach blockchain course.
00:49:33.276 - 00:50:01.908, Speaker A: So I'm going to do a webinar this week, Thursday at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. So register for this webinar and if you haven't registered yet for the airdrop, I put the link as well, the airdrop of the ether blocks token. You still have until the end of this month to register. Okay, quickly, some other question, Kevin. Are flashloan still a viable option to make some profit? Yeah, like no more or less than before. Exactly the same.
00:50:01.908 - 00:50:38.780, Speaker A: Michael, is there anything else that some of us in the community can help for the token? Maybe try out some of our new skills? Yeah, actually thanks for asking, Michael. Actually I think I'm going to do a test of the airdrop on the testnet of binance smart chain, just to make sure that everything works well. So probably I'm going to maybe announce this on Twitter and we're going to do a test airdrop. But thanks for asking, tuna. I just tuned in. Oh, that's the end. But you can rewind the stream.
00:50:38.780 - 00:50:55.408, Speaker A: Do you think there will be flash loan for binance merchant? Yes, it's already the case. I've made a video about this. Yeah. All right guys, all right guys, we're going to stop here. So yeah, thanks for coming today. Really big stream today, a lot of people. I love it and I will see you later this week.
00:50:55.408 - 00:50:57.270, Speaker A: Have a great week, guys. Bye bye. It.
