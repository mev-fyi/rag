00:00:01.890 - 00:00:21.462, Speaker A: You're live. Hey, welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in DFI and Ethereum. I do this every Monday at 11:00 a.m. East coast time. And today I'm super late. I'm very sorry, guys. I don't know what happened.
00:00:21.462 - 00:00:51.774, Speaker A: There was some connectivity issue. But finally I'm online. I'm all also trying out a new microphone. So if you have any feedback with the sound, please let me know. Let me know in the chat how it's going with the sound. So in this video, I'm going to be talking of Ethereum 2.0, of course, because we are only one week away from the deadline for the deposit contract, so there will be a lot of price movement after this deadline.
00:00:51.774 - 00:01:26.766, Speaker A: So it's super important to understand what's going on. I'm going to be talking about Infra, which is the most popular Ethereum API. So infra was down and I will explain what happened exactly and what does it mean for Ethereum? Then I'll be talking about DeFi, which is growing like crazy again. So we had some crazy gains in the DFI token last week. I'll be talking of new flash from attack, where $7.5 million was stolen. And we'll cover many, many other stuff because there are a lot of important news this week.
00:01:26.766 - 00:01:58.294, Speaker A: And we'll do the Q and A at the end as usual. And if you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host. And on my channel, itoblocks, I teach blockchain development and how to find your first blockchain job. And before we continue, quick shout to my two courses. If you want to become a blockchain developer and make $100,000 per year like I used to make, register for my course six figure blockchain developer. And if you want to learn how to do flash loan arbitrage, check my other course on flash loan. Hi to everybody in the chat.
00:01:58.294 - 00:02:27.250, Speaker A: Hi crazy cool. Hi to. Yeah, Julian is back. I'm so sorry for being late this time, but finally I was able to fix my issue and I'm back. So we're going to start as usual with Ethereum. So the price of ether we had really nice increase in the middle of the week, but after it went down. So in the end, we are totally flat for this week.
00:02:27.250 - 00:02:52.550, Speaker A: No gain, no losses. I think everybody's really nervous before the launch of Ethereum 2.0 and we'll talk more about this later. As usual, we'll have a quick look on the gas of the price of gas. So like for last week it was pretty stable. It seems like we have kind of bottomed out. I don't think gas prices will go much further down in the short term.
00:02:52.550 - 00:03:37.542, Speaker A: The next thing that can make gas price go lower will be the launch of an l two scaling solution, maybe in partnership with the big exchange like Uniswap. I know that people talk a lot of project called optimism for that, so we'll see what happens. So next we are going to talk of the situation on Ethereum 2.0 and in particular, how is the deposit contract doing? So first quick recap on what is Ethereum 2.0? So ethereum 2.0 is the next version of Ethereum, way more scalable than the current version of Ethereum. So it will be deployed in several phases and in the first phase, phase zero, it's supposed to be launched at the beginning of December.
00:03:37.542 - 00:04:21.910, Speaker A: So in this phase anybody will be able to stake Ether to become a validator and earn some interest in exchange for helping to secure the network by running a validator node. So I won't go in more detail about what is if you want to know more, check out my last livestream where I gave more detail. So today we're going to talk more about the situation with the deposit contract. So in order for phase zero to start in December, we need to have reached a certain amount of ether staked by November 24. So in about a week. So these stake ether are deposited on a smart contract on Ethereum one. That's what we call the deposit contract.
00:04:21.910 - 00:05:05.266, Speaker A: So far we have reached only 22% of the required total of stake Ether and we only have about one week left. However, I don't think it's time to panic because whales are probably going to invest at the very last moment. There is actually no incentive to deposit your ether before, because in the meantime you can stake your ether, use it in some defi protocol and earn some interest. And people don't want to miss out on this. So I think it's going to be fine. We're going to have enough ether on November 24, so I'm actually planning to devote this week to ether 2.0 on either block.
00:05:05.266 - 00:05:53.166, Speaker A: So expect to see more video on this. I'll probably do a tutorial for how to become a staker and another surprise tutorial to show you how to build a project related to staking. So then the next news is Inferra was done last week and it was pretty big deal. So first, what is Infra? So when you want to deploy or interact with a smart contract on Mainnet, you need to run a node. So a node is the software that run on theorem. So anybody can run a node. When you start your node, it automatically connects to all the nodes on the network and after that you can interact with the Ethereum network.
00:05:53.166 - 00:06:26.654, Speaker A: So as a side note, it's possible to run a node as a non miner. If you are just a developer, that's actually what you want to do. The problem is that it's quite difficult to run a node on Mainnet, even as a non minor. There are high requirements for the hardware and also requires some technical skills to fine tune your servers. That's why some people created API services for Ethereum developers. These services run their own Ethereum and mainnet nodes and let developers access these nodes through APIs. So Infra is the most popular of these services.
00:06:26.654 - 00:07:12.058, Speaker A: Okay, so now we understand what is Infra. So next, what happened exactly during the infra outage last week? So the team of Geth, which is the most used Ethereum client, released an upgrade to fix a bug. Some network participants updated to the latest version of Geth, but other like Infra didn't. So as a result, it created a fork in a network. So Infra was stuck on a minority chain and as a result there was a big service outage on Infra. So since Infra is so used in blockchain, it caused a lot of other projects to be done as well, such as a price feed for ether and ES 20 token. As a result, a couple of exchanges, including finance, decided to freeze Ethereum withdrawals temporarily.
00:07:12.058 - 00:08:00.522, Speaker A: A couple of hours later, Infra updated its guest node and restored the service. So that was a big scare, and I don't like to see this happening just two weeks before the launch of Ethereum 2.0. I know it's going to spook some investors, but just to be clear, it doesn't have any technical impact on Ethereum 2.0. It's more about the credibility of the network in general. So what can we learn from this? Ethereum is definitely too reliant on infra, and that's really not good when one of the main value proposition of Ethereum is to be decentralized. So there are a couple of projects that are working on decentralizing infra, but none of them is really production ready. But what is really important to know is how you can make sure your blockchain project is protected against any downtime from infra.
00:08:00.522 - 00:08:35.730, Speaker A: So infra is not the only centralized Ethereum API. You also have companies like Quicknode and Alchemy API. What I like with Alchemy API is that they're focused on reliability. They are the most popular services for a lot of blockchain projects, including in Defi. So you can see them as a sort of infer on steroids. And if you're interested to know more about them, you can check out. Actually I have another tutorial on Alchemy API on my channel, and if you can afford it, and you are doing a really big project, you can also run your own Ethereum node.
00:08:35.730 - 00:08:59.022, Speaker A: So in order to do this you probably need to hire a DevOps guy dedicated to just running your node. Plus you will need to invest some resources in a server, so it's probably not for small projects. Okay, so now we are going to check at the market cap of Defi. So we are at 13.6 billion. That's about 1.2 billion more than last week.
00:08:59.022 - 00:09:33.420, Speaker A: So that's a new all time high. It's very good. Last week we also had a nice increase, but that was due to the price increase of ether. Only this week is different. The increase is actually due to an increase of the number of ether invested. So this increase is more meaningful. In the coming week we will probably see a decrease in the market cap of Defi because some people are going to exit Defi protocol to stake their ether in ethereum 2.0.
00:09:33.420 - 00:10:04.120, Speaker A: Okay, so next we're going to have a quick look at the price of Defi tokens. So this week we have massive gain. This guy. This is really crazy. We haven't seen this for a couple of weeks already. So more than 200% for Alpha, which is a crosschain DeFi protocol, almost 200% for index, which is a yield aggregator built on top of the set protocol, and a lot of green here. Sushi 100% curve 66.
00:10:04.120 - 00:10:37.518, Speaker A: We have some really nice increase. And when it comes to the decrease we don't have so much. We have some DeFi fork that are really red, like Pico for example. So at the cream finance here, but we have much less red than green in general. Yeah. So next we have a quick look at the rates this week. So it's a bit less exciting than last week.
00:10:37.518 - 00:11:11.370, Speaker A: So we have a 5.58% for USDC on DoiDX, 5.48 for tether on Ave. But apart from this, nothing too crazy. Okay, so next we are going to see the news more about the DfI project. So DFi in general is growing like crazy. So the total defi user amount increased by 55% in just six weeks, or if you just take just October, it's 40%.
00:11:11.370 - 00:11:51.160, Speaker A: So total now we have 860,000 users in DFI. This is about ten times more than one year ago. So users are tracked by unique Ethereum addresses. That's how we can know how many users we have in DeFi. So this data is coming from doing analytics. As a side note, so doing analytics is an amazing tool for blockchain entrepreneurs because you can find unique insights about blockchain usage and you can validate some businesses hypothesis. So I actually have a tutorial on doing analytics on my channel if you are interested.
00:11:51.160 - 00:12:31.866, Speaker A: So what I find interesting is that we have a divergence between the gross of market value and the growth of user in DeFi. So what's more important? Ideally we want both, but in this case, I would interpret it as a signal that the current market cap of Defi is undervalued. Because when all of these new users will start to use DeFi more seriously, it's going to be a killing. So super, super good. Next we're going to talk of synthetics. So, synthetics release a new asset to be exposed to the price of oil. So synthetics, if you never heard about it, this is one of the biggest derivative exchange in DeFi.
00:12:31.866 - 00:13:19.202, Speaker A: So with synthetics, you can trade advanced financial assets. So with this new asset on oil, you can either go long with s oil or short with I oil. And you can also buy a binary option on oil. So technically they use a chain link, oracle, to build this asset and connect it to the price of oil. So why is this important? Why does it add value compared to just simply buying a future on oil in a traditional exchange? So once you tokenize your long or short position on oil, you can use the token that represent your position, that represent your position in synetics. You can use this token in other defi protocol as a collateral, for example. And you can play really the money Lego game.
00:13:19.202 - 00:14:07.166, Speaker A: So it's much, much more powerful than just holding a position on oil on a traditional exchange. So it's very possible that in the future, more and more traders will prefer trading oil this way on the blockchain compared to just using a traditional exchange. It's a very similar story as with bitcoin, which is being tokenized on Ethereum with rapid bitcoin. This, I believe this mechanism that will make defi very successful by attracting the liquidity of markets outside of blockchain into Ethereum. And we could see the same thing happening with other commodities and also with stocks. So what you see here with synthetics and all, this is just the beginning. All right, so next news on Mechodo and Dai.
00:14:07.166 - 00:15:04.550, Speaker A: So they reach a bigger milestone because 1 billion die were created since the launch of the protocol. So real nice milestone here for the team of Mechodio. Newcomers might not realize it because at this point it just seems like Dai is just part of the infrastructure. There is nothing special about it, but it's important to realize the importance of mechodio in DFI. So when they launched their project a few years ago, DFI was just beginning with old school decentralized exchange like ether, Delta and IDX, with like some messed up UX and with all the ERC 20 tokens trading against ETH and some really poor liquidity for a lot of markets. And when maker Dao introduced their stable coin, all of a sudden all of the decks were able to trade against a coin that kept the same value all the time. And that really helped to trigger the growth in the defi space.
00:15:04.550 - 00:15:46.766, Speaker A: So congrats to them to have reached this milestone. And yeah, Dai is very important project. Next we are going to talk of news about NFT and engine. So engine are going to make their platform free. So what is engine? This is a marketplace for gaming NFT. So before you had to pay a subscription to create NFT on their platform, now it's free, but you still have to use their token engine in order to bag the value of your NFT. So I like that they are specialized in gaming NFT because I always like when a project has a very specific niche.
00:15:46.766 - 00:16:29.370, Speaker A: I really don't like when a project say, oh, we want to be the google of this or that. Like we want to be super big. I really don't like that because in general it means a lack of strategy. I like when people are super focused on something and then they can grow and maybe become the next Google of such industry. But I don't like that engine within engine, you have to use their token in order to create an NFT. So in the past we already saw some project that lost because we had to use their tokens in order to use their service. For example, with Zero X, which is a decentralized exchange in their v one, we had to use their tokens to pay for trading fees.
00:16:29.370 - 00:17:05.526, Speaker A: And even though they launched before Uniswap, they still lost to Uniswap, which did not require the use of any tokens to trade. So I'm kind of expecting that engine will drop their tokens in the future as well. Okay, so next we're going to talk of hacks, because this week we had two hacks in Defi. First a hack with Acropolis. So it's a bit difficult to define this project. They do very different things. So first you can build the daos, then you can borrow and lend crypto a bit like compound, and it also has a yield aggregator like yarn finance.
00:17:05.526 - 00:17:54.860, Speaker A: So I don't really see how this all fits together to be honest. But the fact of the matter is, they were hacked 2 million die on November twelveth, and I think it's their yield aggregator product that was hacked, and what was exploited was a bug of reentrancy. So reentrancy is really a bug that was exploited many times. It's a bit difficult to explain here quickly without any schema, but basically this is a very non intuitive bug. And for example, if you just know web development, you probably never heard of such a thing as reentrancy. Guys who do really low level stuff like CRC plus plus, maybe they see what I mean. But I'll probably do another video where I explain reentrancy a little bit with more detail.
00:17:54.860 - 00:18:28.162, Speaker A: Then there was another hack for another protocol that's called value defi. So what is value defi? So this is a protocol to earn some yield with staking or by being a liquidity provider. So this is not like a yield aggregator because in this protocol you have to choose in advance what is the strategy you want to use, and there won't be any kind of rebalancing of optimization after you invest. So it's not a yield aggregator. They were hacked. 7.4 million die on November 14.
00:18:28.162 - 00:19:20.322, Speaker A: So there was a flash on attack that borrowed 80,000 eth from Ave. So I didn't have enough time to analyze this hack in detail, but it seems very similar with all the flash loan attack where the attacker does a single transaction, where first he manipulates the price of a pair on an exchange by using the money of the flash loan. Then he deposits, he invests in a vault that is related to the pair he just manipulated, then he manipulates the price of the pair in the other direction, then withdraw its investment from the vault and make a profit. So I might do another video to explain this hack in detail. If you guys are interested. Let me know in the chat if that's interesting. Next we're going to talk of big news about PayPal.
00:19:20.322 - 00:19:56.178, Speaker A: So PayPal just entered the crypto market a few weeks ago by lying to buy crypto from your PayPal account. So it's possible to buy bitcoin, Ethereum, bitcoin, cash and litecoin. So far it was restricted to us customers only who have applied for the new feature, and it was very, very successful. The waiting list is way bigger than PayPal expected. That's why PayPal decided to remove some restrictions. And now anybody in the US can buy crypto with PayPal. No need to apply.
00:19:56.178 - 00:20:31.182, Speaker A: Also, the weekly limit was raised from $10,000 to $20,000. So PayPal has a huge user base. It's hundreds of millions of users. And in these users there are a lot of merchants that get paid with PayPal and they have a lot of money in their probably that. A lot of these merchants will be really interested in this new feature. So with PayPal, you can buy crypto at premium. So why would anyone buy bitcoin or ether on PayPal then? Because you could just buy it on Coinbase at a better price.
00:20:31.182 - 00:21:08.294, Speaker A: Well, there are a couple of reasons. First, it's convenient, so you don't need to move the money to Coinbase, for example. And also you have some fees associated when you withdraw your money from PayPal, especially if you need to do some currency conversion. I mean, I know it because I receive part of the payment for my blockchain courses with PayPal and their fees are just atrocious. It's really a couple of percent. This is really ridiculous. And also because a lot of people don't even know about other ways to buy crypto and maybe they feel more comfortable if Paypal hold a private key.
00:21:08.294 - 00:21:44.710, Speaker A: So there really a lot of reasons why people would use PayPal in order to buy bitcoin. So I would say super bullish for the market of bitcoin and ethereum. But of course, if you crypto savvy, I would highly recommend not to use PayPal to buy your crypto because you don't actually really own your crypto. They control the private key and you cannot even transfer your crypto to another address. You can just buy the crypto or sell it with PayPal. So you get some sort of crippled crypto. So it's bad for us, but it's good for the markets.
00:21:44.710 - 00:22:35.938, Speaker A: Next we're going to talk regulation. So binance has announced that they will stop accepting customer from the US. So after the lawsuit against Bitmex a couple of weeks ago, I guess they're probably advised by their lawyers that they could be the next one to be targeted by us regulators and they freak out. So this move is finally going to hurt them. They probably have a lot of user in the US, and it's going to be a giant gift for Coinbase, that's for sure. But it's still better than being sued by the US and potentially be cut off from the US dollar financial. And I really believe the trust in the CEO of binance to be a very practical guy that is efficient.
00:22:35.938 - 00:23:37.146, Speaker A: Actually, a lot of people don't know this, but finance set a new record in the new record in how fast they grew. I think they reached something like 1 billion of profit in a record time, like in maybe 18 months or something like this. And it was faster than any other company before them, like even Google or Facebook. So, yeah, finance, from a business perspective, they're really strong and I really trust them to navigate the regulatory issue, to stay in the market and not end up like a bitmex. Next, we have the UK treasury, which is to publish a draft for regulating stablecoins. So they said that it would put forward proposal for regulating relevant stablecoin initiative to ensure they are held to the same standard as rival payment methods. So they want to make sure that the competition is fair.
00:23:37.146 - 00:24:22.850, Speaker A: I think this is really positive because lots of merchants probably don't dare to accept payments in crypto before it's regulated. They don't want to be accused of money laundering. So once these stable coins are regulated, potentially it can create a lot of new demand for stablecoin. So more liquidity for stablecoin equals more liquidity for DeFi, equals good for us, then. Next in the category regulatory news. So a couple of us representatives are unhappy about the OCC who focus too much on cryptos. What is the OCC? So that's the short for the office of the Controller of the currency.
00:24:22.850 - 00:25:19.994, Speaker A: So in short, that's the banking regulator in the US. So there are six Democrat congressmen that said they were super unhappy about the OCC focus on crypto, because it could undermine the assets that are denominated in USD. And it's especially inappropriate in a difficult time where we have Covid. So, to put things in context, the OCC allowed banks to be custodian of crypto a few months ago. So I don't really know how important it is that this representative said this. I think most likely we'll have to wait until we know exactly what's going to be the next administration in the US. And we'll need to wait to see what is the stance of this new administration on crypto, if I remember well, I think Trump was pretty much against crypto, even though he didn't do anything and for Biden, I'm not even sure he actually expressed anything about it.
00:25:19.994 - 00:25:58.678, Speaker A: He might actually not be interested by this because he has many other things to do. Okay, so that's it for the news about blockchain and defi. And now I'm going to quickly go to the news for developers. So first I wanted to show you this new project, Ethereum nodes. So that's a dashboard to see the status of the various Ethereum API services. So that was created after the outage of infura so that you could quickly find alternatives if your Ethereum API is down. So that's really a good example of a simple project that anybody can do.
00:25:58.678 - 00:26:37.170, Speaker A: You can see the UI is very simple. Technically this is not too complicated. You just need to ping the different crypto services and if you don't receive any answer, like maybe in five minutes, then you change the status to not working. And yeah, this is super useful. So you don't necessarily need to spend a lot of time to do like an advanced project. Even with the simple id well executed, you can come under the spotlight and do something super useful for the community. Then there is a new tool, it's called meow.
00:26:37.170 - 00:27:15.594, Speaker A: Meow like a cat. That's a transaction debugger for Ethereum and that's for mainnet transaction. So it's a little bit like tenderly or another tool, a little bit less known score ethx info. But in the case of Meow, you can run it locally with Docker. So that's useful if you don't trust this other online tool I just show you or if they are down. Yeah, so good alternative here. Okay, so that's the end of the news for developers.
00:27:15.594 - 00:27:39.554, Speaker A: And now we're going to start the Q A section. So I'm going to rewind the chat and see all the questions. So let's go. So. So, Alexander, Barry, say hey, julian, thanks for the start of the week news. I look forward to this live stream every week. Hey, Alexander, Jill and hello, Julian, Gary, Heather, Julian.
00:27:39.554 - 00:27:53.050, Speaker A: Let's learn. Tshx is Jean chow. Hey, Julian, I'm Ryan, who just joined your course. Hey, welcome, Ryan. Batman. Hey. Hello, Batman.
00:27:53.050 - 00:28:29.826, Speaker A: Okay, Rakesh is saying make a deep roadmap video on how to become a blockchain developer. Okay. Actually talking about this. So I'm going to do a live stream on November 27 for how to get started in blockchain. So that's really for the beginner. If you're thinking of starting in blockchain, you don't know how I'm going to answer exactly this question, Rakesh. It's going to be a very specific roadmap.
00:28:29.826 - 00:28:59.662, Speaker A: I'm going to explain everything. I'm going to send an email to you guys for the link to this live stream. So it's probably not for those who are already advanced. If you already follow me for a couple of times, it's going to be really for beginner who want to get into blockchain, but they're a bit stuck. They don't know where to get started. More info on this after. Who is saying, jane, charlie is not used to Juden's shorter hair? Yeah, man.
00:28:59.662 - 00:29:18.322, Speaker A: I mean, I try the longer hair, the shorter hair, but finally I think everybody prefer my shorter hair discussions about this. It's like before I try longer beard, but it just doesn't work on me. Abracadabra. Say hey. Hi, Julian. Hi. Abracadabra.
00:29:18.322 - 00:29:25.240, Speaker A: Crazy cool. Julian the genius. I wish. Jordan. Hey, Julian Dunamis. Hey. Hey.
00:29:25.240 - 00:30:06.200, Speaker A: Ashk Patel is saying, I just googled metamask and first Link was an ad that was a phishing scam. Very dangerous. It's very easy to get hacked. Okay. Actually, when you find something like this, you can send a tweet to the team of Metamask with a link to the scam and then probably they'll find a way to contact Google. Just make sure it gets the. If you want to install Metamask, you go to the Chrome store, you tap metamask and the first result is probably the correct one is the result with the most download, so it's easy to find the correct one.
00:30:06.200 - 00:30:14.194, Speaker A: Okay. Phoenix query. Hi, Julian. Hi, Phoenix Query. Alexander Barris. Yes. Do a video on the hack.
00:30:14.194 - 00:30:50.660, Speaker A: Okay, I'll think about it. Phoenix query. So tell us a project that is launching soon that we should pay attention, friend. Oh, you mean like a token that's going to boom? Yeah. To be honest, I haven't really paid attention to the up and coming project for investment purpose. But, yeah, maybe I should start to pay attention to this. Is PayPal crypto feature limited to us? Yes, at the moment, but they're going to expand in the future, that's for sure.
00:30:50.660 - 00:31:29.098, Speaker A: If us users are blocked from Axiom Finance, how can they withdraw tokens? Well, I think they're going to have 90 days to withdraw their tokens after, I guess, their accounts will be blocked or something like this. Aronu is saying, check out Zen finance. We're applying Defi to credit union and cooperative. Okay, interesting. I've never heard of that one. Defeat Trader said, love your work. Hey, defeat Trader.
00:31:29.098 - 00:31:41.442, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. Are you the defeat trader of the YouTube channel? Yeah. I like your channel too, man. Yeah. Good work. Abracadabra. Hi, Joe, where is standing ethereum 2.0?
00:31:41.442 - 00:32:03.610, Speaker A: There will be any delay. Ha. This is the $1 million question. So yeah, as I said before, we are at 22% of the total required funding and we just have about one week to go. So it appears it's going too slow. But at the same time, we knew from the beginning that the participation wouldn't be linear. It will be exponential.
00:32:03.610 - 00:32:39.122, Speaker A: So we'll have the answer to this question at the very end, like probably during the last day. It's going to be super active and it's going to be like in action movie, there is the bomb that is ticking and maybe they have like five or ten minutes to stop the bomb, but no, they're just chatting and just taking their time. And you are in the audience, you say, what the hell, guys? Stop the freaking bonk. Stop talking. But they just wait for the last 5 seconds. The Lazarus 2nd 54321. We don't have enough ether.
00:32:39.122 - 00:33:13.860, Speaker A: And yet finally we have enough. It's going to be exactly like this, I'm telling you. So, yeah, I think they're going to be a huge tension on the market for the price of ether. Maybe they're going to be some crazy price swings until the last moment and then we're going to have enough ether and we're going to have a huge increase, like $50 or even more. I can totally see something like this. Then Thx saying that site reminds me of crypto keys. Okay, I don't know which site you were talking about.
00:33:13.860 - 00:33:56.222, Speaker A: George saying, hello, Julian, where are you from? Hey, I'm french. George Avinash saying, with east two validator, will there be no need of miners in the future. So the vocabulary in east two is different. We don't say miners, but we say validators. So you don't need to spend energy to mine a block, but you need to run some computation with your validator and you need to stake some ether. Also, anybody can run a validator contrary to a miner, which requires some heavy equipment. So that's one of the big difference potentially will have millions of validator in the future.
00:33:56.222 - 00:34:36.060, Speaker A: So it's really like a paradigm shift. Really, really big difference. Yaron saying, hey, Julian, I enjoy your courses. Thanks for all. Hey Yaron, glad you enjoy them, Batman. Any timeline for advanced? So yeah, it's first quarter of next year and when it comes to the defy course, that's going to be in December, probably a few days before Christmas, maybe the 20th or the 21st. Yeah, probably going to announce an official date this week so that I'm forced to respect the date.
00:34:36.060 - 00:35:46.302, Speaker A: No, Derek is saying, what project have made you the most money? Are you actively using flash loan or other defi tools? So me in terms of defi tools, I use the tools for developers for investment. I just do very simple thing like I have some tether invested in compound. Just sometime when I get paid for my courses in coins that I don't want to keep, then I use uniswap to sell them. I do some simple stuff like this. I've also run the liquidation boat of DyDX. Yeah, Myra saying, julian, can you do a series on most famous defi hacks? Yeah, interesting. I've actually done separate video on specific hacks, but maybe I could do a video combining all of them by maybe being a little bit more, a little bit faster and be a little bit more comprehensive.
00:35:46.302 - 00:36:35.266, Speaker A: But yeah, I think this year we had at least ten or 15 big hack, especially including flash loan. Yeah, good idea. Agobin is saying please share some publication with quality defi technical content. Okay, yeah, I hope it's what I'm doing already. When your course is coming up? Yeah, defi course is coming end of December. Dunami saying, will you in the future include cybersecurity development for blockchain? So security will be included in the course for solidity, which will be released in the first quarter of 2021. Because really, I consider that being specialized in solidity itself implies that you're good with security.
00:36:35.266 - 00:37:36.440, Speaker A: These two things are very related. When can we expect a Julian Es 20 token? I kind of thought about it of doing like an NFT token, but I don't really know what it could represent. Maybe some voting rights for the content of ether blocks. Maybe when you buy one of my course, then you get some of these tokens. But if I were to do this, I don't think it would work on the main net of Ethereum because people would not accept to spend like one or $2 just to vote for a future video. So I think if I were to do this, I'll probably do it on a testnet like Covan that will still be the one who released the token to people who bought the courses mean this is still work. But yeah, that's the idea I had in the moment.
00:37:36.440 - 00:37:58.240, Speaker A: Erica Davison I would recommend to check a token called ensure. It's like Nxmn. They got grant from a web3 foundation, plus staking coming up soon. Okay. I didn't know this coin. Myra marriage. Are you participating in the BSH hackathon? No, I'm not.
00:37:58.240 - 00:38:25.220, Speaker A: I'm so busy with my YouTube videos and my courses. I'm doing this all alone. So. Yes, really a lot of work, like preparing the video, doing the course, answering to the emails, doing the support. Actually, I'm probably going to get some help soon. I'm going to announce this probably at the beginning of next year. I would like to expand it the blocks a little bit.
00:38:25.220 - 00:38:46.410, Speaker A: Gary san saying, that's correct. 90 days to withdraw from finance. Yes. And after, if you are us customer, you lose your coins forever. Try let me into your Facebook group. Yeah, I do a batch approval every week. So last Sunday I was busy, but I'm going to do it today.
00:38:46.410 - 00:39:22.294, Speaker A: So, yeah, don't worry. You'll be accepted today. Batman. Is there a good story about the neon Batman ghost? Do you have it in the background? Okay, so the story is just very simple. I just wanted to make my background a little bit more attractive because it was kind of boring. So I just went to this shop with a lot of electronic gadgets and I was searching for something a little bit original I could put in the background. And then I found Pac man.
00:39:22.294 - 00:39:44.702, Speaker A: And I thought it's kind of a reference, like a reference that everybody knows for technical people. It's kind of fun. So I was like, okay, let's do the Pacman. But in general, I'm kind of frustrated with my background. It's kind of boring. You have the really ugly curtain over there. I need to improve this, guys.
00:39:44.702 - 00:40:12.674, Speaker A: I need to improve this. Abracadabra. Are you also staking for East 20? I haven't decided yet. Possibly. Actually this week, the second video. So the next video I'm going to release is going to be a tutorial for staking. And the video after that is going to be a surprise video on staking.
00:40:12.674 - 00:40:37.914, Speaker A: I don't say no more, but it's basically going to be useful for people who don't want to invest one full ether, but just want to. 32 ether, but people who want to invest more. Less. But yeah, this is a secret. You'll see this Friday, Ronnie, Zach is saying, hey, it's me, George, for the project. We're talking about blockchain. Greetings.
00:40:37.914 - 00:41:07.686, Speaker A: Hi, Ronnie. Gary sent perhaps an NFT with the Pac man. Yeah, yeah. I saw that there was another crypto YouTube channel that started to do some NFT and that was successful. So, yeah, maybe I could hire an artist and create something with the Pac man. And if you have it, it gives you some more technical skills or something. Yeah, I could do that.
00:41:07.686 - 00:41:22.014, Speaker A: Maybe it's a good idea. Thanks, Gary. Crazy cool. The difference is cheapness on electricity. Mine now becomes staker. Okay, I think you're talking of the difference between proof of stake and proof of work. Abracadabra saying.
00:41:22.014 - 00:41:55.310, Speaker A: One more question. If the delay of Ethereum 2.0 will be too long, could Polkadot take the lead? No, because Polkadot is an inter blockchain solution. So its goal is not to compete with Ethereum, but it wants to connect Ethereum to other blockchain. So you can see Polkadot as a complementary project to Ethereum, but definitely not a competitor. Sorry, man, I can't pronounce your name properly. Rajya.
00:41:55.310 - 00:42:32.290, Speaker A: Combo saying. What's your opinion on flow, Julian? Oh, I don't know this project. Yaron saying, do you know RSK, the smart contract over the bitcoin network? Yes, I've heard about them, like maybe one year ago, but since then I don't think we've heard much. To be honest. I'm not too big on any project that aim to build on top of bitcoin, because bitcoin is very limited. You do have a small programming language in bitcoin. It's called bitcoin script, but that's very limited.
00:42:32.290 - 00:43:03.840, Speaker A: And the tooling around it is really not very good. So we have RSK. There is also defi chain that wants to implement DeFi on top of bitcoin. But yeah, I don't really believe in this project now. Everything is on Ethereum, so I believe much more in any project that built in Ethereum. And don't try to go against the tide, really. Daniel is saying, what do you think Ethereum one proof of work will be turned off to move everything on east two.
00:43:03.840 - 00:43:35.114, Speaker A: When do you think? Yeah, so that's the phase. I think you're talking of phase two of Ethereum 2.0. So beginning of December, this is phase zero, just for staking. Then we're going to have phase one, where we're going to have the different shots, but with just the data, but. But still no transaction. And phase two when we actually do the final migration. So phase one and phase two, this is still in R and D.
00:43:35.114 - 00:44:04.900, Speaker A: And this is projected to be launched in one, two year. Well, I think it's more like two, three years, to be honest. 21. Cabbage is saying bitcoin only, baby. Well, I mean, actually, you don't have to be exclusive. You can keep your bitcoin and still play around in Ethereum with a wrapped bitcoin. So you basically tokenize your bitcoin and then you can have fun in defi as well.
00:44:04.900 - 00:44:56.020, Speaker A: And crazy cool is saying I'm working on flash loan the hell out of Tron. There are some flashing on Tron as well. I wasn't aware of that. Yeah, why not? Batman saying why not make an alternative payout portal for yourself with blockchain? Allow users to pay in crypto. Yeah, so actually I've done a tutorial to build an e commerce website with crypto payment I think a couple of months ago. But the problem is, in order to host my course, I use a platform already and I don't think it'll be super easy to integrate my own payment portal with their platform. But yeah, good idea though.
00:44:56.020 - 00:45:29.310, Speaker A: Try I have some iOS and Java background. Do you think it's possible for me to become a Dap developer in three months? Also, if I get your courses, will I also receive the updated courses? Okay, so two things, when you buy one of my course, any update, you have access to it. So absolutely no problem. My courses. Second thing, my courses are up to date. You already have a technical background so it's going to help you a lot. You don't have to start from scratch.
00:45:29.310 - 00:46:06.594, Speaker A: Actually, I have some students who started from scratch and they learned everything in three, four months. So they were starting from with less knowledge than you and they did it. So you becoming a Dap developer in three months, that's very doable, probably even faster. Really? Yes, totally possible. Chris Eco saying hey, where the artists on this channel hook up? Julian? Yeah, maybe I should send an email asking if any artists want to do an NFT with me. That'd be a good idea. Abracadabra.
00:46:06.594 - 00:46:40.626, Speaker A: Say dude, I would spend even $5 to vote. I'll be Julian token. Well that is awesome, abracadabra. But yeah, I really want to make it super user friendly. For most people, the voting is really a low value action. So yeah, I really want to reduce friction as much as I can, but I think my plan to make it work on Covan would totally work. Derek saying, have you created your own metamask version? Is it possible to do for one person to do.
00:46:40.626 - 00:47:04.490, Speaker A: No, I haven't created my own metamask version. But yeah, I mean technically metamask. This is a Chrome extension, so anybody can release a chrome extension. I think one time I was curious, I wanted to check out how to do this. So I found there was a tutorial of Google. So basically they give you some boilerplate code. This is in JavaScript, so JavaScript, HTML CsS.
00:47:04.490 - 00:47:54.806, Speaker A: So the logic is a little bit different than just a standard HTML page, but it reuses the technology of the web. So you don't have to learn a special language. It's just that you use some APIs of the browser that you don't normally use with a normal web page. But as a web developer, you already know a lot in order to do any Chrome extension, and so from there you have to implement the logic of a wallet. So you have to use web3 and you create private key, you store them, then you show some windows, you create your UI. I'm pretty sure you can use react for Chrome extension. Yeah, you can check out the code of Metamask.
00:47:54.806 - 00:48:34.082, Speaker A: This is on GitHub, this is public. See how they did it. But you probably won't be able to reproduce all the features of Metamask though, because be aware that metamask, this is a big team. They are like, I think at least ten developers, they have millions in funding. They actually were acquired by consensus, so really have a lot of resources. But if this is just a project for fun, for learning, yes, you can do it. However, if you want to be a competitor of Metamask, you better have a very good value proposition, because metamask already sort of achieved escape velocity.
00:48:34.082 - 00:49:04.740, Speaker A: They are growing like crazy, actually. They reach a very important milestone. They have 1 million users, and if you see the user, growth is exponential. So it's going to be super hard to compete with metamask. So you better have a very unique id and probably access to funding if you want to compete with metamask. I would actually not recommend that. If you want to just learn, that's fine.
00:49:04.740 - 00:49:36.966, Speaker A: Okay, next, abracadabra saying, is it Pac man behind you? Yes it is. I thought it's ghost token made by my cat. Yeah, it's my little Pac Man. I accent the Barry saying the goose from Pac man made me think of. Ah, yeah, this is the Pac man of. Oh, you know it. I knew when I bought this, I knew it would become like an icon of either blocks.
00:49:36.966 - 00:50:47.762, Speaker A: I knew it. No. So, Mirror Mira, are you bullish on any other EVM compatible blockchain? Any other change which can run through smart contract natively? So I'm bullish short middle term on binance smart chain, because binance smart chain already has a huge user base, and in their blockchain they basically address the main problem of ethereum, which is the lack of scalability and also the high transaction fees. So on the binance smart chain, the transaction fees are very low. So I think that short to middle term they can steal some liquidity from defi in Ethereum. So we start to see this already with a copycat of sushiswap and Uniswap et cetera on binance smart chain and with the whole liquidity mining, yelp farming things going on. But what I expect after that is that you're going to see some l two scaling solution that start to kick in for Ethereum especially.
00:50:47.762 - 00:51:28.314, Speaker A: You're going to see some partnership with some big decentralized exchange like uniswap that will migrate to l two scaling solution. And then the transaction fee on Ethereum will go down and will be competitive with the binance smart chain. And after you're going to see a flight back from binance smart chain to ethereum. So yeah, long term, I'm not sure about binance smart chain, but short term, middle. And yeah, you have many other blockchain that are based on EVM. Tron is like this hyperledger bezu that allow you to do private blockchain. So this is good for enterprise.
00:51:28.314 - 00:52:13.550, Speaker A: This is also EVM based 2017 vet. Is it worth it for an individual to create a Dydx liquidator boat? Your video is great. Do you still run a boat? No, I don't have the time to fine tune all the parameters of my boat because takes too much time to do all my course and my videos. I don't see why it wouldn't be worth it to run a boat. So I don't recommend you to create a boat from scratch. I recommend to use the code of the boat of DydX, the official one, and from there you can customize it. For example, they don't use a flash loan.
00:52:13.550 - 00:52:40.146, Speaker A: That means you need to have some capital upfront to do some liquidation. But you could customize the liquidator boat to make it use a flash loan, for example. So start with that code as a template and then you can improve from there. Try. Also, do you teach how to use vim? It looks awesome. How fast you oh thanks man. I have a video on my channel you can search on YouTube.
00:52:40.146 - 00:53:09.470, Speaker A: This is called blockchain ide. You can type blockchain ide vim and you will find it. I show how I combine tmux and vim to code. Yeah. What kind of keyboard do you use? I can hear some timers. I just use the butterfly native keyboard of Mac. Nothing special here, but I know some people like this Xno keyboard.
00:53:09.470 - 00:53:44.214, Speaker A: What's the name. Like a mechanical keyboard, it makes a very special. I think this is called MX keyboard. Yeah, not sure this is the correct name. Mirror voting can be signed, transaction, no cost. Yeah, but in this case, if I do this, you still need a centralized backend. So that means I'm going to have a centralized backend, maybe deploy on Heroku that check the transaction.
00:53:44.214 - 00:54:36.986, Speaker A: So of course in this case, this is no big deal because this is just for voting on the future content. But the idea is to do something really decentralized. So ideally I would like everything to be decentralized. But yeah, this is a possibility. Akshay is saying, how is metamask heat phrase used to generate a private key? Okay, so that's a bit difficult to give the full explanation here, but it uses something which is called Bip 32. So bip, it means bitcoin improvement proposal. And this is a way to specify some new stuff for bitcoin.
00:54:36.986 - 00:55:04.114, Speaker A: And so the same thing was used to create Ethereum addresses. Then Derek saying floor protocol is made by the same creator as the crypto keys. Oh, interesting. So yeah, I mean, obviously this is a really good team. So. Okay, that's interesting to check out. Abracadabra saying, is there any channel where we can see the Julian meme? Not yet, not yet.
00:55:04.114 - 00:55:52.514, Speaker A: I need to create it. Marcus. Alex saying, I'm new, but I received a proof of authenticity from Verisot, but my artwork is now located on BTC blockchain. What should I do to sell it on wearable being proof of anticity on bitcoin rarest Ethereum? I don't know about this. I never sold an NFT on this platform, but probably they have some faq, but I don't know how it works for NFT. If you can do an NFT, that is cross blockchain. So in this case, you will need to use a system of oracle that fetches the data from bitcoin and inject it into Ethereum.
00:55:52.514 - 00:56:42.894, Speaker A: But I'm not even sure if that exists already. I would say if your NFT is something very valuable, maybe you could do what we call OTC, trade directly with another person. You just contact a few NFT marketplace and maybe that on top of their decentralized exchange, maybe they also can put you directly in relationship with some buyers. And in this case you will go through them not using that decentralized exchange. So yeah, maybe they can do a trade like this. Sasa Nicolic saying, what's the difference between binance smart chain and ethereum? Where is the governance model. How decentralized are they? So how decentralized are they? They are not decentralized.
00:56:42.894 - 00:57:19.334, Speaker A: They are totally centralized because I think they have 21 validators or miners, I don't know how they call it, and pretty much they need to be pre approved. So that means they control them basically. Balance march. And see, this is based on the Ethereum virtual machine, so same technology as Ethereum, but this is a separate network. So anything that happened on Ethereum is totally independent. That what you see on binance smart chain. So yeah, the big difference is decentralization versus centralization.
00:57:19.334 - 00:57:52.262, Speaker A: Another big difference is the transaction cost. So on binance smart chain the transaction costs are very low. And also the scalability of binance smart chain is better than Ethereum. Yeah, the governance model. This, I'm not too familiar, I think this is related to the binance token. But since this is centralized governance, doesn't mean much. They can say whatever they want with a governance token.
00:57:52.262 - 00:58:45.980, Speaker A: Like this is a centralized blockchain. So they decide RK is saying, can you build something cool on bitcoin? I'm not sure about this because this is quite different from Ethereum. The development tools are not great. Before I worked for a customer where we had to build something on bitcoin and even just to send a transaction, that was really a hassle. Besides sending transaction to bitcoin. Yeah, I like to find something a little bit more interesting to do than just sending a transaction to bitcoin. So yeah, I'm not sure about this if I receive more demand, but at the moment the demand for programming on bitcoin is pretty low.
00:58:45.980 - 01:00:02.974, Speaker A: JC bitcoin Jarvis saying, how can you use NFT for staking? Can it work with any NFT, even created by someone else? Well, I mean NFT, they are not so staking. No, because usually staking this is specific to the protocol. So for example, if you want to do some liquidity yield farming, you need to stake the governance token of the protocol. But they don't care about tokens of other protocol and they finally don't care about nfTs. However, maybe that at some point in the future we'll see some integration between NFT and Defi and maybe you'll be able to use your NFT as a collateral, for example, on compound. But one of the big issue I see is how you can price this NFT, because the liquidity of the NFT is very low. It's not like, I don't know, a die where you have a lot of trade at every second, so you can have a reliable price, but with NFT, maybe like you have one trade during one day and then nothing for one month, and then the NFT change owner, and then you have another price.
01:00:02.974 - 01:00:45.182, Speaker A: But the new price might be totally different from the first price, but in order to be used as a collateral, we need to have a reliable price. So if it's like a sort of art NFT or gaming NFT, that's difficult if it's what we call a defi NFT. So defi NFT doesn't exist yet, but this could be, for example, an insurance product or an option product. In this case, we might have a more reliable way of pricing the NFT. So in this case, it could be used as a collateral, but this is not for tomorrow. It's a little bit too early, I think, but it's a good idea. Good question, Marcus.
01:00:45.182 - 01:01:36.238, Speaker A: Alex, what's your take on Kucoin soon to launch NFT exchange? Okay, I wasn't aware of this, but Kucoin. I thought Kucoin was the exchange that just had a problem in China. Or am I getting confused with OKX? Okay, well, if they just had a problem. Now, I think this is OKX. I don't have much to say about Kucoin, but yeah, except the fact that if they already have a user base, launching any other exchange will be easier for sure. So when you launch an exchange, the big issue is that you need to see the two side of the market. You need to find buyers and you need to find sellers, because if you only have buyers but no sellers, then there are no trades.
01:01:36.238 - 01:02:05.706, Speaker A: If you have only sellers but no buyers, there are also no trade. And you need to see both sides of the market, but at the same time. And that's something that is very difficult to do. It's a really huge barrier to entry. So, yeah, with Kucoin, they are probably in a good position to launch an NFT exchange. Try saying, if I'm stuck on something, I believe there is some one on one as well, or is it outsourced out to another person? Yeah. So it depends which package you take.
01:02:05.706 - 01:02:31.460, Speaker A: But for my courses, for some package, this includes a 1 hour station, one on one with me. So this station is with me. And you can also book me for 1 hour as a standalone unit. And this is also with me. RK saying something like Hodl. Hodl, which build lending platform. Okay.
01:02:31.460 - 01:03:04.410, Speaker A: Lucas saying, yes. OKX, problems in China. Kucoin problem was hacked a month ago. Oh, yeah, Kucoin was hacked a month ago on top of bitcoin. How do you see those? I not sure to get. Yeah, no, I really don't see any future for bitcoin besides being a store of value, really. Abracadabra.
01:03:04.410 - 01:03:33.750, Speaker A: Nothing can work on bitcoin. It's just too slow. Yeah, Daniel said why don't enable the YouTube super chat for some? Good tip. Actually, I don't even know how it works. Yeah, thanks for the suggestion. I'm going to check it out how we can do this. Okay, well, RK saying yes build on ETH as well as bitcoin is important.
01:03:33.750 - 01:04:02.382, Speaker A: Yes. Okay, guys, well, the question has to down a bit, so I think we're going to call it a day. So yeah, thanks everybody for coming. Here, here. And don't forget this week I will focus on Ethereum 2.0. So if you have any specific question, you can put them after in the chat, put them in the comments. And yeah, we're going to focus on Ethereum 2.0
01:04:02.382 - 01:04:10.010, Speaker A: this week. All right, guys, thanks for coming and I'll see you soon on my channel. Cheers, bye.
