00:00:00.970 - 00:00:57.450, Speaker A: Can solidity be replaced by another language? After all, if you invest in solidity, you want to make sure that this is going to be a long term investment and it's going to remain the dominant language. There are three situations where solidity could be replaced by another language. The first risk is if the EVM migrate to ewasm, and if rust becomes a dominant language. The second risk is if someone creates a language where it's easy to do formal verification on, and this means that this language will have much better security than solidity. And the latest and biggest risk, in my opinion, if is a L2 scaling solution like zero knowledge polygon or Aztec or Stacknet develops a language that becomes more popular than Ethereum, and their L2 becomes the dominant blockchain out there. However, I still think that all these scenarios are pretty unlikely, so you can focus on solidity and react.
