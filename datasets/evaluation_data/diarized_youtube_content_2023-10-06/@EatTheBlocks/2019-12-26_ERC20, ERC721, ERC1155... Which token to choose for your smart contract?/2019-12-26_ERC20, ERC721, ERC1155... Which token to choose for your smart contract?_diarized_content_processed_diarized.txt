00:00:00.330 - 00:00:36.630, Speaker A: Hey, this is Durian and you are on eddoblocks. In this video, I'm going to explain which token standard you should choose for your smart contract. So there are many token standard to choose from. There is ERC 20, Yasi 721, ERC 755, and there are like tens and tens of others. So when you're trying to model an asset in a smart contract, it can be really confusing. So in this video, I'm going to give you a quick explanation. So let's start by wondering what kind of asset you want to represent on a smart contract, because this question will give you the answer you need.
00:00:36.630 - 00:01:11.650, Speaker A: So roughly speaking, there are two kind of assets in the role. The first kind is what we call a fungible asset. So a fungible asset is any asset that can be exchanged for another one. For example, if you have a one dollars bill, it doesn't matter which dollar bill you have. If you meet someone on the street and say, hey, buddy, do you want to exchange my one dollars bill against yours? You're like, sure, and this is probably not a good idea, but you get the idea. The point is that it doesn't really matter which one dollars bill you have. So that's a fungible asset.
00:01:11.650 - 00:01:51.360, Speaker A: And the other kind of asset is a non fungible asset. So a non fungible asset is something that you cannot exchange for another one. Each of this asset is unique, and an example of that is a piece of art. If you have a famous painting of a famous penture, then you cannot exchange this painting against another painting. This is not the same worth. So basically, if you want to represent a fungible asset, you should choose ERC 20 standard. And if you want to model a non fungible asset, then you should choose ERC 721.
00:01:51.360 - 00:02:38.586, Speaker A: So example of this on the blockchain are a lot of ICO tokens. They use the YaS 20 standard and a lot of games to represent their ingame asset. They use YAS 721, like cryptokitties. Now the problem is that there are some cases where you want to have some group of assets. And so if you just have ES 20 and ES 721, you will need to deploy many of this smart contract. And very quickly, it will be very messy to deal with all these addresses. An example of that is in a game, for example, you can have a character and this character can own different items, but you would like to group all these assets, all these items in a single smart contract.
00:02:38.586 - 00:03:40.910, Speaker A: So that's why another ERC token standard was created. And that's ERC 1155 so with ERC 1155 you deploy your smart contract once and after you can dynamically create as many ERC 20 or as many ERC 721 as you want so you don't have to decide right away. It can be added dynamically after the smart contract is deployed and all of this sort of subtoken will be contained in the same spot contract. So in terms of management, that's much much easier. Actually, I've created a whole tutorial series about all the major token standards, and in particular I walk through the solidity code of each of these token standards so you can check it out on my channel. And if you want an easy way to remember the most important information about tokens, then I've created a cheat sheet with really the most important information. You can get it for free, just follow the link in description.
00:03:40.910 - 00:03:57.810, Speaker A: So do you have any question about which token you should use in your smart contract? Ask me in the comments down below. That's it for this video on which token standard you should choose for your smart contract. Thanks for watching and I'll see you for another video about blockchain. Bye.
