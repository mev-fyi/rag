00:00:25.200 - 00:00:56.750, Speaker A: Hello can you guys see me? I think we are live. Please tell me in the chat if you can see me. Hello everybody. 1212 is the sun working okay can you guys see me? I think we are live. Please tell me in the chat if you can see me. Hello everybody. Okay awesome.
00:00:56.750 - 00:01:32.920, Speaker A: Okay cool. So I have all my set up working. Great welcome for this training on how to become solidity developer. I'm super excited to see so many people in the chat where you guys are from. I see David, Christopher Campbell Kituloni, David J. Integ, Jose is Credo. Where are you guys from? I feel like we have people from all over the world.
00:01:32.920 - 00:02:33.980, Speaker A: This is great. So we are going to spend 1 hour together and at the end you will know the exact steps that you need to take to become a professional three et developer. You will know exactly the roadmap to follow, but I will also give you stories to inspire you and also tips and hacks that you can use to become a three et developer faster. If you are new here, I'm julian, your host and I've been a blockchain developer since 2017. I've worked with three ET smart contract every day since that time and I've also trained a whole army of developers with edoblogs with my YouTube channel which has crossed 10 million view 150,000 subscribers. So let me see the reaction in the chat. We have Phil from USA, Joseph from Texas, David New York City, Anurag Jean from France, Mihir, India, Malaysia, London.
00:02:33.980 - 00:03:04.710, Speaker A: Awesome. So I see a couple of questions already. We're going to do the question at the end so please stay until the end. Okay, so now we're going to continue with the agenda. So I'm going to share with you my nice presentation. Let me see. All right, so you guys should see my presentation now.
00:03:04.710 - 00:03:30.610, Speaker A: Let me see. We are at the very beginning here. Can you guys see? Let me see. Yeah, we are at the very beginning. Okay, awesome. So we going to get started. One sec.
00:03:30.610 - 00:03:57.598, Speaker A: So many window on my screen. Okay, finally. All right, so we're going to start with my story and how I became a block a three t developer. Okay, just 1 second. I skipped one part. All right. Yeah, finally.
00:03:57.598 - 00:04:33.842, Speaker A: So yeah, we're going to start with my story. Then I'm going to explain you how is the job market for solidity right now. Then I'm going to give you a full roadmap to learn solidity. So all the topics that you need to learn after that we're going to see how you can make money with solid because if you learn all these skills, it's because you want to monetize them at some point. And after, they're going to be the Black Friday offer. And finally, we're going to do all the question at the end. Okay, so we're going to start with my story, right? Yes.
00:04:33.842 - 00:05:10.050, Speaker A: I'm Julian from France, and as you can see, I used every cliche to make it clear. So I always wear a french hat with a baguette on my bicycle. And I grew up next to the Ethel tower, of course. No, I'm kidding. But when I started my career, I dropped my french baguette and my bicycle, and I went to Hong Kong. This is where I work in finance. And at that time, I thought that I would be the next wolf of Wall street.
00:05:10.050 - 00:05:55.682, Speaker A: But unfortunately, I failed. I was more like this guy who was led up from Lehman brothers. So my plan did not succeed. So I made a change in my plan, and I went in Taiwan to learn Chinese, and I wanted to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. And this is where I met a bunch of software developers who are digital nomads living in different countries. So I decided to learn coding because I was really inspired by their story, and I learned by myself. No boot camp, no outside help.
00:05:55.682 - 00:06:37.760, Speaker A: And looking back, not getting help was a mistake because it took me way too much time. But I made it. And for the first few years, life was okay. I love my job, but I wasn't making a lot of money. And one day I had enough. I thought, hey, who said that I have to be poor? So why I always hear about all these guys making six figure and I am not why I'm struggling with all these bullshit customers. Always going from small job to another small job, always hustling really hard to find the next project.
00:06:37.760 - 00:07:06.742, Speaker A: So I decided to get a full time job. And I had three criteria. It had to be six figures, so pay well. It had to be remote because I like to travel and live everywhere I want. And it had to be interesting because I don't want to do a job that I don't like, of course. So I applied everywhere, but I didn't hear anything back. Or when they did answer, it was just a polite rejection letter.
00:07:06.742 - 00:08:07.418, Speaker A: What should I do? I started to be a little bit more strategic, and I realized that I had to specialize in a specific niche, and I also had to build my personal brand to sell myself. So for the specialization, I chose solidity. And for my personal brand, I chose to use YouTube and LinkedIn. So I started to do a lot of different tutorial that I publish on all this platform and that really helped me to really grow my personal brand. And next six, roughly three months later, boom, I found my first full time job as a software developer. So that was a blockchain job. I had everything I wanted, six figure remote.
00:08:07.418 - 00:08:57.920, Speaker A: Interesting, mission accomplished. So here is me doing a conference shortly before I had that first blockchain job. But yeah, as soon as I had the right strategy, everything fell into place. So all about this is great, but what about now? Because we are in 2023, can we still find a solidity job in this market? So we are going to find out and we're going to start with the general state of the crypto market right now. So the market is up. Okay. It has not been the case for a while, but very recently, since the past few months, two months, we see a lot of optimism on the market.
00:08:57.920 - 00:09:34.394, Speaker A: We also see a lot of discussion around the crypto ETF. The Blackrock, a really big finance company, is applying for crypto ETF, another big one. Fidelity is doing the same. And we've been talking about this for years, but we really feel like this time it's different. Everybody can feel that it's coming within the next few months. And finally, the interest rates were increased very rapidly the past one year, two year. And right now we hit a level where it's not going to increase more.
00:09:34.394 - 00:10:20.578, Speaker A: And a lot of top economists expect that sometime within six months it's going to start to decrease again. And why all of this is really important because basically that means with all these elements in place, that means that we could have a bull run within something like by summer 2024. And so what you want to do is you want to be ready before the next bull market start, because when it starts, you will have much more opportunities. That's true. But you're also going to have much more competition. And to be competitive, you need to be in advance compared to others, which means you need to start before them. Okay, so the general crypto context is positive.
00:10:20.578 - 00:10:59.406, Speaker A: But what about now? Do we have a lot of solidity jobs at the moment right now? Not in six months. Right now. So yes, that is the bull market that might start in six months. So here, this is a study by a crypto job board. So if you type solidity job, you will find almost 3500 jobs. So that's really quite a lot, especially outside of a bull market. And sometimes some solidity jobs are with other keywords, like the blockchain keywords.
00:10:59.406 - 00:11:38.650, Speaker A: So we don't even see everything here in this study, on top of it, we estimate that two thirds of the job market is outside of job advertisement. This is what we call the hidden market. The hidden job market. So that means that right now, if we just see about 3500 series job, there might be 10,000 solidity job total. And this is before the bull market. That means that when the bull market starts, this number might be multiplied by ten. So yes, there are a lot of solidity jobs, and this is only going to get better.
00:11:38.650 - 00:12:04.886, Speaker A: Okay, but at what salary? Good question. So here is also a study from the same website. So roughly speaking, when you are a junior, you can start at $100,000, a little bit less. But if you can negotiate and if you have good skills, you can absolutely get that. This is what I got. And that was in 2017. So that was way before.
00:12:04.886 - 00:12:35.454, Speaker A: So $100,000 junior, this is doable. The average is 130,000. And if you are senior, it can go up to 250K. So that's according to the study. But sometime we see even more crazy salary, up to $500,000 per year. So granted, this is a little bit more rare, but if you are really senior in solidity, it can go really high. So these are some really good salaries.
00:12:35.454 - 00:12:55.930, Speaker A: And the reason why they are so high is because there is this imbalance between demand and offer. And most of these jobs are remote. So it doesn't matter where you live, you can travel the world while you work. As a solidity developer, this is what I do myself. I was in Taiwan one month ago, then I went to Thailand. I'm in France. I don't know where I will go next.
00:12:55.930 - 00:13:24.014, Speaker A: I haven't decided yet. But it doesn't matter because I can keep working. Everything is remote. Okay, so all of this is really cool. But before you can enjoy this, you need to learn solidity. What do you need to know exactly? So we are going to break it down. Okay, so there's really three technology that you need to master.
00:13:24.014 - 00:14:02.110, Speaker A: So ethereum, that's really the dominant blockchain nowadays. So don't get sucked into other narrative. Like right now, we hear something about Solanai waking up or whatever tech is on you rust, smart contract or no, everything happens on Ethereum, so just focus on that. And if it's not Ethereum directly, it's other blockchain that use the Ethereum technology. So just focus on that. Then second, solidity, the programming language for smart contract. And finally, right now, the smart contract framework that is the most used is foundry.
00:14:02.110 - 00:14:39.078, Speaker A: So this is a tool that allow you to build safe smart contract and test them. And you also need to master this. There were a lot of different smart contract frameworks, started with truffle, then we had hot hut. But nowadays it seems that everybody settle on this tool called fundry, and it doesn't seem like it's going to change. So this is really a good long term investment. All right, so next we're going to see more in detail what you need to know. So the first thing is to learn the Ethereum virtual machine, or just called EVM.
00:14:39.078 - 00:15:18.306, Speaker A: That's the part of Ethereum that runs the smart contract. And this is very different from other execution environments. So you need to take time to understand it very deeply. The second thing that you need to understand, of course, is the solidity language, but you need to have a deep understanding of it. On the surface it looks easy, but there are a lot of caveats, and most beginners don't go there. And so as a result, they cannot really find a full time job. You need to become really good at solidity, and one of the way to do that is by learning some patterns.
00:15:18.306 - 00:16:01.300, Speaker A: For example, how you update the smart contract, how you architect a large smart contract, if a customer asks you to implement some functionality, how you translate this in a smart contract, do you put everything in a smart contract? Do you spray it? Do you break it down into several ones? You need to know these things. Another thing very important is the testing of smart contract, because once you deploy it, it's impossible to change the code. So before you deploy it, you need to make sure that everything is very well tested. And the test coverage needs to be excellent, needs to be 100%. Every part of the smart contract needs to be tested. This is not something optional. This is extremely important.
00:16:01.300 - 00:16:39.282, Speaker A: You also need to know Yel and gas optimization. So Yel, this is basically a low level language within solidity. This is basically like assembly for solidity. And the first time you will see this, it will look a little bit scary, but you need to understand how it is. It's really how you make the difference between a junior and a senior. And this will allow you, among other things, to do gas optimization, which means that you will do smart contracts that consume less gas. And this is very important for big protocol that manipulate a lot of money.
00:16:39.282 - 00:17:28.490, Speaker A: And you also need to know about a real life smart contract. So you need to know the language of solidity itself. But you also need to know how you can use this for the main application, which are defi NFT, dao. So you need to know a few real life implementation so you can get inspired by them and use the same patterns. Okay, so that is what you need to know basically to become a professional solidity developer. But once you master solidity, the big question is how you can monetize your skills. So we are going to see this just now.
00:17:28.490 - 00:18:17.434, Speaker A: So of course the first and obvious way is to monetize as an employee. So you will work as a solidity developer for a company. And the big advantage is it provides you with the most stable salary, but the barrier to entry is a little bit higher. It's always a little bit more difficult to find a full time job compared to being a freelance. Freelance is easier to get started, but you also have to manage the marketing and we have demand both for freelance and from employers as well. And the third way is to be an entrepreneur. So if you want to build your blockchain project, you can leverage your solidity skills.
00:18:17.434 - 00:19:01.786, Speaker A: And this is very important because solidity developers are so expensive. It's better if you can code your own smart contract instead of hiring other people because unless you have a lot of money, this is going to be very difficult. All right, so now how you can position yourself on the job market. And this is very important to understand because if you don't have any specific positioning, it's going to be way harder to find a job. The first way is to be what we call a full stack blockchain developer. So you do the whole application, you do the front end, you also do the smart contract. If you do this, this is really good for small projects.
00:19:01.786 - 00:19:45.420, Speaker A: Small projects are looking for people who can do everything, but it also means that you need to learn more stuff and you also need to learn the front end react HTML CSs and maybe you don't want that. And this is also not the skill that is the rarest. So this is an interesting option, but not my preferred one. Then the second way to specialize is to be just a solidity developer. We typically will just do the smart contract. So typically you will work for blockchain protocols and you will just focus smart contract. There will be someone else who does the front end and so you can really leverage your skill at 100%.
00:19:45.420 - 00:20:29.626, Speaker A: If you do this, then another way is to do smart contract security. So no matter which specialization you want to follow, you need to be knowledgeable about security because this is a really big deal for smart contract. But you can position yourself as a specialist of this. So if you do this, your job will be to audit smart contract. So basically companies will pay you to make sure that their code is safe. And you can do this with competition. So we have all these contests right now, security contest, but you can also do audits which are outside of platform.
00:20:29.626 - 00:21:16.026, Speaker A: But this is a little bit difficult to get started. And of course, if you do smart contract security, this is where you can get the absolute highest salary, but you need to be knowledgeable in solidity after that. Another way to specialize yourself is to do a gas optimization. So you sell your service as someone who will optimize an existing code base so that it consume less gas. And we see some people who do this already. There is one guy on crypto Twitter that basically he built a whole freelancing business around this concept. So basically he took a subset of solidity development and hyper specialized in this.
00:21:16.026 - 00:21:41.950, Speaker A: That's very interesting. Another way is to specialize in a specific use case. So for example defi NFT or gaming. That's also very interesting. And finally, another way to specialize. So this one is a much smaller niche, but it can also pay a lot, is Mev. So this is for people who love trading.
00:21:41.950 - 00:22:36.900, Speaker A: And so there are all these trading strategies on the blockchain that uses some very unique trading strategies. And this is a mix of solidity, skill and also of trading skills and also of low level programming, because you need to be very good to do very fast program to do this. This is really a niche in the niche. Very few people do, smart contract developers do Mev. But it's also good to know that that is one of the possibilities. All right, so these are all the ways that you can specialize, but how do you actually find a job? So basically the first way will be, the easiest way, as I mentioned before, is to be a freelancer. You will go on freelancing platform.
00:22:36.900 - 00:23:11.310, Speaker A: There are a lot of them. And this is the easiest way to get started. You can apply to jobs. So you go on a job board, they are a crypto job board, like a crypto job list. Or you have also big job board, like you have the one on LinkedIn, you have another big one, which is indeed, and you'll find a lot of job there. Another possibility is if you want to tap the hidden job market, is to let people come to you. And so for that, for example, you can have a really good portfolio project on GitHub.
00:23:11.310 - 00:23:43.240, Speaker A: Another way is to contribute to open source project. This can open up to job opportunities. Another possibility to unlock the hidden job market is to do networking. So you will go to conferences to meetups or even better if you can be a speaker there, it's really something very powerful. And you can use personal branding. So this is basically what I'm doing where you are active on social media. You have either a YouTube, a LinkedIn profile, or you are active on.
00:23:43.240 - 00:24:21.938, Speaker A: Yeah. And if you do this, you have people reach out to you in your private messages. And this is how I got started. It takes more time to do this, but long term, this is absolutely the most powerful thing. Powerful way to get a job. Okay, so basically the next question is, do we stop here? Because I've already explained you everything. So should I just let you try your solidity career by yourself and we just end the live stream here? I could do this, but if I did this, I want you guys to be honest with me.
00:24:21.938 - 00:25:00.234, Speaker A: How many of you would actually do something? You would just say, hey, cool bro, nice story, but that's the end of it. So that's why I prefer to stay here and help you with a big surprise. So ladies and gentlemen, I'm very proud to introduce you the solidity boot camp for Black Friday. This is something that we're just going to do for Black Friday. We only do it one time. So with this boot camp, you will be able to become a solidity pro. So you will acquire a rare in demand skill.
00:25:00.234 - 00:25:28.202, Speaker A: This is very specialized. We're not going to waste time on the skills that don't pay that much like the front end. We're just going to focus on what pays the most. With this, you will be able to get a six figure job. With this new skill, you will be able to work remotely and you will be able to create your own blockchain project. So that is the objective of the boot camp. Now, this boot camp works with.
00:25:28.202 - 00:26:08.310, Speaker A: So this is the core curriculum, which will be live classes. So here, this is when the time of the boot camp is 1 hour per day, Monday to Thursday, and plus the homework. So you will need something like between five to 8 hours a week for four weeks to complete this bootcamp. And so we're going to do a deep dive into the EVM so you will understand exactly how smart contracts are executed. Then we're going to do some advanced solidity. So we're going to go way beyond what you find in video courses on YouTube, or even in my courses. We're going to go way deeper.
00:26:08.310 - 00:26:41.662, Speaker A: We're also going to see advanced 3d patterns like smart contract updates. We also going to see how to do advanced testing with foundry. And we also going to see yel. So the low level language of solidity and we're going to do gad optimization. So this is some advanced level smart contract that we're talking here. We're going to cover real life smart contract defi, NFT, Dow. So it's not going to be only theoretical.
00:26:41.662 - 00:27:27.646, Speaker A: They're going to be some real life applications. And finally, I'm going to show you the professional development process of a smart contract developer. So that means this is a core skill that most junior lack. So we're going to see what it would be like to work in a company. So when you work for someone, you will be given some requirements. For example, yeah, this is the feature that I want you to implement. How do you go from this requirement to the code? How does it work exactly? I'm going to show you the whole process, how you can break this down into several function, how you can put up together a professional development environment with continuous integration, for example.
00:27:27.646 - 00:28:18.160, Speaker A: And these are the skills that really make the difference. When you are in job interviews, if people ask you questions about this, it's very easy to know that you've never worked in a team, that you don't really know the whole process. And so with this bootcamp, you're going to get this competitive advantage compared to most other applicants. All right, so that's it for the live classes. And you're also going to have a lot of exercises that we're going to do and homework that you will have to do with this boot camp. So it's not going to be something just passive. All right, so in terms of technology, we're going to focus on ethereum solidity and fundry because these are the most in demand technologies and skills right now.
00:28:18.160 - 00:28:44.534, Speaker A: We're going to get a couple of bonuses. So one of the bonus is the code review. So you'll be able to submit your homework and I will give you feedback. I will tell you what is good, what is less good, how you can get better. And that is really a core difference with video courses. With a video course, it's pasted, you never get this feedback, but this feedback is crucial. It's how you learn.
00:28:44.534 - 00:29:16.654, Speaker A: So that is going to be a big help for your learning. Then you're going to get access to all the recordings of the lecture. So if you miss anything, you can still catch up. This will be uploaded on the platform. You will get access to our private discord. So more than 10,000 developer are in our private discord community. And last bonus, you will get a review of your CV, LinkedIn and GitHub.
00:29:16.654 - 00:29:50.158, Speaker A: So that is crucial. Just that will double your chances of getting a job because most people really suck at this, but we will give you professional feedback. All right, so what is the value that is being offered here? So just the core curriculum. I could easily charge 3000 for that. If you check out out there, how much solidity boot camp sell for? It starts at 5000 easy. So just this could be 3000. Then the code review.
00:29:50.158 - 00:30:12.734, Speaker A: This requires a lot of my personal time. I could charge another 3000 for that, no problem. I could charge for the lecture recording. So that's basically a video course. 250, no problem. Lifetime access to discord community. So this is a great way to expand your network to significantly improve your chances of getting a job.
00:30:12.734 - 00:30:46.254, Speaker A: Another 250, that would be worth it. And I could charge another 500 for the review of your CV, LinkedIn. Some people charge 1000, actually. So that is all the value that is contained in this boot camp. So if we add everything, that's a total of 7000. But this is Black Friday, so we are not going to do 7000. We are going to do 690.
00:30:46.254 - 00:31:13.110, Speaker A: Oh, sorry, this is a mistake. Actually. I've changed it to 597. So you see, it's even cheaper than what you see here. So it's 597. So that's basically 10% of the value that is being offered. And you get access to this only for Black Friday because this is valid until November 22.
00:31:13.110 - 00:31:42.850, Speaker A: So you basically have two days to register for this boot camp and after it's over. So if you want to register for the bootcamp. Edoblocks combocamp. I'm going to put this in. I'm going to put this in the chat in theblog.com bootcamp. Right, so let me see.
00:31:42.850 - 00:32:12.490, Speaker A: I'm going to pin this. How do I pin this? Righteous. All right, so you have the link in the chat. I'm trying to pin it to the chat. The UI of YouTube sucks. Okay. Pin messages.
00:32:12.490 - 00:32:49.826, Speaker A: All right, awesome. Let's continue. So I've had 15,000 students since 2017, and since we started in the blocks, and I want to give you a couple of feedback from students. So here. This student got a solidity job in two months. Just got a job offer today as a defi engineer. This another one? I've just found my first solidity job as a solidity developer.
00:32:49.826 - 00:33:16.638, Speaker A: You're a great guy, julian. Hey, Julian, thanks for the tutorial. I got two job offer from two employers because of you. All right. And last one, three t from Jacob at smart contract course. I'm a blockchain developer at biconomy, so that's a big API for blockchain. And I also want to give you some feedback from people who are entrepreneur who built their project.
00:33:16.638 - 00:33:52.330, Speaker A: So this developer from Microsoft took my training and gave us really good feedback. Someone else built this project. Future Swap, a DeFi protocol raised $1 million. And another student raised a lot of money and created another Defi project, secure finance. All right, so basically I want the next success story to be you. So to register for the bootcamp, edwox.com bootcamp.
00:33:52.330 - 00:34:22.258, Speaker A: And now I also want to address a couple of questions. We're going to do the Q a just after, but very briefly, some question that you may have. So does the solidity bootcamp covers everything you need to become a solidity developer? Yes. So this is comprehensive. You're going to learn everything from A to Z. Okay, so how much time I need to follow the boot camp? So this is going to be one month. And every week you will need between five to 8 hours to dedicate to this boot camp.
00:34:22.258 - 00:34:57.402, Speaker A: How long does it take to find a job as a CT developer? So each case is different. I would say somewhere between a couple of months to six months. Especially with the bull market that we expect to return next year, it will probably speed up the process. Can we find a job as a junior solidity developer? Yeah. So you need to start somewhere. There are some position. Of course, it's always easier to get started as a senior, but it's possible to start as a junior.
00:34:57.402 - 00:35:29.546, Speaker A: I started as a junior. Many of the students started as a junior. And we will do everything we can to improve your profile. This is why we offer a review of your GitHub profile, to really improve your chances. But you can make it if you are motivated and with our help you can make it. What are the prerequisites to take the boot camp? None of them, because we are just focused on solidity. So we're not going to waste time with other things like the front end, HTML, et cetera, so we can get started right away.
00:35:29.546 - 00:35:59.842, Speaker A: Will I get some help if I'm stuck in the boot camp? Yes, of course. So in a boot camp you get a lot of support, you can ask questions, you can get code review. So you're going to get a lot of service in this boot camp. What if I'm not happy with the program? Okay, so we offer a seven days money back guarantee. So there is zero risk. All right, so to register, eattheblocks, combootcamp. And the offer is valid until November 22.
00:35:59.842 - 00:36:48.370, Speaker A: So just today. All right, so now we are going to do the Q and A. So I'm going to show my face. All right. So I think that you guys can see my face right now. So, okay, so now what about, what about questions? Okay, so is there any question? Ah, so any question make, I was waiting for 35 minutes on my computer for it to start. Okay, that's really strange.
00:36:48.370 - 00:37:15.740, Speaker A: I don't understand. Really don't understand. Okay. Prerequisite language for this course. Yeah, no prerequisite. You can get started right away. Any other question? Any question what you need to get.
00:37:15.740 - 00:37:55.526, Speaker A: What kind of tool for testing do you provide? Okay, so me, I don't provide any tool myself. I cover some existing tool. So we will use fundry, which is the leading smart contract framework at the moment. This is what we will use. There are also some blockchain explorer that we can use, such as for example, tenderly can be very useful to debug live transactions, but mostly with fundry. Suppose you don't guarantee job lended. No.
00:37:55.526 - 00:38:25.554, Speaker A: So this is the Black Friday pricing. So basically you get a big discount. So we cannot guarantee a job, but you get a seven day money back guarantee. So there is basically no risk. And really if you follow the step, if you do everything we tell you to do. I've never seen any student who is not successful and just follow the step. The few people that end up not finding job is because they give up.
00:38:25.554 - 00:39:05.710, Speaker A: They are not motivated enough. But in majority of cases it goes very smoothly. All right, so Yannick, is it suitable with basic? Yeah, we don't even require this. So yeah, you're fine, you're fine. Any way you can share your networking ability to recommend the best student for referral employee? Yeah. So if I hear anything on my network, I happily pass on these leads to you guys. But really the objective of this boot camp is that you are autonomous.
00:39:05.710 - 00:39:50.254, Speaker A: What really matters is that you develop your skills. And because once you have these skills, everything, it's going to be much easier. I can also show you how you can do personal branding to really improve your chances. But I want you guys to be independent. I don't want you guys to rely on me. This is a long term skill that you will get, that you can monetize long term without my help. Can you get a job as a solidity developer without knowing previous development knowledge? Yeah, there are a couple of examples like this.
00:39:50.254 - 00:40:31.066, Speaker A: As long as you work hard, will you have installment plan in the future? No. How much cost if I develop sandwich? But yeah, this is not the topic. The topic is how to become a 3d developer. Anyway, if you are an entrepreneur and you want to hire people to do some blockchain project, you should learn solidity yourself because this is going to cost you so much money. Anyone who can do this will charge you so much. Tens of thousands of dollars, easy. So it's just better to learn solidity by yourself.
00:40:31.066 - 00:41:23.580, Speaker A: Being salesforce developer for three years, ten years experience with MS SQL, somehow relevant experience can help. Switching to blockchain solidity. Yeah, it always helped to have some previous background at dev. So yeah, it always helped. But in any case, you got a start somewhere, so just get started and you can do it. Before I was a WordPress developer, I was doing WordPress PHP, nothing to see with blockchain and I still made it, so it's really possible. All right, any other question guys? So just as a reminder, the URL to sign up edibleblocks.com
00:41:23.580 - 00:42:10.006, Speaker A: bootcamp. Okay, right here. Any other question guys, about the boot camp postchain please. What's your take? The new blockchain called Radix? Yeah, nothing special. I have low opinion of everything that is not ethereum because I'm really focused on outcome for my students and really most of the jobs are on solidity. I'm a python flexible channel, saying I'm a python developer, I can learn solidity. I'm very interested in blockchain.
00:42:10.006 - 00:42:34.142, Speaker A: Yeah, it's great. If you know Python already, this is a great start. Jean Jacqueline each course is replayed, so we will have recording of each session so you can rewatch them after. Alexander I mean, currently being a salesforce developer and have a deaf position, scary to switch. Okay, so scary. What if. No.
00:42:34.142 - 00:43:07.466, Speaker A: Boom. So basically you don't have to quit your job now. What you can do is just start to learn solidity right now and you can do some freelance gig here and there to try to have a sense of how is the market. You can also apply to job while you keep your job at Salesforce. So you basically don't have to take any risk. Me, whenever I made some changes in my career, it's how I made it. I was always very cautious.
00:43:07.466 - 00:43:28.418, Speaker A: So there is no need to take too much risk. YouTube what is the payment methods? You can pay with credit card, PayPal or with crypto as well. Period. Self paced course. No, that's a boot camp. So that this is going to be with live classes. It's going to be between November 27 to December 22.
00:43:28.418 - 00:43:49.414, Speaker A: Estimated time frame? Yes. So one month and you need about five to 8 hours per week. Alexander what payment method? Yes. Visa yes, USDT. So stablecoin, we accept stablecoin. You go on the landing page, then there is a link for crypto payments and we explain everything there post chain. Okay, thank you.
00:43:49.414 - 00:44:03.770, Speaker A: Man. Brazil is branny. Outdated. Not really outdated. It's just like it's not really used. So yeah, just nowadays everybody is on fundry fadi. For those who cannot afford a bootcamp, any free alternative.
00:44:03.770 - 00:44:45.820, Speaker A: So sometime on my channel I do tutorials. I have a lot of them. Unfortunately now a couple of them are outdated. So that's the problem of many free stuff gets outdated really fast. So with this boot camp, everything is up to date, basically flexible channel. Thank you very much for the answer. All right, guys, any other question about the boot camp? Any question you have about your solidity journey? So.
00:44:45.820 - 00:45:22.390, Speaker A: Okay, so here we have a question. Do you have any advice for smart contract auditor? Yeah, like work on your solidity skill. I see many guys jumping into security, but they are not very good at solidity. It actually help them make it more difficult for them to find bugs. So I would say don't jump the steps. Like if you're great at solidity, it's going to be way easier to find bugs. So start with solidity.
00:45:22.390 - 00:45:35.290, Speaker A: Alexander, let me see. YouTube is my jokey. Thanks, Julian. Love your video. Cool, thank you, man. Ryan, bro, you're amazing. Love your channel.
00:45:35.290 - 00:46:20.354, Speaker A: Awesome. Can we get a job after completing your blogs? Pro? Okay, so all my course, they're going to stop and right now we're just going to focus on the bootcamp. So yes, you can get a job after following one of my course. But right now the best thing to do is my boot camp because with my boot camp, we go way deeper and you get all this feedback that you don't get with a course. And that's really how you can get way better. That's how you can get more confidence that will allow you to get those jobs. Antonio, what? Blockchain work with Mev anything ethereum fad.
00:46:20.354 - 00:46:56.550, Speaker A: The average time to find job between three to six months, depending on specific situation. I find mine in three months, but I can't promise you the same outcome. Of course, having over a year of experience developing smart contract in rust doesn't make sense to switch to three DT and start over. It depends if you're satisfied with your career or not. If you enjoy what you're doing, you have enough work, then good for you. But just generally speaking, I find that the job market is much bigger for solidity. So if you want to give yourself more opportunities, that would be a good choice.
00:46:56.550 - 00:47:20.030, Speaker A: Get Celestia Airdrop and spending for blockchain bootcamp. Okay, so I don't accept for payment. I only accept a couple of stable coins. So the best would be to sell this token to an accepted stable coin and then you can join. Pream, I've already purchased your course. I don't have more money to enroll in bootcamp. Too bad.
00:47:20.030 - 00:47:44.840, Speaker A: Priya, differences between the bootcamp and the course. Okay, so the course are a little bit older and we are going to stop them. So courses, just forget about them. This is over now we're only going to do the bootcamp. So bootcamp is up to date. It's much more up to date, much more in depth. So we'll give you much better chance to get a job.
00:47:44.840 - 00:48:38.502, Speaker A: Brazil, is there any other language for Solana development? Just forget about Solana Polana. The ecosystem is just very small. Paddy, what's the cost? I just joined. The cost of the boot camp is 600 if you take the premium package. Yeah, right. Thx, I haven't heard of celestia airdrop. You guys, any question about the bootcamp? Any question how to get started in solidity before the bull market start? No? Are we done with all the question? All right, so I'm going to paste one more time the link.
00:48:38.502 - 00:49:09.554, Speaker A: So that's in theblocks combocamp. So the Black Friday offer is valid until November 22. Okay, so if you want to get started, join now. We're only going to do the bootcamp for Black Friday, so this is special Black Friday pricing. So this is your chance. Most bootcamp cost way more than what I will charge you, so you will get ton of value. Priyam, your content is really good.
00:49:09.554 - 00:49:28.690, Speaker A: Thanks for the efforts, man. Thank you. Priyam, I really appreciate. Rian Csni, Chinese. Awesome. Which means thank you in Chinese. All right, well, I guess we are done here.
00:49:28.690 - 00:49:49.450, Speaker A: So if you guys have questions after the live stream, you can still reach out to me. Julian, edoblocks.com put this in the chat. Thanks everybody for joining this live stream and I hope to see you for the boot camp. Have a good day, everybody. Bye.
