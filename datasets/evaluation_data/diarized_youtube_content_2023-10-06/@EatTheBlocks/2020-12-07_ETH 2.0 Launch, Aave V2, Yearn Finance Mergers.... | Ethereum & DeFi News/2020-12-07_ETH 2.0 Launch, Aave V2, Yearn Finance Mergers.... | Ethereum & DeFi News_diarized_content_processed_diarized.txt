00:00:04.090 - 00:00:24.746, Speaker A: And we are live and my mic is not ready. Congrats, Julian. Okay, okay, 1212, do you guys hear me well? Yes no. Yes no. Tell me in the chat if the sound is okay. Okay, test Mike. So welcome for this weekly live stream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi.
00:00:24.746 - 00:00:57.562, Speaker A: I do this every Monday at 10:00 a.m. East coast time. So in this video, a lot of super important news. Ethereum 2.0, which was officially launched last week with the start of the Beacon chain Ave V two, which is launching Wall street, which is launching a new crypto index and many, many other super important stuff. But of course, the main piece of news is Ethereum 2.0. And we'll do the Q and A at the end as usual.
00:00:57.562 - 00:01:28.594, Speaker A: So if you don't know me, I'm Julian, your host, and on my channel idoblogs, I teach blockchain development. So very important. My course on D five programming is going to be released on December 20. I'm about to show you some exclusive previews. So if you want to see some of these previews, you have to register with the link down. No, not the link down below. I put it in the chat, but after I will edit the description.
00:01:28.594 - 00:01:37.050, Speaker A: I'll put the link in the description as. Okay, okay. So, hi to everybody in the chat. Hi ThX.
00:01:37.390 - 00:01:38.090, Speaker B: Hi.
00:01:38.240 - 00:02:03.902, Speaker A: Xavier was telling me the sound is great, great. So we are going to start with the price of ether. So another week, which is very flat. So although Ethereum 2.0 started, it was already priced in. So that's why we don't see any big movement. It was already priced in when we reached the validator threshold on November 24.
00:02:03.902 - 00:02:34.110, Speaker A: It's still possible that we reach $1,000 at the end of the year or in the next few months. So yeah, nothing too crazy to announce this week for the price of ether for gas price. There is really no movement here. It's really flat. So if you're going to do some D five trades, some yield farming, it's not going to cost you an arm and a leg, unlike this summer. So it's good news. And of course we are going to talk of Ethereum 2.0.
00:02:34.110 - 00:02:57.606, Speaker A: So Ethereum 2.0 officially started with the first block mined on December 1, 12:00 p.m. 35 2nd. Yes, very important to know the exact second. Let's go through the parameters of an ethereum 2.0 block. So here you see the slot number.
00:02:57.606 - 00:03:18.662, Speaker A: So this is basically the slot is a period of time where a block can be mined. I think a slot is 12 seconds. Then an epoch number. Yes. So that epoch number, I'm not too sure about that one. Finalized. This means that, okay, so on ethereum 2.0,
00:03:18.662 - 00:03:43.154, Speaker A: a block have an additional status. So finalized, that means there won't be any reorganization of the blockchain in the future. That means we know 100% that this block will be inside the blockchain. Whereas for Ethereum 1.0, there can be a reorganization at every time. But of course, the very old block, it's almost impossible that there will be a reorganized. But in Ethereum 2.0,
00:03:43.154 - 00:03:48.600, Speaker A: there is really this concept of finalize. So that gives you some additional guarantee that the data won't change.
00:03:49.530 - 00:03:49.894, Speaker B: Yes.
00:03:49.932 - 00:04:11.334, Speaker A: You can see how long ago it was mined. You can see the address of the proposer. So it's like the miner, basically. Yes. So block root hashes. Basically, it's how it's related to the previous block. That's how we can maintain the integrity of the blockchain state roots.
00:04:11.334 - 00:04:34.498, Speaker A: This is related to the state of all the smart contract. But for now, the state on ethereum 2.0, it's empty. Renda reveal. So that one, I'm not too sure, but I think this is related to the decentralized random number generation mechanism. So that's something super advanced. That's like super advanced crypto that Ethereum 2.0
00:04:34.498 - 00:04:59.162, Speaker A: rely on. Then we have this graffiti. So this is basically a piece of data of 32 bytes in every block where you can put whatever data you want. And so we saw this concept of graffiti where. So here the miner basically said, yeah, Mr. F was here. After we have some reference to Ethereum one.
00:04:59.162 - 00:05:40.926, Speaker A: So it references basically the block where the validator of this block made the deposit for 32 ether in Ethereum one. And also we can see here the number of this validator. So, depending on when you deposit your staking ether on e one, you have a number which is assigned to you. And then this is the signature of the validator. And here's some information about whether or not this validator was slashed. So you have this concept of proposer and attester. So you have one proposer per block.
00:05:40.926 - 00:06:13.650, Speaker A: It's basically one of the validator that is picked at random by the blockchain. And this validator put the data of the blockchain. So, of course, all of this is done automatically by the software. It's not like one guy who said, okay, which transaction I want to put inside this block? It's not like this. So you have this proposer that creates the data, and after you have a bunch of attestors. So other validator that have another special role that will put their attestation. So they say, okay, we think that this block is valid.
00:06:13.650 - 00:07:10.646, Speaker A: If anyone attest, put the attestation on the block that is not valid, they're going to be slashed, they're going to lose some ether. So here you can see that there were 788 validator, sorry, attestor. So I wanted to show you actually this concept of gravity in the block is not the first one. So in the Genesis block of blockchain, there was always also some space for some arbitrary data. And so Satoshi basically put this, some article of newspapers at the Chancellor on brink of second bailout for bank. So it's basically a reference to the financial crisis in 2008. So then I want to show you a couple of interesting statistics for Ethereum 2.0.
00:07:10.646 - 00:07:55.762, Speaker A: So first, the participation rate is 98, 99%, which is above expectations. So it means that the registered validators, they do their work of validator, there are very few people slacking off. So it's very good. Then in terms of the number of active validators, we have a 26,000 something, which is to be compared with on Ethereum with 11,000 something. So we already have many more validators on Ethereum 2.0. And this is actually related to the design of ETH two. So the physical requirements to run a node are much lower than for Ethereum one.
00:07:55.762 - 00:08:37.460, Speaker A: So the huge benefit of that is that pretty much everybody can run a node on your laptop, for example. And because of that, the network can be much more decentralized compared to ETH one, where most of the miners are just run by a couple of mining companies. So it's not so decentralized. So it's expected in the future that we'll have hundreds of thousands of validators for two or even millions. The network can work with so many validators. So of course, when we reach that kind of scale, it will be really impossible to shut down Ethereum. We will really reach this crazy goal of becoming the world computer.
00:08:37.460 - 00:09:17.150, Speaker A: Then let's check the other stats. So yeah, you can see here the current slot, active validator. Oh yes. So you can see also how many validators are pending, because basically there is a daily limit on the number of validators. So you need to wait. If there are too many people, then you can see the different blocks that were mined with how long ago, how many attestation. Actually, if you do view all, you can have even more data.
00:09:17.150 - 00:09:54.054, Speaker A: You can see the graffiti also, I believe. Yeah, you can see some graffiti here. Yeah. So for now these blocks are empty. But what matters is that these blocks are being mined and there is no problem on the network. Okay, so next I want to show you how many ether were staked. So there is one about how many? Let's see, let's see the stats.
00:09:54.054 - 00:10:26.230, Speaker A: Yeah. More than 1 million ether that were staked. And so that means that currently with 1 million ether staked, you can earn about 14% if you become a validator. And it will keep going down to 4% as we have new validators who keep coming in. So there is this limit of 900 new validators per day. So we actually have a waiting list of seven days for new validators. There have been three slashing events.
00:10:26.230 - 00:11:15.514, Speaker A: So that means either when you validate a bad block or when you don't validate even though you are supposed to validate. So basically when you are offline and these reslashing events were all by stakers, by a pool known as an anchor staking pool. Sorry. So basically why they got slashed, because they were running their keys, the same keys, same validator keys on multiple machines. So you must avoid to do this at all cost. If you think, oh, it's going to make my validator more reliable. No, because basically with the same key, you're going to sign twice the same block and it's going to make you be slash.
00:11:15.514 - 00:11:47.086, Speaker A: You're going to lose part of your ether. Okay, so now what if you want to become a validator? So there are different way to do it. One way is to run your own validator. So you can check out my tutorial on e two, staking on my channel. I have a full tutorial. You don't need to be a programmer, but still it's going to be a bit more technical than doing a few clicks. And you will have to use the command line.
00:11:47.086 - 00:12:24.166, Speaker A: But it's doable if you just follow the instructions. The big advantage of staking yourself is that you can get the whole staking reward. And the alternative to this is to use a staking service, like rocket pool, for example. So it's easier when you use a staking service, but you need to trust them that they will keep running their validators properly. And you also need to trust that they will keep their withdrawal keys safely. Otherwise your stake is going to be stolen and you also have to pay some fees. So there is rocket pool.
00:12:24.166 - 00:12:59.362, Speaker A: It's one of the most famous staking pool. And what's really great with them is that they give you some tokens in exchange of your stake, what they call re. So that's a new thing, a new token, and this represents your stake on Ethereum 2.0. And you can use this token in other Defi protocol. So it was just launched very recently. So currently it's not accepted as a collateral by any other Defi protocol, but very soon it's going to be the case. So you can basically make your stake more liquid.
00:12:59.362 - 00:13:28.190, Speaker A: There is also another staking service called. I think I closed the window. Okay, 1 second. All nodes. Yeah, another staking pool. There is also Coinbase, which is launching its staking service and I think other centralized exchanges are also working on this. So you're going to see, yeah, pretty much all of them offering this feature.
00:13:28.190 - 00:14:10.902, Speaker A: And you can also build your own staking service. Actually I have another tutorial on my channel about this and so that allow you to make money off the service basically. And on this topic I also wanted to show you an API of consensus that allow you to build your staking service more easily. But this is for institutional, so I don't think this is suited for a small project. Yeah, when you see the keyword institutional means it's going to be expensive. So then I wanted to give you a brief tour of the different tools you can use for Ethereum 2.0 and the beacon chain.
00:14:10.902 - 00:14:47.382, Speaker A: So first you have Ethereum two launch pad. So if you want to become a validator, you have to use this website. Then you have the beacon chain explorer of Ether. Scan to this allow you to explore the blockchain of Ethereum 2.0. You have another blockchain explorer for the beacon chain called Beaconcha in. And I like the graphic here. Next I want to explain basically what's the consequence for eth one.
00:14:47.382 - 00:15:10.974, Speaker A: So for now you have nothing to worry about. You can just keep your ether, except if you want to become a validator. If you are a developer, you can keep building your smart contract and your Dap like before. Don't wait for Ethereum 2.0 to come out, don't wait for it. Before you start to learn and build on Ethereum. First, we don't know exactly when the full migration is going to be over.
00:15:10.974 - 00:15:35.810, Speaker A: And second, Ethereum 2.0 will be backroad compatible with Ethereum 1.0. So everything you learn for eth one will be reusable with e two. So very important to know this. So let's see, what are the next phases of e two? Let me see, where did I put this. Okay, yeah. Here are the different phases.
00:15:35.810 - 00:16:28.330, Speaker A: So right now we have completed phase zero, which is the beacon chain. So we have a validator and stakes, and we have the beacon chain, but we cannot do much. So in about nine to twelve months, according to Jolibin, the founder of consensus, according to Jollibin, phase one is going to launch in 912 months. And so with phase one, we're going to launch shards. So shards, they are the different sort of small piece of blockchain that will compose Ethereum too. At that point, we will not be able to run our smart contract yet. We will just be able to do some transfer of ether between validators, but no smart contract yet.
00:16:28.330 - 00:16:59.250, Speaker A: And after, in maybe two to three years, we will have the execution environment. So that will be the complete migration from east one to east two. So we will be able to use a smart contract on every shard send transaction. Plus the migration of ether from ether one to ether two. But this is still in research and development. Okay, so that's it for the future of Ether. Oh no.
00:16:59.250 - 00:17:39.230, Speaker A: So there is this roadmap of Vitalik. We explain basically what we have accomplished and what is yet to be accomplished. If you want a more specific picture, you can check it out. That seems pretty complex. Oh yeah. So quick anecdote, actually, Ethereum has now more validators than bitcoin. So this is quite important because even though we just launched ethereum two, so you could think that maybe it would take some processing power of ethereum one, but apparently not really.
00:17:39.230 - 00:17:58.886, Speaker A: So, yeah, good for Ethereum. Okay, so that's it for ethereum two. So next we're going to continue with the news about defi. So first, the Defi market. So we are at 14.8 billion. So that's 1 billion more than last week.
00:17:58.886 - 00:18:41.762, Speaker A: Finally, ethereum start to flow again in Defi. So I did some research because I wanted to make sure what's the reason for the ether outflow. And so I confirmed what I said before. So the outflow of ether we saw before was because of the different hack that happened in Defi project recently, the declining yield farming incentive. And so what happened is the money partially went to staking on e two and also went in staking for other blockchain protocol. But now it start to come back, so it's good. What's interesting to note is that the market cap of uniswap is way down.
00:18:41.762 - 00:19:18.346, Speaker A: Oh, wait a second, let me change this to dollar. Yeah, so it's way down. Yeah, it's actually not too far from sushiswap now because uniswap liquidity mining incentive stopped a couple of weeks ago. So a lot of liquidity went out of uniswap. So it's now very urgent that they restart another liquidity mining incentive if they won't get back in the game. And actually discussing this maker, Dao became the top Defi project. It was actually the case for a long time, especially at the beginning of the DFI industry.
00:19:18.346 - 00:19:59.674, Speaker A: Okay, so next we're going to see the winner and the loser for DeFi tokens. So this week is another week of crazy gains. So with like 200% for the unit protocol, the COVID protocol. So insurance on blockchain 172%, Saffron finance 140%. So the situation is super volatile for Saffron. Two weeks ago he went up a lot because he was featured for the first time in coin market cap. Then he went down a lot and nights back up like crazy again.
00:19:59.674 - 00:20:35.910, Speaker A: So careful with saffron finance seems to be extremely volatile. Then what else do we have? We have sushi, like some defi food token that went up like crazy, like sushi cake, cream, pickle went up a lot. We have Acropolis also went up a lot. As for losers, as for losers. So we don't have so many losers this week. And the magnitude of the loss is way smaller than for the gain. So yeah, another really good week for crypto.
00:20:35.910 - 00:21:18.002, Speaker A: Okay, so next, let's see what's happening on the rate side. So the best we can do, we can have some nice 6% on Dai and DyDX, almost 6% with USDC on Ave and tether compound. Tether on compound, like kind of 2%. Yeah, not great tether. It's always a bit less for tether. So actually, I realized I said something wrong before, so I always complain about the fact that on compound the rates are always lower than for other DeFi protocols. But I forgot to take into consideration that we have the comp token rewards for compound.
00:21:18.002 - 00:21:51.758, Speaker A: So the actual yield of compound is higher than what you see here. So it might actually be competitive with Ave and Duidx. Okay, so that's it for the general market situation. So now we're going to continue with a specific news for D five project. So first, Ave protocol V two has just launched. So what is Ave? This is a lending protocol that launched its V one at the beginning of this year. So protocol quickly grew to over 1 billion market cap in less than six months.
00:21:51.758 - 00:22:36.126, Speaker A: So that was really a record growth for the defi space until Sushi swap. Sushi swap grew even faster than this. So V one brought some market innovations like the flash loans, as well as the delegated credit lending. Last week, the avid protocol hit another major milestone with 1 billion in flash loan volumes. So because there is a 0.9% fee for flash loan, it has actually created almost $1 million of reward for depositors. So if you deposit your money on Ave, you benefit from the flash loan feature, because you get some fee from that.
00:22:36.126 - 00:23:26.538, Speaker A: So there are a ton of new feature. So let's see them. First of all, collateral swap. So what's the use case for that? So let's say that you take a loan on Ave with a collateral, and this collateral is very volatile, and you need to top up your collateral or you're going to be liquidated. What you may want to do is to swap this collateral with another one, like a stable coin, which will prevent you from being liquidated, and you don't have to add new collateral. So you can already do this with a flash loan, but it requires to do four transactions total. So now you have a new feature which basically under the hood uses a flash loan.
00:23:26.538 - 00:24:01.270, Speaker A: So you can swap your collateral very easily just with one click. Now, it's super simple. So yes, it's big improvement in terms of usability. Then another one is flash liquidations. So with flash liquidations. So previously a liquidator need to have capital in their own wallet if he or she wants to do a liquidation and get the liquidation bonus. With a flash loan, you don't need any capital.
00:24:01.270 - 00:24:32.050, Speaker A: You can do liquidation, and even if you have absolutely zero capital, but this does require some technical skill. You need to combine several transactions. So now they have a feature that allow you to do a liquidation even without any capital under the hood. Once again, it uses the flash loan feature. So some usability improvement here. Then you have a batch flash loan. So with v one flash borrower could only borrow one currency at a time.
00:24:32.050 - 00:25:04.970, Speaker A: But now with batch flash loan, basically you can take a flash loan with multiple assets inside the same transaction. So it's much more flexible than before. If you want to do some more complex arbitrage, then you have debt tokenization. I think this one is super important. So in v two, all your debt position will be tokenized. So borrowers will receive tokens that represent their debt. And so after you can use this token in other defi protocols, sell it, et cetera.
00:25:04.970 - 00:25:41.450, Speaker A: So this is not the first project that do this. Recently we started some project that do a mix of NFT and deFi, and they all do the same thing. They basically want to sort of tokenize your defi position, so they turn your lp token into some sort of NfT that you can use more easily. So this is something that we see more and more in a Defi protocol. Next, let me see, what do we have. So we have some gas optimization. So up to 50% less gas consumption in some cases.
00:25:41.450 - 00:26:15.166, Speaker A: We also have stable and variable rate borrowing. So with ave v two, so you can have both a stable borrow position and a variable position at the same time with the same underlying assets. Yes. Part of your borrow is fixed rate. The other one is variable rate. So it's even more flexible than before. And when it comes to the migration for v two, so it's going to be done with a flash loan, they're going to migrate your position really easily.
00:26:15.166 - 00:26:50.142, Speaker A: The migration tool will be introduced later. So if you have a v one position now on Ave, no need to close them. Just wait for the migration tool and you'll be able to go to ave V two. And in terms of audits, they have been audited by many companies, four companies total, plus an audit report in Chinese. So this is to help to convince the chinese user. And they also have a lot of native integration. Let me see, where is this? Where are the native integration? Oh yeah.
00:26:50.142 - 00:27:43.030, Speaker A: So a lot of tools will give native integration with Aave, Azure, Zapper, Zarion. So these are basically tools to allow you to manage your DeFi protocol from several defi protocol from one place. So this is super important because these tools, it's a little bit like the equivalent of the App Store for DeFi app if you want, because you have many DeFi users, they don't want to bother to go to each individual website like Aave, Compine, Uniswap. They just use some tool like this, like Arjon Zapper, et cetera. So if your defi project and you are accepted on one of these projects, it's a big win. It's a bit like when a mobile app is featured on top of the App Store, it's same id. Okay, so that's it for the news about Ave.
00:27:43.030 - 00:28:16.326, Speaker A: So next I'm going to cover another merger of yearn. So Yern Finance and Acropolis will merge. So this comes after already four merger last week. So yarn finance, keep on the madness. So yarn finance, what is this? This is a yield aggregator project of Andre Connor. It's like this flagship project. And Acropolis, this is a multiproduct DeFi protocol with yield optimization and under collateralized loans.
00:28:16.326 - 00:28:59.210, Speaker A: So part of Acropolis kind of overlap with yield finance. So with the merger, Acropolis will move its yield optimization product as a yield farming strategy on yarn finance V two. And Acropolis developers will be able to build their strategy using the tools from the yarn ecosystem, including cream lending protocol that they recently integrated as well. And from the point of view of the yen protocol. So Acropolis will bring its expertise in a business development. It will bring its institutional contacts as well. So yeah, I think there is some synergy in this merger.
00:28:59.210 - 00:29:59.446, Speaker A: And Acropolis will also deprecate their own product related to yield generation, so there won't be any competition between the two. It basically seems like at this stage, you have a lot of yield farming DeFi protocol that are moving to yearn finance. So we can clearly see a movement of consolidation in the industry. These kind of things, when they start to happen, they tend to be some sort of self reinforcing movement. So when you see that kind of trend, it basically means that very quickly it's game over for competitors. You have more and more projects that join yon Finance, except if there is a major hack or like Andre cone, quit the project. I'm quite bullish on Yon Finance in general for the project, for the price of the token though of Yun Finance Wi Fi.
00:29:59.446 - 00:30:43.638, Speaker A: This is different because when you have a merger, the stock price of the acquirer always goes down and the stock price of the company that is acquired goes up. So actually, this is why the price of Acropolis went up this week. So the big question is, which other projects are likely to have a merger or a partnership with Yarn Finance? Because for sure it will make their token price goes up. So then we have another merger of yearn. So yearn and Sushiswap. So I don't know what happened in the title. It seems like Andre Korne, I kind of want to have some fun with japanese kanji.
00:30:43.638 - 00:31:25.030, Speaker A: So this time, the target of the acquisition is actually larger than yearn itself. The merger is going to combine both market total locked value, what we call a TLV. And both protocol will also share the developer resources and hold each other token in their treasuries. And so Andre Konohe, he has spoken with the leader of sushi swap. So the programmer that we call. So both community will have to confirm the merger with a vote. So on the discord channel of Sushiswap, it seems like the community is pretty much in favor of this.
00:31:25.030 - 00:32:04.942, Speaker A: So yeah, it seems it's going to proceed. So what do I think about this merger? Okay, so let me quote Andre about Sushiswap he said, I cannot overstate how much they have done right. In the past weeks of interacting with Zero X Mackie, I have developed immense respect for the character capabilities and execution. Yeah. But at the same time, he said yearn needed custom Amm experience for their strategy. So it seems like yarn finance really, to have a merger with a decentralized finance protocol, with a decentralized exchange protocol. And maybe they didn't really have a choice.
00:32:04.942 - 00:32:51.758, Speaker A: Maybe Sushiswap was the best that they could have. I mean, Sushiswap doesn't have a great track record. Like as you guys are aware, a couple of months ago there was this huge problem where one of the core developer of sushi swap tried to get away with $12 million. In the end, most of it was returned, but there was a huge loss of confidence in sushi swap. The fact that this is an anonymous project, I've never been a fan of sushiswap and I don't really understand what's the synergy between Yern and sushi. Between Yern and Acropolis I understand, but yarn and sushi, I don't really see it. Not too excited about this merger.
00:32:51.758 - 00:33:23.934, Speaker A: But anyway, that's why the price of sushi swap went up this week, because of this news. So now we're going to talk of a new feature of one inch. So one inch is, how do we call this, a decentralized exchange aggregator. So it allow you to get the best price across all decks. You don't need to basically shop around and compare all the price. You just send your order to one inch and then they figure it out. So they launch a new feature to avoid front running.
00:33:23.934 - 00:34:16.830, Speaker A: So front running is basically when someone on the blockchain figure out a profitable transaction that you are sending, and basically they send their own transaction with a higher gas fee with the same parameter. And basically they make the money instead of you. So that's a big problem, especially for liquidations. So basically what inch is going to do to avoid this is going to submit your transactions directly to miners to avoid some front runners. But this is not a foolproof solution because miners can front run you as well. So we start to see more and more attempts to mitigate the problem of front running. So I think that we're probably going to get rid of it sometime next year because it seems like a major problem in Defi.
00:34:16.830 - 00:35:04.880, Speaker A: Then some news of the Yuma protocol that launches the gas future. So Yuma is an advanced Defi protocol to build some synthetics assets. So it's a little bit like the synthetics protocol, but on steroids. So here with this new feature, they're trying to solve the problem of a variable gas price. The gas price changes all the time and so we have to deal with this as a user and it's really not optimal. So it's not the first project who tried to tackle this problem of a variable gas price. There was already gas tokens in the past, but the gas token posed a problem because they clogged the Ethereum blockchain with a lot of data.
00:35:04.880 - 00:35:44.986, Speaker A: It was actually so much a problem that there was an Ethereum improvement protocol, what we call an EIP. There was an EIP that was created just to prevent gas token from working in Ethereum in the future. So yeah, clearly the community is trying to find other solution to this variable gas price problem. And so yeah, maybe that the solution is this gas feature. So let's see if there is any adoption on this. So then news from Nexus Mutual, which launches an insurance for crypto. So Nexus mutual is a crypto insurance project.
00:35:44.986 - 00:36:09.920, Speaker A: It's not the first product. And so with this product, they will basically offer a cover for users who put their funds in an organization which keep their private key. So with this insurance, if your custodian get hacked and lose more than 10% of the.
00:40:45.000 - 00:41:29.712, Speaker B: It working now? Is it working now? Okay, yeah, I switched to the mic of my computer. So yeah, it's a bit more shitty than the other one. Yeah, I've bought this other mic like a couple of weeks ago, but yeah, it seems like he has some issues. So I think for the next live stream I'm going to switch back to my blue JT because it seems a little bit more reliable. Okay, so everybody's telling me it works again. Guys, so sorry about this. Oh my God.
00:41:29.712 - 00:42:09.910, Speaker B: I think I need a better set up. Okay, so let's go back to where we were at. Thank you so much for telling me this, by the way, because otherwise I can speak forever. Right, okay, so we were talking of compound finance. No, compounder finance. Yeah, so I think I said everything about that one then. Okay, so then, okay, so some news about visa partners.
00:42:09.910 - 00:42:34.900, Speaker B: Visa, sorry. So Visa will partner with Circle to help card issuers to integrate USDC. So basically merchant will be able to spend and receive the stablecoin USDC. So there are 60 million merchant on the visa network. So yeah, it's very good. It's basically super bullish for Ethereum and D five. This is super good.
00:42:34.900 - 00:43:30.098, Speaker B: It kind of reminds me of the integration of PayPal, but this one is actually even better. Okay, so next, another news for the SMP that will launch some crypto indices in 2021. So what is SMP? So this is a major financial data firm. They provide many indices that are very used in finance, like the SMP 500. So they said that we've been watching the digital asset space and we feel it's at a point of institutional interest in a maturity where companies such as ours want to get in and contribute to the transparency of the marketplace. So it's not the first crypto index from Wall street. They are already the Bloomberg Galaxy crypto index that has provided quotes for liquid crypto since 2018.
00:43:30.098 - 00:44:22.434, Speaker B: And the Nasdaq also has listed a couple of crypto indices in the past few years. But SMP is very, very high profile. So it's a very bullish signal. Okay, so next, some news, some regulatory news, a bit bearish, unfortunately. So a Democrat congresswoman proposed a new law, that stable act, to create regulations against stable coins and running a node. And yeah, it's really weird. I think she tweeted about it and she said, yeah, we need to protect minorities against crypto, but it doesn't make any sense because stablecoin, I think one of the main benefit of crypto and stablecoin, it can give access to minority who don't have access to banking.
00:44:22.434 - 00:44:55.310, Speaker B: So the way she justified is just total bullshit. So let's hope that she's trying to act in good faith and she's just uninformed. But really bad move from the new administration. I don't like it. Then another negative move from the new administration. So someone from the House banking committee. So it's basically a part of the Congress in the US that deals with banking regulation.
00:44:55.310 - 00:45:32.620, Speaker B: They asked Biden to repeal some crypto friendly rule of the OCC. So OCC, I already talked about it in a previous livestream. It's the office of the Controller, something some regulators for bank in the US. And the director was super bullish for Crypto, was super crypto friendly. And apparently that guy started to piece off a couple of people, a couple of politics. So yeah, it seems like Democrats are pretty against crypto, not to say that Republicans are for crypto. I think both of them are against it, actually.
00:45:32.620 - 00:46:36.830, Speaker B: But yeah, so negative news and then we're going to switch to news for developers. So Infura bought a service called any sender and he rebranded this as something called infura transaction or ITX. So what was any sender? So any sender was a transaction, relaying service and with ITX. So this thing, inferior transaction service, this new thing, so developers will be able to send transactions without having to worry about setting the right gas price. So they will do the optimization for you. You also benefit from the infrastructure of infrared that makes sure that your transactions are republished with a competitive gas price rather than just getting stuck or dropped from the network pool. And yet you will submit the transaction to Ethereum only once and pay the minimum gas possible required.
00:46:36.830 - 00:47:19.934, Speaker B: And you can also pay for the gas of a transaction on behalf of users. So that one is super important because maybe you have many users who are willing to use some DAP, but they don't want to buy some crypto. So maybe they can pay first with their credit card and then they have some sort of credit. And with this credit we can use it to pay for gas fee. So it's going to improve the user experience of decentralized applications. So just for the little story, any sender is a project that was built by two developers and I think they made this pretty quickly in like maybe one or two years. So yeah, I mean that's the kind of success story that can happen when you build your project.
00:47:19.934 - 00:48:09.050, Speaker B: You can have another bigger project that buy your project. So we don't know the acquisition price, but I'm pretty sure it's probably a few hundred thousand. And sometime you have what we call Aqua hire. So a company that acquire you, so you have this huge check and on top of it they also hire you as an employee after, so you still keep a stream of revenue. So yeah, you have really many ways of leveraging your skills at the blockchain you offer. So next I want to show you a new project called Radical, which is basically a decentralized GitHub. And they just released their first release.
00:48:09.050 - 00:48:42.486, Speaker B: So why this thing is important. So the git protocol itself, this is decentralized. But when you work in a team, you always have a centralized git repository and most people, they don't want to manage it. They also want to have a couple of tools around it. So that's why we use GitHub. So GitHub has become this super huge company and they were acquired by Microsoft and so they started to become more and more corporate. And there was a move recently that wasn't very cool.
00:48:42.486 - 00:49:13.682, Speaker B: They basically blocked the access of GitHub to Iran users. So yeah, developers in Iran, they cannot use GitHub anymore. So so far it's the only case of sort of abuse of their centralized power. Oh yeah. Recently also I saw on hacker News there was another news like they took down the repository of this project to download video from YouTube. It's called a YouTube DL. It's not something to steal content, it's something that has a very legitimate use case.
00:49:13.682 - 00:49:55.610, Speaker B: And yeah a lot of people were using this but they received some DMCA. It's like some sort of lawyer threat basically to take down this repo and they did it and many people were really pissed. So yeah there were a couple of examples where GitHub piece of some people. So it's good if we can have some decentralized alternative. And next there is this new package USM Oracle. So that's a smart contract code to use a package to use different Oracle. So you don't have to basically check the specific documentation of several oracle.
00:49:55.610 - 00:50:32.490, Speaker B: It, it just make it a little bit more simple. It's a little bit like this package money Lego that I show you on my channel but specialized for oracle but their code has not been audited. So yeah, proceed with here. Okay so I think we're good for the news for developers. So now it's going to be Q A. So let me post the link to be notified when I release my defi course. So if you're interested in the defi course make sure to register here, it's free and I will send you some preview.
00:50:32.490 - 00:51:13.142, Speaker B: I've made some progress actually so I'll probably send some preview this week. So now I'm going up in the chat and I'm going to answer the question. Wow, so today a ton of questions. This is great. Okay, so Thx asks, hi Julian, is it possible to copyright my music and video with blockchain? Yeah, but the problem is that we'll need to have some sort of identity system on the blockchain. So we need to have some sort of registry that prove that you own such and such address and currently we don't have this. But yeah in theory it will be possible.
00:51:13.142 - 00:52:13.510, Speaker B: Yeah. Rakesh, in any chance of starting a startup with your trained student, if I did this I would have to stop YouTube. Really I can't do both. But what's possible is that in the future maybe I launch some project id with some students, some little thing, some little simple thing but maybe not like a full startup like some project, some sort of collaboration. Yeah, maybe it's possible then. Lf theory say hey Julian, do you know what will happen with existing smart contract in e two that will be updated automatically? Will they break? I think the plan is that you probably will have to migrate them yourself. Maybe there will be some API in Ethereum where to do the migration.
00:52:13.510 - 00:52:44.774, Speaker B: I really don't think that there will be a sort of automated migration of everything. I think it will be on a case by case basis, but I don't think that will break in any. No crypto saying, how is France? Are you in lockdown? Oh, I live in Taiwan actually. But France is still in lockdown. Now it's not sure people can celebrate Christmas. Yeah, it kind of sucks. Jewel, are you having a new camera? I can see you much better now.
00:52:44.774 - 00:53:11.680, Speaker B: It's just because I enlarged the camera area, but no new camera. Same shitty camera for my laptop. By the way, I catch COVID protocol at start. Nice. I didn't bought anchor police because the bug in the code which leaded to 2 million die lost. Oh yeah, there was this bug. Do you know if they fix everything? No, I'm not sure they fix everything.
00:53:11.680 - 00:53:30.702, Speaker B: So many interesting news, so many advanced daily in so many projects. Say lf series. Yeah, man. Like, just defi is so crazy. Okay, so after it's when I lost the sound, I think. Did anyone else just lose sound? Oh, damn. Damn.
00:53:30.702 - 00:54:09.070, Speaker B: Okay. I don't know how long it lasted, but. Oh my God. Okay. I hope it didn't last it for too long. I project with big teams. No, it's fine.
00:54:09.070 - 00:54:41.462, Speaker B: I think what's the most important event is that you are public. That if you try to do some anonymous defi project is where people start to be really suspicious. So yeah, make sure you just reveal your real identity and it can go quickly. If you do something interesting, maybe you will see some other developers that are really keen to join your project. So yeah, it can go really quickly in crypto. Oh, yeah. Batman was saying that OCC is the office of the controller of the currency.
00:54:41.462 - 00:55:15.686, Speaker B: Yeah, we saw that name popping up a lot in the news of crypto. Some sort of regulator in the US Jew is saying successful defi project needs capital endorsement. Davench is saying do defi auditing company audit for free. If yes, can show they audited us. Absolutely not. Audits are extremely expensive. A small audit, I think really small one, probably start like 50, 20, can go even higher, maybe 5100k.
00:55:15.686 - 00:55:53.106, Speaker B: So yeah, no, it's very expensive. I think occasionally you have some blockchain developer who do free audits, but these don't really have the same value. It's just because they like some project and they want to do something nice. But it's not like a real audit that is bought from a company. Azar saying, hi, julian, I'm working in private ethereum network from Hyperledger Bezu with the POA. I want to use an oracle to transfer data. Do you recommend provable? So I haven't worked a lot with Oracle and I haven't worked with provable especially.
00:55:53.106 - 00:56:34.720, Speaker B: All I can tell you is that right now the project that seems to become the market stands out is Chainlink. This being said, what I understand from provable is that they are more focused on how we call this, corporate users. So if you do a private ethereum network, maybe you're doing a corporate project. So maybe provable will be more suited. Juicing. Is the chinese project safe? Well, I don't see any problem with the fact that a project is chinese in itself. It doesn't mean anything, good or bad.
00:56:34.720 - 00:57:26.762, Speaker B: What matters is do they have a public team? And what about the code and what about the track record of the developers? What have they done before? Any good thing about them, bad thing about them. So yeah, this is more important record. I was saying, how do you feel about the chronomaging or other project? I mean, a lot of them are even a bit weird things. I don't like that. There are just so many news coming from Andre Cronhey. A lot of people sort of, how do you say? Think it's like some sort of half God, because there are all these news. But me, I know the difference between building projects right and left and building a product.
00:57:26.762 - 00:58:04.380, Speaker B: And to me it doesn't feel like Andre is building any product. It just feels like he's doing some sort of side project. But he doesn't seem to be really super committed to any of them. He seems to jump around a. Yeah, but I think what's going to happen is you're going to have some entrepreneurs who take the code of Andre and productize the thing he did. So in other words, some other people, it's going to reap the reward. Yeah, that's what's going to happen.
00:58:04.380 - 00:58:26.066, Speaker B: Dave is saying any free channeling alternative for oracles, their price fees are great, but it's not available in my native currency. It's a good question. I don't know about free chain link alternative. If anybody knows. Oh, saying dos. Okay, Abracadabra, said Dos or Ben. Okay, interesting.
00:58:26.066 - 00:59:21.090, Speaker B: We'll have to have a look. Amate. I'm wondering why a lot of centralized company invest so much in blockchain, which is decentralized because they think that blockchain is going to take away some of their business. So there is something I remember from this series House of Cards on Know House of cards. This is this series where you have these politicians in Washington and you have the president of the United States and everybody's trying to become the next president. So you have a lot of political scandal and at some point the main character, Frank, so some journalists call him and tell him, you know what, I know that you did some really bad thing, like some corruption or something. I'm about to publish the news tomorrow.
00:59:21.090 - 00:59:59.840, Speaker B: And then you know what he does? He said, okay, at this point, I cannot prevent this from happening. This bad thing is going to happen to me. So instead of denying it, I'm going to do some damage control. And so he actually published the news before, but he changed the wording to sort of control the way it's presented to the public. So I think decentralized companies, what they do, damage control, they know that they're going to lose some business to blockchain. So they're basically saying, okay, well, we are going to cannibalize our own business. So at least we are the one in control.
00:59:59.840 - 01:00:38.426, Speaker B: It's what they're trying to do. Devanch saying, is it safe to launch stablecoins and reveal identity? Want the government object and try us? Well, currently the stablecoin are still legal. So it's not illegal. So it's fine. You can launch your stablecoin project. Yeah. And when it comes to revealing your identity, I don't know what you mean exactly, but I don't recommend to do some anonymous blockchain project because you're never really anonymous.
01:00:38.426 - 01:01:03.174, Speaker B: It's a recipe for disaster. Abracadar was saying last question. Cronrey said he's working on Dairy swap. Do you have any info about this? Actually, I talked about Dairy swap in the last live stream of last week. So you can check this out. Okay, guys, so I think this is it. I think no more questions coming.
01:01:03.174 - 01:01:42.674, Speaker B: So thanks, everybody for coming here. Oh, yeah. And so this week I'm going to do another live stream, exceptionally on Friday. And I think the topic will be how to avoid defi scam. So we're going to go through the code of different smart contracts and try to see if there are any sort of backdoors that can be exploited. So yeah, if you guys are interested in this and you want to have a special specific project reviewed, let me know. I'm going to send a link.
01:01:42.674 - 01:01:44.466, Speaker B: Sorry. I'm going to send an email.
01:01:44.568 - 01:01:45.554, Speaker A: So if you are on my list.
01:01:45.592 - 01:01:59.806, Speaker B: You receive an email and then you can answer to this email with which project you want to be reviewed. Okay, guys, so. Yeah, thanks for coming here, and I will see you later this week on my channel. Have a great week, guys. Bye.
