00:00:07.320 - 00:00:23.612, Speaker A: And we are live. Welcome for this weekly livestream on the latest and greatest news in Ethereum and Defi. I'm Julian, your host. And on Edoblox, I teach blockchain development. Hi everybody. In the chat we have Dan, we have CM Tanda, we have Alexander. Well, the other.
00:00:23.612 - 00:00:56.604, Speaker A: Don't be shy, guys. Say hi to me. Show me your love. So, so this week, special announcement. So tomorrow, as a reminder, we're going to do a free training on how to find your first blockchain job in 2021. So in 2017, when I didn't have a lot of experience in blockchain, I found my first blockchain job, paid one hundred k and remote. And I will explain you exactly what I did, exactly the method that I used.
00:00:56.604 - 00:01:17.744, Speaker A: So if you are a newbie in the industry and you want to get your first blockchain job, register for this live training. This is free. It's going to save you a lot of trouble. If you're trying to figure out everything by yourself, you're going to waste a lot of time. So come attend this training. It's completely free tomorrow. So August 3, 11:00 p.m.
00:01:17.744 - 00:01:36.840, Speaker A: UTC plus eight. So I put the link just above, let me put it once again. And by the way, we are almost completely booked with this training. I think we have something like almost like almost 500 people. And that's really the limit. Like my zoom plan, that's the limit. I cannot go any higher.
00:01:36.840 - 00:01:57.488, Speaker A: Guys, register quickly. I very rarely do that kind of training. So I really don't know when the next one is going to take place. So yeah, make sure to register. Okay. So next we are going to continue with the price of ether. So the good news, continue.
00:01:57.488 - 00:02:23.972, Speaker A: We keep going up. So hopefully the bear market is behind us. And now we are even start to see $3,000 inside is pretty insane. Everybody was afraid that we'll be stuck at 2000 or even lower for a while. But no, we are going back up again. So this is amazing. And you can also see this in the transaction fees.
00:02:23.972 - 00:03:13.460, Speaker A: So transaction fees start to go up again. Even though compared to before this is still very reasonable. And that's of course because of the upcoming EIP 1559 actually. So talking about this, Ethereum updates. So the upgrades, the London hard fork should take place between August 3 to August 5. So it's going to be really in the next few days. And that's when we're going to have the update with the EIP 1559, which is supposed to be bullish for Ethereum because it will likely make the currency Ethereum become a deflationary, which means some of the fee are going to be burned for each transaction.
00:03:13.460 - 00:03:47.740, Speaker A: So of course that's a big reason behind the increase in ether. We also have another update, a little bit more, not as important, but still about Ethereum 2.0 on the beacon chain. So they're going to be the first update of the beacon chain, which is called alta year. And so that's going to be done first on a testnet and then on the beacon chain. So, you know, you have a lot of people who ask, okay, what's happening on east do? Is it dead node? We still have a lot of work. It's just that it's a lot of work behind the hood.
00:03:47.740 - 00:04:07.764, Speaker A: We don't necessarily see it unless we're really that core developer. Zen. Zen. Zen. The other big news this week was that it was the birthday of Ethereum. So Ethereum was launched on July 30, 2015. And here you can see an ether scan block.
00:04:07.764 - 00:04:48.884, Speaker A: Zero to the first time the Ethereum started. And at that time, Ethereum was much smaller. It was just a bunch of developers in an office in Berlin. And, yeah, fast forward six years and you see what Ethereum has becomes. It's pretty amazing. So there is this research from the block crypto that showed that the hash rate for Ethereum have recovered. So here you can see there was this big decline when China started to crack down on miners and it started to go up again.
00:04:48.884 - 00:05:21.970, Speaker A: And that's because a lot of the chinese miner, now they have moved their mining operations overseas. So don't freak out when you see that the government, some authorities, start to crack down on crypto, because this is just temporary. After you have the reaction of the crypto people, and crypto people are very resourceful, like, you don't want me here. Okay, cool, I'll go to another country, no problem. And that's really the beauty of crypto. It's very hard to destroy crypto. You can hurt crypto for a while, but it always come back, always.
00:05:21.970 - 00:06:24.084, Speaker A: There was this nice graph that I found. So that's a graph that show the staking services for Ethereum 2.0. So what we can learn from this is that exchanges really are the biggest provider of staking services, but you also have some other that are not exchanges like stake us steakfish, et cetera. There is also a large part that we don't know. And so this article, this research has been produced by Lido Phi, which is a project that is working on a decentralized staking service, because the problem of most staking services right now is that they are centralized. Then we're going to move on with the market cap of Defi. So we are up this week.
00:06:24.084 - 00:06:58.288, Speaker A: Of course, that's in big part thanks to the increase of ether in terms of the number of eth locked. So here, we're not going up here like we locked at around 975. But still, it's nice to see this market cap going up. Hopefully we'll get above 100 billion very soon in terms of the ranking. So this still ave number one insta Dap compound. Uniswap still hasn't recovered, still far after ave before. Used to be at the number one place for a long time.
00:06:58.288 - 00:07:37.016, Speaker A: Yeah, sushiswap, half of Uniswap then. So let's check out the crypto fees. So this is a website that gives you the transaction fees, the ranking of transaction fee for blockchain and for Defi project. So here, Ethereum is number one binance smart chain. So you can see binance machine, only one third of Ethereum in terms of transaction fee. Uniswap, almost as much as binance matching. There are even some time where Uniswap is above binance matching Sushiswap, which is really one third of Uniswap.
00:07:37.016 - 00:08:20.804, Speaker A: And you see, even though uniswap is way below ave in terms of total value locked, actually in terms of crypto fees, this is above. So it's interesting to see, and also interesting to see how bitcoin is so much below, even below some defi project. And here you can see quickswap, which is the number one Dex on polygon, which almost caught up with bitcoin. This is really amazing. I mean, bitcoin, like all the mainstream media keep talking about it, they never talk of Ethereum, and yet we see this really secondary project, quickswap on polygon. That's really not the main project of Ethereum. And even this very secondary project, it's almost above bitcoin.
00:08:20.804 - 00:08:58.256, Speaker A: This is really insane. Okay, so next we're going to see the dashboard for the Dex activity. So let's see the market share here. So yeah, Uniswap is really the biggest Dex, sushiswap number two curve. Then here you can see the share of Dex volume versus aggregator. And so that's weird because I would have thought that at this time aggregator would be stronger. But you can see that the direct Dex volume is still way bigger.
00:08:58.256 - 00:09:36.640, Speaker A: And so that tells you that there aren't enough whales because, you know, the whales are the biggest user of aggregator. Because, you know, with aggregator for basically low, you don't always win with aggregator. If you trade a small amount, it's not really worth it. So it's really only worth it to wealth in terms of the aggregator. So the biggest one is one inch daily decks volume. So there was a peak recently. So still very healthy volume.
00:09:36.640 - 00:10:12.424, Speaker A: Weekly Dex volume, very healthy as well. Here you can see like the market share of the different decks with moving according to time. So you can see Uniswap that is gaining market share over the other. Very interesting. You can see the monthly Dex volume group by year. And so you can see how 2021 is way above 2019. And 2021, actually 2019, we don't even sit on the chart.
00:10:12.424 - 00:10:42.756, Speaker A: 2020 a little bit. But you can see like 2021, we are way, way above. Okay, so there is this other chart, which is interesting. This is for lending. So you can see the train on different projects. So here you can see we have more and more lending. So we had this huge peak mid May when Elon Musk on the May 13 released his terrible tweet and after the market crashed.
00:10:42.756 - 00:11:26.112, Speaker A: But actually we are almost 100% recover with Ave compound and Mekoda, each of them doing really well. And actually, in terms of outstanding loans per project, we're even above the market peak of May. So it's interesting to have a better fine grained understanding of what the market is doing, because if you just check the prices, sometimes it can be very misleading. You don't really understand what's going on behind the hood. Okay, so next we're going to do the top and worst defi token of the week. So this week, the big winner is NFTX. So, NFTX, this is a project that does a fractionalized NFT.
00:11:26.112 - 00:12:11.344, Speaker A: This allow you to own a fraction of an expensive NFT, so you don't have to break the bank to buy an. So this week. So why it went up so much? Because there was a new farm that was announced on harvest finance with NFTX, and also there was the Coinbase listing. So, you know, like every time there is a coinbase listing, boom, it's like an instance boost for the. So the coin of harvest finance also went up. That was thanks to NFTX. What else do we have? So the coin, the coin of lido dao.
00:12:11.344 - 00:12:51.836, Speaker A: So yeah, I mean, that's the project I showed you before that is working on a decentralized service for staking. So I think their article was the major reason for the boost in the token price. Then we have earned Federal Reserve. So there was an announcement that Coinbase was working as their advisor. And then we have Thor. What else do we have? That's pretty much it for the top coins and for the big losers. So ample force is really struggling.
00:12:51.836 - 00:13:16.020, Speaker A: So they want to do basically a decentralized, algorithmic stable coin. But so far it's not stable enough. So it's still extremely volatile. You see like -50% for a stable coin. I mean, that's really not ideal. But overall, not too many loser. This week we had mostly winner.
00:13:16.020 - 00:14:09.172, Speaker A: Okay, next we are going to continue with news for DeFi project. And we have some news from synthetics, which is one of the darling of DFI. So they do basically a derivative financial product, but based built on the blockchain. And so now synthetics is not live on optimistic l two, but this is still an initial testing phase, so you don't have all the assets. And so after an initial period of observation, they're going to release more assets. So we start to see more and more d five project now coming onto L two. Then we have some news from stockware and Sorare.
00:14:09.172 - 00:14:47.620, Speaker A: So Sorare, which is one of the biggest NFT marketplace, and they announced that they are moving to stockware. So not just a deployment, but actually moving. And so with this, they will make their trade happen in a matter of second. A lot of things will be much faster and also much cheaper. So I've announced this. It's going to be awesome for the l two of Ethereum to capture all of this NFT project. That's going to give a huge boost.
00:14:47.620 - 00:15:39.856, Speaker A: Then we have some news about funding, a lot of funding this week. So a trading and lending platform called Vault, I didn't know about that one, raised $25 million. And that's led by Peter Thiel, who is one of the, I think the co founder of PayPal. And 25 million raise for these guys. Then life peer, which is basically sort of a decentralized YouTube built on ethereum. Life peer raised $20 million. Actually, that's interesting because I think that's something we don't have right now in terms of social network on the blockchain.
00:15:39.856 - 00:16:24.660, Speaker A: I mean, there was steam it, but after steamit we didn't have much traction for other stuff. And when we see all the problem with censorship at the moment, I'm really frustrated that we don't have anything really with a lot of traction right now. So yeah, let's see what we can do with a live peer. Then some news from biconomy. So biconomy is an API for blockchain developer. And so they raised $9 million. So recently we had a lot of similar project that raised money, a lot of them raising 10 million, which means they are already at quite a mature phase for the development.
00:16:24.660 - 00:17:14.164, Speaker A: Then we have another money raised, so 10 million from Loli. So that's a company that offers some bitcoin reward for your purchase. Then another money raised from Valora. So this is a wallet built on the cello network. And so they receive a 20 million for their funding run and they are backed by a 16 z. Then some news from the Solana blockchain. And so they have a stablecoin exchange called Saber, and it raised a $7.7
00:17:14.164 - 00:17:44.332, Speaker A: million in seed funding. So in seed funding is really huge. In seed funding, usually you don't get that much. So currently they are three, and so they are going to hire new developer. Then we have some news for an option protocol that is built on optimism and synthetics, so that it's called lira. And so they raised $3.3 million.
00:17:44.332 - 00:18:28.460, Speaker A: And so what's interesting with them is that they didn't launch on Ethereum l one, but they launched directly on Ethereum l two. And so that's a trend that we're going to see more and more project directly launching on L two, totally skipping L one. Then another money raised from fireblocks. So they provide custody for digital assets for the institutional crowd. So it's basically when you're a big company, you don't want to have the responsibility to keep your private key yourself. So basically you use some digital bank like fireblocks. This company raised $310,000,000.
00:18:28.460 - 00:18:57.008, Speaker A: So it's quite big. The past few weeks, almost every week, we've seen a big money raise in crypto with hundreds of million of dollars. I think the recode so far, was it circle? I think Circle was something like 300 million, but I think it was 600 billion. But I don't remember. I think it was two weeks ago. Yeah, but I mean, we are beating new record every week. Then another money raised from a horizon blockchain.
00:18:57.008 - 00:19:27.280, Speaker A: So this is a project that build blockchain games. They raised $4.5 million. And so originally they were from the incubator of Ubisoft. So if you never heard of Ubisoft, this is a french company, one of the leader in game. So that's possibly a very good project. Then another money raised for alchemy NFT.
00:19:27.280 - 00:20:13.020, Speaker A: So they raised 6 million and they raised money, including from Mark Cuban. And so one of the project they built was a project for NFT autograph. And Mark Cuban, he's been really big in crypto for at least one year. Since one year. Then we have another money raised from an NFT game called Splinter lens, $3.6 million. So this is a game where you can trade a digital card and apparently right now the number of user is really exploding.
00:20:13.020 - 00:20:35.648, Speaker A: Next, another money raise, and I think that's the last one. So this is another game, yield guild game. I don't know how to pronounce it. Yield guild games. They raise $12.5 million in 31 seconds. So this time it was not with a vc, but that was with a token sale.
00:20:35.648 - 00:21:10.912, Speaker A: So that was an investment dao. So that's why they can do token sale because I don't know of any company right now that does token sale with the regulation, it's almost impossible. But interestingly, a dao, a decentralized entity, as a dao, it's still fine to do a token sale. So, yeah, I mean, this reminds me of the crazy money raised in 2017. We used to have these things like every week. I remember which project raised. There was this project that raised 32 million in 32nd.
00:21:10.912 - 00:21:46.092, Speaker A: I think that was brave browser. Yeah. Then some news from Matrix port. So this is a startup from a bitmain founder, and so they raised over $100 million. So now they become a unicorn. Then we are going to continue with the hack of the week. So fortunately only one hack this week.
00:21:46.092 - 00:22:31.736, Speaker A: So the hack was coming from the velo token. So basically there was a false airdrop of 150,000 velo token. And so this attracted the attention of a lot of people. And so the way it works is that they route you to a fake website, a fake airdrop claim, and so they make you sign a transaction with Metamask, which doesn't do what it claimed to do. So they say, okay, well, this transaction is you're going to claim your airdrop, but actually you're going to just allow them to approve them to spend your token and from there they steal your token. So terrible, terrible. Yeah.
00:22:31.736 - 00:23:20.564, Speaker A: That's why you always have to check carefully what is the transaction you're signing on your ledger, on your hardware wallet. Like, don't trust what Metamask is showing you. So next we are going to talk of NFT. So NFT currently is going through another boom. Secondary prices are going to the, and we have a couple of news. First from Coca Cola, which is going to release their collection of NFT. And so they're going to do an auction on Opensea, then one of the biggest luxury brands.
00:23:20.564 - 00:23:48.310, Speaker A: So I think they're talking of LVMH. They're going to launch a video game with Louis Vuitton. Yeah, this is LVMH. Actually, I'm not so excited when I see big brand launching some NFT. I mean, this is good for the awareness, like the mainstream awareness of NFT. But personally, I prefer to give money to artists. These big companies, they already have enough money.
00:23:48.310 - 00:24:35.600, Speaker A: I don't see the point of buying the NFT. Then we have some news from Shopify. So the e commerce platform is going to allow its customer to sell NFT directly. So with Shopify, you can create basically your e commerce website very easily. And so in the future, merchant will be able to sell NFT. So that's huge because Shopify is really used by a lot of merchants and there is a huge crowd online of entrepreneurs who are trying to make money with e commerce and they're always on the lookout for new cool product. And so that maybe that now we have NFT enabled on this platform, it's going to create a huge demand for NFT.
00:24:35.600 - 00:25:23.040, Speaker A: But one last thing, because they really care about user experience, I don't think they're going to interact with metamask. So probably it's going to be a hosted wallet where when you buy NFT, they actually control the private key and maybe that as a customer you can transfer this NFT to your own wallet. But yeah, I think they're going to make it easy in terms of ux. And so it's not going to be decentralized. Then a big sale of NFT this week, 20 million Damien hears. So six time oversubscribe. So yeah, it really feels like they're going to be another big wave of then.
00:25:23.040 - 00:26:04.380, Speaker A: Then we are going to talk of enterprise blockchain and regulation. And so first, PayPal. So the CEO of PayPal has made an announcement where he said basically he was really bullish on crypto. He said, we continue to be really pleased with the momentum we're seeing on crypto. PayPal crypto ambition aren't limited to above. According to Schulman, we are clearly thinking about what the next generation of the financial system looks like, how we can help with that. So that's basically a big hint that PayPal might be interested in DeFi and smart contract.
00:26:04.380 - 00:26:55.284, Speaker A: Then we have some news from Goldman Sachs which files an application to the NFT with the SEC to create a DeFi and blockchain equity ETF. So basically that will allow the mainstream investors to invest very easily in DeFi and in blockchain project. Then some news from Binance. So Binance just completed its integration with Polygon. So now you can send from Polygon to Binance and from Binance to Polygon. So that's very bullish for the token of polygon. Next, some other news from Binance.
00:26:55.284 - 00:27:46.796, Speaker A: Negative this time. So they are stopping all their derivatives offering in three european countries. So first, because there was a lot of backlash coming from the regulators in the UK and in general like binance the past few months, it's been terrible for them because there were all these regulators around the world that started to go after them. So now binance start to be way more careful still. Binance still very much under pressure from a regulator. So they are going to basically reduce your ability to withdraw your crypto if you are not fully KYC. So, you know, they have different tiered basic verification and then the verification above.
00:27:46.796 - 00:28:51.584, Speaker A: And so depending on how much paperwork you fill with them, you'll be able to deposit more or less crypto. But be careful with this because basically, if you have a lot of crypto on binance and suddenly you cannot withdraw it, so you try to upgrade your verification tier, but sometime it can take months before you get verified. So, yeah, be careful with this. If you need to restrain some crypto, then we have some news from visa that say that the crypto purchases during the spring break has boosted its volume because a lot of people, the way they buy crypto, so they don't send money with a wire to an exchange, but instead they use their credit card because it's easier. And so, yeah, Visa said that crypto purchases was really a big boost for their trading volume. And then we have some news from. Sorry, guys, wrong.
00:28:51.584 - 00:29:22.812, Speaker A: Let me see. I click on something wrong. Okay, good. Okay, that's the correct URL. Some news from Facebook that is thinking of basically transforming Facebook into a metaverse company. So basically it's not clear exactly what they want to do, but probably it means that they want to introduce some VR into Facebook and possibly also some NFT. So this is not the first time that they try to do this.
00:29:22.812 - 00:30:14.248, Speaker A: They already tried to do it twice in the past and it failed every time. They've been working on their own blockchain called Libra. I think they announced this in 2018. And at the beginning there were a lot of partner visa, et cetera, and very quickly, the project just was attacked from every side, like, from regulators, a lot of partners that left. So, yeah, I'm not very confident in the ability of Facebook to do anything good in crypto, basically. And then we have some news from the Central bank of China that said that they will keep a very high pressure on crypto trading. So if you follow crypto, you know that recently China has been super negative about crypto.
00:30:14.248 - 00:30:49.172, Speaker A: So a lot of miners are leaving China right now because at the same time they are working on their central bank digital currency, the digital yuan. So they don't want any competition from crypto. Then some news from Stat, from bitcoin. So bitcoin miners earn about $1 billion in July. So that's 10% more compared to the months before. But that's only one third of the mining revenue for Ethereum. Then some news for developers.
00:30:49.172 - 00:31:33.140, Speaker A: So this is a playground for the Ethers library. So ethers library, this is an alternative to web three. So with this playground, it allow you to easily try out ethers in an easy to use tool. Next, another tool that is called e transaction decoder. So basically, you put your transaction hash and it's going to decode the transaction. So it's going to tell you, okay, this transaction is going to call this function with this argument, et cetera. Then another tool, smart contract inspector.
00:31:33.140 - 00:32:10.832, Speaker A: So basically, you put the address of a smart contract and it's going to give you the code of the contract. So it's similar to what we have on Etherscan, but on etherscan you need the smart contract to be verified. But with this tool, I'm not sure if you need the code to be verified. This is probably not the case. So even if it's not verified, I think it still works. So probably a more versatile tool compared to Uniswap. Then an update from Etherscan.
00:32:10.832 - 00:32:54.208, Speaker A: So they've introduced a new feature where when you check an address on Etherscan, he will tell you if this address is also used on other blockchains. So binance, smart chain, polygon, et cetera. So that's very convenient for people like me that manage the same address on different blockchain. Okay, so that's it for the main part. So now we're going to do the q and a. But very briefly, let me give you a reminder that tomorrow, so August 3 at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight, we are going to do a free live training on how to find your first blockchain job in 2021.
00:32:54.208 - 00:33:23.816, Speaker A: So I will explain you exactly what I did in 2017 when I find my first blockchain job, even though I had almost no experience. So if you are new in the blockchain, industry. And you want to find your first blockchain job, you must attend. This training is going to save you a lot of times. Tomorrow, August 3, at 11:00 p.m. UTC plus eight. So I put the link in the chat.
00:33:23.816 - 00:34:00.870, Speaker A: Okay, guys, so let me scroll up and see who we have here. Okay, so we have Joe Biden, we have Anderson Lima, Tom Selga, th shakes Green star, Constantin Varsha, Georgie Konichi, th shakes Batman. So, George Konichi, have you heard that tech lead token was hacked? Really? Okay. No, I didn't know. Okay, well, I should have covered this, actually. Okay, well, thanks for letting me know. Yeah, I hope people didn't lose too much money.
00:34:00.870 - 00:34:49.692, Speaker A: Constantine, is it possible to build an embedded metamask like in our dex project, to avoid using xno plugin? Thanks. And keep going with your amazing content. No, it's not possible, because in your dex project, basically, if you build your metamask, that means you need to somehow, you need to store the private key of your user. And it really goes against the basic idea of dapps. The private key needs to be kept in a decentralized way by users. So by definition, your dap cannot handle this part. Unity official channel axi made 160,000,000 in revenue in July.
00:34:49.692 - 00:34:59.076, Speaker A: Okay. Wow. It's got to be the game that made the most money, I guess. Jose Ramirez. Hi. Felipe zabata. Ola.
00:34:59.076 - 00:35:22.384, Speaker A: Buenos dias. Saludos. Desde, chile. I used to study Spanish until I was 18, so I kind of sort of understand siam tanda. Hey, Julian, I saw the course on fashion arbitrage is being updated. You are the man of your word. Yeah, no, I'm very sorry it took so much time, but, yeah.
00:35:22.384 - 00:35:51.368, Speaker A: So Batman is working on that, and then when the material is ready, then I will record the video. Yeah. Sorry about the delay, but we are doing this. Will metaverse be the focus of future development? I mean, you're talking of the metaverse of Facebook. No, it's way too soon to say. And in general, so far, I don't really trust Facebook to do anything significant in blockchain. Everything they've done, nothing worked at the moment.
00:35:51.368 - 00:36:13.840, Speaker A: So maybe metaverse, maybe another. Maybe some blockchain game will build a metaverse, but not Facebook. Scalar. If you follow theta, tdrop news is cool. Okay, I didn't follow too much theta scalar. A metaverse feels like the future. In very tiny opinion.
00:36:13.840 - 00:36:27.312, Speaker A: Yeah. Felipe Zapata. Hola. Saludos deste. Yeah, thanks, Felipe. Mega Montana. Hello, Julian.
00:36:27.312 - 00:36:54.510, Speaker A: Will you also show us how to do a portfolio. So how to do a portfolio? This is in one of my courses. So I'm guessing you're talking of the free training tomorrow. So this is going to be a training of about 1 hour. So we're going to focus on career advice. This is not going to be technical stuff. It's more like high level stuff, like how you can enter the blockchain industry and be the most efficient possible.
00:36:54.510 - 00:37:19.008, Speaker A: Okay, guys, so we are reaching the end of the chat. So I guess we are going to wrap up here. So thanks for coming today. And don't forget to register for the free live training tomorrow on how to find your first blockchain job in 2021. Thanks everybody, and I will see you later this week. Have a great week. Bye.
