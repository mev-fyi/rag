00:00:03.560 - 00:01:09.355, Speaker A: The thing that makes life interesting is that there are positive some games. The fact that there are some things where it's not a dog eat dog world. I got into research out of curiosity, love following interesting ideas and then see where it takes me. There are only, I think two foundational reasons why we have positive sum games. One is innovation. Innovation is the alchemy of converting a non resource into a resource. Another reason is coordination.
00:01:09.355 - 00:01:29.165, Speaker A: Five people come together and do something more than the sum of the parts. Even if you don't have economic security, you get majority honest security for a sec. And I saw crypto as an opportunity to reduce the trust frictions that that impede any kind of coordination.
00:01:37.705 - 00:02:29.295, Speaker B: Once you're an artist, you're kind of always an artist. I've made art my whole life in different ways. All of us are here really trying to be of service. We're all trying to offer our gifts to the world, do something meaningful and be recognized for it and rewarded for it in some fair way. Why is it that we don't have a civilizational container that allows for all these precious unique gifts that are clearly needed in the world to express? And it goes deep, you know, it goes to economics, it goes to philosophy, it goes to politics. How we fundamentally make decisions together, how we trust each other, how we understand each other, how we communicate with each other are the fundamental aspects of new levels of society, new levels of growth and development.
00:02:31.315 - 00:03:04.355, Speaker C: 13 year old VC is a cringe name that I put together. I don't know if I should say the word cringe, but you should. Hey, what's up? Welcome to Jesse's Hacker Hall. Working with the ecosystem, working with builders is something that I've always really enjoyed. Shout out to Mega E for letting us use our space. We kind of got kicked out by our Airbnb host last minute, so we had to change our venue. In order to solve very large problems in the world, you can't rely on people just all working in their silos.
00:03:04.355 - 00:03:21.755, Speaker C: What I really love about hacker houses is that, you know, the people there are very authentic because they're not there for anything external. They're there for their internal passion to build an open source project that is super fucking cool.
00:03:25.365 - 00:04:04.795, Speaker A: I View all of web3 and crypto as building self enforcing coordination mechanisms, which doesn't rely on an authority, on a council, on a majority to enforce itself because it's self enforcing. You can make credible commitments. How do you make a commitment to your users that you are not going to get all the users and then become extortive it's exactly what every other platform has been. How do you make that credible commitment that even you, as the creator of that application cannot change? Crypto is a solution to this problem.
00:04:06.655 - 00:04:47.295, Speaker B: In crypto and in blockchain, you can give provable ownership of projects to the community. And that's a kind of credible commitment that you can't have in a corporate world. Just like DNA enabled data storage within biology over long term for more advanced replication and development, blockchain allows for information storage and replication in a way that the collective organisms can thrive and grow beyond our wildest dreams. We're just at the start of figuring out what these things are even like. But what they need is each of us to be able to offer our unique contribution into that space. And when that happens, it's nonlinear.
00:04:52.765 - 00:05:23.885, Speaker A: When you move from this kind of like an authority based coordination mechanism to this self enforcing coordination mechanism, it doesn't increase the set of systems that can be built, but it makes each system that can be built much more powerful and much more useful. Because you don't need to trust the person who's under the hood. And if one credible commitment, there's 21 million, Bitcoin can get us this far to crypto adoption. How does a society built on credible commitments look?
00:05:27.785 - 00:05:37.825, Speaker B: We need a new system that can be more open and flexible to connect us. Bitcoin was the first part of that. Ethereum was the second part. Eigen layer is the third.
