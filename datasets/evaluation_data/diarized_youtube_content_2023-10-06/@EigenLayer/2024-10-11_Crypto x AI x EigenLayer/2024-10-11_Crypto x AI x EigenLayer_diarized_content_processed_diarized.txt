00:00:00.200 - 00:00:30.169, Speaker A: Crypto X AI is the clearest reason for crypto to exist. Imagine crypto was there before Facebook. Then the right Facebook would have been built on crypto rails. There is a chance for the best AI in 3 years or in 5 years to be on crypto rails. All the AI people are talking about today is running out of data. What better global data collection mechanism than crypto? You can incentivize people really easily as owners in the system. Incentivize the person with the data to work with the person with the model.
00:00:30.169 - 00:00:54.085, Speaker A: Incentivize people with different models to come together to create meta models. Incentivize more decentralized AI. All these kinds of coordination mechanisms bound via contracts. Instead of saying let's bring the regulators in, crypto native way of thinking would be to say let's upgrade our coordination layer and build a pan global automated self enforcing coordination system. We're already getting that. Like it's going so crazy so fast. Yes.
