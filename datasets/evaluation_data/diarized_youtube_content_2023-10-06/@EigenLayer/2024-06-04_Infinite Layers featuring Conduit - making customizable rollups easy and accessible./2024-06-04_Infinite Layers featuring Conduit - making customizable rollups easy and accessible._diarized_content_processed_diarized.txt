00:00:09.880 - 00:00:19.874, Speaker A: All right, welcome everyone. We're here back with infinite layers. Today I am joined by Andrew, the founder of Conduit. Do you mind giving us a quick intro to yourself and to your company?
00:00:21.134 - 00:01:00.110, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm Andrew. I'm the founder and CEO of Conduit. Conduit is a roll up platform that enables anybody to launch their own L2 or layer three on Ethereum. Today we have all the modular options available. So we work primarily with the op stack and arbitrum and we take those and enable you to mix and match various parts of the modular toolkit to really enable the kind of product that folks are trying to build. Today we have over 30 mainnet roll ups deployed today. We have hundreds across testnet.
00:01:00.110 - 00:01:19.274, Speaker B: And it's really exciting to see what builders are actually building today. And if it used to be took tens of millions of dollars to launch your own chain, I think we brought it down to three k a month. I think we're excited to see what that really enables. We're just getting started here.
00:01:20.034 - 00:01:57.514, Speaker A: Awesome. Yet I have tons of questions for you and we're going to go over a lot of them, I think, in just a moment. But I guess the first thing that I'm just going to ask, and this might not have specifically anything to do with the topic, but yeah, so tell me, like with layer threes and what the actual meaning of that is and when someone would choose to do that as opposed to like launching a L2. Let's talk about that for a moment. Do you mind just kind of giving like a quick overview of your, I guess, definition or perception of what an l three is and when someone might choose to go that route as opposed to an l two for sure.
00:01:59.374 - 00:02:59.284, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's more of a, less of a technical term and kind of more of a, I think, just semantic term in terms of, I think developers understanding what that is and users understanding what it is. And so a layer three as we envision it is just a roll up that settles to another L2. And the advantage of this is that settlement costs are much, much cheaper. So if you think about launching on L2, for example, like mode and zora are good examples of networks on conduit that are their own L2 s. There's just a bit more activation energy you need and in some sense you're competing with kind of the arbitrageum ones, the bases of the world. And so you maybe need a bit more firepower to do that. And I think if you look at settlement costs, which are primarily based off of what ethereum mean that gas prices are, that can get expensive.
00:02:59.284 - 00:03:39.874, Speaker B: And so what layer threes really enable is for you to kind of bootstrap your kind of network and ecosystem and adoption off of an existing L2. And so where we've seen this really take off is on base and arbitrum one, which are kind of the biggest L2s out there today. The advantage is you get your own dedicated block space and the same form factor as an l two. But bridging into the roll up is much cheaper, settling is much cheaper. And so for applications that want to draft off kind of the ecosystem, we think it's in increasingly kind of attractive option for those developers.
00:03:41.414 - 00:03:52.154, Speaker A: Got it. And so with base, you called out base and arbitrum one specifically. How about optimism, is. Are you saying more people choose base than just optimism?
00:03:53.814 - 00:04:29.394, Speaker B: Yeah. So base is definitely leading the charge on kind of the super chain front. And I would say optimism in some ways, I think even internally within kind of optimism is kind of taking the backseat and is more of a governance chain. And I think it's also important that the developers of the op stack run a chain, so they kind of understand kind of what they're running. And so, yeah, we definitely see most of the demand around where most of the activity is. And so base is leading the charge there. It has most of the users and the assets.
00:04:29.394 - 00:04:41.894, Speaker B: And then when guests fees go up and the chain gets congested, that's increasingly kind of a reason to launch around layer three to help insulate from some of those gas spikes.
00:04:43.474 - 00:05:22.572, Speaker A: Yeah, that's super interesting. I've definitely noticed that a lot more developers are building on base these days, and I think they've done just a really excellent job. And they've also have quite a few applications that people know and use that people love. So they have, like, this thriving ecosystem. But it's kind of interesting to see how that kind of played out, considering that, like, optimism itself is now seeing, like, less excitement and hype in terms of where developers deploy than base, but. And then to kind of, like, see that ultimate ultimately play out now with actual, with all threes is also even more interesting. Right.
00:05:22.572 - 00:05:25.194, Speaker A: So, yeah, just a thought.
00:05:26.454 - 00:06:19.664, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah, I think it's in some ways kind of like the Netflix self disruption kind of tactic. And so Netflix used to mail people dvd's, and then they kind of realized it wasn't the future and built kind of the streaming technology, which kind of cannibalized their kind of pre existing business, which at the time was actually pretty, pretty good. And I kind of view what optimism is doing in kind of the same lens, right, where unlike arbitrum one, where I think, yes, they're leaning into orbit and having many, many chains. I still think arbitrum one and arbitrum nova are kind of distinctly the priorities there. I think optimism mainnet, in that sense, has really taken a backseat. And I think they're kind of making super chain and kind of this network of interconnected roll ups, kind of the first class thing that they're focusing on.
00:06:19.664 - 00:06:38.704, Speaker B: And so, you know, it's, in terms of the chains that they're getting, it's super interesting, and it seems to be working. And so, you know, I kind of think that being willing to self disrupt feels to me kind of a unique strategy, and I think it seems to be working for optimism.
00:06:39.844 - 00:06:51.882, Speaker A: So can you tell me a little bit about how conduit was formed and your background and how you became founder and choosing this specific vertical to focus on, for sure?
00:06:52.018 - 00:07:48.092, Speaker B: So I'd been kind of an engineer for, you know, six or seven years previous to starting conduit. The where I cut my teeth was at this company called Wish, which is like, I don't know if you ever used it, but you could buy super cheap, like, products from China on it. I worked on infrastructure there, and it was one of the fastest scaling companies ever. I think we ran some of the largest database clusters in the world. And so with that kind of scale and that kind of fast growth is a really good place to learn that stuff. I call wish, like, the crypto company before crypto companies, because they were so good at targeting users with, like, Facebook ads, which in some ways is the equivalent of, like, being really good at air dropping tokens or kind of incentives, but then fail to build, like, a sustainable business model. So, like, grew super, super fast.
00:07:48.092 - 00:08:49.684, Speaker B: We, like, reached basically, like, the 2 billion, 3 billion people globally that, you know, we're kind of in our target demographic, and then we just weren't able to build something sustainable there, which I think is kind of how a lot of crypto products and kind of the last era kind of went. So it was interesting to see that. And then I joined a startup afterwards that ended up getting acquired by Twitter. I worked on engineering product there, and at the time was also dabbling into crypto, had always been interested from kind of the bitcoin days just because it was a very novel kind of technology. And in particular, I think a lot of classic computer science is in some ways antithetical to what crypto is doing. It's just a very different kind of take on it. I'd always been interested and curious, and I think with the background of scaling, I think the question came up is, how do you actually, crypto is super interesting.
00:08:49.684 - 00:09:22.294, Speaker B: I think we really felt this in Defi summer, where gas prices went up super high. We saw a lot of all time ones launch because of this. And I think, for me, the question was, ultimately, crypto is super interesting. It's like freedom technology, but kind of the cost of that is it can be very expensive. Right. And so how do we scale this freedom technology so that anybody can use it? And it doesn't cost, like, $1,000 to do a uniswap swap. And that's really where roll ups came into play.
00:09:22.294 - 00:10:05.984, Speaker B: And, like, these technologies were just getting to the point where they were, like, production ready and kind of battle tested. And I think the thought was, what if you take this tech, which is really great, it scales freedom, it scales autonomy and sovereignty and make it accessible to anybody at a price point that makes sense? And so that was the genesis of conduit, and that was maybe a year and a half ago at this point. And, yeah, I think in the last year and a half, we've made a lot of progress in terms of folks identifying that this tech can actually help them scale and doing it in a way that really enables them to build better and kind of more full fledged applications.
00:10:08.084 - 00:10:47.484, Speaker A: Okay, very cool. Very cool. Yeah, it sounds like you've had, like, pretty cool experience, and I think I understand the crossover between, I feel, like, certain types of common e commerce and then crypto. I feel like there's a lot of stories where people, like, have had experiences there. Like, I just talked to the near founder, and I personally had my own experiences. I think the thing that really made crypto seem interesting to me was my experience with PayPal. And PayPal basically had, you know, my business relied on PayPal, basically, and had a lot of money flowing through PayPal and a lot of money just sitting there because I treated it like a bank.
00:10:47.484 - 00:11:24.404, Speaker A: And then one day, they just kind of, like, stopped letting me have access to it due to a fraudulent charge that was not, you know, accurate, and ended up kind of, like, costing me the whole company because it just took so long for them to unlock, not vendors and stuff like that to be paid anyway. But, yeah, it's kind of interesting to hear different people's backgrounds. So I have a lot of questions about, like, conduit itself. But before I do that, do you want to give us a quick demo? Or something, or some type of introduction to what it looks like to maybe to use conduit and then I'll come back and ask questions based on what you haven't already answered maybe.
00:11:25.504 - 00:12:11.226, Speaker B: Definitely. So let me take you to our dashboard. And so this is, and assuming that you guys can see this, but this is our dashboard. If you go to app Conduit XYZ and you just sign up, you can get taken here. We obviously have a bunch of these just for internal testing, but essentially I think Rollup is becoming the new server in the same way that you might go to AWS and launch some compute. We want that experience to be as seamless on conduit for developers to basically create net new computer. You can see here in our deployment UI.
00:12:11.226 - 00:12:44.256, Speaker B: It guides you through the various options here. Today we support the op stack and arbitram orbit. These have different settlement layer choices. Obviously if you're settling to layer one, you'd be a L2. There are different data availability options and different modes here. And then for arbitrary, morbid, obviously we have other settlement layers as well. So you can be an l three on arbitrum one, you can be an l three on top of base, and there's some nice little kind of social proof here.
00:12:44.256 - 00:13:38.424, Speaker B: So like Degen for example, is an arbitrum orbit settling on base l two using the anytrust DA. And it's as simple as you can select testnet here, you can even select Mainnet and deploy. We've actually had a few teams in the last couple of weeks deploy their main nets without talking to us, which was surprising and also bullish. Of course we have other advanced features. If you want a custom gas token, you can just paste in the contract here and everything will just work. In terms of a post deployment one, this is an example of an arbitrum nitrogen stack. After deployment you can see you get the RPC, WebSocket, endpoint, block explorer, you get a bunch of information.
00:13:38.424 - 00:14:06.760, Speaker B: So this looks like it's just using Ethereum. You can create bridge, you can trace transactions. This comes baked in with a bunch of metrics. You can see the contracts here and of course you can customize. So that's a big point here, which is you can self serve brand your block Explorer. There are a bunch of advanced options. You can set DNS names.
00:14:06.760 - 00:14:46.514, Speaker B: And I think increasingly what this is becoming is you can go from no roll up to roll up deployed on main net in as little as a couple of weeks. And we want to even bring that down further. And so I think we envision a world of like millions of roll ups. And if we're going to get there, I think we need to make it even easier than it is today and kind of at a price point that enables you to just start and kind of experiment and then, you know, allows you to build and scale kind of without, without limits.
00:14:49.464 - 00:15:44.054, Speaker A: Got it. So essentially, like what, you know, like you mentioned before, in the past, it would take teams like years and millions of dollars to build is now just kind of like into a UI, which is to me kind of insane, to be honest, to kind of see this progress so rapidly in the last couple of years with like the current options that you're seeing. You're sort of like, there's obviously this decoupling of all the different pieces of a roll up stack now. Started with DA and now you're seeing other pieces. Can you kind of talk about the different things that are options here and like building your own stock and then maybe what you might start offering in the future in addition to what's here? Like, are there people like asking for other pieces, like different types of sequencers and maybe co processing and I mean, you have block, block explorers and all these other things for sure.
00:15:44.354 - 00:16:23.784, Speaker B: So I think, one, there's obviously the options that we have here today, for example, Eigenva, we get asked about this a ton. And I think being able to go through this process and have the information and importantly just test it out is kind of a huge unlock in terms of barrier to entry. So we're excited about the self serve aspect. You don't need to talk to anybody. You can just come here, costs $50 a month and you can just play around with it. In terms of other modular options. Well, one, and maybe this is easier to show here.
00:16:23.784 - 00:17:34.534, Speaker B: So we have a bunch of integrations here and that enables you to kind of take these apps that you might have on other platforms and launch them on your own roll up. Today it's a bit more of a manual process in the future and actually very soon we're going to have the ability to one click add these products to your roll up. And so one of the things that we're noticing is that we've de risked and made it really quick to deploy. But then there's the if I need a counteraction, I have to talk to account extraction providers. If I need bridging, fast bridging, I need to talk to fast bridge providers. And handling the BD as well as the integration could take anywhere from like a couple of weeks to a couple of months. And so by streamlining that process and bringing it into the application, we want to just kind of accelerate those timelines in terms of other modular things like sequencing.
00:17:34.534 - 00:19:11.264, Speaker B: We definitely have plans on adding options here. I think the question for some of those is there anything in production today that actually works? And I think what we want to ensure is that anything that we put here is something that you would feel comfortable actually using on mainnet. And I think you can even see some of the designations here where if we look at plasma mode, which is like a new mode coming for the op stack, it's a very new technology, and we just want to ensure that folks have the context going in on the state of this. Is it alpha, is it beta? How many people are using this? What are some of the downsides? And oftentimes in crypto, there's kind of a narrative element where people just want the latest thing or the thing that's kind of most hyped, even if it might technologically or at a substance level, not really do anything or not be stable. And so I think for us, again, we want to meet our customers where they are, but we want to make sure that when they make the decision, they're going in with it with kind of eyes wide open. So importantly, that's how we add these details within our UI. But also enabling them to actually test the configurations on Testnet before going to mainnet gives them an opportunity to see for themselves the kind of state of the state of the technology and how battle tested it is.
00:19:12.164 - 00:19:47.624, Speaker A: So how often do people just build this on their own through the UI, versus how often do they reach out to you for custom integration support? And do you feel like if someone wanted to build the next, I don't know, non trivial company that might be a billion dollar company one day, would you recommend them probably to still like, reach out to understand how to, you know, put these things together properly and maintain them? Or do you feel like it's already there, where someone could literally just come through here and like make a few clicks and build what could ultimately be a really successful company a year from now?
00:19:48.884 - 00:21:00.258, Speaker B: Yeah, I kind of think we're already there. And like, if you go back to kind of the social proof like mode and zora are examples of two companies that are doing really, really well, and if you launch this, you actually literally get the same configuration that they have in the same infrastructure. And I think there's kind of a distinction here between, like, I think conduit is building a platform, and I think a lot of other folks are more like services businesses where they manage everything and kind of build things one off. And if we're talking about for example, customization, I think there's some nuance there in what you actually enable. And so for example, these modular options create ability to customize. But if you're building a super custom blockchain, that's something, something that we would definitely love to explore, but also comes with other overheads. And as an example, I think the deeper that you want to customize a roll up framework, I think the more you need to keep a protocol team on staff to update and maintain that.
00:21:00.258 - 00:22:00.020, Speaker B: Not to mention security audits and all this other stuff. It starts to get more expensive. But I think increasingly what we're seeing is that it's harder to get future upgrades. And so there are some chains out there today that went super custom and maybe they're not posting blobs yet, for example, or haven't updated to the latest code. And if you're familiar with software, you know that software kind of rots. And if you don't upgrade, there's a higher chance that there are vulnerabilities in there that haven't been patched, that it doesn't have the latest performance improvements or new features. And so by sticking to, I think, the areas and axes of customizability and modularity that we enable out of the box, it enables you to pull in those wave of updates as they're getting pushed out while maintaining the modularity that you're interested in.
00:22:00.020 - 00:22:03.384, Speaker B: And so, yeah, does that kind of make sense?
00:22:04.124 - 00:22:20.104, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. So what would maintenance look like for the average team after deploying with conduit, I guess over six months from now, a year from now? Like if they did want to make those updates, what would that look like for them?
00:22:21.284 - 00:22:59.214, Speaker B: So it's totally hands off. And I think, for example, like we, we handle the upgrades on their behalf. I think the way to think about it is similar to like AWS or Google Cloud. You can opt into like certain upgrades and we can handle it for you. You can click the button and like it upgrades, but principally, like you can kind of think about it as like no operations on your end. We handle everything and you treat it as if it's just another blockchain. The only difference is that it's yours and that has a variety of benefits which we can go into later.
00:22:59.214 - 00:23:09.054, Speaker B: But basically what we're selling is peace of mind and zero maintenance on our customers end.
00:23:10.434 - 00:23:25.924, Speaker A: So what you have built here is non trivial in terms of engineering on the back end. So I'm just curious, how many people work at conduit, and how hard was it to actually make something like this work on the back end?
00:23:27.104 - 00:24:26.776, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the. So, I mean, I think we're approaching, like, 15 people today, primarily engineering. And, I mean, to answer a question, it's a crazy amount of engineering and kind of time on operations and understanding these stacks. And I think where we really differentiate is, again, we're building the platform and doing things so we can usher in, like, a million of these and maybe like 1000 over the next one to two years. And the only way to do that is to be able to automate it. And so I think. I think the way we think about it is every incremental hour or every incremental minute we spend on the automation and making the platform better is something that we can then distribute to every single roll up on conduit that is increasingly becoming, in some ways, like a weapon, because conduit roll ups get the latest upgrades before anyone else.
00:24:26.776 - 00:25:24.214, Speaker B: And this also comes down for things like, if we're talking about peace of mind, things like security patches, or if there's a new vulnerability and a roll up framework, making sure that we can roll out those fixes as quickly as possible versus struggling again. If everything is super custom and each stack is different, then I need to apply a patch to maybe ten different code bases and then make sure I'm applying the right version for all these. It gets really tricky and easy to make a mistake, whereas if everything is uniform and automated, that becomes as easy as building one container image and then rolling that out everywhere. And so that's what we're excited about. I think it's the only way to really scale crypto is to make this as easy as possible. And I think we're excited for conduit to be like the distributors of the software and those upgrades.
00:25:25.274 - 00:25:33.334, Speaker A: Right now, you seem to be focused on EVM. Is that something that you're going to continue focusing on, or are you considering adding other types of execution environments?
00:25:34.434 - 00:26:33.538, Speaker B: We're definitely considering it. I think the kind of most salient update here today is we're really excited about stylus, which is an arbitrum orbit kind of technology, and stylus is a WaSm based VM. It will interoperate with the EVM. So, traditionally, the hardest thing about a new vm is just like, you need all the tooling, and you kind of take it for granted today, where you have block explorer, you have debuggers, you have data indexers, et cetera, et cetera. I think with any new vm, you have to build that up from scratch. I think the interesting thing about stylus is that it works side by side with the EVM, so that you still have the EVM, but you also have this new thing which can be incrementally adopted. That's what we're excited about, medium term to long term.
00:26:33.538 - 00:27:11.150, Speaker B: I think we just have to see where the demand is. And I think there's a lot of hype around new vms. I don't know that I've seen one that has really taken off. I think maybe you can look at Solana and there's some interesting things happening there, whether it is kind of Solana itself as an zero one or bringing that technology as a L2 to Ethereum. I think you still have a lot of the same challenges around the tooling. And so, for us, we're very focused on the EVM today. In the future, I think, again, we're going to be very guided based off of where the demand is and how good the tech is.
00:27:11.150 - 00:27:15.394, Speaker B: And so there are certainly exciting options out there, and we'd love to see where they are in a year or two.
00:27:15.934 - 00:27:47.044, Speaker A: Yeah, the tooling is definitely a big one. It seems like that it's something that's not talked about a lot when people are innovating in that area, because it's obviously, there's a lot of improvements that can be done to the EVM, but then you have to think about all of the supporting infrastructure and how large of a task it is to rebuild all that and get adoption across the board. You mentioned block explorers, so when someone launches a conduit chain, I guess they get a block explorer as well.
00:27:49.264 - 00:27:58.744, Speaker B: Yeah. So with conduit, every deployment comes with a block explorer. And I can show you here real quick.
00:27:58.904 - 00:28:06.004, Speaker A: Yeah, let me pull that up. Okay, cool. It's up now.
00:28:06.744 - 00:28:55.194, Speaker B: Sweet. And so this is just like the test explorer, but you can then customize this from kind of the conduit ui, so you can change this color, you can change the name, you can add a logo. And so, like, again, I think, for us, one of the comments we got early on in conduits, early life, was that if the block spore doesn't exist, like, the chain almost doesn't exist. Right. Because if you can't see what's going on on chain, it might as well kind of not exist. And so that's where I think being able to bundle in what is the minimum viable tool set is really important. Anytime you need to launch a new domain.
00:28:55.194 - 00:29:36.914, Speaker B: Again, this is something that I think a lot of users and devs take for granted on existing chains, is that a lot of the times the infra is already deployed and exists, but when you need to launch your own, suddenly that becomes a big barrier. Increasingly, I think we've been a pretty big chunk off that, but increasingly we want to do that kind of bundle in more and more of these just to streamline the process, whether that's working with really great teams. Like, for example, tenderly is a really great team we work with that offer really great debugging tools or offering these as first party products on top of conduit.
00:29:39.434 - 00:30:35.524, Speaker A: So one of the reasons that people often will deploy rollup is for custom. Customization for something that they're building a front end application for. Essentially. Like, you have this, this idea of app chains or the, like. Yeah, the roll up chain or app chain thesis, where, for example, I think you have like DeFi protocols and, um, social protocols now with like lens and even cyber connect, and then you even have, you know, warpcast and Farcaster. Like, they essentially built their own protocol to kind of, or whatever you would call that like their own backend system even. But, um, if someone were to have some type of specialization, I guess, at, when they're building out their roll up for whatever that they're focusing on at the app layer, is that something that, that you all would be able to help support and how would that look?
00:30:36.984 - 00:31:11.390, Speaker B: For sure, it's definitely something we'd like to explore. I think an underappreciated aspect of blockchains today and rollups is that they actually enable you to go or use much more compute on chain than you could on a shared layer. And so as an example, proof of play is a. Is a game on top of conduit. They have their own all three. They were spending anywhere from one to day on gas fees on arbor, from Nova, which is like insane, right?
00:31:11.462 - 00:31:14.434, Speaker A: Well, that's insane because the harvest from Nova is so cheap already.
00:31:15.894 - 00:31:49.508, Speaker B: It was supposed to be the cheapest chain. And effectively that meant they had to rate limit how many users were playing their game. Because it's like if. If each user is going to cost me like $100, then only so many people can actually play this game at a time. And so that's where launching their own chain enabled them to actually internalize those fees. And so instead of paying, like, I guess if it was at day, like six hundred k a month for gas fees, they now pay like conduit, six k a month. Right.
00:31:49.508 - 00:32:47.926, Speaker B: And they kind of internalize those fees, and it scales much, much better with their volume. And so I think an underrated aspect of, you know, again, running your own chain is you get much more compute. It's much cheaper, and there are a lot of improvements coming to the EVM. If you've heard of ref, that's a good example of pushing performance frontier. And then two, I think stylists, again, on the arbitrary side, is an example of the compute is going to be ten x better than just stock EVM. That actually means what might have been a precompile before can actually just be developed within stylus. I think that tends to be a much cleaner way, because if you look at how we do just standard web two compute today, we're very rarely going in and adding new instructions or adding new things.
00:32:47.926 - 00:33:17.594, Speaker B: It's just fast enough that we can kind of just build any of them. And so the EVM and stat, and, like all these things, they're turning complete. And so you should be able to build everything that you want. You just have traditionally been held back in terms of the gas limit, and your own chain actually enables you to lift that constraint. And so I think a lot of folks that are leaning custom have actually realized that they can either use something like a stylus or really just go faster on the EV app.
00:33:19.894 - 00:33:39.754, Speaker A: I really need to check out stylus. In fact, I think I'm going to try to bring someone on to talk specifically about that now, because you've mentioned it a few times, and I've actually heard it a lot this week and a couple of other conversations. Well, I guess it was last week when I was in Prague. I have a question now about tokens. If someone wants to launch their own network token, how does that work?
00:33:41.954 - 00:33:57.778, Speaker B: Yeah. So, going back to the or, I guess I need to share this one. So, going back to the deployment again, both these stacks support custom gas token, and so you just need to go to the UI and, like, enable it.
00:33:57.866 - 00:33:59.614, Speaker A: Oh, dang, that's cool. Okay.
00:33:59.994 - 00:34:44.963, Speaker B: Pass an address here, and then you're good to go. Very simple. And I think, like, we. I think really modular da made this possible, because ultimately, if you're using a network token for sequencer revenue, but then you're paying kind of da fees, and Ethereum, which today are cheaper, but as you know, back in December, you know, super expensive with call data, it just didn't make economic sense. And I think now that we have a bevy of kind of DA options that make that much cheaper, it's really enabling the custom gas token network token stuff that you're seeing today.
00:34:47.183 - 00:35:44.544, Speaker A: So we have covered quite a bit today. I have maybe one more question that's not specifically about conduit, how it works or anything like that, but it's more about zooming out and looking at the entire modular space and the roll up centric roadmap of Ethereum and how you chose to build in this, like, space as your next move. You kind of touched on it before, but I guess, like, what made you bet on this specific idea as a product and how it relates to how you see the future of the industry playing out? I know we've seen a lot of discussion lately around, like, vertical versus horizontal scale, scalability or scaling. And we mentioned the app chain thesis, but like, what is your general, like, thesis around how the blockchain industry is going to play out over the next five or so years and how that kind of drove you to build conduit in the first place?
00:35:45.724 - 00:36:44.540, Speaker B: Yeah, well, just to prep. I think five years is a long time in crypto. So I don't know if anybody, anybody can, can call that, I think. But just to give you like my kind of take here, I think if you look at the amount of stuff that happens on chain today, it's embarrassingly small, and that it's almost very bearish on crypto if this is the end state. And I think if you're bullish on crypto, we're going to need more of these compute environments, more of these roll ups, because visa alone is that 50k transactions a second. And there's a lot more than visa in the world, right? There's a lot of Internet applications that are even higher throughput than that. And so if you believe that on chain is freedom, if you believe that new types of applications will be able to be built uniquely on chain, really the rate limiting factor today is just how much throughput you can get.
00:36:44.540 - 00:37:36.458, Speaker B: How much on chain compute can I get? And is it cheap enough that I can actually use it? And so we're accelerationists in that sense, and we really believe that one. Like, I think horizontal scaling and vertical scaling, I think you want both is kind of the answer. And that if each specific instance of a, you know, roll ups are like horizontally, many roll ups are like horizontally scaling because you have many of them. And then if each of them is like super, super beefy like that, that's where you start to get a lot of returns, because not only do you have many of these, each of them is getting much, much more performance. That starts to look a lot similar to web two, where again, we have billions of these servers.
00:37:36.626 - 00:37:42.374, Speaker A: Yeah, you got application specific databases as the default. In web two.
00:37:44.194 - 00:38:26.896, Speaker B: Stuff is just getting better. And I think if we were in a period of, in some ways in Ethereum, there was a bit of a period of stagnation performance wise, because rollups hadn't quite taken off yet. And for decentralization purposes, you know, we couldn't push gas limits on Ethereum. L1, I think we're starting to enter that phase where performance is becoming kind of the key issue. And we're excited for what that's going to bring developers and folks in the Ethereum ecosystem, there's just a ton of this latent demand that's built up over time, and we're finally giving them the supply of compute in order to enable what they want to build. And so we're excited for that. We're super bullish on that.
00:38:26.896 - 00:39:00.758, Speaker B: I think in some ways in the future, you might not even know you're on an l five or an l ten. You'll just be on chain somewhere and the chain will be abstracted away. And so if I'm thinking through what the future looks like, I think we just want abundant on chain compute. And I think the user ultimately probably won't realize they're on chain. And so that's the world that we want to live in. We want to build freedom technology that enables folks to kind of permissionlessly interact. And we're excited for conduit to be.
00:39:00.766 - 00:39:16.974, Speaker A: At the forefront of that very last question. Do you feel that people can start experimenting with these at hackathons and start deploying stuff like this just as they experiment and learn how to use it now for sure.
00:39:17.134 - 00:39:51.694, Speaker B: I think like again, we make it super easy to spin up. We can sometimes give credits to folks at specific hackathons if like dollar 50 is too much. And I think like, you know, it's so easy to get started that I think it's really enabling anybody to deploy. And so, yeah, I think the best way is actually to just go to this deployment UI. So app dot conduit XYZ. And then we're happy to give out kind of free credits and vouchers to folks that are building something cool. So if you are definitely get in touch.
00:39:52.874 - 00:40:09.658, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thanks for coming on. If you're watching this, check out, I think the handle is conduitxyz on Twitter. And check out their website. Try deploying a roll up. And next time you're at a hackathon, experiment with it there. You never know.
00:40:09.658 - 00:40:27.494, Speaker A: The more things that you understand how to use, the more broad ideas that you might have. So thank you, Andrew for your time today. This has been really helpful. Thanks for everyone that came on and watched. This video will also be up on YouTube if you missed any part of it in a couple of hours, hopefully. If not, maybe by the end of tomorrow. And we will see you next time.
00:40:27.494 - 00:40:27.686, Speaker A: Bye.
