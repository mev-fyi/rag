00:00:00.400 - 00:00:53.565, Speaker A: 1995, you would have to do a lot of work yourself. You have to just make sure that the networking works, you have to make sure that the cybersecurity works, your firewalls are all properly configured. I have to write my own identity stack, I have to write my own payment stack, I have to write my own database stack and then build whatever application I'm building. One thing I did find in the cloud era is there was a massive amount of open innovation unleashed due to software as a service. You just say go and integrate with AWS, use a bunch of SaaS services in the backend, plug and play with all of them and then you can just build the diff of whatever new thing that you want to build that's such a powerful enabler. And so many people could now come and contribute and write code and just send it to AWS and they just taken care of. So this idea of the openness and verifiability, those properties, if you add it on to software as a service, that's a huge upgrade.
00:00:53.565 - 00:01:11.425, Speaker A: So I had that mental model or first white paper for eigenlayer even before we knew about staking or restaking was actually called eigenlayer. Unleashing the Sass arrow of crypto. We call it the SaaS era. But really open innovation is what the main driving value was. I always had this theory of decoupling trust and innovation.
