00:00:00.650 - 00:00:13.294, Speaker A: I think we're good to start, so let's go ahead and jump into it. So, Tim, before we kind of kick off the substance of the discussion today, why don't you introduce yourself, give students sense of your background, and then we'll jump into the topic of the day.
00:00:13.412 - 00:00:38.374, Speaker B: Sure. Absolutely. So everyone, my name is Tim Roughgarden. I'm a professor at Columbia University, and I'm also the head of research at e 16 Z crypto. So I've been an academic pretty much my whole life, did my PhD in computer science. Since I was a grad student, I've been very interested in the interactions between computer science and economics. So that's sort of worked on game theory and the Internet, worked on a lot on mechanism design.
00:00:38.374 - 00:01:20.440, Speaker B: And then obviously once sort of crypto and web three came along, I've never seen a technology where the economics was so deeply embedded, kind of in the technology itself. So it was like, how could I not work on this? Plus, people talk about it being early. They often are talking about like either mainstream adoption or kind of investment opportunities. But from a science side, it's really early. And so on the one hand, that can be sort of frustrating just because there's no textbooks, et cetera. On the other hand, it can be really exciting because that's when the material that gets written into the textbooks gets done at the earliest stages. So just having kind of a lot of fun focusing on research, focusing on putting educational material out there on YouTube and.
00:01:20.440 - 00:01:23.160, Speaker B: Yeah, so that's me.
00:01:23.930 - 00:01:24.534, Speaker C: Great.
00:01:24.652 - 00:02:25.260, Speaker A: Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through all this with our students, especially at a weird time for the industry. But so I want to first start off. So everybody should have watched the video, and we'll release a link to it when we also release the lecture online. So you can make sure you watch what you're supposed to be, supposed to have watched before going into this conversation, but this is going to be structured as an AMA. So if you have questions, we already received a bunch of questions online that I'll be going through, and then if you have live questions, just go ahead and drop them into the Q A section and we'll take them live as well. But we're going to use that to kind of structure the conversation and guide it towards where people had the most questions, specifically around tokenomics and around incentive mechanisms and incentive design. So first up, the first question we had, which I think is a very broad one, which I think is actually a good way to tee off the conversation, which is why do we need mechanism design or incentive design in the first place? Why is this an important field even to be spending our time on?
00:02:25.710 - 00:03:18.650, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's a fair question. Basically, however you may feel about economics and game theory, you kind of can't escape it. I mean, it's really kind of like a law of nature. And so if you're engineering a system like we are here, the design decisions that you make, whether you like it or not, there will be consequences about how your users behave, right. And little tweaks to the rule, like, I don't know, little rules around your token or other kinds of things fundamentally change the way people will interact with your protocol or with your product. And so this is like the classic rookie mistake for someone who's not accustomed to thinking kind of about economics and game theory, is you sort of look at your system, you look at how people are behaving, and you're like, oh, things would be so much better if I just changed it this way. And implicitly, you're sort of saying and assuming people keep behaving the way they did before.
00:03:18.800 - 00:03:19.114, Speaker C: Right?
00:03:19.152 - 00:03:51.880, Speaker B: So if you've ever heard about a second price auction, the obvious reaction is like, well, why choose a second price? Why not just charge something higher? Charge like the first price. But the point is the participants are going to then respond in a different way. Like if you start pricing more aggressively in an auction, they're going to respond by shading their bid back down. So basically canceling out the effect. So you really only have two options, which is either to design a system whose behavior is governed by incentives, and you don't think about the incentives or design a system whose behavior is governed by incentives. And you do think about the incentives. And I think that latter option is always the better one.
00:03:52.730 - 00:04:20.880, Speaker A: In extension of that question, one student asks, in web three products, we seem to really fixate on money as being the primary incentive that motivates people. But of course, your experience in web two products would be that you'll almost never interact with money when using web two products. Do you think that web three is intrinsically tied up with this idea of attracting people with money, monetary rewards and speculation? And do you think there's a way to move beyond that, or is this the end game? Is this the primary thing that we care about in the space?
00:04:21.410 - 00:05:14.714, Speaker B: I love that question because this is like a bee in my bonnet, in a way. And while it's true that the story of cryptocurrencies and the story of kind of blockchains and web three, those stories have been very tightly intertwined, really, ever since bitcoin, and they may continue to be tightly intertwined for a while. I do not believe that they are sort of fundamentally the same thing. I do not believe that cryptocurrency is the sort of fundamental product of blockchain technology. It's really just about, at least one broader thing that it's about is just enabling sort of property rights, enabling a notion of ownership in the digital realm, stuff we're accustomed to from our physical possessions. But if you think about it, we haven't had for stuff that we sort of have produced in the digital realm. So once you have a mechanism for establishing property rights in the digital realm, of course one thing you can do with it is create assets.
00:05:14.714 - 00:05:21.950, Speaker B: Once you have assets, of course one thing you can do with them is buy and sell them. So the technology has opened up new markets.
00:05:22.030 - 00:05:22.274, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:22.312 - 00:05:39.530, Speaker B: And that's what so much of the focus has been on, obviously, including, like, this week and last week. But really, to my mind, it's really about a new generation of Internet applications where really participants in the protocols can have a notion of ownership in that protocol.
00:05:41.470 - 00:05:42.506, Speaker C: Fair enough.
00:05:42.688 - 00:06:05.570, Speaker A: Okay, let's move into some more specific questions about, particularly the design of particular tokens. So one of the questions asked is, obviously, each of these cryptocurrencies. Let's say you're launching a cryptocurrency. You have to select the total number of units that will exist for this cryptocurrency. So one student asks, is there a basis on which one should decide the final number of units for any given cryptocurrency?
00:06:06.390 - 00:06:48.960, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question, and it's true. If you launch a protocol or an application with a token, you have to answer this question. It's kind of arbitrary, to be honest with you. There's no theory around it. And if you tried to do theory, it would basically tell you it doesn't matter, right? Like, you could have twice as many tokens and then just expect their value to be half as much or half as many tokens and have their, expect their price to be twice as much. In practice, there's some psychology around it. So when I'm talking to projects about this question, I usually just kind of say, think about what you would like.
00:06:48.960 - 00:07:34.750, Speaker B: So, at various stages of success of your project, right, which, for example, measured by market cap or something like that, what intuitively feels like you would like your token price to be like, if you take over the world, do you want your token to be $1,000? Or if you're just starting out, do you want to start by pricing it at sort of, kind of market cap? Do you want that to correspond to? And then if you can back out from those two numbers, sort of a possible token supply. So like you could say, oh, well, best case scenario is we become a trillion dollar asset, right? And so then you could have sort of a billion tokens and then at a trillion you'd be 1000 each. But it's really honestly a fairly arbitrary decision.
00:07:37.330 - 00:08:10.902, Speaker A: I would definitely echo that. Although there are some wrong answers, there's no real right answer to a total. Like one token is probably not the right number and 10 trillion is probably not the right number either. Or maybe, I don't know, maybe it is. Certainly a Googleplex is also not the right number. So there are some wrong answers, but there's no real right answer to the total number of tokens you should have. Now, one of the questions, a lot of questions that people asked were around exactly what are the different levers one can pull and what consequences that they have in the tokenomics for a particular protocol.
00:08:10.902 - 00:08:29.040, Speaker A: And so a lot of questions were kind of generally around the topic of how to manage token inflation. Many cryptocurrencies, obviously, they issue token rewards that are inflationary to other holders of that token. What is the toolkit with which you would encourage entrepreneurs to think about.
00:08:31.570 - 00:08:31.934, Speaker C: When.
00:08:31.972 - 00:08:35.250, Speaker A: And how much inflation makes sense within the context of a protocol?
00:08:35.990 - 00:09:32.914, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's another good question that comes up a lot. The first thing is just to sort of recognize the trade off you're working with. Right. So through inflation, you are punishing the holders of your token, you're diluting them through inflation. So that force is pushing you to keep them as small as possible. And on the other hand, and this is now going to be very project dependent, you may have certain behavior that you want to incentivize that you do not, at least at the beginning of the protocol's launch, that you do not have the ability to kind of incentivize other than through just the native currency of the protocol of the application. And so in practice, it tends to be a bit of a growth hack, in effect.
00:09:32.914 - 00:10:17.166, Speaker B: So in effect, you are giving early adopters ious that perhaps will be worth more at some future point, obviously for long term, some kind of inflation rate. Long term, I think can be. There's an aversion to it, I'd say just sort of stemming back from sort of Nakamoto's decision to have a hard cap of bitcoin. I don't see any reason why you couldn't have a cryptocurrency that had permanent inflation, provided it was not too big. I don't know, 1%, 2%, et cetera. I see no fundamental obstacle to that. But definitely every project, I mean, as far as what motivates people to use the protocol, run the protocol, participate in the protocol.
00:10:17.166 - 00:10:40.550, Speaker B: For that to be sustainable in the long term, you really need to think carefully about where are the incentives going to come from other than from inflation rewards. I don't view it as a permanent solution. I view it as a bridge. Once you have sort of heavy usage, where hopefully then there's other sources of revenue or incentive for the participants.
00:10:41.770 - 00:10:42.760, Speaker C: Got it.
00:10:43.850 - 00:11:10.610, Speaker A: There are a few questions around the opposite of inflation deflation. In traditional currencies, it's often viewed that deflation is very, very bad for a currency. And yet with Ethereum, for example, for ether, it's often been praised for being a deflationary currency. And bitcoin, obviously much the same thing, or at least being a disinflationary currency. Why that disconnect? Why is it that we are worried about this for currencies, but for cryptocurrencies, this seems to be a benefit.
00:11:11.270 - 00:12:05.150, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's a great question. I view this as a major open question, frankly, in the space, because I thought a lot about kind of EIP 1559, Ethereum's sort of the current transaction fee mechanism that rolled out August 2021. Thing that changed is where, with the original transaction fee mechanism in Ethereum, it was a purely inflationary cryptocurrency. The protocol itself never took ETh out of circulation, and that changed once they changed with the change of the transaction fee mechanism, where part of the transaction fees, the part that's used to pay the so called base fee, which sort of rises and falls with congestion, part of the transaction fees actually do get burned, I. E. The ETh used to pay that part of the transaction fees are removed permanently from circulation.
00:12:05.150 - 00:12:53.566, Speaker B: There are still rewards to validators in Ethereum, so you have the sort of competing inflationary and deflationary forces. But I think most of us expect long term, at least as it currently stands, ETH will be a deflationary currency. And just recently, you maybe saw the headlines, it is actually now net negative issuance since the merge that just sort of crossed that threshold, I don't know, a week ago or something. And so how should one feel about that? It's kind of funny, because my understanding is that the original proposal, so Vitalik designed the mechanism, and my understanding was that the original motivation for the burning was not actually kind of the macroeconomic consequences. It was really more just about keeping things simple. Right. You needed the base fee, so the biding was simple for users.
00:12:53.566 - 00:13:07.350, Speaker B: You needed to do something with the base fee other than pass it on to the block producer. And so what's the simplest thing you could do? Well, the simplest thing, maybe, is just to burn those base fee revenues rather than worrying about who else would it be that would receive them. And so, in effect, just like inflation.
00:13:08.090 - 00:13:25.194, Speaker A: One quick thing I want to add there. I believe that a lot of the motivation for burning the base fee was to prevent economic abstraction. And so to prevent, so that you could have USDC be used to pay miners in lieu of ether. Forcing the ether to get burned kind of enshrines the ether as being an important part of that transaction.
00:13:25.322 - 00:14:14.880, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great point. So, like I see said, if you didn't burn it, if you just sort of channeled it to some dow or something like that, literally, you could just rewrite the whole mechanism phrase in terms of USDC, and everything would work exactly the same. But once the mechanism has to burn the currency, ethereum is not in a position to burn a us dollar. It can burn a virtual representation of a us dollar, a virtual representation that lives on Ethereum. That is not the same thing as burning a us dollar, whereas the currency that itself controls, of course, it is in a position to. So you're absolutely right, it gives Eth a privileged position as a currency within the Ethereum network, which seems intuitively like probably a good thing that it's sort of earned that privilege. So I completely agree with that.
00:14:14.880 - 00:15:01.840, Speaker B: But anyway, so as a result, the thinking is that EtH is going to be deflationary. And so why did that make the proposal so popular? Right. Even though I don't think that was actually the initial main point of the proposal, it was a consequence of the proposal, and I think ultimately that's what's had the tipping point as far as public opinion. It's basically just because the same reason, as a holder of a currency, you don't like inflation, you do like deflation. Again, all of this is kind of assuming that the market cap is sort of staying fixed, as the sort of circulating supply is going up and down, right? So if the market cap stays fixed, circulating supply goes down, then the per token price goes up. So if you just sort of are holding etH, then they're just rising in price. And so that's why people who hold lots of ETH tend to be pretty excited about Efe 1559.
00:15:01.840 - 00:15:59.326, Speaker B: But it's absolutely right that if you ask any classically trained macroeconomist about deflationary currencies, they'll just tell you it doesn't work and they'll tell you stories about sort of Japan in the 1990s and so on. And I view it as a complete open question about kind of who's right here. I, on the one hand, feel like the macroeconomist of the story is being a little glib in sort know, equating a cryptocurrency like ETH with sort of a fiat currency of a sovereign nation like Japan. It's just not obvious to me that that's the same thing. On the other hand, the people on the crypto side, I think very few people have seriously thought about the macroeconomics of this. At the very least, even if you don't believe the macroeconomists, they have thrown at the gauntlet. Right.
00:15:59.326 - 00:16:08.660, Speaker B: So it really is, I think, up to people in the kind of web three space to come up with a story about why they're different, why a cryptocurrency is not like sort of.
00:16:11.750 - 00:16:12.018, Speaker C: A.
00:16:12.024 - 00:16:14.210, Speaker B: Fiat currency of some sovereign nation.
00:16:14.790 - 00:17:00.986, Speaker A: So it seems to me that the core premise of why deflationary currencies are bad is because they encourage hoarding of money and they discourage consumption, and not consuming the money that you have is obviously bad for economic activity because you want things happening. You want people exchanging money for goods and services rather than hoarding them. And so some amount of inflation, probably not too much, but not too little, seems to be like the sweet spot. Somewhere between the neighborhood of two to 5%, seems to be what most people think is healthy for an economy. It seems plausible to me that maybe the reason why this might not be as much of a concern in crypto. So how would that manifest in ethereum? It might be that people hoard ether and they don't want to spend it. They don't want to spend it on transaction fees, they don't want to use the network because they'd rather hold on to the ether rather than pay the transaction fee.
00:17:01.018 - 00:17:01.166, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:01.188 - 00:17:40.750, Speaker A: And so people, everyone, instead of consuming the block space of Ethereum, instead they're hoarding onto their ether. This seems less likely in Ethereum just because the transaction costs and the carrying costs of grabbing some ether in a moment in time and then paying it in a transaction fee is so minimal compared to what it might be for a consumer to have money in their bank account and go to a store and whip out their credit card. The lower transaction costs of actually deciding, hey, I want to buy some ether just in time and use it to pay for this transaction are so low that it's plausible that because of the nature of blockchains that it actually doesn't have that effect on consumption of block space effectively. What do you think of that argument?
00:17:41.170 - 00:17:56.770, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree, I agree. It's a plausible explanation. It's not obvious. Right. So I guess another way I'd say it is somehow.
00:17:59.270 - 00:18:00.114, Speaker C: If you're talking about.
00:18:00.152 - 00:18:41.426, Speaker B: Kind of a self contained sovereign nation, there's no way to have. Well, that's not quite true, but there seems to be a much more direct connection between economic activity and the actual kind of velocity of money. Whereas you can imagine a version, you can imagine a world in which, say, ethereum is being very heavily used in terms of the economic value, but that as far as the actual. But still, nevertheless, almost everybody is holding almost all of their eth, right? Those are not in contradiction in part because the value can be in other blockchains, it can be out there in the real world. So there's all this economic value that can be on the network, which is.
00:18:41.448 - 00:18:43.522, Speaker C: Kind of on top of whatever value.
00:18:43.576 - 00:18:45.460, Speaker B: That might be captured in the currency itself.
00:18:47.290 - 00:18:47.846, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:47.948 - 00:19:46.950, Speaker A: I think the other thing that is connected to this is very few people today have their costs denominated in ether and of course blockspace, because there's an instantaneous auction that's taking place in real time. Part of the reason why in economics it matters that inflation or deflation are happening is that prices tend to be sticky. And especially when it comes to wages, wages tend to be very sticky. And so very often wages lag the real changes in prices, which causes some economic friction, let's say in ether. That doesn't seem to happen to block space, right? There's no stickiness around block, as we can see, the moment that NFT starts getting auctioned off, the price of block know goes to insane prices. And so it may just be that because there is no stickiness in the price of block space, that it obviates the entire reason why deflation or inflation are problematic within normal kind of human nation state economies.
00:19:47.450 - 00:19:48.354, Speaker C: That's interesting.
00:19:48.492 - 00:19:50.540, Speaker B: I hadn't thought about that point. That's interesting.
00:19:53.630 - 00:19:57.050, Speaker A: I'm spitballing, so I don't know if that's a sufficient answer either.
00:19:57.120 - 00:20:13.762, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I mean, it's something to think about though. Yeah, no, that's a good point. I thought about the sort of the stickiness of wages, and I like as being one court. Like, there's no analog of that, really.
00:20:13.896 - 00:20:14.242, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:14.296 - 00:20:22.600, Speaker B: In sort of, sort of a cryptocurrency to push the other side a little bit. I don't know. There is still some kind of.
00:20:24.250 - 00:20:24.934, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:20:24.972 - 00:20:31.690, Speaker B: I mean, so I still feel like there's some appeal to the intuition.
00:20:35.630 - 00:20:35.994, Speaker C: About.
00:20:36.032 - 00:20:50.654, Speaker B: The monetary supply being tied to usage as opposed to just having fluctuating usage show up kind of entirely in the velocity. But I don't have any backing for that.
00:20:50.692 - 00:20:54.446, Speaker C: But I think that's also a gut.
00:20:54.478 - 00:21:13.270, Speaker B: Feeling I think people reasonably have. Now, all of these can't simultaneously be true. Right. I think this is a really important question. And really, researchers can actually make progress on this, right. Five years from now, we will know more about this than we do right now. And those will be widely read, important papers.
00:21:13.270 - 00:21:20.294, Speaker B: I would like to see more smart people thinking hard about that.
00:21:20.492 - 00:21:21.906, Speaker C: Completely agreed.
00:21:22.098 - 00:22:10.070, Speaker A: The interesting thing about crypto today is that there are very few businesses that have their costs denominated in crypto. There are a lot of businesses that have their costs denominated in dollars or in oil or in lumber or whatever, but for the most part, the primary businesses that have their costs denominated in crypto are exchanges. And for them, I'm not talking about their liabilities. I'm talking about the need to pay gas fees in order to process withdrawals and transactions and rebalancing wallets and so on. It's a relatively small amount among all these exchanges that they're paying in terms of fees. And so until I think, again, that's a disanalogy between. There are a lot of people in the normal economy who have their costs and dollars, and so they need to make sure that they have predictability and they have to hoard some amount of dollars in order to protect themselves against price movements.
00:22:10.070 - 00:22:48.438, Speaker A: And that might also be, again, if you need to pay fees, very often you can just pay those fees just in time, assuming that the network itself is not going crazy at any given moment. So we also had another question about bitcoin. And so, of course, ether is now a deflationary currency. Bitcoin is meant to be a disinflationary currency, or I guess deflationary if you include lost coins. So the question is, what effect is the hard cap of bitcoin of only being able to have 21 million bitcoin that can ever be mined? What effect does that have on its long term sustainability when there are no more block rewards? How is the bitcoin blockchain going to.
00:22:48.444 - 00:22:49.746, Speaker C: Continue to be maintained.
00:22:49.938 - 00:23:31.342, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's a good question. And also potentially sort of an open question, maybe just to sort of take one step back. It's also worth asking, why this cap? If you wanted to sort of tell a story about it being good, what might that be? And among other things, I mean, really it's come to, and I appreciate it for this point, 21 million. It sort of symbolizes sort of a very unique aspect of blockchain technology, which is the ability to make credible commitments.
00:23:31.486 - 00:23:31.842, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:31.896 - 00:23:48.742, Speaker B: So the fact that the management of the money supply is programmatic, it's hard coded into how the protocol works. Obviously, you could have a hard fork, but at least absent a hard fork, you know exactly what the monetary spy is going to be.
00:23:48.796 - 00:23:49.014, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:49.052 - 00:24:13.200, Speaker B: And that's been sort of very powerful for many people. It's not just that, it's kind of a religion. I actually think that's fair. There's something accurate in there about what makes blockchain technology special. Right. So it's not the hard cap per se. It's about the ability to tie one's hands in a credible way so that you can't change the rules later.
00:24:13.200 - 00:24:28.918, Speaker B: And I do think that's a powerful aspect of this technology. Now, that said, you could imagine a different version of bitcoin where instead of the inflation rate bottoming out at zero, it bottoms out at like 1%.
00:24:29.084 - 00:24:29.654, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:29.772 - 00:25:22.454, Speaker B: But again, it's still all programmatically encoded in there. So that version of bitcoin, for me, still carries that message of the ability to make credible commitments without this sort of hard cap. There's parts of the decision that I really kind of appreciate, and then there's the fact that then I'll get to answering the question, which is like, what are the actual consequences of forcing the hard cap? Because it does. I mean, it actually makes the future of bitcoin a bit unclear, frankly. And you could imagine a world where there's a hard fork of bitcoin to actually keep sort of a lower bound on the block rewards at some point in the future. We'll see, obviously, but it's easy to imagine that happening. Okay, so what are the consequences? Well, bitcoin, the protocol itself, never takes coins out of circulation, haseeb, as you say.
00:25:22.454 - 00:26:05.954, Speaker B: I mean, there is kind of a natural loss. People lose their keys or whatever else, so in some sense, it is leaking. But the protocol itself does not take coins out of circulation, so it's purely inflationary. So the only way you could have a hard cap is to, at some point, never print any more coins, which in particular means, like, you cannot reward a producer of a block with newly minted coins of the cryptocurrency. They must be getting their revenue from other sources. So that's the first point. Now, if the revenue the block producers are getting from other sources stays big, then at least bitcoin could conceivably still function perfectly well.
00:26:05.954 - 00:26:54.002, Speaker B: There's still other issues because block rewards also have a very nice property that they're exactly the same, block to block, whereas other revenue sources actually could vary by an order of magnitude, block to block. And that actually causes some problematic game theory, which if people want to, we can get into, but it's probably a little bit in the weeds, so let's put that aside. And so if the other sources of revenue stays big or becomes big, so it supplants the block reward, well, then all of the rest of the incentives kind of work in the same way. Right? So then sort of miners are incentivized to kind of invest in a lot of hash rate. If a lot of people are investing in hash rates around the bitcoin protocol, that means it's very expensive. You have to basically come up with an equivalent amount of hash rate if you want to sort of take it over through a 51% attack and so on. The worry is that the other sources of revenue would not stay that big.
00:26:54.002 - 00:27:10.630, Speaker B: So what would the other sources of revenue be? Well, one would be transaction fees. And if you go back and read the bitcoin white paper, which, by the way, I do at least once a year, it's really just always remarkable to go back and reread it. That was clearly nakamoto's vision. Block rewards would go away and be supplanted by transaction fees.
00:27:11.130 - 00:27:11.880, Speaker C: And.
00:27:14.490 - 00:28:03.770, Speaker B: One can understand that, right? You might think, okay, well, if block rewards are going to go to zero in 21 40, if people are still using bitcoin in 21 40, it must have some serious value for people. So presumably they're paying some transaction fees, non trivial transaction fees. On the other hand, if you look just historically about transaction fees have not really been making up the loss and block reward so far. So I don't know that there's great evidence for that. The other thing is sort of, as was alluded to earlier, transaction fees are really set by the auction for block space. How much money you're making from transaction fees is kind of just a function of the crossing of the supply and demand curves for block space. And meanwhile, what you actually would like them to be set, but you'd like them to be set by security considerations.
00:28:03.770 - 00:29:03.686, Speaker B: And this is how you would set block rewards. You would kind of say, like, okay, how expensive do I want a 51% attack to be? Okay, how much do I need to then pay miners so that they invest sufficient amount so that a 51% attack is sufficiently expensive? So that's, I would say, the most natural way to figure out what you'd like block producers to be making. You would start from an economic security goal, and you would back out what you have to pay the miners so that the attack is that expensive, whereas the transaction fees, that is not set by any thought experiment, that is not set by the protocol at all. That is set purely by sort of the external world and the supply demand dynamics for bitcoin block space. So you're thinking about it, you're kind of hoping you get lucky, right? You're just kind of hoping the supply and demand curves cross at a price that's high enough, that is at least as large as what you would have wanted to pay the miners, based purely on economic security considerations. So that, to me, is a little bit of a red flag that these two things are kind of decoupled. And so that makes it vulnerable.
00:29:03.686 - 00:29:42.090, Speaker B: Concretely, if the transaction fees stayed very close to zero as block rewards went very close to zero, well, then basically, why would anybody buy, like, a whole bunch of specialized hardware to sort of solve proof of work, crypto puzzles and that kind of thing? So you would expect kind of really minimal effort to be put in by participants if the rewards were minuscule. And that would make the protocol very easy to take over with a 51% attack. And then, of course, you couldn't use it for high value transactions. So that's sort of the still unresolved. I mean, it's decades out in the future, but again, it's a potentially existential risk to bitcoin as a valuable protocol.
00:29:43.870 - 00:30:07.102, Speaker A: That makes sense. So, speaking more broadly about mechanism design, and when you're looking at some of these problems, what are some of the methods for actually testing mechanisms and observing their consequences? So if you're building a protocol, do you recommend people just build something and throw it on a testnet and see what happens? What is in the toolkit for testing these things and validating assumptions?
00:30:07.246 - 00:30:54.318, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's a great question. So there's kind of levels at which you can stress test a proposal that sort of get more and more expensive, but also then more and more confidence building. So, honestly, the first thing is to just get all your smartest friends sit in front of a whiteboard for hours and try to break your mechanism. There's a sense in which mechanism design is. It's a little bit of a similar mentality as cryptography, I would say. Right. In cryptography, you think about some sort of cryptographical primitive or protocol or whatever, and then even though you were the one that designed the protocol, you sort of take off kind of your white hat and you put on your black hat and you kind of say like, okay, forget about all that.
00:30:54.318 - 00:31:25.146, Speaker B: All I want to do is break this protocol. How would I possibly do it? And to some extent in mechanism design, you want to be able to kind of play those different roles. So on the one hand, you're the one who came up with the design, so you probably like it. You're like, oh, you think it's pretty cool. So I would suggest sleep on it and wake up as a different person, wake up as a person that either just wants to break the mechanism or that just wants to squeeze as much money as possible out of the mechanism and pretend like you were not disassociate yourself from you being the one who built it.
00:31:25.168 - 00:31:25.306, Speaker A: Right.
00:31:25.328 - 00:31:58.642, Speaker B: Because then you're going to be biased toward it working. Right. So that's the first thing. If you're contemplating a particular mechanism, get in that adversarial mindset, get some smart friends, spend several hours in the whiteboard, see what you can do. Tons of mechanisms will fail this stage, right. And this is kind of a relatively low investment way to filter out lots of mechanisms and obviously especially get some pairs of eyes that have some practice breaking mechanisms and classic kind of rookie mistakes. So if it passes that test, there's a couple of routes you can go.
00:31:58.642 - 00:32:30.554, Speaker B: I mean, one thing you can do is you can do some math, which is a lot of what, the kind of stuff that I do. So you can set up a mathematical model of kind of, who are your participants? What might their preferences be? You can ask, okay, what are the equilibria then? Sort of the mechanism for participants of that type? Maybe you could prove that the equilibrium have the properties you want. For example, something that can be done in parallel. So these are not mutually exclusive. They're kind of additive. You can also probe through simulation.
00:32:30.682 - 00:32:30.926, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:30.948 - 00:33:21.534, Speaker B: And so this, again is a step before actually rolling out a testnet. In particular, there's this distributed system out there, which is, which is the source of a lot of problems. But notice there's a lot of stress testing you can do before you even kind of put it into like a big network into a blockchain, right. So you can even just sort of have basically a simulation of your mechanism just on a single computer. You sort of program behavior for a bunch of participants in your protocol, concretely, right? So maybe you have some new Amm design, right? And so that's some new formula by which you're sort of quoting prices for trades of different sizes. So you don't need a blockchain to sort of test the design itself. You might need a blockchain to test mev or something like that.
00:33:21.534 - 00:34:03.338, Speaker B: But just to see the dynamics of the actual amm, you can just code that up locally. You can code up models of traders, give them utility functions, or just programmatically give them behavior and then sort of just let it run and sort of see what happens. And often the tricky part with the simulation approach is just usually the strategy space for participants is really big. So, like for trading, you could imagine arbitrarily complicated sort of trading strategies as a function of what's happened in the past. And you don't have time. You can't just exhaustively search through all possible strategies that anybody might possibly be using. So you somehow need to find the sweet spot where you're exploring enough of the different strategy space.
00:34:03.338 - 00:34:39.270, Speaker B: You feel like you are basically covering the range of behaviors your mechanism might exhibit. But at the same time, it's kind of small enough. You actually have the computational power to sort of try all those out and sort of gather the data. So that's the simulation approach. And then it does become sort of testnet. And then ultimately the other thing you just have to know is no matter how much time and investment you put in, you won't really know until main net. And so the other thing is, at the beginning, you have to be ready for course corrections.
00:34:39.270 - 00:35:10.210, Speaker B: First of all, you should launch with a plan of what you're going to monitor. Like what are you looking out for? What are the red flags? And then also have some initial thoughts about if it goes wrong in various ways, what are your options to hopefully repair it a little bit. So if you see a new project and there's some issues with the mechanism and they're tweaking it, that's to be expected. That's not necessarily a red flag for the project. No matter how hard you stress test it, there will be still things that you didn't anticipate.
00:35:11.510 - 00:35:40.940, Speaker A: Okay, speaking of issues in mechanism design, there's been a lot of criticism of web three games, especially the first generation of web three games, like Axio Infinity, like step in for having unsustainable tokenomics or even ponzi like tokenomics. What do you think about the first generation of onchain games and what they could have done or what they can do still to improve the sustainability of their vector design? What do you think they did wrong?
00:35:41.810 - 00:36:10.226, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's a fair question. I don't know that I'm enough of. Let me sort of not maybe comment on any of the specific projects. One thing that's still actually like an open question in my mind, actually is like the token design question for web three games, fundamentally different than it is for other types of projects, right.
00:36:10.328 - 00:36:10.738, Speaker C: Whether it's.
00:36:10.754 - 00:36:56.020, Speaker B: I don't know, it could be l ones, it could be d five projects at the application layer or whatever. I feel like there's sort of a tacit assumption in the space right now that they are. That somehow there is this special game token design question, which it's not obvious to me that's true. So zooming out, I just kind of feel like what's really hard is just. And I remember I saw this. I think the most popular question that was asked was like, if you're launching a token, how can tokenomics help you? Or something like this, right? The elephant in the room is just often like, why is the token not going to go to zero?
00:36:56.790 - 00:36:57.540, Speaker C: Right?
00:37:00.470 - 00:37:47.730, Speaker B: Presumably if you're launching a project with a token, that's a question you care about. And tokenomics is the tool that helps you think through, why might it not go to zero? And honestly, I think there's still a lot of work to do. There's a couple of different things, but I think we have a lot to go with our understanding and our best practices around this. And it's occluded by the fact that there are some things where it's not obvious why they're not zero and they're very far from zero. It's very high. I mean, even sort of bitcoin, it's not obvious what's setting the price of bitcoin, other than what people are willing to pay, which at some level I'm fine with. Like if people are willing to pay something for something, by definition in my book, it sort of has value.
00:37:47.730 - 00:39:21.150, Speaker B: But I don't know how you would in 2009 kind of say like, you know what? I think the equilibrium price for bitcoin is going to be sort of $20,000 per token because of the following factors. I have no idea what story you would tell yourself there are. If you think about it, there's other reasons why you could have a lower bound on a token's value, the most obvious one would be if it was in effect a claim on actual real economic value in the real world, like it was a claim on a share of sort of future cash flows, then obviously it's going to have some lower bound on the price because it's just tied directly to economic value outside of the cryptocurrency we've mentioned the example of ETh. Right? So there, it's unclear what the magnitude is, but at least if there's interest in using the Ethereum blockchain, then there is necessarily demand for ETH. So in the same ways that you have to pay your us taxes and us dollars, you have to pay your base fees in etH, right? So is that enough to justify four figure price? Not clear, but I mean, at least you got to figure that as long as people want to use Ethereum, that imposes some lower bound on the price of ETH. And then there's other things like, I don't know. So if it's like a governance token, you could posit that people do have some intrinsic, or at least certain people have intrinsic value for being able to contribute to governance decisions and protocol.
00:39:21.150 - 00:39:47.340, Speaker B: Again, you could ask, okay, but maybe that's bigger than zero. How much bigger than zero? Less clear. And so I would say rather, I'm not that interested in picking on the game space per se, because just I think broadly we have a lot of work to do, just four projects that have tokens. Right. So what's the story? Why in the long term that token has value?
00:39:48.510 - 00:39:59.786, Speaker A: Well, as a gentle response to that, I think crypto is in good company in that regard, in that we don't even know what makes dollar is valuable.
00:39:59.978 - 00:40:00.334, Speaker C: Right?
00:40:00.372 - 00:41:01.582, Speaker A: So obviously people keep telling us that they don't understand how inflation works, they don't understand how the supply of dollars corresponds to the price of dollars, and why when the GFC happened and there was a massive amount of financial stimulus, we didn't see inflation spike, and then all of a sudden we do see inflation spike. It seems actually that the supply and demand for dollars is also a bit mysterious. And I don't think it's that people were forecasting tax revenues, which is the fundamental value of us dollars, so to speak, or the sink for us dollars to change, either. The reality is that most things, I think, in the economy are priced more than they're valued. But I think it's pretty clear that we've had a lot more data on dollars and sovereign currencies than we have on cryptocurrencies, and they're certainly more exotic. But this fundamental thing that, okay, we can't run a DCF or a discounted cash flow analysis on ethereum per se. If you talk to forex traders and you ask them like, okay, how are you valuing this stuff? The answer is that it's all relative.
00:41:01.582 - 00:41:12.594, Speaker A: It's not in absolute terms, it's a dollar against a yen. It's not. Well, here's how I arrived at the valuation for the yen. So anyway, that's an aside. I don't think it's.
00:41:12.642 - 00:41:22.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. And you can point to equities too. Right. And kind of try. Sometimes it's hard to come up with stories that would predict the prices. Right. So I agree.
00:41:22.730 - 00:42:08.680, Speaker B: And this is what just generally something I'm struggling with. I kind of feel like we need more synthesis of rigorous macroeconomic thinking, kind of in web three. On the other hand, like, I don't want to inherit the entire kind of minefield that macroeconomics for sort of, you know, you know, for the global economy has. Right. So, so I'm trying to figure out, like what pieces in crypto can we sort of pick off that we could conceivably solve or at least get much better understanding of without as a prerequisite having to solve these open issues in traditional macro. And I think there are some, but it's currently on my mind, like, what are those little pieces to pick off?
00:42:09.210 - 00:42:09.960, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:42:10.570 - 00:42:20.700, Speaker A: So another question, I'm going to keep it kind of focused on the questions that are top of mind for somebody who's thinking about launching a token, even though I know some of these.
00:42:23.970 - 00:42:24.238, Speaker C: You.
00:42:24.244 - 00:42:35.650, Speaker A: Might not have good answers to. One person asks, when should a project launch their own application specific chain and ecosystem, as opposed to launching an application on top of another ecosystem?
00:42:37.270 - 00:43:14.042, Speaker B: That's another great question. Yeah, I mean, it's really an open question, and even the smartest people I know in the space have changed their minds many times on the answer to this question. Probably there'll be some mix. I think I also saw in the list of questions, the question itself suggested some of the trade offs. Right. So if you're just part of a general purpose smart contract platform, interoperability is one of the big. Or, sorry.
00:43:14.042 - 00:44:04.480, Speaker B: Composability is one of sort of the big advantages. If you look at so called DeFi Legos, they're really kind of exploiting the fact that they all just sort of live on the same kind of EVM blockchain. On the other hand, if you're sharing block space with other applications, you might get crowded out, for example. So you might want to decouple the experience of your users from NFT drops suddenly showing up and kind of clogging up the blockchain and that kind of thing. It's hard to see that that's a very legitimate, I think, goal. It depends on the project. Right.
00:44:04.480 - 00:45:00.560, Speaker B: And then another question is just what kind of validator set are you happy with? And this will also vary from project to project, right. So if you want kind of like max decentralization, minimize trust, that's also going to then push you to whichever l one has sort of the biggest, best validator set. Whereas if you're like, you know what, we're just trying to make something that lots of people use, and maybe it's okay if it's just like proof of authority with ten servers that we own or something, then obviously the app chain thing starts looking very attractive. And you can ask, okay, well, to what extent is that really crypto anymore? But I'm putting that aside. It's clear there's some spectrum. It's clear to me there will be projects that choose one of them that benefit more from being on the general platform, and there'll be others that benefit from app specific. As far as the relative magnitude of the two, that's anybody's guess.
00:45:02.690 - 00:45:44.080, Speaker A: Got it. Okay, that's a fair enough answer. The last question, you noted this as being the most highest voted question, so I feel like we should at least speak to it, even if not address it outright. It kind of speaks to when a token is launched. Very often there's some distribution of the token supply between some kind of community pool, there's some set aside for founders and for investors and so on. And the question is, how is that generally decided? And is there some minimum percentage that you think is okay to be held by investors or by kind of a crowd sale or whatever?
00:45:44.450 - 00:46:30.486, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's a good question. Right. When you talk about kind of like equity and kind of token allocation, there's sort of two things to think about. One is just the sort of start state, and then the second thing is kind of how it evolves, both of which are an issue. So when people talk about potential sort of centralization risks around tokens, one thing that could be a problem is if just very few people get an enormous share of the initial distribution. A second sort of failure mode is if even with a fair initial distribution, the dynamics of the protocol somehow push you toward having, after some period of time, having a small number of people having a big share of it. Honestly, this is mostly just done through comps, through comparisons.
00:46:30.486 - 00:47:37.086, Speaker B: In my experience, I think there's basically certain cultural norms around how big or small some of those numbers should be. I'm not going to quote any numbers now because I probably won't remember them quite right. But definitely, if you ask around, you will get, in my experience, semi consistent answers about, for example, what's the maximum fraction that you would like to go to insiders, where insiders presumably means sort of the team and kind of venture capital firms and sort of early investors, and there'll be some maximum number that conforms to the current sort of norms in web three. And certainly in general, there's definitely a community focus in web three quite strong. So it's generally viewed as like, a good objective is to kind of maximize the amount that goes to the community. And that could be directly through like an airdrop. It could be more in sort of a dow that then hopefully will be community controlled.
00:47:37.086 - 00:48:16.350, Speaker B: So going to the community can sort of mean multiple things, but generally you're trying to balance, on the one hand, you want sort of to get enough initial investment to just get things off the ground and get some Runway, which presumably is going to mean giving away some of your token allocation. Presumably you need some for your team to align their incentives with the success of your project. But sort of, I'd say the culture is a little bit try to minimize some of those two numbers subject to viability, and then maximize sort of what goes to the community directly or indirectly.
00:48:19.970 - 00:48:46.766, Speaker A: Yeah, if I could just add a little bit of detail there. So from the perspective of investor, I would say most of the time it's really just norms. People are going to just do whatever they're doing around them. They were doing that in 2017 when the norms were very, very different. There was no community allocation, there was just the ICO allocation. Now there's this community airdrop portion, and people try 50% is often seen as this magic number, for whatever reason. I think the reality this is going to be fluid.
00:48:46.766 - 00:49:35.894, Speaker A: It's going to keep changing as norms change. And as for the fundraising environment changes. And most people just do what they saw the person before them do, and they assume that that's right, and no one's going to yell at them if they do that, and that's usually correct, is that no one will yell at you if you do that. And if you deviate too much from it and your community pool is 10% and your airdrop is zero or a quarter of 1%, then people on Twitter will yell at you. And that's usually what ends up motivating a lot of founders is they don't want to get yelled at because they don't really know what they're supposed to be doing. And so assume people yelling at them is the best barometer of kind of course correction in building a protocol. I generally speaking think there's been a lot of copycatting and kind of as a result, a lot of misallocation of resources because of people just kind of blindly assuming that, oh, I should airdrop this much of my token because this person did it a while back.
00:49:35.894 - 00:50:25.398, Speaker A: And that just seems like it'll make no one yell at me if I do it. That's a topic for another day, though, by and large there's a post that I was trying to look up, but I'm forgetting it now, but I'll dig it up and I'll post it in the notes that we can send out. But there was somebody who did a good analysis of what the token distributions looked like for a very large number of projects and just kind of mapped them all out, looked at what the averages were, and very often, again, if you don't want to think too hard about it, you just want to say, look, I'll just do whatever the people before me did. You generally can't go too wrong, but you're also probably not going to end up optimizing the answers to these questions. Now, it's not necessarily the thing you have to optimize. The thing you really have to get right when you're building something is building a great product or a great protocol or a great mechanism or whatever, and your token distribution is one part of that. But you don't need to nail it in order to have a great product.
00:50:25.398 - 00:50:28.230, Speaker A: You need to nail the product in order to have a great token.
00:50:29.930 - 00:50:30.680, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:50:32.910 - 00:51:02.334, Speaker A: Okay, so I want to kind of dive back a little bit because there are a few questions on amms, and this is one of the things obviously you covered in your talk and something you spent a lot of time on in your own research. So one of the questions, relatively basic question is why do centralized market maker or, sorry, centralized exchanges with order books have poor liquidity compared to amms? It seems very often that amms actually have denser on screen liquidity than what you would see on many exchanges.
00:51:02.382 - 00:51:03.300, Speaker C: Why is that?
00:51:03.910 - 00:51:38.560, Speaker B: Yeah, that's an important, so, so it's going to depend on know token pair, which asset pair you're talking about. So some markets are thick, meaning that there's lots of buyers, lots of sellers, lots of people wanting to trade. Others are thin, meaning there's very few. So if it's eth, it's going to be thick. If it's some long tail token, like outside the, I don't know, coin gecko 500 or something like that, then that's going to generally be thin with few traders. And so I usually just sort of explain it. Imagine a limit order book where you're the only person who shows up.
00:51:38.560 - 00:52:16.362, Speaker B: You show up, you want to buy some quantity at some price. Nothing happens until someone shows up on the other side of the market. Whereas amms basically pre commit to an entire trading schedule up front. Now you have to entice liquidity providers to deposit kind of tokens, like into the amm, right? They're the ones making the market. But once you have that, let's say it's just like the most basic uniswap v two x y equals k curve. Literally, it literally never runs out of liquidity, right. The price goes crazy.
00:52:16.362 - 00:52:37.140, Speaker B: The price will go to zero or infinity as you approach zero in one of the two sets of reserves. But you can always trade, like if you show up, right? And so that's just a very different property than limit order books, where really you need kind of active market makers for them to function well.
00:52:38.870 - 00:53:30.930, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a little bit of this also comes to the fact that a lot of order books actually will not allow you to place liquidity outside of a given range. And so if there were such a thing. Right, so like you said, uniswap will. If you decide that you want to sell eth for $1, even if there's an infinitesimal amount of liquidity in the pool, they will just buy up all your ether at extremely, extremely low prices. If one person puts on a very small amount of liquidity into a uniswap pool, a normal exchange will not do that because it's kind of stupid. There's no point in showing you an order book that has this gigantic tail at Apple shares being worth $1. But of course, many people would be willing to say, yes, I'll buy all your apple shares at $1, but the order book just won't show you that, right? So instead, you could actually just sweep the entire order book.
00:53:30.930 - 00:54:11.680, Speaker A: But in reality, there would be willing people at sufficiently low prices to buy your apple shares at extremely low prices. You're just not seeing them on the exchange. And so I think there is that idea that a lot of that is just an artifact of the way that the exchanges are built, as opposed to some fundamental property that wouldn't be there in a centralized market, that would be there on an amm. It might be true, though, if the value actually went to zero, that you could instantaneously sweep an amm and you couldn't do that to an order book because people could pull their orders, obviously, and they would. But anyway, I think a little bit of this is an artifact rather than a deep property.
00:54:12.850 - 00:54:24.402, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe. I will say if you convince someone to provide liquidity to an amm with one click, they've basically filled out the entire order book, right?
00:54:24.456 - 00:54:24.818, Speaker A: Yes.
00:54:24.904 - 00:54:36.680, Speaker B: Whereas one click on a limited order book is like one. I mean, it does kind of make it really easy to just kind of COVID the whole price range on the AMm side.
00:54:39.230 - 00:55:04.266, Speaker A: Definitely. So another question is about the concept of LVR. It might be actually worth for you to reiterate a little bit for those who've forgotten what LVR is and how it works. The specific question is how does the unhedgible component of impermanent loss that you mentioned, LVR, how is that isolated when you do the calculation for what LVR is?
00:55:04.388 - 00:55:04.770, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:04.840 - 00:55:49.742, Speaker B: So there's different ways to characterize and sort of motivate LVR. So loss versus rebalancing. And one way is through a hedging story, which will provide kind of the most direct answer to this. So the usual narrative about, or at least certainly in the early days, the narrative around amms was that basically, if you're going to provide liquidity to an am, you're fundamentally going long on the tokens. If you're providing like ETH and know whatever may happen with the price, you will be holding some amount of eth that entire time. So it's fundamentally like a long strategy. And if you're not doing anything else, that's true.
00:55:49.876 - 00:55:50.270, Speaker C: Right.
00:55:50.340 - 00:56:34.400, Speaker B: But you could imagine doing other things outside of the amm to offset your exposure to the movement of the prices of those assets. And so here's maybe the most naive thing you could do. Conceptually at least, how cheaply you can do this kind of in practice is a different question. So let's set that aside. So suppose you want to sort of earn a share of the trading fees of some amm. You feel like that's sort of a good way to make some yield, but you're actually kind of bearish on the assets, or at least you don't know. Right? So it's ETH and USDC say, and you're like, I don't want this to be part of a bet that Eth's price is going to go up.
00:56:34.400 - 00:57:35.950, Speaker B: So what you could do is then you could just have a sort of mirror position, sort of a reflected position, copying your Eth position in the amm, but then negative. So if you start out by buying five eth, if you deposit five eth in the amm, so you basically long five eth, you could have a position outside of it, say on a centralized exchange where you short five e so that your net position is zero. And then every time a trade happens to the amm, where, for example, the five eth goes down to three e, then you're going to sort of buy back two eth, so your position outside of it is minus three. And then conversely, and so you're just always kind of canceling out your Eth position in the Amm with a sort of mirrored position outside of it. Now the question is how well do you do? Right, if this is your strategy now, we've hedged everything that we can hedge, or at least we've hedged all of the eth exposure. And so what's left is what I mean by the unhedgible part.
00:57:36.020 - 00:57:36.254, Speaker A: Okay?
00:57:36.292 - 00:58:14.646, Speaker B: So we've modded out these sort of cancelled out movements in ETh. All that we're left with is sort of the costs and benefits of being in the amm. The benefits of being in the Amm is just you get a share of the trading fees, so that's just going to be a function of volume and whatever sort of the fee of the pool is. And then lever is all about the cost. Okay? And so why is there any cost at all, you might wonder? So it's because of adverse selection. So you've basically agreed to make a market, you've agreed to take sort of either side of a trade at a given price. If someone who knows more about the actual price than you do comes in and trades, you're going to be taking the wrong end of that trade.
00:58:14.646 - 00:59:02.430, Speaker B: So if an arbitrary is sort of making money, if you're enabling an arbitrary to make money, it will sort of be at your cost. So that's what I mean by adverse selection. You might wind up only fulfilling trades in the direction that hurts you. The reason the trade is happening is because somebody knows that you have a sort of stale version of the price. And if you think about it in amms, this is a real thing in amms, right? So for various reasons, there's a twelve second block time on Ethereum, for example. So it's common for the spot price of an amm to be at least a little out of whack of what you find on sort of the open market, which would say like the median on a collection of centralized exchanges or something like that. And so as a result, as a liquidity provider in amm, you are being forced basically to execute trades at suboptimal prices.
00:59:02.430 - 01:00:02.634, Speaker B: Now, remember, we had this sort of hedging strategy we were doing on like a centralized exchange. In our analysis, we're thinking of that happening at the market prices. So you're making one trade in amm at a suboptimal price worse than the market price, and then your offsetting trade is at the actual market price. So overall your ETH positions cancel out in some sense, but you'll wind up worse off. So, for example, if the current spot price of ETH in your amm is 1000, but it really should be 2000, it's 2000 on the open market, arbitraries are going to come sort of correct the amm price, move it to 2000. You'll basically wind up selling a bunch of ETH at a price that's less than 2000. And then meanwhile, when you buy it back on the centralized exchange, you'll have to buy it back at 2000 because you'll be paying more to maintain your short position than what you received in exchange for the sale you did on the aMm.
01:00:02.634 - 01:00:18.710, Speaker B: So that difference is going to be some positive amount. It's purely from adverse selection, it's purely from the fact that you're getting suboptimal execution prices on the amm. And that is one of the characterizations of lever. That's lever for a single trade, and then for a bunch of trades, you just added up over all the trades.
01:00:20.890 - 01:00:22.950, Speaker C: Got it. Okay.
01:00:23.020 - 01:00:54.980, Speaker A: I think that mostly addresses all of the questions. If anybody has any more kind of last questions that's burning in your heart of hearts, feel free to toss it into the chat. I guess the last question that I'll end things with, unless somebody wants to jump in, is it's a bit of an unfair one to throw you, but I'll do it anyway because it's on here about FTX. How do you think the collapse of FTX is going to affect the digital currency or Defi world?
01:00:56.870 - 01:01:39.018, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know that I have so much to add to this beyond what sort of many people have said. It's obviously a setback for the space. I think. I think it does move the timeline back a bit, just as far as when there'll be sort of widespread adoption and credibility. I think that widespread adoption, it is inevitable, in my opinion, or at least we'll see. Time could prove me wrong, but that's my belief, honestly. I think once we see the breakthroughs of the application layer that I'm expecting to see in the next sort of five plus years, this goes back to the question, actually, about blockchains and cryptocurrencies.
01:01:39.018 - 01:02:16.170, Speaker B: The stories have been very intertwined, but I don't view them as fundamentally as one fundamentally needing the other. At least I don't view blockchains as fundamentally needing cryptocurrencies. There'll just be a day, I think, where in the same way, when you're using web two products, you're not really thinking about kind of anything financial. That'll also be true in sort of the web three world, and then it'll be much more clear that the business of centralized exchanges, FTX, et cetera, it's just something other than web three, other than the sort of next generation of the Internet. I do think that's years off, unfortunately, but my vision for that, it remains unchanged.
01:02:17.150 - 01:02:18.090, Speaker C: Got it.
01:02:18.240 - 01:02:24.378, Speaker A: Well, for my part, as long as people like you are still here, I'm not too worried that we're going to be going not.
01:02:24.384 - 01:02:25.690, Speaker B: I'm not going anywhere.
01:02:26.210 - 01:02:34.980, Speaker A: I'm glad to hear that. Well, Tim, it was a pleasure. Thanks for popping in. Oh, last question from Beepler. Tim, what do you read?
01:02:35.510 - 01:02:37.794, Speaker C: What do I read? What do you read?
01:02:37.912 - 01:02:57.320, Speaker B: What do I read? Let's see. Not a lot of fiction these days. Wish I had more time for that. Let's see. So sometimes I read math, sometimes I read about experimental music and sort of the latest stuff that's coming out.
01:02:58.730 - 01:03:01.500, Speaker A: Any recommendations on experimental music?
01:03:01.870 - 01:03:07.206, Speaker B: Yeah, let me think for a second. These are all records.
01:03:07.238 - 01:03:08.618, Speaker A: Are those records behind.
01:03:08.784 - 01:03:09.498, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:03:09.664 - 01:03:12.338, Speaker A: So I assume they were books.
01:03:12.454 - 01:03:29.060, Speaker B: I should just pull some out. Let's see. I've been really into Alessandro Cortini lately. He kind of does these kind of dark sort of synth pieces that are really nice. That's been one.
01:03:29.670 - 01:03:30.660, Speaker C: What else?
01:03:34.630 - 01:03:38.980, Speaker B: Been listening to some of my old fall records, like from the 80s. That's been really fun.
01:03:39.910 - 01:03:40.660, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:03:41.830 - 01:03:47.010, Speaker B: So the reading list is short these days. I have a two year old, so the reading list is pretty short these days.
01:03:47.080 - 01:03:47.314, Speaker C: So.
01:03:47.352 - 01:03:49.898, Speaker B: Sorry I don't have more recommendations to. To give you.
01:03:50.064 - 01:03:53.750, Speaker A: That's all. Good. I'll check out Alessandro Cortini. Apparently he's part of nine inch nails.
01:03:53.830 - 01:03:58.458, Speaker B: A long time ago. Yeah, he's responsible for some of that dirty synth sound they had nice.
01:03:58.544 - 01:04:01.622, Speaker A: Nice. I like it. Well, Tim, it's always a pleasure.
01:04:01.766 - 01:04:02.230, Speaker C: Yep.
01:04:02.310 - 01:04:04.010, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, seed. Thanks, everybody.
01:04:04.080 - 01:04:06.006, Speaker A: Take care. Thanks, everybody. Bye.
