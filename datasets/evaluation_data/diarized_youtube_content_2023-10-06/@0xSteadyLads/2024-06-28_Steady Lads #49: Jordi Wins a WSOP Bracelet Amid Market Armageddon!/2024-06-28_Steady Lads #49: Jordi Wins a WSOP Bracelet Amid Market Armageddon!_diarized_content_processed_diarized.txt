00:00:17.640 - 00:01:06.580, Speaker A: What's up, everyone? Welcome to episode 49 of Steady Lads. Thicky woke up roughly five minutes ago, so hopefully he'll join us in the next five or ten minutes, but let's cue the intro, and let's get the show going. Oh, thank you, sir. All right, what's up, everyone? Welcome to episode 49. So, first things first. Congratulations to Jordy. He finally finished his bracelet grind in the WSOP.
00:01:06.580 - 00:01:14.740, Speaker A: I think he joined a $10,000 entry Raz tournament. Finished first for a little over a quarter of a million dollars.
00:01:15.480 - 00:01:23.720, Speaker B: I think it was the fact that we did a live kind of, you know, warm up as we were starting the last day. I think that made the difference.
00:01:24.020 - 00:01:25.500, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
00:01:25.580 - 00:01:28.372, Speaker C: Wait, do you have the bracelet on? Can. Can we see it?
00:01:28.556 - 00:01:31.280, Speaker B: You know, I just wear it, you know, casually.
00:01:32.180 - 00:01:33.132, Speaker C: There it is.
00:01:33.236 - 00:01:34.880, Speaker B: Run around wearing it.
00:01:35.660 - 00:01:37.560, Speaker A: Yo, that's crazy.
00:01:38.180 - 00:01:39.280, Speaker D: Solid gold.
00:01:40.540 - 00:01:53.840, Speaker B: I mean, there's some gold, for sure. I don't know. I don't know how much, but I don't think I'm gonna be, you know, wearing it in my. In my day to day life. But occasionally I'll maybe snap it on.
00:01:54.820 - 00:02:02.580, Speaker A: Like, how many final tables have you made? And, like, before you actually, like, won this one? Like, how many, like, tears have you shed?
00:02:02.700 - 00:02:37.120, Speaker B: I think I had either eight or nine, like, top ten finishes, and I think closest was, like, a third place where, like, I had, like, half the chips this time. Thankfully, once it was down of. So once it was, that was down to five people. There was one other really good player, that Brandon Shaq Harris. He got pretty unlucky. Not against me, against other people. He, like, lost his ships to other people.
00:02:37.120 - 00:02:59.082, Speaker B: And then down the last four, it just went really smooth. It was smooth sailing. Thankfully, no ups and downs. It was just a straight line. Yeah, kind of surreal. I have a lot to say about it, but maybe next week we can do a meet the lads. Jordy and I can kind of give some of my thoughts.
00:02:59.082 - 00:03:30.530, Speaker B: I'm still recovering and processing. I had to fly back to Europe as soon as we finished, so, yeah, it's sunk in in some ways, but needless to say, thrilled and also just amazed at the amount of support that came out on my, you know, my Twitter post went viral on it, and I got so many messages and, yeah, I couldn't believe, like, how many. How many people were supportive out there. So thanks to all the other lads listeners as well.
00:03:30.920 - 00:04:13.058, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you know, like, you're, like, way more successful than me, but, you know, like, I'm super proud of you because I mean I, I know this from a poker background. It's like you would grind hours and hours and days and weeks and you would make the right plays but sometimes you're on bad and there's nothing you can do about it. And I think you've been on this 15 year journey and to continue persevering I think that's, you know, something that's inspirational, at least to me, maybe for others as well. So, you know, just the continuous self belief I think is very important especially when it comes to poker and crypto because both are pretty lonely sports, right. It's me versus everyone else. It's like player versus environment or PvP. So yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean.
00:04:13.154 - 00:05:17.030, Speaker B: The 15 year journey is kind of part of what makes it meaningful. I think if it happened earlier it wouldn't be as meaningful. It's not like I've been going every year in the last 15 years. There was like two periods. There was the professional period where, you know, as you guys were doing for a while, you know, that that was what I was doing for like you know, three years or so around 2010 and then once I quit I wasn't playing much poker for, for some years and then when I eventually started going back around like 16 1718, um, at that point I was doing it more, you know, not, not to like make a living but more um, competitively. I don't want to say recreationally because I do take it quite seriously. Um, so it was more of a, I don't need to make a living but I'm here, I'm here to get, get it done and obviously, you know, there's less pressure because you're, you're not trying to make rent.
00:05:17.030 - 00:05:52.826, Speaker B: It's like a different situation but you have different challenges. One is like you're not fresh, like literally I did not play poker for a year. Between World Series last year and World Series this year I don't think I played barely any hands of poker. So you have to kind of overcome some of the lack of freshness and then I'll do some content around this and I might do a Twitter spaces. But the key thing is just trying to be like high performance dialed in, be like thinky, basically just roll out of bed and just like go like.
00:05:52.858 - 00:06:09.636, Speaker A: Three times in the past. Wait, before we transition to the markets, can you just. Justin, can you pull up the George Alexander article? Yeah, I mean, I mean I didn't know this but I thought they just messed up your name. Apparently Jordi and George, the same, same thing. Majority sounds cooler.
00:06:09.668 - 00:06:18.320, Speaker B: So you need to be more worldly. You gotta, you gotta travel to Barcelona, meet all the Geordis there, travel around Taiki.
00:06:19.100 - 00:06:19.500, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:19.540 - 00:06:31.440, Speaker C: But in all seriousness, I linked this article for, in the comments section and it's actually a pretty good read. It breaks down everything that happened and your, your tweet in there that went viral is in there, so it's good for folks to read. It's pretty interesting, actually.
00:06:32.180 - 00:06:55.920, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so quickly transitioning the topic. So I have this suzu mug right here. Right. Crypto is not just the fastest horse, it is the only horse in the race. Justin, can you pull up the charts? How's crypto doing relative to tradfi? Seems like. Yeah, so this is pumping, but Jesus.
00:06:56.260 - 00:07:09.920, Speaker C: You can see the S and P 500 are the candles and the line is BTC USD. And you can see really for the past couple of weeks now, the S and P has been doing pretty well and bitcoin has not followed, unfortunately.
00:07:11.140 - 00:07:34.160, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, thikki, I'm in your telegram and you just keep yapping around how things deserve to go down. And the ivory tower is crumbling. What's your take on the current market? Crypto stratify, I guess. Dispersion, interest. Where'd he go? Fuck this dispersion in performance.
00:07:35.300 - 00:08:13.560, Speaker B: I think he's, I mean, I can jump in. In the meantime, it looks like we've been in a range for four months since end of February. We've been bouncing between 60 and 70, and unfortunately now we're at the lower end of that. Meanwhile, stocks have been doing really well despite no rate cuts. So we started off amazing, a lot of inflows, but we've found sellers. There's a lot of sellers, and there's new and new sellers every day. It seems like there's a new country.
00:08:16.780 - 00:08:18.580, Speaker A: Vicky Yurvak, do you want to chime in on this?
00:08:18.660 - 00:08:44.652, Speaker D: Yeah, sorry about that. I just trying to kick me out of the room right now. But, um, yeah, there's definitely a lot of supply events in the past two weeks that were kind of unexpected. Like we, we failed to break up higher after like a billion dollar inflow day. And like, a lot of people just kind of got scared, you know, why there was so much supply up there. There was like a Bitfinex seller and it's a lot of like, limit offers there on binance. And we just were unlucky of getting, you know, german supply of like 3 billion.
00:08:44.652 - 00:09:03.900, Speaker D: It's starting to get sold every single day. We got the Gox Fud coming in earlier than the market expected. And ETF's outflowing another around billion dollars. So, yeah, three sources of things that just sort of hammered the markets and created this dispersion between s and P and bitcoin.
00:09:05.480 - 00:10:01.994, Speaker A: And I guess if bitcoin is not doing well, like this $200 million worth of altcoin supply unlocking every single day, it's going to just keep putting a top or, you know, putting a bunch of supply in the markets. Even, you know, blast, which TGE'd yesterday, which I kind of expected this thing to launch at least three to 4 billion. But I mean, Justin, if you can pull up, I guess, like my screen, this thing has been pretty much down, only it's, I mean, I don't know. Like, I like, on one hand, it's like, I'm nothing that surprised, but on the other hand, I'm also like layer zero. Sort of like, watch. Layer zero is also like at 250, right? Like, is this actually like a time where it makes sense to buy things off the public markets because these things are launching so low? Or do you still think that, like, these things are untouchable because they are, you know, VC Kol bags?
00:10:02.162 - 00:10:28.330, Speaker D: I'm surprised at how poorly these things are doing. But, like, yeah, I guess there's is no bid for altcoins right now. And that just gets felt the hardest in these new launches like Zksync, Lazero and that blast have just been like, very, very disappointing. I do think that, like, if the market turns from the ETTF, like, these are some of the things that are going to rip the hardest. So I think it does have that going for it. But, yeah, if, if there isn't a bit from the ETF, these things also fall the hardest.
00:10:29.350 - 00:10:53.788, Speaker C: Yeah. Can we actually talk about. I think it's worthwhile to talk about EtH BTC and Sol eth eth BTC is interesting because it's actually seems like it's doing decently well here for the past couple of weeks. And, you know, maybe for me at least, that's bringing some confidence into the flows that we should expect for the ETH ETF. Maybe the market's getting a little more excited here. To your point, thiky though, it could be all the government bitcoin that's, that's up for sale.
00:10:53.924 - 00:10:57.440, Speaker B: I think it's just the selling. It's just the idiosyncratic selling.
00:10:57.940 - 00:11:35.374, Speaker C: I also think it's worth looking at sole ETH because, you know, we got the news actually right when we were going live, 21 shares, I believe added into the sole ETF filing news. So now there's two ETF issuers that have filed for the sole ETF. And so that's pretty interesting there. If that's something that helps Sol recover from this, the meme coin narrative sort of becoming more stale and whatnot. I do think the sole ETF is actually more likely than we're led to believe. If you guys recall, for the ETH ETF, a lot of the smaller issuers filed before Blackrock. I think fidelity actually might have been the first, and then Blackrock filed a week or so later.
00:11:35.374 - 00:11:38.294, Speaker C: So it's definitely something to watch there. And could, you know, revive interest rate.
00:11:38.302 - 00:11:39.610, Speaker B: Is there a poly market?
00:11:41.350 - 00:11:49.086, Speaker C: It's a good question. Let me see if I can pull that up. There must be right. There's a poly market for everything. Yeah, here we go.
00:11:49.198 - 00:11:55.582, Speaker B: It's bullish. One of the first thoughts on our mind is like, let's see what the aggregate opinion is.
00:11:55.766 - 00:11:56.358, Speaker A: 12%.
00:11:56.414 - 00:12:06.690, Speaker C: Yeah. So it looks like it's not that liquid. There's only 250k bet, so nothing possibly not that reliable. But it looks like to buy the yes outcome. You can. You can buy yes for fifteen cents.
00:12:09.150 - 00:12:22.370, Speaker A: Fifteen. It seems pretty fairly priced. I lowkey thought that the doge ETF might be more likely than sold, but I think there's going to be more appetite for, like, Solana over Doge, at least in like, boomerland.
00:12:23.750 - 00:12:26.278, Speaker B: I think both of them are like zero for this.
00:12:26.334 - 00:12:30.570, Speaker A: You think there's zero for this year? Yeah, like we're talking about next year.
00:12:31.510 - 00:13:18.460, Speaker B: Yeah, next year. Maybe. There's a lot more to overcome than, you know, having some small applications. Obviously there's difference between having CME futures as an easily, like, reliable, dependable, non exploitable, governed reference price versus not having it. And CME does all this, like, investigations whenever there's anyone watch trading or doing anything on any coin. And I don't think that we have a liquid enough Solana market yet for being able to overcome that. And as I recall, that was the thing that was holding back the eth one for a while.
00:13:20.450 - 00:13:28.110, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you have any thoughts on this? Sticky. From like a trading perspective, do you think it's you just like, fade the pop or do you think there's like something here?
00:13:32.770 - 00:13:47.510, Speaker D: It's hard to say because it didn't really move that much. Moved maybe like 6% when it first got filed. But I agree with Jordan that, like, it shouldn't really change, like, you know, fundamental, like the local supply and demand and so on that much just given how far away it has to get approved.
00:13:48.450 - 00:13:50.058, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fair.
00:13:50.194 - 00:14:01.710, Speaker C: And what about your thoughts on the Eth eTF? I saw some comments last week that you wouldn't really commit one way or another to like what you were thinking for the ETF or have you solidified your thoughts? Are you still going to keep it close to your chest or.
00:14:04.890 - 00:14:29.648, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm still not sure yet. Obviously, like, EPTC was just a great trade. You know, given we were getting so close to the ETTF. And then I, you know, bitcoin, government selling it was just, you know, if you wanted to express just like, a relative value trade, that was a great one because now it's near. Near the highs again. It's like, near, like, what? 0.056. But yeah, in terms of the launch, I still don't really have any opinions on how it's going to trade.
00:14:29.648 - 00:14:32.460, Speaker D: I'm just going to plan on reacting to it as I see it.
00:14:33.760 - 00:14:39.588, Speaker C: Yeah. So you'll be studying flows like, you know, checking those platforms that report flows at the close and whatnot?
00:14:39.784 - 00:14:42.280, Speaker D: Yeah, we'll be running back the bitcoin playbook.
00:14:42.660 - 00:14:43.440, Speaker C: Nice.
00:14:44.580 - 00:15:11.036, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel like in this current market meta, it's like every airdrop launches lower than expected, which kind of lowers the expectations for the next airdrop. So airdrop farming feels less exciting. And then meme coins are also like, the average meme coin is kind of dying. So even that side of the market is also kind of boring. So I guess, like, now we just run back, like, the whole ETF trade and, like, that's going to be the narrative for the next month or two.
00:15:11.188 - 00:15:20.228, Speaker C: You know, speaking of interrupts, tyke, I saw you tweeted that you got a couple hundred thousand blasts, maybe a little bit more. What did you decide to do? That just sort of the wait and.
00:15:20.244 - 00:16:12.230, Speaker A: See approach or like, honestly, I thought about just holding onto it, but I'm like, you know what? Like, would I rather hold on to blast that, like, sub three bill FTV or would I rather just sell it to Ethan and Airdrop farm with it? So I dumped all mine at, like, point or like, 273 that was like, I just, like, sold all my bags. And right now there's, like, using third party bridges. Um, there's so much demand to bridge out of blast that all these third party bridges kind of, like, halted, I guess, their services on blast. So the only option is to use the main bridge to get the fuck out. So, like, now I started the process to, you know, get out of blast. 14 days. Kind of annoying, but you know, it's with all these things, I have this mindset of, like, just farm them, dump them to accumulate more eth, move on.
00:16:12.230 - 00:16:33.676, Speaker A: That's kind of how I view these things. I am pretty optimistic, blasto. I mean, like, it seems like they have some native builders and I guess, like the mobile app aspect or like that privy thing. But also maybe the demand to build on blast was for the incentives, like gold and points. But now that, like, the season two is like, kind of. Kind of lame. Like, it takes like a year for like 10% of supply.
00:16:33.676 - 00:16:34.908, Speaker A: Like, I don't really think people have.
00:16:34.924 - 00:16:38.920, Speaker B: The patience to farm the claiming process. You got to, like, watch.
00:16:40.420 - 00:16:57.508, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Pac man is a pretty good looking guy. That's. That was like my first take. But dude, there's like, this. Let me try to find this image. But I know there are people that, like, civil, like, the blast airdrop. And, like, some people that I know, like, they, they had like 14 tabs open.
00:16:57.508 - 00:17:13.052, Speaker A: Like 14 windows open, like, playing the blast video at the same time. And they said that they have nightmares of, like, pac man's voice of like, this is the first native chain with yield, like, whatever, right? I mean, I think it's a good, you know, I think it's pretty good.
00:17:13.076 - 00:17:40.420, Speaker C: These guys are brilliant at like the carrot and the stick, right? Like, to claim your tokens, you have to download the PWA, the progressive web app, right. And so, like, getting people, they always get people further and further into their network and system, like, with each task. So, like, I wouldn't fade them. They're really good at sort of designing these incentive schemes. I did pull up the DeFi llama when you were talking about TVL Tyky, and it is interesting. So TVL peaked at like 2.6 billion, is now down to 1.49,
00:17:40.420 - 00:17:59.840, Speaker C: according to Defi llama. A lot of that is probably price moving down, but still pretty interesting to see. And I was going to ask you, as far as bridging, is this one of those opportunities where you can sort of like play the other side of the bridge and then buy, you know, like discounted ETH or discounted stables by providing, providing liquidity to the bridge? Or did you know, not cause price movement there?
00:18:00.300 - 00:18:43.000, Speaker A: Yeah, you can. Because I think to bridge stables at a blast, I think for $10,000, you take like a 1% cut. So I'm sure that, you know, with stables, you can buy deep or not deep, like under pegged USDB, like the blast stable coin. There's also season two of Etherfi is going to wrap up in two days, and I think after that, there's going to be some cell pressure for that ether by you. So I'm sure you can, like, buy that, too. So, you know, I also think that, you know, airdrop farming, the expected returns maybe, like, a couple months ago, maybe, like, you can get 100% APY, but now maybe it's, like, lowering, like, 30% APY. I mean, these are numbers I'm pulling out of my ass, right? But, like, just general mumbo jumbo math, like napkin math.
00:18:43.000 - 00:19:14.110, Speaker A: So you can make an argument that, like, maybe it's not even worth airdrop farming these, like, lrts or, like, even, like, these l two s. Because if blast is worth, like, 2 billion, then what is Korok gonna be worth? You know, like, 1 billion? You know? Like, it's. I know it's, it's kind of like the euthanasia roller coaster, but with, like, airdrop ftvs, it's like, if blast low, if blast launches at two, then the next one's gonna launch like, 1.5. And then, you know, it's. Yeah, it's, I don't know, maybe the vc game is over. That'd be pretty good, I think, for everyone, but, yeah, that's kind of my take.
00:19:15.990 - 00:19:31.350, Speaker C: Personally. I think that's a strong overreaction. I think, like, we're going to always see these, the same types of things happen. I think we're just in a little bit of a lull in the market. I fully expect, like, if eth starts performing well with inflows, like, I fully expect blast to sort of be a higher beta version of that, at least initially.
00:19:31.430 - 00:19:38.010, Speaker B: But we'll see everyone, like, Barrett chain will save us. So there's some hope.
00:19:40.590 - 00:20:17.100, Speaker A: Yeah, there's always gonna be hope if they never launch, right? Like, that's always, like the, that's the meta. I mean, I know a lot of people working for bear chain and I guess investors as well. I mean, proof of liquidity hopefully works, but, like, at this point, like, I don't know, like, what the fuck is. What are, like, any of these things? That's kind of, like all the topics I had, I guess, like blast. I guess we just discuss the Solana ATF. Should we just do, like, audience Q and A, or do you have any other topics you guys want to talk about? Jody? Thank you, Justin.
00:20:18.560 - 00:20:41.082, Speaker B: There's a lot we can talk about. Obviously, there was. The debate just happened. I think I'm probably going to buy more crypto now that it looks like we will likely to get a crypto president. I was surprised that the odds before the debate were so close to 50 50. I thought, you know, Trump was still going to be a favorite. I didn't realize that it was so close.
00:20:41.082 - 00:20:47.030, Speaker B: Now it does seem like, you know, he's, he's two to one almost. But.
00:20:49.250 - 00:21:09.780, Speaker C: I can highlight some of those odds here. It's, it's pretty interesting. 42% chance Biden drops out of the race. It's hard for me to see that happening, even though I think he should. And then as far as presidential election winner, 64% chance for Trump, 21% for Biden, which is staggering. And then I, of course, you have the other possible democratic replacements there. Do you guys think a hot swap is possible?
00:21:10.920 - 00:21:31.300, Speaker B: I think it's, it's more likely than not. So I'm surprised it's under 50%. I would 43. I would put it at like 70 now, maybe 75. I can't see how he continues. I think it's, it's pretty much a formality that he's going to get replaced. They just don't know who to replace him with.
00:21:31.300 - 00:21:36.310, Speaker B: And just the process, from what I understand, is quite tricky.
00:21:36.650 - 00:21:46.590, Speaker D: It's kind of crazy. It's never happened before, right. When incumbent has to, like, drop out halfway through the race, give to someone else, because he's like, he can't, he's incoherent.
00:21:48.450 - 00:22:12.782, Speaker C: I don't know if it's happened, certainly not in recent memory, but it is pretty sad. Right. It just goes to show, like, the primary process is all facade, right. And, like, the party can just nominate whoever they choose regardless of who people vote for. And so I feel like, you know, it sort of reveals the man behind the curtain here, which is, you know, not ideal for our system. But of course, he, Biden is clearly senile and obviously, he's not fit mentally to be president. As much of a nice guy as he is.
00:22:12.782 - 00:22:14.878, Speaker C: It just doesn't make any sense.
00:22:15.054 - 00:22:17.702, Speaker D: Well, Biden doesn't have to step down. He has to agree to it.
00:22:17.726 - 00:22:18.290, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:20.150 - 00:22:42.090, Speaker C: I think he would have to agree to it unless, you know, the Democrats really did a coup. Right, and then picked a different candidate, but then they would lose. Right. Because Biden would be pulling some votes away from the Democrats running as an, you know, independent, but the incumbent. And then the Democrats would have to prop someone up without his endorsement, and it would just split the ballot for them and split the vote. So I think he's, he's sort of required inherently.
00:22:42.990 - 00:23:10.100, Speaker B: Can you bring up the Bowdoin chart? I've been talking about this. I remember, like, some weeks ago, I was saying that some of these coins, you know, they have an inevitable death coming. And with bowdoin, it was always going to be once he's no longer gonna, like, keeping the president. Why would. Why would somebody hold it like he's. He's gonna be in less headlines and, man, this thing is down. Maybe zoom out, like, like, three months or something.
00:23:10.100 - 00:24:08.718, Speaker B: And now even more, like, ultimately, if you know that in four months there's not going to be any more Biden headlines of any sort, then these attention coins are obviously going to go down. And theoretically, the Trump one should go up. I think there's a little bit of confusion around what is the real Trump coin. First we had Trump and then Trump, and then MAGa, and then maybe you guys touched on DJT. I was on the spaces with Shkareli when he was trying to defend his version of events, which, you know, is true. Like, as I was saying, on the spaces, I mean, it's pretty obvious to anyone close to the situation that Baron somehow did launch his Solana shitcoin.
00:24:08.854 - 00:24:32.010, Speaker C: Um, you know what's crazy to think, like, if he's really in the trenches, like, launching pump fun style shitcoins, like, there's a chance he's a steady lads listener. And if you are, we'd love to have you on the show. Like, we have 10,000 viewers. You know, there's probably only, you know, 50,000 shitcoin slingers. This is. You know, how many people are motivated to make one? This is, like, a good chance, 20% chance. He's a viewer.
00:24:32.750 - 00:24:40.180, Speaker B: I think his. His voice has never been heard publicly, so I'm not sure if we'll get first crack at it.
00:24:40.800 - 00:24:44.740, Speaker C: We're here, though, and we're. We're really great co hosts. We'd love to have you.
00:24:45.280 - 00:24:46.140, Speaker B: All right.
00:24:47.280 - 00:24:50.940, Speaker C: After Charles Hodgkinson, we'll get Trump.
00:24:53.200 - 00:24:57.008, Speaker A: Still waiting for Charles. He's probably, like, too busy doing, like.
00:24:57.064 - 00:25:04.580, Speaker C: Ice bats right now and still waiting for GCR. I saw a couple people commenting, asking if we could get GCR. I know, Jordy, you're working on it, right?
00:25:05.970 - 00:25:25.590, Speaker B: Um, I haven't asked him lately. He. He always entertains the idea, but sort of backs off. I don't think he wants to be the main character in general, so he might. He might stay a little bit away from that spotlight, but we'll see if we can try to do it at some point.
00:25:26.050 - 00:25:30.690, Speaker A: Yes. So the audience can only have poker GCR, which is Jordy Heredez?
00:25:31.380 - 00:25:43.764, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I tried to claim game theory GCR as a general title, but lately I've been getting poker GCR, which is not the worst, I guess.
00:25:43.892 - 00:25:47.520, Speaker C: Yeah, I saw we had some commenters saying you're sleepy. GCR?
00:25:52.300 - 00:25:52.612, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:52.636 - 00:25:56.250, Speaker D: No, falsehood.
00:25:56.700 - 00:25:59.400, Speaker A: How are you waking up at noon? Like, what were you doing last night?
00:26:01.180 - 00:26:01.692, Speaker D: You know, it's.
00:26:01.716 - 00:26:04.644, Speaker A: Watching the bait, watching the day.
00:26:04.732 - 00:26:05.440, Speaker B: Okay.
00:26:05.860 - 00:26:09.844, Speaker D: I've had a rough week this week. That's all I'll say. But back to. Back to the grind.
00:26:09.892 - 00:26:13.000, Speaker C: Like, a rough week is in not much sleep. Or you mean a rough trading week.
00:26:13.540 - 00:26:21.560, Speaker D: Oh. Been good for training, but just, like, haven't been managing to sleep well. I've been chilling in New York, having too much fun.
00:26:24.560 - 00:26:31.460, Speaker A: Nice. We should all hang out, actually, major. Yeah.
00:26:33.480 - 00:26:44.896, Speaker B: Yeah, I I will have to see you guys in. In Singapore for. For the live. Our live event in a couple months anyway, so.
00:26:45.048 - 00:26:46.100, Speaker D: Deflection.
00:26:52.160 - 00:26:54.256, Speaker A: He's like, see you in Singapore. Fly out of here.
00:26:54.288 - 00:26:55.900, Speaker C: Catch you in a few months, kid.
00:26:57.080 - 00:27:15.620, Speaker B: No, I mean, I was. I was gonna have some time in New York, but I decided to extend my Vegas trip as long as possible to. To play as many events as I could. I ended up playing, I think, eight events, and the last one was the one that. That finally did it. And then I had, like, one off day at the end, and I. I took my.
00:27:15.620 - 00:27:40.526, Speaker B: Took the winnings of. And, you know, as. As a. As a proper djen. Uh, did my other bucket list item. I I went straight to the Bellagio, big, uh, Bobby's room game, the 3000 6000 game, and I just put it all on the table. Played against Mercier and Patrick Antonius, some of those guys.
00:27:40.678 - 00:27:41.494, Speaker A: Damn.
00:27:41.662 - 00:27:45.230, Speaker B: Um, and got lucky and crushed them. I don't know.
00:27:45.350 - 00:27:46.492, Speaker A: Oh, sickness.
00:27:46.506 - 00:28:12.940, Speaker B: I won, like, several buy in, so. Running good. And hopefully, crypto bags are looking better as well. But I'm ready to get back to the crypto grind. I think it was rejuvenating to have a little experience. And then my Vegas trip in general, was very successful. Met a lot of people, a bunch of celebrities I'm not gonna get too much into.
00:28:13.280 - 00:28:14.220, Speaker C: Okay.
00:28:15.800 - 00:28:20.060, Speaker B: There are some interesting moments. I'll see what I. What I can share, but.
00:28:21.720 - 00:28:24.520, Speaker A: Sounds like more celebrity meme coins about to launch.
00:28:24.600 - 00:28:31.260, Speaker C: I saw a comment here, Jordy. I'm trying to pull it up, but did you bring any more poker people into the crypto space?
00:28:37.600 - 00:28:49.040, Speaker B: It feels like more like celebrity people then. Then poker. I think poker people are already in. Most of them have been holding some crypto for a long time.
00:28:49.700 - 00:28:52.080, Speaker C: To fish says which celebs did you onboard?
00:28:54.340 - 00:28:56.164, Speaker B: Yeah, there's some. There's some. And.
00:28:56.212 - 00:28:57.348, Speaker C: Really? Okay.
00:28:57.524 - 00:29:09.138, Speaker B: Yeah. And then recently been also talking to a lot of middle east kind of whale people as well. Trying to, trying to hit. We're trying to get from all angles. We gotta.
00:29:09.274 - 00:29:16.470, Speaker A: There you go. There you go. You gotta. Onboard. Onboard the exit liquidity. Just kidding.
00:29:17.130 - 00:29:22.350, Speaker B: They're still early. They're gonna still be early, I think. Yeah, exit is coming a lot late.
00:29:24.330 - 00:29:32.150, Speaker A: All right, let's. Let's get some questions going. Chat. Please don't show random meme coins.
00:29:34.880 - 00:29:36.860, Speaker C: Tyche, are you farming arbitrum?
00:29:38.960 - 00:30:15.206, Speaker A: Definitely not. I am on arbitrum. I was farming Etherfi season two, but that's going to end in two days, so I have no idea what's going to happen after that. I'm farming scroll right now pretty heavily. I've been on there for over a month because after blast, after ZK saying after layer zero, all the farming capital is going to want to find a new farm elsewhere, you know, Ziggy sync TVL blast. TvL probably gonna top, but, you know, it's, it's being diluted. Tvl unscroll, like, over two x'ed in like a week.
00:30:15.206 - 00:30:39.300, Speaker A: So there goes, like, my farming edge there. I know arbitrum has those, the long term incentives program, like the pilot program going on, but, you know, you can get like 20, 30% on stables, which, like, fine, I guess. But I'm. I don't know. I'd rather farm airdrops because at least there's a hope that it's going to be worth something, even though it might not end up panning out. Yeah. The use case of hope.
00:30:39.300 - 00:30:53.360, Speaker A: Sorry. The use case of crypto right now is like, you know, just the hope, right? Just to hope that farming airdrops will be worth something. Buying meme coins. Hopefully it'll pump. That's kind of where we are. I kind of have this here, actually. I want to show this image because I thought that was pretty funny.
00:30:53.360 - 00:31:34.130, Speaker A: Let me pull this up. This kind of summarizes, like, my views on the markets right now. It's how it feels to be a djen in the current meta. And it's kind of like, if you zoom in here, you know, but, like, this guy's been working around, like, some form of a torture method where it's like, the sandpaper floor that keeps, like, moving around and, like, the guy can't sleep because otherwise you get, you, like, get chafed so you can never sleep. It kind of feels like this, right? It's like there's the sole etf headline that pops still, and then today it's going down. It's like meme coins pump one day up 30%, and then it's down 20% the next day. It's really, really hard to play right now.
00:31:34.130 - 00:31:51.700, Speaker A: So I think it's better to just try to stay alive. It's hard to beat. I think the risk is just the returns of farming with either right now or just holding bitcoin and doing farming things that way, or even Solana with the majors. Um, that's kind of like my views right now.
00:31:52.080 - 00:32:15.288, Speaker C: I have a fun question from Tommy here. Uh, Tommy asks any plan for a one year anniversary, and we're three weeks away. I don't think we've missed a single episode. We've had a couple sleepy ones here. We've had a couple people drop off here and there. But I think we've always put out an episode for almost a year now. Um, so what are we thinking for three weeks from now? Are we thinking a live stream, maybe some beers, celebration, taking calls from the audience? I don't know.
00:32:15.288 - 00:32:16.540, Speaker C: Any ideas, guys?
00:32:18.050 - 00:32:25.270, Speaker B: Let's try to see if we can get a one of the goat special guests. Let's see if we can do something on that side.
00:32:26.610 - 00:32:29.202, Speaker A: Define goat, because I don't think GCR is coming on.
00:32:29.226 - 00:32:30.642, Speaker C: So, Kobe.
00:32:30.826 - 00:32:47.790, Speaker B: I'll give it another shot. I'll ask him one more time. I think we'll see. He managed to save the $100 million by not taking that bet. That Baron was involved in the coin. Maybe he's in a good mood and they'll consider it. Chat says Kobe.
00:32:47.790 - 00:32:57.102, Speaker B: Maybe. You know, he's been avoiding doing a podcast lately. I haven't seen him on. On much, but we'll.
00:32:57.206 - 00:32:58.250, Speaker C: Yeah, he's building.
00:32:59.430 - 00:33:08.510, Speaker B: Yeah, he's building. He would qualify. And then I think Hoskinson, he blanked me on.
00:33:08.550 - 00:33:09.730, Speaker C: That's my top choice.
00:33:10.130 - 00:33:16.830, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll send them another WhatsApp and see. I know. We'll try to see if we can get something, something epic like that.
00:33:17.490 - 00:33:26.346, Speaker A: Yeah, I was just thinking, like, maybe you can do, like, a live. Like, we just take shots or something. I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe sip on some.
00:33:26.378 - 00:33:30.910, Speaker C: You're still young, tyke. We're old on this side. We're on the wrong side of 30 over here.
00:33:31.810 - 00:33:34.310, Speaker B: Are you, like 30.1, Justin?
00:33:34.610 - 00:33:35.914, Speaker C: 30.5.
00:33:36.082 - 00:33:46.850, Speaker B: Okay. Okay. Yeah, we got a Richard heart. Yeah, maybe a Richard heart. Maybe if he's. Has he shown his face? Man, this guy is he's still on the run. Not sure what the.
00:33:46.850 - 00:33:48.390, Speaker B: What the latest. Richard heart.
00:33:48.730 - 00:33:50.482, Speaker A: He'll just call you a todd bod.
00:33:50.666 - 00:33:58.394, Speaker B: Bod. Yeah, I think since then he. He's like retired. Sec just sued consensus.
00:33:58.442 - 00:34:00.946, Speaker C: Justin, I think that's old news, right?
00:34:01.058 - 00:34:01.706, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:01.858 - 00:34:04.670, Speaker A: That they won or they. They kind of pulled out, right?
00:34:05.870 - 00:34:06.294, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:06.342 - 00:34:07.090, Speaker A: Let's see.
00:34:08.070 - 00:34:17.450, Speaker C: I do see a new alert coming through, like Infinity hedge and DB, that as you see Sue's consensus. But it's really hard to give your reactions to these things live, right?
00:34:18.150 - 00:34:30.918, Speaker A: Yeah. The market's knowing all the facts. The market's nuking right now or not really nuking. It's like down like a percent. So maybe it is. There's some truth to it. East down to BTC 1.5.
00:34:30.918 - 00:34:31.850, Speaker A: Sold five.
00:34:35.070 - 00:34:37.610, Speaker C: Yeah, I see that here on the ETH chart.
00:34:39.950 - 00:34:46.526, Speaker A: Which is, you know, you know, like the up only curse where every time they do a live stream, like, the market goes down. It's like the study lats curse.
00:34:46.718 - 00:34:55.730, Speaker C: Yeah, I see podcast. Another alert. Another alert from Infinity hedge. SeC alleges Lido and rocket pools taking programs are securities.
00:34:56.230 - 00:34:57.770, Speaker A: Can you pull up the chart?
00:34:58.500 - 00:35:02.320, Speaker C: Yeah, I suppose that was expected because they were going after Coinbase for staking.
00:35:04.980 - 00:35:09.972, Speaker A: Light. It was actually pretty strong recently. And then I guess it's gonna just go down.
00:35:10.156 - 00:35:10.676, Speaker B: That's not.
00:35:10.708 - 00:35:11.644, Speaker A: Oh, look at that.
00:35:11.772 - 00:35:15.440, Speaker C: Oh, it's funny to watch it live, you know?
00:35:16.140 - 00:35:24.150, Speaker A: Yeah, the 1 minute. Oh, okay. That's how you know there's some shears to it. Yeah. There you go. Man.
00:35:24.270 - 00:35:32.370, Speaker B: We. We just gotta get rid of this dude. I think I saw everyone. Jesus. What?
00:35:32.670 - 00:35:34.206, Speaker A: Oh, no, I'm just looking at the chart.
00:35:34.318 - 00:35:43.810, Speaker B: It's really not. It's really not an interesting chart. It's just. There's nothing been happening. So there's no. There's no activity before today. It's just been flat.
00:35:43.810 - 00:35:45.730, Speaker B: It looks worse than it is.
00:35:46.030 - 00:35:46.810, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:48.520 - 00:36:01.616, Speaker B: Yeah. It feels like we need. We need change. Change in Washington. And everyone's been donating a million dollars in crypto to Trump. It looks like. I see the Winklevoss and Jesse no cracking guy.
00:36:01.648 - 00:36:02.168, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:02.304 - 00:36:25.382, Speaker B: Yeah. So we gotta wait. People are talking about Canoff stepped down and from my understanding, Kanav has been stepping down for a year. He's just been serving non compete or like whatever garden. Garden leave. So I don't think it's news or something changed there.
00:36:25.526 - 00:36:38.510, Speaker A: There's like a fun pasta. It was like the day Kunal posted that he was stepping down. I think Lido was up like 6%. It's like yes. Like, he's. He's no longer gonna dump lido, but I guess there's always a lido seller. It's like I.
00:36:38.510 - 00:36:53.060, Speaker A: Sometimes I track, like, brune, like, ruin Christensen, like, the founder of maker, his wallet. And, like, he just keeps finding Lido from nowhere. Like, he just keeps selling lido, like, buys a maker. I was like, how are people finding these lido bags? But I guess, you know, the sell pressure is infinite.
00:36:53.220 - 00:36:54.800, Speaker C: They always have more coins.
00:36:56.420 - 00:37:00.120, Speaker A: The sellers never run out of coins. Study that, you know.
00:37:01.260 - 00:37:11.920, Speaker C: Good question from Ng as we see more news pour in. But any special e field opportunities on mantle right now? I feel like we haven't heard much from you about mantle and puff and whatnot. What. What's been happening behind the scenes.
00:37:12.280 - 00:37:33.728, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, it's. It's all about how you end. It's not about how you start. And we're getting towards the end. So, you know, there's something cooking. The governance token cook is gonna start being farmed and probably released in three months when hopefully, you know, think things are in good, good place overall. But I think the.
00:37:33.728 - 00:38:04.330, Speaker B: The math yields are still quite high. There's a lot of options on how to get yield, but I think by default, you're still kind of starting to farm cook. And then with Puff. Yeah, we didn't. Pasta of the week, the video that we put out with GCR and his massive schlong. I asked GCR what he thought about it, and he gave a very strong approval. So he liked being represented in approved in this biggest big way.
00:38:04.330 - 00:38:40.180, Speaker B: But, yeah, there's something cool coming soon for Puff. We've been. The team showed me the NFT collection that's coming. They've been doing puff nfts and, you know, it's a 8888 collection of different puff nfts. So that'll be quite soon. And, yeah, of course, you know, kind of getting into the governance token part, so that'll be fun. The coin itself has been doing well compared to the market, especially.
00:38:40.180 - 00:38:44.900, Speaker B: So it seems like people are kind of excited for the end game.
00:38:46.480 - 00:38:48.260, Speaker A: Lido's down 10% now.
00:38:48.840 - 00:38:53.100, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to pull up puff here. It's been a good month for puff enjoyers, that's for sure.
00:38:53.760 - 00:38:55.580, Speaker B: Yeah. Pretty healthy.
00:38:56.200 - 00:38:57.008, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:57.184 - 00:39:00.620, Speaker B: Especially compared to the rest of the alternative.
00:39:02.400 - 00:39:03.180, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:04.800 - 00:39:11.856, Speaker B: Everyone's talking about the SEC thing in the chat. Suing consensus. Yeah, I thought, like, that was already. Is this a new thing?
00:39:11.928 - 00:39:44.020, Speaker C: It's like, remember consensus? The SEC was investigating Ethereum via consensus and then consensus sued the SEC and then it seems like the SEC is countersuing consensus for something. But if you guys recall, consensus, like, filed a lawsuit against the SEC, I think, just a couple weeks ago. Right. And I seen another chat. I seen another chat. So. And Gary Gibson watched the debate and realized, like, he had to get everything he needed to get in, get done, done in the next few months before he's gone.
00:39:45.610 - 00:39:53.682, Speaker A: Yeah. And I guess this is a good pasta. It's like, even if the SEC loses, Joe Lubin is going to have to sell a mountain of eth to cover his legal fees.
00:39:53.746 - 00:39:56.110, Speaker C: Oh, come on. That's B's.
00:39:57.090 - 00:39:59.498, Speaker A: No, it's just a sisyphus suite.
00:39:59.674 - 00:40:04.210, Speaker C: No, I know. I mean, maybe there's some truth to it, but we don't have to worry about that right now.
00:40:04.330 - 00:40:25.830, Speaker B: Are you able to, like, delay, um. Like, if you're getting sued right now, you probably don't want to settle. You just try to delay it as long as possible and then wait. Wait for, like, a change in their leadership and see if they just drop it later. I don't know. That seems to be the game theory. Optimal outcome.
00:40:26.570 - 00:40:40.510, Speaker A: GTO. Yeah. And speaking of this version, we talked about stocks. Stocks are flat today, and then crypto is starting to sell off. I guess the market just wanted a reason to sell off. This is, like, a good reason to. Yes.
00:40:40.510 - 00:40:47.550, Speaker A: Things are looking heavy out there. No wonder. Thick. He's gone. He's probably shorting some bullshit, some alts.
00:40:51.250 - 00:41:13.040, Speaker C: It's funny how pessimistic we've become when prices are still so elevated relative to where they have been. Right? We're still in a really good spot. We're still in a $2 trillion industry. If you just look at the coins, not even including the equity in this space, like, crypto has become so huge now. It's, you know, probably, like, all things considered, it could be, like, a three or $4 trillion industry.
00:41:13.340 - 00:41:32.794, Speaker A: Yeah. It's just that the alts are down bad. That's why, like, the majors are doing fine. And just thinking, can you share my screen? Like, I saw this tweet that was, like, pretty interesting. Where? So this is, like, may of 2021. Like, I'm not sure if you remember that crash, but, like, it was insane, right? Like, I woke up and I was like. I was like, what? I was kind of, like, stuck in bed.
00:41:32.794 - 00:42:03.516, Speaker A: I was like, what the fuck just happened? And everything just, like, went down 50%. But even then, things like. Link $21, uni 17, curve 160, doge $0.23. Like, outside of bitcoin, BNB indeed, we're still lower now than we were post horrible crash. And I guess that kind of just shows you how, know the market is kind of showing its hand. It's like, yeah, like the ult bid is disappearing and it's not really the Ultbed.
00:42:03.548 - 00:42:42.972, Speaker B: There's just a lot more options now and. Yeah, like there was not enough quality coins really. And now there's, there's just like ten to choose from. Like if you, if you want to choose an l two, if you want to choose staking token, if you want to choose something else. So it's not so bad. And honestly, if we think about how quickly some of these new tokens go from not existing, like blast didn't exist and then a year later it's 2 billion, which is more than blur ever was. So it's all about expectations.
00:42:42.972 - 00:42:52.530, Speaker B: And I think some of the expectations got too high when market was frothy, but these things are not totally unreasonable.
00:42:53.390 - 00:43:10.690, Speaker C: Jordy, do you think some of these launches are, are they dilutive to the space? Like when blast launches, does it, is it just eventually sucking market cap from like the general space in l two specifically or like how much value do you think is actually being created here or versus just being extracted from other tokens?
00:43:11.390 - 00:43:13.890, Speaker B: It's probably like 80% dilutive.
00:43:15.380 - 00:43:16.320, Speaker C: Interesting.
00:43:17.500 - 00:43:53.994, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, there's too many l two s. The cost to launch an ul two is so low that like I had this tweet, let me just pull this up and like, I mean, I was like never bullish mode, but I never really imagined that, you know, it would be like a 25 million market cap, you know, 200 million FTV. I mean, maybe this is even, it's like not fairly priced. Like maybe it needs to go lower. But I, you know, like if you told me that mode would launch or like mode would be like $200 million market cap like six months ago, like, I probably would not have believed you, you know, but I guess it makes sense in hindsight.
00:43:54.042 - 00:44:02.950, Speaker B: There's, I mean, the response there by the founder under your tweet, just saying like, you know, we just screw you talking.
00:44:05.290 - 00:44:29.648, Speaker A: No, I like James. He's, yeah, let me, let me just share it back. Yeah, he's like, yeah, like even I. He said even we didn't really expect this, but we're going to just keep shipping like nothing against James here. I was just expressing my surprise of like, wow, like, literally no one is buying these tokens and I guess the tokens are invested, so it's hard to buy tokens with like investing Nifi nine.
00:44:29.784 - 00:44:54.790, Speaker C: Says something similar to what Jordy said, like, calling. Everyone was calling. I think some people on this podcast even said, and maybe even myself do you called Eigen layer like a flop because of a ten to 20 billion ftb? But, like, that's absurd. Like, if you think about it, right? Like, it's still, like, quite a high valuation. For what? For the level of product market fit they've achieved. So I do think Jordy has a point. They were like, our expectations have sort of ran wild in this space, and we just expect absurd valuations.
00:44:56.890 - 00:45:18.486, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. There was just, like, so much stuff that was clearly unsustainable that was going on right when everybody got rich off of the. The. The pump off the lows on majors. And it'll happen again, I think once ethereum kind of cracks five k, we'll start seeing some stupid things.
00:45:18.558 - 00:45:23.730, Speaker A: But soon, soon my eat bags beg for it.
00:45:26.030 - 00:45:27.810, Speaker C: Should we do pasta now?
00:45:28.350 - 00:45:28.942, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:29.046 - 00:45:33.250, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it. Woohoo.
00:45:36.040 - 00:45:37.072, Speaker C: We need some energy.
00:45:37.176 - 00:45:38.408, Speaker A: We need some energy.
00:45:38.464 - 00:45:38.912, Speaker C: Come on.
00:45:38.976 - 00:45:44.888, Speaker A: Come on, chat, come on, please, chat. Chat. Please give us. Give us energy. Come on, let's go. Come on. What are.
00:45:44.888 - 00:45:47.080, Speaker A: What are you guys excited about? What are you guys excited about?
00:45:47.240 - 00:45:52.440, Speaker B: Thank you. How many. How many coffees? Yeah, how many coffees do you have?
00:45:52.480 - 00:45:54.740, Speaker C: You see, you got the Biden cocktail?
00:45:55.640 - 00:46:00.882, Speaker A: No, dude, I got the suzu. I got the Suzu coffee. Crypto is the only horse in the race, baby.
00:46:00.946 - 00:46:02.870, Speaker B: I've never seen Tyche like this before.
00:46:04.930 - 00:46:18.710, Speaker A: I killed it. Caffeine. I'm jacked. I'm jacked to the tits. All right, all right. Pasta. Let's go.
00:46:19.730 - 00:46:25.030, Speaker C: This might be my. This might be my pasta deficiency. Jordy needs some meth from IRL. Meth.
00:46:25.510 - 00:46:28.210, Speaker B: Hey, you got a hawk to before getting on?
00:46:28.710 - 00:46:30.170, Speaker A: I got a huck too.
00:46:33.470 - 00:46:36.770, Speaker C: Oh, man, I. Don't worry. Chris says you're awesome.
00:46:37.110 - 00:46:47.902, Speaker A: Thanks, Chris. Thank you. We love caffeinated taki. I've been sick all week. So you haven't had caffeine. And I just, like, drink some cold brew. I made some cold brew.
00:46:47.902 - 00:46:50.342, Speaker A: That's. Maybe that's why, but.
00:46:50.486 - 00:46:50.854, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:50.902 - 00:46:51.062, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:51.086 - 00:46:56.894, Speaker B: Well, your sensitivity increased, and then you took some shots.
00:46:56.982 - 00:46:57.878, Speaker A: I love you.
00:46:57.894 - 00:46:58.970, Speaker C: Took a team break.
00:47:00.870 - 00:47:04.410, Speaker B: Cool. All right, well, let's. Let's pasta. So who's going first?
00:47:06.110 - 00:47:09.690, Speaker A: I can go first. Let's go. All right, Justin, pull it up.
00:47:10.950 - 00:47:14.878, Speaker C: Your pasta is, like, too high iQ, though. It's not funny, dude.
00:47:15.054 - 00:47:50.740, Speaker A: Okay, so there's, like, this hedge fund. I think they got some free tokens, and, like, I don't even know what this thing is called, but, like. Or it's like water token. But, you know. He says the large water community could have mistakenly bought the token at an FDB of over a billion before presale investors received their tokens, potentially facing a mighty 90 90% loss afterwards. To protect the community, we lowered the price to a fair level, and they literally screenshotted, like, the desk screener of them just selling their tokens. And then they have, like, what, ten buys, and now they're calling themselves heroes.
00:47:50.740 - 00:48:13.964, Speaker A: Wait, wait, can you click on the next. What. What even is the water? What even is that? Like, this has to be like a scam, right? Yeah, like, oh, yeah, like, this. This for sure has to be a scam. Anyway, anyways, I just thought I was hilarious. It's like, hey, like, to protect the community, we sold our bags so that people can get in at a lower price.
00:48:14.132 - 00:48:25.084, Speaker C: The excuses people make for selling get me the hardest. Like, mistakes were made with an account I control that has to be my all time favorite. But this is close. This is up there. This is a good pasta tyke. Yeah, I misjudged you.
00:48:25.212 - 00:48:34.044, Speaker A: I should have read. You should have read it. Yeah, dude. Like, it's kind of like, you know, like, would. Do you agree to, you know, sell your tokens respectfully?
00:48:34.172 - 00:48:34.840, Speaker B: Right?
00:48:35.140 - 00:48:50.680, Speaker A: Like this. Had this, whatever market maker was very not. Not respectful at all. Do you do anything like this? You know, like, Jordy, like, to sell tokens so that retail can get in at a lower level? Is that anything that people do, or is this guy, like, a scam hedge fund?
00:48:51.860 - 00:48:58.280, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a funny, like, excuse for. For it, but I don't know.
00:49:02.940 - 00:49:08.250, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I guess water. I can't believe it's called water, but I guess everyone likes water, right? So.
00:49:10.070 - 00:49:13.170, Speaker C: The chat asking Jordy about political theory made his day.
00:49:16.070 - 00:49:18.730, Speaker A: Anyways. All right, that's my pasta. Who's next?
00:49:19.550 - 00:49:43.192, Speaker C: I got it. I'll go next. So we've been seeing a lot of these where would you sit? Posts. And I thought this one was really funny because Thickie actually makes an appearance. He's to the right of number five, right? That's his e girl emoji, I believe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I was thinking, I'm normally an aisle seat guy, but thicky probably is not going to show up if I go number five.
00:49:43.192 - 00:50:01.486, Speaker C: Like, I'll get the window and I'll get number five, and I'll have a lot of space to stretch my arms out. So I thought this was hilarious, but actually, I think three is, like, the canonically best seat. You're behind Andrew King. You're, like, diagonally around Arthur Hayes. I can tap him on the shoulder and try to talk to him. I don't know what's on the left there. Maybe the chat can help us out.
00:50:01.486 - 00:50:07.406, Speaker C: This cat thing on the bottom left, Jordy, do you know what that is? I know Tyche doesn't.
00:50:07.558 - 00:50:08.490, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:50:09.430 - 00:50:17.610, Speaker C: Just some. Yeah. But I like this one because we had our, you know, friendly, steady lads co host on there, so that was a fun one for me.
00:50:18.030 - 00:50:25.630, Speaker A: Wait, who's at the top, right? The guy in. The. Guy on the jet ski. Is that Rick? Oh, okay. I definitely don't want to sit.
00:50:25.710 - 00:50:26.650, Speaker C: I'm not sure.
00:50:27.950 - 00:50:38.254, Speaker A: It's like. It'll be like Kat talking about Uniswax and then Rick Burton claiming he founded Uniswap. So definitely don't want to sit next to that. Number eight's interesting.
00:50:38.342 - 00:50:40.462, Speaker B: Number eight. It has to be number eight. You got it?
00:50:40.486 - 00:50:40.910, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:41.030 - 00:50:42.894, Speaker C: Who's to the left of eight, though?
00:50:43.022 - 00:50:59.898, Speaker A: It's like the korean DJ. It's like. He's like a live streamer. He, like, just leverages long, or he's just like, leverage trades crypto and, like, just gets hyped around it. Eight's great because then you can talk to GCR. You look to the left and you can see a DJ getting liquidated. And then, you know, you have to.
00:50:59.914 - 00:51:02.794, Speaker C: Sit in the middle. I mean, a middle seat's a tough one.
00:51:02.962 - 00:51:10.018, Speaker A: Well, you know, you can manage. Oh, it's an eight hour flight, huh? That's pretty. That's pretty rough.
00:51:10.194 - 00:51:10.950, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:11.770 - 00:51:12.630, Speaker B: All right.
00:51:13.970 - 00:51:18.042, Speaker C: Satos. Korean GCR. That's the person I didn't know who was. Okay.
00:51:18.106 - 00:51:18.330, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:18.370 - 00:51:20.530, Speaker A: Sato. Yeah. Is it legend.
00:51:22.230 - 00:51:35.150, Speaker B: Cool. My aposta is back to Gord. He. He was a guest, but he just keeps pumping him out every week. So we need a use case GCR.
00:51:35.190 - 00:51:38.250, Speaker A: Eastwood.
00:51:38.550 - 00:51:46.540, Speaker B: I saw, like, all the lists of, like, all the different dozens of GCR's, but what we really need is a. Is a use case GCR.
00:51:47.600 - 00:51:48.500, Speaker C: Someday.
00:51:49.480 - 00:52:00.020, Speaker A: Someday. Let me. Let me put. Let me put up that there's a GCR encyclopedia. That's pretty funny.
00:52:03.040 - 00:52:06.300, Speaker B: Meanwhile, we'll get the poll up.
00:52:07.680 - 00:52:09.620, Speaker C: Oh, I forgot. We got live poll.
00:52:10.120 - 00:52:16.248, Speaker A: Yeah. You got all these gcRs. I don't think. Answers.
00:52:16.384 - 00:52:17.740, Speaker C: Arthur Hayes, though.
00:52:18.720 - 00:52:26.780, Speaker A: What? No, that's. That's. That's a. That's KSI, dude. You're uncultured, Justin.
00:52:27.400 - 00:52:28.340, Speaker C: Oh, wow.
00:52:28.840 - 00:52:32.260, Speaker A: He's like the. He's like a comedian slash boxer.
00:52:35.080 - 00:52:41.918, Speaker C: I feel like Arthur Hayes would have, would be a better fit there, though. It's so small, I couldn't see. But I feel like Arthur Hayes is like much better fit.
00:52:42.094 - 00:52:58.890, Speaker A: Yeah, actually here, actually, I was going to submit a bonus pasta just because I'm caffeinated as hell. But I'll wait for the, I'll wait for the polls.
00:52:59.790 - 00:53:03.330, Speaker C: Make this fair. There is a poll live. I'm going to try to pull it up right now.
00:53:04.020 - 00:53:09.480, Speaker A: Okay, let's see. I'm trying to pull up this.
00:53:11.380 - 00:53:13.640, Speaker C: Here we go. We got 40 votes already.
00:53:14.340 - 00:53:17.932, Speaker B: Justin, self vote on the poll. Did you self vote again, justin?
00:53:18.076 - 00:53:18.920, Speaker A: I'm voting.
00:53:21.220 - 00:53:26.760, Speaker C: I never have self voted. I've always voted for someone else, but I've often won. People like me.
00:53:28.930 - 00:53:35.670, Speaker B: Is justin's mom always voting for him or does she like, give it, give a little bit out.
00:53:37.170 - 00:53:38.470, Speaker A: I couldn't find it.
00:53:39.210 - 00:53:41.530, Speaker C: I had it for a second. I'll pull it up.
00:53:41.650 - 00:53:43.810, Speaker A: I had like 60% to tyche.
00:53:43.970 - 00:53:45.578, Speaker C: There we go. I got it now.
00:53:45.634 - 00:53:54.778, Speaker A: Got 50 votes now. Let's see here. I'll vote for jody so I can spread it out. Get him at 58.
00:53:54.834 - 00:53:55.018, Speaker D: Okay.
00:53:55.034 - 00:53:55.830, Speaker A: There you go.
00:53:57.500 - 00:54:04.076, Speaker C: There you go. I think tyke is the clear winner. We see a couple votes for jordy coming in.
00:54:04.268 - 00:54:09.796, Speaker B: Let's see. Don't close it yet. Oh, eric, keep it up.
00:54:09.908 - 00:54:22.480, Speaker C: Wait, wait. I wanted for just the meme is in this chat. Eric charles, huge shout out to you. That's awesome. We've got eric charles watching and barron trump. That's like a pretty big win for me.
00:54:27.440 - 00:54:29.100, Speaker A: How can I vote for thickie.
00:54:31.800 - 00:54:32.112, Speaker C: Thick?
00:54:32.136 - 00:54:37.220, Speaker A: He's a pasta by himself, dude. He's just, we're lucky if we can get him on.
00:54:40.200 - 00:54:49.340, Speaker B: Yeah, getting, getting a little bit closer, but not close enough. All right, well, Taiki, I think you have the unrespectful.
00:54:49.380 - 00:54:52.260, Speaker C: Close the poll and crown tyche officially.
00:54:52.420 - 00:54:58.260, Speaker A: Yes. The mid curve wins. It happens sometimes. Yeah, Brad, give me the thing. Give me the thing.
00:54:58.420 - 00:54:58.788, Speaker B: Yes.
00:54:58.844 - 00:55:07.196, Speaker C: Crown them. All right, we need a guest next week. This is getting, this is getting.
00:55:07.228 - 00:55:12.280, Speaker A: All right, here's a bonus pasta. Here's a bonus fast. I saw this this morning. I thought it was hilarious.
00:55:12.620 - 00:55:17.020, Speaker C: But you gotta like and subscribe first. Everyone subscribe.
00:55:17.140 - 00:55:19.128, Speaker A: And then you see the bonus pasta.
00:55:19.324 - 00:55:20.660, Speaker C: All right, here it goes.
00:55:24.280 - 00:55:37.220, Speaker A: Nostra Finance CEO steps down eleven days after token Airdrop with no vesting periods. This is so bad.
00:55:38.600 - 00:55:48.436, Speaker C: So I got another alert from watcher guru that the SEC sues consensus alleging metamask is an unregistered securities broker, which is an interesting little twist to the lawsuit.
00:55:48.628 - 00:55:51.348, Speaker A: Oh, because of, like, the swaps and the staking, I guess.
00:55:51.484 - 00:55:52.640, Speaker C: Probably. Yeah.
00:55:54.940 - 00:56:00.452, Speaker A: There'S. There's infinite reasons to soak in. Infinite reasons to sue. Consensus, I guess.
00:56:00.516 - 00:56:03.760, Speaker C: Yeah. Shall we wrap up?
00:56:05.860 - 00:56:06.692, Speaker B: Sounds good.
00:56:06.756 - 00:56:12.210, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll wrap it up. I'm high energy now.
00:56:12.340 - 00:56:16.330, Speaker B: We'll try to keep Tyke's caffeine intake lower next week. Guys.
00:56:16.630 - 00:56:22.810, Speaker C: Jordan, Jordy and I really need to, like, do the same. You'll have to send us what. What your cold brew brand of choice is.
00:56:24.230 - 00:56:27.590, Speaker A: It's the Suzu mug. It's. That's the suzu mug.
00:56:27.630 - 00:56:28.318, Speaker C: Does it?
00:56:28.454 - 00:56:38.570, Speaker A: Suzu mug with the cold brew, with caffeine. That's all it takes. Just inject the bull hopium into my veins as Glido is down 12%.
00:56:40.390 - 00:56:51.010, Speaker B: You have light. Are you holding Lido still? Who still has this coin here? Who has it and why? Like, why do you have it?
00:56:51.470 - 00:57:04.406, Speaker A: It's traders, dude. Like, I went to, like, a meetup event and then like, this fund manager was showing me Lido. He was like, dude, like, if not now ever, I guess. No, it's not now.
