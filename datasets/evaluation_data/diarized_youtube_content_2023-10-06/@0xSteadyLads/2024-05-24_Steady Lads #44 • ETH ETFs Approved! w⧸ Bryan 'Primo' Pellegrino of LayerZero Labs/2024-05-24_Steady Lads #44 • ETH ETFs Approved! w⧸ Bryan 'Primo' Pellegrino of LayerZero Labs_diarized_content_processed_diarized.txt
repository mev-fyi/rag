00:00:04.600 - 00:00:24.034, Speaker A: All right, we are live. So this one's going to be a banger, guys. One, we have Primo, which is exciting. And two, we have a lot of.
00:00:26.684 - 00:00:31.316, Speaker B: I'm sorry, Primo. Today's really my day, you know? We're so happy to have you.
00:00:31.340 - 00:00:33.624, Speaker C: But I'm pumped, man. I'm glad.
00:00:35.324 - 00:00:36.744, Speaker B: I've got nothing to say.
00:00:37.684 - 00:00:39.532, Speaker A: All right, well, let's just get into it.
00:00:39.548 - 00:00:40.116, Speaker D: Let's. Let's.
00:00:40.180 - 00:01:24.534, Speaker A: Let's kick the intro. We'll jump in. What's up, everybody? The ETF has been approved. I think a lot of us stayed up waiting after hours much longer than we expected. But good news and a lot to dive into, of course. Let me just kick it off to you, Justin, for a quick victory lap, and then we'll get to our guests and everything else going on.
00:01:24.674 - 00:01:36.910, Speaker B: Oh, boy. What. What a week. You know, all the doubters, you guys are all losers. You know, Thiki. So I have a funny story. I prepaid thickie, Tyche and I are in New York.
00:01:36.910 - 00:01:48.134, Speaker B: Tykee had a meet up for his community. Me and Thiki went, we had a great time. Thiki commented on my watch. He said, this thing looks great. I said, it's yours. You want it? Thiki said, I can't accept this gift. That's too generous.
00:01:48.134 - 00:02:03.174, Speaker B: I said, you know what? You're gonna win this ETF bet. Just take it as the payout for the bet. It was like an inexpensive watch, about 3500. He took the watch, I prepaid the bet, and now we have this whole settlement issue. So, thicky, you owe me an Ethan and maybe a nice gift at some point.
00:02:03.334 - 00:02:03.814, Speaker A: I do.
00:02:03.854 - 00:02:05.914, Speaker D: Justin, you're not wrong in that.
00:02:06.814 - 00:02:08.278, Speaker B: But we're all winners, right?
00:02:08.366 - 00:02:14.806, Speaker A: How about a pudgy penguin gift? I recently got one and I thought it was very thankful. Maybe like a pudgy, pudgy gift.
00:02:14.950 - 00:02:16.274, Speaker B: I'll take a pudgy.
00:02:16.614 - 00:02:19.994, Speaker D: What's the floor? Is it like twelve eth? I think.
00:02:22.344 - 00:02:23.312, Speaker C: I'm sure he would like.
00:02:23.368 - 00:02:38.776, Speaker B: Well, for all the humiliation I suffered for the last three months of the chat. Just saying how dumb I was, how I was fading, Solana. And now the sentiment has shifted overnight. I'm getting DM's. Justin, you're the smartest guy. We knew you were going to be right all along. All along.
00:02:38.776 - 00:03:00.364, Speaker B: The comments here I'm seeing are all like, Justin is right. Justin is the smartest lad. But for like, six months, I had to hear that Tyche wasn't actually the left curver. It was actually me. That thickie was the God tier trader that Jordy new markets and was mister game theorizing. But really it was me the whole time. Just let's let that sink in and let's not forget that part, buddy.
00:03:01.104 - 00:03:13.404, Speaker D: He deserves it. He deserves it. After the beating, there's a live chat. His name is Sticky thought and his, he's just said, now I'm ultra liquid. That's hilarious.
00:03:14.144 - 00:03:24.374, Speaker A: Anyways, all right, well, now that that's out the way. Yes, please like and subscribe. Welcome, Brian. Good to have you here.
00:03:24.914 - 00:03:27.850, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. Should be a fun one.
00:03:28.042 - 00:03:43.616, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I know you're, you're supposed to be very neutral across all the chains. You know, you're connecting everybody and creating that layer, but yeah. What's your kind of reaction to the news? Do you think this is a big deal or how are you seeing it?
00:03:43.720 - 00:04:10.604, Speaker C: No, for sure it's a big deal. I mean, I think bitcoin bit like, from my perspective, bitcoin was, I don't know if I want to say inevitable. It definitely wasn't inevitable, but I feel like, like bitcoin is definitely going to happen if anything is going to happen. Right. But just because it happened, I don't think it meant that anything else was guaranteed. And I think eth just opens the door for basically everything else. It feels not like total capitulation, but definitely like a really good step for the industry.
00:04:10.604 - 00:04:21.274, Speaker C: And I think it's just like a huge net positive. So I don't know if it's going to be this massive run up like post bitcoin ETF or what inflows will look like or anything like that, but it's like clearly a huge win.
00:04:22.294 - 00:05:04.664, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think Trump jumping on the crypto bandwagon has scared people in Washington a little bit and they want to be a bit more neutral on the topic and I'll lose all the single issue voters. So. Great, great for the industry and all of us who are, you know, invested in it and participating in it. Thikki. I mean, let's look at the trading side a little bit. Obviously there was a little bit of a gap up on the actual announcement, but we're falling off a little bit. Do you think this is just profit taking from people that were writing it from 3000, 203,100 or is this kind of sell the news?
00:05:06.424 - 00:05:14.684, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's a little bit of both. I'm actually, like trying to think about it right now because I have this position, one that's going against me.
00:05:16.384 - 00:05:20.016, Speaker A: I'm not sure liquidate thinking one thing.
00:05:20.040 - 00:05:37.614, Speaker B: I think that's interesting, though, is the same exact playbook that we ran for the bitcoin. ETF is running back perfectly. Initially, people didn't believe it then they believed it and it was initially priced in. And then, if you guys recall, the ETF was approved. And if I recall, nothing really happened. Right. Like Price didn't really move too much.
00:05:37.614 - 00:06:04.094, Speaker B: And then I think the ETF actually launched. Trading started, and inflows for the first couple of weeks were pretty disappointing. And I think bitcoin went back down to, was it like forty eight k, forty five k, something in that range? And then we saw this massive set of inflows come in. So I think it's very possible we just run back the same playbook. I think the first few weeks of launch are going to be a little disappointing. I think the grayscale Ether trust is going to get unwound a bit. Of course, people are trying to get out of that.
00:06:04.094 - 00:06:09.358, Speaker B: And then I think it's going to take some time for the inflows to pick up and I think we're going to see the same trade run back again.
00:06:09.446 - 00:06:44.514, Speaker D: So, yeah, I guess to play Devil's advocate, I mean, ETH has also been going up with bitcoin. So I don't think you can expect the same price action because, you know, ether was being dragged up by bitcoin even though HBTC was going down. And I guess Baltun is, and all those ETF analysts, they lean more bitcoin, Maxis, and they're definitely biased. But they've been saying, yeah, like, EtHF is not going to get that many inflows. But, you know, it would be interesting to see, like how Larry Fink shills the Ether ETF. Maybe he's going to show, like, real world assets. Like we're going to dismiss these things on chain.
00:06:44.514 - 00:07:02.954, Speaker D: Maybe the ESG mandates, you know, like ether is more environment friendly. Maybe that becomes a narrative, like, for me, like I'm just like taking my ETH, bridging it to tokenless l two s, hoping for air drops. So that's kind of like I'm just like forced diamond hands in all my youth right now.
00:07:03.414 - 00:07:26.674, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, a lot of that's true. Bottom line is, one, it'll take longer for the trading to start. They're telling us, you know, maybe a month, which was a lot longer than bitcoin, which started right after. So that's a good or bad thing, depending how you look at it. It gives, gives the market some time to digest the grayscale selling. I think it just depends on if some of the estates need to sell. I think the GBTC was a lot more forced selling.
00:07:26.674 - 00:07:59.514, Speaker A: Some of the bankruptcies had to just get out of it. It might not be as bad. And then ultimately we have to see what inflows look like. The 1020 percent of BTC flows would still make a huge difference on ETH given the relative size and the relative like liquidity. Because of course, most of the ETH is, you know, staked and restaked and all these things. So just a couple billion of inflows can, can do wonders, I think.
00:08:00.814 - 00:08:15.204, Speaker D: Yeah. Joy, I think a few months ago you said etc to 0.08. If the ETF gets approved, is that still your, your target now? It's at. .0 what is it? 0.0536. Justin's euphoric here, but.
00:08:17.744 - 00:08:23.364, Speaker A: Justin's euphoric. Someone in the comments says, hush, our eth God is speaking. No comment when Justin speaks.
00:08:23.744 - 00:08:29.240, Speaker B: I prefer, I prefer Justin is the white GCR and also Justin is the spectacle.
00:08:29.272 - 00:08:31.004, Speaker C: GCR is a good one.
00:08:33.064 - 00:08:34.364, Speaker B: I'm very astute.
00:08:36.624 - 00:08:59.860, Speaker A: Yeah. I think 0.08 is, is pretty realistic end of year and I think the six to 8000 target that I had is still very realistic. Things take a while now to digest. There's always people that want to take the fast profit. The easy money got made on the, you know, by the, by the news. It was, it was a pretty safe bet when it was like around 3200 to suddenly just buy and hold.
00:08:59.860 - 00:09:28.994, Speaker A: Once things that get digested, we'll have to see. Also being quite interesting. Um, it seems like meme coins are showing strength and some of the major l one s and everything else like Solana is not doing well, except I was saying appreciate Algorand. Algorand is doing well today. It's up a lot and I don't know, did you guys see this ad? Maybe we can find the ad, Justin, but I was seeing mixed reactions between.
00:09:29.294 - 00:09:35.634, Speaker C: I saw a lot of hate for the Algorand, dad. I haven't actually watched it, but I saw a lot of hate online for it.
00:09:36.194 - 00:09:41.410, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe let's bring up a few seconds. Maybe don't want the whole thing, but maybe the ending. Have you seen this, tiki?
00:09:41.602 - 00:09:46.454, Speaker D: No, but I. Here, let me link it in the chat, Justin, maybe you can pull it up.
00:09:47.354 - 00:10:12.594, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, Algorand has been kind of dead for a while in terms of at least like retail usage and adoption. I don't know about the government side of what they're doing. So they had this ad. People, like, trying to buy groceries, paying, and one guy's trying to. This is the Solana dude. We can maybe, like, put the volume and watch the Solana dude. That's the big thing.
00:10:12.894 - 00:10:17.198, Speaker C: Looks like it's going to be another 27 minutes before this transaction clears. What?
00:10:17.366 - 00:10:17.854, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:10:17.934 - 00:10:19.198, Speaker D: $112.
00:10:19.246 - 00:10:21.414, Speaker A: I have, like, three things. Ethereum.
00:10:21.494 - 00:10:23.234, Speaker C: They got that peak hour gas thing.
00:10:23.774 - 00:10:24.794, Speaker A: There you go.
00:10:25.254 - 00:10:46.884, Speaker C: Maybe one more time. What are you gonna do? Just wait right here. Without the bag? Without the bag. I think it's gonna work. Nope. Should have shot with algorithm.
00:10:47.704 - 00:10:51.164, Speaker D: Oh, Scaramucci. Oh, my God.
00:10:51.584 - 00:10:52.344, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:52.504 - 00:10:54.484, Speaker D: He must be bag holding. Geez.
00:10:54.804 - 00:11:19.816, Speaker A: Yeah, he is back holding. That's kind of public. He invested last cycle. So I think this ad rubbed people the wrong way, because, first of all, it's throwing shade at the actual 95% of the crypto market cap, which is the big three, let's say. And secondly, Algorand's not even competing with them. No one sees it in the same lane or category. So why are you.
00:11:19.816 - 00:11:39.684, Speaker A: I think XRP at some time had done something similar, trying to talk bad about bitcoin's environmental impact and stuff like that. Seems a bit too PvP from a game theory standpoint and not worth it. But it's up today, 4% when everything else is down, so maybe it's working. What's your take, Brian?
00:11:41.504 - 00:11:59.478, Speaker C: The market's always been PvP. I mean, go back to the Mac versus PC commercials back in the nineties or whatever when we were kids. Those are the most adversarial and aggressive commercials that you could ever get. Where PC was just, like, this retarded business guy, you know, whatever. It's just, like, totally unusable.
00:11:59.646 - 00:12:05.102, Speaker A: That's like Coke and PEPC. That's like, you know, Jordan and magic. But this is Algorand against, like, yeah.
00:12:05.118 - 00:12:26.064, Speaker C: But Apple at the time, like, I. I don't think it was there yet. I think we look back on it and say, like, you know, yeah, of course. But I think Microsoft was just, like, completely dominating them at the time. And so I think it's always been PvP. I think, like, I don't know. I think it's actually a little bit funny to, like, poke, you know, I don't think anybody's going to take it, too.
00:12:26.064 - 00:12:32.204, Speaker C: Like, nobody walks away and is like, you know what? Like, ethereum sucks. Algorand is the future. But, like, I think it's.
00:12:32.584 - 00:12:45.560, Speaker B: Brian, I have a promise to make to you in an offer. If you guys are ever looking to do a commercial, I will fly there at any time, no notice required, and I'll say anything. I just want to be part of it.
00:12:45.752 - 00:12:47.524, Speaker C: Solved. Absolutely.
00:12:48.174 - 00:12:50.874, Speaker D: So, Prima, are you saying that Algorand is the next Apple?
00:12:51.374 - 00:12:55.862, Speaker C: You know what? You know what? Maybe not a bag holder. No.
00:12:55.958 - 00:12:56.214, Speaker A: No.
00:12:56.254 - 00:12:57.034, Speaker C: Incentives.
00:12:57.974 - 00:13:34.828, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, let's, let's see, let's see how things play out. My understanding was that Algorand had kind of exited the, you know, retail app side and was moving into more, I don't know, CBC or like whatever other kind of stuff. And it was more, okay. When Solana was poking fun at Ethereum, there was that ad where the guy's like, they're throwing like layers on him, like L2, layer 56, and they're just like throwing. That was pretty funny because at least they're, you know, they're going after the same category of users in any case. Yeah, I mean, markets PvP. Let's talk a little bit about what you guys have been doing, which is trying to avoid some of the PvP.
00:13:34.828 - 00:13:48.380, Speaker A: And for those of you who don't know, I mean, Primo was, was kind of like a legendary online tournament poker player. I remember on the, on the old pocket fives rankings and everything like that, were you like number one or like, what was like the.
00:13:48.532 - 00:14:05.994, Speaker C: For heads up, I played mostly just heads up, right. So I played heads up cash, like up to 501K, mostly shallow, and then heads up sit and goes up to the highest stakes. You play for heads up sit and goes. I was number one for a little bit, but it was like probably three to four people were really sort of in the mix there.
00:14:06.164 - 00:14:11.874, Speaker A: And you were quite early, I remember, to computerized solving of poker.
00:14:12.214 - 00:15:01.972, Speaker C: We built like, we published this paper, supremacy. We published with Facebook AI research, but basically like Carnegie Mellon, which was Noam Brown's research was like high computation, solving of poker right on the back of like chess and some of this other stuff. And then Ualberta was basically all reinforcement learning of just like self training, simulating, creating your own samples and doing this. And basically after the deep stack paper came out, we were just like, we think we can do this better. My two co founders and I spent about a year doing it, and we were like 5000 x more performant than the state of the art benchmark in both of them. So published that paper, and I think in heads up, there hasn't been a paper yet that's eclipsed it, but most people moved on to solving six Mac after that. But, yeah, definitely.
00:15:02.148 - 00:15:14.684, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, that was phenomenal. When you were playing heads up sitting goes and tykes, a fellow ex poker pro as well. Were you using the charts and like this stuff or were you just playing based on like intuition? Like what were you using?
00:15:14.764 - 00:16:11.506, Speaker C: Yeah, so I mean, even, even back into, like even back in the early days, right. So I played started when I was 15 and a half, which is like 2002 2003 era, and was really full time, like heavily full time, probably 2005, 2006. Like from that period onward, for the next seven or eight years, I basically was either playing or studying 70 hours a week. So early on studying was just like you'd run your hands through a hand, like you'd mark hands in your poker tracker or whatever, hold a manager, and then you would pull them out and then you would like run math and do manual calcs on all of this. And then it came to where you could run like basic sims. And then now you look at anybody, like even jungle man or like any of the best players in the world spend like a huge portion of their time studying sims. When we did, when Doug Polk played Daniel Negrano in this like multi million dollar heads up challenge, we ran all the sims for him with our stuff.
00:16:11.506 - 00:16:54.484, Speaker C: And so we would come back after playing for a day and he would be like, okay, like here are the bet sizes that he did and we'd run a bunch of different reactions and then he would go through and basically you have to try to internalize kind of how, how you randomize in each spot, what ranges look like, how you split, how, you know, what, what bet sizes are effective versus not effective. And so like everybody really uses that stuff to study a ton. So it's a lot like on and off the table stuff. Yeah, I mean, I would back shallow, you would have like a chart, you'd have the Nash equilibrium chart and you just be like, oh, it's like seven big blinds. Like I should just, if I'm playing only push or fold, I'm going to shove this now. It's really like really complex trees and so it's a lot of off the table work.
00:16:55.624 - 00:17:48.184, Speaker A: Yeah. And I was talking to one of the big crypto investors today and he was telling me how in 20 1718 era the quality of the funds and the founders was kind of meh compared to other sectors of tech and stuff. And I would say that's changed quite a lot. Now, I don't know how you feel about it, but it feels like the prime talent is either a trader, all the traders are crypto traders, because that's the biggest edge the founders are there. Obviously the more institutional investors are coming in. You're competing in a category that, in my opinion, has by far the highest quality of talented technical Georgios from Axelar and the wormhole team from jump. All these super technical people, is that fair to say? Or other categories you think are comparable to you guys?
00:17:48.304 - 00:18:02.684, Speaker C: No, I mean, I think there's, like, you look at Ilya from near, like, basically wrote part of the Transformer paper. Like, you know, like, there, there are some really, really smart people in the space who have transitioned in. I think there's still a mix of, like, Justin.
00:18:03.104 - 00:18:04.552, Speaker A: Justin's one of the strongest founders.
00:18:04.608 - 00:18:29.900, Speaker C: Exactly, Justin. Like, I think there's, there's still a mix. There's a lot of grift still. I think there's a lot of mix of. We've always had it from the earliest days of just like, overly academic group, like, people who come in and just. I don't know. There's a reason academics just like, aren't that good in any industry, is just the way that they, like, think about a problem versus actually executing the problem.
00:18:29.900 - 00:18:41.374, Speaker C: So it's not like, it's not like there's an overwhelming number of founders where I'm just like, everyone is amazing, but there are definitely just some really extremely high quality people in this space now, for sure.
00:18:41.534 - 00:19:06.304, Speaker A: Yeah. And you guys have always kind of taken the approach that you need this cross chain communication, cross chain asset moving omnichain tokens and does something like an ethereum ETF. Do you think it kind of changes anything? Does that mean that it's going to become more l two s to l two s? Or do you think we'll still need all these alt l one s?
00:19:06.424 - 00:19:53.060, Speaker C: Yeah, so we've always. So, like, originally we weren't even trying to build the thing. We're building some toy thing, and like, stumbled into building this problem. And ultimately our thesis became like, Internet is just a bunch of, like, execution environments that need to talk to, like, now you have a bunch of distributed execution environments that need to communicate. Went back and said, like, okay, like, the main thesis of all of this is like, disintermediate a bunch of people who just aren't needed in a system. And like, where is value created? And the fact of the matter is, like, if the Internet was a company today, it would be like the most valuable company on the planet. Even if you just take telcos, which is just like, rate out the amount of usage that people can get, it's like three and a half trillion dollars in just the US, Europe and China alone, just major telcos from those.
00:19:53.060 - 00:21:06.662, Speaker C: So it was just very clear, this is like, if you're betting on the hyper proliferation of chains, and very, very clear this was like a big problem to solve, which is why I think it's attracted so people so like great large problem to solve from there is just like, how do you make the most technologically agnostic version of that? How do you make the thing that's most akin to TCP iP? We thought l two s would actually be pretty bad for us because you have a L2 native bridge and like everyone, why would they not use the native bridge? And we found out is it's just like not the case at all. Like 50% of our volume right now is l two to l two massive, massive for all interop, like very massive layer more l two s is extremely good because nobody wants to go like arbitrum to optimism and wait seven days and pay two ethel one fees. Like, everyone will just price be able to do that quickly. All tell ones I treat as like, honestly, just like very strong orthogonal trade offs. Like, you started with ETH and you had a bunch of things that were like ETH, but with less validators eth, but with this change, right? And like all of that stuff just gets washed away as ETh scales, right? But now you have things that are like very, very strong orthogonal trade offs. You have Solana, which is like, we're going to do none of the stuff that ETh does. And all we care about is payments and extremely cheap and extremely fast.
00:21:06.662 - 00:21:41.904, Speaker C: And like, when I was a kid building an application, you would build a website and you just host it on my computer, and like, my power went out at my house. Like, the website is dead, nobody can look at it, right? You build a web app today and you use a million microservices where each one is like hyper optimized for storage for, you know, for whatever it is. And I think blockchains are just going to be like that. If you need applications that are more complex, you're going to need to use things that are optimized for storage, optimized for compute and throughput, optimized for, you know, whatever that may be, and you just need that. EtH won't be able to do all of that alone.
00:21:45.724 - 00:22:17.034, Speaker D: Yeah. Next question I have is like, what do you think about. So, you know, Justin Drake did this podcast with Banklis around, I guess, fragmented liquidity with deltas. You mentioned, you know, Eth is going to scale, but like, how do you think about the l two landscape? Because it seems like every single week or every other week there's like a new l two launching and they. I kind of feel like l two s are like farm tokens now. You know, these abridge eth, you farm it and do just dump the token, buy more eth. It's kind of tiresome.
00:22:17.034 - 00:22:29.018, Speaker D: Do you think it's, the space is going to be, I guess, you know, are there going to be a few l two s that's going to be dominant or do you think it's going to be, you know, 50 l two s all with anything?
00:22:29.066 - 00:22:59.134, Speaker C: It's going to be super power law distributed? I think there'll be a couple that are aggregate hubs. You can make the rest of the stuff seem. The real question is, like, what is an l two and why do we have them, right? And like, it really is to push off a lot of compute. And then you have a question. We could do a whole two hour podcast on like, what people think an l two is. And like, what an l two actually is, which I think is even still today very misunderstood. Like, so many people still think the current state of l two is just like fully inherent the security of Ethereum and all of this.
00:22:59.134 - 00:23:41.804, Speaker C: And so there's a bunch of stuff there that I think is still just like widely misunderstood, although improving. I don't know, I think there'll be small hubs that drive the most and then you'll have like either hyper specialization. So again, this is like take the mega eth route, or take something like that route that is going like very down one path of specialization, or your dedicated block space, which was always your l three right now thesis, which is just like, hey, we need consistency and how gas is going to be metered out and what it's going to cost. And I don't want some hot airdrop to break the chain or cause my transactions to go up 100 x.
00:23:44.364 - 00:23:51.664, Speaker B: Brian, I'm curious, like, where do you think layer zero will be ten years from now? Like, very curious what the long term vision is here.
00:23:52.044 - 00:24:23.914, Speaker C: The long term vision is that literally nobody, I don't need to talk on Twitter. Nobody thinks about it ever in the way, like, somebody building a website today doesn't think about the OSI model or TCP IP. It's just a thing that is useful that probably gets abstracted away through programming languages and tooling above it. And you just like, you know, you just don't care. You just have, you're doing this random async call and it's using this thing, but nobody really thinks about it a ton. So, like, the end state is, is clearly that. Yeah.
00:24:23.954 - 00:24:54.374, Speaker B: I mean, do you think that's antithetical in any way to our space? Because it seems to me that it's impossible for, like, crypto infrastructure to sort of like, decouple itself from the social aspect on Twitter. Like, it's, it's hard to imagine a world where layer zero community members, whether they got the airdrop, they purchased the token, whatever it may be, they got a grid, are not so mission aligned that they have this. They're not just using the infrastructure, they have this passion for it. Right. And this stakeholder, I mean, it's.
00:24:56.234 - 00:25:20.670, Speaker C: We'll see. I guess that it's very interesting right now that space has remained tightly coupled. Right. Like, people care about Uniswap, but they also care about Ethereum. People care about apps on Solana, but, like, they also care about Solana. Again, go to the current Internet and it's like the infra layer doesn't make any money. The telco layer makes a ton and the application layer makes a ton.
00:25:20.670 - 00:26:10.064, Speaker C: And now we're saying we're going to disintermediate a bunch of gatekeepers like telcos and other things. And where does it end up? Do people really socially only care about the application? Because most people, even though MongoDB is a multi billion dollar company or a multibillion dollar product and red hat and all of these things are like massive corporations like Swift. How many normal people, when they're sending a wire using their bank, care about Swift, which is like a $50 billion company, right? Like all of these things are massive and infrastructure matters. But like your average, even though you can buy the stock or do something, people just, you don't ever think about them. You don't ever care. And so I think socially, most of the layer eventually will bubble up to the application layer and like be owned there. But it's definitely more tightly coupled here than it is in any other industry that I can think of.
00:26:10.064 - 00:26:36.684, Speaker C: A lot of that is because I think we were just so early and all of us are also have been reaping the rewards of that for many years. There's a lot of excitement. Is bitcoin worth 3000 or 250,000? Who knows? We think one thing and the rest of the world thinks another. There's that component to it which over time at a certain scale will dissipate. Some volume will just. I don't know. Jordy knows better than I, but my assumption is volume will compress.
00:26:36.804 - 00:27:01.432, Speaker A: It will compress. But I mean, Brian I've done, like, Twitter spaces with you in the past, and you're messaging at the same time, multitasking. You're a massive multitask, which is great for a founder, because founders, I mean, I'm not as good as you, but, like, I have to, like, put that hat on multiple times and just, like, do multiple things. Do you. Do you watch markets at all? Like, do you try to track, you know, what's happening out there? I know it probably just happens through osmosis, I guess.
00:27:01.548 - 00:27:14.864, Speaker C: Yeah. So way, way less than I used to. Like, three years ago, we're starting. I was, you know, every new. I played with every single product within the space. I just used everything. I was, you know, trading all the time.
00:27:14.864 - 00:27:29.268, Speaker C: I was following prices all the time. Now it's just like, I see things on Twitter. Occasionally, I'll check price updates on my phone. I've really. I don't know, man. You just. You just get warned and there's, like, too much to do and you just have to start discarding stuff.
00:27:29.268 - 00:27:48.276, Speaker C: So definitely much more than I do on broader markets, which I think has been good in a lot of ways, but definitely more disconnected from, like, I don't know, a price move of 20% before, and I'm like, I'm liquidated. And now it's just, you know, I don't even really notice it other than, like, it happened.
00:27:48.380 - 00:27:53.964, Speaker A: How about, like, the major metas? Like, you know, oh, like, meme coins are the new thing now, like, for sure.
00:27:54.004 - 00:28:08.434, Speaker C: Oh, like, I'm. I don't think I'll ever not be super addicted to Twitter. So, like, I see everything that happens in Twitter all of the time. I just am not following more than, like, knowing that the thing happened, and generally it's there.
00:28:09.134 - 00:28:37.762, Speaker B: I wanted to ask you, Brian, about. So you guys, obviously, it's no secret, worked very closely with FTX. They were large investors. I recall when you put out that letter, you shared the letter publicly about next steps. But I'm curious what that was like. Did it feel like you were in the depths of despair? Were you disillusioned with crypto at all? Did you get burnt out? Like, what was that like, recovering from FTX and then growing on to build such a massive business? I think in the pre show, you were saying, like, was it 85 employees now?
00:28:37.898 - 00:28:38.474, Speaker C: 95?
00:28:38.514 - 00:28:40.354, Speaker B: Yeah, 95, yeah, yeah.
00:28:40.394 - 00:28:58.196, Speaker C: I mean, so it was interesting because we didn't even want to have FTX on the cap table. We were raising this round, so this round was insane, and a lot of decisions got made very quickly. We got preempted at 300 million. We turned it down. We'd only raised this round at 50. And we're like, we're just going to launch. Like, we're just going to launch.
00:28:58.196 - 00:29:19.646, Speaker C: We're not raising any more money. We're just going through and launching. Got preempt at 300 million. We're like, listen, thank you guys so much, but we're not going to raise another round. If we were ever to do another round, it would be our last ever. And, like, you know, we're going to go back to work and maybe we'll come back to you later if we think, we justify, but, like, we're not going to do it. So got eight preempts in eight days.
00:29:19.646 - 00:29:44.092, Speaker C: Started 300 million, went to a billion. One of the big investors was like, you have to talk to FTX. These are the most insane guys. I'd only like, I didn't even really know that much. I used it a little bit, but I didn't know anything about, like, Sam being the smartest man in the world. Everyone was telling me all these stuff at the time, so, like, you have to talk to them before you close the round. We fly there and land and we get off the plane, tiger is waiting with us.
00:29:44.092 - 00:30:12.830, Speaker C: And they're like, here's an offer for like a billion five. And then we go in and we end up turning down that offer and ended up settling, settling this round with, like, the three leads. But we ended up spending three days with FTX there. They were going to some, like, pig island or something. They were going out on a boat on Saturday and we were like, no, like, we're just going to work. And so Ryan and I, my cofounder and I were just, like, in their office working, and the only other two people in the office working were Sam and Romnick at the time. And we're like, all right.
00:30:12.830 - 00:30:37.974, Speaker C: Like, these guys actually, like, work pretty hard. This is interesting. Learned a little bit more and then brought them on as investors, and they were like, so they were one of the three leads of like a 16 z sequoia FTX. It was like, listen, like, we were totally remote at that point. They're like, you guys should come here and you should work. And so we all flew in 20, grew to 22 people there, and we just lived in Bahamas for five months. We were just, like, trapped in our own little hut, and we just, like, worked every single day when we were there.
00:30:37.974 - 00:30:57.182, Speaker C: And at the end of five months, we're like, we have to get out of here. And it was more because of the food than anything. The food in Bahamas is so unbelievably God awful. It's just, like, take, like, it is bad, bad food, and then, like, fry it one more time. And, like, that was just your food every single day. And so we're, like, we're just, like, dying. We have to get out.
00:30:57.182 - 00:31:00.374, Speaker C: And so we left in May, which was, like, way before everything blew up.
00:31:00.494 - 00:31:02.742, Speaker A: To, like, go to Pig island while you were still there, maybe.
00:31:02.798 - 00:31:07.742, Speaker C: Oh, we never went. Uh, I did, like, zero touristy things in Bahamas.
00:31:07.918 - 00:31:10.302, Speaker A: You missed out. Like, I went to pig Island.
00:31:10.398 - 00:31:14.154, Speaker C: I saw the pictures. I've heard it's great. Yeah.
00:31:14.974 - 00:31:21.918, Speaker A: Scroll down a little bit. Let's. Let's see, uh, let's see some of the pigs on the beach. They just, like, live there. They hang out. You go. You pet them.
00:31:21.918 - 00:31:28.694, Speaker A: Uh, you missed out, man. You're, you know, maybe you're going to build a $10 billion protocol, but you could have. You could have hang out with the pigs as well.
00:31:28.774 - 00:32:02.564, Speaker C: I I've heard it's awesome, but no, so, I mean, we left in May, and then in, whenever it was November when everything was blowing up, basically, the moment that we thought there was, like, the moment that things got crazy, we were just like, we have to, like, get them. Like, we have tier one investors. Like, our cap table is really good. We just, like, have to get them off the cap table. And so I think. I think we were, like, one of the only companies to do so. And it was just, like, immediately the very first sign of shakiness, I asked them if we could just, like, buy them out and be done with it, and we ended up getting them off the cap table.
00:32:02.564 - 00:32:23.276, Speaker C: So there wasn't really, like, the industry blowing up. I don't know. We didn't lose any people. Nobody quit the company. Like, three and a half years in, we've had three or four people leave the company ever. And so, like, everybody was still kind of in it, and we were just, like, building the thing that we're building. We had ten years of Runway.
00:32:23.276 - 00:32:32.624, Speaker C: We, you know, every. Everything was, like, good enough that it wasn't, you know, I was really depressed in 2018. That was hard for me. This was not that hard for me.
00:32:32.784 - 00:32:51.364, Speaker A: Yeah, speaking of, I mean, the. The tratfi guys that you had were kind of, like, crypto tourists. So, like, I mean, I remember Sequoia said they're not investing anymore. There were some of the. Some of the funds were just like, all right, this has gotten too much. But I guess, like, it doesn't affect progress too much.
00:32:51.544 - 00:33:30.686, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we were super transparent with everybody we're raising and just like, we know exactly what we're building and how we're going to build it, we don't want help on the crypto side of stuff at all, really. What we don't know how to do is build a world class organization. We just don't know how to build a large company, actually do it efficiently. So that was the thing that we wanted from them and that's still the thing. Most of the time when I have questions that I go and ask, no VC is ever going to know how you should build your product or know your product better than you. It's just an insanity to ever think that they will. They're very good at some things, but they're just not going to run your company for you.
00:33:30.686 - 00:33:36.394, Speaker C: They're not going to build your product for you. And if you take advice from them, you're very likely going to get wrecked long term.
00:33:37.854 - 00:34:00.398, Speaker D: Yeah. Speaking of VC's, we were talking about this pre show, but no, there's a lot of, I guess, anger towards, I guess, the quote unquote VC coins and like, the low flow Thai FDB meta. How do you think about, you know, these types of narratives and, you know, you know, of course, as you approach Tge, for sure. What's your, like, what are your opinions on that?
00:34:00.526 - 00:34:32.911, Speaker C: I think about it a ton. There's a bunch of stuff that people, that nobody knows. I'll publish something probably like in the next week or two. So a bunch of stuff that nobody knows. We were like, very, very thoughtful even from an early time. And so we've, you know, we've had years of big vc coin and all of this stuff, but. But I think we put a lot of time, even from the earliest moment of, like, how we thought about engaging with the community and everyone who had been involved super early on.
00:34:32.911 - 00:34:49.936, Speaker C: I think the low flow, high FTV meta is, like, very interesting. It's very clear that, like, really low flow just sucks. It's just like, bad for everybody. It's very clear dynamics, even. Yeah, it's just like, just clearly very bad. But the interesting thing is that a bunch of people.
00:34:50.080 - 00:35:05.288, Speaker A: Biases. I mean, Brian, you and I probably know cognitive biases quite well. Is it, is it. There's two ways to look at it. Like, one is, okay, this is a cognitive bias where it's a. It's an anchoring. Like, they anchor you with like, the really low flow, which is like the market cap on the price of the token.
00:35:05.288 - 00:35:17.652, Speaker A: And people just like assume, you know, token price, this is the token price. And then, you know, it slowly starts to go down because people are like selling onto it and you're kind of anchored at like, oh, you know, starkware should be $2 or.
00:35:17.708 - 00:35:55.240, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like, if you launch at $50 billion, like, are you really going to be like $500 million? Somebody's like, it's, you know, 10 billion seems like a steal now. Like, this is going to be a great buy. So, yeah, I think it biases people a ton towards that. But just the, the solutions have been very interesting. Like back in 20, like back in Ico era, everybody was just like, the team and investors need to be locked up forever or like as long as possible because they need, because everybody then was like, raise a bunch of money, buy a boat and like quit and stop working. You know, it's just like, just. Thanks, thanks for the ICO.
00:35:55.240 - 00:36:11.494, Speaker C: We're out. We're not ever going to launch a product. A lot of people are like, they need to be locked up forever or for a super long time to lock. And now people are like actually really long lockups and unlocks are like extremely bad. Like unlock them. And that also seems like pretty bad to me. I think there are both sides.
00:36:11.494 - 00:36:45.660, Speaker C: We actually, there's something that we considered that is this idea that Kobe had that he was pretty public about, which is basically like waive the investor lockup if they will sacrifice 50% of their tokens. So 50% of the tokens goes back directly to community and basically gets distributed broadly and they get unlocked immediately. Solves from this float issue. Solves. Now there's a bunch of, we looked into trying to do this because we think there's a bunch of reasons could be good regulatorily, you can't do it. So that's not something so funny because.
00:36:45.692 - 00:36:47.996, Speaker A: Like the regulation into like a lot.
00:36:48.020 - 00:36:50.972, Speaker C: Of things, a lot of ways to try to solve for this.
00:36:51.148 - 00:37:10.384, Speaker A: Yeah. The regulation is supposed to protect, you know, protect users, protect retail. Like all this is about user protection, but actually it does the opposite. You can't give out cash flows, you can't like do these unlocks before twelve months. It has the exact opposite effect. And Gary, you know, our protector maybe has not been acting very well.
00:37:11.364 - 00:37:12.184, Speaker C: Yep.
00:37:12.604 - 00:37:17.828, Speaker B: Well, today's not the day to criticize him, right? Push the eth through. Let's just let him have today.
00:37:17.876 - 00:37:19.916, Speaker C: You, Gary, we're back.
00:37:20.060 - 00:37:20.784, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:21.884 - 00:37:43.984, Speaker A: Let's take a quick break from the, from the heavy stuff and go to our sponsors. I'm just kidding. No sponsors. I just want to like, you know. No, actually, like, we have to pay to do this. We're not getting paid. You know, Justin and I are always, you know, coordinating our payments to make sure this show goes out to everybody for free.
00:37:43.984 - 00:37:52.494, Speaker A: Let's go to Coingecko because somebody put in the chat that I think you got liquidated. That's why he left. I want to see what's happening, hopefully.
00:37:55.234 - 00:37:55.602, Speaker C: Okay.
00:37:55.618 - 00:38:06.374, Speaker A: It's actually not bad. I mean, ETh is kind of stabilizing. Bitcoin, surprisingly, is bouncing back a little bit on the 24 hours. It looks like it's actually up.
00:38:07.034 - 00:38:10.134, Speaker C: Tether still holding strong there.
00:38:10.514 - 00:38:20.680, Speaker D: And doge, I mean, rip kubosu. Rip for kabosu. He passed away this morning.
00:38:20.872 - 00:38:24.744, Speaker A: That explains the slight over performance there.
00:38:24.904 - 00:38:39.824, Speaker D: Yeah. Like, do you guys remember last in 2023? Like, people were writing investment memos for Doge because, like, Kavosu might die soon. Like, it was so pvp that people were like tracking Kavosu's health, man.
00:38:39.864 - 00:38:45.384, Speaker C: Right? The best value of their work comes. It comes after they're dead. They can't create and create anything new.
00:38:45.424 - 00:39:18.598, Speaker A: So you guys see this tweet, like the somebody found on chain. Like someone has been accumulating kubosu meme coin for like months and months in anticipation of this event for like 300k or something. Like he made like 500k or something. So he's just been slowly waiting. And I feel like the same thing is going to happen with the bowdoin thing. People can just sort of, there is going to be some exit opportunity for Bowdoin around the debates or something. And it's obviously like a silly game and it's very negative.
00:39:18.598 - 00:39:19.594, Speaker A: Some probably.
00:39:21.574 - 00:39:41.874, Speaker C: We have somebody in the office who at a certain point had like, I don't know, like four to five times their salary in Bowden coin and tried very hard to get them to divest some. And they're just there, you know, they're not selling till November, so you've still got lots of bowdoin maxis out in the wild.
00:39:42.914 - 00:39:51.906, Speaker B: Brian, I just wanted to take a second. Like, you've been in this space for a while now. Several years. Since what, 2017 was it? Or before 2015?
00:39:52.090 - 00:39:58.690, Speaker C: 1St touch, 2011 ish, right? When poker was banned, but really, like 2013, I was running racks of miners. I was at ETH.
00:39:58.722 - 00:40:22.794, Speaker B: ICO, we'll call it eleven years in like a few weeks time or months. I'm not sure when. TGE is like, you're going to find your token somewhere high up on this list. You know, it's a great project. Presumably it'll be somewhere here. How does that feel? You've been watching this space for ten years and pretty soon you're going to have one of the dominant projects. Are you excited? Nervous? All of the above?
00:40:23.174 - 00:41:00.850, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think it's, I think it's a little bit of everything. I think we've like very much just focused on like build the thing and I think we're trying like the thing. Like a lot of people launch a token and like become a token company. Kind of like we really want to, like our, we're very, like, we just think about things on a very long term time horizon. We have all the time in the world in terms of funding a Runway to like, build something that's going to be genuinely useful on like a really long time horizon. So like, we try internally, like, not to think about it too much. I try not to anchor to what anything will be.
00:41:00.850 - 00:41:30.632, Speaker C: And just like, at the end of the day, in a three month period, on a twelve month period, maybe it will matter a lot. On a five year period, it won't matter. We have to win and we have to win. We have to build the hard stuff and get everybody to build on top of us. And we just built all this native restaking that Etherfine Athena and all these other groups are using. We're building stuff that's being deployed at scale for many, many billions to tens of billions of dollars in production. That's just much more challenging and interesting problem to me.
00:41:30.632 - 00:42:05.444, Speaker C: So is it like nerve wracking? Is there like this emotion? Yeah, it is for sure. But I would say it's almost more of a stressor than anything else. It's like when you start a company, early on it was just me, Ryan and Caleb. And we're just like building this thing because we just love building stuff. And now at 95 employees, the world is just different. You have the weight of responsibility of every time we took a funding round, there's just this weight of like expectations of other, other people have bet on you, all these employees who have like bet their lives on you. And I think.
00:42:05.444 - 00:42:32.622, Speaker C: I think it's just an additional, like weight more. More than anything else. More than like, I'm bad at celebration. I don't know, we, I remember when we raised our round at 3 billion people who were asking me like, how's it feeling in the billion? When you were like, first unicorn, like, how's it feel? And I was like, like, we didn't even take like 1 second to pat ourselves in the back, we're just like, we need to launch. Like, we're building. Like, I don't know, it's a, it's a weight and almost a burden more than. It's more than.
00:42:32.622 - 00:42:43.990, Speaker C: It's this great thing. But I very strongly believe in sort of, like, democratized exposure to everything. And again, having, like, a, like, real broad ownership of the rails.
00:42:44.182 - 00:43:19.902, Speaker D: Yeah. Speaking of challenges, you know, I think you did something that's very unique where, you know, you're trying to filter out the sybils, right? And you're creating dialogue, which I think is good, because usually teams just, you know, drop their token, like, 7% allocation or whatever, and then the community gets pissed. But this time around, you know, you're saying, okay, like, this is how we're thinking about it. And, you know, let me know if you have feedback. So you have, like, civil detection. They're self reporting. Can you just talk about the entire process? Like, how many wallets have self reported? Like, what did you learn about clustering in wallets? That entire experience, for sure.
00:43:19.958 - 00:43:36.048, Speaker C: So, I mean, people always equate back to, like, just do it. Like, Uniswap did it, or, like, arbitrum didn't. It just like, wasn't that much farming that really uniswap. I used uniswap. I got the uniswap airdrop. But it was just like, one day I was just like, oh, I got this thing. I wasn't like, maybe airdrop is going to give me.
00:43:36.048 - 00:43:55.906, Speaker C: Maybe uniswap is going to give me a token, so I'm going to, like, spam transactions across, like, 100,000 wallets. This is, like, wasn't a thing back then. And so people got, like, a meaningful amount, and there was, like, this connection with uniswap. People are happy. They loved it. Tons of people held their unitoken, all of this stuff. It's a different world today, and I don't think people, like, really acknowledge that.
00:43:55.906 - 00:44:40.558, Speaker C: We had 6 million wallets on layer zero and just a massive, huge civil clusters. And so, yes, it would have been so easy for us to just launch low flow, high fTV, just vanilla, give out the coin. Everyone's happy, nobody complains, but we just don't think it's the right thing to actually do. I think it matters to, like, reward the right people. There's a bunch of devs and a bunch of people who, like, really bet on us early, and there's. There's protocols who had a bunch of, had a bunch of choices early and made the decision to, like, build on top of layer zero and drive, like, all of this stuff that, like, made us successful. And I would way rather disproportionately reward those people and get rid of symbols.
00:44:40.558 - 00:44:45.194, Speaker C: So the question is, like, how do you actually get rid of it? Because there's a lot of, like, very sophisticated actors.
00:44:45.564 - 00:45:07.756, Speaker A: You're never going to get very sophisticated sybils. I mean, like, there's people doing all kinds of clever ways to lunivate it. Let's put, let's put the. The most sophisticated Sybil you've had of all. Can you, can you bring up this, this tweet? Taiki, I'll remind you of the painful. Okay, this is not, this is not the tweet.
00:45:07.900 - 00:45:10.224, Speaker B: Okay? These are sophisticated symbols, though.
00:45:12.774 - 00:45:16.014, Speaker A: These are sophisticated symbols. There's an even more sophisticated one.
00:45:16.174 - 00:45:17.154, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:45:17.734 - 00:45:24.078, Speaker A: First off, we did indeed buy all the tokens. Symbol number one, Mister Sam.
00:45:24.206 - 00:45:37.310, Speaker C: That was such a painful day, man. That was such a painful day. Oh, that was. It was. Yeah. We were all there in the office. Everybody was, like, waiting for the launch of Stargate.
00:45:37.310 - 00:45:56.732, Speaker C: And when we, like, planned to launch it, zero expectations. We didn't even know if, like, the auction would sell out. We, like, definitely not one block. And so we start, and it was like, boom, first block, 25 million, like, sold out. And we're like, that's insane. Like, this is amazing. We're all celebrating, and two blocks later, we're like, one person bought it.
00:45:56.732 - 00:46:18.098, Speaker C: Like, what? Like, what happened? And then finding out that it was them and then needing to get them to, like, you know, they agreed at the time to, like, lock it up for this really long period. Obviously, none of that matters now because of the, you know, because of the estate, but, like, it just turned into, like, this really miserable thing. And so many people were angry and it went from, like, this great moment to this miserable moment. But, yeah, it was, it was the worst.
00:46:18.266 - 00:47:07.610, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think, like, it shows the importance of game theory in some of these designs from now on. I mean, we've had this happen with Jupiter, the launchpad on Solana where they think they're all smart and they're like, oh, we got this very interesting one block gone. Like, yep, you've created a plus ev thing for somebody. Just buy and then sell it higher, of course. So, of course, like, you're trying to use your, you know, your experience with game theory with, with the launch now. And it's so funny how some of the teams I talk to, including things like Eigen Layer, Etherfi, you guys you spend a ton of hours on the actual product, but then it's like, it feels like there's equal amount of time spent on getting the distribution of the airdrop, which is supposed to like, it's not the product, just like just giving out the candy, basically.
00:47:07.610 - 00:47:25.458, Speaker A: But somehow it becomes like spreadsheets and spreadsheets. And I mean, obviously it's important to get the sentiment right and get the distribution to the community, so and avoid this like San trabuco stuff. Do you feel like you're, you're close now? Like, what's your feeling right now?
00:47:25.586 - 00:48:02.570, Speaker C: Yeah, it's, I don't think, well, one of the problems is a lot of the Sybil and a lot of this, like, broader, it's gone from industrial farmers to people making guides to everybody farming to just like, so now a lot of Twitter sentiment. There's like thousands and thousands of accounts who have like, vested interest in this. Or if you actually do something that disrupts this sentiment is going to be bad. And I think we've just accepted that. It's actually turned into being pretty good because people see that there's a lot of abuse happening for us. It was basically just like, okay, how do we solve this one? Totally new. There's no chance we're going to be able to like detect all Sybil from day one.
00:48:02.570 - 00:48:24.986, Speaker C: It was not going to be able to. And so when we put up the self report, you have a bunch of people who share software. So people make software and sell it to everyone. Everyone runs this. And so any of those sort of groupings or clusters who self report, we then use as a data set to like detect other sibling, I think that's really powerful. So it's just like, listen, civil activity has clearly provided some value to the protocol. You can just take 15% outright.
00:48:24.986 - 00:48:58.296, Speaker C: So like, whether that's gas plus, you know, whatever is probably about the fair amount relative to a real user, like one 7th of a real user, and then we're going to use that data set to like catch other sybils. And if people don't report, then they get nothing. And then after that is sort of this bounty process of going through and, you know, basically taking in all of these reports. Some people like the amount of effort people put in this. I published one last night. There's just like amazing, like real, just so you can never read that and not be like, this is just like completely conclusive. And then it comes down to just like final criteria and get it right.
00:48:58.320 - 00:49:02.920, Speaker A: And we started at some point the reports, I mean, people incentivize just to like try to report everybody.
00:49:02.952 - 00:49:16.004, Speaker C: Like, yeah, but it has to, I mean, it has to be like conclusive and your entire report has to be conclusive. Right? And so it's, you were like just reporting. Everybody does, it doesn't really solve, it doesn't really get you anything.
00:49:16.464 - 00:49:19.980, Speaker A: But do you have like a factory of like people in like India just.
00:49:20.012 - 00:49:47.916, Speaker C: Going, so this has happened for sure. Right? So already we have that, that got massively, massively spammed. So there's two things that happen. Bounty reports open gets spammed with about 9000 submissions from a bunch of random people. And then externally everybody goes through and reports all of the legitimate reports. Or they write a scraper to say, if our addresses are in these reports, then we're going to report them. Report them to GitHub and get their GitHub accounts banned.
00:49:47.916 - 00:50:07.414, Speaker C: So the reports disappear. Right. So that part has been like the execution of that has been a total mess. Like total mess. I think we have the solution now. We're basically, we'll reopen it probably today or tomorrow for final submissions, probably 24 hours of final submissions. And we've been going through a bunch of the reports, but we'll just require a bond for every single person who's putting up a report.
00:50:07.414 - 00:50:11.022, Speaker C: And your bond will basically just be lit on fire if it's not a reasonable report.
00:50:11.078 - 00:50:13.878, Speaker A: You're getting symbol on the Sybil report, you're getting Sybil.
00:50:13.926 - 00:50:21.432, Speaker C: And their accounts are getting like civil band, right? So like reported and GitHub is like banning the real proof of stake.
00:50:21.488 - 00:50:25.644, Speaker A: You're doing like a proof of stake in order to avoid this.
00:50:26.064 - 00:50:53.954, Speaker C: Just reinventing all systems to do this. So it's been messy, but I think the end result has been good, like of our, of our 800,000 initial Sybil that we found. So 6 million total wallets. A bunch of those, like a huge portion of those have only done like one transaction ever. So just wipe across, wipe away a bunch of them. 800,000 of like legitimate symbol found in the first one. And if you took every appeal being submitted as being like an honest appeal, we're only at like a two to two and a half percent false positive rate.
00:50:53.954 - 00:50:59.962, Speaker C: And when you think a bunch of those are not valid appeals, you're down to like 0.5 to 1.5%.
00:50:59.978 - 00:51:13.382, Speaker A: You should issue like a ticker, like, you know, dollar sign Sybil. And then you can make it an abs and get like the security from Eigen layer and then you can airdrop to people that's how you really play the game. I think Justin sun would do it that way.
00:51:13.478 - 00:51:27.182, Speaker C: Man. We've had so many really large projects reach out to us and, like, like, if we could turn it into a product, I think everybody would buy it. I think, you know, everybody is dealing with the same issues here, but it's.
00:51:27.198 - 00:51:39.000, Speaker A: A little bit different because a lot of them have TVL. And it's like, you know, it's not really Sybil. Like, it's TVL. It's sort of linear. If they want to do nonlinear, then it's a problem because, you know, you have all these, like, shitty small accounts.
00:51:39.032 - 00:52:07.468, Speaker C: It's easy. It's easy. If you can do it purely linearly, like, then Sybil doesn't even become that much of an issue. The problem with us is, like, how do you, like, how do you weight a transaction that has moved, like, $10,000 on Stargate versus, like, somebody who has moved an NFT versus, like, an application who has just, like, updated its state for what the new, like, rate is? Permissions or something, right? And there's just like, yeah, there's, there's a lot of messiness there.
00:52:07.636 - 00:52:08.316, Speaker A: Nice.
00:52:08.460 - 00:52:25.916, Speaker B: Yeah, we were talking about this. I've been talking about it for a couple weeks now. It's like, there's no way to please everybody. Like, you're gonna, you know, a good portion. There's gonna be a huge vocal, probably majority even, that's upset with the distribution. And, yeah, I hope you guys are ready for it.
00:52:25.980 - 00:52:53.486, Speaker C: I mean, us, it's like, we'll take all of the heat if there is. It just doesn't matter. The question is, do we actually think two things? Do we think we're doing the right thing? And do we think the end distribution, like, achieves the goal that you want? And the goal should be, like, the most aligned, the highest percentage of, like, real users maximally aligned with the protocol. Right? Like, that's what you want. The people who actually believe they're actually built aligned with the protocol. And if, like, you get that part right, just take all of the noise and it's fine. Right?
00:52:53.630 - 00:53:13.244, Speaker A: Yeah. So, Justin, like, I disagree. Like, yeah, everyone's going to hate the referee in the football game. Like, everyone's going to, like, throw stuff no matter, you know, you gave a penalty to those guys. Everyone thinks the referee is biased against them. But if you're the referee, like Brian is in this case, you have to still just do your best job to be. To be objective and just let everybody, like, throw bottles.
00:53:13.244 - 00:53:24.624, Speaker A: That's fine. But sometimes you do make people happy. And Justin, I mean, I saw some of the controversy of the referee for the poly, the poly market on the ETF approval.
00:53:25.204 - 00:53:26.396, Speaker B: Yeah, so I.
00:53:26.580 - 00:53:28.476, Speaker A: Let's talk about that.
00:53:28.620 - 00:53:57.092, Speaker B: Yeah. So I famously, you know, widely reported, very well known, long to the poly market, that the ETF would be approved at $0.07. So basically bought in at a 7% chance the ETF was approved. This was widely reported, a very famous call on my end. And of course, the ETF did get approved, but there was a little scandal with the poly market. There's two documents the SEC has to approve to, like, make this official. I believe the ETF commentators said it was like two keys with a nuclear switch.
00:53:57.092 - 00:54:21.272, Speaker B: Both have to be inserted and turned to activate the ETF. We didn't get that yesterday only was it, the 19 b's were approved, not the other form. And so there was this big dispute whether polymarket would say this was the approval or if we need both. Fortunately, polymarket made the right decision. They decided to say that in spirit. This thing was approved, we'll approve it. We'll mark this as resolved.
00:54:21.272 - 00:54:29.064, Speaker B: The ETF was approved. Let's move forward. And so it was, it was a great outcome and for people that believed in the ETF the whole time.
00:54:29.104 - 00:54:33.164, Speaker C: I have a question for you. S one s are denied. Will you still think it was the right outcome?
00:54:34.624 - 00:54:44.320, Speaker B: No, but I think it's like, on a balance of probabilities. On a balance of probabilities, if we think like that, s one, is 99% chance going to get approved?
00:54:44.352 - 00:54:48.678, Speaker C: Because given they need to decide by the 31st and s one s might not be approved by the 31st, then.
00:54:48.726 - 00:54:48.886, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:48.910 - 00:54:52.454, Speaker C: Yeah, we have to make a decision. But, yeah, it's interesting.
00:54:52.574 - 00:54:57.094, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm biased though, of course. So it's, you know, I don't know if I'm the most valuable commentator here.
00:54:57.134 - 00:55:17.284, Speaker A: But by the way, we have, like, over, I think we have over 600 views live, which is our live record. So let's even get to a thousand. Yeah. Please, please, guys. Like, like and subscribe. It is an exciting week and I think that's, that's evident. You know, everyone is paying attention.
00:55:17.284 - 00:55:43.264, Speaker A: There's been some, some fun Twitter stuff going on. I know you're like, always scanning crypto Twitter because it's very entertaining. Brian, maybe let's, let's do a pasta and get through some of the Twitter things we've been seeing. This is the old pasta version. We'll show you the new pasta graphic. Can we get the new pasta graphic. There we go.
00:55:45.084 - 00:55:49.716, Speaker B: Beautiful. The budget's going up, guys. Then the market goes up. The budget goes up.
00:55:49.900 - 00:55:55.624, Speaker D: Yes. Production quality is gonna be up only months.
00:55:56.084 - 00:55:58.224, Speaker A: Steady, lads. Symbol mafia is here.
00:56:00.044 - 00:56:06.572, Speaker D: The comment section is, like. Or the chat is, like, happy people are just spamming, like, one token and what?
00:56:06.668 - 00:56:08.304, Speaker C: Welcome to my life, boys.
00:56:09.644 - 00:56:15.876, Speaker D: I bet your DM's are just, like, filled with possible task. Yeah. Yeah.
00:56:15.980 - 00:56:19.268, Speaker A: So who's going to go first? Let's. Justin, defending champion.
00:56:19.356 - 00:56:19.596, Speaker D: Let's.
00:56:19.620 - 00:56:20.460, Speaker A: Let's see what you got.
00:56:20.532 - 00:56:32.546, Speaker B: I've got a good one, though. I don't want to. All right, I've got a video. It's a 32nd clip. This was actually submitted by an audience member saying, justin, you were right. The ETF was approved. This has got to be your pasta.
00:56:32.546 - 00:56:35.794, Speaker B: And so I think you guys are going to love this one.
00:56:44.654 - 00:56:56.462, Speaker D: So, I was right. I took a rash of shit for two years, but I was right, and everyone was wrong. And, yeah, I got a bonus check for it.
00:56:56.638 - 00:56:57.594, Speaker A: Sue me.
00:56:58.394 - 00:57:03.214, Speaker D: You know, it's a lot of money. I get it. I could feel you judging me.
00:57:03.674 - 00:57:04.814, Speaker B: That's palpable.
00:57:05.714 - 00:57:08.242, Speaker D: But, hey, I never said I was.
00:57:08.258 - 00:57:09.454, Speaker A: The hero of this story.
00:57:10.874 - 00:57:19.094, Speaker B: That's pretty much how I feel. Coming into the show right now is a perfect encapsulation of what I'm feeling. So that was a good one.
00:57:19.634 - 00:57:22.094, Speaker D: Congrats, man. Congrats.
00:57:23.754 - 00:57:26.746, Speaker A: Okay, cool. Well, that's it.
00:57:26.770 - 00:57:37.178, Speaker B: I need to. Okay, I'm seeing the chat, Justin, one already. Thank you, Sam. Yeah, I don't know. Do we. Should we just end the show now? Do we need to see the others?
00:57:37.306 - 00:57:44.666, Speaker A: The good thing is, when we have a live show, we get to. We get to poll the audience. So let's. Let's see. Let's see. Taiki, what do we have?
00:57:44.810 - 00:57:49.794, Speaker D: Actually, Justin, can you pull up the disk track? I want to pull up that one.
00:57:49.914 - 00:57:52.134, Speaker B: Yep. I can do a quick pivot here.
00:57:53.794 - 00:58:11.894, Speaker D: Yeah. So, you know, everyone knows cc two ventures, the famous airdrop farmer. Similar on Twitter. Recently, there's been this diss track dropped. We don't have to listen to the entire thing, but, Justin, can you, like, just play audio on go full screen?
00:58:14.594 - 00:58:16.454, Speaker A: I would delete my account, too.
00:58:20.114 - 00:58:20.974, Speaker B: Shame.
00:58:22.794 - 00:58:24.374, Speaker C: So many ref links.
00:58:25.474 - 00:58:26.614, Speaker B: All for what?
00:58:34.794 - 00:58:37.306, Speaker D: To the bureau. I got 180 wallets.
00:58:37.330 - 00:58:37.866, Speaker A: You a widow.
00:58:37.890 - 00:58:39.074, Speaker C: Need to go and touch some grass.
00:58:39.114 - 00:58:42.634, Speaker D: We burn your shit near. Look, should have known that your ass wasn't alone.
00:58:42.674 - 00:58:44.426, Speaker A: You can blame yourself for you throwing.
00:58:44.450 - 00:58:55.944, Speaker D: Rats about bone as a ref link, reference your belt, you'd be posting. Everyone thirsty, man, that's good.
00:58:58.724 - 00:59:02.344, Speaker A: It's like your background song today. Like, it feels like you've been listening to it on loop.
00:59:03.324 - 00:59:07.476, Speaker D: Yeah, that one's a banger. You know, that was a banger. When I listened to that, I was like.
00:59:07.500 - 00:59:07.900, Speaker A: So.
00:59:08.012 - 00:59:27.694, Speaker D: It was so funny. Feels like the meta changes all the time. You know, like one time it's like, I don't know, like low FTV coins or like low flow coins. Good. Now it's like new coin bad, right? New coin, piece of shit. Now it's like, yeah, like, bridging is bad. Air drop army is bad.
00:59:28.034 - 00:59:50.648, Speaker A: So what's the story with this guy? Like, this guy, this guy is obviously like an, you know, airdrop influencer as we call it. Like he posts tweets telling people how to farm and Sybil and kind of get around airdrops. And he was unhappy with, with some recent. Yeah, and then, like, he deleted his account. I didn't follow exactly. Brian, you know exactly what happened there.
00:59:50.736 - 01:00:15.210, Speaker C: Yeah. For, I mean, loosely. This is somebody who in the past, like you said, airdrop influencer goes and tells people, here's what I think you should be doing. Said like 15 times that they had inside information on layer zero. Is going to do this. Gonna do this. This is like wrong every, every time along the way, but really is like people, people love them just like people love sort of heroes in every arc.
01:00:15.210 - 01:00:53.144, Speaker C: And so when we announced the Sybil detection stuff, I got like, very, very upset, deleted their account, came back now, you know, but some, we were talking about it pre show, like, why do people, why do people love this kind of person? Why does this kind of person, like, exist or do this? And like, yeah, you. A lot of rough links, a lot of clout for being right along the way. And then you can guarantee being right because there's a lot of projects now who actually pay them as an advisor to show their airdrop. And all of this stuff. Everything you're doing becomes, you become the savant in self fulfilling prophecies.
01:00:53.444 - 01:01:06.872, Speaker A: There's a certain type of user that just wants airdrops. They don't want to spend a lot of money. They just want to try to get these. Just like there's NFT users who like collectibles. There's a, there isn't. There's an airdrop user and people making bots. And then you could use the bots to farm airdrops.
01:01:06.872 - 01:01:22.856, Speaker A: And like you said, like some L2, some chains were even like welcoming the bots. Like, yeah, come and just do activities and TPS and stuff. I guess you guys didn't want to, like, try to just get these cheap metrics, but some people are saying that you were benefiting implicitly.
01:01:23.040 - 01:01:23.400, Speaker C: Yep.
01:01:23.432 - 01:01:24.696, Speaker A: I mean, how do you see it?
01:01:24.800 - 01:01:47.796, Speaker C: Super hard for us because, again, not something like, there's a bunch of legal restrictions around what you can talk about. We never said ever from the beginning forward that we were doing a token. We never mentioned it. Like, it was written in the protocol that there could be a token. And so people had, like, seen the code, but we never, ever said, never said we're doing a token. We never said any distribution. Like, never talked about it.
01:01:47.796 - 01:02:13.360, Speaker C: It was just like, we're just not going to say anything publicly. And then you go back around the time of our series b, and there just becomes a massive amount of speculation. They just raised this round at 3 billion. They must be doing their token soon. And everybody starts coming and things just get, like, really, really insane. This is part of the reason why for the self report, we said, like, we'll offer 15%. Like, we get people spent gas and, like, use the protocol in the hopes of this.
01:02:13.360 - 01:02:46.010, Speaker C: And, like, you're not a real, like, durable user long term. Take the 15% and then that's, that's like a reasonable sort of trade there. But people, I think people are upset that we didn't come out earlier and be like, no, you shouldn't be doing this or doing that. But from our end, it was just like, we can't comment on anything, so we just don't say anything about any possible distribution or any future token or anything like that. So it was a very hard position to be in. But it was like, for us, internally hated it. It was actually miserable.
01:02:46.010 - 01:03:01.162, Speaker C: There was nothing but win zero and airdrop threads every day for a year of my life, and we couldn't really say anything. And people were coming and being like, this thing is definitely happening next month. Like, here's the airdrop guide you need to follow.
01:03:01.298 - 01:03:04.642, Speaker A: Can't even deny. Like, you can't deny. You can't. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
01:03:04.738 - 01:03:06.294, Speaker B: Jordan, let Brian talk.
01:03:07.594 - 01:03:15.506, Speaker A: Sorry, Danic. So first, like, I can't let you know. I can't interrupt Brian. I can't interrupt Justin, who is like, the ETF God.
01:03:15.610 - 01:03:17.578, Speaker D: Why GCR market God.
01:03:17.626 - 01:03:21.054, Speaker A: YGCR can interrupt him. So it's just you, Taiki. I can interrupt?
01:03:21.594 - 01:03:29.994, Speaker D: Okay. Okay. For now, wait till I become asian GCR. You can never interrupt me.
01:03:30.114 - 01:03:35.054, Speaker A: Oh, my God. All right. Like, Brian, do you have, do you have a pasta?
01:03:35.754 - 01:03:54.744, Speaker C: Yeah, I submitted one or two. I was torn between, this is one just all the Nick Carter memes I thought were hilarious meme format that were getting used everywhere. My second was sailor, and it's a picture of Vitalik and, like, his unicorn shirt, and it says sailors next conference. But, yeah, this is my submission.
01:03:55.444 - 01:03:58.944, Speaker B: Do you. So did you have your money on Nick Carter, then?
01:03:59.684 - 01:04:15.908, Speaker A: Just because, like, we have a 25% audio audience. So the submission is, I think, trustless state broke his own rib. And there's a picture of Nick Carter. Pretty buff. I mean, he's got the Miami cuban thing going. Like, looks. Looks pretty, pretty strong here.
01:04:16.076 - 01:04:25.464, Speaker C: This is this format. There's the particular caption. Doesn't matter, but this format is just being used over and over again. And true, sort of semi. Semi pasta.
01:04:25.804 - 01:04:29.092, Speaker D: Yeah. And they were supposed to do a boxing match next week, right? A consensus.
01:04:29.148 - 01:04:29.744, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:04:30.724 - 01:04:33.348, Speaker D: Yeah. Like, Hoffman broke his rib or something.
01:04:33.476 - 01:04:52.214, Speaker A: Yeah, unfortunately, yeah, he did. And maybe you can bring up Jose from Delphi, uh, another, uh, x, you know, ten years ago poker guy. But he. He says that he is willing to step up and defend.
01:04:53.074 - 01:04:53.682, Speaker B: Wow.
01:04:53.778 - 01:05:16.754, Speaker A: Honor in. In place of trustless state. Um, this guy's been doing, like, BJJ for, like, infinite years. I would not get in the ring with him, uh, if I was, um, if I was Nick Carter. Although maybe. Maybe boxing is okay, but let's see. Like, this would be fun because I think a lot of.
01:05:17.854 - 01:05:25.998, Speaker B: Do you ever see yourself, like, is this. Are any of the interoperability protocols? Is there ever going to be a battle? Are you going to ever take it to the arena?
01:05:26.126 - 01:05:43.424, Speaker C: I mean, I wrestled collegiately. I wrestled for ten years. So if we're doing some sort of competition in that realm, sure, I guess I would participate, but I think, I don't know. We can't even get them to do proper debates anymore, so it's unlikely we're going to get a fight.
01:05:44.044 - 01:06:09.232, Speaker A: Wasn't haseeb a heads up guy as well? Couldn't we do. Yep, we could do a little heads up. Poker, fight night. I'd be down. All right, well, my pasta is a literal pasta, and it's one of the better pasta. So, you know, pasta of the week, everybody's like, normally, you know, we're just putting memes up and funny stuff, but normally, pasta subway should be something that. It's like a chant.
01:06:09.232 - 01:06:09.928, Speaker A: Everybody can just.
01:06:09.976 - 01:06:11.416, Speaker B: We don't need the lecture, Jordy.
01:06:11.480 - 01:06:31.600, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. Bring out pasta. Because this one, you know, we got. I'm in a group with thiki and a bunch of other people, and it says, you know, this was yesterday while we were waiting for the announcement. It says, the next hour, our hearts beat us. One unified by hope and fear.
01:06:31.600 - 01:06:59.336, Speaker A: This moment, more critical than any before, holds our collective dreams in balance. The approval rejection of the ETTF will decide our fate. We will rise, enjoy a celebration, our aspirations validated or descend into a shared sorrow. Our hopes momentarily dashed. This hour, the most pivotal of our lives will define our future. And then just people just copy pasta this everywhere epic. I don't know who wrote this.
01:06:59.336 - 01:07:13.296, Speaker A: I have no idea. But this is my choice chat. So let's get, let's get the poll out and maybe let's put a thiccy one because some people are saying thiccy one. I don't know. He has no submission. But did he pre submit?
01:07:13.440 - 01:07:13.840, Speaker B: He did.
01:07:13.872 - 01:07:14.216, Speaker D: I don't think.
01:07:14.240 - 01:07:25.104, Speaker B: He did not pre submit. No. But the poll is up and running now, I believe, on YouTube. So if you're watching live on YouTube, I will try to pull up the poll as well, see if I can get the live results in.
01:07:26.844 - 01:07:29.804, Speaker A: We'll wait for those to come in. Let's do all time.
01:07:29.884 - 01:07:40.156, Speaker C: All time. Greatest pasta has to be the federal investigation pasta. I just don't think there's any, there's any that has had the longevity and it's just too good.
01:07:40.300 - 01:07:47.264, Speaker A: This is the in case of any investigation, I am here against my own will or what does it say?
01:07:47.564 - 01:07:49.608, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know why I'm here.
01:07:49.716 - 01:07:54.244, Speaker C: It's been so many years and I still just see it regularly used. It's just never left.
01:07:54.584 - 01:08:12.976, Speaker B: Wow. The results are. I'm getting a little surprised by the results, honestly. I'm wondering if people think if they vote for the right person, they'll get a special airdrop. I don't know what's happening here. So, yeah, it looks like we have some initial votes coming in, 115 votes. So make sure to get your votes in.
01:08:12.976 - 01:08:25.366, Speaker B: But right now brian's a strong lead at 35%. I'm coming in in second at 27, Tyche at 24, and jordy, I thought you might had a chance at winning, but last place at 15, people not.
01:08:25.390 - 01:08:51.704, Speaker A: Feeling the written pasta they wanted. Okay. All right, let's, let's give a couple more minutes. Maybe let's end with a little bit of a q and a from the chat. Since we have a prima with us, please know layer zero token stuff that cannot be answered because, you know, we're going to ignore those. But if anybody wants to put some chats, some questions, let's see.
01:08:54.804 - 01:08:58.052, Speaker D: Yeah, in case of any investigation, they're.
01:08:58.068 - 01:09:05.996, Speaker A: Asking Taiki how many, how many layer zero wallets? I mean, is there such a zero wallet? I mean, I have like normal wallets that have just been doing transactions. I'm assuming I'm six.
01:09:06.100 - 01:09:11.694, Speaker C: No, we don't, you know, not, not a blockchain. Don't have our own wallet. There's no real layer zero wallet.
01:09:12.154 - 01:09:30.410, Speaker A: Okay, we're starting to get some questions. Meanwhile, I have a question. What do you think of Taun? It's obviously the one that stands out to me as a differentiated blockchain right now. They have the distribution. It's a different design, different type of user base. What's your feeling on taun? Are you guys looking at tawn?
01:09:30.562 - 01:09:56.580, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. For actual, I mean, we spent a lot of time going through the actual architecture of chains. Tan's architecture is just like very, very, very interesting. I don't think people give it nearly enough credit for what it is. Obviously now it's becoming more and more popular and I think they just have massive distribution which matters. But, yeah, I think even the technology itself, the team is great. The tech is great.
01:09:56.580 - 01:09:58.704, Speaker C: It's very interesting ecosystem.
01:09:59.204 - 01:10:18.838, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's great. You got these mobile users that you can try to target with specific applications geared for, for that. Hopefully it's not all just going to be like little casino games and stuff like that. Maybe there's, there's something more, more social fi, something else. We'll see. Any, any decent questions here?
01:10:18.926 - 01:10:25.774, Speaker B: Yeah, most are airdrop related. I see one here. Next area of growth for the protocol. Very broad question from David Nurse.
01:10:25.894 - 01:10:52.634, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think the way that we think about the world is largely just we want to create the lowest level primitive with the highest possible utility. Right? Like that's the thing that we're trying to make. And so first we create this sort of like send function. Over the last 18 months, I think we were 97% of all interledger transfers. So just like extremely dominant takeaway, remove all of the Sybil. Now we're at 64,000 today. I think it's 64,000.
01:10:52.634 - 01:11:19.492, Speaker C: I think wormholes somewhere around like 5500. Axlr is like 4000 a day. CCIP is like single digit hundreds, I think. And so you're talking, still call it 80, 85% of like overall market share of what's being done. So that market, we think has been not fully saturated because new applications and use cases are going to sort of arrive naturally. But it's like we have a very hard time to force the market to like send more messages across chain. Right.
01:11:19.492 - 01:12:01.484, Speaker C: It's like, not something we can catalyze. We can help people build cool things. We can help big protocols move over onto it. And so a lot of the time we spend thinking about, like, how do you actually use the same primitive set, all the stack that we built and extend what the protocol can do? And we have just a lot of really cool primitives in my mind, like, really, really, really cool that will be rolling out kind of over the next six months or so. We've been working on a ton of stuff, but it's always through that lens of the lowest level possible primitive with maximum utility or maximum expressiveness. So almost everything we build is through that lens versus what is the next new application we can build, or how do we, we do this consumer thing? It's almost always at the primitive level.
01:12:01.604 - 01:12:12.876, Speaker A: Yeah. There's another user asking about your AI bags. I mean, you have an AI background and you're in crypto. Like, what do you make of the AI crypto space? Is it, you know, just agents, or does anything else make sense? Like, how are you seeing that space?
01:12:13.020 - 01:12:30.514, Speaker C: Yeah, I have no AI crypto bags, but I have, like, actual AI bags. So I've written a couple of seed checks in AI companies that are just, like, crushed into our crushing. And I just, like, actually very strongly believe in particularly. One of them is just amazing. Amazing, kid, amazing. They've just.
01:12:30.934 - 01:12:40.942, Speaker A: What's, what's. What's, like, accessible to people. Like, is there any crypto AI thing that makes sense? Or is it just pure AI? Like, I've been a huge.
01:12:41.078 - 01:13:01.144, Speaker C: Despite being in crypto for a very long time and AI for ten years now as well. Right? So I've spent, like, more than a decade in both. I've been a huge crypto and AI bear for a long time. And that because everyone was saying, like, everyone was like, all of the data is going to live on chain. It's like, data, like, storage is like the single thing the blockchain is aware. We're not putting petabytes of data on the block. It's not happening.
01:13:01.144 - 01:13:51.732, Speaker C: And then it was like, other models will launch in this thing. The area that I actually think is interesting and can have real legs is just a world of autonomous agents. The more that you have an agent integrated into your life that needs to do something, it will need to negotiate or pay or settle on your behalf. And there's just no way you're getting all of these agents onto, like, traditional banking rails easily. Like, crypto is as a payment mechanism and as a rails mechanism resettlement between agents is like the perfect use case. I think between there and then, cryptographically proving like, how content was generated is another thing that, like, could be interesting in the world of deepfakes and like, AI impersonation. But I think more than anything, multi agent domain of me wanting to do something, uh, it needing to go and interact with hyper specialized agents and settle and pay there.
01:13:51.788 - 01:13:58.884, Speaker A: Um, and so I think, like, uh, renting out other people's agents, like somebody does a really good agent, you know, you want to rent out their AI girlfriend or something, like, how about some?
01:13:58.924 - 01:14:28.494, Speaker C: Yeah, I think effectively, effectively the same thing of likely you will, you know, you'll, you'll have something, who you want something, and your agent will go out and get that thing or settle that thing on your behalf, whether you want to book a vacation or whether you want to do X or Y or z. I think it ultimately becomes in those agents that are hyper specialized and good need to be able to exchange value with other agents. It's not going to be you doing it most of the time.
01:14:29.034 - 01:14:33.454, Speaker A: Yeah. Somebody said, who is the thinker you respect the most?
01:14:34.154 - 01:14:35.338, Speaker B: That's a great question.
01:14:35.466 - 01:15:06.758, Speaker C: Yeah, interesting. All right. I grew up kind of with like a chip on my shoulder and just like, have no heroes, everybody sucks. And you can kind of just, if I put enough time and effort into something, I can get good at it. So I really have, broadly, I've met a lot of people that I think are amazing. And generally we're always just like, I don't see super disillusioned, but I'm just like, they're not as amazing as I thought they were. They're just somebody who was like very narrowly focused at this thing and spent a bunch of time and got good and like, that's amazing.
01:15:06.758 - 01:16:07.776, Speaker C: People I enjoy conversations with, I spent a bunch of time kind of recently with, with Noam Brown, from OpenAI, with demis, from DeepMind, with Eric from magic, with all, with all these, like, people in AI who I really respect a lot. I think on the crypto side, it's like everybody who just builds super principally, right? I think we try to model ourselves and how we like what we actually build, ignore what we say, what anyone says, like, what actually gets built after the Vitaliks of the world, after the Hayden's, it's just like anybody who has actually put what they say, because a lot of people will say they have these principles and they have this alignments, and then they're like upgradable contracts and censorship and like all this other stuff in there, you're like, that's completely different than what you're telling the world. But I think the people who actually. It's hard. It's hard to ship something that you can just, like, never change, especially something that's going to have billions or tens of billions of dollars in it. Like, in Uniswap's case. Right? Like, it would have been so easy for them to just be like, if there's a bug, we'll just be able to patch it.
01:16:07.776 - 01:16:38.114, Speaker C: Like, we'll have this little surface of upgradability. It's hard to ship perfect code. It's hard to do that. And I think anybody who really, really adheres to those principles above all else, I'll say, is somebody who I like respect deeply versus, like, I guess, thinkers. Thinkers that I love, if it's the best thinkers. I honestly think my co founder, Ryan, our chief architect, Isaac, the single two most brilliant engineers in a world of a lot of really smart people I've spent time with that I've ever met, and I love them both. Yeah.
01:16:39.134 - 01:16:49.114, Speaker A: Awesome. Any other questions, Taiki or Justin that you guys liked a lot, or should we move to the poll results, which I've seen, I'm not very happy about being last.
01:16:49.454 - 01:17:00.594, Speaker B: I think we can move to the poll results. I think Brian maybe, I don't know, if you had a little an army, me come out and vote in support of you in exchange for some tokens, but Brian dominated at 40.
01:17:01.654 - 01:17:03.754, Speaker D: You got cc two voting for him.
01:17:05.014 - 01:17:06.234, Speaker B: Congratulations.
01:17:07.734 - 01:17:08.794, Speaker D: Give us a dance.
01:17:12.254 - 01:17:27.912, Speaker A: Good job. I mean, Brian, it's been a great episode. I think you, you were a steady lad indeed. You kind of fell in perfectly into the show. So please, everybody, like and subscribe. We hope you enjoyed it. We will hopefully see you with Vicki next week.
01:17:27.912 - 01:17:34.792, Speaker A: And, you know, the ETF flows hopefully begin soon, so see everybody soon. Take care.
01:17:34.808 - 01:17:35.936, Speaker C: Thank you so much.
01:17:36.080 - 01:17:36.464, Speaker B: Thank you.
