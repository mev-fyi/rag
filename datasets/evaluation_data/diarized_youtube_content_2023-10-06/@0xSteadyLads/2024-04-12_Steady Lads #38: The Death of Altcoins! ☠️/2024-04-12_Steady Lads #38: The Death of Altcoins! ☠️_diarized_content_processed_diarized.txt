00:00:18.760 - 00:00:27.494, Speaker A: Welcome to another live episode of Steadylads. I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to get used to the live thing and I'm enjoying it. It's. It's fine.
00:00:27.874 - 00:00:29.774, Speaker B: I like interaction with the chat.
00:00:30.834 - 00:00:52.254, Speaker A: You never know where things are going to go. Thanks for joining us in the chat. I think we have a couple hundred people already. They're trying to liquidate Vicki. We'll see about that. But please, please like and subscribe. Let's get that out the way so we can dig in, guys.
00:00:52.254 - 00:00:57.554, Speaker A: It's a little bit of red at the moment. I am starting to think that.
00:00:58.414 - 00:00:59.794, Speaker B: Should we run the intro first?
00:01:00.254 - 00:01:02.554, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's run the intro. Important.
00:01:03.214 - 00:01:04.754, Speaker C: All right, let's run it back.
00:01:28.334 - 00:01:50.314, Speaker A: Episode 38. Shall we call this one the death of the altcoins? Maybe. I don't know. It seems like even though bitcoin is holding up for the first time, we might be seeing signs of this oversupply of altcoins. Thank you. You've been kind of expecting this for a while. You've been probably anticipating something like this.
00:01:51.974 - 00:02:20.194, Speaker D: Yeah, I think a while back, I posted a chart showing altcoin emissions and how they were emitting around $250 million a day of supply. And the point of that post was to hint to the market that it seemed like it was about time to start putting on the long bitcoin short altcoin trademark. It's been sort of printing in the past two weeks.
00:02:21.334 - 00:02:39.914, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's get some of the charts up. Taiki, maybe. I think we had some of the heavy emitters. So we have arbitrum. Yeah, I think maybe like the arbitrum BTC chart. I don't know if you can get something like that, but I've been looking at some of the BTC charts.
00:02:39.914 - 00:03:05.792, Speaker A: They. Oh, man. Okay, so this is where you start getting caught up into the VC unlocked game. It's not in the first year, but once they start, it's monthly. It's big. Everyone's up. Infinite arbitrum is obviously very good tech.
00:03:05.792 - 00:03:30.224, Speaker A: I think nobody denies that they're doing very well. They're the leading l two by far. Right TVL wise, activity wise. But it's not a new coin. It's not a low float coin anymore. And I guess there's nothing super exciting or new right now. I mean, there's orbit chains, I guess, which could be interesting.
00:03:30.224 - 00:03:49.244, Speaker A: But this is why I've been staying away from buying coins that are, as techie said, about to start experiencing very, very heavy sales. Taiki have you, has the mid curve avoided this or where have you been on these kind of alts?
00:03:50.304 - 00:04:15.812, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm not really bullish. L two tokens. To be honest, I think EIP 4844 will sell the news. I don't think it's as competitive as l two s aren't as competitive as Solana in terms of how fast it is and how cheap it is. And even, I guess, l two s, I use other Celestia or eigenva. Much cheaper than just arbitrum. I'm just, you know, I'm just mid curving.
00:04:15.812 - 00:04:39.350, Speaker B: I'm still sticking tia, still sticking dime, still staking matic, just staking these cooked coins that are. People are dumping on me. And I'm loving it. I'm loving it. You know, I'm just in my own lane. This is waiting for the airdrops to hit, you know, just patient, steady Eddie and, you know, like, just stick to a plan. You know, like, I had a plan, I'm sticking to it, and I'm not really that stressed.
00:04:39.382 - 00:04:50.622, Speaker A: All right. Through thick and thin. Justin, have you been, have you been trying to position yourself around some of these altcoins, or do you just take a longer, longer term view, like tyke?
00:04:50.798 - 00:05:25.194, Speaker C: Yeah, longer term view, like Tyke. I mean, I like some of the new innovative stuff, like Monad. Throw a cough in there for the Monad team. I'm still recovering from the Monad cough. I do kind of wonder, like, what do you guys think? Where did, where do we end up? So our BTC is down. Only RBSD is clearly getting sold off. Where does that lead us? Like, is there going to be some floor fair value where this token ends up getting bought up? Or do these things just basically bleed to zero? And does that end up killing the project? Or does it, does the token price decorate from the project success? What are your guys thoughts there?
00:05:27.334 - 00:05:55.572, Speaker A: Well, every project has different backers and different entry points. And I think some of these, you know, you look at optimism, it's another pretty awful chart at the moment. But they do have, you know, a 16 z plowing money in. There's two main sources of money, and I've been saying this for a long time. One is the retail money. The other one is the institutional money. And the institutional money comes in either through large VC fundraisers.
00:05:55.572 - 00:06:12.220, Speaker A: And everyone's fundraising right now, it's like, you know, all the big guys polychains everybody else down. It's fundraising. So that money needs to get deployed and that sort of sustains the economy. Now we have the BTC inflows. So those are. Those seem to be, like, actually quite healthy. I don't know.
00:06:12.220 - 00:06:15.264, Speaker A: Think you. Are they still healthy? They look healthy to me.
00:06:16.924 - 00:06:32.424, Speaker D: You know, they're okay. They're below their averages. But, you know, it's averaged 250 a day in March, and now it's closer to maybe 100, but it's still, you know, showing positive grayscales. Slowed down a bit.
00:06:33.604 - 00:06:38.132, Speaker A: Yeah. And then you have, like, you know, the pure retail coins.
00:06:38.268 - 00:06:38.740, Speaker B: There's.
00:06:38.812 - 00:07:12.656, Speaker A: There's no institutional bid coming. It's only an attention game. I feel like those ones are the ones where the rotation is going to hit the hardest as attention rotates and unlocks happen. We did have, for example. I don't want to get much hate about the bitten sir situation. I know Eric Wall tried to step into that, and it was a wild one, but we had a binance listing for one of the most hyped coins of the year. And even though we had the insider pump where for the hours before.
00:07:12.656 - 00:07:59.294, Speaker A: Maybe we can bring up Tao chart, but unfortunately, it got kind of sold into pretty hard, so it didn't seem to have a sustainable bid. Maybe we can get like a. Yeah, I mean, you can see that massive green candle there yesterday all the way. All the way reverted and kind of like skirting with the lows. So it does go to show that the amount of demand is being met with just so much supply. New coins unlocks of existing coins, and the only way it's going to stop is either new demand or the supply slowing down. I don't see supply slowing down.
00:07:59.294 - 00:08:02.254, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's kind of like the meme.
00:08:02.294 - 00:08:32.580, Speaker B: Justin, if you can share my screen, it's like Lido. The price is basically flat, but if you like the market cap, it's up only. So maybe this is the fate for a lot of these VC coins where, you know, when it first launches, it pumps, because, oh, my God, like, FTB is a meme. And then, you know, six months. Six months into the project, people start to think to themselves, oh, like, in six months, there's gonna be unlocks. And then they look at things like this and, yeah, they're not that great.
00:08:32.772 - 00:08:57.120, Speaker C: I'm quite hopeful that, like, in the future going forward, people realize that FTV is truly all that matters. But there are some things you can do to adjust that calculation. Like, if there's a 40% treasury that is actually controlled by token holders, you can sort of subtract that out or modify your calculations. But the people that just look at market cap, I've been saying this for years. It's like, you're surely destined for depression if that's, like, what you're basing your trade on.
00:08:57.232 - 00:08:57.616, Speaker A: Thicky.
00:08:57.640 - 00:09:06.644, Speaker C: I remember on a space you did, you basically said, like, price is FDV. That's truly all that matters. When you're betting on price, you're literally just betting on FTV.
00:09:07.234 - 00:09:07.954, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely.
00:09:07.994 - 00:09:08.186, Speaker B: Definitely.
00:09:08.210 - 00:09:29.494, Speaker D: In the longer term, for sure. I'm curious, Jordy, like, you know, having seen multiple cycles, everyone has sort of like, you know, been asking on Twitter, like, when is alt season coming? Like, you know, usually bitcoin dominance rises to the highs and then it all, everyone rotates to alts. Like, everyone's expecting that. Like, why don't you think that's come around yet, this cycle?
00:09:31.434 - 00:09:48.714, Speaker A: I think it has come around. I think it's already at the peak. Like, we had the peak of altcoins. I don't know what people expected more than, like, Joe Bowden and, you know, whatever dogs with hats were going to multi billions. That that's alt teasen. Like, that's what it is. It's been happening.
00:09:48.714 - 00:10:04.870, Speaker A: It happened. You know, is it always going to be the same litecoin? I mean, even bitcoin cash had an interesting pump. I think it went up to 700 or something. Yeah, it's quite a big multiple.
00:10:05.022 - 00:10:10.354, Speaker D: Yeah, it's like 21 billion at some point. Bitcoin cash, no one uses it.
00:10:10.734 - 00:10:15.086, Speaker A: Yeah, it's amazing. House. Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.
00:10:15.110 - 00:10:54.212, Speaker C: Just, I was gonna say, I think to Jordy's point, like, we really have had this all season, but just not in the way people expect. Like, people were expecting the same alt season to repeat itself. Where we have, like, these defi coins ETH going up. Like, these notable legacy l ones going up. But in reality, like, the altcoin pump has happened in unexpected places, like in Solana, in meme coins, et cetera. And some of the legacy stuff like Cardano, which I thought would pump did not really go up in the end, but, like, if you just scroll through coingecko, you can still see that, like, a lot of this stuff is vaporware and is trading at insane market caps and fdvs. And so I really do feel like we have had that all season.
00:10:54.212 - 00:10:56.976, Speaker C: Um, yeah, let's.
00:10:57.000 - 00:11:12.004, Speaker A: Let's zoom in a little bit. Can we zoom in a little bit here? There is, there are some interesting ones. Uh, one that has been doing phenomenally well is tawn. Um, it is a new entrant in the top ten. It has surpassed Charles Hodgkinson yeah.
00:11:13.864 - 00:11:15.364, Speaker C: Friend of the show a lot.
00:11:18.064 - 00:11:36.794, Speaker A: Look at that. 30% on the week while everything else, you know, not doing amazing. That's interesting. Goes to show that distribution is starting to filter through, potentially. The other interesting stuff, there's not that many new good coins. I mean, look at this. Like Cardano.
00:11:36.794 - 00:11:50.270, Speaker A: We have bitcoin, cash, Polkadot. These are all kind of not very active ecosystems, I think it's fair to say. And they're still in that top 15. I had one question around litecoin. Yeah, yeah.
00:11:50.302 - 00:12:27.604, Speaker B: Like, obviously, number 23, we see uniswap down 20% ish. We had the SEC news where they sent uni, like, the wells notice. I mean, we heard about this news last year. Like, last March, Lido got a Wells notice. And, I mean, I guess Lido hasn't done that well, but it seems like the alt market didn't really care in the short term. The entire market nuked. Do you think the SEC news is bearish alts potentially because potential regulatory headwinds, or do you think that this is something that the market will overlook, similar to how the market overlooked the Leidos from 1213 months ago?
00:12:28.264 - 00:12:38.084, Speaker C: I actually think it's quite bullish, personally. I remember when Brian Armstrong, when Coinbase decided they had to fight this, they basically said, well, the SEC wants to cannibalize.
00:12:41.784 - 00:12:45.160, Speaker A: Uh oh. The cabal got him. The cabal got Justin justice.
00:12:45.272 - 00:12:49.084, Speaker B: I know. As he say, the uniswap lawyers. D. Dawson.
00:12:52.624 - 00:13:26.704, Speaker A: I mean, do you guys think it matters if a protocol is more or less exposed? Because we. We have, you know, us based protocols that are in Defi, like Uniswap, that are probably similar, and they're probably getting scared, and then we have those that are less, you know, less close to the fire, and potentially they're not worried about this type of news. Is there any potential differentiation coming between, you know, something like a dogecoin and something that is, you know, very similar to Uniswap?
00:13:27.924 - 00:13:40.114, Speaker D: Yeah, I think we've seen a lot of that play out in alts is like, you know, those legacy ones that aren't securities, have gotten bids. You know, the doge, litecoin, bch have all been trading pretty. Pretty, you know, strongly.
00:13:42.574 - 00:13:42.862, Speaker A: So.
00:13:42.878 - 00:13:46.194, Speaker D: Yeah, I think anything was, like, actual. What's up?
00:13:46.534 - 00:13:56.630, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I was just saying, like, doge is really doing. Like, doge is super strong right now. So maybe it just means that people would rather buy meme coins over governance tokens.
00:13:56.782 - 00:13:57.638, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:13:57.766 - 00:14:00.874, Speaker D: I think they're buying Doge also for 420.
00:14:01.764 - 00:14:02.664, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:14:03.684 - 00:14:04.944, Speaker D: Going on right now.
00:14:05.444 - 00:14:08.824, Speaker A: I'm fundamental analysis.
00:14:10.884 - 00:14:38.692, Speaker C: I see some chats, some comments that they got me. My Internet just went down. I had to tether, but I'm not sure where I cut off there. But I was saying, I think the uni situation is actually quite bullish. Like when you put a very well funded company into a position where they have no choice but to fight this. Like, as I was saying before, when Coinbase decided they had to fight this in court, you know, the SEC said list bitcoin and basically that's it. Maybe a few other coins and cannibalize your whole business or fight this.
00:14:38.692 - 00:14:51.304, Speaker C: They have no choice but to fight this. And I think the case is pretty strong. I think the case for uniswap is. I mean, they've got the strongest case in all of Defi. And so, like, if. If someone's going to do this, it. It's great that it's them and someone has to do this.
00:14:51.304 - 00:15:10.514, Speaker C: I also think just from an attention perspective, like having this in the news cycle, having this being something to rally behind is generally bullish as well. And I think Uniswap has the capital to defend this, just like Ripple did. And so, personally, I'm excited by it, I'm energized by it. And I think hopefully it could lead to some clarity.
00:15:12.414 - 00:15:31.144, Speaker A: That's the key thing. I think eventually getting some clarity would be amazing. Longer term. Yeah. Guys, I'm going through the list of tokens and there's some that haven't hit these price levels, you know, in many months. I'm just kind of, like, surprised to see some of these numbers.
00:15:31.964 - 00:15:32.388, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:32.436 - 00:15:44.184, Speaker A: Applause is back at eleven. It was like 19 the other day. And arbitrum 130. Look. Look at this. Like dog with hats. Back to $3.
00:15:45.844 - 00:15:47.584, Speaker B: The ketamine guy was the top.
00:15:49.644 - 00:16:05.236, Speaker A: Yeah, I got some pushback on that. I called the top there. I was told that there is superior alpha than. Than just waiting for ketamine. But we'll see. There's some people still kind of hoping for a double pump there. And it wouldn't surprise me.
00:16:05.236 - 00:16:07.784, Speaker A: People can forget and move on.
00:16:12.084 - 00:16:33.864, Speaker B: The dickey thesis is playing out where, I mean, these narratives are super reflexive, right? It's like if price nukes and the narrative is so much supply, then, you know, it can just be this self fulfilling cycle of people just don't want to own these coins. So we'll see how the market goes. I mean, I don't think we've, like, top topped, but maybe we just go sideways, which I think is like, fine.
00:16:35.404 - 00:16:43.744, Speaker A: Let'S want to check. Oh, okay. Gonna be a longer market. I mean, I'm seeing a little cope here.
00:16:45.844 - 00:16:46.584, Speaker C: Really.
00:16:51.464 - 00:17:17.854, Speaker A: I think we might see a longer market, and I think it's good. I've been saying this for a while. We were looking at each other about a month ago and asking, where are we in the cycle? Because on the one end, it feels like we're very early in the bitcoin adoption. The ETF flows will continue for the next 18 months. That's a huge tailwind. On the other end, we have incredible excesses in the alt market. So this is kind of what I've expected.
00:17:17.854 - 00:17:48.574, Speaker A: Alts cool down, but BTC sort of stays strong. When we get that next push to 80k, alts will just do the same thing all over again. Like, history will repeat and then it'll, it'll cool off. We'll go to 90k, we'll get the next pump. But if you're playing it right, you will be selling tops. So every time, you know, I'll take profit, wait for the next one, rinse and repeat. Does that, what does that sound like? Picky?
00:17:49.914 - 00:17:52.894, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's how it plays out as well.
00:17:54.154 - 00:18:36.678, Speaker C: I've also been thinking about how maybe the reason we're not seeing the returns on alts that we've seen before is that, like, a lot of the edge is eked out much sooner or by different parties. So, like, when a team raises at a 300 million, at a 1 billion, 2 billion, whatever it is valuation, that value is effectively captured in some ways by the company, by the team, and then also by the investors. And then when the project is launched, like, there's actually no one that wants to buy these things, right? It's all sort of like insider selling. There's like very little retail adoption. Like, the pool of buyers is much smaller than it used to, especially when it comes to, like, the larger capital sizes. I'm curious if you guys have thought about that at all. Just that these systems are much more efficient.
00:18:36.678 - 00:18:52.074, Speaker C: Like, if we know that this new l one L two is going to launch, and it presumably will launch a one to $10 billion, just wide range ftv, that edge is actually eked out much sooner and it gives the market a lot less upside and that's why we see fewer or smaller returns.
00:18:52.894 - 00:19:34.428, Speaker B: Yeah, I've seen this, I guess, frustration from people on CT where it seems like a lot of the price discovery is happening to private markets. So when the token actually goes live, there's like, what the fuck do you do? Um. So maybe that does drive people into meme coins. Um, I think that's a possibility. You know. Um, it's obviously, you know, it's reflexive and it kind of depends on, like, what the market does and price leads the narrative. Um, but if doge just keeps outperforming VTC, you know, as it has done in previous cycles, then maybe the use case for crypto is speculation and people don't want to buy, like, centralized exchange VC coins.
00:19:34.428 - 00:19:52.924, Speaker B: Um, definitely like a market that everyone needs to think about or at least think about adapting to. Um, because that's not like, as a mid curve. That's not really like the market environment I would excel, like, I would excel in. Uh, but yeah, like, maybe I do need some meme coin exposure. Um, try to get out the mid curve.
00:19:54.704 - 00:20:18.714, Speaker C: Personally, I think the meme coin situation is sort of drying up and dying out. Um, I don't know that that's the sense I have. I think we're going to be in this sort of lull for a few months where meme coins aren't hot. People are really cynical about defi coins like l two coins, and I think a lot of the value just continues to get captured by large l one coins and hyped up projects. And everyone gets cynical about everything else.
00:20:20.214 - 00:20:30.794, Speaker B: Even the comments section for the live chat is half the comments are people shilling meme coins. So it definitely feels like a lot of people are in the memes.
00:20:32.514 - 00:21:12.774, Speaker A: Yeah, it's hard to play the other coins. I was just in Hong Kong, there was all these like web three summit stuff going on. It left me with a little bit of the vibes that were a little bit toppy. The valuations I'm hearing from the project that they're getting multiple term sheets all at very high, private round valuations. It does feel like VC's are just trying to get funds out the door so they can try to raise new capital. The valuations are a little bit unattractive and there's so many projects that are doing the same thing. Here's the main thing.
00:21:12.774 - 00:21:39.584, Speaker A: We're having a lot of copycats, and anything successful will have like, a lot of people trying to just instantly encroach into that space. So there's a few categories. Like, one is like liquid restaking tokens. So we had ether five was the first one launch, first one at the gate. Multi billion valuation. We have several that are sort of trying to follow in that footstep. They're doing the whole points thing.
00:21:39.584 - 00:22:03.744, Speaker A: You can farm these points and then hopefully get some similar result. And then maybe it's some ratio of the TVL. I think people are not very sophisticated, and they're just looking at a TVL ratio. They'll say, like, okay, etherfi has 4 billion TVL. If something has 2 billion TVL, then it should trade at, you know, half the valuation.
00:22:04.164 - 00:22:09.384, Speaker C: Are you insulting me, Jordy? I think that's been my thesis for a lot of different coins we've talked about offline.
00:22:10.724 - 00:22:20.822, Speaker A: I mean, it works. It works. It works well. You know, right when the market's friendly, I started to feel that testosterone levels are going up.
00:22:20.998 - 00:22:22.274, Speaker B: Testosterone?
00:22:22.734 - 00:22:49.378, Speaker A: Yeah, like, just generally, like, the founders are getting aggressive. They need to fight for attention. There's people copying each other, and there's people in the same narrative lane. So we had a little bit of this before, right? We talked in the past. We had Monad was announcing and then say was the already existing token and that sort of parallel EvM path. And, you know, there was a little bit of back and forth. Now we have this drama.
00:22:49.378 - 00:23:24.004, Speaker A: We can maybe bring up some of the tweets between margin fi and solon, where it seems to be, like, an ongoing drama. I don't think, you know what? Maybe, you know, the Solana dramas a bit more, but between those two, it seems like there's something ongoing. And the TLDR seems to be that, you know, one of the key founders of Marginfi has resigned, seemingly because of difference of opinion on strategy and, like, launching a token or not launching a token.
00:23:28.864 - 00:24:01.614, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, after the SEC news, the Edgar, the founder, was like, yeah, maybe we shouldn't do a token. And this is after they've done points for over a year, and they had a billion dollars worth of TVL and whatnot. And then sat start was like, yeah, like, grow up. And then Edgar is like, you grow the fuck up, you dirt sack. And then a couple hours later, he, like, left the company. And ever since then, if you pull up the defi llama chart, Justin, I think TVL is down 40% for marginfi. Number five there.
00:24:01.614 - 00:24:08.214, Speaker B: I think it was, like, at a billion, and now it's at 500. So people are just getting. Getting the fuck out.
00:24:08.374 - 00:24:21.022, Speaker A: And I'm gonna find the solent tweet. But they tweeted that if you can, if. If you withdraw from marginfi and come to Soland, we will give you, like, you know, some points multiply or something, just trying to step on the grave.
00:24:21.078 - 00:24:22.234, Speaker B: And, like, really?
00:24:22.654 - 00:24:49.294, Speaker A: This is what I'm saying. Like, the testosterone's up the PVP is up. We're at this point where, you know, it's not just like all, all boats are gonna float and the water is gonna rise for everybody. We're at the point where the knives are coming out. There's going to be winners and losers. Unfortunately, aggressiveness pays off to a certain point. I think it can harm in the long term, but in the short term, it pays off.
00:24:49.294 - 00:25:00.514, Speaker A: And so talking to projects, talking to founders, I'm seeing the attitude start to get a little bit more PvP.
00:25:01.514 - 00:25:09.934, Speaker D: Yeah, this is like social phenomenon, right, Jordy? Like, when the pie stops growing, people stop three, three. And they start minus three. Minus three.
00:25:11.554 - 00:25:12.498, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:25:12.666 - 00:25:15.418, Speaker C: I also think, like, I'm not defending the margin.
00:25:15.466 - 00:25:15.650, Speaker B: Five.
00:25:15.682 - 00:25:45.278, Speaker C: Founder, never met him, don't know anything about him. But I will say, and like, Vicky and I have talked about this little baby, thick, he wants to chime in. There is a little bit of, like, I think having anons in the space makes things a little more tense in that it's, it's not a fair fight. Like, what, someone's an, a non. It's not really like a fair argument that can be had on Twitter. Right? Like, you're sort of like fighting against someone that has no reputational risk, right? Like it's just an avatar. They can change, they can create a new one at any time.
00:25:45.278 - 00:25:59.134, Speaker C: When you're like a founder, putting your reputation on the line, you know, your passion is within this project, and some random anon picture on Twitter is making fun of you and getting all of the engagement, it's tough. So, like, I get where they're coming from. But yeah.
00:26:02.274 - 00:26:42.068, Speaker A: People are asking the chat, are we saying we topped? I don't think we've talked, like, globally, we've talked locally, obviously. Like, you know, we're in, like, we were in a local top. If you look just a week back on where alts were, we're up so much, we're not going to get anywhere near there, you know, for at least, I don't know, a month or two. It feels like we do have large releases coming. You know, we've, we've talked about, you know, wormhole in the past. There's, there's quite a few large ones coming out soon that have announced Mainnet. We saw even Eigen layer, one of the really big ones announced Mainnet.
00:26:42.068 - 00:27:11.262, Speaker A: So Eigenva is live and there's no slashing right now for the next six months. But, you know, Avss are gearing up. We might get into abs season. That's the bullish narrative. If we get abs points and people actually care about this stuff and it gets super exciting. The most bearish thing in the world will be if eigen layer launches and it doesn't hit some insane valuation that people are expecting. That will be quite scary.
00:27:11.438 - 00:27:39.312, Speaker B: That would be really scary because I think Eigen layer is the biggest ETH narrative this cycle, um, aside from the ETF. But we don't, we don't really know the timing of that. So I think last episode, Thiki talked about the idea of this ETH topping when Eigen Lair comes out because, oh, like, we got the airdrop. Cool. But then Justin sun just unstakes and then, like, this sells half of his Ethan whatnot. There might be components of tax selling as well. I'm not really sure how to think about it.
00:27:39.312 - 00:27:50.994, Speaker B: Like, Vicki, maybe you've looked into historical analogs of maybe around early to mid April people start selling coins. Is that really a thing or is it just more of a narrative that happens whenever the markets go down?
00:27:51.154 - 00:28:15.304, Speaker D: I think it's an actual thing. We topped, like, you know, literally on 415 of last year. Bright after Chappelle upgrade. So, like, you know, there was like a confluence of sell the news events and then tax selling right at the same time. And like, we're getting a similar set up here with the having and tax selling into 415, 420 area. So we'll see if it plays out the same way. But it's looking like it's starting to.
00:28:15.724 - 00:28:22.972, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess even in 2021, we topped in April too. So I guess there is some confluence. And 2022 is down only.
00:28:23.148 - 00:28:35.244, Speaker C: Yeah, for the. Not for the non traders out there that aren't worried about like, even the multi month timeframe. What do you guys think? Like, you know, most people will always give you the advice, well, don't sell before the having. Just hold through it.
00:28:35.284 - 00:28:35.460, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:35.492 - 00:28:43.624, Speaker C: Relax. Hold for another six months year. Like, do you think that's still a viable strategy or are things just completely different just based on the timing of the cycle?
00:28:46.364 - 00:29:05.444, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's viable. I mean, it's on a week to week basis. Like, if you go to Twitter, people are always bojacking and complaining and the vibes are definitely deteriorating. The vibes are definitely deteriorating. But I mean, if you zoom out, just hodlers tend to win, so I think it's still the same.
00:29:09.424 - 00:29:29.684, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with what Thiki said before. I do think that potentially we will finally see the emergence of a BTC supercycle while everything sort of is going through mini cycles up and down and then hopefully ETH will join as soon as it gets an ETF. I've said before we need the ETF, Justin, so just bear with me. You did say that there was ETF.
00:29:29.764 - 00:29:48.104, Speaker C: And I won the bet. Vicky, you got to send me my ETH. Justinbram ETH is my ens. The Hong Kong ETF is going live on Monday for ethereum, so just send that at your earliest convenience, and we're all happy. Now, congratulations. In the chat that believed in me. Screw all the haters.
00:29:48.684 - 00:29:49.180, Speaker A: Move on.
00:29:49.212 - 00:29:52.664, Speaker B: Now pull up the EBTC chart.
00:29:54.184 - 00:29:59.504, Speaker C: I think the chart is not relevant. We got all the staking yield tike. What about the staking yield and the airdrops?
00:29:59.544 - 00:29:59.696, Speaker A: Right?
00:29:59.720 - 00:30:07.084, Speaker B: You're right, you're right, you're right. BDC is at 0.1 if you take into account the airdrops. Yeah, it's true, actually.
00:30:07.944 - 00:30:16.844, Speaker A: Yeah. All jokes aside, you know, the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar. So if people want an ETF in Hong Kong, it's equivalent to a US one, right?
00:30:20.244 - 00:30:21.144, Speaker B: Silence.
00:30:23.444 - 00:30:26.904, Speaker C: He doesn't know what to say. He knows I'm right.
00:30:28.084 - 00:30:32.464, Speaker D: Yeah, it's that I'm just babysitting my underwater positions right now.
00:30:33.484 - 00:30:38.424, Speaker C: What you're underwater in, or you want to wait till. You don't want to give too much? I mean, I was.
00:30:38.924 - 00:30:48.654, Speaker D: I was just short all since today, and now I'm just buying bitcoin against it. But I was trying to get, like, I was trying to buy more bitcoin to get a little net long, but a little underwater on it. Right now.
00:30:50.474 - 00:31:02.066, Speaker A: Let's. Let's talk about some specific alts. That'll be fun. I'll ask the chat. You know, let's get some questions on their favorite bags. We can go through them a little bit. I have to say that the one that the meta.
00:31:02.066 - 00:31:25.354, Speaker A: That I'm most kind of looking at right now is the multiple point stacking. You know, you can. There's certain ways now because all of it's nonsensical. The market doesn't make any sense. It's all just Tvl based. And who can get the biggest TVL? It's like a vanity metric, and the market is actually rewarding this vanity metric. So you can basically start like this.
00:31:25.354 - 00:31:42.026, Speaker A: You can take your ETH. Okay. And then you can stake it. My preference is meth, but you can stake it with, like, Lido, let's say. Okay, then you take that, and then you go to one of these guys like Renzo and kelp or whatever. You. You restake it.
00:31:42.026 - 00:32:22.916, Speaker A: Now you're getting the pearls. There's different names for each one. You got the shards and the pearls and the points. You take that now you can go to, even though it's already restricted to Eigen layer, you can go to, let's say, karak, and you can restake it there because it also takes it. And then you're getting the XP points. And at the end, you just sort of, you're stacking all these new tokens that, you know, if you want to convert them into ETH, it's going to take a while. And maybe it's not that simple, but theoretically, you're getting a bunch of valuable new future of France.
00:32:22.916 - 00:32:30.264, Speaker A: So that's quite an interesting. And a lot of people seem to be getting into this stuff. I mean, there's a lot of TVL flowing in.
00:32:31.084 - 00:32:52.164, Speaker C: Part of me wonders if, like, this is pennies in front of a steamroller. Like, if you're getting an extra ten to 15% by, like, restaking your restaked LSD coin. Like, is it really worth it, 10% over a year? But, like, it literally just takes one terrible event to lose 100% of your capital. I've, like, personally become extremely cautious about those things.
00:32:52.824 - 00:32:53.564, Speaker D: What?
00:32:54.184 - 00:32:56.896, Speaker A: There's no slashing? There's no slashing. No, no.
00:32:57.000 - 00:33:00.204, Speaker C: Like, just an exploit. Like, just an exploit. And you go to zero.
00:33:00.504 - 00:33:26.428, Speaker A: I mean, you don't even go to zero. Like, this is what I'm trying to tell you, man. These coins don't even have the ETH in them. Like, if somebody wants to flash them, the ETH is, like, eight layers in. So let's say, like, you know, the top layer, like, the croc gets exploited. That. That token, like the receipt token, which is, like the receipt token of the Lido Renzo, which then went, you want to get the ETH at the end? The hacker is not going to get it.
00:33:26.428 - 00:33:37.924, Speaker A: It's going to be, it's going to be like, the munchable thing. Yeah, like, it's gonna be like the north korean hacker, which is just like, okay, okay. Like, I give up. I'm not even gonna try to get this ETH. Like, you guys just keep it. Like, I'm going home.
00:33:38.624 - 00:34:05.584, Speaker B: I love that. Even. Even Karak. I mean, you can definitely tell that the vibes are deteriorating because if you pull up my screen, Justin, even Korok has, like, some drama because I think it's formerly the risk harbor team that did, like, the whole intern stink era. And then I think they sold some ust to fund this new project. And they raised like $48 million from VC's at a billion dollar valuation. And then people are pissed.
00:34:05.584 - 00:34:09.756, Speaker B: Obviously, no one cares if price is going up, but when price is going down, people are.
00:34:09.820 - 00:34:46.484, Speaker A: So this is exactly what I'm talking about. So this crypto yin, if you look there, it says he's a researcher at Blockcrunch. And then Justin Choi is like a big angel in Eigen Lair. And Eigen layer is like the competitor to Korok. And you kind of, like, I'm not saying, like, I'm not accusing anybody of like, you know, back bias or anything else, but you can, you can kind of like see all these links, like there's teams forming and, and it's just very PvP right now. And a lot of, a lot of the big VC's that missed Eigen layer, let's say, you know, they want to get avail, they want to get the next one. They want to have their chance.
00:34:46.484 - 00:35:15.084, Speaker A: That's the VC game that I've seen. I mean, you know, Celini does a lot of venture investments, but we don't have LP's, so we don't have to worry about explaining to somebody, like, why did you miss this? Why did you miss Eigen Lair? But from what, from what I talked to VC's, that's their obsession. Like, their job depends on being able to say, like, you know, we didn't miss the big one. We were actually, like in the big one. And right now there's a lot of people trying to, trying to catch on to like, alternatives.
00:35:15.664 - 00:35:23.724, Speaker B: Yeah, these evaluations are getting crazy. Like Monad 200 mil, Bearachain 100 mil, Korok 50 mil.
00:35:24.024 - 00:35:30.120, Speaker A: I mean, I guess there's so much money. Yeah, yeah.
00:35:30.192 - 00:35:40.930, Speaker B: But that's still, I know that still feels crazy because a year ago, I mean, I couldn't even imagine if they were raising this much or even like this, this unknown, correct thing, raising this.
00:35:40.962 - 00:36:05.234, Speaker C: Much, sort of what I was saying earlier. Like, it's actually not crazy if you think about it. Like, take the name of the project out of this. Like, if you just launch a new layer, one, that thing is going to be worth more than a billion. Like, it doesn't matter if it's live, it doesn't matter if it does anything. It just matters that there's a marketing page. I'm not saying that of any of the projects you had mentioned, but like, if you know that to be true, if you have, like, you know, if this project has some hype, they're building a new l one.
00:36:05.234 - 00:36:18.334, Speaker C: There's like an interesting community. There's a narrative attached, like, to. You should. Like, if you're like a vc, you should be bidding that up to, like, the highest valuation you think you can take. And I don't think 1 billion is at all out of the question there. Like, I think.
00:36:18.674 - 00:36:26.658, Speaker A: Jackson, Justin, are you saying that we should. We should do a steady lads l one and then airdrop to all the listeners? Give them all an airdrop.
00:36:26.826 - 00:36:29.466, Speaker C: I mean, I would a ticker be?
00:36:29.570 - 00:36:40.098, Speaker B: What would a ticker be, lads? That's pretty good steak lads. What type of air jobs would we give steak lads for?
00:36:40.186 - 00:36:44.334, Speaker C: Maybe we can use one of those services where you just, like, click one button and your l two deploys.
00:36:46.594 - 00:37:08.032, Speaker A: How about you can take your lads token and you can stake it on either, like, Jordy, Justin, Taiki, or thicky. You can choose which one to stake it. Oh, it's like a voting. Depending on. Yeah, depending on which one you stake it, you're gonna get, you know, either Celestia rewards if it's thank you or. Or some bitcoin rewards if it's thank you, who apparently is a maximalist now.
00:37:08.208 - 00:37:17.444, Speaker C: Man, this would be, like, an amazing bear market project. Like, I hope things cool off where, like, all of us, like, have nothing going on, like, in the middle of a bear market, and we just end up launching this thing.
00:37:18.824 - 00:37:19.844, Speaker D: Go to jail.
00:37:20.704 - 00:37:21.484, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:23.264 - 00:37:58.334, Speaker D: I mean, I do think, like, you know, like, there's news this week that paradigm raise another $850 million fund. So there clearly is money flowing into the space for altcoins. It's just for new altcoins. And, like Taiki said, like, the price discovery is happening in private markets and in public markets, the exit liquidity. And, like, you know, when something launches on binance, like, it. There's, like, no meat left for it to pump? Like, Ina was a huge exception. I was very impressed on how much Ina ran after its launch, but, like, so many other of these finance launch pools, launch pads just pump, like, 30% and then just get nuked.
00:37:59.274 - 00:38:17.814, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we can bring up the. The most recent one. So saga was the most recent. Just a few days ago, it tried to do the little pump, the little launch pool pump. But, yeah, it's been caught up into the. To the sudden altcoin death. Now.
00:38:20.814 - 00:38:22.222, Speaker B: If you go to the hourly.
00:38:22.358 - 00:38:30.414, Speaker A: Yeah, we need the hourly because. Because that fake. That first candle is like, the. You know, that's like the. That's the candy. Yeah.
00:38:30.574 - 00:38:31.314, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:32.614 - 00:38:49.202, Speaker C: Do you guys also agree with me that, like, every dollar that goes into a vc round is, like, a dollar taken out of the public markets in some ways. Like everyone that's investing in paradigm is doing so so that they don't have to buy coins in the public market. Like, no, no. You don't think so?
00:38:49.338 - 00:38:50.002, Speaker A: 100%.
00:38:50.058 - 00:39:15.604, Speaker C: This is like, if you have 10 million, you have a large family office and you have 10 million and you want to deploy to crypto, are you really going to be looking at like the public altcoins? Are you going to be doing like 70% trying to get into paradigms new round, maybe 20%, 25% BTC and 5% other stuff? Like if there were, if there were no funds, let's say, then everyone would have to fight in the public markets together.
00:39:17.744 - 00:39:58.410, Speaker A: No, I don't think, I don't think the capital that goes into funds like paradigm would ever hit. You know, it wouldn't go into like bitcoin cash or something like those guys, a lot of them, a lot of these family offices, because I talked to a bunch of them, they made their money, you know, either with a startup or doing venture themselves, like traditional venture web two stuff, web two tech, they're looking for bets that are similar to what they understand. That means they want a VC to just deploy into the category. They don't want to try to pick out, you know, some, some random coin. Guys, let's go through some of these tickers that came in the chat when I, when I asked for. I actually don't know most of them. I don't even know what, what is this stuff? So I thought, I'm like crypto native.
00:39:58.410 - 00:40:03.882, Speaker A: I don't, I don't know what this stuff is. Okay, let's go. Keycap much? Cat?
00:40:03.978 - 00:40:10.868, Speaker B: No, no. People are just trying to show their bags because they know that if we talk about it, it's going to pump or whatever. It's probably.
00:40:11.036 - 00:40:16.904, Speaker C: I don't think it will. I mean, yeah, we're just going to call it vaporware, but we're not Kobe level.
00:40:17.884 - 00:40:19.292, Speaker B: Yeah, we're not ansem.
00:40:19.468 - 00:40:21.788, Speaker A: I mean, some of the ones we're seeing, look, we'll go through.
00:40:21.836 - 00:40:39.244, Speaker C: So you guys know about D gen coin, though. That's actually a real, that's like an interesting project. There's a huge deed community around this D gen token that launched on base. It's at over 1 billion ftv. And they just launched a layer three. I think I talked about it a couple weeks ago. I think it's down like 50% with everything else.
00:40:39.244 - 00:40:45.424, Speaker C: But, you know, that's like an interesting one where they're trying to build out of meme coin status and convert into a real project.
00:40:47.164 - 00:40:48.464, Speaker B: Is that bearish, though?
00:40:49.804 - 00:40:53.704, Speaker C: I mean, it is down 50% since they launched the layer three, so probably.
00:40:56.044 - 00:40:57.484, Speaker B: Utility. No good.
00:40:57.524 - 00:41:19.296, Speaker A: We did have an interesting meme coin launch today. I don't know if you guys saw it, but foxy, which is the. The mascot for Linia, launched. Somehow it really surprised me. They got it launched on OKX and bybit on day one. We can bring up foxy, maybe we like an interesting one.
00:41:19.440 - 00:41:20.336, Speaker B: There was.
00:41:20.520 - 00:41:23.364, Speaker C: Is this foxy linea?
00:41:24.064 - 00:41:42.984, Speaker A: Yeah, it's trading at 200 mil. It was airdropped to, I think, like, bunch of metamask wallets. Like, if you use metamask snaps, I think you got one. Curious to see how this does. Definitely. Interesting, interesting project.
00:41:44.044 - 00:41:45.744, Speaker B: I totally forgot about linear.
00:41:46.964 - 00:41:50.224, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly like, what is it, a layer two?
00:41:50.524 - 00:41:52.100, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just an l two.
00:41:52.292 - 00:41:53.144, Speaker A: Okay.
00:41:53.724 - 00:41:54.824, Speaker B: Another one.
00:41:55.824 - 00:42:26.524, Speaker A: Yeah. Because I've been deep into the l two space, I can describe what the current status is. There's six or seven big ones that are in progress of points to get their token. So Linia is the one from consensus, and they have the distribution. They all have a story, they all have one thing going for them. Linia has the metamask wallet distribution. If you try to choose a network, linear will be at the top.
00:42:26.524 - 00:42:59.964, Speaker A: It's like ethereum, and then like Linea, it is a zk one. And, you know, obviously has. Has that backbone. You have scroll. Scroll is a zk l two. A bit more maybe tech focused, has a lot of ethereum alignment, so very ethereum aligned, has like all the, you know, uniswap, aave, all these kind of integrations. Just a very, very aligned zk one.
00:42:59.964 - 00:43:19.334, Speaker A: We have zksync, which is. Seems to be very close to potentially, you know, releasing their token. And we'll finally see how many Sisyphus sybils managed to get, get through and farm that. I know he's been farming it for a long time, so we'll see.
00:43:19.994 - 00:43:27.974, Speaker B: Yeah. Hugo in the chat says there are more l two s than users. Feels like that sometimes.
00:43:28.714 - 00:43:55.294, Speaker A: Yeah, we have mode. Mode is another one on the op stack that has gotten quite a large TvL, a lot of it from Renzo ETH. And I think Athena is doing something with them. Obviously, there's the ones coming later in the year, like the SVM ones, like eclipse, there's the movement labs ones. So there's a lot of l two s coming. They're all going to have to play this points game.
00:43:57.354 - 00:44:23.604, Speaker C: You know, what's interesting. Taki, to your point, there's not more l two s than users, but it is actually a fact that there are more l two s than there are useful apps that, like, people even use on a daily or weekly or even monthly basis. Like, Jordy, you said there's, like, what, nine major l two s? But if you actually think about how many apps or things you can do on chain, there's, like, less than nine different unique consumer applications you use on a monthly basis, which is quite sad.
00:44:26.544 - 00:44:54.994, Speaker A: I'm waiting for the day when, like, the applications will finally shine and they will be the ones that come through and, you know, maybe it'll happen. Ultimately, if you get a lot of attention with your app, you can potentially set the rules in terms of where you deploy and what the chain should give you. So that's something that I hope at some point, we stop just creating block space and then consolidate on the app.
00:44:55.774 - 00:45:17.284, Speaker C: Can we talk a little bit about Puff Jordy? I mean, Puff has been performing like crazy. We've talked about meme coins, like, getting destroyed, but since Puff launched, it launched at like, $0.09 or $0.08 or something like that. It's over $0.26. What do you think? What's the reason there? Just, I mean, the design that this is like a new narrative, a new way to approach meme coins. Do you think that's the key?
00:45:20.784 - 00:45:44.884, Speaker A: You know, it's. When you look at price, you always try to retroactively explain it in different ways. You know, with puff, it's just meant to be a very well thought out and good vibes project. And I think the community seems to be vibing with it. The discord has, I think, like, over 12,000 very active users right now. So it's a. It's building an active community.
00:45:44.884 - 00:45:50.676, Speaker A: I think ultimately having that type of community is. Is valuable. And we'll see.
00:45:50.740 - 00:45:55.120, Speaker B: Yeah, pull up the comment. The Chris saying Justin blazing.
00:45:55.192 - 00:45:55.920, Speaker C: Don't see that one.
00:45:55.992 - 00:46:15.184, Speaker A: Don't see that one. All right, we have. We have a que. We have. We have some question about BNB. BNB so strong throughout. I do have thoughts about BNB, and I'm impressed with BNB.
00:46:15.184 - 00:46:22.048, Speaker A: And, you know, BNB is the mafia. And it's a strong mafia. The mafia is strong.
00:46:22.216 - 00:46:22.920, Speaker B: Holy shit.
00:46:22.952 - 00:46:56.830, Speaker A: People thought that binance was going to get diluted. They thought that the market share, once Cz was having these issues, they thought, okay, everybody else is going to gang up and it's going to go to zero. Binance is recovered quite strongly on the market share, and they are dictating terms. They're being very aggressive. They are generating a lot of value for BNB holders with these constant launch pools. They're getting two 3% of significant projects. It feels like almost weekly.
00:46:56.830 - 00:47:22.828, Speaker A: They just announced omni next week, which is another large project that's coming. And they're getting, I think, again, like, two 3% of that. I have been holding BNB. I've been staking it on these launch pools. And every time I get a pretty decent, like, every week, I'm just getting. I am, like, selling most of the coins that I get on these launch pools. I don't have, like, any attachment to them for the most part.
00:47:22.828 - 00:47:44.894, Speaker A: And it's quite a significant return. And so I think the BNB price is a reflection of finances. I don't want to call it, like, tactics, but just. Just call it their strength. Their negotiation strength is very high. Yeah, it's what.
00:47:44.934 - 00:47:46.434, Speaker D: It's what ts should have been.
00:47:49.494 - 00:47:49.966, Speaker B: On that.
00:47:49.990 - 00:47:51.006, Speaker C: No, I mean, look at.
00:47:51.110 - 00:47:51.550, Speaker B: Look at.
00:47:51.582 - 00:48:08.314, Speaker C: This is Bnb ETH, which, I mean, ETH has not. It's not as though ETH has performed, but most alts have just perpetually bled to Ethan. ETH is obviously bled to bitcoin. And, I mean, look at this performance. And then if you contrast that with someone in the chat mentioned, we should pull this up. Like, look at bitcoin. Like, that's insane.
00:48:08.894 - 00:48:14.538, Speaker B: Like, yeah, the BNB USD is at all time highs almost. It's crazy. I thought that wouldn't happen.
00:48:14.706 - 00:48:18.698, Speaker A: Yeah, this. This looks like a murder. Oh, my God.
00:48:18.826 - 00:48:19.514, Speaker B: Um.
00:48:19.634 - 00:48:21.494, Speaker A: Okay, let's not look at that.
00:48:25.834 - 00:48:30.010, Speaker B: Garage in that one. Fuck. I bought garage bags.
00:48:30.202 - 00:48:32.054, Speaker A: Garage of painting buildings.
00:48:32.474 - 00:48:33.254, Speaker B: He's.
00:48:35.714 - 00:48:40.284, Speaker A: Guy. Yeah, I mean, let's see what other tickers.
00:48:41.544 - 00:48:47.604, Speaker B: How about this one? Can't diggy talk about how crypto traders are modern day pirates. Is that. Did you mention that somewhere?
00:48:48.064 - 00:48:52.776, Speaker D: Oh, no, I was just ranting in my chat. Am I muted? I'm muted.
00:48:52.800 - 00:48:53.724, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:48:55.224 - 00:48:56.684, Speaker D: We'll talk about this another time.
00:48:57.984 - 00:49:15.558, Speaker A: Okay. That's some secret stuff there. We have talks about political coins and the bowdoin. Coins. I mean, the Bowdoin thing was a well done meme as far as, like, drawings and changing letters. That seems to be the meta. Like, instead of with.
00:49:15.558 - 00:49:24.914, Speaker A: It's with. And then instead of Biden's bowdoin, you change a letter in the right place, and it's the kind of thing that just makes Justin chuckle. Then it means you're onto something.
00:49:26.294 - 00:49:45.506, Speaker C: Yeah, but I keep fumbling these things. I was so early in Bowdoin. It hurts. I also bought the tremp coin as per Jordi's strong recommendation, due to the tremp bowdoin pair. But I've not done well, at least on USD terms. I'd have to check in Bowdoin terms if I'm outperforming bowdoin.
00:49:45.530 - 00:49:55.774, Speaker A: At least does Tradingview. Let us do the bowdoin. Trump the trump. Bowden. They got him again.
00:49:56.154 - 00:49:58.854, Speaker B: Yeah, the SEC is getting to him.
00:50:00.554 - 00:50:02.826, Speaker C: Am I back? I can hear you guys.
00:50:02.850 - 00:50:03.170, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:03.242 - 00:50:03.934, Speaker A: Yes.
00:50:04.434 - 00:50:05.722, Speaker B: Yeah, we can hear you.
00:50:05.858 - 00:50:06.242, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:50:06.298 - 00:50:07.170, Speaker B: Just, like, choppy.
00:50:07.242 - 00:50:10.974, Speaker C: Uh, no training. View does not allow that, unfortunately.
00:50:11.874 - 00:50:13.854, Speaker D: Yeah, bowdoin kind of bounce hard.
00:50:14.354 - 00:50:15.134, Speaker A: Wow.
00:50:17.594 - 00:50:20.374, Speaker B: Let's see. Geo bowdoin.
00:50:23.974 - 00:50:35.174, Speaker A: The good thing about Bowdoin is it has a catalyst. Right? Like, it has a catalyst far into the future. It has this, like, November, November 4 catalyst. I don't know what happens after that.
00:50:35.294 - 00:50:45.614, Speaker B: That's some fundamental analysis. Should we do pastas? It's. I know Justin has to leave soon. Let's.
00:50:45.654 - 00:50:53.254, Speaker A: Let's start with some pastas. Um, pass of the week time. Justin, let's. Let's have you go first, maybe.
00:50:55.034 - 00:51:25.438, Speaker C: All right. I'm in love with mine. This thing, when I first saw this, cracked me up. I'm sure many of you guys have seen it, but I think it deserves a quick play for the chat. SBF coming out of prison in 2027. So hyped. And I think this one especially got me because I was thinking, this man really gave that up.
00:51:25.438 - 00:51:35.034, Speaker C: That was literally could have been his life. And he chose not to. Not to enjoy that, which is sad. But that. That possibly gave me a huge chuckle when I first saw it with Tarun.
00:51:37.094 - 00:51:38.714, Speaker D: Sam would have liked this.
00:51:39.374 - 00:51:40.214, Speaker B: Sam would have liked.
00:51:40.254 - 00:51:46.434, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. He was always doing those, like, little silly dances, right? Like, awkward.
00:51:46.514 - 00:51:46.770, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:46.802 - 00:51:49.330, Speaker C: Like, oh, yeah, the little hand hit thing.
00:51:49.482 - 00:51:50.254, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:51.994 - 00:51:53.174, Speaker B: He remembers.
00:51:56.594 - 00:51:57.374, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:52:00.034 - 00:52:02.534, Speaker A: All right, Vicki, do you have a pasta?
00:52:03.594 - 00:52:04.494, Speaker D: I do.
00:52:06.274 - 00:52:09.448, Speaker C: Are you? Absurdity post.
00:52:09.616 - 00:52:10.056, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:10.120 - 00:52:13.644, Speaker D: Yeah, I saw this on my twitter, scrolling down.
00:52:15.224 - 00:52:15.600, Speaker A: Nice.
00:52:15.632 - 00:52:42.940, Speaker D: I'll read it. It says, the last six months have been life altering. I dropped out of college at 19. Interesting how pointless it was with a laptop and a goal. I've not only bought my first two cars in cash, but ran up a multiple wallet multiple times with more money than most people have seen their life. And we're just getting started, and it keeps going on, but it's like, the moment I saw that, I was like, zelix. Like, I told my partner to sell all our meme coins because this is.
00:52:42.972 - 00:53:01.974, Speaker C: The top thick you know what's hilarious is, like, this is my image of you, like, to the extreme. Like, just based on, like, what I know about your background, like, leaving your, like, very impressive background behind, like, with a laptop and a dream and just, like, trading this other utter shit and then, like, living this off, awesome lifestyle.
00:53:03.314 - 00:53:04.346, Speaker D: Yeah, that's funny.
00:53:04.370 - 00:53:26.454, Speaker B: I mean, I don't want to dunk on the guy because, I mean, you know, he seems like he's, you know, feeling it, feeling himself, but, you know, like, you know, probably shouldn't drop. Shouldn't be dropping out of college to trade meme coins. I mean, I don't know. I follow your dreams, you know, follow your dreams. But, yeah, that was.
00:53:26.954 - 00:53:36.214, Speaker A: I saw somebody, like, quote, tweeting that and saying, like, this guy is, like, showing off two toyotas, like. Like, what's going on? This is the flex that we're seeing now.
00:53:36.514 - 00:53:41.494, Speaker B: Hey, don't disrespect the japanese car companies. Yeah, that's.
00:53:44.434 - 00:53:44.874, Speaker A: I got.
00:53:44.914 - 00:53:49.250, Speaker B: I got. I got Jordy to bow. Holy crazy.
00:53:49.322 - 00:53:52.054, Speaker D: I mean, yeah, good.
00:53:52.614 - 00:54:30.404, Speaker A: I was just talking to, like, various protocols this week, and the ones, there's some that, like, they just suddenly tell me, like, you know, by the way we've been looking at the ips of our users, and, like, half of them are from Japan. I'm like, what? What's going on with Japan? And then I put it together, and the products that, they always seem to be the same. It's always these, like, vault kind of products where you put your money in and then you just leave it, and then they, you know, they maybe, like, do something, generate a little bit of yield, but it seems. Is there something in the japanese culture where they really just, like, these, like, savings products, like a vault product? I don't know what it is, but that seems to be really, really big in Japan.
00:54:30.744 - 00:54:39.524, Speaker B: I feel like it's as a VPN, and maybe the Japanese, so maybe they're, like, flooding to you.
00:54:42.984 - 00:54:52.016, Speaker A: Like, thank you. Are you, like, pure Japanese, or you, like, you're, like, americanized? You're, like, an americanized Japanese? You don't know, like, the vault culture.
00:54:52.200 - 00:55:08.484, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I was born in Japan. I'm a us citizen, but I was the president of my japanese club at Berkeley, so I'm still, like, pretty Japanese, but I wouldn't want to work in Japan. I think the culture there is, like, not that great personally. You know, it doesn't really suit my.
00:55:09.344 - 00:55:31.472, Speaker A: Values, if any, like, proud Japanese in the chat can tell us why the vaults are becoming the national, the new national pastime. Please let us know in the chat. I really want to find out what's going on. I know, like, there's a few things, like, if you're in Asia and you live, like, in Asia, like me, you start to hear, like, all the little things. Like, you know, the Vietnamese love their meme coins. They love the meme coins. They're like, crushing it.
00:55:31.472 - 00:55:50.560, Speaker A: Probably because they love the meme coins. You know, Koreans, they don't like the on chain stuff so much. They, you know, they kind of like the brand name stuff maybe like the things that kind of catch on there. There's like different. Different vibes. Obviously. The Chinese love the bitcoin stuff.
00:55:50.672 - 00:55:52.720, Speaker B: Yeah, bitcoin, l two s and stuff. Yeah.
00:55:52.872 - 00:56:09.844, Speaker A: You guys are all, like, in the west. Do you guys know about the whole bitcoin? Like Altoo and bitcoin restaking and bitcoin? It's crazy. Like, over here, like, that's all the stuff that's like fundraising out in the east.
00:56:10.974 - 00:56:19.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they. I think Merlin or something has like 2 billion in TVL. It's like a bitcoin l two. I don't even know much about it, but that's crazy.
00:56:20.054 - 00:56:28.834, Speaker A: There's like ten of them. There's like a lot of those things. Let's get a. Let's get a taiki pasta.
00:56:29.334 - 00:56:51.944, Speaker B: All right, so this is the one. Posted by friendtech with Racer and you know, there's been hype around Frontech. The keys are pumping. Seems like the points or the token is going to come out relatively soon. And then just frontech, Racer unhinged, says, pick a fucking chain already, Frank. Because Frank, I guess, is. Frank is the founder of D Gods.
00:56:51.944 - 00:57:09.936, Speaker B: They were the main project in Solana. They left Solana. They're trying to come back. I don't even know what they're doing. But I just thought this is hilarious because we have, I guess these project account just like cussing other people or just trolling Frank, this, this is, this.
00:57:09.960 - 00:57:39.866, Speaker A: Is the PvP thing again, right? Like both of Frentech and D gods are something that had their moment in the sun. Like, you know, for a while, like they were the hot shit. You know, things kind of moved on and then they're trying to make a comeback. I don't know if any of you guys have been using fronttech again or. I saw that they try to get Andrew Kang and a couple people on there and I think Anson was making some money again on, on the fees. They're trying to kind of run it back with, with like the token maybe. Yeah, I know.
00:57:39.890 - 00:58:00.014, Speaker B: Like, I think that, like, this token is going to be shield so hard when it comes out because all the influencers have tokens and they're going to shill it, but I'm probably going to be dumping into those shills when I get my tokens. I did buy an Ansem key though, at 0.8, but I sold at 1.6 and now it's like at five or something. It's crazy.
00:58:01.124 - 00:58:01.596, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:58:01.660 - 00:58:04.864, Speaker B: So, yeah, Ganson made 100k last week or something. It's crazy.
00:58:06.084 - 00:58:08.984, Speaker A: I mean, is, is one hundred k a lot for.
00:58:10.924 - 00:58:20.984, Speaker B: Like doing nothing? Yeah, that's crazy. I mean, he's just like posting this chat and like, he's just post on Twitter and makes hundred k. There are people speculating on his keys. That's pretty cool.
00:58:21.844 - 00:58:47.348, Speaker A: I mean, he goes on live stream and he, he says his cat's name or something and like a hundred million market caps. Samuel, I know 100k is a lot, buddy. I'm just saying, this guy's like the main, he's the main character right now. So if it was do Kwan, he wouldn't be like talking about 100k right now. He'd be talking about how his size is wag. Me says it's a lot for Billy. Okay.
00:58:47.348 - 00:58:47.748, Speaker A: All right.
00:58:47.796 - 00:58:48.268, Speaker B: All right.
00:58:48.356 - 00:58:54.224, Speaker A: Well, leave this one. Let's go to. Go ahead.
00:58:54.984 - 00:59:06.324, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think Justin had to go, but if Brad can pull up. Yeah. Oh, okay. So this is your pasta, right, Jordy?
00:59:06.664 - 00:59:39.124, Speaker A: Yeah, this is, this is my pasta. I still, I still chuckle when I see this. Can we, give me, can we, can we scroll down a little bit? Yeah. So there's a, there is a goat that this guy, I guess, in Nigeria or something, has bought using his world coin. And this is the real world asset thesis here. So you take your world coin and it makes a real difference in people's lives. So at worldcoin.
00:59:39.124 - 00:59:53.764, Speaker A: Thanks by Richard Opani. I don't know if this is 100% real or not, but Defi squared says gigachads like this have used us exit liquidity for a goat.
00:59:56.464 - 01:00:28.124, Speaker B: I think it is real. And I guess this is cool, where degens are bidding world coin and then people in other countries are using that to actually change their lives. I'm sure good is. I mean, I'm not really sure. And I think I also saw a post where people are like, naming the goats where I think Richard here, Richard Opini or Opani was like naming goats after CT characters. So, yeah, it's a real world asset, right? There rwas bullish.
01:00:32.344 - 01:00:35.744, Speaker A: I'm seeing Jody wins in the chat, so people like me.
01:00:35.824 - 01:00:44.444, Speaker B: How does Jordy always win? I thought Vicky's was pretty good.
01:00:45.504 - 01:00:58.920, Speaker A: Oh, man. We need, we need, we need to bring back the hat, the chef hat. I think instead of like a big pasta plate on my face, I want to at least have a little chef hat so Brad. Brad can step up there.
01:00:59.112 - 01:01:06.068, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe because the chat is like a bunch of meme coin holders. They didn't enjoy Vicki's pasta because it went against their bags.
01:01:06.156 - 01:01:07.944, Speaker A: That one hit home.
01:01:10.524 - 01:01:21.224, Speaker B: Yeah. Jordy pays the bots on stream. Yeah, it's possible. He's definitely been pinged to win recently. So we need a referee.
01:01:21.924 - 01:01:32.310, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, we'll wrap up. Please like and subscribe. I think, you know, this week's gonna be an interesting one. We have a large conference. So this is the Dubai conference of token. It's the first one they've done.
01:01:32.310 - 01:01:56.498, Speaker A: They've, you know, they do the huge one in Singapore. That's probably the biggest one in crypto every September. And now for the first time, they're going to do one in Dubai. There's a lot of people going crypto fight night on Friday. Ansem is fighting, so whatever Ansem, you guys remember when we had was the h pause. Ten Harry Potter Obama. Ten fighting Ben Armstrong.
01:01:56.498 - 01:02:29.434, Speaker A: And I think when, like, bitboy, like, knocked him out, that was like, you know, the death of that chart. So if you are in any Solana meme coins, they're either going to pump or dump, depending on this fight. So I'm expecting it to get a lot of views and I'll probably go to that fight and maybe we'll do a, maybe we can do a live stream after. That will be fun. We can discuss the fundamentals of meme coins based on who knocked out who.
01:02:30.934 - 01:02:34.678, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, cool.
01:02:34.766 - 01:02:44.822, Speaker A: All right, guys, let's wrap up. Thanks for joining us again and, yeah, hopefully less red next week. And let's go for a double top. See you next time, double top. Yeah. Bye.
