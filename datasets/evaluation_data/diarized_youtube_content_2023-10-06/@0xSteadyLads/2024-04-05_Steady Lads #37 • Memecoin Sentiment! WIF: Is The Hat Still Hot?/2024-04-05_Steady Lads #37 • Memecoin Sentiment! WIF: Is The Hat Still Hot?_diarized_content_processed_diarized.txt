00:00:23.440 - 00:00:47.344, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody. This is a back to back live episode. So this is episode 37. It's been quite a week. A lot going on, good and bad. So we'll dive into all of it, and we'll definitely call a lot of you in the audience to kind of give us some questions and, yeah, join in on the crazy week we've had. So, as usual, I'm Jordy, founder of Selena Capital.
00:00:47.344 - 00:01:03.734, Speaker A: There are no Jordy coins, just to be clear into the chat. So we have with us Justin, CEO of Astaria. Hey, Justin. We have Taiki, the newly engaged Taiki, so he's upgraded. Is it wife season?
00:01:05.274 - 00:01:08.014, Speaker B: No, not yet. It has to be 100k bitcoin for wife season.
00:01:11.394 - 00:01:13.774, Speaker A: You might be engaged a long time. We'll see.
00:01:14.754 - 00:01:21.294, Speaker B: Well, eat. BTC to 0.8 is the life changing money season. It's never gonna happen.
00:01:23.114 - 00:01:57.942, Speaker A: And think he's with us. Uh, so we'll dive into all kinds of market activity that's been happening. Um, I mean, what's. What stood out for you guys this week? For me, it's been mainly focused on the launches. And, you know, I've been quite surprised with both the up and the down. I guess, like, Tuesday, we had Athena. It was expected in the pre market and all the, you know, whales markets and all that stuff, around eight to 9 billion, and ended up kind of quickly going to around double that.
00:01:57.942 - 00:02:11.034, Speaker A: And then wormhole was the exact opposite. It was expected around 16, and it's kind of come down to, like, 910. Have you guys been trading those markets or looking at them? I guess, Taiki, maybe you've been farming them.
00:02:11.934 - 00:02:32.400, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I didn't actively farm wormhole or athena, but I mean, the wormhole air drop. I got this bridge governance token at $15 billion. I'm like, do I want this? I mean, whenever you get airdrops, you should ask yourself, like, do I really want this? And for me, the answer was no. I was like, I don't want this. So I just, like, dumped it, you know?
00:02:32.432 - 00:02:38.604, Speaker A: Did you dump it for. For soul? For USDC? For whiff? Like, what was your. What was your choice?
00:02:39.264 - 00:02:50.438, Speaker B: I bought. I bought some soul shit coins called metaplex, which is a maker, like, fundamentals play. Wait, what?
00:02:50.606 - 00:03:02.926, Speaker C: No, no. You gotta swap your wormhole for Costco hot dog token. It's only trading at, like, $0.07 now, and it's gonna go to the price of a Costco hot dog. A dollar 50. That is really the key here. That is the next meme coin meta.
00:03:03.110 - 00:03:06.634, Speaker B: I also saw, like, wormhole like, like a wormhole.
00:03:07.374 - 00:03:11.814, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw some people complaining about that one. Did that, like, oh, did they rug?
00:03:11.854 - 00:03:13.880, Speaker B: I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised.
00:03:13.992 - 00:03:14.844, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:03:15.784 - 00:03:22.164, Speaker B: If the w coin pumped, that would have pumped. But because wormholes dumping, the wormhole is also dumping, probably.
00:03:23.264 - 00:03:27.004, Speaker A: I see. You think wormhole was, was beta to wormhole.
00:03:28.384 - 00:03:29.164, Speaker B: Yes.
00:03:30.744 - 00:03:31.528, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:03:31.656 - 00:03:33.244, Speaker B: This industry is so ridiculous.
00:03:33.624 - 00:03:36.964, Speaker A: What have you been seeing on the Solana ecosystem over there?
00:03:38.124 - 00:04:04.784, Speaker D: Um, I haven't been doing much, um, on your comment on wormhole and athena. I I did expect Athena to, like, be valued much more in wormhole, just given, you know, how much more Athena's been in the attention cycle, and also the fact that, like, Athena is probably, like, one of the most profitable protocols, just like, in the entire space right now. So, yeah, definitely pleasantly surprised to see that flipping take place.
00:04:06.004 - 00:04:39.470, Speaker C: I actually want to call out. So a few episodes ago, I shared that analysis of the last couple hundred airdrops that showed airdrops peak on the third day, generally, but that data was actually about a year old or a couple years old. Someone actually dm me on Twitter. I'll see if I could pull up the analysis. But they looked at the last 15 or so big airdrops, and it seems like the trend now is that price peaks a couple of weeks after the airdrop, as opposed to immediately after on the first couple of days. And for me, I'm actually holding my, my wormhole airdrop. I just think you don't want to sell these things when the market's been dumping.
00:04:39.470 - 00:04:51.394, Speaker C: Like, these tokens launched in some of the worst days possible of the year, where bitcoin's, like, well off the highs and whatnot. And so for me, I'm sticking with it for now, and I don't have much Solana exposure, so. Seems like a good play.
00:04:53.334 - 00:04:56.718, Speaker A: Yeah, I think. Yeah, go ahead, tiki.
00:04:56.886 - 00:05:23.204, Speaker D: I was just going to say, like, especially when there's, like, bigger launches that are, like, you know, multiple billion dollars, circ, it takes, you know, a long time for the, you know, the airdrop fractal to play out and, like, all the airdrop receivers to churn through and get it to the long hold buyers. So, I mean, Tia took, like, a few weeks to actually, like, pop off, so I wouldn't be surprised if. And Manta as well, took like, a few days and, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it takes longer for that sort of fractal performance.
00:05:23.764 - 00:05:24.116, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:24.140 - 00:05:36.788, Speaker B: And the jito thing is not even real because jitto recently hit new highs. Jupiter too. Jupiter hit like 160. That was ridiculous. I did not see that coming. Like anything in the solar ecosystem.
00:05:36.836 - 00:05:37.544, Speaker A: 180.
00:05:38.364 - 00:05:40.372, Speaker B: It's crazy. Yeah, yeah, sure.
00:05:40.428 - 00:05:59.384, Speaker C: Shout out to Djen, colo for making this for and sending it along to me. But you can see here, like, the. The median is day 16, which means that this is pushed out from like two weeks from what it used to be for when airdrops peak. And it sounds like this is old data, even though it's only five days old. So I'm basically just following this guideline. I haven't sold the wormhole yet.
00:06:00.684 - 00:06:46.638, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think it's extremely unlikely that we're not going to have some rally at some point. It does feel like it's been down only for the first 36 hours, but it is a huge airdrop. They gave a lot of tokens to a lot of different people. They were very, very generous. And as you guys said, it takes a little bit of time, time to watch through the system, but eventually we'll probably see some rally and some people in the chat are talking about potentially staking w for Monad, because I think that happened, like, the reverse happened. So w even gave people in the Monad discord tokens. And I think there might be some reciprocal moves maybe later on, so that.
00:06:46.686 - 00:06:54.794, Speaker D: It took a long time to moon. So, like, warm welcome, follow the same track. Well, it is the same. It's like. But they're both jump back.
00:06:55.254 - 00:07:05.234, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess from a trading perspective, it's maybe good to just like, buy and sell in a couple weeks and just view it as that type of trade.
00:07:05.614 - 00:07:20.914, Speaker D: I'm curious, Joey. Like, I mean, you know, these airdrop events, it's always like a wealth effect for the people that hold these tokens. And they tend to, like, there's some correlation there with where they rotate to next. Like, where do you think they might move that money into?
00:07:22.174 - 00:07:49.970, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, I was, I was holding some betas expecting that the wormhole wealth effect would potentially help either things in Solana. So, like, wif, it was the. Was the one that, unfortunately, we'll get to that. But I think that the culture of Wif has taken a. A painful blow. But maybe it was a painful blow. I thought Axelr might do well, you know, synapse.
00:07:49.970 - 00:08:16.194, Speaker A: I think some of the other smaller bridges were expected to maybe pump. But, you know, given that the expectation for w was a little bit higher, those haven't actually, you know, done particularly well. And I think Solana as well, I thought, would do quite well. I thought a lot of people would rotate into Seoul, but we seem to be in a little bit of a rough patch for Seoul as well.
00:08:18.214 - 00:08:47.614, Speaker C: What are your guys thoughts on the cynicism that I think the meme coin mania has brought in to basically everyone, even the people that play these meme coins and make money off them? I feel like it leads to us all becoming so cynical on crypto where, like, the sentiment now is none of these coins have any real worth. So why speculate on the projects that can fail and the projects that have, like, execution risk and not. Why not just buy these meme coins if it's all a meme anyway? What are your thoughts on that? Are you guys getting sucked into the cynicism?
00:08:50.194 - 00:09:25.134, Speaker A: It's partly like a short termism, right? Like, people are thinking, like, what's going to potentially give me, like, a ten x the next day? And it's always going to be a smaller, random project, and it's not going to be, you know, a $10 billion project. I see people in the chat talking about bowdoin and Trump and stuff. Like, I think Bowdoin is the only thing that's actually performed well in the last couple days, and I think we're a little bit early for election season. I don't know that, but maybe it was. Maybe it was undervalued in the attention spectrum.
00:09:28.054 - 00:09:47.422, Speaker B: And I think I heard someone say that if you look in the past, if you look at the markets for the past, let's say year, like, the hottest narratives, they only last three to six months. It's like, I think Q three, Q four. Last year, people were just jerking off to rollbit, Unibot, ox.
00:09:47.598 - 00:09:54.684, Speaker C: Even now, didn't people care about lidocoin at Q four last year? That was a hot.
00:09:54.724 - 00:10:21.244, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, the point is, like, kind of adding to what Jordy said about short termism, people just feel like whatever people are feeling in the moment, they just think that it's going to continue on forever. But in reality, these things only last a couple months. Unlike generally bullish meme coins as a sector. Like, if we're in a bull market, but maybe we've reached peak mind share, but I'm also mid curve and, you know, so, like, how. How the hell am I supposed to know?
00:10:22.264 - 00:10:48.132, Speaker C: I. I hope it's peak meme coin, not because I'm against them or I think they're wrong or anything like that. I think it's fun, and, like, I have fun doing it, too. I'm in, you know, a bunch of group chats, and it's just like, a fun activity, but I would like to see excitement around real projects. Right? Like, I think, you know, with Eigen lair coming soon, that's going to obviously draw a ton of excitement. We've got Athena, which is really cool. And, like, these things are exciting, but they're still, like, in the back burner for everyone's mind share.
00:10:48.132 - 00:10:54.304, Speaker C: And it would be nice if we start talking about, like, the projects and what's actually being built, as opposed to just the pure casino clients.
00:10:55.324 - 00:10:58.972, Speaker A: Let's talk a little bit about ETH. You know, it's. It's obviously a sensitive topic.
00:10:59.028 - 00:11:00.224, Speaker C: No, no.
00:11:03.604 - 00:11:41.018, Speaker A: Brian, a in the chat is actually asking if I've capitulated on my e thesis instead of calling out Justin. So, Brian, I have said, like, you know, a few weeks ago that I think we kind of meet the ETF buzz for ETH to outperform again. And I have been temporarily capitulating until it looks like ETF is in the horizon. Then I think we see a really, really good rally for ETH and ETH BTC, especially from the lows that we're at now. So I'm waiting patiently to see when the right time will be for the ETF season. But can you.
00:11:41.186 - 00:12:01.694, Speaker C: Yeah, but before we get into that, and my thoughts, and I obviously have to accept a roasting from thiki in the chat, Jordy, can you just share what it's like? I mean, you're working very closely in building an l two, and there's terrible. I wouldn't say terrible, but there's negative sentiment towards l two s and ETH scaling roadmap as a builder and working with a team that's doing this. Like, what? What's it like on the inside?
00:12:03.954 - 00:12:42.670, Speaker A: Well, manful, thankfully, has is the highest performing l two this year. So, like, a price wise, at least. So the sentiment is good, as you can imagine, even despite the environment generally being bad, I do have a sense that we will not have infinite l two s. And you want to be one of the ones that kind of make the cut. And part of it is, like, the attention and the mind share of the users. So not everybody has that mind share, even the ones that people know about, like, stark. Right? Like, I don't know exactly what, you know, what ecosystem is going to look like there.
00:12:42.670 - 00:13:21.602, Speaker A: It should have been a bit more developed by now. So, I mean, sentiment is a little bit annoyed at the amount of first underperformance of Ethan, just like you have Solana meme coins that are slash sol. So when Sol goes up you know, whatever, bowdoin is going to go up. You know, something like puff, for example. It was issued in ETH, so it was like 42,069 ETH for one puf, and now it's down to, like, 14,000. So, you know, maybe it's going to go down to one to one parity. But my point is it's massively outperformed.
00:13:21.602 - 00:13:34.454, Speaker A: But because ETH has gone down 25%, that sort of affects every pairing. That is an ETH pairing. So I think it's a little bit of a bummer for the entire ecosystem until. Until that sort of changes.
00:13:35.474 - 00:14:03.304, Speaker C: Gotcha. I can share my thoughts on ETH BTC, as I know the chat's been. Been hounding me on that. We're down maybe 5% on the week, maybe a little more on BTC. You know, it's interesting. I don't know how much more I can say except for, like, in the short term, I've clearly been wrong and I deserve a mental health break from the EBTC topic. But, like, one other thing I will say is, like, is this time really different? Because last cycle, ETH was a laggard, was slow to evolve.
00:14:03.304 - 00:14:31.392, Speaker C: People were saying the barbell at that time was BTC and defi coins. Now it's Beast BTC and meme coins slash Solana, basically. And I just think it's not the worst time to be a contrarian. I mean, I know I've been saying that for a while, but if it turns out we get an ETF at some point this year, even if it takes till December, like, I think your ETH purchase relative to bitcoin is going to look pretty good right now. So I don't know how much there is to say. I feel like I have to go down with the ship at this point. Like, I'm not.
00:14:31.392 - 00:14:42.924, Speaker C: I just refuse to be the guy that swaps their ETH back to bitcoin at 0.045 or whatever we're at, and then, you know, this thing pumps and I'm caught on the wrong side. Like, I'd rather just ride this thing all the way down.
00:14:45.864 - 00:14:47.144, Speaker B: Sent them in the chat.
00:14:47.304 - 00:15:02.744, Speaker C: I mean, how can I? I can't. If I'd rather lose all my money than be wrong, right? Like. Like, the downside of losing everything is much lower than me swapping to bitcoin, ETH pumping, and then me missing that and just getting trolled more. I'd rather just hold BTC to zero.
00:15:03.924 - 00:15:35.818, Speaker D: The toughest part about this trade is that, like, I think everyone in their heart of hearts knows ETH should flip bitcoin. At least that's what I feel. It's just like, it's such, like an easy trade that, like, the timing is so difficult because everyone's just, like, trying to, I don't want to say be greedy, but, like, they just want to be ETH barons and just own all the ETH. So, like, personally, I think you can go down to, like, 0.04 maybe in zero four. Yeah, 0.045. But in two years time, Justin, you will be a rich man.
00:15:35.818 - 00:15:37.106, Speaker D: There's no doubt about it.
00:15:37.250 - 00:15:37.934, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:38.634 - 00:16:00.910, Speaker C: One thing I'll say about this is, like, this sort of struck me when bitcoin was like, 20k. Everyone wanted the asset. They just wanted to buy it at a better price. I actually think everyone really does want to hold ETH, to your point, Vicki. But people want to buy it at a better price, and maybe we get there, maybe we don't. I just think the downside to your point is like, yeah, okay, we go to 0.04, even zero three.
00:16:00.910 - 00:16:07.886, Speaker C: But when you factor in taxes and just the possibility of you're wrong, if you swap now, I just don't think it makes much sense.
00:16:08.070 - 00:16:34.924, Speaker B: Yeah, and. And also, I guess if you're holding ETH on a centralized exchange, you might actually be cucked. But if you're staking with Eigen layer and you get fat airdrops and whatnot, then technically EBTC doesn't look as bad. If you consider the staking rate and all those factors, maybe that's cope. But I feel like if you're using ETH productively on chain, then it's not as bad as the BTC chart is telling you.
00:16:35.584 - 00:17:00.122, Speaker C: Yeah. The last thing I'll note on this is. I see, yeah, yeah. An interesting comment from Samuel. Like, what's the invalidation for you? Such an interesting question, because I actually don't really think that way. I feel like a lot of times, like, people are pressured to become traders in the crypto space, but, like, you don't actually have to be a trader. Like, it doesn't actually matter to me in the long term if ETH BTC goes to zero three five, 0.04,
00:17:00.122 - 00:17:23.824, Speaker C: or if this is the bottom and it goes up from here. My plan has always just been to hold ETH and see what happens. My plan has never been to sort of trade between ETH and bitcoin and comparing my asset to other assets that are going up much more. So for me, it's not something I worry about. Of course, it is a little depressing looking at, you know, it's like the quote, everyone is getting hilariously rich and you're not, which is tough, but that's the space we live in. So.
00:17:24.524 - 00:17:26.744, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you were going to say something.
00:17:28.964 - 00:17:37.424, Speaker D: I was going. I feel like that metric where you measure staking yield onto a coin, it's like the tiki indicator or something.
00:17:37.744 - 00:17:39.164, Speaker B: The tiki indicator.
00:17:40.944 - 00:17:42.364, Speaker D: Like with celestia.
00:17:43.304 - 00:17:51.272, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, I guess if you bought Celestia this year, it kind of sucks.
00:17:51.328 - 00:17:56.824, Speaker D: But no, I mean, with air, with. With dim, it's still like, you know, very well worth it. So you sold?
00:17:56.864 - 00:18:06.714, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Because if you didn't. If you didn't get dim, it's pretty, pretty bad. But if you got dim, you're like, just chilling, you know? So I guess it kind of depends on the timing as well.
00:18:07.094 - 00:18:21.942, Speaker A: You see here, Larry Fink gonna pump your east bag. So let's quickly bring up the events. Four pronged ethesis. Just to. Just to look at the four guys. I want to, like, think about which one of them is going to actually. So we have Larry Fink.
00:18:21.942 - 00:18:48.234, Speaker A: You know, Blackrock has issued an ETF proposal. They're whatever, one zillion to one. Then we have Brian Armstrong. So Coinbase is obviously very heavily invested in base. They're putting a lot of effort into it and seems to be doing well. I don't know. We have GCR, so GCR kind of always talks about the ten k is sort of like, inevitable.
00:18:48.234 - 00:19:15.718, Speaker A: And we have free ROM. And this is kind of like the belief that the massive Eigen layer airdrop will kind of be like a wealth effect and revitalize the community. Let's. I mean, if you had to choose one of these four theses, you know, for me, it's just. It's the GCR thesis. I just feel like he sees some things clearly sometimes. And I've learned not to fade, I think.
00:19:15.718 - 00:19:18.874, Speaker A: Out of those four, like, which one do you think is. Is like?
00:19:20.254 - 00:19:30.230, Speaker D: I think. Yeah, I think probably Fink and the ETF is the most interesting to me. I actually think the Sriram. The Eigen layer one has already played out.
00:19:30.422 - 00:19:33.558, Speaker A: I think most already played out. The token's not even out.
00:19:33.726 - 00:19:54.334, Speaker D: Most people have already, like, you know, the restate, like, when Eigen Lair opened their caps. Like, ETH BTC ripped afterwards. And people are buying Justin son, Richard Hart is buying Ethan. Like Richard Heart, but like, yeah, there's buying Ethan, restaking it. I actually think when Eigen Lair, the airdrop happens and unlocks, like all this ETH is actually going to get sold on the markets and it's actually be a bearish unlock event.
00:19:55.914 - 00:20:33.138, Speaker C: I actually have a counterpoint to this, Vicki. I think actually the more appropriate comparison is when withdrawals went live for steak teeth, because we actually thought there would be like a huge unstaking event because ETH was literally locked up. But it actually was the most bullish thing when you fact, when you talked about lockups and all. Eigen layer ETH is withdrawable right now. You can withdraw it. There's like a 24 hours, there's a very short withdrawal period to take your ETH out of Eigen layer and you retain your points, you don't lose your points for withdrawing. So I actually think when the token goes live, and this is not a bull case for ETH, but I don't think it's played out yet.
00:20:33.138 - 00:20:45.194, Speaker C: But when the token goes live and there's an actual yield that you can calculate, this staked ETH yield is 3%. Now, maybe with Eigen layer it's 5% or 6%. I think then that's when it becomes more attractive, personally.
00:20:45.654 - 00:20:48.862, Speaker A: So you like I can layer out of those four, or are you kind of like.
00:20:48.998 - 00:21:08.900, Speaker C: No, no, I'm not. I'm actually. I think short term, Larry Fink. Like Larry Fink is going to be the story of 2024. If the ETF is approved or denied, it's going to be, you know, on his shoulders, let's say. But I think long term, you have to trust Coinbase on this one. I think it's a huge signal that Coinbase is building base.
00:21:08.900 - 00:21:25.904, Speaker C: And I still think maybe this is cope, but I still think the innovation happens on the Ethereum stack. I still am not seeing like the true innovation happening outside of the EVM. Maybe I'm totally biased and missing something with Solana, but, like, I haven't seen anything that zero to one on Solana get built yet.
00:21:26.764 - 00:21:27.756, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:21:27.940 - 00:22:39.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to add to the key comment, like, obviously the biggest. You know, it's kind of up to Larry Fink and the ETF in the short term, but I think for the rest of the cycle, I do think Eigen layer is the most hyped ETH based launch. So I never imagined that people would sell ETH, like, unrestake their ETH and sell. But I think what we could see is because Eigen layer is so hyped, people think it's going to hit like $100 billion fdv and whatnot, which I think is still reasonable if Eigalayer launches, and it's not as exciting, if it is all the news, then I can definitely see that taking down the entire, I mean, not like the entire altcoin market. But if people get so hyped in diagnosis before it happens, and it's not as amazing as expected, then maybe we do see people sell off their alt exposure. And also, if people want to buy Eigen, then they have to sell something to buy. And it's kind of the idea that if we keep launching new tokens with a limited pool of capital, at some point the average price has to come down.
00:22:41.054 - 00:23:17.854, Speaker A: Let's talk about this comment here, saying, I'm worried about Abs demand, that it will be small and slow compared to the TVL. And so with Eigen layer, we have two separate games going on. One is like, just like the pure speculation of these tokens. Etherfi launched at like five to 8 billion, and then, like, the next ones are also gonna hope to have some ratio of that as well. And then Eigen layer itself, launching at 35 billion, then you're just getting points on points and points. This is something that sort of, like, drives the crypto casino, where people are just like, speculating on all these different tokens and they have something to play with. This is not different than what's happening on Solana.
00:23:17.854 - 00:24:25.376, Speaker A: These things don't necessarily have, like, fundamental grounding in being worth billions of dollars, but there's just like a lot of activity around it, and that sort of, like, builds itself and becomes real. It's like a self reinforcing thing, versus you have the actual underlying Abs demand, which is what's the actual revenue. And we've seen the celestial revenue numbers, you know, maybe didn't. It's not that expensive to use Celestia and maybe 20 billion for that cash flow into the future is not that high. What is the AV's demand for security? How much are they really paying? And what are the slashing conditions on that? Who's going to start trying to rug restaking ETH? There is a little bit of a question mark around the reality. I think that the token game itself is looking very strong. And people like Justin sun, you said he got into Eigen layer, and then he's been farming all these different LRT protocols, putting hundreds of millions of dollars into them.
00:24:25.376 - 00:24:27.524, Speaker A: So he's having a fun game.
00:24:28.784 - 00:25:01.734, Speaker C: I think you bring up a good point, Jordy, where we in this space conflate the token price with success, when the two couldn't be further from the truth. You could just imagine. Imagine Solana's price today was still dollar 20, right? Like, we would all be saying, it's only worth $20. We'd be like, oh, it's only for meme coins. It's just a casino. What have they built? What's new? But the price reinforces the narrative for us, just because that's how humans are. And so, yeah, I think the money to be made here is when you can separate price and the actual product itself, which is, I think, very important to do.
00:25:01.734 - 00:25:03.994, Speaker C: And we don't really do that generally in our space.
00:25:05.914 - 00:26:19.570, Speaker A: So Matt Wong from paradigm had an interesting post, and he's sort of like, asking, what part of within this l two world how does ETH l one do well? And we're seeing some comments, kind of like bringing up the same point, like, why don't you just buy all these l two tokens and see which one is doing well? So we have the tweet up, if you can bring it up, Justin here in the chat, but he's sort of like, asking, like, for ETH zero one to do well, what matters the most? Is it the gas token of ETH? Is it the data availability layer? Is it being money? Is it just the philosophical alignment? Like, what is it? And I kind of agree with, you know, Dan Robinson and some of the comments that he got, which is the only bullish thing for ETH. And this is the only thing I've personally. ETH has to be, like, the base currency of all these, like, ecosystems and all these l two s, and it can't be around the actual revenue stream of gas. I think that's not going to be near enough to justify, you know, like, a trillion dollar valuation. It has to be money ness. So I don't know if any of you guys have any comment on this.
00:26:19.762 - 00:26:54.670, Speaker C: I mean, eve cannibalized its own business, right. When they went, they moved to the blob based payment method for l two s, right? So that was, like, going to be a huge revenue source. The thesis was, ETH l one is going to be reserved for the whales, the people that don't care about $100 transactions, and l two s where ETH is going to make a ton of its money, because those l two s have to pay ETH for security. And, yeah, I mean, ETH is caught between in a rock and a hard place. The more expensive you make the chain, the less useful it is. But the less expensive you make it, the less valuable the chain is. So it's sort of this interesting balance Solana has taken obviously the opposite approach.
00:26:54.862 - 00:27:10.314, Speaker A: And yeah, I mean, have you seen Solana throughput though? Like, it's been pretty painful. I tried to use it quite a lot in the last few days. We had the Zeus launch, which we'll talk about as well. Thank you. Have you tried to use Solana? Have you gotten transactions?
00:27:10.894 - 00:27:41.710, Speaker D: It's kind of tough, but I hear that if you up your gas fee a little bit higher just from like 0.1 to 0.2 pennies, then like it becomes smoother. I haven't tried it personally, but I've experienced some issues with Solana. Regarding your point on ETH, though, I do want to say like, I agree with you that like, focusing too much on like burn and gas. I think it is kind of like a Psyop. Like, the way I think about it is like, you know, 45% of global gold demand every year comes from jewelry.
00:27:41.710 - 00:28:14.184, Speaker D: But like, you know, jewelry demand isn't driving gold price. It's like, you know, gold status as an SOB that drives it. And I think the jewelry demand is just like a minor thing that keeps the price trading a little bit better than it normally would. So I think as an asset gets bigger when you're at that like 100 billion to 300 billion asset size, like Solana or like ETH was then, like this burn casino thesis really does affect valuation, but when you get bigger, you can't sustain solely on that. Has to be something bigger than that, you know, sustain the values might take.
00:28:15.444 - 00:28:16.464, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:28:17.204 - 00:28:18.464, Speaker B: Yeah, that's reasonable.
00:28:18.924 - 00:28:32.948, Speaker A: By the way, guys, we're near all time high. We have 450 live viewers. So our, our editor is gonna kill me. Here we go. Like and subscribe. He knew, Brad knew I had to do this. So yeah, please like and subscribe.
00:28:32.948 - 00:29:21.948, Speaker A: It's good to have you all here and we want to just, you know, have you notified when, when our new weekly video comes out? Yeah. Let's talk a little bit about the third launch. So we had another Jupyter launch. It was the Zeus launch, used the launch pad on Solana, the LFG launchpad, which is what Jupiter had used for their token as well as the meme coin. When token that came out before, I did try once again, failed once again to buy, you know, like they have this bonding curve where it goes from. In this case it was 300 million to 800 million ftb. And I tried to use the pre market limit order and, you know, I was fine to pay like whatever, 5600 million.
00:29:21.948 - 00:29:53.524, Speaker A: So it kind of used a bunch of different wallets and tried to like buy some and once again, it was gone in one block. I didn't like, it just disappeared. Somebody just took it all, the entire thing. I think it was, it was like 30 million. So it kind of was giving me flashbacks once again of the stargate thing. But it just. And then people started trying to trade it and then whoever bought it all probably sold some back.
00:29:53.524 - 00:30:26.984, Speaker A: So they basically bought everything at like 30. Then they were just like selling it at 80. So whoever did that Mev probably made eight figures. So I don't know what you guys think. I mean, maybe it's just a matter of like, not setting the price band long enough or maybe there shouldn't be cheap tokens because it just gets to me, it somehow doesn't feel exactly right from a game theory standpoint. I don't know if you guys have participated in these type of launches.
00:30:29.764 - 00:30:59.028, Speaker B: I personally haven't. I think I'm kind of more interested in how the Jupiter token has been trading because I think when it first launched it was, oh, my God, it's 8 billion FTV. And then it doubled and now people are staking Jup for future allocation. And I guess the playbook really is stake token for future coins because otherwise, you know, if you're sharing revenues, your tokens are security. But if you're staking something for airdrops, it's not really a security.
00:30:59.116 - 00:30:59.452, Speaker C: Maybe.
00:30:59.508 - 00:31:00.304, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:31:02.124 - 00:31:37.424, Speaker A: I mean, this is sort of like the very traditional concept of what's valuable is distribution. If you have a large channel on YouTube, if you have a large Twitter following, you have distribution in the Solana ecosystem. Jupiter has had very strong distribution. That's very valuable right now because everyone's kind of going to be following along if there's a launch pad. And then the stakers, I think Zeus gave a couple percent, I think, to Solana, to Jupyter stakers. So they end up getting paid for the fact that they're a part of this distribution.
00:31:39.644 - 00:31:53.754, Speaker C: Regarding distribution, Jordy, is it worth talking a little bit about Echo? I mean, I know a couple of you guys, right, or all three of you are eventually going to be running echo groups, could consider doing it as well. Do you think that's the solution to this distribution problem?
00:31:55.734 - 00:32:46.304, Speaker A: No. I mean, I've tried to go so just for everybody in the chat, like Echo is, you know, Kobe has launched a sort of, what we call it, like, it's kind of like disintermediating VC's where people can bring deals directly to, you know, mass audience instead of just like a few VC's the thing with Echo is, like, it doesn't scale infinitely. Like, even if you have, you know, 500 people in your group, if you bring a deal, that's a million dollars, if everybody wants to do it, that's like, you know, one or two k a person. Imagine if you had, like, 100,000 people. So it's. It's a great tool for targeting communities that maybe have something in common, and you want to target, like, the gaming one or the AI one and. And give allocation to, like, those communities.
00:32:46.304 - 00:32:56.228, Speaker A: But I don't know if it can be that, like, you know, 100,000 people, like, even these groups, I think they're limited to 100 Americans. Right.
00:32:56.276 - 00:33:04.524, Speaker C: So, yeah, it also, it's interesting, it spawns the same race condition that you get with an on chain operation. It's just not on chain.
00:33:04.604 - 00:33:04.796, Speaker A: Right.
00:33:04.820 - 00:33:41.064, Speaker C: Like the race condition is now, do I have my money on base? Is it in the Echo platform? And am I going to be one of the first ever x number of people that can buy into this deal? And it seems to me that sophisticated actors could end up buying that as well, because I don't think, I mean, we'll see how it shakes out, but I don't think it's. There's no incentive for the person structuring the deal. Like, Ansem has a very big platform on Echo already. There's no incentive to limit the size of your investment group. Right. Like, you should, theoretically, want to max it out so that every deal you do is oversubscribed or fully subscribed. And so you're just creating the race condition off chain versus doing, like, an on chain Mev.
00:33:41.064 - 00:33:42.124, Speaker C: Race condition.
00:33:44.664 - 00:34:15.020, Speaker A: I don't know. I think some people might take a different approach than just letting infinite people in and, you know, having them all bought each other and whatever. So I guess the big news, actually, for the audience is that Taiki has succumbed. He's no longer saying no to all private flow coming his way. He feels good about the fact that he can share it with his community. So he is, for the first time being, tasting the dark side that we all have been tasting.
00:34:15.212 - 00:34:17.104, Speaker B: If you share my screen, Justin.
00:34:17.444 - 00:34:18.264, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:19.444 - 00:35:00.220, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a yeah. Because I guess, yeah, I kind of had this post around this world, like, this personal dilemma that I had around not doing private deals and whatnot for, I guess, the lack of fairness. But, you know, Kobe, I mean, I feel like if someone, if some random anon made echo, it's. People would think it's a scam, but because Kobe's doing it. It's like, oh, like, it has to be legit. And I do agree that, you know, running an echo group is basically the only audience aligned way for someone to monetize an audience, because you have to invest on the same terms. Take symmetric risk, and I only get paid if people make money.
00:35:00.220 - 00:35:16.252, Speaker B: And there's a. I think there's a flat $5,000 fee to do each individual deal. So the syndicate leader, I suppose, is only incentivized to bring really good deals, and I guess this is only possible.
00:35:16.428 - 00:35:27.248, Speaker A: Are you doing what Justin said? Are you just letting everybody in? Are you doing it just for your subscribers on your research thing? How are you curating your. Your group?
00:35:27.416 - 00:35:35.576, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm still thinking about it. I don't want it to be symbol, so I have to figure out a way to make it.
00:35:35.600 - 00:35:50.502, Speaker C: I have two things to say about that. Jordy, you got to let me into your group. It's absolutely ridiculous that I'm not in it already. I have a pending application as of, like, three days ago. Everyone else has accepted me. I'm in, like, ten different groups, and I'm still waiting on yours, which I think is horribly unfair. Two.
00:35:50.558 - 00:35:51.754, Speaker B: I don't think I'm in it either.
00:35:52.414 - 00:36:01.070, Speaker C: All right, Jordy, take care of the lads. And then two, I think I see comments. There should be a steady lads echo group, which would be fun.
00:36:01.142 - 00:36:03.594, Speaker D: Maybe just this one.
00:36:05.734 - 00:36:07.354, Speaker C: Yeah, that's.
00:36:08.574 - 00:36:10.594, Speaker D: Let me double dip in echo group, too.
00:36:12.134 - 00:36:27.742, Speaker C: There is this weird double dip thing where if two groups have the same deal, you can, you know, if the allocations cap to two k for one group and two k in another group, you can double dip and do it in two groups. Is interesting. So, yes, I want to get in Jordy's group, Tyche's group, Vicki's group, anyone's group. I want it.
00:36:27.838 - 00:36:34.254, Speaker B: This is the problem, though. Like, you don't want this problem. You can't have this. Like, I don't want to allow this.
00:36:34.294 - 00:36:41.150, Speaker C: I mean, they could block double dipping. There's no way they can block double dipping. One wants to double dip the chip.
00:36:41.182 - 00:36:44.514, Speaker A: And the other one is, like, you know, stay away from the bowl.
00:36:44.934 - 00:36:48.588, Speaker B: The point of echo is to give regular retail participation.
00:36:48.636 - 00:36:50.744, Speaker C: I am regular retail. I'm holding you.
00:36:52.444 - 00:36:59.692, Speaker B: Well, I guess you are, you know, doing some mental health break because of the e to BTC ratio, but you.
00:36:59.708 - 00:37:05.704, Speaker C: Got to normalize the triple dip. Investing in the private round yourself and then doing multiple echo groups.
00:37:08.644 - 00:37:15.368, Speaker A: Are you doing an echo group? Who is sticky doing an echo one?
00:37:15.536 - 00:37:23.764, Speaker D: I'm setting one up. I'm looking into it, but honestly, Justin seems like the type of guy who's, like, a huge credit card maxer back in college.
00:37:24.344 - 00:37:30.564, Speaker C: No, no, not at all. I keep it simple with, like, 2% cash back. Credit cards.
00:37:33.504 - 00:37:34.724, Speaker D: Keep it simple.
00:37:35.384 - 00:37:38.244, Speaker C: But, yeah, thickie, let me in your group, dude. I'll share a deal flow.
00:37:40.704 - 00:37:51.044, Speaker A: Just for reference. So the. The first deal did go through, and somebody brought, I think it was $300,000 or so of the Ethina.
00:37:51.784 - 00:37:52.604, Speaker D: Huge.
00:37:53.224 - 00:37:56.088, Speaker A: And I participated, but I know if.
00:37:56.096 - 00:37:59.924, Speaker C: It was Anson because I think there were two, actually.
00:38:00.224 - 00:38:03.176, Speaker A: So they both brought. They both brought it. Yep.
00:38:03.280 - 00:38:09.704, Speaker C: Yeah, I got into the Athena one, but wasn't into. There was another group that ran one. I wasn't accepted in that group at that time.
00:38:11.084 - 00:38:15.264, Speaker A: Okay. I'm not sure who did the Athena one.
00:38:15.724 - 00:38:17.132, Speaker D: It was Sir Shokunen.
00:38:17.268 - 00:38:18.824, Speaker A: Yeah, I think thick. He's correct.
00:38:19.164 - 00:38:20.784, Speaker C: And Ansem. And Ansem.
00:38:21.444 - 00:38:22.836, Speaker D: Yeah, they might have been both, but.
00:38:22.860 - 00:38:31.184, Speaker C: Like, I would share my screen, but if you. If you. Apparently, if you share your screen, you get instantly banned from Echo. And we can't have that. But I can. I can promise it was an too.
00:38:33.344 - 00:39:01.790, Speaker A: The bottom line is that, okay, maybe they both did. So they both brought it in this thing, you know, mark to market. Obviously, it's low circulating comply, you know, high ftv. But it marked to like a 30 x, right? Yeah, instantly. So the, whatever 600k that went in ended up making like a 24 million kind of mark to market more, maybe more like thirty k. Oh, wait, I'm being retarded.
00:39:01.822 - 00:39:02.474, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:39:03.094 - 00:39:16.114, Speaker C: At one point, I calculated it, I put in two k, and I think it was worth. It's worth was worth 66 at one point. But, like, one interesting thing to note is, like, obviously it's all locked up for many years, and I don't think you can OTC this stuff. Like, you could with normal deals.
00:39:17.854 - 00:39:47.584, Speaker A: Yeah, you can't. I mean, people try. I have had, like, an anonymous, like, hey, can you, like, hedge out a Athena thing? And I'm like, first of all, guy will probably just, like, wipe your equity clean if he gets a sense that you're doing this. And secondly, like, yeah, with this stuff that's locked up for a long time, like, you know, you have. You have to take a large discount. So I don't even know if you. If you want to do that.
00:39:47.584 - 00:39:55.554, Speaker A: Once you realize, you know, the discount you would take because everyone's just like, next day they think they can just cash out a 30 x, but it doesn't quite work. That way.
00:39:56.814 - 00:40:12.510, Speaker C: It's interesting. They actually sent out an email. People didn't realize that if you participate in this, you are locked at the same schedule as other investors. And so after the token went live, they emailed you saying, like, we'll actually reverse the deal if you want. Oh, wow. This is the only time, though. Yeah.
00:40:12.702 - 00:40:13.754, Speaker D: That's insane.
00:40:14.294 - 00:40:21.626, Speaker C: I hope I shouldn't. Should be. I'm allowed to share this. I don't want to get banned from the platform on the pre recording or.
00:40:21.650 - 00:40:34.014, Speaker D: Post recording, but, um, dude, the perp funding on finance was 400% negative on the first day, which implied that, like, a bunch of people are trying to hedge and lock it in, and it went up, like, 50% in their face.
00:40:34.634 - 00:40:57.074, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like, the might not be. So it could be. It could be, like. Like you said, it could be investors trying to hedge for four years, which, I don't know. I think the more likely thing is it's season two farmers that are only trying to lock in for, you know, three, four, five months, whatever. Exactly. They said it was going to be because you can lock in, you know, a certain number of.
00:40:57.074 - 00:41:22.774, Speaker A: They're not called shards anymore. They're called sats now because they're moving to bitcoin, which is, you know, a larger market cap. And therefore, you know, some people might have tried to hedge thinking they're going to get a certain number of tokens. And like you said, it just went super negative. I think this is generally a sign that, yeah, there's demand for hedging, but there's not enough supply out there of tokens.
00:41:24.074 - 00:41:29.762, Speaker D: Gotcha. Gotcha. That makes sense. Points, shards. Sats. Every.
00:41:29.818 - 00:41:34.682, Speaker C: Every season, we call them, like, the.
00:41:34.698 - 00:41:42.064, Speaker A: Shard was like, ethereum, kind of like shards. And then the SAts is like, the bitcoin thing. So if they do, like, Solana next, what's gonna be, like, the.
00:41:42.444 - 00:41:44.384, Speaker B: The manlets? I don't know.
00:41:44.764 - 00:41:45.700, Speaker A: Farm manlets.
00:41:45.732 - 00:41:47.676, Speaker D: What manlets?
00:41:47.700 - 00:41:48.784, Speaker B: That'd be hilarious.
00:41:49.684 - 00:41:51.504, Speaker D: Lamports. They're called lamports.
00:41:52.244 - 00:41:53.580, Speaker A: Lamps.
00:41:53.772 - 00:41:56.668, Speaker D: That's like the ute. That's like the guay of E or Salona.
00:41:56.836 - 00:42:00.344, Speaker B: Oh, what did he name it? That.
00:42:00.724 - 00:42:04.224, Speaker D: I don't know, like a funny name. Like sats.
00:42:05.364 - 00:42:06.202, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:06.388 - 00:42:34.674, Speaker C: I've kind of been wondering, like, I mean, you talk to a lot of funds. Do you have a sense of, like, what the actual returns are for venture funds that are not, like, after they're either OTC ing at a discount, or they're holding for the full lockup? Like, what do you think returns are actually, like, because obviously, like, it's not like this, you know, 500 x that you're seeing on Athena after TGe. Like, you either sell at a massive discount or you hold for four years, right? So, like, what are those returns actually like?
00:42:35.474 - 00:43:00.338, Speaker A: So it's, like, extremely volatile, immensely volatile. All I need to tell you is, like, look at multicore. It went from, you know, zero to 10 billion back to, you know, not 98% down, and then run it, bringing it back up. It was down. It was down to, like, 500 million. So it was down 95% all the way back.
00:43:00.506 - 00:43:01.282, Speaker D: It's nuts.
00:43:01.338 - 00:43:03.314, Speaker A: And it's like Masayoshi sun.
00:43:03.394 - 00:43:05.370, Speaker C: It's like the roller coaster is insane.
00:43:05.522 - 00:43:35.304, Speaker A: Yeah, it's insane roller coaster. Which means that I can't answer your question because it really depends on, like, when. When do they exit? And some of them never exit. So who knows? Maybe they'll. They'll be at a trillion. Maybe they'll be back at -99 there are some vc's that take a more active approach on getting out when the market is hot and then not investing at all and waiting for things to quieten down. Personally, I think that's wrong.
00:43:35.304 - 00:43:52.844, Speaker A: There's really good deals that I'm seeing in the bull market. I think people's creative juices start flowing in the bull market. And even though a lot of it is just circular bullshit, there's some good things that come out. So we have been writing a lot of checks right now, even though it's, you know, the valuations are a bit higher. But.
00:43:56.434 - 00:44:18.094, Speaker C: Do you disagree with Arthur Hayes? Like, I've listened to him on a couple podcasts, and he's even wrote this as well. He's, like, not deploying capital in venture bets right now. He thought the time to do that was last year. And if you deploy now, basically, like, you're going to be unlocking at the absolute earliest, you're unlocking in the next theoretical bear market. Do you still think it's a good time to deploy on the venture side?
00:44:19.014 - 00:44:40.486, Speaker A: Everyone's situation is different. I try to, you know, for Salini, we're adding a lot of value. We try to add a lot of value to the projects, especially, even if they're late stage and they're going to market. So I can get flow that probably, you know, nobody else can get, because I'm really helping. Like, I'm talking to the founders, nobody's.
00:44:40.510 - 00:44:42.394, Speaker C: Flow is better than Jordy's flow.
00:44:43.934 - 00:44:47.334, Speaker D: I know, right? Marketing is. Flow is top tier.
00:44:50.034 - 00:45:25.210, Speaker A: I spent, like, my. My day today talking to all the AI founders and, like, just going through tokenomics with all of them and figuring out, you know, what makes sense in this, like, crazy AI crypto world. And I don't mind writing a check at a billion dollar valuation if the thing is, is likely to launch at five plus. So being very active right now, I'm not trying to get into, like, pre seed deals at $10 million. I agree. Like, those are not really coming by very often. So, you know, everyone's.
00:45:25.210 - 00:45:35.574, Speaker A: I mean, Vicki, you're probably seeing some interesting stuff as well. You know, going back to the distribution channel. Like, you must be getting kind of interesting looks, I'm sure.
00:45:36.634 - 00:45:54.144, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I agree with your take that, like, the later stage stuff, even though it's at a higher valuation, is probably like a short bet then early stage. I'm hopeful that, like, the EPTF being out distance in the future creates like, a super cycle effect or at least like a, you know, another bull in two years or something.
00:45:55.084 - 00:46:16.558, Speaker A: But, yeah, there is a lot of, like, bitcoin flow. I would say that's the, that's the stuff that I've done the least so far. And I, I hesitate. I love to get your guys thoughts on, like, the bitcoin ecosystem stuff. So obviously there was just stacks at the beginning, but now there's, like, infinite stuff. All right. Like, everyone's doing an l two on bitcoin.
00:46:16.558 - 00:46:35.862, Speaker A: Everyone's doing, you know, eigen layer for bitcoin. Right. Like that. That's like the bounce bit stuff. You got the. The Merlin stuff. I feel like bitcoin holders are not, like, very adventurous when it comes to, like, defi or doing stuff with their coins.
00:46:35.862 - 00:46:58.268, Speaker A: They just want to hold the asset and just treated as a macro asset. And I've been wrong so far. Like, there's much more activity, especially in Asia, China. There is, you know, attention and demand for bitcoin related products that are not just holding bitcoin. So I've been a bit surprised. Have you guys been surprised?
00:46:58.316 - 00:47:36.882, Speaker C: Yeah, I've seen a couple of bitcoin deals, but, like, 99% of deals are not bitcoin. It sort of strikes me that the bitcoin builder and developer community has sort of been pushed out from the venture space. I don't really know many funds that have deployed a ton of capital in the bitcoin space. I mean, Nick Carter was basically the biggest bitcoin only ecosystem investor to a point. And then when I think he raised Castle island ventures, he expanded to other smart contract and other layer one chains. Yeah, it does strike me like there's just much less funding in the bitcoin space. From a venture perspective, I kind of feel like.
00:47:36.978 - 00:48:06.432, Speaker B: I mean. I mean, I'm not really close to the venture side, so I'm not really sure. But sometimes it feels like the people funding these bitcoin defi l two projects, they're not really bitcoin people. It's like, eat people that want bitcoin beta that are just trying to latch onto a narrative. Maybe they can explain to their lp's that, you know, we're buying bitcoin beta. But I think, by the way, we're episode 37, which is kind of insane. I can't believe we made it this far.
00:48:06.432 - 00:48:23.444, Speaker B: But I remember maybe in the first couple of episodes I said bitcoin l two s are kind of like the cardano of this cycle. They don't really have to ship anything. As long as bitcoin's pumping, it's going to pump, right. That's kind of my view. I'm not sure if you have.
00:48:23.904 - 00:48:49.240, Speaker A: I think, like I said, I used to think that, but I don't know, maybe it's a different take. I'm starting to change my view. Just seeing in Asia and specifically, like in the chinese community, there's a lot of bitcoin love. Like OKX, for example. They're supporting all the ordinal stuff and all this bitcoin stuff. And it does feel like there is potentially a product market fit. It is there.
00:48:49.240 - 00:49:02.134, Speaker A: It exists somehow. And there is an intersection that is large enough on the Venn diagram between, you know, bitcoin people and like, you know, adventurous alt people and there is like something there.
00:49:04.034 - 00:49:04.794, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:04.954 - 00:49:06.042, Speaker A: Have you seen it?
00:49:06.218 - 00:49:31.524, Speaker D: Yeah. I think that, like, the BRC craze was very big in China. And I do think that, like, trying to find some exposure to, like, the speculative bitcoin plays, I think like runes and the upgrade there from BRCA to basically a new token standard for ordinals is going to be an interesting one. And I've been trying to find projects that are related to that.
00:49:33.744 - 00:49:42.564, Speaker B: Should we do some audience q and a before we do pasta or q and a? So spam us your questions.
00:49:43.144 - 00:50:17.444, Speaker A: There was one few minutes ago from Hammerman saying, considering NFTs haven't done anything this cycle, does it mean they're dead or does it mean that we're far from the top? They have been weak. I saw even punks, somebody. I didn't quite pay a lot of attention, but I saw posts that punks might be facing liquidation cascade because of blur loans. And potentially we might be seeing a new low on punks below 40 ETH. Justin, have you been following the punks at all?
00:50:18.144 - 00:50:31.048, Speaker C: I have. I laugh because I think every time an NFT question comes up, Jordan, you toss it my way, which I find funny. I haven't really followed the NFT space too much, you know.
00:50:31.096 - 00:50:34.364, Speaker D: You're building an NFT lending product, Justin.
00:50:34.864 - 00:50:41.034, Speaker C: Yeah, I capitulated, though. I capitulated on that now. Yeah.
00:50:42.014 - 00:50:44.286, Speaker B: He's not officially on EBTC, though.
00:50:44.470 - 00:51:26.818, Speaker C: Our platform supports seven hundred and twenty one s and eleven fifty five s as well. But we have a greater emphasis on ERC twenty s, and that's what we're building towards. Let's say that, I think, you know, I haven't followed it too closely, but I have listened to a couple commentators and podcasts just talking about this blur effect of basically, like, taking so much value out of the NFT ecosystem and like, taking value out in a masterful way. Like Blur has been the blur ecosystem, blur blended. Now, blast has been like sort of masterful at that, at financializing these things, providing liquidity and driving the floor down. I personally don't think we see a resurgence in the ten K PFP mania phase. I think things like crypto punks could do well over the long term.
00:51:26.818 - 00:52:03.580, Speaker C: But if you're talking to me, if a crypto punk is 40 ETH, I'd much rather have the 40 ETH than one crypto punk. That's just me personally, I think sort of like when you buy the crypto punk, you're taking on the risk of ETH and then also the risk that nfts go somewhere, which I don't think is a sure thing and it could outperform. I just don't see it that likely. And I do think nfts as a technology have a very bright future. Like 721s non fungible tokens is obviously important, but it's hard for me to see people getting excited about 10,000 PFP collections again, just because it's fundamentally not that exciting. Right.
00:52:03.732 - 00:52:16.664, Speaker A: I mean, it's a topic that we actually haven't touched. I mean, we talk about ETH, BTC, I feel like every couple of shows, but nfts we haven't dug into. I'm curious, like thicky and Taiki, like Thiki, what's your take on the current NFT situation?
00:52:17.084 - 00:52:20.104, Speaker D: I mean, I think my bitcoin NFts have been doing very, very well.
00:52:23.124 - 00:52:24.348, Speaker A: What is the bitcoin?
00:52:24.516 - 00:52:35.304, Speaker D: Bitcoin puppets. Like, if we bought, like, a bitcoin frog in like October of last year and it's like, up. I don't even know how much. 50 x.
00:52:35.344 - 00:52:39.044, Speaker C: How can you even say that with a straight face? Sticky. It's like this. It's so silly.
00:52:39.984 - 00:52:49.724, Speaker D: You just gotta. So the people want. I think NFTs will bottom after eat BTC bottoms. I think it's a necessary fact. It's not gonna do it before.
00:52:50.544 - 00:53:26.514, Speaker A: That's a very good point. I was thinking the same thing, which is ultimately, like, these things, our cultural artifacts and the strength of the culture matters a lot into the valuation of the things in that culture. If Ethereum ends up being the winner of the world community online, then you better fucking try to get a crypto punk because they will have this relic status. But right now, maybe not even the rocks. If Ethereum is not doing well, the rocks kind of rely on that.
00:53:28.734 - 00:53:53.960, Speaker C: Wouldn't you want the utility of ETH versus like a rock or a punk? Like, maybe these things outperform by like 10%, 20%, even 100% over the next, you know, five years over ETH. But, like, you can collateralize ETH and borrow dollars against it. You can stake ETH, you can restake ETH. It's extremely liquid. You have some sort of guarantees about risk in the future. We've got the ETF coming up. It's like the risk reward just doesn't make sense.
00:53:53.960 - 00:54:00.616, Speaker C: Like, if you're going to buy an NFT, you might as well try to gamble on the latest meme coin, right? Like, that's where the liquidity and volume is.
00:54:00.800 - 00:54:10.256, Speaker B: This is why we are nowhere near the top. Like, the top is like when Justin buys a crypto punk because he's so euphoric and he's like dunking on thickie. Like every single.
00:54:10.320 - 00:54:27.544, Speaker C: I would buy them at like a price. Like, you know, five to ten ETH. That would be like fun. But if it's 40 ETH now, that's, you know, I don't know, like 120k or 150k. Like, wouldn't you rather just have the ETH stake it in eigen layer or some restaking platform or invest in a venture deal on Echo?
00:54:28.964 - 00:54:32.184, Speaker D: You know, NFT restaking. Who's building this.
00:54:34.484 - 00:55:01.634, Speaker A: Get slashed? Like, the validator will slash your crypto NFTs are still dead. And that's kind of a good point. Maybe, you know, maybe in that culture, they've just found the product market fit with the meme coins rather than the nfTs. I mean, obviously Matt lads is doing amazing, and there's a couple more.
00:55:02.134 - 00:55:27.614, Speaker B: There's gonna be the tensor airdrop, I think, on the 8th, which might. Yeah, that's. Yeah, and like I mentioned, like, I sold my wormhole for metaplex, which is also an NFT infraplay on Seoul. So I feel like nfts on Solana can be a leading indicator for nfts on ETH, because if meme coins are pumping on Solana, then if nfts come back, they have to pump on soul first before Ethan.
00:55:27.954 - 00:55:34.734, Speaker C: Is there going to be a mantle NFT ecosystem? Are you guys building that or thinking about that at all? Jordy, is it even important right now?
00:55:35.664 - 00:56:07.374, Speaker A: I think, you know, it comes naturally, and once you build a community and it's a strong community, then. Then they're going to want to start, you know, having something represent it. I'm very much against the lame shit, I'll call it, of just copying, like a monkey, or like, you're just doing just. Just whatever Solana did last cycle, which was like, oh, there's bored apes. We'll do Solana eight, whatever. And it's so dumb. And it's the same thing with these, like, dog coins.
00:56:07.374 - 00:56:28.248, Speaker A: Like, each. You know, each thing has, like, an innu. I'm just not a fan. Even though there is a mantle inu, I'm personally, I just hate copy pasting stuff. So if there is gonna be such a thing, I would hope that it is creative and organic and not just an inu and a. And an ape.
00:56:28.416 - 00:56:28.832, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:28.888 - 00:56:42.044, Speaker C: Taiki, you famously loved pudgies. You have a pudgy. I know you have a pudgy printout of your. Your pudgy, but it looks like you've replaced the pudgy in your background with college sports regalia. Have you capitulated on your penguins?
00:56:42.664 - 00:57:00.424, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I did. I mean, my pudgy trade was actually really good. Like, I. I bought. I bought, like, two pudgies at, like, 40 and before, like, what, during blur farming. And that did really well. But, yeah, I sold.
00:57:00.924 - 00:57:29.524, Speaker C: I also, like, on this note of, like, the NFT communities, I get that they're like, the vision was like, oh, if you have this NFT, you'll be part of this community, and you'll be able to organize your thoughts and capital to, like, extract alpha and build culture. But, like, the issue is we see every time these community communities forms, they're, like, the most cringe thing that you would not want to be a part of. Like, I'll never forget the video outside of ape fest when, like, it was just, like, a bunch of dudes, like, pretending to be monkeys.
00:57:31.144 - 00:57:41.884, Speaker A: We have to bring it up now. Let's bring up. You have the whiff video. I mean, this morning, and I'm like, oh, fuck, I need to sell my bag. Like, whatever. I didn't have that much. I had some, but I'm just like.
00:57:42.304 - 00:57:43.480, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, let me grab that.
00:57:43.512 - 00:57:45.920, Speaker D: Now. Immediately, there's so many of them.
00:57:45.952 - 00:57:46.840, Speaker C: That's the issue.
00:57:46.992 - 00:57:50.352, Speaker A: The thing about Whiff, that was, like, so good.
00:57:50.528 - 00:57:55.724, Speaker B: Okay, here we go, by the way, for the audience, this is the whiff party.
00:57:57.624 - 00:57:59.484, Speaker C: At NFt NYC, right?
00:58:00.264 - 00:58:01.084, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:58:01.584 - 00:58:05.324, Speaker C: Here's another one I want to pull up as well. There's. There's so many of these.
00:58:06.544 - 00:58:26.706, Speaker A: The strength of whiff and why it was just crushing and destroying bonk and everything else, it was because it was just so clean. It. It was so pure. You know, dog with hat, you put, like an f as well instead of a th makes it quirky. And that's it. Like, you know, left curvers liked it. The right curvers liked it.
00:58:26.706 - 00:58:42.950, Speaker A: Anybody could do whatever they want. Even the mid curvers could kind of, like, do whatever they wanted with it. You can imagine it as whatever you want. There was no association with anything. It was clean. And then this thing comes out and now, like, it's no longer cool. Okay.
00:58:42.950 - 00:58:53.086, Speaker A: I don't want to. I'm sure there's people still holding. I don't want to fight anyone. But, like, whenever somebody says with, no.
00:58:53.110 - 00:59:03.286, Speaker C: But it's like that, that's what happens. Like, these communities, if they get too big, they just self destruct. Right? They get so big that they're cringe. Like, the second. It's not new, it's cringe.
00:59:03.470 - 00:59:09.694, Speaker D: It's not mainstream. You're not early. Yeah, yeah. I do think these are typically top signals for these communities.
00:59:11.794 - 00:59:17.854, Speaker C: Do you remember when people got blinded at the ape party in, like, Singapore? They use, like, dangerous lasers. And.
00:59:20.114 - 00:59:23.138, Speaker A: Miami, it was the party. Yeah.
00:59:23.306 - 00:59:24.242, Speaker C: Okay.
00:59:24.418 - 00:59:44.326, Speaker A: Yeah. Singapore is way too way to health and safety to allow that. That level of destruction to happen. We have some more questions. Let's go through them quickly. Let's do a quick fire one for ten minutes, and then we'll go to paso the week. Let's see.
00:59:44.326 - 00:59:45.394, Speaker A: Thoughts about.
00:59:48.054 - 01:00:13.984, Speaker B: I saw this really good question from f three DZ at 11:00 a.m. I don't know if you can pull it up, Justin, but question for all the lads. Question for all the lads, especially thicky no homo. What was your tipping point in your trading career, is the question. So no homo, thikki but, like, I guess. Oh, there it is. What was the tipping point of your career?
01:00:17.364 - 01:00:42.344, Speaker D: I'd say it was like, you know, having, like, good mentors and eventually just, like, finding, like, a set of, you know, iterating on a trade and just, like, making money and then, like, sizing it up and then, like, expanding that over and over again. That, um. Yeah, it takes, like, it's a really slow build up, and then it's like a, like a huge capitulation top, much like how markets look like.
01:00:44.324 - 01:00:45.060, Speaker B: Yes, I guess it's.
01:00:45.092 - 01:00:46.492, Speaker C: I wanted to build it up.
01:00:46.548 - 01:00:46.924, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:00:47.004 - 01:01:01.494, Speaker C: I wanted to highlight this comment from Chan Hong, who said, I like the. Let's. I'll never forget the way Justin pretends, like, he doesn't read comments on the live stream. For the record. Read every single comment. And I'm also the one replying to the comments. I just think, fuck the chat, fuck the listeners.
01:01:03.714 - 01:01:06.894, Speaker B: He's fighting his bags, though. He's ignoring them.
01:01:09.514 - 01:01:36.240, Speaker A: Someone says, no mention of schizophrenia poster milady and Romilio airdrop. So there's some kind of airdrop happening. We're not going to make it, unfortunately. Apparently to crypto, bro, I have never, like, dug deep into the schizo malady Romilio community and nfts. I'm not against it. I'm sort of, like, neutral. You know, I'm just kind of observing, and I think it's interesting.
01:01:36.240 - 01:01:44.004, Speaker A: It's fascinating. But I guess any of you guys ever milady or.
01:01:45.024 - 01:02:06.004, Speaker D: I have two milady's. I actually bought the top. It's like the literal top. It was when Elon tweeted it, it went to six ETH, and I was like, dude, this is it. It's going mainstream. So I bought four at 6.5 ETH, and then I came at GCR and Kobe dumped, like, a few hundred miladies into that event.
01:02:06.004 - 01:02:11.044, Speaker D: It's never. It's never recovered that ETH value, but the dollar value is.
01:02:11.574 - 01:02:17.914, Speaker A: But are you getting a schizo poster airdrop or something? I don't know. Maybe.
01:02:18.294 - 01:02:20.994, Speaker D: I got the Athena airdrop. It was a couple of grand. It was nice.
01:02:21.494 - 01:02:54.306, Speaker A: Yeah. So the founder of Athena seems to be a part of that community. The video, there was this, like, hype video with, like, the mantle Athena pendle thing, and there was, like, a malady dancing. So that seems to be kind of being incentivized. And the wormhole guys, I think they gave. There was obviously mad lads, but there was also, like, these few other collections. Every founder just kind of supports their community.
01:02:54.306 - 01:03:04.794, Speaker A: I guess their NFT community. So as long as your NFT communities have strong entrepreneurs, you know, you'll make it.
01:03:06.974 - 01:03:15.474, Speaker D: The milanese community seems like they're like terminally online and like very, what's the word? They're just like good trolls, you know.
01:03:16.494 - 01:03:20.474, Speaker C: Developers and optimizers in that chat. In those chats.
01:03:21.334 - 01:03:22.870, Speaker D: Oh, really interesting.
01:03:23.062 - 01:03:24.434, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
01:03:26.334 - 01:03:26.726, Speaker A: All right.
01:03:26.750 - 01:03:38.304, Speaker C: Any Larry from the block wants to host you at the emergence conference. Maybe we can do a steady lads live podcast on stage. We'll have to make it happen. Reach out to us, Michael.
01:03:39.844 - 01:04:05.504, Speaker A: All right. We have been talking about this audience like the pre show idea. It will be cool to do live lads on stage where we can do it at one of the conferences. So maybe token 2049 Singapore in September. We'll see if there's some other one that we might all go to, but that'll be fun.
01:04:06.324 - 01:04:19.812, Speaker C: I also see the other question we've got that is pretty legitimate is like blackrock putting real world value on chain. What does it mean? Is that important? What do you guys think this is?
01:04:19.828 - 01:04:20.700, Speaker A: The biddle fund.
01:04:20.812 - 01:04:22.224, Speaker C: The biddle fund? Yeah.
01:04:25.784 - 01:04:55.444, Speaker A: I mean, it shows their intention that they want to keep taking steps in. So, you know, my just concern is that it's very easy to do a treasury product, money market product, do that on chain. Once you start going to the next step, it becomes increasingly harder to take equities and other things as well. So it was a natural step. Obviously we have a lot of products similar to that. This is directly from Blackrock, so it's even better. And it is.
01:04:55.444 - 01:05:02.304, Speaker A: It is significant. It shows their intention. They're here to play. So I think. I think it's good.
01:05:02.644 - 01:05:24.484, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's super exciting too. It's like, it gives me a lot of hope for this space. Like, we can talk about the cynicism around meme coins, but like, it means something that Blackrock wants to and is comfortable, comfortable tokenizing things and putting them on chain, which I think is actually pretty special. Like, if someone told you that ten years ago, you wouldn't have believed it even five years ago. So I think it's pretty cool. It's a good signal.
01:05:26.144 - 01:05:27.576, Speaker B: Can we do pasta now?
01:05:27.760 - 01:05:29.804, Speaker A: Let's do it. It's time for pasta.
01:05:33.304 - 01:05:36.164, Speaker C: I can kick us off because I'm kind of on topic.
01:05:36.664 - 01:05:37.208, Speaker A: Go ahead.
01:05:37.256 - 01:05:37.924, Speaker B: All right.
01:05:39.104 - 01:06:20.954, Speaker C: So we watched the video from the whiff party and that sort of got me thinking, like, who's holding, who's holding our bags up at this party? And I saw this amazing tweet and video from our WLK, Ansem and the meme coin sector. And it's that famous video of this guy just, like, barely struggling to hold up his lady, who's, like, squatting on his shoulders. The caption is Ansem in the meme coin sector. And I thought this was so fitting after, like, the juxtaposition of seeing that with party to just thinking, like, wow. Like, how is this thing still floating? And it's Ansem doing all the heavy lifting. So this one gave me a huge chuckle.
01:06:22.094 - 01:06:29.634, Speaker B: Yeah, he's. He's been doing an amazing job at, I guess, you know, the beam coin narrative.
01:06:30.094 - 01:06:32.526, Speaker C: Yeah, I can just picture Ansem on the stage.
01:06:32.670 - 01:06:35.086, Speaker A: His cat was, like, trading at 200 million or something, right?
01:06:35.110 - 01:06:36.554, Speaker B: Like, yeah, that's crazy.
01:06:38.724 - 01:06:41.796, Speaker D: That leads very well into my pasta.
01:06:41.980 - 01:06:44.028, Speaker A: Okay, let's see. Thiccy's one.
01:06:44.156 - 01:06:58.420, Speaker D: It's in the telegram group. Yeah. Ansem's name, cat's name. They found out his name is Hobbs. They, like, had this meme coin. It's funny. It's pretty much just this thing.
01:06:58.420 - 01:07:03.144, Speaker D: How much of it thrives on Anselm being, like, a shelling point for all these legions?
01:07:05.184 - 01:07:15.764, Speaker B: Yeah. I also saw Ansem's post where someone asked Ansem for the Hobbs roadmap, and Ansem replied, dude, it's my cat. There is no roadmap. It's literally.
01:07:19.184 - 01:07:20.648, Speaker C: Oh, that's right here. Yeah.
01:07:20.776 - 01:07:24.164, Speaker B: I was like, yeah. Oh, did he say that? Oh, yeah.
01:07:26.984 - 01:07:31.564, Speaker D: That's so funny. It's even better than the original pasta. I didn't even know it was there.
01:07:32.874 - 01:07:36.374, Speaker B: Yeah. He's like, yeah, dude, it's my cat.
01:07:37.354 - 01:07:41.294, Speaker C: Are those trading alerts? Is that a government moved bitcoin?
01:07:41.954 - 01:07:46.994, Speaker D: Oh, yeah. That was kind of crazy. That was crazy from last week. I forgot that happened. Yeah, no, this is.
01:07:47.154 - 01:07:51.826, Speaker A: Have they. Have they moved it and then not sold it or what happened? Like, they just did a test transaction?
01:07:51.970 - 01:07:57.430, Speaker D: No, they moved. They sold 2000 bitcoin. Very small bucks.
01:07:57.602 - 01:07:59.318, Speaker A: They just sold a little bit of it.
01:07:59.486 - 01:08:05.394, Speaker D: They sold a little bit, but it just, like, spooked everyone because, like, you know, it means that there could sell the rest.
01:08:06.734 - 01:08:09.114, Speaker A: How much is. How much? All. How much is all of it?
01:08:09.574 - 01:08:13.474, Speaker D: Much. They may be 30,000 bitcoin. So, like, 2 billion.
01:08:14.774 - 01:08:17.994, Speaker A: Okay. I mean, I think we've had worse.
01:08:20.534 - 01:08:22.634, Speaker D: 2 billion. A bull market, nothing.
01:08:23.154 - 01:08:31.626, Speaker A: Yeah, she'd be okay. Taiki, you're saying that one ties into yours?
01:08:31.810 - 01:09:01.328, Speaker B: Yeah. I feel like we unintentionally just became the Ansem episode, but when I saw this. This was crazy. So this nft thread, or is just, like, me writing Ansem and wrote this entire thread around Ansem's childhood, how he came up and I'm like, dude, like, I don't, I don't think Anson wants this. You know, like. Like, I don't even know how they. How he found this.
01:09:01.328 - 01:09:11.424, Speaker B: Like, I feel like I'm dox and I'm uncomfortable now. You know, it's. This is. Yeah, I guess this is all. This is what happened.
01:09:11.464 - 01:09:20.764, Speaker D: People are gonna be making documentaries on, like, the Ansem phenomenon. Like, everything about, like, you know, cult leadership in an online financial world and stuff.
01:09:20.924 - 01:09:23.596, Speaker B: Yeah, documentary.
01:09:23.780 - 01:09:34.544, Speaker C: Our space literally needs it to thrive. Like, it is such a social industry, and then all of this money is just based on social consensus that we always need someone to be interested in. It's so weird.
01:09:36.564 - 01:09:51.522, Speaker A: I think, like, having. We haven't seen these in a while. These were, like, last cycle things. But remember, like, last cycle, every day would make a new one of these, like, three by three charts that we had, like, the chaotic good and the lawful bad. Yeah, I guess we had a mid curve. Justin and Jordy, whatever. At some point.
01:09:51.698 - 01:09:56.254, Speaker C: No, you were mid curve. Oddly enough, they had, like, far right curve.
01:09:57.034 - 01:09:58.554, Speaker B: I was the mid. Mid curve.
01:09:58.674 - 01:09:59.694, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:10:02.474 - 01:10:04.130, Speaker D: You're the DJ mid curve.
01:10:04.282 - 01:10:05.014, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:10:05.994 - 01:10:36.776, Speaker A: But my point is, there is a segmentation of the. Of the users. And, you know, some of them are just like, fuck everything traditional. Burn it all down. You know, just whatever happens is better than the existing things. Just like, you know, I would, I would maybe say, like, this meme coin mania and Ansem is kind of, like a little bit in that, like, chaotic, uh, direction. You know, you have your hasus on the other side, you know, trying to, like, carefully make sure that ethereum, you know, in 25 years, is still going to have the distribution.
01:10:36.776 - 01:11:17.944, Speaker A: You know, he's been talking about potentially changing the. This is what they talk about in the, in the ETH max e circles is like, do we change the emissions again of ETH like that? That's sort of. And I'm sure they're right. Like, you know, we do need to recalibrate it at some point, but. And, you know, I would say that I'm, I'm in the middle. I feel uncomfortable with the, like, if I was Ansem and somebody started betting $200 million on my cat name because I said the name, um, you know, someone's buying the top and someone's gonna lose all their money. And I know it's all fun and games at that point.
01:11:17.944 - 01:11:30.640, Speaker A: Like, no one is, like, you know, seriously expecting their investment in. In, you know, that that coin to be, like, a long term investment. But it doesn't make me a little bit uncomfortable. Yeah, the loss is still a loss.
01:11:30.712 - 01:11:32.764, Speaker C: Even if, you know, it's a joke and you're gambling.
01:11:33.644 - 01:11:57.036, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I don't mind if people gamble and lose. I've been around that my whole life, and I know that there's demand for that. People, like, learn their lesson and even more deeply. And, you know, this is kind of a bit more controversial, but, you know, as males especially, I hope there's some females in the chat. But as males especially, like, we're kind of pre built towards all or nothing. We. We're not needed.
01:11:57.036 - 01:12:33.896, Speaker A: And, like, you know, war is kind of an example where a lot of men die and, like, it's just sort of, like part of history. The reality is, like, if everybody pulls their money together and only, like, ten people win it all and everybody else is broke, the world will go on, like, you know, those ten will just get all the. All the. All the girlfriends, and we're kind of expendable. And so gambling for men is sort of like this way where we just create imbalances and there's imbalances in wealth. You know, genetically. Men are also more imbalanced in iq and other things compared to females.
01:12:33.896 - 01:12:44.816, Speaker A: So what that means is that, like, if we're all just pull our money together and one person wins it all, that's sort of part of, you know.
01:12:44.840 - 01:13:00.624, Speaker C: Arthur Hayes has proposed the same thesis, but a different cause. His, he was saying, like, we're all. We're all become such gamblers and, like, fast money people because of monetary policy and inflation. Like, when you live in a world where your currency is constantly being devalued.
01:13:03.884 - 01:13:05.956, Speaker A: Yeah. That's less like evolutionary.
01:13:06.140 - 01:13:09.504, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a contributing factor as well, let's say.
01:13:10.324 - 01:13:35.314, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I've been to Korea and I've seen. Yeah, just a lot of, like, the youth there just doesn't feel like they can make it on the ladder, so they just sort of yolo it. I get it. You know, I kind of feel. Feel a little bit in the middle and I see both sides. I'm a little bit djen and a little bit not djen. So I'll end with my pasta, which was a fun little video.
01:13:35.314 - 01:14:04.064, Speaker A: I'm probably one of the oldest people in the chat, maybe, but, you know, I actually grew up next to Tom's restaurant in New York City when I was a kid, so Seinfeld was a sort of childhood favorite. And there was the soup Nazi. So, you know, we had our amazing editor put together something really cool for puff, and we'll just maybe, maybe end the show with this steak and chill, boys.
01:14:04.364 - 01:14:17.424, Speaker D: Mine is huge. It's like this all the time. Isn't that the sefu guy? Oh, no, it is. Just be still. Not too late. I think he picked up the scent.
01:14:18.944 - 01:14:21.848, Speaker A: Hey, Jerry, I didn't know you're making a potion.
01:14:21.936 - 01:14:24.136, Speaker D: Hard to believe this guy makes the.
01:14:24.160 - 01:14:25.256, Speaker A: Best red potions, Jerry.
01:14:25.320 - 01:14:26.056, Speaker D: The best.
01:14:26.160 - 01:14:27.984, Speaker A: You know what they call him? Potionazzi.
01:14:28.024 - 01:14:34.744, Speaker D: Shh. All right. I'm not letting you cut in line. Why not? Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get potion again.
01:14:34.864 - 01:14:35.600, Speaker A: Okay. Okay.
01:14:35.632 - 01:14:36.724, Speaker C: It's great at it.
01:14:38.424 - 01:14:39.564, Speaker D: This AI?
01:14:40.704 - 01:14:41.912, Speaker A: Yeah, it's AI.
01:14:42.048 - 01:15:02.134, Speaker D: Wow, that's great. I'd like to stake 20k puff for my red potion. 30k puff for red potion. Have not cheated. I didn't get all my potion strength. Just forget it. Let it go.
01:15:02.134 - 01:15:15.464, Speaker D: Excuse me. I didn't get all my points in. You got a low community multiplier, but everyone else in the discord got a high. You want high multiplier now? Divided by three.
01:15:16.524 - 01:15:17.052, Speaker A: What?
01:15:17.148 - 01:15:35.024, Speaker D: No potion for you? That's actually very talented editing.
01:15:35.684 - 01:15:36.858, Speaker B: AI is crazy.
01:15:36.996 - 01:15:37.270, Speaker A: Yes.
01:15:37.302 - 01:15:43.118, Speaker C: I felt like my favorite show of all time. I really appreciate the meme, Jordy. You killed it. You guys killed it.
01:15:43.286 - 01:15:47.934, Speaker A: If you have, like, a good AI editor and you have a good script, they could. They can crush it. So.
01:15:48.014 - 01:15:49.478, Speaker B: Yeah, I need an AI guy now.
01:15:49.526 - 01:15:49.870, Speaker A: Fuck.
01:15:49.942 - 01:15:51.994, Speaker D: I need an AI guy. Yeah. What the fuck?
01:15:53.254 - 01:16:10.664, Speaker A: People have been asking me who it is. I'm not going to tell them because, like, even though, you know, I need to poach him. Cool. All right, all right. Chat. Let's get. Let's get a decision here.
01:16:10.664 - 01:16:16.464, Speaker A: Which pasta? Which pasta is going to be pasta of the week?
01:16:17.244 - 01:16:27.704, Speaker C: I mean, it's not even fair, Jordy, when you drop that AI generated, like, two minute advanced production value Seinfeld video. And we're just coming in with dusty old tweets that everyone saw two days ago.
01:16:30.184 - 01:16:33.200, Speaker A: Okay, we got a cat road map as well. So it's, uh.
01:16:33.392 - 01:16:38.416, Speaker B: Yeah, the cat road map is pretty good. Yeah, Seinfeld, this guy double voting.
01:16:38.440 - 01:16:39.336, Speaker D: I love it.
01:16:39.520 - 01:16:40.344, Speaker C: Double voting.
01:16:40.384 - 01:16:42.044, Speaker A: The wag me is double voting.
01:16:42.984 - 01:16:44.152, Speaker D: I think Jordy woods.
01:16:44.208 - 01:16:46.044, Speaker C: Damn, that hurts. Brain potato.
01:16:47.264 - 01:16:55.124, Speaker A: Okay, it looks like a close second roadmap, but, uh, Jody, Jordy doing pay to win.
01:17:01.204 - 01:17:03.424, Speaker C: We'll have to come back with a strong ng. Next.
01:17:04.644 - 01:17:05.824, Speaker B: I need to pay someone.
01:17:07.124 - 01:17:13.144, Speaker A: Bowden. Yeah, by next week, I think Bowden will, you know, be, like, the number one coin in crypto, so.
01:17:13.444 - 01:17:14.572, Speaker D: Really? You have any?
01:17:14.668 - 01:17:15.364, Speaker C: Buy some.
01:17:15.484 - 01:17:18.860, Speaker A: I don't have any. I stay away from. From that.
01:17:18.892 - 01:17:20.584, Speaker C: Huff is the next boat in here.
01:17:20.904 - 01:17:22.484, Speaker B: Justin, you have bowdoin, right?
01:17:23.104 - 01:17:26.604, Speaker C: Uh, I fumbled bowdoin, like, 50 x ago. I don't want to talk about it.
01:17:27.784 - 01:17:29.464, Speaker D: He's on a mental health. Go bring that.
01:17:29.504 - 01:17:30.960, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah, he's holding.
01:17:30.992 - 01:17:42.004, Speaker C: No, I'm not even kidding. Like, I literally. I bought it before state of the union. Before the state of the union, when no one had heard about this thing. Shielded to the Astaria slack and fumbled it away.
01:17:42.464 - 01:17:50.494, Speaker A: I saw, like, the. The ratio is, like, ten to one, though, between the bowdoin and the tremp. Like, the Trump coin is, like.
01:17:53.234 - 01:18:01.858, Speaker C: There'S meme coin now. Yeah, the DJT truth social stock is, like, the meme coin to speculate on. If you want to speculate on Trump stuff.
01:18:01.986 - 01:18:09.930, Speaker A: Is it like 40 billion or something? Yeah. Yes. They're saying Trump is 80 million in the chat I see here. So, you know.
01:18:09.962 - 01:18:12.526, Speaker C: All right, maybe we'll do a little logging of that.
01:18:12.690 - 01:18:15.102, Speaker A: Maybe there's a little relative value. I don't know if you can.
01:18:15.158 - 01:18:19.126, Speaker B: Relative value. Relative value.
01:18:19.310 - 01:18:22.234, Speaker A: Us government by bowdoin.
01:18:25.814 - 01:18:31.894, Speaker B: Wait, that could be, like, if Biden wanted to, that could be, like, a good way to spend capital for, like, marketing.
01:18:31.934 - 01:18:32.110, Speaker A: Right.
01:18:32.142 - 01:18:35.674, Speaker B: To empathize with the zoomers, technically.
01:18:36.214 - 01:18:47.164, Speaker A: Just like avalanche is doing with their ecosystem meme coins. The US government can buy both. Joe Bowden. That's the. That's the 200 IQ move.
01:18:47.664 - 01:18:49.360, Speaker B: That is pretty 200 IQ.
01:18:49.552 - 01:18:58.504, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. All right, thanks, everybody. I think we had a nice, long episode, and we'll catch you next week. Take care.
