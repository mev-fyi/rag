00:00:00.360 - 00:00:24.234, Speaker A: You definitely have to have kind of like a maybe contrarian sort of personality to take on these communities. I'm curious, Jordy and maybe Justin, too. Like, what was the meanest thing that, like, you know, a hexagon or a Luna said to you? So this was a good one. So Richard heart himself. The debate I had with him did not go well for him at all. He called me a Todd BoD several times during. During this interview.
00:00:24.234 - 00:00:42.900, Speaker A: And apparently a Todd BoD. Todd is like, a toddler. And it looks in this video because of the camera, that I have, like, a Todd toddler body. So, you know, the Todd bought the hexic, the hexagons took it and ran with it, and just called me Todd bot for weeks on Twitter. That. That was good. I have to give props to Richard on that one.
00:00:42.932 - 00:00:51.244, Speaker B: Yeah, people love to make fun of your appearance. I think Doe Kwan once retweeted something I said and said I was poor. So, I mean, but that was a, you know, he just said that to everyone, so that's not just me.
