00:00:20.360 - 00:00:36.954, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody, to another episode of Steady Lads. I'm very excited about this one. So to start off some introductions, I'm Jordy. I'm the CIO of Salina capital. We have Justin here, the CEO of Astaria, Taiki, the humble farmer, and Thiki from simitar. Thiki, you look a little different today.
00:00:37.814 - 00:00:39.194, Speaker B: I got a haircut today.
00:00:41.294 - 00:00:44.394, Speaker A: This is what happens when the bull market. This is bull market thicky.
00:00:45.934 - 00:00:49.674, Speaker C: His shorts get liquidated, and now he's kunti kicks.
00:00:50.174 - 00:01:11.916, Speaker A: So this is Jamo. Jamo is one of the more entertaining content creators out there. You love shitposting, and we're hoping to get some nice quotes out of you today. Jamo, are you. I mean, I know you're an ex poker player, you know, extraordinaire on that side, and you kind of switched into crypto. Maybe you can tell us a little bit how, like, your world of poker to crypto kind of collided.
00:01:12.100 - 00:01:53.144, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I got it in crypto pretty early, basically out of necessity. Like, I was mainly an online poker player and I was living in the US, and legislation called Uigea passed, which basically outlawed Americans from playing online poker. But more importantly for me, it also limited, like, the interactions with online gambling sites and my us banking. So, like, I could easily move abroad, but the bigger issue would be moving funds back and forth and having liquidity on sites without going through traditional banking. So that's how I basically got it in the crypto. I want to say, like, somewhere around 20, like, eleven, 2012.
00:01:53.144 - 00:02:21.034, Speaker B: It was just mostly bitcoin then, but I was pretty active in the bitcoin community. Like, I was posting all the time on bitcoin talk, and I got into, I feel like, quite a bit of not really telegram groups, but, like, small social groups where people, like, interacted and talked about bitcoin. I actually mined bitcoin for a while when ethereum came out. I mined ethereum.
00:02:21.114 - 00:02:24.858, Speaker A: Was that your first shitcoin, Ethereum, or did you get into, like, any of the early.
00:02:24.946 - 00:03:02.158, Speaker B: No, no, no. I got in, like, way before. I think my first big shitcoin position was a project called NXT, which was derived off the ardor protocol. This was, I want to say, 2013, 2014. And it's actually pretty sick because I thought that was fantastic technology, even to today. I think, like, the founding members are, like, I mean, like, it's defunct now, but I think the founding members were, like, Sasha from waves, Sergey from Link. I forget who else, but, like, a few other people who have left that project and have spun up their own projects, but it was like a real brain trust of people.
00:03:02.158 - 00:03:13.806, Speaker B: And it was pre Ethereum. And I think it was just like too early. It's for its time. But I feel like that was my first big shitcoin pump, I guess, before time Ethereum came out.
00:03:13.870 - 00:03:26.646, Speaker A: Sounds like Ethereum as well because you got all these founders and then they kind of split off and each one launches their own thing. Do you have a favorite Ethereum co founder coin, like Ada or Dodd or any of the other.
00:03:26.750 - 00:04:10.710, Speaker B: Long time ago, I was a big fan of archain. I don't know if you know anything about Archain, but it's Greg Maxwell's project. From speaking with Ethereum developers in the past, I was actually pretty involved in the Ethereum community just through like a bunch of my friends who were like basically on the ground floor developing Ethereum. Like, I remember one time, this was like maybe six months after Ethereum launch, there was like a conference where Vitalik and like Vlad and like a few of those other guys came to speak and no one knew who they were at the time. And like some of my friends, like, they took them out. And this is a pretty funny story, but like, if you take them out, they don't want to go to like a club, like a bar or something. So.
00:04:10.710 - 00:04:51.220, Speaker B: So what they did was that they had a meetup that there's like this. How do I describe it? It's like a kids play area where there's like a bouncy castle or like a trampoline castle. So like, that, they all went there and just like bounced around for a few hours. That was my first interaction with like a bunch of the OG Ethereum people. Yeah, I would say. So, like, from what I was told, that, like, our chain, especially Greg Maxwell, that they were developing basically a version of Ethereum, like, for proof of stake at the time, that was substantially better than like the current version of Ethereum. So I punted a decent amount on that.
00:04:51.220 - 00:04:54.884, Speaker B: Other than that, I guess I like Gavin.
00:04:55.004 - 00:05:13.800, Speaker A: Yeah, the l one s. Although we definitely want to start with, with the main topic. As you know, the Ethereum, let's say doubts and underperformance. And you have a tweet thread that. I mean, Justin, you're quite an ETH. Max, you right, like, publicly, I wouldn't.
00:05:13.832 - 00:05:32.412, Speaker D: Say I'm maxing that. Like, I, you know, in the last bull market, I was like willing and happy to try every chain. I'm also very excited, like, and love that there's other chains trying new things like Solana and Et. Cetera. You know, I'm not as interested in the EVM chains that are just sort of like forks. You know, it's. It's not that I dislike bitcoin.
00:05:32.412 - 00:05:45.956, Speaker D: I just hold. I don't hold any because I. It's not something that excites me, you know, like, all we can do with bitcoin is talk about the price, which is sort of meh. With Ethereum and other smart contract blockchains, you can actually talk about what's being built, which is a lot more exciting to me.
00:05:45.980 - 00:05:46.308, Speaker B: But.
00:05:46.396 - 00:06:05.796, Speaker D: But yeah, I am shocked by the ETH BTC underperformance and I. It doesn't make much sense to me, but I think it's. It's mostly narrative driven and that's the way things are, so I'm not too worried it. And I'm not, you know, it's not like I'm swapping my ETH to BTC right now. I think it's a little late to do that. Obviously, I wish I did a few months ago, but here we are.
00:06:05.860 - 00:06:14.708, Speaker A: I mean, bitcoin is starting to get a few, you know, other use cases, right? Like I saw there's a friend, tech fork on bitcoin. I think they're starting to put some stuff on there.
00:06:14.836 - 00:06:42.444, Speaker B: I don't know if you guys know anything about Paul Storek and Bip 300, but, like, he's building drive chains or side chains for bitcoin. So there's going to be smart contract functionality and quite a few things like token issuance, escrow services, stuff like that that you could use on bitcoin. It's in the works. I mean, the idea has been in the works forever, but he's recently got it funded and off the ground.
00:06:42.524 - 00:06:46.332, Speaker A: Taiki, would you be more interested in bitcoin if those kinds of projects start to appear there?
00:06:46.428 - 00:07:21.156, Speaker C: Yeah, like for me, I use defi, I manage my portfolio on chain. And like Justin said, I can actually use ethereum. I can actually, you know, like when I first used Aave, that was kind of like the light bulb moment for me, saying, oh, wow, like this can actually change. Like, you know, it's literally the future of finance. And, you know, bitcoin, I mean, I started out as a bitcoin maxi, to be honest, and then I slowly, you know, rotated to ether and, you know, that's kind of shaped how I started, like, to invest in the space. But, you know, there's been hype around smart contracts on bitcoin for a while now.
00:07:21.180 - 00:07:21.268, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:21.276 - 00:07:42.946, Speaker C: It's like stacks, you know, saw some pump, but even stacks, like, there's like nothing you can do. There's like one Dex, and it's purely like some like super Janky one. And if you would try to swap, I think it takes like 30 minutes to actually execute. Do you guys have thoughts on, like, these bitcoin side chain l two s? Like, do you think it's real? Or is it more like forced narrative?
00:07:43.010 - 00:08:23.484, Speaker D: Yeah, I personally think that these, like, bitcoin smart contract layers don't make much sense because they don't do anything different or add anything new. I think it's sort of similar to our chat we had a couple weeks ago about layer twos and how they can differentiate when they're all sort of the same. And like what Jordy's bringing to mantle to sort of try to differentiate. And for me, I think, you know, the same is. Is very much true with these bitcoin smart contract chains. It's like to get on DeFi right now when you're in the EVM ecosystem or whatnot, it's already quite challenging. And then to ask users to shift to bitcoin for no marginal benefit, for really just not like the opposite of improvement.
00:08:23.524 - 00:08:23.676, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:23.700 - 00:08:33.572, Speaker D: It's. There's going to be less infrastructure, it's going to be harder to interact with, slower, clunkier, et cetera, all of those things. I don't see the value prop to the user personally.
00:08:33.748 - 00:09:23.464, Speaker A: Just to take the other side, though, I mean, start starting with just bitcoin, the asset. I know it's a little bit boring, you know, you as an asset, but I don't know if it was Jack Dorsey, but there was this, like, response on Twitter a couple of years ago that bitcoin is defi. Bitcoin itself is a decentralized financial asset because as an asset, that's exactly what it is. And the benefit of having that as a native rather than on Ethereum. You can have WBTC, you're trusting bitgo, or you can have some other type of BTC, which we've seen some of them fail. Ultimately, there will probably be some better technology past Thor chain, maybe some Stargate thing where you can very easily get native swaps. And that will start to allow a bit more interaction with the Ethereum ecosystem.
00:09:23.464 - 00:10:07.908, Speaker A: But I think bitcoin is exciting in the sense of now that we're seeing wars happen and we're seeing bonds fall apart, it's an asset that starts to play a macro role. As a macro guy, I know not everybody's macro guy, but I find a little bit interesting. But regardless of, like, whether we're on one side or the other side, the price has been talking. And, man, I mean, during. I know it's the ETF and everything else, but it's been quite an underperformance for ETH, even compared to altcoins. Usually it's like, regardless of whether the curve is up or down between, like, BTC and the long tail, ETH will kind of be in the middle. You know, like if it coin season, ETH will also outperform bitcoin.
00:10:07.908 - 00:10:58.874, Speaker A: But now it's just, it's just a v shape and it feels like it's like the, it's this cartoon meme of the bell curve where if you're in the middle, you're kind of suffering. So we wanted to bring JMo on even before this all started. You've been talking about how ETH is kind of temporarily stuck in this no man's land. And I'd love to bring up this thread and ask you your thoughts. I mean, there's quite a few pieces of this thread, but this is one of the epic ones here. So you say ETH is great at times when 150 IQ people can take money from 100 IQ people, who can take money from 80 IQ people. So it's kind of like this PvP, and as long as you're not at the bottom of the barrel and all the other birds are not shitting on you, you're able to use this game.
00:10:58.874 - 00:11:05.594, Speaker A: It's kind of like playing poker and there's different stakes, but you can make money. Has that changed?
00:11:05.714 - 00:12:09.918, Speaker B: No, I think. I mean, if you guys think that the biggest use case for Ethereum, at least in your eyes, is decentralized finance, I would say that like, a majority of the profits from the freebie cycles in decentralized finance weren't real yield or were sort of fabricated out of thin air or within like a sort of PvP framework where if you're making yield that there's someone losing that yield, rather than a PvE environment where you're providing a service and other people are making that yield off the service. I'd say if you go back to the start of Defi summer, it started because the fed interest rates were zero, and then there was a huge boost in stable coins. And even if you go back to 2017, the whole ICO cycle, I feel like Defi summer was just a continuation of that, just like, redressed in the same way. Like, we called it icos back then, and now you have like, idos, ieos, launchpads, you have governance tokens. They're essentially the same thing. I mean, they're just like money printed out of thin air, given to people.
00:12:09.918 - 00:12:18.966, Speaker B: And then, like, you run incentives for, say, pool twos. And then you have, like, your. Your 50 IQ people aping into the pool twos to be extra liquidity for your, like, 80 IQ people.
00:12:19.070 - 00:12:32.924, Speaker A: Yeah, I wonder, like, taiki, like, you were. You were farming, you know, the hell out of Defi summer. Did you ever wonder, like, when you're dumping into pool twos, like, who. Who is buying, like, who's on the other side of buying some random coin there?
00:12:33.344 - 00:13:14.076, Speaker C: Yeah, like, I mean, like during the peak of the bull market, I had no idea, like, what the fuck was going on. Like, I remember I was on Polygon and I was entering these goose finance forks where if you deposit like, $10,000 into this farm, the protocol itself will take 4%, like the deposit fee. And then with 2%, they buy back the token and 2% the team keeps it. So it's like a pure farm token. But the token kept going up because people thought that, hey, this is the future of finance, even though it made no sense. So as long as you were early, the people after you, they would pay the deposit fee to buy back the token, and that would just dump the token in perpetuity and that would still make money. It was so confusing.
00:13:14.076 - 00:13:15.892, Speaker C: But, yeah, I do agree.
00:13:16.068 - 00:13:16.524, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:16.604 - 00:13:51.646, Speaker B: I got into panther swap on binance smart chain and like, I feel like, I feel like binance smart chain was. Was filled with those forks where you would have, like, these deposit fee Ponzi's for, like, in order to deposit LP, you had to pay 5% of your. Your LP. But then you were making. You're making it back if you're in early in the pools for within like a few hours. So, like, there were days where I was like, I was making like $20,000 an hour just like, staring at this, the shitty ui. Like, thinking to myself, just, this is absolutely ridiculous.
00:13:51.646 - 00:14:11.806, Speaker B: But, yeah, like, in the end, that stuff that made ETH great at that time isn't sustainable because now you have a more intelligent person that realizes, yeah, well, we can't provide liquidity in pool twos. And then we can't just like, fork a Dex fork a governance token and.
00:14:11.910 - 00:14:36.134, Speaker A: Make sure we get your thesis. So you're saying all of this defi sum or all this stuff was basically built on people bidding l two bidding, like pool two tokens. And either they're very unsophisticated or they're just trying to gamble or you know, I would say like a third category is probably VC's that couldn't get into better deals. So you know, they just had to fomo into whatever, you know, random ones. There were.
00:14:37.154 - 00:15:15.164, Speaker B: I think the thesis is basically like the, the gains that were made during this time were. Weren't gains because like the protocol Ethereum and the protocols built on Ethereum were awesome and people were using them. The gains were made because there are people less smart than you that were losing money to you. But like on face, if you provide liquidity, you don't really see that interaction. But I feel like that's only part of the thesis, like because the use cases for Ethereum like I think expand a decent amount outside of Defi. And I feel like a lot of those thesis have been invalidated as well.
00:15:15.274 - 00:15:39.720, Speaker D: I think you're sort of missing the point in my opinion. Opinion. I think you're obviously looking at what happened in the past and what didn't work then, which makes sense. But if Ethereum is a forward looking bet, right. I think in the same way that that bitcoin is. Although I think Ethereum is just sort of like a levered way to do that. You know, when I buy Ethereum, right, I'm not buying it because of like a goose fork that happened in Defi summer.
00:15:39.720 - 00:15:44.656, Speaker D: I'm buying it for what it could be in the future. Like I view it very much as a. A growth play, right.
00:15:44.800 - 00:16:11.814, Speaker A: We should definitely get into like some of the other potential use cases or Ethereum and judge those. But just to wrap up on the defi aspect and whether defi summer was just this big bubble driven by pool, two tokens or you know, I would say like the counter, the counterpoint would be that everything deflated and then we still have things like AavE, things like compound, things like light, like there are still protocols that have very high market value even after the air got taken out. You think about that?
00:16:12.314 - 00:16:47.266, Speaker B: I would, I would, I would disagree with that. If you look at any metric on chain metric, like everything is down quite a bit. Like the stable coin issuance on, on Ethereum is down like 60%. Like there's more stable coin transactions by a ton on Tron, there's, there's more USDT issued on TrON because it's, it's a cheaper chain. Like the, the curve TVL. Like what used to be like one of the biggest protocols is down 90%. Like the new daily active users is down also a lot of the liquidity still provided on chain is legacy liquidity.
00:16:47.266 - 00:17:42.454, Speaker B: For example, Uniswap still has liquidity, even though within their new version, a majority of the LP providers are actually losing money. And if they came to realize that they're losing money, they would pull the financially. They're not incentivized to provide liquidity. So, I mean, you talk about like the future use case of Ethereum, and you talk about like, yeah, sure, Aave is awesome, but you have to remember that, like, if you use Aave as an example, a lot of the initial growth of AAVE was incentivized. Like, they use their own token to incentivize new chains, to incentivize both, both sides of the borrows and lends. And when those incentives dry out, like the TVL, that the actual use to return goes down quite a bit. And a lot of the liquidity left right now is non competitive with what people could be doing with the money elsewhere.
00:17:42.454 - 00:17:48.534, Speaker B: And it's just due to like laziness or, you know, just having these legacy positions and not moving them.
00:17:48.654 - 00:18:16.638, Speaker A: What would you say? Counterargument that like, yeah, it's incentivized the beginning and so was curve and everything else, but ultimately there is a mode being built because these protocols, if they don't, if they manage not to get hacked for a long time, they kind of prove lendiness. If I have the option between like, you know, 2% yield on something that's very safe, like Aave, or like 4%, some new thing that like, has no lendiness, it might still have a moat, right? Like it could still kind of prove itself out.
00:18:16.806 - 00:19:00.988, Speaker B: Yeah. I think my position though is that like, a lot of the LP positions right now aren't like, they're, they're not really logical. So here's an example. I think there's still like $50 million in curve three pool. Three pool is USDT, USDC and DAi, the yield on that is sub 1%. Like, is there any reason for anyone to have any liquidity in curve three pool? Like, you have not only counterparty risk, you have like a protocol risk, and you're getting, you know, basically less than you would by a huge margin, say, putting it in like, Ust bills. So a lot of these positions in my eyes don't really make any sense.
00:19:00.988 - 00:19:20.224, Speaker B: So, like, I guess the bull case is that like volumes increase and liquidity increases. But I think in the future, like, if like the current state of the economics of Defi keeps up, people are more incentivized to pull their liquidity, then add more liquidity.
00:19:20.324 - 00:19:28.688, Speaker A: Thank you. Is your bookcase that we get, instead of competing with the 5% yields, we just bring them in and then we add on top of it, and that starts to become more compelling.
00:19:28.776 - 00:20:08.026, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree, jamo. I feel like the one realization I had is that DeFi products on its own just suck on chain. Native products just can't provide enough value to entice people to actually lock capital in. I think the money that's in the curve three pool, I think some of it is literally attackers that literally just deposit LP. So, like, tether can't freeze their funds. And the entire thesis is, okay, like, why would I put stable coins in this thing, earning like 7% when I can put it into t bills? And I think my bowl case for Defi potentially recovering is creating, like, real world assets or like, these tokenized treasuries, or yield bearing dollars and that way.
00:20:08.090 - 00:20:08.290, Speaker A: Right?
00:20:08.322 - 00:20:32.834, Speaker C: Like, Defi right now is like a closed load system. But if you have external cash flows coming in from off chain to on chain, then can that actually create more value? Like, you know, you can make composable smart contracts within, like, yield bearing dollars. And instead of, like, LP for Ethan, USDC on Uniswap, just like, underperforming, you can potentially lp for stake deed steak Dai. And both assets are yielding, like, what do you think about, like, your old assets?
00:20:33.254 - 00:21:13.984, Speaker B: Yeah, I like what a lot of, like, for example, the spark protocol using Dai. I like that pivot. I'm not sure if it's, like, actually very competitive, because if you think about it, like. Like, in theory, you're competing with, you know, just depositing it your money to a brokerage and buying t bills, right? So, like, let's say the fed interest rate is 5%. If. If you have a counterparty that's like FDIC insured, you also don't have, you know, smart contract risk protocol risk. Not only that, like, in general, like, these companies that are bringing real world assets to chain, they're probably going to take a percentage of the yield.
00:21:13.984 - 00:21:59.880, Speaker B: I mean, like, it's essentially that the same model is, like, what USDT is doing, right? Like, USDT is taking your money and depositing entity bills, but they're just not paying you any of the yield. So if. If a company has the same model as USDT, but then pays you a portion of the yield, it's better than like, the current system. But I'm not sure that it's actually competitive with, like, what people can do with money outside of Defi. And in addition, I feel like the crypto crowd doesn't really get excited for stuff like this. People are in crypto to either lose 100% or win 100%. They're in it for mass gains or mass losses.
00:21:59.880 - 00:22:16.564, Speaker B: I feel like it's a difficult selling point to say, yeah, you can deposit your money and then in two years it'll go up 10%. It's, in theory, great, and it's a sustainable ecosystem, but I'm not sure if it's that appealing for the crypto native person.
00:22:16.864 - 00:22:44.180, Speaker D: One quick thing I want to say about that, and then also about what you mentioned about Uniswap LP positions. Again, I think this is sort of missing the point. Like, when you provide liquidity to Uniswap, you are putting on a trade. We know that most people that trade not just through Uniswap, but most people that short term trade lose. And so people still do things that lose their money because they think they can make money. I would argue it's the same for Uni LP. If you're providing liquidity there, you're putting on a trade.
00:22:44.180 - 00:23:18.646, Speaker D: You know you can lose money, you know you can make money, but that doesn't stop people from doing it. And then, and then to your point about accessing treasury yield on chain, I think this is probably where Jordy was heading, because we talked about this a few weeks ago as well, where that risk free rate is not actually accessible to everybody. Right. It's very us centric, exclusive. And I agree with you, it's not necessarily crypto native. But I think the point of all this is to expand beyond that. If we're just thinking about how to serve the 10,000 users that are actually still on chain every day, we're sort of missing the point.
00:23:18.750 - 00:23:41.864, Speaker A: Yeah, the amount of degens is very loud and very visible. But I would say there is a lot of people that use crypto, maybe mostly just hold bitcoin and ethereum, but they're out there and they just want to have a stable, good financial savings, and they're not trying to 100 x or nothing their entire bag, even though those people are very loud.
00:23:42.324 - 00:24:30.930, Speaker B: I think that's fair. With regards to uniswap, I understand that when you provide liquidity on an automated market maker, you're setting up a trade or you're making a range of trades. But to the average person, I think, like, I mean, I don't know this for a fact, but I think a lot of people don't realize that's the case. And when they look at, like, providing liquidity that they think they're just providing liquidity and gaining fees without thinking about the, you know, the negative outcomes or else. Because, like, a lot of these positions like that are like the big liquidity pools on Uniswap. A lot of these positions don't really make sense for people to hold if they have a shorter, long bias.
00:24:31.042 - 00:25:14.764, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't want to talk out of line in terms of some of these uniswap LP's and stuff, but I heard it's not substantiated. But I've heard definitely rumors being told to me that a lot of these big LP positions are from some of the major vc's that are backing Uniswap and they're providing liquidity as part of that investment. And if they're making ten x on their investment and they're losing a little bit on Il, you know, in out of one pocket, I don't want to get too specific because nothing I can talk about fully substantiated, but we see this type of stuff as well. Right. I'll lose a little bit, but I'll help provide liquidity and then kind of show this use case.
00:25:15.424 - 00:25:58.034, Speaker B: I also think that, like, in general, talking about DeFi, um, there hasn't been much innovation that has been, at least to me, there hasn't been much innovation that has been exciting since maybe like, 2020. I mean, like, I'm just thinking about, like, the. The big. The big things that have come out this year. Like, months ago, we were talking about, like, hamster racing on chain and what was the other, like, telegram bots and, you know, stuff like that. And, like, in 2020, like, or end of 2019, we had, like, uniswap. We had, like, aave compound stuff like that.
00:25:58.034 - 00:26:26.612, Speaker B: This is stuff that, like, actually made sense and was, like, actual paradigm changers. And, like, I feel like in the past, like, two to three years, like, we haven't really had anything that really moved the needle. And most of the stuff was either, like, forks of pre existing projects with some, like, different tokenomics that made, like, the token slightly more valuable. But in general, it didn't really change much of, like, the actual protocol design or what you can do on chain.
00:26:26.748 - 00:26:35.404, Speaker D: I would totally, yeah, concede to that. Yeah. There's been very, like, almost no, zero to one s over the last two years. I completely agree.
00:26:35.564 - 00:27:18.198, Speaker A: But just to, you know, argue with that a little bit, because people often say that it hasn't been innovation in a while, and that's true. But when we look at innovation from a first principles perspective, how much is there to innovate on? Because either you put money in this box, like SBF, who's I'm hearing about the take trial now. So you put money in a box. If the box is close to the real world and you have no real world yield, which is obviously what we're trying to do now. But if you don't, then it's more, it's like the payoff function. All you can do is create different payoff distributions. So a lottery ticket, everybody puts in a dollar, and then one person wins like a million dollars, because there's a million people, that's like one payoff distribution.
00:27:18.198 - 00:28:14.084, Speaker A: And you try to match up creating value by aligning people's utility curves with their outcomes, because maybe they don't care about losing $1, but they're dreaming about the million or other people. You know, you create like these options, vaults where, oh, I'll give up some of the upside, but then I just want like a, you know, an extra yield as a covered call. You start to create like, financial products, but they're all around creating payoff functions, right? And like, creative payoff functions. And there's only so much you can innovate. I would say the only thing you can really innovate is on the entertainment factor. So things like, you know, betting on hamsters or people, or creating this like, poker element potentially, where there's some skill, there's some strategy, and people are trying to figure like, blur airfront dropping was kind of like that thing, like people were bidding on nfts they didn't want. And what do you think about innovation on that side?
00:28:14.424 - 00:29:30.202, Speaker B: I mean, I think, like, when I talk about innovation, I think it doesn't have to be, you know, like a zero sum thing where if there's no other funds coming from, from outside sources, there still can be innovation, where like, participants in the ecosystem can be putting money into the ecosystem, but deriving some sort of value outside of like the monetary aspect. And then people like, providing that service or providing like, whatever that they're able to provide with assets they have on chain or like liquidity or their time or whatever, sort of gaining, like the upside to that. So then you develop like, actual economies where like, if, like, for example, if like, block space is useful and you can do like a certain amount with like a certain amount of block space where people will come in and use that block space if you provide a service. I mean, I'm just speaking hypothetically. If I had this all solved, I'd be way richer than I am right now. But I think that these types of protocols or economies can be built on chain. But in my eyes, there hasn't been any innovation in the past few years to draw users that want to use this chain.
00:29:30.202 - 00:29:44.426, Speaker B: Outside of, like, the monetary gain, which I talked about earlier is like, mostly PvP, like the monetary gain that you make on chain right now, a majority of it is basically taking money from people who are less good at what you're doing.
00:29:44.610 - 00:30:23.374, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's bring up the top of the full tweet, because you made a couple other points that are not relevant to defi, but more broader around some of the other reasons why. Why people like to hold ETH. So you see, we're at a point where, okay, so ETH is no longer deflationary. This was something that I had predicted a while ago, and now it's coming into play where that whole thesis of ultrasound money is not that clean. So you're saying we're not at a sustainable fee structure because you're saying, like, long term, do you think with, even with l two s, like, we'll not be able to have sustainable fees?
00:30:24.594 - 00:31:48.336, Speaker B: I think the current state of Altus, they're okay, but even the l two fees aren't competitive with alternate l one s right now. ETH base layer is still, even previous to this week, its lowest fees in two years is still not competitive. I think this is a good example. So there are some protocols that are developed for, like, the dynamic ranges, like adjusting dynamic ranges on, like, the current Uniswap model. It would be basically you can adjust the range in real time in order to, like, maximize yield and also maybe like, hedge your risk on perpetuals or whatever, which makes sense for a lot of people. However, like, it's impossible to do on Ethereum right now because you'd be making like, a uniswap transaction, like every second, right? Because, like, if the price of these long tail assets move very quickly, then you're going to have to rebalance in time, whereas there's other alternate chains where this technology, in theory can exist. So I feel like there are quite a few limiting factors, even when gas rates are very low, that they're still not competitive with other chains at that point where there are a bunch of innovations that can happen, but.
00:31:48.336 - 00:32:10.780, Speaker B: Or it can happen in theory, but can't happen due to the, like, the state of Ethereum, like the way it's built, it's like a shared state machine. It's. The network wide gas is the same. Basically every Dapp shares the same gas fee. I feel like stuff like that are pretty big limitations in the overall design of Ethereum.
00:32:10.892 - 00:32:16.144, Speaker C: Are you bullish? Like, cheaper chains, like Solana? I know this Lana community is very strong right now.
00:32:16.854 - 00:33:00.318, Speaker B: I'm pretty bullish. Solana is a chain. I'm not sure about the token. I feel like the actual technology on Solana is quite good, and it gets a really bad reputation for it going out a few years ago, a few times when people were spamming the network, which was, by the way, just the easiest fix of all time, it wasn't really an issue for them. Like, they actually solved it by setting up, like, certain fee markets where if, like, one protocol uses, like, is sending too many transactions, that then, like, that's that specific sector of the chain. Like, the fees go up, whereas everywhere else it stays the same. So, yeah, I think the protocol design is very good.
00:33:00.318 - 00:33:05.382, Speaker B: It's questionable whether the value of the chain goes back to the token itself.
00:33:05.478 - 00:33:41.256, Speaker A: I'm glad you brought that up, actually, jamo, because it's. It's something that I think very few people actually make that distinction because they think, oh, yeah, you know, it's getting adoption. It's the tech, you know, I'll buy, buy the token as if, and we'll talk about this later on the episode as well. But it's this, like, assumption that the token will, like, represent the value of something or how good it is that it will. It will just intrinsically get that value and give it to you. And if it's not actually giving cash flow and it's not, you know, bitcoin type of, you know, actually actual money.
00:33:41.440 - 00:33:42.136, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:42.280 - 00:33:56.184, Speaker A: The best you can go for is what I call community money. And I want to get your thoughts on that, because something like Solana, the fees, even if you burn the fees, oh, we're going to EIP 1557 on Solana, and then we're going to burn the fees. You're paying, like, you know, fractions of, like, a millisecond.
00:33:56.304 - 00:33:56.904, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:57.024 - 00:34:17.548, Speaker A: Here and there. You're. You're not going to make 100 billion of. Of fees, even if you, you know, you waited them decades. So the concept of, like, just buying this token because the tech is good, we're not, we're not, we're not exactly, uh, closing the loop. How do you close that loop?
00:34:17.676 - 00:34:47.584, Speaker B: So I think. I think the, I think the bull case for chains like this, where that there isn't, like, um. Like, I think Solana is probably that, like, the best example, but it's chains that essentially don't charge fees therefore, like, the. The arbitration would say, well, like, the value doesn't go back to the token. If you build a chain that, like, has good technology that you can build a community around, the community will. Will build infrastructure that incorporates, like, the token itself. So, like, if.
00:34:47.584 - 00:35:35.894, Speaker B: If there are better defi protocols that can be built on Solana, they'll incorporate the. The Solana token. So suddenly, if you can hold Solana and then do, like, cool stuff on defi, it's creates intrinsic demand for Solana, regardless of what fees are paid to the blockchain. So right now in Solana, there's a whole LST movement going. Basically, it's similar to the LSD's on Ethereum, but there are quite a few different projects that are building their own versions of lsts and having small nuanced differences, and that there's reasonable amount of competition within those. And then, like, you can do cool stuff like mint synthetic stable coins against your Solana. And then you stake your Solana, you get the yield from Solana.
00:35:35.894 - 00:35:43.750, Speaker B: It's similar to, like, if you deposited. I mean, it's not the greatest example, but it's similar to if you get, like, yield off chain.
00:35:43.902 - 00:35:52.294, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's look at some of the real world examples. Have any of you guys gotten into like, trading sports cards or stamps or like, any of these kind of things a while ago?
00:35:52.334 - 00:35:57.046, Speaker B: Yeah, I traded some Pokemon cards, like, a while back, but a long time ago.
00:35:57.190 - 00:36:01.314, Speaker A: Did you do any of these, like, on chain ones, like NBA top shot?
00:36:02.134 - 00:36:15.854, Speaker B: No, but I've always had, like, a very, very bearish take on, like, nfts. And like, I feel like nfts are like the. The bane of, like, a lot of that the last cycles existence.
00:36:15.974 - 00:36:51.556, Speaker A: I have friends who are, like, really into this stuff. You know, baseball cards, basketball cards, they're like super deep into it. And I watched them over the years, and I've watched kind of like, the highs and lows. And this is a great example of something that is sort of community money because it's like in game currency, like you described Solana. Oh, you know, if they do some good games, and then the in game currency gets value just because, you know, people are playing it. It reminds me a lot of these things. And what we've learned over the years of having people try to get obsessed about baseball cards is that supply and demand rules everything.
00:36:51.556 - 00:37:15.584, Speaker A: And as soon as, you know, the creator gets a little bit greedy and starts creating more supply, the whole thing falls apart because the people who are a part of it no longer have that faith and belief in the future of, you know, if I just get the right card, I can make money. Because suddenly they're getting dumped on by like, a greedy, you know, card developer who's just flooding the market. And this happened with NBA top shot. I think that was like a.
00:37:17.784 - 00:37:49.710, Speaker B: Yeah, it was way too inflationary, right? Like, the issue is like, that there's only certain number of players in the NBA and, like, they play every day. So the idea of NBA top shot was like, you would like, forever remember a moment, but then, like, there's thousands of games that constantly get played. So, like, like, the inflation on the, I think they're all called moments right there. Um, yeah, yeah, but the, like, the inflation is insane to a point where like, it just drove it to the ground. Like, they're all worthless.
00:37:49.862 - 00:38:29.584, Speaker A: So thinking about, like, alt l one s potentially as, or even ethereum as, you know, this kind of community money, if you imagine, you know, the next few years where the supply is going to increase again and, like, people are going to get dumped on just like they got baseball cards dumped on them, that starts to, like, destroy a community, in my opinion. A community is strong when supply is limited. There's no unlocks keep happening. There's no super centralized holder that can just get greedy one day and dump it. And this is why I'm long term much more bullish on ETH than these other chains. You seem to have a counterargument around ETH.
00:38:31.364 - 00:38:34.628, Speaker B: I feel like you're underestimating the supply overhang of ETH.
00:38:34.756 - 00:38:36.848, Speaker A: Where does that come from? Because it's all unlocked, right?
00:38:36.956 - 00:39:16.384, Speaker B: Yeah, it's all unlocked, which, like, may be a bad thing, because, like, if, if it's, like, for example, if Solana is locked, you know, it's not being dumped on you. But if, like, the entire Ethereum supply is locked, I mean, just look at the Ethereum distribution, like, of the current supply. I think, like, around like 50% to 60% was sold during ICO to maybe like a couple of thousand participants. Like, the, like, 15% to 20% went to, like, vitalik and the founders and the Ethereum foundation. The business model of the Ethereum foundation is dumping Ethereum on you. That that's literally how they make money.
00:39:16.884 - 00:39:29.270, Speaker A: How much do you even have left in, like eight years in? Hasn't that sort of been. It's not as good as bitcoin, but it's gotten a distribution that is far and away compared to something like Solana or avalanche.
00:39:29.452 - 00:40:04.510, Speaker B: Yeah, sure, but I feel like, so, like, the initial distribution of Ethereum wasn't great during the 2017 ICO cycle. A lot of that distribution was consolidated into, like, now defunct projects. Like, I think there's probably, like, five to $10 billion in, like, the treasuries of, like, off the top of my head stuff like Golem, Argon. Like, essentially, if you got into crypto last cycle, you would have. Wouldn't have heard of these projects, but. But they have, like, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Ethereum just, like, sitting around. Um, Vitalik himself, he.
00:40:04.510 - 00:40:10.902, Speaker B: Even though he. He says he's not selling ETH anymore, um, he's just, like, setting up third party companies to.
00:40:10.998 - 00:40:11.374, Speaker A: To.
00:40:11.454 - 00:40:52.414, Speaker B: To sell his ETH in order to be an effective altruist or do it, whatever he's doing. Like, a lot of the. A lot of the original Ethereum people that, like, bought the Ethereum icos that they have dormant addresses, they were not participants in Defi summer, they were not participants in any of the actual on chain activity. But at some point, that's going to be supply overhang that needs to be sold. I imagine that's around 20 or 30% of the supply. Still, I understand that the distribution of Ethereum is substantially better than a lot of these 2019 vc backed layer ones. But, like, I feel like people don't understand.
00:40:52.414 - 00:41:11.986, Speaker B: People think, like, Ethereum is, like, this amazing decentralized coin where, like, there's been, like, a proper distribution of it through, like, the entire community, and there isn't, like, one big holder. Whereas, I mean, Ethereum had an ICO that they sold, like, 60% of the current supply. Like, in an ICO, a limited number.
00:41:12.010 - 00:41:19.238, Speaker A: Of people, you're agreeing that, like, directionally, it's. It is, you know, much better. But you're saying it's not that good.
00:41:19.366 - 00:41:35.630, Speaker B: You're kind of like, yeah, I think. I think, like, the. I think people underestimate the, or overestimate the difference in the impact of, like, the supply overhang between something like Avax and something like ethereum.
00:41:35.742 - 00:42:06.966, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, you make a ton of great points about the bear case for crypto, broadly, and that, like, no one wants to pay for a transaction, and if you're not paying for attraction, that, where does the value accrue? I think those are valid. I think the talking about the ETH supply overhang is a little. It applies to all of crypto. I'm not disagreeing with the thesis, but I don't think it's exclusive to ETH. I think also the same is very much true for bitcoin. The distribution is very bad. And then also like, michael Saylor is clearly someone you wouldn't want holding bitcoin over the, like Ethan.
00:42:06.966 - 00:42:21.546, Speaker D: The ETH foundation. So Michael Saylor holds about $5 billion of bitcoin. The ETH foundation holds about a billion. That was. That number is a year old. I just looked it up. And so like, if I'm looking at that, I'm seeing the same sort of problems with both chains.
00:42:21.546 - 00:42:34.614, Speaker D: And then I don't think that the soul being locked up, which I actually don't think it is, changes much. So I think all of the chains have this issue. I don't think it's exclusive to ETH or Sol. It's also for BTC.
00:42:34.914 - 00:43:24.512, Speaker B: I'm not saying it's exclusive. I actually think like the supply distribution for ETH is substantially better than like what it is for Solana. But I'm just saying that it's like, it's closer than you think. I feel like. I feel like the narrative is that like, especially with like these newer layer ones that the VC's hold all the coins and that they're either vested and like there's vesting clips and the vesting clips mean that they're just going to be market dumped on you, which I don't think is the case. And then like to contrary, the ethereum supply, I don't think it's distributed in a way where basically a majority of the supply is held by long term users that believe in Ethereum and the ethereum ecosystem. I think it's heavily concentrated to people that got in early.
00:43:24.648 - 00:43:28.504, Speaker D: Do you think bitcoin is different or it's on the same level as Ethan?
00:43:28.584 - 00:43:56.818, Speaker B: As far as that, I think bitcoin is. I wouldn't say substantially, but quite a bit different. Just because I guess there were early miners and then like the early blocks of bitcoin generated quite a few more bitcoins. But there wasn't like an ICO sale limited to like. I think it was like like 5000 wallets. But like a lot of the wallets were like Sybil wallets, but the sale is sort of.
00:43:56.986 - 00:44:35.622, Speaker D: It's sort of like, where are we at today? Like who's holding what? I mean, we can pull up the exact numbers, but I think 90 something percent of the supply of bitcoin is probably held by 5% of wallets. And the same is certainly true for ETH. And then in addition to that, you also have these sort of like forced future sellers, whether it's the EF with a billion dollars, Michael Saylor with 5 billion. So it's possible that bitcoin is marginally better, whereas like maybe 6% of addresses hold 90% of the supply. And ETH it might be seven or 8%. But I think, like, on balance they're pretty similar. That would be my guess, but we should pull up the numbers.
00:44:35.758 - 00:45:25.436, Speaker A: The distribution matters incredibly much for assets that are not cash flow generative. Like, it's not just burning fees or getting cash flows. Distribution matters a ton for the community and also for the sustainability and also for like, limiting supply. The supply of some of these l one s has killed them already and it's killed our communities in the same way as Terra had the strongest community. And then as soon as that happened in a very concentrated amount of time, where in a single week the supply washed out the community because it was infinite amount of Luna getting printed. We're seeing the slow motion versions of that with Polkadot, arguably some of the other ones. Phantom, I don't know, what's your takes on, like, things like avalanche?
00:45:25.580 - 00:46:23.892, Speaker B: It's not great. I would say that one thing I think they have going for them is that like, a lot of the initial VC funded layer ones had like pretty long term vesting cliffs and a lot of the VC's sold a decent portion of their positions that were vested at discount. So that in theory would remove some sort of the long term sell pressure. Like I was, I made a tweet that I was long dot into the 400 million or whatever it was unlocked this week just because I know for a fact that like, these VC's were. Had been selling their allocations for like a past year and a half. And like a lot of the centralized entities like Coinbase or whatever that listed dot that had these positions would be like very slow moving. Like, I don't see a guy at Coinbase like looking at a timer and waiting for the dot unlock in order to dump their position.
00:46:23.988 - 00:46:42.248, Speaker A: So, demo, you're already. You're already trying to win DJ of the week. You're. You're long into a 400 million unlock. I don't know if we're even going to be able to beat that later. We'll see. I want to quickly pivot to some of the non elite one ideas.
00:46:42.248 - 00:46:54.644, Speaker A: Do we think there's anything good on things like Link? I know you had a tweet out. You don't seem to be very, very happy with link marines. Jamo, is it the community or is it the project that gets to you?
00:46:55.304 - 00:47:38.680, Speaker B: It's the community. It's the community. And specifically the thought leaders in the community that I feel are super, super toxic because in their eyes, in my eyes, Link. Although they offer some other services, like 98% of what they do is provide price feed oracles. And if you say that to someone who is like a link marine, they'll be like, oh, you don't understand link. We actually do seven different things and stuff like that, which is fine, whatever, maybe you do, but for the rest of us who don't use any of those other services, you're essentially a price oracle feed. But like the biggest problem I have with them is the community.
00:47:38.680 - 00:48:34.742, Speaker B: I don't even know how this community came about because like normally these communities are limited to like meme projects for like, you know, everyone wants to pump a token. But like a majority, I feel like a majority of these people that are holding this token don't actually use any of the services that Chainlink provides. Like even they probably don't use like something like GMX or something that like a borrow lend platform that uses Oracle pricing that they're just like holding this token and just being angry about it on Twitter. And then there's a whole community of people that basically will shit on any other project that is competing with link for no other reason. Like for example if a protocol gets exploited and they're using like a non link oracle, like the first response is oh, you should have used Chainlink instead of figuring out why the exploit happened and if it was related to the oracle pricing at all. And the whole thing is, it was like absolutely ridiculous.
00:48:34.878 - 00:48:49.974, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the same for the ethereum community too, right? I mean, like after the top it was like, oh, like, oh, avalanche is a fork of guests. Like it's useless. Wouldn't that say, like, wouldn't you say like that's like a good characteristic of a strong community. And if you view these coins as.
00:48:50.014 - 00:48:51.974, Speaker A: Community money, like meme coins or however.
00:48:52.014 - 00:48:59.924, Speaker C: You know, like label it maybe. I mean, yeah, like what do you think about I guess like these top coins, quote unquote toxic communities?
00:49:00.084 - 00:49:05.404, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess it's all right. But I don't really view Link as community money.
00:49:05.484 - 00:49:05.748, Speaker A: Right?
00:49:05.796 - 00:49:37.254, Speaker B: Like the bull case for link is they're going to provide these services and they're going to have like some sort of fee switch where like you're required to use link, their native token to pay for their services. Like I feel like if you talk to like the people within link they're not going to tell you, like we're building up a meme community to, to have this community money to pump our token where people are, like, dressing up like marines and, like, running around in a circle, like, shilling the token. Like, I don't. I don't think that that's, like, the goal of the project.
00:49:37.594 - 00:49:51.854, Speaker D: I totally agree with you on this point. Like, stocks, like, look at Home Depot. There's no home Depot community. Like, people are just buying because the company makes money and they're gonna profit. There's. You know what I mean? There's, like, there's no Samsung community. Apple community.
00:49:52.184 - 00:49:56.128, Speaker A: There is an apple community, and there's a Tesla community, and there's a Gamestop.
00:49:56.216 - 00:50:15.224, Speaker D: There is a Tesla community. I'll give you that. But, like, at the end of the day, people are actually buying these things for future cash flows. Whereas, like, I totally agree with you, jamo, that, like, that is not what's happening in crypto, which I don't think is good. Like, I don't think link should have to have a community to do well. I think it should just do well because, like, the project makes money, right?
00:50:15.344 - 00:50:25.058, Speaker B: Yeah, the project is good. It's providing services, and they'll eventually be able to monetize the services and drive value back to the token. I feel like that should be the bull case of link.
00:50:25.186 - 00:50:47.036, Speaker A: I mean, it is, like, the best and worst thing about crypto, that there's a lot of unsophisticated people that are participating. You know, they're not finance Wall street types. By that, I mean. And so things like narratives matter more than they would in financial world, and so, yeah, like, something bad happens, there's people trying to make a narrative out of it. Oh, you should have done this. And then you might. My thing.
00:50:47.036 - 00:51:09.124, Speaker A: You should have done my thing. My coin would have saved you from. From this thing. And then you have, like, things like the token switches. You mentioned a token switch, and I'm starting to get a little bit aggravated with projects that don't have token switch, don't have value accruing. And then the worst part that's starting to really get to me as an investor is when there's, like, an equity portion. Like, we're seeing that with uniswap.
00:51:09.124 - 00:51:30.980, Speaker A: Obviously, right now, they're starting to charge for the front end, and that goes to equity holders, which apparently the employees are equity holders, so they're incentivized on that side. And then the rest of us who just got some tokens because we, like, you know, the idea of the project that we bought into the hype. We're governing. We're governing.
00:51:31.092 - 00:52:18.282, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree with that. Like, I feel like 90. Like, somewhere between, like, 95 and 99% of, like, the tokens we have right now, if you look at, like, what they're used for and, like, with their bulk cases, they're, they're overvalued. I mean, like, I think uniswap is a good example. Like, it's been like, three, almost four years since, like, the tokens released. Right? And, like, the theory was, I mean, like, initially they said, like, they were going to turn the V switch, but they wanted to get around, like, security laws, but eventually they'll be able to do it. And, like, we're at, you know, like, the, the 80th protocol upgrade where they're introducing regional censored front ends, a fee switch on the front end, and yet still absolutely no value goes back to the token itself.
00:52:18.378 - 00:52:44.114, Speaker A: And it's sort of crazy, the idea of not being a security. I mean, I've said this, in 2021, these things are securities. We want them to be securities. We want them to accrue value from the work that's being done by the people around it. Yeah, we need to modernize securities laws that it does allow these transactions to take place in some manner, because if they're not securities, then they're just meme coins, and we're being forced, useless meme coins.
00:52:45.374 - 00:53:10.290, Speaker B: I feel like it's just a justification for projects to have a reason to provide no value for their token. Because if they can justify it by saying, if we do this, we'll get in trouble with the law, because it's a security. We provide value for the holders, but we don't want to, you know, do anything illegal, so we're just going to provide no value. It becomes a sort of plausible excuse for them to do what they're doing.
00:53:10.442 - 00:53:46.554, Speaker D: It's brilliant. And also, I mean, just turning on the fee switch, right? Like, no one from the team has to even vote on this, right? Like, they can just let, you know, the community approve it. But I do wonder, and I'm, I want to ask you guys this, like, let's assume we live in this great world where the SEC allows tokens to be securities. There's no legal cover value can accrue to the token. The fee switch goes on. I still don't necessarily think that Uniswap Labs is now incentivized to monitor, like, to drive value to the token versus their equity, because, you know, the, the insiders hold 100% of the equity in a much smaller portion of the token. So there's still going to be that bad incentive split.
00:53:46.554 - 00:53:55.094, Speaker D: Um, unless maybe the SEC and Congress comes up with great regulations where you can't do both, you can launch a token and that's your equity or, or not.
00:53:55.764 - 00:54:23.994, Speaker B: I feel like that may be true, but at least at that point, the incentives are a little bit aligned because doing basic stuff to improve the protocol, to bring new users to increase volume, will increase the value of the equity, but also increase the fees paid to the token. So at least in that case, the incentives are a bit in line, whereas now Uniswap Labs has no incentive at all besides maybe having uni in their treasury to add any value to the token.
00:54:24.074 - 00:54:56.034, Speaker A: I mean, I think financially what you can do is just have some inflation, 2% inflation that goes to the team or whoever's providing value. And I've been seeing this controversially around bitcoin as well, that I'm a bit worried once the rewards go away, the block rewards go away because we do want to have a little bit of inflation to align incentives with whoever's supposed to be providing value to maintain the thing. And that's a way potentially for a core team to just, even if they don't have tokens, they just get some 2% new token. And that's a nice way it can happen.
00:54:56.454 - 00:56:26.930, Speaker B: I feel like that's a pretty big criticism of bitcoin is that like, the block having and the rewards in the future, because it's a proof of work chain, it won't be able to sustain the network security, which is why I'm bullish or at least investing in or pumping stuff that uses bitcoin outside of, like, peer to peer transactions. So, like, stuff I talked about earlier, the bip 300 side chains, but, but also stuff like the nfts on bitcoin, whether it's like stamps or ordinals or stuff like that, they intrinsically add value. And, like, one thing I hate about the bitcoin community is that there are like, people who are against this because they, they consider it network spam. They think that, like, bitcoin should be pure. And if people are like, fucking with, like, the witness data on bitcoin, even though that they're paying fees to the bitcoin network that, you know, incentivizes miners, incentivizes network security, it's like a little blip on their radar that like, they get annoyed by and they want to like, censor these transactions and stuff like that. So, yeah, I feel like bitcoin could be, you know, in a much better place right now if it wasn't for, like, the blockstream, like, Luke Dash and, like, a lot of the original bitcoin developers that are so, like, indoctrinated in their ways of their idealistic belief of bitcoin without let, like, letting it evolve and be more pragmatic.
00:56:27.002 - 00:57:01.664, Speaker A: I mean, it's a thing in crypto in general because it's such a new asset class, and all these dynamics and the game theory of it is so untested and on. It hasn't been solved. Right. So people have completely different ideological positions and big blockers, small blockers, you know, they want to, for, over time, things get proven right and get proven wrong, and eventually, hopefully, we'll get to some clean equilibrium. But with that, let's go. Let's go to our kind of closing segment, which is Djen of the week. So, with Jamo here, I'm already a bit worried.
00:57:01.664 - 00:57:15.678, Speaker A: He's been longing into 400 million unlocks, so we might have a hard one to compete with. But let's see. How about you, Taiki? What have you been degenerating during this sudden bull phase?
00:57:15.846 - 00:57:55.794, Speaker C: Yeah. So, unfortunately, I feel heavily underexposed BTC. But I do kind of agree with, like, I don't really see, like, a reason to hold it. And I've been allocating a lot more into tokenized treasury projects, RWA, that sector, and I actually hold, like, almost zero cash right now. I've been, like, Max deployed into maker, Kanto, and FXS, and, you know, I'm just, like, letting the thesis play there. I get a lot of pushback whenever I post about it, but it makes me think that I'm early. So, Max, long rbas, a third each or, like.
00:57:55.794 - 00:58:09.694, Speaker C: Like, mostly, like, half of it is, like. It's, like, mostly maker and then a big bag canto and then a smaller bag of FXS. But just. Yeah, like, betting that we're still early. Innings of, like, you know, dollars being yield bearing on chain.
00:58:09.814 - 00:58:17.894, Speaker A: Well, it's good that the humble farmer is. Is not just in cash, but, yeah, in terms of Djinn. Okay, that's. That's a. That's a generous four out of ten.
00:58:17.974 - 00:58:18.594, Speaker B: So.
00:58:19.134 - 00:58:20.448, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:58:20.606 - 00:58:25.484, Speaker D: Tyke, you might lose your streak of winning our last segment for the last few couple months, right?
00:58:25.564 - 00:58:29.428, Speaker C: Yeah, I lost last week, too, but, yeah, it's my. My winning streak is definitely.
00:58:29.476 - 00:58:31.304, Speaker D: I don't know if I've won a single one.
00:58:32.724 - 00:58:34.660, Speaker A: Let's see. Maybe today's the day.
00:58:34.852 - 00:58:53.414, Speaker D: First of all, I mean, I have to say I've been wrong for the last year. You guys have totally been right. ETH has underperformed. I've basically been all, all in, just ETH for my crypto portfolio, although I tried to mix it up this week. You know, I love Jordy. Jordy's great. We all love Jordy.
00:58:53.414 - 00:59:13.512, Speaker D: He's working on mantle. I'm super excited about what they're building. So I moved a portion of my ETH to mantle. I borrowed against ETH, swapped that ETH to mantle, ate like 2% slippage and I basically shorted ETH, longed mantle, right. So I didn't short the dollar. Now Jordy is doing great work. Mantle's going up in price.
00:59:13.512 - 00:59:40.468, Speaker D: I think it's up like 25% from the day I bought, but it's down in ETH. So I got spooked when Btc pumped and ETH went up, you know, just a little bit. I swapped my mantle back to ETH. I ended up just about flat even after eating 2% slippage or whatever each way. And, you know, I sort of learned my lesson. I'm not much of a trader and I've been wrong the past year with ETH. So that, that's what I got.
00:59:40.636 - 00:59:47.364, Speaker A: You did say something that caught my attention, you know, 2% slippage each way. That is Degen. You're bringing back whole market of paying.
00:59:47.404 - 00:59:47.984, Speaker B: This.
00:59:50.084 - 00:59:56.140, Speaker A: Is pretty good. This is like a seven out of ten alone is like fantastic.
00:59:56.292 - 01:00:14.830, Speaker D: And the first time I swapped, I didn't set slippage to 0% on uni. I screwed up. I set it to like five bibs or something. So I lost a good bit on that too. I learned my lesson though. I used the flashpots RPC end slippage to zero when I swapped out. So I'm good now.
01:00:14.830 - 01:00:20.334, Speaker D: But it took, you know, it takes time to learn these things again. You know, I haven't like swapped on uniswap in so long.
01:00:20.494 - 01:00:21.654, Speaker A: Jmo, anything.
01:00:21.694 - 01:00:37.036, Speaker B: Degen, um, on the crypto side of things, I talked about it a little bit before, but I long dot into a pretty big unlock. But like the funding rates were pretty favorable on my end. Um, I've been pretty heavily long.
01:00:37.180 - 01:00:38.252, Speaker A: How did it turn out?
01:00:38.348 - 01:01:13.000, Speaker B: I profited quite a bit, but I don't know if like I was actually correct because it was at the same time of like the big bitcoin move and usually like the like smaller layer ones. Sort of follow bitcoin whenever bitcoin moves. Um, it didn't outperform bitcoin, but it went up versus USD, which was like my position. Um, I've been longing Solana a decent amount, although I closed out most of it, um, recently. Uh, been pretty heavily long. Uh, I guess short, uh, ETH versus bitcoin. I guess I've had that position for a while.
01:01:13.000 - 01:01:31.340, Speaker B: Um, although the problem, the problem I have is like, I, I can't get rid of my ETH. Like I, I always have just like a ton of ETH. So I'm always net long ETH no matter what. Like, I just have, you know, ETH here, ETH there. I'm doing something on this chain that.
01:01:31.372 - 01:01:33.744, Speaker A: Sounds like a pretty first world problem.
01:01:35.084 - 01:01:36.780, Speaker D: I'm overflowing with ETH.
01:01:36.932 - 01:01:38.604, Speaker A: I just kind of throw it out the window.
01:01:38.644 - 01:01:39.684, Speaker D: It just comes back in.
01:01:39.724 - 01:01:40.624, Speaker A: I don't know.
01:01:42.524 - 01:01:43.812, Speaker D: If you don't know what to do.
01:01:43.948 - 01:02:12.232, Speaker B: I'll give it to you. The bull case for ETH is that I just have it around everywhere and I can't seem to get rid of it. So it's. There isn't much cell pressure coming from me. Yeah, yeah, I've been, I've actually, I've actually been de jenning pretty hard into mantle and mantle ecosystem stuff just because, like, I like Jordy, I like the people involved with the team. So. So I've been aping in a few, like, kind of suspect, like, sub seven figure TVL protocols.
01:02:12.232 - 01:02:20.482, Speaker B: Did you just see what's going on there? Not sure exactly how they work or, you know, if they're rugs or who's behind them.
01:02:20.618 - 01:02:34.322, Speaker D: I just have to point out how ironic this is, where, you know, 40 minutes ago you were saying how no one's doing any of this stuff anymore. But here you are, you're buying mantle. You're deploying to seven figure TVL mantle protocols. There's demand out there for on chain.
01:02:34.378 - 01:03:16.518, Speaker B: I'm telling you, it's basically just me. I think, I think I'm the only one out there on the Mantel streets. Like, I don't want to dox my addresses, but I remember deploying in one pool and I look, I didn't look at the TVL but I looked at the protocol TVL but I didn't look at like, the pool TVL and it was like 100% APY and I ape in some and then like, I refreshed the page and it was down to 4% APY. I'm like, that's not great. But other than that, I have like one of the bigger. No, no, it's probably the biggest sports bet of my life. I bet my buddy, high stakes cap, uh, notorious crypto trader.
01:03:16.518 - 01:03:38.590, Speaker B: And there's a boxing match. Uh, Francis Ninganu, who's not a boxer, versus Tyson Fury, who is like the best heavyweight boxer, like, in the past decade. Um, I laid pretty big odds, but I have, like, a high six figure amount on Tyson Fury, and I hope I don't lose that. That would be, that'd be kind of brutal. So that's kind of be gen on my part, I guess it's like a.
01:03:38.622 - 01:03:43.144, Speaker A: Mayweather versus, uh, versus irish guy.
01:03:43.884 - 01:03:58.924, Speaker B: I think it is. I think it is. Although the odds were, like, a little bit worse here. Like, I got him. I had to lay around like six and a half to one. Although, like, if you bet on a sports book, it's almost like 15 to one now. So I got it in good.
01:03:58.924 - 01:03:59.980, Speaker B: But you're sweating.
01:04:00.052 - 01:04:00.812, Speaker C: You're sweating.
01:04:00.948 - 01:04:02.748, Speaker A: Is he a MMA fighter?
01:04:02.916 - 01:04:09.240, Speaker B: Yeah, he's an MMA fighter? Yeah. I don't see how he wins, but, you know, anything can happen.
01:04:09.372 - 01:04:16.384, Speaker A: All right, well, that's you to the safe side, so that's not that degen, because, you know, if you took the other guy, you took the world champion.
01:04:16.544 - 01:04:17.952, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:04:18.048 - 01:04:23.284, Speaker D: We'll have to revisit it next week and maybe pull up a highlight of the fight. If someone gets knocked out or something.
01:04:25.264 - 01:04:29.200, Speaker B: I'm not coming back. If I lose that bet, bad luck. Here.
01:04:29.392 - 01:04:33.124, Speaker A: I'll have to put Jamo's face on top of Tyson Fury if he gets knocked out.
01:04:34.344 - 01:04:35.656, Speaker D: Do you have something Jordy or.
01:04:35.680 - 01:05:23.270, Speaker A: No, I don't know if it matches JMo, I think, you know, I'm always watching the Koreans and I love their djenness, and I noticed there was a huge, huge mina pump. So Mina is this like, alt l one privacy ZK with like, an ultra light block block size that's been around a long time and hasn't been doing much. There hasn't been much that's been able to build on there. But, you know, this week it went down. People couldn't transact and Koreans love it. Like we talked about before, when you close the doors and nobody can send coins freely, they start shipping it up. And it went from, I think, like 30 on some of the korean exchanges, and even on binance, it went up to a dollar, so it went up hundreds of percent.
01:05:23.270 - 01:05:40.456, Speaker A: So I went full max. Long as to what I kind of hit, like, the exchange limits. At some point they cap you on the amount of open interest. Around like 90, 90 ish cents. Just kind of waiting for. I knew at some point they would fix this chain. The coin, it was very bullish because the coins couldn't move.
01:05:40.456 - 01:05:54.416, Speaker A: They're all stuck, so nobody could do anything. But as soon as there's free transactions and yeah, that worked out pretty nicely. It's been down to the sixties now, so it was a profitable legion play.
01:05:54.600 - 01:05:55.464, Speaker C: You went Max short.
01:05:55.504 - 01:05:59.556, Speaker A: You mean, you said Max long, max short, max short. Yeah.
01:05:59.740 - 01:06:06.308, Speaker B: I think the same thing happened to Aptos like the past week. Right. The chain went down for like 6 hours or something.
01:06:06.436 - 01:06:33.944, Speaker A: Yeah, this was longer. You really couldn't get coins in, I think for, you know, almost twelve to 18 hours. And the funding rates obviously, you know, this is how they kind of get you when you're trying to short. They start by saying, okay, 2% max short. And then in the middle of the window they increase it to like 3%. And then they say, okay, it's 4%. And then they say, we're moving it from eight when eight hour window to four hour window.
01:06:33.944 - 01:06:52.992, Speaker A: So you go from like paying like, you know, 50% APY to paying like 500% or, I don't know, it's like 1200. The APY is very high on these shorts and it feels like changing the, changing the rules, like in the middle of the game, which is a bit annoying, but you know, that's the price you have to pay sometimes.
01:06:53.048 - 01:06:53.568, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:53.696 - 01:07:05.768, Speaker A: So I would say Jamo as a guest, even though I feel like, you know, Justin with the slippage and I took a pretty, pretty large funding rate to try to short this thing. But you are the dj of the week, Jamie.
01:07:05.856 - 01:07:06.764, Speaker B: Let's go.
01:07:08.264 - 01:07:18.344, Speaker A: Thanks for joining us. It was a pleasure and hopefully everybody else enjoyed it. And yeah, follow Jamo at Conti cakes. He's very entertaining. He has his own podcast as well.
01:07:18.424 - 01:07:33.976, Speaker B: Yeah, we actually have some. I feel like I should show my own podcast here. I do it just for fun. Like, I'm not selling anything there. Like, I just know a bunch of people in the crypto space that are interesting and it's like nice to record stuff and talk with them about.
01:07:34.040 - 01:07:38.768, Speaker A: And I saw you did a, you did one on the trial with Zane. Zane from FDA.
01:07:38.896 - 01:07:44.552, Speaker B: Yeah, we got my buddy Zane Tuckett, who is head of institutional sales at FTA.
01:07:44.688 - 01:07:47.464, Speaker A: Any, any highlight you could, you could share from that interview?
01:07:47.584 - 01:07:51.884, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't, I don't want to reveal too much, but let me think.
01:07:53.064 - 01:07:55.800, Speaker A: How about those tie hookers? Were they, were they really tight? Hooker?
01:07:55.912 - 01:08:33.778, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah. So, so the story about like the whole, okay, x trade where Almeida was buying up like the locked. Okay, x balances or Zane actually corrected me and said that that's not exactly what they were doing, but somehow they had, like, a billion dollars locked in accounts on OKX, and what they tried to do was make UKYC accounts. And it came out in the court that it was. They were hiring, like, thai prostitutes to do the KYC to be the counterparties of the trades, to move the funds out. But Zane told me that they were indonesian and only a few of them were prostitutes. Like, a lot of them weren't actually prostitutes.
01:08:33.778 - 01:09:12.554, Speaker B: So there's a little bit of, like. Like, embellishment going on in the. The SBI case. Sounds like I'm recording another one tomorrow with Athena, which is the dragonfly capital and Arthur Hayes funded new stable coin project, where they're basically creating a delta neutral Ethereum vault by depositing a certain amount of ethereum on light Oste and then shorting the perpetuals and issuing stable coins with real yield on there. So I'm going to interview them about how their protocol works and what they're looking to do. So I feel like those are going to be out in the next week or two.
01:09:12.634 - 01:09:18.354, Speaker A: Awesome. Cool. Well, hope everybody can enjoy those as well. And thanks for joining us. See you next week, guys.
