00:00:00.320 - 00:00:16.118, Speaker A: Put up this tweet of someone whose life is being affected by. Every weekend, I told my friends, guys, I can't go out. I'm reading the chain link white paper. You don't understand. Chainlink is going to tokenize the entire world. But everything is a joke now. I've wasted seven years.
00:00:16.118 - 00:00:22.038, Speaker A: Think you destroyed crypto. So, Justin, there's people that are feeling your pain.
00:00:22.166 - 00:00:34.424, Speaker B: I mean, it resonates so well, right? It's like, you try to do the right thing, you spend your time, you studied, right? You read the white paper cover to cover. Probably only five people in their lives have read the chain link white paper, and it was all for nothing.
00:00:54.684 - 00:01:16.884, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody, to another episode of Steady Lads. No, thank you. Today he's trading the tumultuous markets, which we'll get into, but we do have a special guest. So joining me and Justin and Taiki is gord, one of our, I would say, all time pasta meme producers. Gord, how are you doing?
00:01:17.544 - 00:01:27.822, Speaker C: Great. Thank you for having me on. That's quite generous to say that I'm one of the all time favorites, but I appreciate you guys welcoming me.
00:01:27.998 - 00:02:02.188, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think we can kick off with markets, but you always have commentary that's relevant to markets and it's relevant to the happenings of the day. That cuts pretty deep. So what we'll try to do is intersperse some court tweets as we talk about what's been happening in the last days. I mean, the immediate thing, of course, is just the price action has been choppy, choppy af, which I'm not too surprised. It feels like summers are generally like that. You know, this, this circle where you have the.
00:02:02.188 - 00:02:11.244, Speaker A: We're so back. It's so over. We're so back. So over. Feels like this week it's just accelerated even more. And these things are just like every day now. It's not even.
00:02:11.244 - 00:02:47.794, Speaker A: You don't have to wait for the next change in sentiment. So, you know, our last, our last podcast was called all time highs incoming, which, you know, the data that came out and everything over the next days didn't work very well. So we were back at the, at the lows of the range and then, you know, CPI came out a while ago, better than expected, and then we're back to the races and, you know, FoMC. So we're kind of like, how do you stay sane, gord? Do you, do you, uh, do you trade much during this action?
00:02:48.094 - 00:03:14.180, Speaker C: No, I really don't. I'm actually quite a bit less active, like I would not consider myself a trader, to be honest. Uh, I mean, I stay, you know, relatively up to date with the market just because I'm constantly on crypto Twitter. But this isn't something that I actively trade in and out of, you know. Um, so I'm like, I'm definitely not someone drawing lines on charts like that. That's not my thing. I'm never going to have, like, an edge there, I don't think so.
00:03:14.180 - 00:03:18.664, Speaker C: I usually stay out of this stuff and defer to the people who do draw the lines on the charts.
00:03:19.164 - 00:03:49.122, Speaker D: Yeah. One question I have for Gord is, no, I love your account. I think I discovered you relatively early. Like, a few thousand followers, and your tweets are such bangers. It's, you know, just giving commentary around, like, just, I don't know, like, just cringe eat culture. Like, are you, like, a bitcoin maxi, or, like, you know, I'm sure you have, like, some core holdings in, like, the majors and whatnot, but, like, what is your market view? Like, are you more bullish eth bitcoin? Um, yeah, just those questions.
00:03:49.298 - 00:04:31.866, Speaker C: I'm definitely. I would I say I lean bitcoin maxi, but that's, like, uh, I think that my portfolio is primarily denominated in. In bitcoin. But perhaps if. I suppose if all coins did, like, greatly outperform bitcoin, I may have a higher net return as a result. So I don't know if that gives any context. I'm not going to go into too much of my bags, but, yeah, I think that I started mainly as somebody who was a bitcoiner first and foremost, and then gradually started degenerating and defi and doing all this farming and stuff.
00:04:31.866 - 00:04:55.254, Speaker C: And I never really paid attention to how any of it worked, you know? And, like, it was almost like, I joke about this. Like, if you. If you actually spent time, like, looking into how any of this stuff worked, like, you were gonna, you know, you were gonna get diluted in, like, some pool two or something. Like, the key was just, like, ape in first and then figure out how it works later. So then come, like, bear market. I started actually, like, all right, it's like, so what have I been doing for the last year? You know, like, degenerating crypto. And that's when I started.
00:04:55.254 - 00:05:10.012, Speaker C: Yeah, that's when I started my account. And so that's, like, maybe some of the context. And, yeah, I do probably troll more about ethereum, but, like, maybe some people know me as being kind of, like, a subtle bitcoiner underneath the hood.
00:05:10.188 - 00:05:54.326, Speaker A: Well, let's bring up the bitcoin chart and see how your favorite coin is doing lately. So it is, I mean, as we can see, still near the all time highs, despite all the doom and gloom that we see, because altcoins are down, some of them are down a lot. Get into which ones. But you can see bitcoin is still, I don't know if this is a double top kind of, like, situation or what's happening, but we are mathematically just near the all time high here. You know, being denominated in bitcoin. It's probably not working out too badly compared to the rest of the timeline, which we'll get into some of the stuff going on. I see there's, like, a Twitter spaces right now talking about handsome versus tate.
00:05:54.326 - 00:06:22.664, Speaker A: These guys are not even on it. It's just people commenting on them talking to each other in a very, you know, macho, let's just say, like, Internet big boy kind of way. Yeah. You know, maybe, like, the part of the over the cycle where we need entertainment is kicked in. There's, like, over a thousand people talking about Ansem versus Andrew Tate here. What do you, what do you make of this, this current meta going on?
00:06:23.404 - 00:06:51.634, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think it's like, it doesn't. It seems we're really in, like, some pretty degenerate stages right now. Like, I'm. This is not particularly encouraging watching this play out. I don't think. Yeah, I don't know. Like, I've just started following this, like, last night, obviously, and it, like, right when you think that we can't go to, like, lower lows in terms of, like, the depravity of this culture, like, we somehow, like, just become more and more degenerate.
00:06:51.634 - 00:07:03.570, Speaker C: So, um, yeah, I don't. Like, I don't have, like, I mean, I don't have any, like, strong beliefs that probably not everybody else has. Right. That, like, is, you know, a decent human, like, looking at a lot of the stuff that's occurring. But, yeah, it's interesting at the very least.
00:07:03.642 - 00:07:21.308, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I. Something that I feel strongly is that, you know, if you don't love this space, then you don't understand, like, why it's needed. You don't understand the macro issues that exist in the world. But if you don't hate the space as well, like, you. You need to have both love and hate for the space. Otherwise your eyes are not open.
00:07:21.308 - 00:07:55.484, Speaker A: I mean, there's, you know, you got Andrew Tate trying to bully and, you know, use hard r's on n words to show that he's. He's the macho. Or, like, this kind of stuff is really just bringing out the worst in people. And I know that, you know, there's been more celebrities that have tagged in, you know, tried, tried to join the ring. We obviously have Iggy, who is maybe, you know, I think I defended her last week. I think the shit posting is a tier. I don't know, like, how you, as an a tier shit poster yourself feel about Iggy's, but we see one of your tweets here.
00:07:55.484 - 00:08:17.722, Speaker A: It says, dad, how did you spend a bull market of 24? I spent it, max bidding mother the coin launched by rapper Iggy Azalea. And the voices. You mean the telecom muggle? I guess she's launching much more than. Than just this. So what's your take on iggy?
00:08:17.858 - 00:08:42.925, Speaker C: I mean, I think, like, the initial, what was this? When? Like, the whole, like, gas fees. Like, asking what. What Vitalik does with the gas fees. I mean, that was pretty funny. And, I mean, we shouldn't expect these people to have any, like, even modicum of an idea as to what's going on, right? So, like, I think. I think she's, like, pretty elite, to be honest. I even commented to her, like, I think she should get a Pulitzer prize for the past, like, 48 hours of her tweeting, like, I thought it was, like, quite top tier.
00:08:42.925 - 00:09:16.358, Speaker C: And, you know, I mean, like, she doesn't. She doesn't care about the stuff that we, like, may care about, right? Like, she just doesn't, you know, like, we don't need to, like, pretend like she does. I think maybe, like, the bigger question is, like, is this net positive for the space? Like, is this actually bringing new people in? That's been, like, I think maybe one of the more justified questions, like, are new people entering the space as a result of this, or is this just us dumping on each other, thinking that new people are coming in that we're dumping on? Right. Like, so I don't know the answer to this. I have, like, watched, and I found it, like, quite humorous myself.
00:09:16.406 - 00:10:24.396, Speaker D: So, yeah, actually, last week, I was like, I didn't even know how to pronounce her last name, but I listened to the pod, like, the 50 minutes podcast she did, and I think she is elite, and she's actually working for her bags, and she was talking about how she wants to onboard other celebrities to launch coins in a more, quote unquote fair manner. So maybe mother is, like, the launch pad for slove coins last week, I was cynical, embarrassed, but I've been in the shitcoin streets recently, and the shitcoin casino is definitely alluring. Once you get in, it's really difficult to get out. You know, like Gord said, I think a lot of people on crypto Twitter, like, they eat people, right? We just, like, talk amongst each other, and we don't really know what the average person wants. And the average person, they just want to gamble on stuff. And I think, you know, it does make sense for Solana to lean more towards that and I guess eat, you know, maybe has, like, a moral ground or like a moral high ground, but I guess for, like, retail, it doesn't sound like that relatable. There's less there.
00:10:24.580 - 00:10:58.504, Speaker B: On the note of the moral high ground, Eric Connor, huge dot eth and ETH bull, quote, tweeted our other guest, chow, saying how innovative Iggy was, that she was now selling merch with mother tokens. And Eric said, wow, this is the most unbelievable crypto innovation I've ever seen. Using a coin to buy merch. I'm truly on the edge of my seat to see what world changing innovation she comes up with next. I thought this was sort of funny. It plays into the sort of high horse mentality that you guys have been talking about on the pod with dot eths, but also very true.
00:10:58.664 - 00:11:33.946, Speaker D: I actually know one holder, I'm not sure how many coins, super bullish mother. And he just views, I guess, the financialization of attention entering this meta where we're just going to see all these attention Ponzis. And I do admit, like, once Iggy Azalea dropped her coin, I went ahead and watched some of her music videos, right? So, like, maybe it is a way for celebrities to just bring more attention to their music or their other, like, products. And, you know, like, it makes sense, right? Like, why wouldn't a celebrity launch a meme coin if it's, like, not like a pure scam? I think it kind of makes sense.
00:11:34.090 - 00:12:02.450, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I don't know. It's definitely controversial. On the other hand, like, this is. This is the current meta we're dealing with. But on the topic of fair launches, I think this is something that I have dived quite a lot into, and there's no such thing as a fair launch. I think Sisyphus, when he analyzed the landscape of pump fun, for example, he did say that everyone just expects that there are side wallets. It's just a complete mirage that there are no side wallets.
00:12:02.450 - 00:12:56.714, Speaker A: Some people might believe that Iggy just has 3% of her coin, or everyone around her didn't get any other people who helped her, you know, just did it altruistically without getting any coins. But we'll put up this tweet by bubble maps. So, you know, we haven't checked into every, every little thing that they have here, but they have a list of wallets, and if you can click in, Justin, it says 20% was bought before the announcement and has dumped for 2 million. Now, we don't know exactly, like, you know, who it is or if it's someone around her or someone got lucky. We don't really know. There's the daddy coin now, which is like Andrew Tate's, I guess, response to mother. He wants to flip with and show the superiority of his gender or whatever.
00:12:56.714 - 00:13:31.024, Speaker A: So that seems to have even more insider, um, buying. They're saying that there was 30% bought at launch, and that's separate from, like, the. The tokens that he's holding himself again, like, the. The legality morality, like, of all these things, is just, it's just a big question mark. I understand why somebody would want to snipe it, because if it's like, when we had ran on and he was saying he sniped his own coin, you know, if you don't. If you don't snipe your own coin, somebody else is going to do it. You got to do it.
00:13:31.024 - 00:14:08.324, Speaker A: It seems like even these celebrities are finding people to do it, although we'll see how it all shakes out. I mean, do these wallets keep selling? Does Andrew Tate, I think his brand, if I've been looking at his cringe videos, he's so cringe. But, Andrew, we would be interested to have you on the show. As always, we'll take. We'll take the controversial guest, but he says he's not selling anything. He's just, like, trying to fuck with crypto nerds. How do you crypto nerds feel about him doing this?
00:14:08.704 - 00:14:30.278, Speaker B: I mean, you guys know how I feel about these. These celeb coins, these meme coins. I think they're net negative for the space. I don't believe in the hot new narrative that, like, it's an attention game and, like, we're just, you know, none of these coins are worth anything, so we should lean more into memes. I'm very much in the other camp. I think this is probably not bad for the space. I mean, we know how the story ends, right? Same with Defi tokens of the past.
00:14:30.278 - 00:14:54.054, Speaker B: Same with nfts. These meme coins. Same with the meme coins. The celeb coins are going to have the same cycle. We're going to see a ton of these launch. Most will fail, maybe one will succeed, like the iggy coin, but most people get wrecked on them and then leave the space and don't come back for a while, you know? And to your point, Jordy, there are just insider games being played. So, you know, I've stuck a stuck away from it.
00:14:54.054 - 00:15:04.486, Speaker B: I think it's bad for our space, though. I think it's probably distracting us from the real things. I know that's not a popular view, and our audience doesn't like when I say that, but I think that's, like, objectively the truth. Right?
00:15:04.670 - 00:15:32.156, Speaker A: I saw, like, the worst performing category right now is, um, like, for. For the year. Unfortunately. This is sad, but it's, um, like perp dexs and, like, these, like, actual defi coins that have revenue. Their charts are, like, not performing well. And so that's the counterpoint, which is most of this stuff seems to be trade on more, like, memeability rather than fundamentals anyway, and it's just an extreme version of that.
00:15:32.300 - 00:15:54.164, Speaker B: But Jordy, just to be clear, I assume you don't want that, right? Like, you'd rather our space to mature and that these tokens were seen more as equities, and there were ways to value these things and we could value them, and they did have value and accrue value. Like that is what you want, right? We're all still hoping for that same destination. Or do you now think it's different and we're hoping for something? Me and you are hoping for different things.
00:15:54.824 - 00:16:57.674, Speaker A: So I think that they've already been treated as equities when possible, like a GMX, you know, people would try to do some, here's the revenue whatever. Inevitably, the p ratios are very high on those. So the market does give them like a high p ratio. It's like 5100. Like you look at Lido, you look at GMX, like all these kind of blue chips, even Ethereum itself, if you just look at it as how many years of revenue would make this valuation work? And with crypto changing so often, these p ratios don't necessarily hold up because there's going to be a new perp Dex, going to be a new blockchain, there's going to be new whatever. So it's not one or the other. It's just what I've realized for a long time is that the biggest product market failure fit in crypto is the idea of, like, a coin that you can buy and sell and, like, have, like, a brand behind it in a theme or just like an emotional response, like a, you know, like a team, like a football team or something.
00:16:57.674 - 00:17:37.124, Speaker A: Like there's, there's some emotional response to the coin. So you have, like, your favorite, you know, Mister Hodgkinson, his brand was riding high last cycle. His team is not doing a great branding job this cycle. And you have other ones, like Tawn, for example, which has a great story to tell right now. Ultimately, most you can see this in Korea. Like, all of Korea loves crypto, but what does that mean? They just love investing in a coin, in a brand rather than what's the p ratio of GMX or actually using, let alone using the on chain product. God forbid they do that.
00:17:37.124 - 00:17:54.364, Speaker A: So that's that. Yeah. The market is so much bigger because it doesn't require anyone to figure out, you know, web3 logins or anything like that. It just choose a team and, and, and talk to your friends about the team.
00:17:54.784 - 00:17:55.232, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:17:55.288 - 00:18:28.292, Speaker B: Do you think the same people that would be successful in the old narrative where these coins we, like, traded them, like, equities, pe ratios, and to some extent still do? Do those same people succeed in this meme environment, in this attention economy? Or is it a different skill set? Like, part of me thinks that, like, these, you know, thick, he calls them, like, the ivory tower eats. Like, in some ways, like, they're not able to transition their mental model. And I'm not either, right, to this new, like, attention and meme economy. And I've sort of been left behind. And I'm curious what you guys think. And also, gord, what you think of that, too.
00:18:28.468 - 00:19:02.480, Speaker D: Yeah, sorry, I'll chime in. But the way I think about it is, like, the dog eats. Um, their portfolio, I think, is, like, their construction is, like, mostly eth, and their higher tail risker, like, riskier bets, is like private investments, but retail don't have exposure to that. So instead they're saying, hey, like, you know, retail, we're going to just long bitcoin eth, and then we're going to allocate, like, 10% of our portfolio in the meme coins because that gives us convexity. So I think, eat. People just, they just can't empathize with, like, the average person just because they've already made it. That's kind of like how I view it.
00:19:02.480 - 00:19:14.120, Speaker D: Like, what do you think you started using on chain? You bought farm tokens, you got dumped on. It seems like you're more cynical around ethan Defi. How has your. Yeah, what do you think about.
00:19:14.192 - 00:19:58.628, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I would just go back for a second. Like, I definitely would just reiterate that I think that, like, all of these celeb tokens go to zero. Like, and that, like, people think they know that, but then it doesn't always seem like that. People really do understand this, right? Like, I think that there is, like, these type of coins historically. Like, granted, okay, perhaps we don't have, like, some, like, large sample size of historic data to pull from, but, like, all of these type of coins go to zero. Now, also, historically, most real coins, real coins with value, like, with some perceived value also go to zero, so. But I, like, I definitely think, like, maybe with the celeb coin specifically, like, Andrew Tate.
00:19:58.628 - 00:20:13.476, Speaker C: Yeah. Saying that he's. He's never going to sell, like, any. Just trolling crypto people. It's like, it's, I don't know, it's just, like, it's not, like, funny enough really to justify, like, maybe pumping something to, like, a billion and getting so many people wrecked. Like, is that. It's not like that funny.
00:20:13.476 - 00:20:39.572, Speaker C: I mean, come on. Like, that's not that funny of a troll, right? And, like, if he really is that rich, like, why, why do this? You know what I mean? Like, so I tend to be, like, generally cynical when you see, like, influencers and stuff. It's just like, if, I mean, like, you could. This is typically done for the money, right? Like, I don't think we don't need, like, bullshit around that. Like, it's, like, fairly obvious. And maybe it's not just them, but, like, the, like, these other wallets, right? That, like, may control coins as well. So, yeah, I would agree with that.
00:20:39.572 - 00:21:03.642, Speaker C: I just, like, double click on that. As for your other point with, like, regards to tokens in general, like, I mean, I have, like, a fairly cynical view. Tokens. But, like, I would also say that it's mainly just because of, like, what I've seen thus far, right? Like, defi coins from last cycle have largely trended downwards. And maybe I'm slightly unique in that. Like, I'm more like, okay, I'm going to denominate in bitcoin, but, like, that just exacerbates it right in my. Because, like, all of these have trended down towards bitcoin.
00:21:03.642 - 00:21:47.292, Speaker C: And I tweeted something about this the other day, which was that, like, there are, like, less than, I think, five coins in the history of crypto coins that have had multiple four year all time highs versus bitcoin, right? Like, so, like, the essence of it is, like, of course, like, you can do 100,000 x's during these bull runs, but, like, very, very, very infrequently, are you going to find coins that are going to outperform over four years, like multiple cycles? Bitcoin. So, like, I mean, I'm, I understand the cynicism now. Obviously, like, with a lot of these tokens, you know, people are saying, like, look, like, none of these defi tokens did anything for us. None of these, like, icos did anything for us. Like, well, let's degenerate as hard as we can, right?
00:21:47.468 - 00:22:03.508, Speaker A: Put up this tweet of someone whose life is being affected by. Every weekend, I told my friends, guys, I can't go out. I'm reading the chainlink white paper. You don't understand. Chainlink is going to tokenize the entire world. But everything is a joke now. I've wasted seven years.
00:22:03.508 - 00:22:09.438, Speaker A: Iggy destroyed crypto. So, Justin, there's, there's people that are feeling your pain.
00:22:09.566 - 00:22:21.834, Speaker B: I mean, it resonates so well, right? It's like, you try to do the right thing. You spend your time, you studied, right? You read the white paper cover to cover. Probably only five people in their lives have read the chain link white paper, and it was all for nothing.
00:22:23.454 - 00:22:52.834, Speaker A: There's also the curve white paper. And let's get into what's happening there. It seems like Mitch is, once again, this is, this is like, so summertime stuff. I feel like literally one year ago when we were starting the podcast is. When was that, that 40 cent massive buyout to kind of COVID the, the hack was going on. Seems like there's a little bit of a hack going on as well. I think woo had some, some issue maybe tight to your.
00:22:53.414 - 00:23:12.534, Speaker D: Yeah, I can talk about this. So Uwu land was the money market that Sifu made. I think it was a fork of aave, like some fork of Ave. And for whatever reason, Mitch, the founder of curve, he was like lending out his cRB for whatever reason, and there was a flash flown attack.
00:23:14.114 - 00:23:15.174, Speaker B: Cash out.
00:23:16.314 - 00:23:44.674, Speaker D: Well, anyways, $20 million got exploited. And now if you go back to the journal tab, Mitch's leveraged position is about to get liquidated again. What do you guys think about this? Just get it over with. Just make him sell his coins and just move on. That's kind of how he feels. He has to sell his coins. He just has to, otherwise the ecosystem can't move on.
00:23:44.834 - 00:24:10.494, Speaker A: Who's still holding crV? I mean, last time he got bailed out, I remember a bunch of people bought all the way from. You had Machi, and then you had winter mute. Everybody just bought some. But I think these things have vested, and I imagine that a lot of people have sold. So it might not be like defense part two this time. Not sure what happens if it does get liquidated. I mean, we've seen it a few times in the past.
00:24:10.494 - 00:24:32.234, Speaker A: There was the Venus BNB threat. There was a few Solana massive on chain liquidations that generally these have had to get done privately rather than on chain, because literally, there is not enough liquidity sometimes on chain. So it just, like, rips a hole in the universe and creates a wormhole or something.
00:24:32.774 - 00:24:44.510, Speaker B: Jordy, we talked about this. I mean, you've talked about this on prior episodes. Let price do its thing. Like, people are going to jeet, they got to sell. Like, let them do it. Don't worry so much. And then we'll see what, you know on the other side.
00:24:44.510 - 00:25:05.314, Speaker B: We're still going to be around the curve. Token is still going to exist. I understand there's on chain apps that rely on the court curve price, and you could cause liquidations elsewhere, but, like, the primary money markets don't support curve, from my understanding, like, the Aave position's been mostly wound down. It's maybe on these fringe markets, like Uwu. But can't they just let this thing finally get liquidated?
00:25:06.014 - 00:25:35.942, Speaker A: Probably, yeah. I mean, they probably can if there's nothing systemic. I think it gets bad when there's, like, oracles using something, and then, like, you know, every. Everyone's getting, like, liquidated across the board for other stuff. But if, you know, this has been coming for a while, if it does end up getting liquidated, I think, you know, for Mitch, he has to decide. Same decision as last year. Like, does he just keep the money and let the tokens, you know, get burned down? Or does he try to throw money after.
00:25:35.942 - 00:25:39.942, Speaker A: Is it good money after bad money? I don't know what it. What it is at that point.
00:25:40.078 - 00:25:54.462, Speaker C: Doesn't he have, like, 40% or 50% of the float? Or, like, does he have less now? Like, that was. That was the problem, right? Like, initially with, like, the aave, and, like, the. Like, was it. Was it aave? And then, um. What was the other one?
00:25:54.478 - 00:25:55.070, Speaker D: Franklin.
00:25:55.142 - 00:26:15.338, Speaker C: Right. Like, he. He has a massive amount of, like, the outstanding supply. So, like, that's where the dynamics were, like, sort of precarious. Right? Like, and also, I mean, I don't know what. What type of execution is he going to get when he, like, rips 30% of the supply into the open market, you know? Yeah.
00:26:15.346 - 00:26:34.910, Speaker B: So just to answer that, so the market cap of curve is $450 million right now. And then, as per this, uh, Arkham tweet, he's got an $140 million position. So call it, say, like, a third of all curve, roughly. He has up for liquidation here. A curve of third of all circulating curve.
00:26:35.102 - 00:27:00.974, Speaker D: This is a use case of defi, right? Permissionless borrow and lend. I mean, Gort has a binger tweet up where this is. You know, we are manifesting the resilient system and, yeah. Like, in every few months, we do have to rally around Mitch, who's, like, has a gargantuan loan against his own bags he spent on castles. But, I mean, it is how these things are designed to work, really. Right, right. What do you think work?
00:27:01.754 - 00:27:19.906, Speaker C: I mean, I don't think this is, like, the. Like, this is not representative of an efficient capital market here. Like, we don't need to pretend this is, like, the guy. And, like, the problem, too, is, like, what? I don't think he hike. I don't know that he has the money. Right? Like, that's part of the problem. Like, I don't think he can pay these down.
00:27:19.906 - 00:27:44.514, Speaker C: I think the way he pays them down is with the more of the curve tokens. So I don't know, like, I. The precedent of, like, a founder. Yeah. Some people I saw initially when this came out, like, whenever this was a year ago, their argument was like, this is more equitable or democratic than, like, just dumping relentlessly. I don't know. Like, if we put the entire industry through a systemic risk every six months, like, I.
00:27:44.514 - 00:27:49.694, Speaker C: Maybe we could weigh, like, which one is more democratic or equitable? But I don't know.
00:27:49.874 - 00:28:08.974, Speaker B: Well, for him, this is clearly the best solution. Like, this was the best outcome for him, right? I mean, there's no way he could have sold $140 million of curve, right? And so for him, like, he gets to cash out and then get an option later of whether he wants to repay or not. But according to this Arkham tweet, he's paying 60 million in annualized interest. The positions open.
00:28:09.094 - 00:28:44.664, Speaker A: This is why it is, like, a little bit more efficient than you guys are saying. Since last time, like you said, like, the structure of. It's a little bit different. And I think, was it fracs last time? It was one of them that was just, like, started to just charge super high interest to, like, yeah, you know, return my loan first it looks like more. More of the protocols are doing that because 60% interest is 60 million interest annualized is what is that, like 50% or 40? Like 45%. So he is getting squeezed on interest.
00:28:45.124 - 00:29:17.072, Speaker B: We also have to point out, though, that curve built Lama lend, which is the platform he's about to get liquidated on, and no rational lending platform would have actually allowed for this debt position to have been built up. Ave made a huge mistake when they did, but after that, no new rational actor would want to allow this position to happen, except for the platform he built, which is sort of, I don't want to say preying on CRV holders and curve USD lenders and users and whatnot. But, you know, he's built this ecosystem that has allowed him to do this for better or worse.
00:29:17.208 - 00:29:59.160, Speaker A: But ultimately, you know, if we're talking about, like, stay away from selling coins and come to Defi, I mean, DeFi is generally involving lending. Like, that's. That's probably, like, the core of Defi. And these types of financial arrangements where someone is borrowing against a coin are supposed to be, you know, central to the system. Now, of course, you know, if you have bitcoin and. And that's what you're borrowing against, there's always going to be some bid for a bitcoin liquidation, maybe not for like, nine figures of an altcoin, but again, I do think the fact that the interest has gone up and some core platforms don't allow it, it means that we are evolving, and it does seem more efficient to me, even though you guys are saying it's not efficient.
00:29:59.352 - 00:30:22.144, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I'm curious, Tyche, have you looked into possible knock on effects from if there's a liquidation and unhealthy debt on the llama market because it's backed by the curve, or the curve USD token is lent out, which is like a synthetic, stable coin. Right. So I'm curious, like, are you expecting or planning for a big discount on CRV USD if there's a liquidation and they can't, like, fully collateralize the vaults?
00:30:22.564 - 00:30:49.520, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I don't. I don't really view curve as systemic to defi. I think even if it goes to zero, it's not really going to affect the defi ecosystem. All that liquidity is going to just go to uniswap or balancer or some other Dex. So I think it's just really, really bad for anyone holding CRV, blocking CRV, or holding any coins related to that ecosystem. But it doesn't really affect my views on Defi. It's going to go down.
00:30:49.520 - 00:31:07.986, Speaker D: It just takes time for it to go down. I think he just needs to stump everything, just create some massive chaos and have it go down to, like, $0.30 or something, and then figure out if the ecosystem can rebound post liquidation. I think that's, like, the healthiest thing that could happen to, I guess, the curve holders, even though it would be really painful.
00:31:08.130 - 00:31:36.234, Speaker A: Cool. Let's move to another of the topics of the week, which is kind of had mixed opinions, which is the ZK sync airdrop. I think every time you get one of these, whether it's darkware or, you know, anything that has to do with any of these, like, layer zero type of airdrops, there's a lot of happy and unhappy people. Dustin, are you happy this. This time, or how are you feeling about it?
00:31:36.694 - 00:31:54.318, Speaker B: I feel fine. I didn't farm it at all. I didn't put effort into getting the airdrop here. Perhaps that was just due to laziness. It sounds like people were paid out pretty well if they did a lot. The more stuff they did on chain, which was pretty easy to do, like, interact with ten apps, you got a pretty good, healthy airdrop. I did get a small allocation.
00:31:54.318 - 00:32:23.230, Speaker B: If you guys from many, many episodes ago recall crypto, the game, it was this. It actually was just acquired by Uniswap, which is very interesting. And they're going to do a season three, but the first two seasons where this on chain game, sort of like a survivor type game, where you do fun games and challenges, it was pretty cool. And users of that app got a pretty modest airdrop, which is nice. So I have an airdrop from that, but that's pretty much it. I didn't expect it, so I'm happy with it. You know, it is interesting.
00:32:23.230 - 00:32:43.338, Speaker B: I see on the pre market, Zksync is trading at about $0.35 on Avo. And then I think somewhere between, let's say, five to 10,000 tokens you receive for participating in that game. And I think the average airdrop size was about 50,000 tokens, which is pretty good, but probably going to a smaller chunk of big users.
00:32:43.486 - 00:33:09.602, Speaker D: I was actually surprised by this airdrop. It was pretty egalitarian in the sense that, like, 17.5% is being airdropped. There's a lot of funny discussions on Twitter because, you know, right now, primo, right, with layer zero, he's going on this massive witch hunt for Sybils, and I think Sisyphus got his. All his wallets or some of his wallets detected. And then Sisyphus tweeted, hey, all of the tweeted. All the wallets that got Sybil out for layer zero received zksync tokens.
00:33:09.602 - 00:33:30.210, Speaker D: Lamao. And now he's, like, super bullish. ZK sync, of course, until he sells it. So I don't even know what's happening here. I actually got zero tokens, surprisingly. I mean, I use a chain, so I guess I didn't use the chain enough. I guess I can't call myself a humble farmer anymore, but I guess we move on to the next altitude to farm.
00:33:30.210 - 00:33:31.138, Speaker D: That's kind of.
00:33:31.226 - 00:34:02.516, Speaker B: I saw, actually, like, Sybils were probably disproportionately rewarded because they, like, basically rewarded. What activity would match a Sybil's activity? Like, you using ten apps x number of transactions over the past several months, like, something you could easily program versus you tyche, who I imagine was like, if you were farming it, you would have actually been doing things, like actually borrowing on their money market or doing some swaps here and there, et cetera, and playing around. But to use ten apps is like, have you even used ten apps on Ethereum or any l two in the last, you know, few months? Probably not.
00:34:02.620 - 00:34:27.666, Speaker A: Well, they keep us on our toes every time. It's different. They. They reward different things. In this case, it seems like using Paymasters, which is like the account abstraction tool that you might have routed through, I think five Paymaster transactions got you a lot. Apparently, LP ing was the most heavily weighted, and that kind of makes sense. It's also harder to symbol putting in money and leaving it.
00:34:27.666 - 00:34:53.992, Speaker A: So, like, the area under the curve, you can't really sibilate because that's something that has to stay there. So I would say, like, there was some good, some bad. In my opinion, the LP and some of this stuff is good, but it would have been better if Sybils didn't do as well as they seem to have done. It is a very generous airdrop. So 17.5% depends what the market cap is going to launch at. We saw the avoid chart.
00:34:53.992 - 00:35:14.146, Speaker A: It looks like it went from $0.70 down to $0.35, which I believe takes it from 14 billion to 7 billion. I don't know if that drop was based on the announcement of how big the airdrop was going to be, and they were like, oh, shit, there's going to be, you know, 17.5% is, like, a lot of money to absorb. Maybe that's why it went down. I'm not quite sure.
00:35:14.146 - 00:35:16.974, Speaker A: Whether or that sudden pre market shift.
00:35:17.354 - 00:35:31.534, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm curious. Like, you mentioned, you know, you got into, like, the crypto, like, through the tail end of the summer. Do you still use a chain? Like, do you farm things like ZK, Sinclair zero? And, like, think about this airdrop meta. I feel like you would have some hot takes.
00:35:32.174 - 00:35:44.822, Speaker C: Yeah, I actually got some coins. Oh. Much more than expected. Yeah, much more than I expected. That's the only reason I'm saying this. So. Yeah, but, like, I wasn't, like, very active.
00:35:44.822 - 00:36:04.340, Speaker C: Not, like, you know, spinning up hundreds of balls by any means. This is just, like, seemingly fortuitous. Yeah, I mean, like, you know, it seems like people are going to screech no matter what. I don't know. Like, what are you got? What do you think? Has this been better or worse than starknet in terms of the screeching? It seems like a little bit better for the, like, relative amount of screech.
00:36:04.412 - 00:36:06.828, Speaker A: That's a little. I mean, like, the stark.
00:36:06.876 - 00:36:07.292, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:36:07.348 - 00:36:09.596, Speaker D: Extremely bad.
00:36:09.740 - 00:36:12.980, Speaker A: Uh, so this is definitely step up from that.
00:36:13.052 - 00:36:24.372, Speaker C: Yeah. But have there been, like, really good airdrops since. I don't know. The last one, like, I can think of is arbitrum. That was like, that seemed like everyone was like, wow, that's a lot of money. Like, what other airdrops had their band.
00:36:24.388 - 00:36:28.984, Speaker A: Where people, like, oh, the two big ones that went well were Etherfi and Athena.
00:36:29.404 - 00:36:34.740, Speaker C: Okay. Yeah, yeah, Athena. Yeah. But those were points, right? Like, well, at least Athena was more points based.
00:36:34.772 - 00:36:36.504, Speaker B: Eigen layer was a great airdrop.
00:36:36.804 - 00:36:37.588, Speaker A: Well, it hasn't happened.
00:36:37.636 - 00:36:38.596, Speaker D: We don't know yet.
00:36:38.780 - 00:36:41.744, Speaker A: We haven't actually gotten transferable tokens yet, Justin.
00:36:42.044 - 00:36:46.100, Speaker B: No, you can claim them. You can claim them, and they're worth 850 on Avo.
00:36:46.252 - 00:36:46.988, Speaker A: You can't sell.
00:36:47.036 - 00:36:47.824, Speaker D: You can sell.
00:36:48.644 - 00:36:52.180, Speaker B: You can't. But, like, you know, I mean, you know, it's gonna be worth something good.
00:36:52.372 - 00:36:54.872, Speaker A: Okay. All right. Justin's smart, guys.
00:36:54.988 - 00:36:58.608, Speaker B: Like, this is the 2024 app of the year.
00:36:58.696 - 00:37:22.554, Speaker A: But, Gordon, you don't seem to put points, airdrops in the same category. We got a little tweet by Gordy Gord here. He does have a comment, which I would say this is only a matter of time, by the way, he says at least this celeb coins don't do point systems. So many unblocks, so many unlocks.
00:37:22.894 - 00:37:23.342, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:23.398 - 00:37:27.274, Speaker A: Do you think it's going to happen, Gordy? Are you expecting iggy to start doing some points?
00:37:28.094 - 00:37:58.992, Speaker C: I think it's certainly possible. I think. I mean, that the only reason I say that I view them slightly differently is because, like, it does seem at least. Well, maybe I'm not, like, as in the weeds as you guys, but from what I can tell, like, the point systems do seem a little bit more well defined in terms of, like, you know, more or less, you know, in terms of capital in to a. Some, like, linear amount out with points from. From what I see versus a lot of these airdrops, it's, like, totally arbitrary. You don't really know what's getting you points or.
00:37:58.992 - 00:38:22.744, Speaker C: Yeah, like, what. What's getting, like, what you were saying, like, tyke used the chain and did he get hardly anything, so. Or none at all? Sorry. Uh, so, like, yeah, this is, like, yeah, it seems like the points are a little bit more, like, easy to predict out. Right? Like, same with eigen layer. So that was the only reason I would kind of, like, distinguish them in my mind. And also, like, you don't know when, like, ZK sync's coming.
00:38:22.744 - 00:38:26.460, Speaker C: Didn't really know, like, arbitrary. I wouldn't say so.
00:38:26.572 - 00:39:03.724, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the best airdrops are the ones you don't expect, like, uniswap the OIDX. Like, no one really expected much. And it was like, oh, yeah, it's free money, but every time there's an expectation of an airdrop, it's really hard to match that, and then it just creates more negative vibes. I actually have a question for Gort. Justin, if you can pull up my screen. I was actually collecting audience questions, and I'm sure there are other people on CT that want to grow their Twitter account, and I think Gord has done a really good job. Like, what? How mechanical is your tweeting process? And what's a recipe to a good tweet? Like, how do you even think about these tweets? It seems like you just turned them out, like, day after day a couple of times.
00:39:04.504 - 00:39:17.332, Speaker C: Yeah. It's really not mechanical at all, if any. It's quite the opposite. There's, like, no method to it, really. I think, like, I've never. So I. I will say I benefit to some extent from not working in the industry.
00:39:17.332 - 00:39:41.340, Speaker C: Like, I'm purely an observer. So, like. So, I mean, yeah, like, of course I have, like, my bag biases. Like, I'm perma bitcoin bull. Right. But, like, I tend to not be. I think I have maybe an ability to, like, sort of look at, like, high level stuff and not be, you know, like, biased by not, you know, throwing my employer under the bus or, like, my bags under the bus or, like, some investment I've made.
00:39:41.340 - 00:39:59.324, Speaker C: Right. Like, so there is certainly an advantage to this, but no, like, it's very much stream of consciousness. Like, I wouldn't, like, put too much thought into what I say. Like, you know, it's like, a pretty much what. Whatever type of, like, personality you think is behind the Gord account. Like, it's pretty much me. Like, there's not much, like, rationale to what I say.
00:39:59.324 - 00:40:00.100, Speaker C: It's pretty schizo.
00:40:00.132 - 00:40:19.456, Speaker A: You know, it feels like there's a depth, like a hidden depth that, you know, there's, like, a. There's definitely a sophistication there. And we can put a. Can you bring up this. This tweet, Justin? We have the. The usual meme with, like, the left curve, right curve. And this is an interesting one because, you know, a lot of people treated her as, like, left curve.
00:40:19.456 - 00:40:41.714, Speaker A: Like, what does Vitalik do with the gas money? And then, you know, the normal response is, like, stupid. You look at the mechanism and bustness of 15. It's a societal unlock. And the rycraft guy is also, like, what does Vitalik do with, like, what were you thinking when you made this one?
00:40:42.614 - 00:41:12.186, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, like, there's often, like, when you get somebody, like Iggy asking what Vitalik does with the gas fees. Like, the worst thing you can do is to, like, give her, you know, three paragraphs as to, like, how the Ethereum burn mechanism works. Like, you know, like, clearly this is not going to resonate. And, like, I do. I saw a decent bit of that from the Ethereum community after this. Right? They're like, well, you don't know that Vitalik doesn't actually own the masternode. It's like, no, of course she doesn't.
00:41:12.186 - 00:41:41.860, Speaker C: She's a rapper. Like, what do you, like, do you genuinely think she has any idea what's going on? Right. And so that, like, is clearly the left curve angle of it. And then, like, I mean, like, I don't know, you can interpret. I don't want to get too, like, contentious here, but, like, you can interpret the right curve however you want there. I mean, I think that when ethereum, like, transition to proof of stake and, like, I always felt like the ultrasound money narrative was, like, sort of forced. It's like, this is something that kind of needs to emerge from, like, market forces, in my opinion.
00:41:41.860 - 00:42:10.844, Speaker C: Like, this is something that bitcoin has. And in a sense, it's, like, quite lucky to have it, right? Like, it's just this kind of, like, you know, first immaculate conception as the bitcoin or scholar, right? So there's like, nothing more than kind of like sheer luck in that regard. But I always felt like the attempt to, like, truly meme the ultrasound money thing into existence, it's like, hmm, I don't know if you can force this. Like, this has to come from the people, you know what I mean? Like, the market has to determine that this is like, sound money. Like, at the core, it's like some energy you can't sense, you know?
00:42:11.004 - 00:42:39.754, Speaker A: Yeah. So basically, you know, the question of what does Vitalik do with the gas money? It's a dumb technical question because, like, technically from, like, you know, the nodes and whatever, he's not the one taking the guess. But from a philosophical perspective, you can abstract the chain to that question. Like, the right curve can abstract, like, you know, this entire thing and understand all of it, but still be like, you know, what it's Vitalik doing with a guess. It makes sense for us philosophically.
00:42:40.214 - 00:43:22.572, Speaker C: I think also, like, the other thing, I would say just like, one more note on the ethereum ideal. There is. I think that there is, and this is seen in practice with staking, restaking all these derivatives of staking. Now, it's like there was very much a design choice to really maximize for validators. And we see this in some capacity with the attempts for maximal decentralization, running these things on raspberry PIs, like, lowest amount of hardware necessary. But like, also there's some, you know, there's like, some argument that maybe, like, blockchain should not optimize for the people who validate the chain. Like, maybe this, I'm coming with at this from like, a bitcoin bias here.
00:43:22.572 - 00:43:51.622, Speaker C: Like, bitcoiners have always had, like, very tense relationships with miners. To them, they're like, these are the scumbags. They perform a service like, we're not this. The goal of bitcoin is not to pay bitcoin miners, right? The goal of bitcoin is to have a peer to peer store value electronic currency. Like, how are you view it? But it's not to finance the job operations of miners. I think that a little bit into proof of stake. We saw this, like, increasing awareness.
00:43:51.622 - 00:44:23.284, Speaker C: Like, we got to prop up this validator set. Now, that's also, to some extent how proof of stake works, right? Like, you need value locked in order to secure the chain. So, like, the dynamics are different there as well. But I did, I have felt like the goal of Ethereum is not to pay people who validate the Ethereum chain. Like, that should not be the goal. They do something for the Ethereum chain and they are compensated, like, with market rates and. Yeah, I don't know, like, this is sort of more like a feeling versus, like something objective, but like, this is something that I saw.
00:44:23.444 - 00:45:18.568, Speaker B: I see that on Twitter. But I think in practice, I actually am going to disagree with you that I think the core ETH, core team's goal has always been minimum viable issuance. Like, as little EtH, we have to admit, for stakers as possible, is the goal. And I actually think bitcoiners have the opposite approach where they do really care about the miners. I remember when ETH was moving to proof of stake and the most common bitcoin narrative was like, what about the miners? You're just abandoning them after all of this investment? Like, what if they just protest and they don't do this? What if they fork off and everyone goes with their proof of work version? And I think because bitcoiners are so dependent on miners, more so than Ethereum is on stakers, it's actually kind of the reverse of what you're saying. Even though I totally agree that the narrative for ETH is all about rewarding stakers and keeping, like, the system insular and, like, people that hold ETH accrue value from validating, whether indirectly or directly.
00:45:18.696 - 00:45:44.818, Speaker C: Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily listen to those bitcoiners for what? I wouldn't. I wouldn't put myself in that category. But I think, I guess, like, a lot of the marketing, let's say, like, for example, with like, Justin Drake, right? I would. I would agree with you generally, like, core devs, we've seen this with like, this Peter Salagi guy recently, like, talking about, like, what he thinks the point of Ethereum is. Right. And I would say that's much more in line with, like, the vision that you're talking about with regards to, like, the marketing push leading a proof of stake. Like, the.
00:45:44.818 - 00:45:57.626, Speaker C: The idea was like, okay, it's not sound money. It's like, it's better. It's ultrasound, right? Like, everyone gets paid one step up. Exactly. Everybody deserves yield, right? So, like, that was how I, like, sort of viewed this.
00:45:57.810 - 00:46:30.984, Speaker D: And this entire conversation stemmed from, I guess, Iggy azalea asking the most important. But, you know, I feel like people just hate on Iggy because. Just because he's a celebrity. But I feel like if, you know, Iggy launched an l two with native yield, everyone would be backing it. You know, like paradigm, BC's angel investors, you know, at least then, you know, like, word said, we know she's trying to push this space forward, come up with these tweets. It's, it's, it's, it, like, speaks to our, our souls.
00:46:31.724 - 00:47:24.710, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, there is, like, you know, it's just like, I think we kind of touched on this before, but similar sentiment of kind of like, you know, if, like, how much, like, more valuable is like the hundredth l two versus, like, some coin that Iggy azalea is dropping, like, on a whim. I don't know. Right? Like, when I say, when I say I don't know, like, I'm being earnest in that. Like, I'm, a lot of this stuff to me is like, I don't know that it's like, truly proven out, like, real product market fit yet in my mind. So I'm sort of the opinion, like, okay, we wait and see. Right? But, like, I am a little bit reluctant to, like, for example, ascribe some, like, obvious value proposition to, like, blast. And I'm not, like, throwing blasts on the bus here, but, like, you know, it's very much designed around, like, ponsonomics and, like, and you were kind of mentioning this before, Jordy.
00:47:24.710 - 00:47:44.248, Speaker C: Like, it's, we always move on to the next blockchain. Like, there'll be something new, right. And so, like, in my mind, it's less that I have, like, an objection to this as it, as much as it is, like, I'm not going to stick here and say, like, oh, yeah, this is, like, clearly valuable and this is cool. Clearly not. Because to me it's like, yeah, I mean, we don't know yet. Like, most of this stuff goes to zero. So, like, I'm not going to try to throw out predictions now, you know.
00:47:44.296 - 00:48:16.160, Speaker A: But over time, we'll see the buyers are very unsophisticated and the market is very unsophisticated. Something that gets like, enough ingredients of, like, attention with, like, a good meme and, like, some technical mumbo jumbo. Like, you know, again, I don't want to throw anyone under the bus. Let's just look at, like, some of the things that are hyped, right? Like Bara chain. Like this is like, supposed to be a big launch. You know, you got the memes. You know, they do these like, crazy parties with all these, like, you know, showy stuff going on, like in Dubai.
00:48:16.160 - 00:48:50.464, Speaker A: And then you have, like, the technical thing for the VC's to be able to latch on, which is like a proof of liquidity. Now whether proof of work and proof of liquidity are of equal might in the world in terms of their, their impact. I don't know. Well, it's not out yet. We'll have to see, like. But it's a good technical narrative for a VC to be able to say, look, we did a 2 billion round, you know, valuation on this thing because it's not just like a funny website where you scroll up instead of down, like, there is like, white paper with a proof of. Proof of x.
00:48:50.464 - 00:49:04.178, Speaker A: Okay, let's, let's see how that plays out over two, three years. Maybe it's amazing, and maybe it's just, you know, another one in the evolution of, you know, things that we, we learn to, to improve upon.
00:49:04.306 - 00:49:14.106, Speaker B: On the note of the new proof of system, didn't Solana begin, like, I remember three years ago, Solana was like proof of history, but now it's just proof of stake. They did a big rebrand there, right?
00:49:14.250 - 00:49:30.272, Speaker C: No, no, I think it's like the same thing, actually. Like, proof of history is one aspect of their, like, proof of stake mechanism, I think. But no, maybe you're right that they've kind of, like, shifted away from that. But I think. I think it's like, proof of history is still an aspect of their proof of stake, if I'm not mistaken.
00:49:30.408 - 00:50:05.330, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the entire point is a lot of people on CT, they care about all these technical momo jumbo, but at the end of the day, it's for sake. You don't have to understand how it works. You just have to understand that it does work. And Solana can capture all the user activity from speculation, and that's what people care about, the youth people don't like that. But, you know, it doesn't matter what you people want. The market is just going to market, and that's where the puck is going. And I think that's, like, why? It's like, there's a lot of hostility amongst, like, I guess, the youth holders and, like, the Solana community and whatnot.
00:50:05.522 - 00:50:35.748, Speaker B: Do you. I hate to do it, but you guys know the meme of, like, good times make weak men, weak men make hard times, et cetera. I sort of wonder if that's going to happen with Solana. Like, Solana is having all these good times. Like, meme coin launches are going well, but, like, from a fundamental perspective, like, I talk about this all the time, like, there's no actual app innovation. I mean, there is, but I would say there's more on Ethereum, like, significantly more. And I'm curious if you guys think that will lead to negative Solana sentiment in the future, right.
00:50:35.748 - 00:50:56.984, Speaker B: If Ethereum is just, like, in a bad spot right now, ecosystem developers are focused on actual, like, value to users, whether it's with, like, Farcaster things, like Eigen layer, like all of these different experiments, and then Solana is just, like, pumping meme coins that can't end well for Solana in a year at some point. There has to be something there, right? There has to be a there there.
00:50:57.724 - 00:51:34.460, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's like, I talked to Joe McCann about this. He's played bullish meme coins, but it's like, you get people on the chain to speculate on meme coins, and then there's a lot of activity, and then you can actually build apps around it that support that. Like, pump fun is an amazing business. You know, it's probably a better app than anything on eth main, you know, and maybe, you know, Eigen layer is talking about utility and use cases, but, like, there are nothing. Like, there's nothing there, you know? So technically, if you're, like, if you're in the Solana camp, you can point to eigen layer, be like, well, like, we don't need this much economic security. Like, what are the abs is on it. It's like, there's not much.
00:51:34.460 - 00:51:39.212, Speaker D: So, like, we want to make money right now. So the only place to make money is on.
00:51:39.348 - 00:51:39.798, Speaker A: That's kind.
00:51:39.836 - 00:51:41.666, Speaker D: Kind of how the normal person thinks.
00:51:41.690 - 00:52:09.678, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm not, like, worried where the innovation comes from. Like, you look at the real world analogies and, you know, Apple is not necessarily the one that creates a lot of the inventions. They just put it together really nicely and a good experience. So there is a lot of value to capture there. And I'm not going to go into my usual Solana banter about, you know, EC unlocks and stuff like that. But, you know, ultimately, as we zoom out, a lot of things will change.
00:52:09.678 - 00:52:42.214, Speaker A: I think that's the thing that's given. And even those of us that are living and breathing the space don't really know what's going to be happening in three years. Like, which coins. I know, you know, like I said, professor, coins have been doing well because they have this, like, modicum of investability. But, like, you zoom out and, like, you know, hush can send your buddy. He's, like, refusing to even go on bankless because he doesn't want to get the questions from the evil anti cardano people out there.
00:52:42.714 - 00:52:46.554, Speaker B: We'll have you on and we'll give you a fair interview. Charles, I can promise that.
00:52:46.714 - 00:52:51.762, Speaker A: I mean, I've tried to message him. He's blank so far. I'll keep trying for you, Justin.
00:52:51.898 - 00:52:52.746, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:52:52.890 - 00:52:56.734, Speaker A: Let's move to pasta of the week. We have the new graphic here.
00:52:57.054 - 00:53:03.334, Speaker B: Should we talk about. We did our first poll on Twitter last week. A little recap of who won pasta.
00:53:03.414 - 00:53:07.726, Speaker A: Oh, is that what you're bringing it up, Justin? Cuz I see, like, you won this one.
00:53:07.750 - 00:53:18.622, Speaker B: Okay, I'll have you know, you can see I actually voted for thickie. I voted my heart. I thought you had best pasta, but the work. The market decided. The world picked me. I had the best pasta last week. And we get it.
00:53:18.622 - 00:53:32.326, Speaker B: We're gonna keep these running where they keep the audience polls, because I think there's some collusion going on where, like, tyche and thicky never really seem to vote for me. I always get support from Jordi, though. So I want to let. I want to let our audience decide and really, really hear from them.
00:53:32.390 - 00:53:50.064, Speaker A: Okay, well, we need more than 44 votes. That's not even, like, half a percent of our audience. We need to get a proper sample. So, Justin, like, even though you kind of win next time, we need a better, better show up. So how about you kick off then, Justin? Defending champion.
00:53:50.254 - 00:54:22.464, Speaker B: All right. You know, this tweet has been in my mind a lot last week. We've been talking a lot about mental health in some of our circles and trouble in the crypto space. And we come back to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. If you guys are familiar, there's that pyramid where everyone needs companionship, friendship, financial resources, food, great sex life. But actually, like, the real underpinning to all of this is really that you need a bull market at the base, really, to get to really fill up your bucket here. And I think about this one a lot.
00:54:22.464 - 00:54:36.364, Speaker B: I mean, I just look back in 2021 and just think about how happy we all were. And so I think, for the sake of all of us, we really need a new big bull market to kick off here and fulfill our basic human needs. So Maslow was close, but he missed his one key piece.
00:54:38.504 - 00:55:23.446, Speaker A: And actually, it's not just crypto bull market, like general bull market. You can see throughout history that whenever the currency is getting debased at the very beginning of it, it just feels so good because everyone, eventually, there is something to pay for it. But Trump is definitely the kind of president that will take that short term sugar rush and just make everybody have this bull market base layer happiness. And unfortunately, politicians are sort of, you know, incentivized by the game theory to milk as much as possible out of this feeling where everyone feels like the productivity gains are going up for society when it's just the currency debasement.
00:55:23.630 - 00:55:38.328, Speaker B: Yeah. Jordy and Taiki, I'll give you end quart. I'll give you guys a tip. If you want to win pasta from the expert, you need to craft a story. The actual pasta itself is like 20% of the job. The other 80% is the story and what it. How it relates to you in the real world.
00:55:38.328 - 00:55:44.204, Speaker B: And so I just encourage you guys, if you want to compete with the champ, if you want to go after the champ, you know, you need the story.
00:55:44.744 - 00:55:46.244, Speaker A: Can you do it, Tykee?
00:55:47.064 - 00:56:19.564, Speaker D: All right, let me. Let me give it. Let me give it a try. So, you know, Justin, you know, I hear this a lot from, I guess, like, the Eth maxi community, like the VC community. It's like, you know, like, right now there are no apps, but once there are apps, once there are gaming apps, it's going to bring billions of users on chain and blockchain fixes this. But then this is a pasta from Gord that I thought was very good. Why does it need to be on block? Why does it need to be on a blockchain? Oh, I'm sorry.
00:56:19.564 - 00:56:43.456, Speaker D: Do you know a better place to monetize ideas that are this terrible? I just thought this was a really good one. I feel like in crypto, there are all these ideas that gets million dollars that would never raise that much money on, like, web two. It's just that there's all these vc's, like, foaming at the mouse. Like, you know, like, fund remotely talented engineers. And I just thought that, you know, this really resonated with me, and I really liked this suite.
00:56:43.560 - 00:56:43.752, Speaker A: So.
00:56:43.768 - 00:56:44.696, Speaker D: Thanks, Gordon.
00:56:44.720 - 00:56:47.044, Speaker C: Yeah, no problem. Happy to do it.
00:56:48.104 - 00:56:55.872, Speaker D: Actually, gore, like, I have a question before you do your pasta. Like, what's, like, your most proud tweet? Like, like, what are you the most proud of? Like, do you remember off the top.
00:56:55.888 - 00:57:16.204, Speaker C: Of your head, probably my pin tweet. It's like, it's incredibly embarrassing that Satoshi did not think about yield. It's just like that. I'm quite proud. It's very encompassing of my views, and it also kind of hints at my tendency towards bitcoin around 2023.
00:57:16.364 - 00:57:28.312, Speaker A: That was probably when you were first getting noticed. I remember you from way before that. You were always like, reply guying, kind of like comments, but you went from reply guys just like, posting.
00:57:28.488 - 00:57:37.568, Speaker C: Yeah, like, you got to start out reply guy. And then. And then, like, once people notice, then you can just start ripping them out directly to the timeline, you know? That's, like, the strategy, I would say.
00:57:37.736 - 00:57:41.284, Speaker A: Nice. All right, well, can you give us a positive this week?
00:57:41.944 - 00:57:56.624, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay, so I saw this tweet earlier from you guys say hosaka. I know it's not actually. Yeah, saga. Okay. It's like, these. These new art blogs collections are getting quite bland, and it's the.
00:57:56.624 - 00:58:20.954, Speaker C: It's the Sybil addresses of, like, yeah, for layer zero. But, like, the funniest part was, like, when I saw this, my first thought was, like, the art blocks people would, like, definitely spend $100,000 on this. That's what cracked me up. Like, I was like, you know what? They would love that. Like, if they had no idea and that was released by, like, some, you know, art blocks guy, they'd be like, oh, this is a really scarce mint. You know, because, like.
00:58:23.254 - 00:58:29.194, Speaker A: It'S called the Umbra cluster, apparently. So just, like, constellations have names. This cluster has a name.
00:58:29.694 - 00:58:33.158, Speaker C: Yeah. That could sell as an NFT for sure. I thought that was pretty good.
00:58:33.286 - 00:59:14.662, Speaker A: All right, well, I will go with bored tweet as well in honor of our guest, and maybe you can pull. Pull mine up. He says, if I get a very small airdrop or no airdrop at all, I take this to meme. The team does not trust my judgment to govern the protocol, and so I look inward. What can I do to present myself as a better leader? I reach out on LinkedIn to team members and ask for feedback. So, like, this is the hilarious thing where the governance meme is supposed to be like, you know, help the protocol make decisions, and we want the stakeholders to push the protocol in the right direction and govern it. You know, that's the point of these tokens.
00:59:14.662 - 00:59:35.464, Speaker A: It's not for trading and making money, it's for governing. And so if you don't get a good airdrop, you haven't been showing good governance skills. You know, you need net start out and improve your LinkedIn activities and leadership skills. So I thought this was ten out of ten.
00:59:36.084 - 00:59:38.324, Speaker B: Great pasta Gwarti.
00:59:38.444 - 01:00:13.136, Speaker A: We'll put it out for listeners. And also one more ask before we go. We have a great hype video that our producer has built up with some of the. Maybe you can play a few seconds, Justin. But this is showing some of the highlights that we've had so far of the 46 episodes we previously done. If you guys can retweet this and keep increasing our exposure, we can keep getting amazing guests like, board here on the show and give you guys a good interview every time.
01:00:13.320 - 01:00:20.764, Speaker B: Yeah. What we'll do is we'll pin this tweet in the top comment, and if you guys can share it, it would mean the world to us. We can grow this account. So thank you, guys.
01:00:21.464 - 01:00:24.644, Speaker A: Thanks so much. And thank you, Gord, for joining.
01:00:24.964 - 01:00:27.224, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you so much for having me. I appreciate it.
01:00:27.884 - 01:00:28.964, Speaker A: See everybody next week.
