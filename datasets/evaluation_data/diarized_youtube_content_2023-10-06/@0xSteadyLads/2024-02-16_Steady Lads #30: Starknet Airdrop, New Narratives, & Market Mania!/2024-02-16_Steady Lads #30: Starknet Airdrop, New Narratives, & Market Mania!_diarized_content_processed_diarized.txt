00:00:00.280 - 00:00:05.554, Speaker A: It shows that it does matter what the public sentiment is. It really does.
00:00:05.854 - 00:00:22.086, Speaker B: You can argue that the stark devs are on the offensive. He was, like, calling the community, like, you know, you. You little e beggars. Why don't everyone grow a brain and, like, learn? This seems like high iq, low eq type of e beggars. Yeah, high iq, low eq type of devs.
00:00:22.110 - 00:00:22.998, Speaker A: Eat the e beggars.
00:00:23.086 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker B: Yeah, eat the e beggars.
00:00:24.502 - 00:00:28.238, Speaker C: I love that term. You fingers. What's wrong with you?
00:00:28.406 - 00:00:29.022, Speaker A: I know.
00:00:29.118 - 00:00:30.754, Speaker B: I've never heard of that before.
00:00:51.374 - 00:00:52.967, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody, to another episode of Stack.
00:00:52.978 - 00:00:53.236, Speaker D: Hey, daddy.
00:00:53.260 - 00:01:16.744, Speaker A: Lads. I'm Jody, the founder of Salini Capital. We have with us taiki, the humble farmer and researcher. We have Justin Bram, CEO of Astaria. And we have Vicki, who is Vicki? Are you still at Cimar or what's going on? Are you guys, like, taking your own paths and being divas, or are you still one crew?
00:01:17.524 - 00:01:23.094, Speaker C: We're exploring other other trades, but, you know, still on paper together.
00:01:23.394 - 00:01:28.294, Speaker A: Wow. On paper. Okay. Sounds like a interesting polyamorous.
00:01:31.434 - 00:01:39.014, Speaker D: Nikki. You guys were on the wrong side of this whole BTC pump, right? You were just mentioning how you sort of been wrecked by a few shorts here and there.
00:01:41.594 - 00:01:52.904, Speaker C: We were long bitcoin. We flipped, like, very long, like 47. That first flow number really did it for us. But they were like some straggler. All shorts that.
00:01:55.284 - 00:02:19.764, Speaker A: Yeah, you were kind of publicly calling the top, if I recall, a few weeks ago after the ETF launched, and it looked like you were spot on for at least ten days after that. Once Grayscale was. Was getting ripped down. Are we in a new paradigm? Have you rerated or how are you looking at it right now?
00:02:20.744 - 00:02:41.904, Speaker C: I think we are. I think DTF flows came in a lot stronger than expected, a lot faster, and, yeah, I mean, all we need is like $20 million a day on average of flows to offset the minor supply closed tapping. And we're getting like 500, 600. So it looks like we're on a clear path to all time highs.
00:02:42.404 - 00:02:48.628, Speaker A: And then you just think that that will keep sort of fueling the altcoins as well.
00:02:48.796 - 00:02:55.624, Speaker C: I think so. I think there are a lot of laggard altcoins, maybe new narratives for the cycle that might be interesting and see a re rate.
00:02:56.364 - 00:03:19.330, Speaker D: But, Thikki, interestingly enough, a couple episodes ago when we had Hal as a guest, I think you guys were both sort of in agreement that there are so many unlocks happening this year that we need something like, it was a crazy number, like $60 billion of all its buy pressure just to support the current valuations. Do you still think that is true or do you think the market is just so bullish we're going to eclipse that?
00:03:19.522 - 00:03:29.114, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that goes out the window when people are buying this much bitcoin. Like the wealth effect, and just like, people have a lot more money just to buy all sense of majors.
00:03:29.274 - 00:04:06.282, Speaker A: I wonder if we are going to get this kind of wealth effect that we have normally at this point in the cycle. I just not sure how much crypto natives have exposure to bitcoin compared to the past. I feel like it's gone down. I know, like, a lot more people that don't have bitcoin. I was talking to light crypto today and was like, reminiscing how last cycle he told me that there was like one spot where he was like, yeah, I don't have any bitcoin right now. And I thought it was unfathomable that somebody, you know, who is like, investing in crypto all the time and bullish on the space would have zero bitcoin. I just thought, like, I would feel naked, you know, completely underexposed to potential upside.
00:04:06.282 - 00:04:26.274, Speaker A: But now it's just normal. Like, there's so many people who don't have bitcoin. And, like, when we talk about a wealth effect, it's definitely, like, there. But is it really like, how many of us have, you know, bitcoin that we're now, like, selling and then we're gonna, like, buy, you know, avalanche or something?
00:04:26.934 - 00:04:57.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like it's more the psychological wealth effect, right? If bitcoin is going up, then everyone feels like they can spy more, right? They just bridged fiat from their bank accounts to coinbase, just buy stuff. I feel like the wealth effect will come true for the ETH. ETF. It feels like ETH or some part of the ETF is being priced in as ETH is just pumping today, whereas other altcoins are, or just down. Do you think it'll happen in May or do you think that it might be delayed and maybe like a 2025 approval?
00:04:57.812 - 00:05:15.284, Speaker A: So it looks like the odds are, depending on who you ask, anywhere from 60 to like 90%, that we'll get it around May. I don't have a strong view. I think some of the wiser people are putting it higher and they seem to know the US system better. Better than I do.
00:05:15.444 - 00:05:21.142, Speaker C: You're kind of high, Jody. I was at 50%. I think polymarkets like, close to 52.
00:05:21.318 - 00:05:45.160, Speaker D: I put it at. Honestly like 90% plus, barring some sort of catastrophic. Let's go barring catastrophic news, like, if you guys recall. But when the bitcoin ETF narrative was still, let's say, four months out, people were saying the exact same things, right? Gary doesn't want this approved. It's never going to happen, etc. Etc. Personally, I think we should just, you know, left curve this, right.
00:05:45.160 - 00:06:00.264, Speaker D: Blackrock filed for the ETF. They're only going to file if they think it's going to happen. And if the SEC sort of signals to them that they'll accept it. The market wants this. It just makes perfect sense. And actually, on CNBC, I'd recommend everyone watch. It's about a 20 minutes interview with Gary.
00:06:00.264 - 00:06:31.342, Speaker D: I know thiki and I have different perspectives on this. I thought Gary basically conceded and said the ETF is going to happen. Basically, he said, we're going to sit as a committee and decide. And he also said, interestingly enough, that he didn't think bitcoin was decentralized. He said this yesterday. Regardless of whether it's decentralized or not, that really is interesting to me because it shows that maybe the key question for the ETF isn't about decentralization if he thinks bitcoin is actually centralized in itself. So I'd watch the interview, make your own determinations.
00:06:31.342 - 00:06:36.314, Speaker D: But to me, I put this at 90% plus, barring, like, a catastrophic incident with ethnicity.
00:06:36.314 - 00:07:10.096, Speaker A: Let's talk a little bit about the new coins. You know, we've talked about this narrative of new coin. Good. And we haven't had any big launches this week. I believe we are potentially having something announced for in a few days. So the strk token is a little bit the talk of the town right now because, well, a couple of things, right? Like, number one, how many people got the airdrop? And a lot of people were expecting to get some kind of airdrop. And a lot of drama around that.
00:07:10.096 - 00:07:13.964, Speaker A: Did. Did any of you guys get an airdrop? Taiki, have you checked your wallets?
00:07:14.464 - 00:07:34.390, Speaker B: Yeah, I used starknet across like five wallets last year. I bridged like a couple hundred bucks over lp'd on Jediswap. And the user experience was awful. Took like ten minutes to settle a transaction, but I got zero tokens. I'm actually not that upset. I think the methodology was okay. Just rewarding, I guess.
00:07:34.390 - 00:07:44.078, Speaker B: Early users and devs. I think where people are upset is with the vesting schedule. That seems pretty egregious. What do you guys think about that?
00:07:44.166 - 00:08:25.934, Speaker A: Yeah, let's talk about that from what I understand, the team is supposed to unlock tokens two years after TGE. And the TGE is a technical term, like, you can have the token launched on exchanges and that's usually the TGE, or you can quietly, like, you know, create the token and then don't say anything for two years, and then suddenly, like, your tokens are unlocked. I don't really have a strong view, I guess. You know, the main people that are affected are investors who are still locked up. While some, I'm not, I'm not quite sure, like on the game theory of this. Thikki, have you studied this chart?
00:08:27.674 - 00:09:00.944, Speaker C: Yeah, the tokenomics are quite interesting. My take on this, just from hearing rumors, is that they legally agreed that they would unlock investors at a certain date, and they were supposed to launch last year, but they delayed it for more favorable market conditions, and the investors sort of did not agree to push back their mock. So even though it is beneficial, they're launching now and they're getting higher valuation, better market conditions. Like the cliff is kind of unprecedentedly close to GE.
00:09:01.444 - 00:09:42.784, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know if you have the chart that we can bring up with the unlocks of tokens and how that's going to go. And it has this strange shape at the beginning. I think April is kind of when a bunch of it gets unlocked and then we're starting with a really tiny, like thing at the start. I'm not quite sure what's going to happen for the first two months until things come online. It looks like the ultimate low float Sam coin. It looks like maps or something, which is not supposed to be the case for a serious token. Hopefully they get some solution to that.
00:09:43.884 - 00:10:13.004, Speaker D: Jordy, you, like, live in this world. You live and breathe it day in and day out. I mean, what are your thoughts on? So does it really matter if the cliff starts in a year versus three months from now? Like, in some ways, could you argue that it's even better to start in three months? Like, yes, it feels shady, but like, the market's super hot right now. There's going to be a lot of buzz around the launch. Like, this is going to happen eventually. Why not just sort of get it over with and reach a fair valuation earlier? Or do you think this could completely handicap the project in perpetuity?
00:10:13.984 - 00:10:28.936, Speaker A: No, the three month versus one year is not a huge deal. I think the weirdest thing is just that first three month period, there's literally no tokens out. So I'm not sure what's going to happen on the markets even if there's just a little bit of buying pressure, it's going to be hard to find tokens for that.
00:10:29.120 - 00:10:49.164, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess you can argue that there is zero ecosystem there. There's $70 million with the TVL. So maybe the team just wants Dao tokens to unlock immediately so they can just start handing it out to teams. Maybe that's something that they're thinking of. But tripling the circulating supply in two months seems pretty egregious.
00:10:50.264 - 00:11:32.704, Speaker A: Yeah. So they used to be the house of DyDX, right before DyDX decided to move to their own chain on Cosmos and now there's DydX before there. They have a couple dexs now. I think Paradex is probably one that's sort of up and coming there, but, yeah, without a ton of ecosystem, I don't know, I feel like they should have maybe distributed the token a bit more. We did see that some GitHub contributors who. I don't know if this was a joke, it was just like legit. Whether there were these Twitter posting that somebody changed one line of code and his account got doused with hundreds of thousands of tokens.
00:11:32.704 - 00:11:39.198, Speaker A: Maybe, maybe it was, it was a bit of a joke there. But I think.
00:11:39.246 - 00:11:52.142, Speaker D: I think that's actually real, though. I think those sort of, all of those incidents are real. Like, I don't think they did enough due diligence of like looking at each GitHub account and determining if it was a worthy contribution or not. It was just sort of like a binary thing.
00:11:52.278 - 00:12:43.306, Speaker A: Yeah, and they were saying there was a lot of squatting on people's usernames for GitHub because people stopped using it and. Yeah, that's what Bantech has been saying, that people deleted their accounts and then people are just squatting on the name of the account that had once contributed. But, you know, let's see how it goes. The one thing that I will point out is that it does seem to matter if you lose the community. We saw that with Jupiter as well. I'm not saying they lost the community, but there was obviously like a bit of fud and, you know, the founder had to go into defensive mode and that's like somewhere you don't really want to be. Obviously there's ways to climb out of it, but, you know, the token hasn't been performing well since launch and it shows that it does matter, like what the public sentiment is.
00:12:43.306 - 00:12:44.534, Speaker A: It really does.
00:12:44.834 - 00:13:00.720, Speaker B: You can argue that the Stark devs are on the offensive. If you, Justin, if you can pull up the ansem tweet. I think. I mean, I don't really know who this guy is, but he was, like, calling the community, like, you know, you. You little e beggars. Oh, yeah, yeah. It's like, you know, like, you know, Linia, like, you know, screw them.
00:13:00.720 - 00:13:15.520, Speaker B: They bought followers. You know, like, why don't everyone grow a brain and, like, learn this seems like high iq, low eq type of. Yeah, high iq, low eq type of devs. The e beggars. Yeah, eat the e beggars.
00:13:15.672 - 00:13:19.414, Speaker C: I love that term. What's wrong with you?
00:13:19.584 - 00:13:23.914, Speaker B: I know. I've never heard of that before. Yeah.
00:13:24.074 - 00:13:48.430, Speaker A: So, I mean, I obviously, like, I think these things could be expressed better. I do think there's a little bit of a, like, natural pushback towards people who just expect, like, free stuff. You know, we have these, like, toddlers that are just spoiled on chain, and they just expect that. I mean, taiki seems fine, but, like, other people, they'll be like, I. I use Jedi swap. It's Jedi swap. Okay.
00:13:48.430 - 00:13:51.182, Speaker A: I want my, like, $5,000. Like, where is it?
00:13:51.278 - 00:13:56.674, Speaker B: No, I'd like 300. I use. I bridge like $300, and it's just sitting there doing nothing.
00:13:57.654 - 00:14:30.258, Speaker D: I sort of agree. I agree with you, Jordy, in the sense that, like, they, they truly do owe everyone nothing. Right. They don't have to give a dollar away if they don't want to. The airdrop mechanic always has issues, whether people are always going to complain about it even though it's free money, whether we were complaining or I was complaining last week about siblers getting a large share of the airdrops. Now, the complaint is that we're not rewarding siblers or these people that aren't providing any value. We're just, you know, giving incentives to GitHub developers like ETH aligned people, etcetera.
00:14:30.258 - 00:14:43.536, Speaker D: I think you're never going to win when, whenever someone doesn't make money from this, they're going to be a loud voice. Right. That is just how it is. So I don't have an issue with how they did it. I wish I had an airdrop, but it is what it is.
00:14:43.720 - 00:15:26.872, Speaker A: Yeah. I think ultimately, if what they're saying is that they are just focused builders and trying to add value and build the best technology, then, you know, we'll kind of let the tech speak for itself. But I have seen that the projects, like, one prime example right now is pith. They gave out massive amount of tokens, and, you know, instead of doing a binance launchpad, they did like, even more like airdrops. They just increased everyone's airdrop, and now they just recently announced, like, retroactive. They gave, like, a bunch of projects that they're associated with more of their airdrop. You would think that, like, this amount of supply and, like, selling pressure would just obliterate the token.
00:15:26.872 - 00:15:57.966, Speaker A: But it's been, like, one of the best performers, and it's kind of made, like, a big all time high again. Now, of course, you know, some of it's around, like, this staking for airdrops narrative, but it goes to show you that in crypto, the rules of economics get flipped on their head. And if you have just a ton of airdrops and give out tokens that you would think would destroy your price, seems to work out. And I'm still trying to scratch my head and understand how does it change the supply and demand so much?
00:15:58.070 - 00:16:49.910, Speaker B: If you think about the top performing airdrop coins, it's like Celestia dimensions doing well, and then it's pissed. And all three have this airdrop, like, stake for airdrop narrative. And even people that's bearish, dime or even pyth or pith, instead of selling their entire stack, they're selling three quarters and staking to 25%. So you can argue that the price is being detached from reality because there's all these tokens being staked, and people are just going to stake it there for the next couple of months because they have this mindset of and fuck it, Yolo, just stake here, and maybe I'll get something in return. And then if there's one big airdrop, then everyone piles in. It's like, oh, my God, it's happening, it's happening. So it's definitely bull market pumpamentals 101 that I'm trying to align myself with more.
00:16:50.062 - 00:16:53.206, Speaker C: It's like real utility for these tokens.
00:16:53.310 - 00:16:55.514, Speaker B: Yeah, it's utility if you think about it.
00:16:57.014 - 00:17:33.756, Speaker A: I mean, I'm actually kind of interested to see how wormhole does. I think it might do very well, given that it will be very widely distributed across all these different ecosystems and different people everywhere, all kinds of different wallets. It seems to me that if you just get the token in a lot of people's hands, they will trade it and speculate upon it, and then that sort of just builds, builds from there. So I'm curious to see. But with stark specifically, it'll be an interesting launch. I think right now we can pull up Evo on the perpetuals. And I looked at hyper liquid as well.
00:17:33.756 - 00:18:20.486, Speaker A: It seems to coincide. We are seeing $18 billion fdv being sort of bet upon, not by a ton of volume, but it is a million dollars, which is pretty high for these types of things. It's not total dust. There was some speculation in some of my telegram chats that, you know, some of the, like, big bag holders are, you know, maybe burning a few hundred k just to prime everybody that, you know, this thing should trade at 18 billion. Just like, you know, in presidential elections. Like some candidate can bet on themselves just to kind of appear that they're doing really well. I'm not sure anyone's taken that game theory line.
00:18:20.486 - 00:18:22.062, Speaker A: It would actually make sense to do it.
00:18:22.078 - 00:18:41.006, Speaker D: But if this thing truly launches at 18 billion, in your guys opinion, like, what does that rebate? EigeN L2, right? With actual TVL actual use cases, a great narrative. Like, do we have to think of Eigen layer as a $40 billion project now? Like, these valuations are in some ways getting absurd, right?
00:18:41.110 - 00:18:47.114, Speaker C: Well, do you think they're related? Because this is like ZK and Eigen layer, it's restaking. It's a different vertical, right?
00:18:47.414 - 00:19:15.924, Speaker D: Totally different. But I think we can think of it in the same fashion, right? Like a new token launch for a somewhat hot narrative ETH beta. Nothing comparable yet to sort of bet on it with. This is the first ZK thing you can bet on. And Eigen layer has a lot more mindshare now and also a lot more users, a lot more TVL ecosystem airdrops. Have we discussed? Like, I don't think there are related projects, but I think Eigen layer should certainly be valued higher than starkware, just intuitively.
00:19:16.914 - 00:19:28.974, Speaker C: Yeah, I can see that. I think it's really bullish. It could be really bullish, just like all new verticals. I am really bullish on just ZK as a whole. I do think it might be like the narrative of this cycle.
00:19:29.874 - 00:19:31.214, Speaker B: Can you expand on that?
00:19:31.594 - 00:20:20.534, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I think that the cool thing about ZK is that it really only makes sense if you want to have cross chain interoperability. So, like, with our current iteration of optimistic roll ups, like, you can actually communicate cross chain atomically because you have to submit. You submit the batches optimistically and you need a seven day fraud check period. So you can't actually, like. Yeah, you can't communicate instantly, whereas ZK, because you're submitting a proof. And you can assume that these proofs are like instantly, quickly verifiable. Like you can actually talk across all these ZK chains instantly and do cool things like, you can essentially have a modular architecture without fragmenting liquidity.
00:20:20.534 - 00:20:35.216, Speaker C: So what that looks like is you can submit a swap and they can aggregate liquidity across all of these ZK pools or. Yeah, on all these CK chains at once. Whereas right now, with the optimistic architecture, you can't do that. Pretty far off being able to do that.
00:20:35.330 - 00:21:03.652, Speaker B: Yeah, that's interesting. I know bank listed this two hour podcast with Justin Drake around fixing fragmentation because they understand that it's an issue. And I think optimism super chains is trying to do something similar where all these super chains are connected within the op stack and they can share liquidity and whatnot. That's also dimensions. Bowl case. Do you think 18 billion is fairly valued? I think you kind of mentioned that. Like, how would you price this thing? How would you trade it?
00:21:03.668 - 00:21:25.384, Speaker C: Personally, I don't think it has to be that overvalued. I think especially if you take away liquidity from a lot of existing altcoins. Like, it could. I wouldn't be like, wouldn't be crazy for Starcor to trade at like, you know, it's only a couple billion market cap. So if TN dimension can get there, then, like, I don't see why Starcore can't.
00:21:25.844 - 00:21:30.474, Speaker B: It'll be a hated coin rally for sure if it, like, pumps like 30 billion ftb.
00:21:31.134 - 00:21:42.190, Speaker C: I think one really underappreciated play is how it might re rate the Matic token, because matic is working on exactly this and it's trading in only nine.
00:21:42.342 - 00:22:15.226, Speaker A: Yeah, Matic's an interesting one. It hasn't quite gone up as much as it did last cycle. I remember seeing multiple dollars on Matic, and maybe it'll catch up. I guess it all also depends on supply. I mean, we said supply doesn't matter, but I think it probably does matter. If we look at Arbitrum right now, there is a big unlock happening in March that everybody's kind of like, circled on their calendar mid march. And I couldn't help but notice that despite everything else pumping pretty hard, the arbitrum, we can look at the arb ETH.
00:22:15.290 - 00:22:16.454, Speaker C: It's doing very well.
00:22:18.074 - 00:22:36.210, Speaker A: It had a good start to the year. A great sort of rally from one dollar to two dollars. You know, in this latest push up, I think people have circled the. The coming unlock and maybe, maybe it matters. What do you think, Vicki?
00:22:36.402 - 00:23:01.460, Speaker C: I've actually flipped bullish on Arp Trump because it truly is, like, its best, like, monolithic competitor to Solana. Like, the TVL is just really good. You know, block times are very fast. 250 millisecond block times. I really think optimistic monoliths just make a lot of sense. So I flipped from bearish to bullish. Not bullish, but not bearish on ARp.
00:23:01.572 - 00:23:02.784, Speaker A: How about optimism?
00:23:03.484 - 00:23:16.556, Speaker C: I'm marginally less bullish optimism now because they're modular, but they're never going to be interoperable. It's going to take a long time for optimism to become interoperable. You just have this liquidity fragmentation problem.
00:23:16.700 - 00:23:31.180, Speaker A: This is quite an interesting chart. We have a inverse McDonald's chart here. I can't tell if this is bullish or bearish. Like, maybe we need Andre back on the show to read the chart for us.
00:23:31.332 - 00:23:34.204, Speaker B: Did you have a signal ticky? What was that? Phone or phone alarm.
00:23:34.244 - 00:23:36.144, Speaker C: Oh, let me check what that was.
00:23:37.084 - 00:23:38.984, Speaker A: ECTF approved.
00:23:41.364 - 00:23:45.414, Speaker C: It was some CFTC release. So, dude, they got caught for fraud.
00:23:46.954 - 00:23:47.774, Speaker B: Bullish.
00:23:48.154 - 00:24:06.138, Speaker A: So, like, let's talk a little bit about the fact that, you know, the market has flipped at this point to being just in this mania. Is there anything specific that we're looking at as narratives right now? Given the bitcoin pump I've been.
00:24:06.306 - 00:24:40.096, Speaker D: I'm going to share this link with everyone in the description. I think this flow table is exceptionally good and interesting. This is generated automatically in real time, so if you want to just leave this open as a tap, it will automatically. You'll have to refresh, but it'll automatically update with flows as they come in for the day, usually a few hours after the market close in New York. And if you just look at. I mean, think he's been talking about this for a while, out now, but the net inflows, meaning the inflows even after the grayscale outflows are extremely bullish. Right.
00:24:40.096 - 00:25:04.268, Speaker D: The past five days or so, we've had a 340 million inflows. 600, 3500, 500 and 4400, etcetera. It's really quite astonishing. Blackrock is contributing to most of that and really it's pretty encouraging. There seems to be a ton of demand for this thing, which is super exciting. And grayscale outflows have really slowed down. There's going to be a little increase with that big approval.
00:25:04.268 - 00:25:11.444, Speaker D: But overall, I think that's like, as we alluded to before, this all has to, you know, all of the bullishness has to come down to this.
00:25:11.604 - 00:25:11.940, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:11.972 - 00:25:40.524, Speaker B: And I guess I remember this thread from Jordy, last cycle of the shitcoin dilemma, where if bitcoin pumps, then degens look to go out the risk curve to buy altcoins. But if everyone buys altcoins, then there's no one buying bitcoin. And then when bitcoin goes down 10%, alts go down 30%. But if we're getting these passive flows in bitcoin, then maybe we can have crazy altseason. I can't even imagine what altis it looks like because it seems like, you know, it was like three years ago, you know, when it last happened.
00:25:41.464 - 00:26:01.244, Speaker D: It feels to me like we're already in alt season. It's just the. The right alts are pumping. The ones that are actually doing things that are innovating, that have a narrative around them are all up massive amounts. Right. But if you look at total three, it's not really representative of that because there's like thousands of junk coins out there that are legacy coins and should never return, in my opinion.
00:26:01.874 - 00:26:29.634, Speaker C: Yeah, my view on is that, like in Q four of last year, like, a lot of narratives pumped and, like, I think a lot of funds are like, pretty close to fully allocated on those narratives. So, like, I think the alt layer one thesis is like, you know, pretty saturated, but, like, new narratives that, like, maybe have lagged. I think we'll see a catch up this cycle. So, yeah, we'll see what those are. My money is still in CK, but. But I think there are other ones as well.
00:26:30.054 - 00:26:36.834, Speaker B: Now, how do you bid on ZK? Just matic and stark or Mina? And how do you bet on that?
00:26:37.374 - 00:26:48.350, Speaker C: Mina and Dusk actually did re rate from the stark launch, but I think Matic is one of the best risk. I'm shielding my bags now, but I think Matic is one of the best.
00:26:48.462 - 00:26:54.182, Speaker B: And they're going to rebrand, right. To a new token pol. Maybe that's bullish. New chart.
00:26:54.278 - 00:26:58.514, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah, a lot of things going on in it.
00:26:59.054 - 00:27:38.908, Speaker D: In addition to all of that, I did have pull up this tweet from Nick Carter that I wanted to touch on because it. It really does show that there is this bitcoin renaissance happening beyond just the ETF. And as someone that doesn't have any bitcoin, it's, you know, tough to see this, but also really exciting for the ecosystem. And Nick Carter sort of outlines all of these amazing things happening. The primary one, of course, being that ETF flows are beyond our wildest dreams, even according to the most bullish analysts, which is true. There's also talk about bid vms, so you can have optimistic roll ups without a soft fork explosion of vc dollars allocated to bitcoin startups. If you guys don't know, Nick Carter runs a fund that's for all of crypto, not just bitcoin.
00:27:38.908 - 00:28:05.524, Speaker D: But of course Nick has a focus on bitcoin ordinals is huge, BRC twenties are huge. ETH ETF's coming up and then also the having helis at the bottom. Of course, who knows what impact that has. But there really is a ton of stuff happening in the bitcoin space which is exciting to see because in some ways it felt like bitcoin sort of sat out the last cycle as far as development went and it doesnt seem to be the case now. It seems like a lots actually happening.
00:28:06.224 - 00:29:05.286, Speaker A: Yeah I think that both BTC and ETH future is very bright. Ive talked about this many times in the past that there is a huge supply squeeze coming and the last days look like a supply squeeze to me. Theres just not enough coins and dealer sands and OTC desk sands on exchanges to just handle an incremental demand spike that's coming. And that's where things get really kind of crazy on the other side. On the altcoins, I think yeah, a lot of them are pumping massive. The ones that have vc unlocks coming, there's probably just VC's just praying that the price doesn't change between now and the rest of the year when there's stuff gets unlocked. I've talked to some of the secondary desks and tried to get a sense of what bids like some of the VC's are kind of giving tokens at and it's surprisingly low.
00:29:05.286 - 00:29:37.304, Speaker A: Like there's stuff going for like 75% discount on current price, which means that retail is buying something that, you know, somebody is very happily willing to sell, you know, three quarters discount. And these are, you know, the bitcoins that are kind of publicly pumping, we don't need to mention. But you know, there's some doctor. I'm not going to say what kind of doctor it is, but it's Tia.
00:29:40.524 - 00:30:09.624, Speaker D: So look, I don't know how useful of a metric a discount that like a private round investor would be willing to pay. As though candidly, because if you're up 10,000% or a thousand x or 100 x, you're going to sell, right? Even if you have to take a 75% haircut, you're still up massive. It's a fund maker, right? Like are you. Don't you think it's smart to just take some off the table regardless, even if you're getting a huge discount?
00:30:10.084 - 00:31:11.110, Speaker A: Yeah, you'll sell. But then, like what's the clearing price? So like if there was a lot of demand they would see be at the fair value because, you know, you want to sell at like ten, but someone's willing to bid twelve and then like, you know, it'll settle at twelve, like there'll be an auction of some sort. The fact that, you know, somebody who could just put a catch and carry on. So basically, like, I could buy, let's say, like your celestia at like $8 and then I could like, for example, just an example and then hedge it at 20 and then just wait, whatever, three years. The reality is that people are not willing to do it because first of all, there's a lot of scenarios that we've seen even in 2022 where things go very negative on the funding rate. So trying to hold a perpetual for that long can be very risky in its own right. I think between the kind of mid 22 until the FTX collapse, it was just like pure negative funding rates.
00:31:11.110 - 00:31:23.254, Speaker A: Right. It's a tricky one and I just think that the ones that are going to get hurt the most are going to be the retail holding these things as domlocks actually happen, because then it's going to be like a bloodbath.
00:31:23.374 - 00:31:39.522, Speaker B: I feel like there's also this theory that people think that there's a four year cycle because they're having. But what if there's like a four year cycle because of those VC unlocks and they just like dump the altcoins? Is that like an unpopular opinion? It could be real, right?
00:31:39.618 - 00:32:07.798, Speaker A: Could be real. And again, you know, I'm very bullish. BTC and ETH going infinitely up. I don't think that there is a price at which they get overvalued because I think the price becomes an advertisement for more and more people to adopt. But I just keep emphasizing every week the difference between things that don't have a supply that keeps, you know, dumping constantly, like BTC and ETH. And, you know, there's other coins as well. Um, I would put on that list that don't have this like huge overhang.
00:32:07.798 - 00:32:54.232, Speaker A: You know, Solana is one that we talked about in the past. You know, I probably mistimed the fact that those unlocks were happening just as like, you know, a bull market was starting and those got eaten up. But we have heard this week that the galaxy and whoever is like, operating the a state has been looking at selling locked Solana tokens at a discount, and there's billions of dollars worth. That's sort of coming now. It's good that there might be potentially buyers of these locked tokens, but it probably suppresses demand because these funds would have bought on the open market, and now they're just like, well, I'm bullish, Solana. I'm going to buy at the 30% discount and just, like, hold the. Hold the upside.
00:32:54.232 - 00:33:12.504, Speaker A: So we'll see, but maybe it'll get absorbed, and 30% discount is not so bad. Like I said, I've been hearing about 70% for other coins. Cool. So let's go to the pasta of the week and see if Justin is going to keep his hot streak going. What do you got for us, Justin?
00:33:12.624 - 00:33:44.856, Speaker D: You know, I have a new strategy. When I'm on Twitter now, I just bookmark anything that I think could be a contender for pasta of the week. And now when it comes to, like, an hour before the show, I just scroll through my bookmarks and I'm set. I'm giving away pastas to the rest of the lads, but my entry is going to be from Silv XBT. He's tagged POTUS, the FBI, NATO at the SEC, and has said that starknet funds terrorists and the drug market. And then there's a screen cap of his zero stark allocation. I thought this was hilarious.
00:33:44.856 - 00:34:02.132, Speaker D: I think when. When you don't get an airdrop, we need to normalize going to the SEC reporting that project for defrauding you out of your hard earned stark tokens and dollars. So this just cracked me up when I saw it. Just the rage of some people. It really cracks me up. I love this one.
00:34:02.268 - 00:34:04.028, Speaker A: Classic Ct. I love it.
00:34:04.076 - 00:34:12.193, Speaker B: Yeah, I call this activist airdrop farming, where if you get an airdrop, you just blow post the shit out of it. And then if you don't get an airdrop, you just float it to death.
00:34:12.283 - 00:34:14.313, Speaker D: Name and shame. Name and shame.
00:34:14.613 - 00:34:22.565, Speaker A: I mean, Taiki has been doing that pretty actively. Right? Like, was there, like, some airdrops you were expecting for. For Tia that never happened?
00:34:22.709 - 00:34:41.509, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you know, like this. There's, like, this project called Saga who did an airdrop to me for as a TS taker. And I was like, yeah, like, this project going to zero. And then I get the dimension airdrop, and I'm like, wow, this is the future of finance. Like, obviously, I'm joking. Hopefully people can catch, like, this sarcasm when I show post on Twitter.
00:34:41.541 - 00:34:43.575, Speaker D: But we got you.
00:34:43.679 - 00:34:49.599, Speaker B: Yeah, it's somewhat true. You know, you just have to just. This blow post when teams Rorty and.
00:34:49.631 - 00:34:52.363, Speaker A: Let us see your pasta as well. What do you have, taki?
00:34:53.103 - 00:35:19.816, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is really close to my heart. Because I consider myself a humble farmer, and you can apply this concept of thinking like a farmer to the crypto markets as well. You know, don't shout at the crops. Don't shout at the devs for not giving you an airdrop. Don't blame the crop, right? Don't blame the coin for not pumping. Don't sell your crops before they've had the chance to grow. Like, irrigate, fertilize, stake, find ways to earn yield on your assets.
00:35:19.816 - 00:35:40.984, Speaker B: Remove weeds, unfollow random accounts that cluttering your timeline, and remember, you will have good season and bad seasons. You can't control the weather, only be prepared for it. So you can't predict the future, but you can be prepared for it. And I think everyone should have this mindset of, you know, like, you know, this is a bull market. Just be patient. Don't get yourself wrecked. Think like a farmer.
00:35:40.984 - 00:35:44.408, Speaker B: Just tend to your crops and just live a comfortable life.
00:35:44.536 - 00:35:59.528, Speaker D: It's funny, I remember when the term yield farmer came to the scene and it just fits so well. It works perfectly. Like, I think one day we're going to see, like, Merriam Webster added yield farming to the dictionary. That's, that's my bold prediction. In a few years, do we still.
00:35:59.576 - 00:36:22.130, Speaker A: Have like, traditional yield farmers or have things changed? Take you. I mean, I remember last time, you know, you had all these things, you would just deposit one sided liquidity or sometimes two sided, but you just get like 40, 50% APY. I don't really see too much of that, like, random shitcoin pool two stuff. Is that true? Like, is it moved on to airdrop farming and other stuff now?
00:36:22.322 - 00:37:07.480, Speaker B: Yeah, because last, like, when no one knew what the hell they were doing. So pull two farms worked, but now everyone is more educated that inflation is bad. So now everyone has just migrated to airdrop farming. It's like the new meta. And I was talking about this with Justin, but he was like, what are some apps in crypto that people use? And I was like, the only use case in crypto right now on chain is just airdrop farm. Just use projects with no tokens and pray to God that you'll receive some hefty token airdrop. So, yeah, everyone, I do think that the meta right now is airdrop farming, but I don't really think that it's going to end because it's like the only way, it's like the primary way for devs to drop tokens.
00:37:07.480 - 00:37:11.000, Speaker B: So betting against it is like betting that devs are not going to drop tokens.
00:37:11.192 - 00:37:12.896, Speaker A: Thank you. What do you have for us?
00:37:13.080 - 00:37:27.644, Speaker C: This is just a commentary on the recent price action, how there's AP into bitcoin. Also think for you, lagging pretty hard and everyone's waiting for, like, a alt BTC version. So let's see if we get what everyone wants.
00:37:27.944 - 00:37:28.960, Speaker B: I love this one.
00:37:29.072 - 00:37:31.524, Speaker D: Well, I mean, this meme never gets old.
00:37:31.864 - 00:38:03.176, Speaker A: You know, it does feel like some alts are doing extremely well and some are doing nothing at all. So it's a little bit of a bifurcated market. I've seen Zeta, one of the recent launches that we were talking about, is just pumping unlimited nonstop. And then you have, like, a bunch of stuff that's just flat. So quite interesting to see. Thankfully, Justin's mantle bags have been on the good side of it. We had some listings in.
00:38:03.176 - 00:38:06.088, Speaker A: In Korea, I think the year of the Dragon baby.
00:38:06.136 - 00:38:08.136, Speaker D: If you know, you know, you know.
00:38:08.160 - 00:38:10.336, Speaker C: You know, you know.
00:38:10.480 - 00:38:25.784, Speaker A: We'll talk about that soon. So my pasta we can bring up. It's still related to this airdrop stuff. It seems to be the biggest talking point this week. But, you know, this is the feeling when you don't get an airdrop.
00:38:29.204 - 00:38:41.664, Speaker D: I love these clips in the Super bowl. It's always so sad when, like, the other team is just getting rained on confetti, the other team's colors. It's like, this is what it feels like to not own BTC right now. Honestly.
00:38:44.104 - 00:39:11.240, Speaker A: The Stark Airdrop, you know, is confetti. Like, some people got, like, massive amounts right and then, like, other people are sort of at zero. So it's. It's quite appropriate. So we'll let the audience choose the winner in the comments. And, you know, we do read the comments to that guy that seems to always think that we're bearish. I keep saying, like, I'm always like, hella bullish long on major, so I don't know.
00:39:11.272 - 00:39:15.760, Speaker D: Like, the only bullish one here has been Vicki. And he flipped to bullish.
00:39:15.912 - 00:39:18.784, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. I think he has now flipped from.
00:39:18.904 - 00:39:21.016, Speaker B: He joined us, moon boy.
00:39:21.040 - 00:39:27.800, Speaker A: Now he flipped from 47, it sounds. Was it a painful right up to 47 before. Before you flip the key?
00:39:27.832 - 00:39:34.772, Speaker C: Like, well, I was like, short alts. I wasn't short bitcoin. So, like, didn't lose much on that front. And I was long bitcoin against.
00:39:34.968 - 00:39:36.020, Speaker B: Always hedged.
00:39:36.172 - 00:40:05.364, Speaker D: Before we sign off, can I just highlight one comment that that bothered me? We get. I read every comment, and Andrew McMurray 8081 said, if you think about it, this entire pod is just criticism of almost every project they discuss, everything's not very good and they all want to crash. It is true that almost all projects are not very good, but I don't want to crash. So this tweet is only or this post post is only half correct Andrew and we'll accept your apology in the comments below.
00:40:05.664 - 00:40:09.284, Speaker C: I only want it to crash so it can come back up again. Like Max long.
00:40:09.704 - 00:40:12.484, Speaker D: Exactly. We just want to buy lower dude.
00:40:13.224 - 00:40:46.268, Speaker A: I mean the reality is most of the crypto YouTube are just like nonstop like acting as if every single project is the best thing since sliced bread reflective upon even like the good coins, right? Like ETH BTC we still talk about like some of the issues that they have and that goes for for everything. So it's good to see both sides and and hopefully most people don't just want moon boys. Thanks everybody for joining us and we'll see you next week with a guest as well. Take care.
00:40:46.436 - 00:40:47.476, Speaker C: Well, which guest?
00:40:47.620 - 00:40:48.956, Speaker A: Oh, you'll see thikki.
00:40:49.100 - 00:40:49.764, Speaker D: It's a big one.
