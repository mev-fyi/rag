00:00:20.480 - 00:00:49.484, Speaker A: Welcome, steady, lads. No Andrei Grachev with us this week, although hopefully it's still gonna be a good episode. I guess to kick off guys like, we did get a little bit of pushback. Hopefully it was contained. It wasn't as much as we feared. But when you bring on a controversial figure and you platform them, even if you ask them some tough questions, that is in the public interest for those to get answered. There's always going to be some people that get angry that you're even talking to this person.
00:00:49.484 - 00:01:06.536, Speaker A: As we were discussing with Andre, people like GSR saying that shouldn't even be in the same room. But I'm pretty happy that we managed to get somebody that's mostly in the shadows and ask them some questions. What was your guys reaction to last week?
00:01:06.680 - 00:01:37.816, Speaker B: I thought it was a pretty good episode. I think, like I mentioned at the beginning of last week's episode, I think he kind of had his guard up at the beginning. I think he was kind of giving some pc answers. But then near the end, I think he kind of just lined up and I think we got to see the man behind this garage facade, at least on Twitter. And, I mean, he sounded like a nice guy. Obviously, I don't really know him that well, but, you know, we'll see how DWF does in the next couple of months, in the next couple of quarters.
00:01:37.920 - 00:02:08.088, Speaker C: Yeah, I missed this pushback, unfortunately. I'll have to try to try to dig it up. But I don't know, I just feel like it's not really our job to be basically police what guests we bring on, necessarily, and, like, stop some people from coming on. For instance, I would be more than happy to have SPF on to interview him. Right. And he's certainly more of a scammer, I would guess, than, you know, anyone is possibly alleging DWF to be. So I think, like, we want to, at least I want to interview people that are notable and doing interesting things in the crypto space.
00:02:08.088 - 00:02:19.242, Speaker C: And from there, like, we let the audience make a determination if they want to, you know, like that person, dislike that person. Like, I don't really want to be having those opinions for our audience. I want to let them decide.
00:02:19.368 - 00:02:51.174, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with that. I think there's a lot of, like, I guess, PTSD from last cycle about people, let's say, legitimizing SPF or Dokwon. Like, pretty much any association with them, like, in any interview format, was kind of like, I guess, in retrospect, frowned upon. But, yeah, like Justin said, I do think like, talking to people that are actually the main characters of the space and, like, doing things that are influencing markets or influencing, like, public perception towards a space are very important. Important to, I guess, shed light on. So, yeah, I don't think there's any issue there. I'm glad we wrote that.
00:02:51.294 - 00:03:32.674, Speaker A: I mean, with SPF, you know, at some point, he was just going on this crazy media tour, public blitz, trying to get his side of the story, and it was just clear that he was lying. And there was nothing of value after, like, ten or 20 of these. But if you have, like, a rare opportunity to get it from the horse's mouth, even from a controversial figure, I think it's. It's like a clear win. Even if they're getting exposure. I don't think that anybody is giving DWF, for example, business based on our interview. It would certainly be based on the terms that they're being given and whether they want to take those terms.
00:03:32.834 - 00:03:50.998, Speaker C: There's just this weird thing happening in the world that's not just crypto focused, where people expect people like us or people even more notable than us, to sort of, like, censor what the audience sees. I think that stuff is crazy, personally. I do not think, like, the audience is stupid.
00:03:51.046 - 00:03:51.206, Speaker D: Right?
00:03:51.230 - 00:04:08.858, Speaker C: Like, I think if you take that mindset that, like, we have to be the judge of what the audience sees, that's just the backwards way to think about it. Like, we should just present what we're able to present, and then the audience, like, is smart enough to make their own determination. I mean, I've. I fundamentally believe that, like, everyone has a right to watch whatever content they watch.
00:04:08.986 - 00:04:47.634, Speaker D: And there's kind of, like, an ethical debate. I think it's kind of interesting to bring up because, like, this week, Suzu was arrested in Singapore for, I believe it was, like, contempt in court, and he was put in jail for four months for basically, like, you know, not respecting a liquidator's request to, like, get some meaningful communication out of him. And then you're seeing people Twitter. Like, they said that, like, people were shilling locks over the past few months, and then when this news came out, they were, like, apologizing, and they were saying, like, oh, I'm sorry. Sorry for ever shilling ox. Like, this is a lapse in judgment or whatever. It's just kind of interesting how, like, just because he's arrested for contempt of core doesn't, like, doesn't really change, you know, whether you're.
00:04:47.634 - 00:05:02.594, Speaker D: It shouldn't change. Like, your perception of whether what you did was right or wrong. It seems. I don't know. It just seems kind of interesting when people, like, are so quick to, I don't know, like, change their public, like, their endorsements on, like, things that, like, don't seemingly have any material.
00:05:02.974 - 00:05:39.128, Speaker A: Maybe it was probably based on the price going down a lot, which I think is always a risk. And even with rollbit, for example, there's a lot of people that are very bullish on rollbit and talking about how it's burning so much that obviously a multiple of, I don't know what the P ratio sort of say would be on rollbit. It's definitely low. It might be like three or four years of earnings. But the reality is in six months, we could have it shut down by the FBI. And then it doesn't matter that it was like a three P ratio. Like, you're basically going to zero at that point.
00:05:39.128 - 00:05:48.360, Speaker A: And people that shill it now might feel bad. It's really hard to predict these things. And I can understand that somebody who makes a bad recommendation can feel guilty.
00:05:48.472 - 00:06:00.218, Speaker B: It kind of depends for the aux apologizer. If they took money from aux, I think they should potentially apologize. If they were shilling it to their audience, if they were just saying that, hey, like, this is like a suzukoin.
00:06:00.266 - 00:06:01.066, Speaker A: It's a meme coin.
00:06:01.130 - 00:06:21.786, Speaker B: It's like ox hated coin pump. Or, you know, like, whatever the thesis was, you know, like, like Justin said, you know, like, we shouldn't assume that the audience is, like, dumb, right? Like, we should present ideas and let the audience decide, like, whether something is a good. A good buy or good sell. And I think that's kind of like the direction every, like, show has their.
00:06:21.810 - 00:06:47.512, Speaker A: Own type of audience, right? Like, we have a. Probably a more sophisticated audience, or they know a lot about crypto and they can make these judgments. They're. They're not getting, like, bamboozled, you know, based on whatever. I bet that our audience would love to, you know, what if, like, Suzu comes out of prison and wants to come onto our podcast, I'm sure, like, all of our audience would. Would be very interested to see what he would have to say. And, you know, sometimes I have to make a call on these things.
00:06:47.512 - 00:07:19.258, Speaker A: I was offered to go on Mario Nafwall's, like, big crypto Twitter spaces where he. It has 5000 people, 6000 people. I don't know how many are bots or real. I have no clue every time, but it definitely comes up. And this week I decided to say, okay, let me check it out. And of course, I immediately get, like, screenshotted with, you know, a bunch of questionable characters. And, you know, at this point, to Adam's credit, when I posted, if you.
00:07:19.258 - 00:08:11.196, Speaker A: If you saw his response, he's. He's got this gif of like, yeah, that's me. How probably wondering how I ended up in this situation. Some of these guys, they have a big following, and even if they talk a bunch of shit and maybe, like, you know, are not necessarily, like, the. The most intellectual commentators, I do respect what they're good at, right? Just like I respect Donald Trump and what he's good at, which is just being an incredible shit talker and being able to meme his way to this level of public godlike status. And even bitboy, I don't think highly of bitboy, but the fact that he's able to grow a large audience, I think there's at least something to respect and potentially learn from. And that's my general stance on these things.
00:08:11.340 - 00:08:38.244, Speaker C: I agree completely. I mean, this stuff just really isn't our job, right? Like, if, you know, if we were working with the DOJ, the FBI, or the SEC, it makes sense, right? Do not talk to these people, etc. But, like, that's literally not our job. There are people that do that, that police these things, and they do, presumably a great job at it. And I just. I don't view that as our role. I view our role as to just present what we can present to the audience that we think will be interesting and let them decide and make their own judgment.
00:08:38.364 - 00:09:15.936, Speaker D: It's just annoying because, like, I was gonna say the audience, like, the audience's version of ethics is, like, so sometimes it's just so low iq, and it's like they're so incapable of understanding, like, nuance in certain things, especially when it's like, there's, like, a retrospect bias where it's like, you know, there's, like, a probabilistic play that it just turns out a certain way and they, like, look back at what, like you said or who you associated with and, like, oh, yeah. Like, this guy, like, associated with a scammer or this guy, like, had an idea that, like, was probabilistic and it didn't work out. Therefore, like, you know, make it, like, a really easy judgment. Based on that. I think I find it kind of annoying.
00:09:16.080 - 00:10:06.476, Speaker A: I agree. The two most kind of, like, beloved podcasters of the last bull market, like, up only and crypto cred, who we had on the show, they were both sponsored by FTX or blockfolio, and they're obviously very good people, but people can throw it at them as if it's some kind of gotcha that you were promoting a scammer. It can definitely go too far. And I think it's easy to have a gang mentality when something bad happens and everybody's with the pitchforks and we have this common urge to attack and gang up on anybody associated. But there are certain lines, and I feel very comfortable with finding a middle ground on these things. Hopefully, you guys do as well. Yeah.
00:10:06.516 - 00:10:41.074, Speaker D: As it's very much, like the frontier of ethics, I think because, like, social networks and social media is so new, it's, like, such a recent invention of the 2010s that, like, I guess making investment decisions or, you know, what can be construed as investment decisions based on, like, social networks is a very new sort of element of. Because, like, just recently there was, like, a group of people that got, like, $100 million fine and put in jail for, like, shilling stuff on Twitter, like equity, like pump and dumping equities on Twitter, for example. Do you guys remember that? It's like a very, I don't know, very recent sort of thing that, like, I think, like, the ethics is still very new and still, like, being formed to this day.
00:10:41.374 - 00:11:16.434, Speaker A: Absolutely. I'm glad that we're kind of going back to our ethics podcast. That was one of my personal favorites. So it's good to dip into that. Speaking of ethics, I mean, we're starting to see the SPF trial start, and Michael Lewis has been going on a press tour about his new book and some of the insides that he's had, inside views that he's had on that empire and the collapse of it. I don't know if you guys have had a chance to see the 60 Minutes segments, but it's made a lot of people angry in a lot of places I've seen.
00:11:16.554 - 00:11:41.424, Speaker C: Yeah, I can talk about the 60 minutes piece. I'm a big 60 minutes fan. I watched it live. I haven't read the book yet, but it's on the way. It should get here tomorrow. The 60 minutes was very interesting because it did a good job of almost making you feel bad for SPF, actually. So I, you know, I came into this pretty aware of the situation, and I came out honestly doubting my awareness of the situation a little bit.
00:11:41.424 - 00:12:18.930, Speaker C: That's how effective it was. So it's pretty subtle. But Michael Lewis basically says the 60 minutes asks him, do you think this was fraud or just a mistake? And he basically says, this was just a mistake. And he sort of goes through his reasons why. And there's also a lot of footage sort of implying that, that he was really just oblivious. He was focused on doing good and focused on, you know, what he was building and not focused on following the money. And they just totally did not mention that he effectively took customer funds, stole them from customers, bet on VC bets, which the upside would not have been returned to depositors.
00:12:18.930 - 00:12:48.822, Speaker C: He would have kept that. He traded on Alameda with it. He took hundreds of millions of dollars of personal loans for him and his employees, and he donated to politicians. So to ignore that and just say it was an accounting mistake and not outright fraud seems absurd to me. I don't know how you can just sort of mistakenly spend billions of dollars of customer money and it not be fraud. But 60 minutes to their credit, they did a great piece, and it made me almost question my beliefs around this.
00:12:48.918 - 00:13:27.608, Speaker A: I think in general, when I see Michael Lewis, I have a lot less respect than most people as a default. Just with flash boys, it's one of those things where you think someone knows what they're talking about, but then as soon as they talk about something that you actually know very well, you realize that they don't. And then maybe actually everything else they talk about is probably lacking in sophistication. Because if you can call out your specialty, then somebody who is a specialist at something else can probably call them out. And I've had this impression, despite the liars, poker kind of lower that he has from old school traders.
00:13:27.736 - 00:14:15.238, Speaker B: Yeah. I actually enjoyed moneyball by Michael Lewis. That actually got me into baseball analytics. And I was interviewing for some baseball teams back in college, authors and I guess tv people like media people, right? If they become like generalists, it's kind of like the Jim Cramer meme where Jim Cramer, he's just like forced to talk about everything, whether it be crypto, commodities, stocks, different sectors. And it's just so easy to meme when he just says general things and the market turns against him. And it's always a risk that people have to face whenever they're so public facing that you have to admit that no one's an expert in all facets of, I guess, like financial markets. And it's really easy to just kind of like, go back to what people said and say, this guy's dumb.
00:14:15.238 - 00:14:19.934, Speaker B: It's kind of like how social media works, I guess, getting engagement and whatnot.
00:14:20.014 - 00:14:51.244, Speaker A: And then looking at this trial that's starting. Shkareli is on fire on Twitter. He's been saying that we might see who chef Nomi is and all kinds of sarcastic comments about everything. We might see some interesting revelations, and there's. The reality is, you know, some of the big players that have probably been cooperating with the feds. I don't know if Trabuco is one of them. He doesn't seem to appear in many things, but we might finally start to see some of the surprises that the prosecutors have been preparing.
00:14:51.944 - 00:14:58.272, Speaker B: Where is Trabuko? Is he like a Dubai or something? I haven't heard about him in so long.
00:14:58.448 - 00:14:59.616, Speaker A: I don't think anyone knows.
00:14:59.680 - 00:14:59.868, Speaker D: But.
00:14:59.896 - 00:15:44.316, Speaker A: But most old school poker players will know that the counsel for FTX was this guy who was involved in the ultimate bet scandal and very potentially culpable in that. And apparently he could be one of the people that will be forced to flip on SPF. So it'll be interesting. The books had some amazing memes, and we might have some pastas of the week from that coming up later. But we wanted to do a new segment this week, and we can only do four of them total. So this is section a of potentially a four part segment called Meet the Lads. And, you know, the chosen one this week is thicke.
00:15:44.316 - 00:16:08.660, Speaker A: I think it's an opportunity for three of us to talk to Thiki, and maybe let's quickly tell the audience how this podcast even came to be. I think, you know, some of us know each other a little bit, but. But not everybody knew each other, and a lot of us have created links through this podcast. I think. Thiki, I had met you before, but I don't think you had met the other two.
00:16:08.772 - 00:16:15.864, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. I was aware of Taiki's YouTube channel, and I thought he was actually salsa tequila, the other Twitter account.
00:16:16.604 - 00:16:27.000, Speaker A: I can just tell you salsa is. Is like, at least 60, 70% taller than me and Taiki, and he's a frequent listener, so. Hi, salsa. I'm sure you're listening.
00:16:27.112 - 00:16:38.112, Speaker D: Hi, salsa. Yeah, I haven't met Justin before. I think it met him through the podcast, but I was very aware of his co founder, Joseph DeLong. Right.
00:16:38.208 - 00:17:02.134, Speaker A: Talk about, you know, potentially controversial figures. You know, he's a very outspoken Twitter personality, especially, I think, at some points of the bull market, there were some kind of epic tweets. So I'm curious at some point to hear about your collaboration, Justin, but this week is all about Thicci. We gotta ask. This is meet thiki this week. So, Justin, do you wanna meet your co host?
00:17:02.594 - 00:17:22.264, Speaker C: Yeah, I would love to. We haven't met in person, unfortunately, yet, but hopefully soon at a conference, or maybe we'll do a study lads in person one day. But, yeah, like, can you give us your backstory? Where'd you grow up? What were your interests? Where'd you go to college? Etcetera? Do you want to just start from the top?
00:17:22.384 - 00:18:09.214, Speaker D: So I grew up in Texas, and I studied computer science in college, and I was, like, kind of a very sheltered kid. So, like, when I got to college and, like, I discovered weed in poker, it was kind of all I did for the first year or two. I just, you know, just smoked a bunch, took some Adderall, and played poker every day. And I ended up, like, failing out of a few of my cs classes for the first few years, but I got really good at poker, and after the first two years, I realized I needed to, like, actually try hard in school again. So the next two years were like, you know, very kind of just, like, catching up slack. And I got pretty lucky with the job. I got out of college.
00:18:09.214 - 00:18:52.884, Speaker D: I was working in a high frequency training firm, and the person that hired me there was also very into poker. He had, like, a. Used to play professionally, and we kind of, like, bonded over, I guess, just, like, the types of, you know, thinking about the world, like, through the lens of, like, you know, probabilistic bets and, like, expected value. And I think for him, it was like, a lot of his success in HFT was due to the fact that he was able to succeed in poker. And I think, like, yeah, I just. It was able to land a job through that. And I worked in HFT for, like, three years, primarily trading equities systematically, just like we were one of, like, the biggest market makers for, you know, all the names you could imagine.
00:18:53.004 - 00:19:25.120, Speaker C: So I think over the past week, we've actually seen some interesting tweets about working at high frequency trading firms out of college, and the salaries are nuts. So I don't know, maybe you can shed light on this, but I've seen tweets literally this week that said, like, the range could be 300k for someone directly out of school to, you know, upwards of millions of dollars. How is the competition so outsized? Is this an incredibly competitive field to get into? You know, how did you get the job? And can you talk a little bit about the compensation range for right out of school?
00:19:25.252 - 00:20:12.928, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that range is pretty accurate. It can vary a lot, too, just based on, like, because I think, like, at the top of, like, the hiring spectrum, like, the amount, the amount of talent can, like, vary drastically. And I think, like, it's very easy for someone straight out of college to come in and just, like, improve the system. Like, 50 bps, 100 bps, and then, like, actually make the firm, like, a ton of money that way, which is why they are able to pay so much. I think, like, a new hire can easily add, like, you know, a few million to, like, you know, tens of millions of dollars of p and l from the get go. So that's part of the reason why they're able to pay. And that's part of the reason why it's so competitive to get in, because it's kind of like, yeah, it's very, like, high impact role.
00:20:13.056 - 00:20:30.216, Speaker C: How is it, though, that someone right out of college, like, I'm not saying you weren't. You're not, obviously very smart, top of your class, talented, but, like, how is it that you have a skill set where you can add that much value to the firm? Is it through your computer science background? Where's that edge coming from?
00:20:30.320 - 00:21:08.364, Speaker D: Yeah, I think Jordy can speak to this, too, but I almost feel, I guess, the quant trait. There's so many different types of quant traders. You can be very good at programming and low latency stuff. You can be very good at statistics and sort of measuring the shape in the form of data and finding insights that way. Or you can be very good at, like, trading intuition, which is kind of like understanding the rules of the game and understanding how to make good bets and, like, risk taking and that sort of stuff. So I think, like, the mold shifts. Some people are very good at, like, one, two, or even all three.
00:21:08.364 - 00:21:18.586, Speaker D: For me, I was definitely, like, I was, like, proficient enough at, like, programming, proficient enough statistics, but definitely, like, the trading intuition side is something that, like, I thought I was, like, elite at.
00:21:18.690 - 00:21:38.258, Speaker C: How did they assess your ability before joining? Right. I mean, like, presumably you had no. Or very little work experience. Maybe some internships. But, like, how do they know that they can take that big of a bet on you? Because you're also managing capital, too, right? So it's not just the outsized salary for someone, you know, like, with that level of experience, it's also that you could lose a lot of money for the firm. Right.
00:21:38.346 - 00:22:02.690, Speaker D: You're not managing too much, but it is. It is like, you could make a mistake that could lose a lot of money. Typically, the best firms have really good risk management systems, and you're only working on. You're working on a systematic strategy, so it'll just stop trading if you lose a few thousand bucks or something like that. So they have it set up so that it's very asymmetric, where if you mess up, you learn pretty quickly, you don't lose too much money, and then if you do well, you can easily scale something up and make a ton of money.
00:22:02.802 - 00:22:21.660, Speaker C: So you obviously left. Was your thinking basically that you're doing all of this work for an employer when you can adopt these same strategies as an individual and reap all of that, reward yourself. Like, what was the thinking there to leave such a seemingly, like, cushy job with, you know, great prospects?
00:22:21.812 - 00:22:56.634, Speaker D: For me, it was a very tough decision to leave. I thought I was just gonna work there forever. Like, you know, it was great company. My boss and I had a great relationship, and it was a great seat on a great team. But I guess, you know, just the allure and the greed of crypto got to me. I guess just, like, the back of my head is, like, you know, if I have a good year here, like, maybe make like a million, 2 million a year, maybe a little bit more. But, like, if you have a good year in crypto, you can easily just make like, eight, nine figures, just complete generational wealth if you get lucky enough and, you know, you find the right opportunities.
00:22:56.634 - 00:23:02.434, Speaker D: So I guess that, like, unlimited upside was something that was kind of attractive to me, for better or for worse.
00:23:02.554 - 00:23:37.126, Speaker A: So you worked in HFT, and then sounds like a tough decision to leave or not leave, but you saw unicorn and you wanted to chase the unicorn and the different type of world, right? Like, you go from just HFT trading to potentially trying to build a big protocol and be a part of a large valuation. Was it, you know, the lure of. Of potentially being a part of a large multiple and kind of seeing the bull market, what made you change your mind about leaving?
00:23:37.310 - 00:24:12.258, Speaker D: While I was working at HFT, I was also trying to participate in the bull market in crypto, and we had a strategy that would snipe Solana nfts based on just snipe rare nfts at the floor price. Because the market was so inefficient and it was relatively big, we were able to make a lot more doing that than I was working at my job. And in my mind, I was like, if this much opportunity is there and I'm working part time, then imagine how much could be there if I was working full time. I guess that was a big factor of why.
00:24:12.386 - 00:24:26.118, Speaker A: And then going from trading to trying to be on the building side, obviously, now you're back on the trading side. Um, you know, it's a different world, it's completely different. How did you, how did you switch around?
00:24:26.246 - 00:24:52.682, Speaker D: Yeah, I really don't like the building side. I feel like, I guess me as a person, I kind of really need really quick and fast iteration cycles, which, like, trading, especially like trading gives you really quickly, whereas like building, you know, like, the iteration cycles and the feedback loops are like, much longer. It could be like weeks to months to years. And, yeah, I guess it just wasn't as fulfilling to me as trading was. So that's why I switched over.
00:24:52.858 - 00:25:19.664, Speaker B: I feel like your Twitter just came out of nowhere earlier this year, what made you want to start a Twitter account? And I guess you started writing these threads around swap v three lp, profitability, market structure. What have you gained from posting on Twitter? You know, like, do you recommend our audience to, you know, also do the same? Like, try to get yourself out there? Was it scary at first, you know, putting yourself out there, stuff like that.
00:25:20.004 - 00:25:53.294, Speaker D: I started off by, like, I was doing some research in Uniswap. Just, I was just gonna release like, a long form research piece. But, like, my friend Defi guy from, he's working on Phoenix right now, he saw the dashboard and he, like, sort of tweeted at uniswap and then they replied. And, like, it started this sort of kind of, like, drama where Uniswap said it was thing wrong. And when it released the thread, it got, like, a lot more engagement than I expected. It was like the week before FTX collapsed and it had like a few million impressions. And, like, this is coming from someone with like 700 followers, 500 followers at the time.
00:25:53.294 - 00:26:18.726, Speaker D: I guess it just sparked some dopamine sort of reception in my head. I was like, wow, I can get a lot of feedback for showing people what they want to see. And also, like, I thought it was a really good cause by just writing about things that people were interested in, in teaching people. I've always liked teaching people, so I just started doing that a bunch. And then over the first two quarters of the year, I guess the account really took off.
00:26:18.830 - 00:26:19.142, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:19.198 - 00:26:43.564, Speaker B: And I think recently you started tweeting about shorting alts, like hedging with long VTC, putting that type of trade in. I think Justin was interested in this, too. What do you think about technical analysis? And do you even use ta when you enter these trades? Or is it more like thinking about inflows, outflows, like news? What would you say is, like, your edge nowadays? Because the markets are pretty choppy now.
00:26:43.644 - 00:27:17.300, Speaker D: I mean, I think everyone trading discretionary ends up kind of using technical analysis, well, the most. One of the most important things about discretionary training is just, like, having conviction and being able to, like, see your ideas through. So, like, you know, thesis, long term thesis gives you long term conviction. But, like, if you want, like, a shorter term conviction of, like, oh, this is a local high, this is a local low. Like, this is my entry, and I'm, like, very happy with it. I think technical analysis can help you, like, sort of pick certain spots and just, like, you know, optimize your entry a little bit. Yeah, I think.
00:27:17.300 - 00:27:19.284, Speaker D: I think there's actually something there with technical analysis.
00:27:19.404 - 00:27:54.996, Speaker C: Can you say a little bit more about, like, what that means to you? Like, because, like, when I hear technical analysis, like, normally I'm thinking of these, like, ridiculous terms for, like, silly patterns, right? That, like, I personally don't believe in. But, like, for you, does it mean, like, reverse woji head and shoulders double alpha pattern? Or is it more like, okay, there's like, an upward sloping trend here. Like, like, you know, like, can you talk a little bit about what ta you're doing? Like, where can people learn more and what sort of, like, basis for this stuff actually being helpful? Have you seen, like, factually or statistically, I should say.
00:27:55.100 - 00:28:29.632, Speaker D: I mean, I don't have too much experience myself, but I have heard of some desks doing this where, you know, they just feed in a bunch of, like, ema, like, exponential moving averages, and they feed in a bunch of, like, you know, RSI magnetic indicators. And they just try to, like, you know, use those, like, weak predictors to, like, fit a signal and, like, they can do it quite profitably. And, like, my assumption, I haven't also, like, looked at this rigorously, but, like, my assumption is that, like, a lot of the patterns that, like, we notice by eye can, like, can be quantified and combined in a way that, like, can be captured by, like, some algorithms to make money off of.
00:28:29.688 - 00:29:11.444, Speaker A: The reality is trading. If you want to make money, you're either somebody that can really move markets and actually be the guy. Definitely. Three arrows, for example, was a firm that was trying to actively move markets, and Alameda is probably in that category as well, or you're someone that's trying to move around it. And most people don't have that size of the multi billion size. So the vast majority of traders and people that are trying to make money, the right way to think about it is the way you make money is by front running the market movers. So you might see that there's going to be a Celsius coin sale or Mount gox coin sale, and you want to front run it by getting short.
00:29:11.444 - 00:29:57.444, Speaker A: That's exactly what's happening. You're predicting these moves, and sometimes the big whales, what they do is they're going to just twap into a position for this potential FTX estate. Coins that galaxy has, they might just get t wap. And we saw a short squeeze on Solana because maybe people got a little bit ahead of themselves thinking that it was going to start imminently and maybe itll start in a couple of weeks and they got it wrong. But the way to look about it with Ta is that sometimes the behavior of the whales is kind of predictable. Like they might be defending a certain level. So that, you know, you could have just have a foundation that says, like, you know, if our coin goes below $20, we're going to rebuy at $20.
00:29:57.444 - 00:30:40.032, Speaker A: And that's like the price at which we're, we're happy to sustain. And on a chart, what you will see is because you don't know what's happening behind the scenes, but you just see the price action and you'll see that the price starts to go towards 20 and then it just bounces. And then it happens a couple times. And, you know, technical analysts would have all these fancy mumbo jumbo words, which I agree with you, like, some of them sound like total Sci-Fi they might say, like, this is a triple, triple test and got rejected or whatever, but there's some. There's some there there where, you know, potentially there is. There's one of these whales. And like we talked about, the whole point is to front run these whales that has a behavior around certain price levels and, um, you know, creates.
00:30:40.032 - 00:31:05.804, Speaker A: Creates a certain predictable, uh, reaction. And it's not 100%, but, you know, you might get 70 30. And in trading, anything, anything above, like 52, 48 is, uh, is something that you can make money on long term if you execute properly. Anyway, back to thicc. I mean, tell us a little bit about your alpha process. I know sometimes, uh, you know, at simidar capital, you're. You're getting promotions, but you started as a junior busboy.
00:31:05.804 - 00:31:15.224, Speaker A: Sounds like your boss is a little bit happier with you. But do you make decisions together or you kind of each make separate decisions or how do you guys do things?
00:31:16.684 - 00:31:25.956, Speaker D: Yeah, we typically manage our own books. And whenever I just draw down too much, you kind of test my shoulder and says, you got to get out.
00:31:26.140 - 00:31:44.262, Speaker A: Is it like chess where you have your strategy and if somebody is trying to tell you what move to play. Like, you just want them to be quiet because you have a plan and they're trying to interfere with, like, you know, you know where your entries and exits are and they're trying to get involved. Or, or is it actually beneficial to have outside input for you?
00:31:44.398 - 00:32:02.078, Speaker D: I think it's beneficial. I think a lot of times, yeah, you're kind of, like, navigating like a ship whenever you take on a position and, like, you know, always having more voices, more perspectives, especially since, like, when you're steering the ship, you get really biased, too. So having just, like, someone who's unbiased to kind of keep you in check, it's been very helpful.
00:32:02.166 - 00:32:25.214, Speaker B: Do you have, like, rules set on, like, what percent of your book do you risk portrayed? Because I think with, like, the short alts, long majors trade, it seems like you have really high conviction. But do you have, like, rules say, you know, like, I'm not going to put more than 10% my book into this or, you know, depending on the conviction, are you willing to put, like, half your book or, like, even your entire book into it? Like, how does, like, that process go for you?
00:32:25.334 - 00:33:05.374, Speaker D: I definitely, like, always before I put on the bet, like, understand how much of the book I'm risking. And that number has been growing up and up increasingly as, I guess, like, had more successful trades and more conviction in, like, what I'm doing. So, like, more and more recently, we're, like, you know, going, you're using higher and higher leverage on bets and risking more of the book based on, like, conviction. But, I mean, yeah, I think I'd be comfortable going, like, actually just like putting 1020 x leverage of the entire book on a certain trade. If you had enough conviction, like, what.
00:33:05.414 - 00:33:08.030, Speaker B: Type of play would have to present itself for you to, like, do that?
00:33:08.062 - 00:33:44.834, Speaker D: Like, it has to be something where it's just like, the risk of ruin is so low. So, like, for example, like, if Blackrock gets approved and you're the first one to find it, like, there's just almost no chance that market's going down, like, 5% after Blackrock approval, especially in the next 30 minutes. So in those situations, you can pretty comfortably, like, just jam, you know, 1020 x book into a trade and just cut out super early just to lock in good profit. So it's those types of trades where it's, like, higher sharp and those news types of trades where it's almost inevitable where the path is going to go after in like, 10, 15, 30 minutes.
00:33:45.134 - 00:34:17.168, Speaker C: Do you have a plan? Or is there, like, credible way that you would hear about something like that ahead of time? Or, like, be one of the first to hear about it? I mean, I know last, a couple weeks ago, you talked about having an alarm set where anytime court documents were released publicly regarding Solana, FTX, etcetera came out, you would basically get an alert and, you know, not have an edge over the rest of the market, but presumably, like, no one else is doing that, or there's only a couple people doing that. And I saw Jordy spoke about that on the panel as well. I thought it was super interesting.
00:34:17.216 - 00:34:58.021, Speaker D: So the edge is just, like, where you focus your attention. Like, are you paying attention in areas that other people aren't? And if it's something where it just doesn't have enough, like, for example, like, the ETH futures launch over the past, over yesterday, ETH BTC climbed up, like, 4% over three days leading up to the events. And, like, you could have, people knew about the state for a month. So if you're paying attention and, like, you tactically chose a point to enter that position, you could, like, put in a lot of size, and HPTC is write it up three, 4% and, like, make a good amount if. And it's like, it's such an obvious trade. Right? It's just like, having that plan set up beforehand is what the edge is. It's just like.
00:34:58.077 - 00:35:09.814, Speaker C: Yeah, when you're wrong. Right. Well, like, what's that like for you emotionally? Like, if you lose, you know, 510 percent of your portfolio, is that just devastating? Like, for me, you know, it ruined my day at the very least.
00:35:12.634 - 00:35:52.074, Speaker D: Luckily, we haven't had a day that bad. And I think, like, I think, like, setting up your bets to where if you're willing to risk 2% and it actually hits that spot, just cutting out and giving up and reevaluating, being able to, like, share it publicly so that, like, people keep you accountable, too, to your stops. You don't, like, let things run too big is important. But, I mean, I think a lot of the time it's great because, like, it's. It's, for me at least, it's easier to take on bets that are kind of inevitable. So even if it goes 510 percent against me, like, I feel pretty confident in just adding more because I know it's kind of, like, it has to go. It just.
00:35:52.074 - 00:35:55.306, Speaker D: It just has to, like, converge to, like, this truth.
00:35:55.410 - 00:36:07.400, Speaker A: You had a tweet the other day about, you know, Martin Gayling shorts, and the third time was, was that just a troll. Do you ever Martin Gale? Like, are you prone to Martin Gayling or what was going on?
00:36:07.512 - 00:37:11.644, Speaker D: This is kind of alpha for sure, but shorting alts is one of the most inevitable things in crypto. I think there's just no way you could sustain certain valuations in this market environment while there are no new net inflows. So making that bet is a very obvious bet to make. The tough part is everyone else wants to make this bet as well. And these things as consumed by the past three weeks, these things can go really against you if people decide to push, because it's always easier to buy than sell, especially for these things with not good borrow, and it's just supply is constrained. So I think that the real alpha in shorting alts is sizing small enough to where if you get the timing wrong and it goes against you, you just keep adding as it goes up, it's almost inevitable that it goes down. And the greatest sin is just like blowing your load too early and just adding way too early, and then having it pump another 10% and then you get stopped out and then it goes back down because it has to go back down.
00:37:11.644 - 00:37:30.808, Speaker D: The same thing with those scam coin pumps with ygg and stuff. Like the worst thing you can do is just size too early and then cut out at the top and then just miss the ride back down. So there is an element of Martingale in there. It's like, I'm going to put this much in, and every time it goes up, I'm going to keep adding, keep adding, keep adding. So I know eventually it's going to go back down into my favor.
00:37:30.936 - 00:38:06.318, Speaker A: Well, you know, I've seen a few gamblers in my time, Martingale themselves to the buffet line at the Caesars. So doesn't happen. I have to say, like, usually I've had success shorting alts the same way, but there's been a few times, like the BCH pump this summer where it literally just kept ripping and ripping and had. It hasn't really retraced. You know, it's still at $50. Well, it retraced a little bit at some point from 300 to 200. But, you know, it's surprisingly, sometimes you don't know who's out there buying these things.
00:38:06.318 - 00:38:30.172, Speaker A: Justin's favorite guy, Charles Hodgkinson, you know, might have been pumping some Ethereum classic at some point. I think during the bull run, it was one of the. One of the most insane spikes we had. When I remember it went from 40 to 70 and I started shorting, and next time I looked, it was a $210. There's some guys with firepower when you don't expect it.
00:38:30.308 - 00:39:06.612, Speaker B: Yeah. And sometimes if a coin gets listed on the korean exchange, up it, we see, like, 2030, 40% pumps, and that can really catch people off size. I remember in 2022, I was short evacs, and then it got listed at up it immediately after, and I was like, oh, God, fuck me. And I had to cut, and then, of course, it ended up going down only after that. But, yeah, it's definitely dangerous to short, right? And I guess, do you ever do, like, martingale on, like, so let's say you're short, right? Like, do you ever Martingale on the way down, where you have a short thesis, it's going down, and you're like, you know what? Like, I have more conviction. Time to double down, triple down. So, like, have you ever done something like that?
00:39:06.708 - 00:39:34.612, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll do that. I'm better at adding on the way up than on the way down, which might be a bad thing. But, I mean, I think it really depends the market environment you're in. Like, obviously, like, 2021. Like, you saw doge go, like, 40, 50 billion, whereas, like, nowadays, like, you see, like, something like link, you're like, there's just no way it's going 40 billion. So if you like structure. So that, like, your final bullet, which is, like, the most important bullet, your final bullet is, like, where all the ev is.
00:39:34.612 - 00:39:49.290, Speaker D: If you structure it to a spot where it's like, you know, it's just. There's just no way it could ever reach there. Unless, like, like, bitcoin hit 60K again, then, like, yeah, it's always. The tough part is just trying to estimate how much. Are there more fools than money, or there are more money than fools.
00:39:49.322 - 00:40:27.322, Speaker C: Right now, I want to ask a question about. We've seen a lot of, like, memes about Mev being pennies in front of a steamroller, picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. Like, it's not worth it. And I want to ask you, like, similar in trading in crypto. So, like, over the past couple of years, there's been, let's say, five or so events that were so obvious and, like, the possible potential bullish outcome was so obvious that it was worth going all in, like, or almost all into your point? Um, and these are few and far between, but when they exist, there's a ton of money to be made. So, like, a few examples when UsT was collapsing, you know, like, once it. It was like, below ninety seven cents.
00:40:27.322 - 00:41:07.254, Speaker C: And it was, like, pretty clear this thing was going to zero jump, was trying to market make it. They were dumping all their BTC. Like, you could have been out of the market entirely and then just shorted Ust either on Aave if you were earlier or in, like, other markets. And, like, you have very little downside to your point because it just goes, you know, the most you could go up to is a dollar. Then there's other spots where, like, FTT was getting defended, but we sort of all knew that FTX was underwater and insulfant and this thing was going down. And then most recently, for me, Cbeth was trading at about a 12% discount at most relative to ETH during, like, the peak of the bear market. And for me, that was the spot where I basically, like, went all in and levered up on CBE.
00:41:07.254 - 00:41:24.034, Speaker C: I'm curious, like, what your thoughts are on if people, or if you are just looking for these, like, one in a year, once every six months events and piling into that. Or is there actually, like, value, more value in, like, following these smaller things that, like, we've been talking about over the past couple of weeks.
00:41:24.194 - 00:41:40.064, Speaker D: I think it's definitely, like a style. I think plenty of people do very well on those. Like, bigger. Like, another big one was, like, the USDC TPeg. When it hit, like, $0.84. That was actually something that, like, we completely missed out on. I don't know, I feel like it's less obvious in the moment.
00:41:40.064 - 00:42:08.960, Speaker D: I think it's very obvious in hindsight. Like, in the moment, you're kind of just like, oh, wow, like, what if. You know, what if circle actually does go insolvent and, like, I'll get my money back, but in, like, six months, twelve months, 18 months or something, is it worth making 10%, 15% on it? Like, that was going through my head when that happened. It was. Made me completely miss out on that trade. But, like, yeah, I would say, like, a lot of these events are less obvious in the moment than, like, in hindsight, because sometimes there's. They just seem like they're too good to be true, or it's like, missing something.
00:42:08.960 - 00:42:11.360, Speaker D: You know, it's just, like, hard to. Hard to tell.
00:42:11.472 - 00:42:45.364, Speaker A: Yeah, there's. There's definitely a lot of hindsight bias and a lot of larping on. On crypto Twitter by people who got some trade right and. And talk about. And then the ones they don't get right, you know, they never come up. But for you, like, what motivates you? Are you kind of trying to win points and it's a game and you find yourself treating it as a challenge, or are you trying to make money? Are you dollar denominated? Are you trying to build a stack of bitcoin ETH or what's your motivation in general?
00:42:45.484 - 00:43:20.210, Speaker D: Yeah, I think you guessed it. I mean, I played so many video games as a kid, that was pretty much like my only purpose in life. And it feels very similar to this. And I'm very grateful that I can sort of play this video game and I guess earn a living in that way. But I think for the most part, I'm dollar denominated for now, but I want to be bitcoin denominated when things look clearer to me. I have a small stack, maybe two to 5% of my portfolio, but I want to increase that 50 to 100 when the time's right. I just don't think the time's right right now.
00:43:20.322 - 00:43:27.938, Speaker A: So bitcoin is your coin of choice. We have an ETH Maxi Justin here. So he's looking at you with angry eyes.
00:43:28.106 - 00:43:34.174, Speaker D: I like both. I like both. I think they both serve a different purpose. I'm pretty sure we talked about this on end.
00:43:34.474 - 00:43:36.898, Speaker A: Diplomatic, diplomatic answer.
00:43:37.066 - 00:43:39.994, Speaker D: You're a bitcoin max, right, in terms of store value?
00:43:40.154 - 00:44:24.906, Speaker A: Yeah. I think for a monetary instrument, only bitcoin has the right characteristics. I'm still, like, very fascinated by Ethereum's potential community money that we've talked about in the past. And it's such a new type of way to store value within a community that can potentially grow and then use that money for utility. We've never really seen it before. So I'm fascinated by both experiments. I think with bitcoin, I'm a little bit disappointed with the level of discourse within that community and the lack of, you know, acceptance of certain basic truths that are, that are out there.
00:44:24.906 - 00:45:04.714, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of libertarians, when I find this in general with libertarians, that they don't necessarily have a realistic view of things, it's more philosophical. Like, they'll say, you know, I should be allowed to do whatever I want. If people want to, if I want to take drugs and harm myself, I should be allowed to do it. They forget that, you know, there's a society and things, if you take them to the extreme, those rules break. They're not, they're not consistent. You can't actually have a society function. And with bitcoin, a lot of the thinking around the end game I find very lacking in sophistication.
00:45:04.714 - 00:45:37.430, Speaker A: The people who think that all of the world's monetary coins will be replaced by bitcoin and all the countries will just use bitcoin. This, this like super maxi stuff I think is missing so many levels of realism that my, my vision is quite different. Until I see that the discourse is more around a vision of, you know, an alternative to currencies, not as like a takeover, then I'm still a little bit hesitant to denominate.
00:45:37.542 - 00:45:38.830, Speaker D: Totally. That makes sense.
00:45:38.982 - 00:45:50.326, Speaker A: I hope everybody enjoyed meeting thicky. Meeting Alad. We're going to close up with our usual pasta of the week and we do have some amazing ones. Who wants to go first?
00:45:50.470 - 00:46:28.532, Speaker C: I'll go first. I've pulled up here so Nick Carter been, I think I've been sharing a lot of his tweet, tweets recently, but he's been going after Michael Lewis a lot for this book on SPF and saying that Michael Lewis has probably been paid off. So the tweet is got to respect Michael Lewis for honoring his original covenant with Sam. To write a shill piece, gambling that the big man will get out and take care of him. That's the street loyalty you can't buy. I thought this was hilarious. I'm not necessarily making a comment on Michael Lewis being bought and paid for, but it definitely hits, hits home this one.
00:46:28.628 - 00:46:53.060, Speaker A: Well, we know that he's paid off a bunch of journalists. We know that he has given ball players. What was he giving Tom Brady like 55 million for 20 hours of work? Something insane. So it would not surprise me if a little bit of cheddar got Michael Lewis way. But maybe he's just having bad judgment. I wouldn't be surprised with either of those two things. But Taiki, what do you have for us?
00:46:53.172 - 00:47:21.854, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is gonna be an excerpt from the Michael Lewis book and it's talking about, I guess, the sexual relationships Sam and Caroline had. Caroline wanted a conventional love with an unconventional man. Sam wanted to do whatever at any given moment offered the highest expected value. And this estimate of her expected value seemed to peak right before they had sex and plummet immediately after. So you know, SPF sold the news or he sold the news. Here he had it.
00:47:21.854 - 00:47:34.842, Speaker B: He proposed full of sell the news events. And I think, you know, Sam sold the news on Caroline's or the sex joint of course they had with Caroline. So I thought that was a pretty interesting and funny excerpt from the book.
00:47:34.938 - 00:47:41.614, Speaker C: I mean, we'll see what you guys have but I think you're just the way you explain that story makes you the best pasta of the week. But we'll see.
00:47:42.954 - 00:47:55.242, Speaker A: Very solid. And, you know, Carolyn has shown through her blog post in the past that she can be very direct and testosterone heavy in her communication. So, Vicki, how about you?
00:47:55.378 - 00:48:13.014, Speaker D: Well, go on this. It's so weird that, like, all of their personal, like, correspondences are just getting publicized. And I don't think it's serving any purpose for, like, you know, finding out what happened. It's just like pure. Just gossip and drama. It's just interesting.
00:48:13.814 - 00:48:25.598, Speaker C: SPF is the one providing this information. That's the crazy part. He gave the New York Times, like, Caroline's personal diary, and then he also worked with Michael Lewis and helped him get this information. Right. It's crazy.
00:48:25.686 - 00:48:30.494, Speaker D: So this is a discredit Caroline. Right. They try to paint her as, like, a disgruntled lover. Is that what the idea is?
00:48:30.574 - 00:48:32.182, Speaker C: I think that's the strategy, yeah.
00:48:32.278 - 00:48:32.670, Speaker A: Okay.
00:48:32.702 - 00:48:54.854, Speaker D: It's interesting, man, this guy has no shame. But, yeah, my past is unrelated to the trial. I just thought it was kind of. Kind of hilarious. Definitely less on adverse selection. You know, you find a guy who's able to, who's willing to do so much for you. Good chance he's crazy.
00:48:56.594 - 00:49:12.968, Speaker A: You know, I love it that she, the day before, tried to throw it in guys faces. If you wanted to, he would. You know, normal guys will do anything. They'll fly around. And then she just has to admit that the one guy who did this.
00:49:13.016 - 00:49:14.928, Speaker B: Stuff, this is the full case for fintech.
00:49:14.976 - 00:49:18.296, Speaker D: Right? How come?
00:49:18.440 - 00:49:34.192, Speaker B: Well, it's like the simp economy people would like. Some people are willing to do a lot to gain access and, you know, whether it be chat groups or meeting people in real life. And I think this is like what Cl talked about. It's like long mental illness or something along those lines.
00:49:34.288 - 00:49:35.912, Speaker D: Are you on friendtech yet, Jordy?
00:49:36.008 - 00:50:00.532, Speaker A: You know, I feel a little bit wrecked in not having joined, having seen the recent Sim swaps that have been happening in people's wallets getting drained. These security issues have to get fixed. I actually do have a call with the team tomorrow. Not the frontech team, because actually mantle has its own version called fantech.
00:50:00.688 - 00:50:01.544, Speaker D: No way.
00:50:02.564 - 00:50:38.114, Speaker A: Yeah, it's actually better ux. So something I'm evaluating, potentially doing. The one cool thing that they have is there's an auction when somebody joins. So it's not a bunch of mev bots that get to just extract all the value from somebody joining, which I hate. There's a very nice auction where ten people can get a key at the same price. So evaluating it. But security is concerned and talking to privy tomorrow to understand what type of two fa or other solutions might be possible to make these wallets to get created on the app actually secure.
00:50:38.114 - 00:51:12.404, Speaker A: So I'll have an update, hopefully there. But I think the fintech experiment is interesting and it's still got some legs. But yeah, safety first. Cool. So my pasta of the week going along the Taiki lines, also from from this book, there's some amazing quotes in there, and mine is this SPF quote. He says, in a lot of ways, I don't really have a soul. And at some point he goes on to say that there's a pretty decent argument that my empathy is fake, my feelings are fake, my facial reactions are fake, I don't feel happiness.
00:51:12.404 - 00:51:39.324, Speaker A: This is pretty intense. I think if we had seen some of these compelling lists of SPF for what? He shouldn't date Carolyn. We would also not want to date him in terms of our exchange. And I wish these were made public a little bit sooner. They would have given us pause. Still, epic tweets and potentially these pastas make their way into the, into the future. Crypto Twitter pastas.
00:51:39.324 - 00:51:46.264, Speaker A: I don't know who had the best pasta this week. I think it's actually very close. We don't have a clear winner.
00:51:46.384 - 00:51:53.464, Speaker C: I think Taiki's delivery is just unmatched. I don't think anyone else brought that energy for me. My vote's Taiki. What do you guys think?
00:51:53.544 - 00:52:17.354, Speaker A: Taiki has been crushing it lately. He got a last week with Grad Chev, which is extremely difficult to match up to as a dj and pasta of the week. So congratulations to Chef Taiki. Hopefully we'll get some more strong deliveries in next week's episode as well and see you guys then.
