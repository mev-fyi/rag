00:00:00.200 - 00:00:09.086, Speaker B: This tweet gave me a little bit of hope. You're not ugly. You're just poor. Is there hope out there for the nerds that are still grinding, still trying to make it?
00:00:09.118 - 00:00:11.414, Speaker A: So you want the backstory behind this picture? Yes.
00:00:11.502 - 00:00:11.862, Speaker B: Yes.
00:00:11.926 - 00:00:23.078, Speaker A: Yes, we do. That is Maria Jones. She used to work at Cointelegraph, so she actually bought a ticket just to get access to the terminal and just to come and see me and interview me. And we took a picture together, so.
00:00:23.094 - 00:00:26.382, Speaker B: There is hope. This was going to be my backup pasta. I feel inclined.
00:00:26.406 - 00:00:27.290, Speaker A: To show it.
00:00:28.350 - 00:00:30.502, Speaker B: When you tweeted this one out, this was iconic.
00:00:30.566 - 00:00:58.450, Speaker A: We had been working on a browser wallet, and metamask got delisted from Chrome, and I was hoping to just get a number and have a phone call. Is Google going to be delisting these applications instead? They're like, oh, we'll just use the support email. We'll get back to you, and it's like, I have an urgent question, you guys, I am not in the mood for this shit. I didn't expect this to become, like, a humongous thing. People actually started putting on t shirts, and they just got this idea that my characters, I'm this pompous asshole going around, like, dropping this name and everything.
