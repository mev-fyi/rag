00:00:20.320 - 00:00:45.250, Speaker A: Welcome to another episode of Steady Lads. We have a great one for you today. So joining me is Thicki, junior analyst at Scimitar Capital. Some people have promoted you think he will have to correct woo blockchain shortly. We have Taiki, the humble farmer and lover of RWAs, recently seems, and Justin Bram, who is the CEO of Astaria, and I would say the tryer of social fi apps.
00:00:45.322 - 00:00:46.370, Speaker B: I try everything.
00:00:46.522 - 00:01:10.140, Speaker A: So I wanted to kick off with Alameda. I think it's hard not to give him the trial that's going on right now. We've seen Carolyn. She's been probably the star witness, unless we get a, you know, Trabuco showing that might take the spotlight away, but as of this recording right now, we haven't seen any evidence of that yet. Justin, have you been following this closely?
00:01:10.252 - 00:01:46.536, Speaker B: I have, yeah. So I finished the Michael Lewis book. We can talk a little bit about that. And I've also been following along a little bit with this account here, inner city press, which live tweets things from the trial, basically like a abbreviated or abridged transcript, you could say, of everything happening. And some of the information that's coming from these witnesses is shocking, and I do tend to believe them. One, they're under oath, and two, their deals with the government will basically be ripped apart, and they'll go through the whole legal process without any sort of support from the government for pleading guilty if they lie. So I do tend to believe them.
00:01:46.536 - 00:02:36.338, Speaker B: And. And, uh, I think one of the most shocking revelations for me, I mean, there's a ton in there, but, um, Caroline basically has this quote where she says that Sam was obsessed with this. I think it comes from poker, actually. This concept of expected value, basically, that you always want to be modeling out, you know, where you'll get the best return from at any cost. Um, now, typically, in the investing world, that sort of makes sense, but it seems like Sam SPF took it sort of to, like, this extreme that I would almost call, like, a mental dysfunction. So he is quoted saying he would flip a coin, and if there's a 51% chance it lands on heads and a 49% chance it lands on tails. If in heads, the productivity of the world doubled entails the world was destroyed, he would flip that coin every time.
00:02:36.338 - 00:02:38.298, Speaker B: And so this is like your.
00:02:38.386 - 00:02:57.884, Speaker A: Let me actually correct you. It's not even exactly correct. So he thinks that even if it was 50 50, he would still flip it. The thinking being that if you keep flipping these coins as like a reverse martingale, you can potentially get, like, an exponentially high outcome. Well, the downside is limited. The downside is just zero. Like, the world goes to zero.
00:02:57.884 - 00:03:07.238, Speaker A: But the upside is, like, unlimited, is, like, infinite if you keep doubling down. So even if it's 50 50, he is saying that he would keep flipping.
00:03:07.356 - 00:03:18.454, Speaker B: And just for the audience, martingale is a strategy, I think, in roulette, where, like, if you always double your bet size on, say, red or black, and you can always double, even if you lose, like, eventually you'll come out on top. Is that right?
00:03:18.754 - 00:03:20.306, Speaker C: You double only when you lose.
00:03:20.410 - 00:03:32.774, Speaker A: Justin, I think our djen audience is very familiar with Martingale. I think thick. He's been doing a lot of martingale on losses. They must have been experienced with that, with trading.
00:03:33.294 - 00:03:41.046, Speaker B: Well, it took a second to click with me. So I don't know. I'm just trying to. Trying to be on the side of the audience, the voice for the people.
00:03:41.190 - 00:03:49.594, Speaker D: Whenever I go to Vegas, I would always martingale with my friends, like, on roulette, with, like, a max loss of, like, a few thousand dollars. If I win the first time, that's like, okay, like, we're out.
00:03:50.534 - 00:04:24.780, Speaker A: If you can imagine, a reverse martingale basically means there's a little chance you get out of the casino with your money. But that one time that you do, you know, you own the casino. That's sort of what SPF is going for here. And we saw this tweets during the bull market. You know, when people had their testosterone high because their little altcoins were still up in the sky, they were talking about linear wealth versus log wealth. And, you know, a bunch of the. At the time, billionaires were one upping each other about how linear their wealth preferences instead of logarithmic.
00:04:24.780 - 00:04:30.784, Speaker A: And we can talk about this. Can you explain, thicke, this utility function of what log versus linear means?
00:04:30.944 - 00:05:00.444, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, I think, like, the typical way of how people think about wealth is that, like, every additional dollar you get means less. So, like, going from $0 to 100k, let's say, is, like, very meaningful. But maybe going from one hundred k to a million is less meaningful, a million to 10 million, even less meaningful. And at a certain point, like, the marginal dollar is just worth less. So there's, like, a log scale to it. But I guess the more linear wealth you are, like, the less, you know, a dollar is a dollar no matter how much you have.
00:05:00.444 - 00:05:05.292, Speaker C: So that's kind of the mindset that's adopted in the bull market. This sort of philosophy is quite interesting.
00:05:05.428 - 00:05:15.476, Speaker A: So during the bull market, a lot of people that were trying to push this narrative of being chads were saying that, you know, we don't care about log linear. You know, we just.
00:05:15.540 - 00:05:16.084, Speaker D: We're just.
00:05:16.164 - 00:05:44.416, Speaker A: They're like the reverse of taiki as personalities. You know, full on going wild. It's a good thing, honestly. So I have a high tolerance for, like, shady people, you know, gamblers. I've been around all these kind of people. I have a certain amount of respect for, you know, someone that's just trying to make it and hustling. The people that I can't stand are the people that have made, like, they're billionaires and they're just totally fraudulent at that level.
00:05:44.416 - 00:06:00.290, Speaker A: And I'm talking about the machinsky's and the spfs and these guys that they've made it. You know, they can. They can take a chill pill. They don't need to, like, push the boundaries of what's legal and screw everybody else. Those are the people I just can't forgive. Like, I don't know, it just irks me to no end.
00:06:00.362 - 00:06:21.098, Speaker B: Well, that's sort of the point. I was talking about this sort of, like, uh. It really does feel like SPF had, like, some sort of. I don't know what personality disorder it would be, but, like, to take these things to the extreme when, like, to your point, he had an amazing. Actually not an amazing business. We can get into that later. But he had a business that he would never have to worry about money again, let's just say.
00:06:21.098 - 00:06:55.662, Speaker B: Right? And he had to. He felt the need to take this to the extreme, to accumulate as much money as humanly possible, even though he knew that the risk would be complete ruin. And he made this ev calculation in his head that maybe on paper you can make the case for. But just any rational human would come in and look at this and say, this is not the right thing to do. I shouldn't take this risk on. Because ultimately, he was just betting that his bets would win and he would be able to come out of this alive, right? Like, he just took customer money thinking that he. There's a more than 50% chance he would win.
00:06:55.662 - 00:06:58.174, Speaker B: And it just doesn't make sense to me.
00:06:58.254 - 00:07:24.000, Speaker A: I mean, I think the mental disease or whatever situation is probably related to those, like, drugs that he would, you know, pump himself full of patches and stuff to get going. And, you know, you add that to a very healthy dose of autism, which is not rare in space, but he definitely, you know, had his share of it. I don't know, if you see the story where he's on a call with, you know, some, some VC's or something, is it, was it, uh, which large VC was it that he was on? Sequoia.
00:07:24.112 - 00:07:24.584, Speaker D: Sequoia.
00:07:24.624 - 00:07:35.040, Speaker A: Sequoia. Yeah. You know, supposed to be one of the most sophisticated in the space, and they all just fall in love with him in the chat. Ten out of ten. I want to. Let's go with this guy. Yes.
00:07:35.040 - 00:08:03.514, Speaker A: Like, his vision. And then meanwhile, they're saying he was, like, playing League of Legends on the side. And that sounds like he's incredible genius. He's able to multitask and at the same time convince. The most difficult vc to convince. But then we know that he's a complete bronze c minus player at League of Legends. So he's a very super smart, but also super stupid at the same time.
00:08:03.514 - 00:08:07.504, Speaker A: Intelligence, it's a very strange one. Strange combination.
00:08:07.844 - 00:08:38.428, Speaker B: Yeah. I think in sentencing, like, the thing that from, you know, like I said, I've read the Michael Lewis book. I've been following the trial pretty closely. I think what the judge is really going to hammer him on when he. So, like, at the end of a trial, right, when it's time for sentencing, the judge almost always gives, like, a speech, right, of like, five minutes saying, you know, here are the reasons why I'm going to give you many years. Here are the reasons why I'm going to give you a few years. And my interpretation, and also seeing how the judge has been reacting, is that the judge is going to say, you're a very smart person.
00:08:38.428 - 00:09:02.772, Speaker B: Like, you could have done so much good for the world like this. This makes this even more tragic. There's so many people that don't have the opportunity to go to the best schools in the world like you do, to be educated by great parents on a university campus. And you took that and you sort of twisted it, and it became this, like, terrible manifestation where you hurt a lot of people. And I think that's what's going to be used against him during sentencing if he's found guilty.
00:09:02.868 - 00:09:20.504, Speaker A: Have any of you, like, interacted with EA people? Effective altruism people? You know, there's some prominent ones in crypto, but I've lived in the bay, I think. Taiki, you lived in the bay as well. But maybe you weren't going to as many shady parties in Berkeley as I was at the time.
00:09:22.964 - 00:09:29.966, Speaker D: Unfortunately not. Or fortunately, um, I know, um, who's the guy that runs dragonfly? Haseeb.
00:09:30.030 - 00:09:30.350, Speaker A: Haseeb.
00:09:30.382 - 00:09:55.792, Speaker D: Also, like, an effective altruist right? Um, yeah, definitely. Like, SVF gave eA, like, a really bad rap. I'm not even sure if he actually believed in it. Maybe, you know, if he kept talking about, like, the queen flip situation, you know, he just took it to an extreme. Like, what do you guys think about, like, ea? Like, do you think it's. It makes sense, or is it more like an excuse, like, just try to, like, extract value?
00:09:55.928 - 00:10:14.136, Speaker A: No, it makes sense. I mean, I've been around this world. You know, some of my best friends were. Are maybe still in that community. It's a very small community. I literally didn't realize, but a lot of them were, like, working at Alameda. Apparently, it's such a small circle that, you know, they were just hiring from within it.
00:10:14.136 - 00:10:59.336, Speaker A: So just knowing people within it, you probably know people that were behind the scenes working there, at least during, like, the early years, 1819, those type of years before, like, there was a split and a bunch of people left. But no, it's a legitimate thing. I would say it appeals to a certain intellect that super logical, you know, the Jane street type. They're able to, like, you know, think very cleanly, and. And that's great, but there's certain assumptions they make about the world in order to be able to simplify it into their equations. And those assumptions are usually not exactly fair to make. Like, let's say they're obsessed with what's the cheapest amount of money to save a life, and it's like mosquito nets in Africa.
00:10:59.336 - 00:11:25.434, Speaker A: Okay, like, we should. We should just do this. And the simplification is all lives are worth the same, and we should just try to maximize, like, lives as a concept. And this assumption is quite incorrect in my view. Like, if you actually do, like, trolley problems and you go into deeper philosophical things, you know, it's not just the pure number of lives. Like, you know, the circumstances, the ages. Like, so many things matter, in my opinion.
00:11:25.434 - 00:11:37.970, Speaker A: Like, you know, the consciousness level of somebody also matters. Like, if someone's, like, an NPC character, you know, maybe it's, like, not as valuable as someone, like Socrates.
00:11:38.122 - 00:12:13.038, Speaker B: Yeah, I tend to agree with you. I think so. You know, I don't know any eas, but, like, from my understanding of it, I don't hold. Like, I don't see it as a necessarily bad belief system, but I think the concept of effective altruism really removes the human element, to your point. And I think by removing the human element of sort of just trying to maximize good as opposed to targeting good, where you see, where you think there's the most need. It leads to this sort of like, dehumanization that I think happened with SPF. So I don't necessarily think he was trying to steal this money for personal gain.
00:12:13.038 - 00:12:53.178, Speaker B: And, like, we actually saw that because he was donating to politicians. And of course that gave him some influence. But if he spent 100 million on politicians, clearly he could get more positive benefit by just spending 100 million on himself. And he didn't do that. But I think this effective altruism shield allowed him to dehumanize his customers and realize that taking money from customers would lead to a greater good because he could spend it in a better way than his customers would, and he could also possibly make a positive return. So I think, you know, there's ways to take everything to the extreme. And if you have this effective altruist shield, it allows you to do things like stealing from one person to spend it on someone in need.
00:12:53.178 - 00:12:59.590, Speaker B: Right? Like the question of if Robin Hood is good for the world, the idea of taking from the rich to give to the poor.
00:12:59.742 - 00:13:26.668, Speaker A: I agree. I mean, I think the morality can get skewed. There's always benefits to this type of thinking because sometimes when it does align and it fits in, it makes sense. And we saw that with the anthropic investment. I think having known the history of eas and being very close to that community, I know that was it. Around 2017, quite a few years ago, they were doing all these programs and all these different things. They were running, uh, camps and SF.
00:13:26.668 - 00:14:00.132, Speaker A: And at some point they just said, we're shutting everything down. We're only going to focus on AI risk. And we think, like, this is like, the one thing that humanity, like, can maximize. You know, like, the ev of our time is best spent on. On AI risk. And a lot of them have done great job in that space. And even this, like, you know, what looked like very stupid investment in an anthropic, you know, no name startup has obviously paid off very well and can potentially make investors whole, but kudos for at least.
00:14:00.132 - 00:14:22.592, Speaker A: Let's talk about some of the good things about that culture. But let's go back to the bad stuff. So can you bring up this chart? We have this chart of they're putting together what they think is, like the real p and l of Alameda. Okay, so you're the trader here. Maybe you can kind of line up with Luna and some of the other things, and we can try to figure out what was going on here. I don't know if we can zoom in some of the dates.
00:14:22.648 - 00:14:44.792, Speaker C: And so it looks like from, there was like a pretty monstrous lunar run from, you know, January to April 2022. And there's also, like, a pretty decent soul rally from, like, I think, like $80 to 140 in March and April. So that ties out with, like, those spikes. They actually got back to even, it looks like at the peak of, as.
00:14:44.808 - 00:14:54.250, Speaker A: A trader, when you see that, you know, oh, we were down seven, seven, 8 billion, but we got back to even. Next time, you're willing to risk even more, right? Because you're like, well, we can make it back.
00:14:54.442 - 00:15:02.658, Speaker C: Exactly. And then you see that spike from 4 billion to 12 billion, negative coinciding with the Luna implosion.
00:15:02.786 - 00:15:14.134, Speaker A: Do you think this was like absorbing liquidations on FTX and that they just kept bidding on FTX? Or maybe it's just they had too much luna, or what do you think it is?
00:15:14.314 - 00:15:20.694, Speaker C: I'm not sure. I think it could be a combination of the both. That does seem to be, like the prevailing consensus thought.
00:15:20.854 - 00:15:31.038, Speaker B: Just a question for you guys. So these aren't like, this is the real p and l, but this includes tokens that are too illiquid to actually sell at the market price, right?
00:15:31.206 - 00:15:45.098, Speaker C: Yes. Yeah, exactly. If you look at the source that goes like database tables, binary option fills, referral rebates, fee voucher deductions, a lot of interesting things that they're airdrops, but.
00:15:45.146 - 00:16:03.174, Speaker A: The final number doesn't line up. So I would guess that this is quite an accurate net representation of what was going on. And it's interesting, after the Luna implosion, they made back like 4 billion. And this is around the time that three arrows was saying that they were getting counter traded and somebody was trying to liquidate them.
00:16:03.874 - 00:16:04.934, Speaker B: No, that's true.
00:16:06.294 - 00:16:17.486, Speaker A: I don't know if that's when they were making some of it back. In that level of desperation, I imagine they were willing to just throw out the book, just go full on ham.
00:16:17.630 - 00:16:22.590, Speaker D: What happened? At the very end in November, there was a spike from minus ten to six.
00:16:22.782 - 00:16:37.956, Speaker C: Soul spiked into breakpoint. And that weekend, Seoul, actually 20 something to 37. It was very good for them until it died. That's a good theory, though, that, like, maybe they decided to hunt their ac because they were so in the red.
00:16:38.100 - 00:17:06.652, Speaker A: You know, sue did say he was one of the first people to say that he thinks Alameda was absorbing liquidations during Luna, and at least these numbers would line up with, with some of his speculation about, about them. Plus the. I think I was the first one to speculate that publicly that they had a non liquidation account that could probably go very negative, and that also turned out to be correct. So some of the guesses are being validated by the data we're seeing.
00:17:06.748 - 00:17:10.684, Speaker B: When you say absorbing losses, do you mind just explaining what you mean by that?
00:17:10.804 - 00:18:08.024, Speaker A: If people have a two x, three x Luna position, and Luna is going down as it was crashing really hard, somebody needs to liquidate that. So you can either just sell it into the book on behalf of the user, but what these exchanges do, like, most of the large ones, actually, they'll have separate feed that the liquidations go into, and instead of throwing them into the book, they can just put them on their own sub account. They can just have a sub account that just gets all the liquidations. And Alameda was quite public saying for years that these are some of the times they make the most money, because they're willing to be on the other side of liquidations, because it's usually forced selling, and it'll bounce back up. You'll have this spike down 20%, and then it'll go back up 10%, so it'll make that spread. But in Luna's case, it just kept going down and down and down and down, and they're absorbing these things. And I think sue might have kind of hit the nail on the head as to some of these losses.
00:18:08.024 - 00:18:42.628, Speaker A: Obviously, they actually did have VC investments in Luna as well, and potentially had ust. So it could be a combination of things. Cool. So let's go on to, like, a different topic while you, you know, this trial plays out. I'm sure we'll have some more to talk about next week, I think, you know, the other thing that happened was stars arena getting kind of hacked, and then the next day, like, actually hacked. And then we're seeing a few more things with Avax recently with Platypus. So, you know, this was something that I felt quite shocked by.
00:18:42.628 - 00:19:05.338, Speaker A: Not the actual initial hacking, because, okay, you know, EVM contracts, like, you know, shit happens, but the reaction initially of saying that this was all fud, and then when it actually happened. So you see, like, this tweet here by Emin, who had decided to align himself fully with this app, this protocol. What did you think when you guys saw this?
00:19:05.426 - 00:19:51.418, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely tone deaf, right? And I feel like Ava labs and avalanche and all these alt o one foundations, they all suffer from lack of relevance, and whenever something catches on, they kind of have to pile in, just try to make themselves relevant. And I think the entire Eva labs team was like, you know what? Like, this is our chance, right? Like, frantic is doing well on base. Stars arena just launched. Let's just, you know, pile money into this. We'll promise some Avax incentives down the line. And then, like, when the hacks happen, when the hack happens, they're like, oh, well, like, oh, fuck, like, what do we do now? Like, we already publicly backed it, so they kind of have, like, they're kind of stuck, right? They're like, they're kind of like bag holding their public opinion around a particular platform. And it's kind of hard to go back.
00:19:51.418 - 00:20:02.434, Speaker D: And I think Emin maybe was acting out of emotional, like an emotional response of, you know, what, like, you know, $3 million, like, that's no big deal. Like, stars arena can make it back in, you know, like two weeks or whatever.
00:20:02.554 - 00:20:37.936, Speaker A: He did have an emotional reaction because he was saying, like, this is a war against us. You know, we're being fighted. This is like a tribal thing. He used the word tribal so he's viewing it, you know, back into the, you know, I remember the, I've abandoned ethereum and then, you know, people hacking sue for going with Avax and going back to those days. But I don't think that this is what's happening. And the comment about 3 million not being a lot was just so shocking to me as a lack of, like, awareness as to, you know, like, what matters in this space. And like you said, take, I completely agree with you.
00:20:37.936 - 00:21:09.794, Speaker A: Like, these chains are trying to grab a narrative. It's hard to get attention. Hasn't been going that well. You know, it's been a, it's been a rough bear market, and any glimmer of hope, they'll jump on. But, you know, now that I'm in, you know, I'm in the arena as well. I have the same role with mantle where we have these apps come in and I have to decide, like, are we, you know, are we going to just start pumping them to everybody and officially supporting them? Like, we have fantech, which is like stars arena. It's like a frantech fork mantle.
00:21:09.794 - 00:21:51.406, Speaker A: And I've been in the exact position that admin has where, you know, I get, like, squeezed from different sides. Like, why, you know, why don't we just, like, publicly support? And I take the, you know, I have another stuffed animal, stuffed animal of the week. This is the sloth. You know, it's my spirit animal for the week. I've been taking the slow approach and, you know, I want to have teams KYC'd and I want to have smart contracts verified at the minimum and audited before just publicly telling hundreds of thousands of people to put money here. And I just found it so shocking that the approach here was, hey guys, it's all fud. And then the next day he's proven wrong.
00:21:51.406 - 00:22:00.154, Speaker A: It's not all fud. Like there's no security even. And then it's like, oh, it's just 3 million guys. Like, other people lost more.
00:22:00.494 - 00:22:25.484, Speaker B: Why does this happen to ecosystem leaders? Like across the board? I think every single ecosystem leader besides Vitalik, and this isn't even to toot Vitalik's horn, but like he just doesn't get involved in this stuff. But every single ecosystem leader sort of turns into this like crazed, biased promoter at all costs. Like, are we going to see that with you, Jordi, in a year when mantles like a top ecosystem coin?
00:22:26.224 - 00:22:43.500, Speaker A: No, man, I'm taking a very different approach here. This is the singaporean government approach. We're going to hell. Yeah, we're going to be safe. You know, ultimately, like you, you want to have in people's head. No, like hacks and no, like huge issues. People want to feel safe with money.
00:22:43.500 - 00:23:12.198, Speaker A: And, you know, this is a financial instrument and it's like, number one thing is security for me. So you can't control every single thing. You know, something might happen, especially with, with EVM, but you can control at least like the basics. And here it wasn't even like near the basics. So, um, I mean, in terms of other leaders, maybe we should bring up some of the other alt l one chains and, and see, you know, what's been going on. I think we haven't heard about them in so long. We used to look at these people every day during the bull market.
00:23:12.198 - 00:23:19.198, Speaker A: But now, you know, the Sylvios and the. I think Charles Hoskinson hasn't, you know, he's been, he has like a private.
00:23:19.246 - 00:23:22.070, Speaker D: Jet business, very profitable.
00:23:22.182 - 00:23:31.282, Speaker B: No, no, he's been, he helped recover like none elements. These not of from this universe at the bottom of the sea. Very interesting.
00:23:31.458 - 00:23:48.574, Speaker C: I do think that like crypto projects are more so, the successful ones more so rely on like cultism rather than actual technology. And I think that's the reason why you see all these fanatic leaders emerge to the top. Like do Kwon, that kind of, you know, personality type.
00:23:48.874 - 00:24:19.544, Speaker D: Yeah, people want someone to follow, right? It's like Danny, like frog nation, even SPF and even Emin. Maybe he feels like the need to just start bullposting, get engagement, because that's the only way to get people's attention. And there's no real way to, no efficient way to value these cryptocurrencies. So in order for your coin to get buyers, you just have to be on top of Twitter or whatever social media platform. And I think founders have to account for that.
00:24:20.104 - 00:24:46.444, Speaker A: No, I mean, that's the game. There's no exact way to value an alt one like a layer one coin. Maybe there are some gas fees, but usually those are very much distant into the future. So apart from ethereum, that is actually usually generating quite a lot of gas fees. The other ones are relying on the community aspect. We've talked about community money a little bit in the past. A lot of these things are trying to build this community.
00:24:46.444 - 00:25:23.554, Speaker A: And we're in the paleolithic, paleolithic times here with crypto. People don't realize that the most important thing for community money is the supply. And it's just completely underestimated how, like, constant supply and dumping from insiders will just rip apart the community because the community is together, because they're feeling the vibes. They want to get rich together. This is like our cavemen vibes. But if there's just like supply coming in, this is like the number one reason why all of these are failing and will keep failing, in my opinion. Maybe we can bring up the get the coingecko maybe to see where some of these coins have been trading.
00:25:23.554 - 00:26:09.554, Speaker A: So, okay, Polkadot, this was one that had a lot of hype, obviously, you know, one of the co founders of Ethereum and there's multiple chains where the, the co founder of one of the co founders of Ethereum, it looks pretty rough. This is, this is not even linear chart, so it's even worse than it looks. And this is a BTC chart, so it's already reflecting the beta of the market. Doesn't look like a happy community. And I think we have a tweet out by woo blockchain saying that a certain analyst was pointing out some layoffs that are happening here. So analyst Thickie revealed that parity Technologies, the Polkadot ecosystem development organization, laid off 300 people. So good scoop there.
00:26:11.254 - 00:26:13.590, Speaker B: Is that real? Is that a real scoop?
00:26:13.782 - 00:26:15.814, Speaker A: It's a real scoop. I don't know if it's your scoop.
00:26:15.894 - 00:26:55.660, Speaker C: But earlier this week already launched a thread that said that we don't want to be a bottleneck to the ecosystem. So we're going to pivot from go to market functions to developer. I don't know. This is very much crypto corporate speak and it's very much like no one has any idea what these people are saying? And they also announced like a foundation grant program for new developers. I believe it was like 20 million swiss francs and like 5 million dot. It was around like another $20 million. So I, quote, tweeted it and I was like, what's actually going on here? It reads very much like they're shutting down the entire service provider.
00:26:55.660 - 00:27:38.838, Speaker C: And for the readers that aren't aware, most of these crypto projects have like a foundation structure which is like the legal wrapper for the DAO. And then they have like the service provider who usually is like, you know, the people that wrote the source code and they maybe push updates and contribute to the project itself. So the service provider, I was like, is it just shutting down or something? And then someone, one of the employees, DM's me, and was like, hey, yeah, like, I just got laid off. 300 other employees got laid off. It's like 70, 80% of the entire workforce. Yeah, they were not very happy about what happened. And yeah, I was just kind of surprised that like, this is the way that I thought they were going to follow up with something.
00:27:38.838 - 00:27:40.794, Speaker C: But yeah, this is the way that they're going to announce it.
00:27:41.134 - 00:28:23.572, Speaker B: It's like a game of obfuscation, right? Like with, I mean, I keep going back to Cardano, but it's like, in crypto is the only industry where you can exit to the world without actually delivering on anything. Right? So, like, Cardano, like, goes public with the ad, with the Ada, Ada token, whatever it is. And there's literally no incentive for anyone to participate in continuing development. In fact, it's actually probably worse. Like when we saw Cardano in the bull market, launch smart contracts, which I think failed. I'm not exactly sure what happened with that. That was literally the top, right? So like, these, all of these events are sell the news because these ecosystems can't deliver any real value.
00:28:23.572 - 00:29:02.834, Speaker B: So if Polkadot actually started announcing that they were building things, people would see that that actually had no effect and they would all become sell the news. So it's much better, like from a Polkadot company standpoint, to not build, to slim the team down to as little as possible, but to have their, like, eccentric leader is that Gavin would in this case, like, continue to shill Polkadot, be a spokesman for it. And, and if he executes well on that Polkadot price action will be more positive than actually building. So to me, this is just like how our incentives are aligned in the ecosystem. And it is disappointing to see that everyone becomes billionaires without actually delivering anything.
00:29:03.534 - 00:29:58.504, Speaker A: So you have technology and there are some that have better technology than others, arguably, like Algorand, some people were saying that the tech is actually know, pretty good. Maybe like in terms of like the, you know, blockchain trilemma, there's some progress made on that front, but lacking in several other ways. Clearly and ultimately we see cosmos maybe still, you know, having a community. And DyDx is potentially going to bring something interesting there. We've had some, some good chains use that environment and I think that's one that has a, you know, potentially some, some chance. Avax, I think, you know, we've kind of seen some of the recent effects and don't want to comment further, but Solana is an interesting one and that's been debated a little bit back and forth. I think there was an interesting thread maybe we can bring up.
00:29:58.504 - 00:30:10.244, Speaker A: Maybe it's more than trading side, less philosophical, but it all ties in together. So this defi squared thread, he's been talking about this for a while. Have you been reading these sticky?
00:30:10.624 - 00:30:38.774, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I talked to defi squared a little bit, and he's not very bullish or not very bearish soul, but yeah, I mean, I mean, I took the short on too, but from a much lower price point, it seemed like very obvious that like, oh, there's a huge overhang going on, but like, there's, you know, it's very much like a fan favorite token and like, there was no supply coming in near term, so like, it definitely squeezed up very high, like $24.
00:30:39.914 - 00:31:03.534, Speaker B: Do you still feel comfortable, like, shorting this thing when it, this seems to me like the most crowded trade in all of crypto right now. And most discussed, like, everyone knows that with the bankruptcy, there's a ton of soul that has to get liquidated. Like, I'm obviously not a trader, I leave that to you guys. But, like, for me, I'd be terrified of being in on this because everyone in the world is thinking about this. Everyone in the crypto world, I should say.
00:31:03.914 - 00:31:33.476, Speaker A: So it depends how you execute, right? Like, if you, if you have spot, you can just sell spot. If you have some calendar future or some put option, then you don't have to worry about liquidations. And I think it's just the clearest trade. And I kind of agree with Defi Square. The amount of selling pressure into this type of liquidity and this type of market, people just hugely underestimate what it can potentially do. And we don't know the timing. So that's where it gets risky.
00:31:33.476 - 00:31:48.024, Speaker A: Like if you put on a perips position and the funding goes negative and you're just getting squeezed. That's what we saw. Or last month. But it's inevitable that we will see a lot lower price once Genesis galaxy, sorry. Starts selling.
00:31:48.364 - 00:32:00.566, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. I think it's inevitable that price will be much lower from here, just like, the short term. There's some positioning games going on and. Yeah, I mean, 24 was a good short. Like, it's. It's at, like, what, 21 right now.
00:32:00.710 - 00:32:29.318, Speaker B: Just to question you guys on that or play devil's advocate a bit. So it's. It looks like it's. It's about a billion dollars worth of soul. Uh, could someone like Anatoly to, you know, quote unquote save soul, like we saw with curve and Mitch, like, be interested? I mean, presumably he's a billionaire. He must have sold a ton of soul at the top. Like, could someone like him just come in and backstop Seoul and buy that? All of that OTC? I mean, what are your guys thoughts there?
00:32:29.446 - 00:32:37.302, Speaker A: You know, I imagine these founders sell thumb tokens and they buy, like, a house or two, but I don't think that they get liquid. A billion dollars.
00:32:37.358 - 00:32:41.274, Speaker B: And I saw both of you two chuckling over there like, you. You know something?
00:32:42.214 - 00:32:54.592, Speaker A: I don't. I mean, even with Mitch, right, like, he was scrambling and begging to get, like, $50. So I don't think a billion dollars is gettable right now.
00:32:54.728 - 00:33:18.710, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't think that guy's a billionaire. And I think this is what they said before, it's like, there's not enough money in crypto to price these things effectively. Maybe in a bull market, there's enough liquidity for OTC deals. But is it really reasonable, even at a 50% discount? Is there $600 million worth of money willing to buy soul? I really don't see that.
00:33:18.902 - 00:33:56.896, Speaker B: But just to be clear. So when Seoul peaked, and obviously Anatoly couldn't have sold the peak, but it peaked at about $80 billion fdv, I can guarantee with certainty. Well, I can't, but, like, let's just say he owned 5% of the token supply, which I think is actually quite conservative, just given my thoughts. Like, let's assume he owned 5% or even 1%, right? Like, he. He would have exited quite a bit during the bull market and could certainly acquire, like, a large portion of that soul if he wanted to. Now, I don't necessarily think he should do that if I were him, or he's incentivized to, but I'm just saying theoretically, like, he has the capital to do it.
00:33:57.000 - 00:34:17.410, Speaker C: I don't. So solo is like 70 billion right at its peak. So even if he had 1% and, like, sold the picotop and got no slippage, that's only 7 million. And, like, it's really hard for these people with, like, huge. Oh, also, like, most of his soul is locked. So I think most of his wealth is denominated in locked soul. And I really do think that more.
00:34:17.410 - 00:34:23.934, Speaker C: So the VC's and Alameda were able to sell the top rather than like, the team and the founders.
00:34:24.434 - 00:34:57.626, Speaker A: Yeah, there's definitely, like some three three situation going on where all the participants are trying not to sell when it's actually going well. They're actually probably more likely to sell after there's a crash and then a little bit of a correction. Probably the most selling happened when it went from, you know, 300 to 50 and then went back to, like, 80 for a while. 80, 90. That's probably when the VC's start realizing that they've had the crash. Like, you know, I've seen this, like, countless times with, with psychology where you feel invincible because you're at these all time highs and it just keeps pumping. So, no, you don't sell.
00:34:57.626 - 00:35:27.860, Speaker A: You don't sell there and then it crashes, like, you know, 60, 70, 80, 90%, and you get a little bit of a respite and you're like, okay, okay, okay. Like, now I'm going to sell. So probably around $100. Some people were selling. There's talks that multicoin and Kyle Samani was actually buying more there, which probably has made some people unhappy on the lp side. But I would imagine that that's probably where most of the exiting would have happened.
00:35:28.052 - 00:35:50.164, Speaker D: Yeah, I feel like it's more socially acceptable for team members to sell after a correction. Right. You never want, as a founder, you never want to sell the top because then people will hate you for it. But if you sell 30% lower, then, you know, it's okay. So I think there's also, like, social elements of crypto that founders have to deal with when, like, trying to exit tokens.
00:35:50.824 - 00:36:20.938, Speaker B: I mean, in this case, I don't necessarily agree with the social piece. Like, there's no doubt in my mind. Anatoly could, like, at the time, like, he could have sold a huge tranche to Genesis OTC and Genesis would have confidentially found buyers for that. Like, that was happening. I feel like all of the time in the bull market with Defi founders, but I definitely take the three of your guys points that, like, there's no way he perfectly timed the top. And even if he did, he probably doesn't have enough money that he would throw it all into buying soul and sort of like, doubling down at this point.
00:36:21.066 - 00:37:29.618, Speaker A: And I'll mention one more thing, like, why would you even buy it? Like, why would you step in? Why not just let whoever is liquidating, in this case galaxy for the estate, let them just hit whatever air bids, let them push it down, and then you can always, if you have dry capital, you can, you can use it to pop the price back after. There is no reason to step in front of, like, this train and all these, like, Solana community people. You know, I love them and amazing. You know, you guys have great vibes and great colors and great nfts and that's all amazing. Why would you want to, like, throw your financial life in front of, like, an oncoming train? Just let the train go through and then it'll still potentially rebound. Even if it goes down to a single digit altcoin, I can see it in two, three years, if the community sticks together, maybe getting over it, but the amount of cell pressure that's unlocking for years and years, it just destroys the concept of community money in my eyes. It destroys the ability for cavemen to get excited and coordinate, to build wealth together.
00:37:29.618 - 00:37:35.890, Speaker A: And I think this is going to be a painful lesson that will get slowly realized.
00:37:36.082 - 00:38:02.324, Speaker D: Do you feel the same way around, like, Dodx? Because a similar unlock is going to happen in December where the circulating supply of DYDX is going to increase significantly. Of course, the fundamentals, I mean, they're going to launch v four this month. Allegedly, there's going to be staking rates. How do you think about these unlock events? And is it worth trading around them, or do you just let the train come and then just pick up the pieces after?
00:38:02.484 - 00:38:30.930, Speaker A: I don't think DyDX is community money. It's much more of a financial application looking at cash flows. What's an exchange worth? And there's VC's and there's liquid funds. I don't think the unlock is going to be sold because the backers that they have are very well chosen. And this is another point about Solana. I don't want to get comments about being a Solana hater. You know, I used to own a lot of Solana, and I still like a lot of things around Solana.
00:38:30.930 - 00:38:55.476, Speaker A: But the fact that they chose the wrong backers and they chose Somali, they chose SPF, this will haunt them. For a very long time. And you look at who, who did UIdx choose? Yeah, like there's a few three arrows coins that, you know, maybe I'll try to buy OTC. No NFA. But you have paradigm polychain. You have like the biggest funds that are in good place. They have multi billion of aum.
00:38:55.476 - 00:39:02.732, Speaker A: Still, I don't think they're like looking to immediately dump, and I don't, I don't expect them to, to do that.
00:39:02.908 - 00:39:18.836, Speaker B: One other thing about DyDX that makes this like, something almost impossible to bet on is they've pushed back the unlocks also historically. So, like, during the bear market, they come, they. I think they just completely moved the unlock by like a year. Right. And like, theoretically they could easily do that again if they wanted to.
00:39:18.900 - 00:39:30.534, Speaker A: So I think the idea was move it until before goes live, because then the token will actually have utility and people will want to hold it for some reason. So the unlock is supposed to happen in December.
00:39:31.954 - 00:39:46.452, Speaker B: That's what stated publicly. Right. But the actual reason behind it could be just, we're in a bear market. Like, presumably if Dydx was hitting all time highs, they would have allowed trading and not wanted to wait for v four or whatever calling their new app.
00:39:46.548 - 00:40:00.824, Speaker A: I mean, we're seeing the same thing. You know, bear market means you need a good story or a good catalyst. Right? So it's the same thing. I'm curious what you guys think about Avax. So they're. Sorry, not Avax. Arbitrum.
00:40:00.824 - 00:40:36.994, Speaker A: Enough about Avax. So Arbitrum has had this grant program where they've had 100 plus applications from all the different apps, and each one has submitted a proposal, which is a very weird game theory thing, because they have to say how many tokens are going after, and there's not that many tokens. So it actually doesn't make sense. I'm not exactly sure what the lessons are going to be once we look back, but there's just been these random proposals and people say, I think I'm worth 14 million because I'm GMX. And okay, I'll just take 1 million, but 1 million is higher than your entire TVL.
00:40:37.184 - 00:40:39.118, Speaker C: There's just a bunch of stuff going.
00:40:39.166 - 00:41:10.402, Speaker A: On and it gets very political. The people who have the tokens are not necessarily voting on merit. They're voting on their friends, and it creates a temporary demand for the token. But once the voting is over and once those, I think it's 50 million arb that's going out, those are going to get farmed and potentially dumped. Vicky, have you been. I'm pretty sure you have your eyes on this. You're always close to the arbitrum community loves you from the day of your initial proposal here.
00:41:10.402 - 00:41:12.514, Speaker A: What do you think about what's going on there?
00:41:12.674 - 00:41:41.018, Speaker C: Yeah, I haven't trading it that much. I do think it's bullish for the projects and probably slightly small supply for arbitrum, but, yeah, I've always had some disdain towards this grant sort of set up just because, you know, it's kind of just like a popularity contest, like a political thing. It's, like, very much like who, you know, in the foundation, too. And, I don't know, it's just not like a game I like to play.
00:41:41.106 - 00:41:47.334, Speaker A: So, Taiki, do you think this is just a value transfer from the chain to the apps and what ends up happening there?
00:41:47.874 - 00:42:47.324, Speaker D: Yeah, I actually think that, like, the arbitrum Dao is like, this is like a 50 million token experiment, and there's, like, setting up the infrastructure for voting to happen, and then maybe in 2024, they can do, like, a 500 million incentive, and then, you know, like, people won't be scrambling to, you know, go through all the politics and whatnot. Like, I don't really think any arbitrary malls should be bid for this. I mean, sure, TvL might go up for, like, two months, but, you know, most of these projects are, like, dead on arrival, so it's not really gonna save them. Like, I am in the camp of, okay, like, maybe I'll farm some, maybe keep farming, accumulate some r, but I have no desire to buy all these, and most of these tokens are going to perpetexes. I think it's more productive if Arbitrum just gave a bunch to GMX, because that's their flagship product. If they give a few million dollars to Grail or Camelot, it doesn't really move the needle. But I'm not really against it.
00:42:47.324 - 00:42:56.296, Speaker D: I'm not bullish any of these tokens, to be honest. But I think it's more of, like, an experiment before they prepare for the next bull run as an experiment.
00:42:56.320 - 00:43:03.632, Speaker A: I think it's interesting. Like Justin says, just try stuff. Let's see how it goes. I think it's not perfectly designed. Nobody's going to be able to argue that it is.
00:43:03.728 - 00:43:34.736, Speaker B: But you do have to give them credit for making that conscious choice of their FTV. I just was looking at it. It's about $8 billion now, which seems like a lot, but who knows? That's what the market's valuing it at. I give them credit for accepting guaranteed sell pressure to, like, while FTV is so high to sort of deliver that to apps. I know, Jordy, with Mendel, you're taking like a huge app first approach and trying to promote an ecosystem. So, like, I give them credit for trying. It sounds like the execution's not the.
00:43:34.760 - 00:44:07.864, Speaker A: Best, but it's not even as far as optimism took it, you know, they were just giving retroactive grants to DAC, XPT, and nice community members. So, you know, they went full, like, you know, here, just take tokens. It's a different approach and we'll see what happens. I mean, on the optimism plus side, they did show that there's a bid. They managed to sell a ton of it OTC without touching the book. So yeah, we'll see how it plays out. And normally we have a closing segment like a pasta of the week.
00:44:07.864 - 00:44:23.684, Speaker A: This week. I have been laughing my ass off on some of the memes on crypto, Twitter. We're changing up a little bit. We're gonna do a tech of the week. So let's look at some of the memes. What's everybody's favorite memes being this week?
00:44:24.224 - 00:44:49.766, Speaker B: So this had, this tweet had me in stitches. I was really cracking up. And I think this is real news, too. So from coming out of blockworks, it looks like the beloved grocery store, Trader Joe's. If you're based in the States, you're definitely familiar with it. People love this place. And it looks like they've brought a lawsuit against Trader Joe the Dex on avalanche and arbitrum for using their name, which is absolutely hilarious to me.
00:44:49.766 - 00:45:00.794, Speaker B: And I know, Jordy, you're looking at bringing a Dex of a similar name, I believe, Trader Moe to mantle. Are you rethinking the naming convention here or are you talking to the team about this at all?
00:45:01.294 - 00:45:15.020, Speaker A: Yeah, this is going to be the same team. So it's going to be an official. It's not going to be like a, you know, a shitty fork. This is going to be the official one. You know, look, the team's great. They're like one of the few Avax protocols that has not gotten hacked. They're not a fork.
00:45:15.020 - 00:45:33.208, Speaker A: They have their own version of concentrated liquidity and everything else. So I think it's a good team. I don't know why they're just getting sued now. They've been around for a long time. I remember farming this thing back during the bull market. So whoever is in charge of this grocery store, you know, maybe now they're paying more attention to crypto for whatever reason.
00:45:33.356 - 00:45:46.032, Speaker B: Yeah, it's funny because this is like a free spirited grocery store. Like, everyone there wears hawaiian shirts. They're all, like, crunchy, nice people. Like, you would never think they'd be big litigators. But I'm curious if they go after Trader Moe now, do you think this.
00:45:46.048 - 00:46:22.514, Speaker D: Is, like, this might be like, an interesting question, but obviously, like, the question was, okay, like, from their side, like, their perspective, like, was it worth being sued to name their Dex trader Joe? I actually think it was worth it because I think Trader Joe, like, during the bull market, it was a really familiar name. It got them billions of TVL, lots of fees, gots attract, like, lots of traction. And sure, like, they might, you know, have to pay a fine or something, but I don't know, like, I feel like they actually, like this was worth it, right? It's like, it's like the reverse Martin Gale strategy of, like, okay, like, I might, I might get sued, but I only get sued if we gain traction. So what do you guys think about that?
00:46:23.094 - 00:46:25.246, Speaker C: They're, they're a decentralized organization, right?
00:46:25.270 - 00:46:26.114, Speaker B: How can you.
00:46:26.934 - 00:46:29.174, Speaker D: That's the maker. Now, arguments.
00:46:30.434 - 00:46:33.414, Speaker A: Vicki, what kind of keck do you have this week?
00:46:34.154 - 00:47:15.894, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm going to quote myself on this one. Yes. I think thinking about what happened with thought and Avax and seeing how low liquidity and low defi activity is going on just across all ones, it reminded me very much of these chinese ghost cities where in order to fund their economy, they just built a ton of these cities and, like, no one actually lives in them anymore. And I just get the same vibe from this. And also all the lms out there and not just, you know, the alto ones, even like the main one, like ETH, like six g way right now. So very much like, block space is very abundant right now. For the metaverse citizens, it's a great analogy.
00:47:15.934 - 00:47:24.534, Speaker A: I think all these buildings remind me of, you know, developers spending a lot of time writing all this code and making all these tools, and then there's just nobody there.
00:47:24.874 - 00:47:41.934, Speaker B: It's funny how the narrative changed, right? Like, during the peak of the bull market, crypto can't scale. There's not enough block space. Like, block space isn't a commodity. People will pay whatever they, like, can afford for ETH. But that's clearly all gone the wayside. And now we're looking at these empty cities.
00:47:42.434 - 00:47:59.568, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I think the A 16 z, like, bull market comment about there not being enough block space right now, there is. So maybe once there's new use cases, we might run out again. There's always a chance. Taiki, how about you?
00:47:59.656 - 00:48:28.496, Speaker D: Yeah. So I guess this kind of ties into what we were talking about earlier around having all these crypto projects, whether it be defi nfts l one s, you kind of need all the cavemen to just get together and just be hyped around community money or, you know, like, whatever. Like, is there some value around their project? And I thought this was pretty funny. Whatever. Nft project. Trying to hire an NFT community babysitter. Just bullet posting every single day.
00:48:28.496 - 00:48:42.092, Speaker D: You know, like, this smells bullish. Screw the footers. I feel like every team kind of needs, like, ironically, I do think every crypto project kind of needs someone like this, even though it does sound pretty ridiculous.
00:48:42.208 - 00:48:50.664, Speaker A: This is an epic job description. I think you need to read out for our Spotify listeners a couple of these tasks here for this community builder.
00:48:51.324 - 00:49:11.644, Speaker D: Yeah. So NFT community babysitter tasks. Change diapers of bag holders when they start to cry on Twitter feed and burp little babies when they get impatient and start fudding. Give them shiny or sensory objects to keep them occupied when they get bored and have nothing to tweet about anymore. Read them bedtime stories about how bullish you are. And this is a full time job.
00:49:13.344 - 00:49:44.204, Speaker A: This is extremely accurate. I feel like an ultimate keck. This is a very strong, very strong one. My kecks. I have a keck a and a keck b. They're both related to the Avax drama. You know, this meme has been used for different circumstances, but just given, given the drama, you know, do you have protection? He takes the picture of Amin and he says, we're already protected, baby.
00:49:44.204 - 00:50:01.262, Speaker A: So poor dart has been killing it. Shout out to him. The memes have been ultimate. And there's one more that Michael E. Polito gave out. So, yeah, so Ipolito had a great one. It's arrested development.
00:50:01.262 - 00:50:24.382, Speaker A: So hopefully our listeners are aware of that show. Otherwise it's gonna blow a bit above their heads. But, you know, you have these, like, out of touch reach people, and this is exactly what he's coming out. He's just saying, like, it's just one hack. Michael. How much could it cost? $3 million. This is exactly capturing the, the essence of, you know, the reaction of the community and myself.
00:50:24.438 - 00:50:27.650, Speaker B: So I think we outdid ourselves this week.
00:50:27.802 - 00:50:35.090, Speaker A: Great set of kecks. I don't know. I feel like taikis kind of came out of left field, and really, it was very good.
00:50:35.122 - 00:50:41.330, Speaker B: Tanky's won my vote, too. It's just too accurate. I mean, it's literally factual. It's just too good.
00:50:41.442 - 00:50:45.394, Speaker A: Taiki, you win. Once again, keck of the week for Taiki.
00:50:45.514 - 00:50:47.234, Speaker D: Damn. I'm on, like, a winning streak.
00:50:47.394 - 00:50:50.730, Speaker B: We didn't get thinking, though. It could be a tiebreaker.
00:50:50.882 - 00:51:10.148, Speaker D: I like the chinese ghost cities, too. It's so accurate. I feel like with all the VC's, right, it's just like all the investment goes into infrastructure, and then everyone forgets to build, like, actual applications. And, you know, as a result, we have all these alto ones, like, just bleeding against bitcoin in ether. In perpetuity. Yeah. Something has to change at some point, right?
00:51:10.236 - 00:51:25.198, Speaker A: Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. We'll see you next week. And I'm looking forward to reading the comments. You know, they're usually comments on Thicki's, you know, guns and his. His good looks. I think we're gonna get some haircut comments this time, Thiki. So you're the picky fans out there.
00:51:25.198 - 00:51:29.374, Speaker A: Go wild in the comments looking. See you next time, guys.
