00:00:00.200 - 00:00:05.526, Speaker A: People that got their drop is like, oh, yeah. Like, I mean, cool. And then ETH maxis are like, grift, grift.
00:00:05.710 - 00:00:16.694, Speaker B: The truth is somewhere in the middle. I don't think he's grifting. I think he believes everything he's saying. Some of it sounds insane to me. Like, he's not gonna give out any money until he tenexes the users and, like, you know, takes over the world.
00:00:16.734 - 00:00:17.990, Speaker A: And does it sort of signal where.
00:00:18.022 - 00:00:34.174, Speaker C: Things are gonna be at in another six months? Cause this wouldn't have happened even six months ago. It definitely wouldn't have happened a year ago. But this is, you know, really a staggering amount of capital. And I just feel like it's showing that there's a lot of, like, pent up capital in crypto that's looking to sort of deploy in more speculative things.
00:00:54.644 - 00:01:08.756, Speaker B: Welcome, everybody. Episode 28, showtime. I'm so jacked to the tits. I'm gonna skip the intros. You guys know who we are. Being here for half a year plus now, man, this week, I had a bit of excitement. This is like the bo.
00:01:08.756 - 00:01:24.416, Speaker B: This is very different vibes than when we started the podcast. Right now, I feel like there is just $700 million airdrop, and then, like, fudding it. Yeah. So we're recording a little bit after the Jupiter day. Call it. Vicki, did you. Did you participate in Jupiter day?
00:01:24.540 - 00:01:34.256, Speaker D: Yeah, I got a pretty generous airdrop. I haven't been trading it too much, but it's been really interesting to observe. I studied the launch details quite closely, so we can dive into that if you want.
00:01:34.400 - 00:01:42.544, Speaker B: How many air drafts did you get? Do you just have one wallet? Do you have, like, a bunch of them? Was it just coincidentally you got one, or were you, like, farming it? Like, what happened?
00:01:42.664 - 00:01:52.976, Speaker D: I didn't farm it, but I should have. I had, like, some wallets I just randomly swapped on just part of normal behavior, and I got probably, like, 2025 grand worth of Jupe. Very generous with airdrop.
00:01:53.120 - 00:01:53.792, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:01:53.848 - 00:01:54.856, Speaker A: Airdrops are insane.
00:01:55.000 - 00:01:56.040, Speaker B: You got some, too?
00:01:56.192 - 00:02:15.888, Speaker A: No, actually, I might have gotten in one wallet I haven't checked yet. But best case scenario, just one wallet. So I haven't been farming this whole ecosystem that aggressively. I'm starting to, though. I'm doing drift. I'll probably farm Jupiter more for season two. And I'll also look into parcel and tensor.
00:02:15.888 - 00:02:17.756, Speaker A: I think those are potentially really good.
00:02:17.900 - 00:02:31.332, Speaker C: Yeah, I gotta. I don't think I have it, but I have to check. I'll check in after the show. But did saga phone holders by chance get a nice, generous airdrop as early ecosystem supporters or no, you know, I.
00:02:31.348 - 00:02:56.526, Speaker B: Hope mad lads got, got some. I got a mad lads, but maybe, maybe I missed the snapshot. I don't know when these, my understanding is, like, there's gonna be more airdrops, right? This is like one of four. So I do think this is a trend. I mean, from, you know, the stuff that I've been designing on mantle side, it is also like sequential airdrop. You don't want to just, you know, kind of blow it once and you're done. You want to be able to reload.
00:02:56.526 - 00:03:04.542, Speaker B: But, Vicky, tell us a little bit about, you know, the specific Jupiter one and how you saw the mechanics of it.
00:03:04.718 - 00:03:22.224, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's a bit unfortunate because, like, I think when teams try to be more transparent, they, a lot of times they end up getting punished for that. So what Jup did that was different than most launches. Most launches are typically, like, use a market maker and they'll give them some supply of tokens.
00:03:22.264 - 00:03:23.432, Speaker A: And then there'd be like, an option.
00:03:23.488 - 00:03:36.696, Speaker D: To where, like, if the token settles above a certain price, then the market maker basically can, like, pocket a spread and make some money that way. Dupe did it. So that, like, they skip the market maker and instead they allocated around 2.5%.
00:03:36.760 - 00:03:37.036, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:37.080 - 00:03:58.824, Speaker D: Tokens into a single site liquidity pool. So from 0.4 to 0.7, they were selling 250 million juke tokens. And after seven days, after the price settled, basically the team would get the proceeds of that sale. So it's kind of like an Ico sale, kind of like skipping the market maker, that sort of thing, in order to provide liquidity on a launch.
00:03:59.724 - 00:04:22.984, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is not like a liquidity pool in the sense of what we're traditionally used to where other people can join in and provide liquidity. Like, nobody can provide liquidity. It's a bonding curve. I think it's a little bit similar. I was getting flashbacks and the people have been following me for a few years. Might remember when Sam Trabuco beat me to the $25 million auction for it was a single block of Stargate token.
00:04:23.364 - 00:04:25.780, Speaker C: You were trying to win that. I had no idea.
00:04:25.972 - 00:04:55.968, Speaker B: We had a whole crew together. We had, I can't say some of the famous traders kind of bunching up, trying to do this, and we, we had a little glitch at the end. We couldn't get the order in. Anyway, it was so I had a similar deja vu yesterday because I saw this, like, bonding curve thing and I've seen this shit before. Like, I know at some point it's going to eat it up. And I was willing to bid, you know, at least halfway through, you know, 5.5 cents or something.
00:04:55.968 - 00:05:33.758, Speaker B: I was happy to do it and I did do it. I mean, I put the orders in, but yeah, I think Celini needs to get some Solana mev guy because the limit orders just didn't even fill. Like it was as if they didn't exist. Stuff was happening, the prices that were going through, but unfortunately no fills. And it turns out that us plebs, using the public RPC nodes and using the normal wallets and not using the private stuff had no shot. So I think it was a very mixed review. Some people think it went really well.
00:05:33.758 - 00:05:51.820, Speaker B: Like the chain didn't go down and then a lot of other people just couldn't get transaction through for quite a long time and couldn't claim, couldn't sell, couldn't buy consent tokens. I'm curious, Taiki, if you even try to use Solana during this period.
00:05:51.942 - 00:06:13.964, Speaker A: Yeah, so I mean, actually yesterday I was trying to mint an NFT on Metaplex and I couldn't mint it for whatever reason. Probably because Jupiter, I thought there's like some paralyzed stuff going on where, you know, if the DeFi side is congested, that NFT side won't be congested. But maybe, I mean, I'm not 100% sure, to be honest, but I was trying to like mincemen FT's. I couldn't do it.
00:06:14.704 - 00:06:21.664, Speaker B: We have the biggest airdrop in history in Taikis. They're like trying to emit some like random NFT. It's like the house on fire.
00:06:22.204 - 00:06:25.116, Speaker C: We have a meme for that. I think we're saving it for the end though, right?
00:06:25.220 - 00:06:54.812, Speaker A: Yeah, actually I can share my mid crib NFT later, but it was just for fun. Wait, thank you. I'm curious. My understanding of the token launch was it's similar to the team essentially providing single sided liquidity v three between 0.4 and seven, and anyone can just slam USDC in to get tokens. So was that kind of the mechanism? I know it's called the DLMM or something, but to be honest, I'm kind of mid curbing this.
00:06:54.988 - 00:07:30.472, Speaker D: Yeah, that's exactly it. But like most of these projects, they'll give market makers like a token and they'll market make both two sides and it's just the same thing. It's like they don't have cash, so they just provide their token into single sided. And this provides it some sort of range that they say. But the thing is, once the price goes to 0.6, for example, then the USDC proceeds of selling the token is offered as two sided liquidity for people that want to sell into it. So basically, the way you think about it is at 0.4
00:07:30.472 - 00:07:39.378, Speaker D: it's all token, and at seven it's all cash. And whatever, it settles that at the end of the seven days is what the team gets to recoup, essentially.
00:07:39.506 - 00:07:48.894, Speaker C: I have some breaking news. I don't know if we have a banner to flash, but I just checked my wallet. As we were chatting, I checked one of a few wallets in Solana and I qualified for the airdrop, which is great news.
00:07:50.314 - 00:07:50.978, Speaker D: How much?
00:07:51.066 - 00:07:52.330, Speaker A: Just in. Got some liquidity.
00:07:52.442 - 00:07:53.654, Speaker B: What tier are you?
00:07:54.354 - 00:07:58.434, Speaker C: I don't know about tiers, but it's 1200 tokens. I'm not sure how much that equates.
00:07:58.474 - 00:08:00.618, Speaker A: To, but, oh, it's like $100.
00:08:00.706 - 00:08:02.482, Speaker C: Well, I guess I'll have a nice dinner.
00:08:02.658 - 00:08:09.100, Speaker B: You know, this is first world problems. That's considered a problem. Pretty flabby airdrop right there.
00:08:09.212 - 00:08:10.852, Speaker C: Well, when I heard about thinking, I.
00:08:10.868 - 00:08:42.600, Speaker B: Mean, yeah, I mean, we have seen a lot of conversations on Twitter. I mean, first of all, to Thicke's point, you know, I know a lot of our audience is in the space and they like hearing about market makers. So, to be specific, like there, there were market maker loans out in order to deal with centralized exchanges. The centralized exchanges were a bit of a shit show. Kucoin decided to launch early. This trend now, like the exchanges try to beat each other because they don't want to launch at the same time. They want to get, like, the volume first.
00:08:42.600 - 00:09:07.468, Speaker B: So Kucoin launched first. The price was literally trading above 20 billion for quite some minutes. I went like 10, 15, 20. Whoever, like, had tokens. And a little birdie told me our friend Andre was part of that, who, you know, uh, got allocation to that loan. Um, you know, could, could maybe do something there. So there were still some of that.
00:09:07.468 - 00:09:36.998, Speaker B: There was a lot of fud around, you know, Solana noobs. I mean, I'll, I'll, I'll be honest, I haven't, like, gone too much on chain in Solana. I bought my mad lads. I've done a few things, checked out. It was hard to get transactions through. I didn't, you know, uh, I'm not as familiar with. With how to navigate the different wallets, especially when you're dealing with, you know, institutional grade wallets that are not as simple as just clicking around Fanta with rpcs, but it was a little bit tough to operate yesterday, that's for sure.
00:09:36.998 - 00:09:46.974, Speaker B: And the Twitter ethereum crew has come out with the pitchforks. Maybe we can put some of the tweets out.
00:09:47.054 - 00:10:25.150, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Hasu had a really aggressive take on the situation because, I mean, I guess it's essentially, I mean, Miao, the founder of Jupiter said that this is basically an open market sale of the token. So to my understanding, Jupiter doesn't have VC's, so they just raising from the community and Hasu part of eat the line for sure. Calling it a grift. Evan also, I mean, Evan, I think he's like a salon of bull to some extent, but I think he's publicly criticizing the way that all this happened. What do you guys think about this tweet from Hasu?
00:10:25.302 - 00:10:56.946, Speaker B: Yeah, so, I mean, the founder of Jupiter has definitely been a little bit populist and fuck the VC's. We're the people. And then he kind of just basically creates a mechanism where he's gonna rug a few hundred million out of the ecosystem and I don't expect him to just sort of take it, you know, off chain or something. I'm pretty confident that he's gonna, you know, do. Do something with it. You know, the result is a little bit interesting. Yeah.
00:10:56.946 - 00:11:20.858, Speaker B: I'm curious what Zach, XBT and those guys would think. I mean, normally when they see an NFT mint and somebody tries to mint, like, more than $20 million, you know, they go crazy. Like, why? You know, you're grifting. Trying to raise 40 million doesn't make sense. Like, nobody needs 40 million. You know, this is a huge raise. I think Meow has said that if he just tried to OTC with.
00:11:20.858 - 00:11:25.634, Speaker B: With funds, he would have gotten a similar valuation and a similar amount.
00:11:25.794 - 00:11:26.690, Speaker D: There's no way.
00:11:26.802 - 00:11:27.826, Speaker B: You don't think so?
00:11:28.010 - 00:11:29.442, Speaker D: 6 billion? No way.
00:11:29.578 - 00:11:40.410, Speaker B: Hard to say. Hard to say. You know, the revenue numbers pretty good, actually, from what I've seen. I don't know how much of it is related to the airdrop activity. But don't you guys think it's interesting.
00:11:40.442 - 00:12:08.732, Speaker C: That in our industry, we try to like. It just seems to me that the project's responsibility is to basically raise as much capital as they can to keep building for as long as possible and deliver the best product. But in our industry, we also sort of hold the project accountable to temper how they launch a token, how they raise capital, et cetera, because our space is so inefficient that there's no grounding in reality. It's very weird, right. For the project. Clearly this is the best thing for them to do.
00:12:08.928 - 00:12:39.594, Speaker D: Well, I was going to say the main point of contention. I think typically the tokens of liquidity are provided from the foundation, so whatever they raise is kept on the foundation. It is unprecedented to have team tokens get unlocked day one where there is no responsibility. They don't necessarily have to put it back in the project or grow the ecosystem that they could, if they wanted to, just cash it out. I think that's the main point of weirdness about this lot. So even from the foundation, completely normal.
00:12:39.674 - 00:13:22.372, Speaker A: And to follow up on that, Jordy, you said this rugged 100 or $20 million from the ecosystem. I wouldn't think of it that way. Everyone thinks that Jupiter is the best app on Solana. It's basically the front end of Solana, and I've been talking to a few Solana Maxis or the Solana bowls, and they think that it's reasonable for Jupiter to flip uni. Even circulating marquette wise, just because they have ways to monetize their platform is basically like one inch plus GMX, plus a launchpad. And there's things that you can only do on Solana, so that can also just create new use cases and actually just grow. Like the TAm, which I thought was pretty interesting.
00:13:22.372 - 00:13:30.310, Speaker A: I'm starting to try to be more open minded about the flana ecosystem and not try to compare it to l two s, for example, because they're very different.
00:13:30.412 - 00:13:46.250, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I also tried to, you know, I bridged a bunch of money, like I said, I was trying to buy a ton of Jubit, you know, in the fives. I felt like it was going to be a great trade. I. I moved like eight figures in. I was going to. I was going to just buy, you know, as much as possible.
00:13:46.250 - 00:14:08.012, Speaker B: I was definitely, you know, reminded of the. The Stargate thing. So I tried to go all in, you know, didn't really manage to get any. And then I just started playing with the other stuff. I put like a bunch of money and camino and marginfi. I think the yields were pretty high because people were borrowing, trying to do all the activity. Yeah, it's a little bit of a different feel, different ecosystem.
00:14:08.012 - 00:14:16.988, Speaker B: They do things a little bit differently. It's interesting. I'll definitely be checking into my deposits there and see how it's going.
00:14:17.116 - 00:15:00.062, Speaker A: It kind of reminds me of binance smart chain in Q one of 2021, where people were just fed up with Ethereum gas fees, and I guess that lack of speed and as soon as retail came back to the crypto markets, they were like, you know what? Screw ETH doesn't really. It's not really usable. Let's just go on a cheaper chain where I can speculate and potentially turn $100 into one hundred k mass people have done with the Jiro airdrop. So I feel like airdrop farming and all these new token launches is kind of like a Trojan horse for crypto adoption in the sense that people are actually downloading wallets, bridging money on chain, trying crypto for the first time. And whether they stick around or not, I have no idea, but I think it's a good thing. I think airdrop farming is, like, a net positive to this space.
00:15:00.198 - 00:15:43.128, Speaker C: Taki. I remember when that happened with BSc, sort of stealing a lot of defi summers thunder from Ethereum. At the time, I was so ideologically aligned with Ethereum, much more so than I am now, because when you're working with engineers and you're sort of trying to build in this space, there is this, like, holier than thou ethereum sort of circle, right? Like, most of the influencers on Twitter, most of the engineers, most of the quote unquote, like, smarter folks seem to be ethereum aligned. And I was just very caught up in that and was discounting other ecosystems. And because of that, I sort of missed out on the Alt L1 season. That sort of happened in late 2021 and 2022. But I'm determined not to miss that this time, if that.
00:15:43.128 - 00:15:44.072, Speaker C: That's how it plays out.
00:15:44.088 - 00:16:14.304, Speaker B: Again, there are a couple things I want to touch upon before we move on to another topic. So, I mean, a lot of the fud and the one that I kind of say I probably agree on the most, I disliked the optics of they charged themselves to launch their own token on their own launchpad, and they paid themselves a huge fee. I don't know. It was like 50 million, 60 million as, like, a fee for, like. Yeah. Which ended up being, like, massive. It reminds me of, you know, like, when wework.
00:16:14.304 - 00:16:24.444, Speaker B: Adam Newman, like, sold the word weed to him to, like, his own company for, like, $6 million or something. It's just such a bad idea to.
00:16:24.484 - 00:16:28.492, Speaker A: Do that, I guess. Like, the meow's excuse.
00:16:28.508 - 00:16:28.756, Speaker B: Is that.
00:16:28.780 - 00:16:57.564, Speaker A: Okay? Like, you know, this. This is, you know, we're launching this token on our launchpad, and if other Solana projects want to drop a token, they can use our launchpad and we can learn from our mistakes or whatever. So, you know, like, I think sentiments, I feel like there's like a dichotomy of thoughts. It's like people that got their drop is like, oh, yeah. Like, I mean, you know, like, cool. And then ETH maxis are like, grift, grift. But, you know, I think that's too extreme on both sides.
00:16:58.144 - 00:17:22.160, Speaker B: I agree with you, actually. I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. I don't think he's grifting. I think he believes everything he's saying. Some of it sounds insane to me, like, he's not going to give out any money until he ten x is the users and, like, you know, takes over the world. And sometimes you forget how niche, you know, Dexs and all this stuff really is. And I understand we're building new financial systems, but I don't know, one step at a time.
00:17:22.160 - 00:17:24.296, Speaker B: I'm a little bit more grounded.
00:17:24.440 - 00:17:48.768, Speaker C: Do you guys think that this happening this week and the crazy amount of capital involved, whether you think it's right or wrong, is sort of a different question, but does it sort of signal where things are going to be added another six months? Because this wouldn't have happened even six months ago. It definitely wouldn't have happened a year ago. But this is really a staggering amount of capital. And I just feel like it's showing that there's a lot of pent up capital in crypto that's looking to deploy in more speculative things.
00:17:48.896 - 00:18:11.742, Speaker A: And this also creates a wealth effect for the Solana users, because if eat people want exposure to Sol and they buy Jupiter, then it's a transfer of wealth from ETH aligned holders to, I guess, this one at DGens, and that only makes the community stronger. So I think Solana is going to do really well this cycle. I'm still trying to figure out how to allocate, but I'm like, this is farming right now.
00:18:11.838 - 00:18:57.788, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, one last thing on this topic, the one that you just mentioned about the wealth effect, it's something that I'm still noodling with. I've talked about it on a few of the most recent podcasts where I'm not quite sure, like, is this just like leveraging, or is it actual wealth being created? Because ultimately there's a fixed amount of money, you know, in the stable coins in the ecosystem. This huge event comes out and we say, okay, this thing is valuable. It's really valuable compared to all this other stuff. So we need to just, you know, give everybody, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars that money is not really coming from, like, traffic or, you know, like somewhere else. So it's just sort of has to rotate from somewhere. And the only way to rotate without dropping other bags is to like increased leverage somewhere in the system.
00:18:57.788 - 00:19:13.704, Speaker B: Somewhere somehow in the system, the same amount of dollars is creating higher valuations and a higher market cap overall for everything. So that's a little bit dangerous. I mean, we did see a little bit of a sell off afterwards and I don't know if it's related to sort of getting over skis a bit.
00:19:14.044 - 00:19:33.128, Speaker D: I think it was especially the most recent new launches got sold off pretty hard until the juke launched. Like manta, alt, Hondo all got sold off pretty hard at the Jup launch. I think it's quite interesting to guess where that recreational capital came from.
00:19:33.256 - 00:19:49.164, Speaker C: Thikki, do you still believe that everything over the next six months alts just. Well, I think you said go to zero. Obviously you were being hyperbolic, but do you think everything just sort of bleeds over the next six months after this post CTF hype? Are you still that mindset or no longer?
00:19:49.934 - 00:20:22.430, Speaker D: I think it kind of has to. If you look at the most five recent big name watches, that's around $18 billion of FTV to the entire space. And the entire altcoin market caps at like 300. So it's like 6% of the market cap. It needs to find cash buyers to buy. So I think what we see is like, I think new coins will continue to do very well and launch at very rich valuations because there's still a lot of attention in the space, there's still a lot of capital for you up. But, like, it.
00:20:22.430 - 00:20:34.742, Speaker D: It comes at the expense of these older coins that are possibly unlocking, investing. Like, those coins are going to probably go to zero. Those ones with like, not great narratives just unlocking vc's like, yeah, you know.
00:20:34.758 - 00:21:24.456, Speaker B: Like the thing we talked about last time with like, new coin good, I've had a lot of like, friend kind of, you know, serious traders message me after and they're like, why are you like spilling the alpha like that? You're like ruining the metagame now. And they're actually right. Like, today I just like, log on to Twitter and I see some of. Some of the threaders, like, talking about, like, new coin good and describing why new coin good. So it's, it's gone out there. I think, like one of the reasons why new coin good I was thinking about this today is like, when there's new coin, there's a lot of price discovery to happen and there's like a very wide range of opinions, because somebody might think, like, zeta chain launched today, and it's like, oh, is this sort of, like chain flip? And then it's like 600 million val or. No, this is like rune.
00:21:24.456 - 00:21:50.714, Speaker B: So this should be like a few billion. This is like layer zero. This should be many billion. So there's this like this. It's like. It's like an interesting new game. Because if you're just trading, you know, ethereum all day, like, okay, maybe it's 22, 23, 100, but you get these interesting spots where it's a game, trying to figure out where does this end up in the stack? And that gets the attention, I think.
00:21:51.094 - 00:22:22.514, Speaker A: Yeah. And also, one thing I was thinking about is all the new coins, they're kind of in new categories. Eigen layer might launch $20 billion valuation. Alt layer is introducing restaked roll ups, investing in new category leaders with no comps. Manta, at least. Can Manta get above arbitrum? Probably not. But can Eigen layer get to 100 billion? Who knows? Maybe no one really knows how to value these things.
00:22:22.514 - 00:22:38.962, Speaker A: So it's all about narrative speculation, and there's no upper bound for the val. So I think that's why it's also things can get crazy. And I think I'm trying to get out the mid curve and try to think more. Left curve and maybe not right curve or left curve. Sure.
00:22:39.098 - 00:22:46.658, Speaker B: Thank you. Show us the epic, epic, epic meme site.
00:22:46.786 - 00:22:56.934, Speaker A: Oh, also, we talked about me minting the NFT on Solana yesterday. Justin, can you pull up my screen? I literally minted this on Solana.
00:22:58.754 - 00:22:59.066, Speaker B: Just.
00:22:59.090 - 00:23:12.694, Speaker A: To experiment with, like, the tech, because I. I think metaplex is kind of cool, like this one and compressed nfts. And I'm like, okay, like, how much does it cost to mint this thing? It cost me, like, 0.01 sol or something. I'm like, all right, all right. That's. That's good.
00:23:12.854 - 00:23:15.354, Speaker C: Is that for sale? Can we buy that?
00:23:16.014 - 00:23:22.558, Speaker A: It's a 101 owned by me. I'm not going to sell this. I mean, this experimentation, you know, just. I'm just experimenting.
00:23:22.686 - 00:23:28.744, Speaker B: The left curve. The left curve one is my favorite. It's just, you know, he's so ecstatic. Just simple happiness.
00:23:29.204 - 00:23:29.820, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:29.932 - 00:23:36.224, Speaker B: Like Georgian of mice and men. It's just like this pure, low iq joy.
00:23:37.444 - 00:23:41.744, Speaker C: If only we were all there. That would be nice. I'm trying to get there, too. Taiki.
00:23:42.044 - 00:23:42.396, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:42.420 - 00:23:45.504, Speaker A: And if you noticed, there's, like, some saliva in the left curve. Taiki.
00:23:48.204 - 00:23:48.556, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:48.580 - 00:23:59.614, Speaker A: I'm drooling and the mid curve tyche is just always pissed. And then right curve, I'll never be at this level. He's even wearing some chains here. So lots of swagger in this one.
00:24:00.674 - 00:24:03.282, Speaker C: On that note, I wanted to pull this up.
00:24:03.378 - 00:24:08.058, Speaker B: I said it's Georgia of a Mason man, but it's actually Lenny. Lenny's the one that likes the rabbits.
00:24:08.106 - 00:24:32.310, Speaker C: Okay, sorry, clarification important. No Tyky. I've been loving this meme here where I feel like we're jumping ahead to pasta of the week, but I've got something different. But I love this meme that shows, like, crypto. Twitter is actually at the very far left. But, you know, in our little circle, we have segments of the population that think they're very much on the right or left, but really we're all sort of like. It's just translated over.
00:24:32.310 - 00:24:33.434, Speaker C: I think it's good.
00:24:34.294 - 00:24:36.434, Speaker D: Pretty much, yeah.
00:24:37.894 - 00:24:46.692, Speaker B: So let's move on. You know, some of the other topics, maybe not, not as fresh as this, but what's the latest with ETF flow? Sticky.
00:24:46.878 - 00:25:41.886, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the big narrative this week was, and like last Friday, it was like grayscale slowing down. We've seen like the outflows there slowed down from 5600 million a day down to like 1200 million. It's very good because here's like, people that were long grayscale speculatively and were unhedged, or like slowing down. And I guess it's being offset by the nine ETF's volumes decreasing and those inflows slowing down too. We're still seeing like Blackrock and Fidelity do like 100, $200 million a day of inflows and grayscale at -200 so the number we really care about is what the steady state number is where we settle at. And the bar is quite low. If we can settle at $20 million a day of consistent inflows, that completely offsets half the miner supply currently.
00:25:41.886 - 00:25:51.502, Speaker D: And what's happening is over. It offsets all of it at that point. Bitcoin doesn't become some constant leading down asset. It actually might riding up like, equities.
00:25:51.558 - 00:25:55.514, Speaker B: Do, dare we say, does it become ultrasound money, Vicki?
00:25:56.694 - 00:25:58.942, Speaker D: Well, I could say that, yeah, I.
00:25:58.958 - 00:26:16.134, Speaker C: Could say that it didn't matter for ETH. I mean, maybe it did. We'll never know what would have happened if proof of stake didn't happen. But like, seemingly, at least with ETH BTC, it's just been down only mode since the merge. These flows are that important or is something else going on?
00:26:17.234 - 00:26:58.872, Speaker D: Well, it's around the same price. It matters to the narrative. I think sentiment does matter most of all because there's 1015 $20 billion of crypto native hedge fund capital, and there's even more tradfi money that goes in and out. And those things, if the real flow is only 20, $30 million a day, those sentiments can really just cause a lot more variability in price than $20 million a day. But when you look at things over the course of 1234 years, those flows actually start adding up. $20 million a day over a year for tried by business days, $5 billion a year. If it hit that consistently, that really does change the trajectory of the price.
00:26:59.008 - 00:27:20.164, Speaker A: Yeah, and like demand matters too, right? Because people do stock the flow and they're like, okay, like supply low, so price up. But, you know, I mean, touch on Et BTC. I mean, yeah, like the supply dynamics improved, but maybe there's just like not that much demand to buy the 250 billion, you know, market gap, as long as it doesn't really scale. And bitcoin is now ultrasound money.
00:27:22.824 - 00:27:56.910, Speaker B: I still remain bullish on ETH BTC. I think the Celsius washout was, was a bit annoying to digest quite large amounts. I think they're distributing now. I think whatever stuff they have left, as I understand it, I think FTX also had an announcement that seemed quite bullish. They are also going to be returning a lot of money back. It looks like no surprise there to people who've been following it recently. And also I think we had some positive headlines about Ethereum ETF.
00:27:56.910 - 00:28:06.664, Speaker B: And I think as people get over the grayscale selling and they realize that ETF is probably good in the end, that will help the ETH narrative as well.
00:28:07.244 - 00:28:27.474, Speaker C: So are you still thinking that because you were saying 0.080.09 even possibly new highs on the ratio or 0.11 or something like that, you haven't changed on that at all? Because I know we had a huge positive reaction after the ETF happened and then we've sort of like, know, retrace most of that. But your thesis hasn't changed at all.
00:28:28.014 - 00:28:54.210, Speaker B: No, it hasn't changed. I think the Celsius selling delayed things. Ultimately it's all about a flywheel and it just sort of like goes and doesn't stop. People have to kind of rotate. But I think it delayed things, you know, to a certain extent. We still looking at May 23 is what they're saying for the ETF period. We'll need to get closer to it, maybe where it's within view and the hype builds.
00:28:54.210 - 00:29:22.674, Speaker B: We still have the bitcoin having before that. I think it's in April. Mid April I think is the date that I saw. But I own both assets. Still a bit more skewed on ETH, maybe because I'm really excited about meth. I'm holding there. As this episode is coming out, I think we will have just announced that we are raising the cap one more time from 3333 to 420 69.
00:29:22.674 - 00:29:31.510, Speaker B: So one last chance for people to get in before the real fun begins.
00:29:31.582 - 00:29:40.834, Speaker C: Jody, I was going to ask you, because the return is so much higher than normal staking yield, does the meth actually trade at a premium on secondary?
00:29:41.554 - 00:30:07.234, Speaker B: Yeah, it does and it should. Not a huge thing. It's not like Ust where I remember when Luna had to kind of cap the supply at I think 10 million a day, there were times where I had to buy terra, like 1% high, like quite a bit higher. So that did deep. And we have a little bit of that on secondary. Yeah.
00:30:07.354 - 00:30:10.534, Speaker C: Arbitrageurs are going to fill that quickly, you'd assume then, right?
00:30:11.474 - 00:30:47.980, Speaker B: You know, with these staking, minting things, you know, sometimes because there's like a withdrawal a few days here and there, it's not a smooth operation to do. I don't think it's juicy enough for a ton of like, arbitrage to happen at this stage, but maybe, maybe it will get. I mean, it's obviously going to become a billion dollar asset very soon as we open this up. I've seen that there's, you know, Stargate has announced they're going to be shooting meth into other l two s and into the stratosphere, so we can get the aliens addicted on meth as well.
00:30:48.172 - 00:31:30.472, Speaker A: Unrelated note, or maybe not too related, but like, what do you guys think about Eigen Lair? Like, actually, because I feel like the 8th narrative, it's not as good a money as bitcoin, and it's less performance than other high throughput chains. So it's kind of stuck in this middle. And Eigen layer, potentially, aside from the ETF, is the only narrative that can propel ETH potentially higher. I dropped off, I dropped a $20 billion figure earlier. But if Celestia is at 17 billion, why can't Eigen be at 20? What do you guys think about Eigen layer? How are you going to trade the launch, if any? And do you have any quote unquote valuation targets?
00:31:30.528 - 00:32:09.882, Speaker B: Potentially I am more bullish Eigen layer than Celestia for many reasons. I think it's a clear long one, short the other. At some point, if you can, if you get that ratio going, the trad five people that are in crypto, they seem really excited about it. First of all, that's a good sign. You want potentially new money that loves this narrative and understands that potentially it aligns with something that they see about the real world and how it can play out. So that's good. When it comes to just the data availability, I think Eigen Lair has that.
00:32:09.882 - 00:32:39.074, Speaker B: When it comes to the ecosystem that they've built and potential airdrops and things like that, I think it's very strong. The tech is clearly, you know, Giga Brain, great founder, spoken with him. Just seems exactly like the kind of guy like, you know, that you want. So I do think that that will likely be one of the most bullish things to hit ethereum in a very long time.
00:32:39.454 - 00:32:43.646, Speaker A: Do you know when it's going to launch, Justin? I know you're more in touch with it than I am.
00:32:43.670 - 00:33:12.896, Speaker C: I've heard Q two or Q three is a good bet, but I don't have any inside info there. I've been. I have a ton of eigen layer points. I was in one of the first tranches that opened up and have just sort of left my ethan there. Um, I wish I put more. And obviously now, in retrospect, when I made that original spreadsheet, I think my FTV target was 4 billion, and it was a massive airdrop. And now, to your point, tyke, with the celestia comparison, and, like, it being even more bullish than that, you know, I wish I had sort of gotten all in there, but, um, it is what it is.
00:33:13.050 - 00:33:19.620, Speaker D: I wish I listened to Justin when you pointed out. I remember thinking, I heard 4 billion. I was like, there's no way this guy's a moon boy.
00:33:19.772 - 00:33:21.676, Speaker A: But now it's probably going to be.
00:33:21.700 - 00:33:51.404, Speaker D: Much, much more than that. I wish I just followed you in. Yeah, I'm super bullish Eigen layer as well. I think a lot of CT money is very short sighted and can't be patient enough. Just want me for two months for the middle pump. They all think they can time it, but I think it will be a really bullish narrative for ETH. I'm trying to find tokens to, like, altcoins to, like, play it, but, like, there's nothing clear than just ETH itself.
00:33:52.144 - 00:34:03.524, Speaker B: I think some of the restaking tokens, potentially, I guess they don't really exist yet, but, like, things like etherfi, maybe. Maybe some of the theta stuff I need to look at more.
00:34:04.684 - 00:34:06.064, Speaker A: Restake your lips.
00:34:07.364 - 00:34:07.876, Speaker B: Gotta get.
00:34:07.900 - 00:34:11.244, Speaker A: Waiting for my airdrop still, just to touch on that.
00:34:11.364 - 00:34:29.028, Speaker C: Last week I shared the chart of, like, you know, the best day to sell your airdrop is five days in. And that actually played out perfectly with alts. But Taki told me not to listen to it, so I didn't. And now I'm just holding onto my airdrop. Taki was like, you shouldn't listen to that. It's just an average sell when it makes you comfortable. I didn't.
00:34:29.076 - 00:34:31.990, Speaker D: Best time to sell it is right before another token launches.
00:34:32.132 - 00:34:34.214, Speaker A: Oh, right, right. That makes sense.
00:34:34.594 - 00:34:51.482, Speaker B: I think that was a bit too much. Alpha thicky shouldn't have shared that one. We're not supposed to say that one out loud. No, it's true. It's like, what's the. What's the kind of, like, casino of the week? And then, like, when there's a new casino that we got. I shouldn't have said that either.
00:34:51.482 - 00:34:54.666, Speaker B: We're sharing too much today. It's okay.
00:34:54.730 - 00:34:56.174, Speaker D: Big of Brad to edit it all.
00:34:57.694 - 00:35:13.542, Speaker B: But think you have to say, like, everything you're saying sounds so much more sophisticated now. You know, you don't have, like, the kimono Fiki today. You guys have, like, the spectacled, you know, nice hair, button down fiki. Not the sunburnt, you know, went to.
00:35:13.558 - 00:35:31.790, Speaker C: The beach and tank top for the audience. You know, we're trying to boost thicky's ratings, so we put glasses on him. We fixed his shirt up because after last week, he got, you know, quite a bit of a hate in the week before that for just being so bearish on the ecosystem over the next six months. So we gotta lose. It's in the comments section.
00:35:31.982 - 00:35:33.598, Speaker D: Oh, shit. I gotta read those comments.
00:35:33.726 - 00:35:59.244, Speaker B: Well, let's move maybe to pasta of the week. And I think we have some juicy ones this week. Maybe for once, I'll kick off. So I saw bold Leonidas. This guy, if you're not following him, he's just, like, such a cartoonist for the space. Just grateful the culture. He always has these inside jokes and just, like, really good imagery as well.
00:35:59.244 - 00:36:27.598, Speaker B: So, yeah, he's kind of reflecting upon all the controversy around Jupiter. And he has a character here asking, so how much Jupiter did they keep? Did the team keep? And the cat says, yes. So, yeah, we're not going to get any clear answers. You know, just. Sure, yes, I think this was a brilliant cartoon. And congratulations to bold Lanitis for getting. I think he got third or fourth place in the meth meme contest.
00:36:27.598 - 00:36:33.486, Speaker B: As well. So he won a few thousand dollars there. Wow. Let's look at the keys.
00:36:33.670 - 00:36:46.638, Speaker D: I think it's like, this is kind of touches on what Jordy was saying earlier. Our timeshare. Air drops. Air drops create good times. Good times create pauses. Pauses create hard times. All this wealth effect let people get greedy.
00:36:46.638 - 00:36:54.214, Speaker D: They leverage up, and then that's when the hard times come again. But right now, we are enjoying the sort of fruits of our laboratory in the tough bear market.
00:36:54.634 - 00:37:39.414, Speaker B: I have to say that this is something that the people trying to at least hit the right curve should reflect upon. There's definitely a signal in here. Some of the smartest and most successful investors, though, they don't even consider any of this at all. I've seen interviews with Ansem, with Santiago. These guys are the most prolific, uh, people on podcasts, and obviously very successful, very intelligent guys. Whenever they get asked a question, I remember, like, taiki, you asked the ansem, and I've seen other people ask Santiago, you know, why? Why do you think this thing is worth 5 billion instead of 10 billion or whatever? And it's always relative value. They're like, well, you know, it's almost as good as this thing.
00:37:39.414 - 00:38:04.334, Speaker B: And if that's eight, then they should be, like six. And it's never, like, fundamental or any first principles or any tethering anywhere. No tethering. It's just a purely, well, that's, you know, if Jupiter is like one inch, but it's more like this, then just put it there, and then we just add this stuff on, and that's okay. And it does well. People can perform extremely well in the markets, and they do. These guys are, like, performing extremely well.
00:38:04.334 - 00:38:09.174, Speaker B: I just wonder, like, at which point some of those assumptions start to break.
00:38:09.634 - 00:38:12.268, Speaker C: Does it work on the downside, Jordyn?
00:38:12.268 - 00:38:13.834, Speaker B: On the downside? In what sense?
00:38:14.574 - 00:38:30.934, Speaker C: Well, we've always been talking about in the bullish case, where it's like, if Tia is worth 16, then Eigen layer is 20. But does it ever work? If someone does a project that raises the valuation of a certain category, it's going to get pulled down eventually by this logic.
00:38:31.054 - 00:39:09.982, Speaker B: I mean, there's certain categories that don't perform very well in terms of getting whatever premiums are out there. There seems to be a huge layer one premium. If you're a layer one, you just get, like, a different valuation, even if it's the same product, because you're not considered beholden to a larger master of, like, a chain. You know, it was interesting with Jitto and Lido, some people successfully surmised that. It just doesn't make sense, given the relative market caps, for Jito to be bigger than Lido's market share and put on a relevant trade. I think Hal might have spoken about that a little bit. Sometimes the category is kind of weak.
00:39:09.982 - 00:39:35.934, Speaker B: Like with most of the perp Dexs, apart from DydX, it's sometimes hard to break out of that $1 billion range. We've seen it on a few small occasions. I think Apex has gone above that took two, 3 billion, although it's quite a low float. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But sometimes the category can. Can kind of bring things down a bit more.
00:39:36.354 - 00:40:00.414, Speaker A: Yeah, and this is what I was talking about earlier. It's like in bull markets, you want to bet on new category leaders with no relative comps. Because how do you compare Eigen layer to anything where Celestia to anything? You really can't. Maybe you compare it to ethereum or something, but, I mean, no one actually knows. So if it two x's from here, it's like, yeah, why not? That's kind of how people think.
00:40:01.184 - 00:40:08.004, Speaker B: It's like that Jim Carrey thing. It's like, maybe. Maybe Brad can bring it up. He's like, so you're telling me there's a chance?
00:40:08.824 - 00:40:11.044, Speaker C: So you're telling me there's a chance.
00:40:14.624 - 00:40:19.104, Speaker B: Yeah, like, as long as there's. There's nothing to kind of cap it.
00:40:19.184 - 00:40:19.496, Speaker A: Get.
00:40:19.560 - 00:40:41.084, Speaker D: Gets people really excited. Yeah. I think something I really learned this bull cycle is, like, if you're the top of your best in class, essentially you get, like, a really sick premium. Like, if some protocol is generating, like, 1 million of revenge two, then, like, 132 is going to be like four or five. Six x 121.
00:40:42.064 - 00:40:43.208, Speaker A: I think this is due to just.
00:40:43.256 - 00:40:53.822, Speaker D: Because, like, there's just too much money chasing these narratives. And it just, like, ends up centralizing on the best sort of token each class, like Celestia or Solana or Jupe, for that example, that matter.
00:40:53.878 - 00:40:54.902, Speaker B: It's a power law.
00:40:55.038 - 00:40:56.314, Speaker D: Yeah, power law.
00:40:56.814 - 00:41:07.474, Speaker B: Justin, I think I'm kind of loving this bits and pieces of these online games. I'm seeing these on chain games. Maybe you can share your pasta and tell us a little bit about that.
00:41:07.934 - 00:41:34.398, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I'll share my pasta, and then I'll talk a little bit about the game I've been playing, too, after. So we could do a little degenerate of the week and pasta of the week just for me. And maybe that'll increase my chances. Of winning this round again for two rounds in a row. So I guess this meme is a little less relevant with Jupiter. But Mike Dudis put out this meme of Drake saying no way to a crypto app people might use, but a roll up is a surface with some shared sequencing, liquid restaking platform.
00:41:34.398 - 00:42:02.870, Speaker C: Now, that's a token that will do well. And this just really sticks with me because in our space, these l ones, to your point, Jordy, they have this premium, but there's still no apps on them that are really differentiated. We're not really seeing that sort of innovation get built on the app layer where people are coming back to use something on chain every day. And it's just really interesting. Like, people are investing and taking the picks and shovels approaches. Like the gold miners. We're going to sell them picks and shovels.
00:42:02.870 - 00:42:09.670, Speaker C: We're going to sell people this infrastructure, and hopefully the apps will get built later on. So, pretty interesting. And hits home.
00:42:09.742 - 00:42:29.364, Speaker B: I mean, it's all about the keywords right now, getting like, ticking all the narratives. If you want to get really bullish, I saw this a few days ago. You can go to the. There's a project called Layer N on Ethereum. Oh, yeah, their website. They have done a master. Like, it just has, like, so many keywords and they were positioning in all of them.
00:42:29.364 - 00:42:34.424, Speaker B: It's. It makes you really bullish. So people. People check.
00:42:35.084 - 00:42:56.704, Speaker A: I saw that. It's like. It's like this new L2 using. Sorry, Eigen da with like 100,000 tps on testnet. You know, this is like the modular thesis leveraging Ethereum for settlement and eigenda for data availability. This is a Monad competitor. I have no idea, to be honest.
00:42:56.704 - 00:42:58.636, Speaker A: It's like, oh, 10 billion ftb.
00:42:58.740 - 00:43:02.436, Speaker C: It's like no one knows what it does, but it's provocative and it gets the people going.
00:43:02.580 - 00:43:08.886, Speaker D: No one knows what it means, but it's provocative. No, it's not. Get people going, look. Look at.
00:43:08.910 - 00:43:13.030, Speaker A: Look at that thing. What is that? It's like. I don't know how to explain this.
00:43:13.142 - 00:43:14.034, Speaker C: It's cool.
00:43:15.654 - 00:43:19.310, Speaker D: It's going to be interesting to keep.
00:43:19.342 - 00:43:20.754, Speaker B: An eye to see what's going to happen.
00:43:21.094 - 00:43:38.248, Speaker C: I'll share this game I've been playing because people are sort of interested. I know people really like when we show doing on chain. So this is something I did this week. I'm playing with a few friends. It's sort of like survivor, but for crypto. So you deposit like 0.1 ETH to get into the round and then every day there's an immunity challenge to get your tribe.
00:43:38.248 - 00:43:52.832, Speaker C: I'm in the orange tribe. You can see in the bottom left immunity. If you don't get immunity, someone has. You have to vote someone out of your tribe. And you can see, you know, there's a ton of different crypto users. Everyone links their twitter, so you sort of see who's in it. There's some notable people in it.
00:43:52.832 - 00:43:53.684, Speaker C: That's cool.
00:43:54.024 - 00:43:58.920, Speaker B: But what is the tribe win? The unity? Like, how do you get it for the whole tribe?
00:43:59.112 - 00:44:25.224, Speaker C: Yeah, so you can see here, you know, I actually played this at the start of the show. I don't think we recorded it, but, um, there was a pac man challenge and basically the trap the tribe with the highest score collectively on pac man. It's like, say, 20 or so people in a tribe there, they get immunity for the. For the day and don't have to vote anyone else. Everyone else, they have to go to the voting polls and presumably, like, the people that perform worst in these challenges get voted out. So I was on the show with you guys. I performed pretty bad.
00:44:25.224 - 00:44:47.666, Speaker C: I'm ranked, like, almost dead last or in the bottom five, so I might get voted out, but if not, hopefully I'll stick around and next week I can give an update on how I'm doing. But basically the winner gets the entire pool. So maybe 600 people bought in with 0.1 ETH. The company takes or the protocol takes a 10% fee and the rest of the ETH gets sent to the winner. So pretty cool. Fun, and it's nice doing something new.
00:44:47.850 - 00:45:35.006, Speaker B: I have to say, I'm very bullish on this category because I come from a very strategy games background. I love this stuff. I think crypto social, bit of money, gambling, it just fits in perfectly. I have seen a few decks for games like this based on werewolf, based on other stuff. I think it's hard to get the mechanics right. But, you know, if I had, like, unlimited time and I wasn't as busy as I am, I would love to just get some game mechanics and do these kind of game theory, multiplayer tribes and, you know, like you're talking about. I'm already thinking, like, do I want to vote the worst player on my team off? Because that'll make my team better, but then, like, it makes it more likely that in the future I'll be the one voted off of my team because, you know, I'll be the one lower down.
00:45:35.006 - 00:45:45.030, Speaker B: So do I actually go for the, go for the top guys and get them out of the way. I don't know. It's really fun, and it's hard to get these things right. But it's interesting.
00:45:45.222 - 00:46:03.620, Speaker C: It's social, too, because, you know, you see these crypto personalities. Jesse Pollock, the founder of base, and then jason Rosenthal, who's at a 16 z. And you can see, like, my team, the orange team, we were deciding who to vote for between these two. And, you know, jesse's like, well, don't pick me. Vote this other guy. So it's, it's just fun, and it's social. And I agree.
00:46:03.620 - 00:46:04.564, Speaker C: I'm bullish on these things.
00:46:04.604 - 00:46:23.856, Speaker B: Jordy becomes a bit of a popularity contest, I think. We, we like base, so we like, we like the base maybe a bit more, but that's awesome. I'm curious to see how it goes. And more games like this, please. And hopefully when I ever take a vacation, I'll be able to play as well. Taiki, what do you got?
00:46:24.000 - 00:46:53.864, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, I kind of blew my load earlier, but, you know, I'm just perpetually stuck in this mid curve. You know, I'm tears coming out of my eyes. You know, I want to be in the left curve, but I'm really trying, you know, like, I, no bridge to sauna. I'm into this nft, you know, I'm, like, trying out these non evm chains and, you know, trying to, you know, not, not be stuck in maker, but, you know, I'm still stuck in a mid curve, you know, this is my question.
00:46:54.024 - 00:47:11.064, Speaker B: What is, what is, like, the alien right curve? Gigabrain taiki, like, what is he, what is he buying? What is he into? Can you tell? Like, if you imagine transpose yourself into that state instead of maker and Kanto, what are you into?
00:47:11.364 - 00:47:44.104, Speaker A: I think. Okay, so this is what I'm trying. I'm really trying to bet big on the modular narrative. So that's going to be like Celestia dimension Eigen layer. I'm not sure about alt layer, to be honest. I don't really see how value cursed alt layer, but because there's no other pure ways to bet on an eigen, I have this working thesis where maybe the dimension to Celestia ratio is going to be similar to the alt layer eigen ratio, and that might be how these tokens end up trading.
00:47:44.264 - 00:47:52.004, Speaker B: I mean, we're saying there's no way, but aren't these points trading on whales markets and some of this stuff you can just bet on the point value?
00:47:52.984 - 00:48:09.664, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, alts trading at 3.5 right now. Yeah, 3.5 billion dimensions at, like, four. So, yeah, I mean, they're. I think they're going to both trade in tandem, but I'm trying to focus more on, like, neuro coins, because neuro coins. Good.
00:48:09.664 - 00:48:25.528, Speaker A: And I think because no one really knows how to value these things, I think there's more edge to be had. So I'm just, like, spending all my time right now, like, focused on trying to understand, like, the modular narrative and which coins wind up, like, becoming big winners.
00:48:25.696 - 00:48:39.296, Speaker B: Well, I think, taiki, normally, you would have a winner on your hands, but because you kind of blew it. Blew it a bit early, we hope you enjoyed it earlier in the show. I don't know, Thiki, we have to vote, right?
00:48:39.320 - 00:48:45.224, Speaker A: We have to vote. I like thicky's one. I liked it. The virtuous cycle.
00:48:45.344 - 00:48:52.478, Speaker B: It pains me, but I think for me, Justin, maybe again with the double entry. Double entry.
00:48:52.526 - 00:48:56.686, Speaker A: You did do a double entry. Yeah. That's a good point. He went above and beyond.
00:48:56.870 - 00:49:01.594, Speaker B: Thank you. You're the tiebreaker between myself and Justin.
00:49:05.854 - 00:49:07.434, Speaker D: I'm sorry, Justin.
00:49:10.974 - 00:49:20.336, Speaker B: Okay. Justin has voted for himself. So this is the first tie. We have a. We have a tie. Justin, Justin and thick. Each.
00:49:20.336 - 00:49:24.844, Speaker B: Each self voting, and me and Taiki.
00:49:25.504 - 00:49:30.284, Speaker A: Well, if it's a tie, then I think Justin wins because he did a double entry.
00:49:33.384 - 00:49:34.904, Speaker C: Yeah. She penalized.
00:49:35.064 - 00:49:36.480, Speaker A: Oh, right, right.
00:49:36.672 - 00:49:39.728, Speaker D: Comment below. Comment below what you guys think.
00:49:39.816 - 00:49:40.224, Speaker B: Okay.
00:49:40.264 - 00:49:40.992, Speaker D: Comment below.
00:49:41.128 - 00:49:50.154, Speaker B: We'll look at the comments, and we'll choose the winner based on that, and we'll announce it next week. Thanks, everybody, for joining. I hope you had fun this one, and we'll see you next week.
