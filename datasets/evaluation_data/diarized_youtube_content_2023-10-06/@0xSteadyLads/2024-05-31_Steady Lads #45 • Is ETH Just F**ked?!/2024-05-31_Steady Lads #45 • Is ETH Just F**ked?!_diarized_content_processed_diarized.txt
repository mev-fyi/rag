00:00:00.400 - 00:00:13.350, Speaker A: Well, mainnet is so cheap, we don't need l two s anymore. It's this weird paradox. I'm serious. Think about how much uniswap cost at seven gas. It's like single digit dollars. Like maybe even less. I should check.
00:00:13.502 - 00:00:14.134, Speaker B: Go for it.
00:00:14.214 - 00:00:33.694, Speaker C: So parasitic that, like, these l two s are stealing all the value cruel. And they're emitting like billions of tokens a year. It's just like a huge drag on eth price in multiple ways. Of course, all the core devs get allocations and all these protocols, they're just like double dipping, you know? So it's like, it's like, what's going on? Like, is eth just f.
00:00:54.934 - 00:01:15.074, Speaker B: All right, welcome to episode 45 of Steady Lads. Jordy is jet lagged as hell, so I'll be leading this podcast today. So we got Justin, the CEO of Astaria, Jordy, CEO of Salemi Capital, and Thiki, he's actually here today. How are you doing, thikki? You don't look so well right now.
00:01:15.614 - 00:01:21.546, Speaker C: I'm doing well. I was kind of tired. It's a bad angle, so it's.
00:01:21.610 - 00:01:47.340, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely a bad angle. So, you know our, I've been reading the comments section and it seems like people have been complaining that Thiqi has been a little bit absent today or in the past couple of episodes. So, Justin, if you can share my screen, I have a little question for Thiki in the live stream we did last week, actually, let me just play this clip and think you can kind of go over what actually happened here.
00:01:47.412 - 00:01:55.348, Speaker A: And then I think the ETF actually launched. Trading started, and inflows for the first couple of weeks were pretty disappointing. And I think bitcoin went back down.
00:01:55.396 - 00:02:14.384, Speaker B: So a lot of you in the comments section was actually commenting on thickie. I mean, it looked like he was taking a thickie, right, thinking a dump here. And then I think like 20 seconds later, he just like left the shell. So like, what, what was happening there? Like, what exactly was going through your head?
00:02:15.984 - 00:03:01.474, Speaker C: So I was like, really long EPTC, because I was event trading the ETF approval. And I think at that time, EPTC was just getting kind of shrek. And we've been holding these podcasts the middle of the trading day, which is middle of the US hours, which is like, was not an issue when we started the podcast last year, before the ETF started trading. But ever since, you know, the ETF started trading, there's been a lot more action concert in us hours. And this past month especially, I've just been like, I've always been caught in bad positions while the podcast is happening. So I either have to, like, skip it or, you know, hop off mid pod, just like, you know, as you saw last week.
00:03:02.694 - 00:03:03.374, Speaker B: Are you putting.
00:03:03.414 - 00:03:10.044, Speaker D: So I guess your sizes that are like, massive, like, compared to what you normally do, like, is it uncomfortable?
00:03:10.704 - 00:03:14.720, Speaker C: Last. Last week's was definitely uncomfortable. I took it all off. I'm out of it.
00:03:14.792 - 00:03:20.576, Speaker A: I'm done with Ethan.
00:03:20.640 - 00:03:22.856, Speaker B: Everyone's done with these, but thinking we.
00:03:22.880 - 00:03:36.656, Speaker A: Saw, thinking we saw. You know, you shared a little bit about your p and l in the private steady lads chat and it looks like things are going great. So how done with youth can you be? Was it all from shorting ETH BTC or what happened?
00:03:36.760 - 00:03:56.644, Speaker C: It was all from longe, Justin. Yes, but I'm done with it. I think it's played out. I think everyone's long ETH now and I don't think. I don't think tradfi is that interested in buying in the short term. So I think the cross was going to, is going to pull back even more. It already has from where I exited, but I think it's going to pull back even more locally.
00:03:57.504 - 00:04:25.826, Speaker B: Wow, that's a hot take there. So, I mean, right now, if you can pull up the e PTC chart, Justin, we're at 0.055 and we did put in a God candle, but we are pulling back a little bit, actually. Let's go around the steady labs. Like, what do we think happens to ETh or this particular ratio, let's say, in the next two months, end of July? Where do you guys think it will be trading at? Let's start with Justin, the eth maxi.
00:04:25.970 - 00:04:52.528, Speaker A: Yeah. So on the note of ETH BTC, I saw this Suzu tweet which actually really resonated with me pretty strongly. He said, I don't think people are actually mad at Ansmur celebrities. They're mainly mad that ETH didn't break out past 4k despite ETF approval and solace firm yet again. I was also momentum, momentarily mad at this, but I've recognized that it is bullish for Seoul. This is pretty interesting. So, I mean, Eth Sol etH, right, did go down like 25% ish.
00:04:52.528 - 00:05:18.102, Speaker A: But I think there's something to be said here. We're not seeing the reaction out of ETH that maybe we would have expected. I do think inflows could be a little lackluster thinking, to your point. I mean, it seems like the market has just cooled off in general, this isn't the new shiny thing like the BTC ETF was? Although I do think it's still, like, incredible news in the long term. You know, I think it might take a while for the market to react. So I'm not expecting, you know, massive flows that send ETH BTC back to 0.075 anytime soon.
00:05:18.238 - 00:05:21.958, Speaker B: So you think lower than 0.055 in.
00:05:21.966 - 00:05:32.376, Speaker A: Two months, or give us a number in two months? I'll say 0.0620.062. July 30, 0.062. Yeah. All right.
00:05:32.400 - 00:05:33.524, Speaker B: How about you, Jordy?
00:05:34.344 - 00:06:26.124, Speaker D: Look, when it comes to ETH BTC ratios, I think that each isa has different downsides and different risk returns. So the probability of different things happening over, like, six months or a year is different. And with ETH, I don't think you need to compare it to other assets. You just need to compare it with itself and think about if the price is a good bet or not a good bet. It's not about underperforming. It's more. Is this pound for pound a good risk reward? And with ETH right now, even though you guys are bearish, I think given an ETF is coming and the market's generally good, we should see at some point over the next months, all time high push doesn't make sense for ETH not to at least try to push towards an all time high when Ethan ETF flows are live.
00:06:26.124 - 00:06:45.044, Speaker D: So bitcoin might have a good return profile as well, and there might be reasons while it overperforms or underperforms. But I look at them as completely separate assets, and even though there's a correlation there, I think it's worth holding both, and that's how I'm doing it.
00:06:45.624 - 00:06:47.244, Speaker B: So give us a number, Jordy.
00:06:47.544 - 00:07:18.994, Speaker D: I don't know. I mean, the ratio really depends on how BTC does independently, like what national. What national sentiment is. Like what, like, companies and sovereign wealth funds decide to buy bitcoin. It could be all over the place. I just think that ETH is still a good risk reward, and I don't see us falling below three k, which was when the news came out. And so there's not that much downside here.
00:07:18.994 - 00:07:30.078, Speaker D: And on the upside, I think we should be able to, on some euphoria of good flows, like, imagine if, like, we get, like, two, three days of good flows. Like, we should break all time highs pretty quickly.
00:07:30.206 - 00:07:35.878, Speaker B: Nice, nice. How about you, Vicki? What do you think about ET BTC in the next couple of months?
00:07:36.006 - 00:08:59.414, Speaker C: Well, I definitely want to. I think I want to debate Jordy on his point, because I feel like, okay, I mean, I feel like the ratios are important in determining where, like, the marginal dollar is flowing in. And like, you know, usually if, if money flows into bitcoin, then, like, you know, Sol and ETH will both go up just from like, correlation. It can either be just like algo is doing it systematically, or it can be just people being like, oh, wow, bitcoin's going up, go buy Sol and ETh. But, you know, I, if, if the market thought that the ETF flows on ETH would actually do well, and if there is actually a lot of outside money waiting for these ETF's to buy ETH, then I don't know why ETH BTC wouldn't just grind up straight into the launch of the ETF, which is what the bet I was taking look, like that was the bet I originally took was like, BTC is just going to keep grinding up because it's going to follow the same fractal as BTC did into its BTC launch. But the fact that it looks like ETH is stalling out and the marginal dollar isn't coming into ETH, it's coming to bitcoin instead. Makes me start questioning like, do people actually care about an ETH ETF?
00:08:59.534 - 00:09:33.178, Speaker D: Does that actually drive the concept of a marginal dollar? I think is, is not really applicable. There's different sources of dollars and I think Bitcoin has its own different sources, and ETH has its own different sources. And the reason why I told you when you had that position, it's like a risky position. It's not like ETH is not going to do well. I just think at any given point, I would never be short bitcoin. There are so many random things that can happen to the bitcoin distribution where some adoption, some large adoption happens specifically for bitcoin. And, you know, it's a different asset.
00:09:33.178 - 00:09:50.814, Speaker D: Um, when you're long ETH BTC, you're implicitly short bitcoin. And I just can't imagine it ever being a good idea to be short bitcoin. So that doesn't mean anything about how ETH is going to do, it's just a different return point. You have this like, right tail where you just get wrecked by being short bitcoin.
00:09:51.434 - 00:10:18.524, Speaker C: I mean, I guess like the, for me, the BTC thesis relies on, like, ETh being superior store value to bitcoin. And there's so much cme oi that's been added. There's around 10 billion of CME OI that easily can just rotate from bitcoin into ETH and speculate on the ETH ETF, just like they did speculate on the bitcoin ETF into the bitcoin launch. And the fact that that isn't happening is kind of like a bad sign to me.
00:10:18.944 - 00:11:10.522, Speaker D: I mean, you're basing things on, like, a week or a few days of trading. And I think we've always kind of been surprised how things kind of bounce across certain levels sometimes and reposition quickly. Like with Solana, over the last weeks, there's been so many times where it looks like it's going to break out, and then it just, like, massively underperforms everything else. I think we're kind of being stuck in this range. So, you know, my point about Solana is the same about the other ones. It has its own return profile, where the downside is maybe capped at around 100 or 110 or whatever all those funds bought at, because they're not going to puke for loss easily. On the other hand, the upside might be capped because they have so much to take profit on over the next years.
00:11:10.522 - 00:11:36.644, Speaker D: And so many funds have done those deals now, and they've absorbed the latent demand that there was for liquid. So. So you have to look at each, um, return profile. It's all, it's all a bit different. And with e specifically, it's totally tell. Um, I think, like, one day can change everything. So I'm going to be on GCR's camp and, uh, and just hold both.
00:11:37.664 - 00:11:48.144, Speaker C: No, you're right. I think one day can, like, this eth is very, very illiquid. And, like, if one guy wants to buy Eth, he can just push the ratio up 5%, like, in an hour if he wants to.
00:11:50.124 - 00:11:55.904, Speaker D: Justin, can you pull off a Michael Saylor and just start a eth microstrategy?
00:11:57.164 - 00:12:18.944, Speaker A: I'll do my best. That's not a bad idea. But I saw even Michael Saylor capitulated a little bit. I don't know if you guys saw that clip, but he was saying it's not just bitcoin anymore. He was saying that all of these other tokens are becoming more legitimate, that are making bitcoin even more legitimate. And he sort of recognized that there was a world out there aside from bitcoin, which was interesting.
00:12:20.004 - 00:12:26.548, Speaker B: I do think, like, this cycle, there's going to be, like, the Eth of Michael Saylor. I long thought that it was Mark Cuban.
00:12:26.596 - 00:12:26.780, Speaker D: Right?
00:12:26.812 - 00:12:29.500, Speaker B: He, like, just sold a part of the Dallas Mavericks.
00:12:29.532 - 00:12:31.460, Speaker A: He's been turns out, it's Donald Trump.
00:12:31.652 - 00:12:33.452, Speaker D: Well, you know, I mean, you don't.
00:12:33.468 - 00:12:35.864, Speaker C: Think it's Richard hard and Justin son.
00:12:36.884 - 00:12:41.308, Speaker D: Is Richard, like, out and about and buying stuff.
00:12:41.436 - 00:12:45.316, Speaker C: He bought $600 million of Eth in March or Feb.
00:12:45.340 - 00:12:47.548, Speaker A: In March to stake an eigen layer, right?
00:12:47.676 - 00:12:49.628, Speaker C: Yeah. Oh, no, no, that was Justin's son.
00:12:49.716 - 00:12:50.892, Speaker A: But Richard.
00:12:51.028 - 00:12:53.740, Speaker C: Yeah, he just got it all into eth.
00:12:53.892 - 00:12:58.420, Speaker D: What did, what did he sell? Like, his pulse crap. Like, all that. All that.
00:12:58.572 - 00:13:12.078, Speaker C: He had a ton of dye, and, like, after he. He basically, like, burned his dye to buy eth. Right. And that's when makers started freaking out and they're like, oh, we're going to lose all of our die. We have to go up our rates so that we don't lose it all.
00:13:12.276 - 00:13:33.434, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I specifically remember, like, last year when I was, like, just bowled up on maker. One of the bull cases was Richard Hart owns all this die that he can't move. So, like, those die can't be redeemed. And all the treasuries backing that die, it's going to go into buybacks. But I guess, you know, he dumped that die. Then maybe, like the.
00:13:33.594 - 00:13:39.454, Speaker D: There's like a jail headline for Richard Hart. You're just kind of like Max long maker. That's the place.
00:13:40.434 - 00:13:42.474, Speaker B: That's like the most mid curve thing to do.
00:13:42.594 - 00:14:20.894, Speaker A: I think it is interesting that the Trump piece and also biden, right, like, this political shift we've seen seems to be more targeted and more ETH aligned. Like, the political shift seems more ethaligned than it does seem anything else aligned. I think the eth was a big. Is a big point to that. And then also trump selling a bunch of NFTs on Ethereum holding ETh. Just think it's interesting how these two tokens have always been political in our ecosystem, and now they're becoming political outside of our ecosystem, and alliances are forming. So I wonder if one day we'll have a presidential election that's, you know, x coin versus y coin, right? Like a candidate aligns himself with one coin and another candidate picks the other coin.
00:14:21.354 - 00:14:33.804, Speaker D: I mean, the ratio of, like, Trump to bowdoin is, is a much better ratio to trade because they have, like, similar return profiles. And that's a good one to, to try to navigate, maybe.
00:14:33.964 - 00:15:03.294, Speaker B: Yeah. Speaking of those coins, I do want to share this screenshot. So I saw this screenshot on Twitter when the whole Trump news happened and Bowdoin just started pumping, Trump started just dumping. But if you actually look at the chart now, it fully reverted or went to the upsides. Trump is now pumping, if you can see the screen, and then bowdoin. This chart is like, very, very bearish. It's just like full retraced.
00:15:03.294 - 00:15:24.894, Speaker B: What do you guys think about these political coins? I guess, like the whole super or the meme coin super cycle thesis is that everything is going to, every real life event isn't to be traded and people are going to make these meme points. Are you guys buying Bowdoin or Trump or Trump or MAGA or any of these meme coins or. How do you guys think about it?
00:15:25.754 - 00:15:48.442, Speaker A: Well, several months ago, when Jordy first introduced Trump to me as sort of like a hedge against missing Bowdoin, I bought it. And I think I'm just going to hold it through the election. It's been pretty flat or maybe up like 30% or so. But when Jordy was talking to us about the relative value of buying Trump versus bowdoin, that thesis made sense to me. So I'm a small holder of Trump.
00:15:48.618 - 00:16:08.186, Speaker D: I mean, whenever the election happens, someone's going to lose, and then the losers coin is going to fade into obscurity because, you know, let's say Biden loses. Like, he's not going to be in the news at all. And so that coin, like, loses all its value, more or less. Is there. Is there anyone who disagrees with that? Or is that like a pretty understood. Is there anything.
00:16:08.210 - 00:16:17.674, Speaker A: I completely. I completely agree. I mean, that makes sense to me. But I also think that's very. That's taken a very long term perspective. I mean, for all we know, these things might not even be around come November.
00:16:17.714 - 00:16:28.846, Speaker C: But personally, I think if Trump wins, then Bowdoin's going to sell off and then Trump's going to go up and then they're both going to sell off right after the election.
00:16:29.030 - 00:16:37.794, Speaker D: I'm not sure. I think whoever stays in the news will have a chance to ride for the next few years, and then whoever loses is just going to go to zero.
00:16:39.574 - 00:17:23.001, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess. On the topic of meme coins, I mean, we all. I mean, you know, Justin shared the tweet earlier about Suzu, and there's been a lot of discussions happening around celebrity meme coins. I think Iggy Azalea, or whatever her name is, and Caitlyn Jenner dropped. I'm not really cultured here, but I just thought it was pretty funny. There's so much anger on the timeline and we don't have to talk about this, but even this post where I guess the ZK sync team is now trademarking the ZK, you know, I guess like that word. So if anyone launches any project with the ZK in it, then they can technically trademark or copyright infringer and whatnot.
00:17:23.001 - 00:17:42.293, Speaker B: Everyone is just so mad, and I literally just think that it's because everyone still owns ETH and it's not pumping. Vicki, I think you were actually in a Twitter spaces with one of these celebrities. What was your takeaway from these spaces? Are they actually trying to enter crypto or are they trying to scam people?
00:17:42.674 - 00:18:07.014, Speaker C: I think it's just like the 21 cycle where, you know, they all go into these NFTs is like, you know, for them, it just seems like an easy way to make a quick buck. And just depending on how whoever they partner with wants to run things, like, it's probably just gonna be like, they'll probably go to zero, like, pretty quickly, and they'll maybe pull out, you know, 500 grand, maybe a couple million, but, yeah.
00:18:07.934 - 00:18:17.542, Speaker D: Is it true that there's, like, this one? Whatever, dude, that indian guy, whatever. I don't know what he is, but he's, like, the one behind the scenes making all these celebrity coins for them.
00:18:17.678 - 00:18:21.514, Speaker C: I think he made a couple, and he got, like, pretty infamous for doing it.
00:18:22.214 - 00:18:48.150, Speaker B: Yeah. I personally know someone from Eva Labs, and I think their general counsel has some tea on him, and I think he's gonna probably get sued and whatnot. Justin, if you can share my screen. I mean, you know, these celebrity meme coins, I mean, maybe, you know, one of them is going to, like, actually be a net positive, this space, but at the end of the day, they all just going up. They all just go to zero. And like I said, I only think people are talking about this, and the.
00:18:48.182 - 00:18:58.894, Speaker D: Best coin is, is that it's a dead coin. So Kevin Hart's confession is dead, but it's. It's only down 76%. So someone hasn't sold that last 24%.
00:18:59.054 - 00:19:07.794, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's it. That outpouring bitcoin right on the way down. So maybe that's a better store of value than most of this. Most of these coins.
00:19:08.254 - 00:19:18.326, Speaker D: Are you taking a side on this sticky. Like, I saw that there's been a little bit of Zack XBT versus Ansem on different, different points of view. You know, I think Ansem's right in that.
00:19:18.350 - 00:19:48.642, Speaker C: Like, it is pulling in outside money into the space, and they're probably going to lose all their money, and it probably, you know, continues to give crypto, like, this sort of rep of being a scam. I thought this was going to be marginally bullish soul, and it was a tiny bit, but I think it's a fade now. But, yeah, I mean, not doing much on. I haven't been following this too closely.
00:19:48.778 - 00:19:51.934, Speaker D: Justin, you like to try everything. Are you trying this stuff?
00:19:54.814 - 00:20:18.454, Speaker A: This is one, you know, I don't know what it is. I think, like, maybe I just need a break. But for, like, the past three months, I really haven't been trying that much. I don't know if it's that nothing's excited me, but it's, like, so hard to get on board with these coins that, you know, are scams. Right. Like, and you're just, it's purely just, you're playing a money game, right? Like, who can get in first and who can get out first. And, yeah, I've avoided it so far, but I'm sure it's a lot of fun.
00:20:18.454 - 00:20:26.704, Speaker A: It's just know I like to try things where there's, like, airdrop potential or potentially new tech involved and whatnot and just. We haven't seen that yet.
00:20:27.764 - 00:21:00.470, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, is it me or, like, I feel like it's so easy to get jaded right now. I log into Twitter and everyone's just talking about celebrity coins or, like, ZK patents, and I know, I feel like the vibes have been off for so long. Maybe it's because ETH isn't pumping, but, like, how do you guys, like, how do you guys remain optimistic in this space? I just feel like every time I log on Twitter, I'm just like, what am I doing here? How about you, Justin? You're building. How do you just remain optimistic, Justin?
00:21:00.502 - 00:21:27.078, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like there's something else going on that's not just about price, because ETH is almost at $4,000 bitcoins, basically at 70 at the time of recording or a little lower. We're basically close enough to the all time highs that we should all be pretty happy. And all of us that held out through the bear market should be pretty happy. Like, from a. If we're just talking about price, but that's obviously not the case, clearly. Like, people are frustrated when I think, like, the majority of people are in profit now. So I think.
00:21:27.078 - 00:22:03.548, Speaker A: I think it honestly, it's a side effect of, like, our space devolving into more, like, leading more into the money games stuff than actually, like, adoption and innovation. I mean, like, it's easy to get disillusioned with the tech right now because we don't have anything to get too excited about right even if you're really in the weeds, there's no new narrative that's coming that people are hyped about. Like, Eigen lair came in when there's not really new projects that are launching that people are extremely excited about. So I think. I think a lot of us are bored in the space. And when we're all playing the same game again and again, which are these like money games with meme coins, it just gets more and more hostile. Right?
00:22:03.636 - 00:22:40.906, Speaker D: And so, yeah, it's similar, but different take. I've noticed that each category has a lot more competitors than it used to. And I think that's why, you know, there's like, constant taking of teams. And you're seeing it even on the VC side. Like, all the VC's are like, oh, you're not doing due diligence. Like, what kind of DD do you do on, like, the VC's are doing their game because they're all trying to raise from the same, like, pool of money, you know, same institutional and allocators. And then like, just take any space, like even the, you know, you have layer zero and bridges.
00:22:40.906 - 00:23:17.916, Speaker D: And I thought it was just going to be axelar and wormhole, but now they got this across bridge arguing with them on who is like $0.05 cheaper and 8 seconds. And there's like, argument with our last guest, primo, about, you know, are people gonna prefer waiting five minutes and paying like half or waiting 10 seconds and then like paying full price, like, which one? And they're arguing about like, which one is a better. And then on the restaking side, I mean, you have like, you know, six different projects entering that category. On the staking side, on eigen layer side, there's so many eigen layer competitors now. And I think it's just the game has changed. There's more builders that have been attracted.
00:23:17.916 - 00:23:54.864, Speaker D: At this point, we're at saturation level. Paradigm has changed their game. They're like realizing that they should be backing full competitors early. So, you know, oh, instead of just letting Eigen Lair take that lane, we're just gonna back a completely different team. And I think that's why the vibes are deteriorating. And when you see something like the ZK token, you know, they felt like somebody stepped on their shoes by trying to beat them to the punch. And polyhydra, I guess, was it that took the ZK ticker before them? And then they're just like, well, we're the real zks.
00:23:54.864 - 00:24:20.824, Speaker D: We're like, get out the way. We just smash you. And it seemed to have worked because they forced them to change the ticker. So they are the big guy in the room, but then you have everyone attacking them, starkware, which is another competitor in their space, and they're like, oh, you guys are not being. Going along with the ethos. So I think it's just too many firms building in the same verticals.
00:24:21.524 - 00:24:43.704, Speaker B: Yeah. And there's so many new tokens. Right. Paradigm is backing the Eigen layer competitor called symbiosis. And I just thought, like, Lido is gonna, you know, create some risk taking product, but I guess there's gonna be a new product, the new token. It's just so many damn tokens, like, thick yet. I thought you were, like, trying to talk.
00:24:43.704 - 00:24:45.264, Speaker B: What were you gonna say?
00:24:45.604 - 00:25:20.264, Speaker C: I mean, if you want to pull up, like, a chart of just stable coins they topped on April 20, and they basically have been flat for the past month. And, yeah, I agree with you guys that I feel like, you know, when, when the pie stops growing, everyone just gets increasingly, you know, minus three, minus three. And I think that's what's happening with the vibes. Like, there really is not much new money coming into the space. It's all rotational. And like Jody said, they're all, like, fighting for the same pool of capital on every vertical. All the projects fighting for the same users, all the VC's are fighting the same lp's.
00:25:20.264 - 00:25:29.034, Speaker C: You know, it's just like, it tends to do that when things stop growing. So, yeah, it's not very surprising to me, and it matches up with my sort of macro view in crypto.
00:25:30.014 - 00:25:41.314, Speaker B: And your macro view is that there's hundreds of millions of dollars of altcoin emissions and the fair price is zero, and the only reason to buy them is for catalysts. Right?
00:25:41.934 - 00:25:53.334, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think the casino always has to take a rake, and that's supposed to be offset by an increase of stable coin supply. And because it's been flat, then, like, you know, the rake's a lot more noticeable.
00:25:54.034 - 00:26:10.014, Speaker A: Do you guys think, like, on that note of price being flat and sort of choppy for a while now, sentiment being terrible, stable coin inflows slowing down, like, are we potentially in a bear market? We just don't realize it yet, and it's sort of like setting the stage for another massive run up in the cycle.
00:26:10.674 - 00:26:11.298, Speaker C: No.
00:26:11.426 - 00:26:15.094, Speaker D: Have you forgotten what it was like in the actual bear market already, Justin?
00:26:15.434 - 00:26:22.164, Speaker A: I mean, we could. We should look back 40 episodes ago, but we were cheery and jolly. We're talking about the tech.
00:26:22.784 - 00:26:56.692, Speaker B: Remember 2022 like, there was like a period where there's like twelve straight red weekly candles of ETh. Like, that was so painful. Like, like, I was like, after the 6th red candle, I was like, okay, surely this one has to be green. And then that continued on for like a month and a half. I don't think things can get much, things can go much worse, or things can get, like, much worse than that. But do you guys think this, like, how would you characterize this market? Is it like, is it like a technical bull market? Is it like a vibe? How would you characterize this market? Let's go with, let's say, jordy.
00:26:56.868 - 00:27:51.756, Speaker D: I think it's going to be a protracted bull market that has choppy periods and the flows will keep coming in on the majors. And of course there'll be some winners on the altcoin side. But, yeah, I mean, ultimately, everyone's going to compete over the same sources of underlying value. I mean, we saw Athena did so well on basis, and now there's like 80 products trying to do basis. You know, Jupiter is the one that I'm kind of waiting to see who's going to, because, you know, everyone in the Solana ecosystem was kind of playing nice and they let Jupiter maybe run away with it, even though they're trying to do perps and they're trying to do aggregation. Everything else. I'm curious to see who's going to go for that huge pie because I think the thing is still trading at like over 1010 billion ftB, so someone's going to go after that as well.
00:27:51.756 - 00:28:02.664, Speaker D: Bottom line, I think this market, I would characterize it as a bull market that is rhyming, but not the same as the last one.
00:28:03.464 - 00:28:36.590, Speaker B: Yeah, it kind of feels like a market where bitcoin and ETH is in a bull market and people are just waiting for the altcoin pump that will come at some point, but it just never comes. And it's only happening in like, meme coins. It's like very selective, I guess a big dispersion in performance. And as an eight bull, it's pretty painful. I mean, that being said, holding ETH has been pretty good, etc. Has been weak. But I've gotten so much airdrops that maybe the real value of EBTC is.
00:28:36.702 - 00:28:42.950, Speaker A: Slightly higher and the 3% staking yield. Do not forget about yield.
00:28:43.142 - 00:29:26.346, Speaker B: Yeah, this is Tyke and Justin's coping. This is holding Eid. I was also thinking, I use a chain pretty often because I farm and stuff, but I'm just like airdrop farming. I'm just bridging to l two tokenless l two s restaking with like LRT's or Eigen layer. Like when's the last time you actually use a chain for like a non farming use case? You know, like an actual use case, like whatever, however you define that to be. I feel like if you take out like the non bot transactions on chain, like, you know, those transactions, I feel like 90% of the transactions are people like just airdrop farming or like punting meme coins. There's like nothing really to do.
00:29:26.346 - 00:29:28.734, Speaker B: You know, like, you know, the one app.
00:29:29.034 - 00:29:59.290, Speaker A: The one app I've been spending a good bit of time now that's actually pretty interesting is polymarket. They've just like, I don't know when everyone last looked at it, but like the app has just gotten so much better progressively. And I really think they earned that funding round, but I think they're just dominating in the prediction market space. It's actually really encouraging to see that's one place where crypto adoption has really taken off with normal people. It's the most liquid presidential betting market. There's also a ton of crypto native stuff that people are betting on. There's farming potential airdrop farming.
00:29:59.290 - 00:30:04.786, Speaker A: So I've been using polymarket quite a bit. Honestly, that's off of the polygon chain.
00:30:04.930 - 00:30:14.734, Speaker D: How do the fees work? I'm curious because I used to trade fed fair quite a lot back in the day and they just take, I think, 5% of the net winnings at the end. How does polymarket take a fee?
00:30:15.114 - 00:30:19.574, Speaker A: I actually don't know. It's a good question. I suppose that's bullish for their business model.
00:30:20.604 - 00:30:23.212, Speaker D: Have they settled your eth eTF money?
00:30:23.268 - 00:30:37.764, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, yeah, that was, you know, within hours, actually. They had resolved that to approved and I got paid out, claimed my stables. Really smooth. I mean, the user experience is really smooth. Like depositing is as smooth as using bovada. Withdrawing is even better.
00:30:37.764 - 00:30:39.784, Speaker A: They've, they've really been crushing it.
00:30:40.404 - 00:30:42.424, Speaker B: You got like a twelve x on that, right?
00:30:43.244 - 00:30:52.604, Speaker A: I averaged it, I bought in at then my average price was $0.10. So like, yeah, about 1010 x humble Justin.
00:30:52.644 - 00:31:02.980, Speaker D: But yeah, take a look at the fees and maybe tell us next time. Because as a trader I'm always maybe like sensitive to understanding what, what the casino cut is.
00:31:03.132 - 00:31:16.264, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. They're all, they're also incentivizing liquidity providers too. So if you're like providing bid side or ask side liquidity, they are providing USDC incentives. And presumably there's some airdrop there. So maybe that's a good opportunity for folks.
00:31:16.724 - 00:31:30.468, Speaker C: You know what I want to ask you guys about why? Why is, why is Gwei so low? ETh moved up 30% and like, we still minted 10,000 eth over the past week. What's going on?
00:31:30.556 - 00:31:32.900, Speaker A: And gas is at seven right now. I just checked.
00:31:33.012 - 00:31:34.144, Speaker C: It's so low.
00:31:36.644 - 00:32:03.964, Speaker A: It'S hard to imagine that it's really like the l two adoption we've all been praying for for the past few years. Like, of course, l two growth is insane. Like, those charts are actually staggering. Taki, I don't know if you have any of those handy, but the amount of addresses, track transacting on base optimism, etc, etc. Is mind blowing. But yeah, it's still very concerning that gas on Mainnet, where the majority of economic value should be settled is so low. I definitely think it's a concerning signal.
00:32:04.464 - 00:32:14.256, Speaker C: EtH is a ghost town. Eth mainnet is a ghost town. No, everyone's looking off. Soon there will be no, no dapps on eth l one. They all have their own app chain.
00:32:14.440 - 00:32:33.168, Speaker A: Well, Jordan and I talked about this, right? With like, eth decide with 40, 44, eth cannibalize their own business, right? Like, they dropped the cost of l two s that settled to Ethereum, and then they push all the apps and development off of Mainnet. And so now the business model for Ethereum is definitely in a tricky spot. But it's been interesting to see how.
00:32:33.256 - 00:32:49.674, Speaker D: The exact timeline at which the gas dropped off was when the l two s, you know, ten x, improved on their under fees. So I do think it's related to that. I actually use eth main net a lot every day. And yeah, I'm happy for whatever reason.
00:32:49.834 - 00:32:51.934, Speaker C: He'S a good taxpayer.
00:32:53.314 - 00:32:54.498, Speaker B: He is paying rent.
00:32:54.586 - 00:33:07.670, Speaker A: Well, mainnet is so cheap, we don't need l two s anymore. It's this weird paradox. I'm serious. Like, think about how much uniswap cost at seven gas. It's like single digit dollars. Like maybe even less. I should check.
00:33:07.822 - 00:33:08.262, Speaker B: Go for it.
00:33:08.278 - 00:33:20.514, Speaker C: Don't you think it's so parasitic that, like, these l two s are stealing all the value accrual and they're emitting like billions of tokens a year. It's just like a huge drag on eth price in multiple ways.
00:33:21.294 - 00:33:21.942, Speaker B: Of course.
00:33:22.038 - 00:33:29.874, Speaker C: Core devs get allocations and all these protocols, they're just like double dipping, you know? So it's like, it's like, what's going on? Like, is eth just fucked?
00:33:30.634 - 00:34:12.146, Speaker D: It doesn't need to be a drag, right? Like those tokens can just get rotated back into their eth pair as they get sold. And then we've talked about this. But ultimately the bullish case for eth is not the fees, but it's the community money. Like if all these l two s are using eth as like the base currency for everything, then it sort of becomes a good alternative to bitcoin for certain communities. That's, that's much bigger pie. And I think that's the only way that Eth goes stratospheric. Otherwise, if it's just a tech stock with, you know, I've said the PE of ETH before and it's, I can't remember exact number, but I think it's like 100.
00:34:12.146 - 00:34:15.738, Speaker D: So as a PE ratio, purely on the fees. It doesn't make sense.
00:34:15.866 - 00:34:20.134, Speaker B: Wait, wait, Jordy. Like, what do you use Eth mainnet for? This is just curious.
00:34:22.213 - 00:34:45.213, Speaker D: Definitely for like swapping a lot. So I still use, you know, cow swap or one inch or I guess like lp into uniswap. That's still where all the payments are happening. People just, just want main net money. Yeah, I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff I can't. I mean, it seems like there's still a lot of uses for Mainnet.
00:34:45.373 - 00:34:54.774, Speaker B: Yeah, me personally, like, all I've used Mainnet for is to claim airdrops and to bridge to tokenless. And we'll do that's, that's like all I use Mainet for.
00:34:57.794 - 00:35:15.594, Speaker A: Tykee. I think you're conflating a little bit about like the lack of things to do on mainnet with just like aetherium specifically. There's, it's just, there's not much to do in general. Like, I don't think it's an Eth mainnet problem. Like, I'm pretty confident in saying. I think like, the next big app apps will still continue to be in the EtH ecosystem. We just don't have them yet.
00:35:15.714 - 00:35:29.328, Speaker D: I mean, chow would disagree. He's like in the pump fun. He's in the fantasy top. All this stuff. I mean, that stuff, making of money. And maybe it's not going to last, but that's use cases, right? Like fun, fun stuff like that. Like random stuff.
00:35:29.376 - 00:35:34.416, Speaker A: Fantasy top is on blast and. Yeah, pumped up fun in Solana, of.
00:35:34.440 - 00:35:42.480, Speaker D: Course, but yeah, but like, the concept of like, those apps, are they not real use cases?
00:35:42.552 - 00:35:57.930, Speaker A: I put them. No, they're real and they're fun. But I put them in the money games category where it's like a new way to gamble and speculate. So it's real. It's just not, it's like nothing new under the sun, right. To get people, like, to get people coming back into the space and excited.
00:35:58.002 - 00:36:41.584, Speaker B: Yeah. And to double click on what thikki said earlier, I was actually actually listening to like a debate with Justin Bonds and some other guy, and he was actually talking about like exactly what you said, thicke. It's like, if you're like a smart dev, it's like, why would you work on Eth Mainnet and get paid a salary by consensus? Like, why not just work for an l two, get a token and just dump that token and just retire? So there's always this incentive to never work on Eth Mainnet and just keep working on these new l two s. And then there's new tokens being printed every single. In the next couple of weeks, there's gonna be Zksync. I honestly have no idea what they're gonna do because that chain is only sybils. It's really sad.
00:36:41.584 - 00:37:04.994, Speaker B: And then maybe in like Q three or Q four, there's gonna be like Tyco and like scroll. And then, you know, that's gonna add 10 billion ftb at least to everything. And then that's gonna be a ghost town. So I guess there is also like this perverse incentives where if you're like a smart guy, like, you just create a new project and, you know, like the base chain, like doesn't really improve that much.
00:37:05.374 - 00:37:32.384, Speaker C: Yeah. My concern about ETH is like, I feel like it's already lost the casino narrative to Seoul. And I don't think it's ever going to come back. And the only thing it depends on is sort of tradfi adopting this as a global store value. And because, I don't know, because proof of stake is superior to proof of work. It was my thesis. And I don't know, I still feel like there's lack of, basically apathy from tradfi is not a good sign for ETH.
00:37:32.384 - 00:37:53.814, Speaker C: It might not be for eight years until we have two more halvings. When bitcoin actually has a threat of getting 51% attacked. That like, that rotation to ETH actually happens. And in the meantime, it just bleeds lower because it has just like worse sort of demand by the crypto natives than Solana.
00:37:54.754 - 00:38:02.626, Speaker A: But what about the thesis that big institutions will use Ethereum as a settlement layer like we've seen with the Blackrock build biddle fund?
00:38:02.770 - 00:38:12.422, Speaker C: I think it's possible. But, like, unless directly translates into them buying ETH, if they're just burning, like, tiniest amount of fees, then it doesn't really matter too much, right?
00:38:12.478 - 00:38:14.350, Speaker A: At seven kwei, how much does it matter?
00:38:14.462 - 00:38:15.554, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:38:15.894 - 00:38:34.214, Speaker B: Yeah. It's just a narrative, right? And maybe Larry Fink shills, like, the ESG and tokenization narrative, but I guess, like, that's kind of what we. What we hope for. I feel like the entire crypto community is, like, cheerleading, glaring. It's like, please show our bags. And that's kind of the state of the market right now.
00:38:34.334 - 00:38:42.194, Speaker C: Yeah. How do you guys think Eth even gets shilled to a boomer? Like, a one liner for ETH? If bitcoin is digital gold, like, what is eth?
00:38:42.574 - 00:38:44.942, Speaker A: You can build any application on top of it.
00:38:45.078 - 00:39:05.762, Speaker B: It's like the digital. It's like the new Nasdaq. But then Solana can also get that narrative, too, right? So it's not specific to eTh, but I guess it's, like, the most Lindy, safest, environmentally friendly, more dgen. You know, if bitcoin does well, then people eventually rotate to ETH. Eventually, who knows? Maybe there's, like, a 60 40 type of market cap weighted, bitcoin eth like.
00:39:05.938 - 00:39:09.734, Speaker D: Product that I think you guys are.
00:39:10.354 - 00:39:11.722, Speaker A: We need some hopium Jordy.
00:39:11.778 - 00:39:36.958, Speaker D: Yeah. You know, we'll see different things come up. I think the AI category and finding a way for blockchain to be, like, a key component of that is entirely possible, even though it was dismissed initially. The only thing I'm not bullish on is the from Ethiop launch. And you can. You can. You can click here, maybe Taiki, and see what the room is like here in Austin, where we.
00:39:36.958 - 00:39:41.234, Speaker D: Or I am right now. Yeah.
00:39:44.614 - 00:39:49.274, Speaker B: Damn. That's, like, all five of Starknet's users. They're all there.
00:39:51.534 - 00:39:53.834, Speaker A: Is. What is Prometheum journey?
00:39:54.174 - 00:40:03.934, Speaker D: This is the. The exchange that's gone, the regulated route. And, oh, yeah, attack everybody else and be like, we're the compliant ones.
00:40:05.394 - 00:40:14.194, Speaker A: We need some hope in, though. We can't. We can't. Like, everyone's gonna. Everyone says we're too depressing. We need, like, some opium, you know? Yeah. Like, you've seen.
00:40:14.194 - 00:40:20.054, Speaker A: You guys have seen those comments. Like, these guys are always bearish. Like, if you listen to them, you'd be down. You miss the whole.
00:40:21.294 - 00:41:05.650, Speaker B: I mean, the thing is, I think we're all bullish to space. It's just that, for me, I entered a space last cycle, and when I used Aave for the first time. I was like, oh, my God, this is amazing tech. And then four years later, if you ask me, in 2020, what would the space look like? I would have expected it to grow, advance much further. And I think there's, like, that disappointment as well within the crypto natives. And yes, you know, we are making money. Bitcoin eth going up and air drops, you know, I mean, the thing is, like, you know, people getting, like, four or five figure airdrops, like, that's still, like, crazy, right? I think someone said, like, you know, you can actually just make a living off of just farming airdrops.
00:41:05.650 - 00:41:33.464, Speaker B: So the space is pretty. Yeah, the space is, like, insane if you think about it that way. But I think people just have these expectations, and people look back to last cycle and the all season and, like, the pumps that we've had, and I think people expect that this time around and it just hasn't happened. And then everyone's just, like, so angry and so upset. And that's kind of the result of, I guess, negative vibes and us being, you know, kind of jaded.
00:41:33.764 - 00:41:35.024, Speaker C: I'm pretty bearish.
00:41:38.324 - 00:41:42.208, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm pretty bullish.
00:41:42.376 - 00:42:03.444, Speaker D: But if you guys are so, so down and you need to cheer up, get a. Get a pudgy. I mean, look at this news. Now they're even going to release mobile games. So after all the Walmart target stuff, there's. There's more stuff in play. And now that I'm a member of the pudgy community.
00:42:03.444 - 00:42:07.584, Speaker D: Oh, there we go. Is it. Do you. Do you own that one tike?
00:42:08.364 - 00:42:09.864, Speaker B: I did, then I sold.
00:42:14.164 - 00:42:15.052, Speaker A: Buy that back.
00:42:15.108 - 00:42:19.468, Speaker D: You're not allowed to hold that anymore. You gotta, like, burn it, dude.
00:42:19.516 - 00:42:34.706, Speaker B: Like, no, like, I bought this. I bought this when I was farming blur at, like, 40. And I was like, yo, like, I'm gonna buy this. And then it became, like, 13 eth. And I'm like, this thing is worth, like 40, 50k. Like, this is crazy. I just sold.
00:42:34.706 - 00:42:47.374, Speaker B: I'm not gonna be the bag hold. I'm not gonna have this bag holding mentality. I'm probably gonna be canceled by the pudgy community. But I still have this. I will buy back eventually, but what am I gonna do with this?
00:42:47.994 - 00:42:49.802, Speaker D: That was such a good one, too. You had a nice.
00:42:49.858 - 00:42:51.534, Speaker A: Is that a rare penguin? Yeah.
00:42:52.394 - 00:43:09.642, Speaker B: No, it was a common. I spot the floor. I think I set a bid, and this got dumped into my bids. This is actually, like, my. One of my best trades because I got, like, the blur airdrop, and, like, I got all the pudgy airdrops, too, and I just dumped them all.
00:43:09.698 - 00:43:16.814, Speaker D: Or do you need to go to the discord and, like, do something to get. To get the airdrops? Or does it just come to your wallet?
00:43:17.394 - 00:43:29.854, Speaker B: You just have to claim it, you know? And I'm sure there's gonna be other pudgy airdrops as well. I'm sure this clip is going to be, this video is gonna be clipped, and I'm gonna be. I'm gonna be trolled at some point, but.
00:43:32.514 - 00:43:44.254, Speaker D: Layer zero one yet. I'm pretty sure our last guest is gonna give something, something to the pudgy community, and hopefully the snapshot is. Is recent, because I've only got it recently.
00:43:45.474 - 00:43:48.058, Speaker A: Is it too late? Jordy? Can I still buy a penguin?
00:43:48.226 - 00:44:19.390, Speaker D: I don't know. I don't know. I don't think they're gonna be able to tell us. I've noticed that actually, like, the teams and the founders are getting pretty serious about not revealing any kind of points criteria. You know, hyper liquid is definitely one that has been surprising people often with how they've been doing things and changing it up. And I think internally, they have a very strict policy of not being able to act on that. And maybe we can bring up some of the tweets.
00:44:19.390 - 00:45:05.114, Speaker D: Taiji from hyperliquid. But that was the other drama recently, is that they actually announced that they will be having a new points season, even though it was supposed to have ended the beginning of May, and the game just goes on. They're going to airdrop for all of May, even though it was supposed to be kind of done. And here we go again. So another four months. Apparently, there were mixed reactions. I think some people were pretty happy that they're expanding their vision to doing a little bit of what Monad is doing, I guess becoming a generalized l one with some unique changes to the EVM.
00:45:05.114 - 00:45:37.244, Speaker D: On the other hand, there's a lot of comments. If you can scroll down. There's some people saying, you were the chosen one. What have you done? We're, like, done with points. So, yeah, we see Hasaka saying, we had a good thing, and there's a lot of this, ain't it? So, yeah, you were the chosen 1550 likes. You know, that's quite a reaction there. So I think the community is unsure about this.
00:45:38.184 - 00:46:00.634, Speaker B: Well, if you look at the price of per, if you can share my screen, it's approaching all time highs. So I guess if you're a per holder, you're happy. And I guess it's because if the points program is extended and maybe there's more incentives to hold per because, you know, if you hold per, you get air jobs and points, and, I don't know, maybe it's not that bad. You know, like, maybe it's not that bad.
00:46:01.214 - 00:46:05.514, Speaker D: Let's do a pasta. Maybe. I'm pretty excited.
00:46:06.254 - 00:46:11.934, Speaker B: Let's do a pasta. How about you, Justin? You can go first. Even on a. On a roll lately?
00:46:12.954 - 00:46:41.684, Speaker A: Yeah, I have. Although I lost out to Brian last week, so I've got another feature from Evan. Evan's one of my big picks. I keep picking him. He's just puts out banger tweets, but he has this BTC maxi, quote, tweeted, the BTC Maxi said, you all are about to understand why securities regulations exist and why reporting requirements are a thing. Because consensus is about to sell their 70% pre mine on ETh. And Evan, quote, tweeted that and said, consensus.
00:46:41.684 - 00:47:12.836, Speaker A: Consensus finally succeeded in the ten year long con of checks notes getting an ETF approved. They will now proceed to dump everything. This is not a drill. Just hilarious take from, like, this is just like classic bitcoin Maxi cope that thinks all other tokens are scams. Just this idea that, like, a theorem has been one continual scam for, like, the past ten years, that nothing's actually been built, that it's all been, like, a fraud. And now is finally the time when consensus and all the insiders get to dump. Absolutely hilarious.
00:47:12.940 - 00:47:14.556, Speaker C: How much east do they have?
00:47:14.740 - 00:47:15.744, Speaker B: Consensus?
00:47:16.844 - 00:47:18.704, Speaker D: I think it's less than Justin sun.
00:47:19.724 - 00:47:20.228, Speaker C: Really?
00:47:20.316 - 00:47:22.740, Speaker B: You think so? I thought they hold more.
00:47:22.932 - 00:47:24.236, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought they had more.
00:47:24.420 - 00:47:25.884, Speaker B: Like Joe Lubin at least has.
00:47:26.004 - 00:47:30.120, Speaker A: You know, I think it's unknown how much Joe Lubin has, but it is, like, a decent amount.
00:47:30.252 - 00:47:32.080, Speaker D: Decent. You know, a decent.
00:47:32.272 - 00:47:36.648, Speaker A: I think it's under 1%, though, right? It's like three quarters of a percent. Not positive, though.
00:47:36.736 - 00:47:40.004, Speaker C: Of all the eth. It's like almost 4 billion.
00:47:40.824 - 00:47:41.604, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:43.744 - 00:47:50.044, Speaker B: No, he's. He's winning. Um, speaking of winning, uh, how about you, Dickey? Like, what's your pasta this week?
00:47:51.024 - 00:47:52.720, Speaker C: Um, that's a good question.
00:47:52.832 - 00:47:53.344, Speaker D: What.
00:47:53.464 - 00:47:55.120, Speaker B: What is that white stuff on your face?
00:47:55.152 - 00:48:00.424, Speaker D: Dude, he's about to get burned on his pasta. So he's getting.
00:48:02.644 - 00:48:36.884, Speaker C: So Tarun published his paper on an analysis of intent based markets. If you scroll down, you can see the original picture where it's like. It's like the trolley problem, but, like, mixed with the Monty hall problem. Or was it monty hall or monty python? Yeah, Monty hall and this guy just quote me and, like, mixed the trolley problem with it. Just put some bodies on there. It's like, you want to run over eight people to get a Ferrari, or do you want to run over two people to get a goat? I thought it was so funny because it's so reflective of.
00:48:37.904 - 00:48:44.232, Speaker D: That is amazing. That is a fantastic tweet.
00:48:44.328 - 00:49:00.444, Speaker B: Yeah. And this is the true intent based market. You know, just stealing from others to get a lambo. This is crypto or, like, scanning two people's eyeballs to buy a goat. World coin.
00:49:01.664 - 00:49:03.724, Speaker A: Still waiting for my world coin. Airdrop.
00:49:05.984 - 00:49:29.100, Speaker D: You know, I was excited. I thought I was going to have a chance, but that's pretty epic. But I do have a couple killer ones from Gordy. Gord, who has just been, like, knocking out the banger is crazy. But he tweeted today, I hope this judge weighs the fact that Trump promised ongoing utility to his NFT holders in his sentencing. So that's. That's a good take.
00:49:29.100 - 00:50:01.438, Speaker D: And then I have one more from Gord. He says, I have no problem. If Iggy Azalea launched an l two with native yield, at least then I'd know she's trying to push pace this face forward. It's always, like, very crypto native tie into, like, the happenings of the day that. Yeah, very entertaining. And maybe we should get Gordy on the show. I think Gordy has his own podcast, so we should try to get him on.
00:50:01.606 - 00:50:16.272, Speaker B: Yeah, that'd be funny. All right, I guess I'll go last with my pasta. And, you know, I guess this podcast called study lads and. No, recently we found out that 100% of our viewership is men, if you can.
00:50:16.328 - 00:50:17.192, Speaker D: That true?
00:50:17.368 - 00:50:20.884, Speaker B: 100%. 100%. I mean, the data don't lie.
00:50:21.224 - 00:50:25.124, Speaker A: No, I know it's false. I know. My mom watches every episode religiously.
00:50:26.144 - 00:50:28.856, Speaker B: Okay, we have one. Maybe a lot of emails in the.
00:50:28.880 - 00:50:30.640, Speaker D: Comments that said that they watch it.
00:50:30.752 - 00:50:31.484, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:33.444 - 00:50:37.964, Speaker B: Real. Yeah, maybe you wouldn't understand, but, you know, they're real.
00:50:38.004 - 00:50:42.544, Speaker D: The top. The top signal is when one woman watches the steady lads podcast. That'll be the top.
00:50:43.004 - 00:50:44.148, Speaker B: Justin's mom watches.
00:50:44.196 - 00:50:52.564, Speaker D: Is that the top? I think moms don't count if it's relatives, you know, they're expected to support. We need a non mom female, and we can.
00:50:52.604 - 00:51:07.364, Speaker A: We can update the audience as we go. The second we see that tick to 1%, I think one is a little bit, you know, too bearish. But if it hits 1% and it registers on the YouTube charts and the YouTube algorithm, we should then we got to blast that out to the world and tell everyone to sell.
00:51:08.464 - 00:51:14.352, Speaker D: Hi, Justin's mom. Can you get some friends, by the way?
00:51:14.448 - 00:51:15.056, Speaker C: I have.
00:51:15.160 - 00:51:20.584, Speaker A: Yeah, you've worn it. I still got to send you. I've got the strap, like, an extra strap it came with and, like, all this shit.
00:51:20.664 - 00:51:29.374, Speaker B: I see. So I guess the eat etf that Justin got a pudgy. Think you gotta watch. And Justin gets one eth. Is that the settlement?
00:51:29.874 - 00:51:32.290, Speaker C: Justin's getting an e? I don't know about the pudgy.
00:51:32.482 - 00:51:37.370, Speaker A: An Ethan against. Are you gonna rug him an Ethan? A nice, thoughtful gift.
00:51:37.562 - 00:51:41.346, Speaker C: 35 grand Tyche do.
00:51:41.370 - 00:51:42.814, Speaker B: We saw your p and l man.
00:51:43.154 - 00:51:44.074, Speaker C: Oh, my God.
00:51:44.154 - 00:51:50.606, Speaker A: Can I just get an Ethan a nice, thoughtful gift? I don't care about the. It could be a card for all. I care, but an Ethan and then something thoughtful.
00:51:50.770 - 00:51:51.782, Speaker C: Course, Justin.
00:51:51.918 - 00:51:52.742, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:51:52.878 - 00:52:01.622, Speaker D: All right, so I. I mean, I feel like Vicki's right. It was a right curve pasta. But I personally like that. I know you guys.
00:52:01.718 - 00:52:05.878, Speaker A: I like tikes. I think it was insightful, sick, astute and thoughtful.
00:52:06.046 - 00:52:09.126, Speaker D: The female is going to be the top. That's the.
00:52:09.230 - 00:52:10.394, Speaker A: Yeah, the 1%.
00:52:10.814 - 00:52:11.422, Speaker D: Okay.
00:52:11.518 - 00:52:14.994, Speaker B: All right. I guess the female is the top. That's the.
00:52:15.454 - 00:52:22.914, Speaker D: That's the winner. Okay, back to live episodes so we can let the viewers choose.
00:52:23.804 - 00:52:26.784, Speaker C: Maybe we don't know the winner until after the episodes aired.
00:52:28.044 - 00:52:29.464, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, that's true.
00:52:30.484 - 00:52:33.268, Speaker D: And do a Twitter poll. Twitter poll.
00:52:33.436 - 00:52:35.876, Speaker C: If you got a farm, that engagement on study lads Twitter.
00:52:35.980 - 00:52:41.864, Speaker D: So we should. We should the video of the pasta of the week and then have them. Have them vote on Twitter. That makes sense.
00:52:42.244 - 00:52:42.956, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:43.100 - 00:52:48.838, Speaker B: This is up an episode. Any final words, guys? Any. Any lads? Any lads with the final word?
00:52:48.956 - 00:52:55.330, Speaker D: Thanks for. Thanks for hosting Tyche. And. Yeah, let's rotate the lads over the next couple of weeks.
00:52:55.442 - 00:52:59.506, Speaker B: All right. Rotate the lads. All right, thank you, guys. And I'll see you next week.
00:52:59.690 - 00:53:00.354, Speaker A: Thanks, Tucky.
