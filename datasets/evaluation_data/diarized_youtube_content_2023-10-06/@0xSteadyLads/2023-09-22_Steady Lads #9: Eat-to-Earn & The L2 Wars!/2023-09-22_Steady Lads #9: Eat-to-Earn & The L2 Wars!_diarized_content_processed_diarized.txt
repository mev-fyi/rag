00:00:20.440 - 00:00:31.466, Speaker A: Welcome to another episode of steady lads. The lads have been traveling around. There's been a lot of activity. Just like, we're starting to see some activity in the markets. I think Thiki is you're in Dubai.
00:00:31.610 - 00:00:32.854, Speaker B: I am in Dubai.
00:00:33.794 - 00:00:35.894, Speaker A: What's your experience there?
00:00:36.594 - 00:00:44.066, Speaker B: It's been nice. It's kind of hot, but all the amenities are very nice. I've just been chilling in the hotel room the entire time. Kind of half trading.
00:00:44.210 - 00:00:50.654, Speaker A: Half trading. Is Sumitra capital gonna make it, or are you guys close to any liquidation levels?
00:00:54.174 - 00:01:11.782, Speaker B: It's hard to say. It's hard to say. Made some good bets. I actually went Max short at 25k on a bunch of alts. Like, the shortest I've ever been in my life. And we managed to, like, we managed to short the right thing so that, like, after the pump, it. We didn't get killed too much.
00:01:11.782 - 00:01:13.934, Speaker B: But, yeah, it was a bit brutal.
00:01:14.054 - 00:01:23.566, Speaker A: It's choppy out there. It's rough markets. Justin, you've been doing less djen things lately. I hear you're doing a real, real world Asset summit.
00:01:23.670 - 00:01:37.886, Speaker C: Yeah. So I flew to New York. I'm still here right now. Two days ago, there was the real world Asset summit that centrifuge and some other partners put on. Really interesting that there were a ton of institutions that came. JpMorgan was there. They just launched JPMorgan coin.
00:01:37.886 - 00:01:42.030, Speaker C: There were a few other institutions that launched their own private blockchain.
00:01:42.182 - 00:01:46.758, Speaker A: So what is JP Morgan coin like? Is this a stable coin from my.
00:01:46.806 - 00:02:26.654, Speaker C: No, it's just their private blockchain platform where they're going to use to send, I think, client funds, um, more quickly than traditional or else, from what I understand. I think city just announced they're doing something similar. And it was really cool because at the conference, there were, like, two factions of people. There were, I would say, like, the crypto native folks and, like, builders and people I knew in my network there that were, like, publicly calling out these, like, private permission blockchains and saying, like, this is just a database. Like, this doesn't make any sense to build on blockchain. And then you had the other half, which were, like, super excited about this. And I think I'm somewhere in the middle where, like, I'm happy people are, like, experimenting with the tech, but private blockchains are kind of silly, as far as I understand them, at least.
00:02:26.654 - 00:02:32.250, Speaker C: But it was a good time. Tyke and I met up in person, too, in New York here. We had a great time together.
00:02:32.322 - 00:02:37.090, Speaker A: So, Tyke, did you get Justin into your eat to earn app. You were telling us last time.
00:02:37.202 - 00:03:08.794, Speaker D: Yeah, so there's this new app called Blackbird, which is like an eat to earn app. And I told Justin about it a couple weeks ago, and he lives in California. He fault the FOMO, and of course, he came to New York for the real world Asset Summit. But I think also part of the reason he came out here was so that he can eat to earn. And it's a pretty novel application. I don't think that many people know about it, but it's trying to be this customer loyalty or, like customer retention, like customer lifetime value app, where every time you dine in, you get some tokens. And the restaurant, they also get some tokens, too.
00:03:08.794 - 00:03:34.040, Speaker D: And this was a company founded by Ben Leventhal. So, yeah, I've been, you know, farming this pretty aggressively in the past couple of weeks. I've been dining into vietnamese food restaurants. And this is the founder, Ben Leventhal. He actually co founded Eater, which was sold to Vox Media ten years ago for 30 million. He also sold Resi to American Express. And now his third company is this thing called Blackbird.
00:03:34.040 - 00:04:06.846, Speaker D: They raised over $30 million from the prominent VC's, and this app is only available in New York right now. And they're going to expand to other locations, like SF LA and Miami. But we're starting to notice this trend of, I feel like there's been an overinvestment into the infrastructure layer in crypto, but now we're finally seeing some investments into the application layer. So we saw Fronttech, which has its cyclical ups and downs, and now we have this potential mass consumer app called Blackbird. What do you guys think about this type of application? Like eat to earn?
00:04:07.030 - 00:04:14.702, Speaker A: So how do you use the tokens? Like, these fly tokens, are they used for buying food? You get discounts, or how do these get monetized?
00:04:14.838 - 00:04:52.334, Speaker D: Yeah, so from my knowledge in the future, you can use these fly tokens to make in app purchases. I have no idea how they're going to assign value to the token, but it's pretty cool, because whenever you go to a restaurant for the first time, you get an NFT, and the first time you go, you get a free perk. The third time you go, you get a free advertiser, and they're trying to incentivize people to go to multiple locations. You go to these restaurants, there's this red box thing that you tap your phone into. You get some tokens immediately. I went to this place called Monsieur Vaux, which is a vietnamese place. And the first time I went, I got a free sake shot.
00:04:52.334 - 00:05:30.112, Speaker D: I've been using this as an excuse to meet with different people, as a networking thing, which has been pretty fun, too. There's also this place called Madam Vo, which is another vietnamese restaurant owned by the same person. And the third time I got a spring roll, and the fourth time, if I go one more time, I'm going to get a free glass of wine. At the other vietnamese restaurants, they're using this app to incentivize people to go to multiple locations, even if it's owned by the same family. I think this makes sense. You try to use tokens to incentivize real world behavior. I think this is different from walk to earn, because when you're buying food, you're actually consuming something, you're actually paying something.
00:05:30.112 - 00:05:37.984, Speaker D: So I think iftus gains, like, millions of daily active users, monthly active users, they can't monetize this on the advertising side.
00:05:38.104 - 00:06:10.676, Speaker C: I'll share my experience quickly. I have a bunch of friends that are not into crypto in New York. I'm from the east coast, so everyone moved here, and these people are like, have never used a self custody wallet, never really bought anything on Coinbase, let's say. But for them, just downloading Blackbird and hearing, oh, this is from the Resi founder. He's creating a new app to sort of track loyalty, and you get some rewards for doing it. It's clicked with every, like, normal person I've shared it with here, and I've had, like, a blast hanging out with friends, going to a bunch of different spots. And the patrons themselves, like, are so excited to meet you.
00:06:10.676 - 00:06:38.596, Speaker C: They've all, like, you know, been excited to talk with us, shake our hand, ask how we heard about Blackbird, and talk a little bit about how it's helping their restaurant. And most people I spoke to, most bartender, servers, etcetera, said about five to 20 or so new customers are coming to the restaurant to check in with this app, which is pretty cool. So for me, it's just really exciting to see something in crypto that's not pure speculation, like new form of Ponzi nomics. It's nice to see people actually building in this space. So it's been awesome, really fun.
00:06:38.700 - 00:06:58.746, Speaker A: Nice. Sounds like we're at the early stages where it's fun. The points, we don't really know exactly how they're going to be used. North Koreans aren't trying to hack them. As soon as you can get free hamburgers with these points, I'm pretty sure Kim Jong un is going to immediately get his guys on it so he can. He can get his fix. Thicky.
00:06:58.746 - 00:07:02.734, Speaker A: Do you think there's Mev coming for fly points?
00:07:03.714 - 00:07:11.986, Speaker B: Potentially that is a nice thing. It's more civil proof against, I don't know, vietnamese airdrop farmers or something, because they're just partnering with american restaurants.
00:07:12.170 - 00:08:03.938, Speaker A: I do wonder, though, what the end game is for these things. I love the idea of always being a proponent of loyalty points using crypto rails. I've talked to a lot of startups and I've angeled in a few. One of the problems I always have when I kind of go through the thought process is you get these points, whether it's airline miles or something else. Ultimately, do they have a convertibility to dollars? And if you're making them fungible, because usually the idea when people bring up putting frequent player points on the blockchain is that, oh, well, you know, you can send, you can send them around and you can sell them and put them into defi, like amms and all this stuff, but as soon as you do that and it becomes fungible, it has no utility, there's no purpose. Like, it's the same as a dollar. You know, if a frequent flyer mile can be sold for x amount of dollars, there's no point for the mile to exist.
00:08:03.938 - 00:08:06.094, Speaker A: It's just the same as currency.
00:08:06.754 - 00:08:45.192, Speaker C: Let me share a little bit about the pitch. So I'm in an investment group that participated not in this most recent round, but in their seed about a year ago, maybe a year and change ago, and the pitch then, and I think that's still the pitch today, is that. So the founder was basically saying the average restaurant does about 5 million in revenue. Their goal is to match that 5 million or so in revenue with like the equivalent of $5 million worth of blackbird tokens. And the goal here for them is that the restaurants will have a governance share in the platform. So this would be more of a governance token. And the reason behind that is the founder sees a lot of value here in subverting the traditional payment rails.
00:08:45.192 - 00:09:25.278, Speaker C: So getting rid of that three to 4% rate that credit card companies charge, so you would pay directly on your phone, presumably through a blackbird POS system or a traditional system with stable coins, and that the platforms would then, like, own all of this data, or, excuse me, the restaurants would own all of this data and have, like, the majority of governance control over the platform, which was a pretty novel design. And I really like the approach they're taking. Of trying to be as invasive, as little invasive as possible with the restaurants so they're not changing anything about the restaurant's behavior. Taiki showed earlier, they just have this check in point where you tap in. Restaurants are already, like, super familiar with that, and this doesn't really add any work for them, which I think is a pretty cool approach.
00:09:25.446 - 00:09:35.926, Speaker A: I mean, I love the experimentation and does look like these guys have gotten through the first initial traction, which is awesome. Where is this? Is this on main net or l two, or where is this built?
00:09:35.990 - 00:09:38.734, Speaker D: It's on base. Chain. Base. That's awesome.
00:09:38.814 - 00:09:39.198, Speaker A: Okay.
00:09:39.246 - 00:10:11.274, Speaker D: Yeah. Base is racking up these wins. I feel like I personally have nothing against Solana, but I think one of the bold cases for Solana was, like, all these mass consumer apps are going to launch there because it's faster, cheaper, but it seems like friend tech, Blackbird, they're launching on. They're launching on base, and it seems like the developers that's actually trying to get mass adoption for whatever applications they're using is choosing base. What do you guys think about that? Do you think it's a fad? Do you actually think that this is where the puck is going?
00:10:12.254 - 00:11:02.346, Speaker A: The l two war is something that I spent a lot of time thinking about. And I have to say, given what we're seeing out of base compared to, like, their initial, you know, bald meme coin, like rugs and all this stuff is quite a lot better than I expected. I was looking at the charts for some of the other ones, like arbitrum, and we can talk about op as well later, but they're not looking as healthy. And I guess having the duopoly and also ETH kind of suffering not being, you know, anywhere even near holding 2000 is making some of these other l two s look pretty tame. Thiki, have you been kind of shorting some of these l two s and sui aptos? I saw Sui is just getting destroyed as well. Are you finding opportunities on the trading side on these?
00:11:02.530 - 00:11:27.282, Speaker B: Yeah, it's an interesting question. I do think, like, the l two space or. Yeah, the Alt l one space is probably going to trend towards, like, something like, near, like, a billion dollar market cap. I think, you know, Aptos and Sui are definitely still way too overvalued. I think the end game for these guys, like, in Solana included, is to be, like, a roll up onto ETH. That seems like, you know, a good way to keep relevance. I'm curious if you guys think the same thing, like, can.
00:11:27.282 - 00:11:30.378, Speaker B: Can a monolithic, like, l one exist? That's like separate from Ethan, have a.
00:11:30.386 - 00:12:14.160, Speaker A: Utility, the whole like ETH roll up stuff. I don't know what your guys Twitter feed looks like. I feel like sometimes mine is different than everybody else's because everybody will be commenting saying how everyone's fighting. Oh, there's all this fighting going on last weekend and I don't, I don't see any of it on my timeline. I just see people talking about other people doing it, but I don't actually see it. I have a lot of like nerds that talk about how like roll ups are, you know, side chain, they're different chains, and then it's all like a facade and they're not actually part of Ethereum. And what does it actually mean to be a roll up and working with mantle, obviously there's been a lot of decisions that I've seen in terms of data availability.
00:12:14.160 - 00:13:09.270, Speaker A: Do you use ethereum mainnet for data availability? Do you use Eigen layer to use something else? As you start to abstract the layers and not really be fully ethereum focused in every way, it gets very political. There's purists out there and there's people who are more practical. I would put myself on the more practical side. And I admire kind of, you know, what base has done in terms of just focusing on consumers and things that people actually want to use. And I'll give them props. I don't know if you guys have used the Coinbase wallet on the iPhone, pretty smooth. So I think those l two s that are product focused will do a lot better than ones that are just sort of building tech and trying to be purists and ultimately not get any users and not get any actual liquidity.
00:13:09.270 - 00:13:57.178, Speaker A: There was an interesting tweet by Roshan, uses Linia as a kind of example, as one that has raised a lot of money and launched already and has all this metamask advantage because they're aligned with metamask. And I don't know if you guys have been using metamask lately, but Linia has become like the top drop down option when you want to change chains. But his point is that two months into launch, their TVL is under 20 million and maybe they have something cooking, but it doesn't look necessarily like they're going to be able to get a lot of traction. And that could be the case for a lot of these l two s.
00:13:57.266 - 00:14:23.330, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think it's still quite early, frankly. I hadn't even. I think I might have heard of Linia, but haven't really read anything about it, so I can't really speak to that specifically. But I do think it's early. I don't think it's going to be a winner take all market going forward, similar to what we saw with like the l one rotation in the peak of last cycle. I think we'll see something like that. But to your guys's point earlier, I do think l two s are the future.
00:14:23.330 - 00:15:15.774, Speaker C: But I would be very disappointed if projects like Solana became l two s because while we don't think monolithic blockchains can scale in a decentralized way, like, giving up on that experimentation seems like a net negative to me, just because everyone pretty much agrees that if we could do it on one chain and scale that one chain and code, keep it decentralized and make sure there's enough throughput and gas prices didn't get out of control, that would certainly be better. The optimal case is one chain. All the liquidity is there, all the usage is there, and it can scale and it's decentralized. And I do like there's a segment of the market researching and building and investing in that, but I do think it's probably not feasible. So I agree with you guys that l two s are going to be where the liquidity goes in this possible next cycle. But I do hope Solana does not pivot to being a L2 on Ethereum.
00:15:15.854 - 00:15:30.390, Speaker A: I mean, I think you've had some experience with Solana and, like, is the bridging money there? Do you think that that's a fatal issue right now in the current state, without having FTX as a bridge? Do you see that there's a way where it still gets liquidity or.
00:15:30.502 - 00:16:21.290, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think you can currently bridge assets there through wormhole, but you're always exposed to that sort of wrapped asset risk. I think layer zero had plans to integrate Solana last year, but they decided to scrap it. I'm not sure when or if they're going to come to Solana so that you can natively swap that way and not be exposed to bridge risk. But yeah, I think from a DeFi perspective, bridging any asset because of the wormhole hack last year and also with FTX's wrapped solid assets just completely just getting wiped to zero, it just seems kind of risky to bridge any non like USDC assets on the Solana. And I think, like, their DeFi TVL has definitely reflected that. It's been difficult to grow and it's hard for people to, like, build that trust back because DeFi is one of those things where it's, like, very, very, very dependent on trust. More so than, let's say, like nfts or something like other use case.
00:16:21.402 - 00:16:45.408, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I just did my FTX claim today to try to make sure I get it in time for the deadline. And I just got PTSD looking at. I don't know if you guys have done it, but you see the exact same front end as FTX used to have, and it just shows you all the assets and all the withdrawals. It's not a great feeling looking at those bad memories.
00:16:45.576 - 00:16:50.536, Speaker B: Question for you, Jordy. Your claim is that denominated completely in cash, or is there crypto exposure?
00:16:50.560 - 00:17:20.776, Speaker A: With the claim, I was kind of aware what was going to happen before close, and I did. Just before the deadline, I switch everything to USD. So it's all cash, but there's like 0.00,125 serum and, like, all this kind of crap. So I'm worried that, like, I will have to go through a more complex process where they have to value those assets, even if it's just dust. I wish that there was a way I could just tell them to keep it, and I don't want it back. There was one that's, like, negative.
00:17:20.776 - 00:17:42.509, Speaker A: I have, like, a negative zero, zero one Algorand. So, you know, this stuff kind of pisses me off because it's literally worthless. But the lawyers will just happily spend $300 of their time making sure that it's accounted for just for, like, legal process. It seems like a total waste of everyone's time.
00:17:42.581 - 00:18:00.092, Speaker C: Did you guys see the mount Gox coins are delayed another year? I think October 2024 is when those coins will, like, are scheduled to get released. But, like, I wouldn't be surprised if it was delayed further. I mean, it's just insane how the incentives are all aligned to, like, keep these processes going and going and going. It's pretty wild.
00:18:00.268 - 00:18:22.108, Speaker B: I will say that with the Gox thing, I believe they delayed it only for people that haven't, like, entered their correct and full details. So the people that have, which I think is most of the people, they said that they're going to get the distributions hopefully by year end, which is very not good for, you know, it's kind of bearish, I think, because it's like $3.4 billion of crypto.
00:18:22.156 - 00:18:33.012, Speaker C: But, like, the base case probably is a little delayed. Right? Like, they've consistently pushed every deadline. Like, I think in 2020 was the initial date they were going to release the coins. Right.
00:18:33.188 - 00:19:00.108, Speaker D: I have a question for Thiki, because you mentioned earlier that you were like, just, you were like shorter than you've ever been. And you mentioned these token unlocks to supply overhangs, Gox, FTX, et cetera. Like, what's going to make you change your mind? Because if your inclination is to go short, then there has to be something that needs to happen for you to flip along and just say, you know what, it's time to go Max long. Like Max bid.
00:19:00.236 - 00:19:33.570, Speaker B: Yeah. So just to clarify, I was short a bunch of vaults and then BC ripped, then I ended up just capitulating. I was like, fine, I'll just hedge it with BDC. I was pretty flat on the book, luckily. But I guess I just need to see the supply overhang, just get sold into the market and see things resolve before bidding again. I do think, like, having ETF and next year, election year is a good confluence of stuff that people will bid into. So it seems like a reasonable time after the supply has been sold and all these new narratives pop up and get closer.
00:19:33.722 - 00:19:54.664, Speaker C: As a non trader, is it incorrect to think, like, because my thinking would be if next year could be bullish with all of these positive catalysts, like, now is the time to start thinking about a position. Is that the wrong way to think about it? Like, are these supply overhangs that you're referencing just too great to overcome and there needs to be some sort of capitulation and like bottoming process.
00:19:54.964 - 00:20:32.954, Speaker B: I saw Avi talk about this in his 1000 X podcast, and I think his thought, which I agree with, is that, like, there's not enough money to like, fairly price in a lot of these events. So, like, they'll just be overpriced or underpriced for long periods of time. So I think now is like an opportunity where it's like, even though the fair value should be trading higher, because, like, if we assume like $5 billion flows from ETF and have it in, like, some people should, you know, practically be able to just weather the storm and just price it in now. But I do think that there's not enough money that has that sort of patience and like, that conviction. So I think it's, you know, probably reasonable to just wait and then just buy it closer to the date and you. You'll still be fine.
00:20:33.034 - 00:21:28.672, Speaker A: It's kind of ironic, but the fundamentals are starting to matter in a way. You can actually make money and make Alpha just by looking at fundamentals. And I mean that also for flows, but also for choosing tokens and choosing apps and actually thinking, you know, who has established a good enough brand name like Uniswap or Aave, that, yeah, people can fork them, but ultimately, like, there is a trust and a recognition that can accrue value. And also these tokens might be very distributed now, so there's not a lot of overhang versus new kid on the block. It's going to just keep getting supply dumped constantly for the next five years. And ultimately their differentiation isn't great. With these l two s, I have noticed that some of them are just trying to get flagship apps that are uniswap.
00:21:28.672 - 00:22:01.150, Speaker A: And I saw Uniswap as nine different integrations with Polygon. And you kind of go down the list. I don't know if that's good for the chains. I feel like it depends who's bringing users. It's all about users. And if you think about it as a city that's hosting a restaurant, for example, or the best example I've thought about is l two s are sort of like an amusement park, like Disney World, and they have like slots inside for, you know, different shops. There's two strategies.
00:22:01.150 - 00:22:36.202, Speaker A: Like, you either bring the flagship apps that are already famous, like McDonald's and Burger King and Walmart, and you kind of put them into your amusement park because people know them and they'll use them name recognition. Or you take the stance that like, hey, like, I'm providing the customers, the customers are coming for me. And therefore, I'm not going to just give all the foot traffic to apps that I don't have any alignment with. I don't know. Would you guys feel comfortable using a chain that is developing its own native Dex rather than uniswap?
00:22:36.378 - 00:23:21.628, Speaker D: I think you can make an analogy to the 2021 Alto one rotations, because when Avalanche went crazy and like Polygon and Q one Q two of 2021, they basically brought legitimacy to their entire ecosystem by paying Aave and curve to deploy on their chain and just print a bunch of Avax tokens to get liquidity. And then after that liquidity came over to their chain, then like all these like, mini altcoin rotations, like Trader Joe, there's like a bunch of other tokens that just went crazy. So I think you have to do like a mix of both. So it's like with the amusement park analogy, like maybe you have to have a McDonald's and like a shake shack, and then you can start selling upselling your gourmet smoothies, like $12 smoothies on the side. And I think that's how you can actually create a pretty vibrant ecosystem.
00:23:21.796 - 00:24:16.148, Speaker C: Jordy though I think one of the issues is to compete with uniswap right now is next to impossible, right? I mean, of course someone could come up with something, but at the end of the day, the issue we saw with all these alternative l ones that tyke is referencing is no one brought anything new to the table. It's like Trader Joe is just a uni v two fork. Like all of the amms were uni v two forks. We saw some aave forks, compound forks. To me, like, if you're just seeing that there's literally no reason for this layer alt l one or in this case L2 to exist. So I think like the base playbook, and I know what you guys are doing at mantle is very cool as well. With you guys with real world assets, with Ondo, and then coinbase with like these sort of on chain summary, non Ponzi, fun real world things, what's needed to actually grow the ecosystem? I think if you're just a place to bring forks over, it's not really going to make it.
00:24:16.276 - 00:25:19.464, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know that I see it as competing with Uniswap. Uniswap is on Mainnet. They have their whales that trust them there. But if you're building new assets and they're going to be deployed on an l two, why would you want Uniswap to come in and take that business? Rather than have your native restaurant cook some stuff up and be aligned with the ecosystem, be much more willing to give some of their tokens as airdrops to the ecosystem. With Uniswap, you have to pay them like aave, you have to pay them. All these guys, they're asking you to give them incentives to come deploy and actually you're giving them users. So it seems to me like the strategy that I've taken with mantle kind of helping the DAO with their strategy there is, let's not even ask for these people to come and maybe let's block them from coming and instead make sure that we have teams that are fully capable of creating a similar product, but that actually can give some of its tokens to local users.
00:25:19.464 - 00:25:23.940, Speaker A: And my thesis is liquidity matters more than everything else.
00:25:24.092 - 00:26:06.702, Speaker C: I very much respect you guys are trying a new playbook and it's actually really interesting to hear you lay out the thesis. I guess the thing I'm just like hesitant about, or I have reservations about is I think for you guys to deploy for mantle or any L2, right, to deploy something that's better than uni v three or univ four, which is in the works, seems unlikely. And I think to get that liquidity to a new chain, it's very hard to do that if you're not doing something better. It's like Peter Thiel talking about having to be ten x better than the competition to outseat them. And of course, it could be done with incentives and whatnot. But I think if it's going to be sustainable, it has to be better. Or you have to work with these people like Uniswap and Aave that are trusted and really good at what they do onto your chain.
00:26:06.798 - 00:27:00.114, Speaker A: Well, you don't really have to get better. You just have to provide the service. And ultimately the rest of the economy, I think, is what matters. Because if you're looking at a uniswap, for example, all you need to do is provide a swapping service that is nice to use and simple and smooth and safe. It's all about what are people swapping? Are they coming there for the actual native assets that are on that chain? Like you mentioned, Ondo is an example of we're going to be the largest RWA hub, for example, or the largest stake Deeth hub on an l two. That type of asset and liquidity profile can matter a lot more than, is my aave fork better than Aave, or is it just recreating that service where people can borrow and lend it? Yeah, I'm curious to get some more thoughts on this.
00:27:00.194 - 00:27:20.074, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think it's all about liquidity, right? I think the reason ecosystems want Aave and Uniswap is that ecosystem know that if they deploy, they're going to get TVL. Whereas if some random team makes some univ three fork, maybe it caps out at 30, 40, 50 million TVL and it really doesn't reach escape velocity.
00:27:20.614 - 00:27:41.906, Speaker A: Why would. I mean, I want to push back because I don't understand why. If, let's say, uniswap deploys on Linea, why is Linea suddenly going to get a bunch of TVL who is waiting saying, oh, I really want to use Uniswap, but I need to use it on Linea instead of arbitrum or optimism. Who is that user? Does that user exist? I don't think they exist.
00:27:42.050 - 00:28:00.074, Speaker C: Well, you're worried about the swapper, but from a liquidity provider perspective, like, I wouldn't provide liquidity on some new L2 with a completely new amm project. Right. If it was Uniswap that launched. Okay, now I'm willing to provide liquidity and try this out. I think for a swapper, I agree with you. It's just about price. It's less relevant.
00:28:00.154 - 00:28:17.646, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with Justin. My main point was, like, I mean, you see, like, a project, a new project on a new chain getting rugged or hacked, like, literally every single day on Twitter. Like, oh, we just lost a million bucks. We just lost $2 million. Like, sorry, guys. Like, we should have luck. And because they're small teams, they don't, like, if, you know, swap got hacked or something happened, the exploit happened.
00:28:17.646 - 00:28:36.012, Speaker B: Like, they would just compensate out of their own pockets. So, like, having that safety of, like, okay, these guys have deep pockets. These guys have a brand to protect. So, like, I'm kind of protected here. It makes, like, the trade off more worth it. Like, I wouldn't even. I would say, like, at this stage, like, a new airdrop isn't even worth the risk of farming a new project on your chain right now.
00:28:36.108 - 00:29:42.150, Speaker A: No, I mean, I fully appreciate that part. And if I did have to choose between having a Uniswap and having, like, a random team deploy of, like, unknown quality and, like, potential ruggedness, I would, I would agree with you guys. I would choose, like, just convince Uniswap or whatever aave to come over. I guess the approach that I've taken is I will choose teams that are like, you know, well positioned VC level backed teams that can actually raise vc funding that are, you know, at least doxxed, maybe not publicly doxed, but like docs to investors and have them build these apps in a way, they get the exact thing you said, like, legitimacy and reputation so that people know, like, if something bad happens, like, there will probably be some ecosystem support. And you get that through the ecosystem itself and the mantle, for example, providing that legitimacy rather than having the app in Uniswap to it.
00:29:42.222 - 00:30:03.958, Speaker C: Jordy, can I ask you, and you mentioned some of these projects we don't have to name specifics require you to pay them, mainly their users with token incentives. Can you talk a little bit about that process with a uniswap or an aave? Is it not as simple as going through governance and just trying to get voters to vote to deploy? Like, is there some backdoor process where you sort of agree or commit to offering incentives?
00:30:04.086 - 00:30:47.108, Speaker A: So there's a mix, I think infrastructure stuff. You generally, you just paying, whether it's chainlink, whether it's, you know, USDC, whether it's tenderly, like, all these types of things you're generally paying, and it's quite expensive. On the other hand, if it is a Dow like Stargate, you know, you want to have bridging, do you want to have like you said aave these kind of things. It does go through governance, but usually what will happen is you go to the dao, you make a post and you say like hey, as part of you coming over we will provide a ton of like our token so that people can farm it here, which is sort of like paying them anyway. It's just a different form of payment rather than cash.
00:30:47.196 - 00:31:19.856, Speaker D: And I think one advantage mental has is you guys have like that big treasury. So if you do start like a new money market, maybe you do incorporate ondocoin like USdy I think as collateral. And then maybe you can allow different types of like yield strategies and yield aggregators can build on top. And if a money market has like $100 million in TVL, I think people will naturally trust it more. I think TVL is like a pretty big factor. I know like most people in crypto like they're not going to go through audits and read code. And to be honest even myself, it's like, oh, like this thing has a bunch of TVL.
00:31:19.856 - 00:31:31.488, Speaker D: It's probably safe. You know, like you kind of have to like make that. You kind of have to like make people trust your entire ecosystem. And I think this is like boosting TVL by using your own treasury is like a good way to do so.
00:31:31.576 - 00:32:08.138, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think the strategy has to come down to identifying where the value is actually coming from. And just like, you know, if you're running a poker game, you might have the regular guy who's just, you know, grinding and showing up every day. And the casino might think that, oh, this guy's like my best customer, you know, he's, he's coming in, he's playing 10 hours, paying all the rake. That's great. The reality is it's, it's like the fish that make the game. So the fish guy who comes in for 2 hours and like, you know, loses all his money is the one that's creating the ecosystem because everyone who shows up is for them, even if they're, you know, regulars.
00:32:08.138 - 00:32:37.494, Speaker A: So identifying that is the same as in trading. You know, the retail traders are more valuable than the minute the market makers, because market makers will go wherever there is people crossing the spread and providing that action. So I look at it from that standpoint as well. I'm really trying to not pay for the grinder, the professional who's just there to take the fish's money and instead try to incentivize the fish, if that makes sense.
00:32:39.794 - 00:33:20.278, Speaker D: I was just thinking, yeah, I guess it's kind of like, you know, like at the local poker room, like back when I was playing in college they had like these high hand promotions where every half an hour, like whoever makes like the biggest hand makes like a $1,000 or something. And I'm sure like that's probably like minus eight. I mean, like they're probably like losing money like directly from the promotion. But it gets people interested. It gets like the fish to come back time and time again because, oh, like it's Friday, you know, I'm gonna eat dinner there. Maybe I'll get a high hand and then I'll come back to my home like happy. So, yeah, like just trying to accommodate certain types of customers because those customers will attract other customers and those customers will attract different types of customers.
00:33:20.278 - 00:33:23.830, Speaker D: It's like a good way to think about maybe like multiplier effects for ecosystems.
00:33:23.942 - 00:33:57.850, Speaker A: Absolutely. I mean, it's new space. I think trying to do something creative at least you expand the possibilities out there rather than doing fork number 52 of Aave on ZK chain number 16. Totally. So we'll see how it plays out. I think Delta wars are one of the most interesting meta narratives that will play out over the next few years. I think we could see some m and a where one has really good tech but they don't know how to actually make good products or get good apps.
00:33:57.850 - 00:34:16.926, Speaker A: And then you have base mantle. These guys much more focused on the product side and potentially having some merger like, oh, we want your approver but you're going bankrupt because you don't have any activity. Let's put the two together. We'll see. This is something that could happen.
00:34:17.070 - 00:34:26.074, Speaker B: I was going to ask do you have any mantle defi projects that you want to show that you think are good projects to airdrop from?
00:34:26.574 - 00:34:28.054, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm curious too.
00:34:28.214 - 00:35:00.590, Speaker A: So all the kind of blue chips I would say have not really deployed yet. There's one I'm talking to that is going to be a month or two away. Okay, I'll drop the alpha. So I don't know if you guys are aware that mantle is doing their own lsd, sort of like lido or LST. They keep changing LSP. It's always a different letter at the end depending on which lawyer is asking you to be careful. But.
00:35:00.590 - 00:35:07.886, Speaker A: So Mantle is going to have its mantle ETH and the moniker will be meath, aka meth.
00:35:08.030 - 00:35:09.702, Speaker D: And then you walk in here and.
00:35:09.718 - 00:35:19.314, Speaker B: You bring me more meth. That's a brilliant plan. Is it brilliant?
00:35:19.974 - 00:35:27.854, Speaker A: And I talked to a borrow lend project that is doing lending and borrowing. So lab. So there's gonna be a meth lab?
00:35:28.234 - 00:35:33.454, Speaker B: Do you wanna build a meth lab? Come on, let's go and cook.
00:35:36.434 - 00:35:45.534, Speaker A: I think the meth lab is gonna be worth farming. Just a little alpha for our listeners, so keep an eye for that.
00:35:46.074 - 00:35:51.506, Speaker D: Yeah, that's brilliant. I like it. You gotta meme it. Yeah, that makes sense. The meth lab.
00:35:51.690 - 00:36:03.534, Speaker A: So I'm glad you guys approve. Speaking of approve, not approve, maybe let's finish up with our favorite segment and see what you guys have been looking at lately.
00:36:04.074 - 00:36:05.094, Speaker B: Approved.
00:36:05.994 - 00:36:07.294, Speaker D: Not approved.
00:36:07.794 - 00:36:09.122, Speaker A: Taeki, would you want to start?
00:36:09.218 - 00:36:43.950, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So there's like this new friendtech fork called post tech, and it's literally a fork of Twitter that also incorporates elements of, I guess, like Friendtech, where if you go to my profile, my keys are trading. I don't even know what people are saying. 0.064 people are just spamming GM. And I don't know, it seems like it's this meta where some type of new project finds product market fit in terms of friend tech. Then there's this new project on arbitrum that literally forks.
00:36:43.950 - 00:36:57.366, Speaker D: It incorporates other ponzonomic elements and tries to vampire attack some TVL. What do you guys think of this? Like, is this type of. Is post tech approved? Do you see defeat? Like, do you think it's gonna work? What do you guys think?
00:36:57.470 - 00:37:00.674, Speaker C: Sign me up for the Ponzi. I approve. I'm down to try it.
00:37:01.894 - 00:37:09.166, Speaker A: Justin loves just getting into this stuff and trying to get some points. I feel like you love points. You love accumulating.
00:37:09.310 - 00:37:45.628, Speaker C: If there's one actual piece of alpha in crypto that anyone can share, it's that you have to try everything because you never know what's going to be, like, an irrational hit. Like, you know, nine out of ten times you're wrong, right? But the one out of ten times you're right. It more than makes up for it. And actually, usually, like, if you, you know, if you're listening to our podcast, like, one thing I had to reframe about my thinking is that you're actually probably early. Like, if you're as deep as we are and you're like one of the few thousand listeners here, you're probably hearing about these things before the regular majority would be. And so, like, you really have to try everything when you first hear about it. That's the strategy I've employed.
00:37:45.628 - 00:37:53.604, Speaker C: It's led to a lot of amazing airdrops over the past few years. And that's the one piece of advice I always give everyone is just like spend the time and try everything.
00:37:53.764 - 00:38:01.664, Speaker D: Just then with like Blackbird, like he came to New York and he's like spending two, 3 hours every single day, like walking through like different restaurants. Like, this guy is definitely a grinder.
00:38:02.644 - 00:38:18.878, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think, like in a hypothetical, like mania phase. Like, I mean, it sounds outlandish, but you're getting almost 1000 tokens per visit, which I think is not crazy that this could be a $10 token if it hits a few billion dollars FDB. So yeah, I love trying new things.
00:38:18.966 - 00:38:44.396, Speaker A: I think size chat, I can see his 0.93. Like, that's insane. Like, he is a really high value. I guess people are doing the whole like, racer thing where they're just saying, who's in charge of this? And size chat is kind of like the arbitrum guy, I guess. So since this is on arbitrum, that makes sense. They're giving him the, the racer slot. Wow, it's kind of crazy.
00:38:44.420 - 00:39:01.916, Speaker B: How many likes with 1200 followers is getting like 1000 likes on his post. That's some insane engagement. Yeah, I think I approve. I don't want racer to like, cut my points on friend type. Yeah, I think it's a nice ui. I think Justin's right. You should try everything.
00:39:02.020 - 00:39:19.654, Speaker A: Fair enough. I mean, I feel like they've done an incremental improvement by using, uh, Twitter and combining that with friendtech. And it's a weird stepchild where I, I kind of approve. It's different enough. It's not a vanilla fork, so. Okay, cool. That's a fair game.
00:39:20.314 - 00:39:21.210, Speaker B: Approved.
00:39:21.362 - 00:39:22.754, Speaker A: Justin, how about you?
00:39:22.874 - 00:39:57.022, Speaker C: Yeah. So my approved not approved this week is Ben Armstrong. Previously Bitboy. Crypto is dealing with this crazy legal battle with Bitboy, which was taken over by his employees, presumably, and now he's asking for donations basically to fund his legal defense. And there's a lot of posts, if you want to have a good laugh, you can watch. Look at this thread. There's a lot of posts of like, Ben Armstrong flexing his wealth a la the same style of like, some other players we've seen in the space, like do Kwan and whatnot.
00:39:57.022 - 00:40:12.144, Speaker C: And so this is an interesting one. I don't know whether to approve or not approve. I mean, part of me feels bad for this guy. He's had some substance abuse and anger issues, clearly, and, and now he allegedly has no money, but yeah, I don't know. Do you guys approve? Are you going to donate to this, Jordi?
00:40:13.404 - 00:40:17.156, Speaker A: It's probably the last. Last place I would donate. Definitely not approved.
00:40:17.220 - 00:40:18.228, Speaker D: Not approved.
00:40:18.396 - 00:40:50.726, Speaker A: I appreciate that he's an emotional creature that's, you know, wearing his heart in his sleeve and all over the place, but not. Not being the best citizen and not somebody that I feel like it's worth donations, but, you know, if his users feel like they want to make him bounce back. This is definitely an example of Web 3.0, where the real kind of money comes from the fans just creating token support.
00:40:50.830 - 00:41:02.848, Speaker D: Yeah, I definitely don't approve the donation aspect, but I hope he, like, if he, like, figures his life out. Um, and I don't, like. I don't, like, wish anything bad on the guy.
00:41:02.976 - 00:41:10.584, Speaker B: Has anyone been, like, keeping track of, like, what's actually happened? Like, I don't either. Like, it seems like a bunch of things happened with this guy in the past couple months.
00:41:10.664 - 00:41:23.444, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, all I've seen is, like, thumbnails. Oh, I cheated on my wife, or I didn't cheat. I did cheat. Okay. And here's the confession. And, yeah, doing drugs and gambling and, uh, you know, I lost it all. Can you.
00:41:23.444 - 00:41:32.632, Speaker A: It's fine. I don't spend time on this stuff, but I understand the entertainment value, so I approve the entertainment value if that's worth anything.
00:41:32.768 - 00:41:39.924, Speaker B: Is this, like, is this, like, a new way of getting engagement in the. On the YouTube scene, in the bear market? Is this what you have to do?
00:41:40.304 - 00:41:41.816, Speaker C: This is what it takes?
00:41:42.000 - 00:41:51.004, Speaker D: Yeah. I started spending $40 on thumbnails. I hired, like, the thumbnail designer. It's really tough out here to get engagement and clicks.
00:41:52.384 - 00:41:53.904, Speaker A: Thank you. What do you have this week?
00:41:54.024 - 00:42:24.814, Speaker B: Yeah, so optimism announced that they were essentially selling $160 million op tokens OTC to seven purchasers, which are. They're locked up for two years, which is an interesting part of it. I'm not sure if it's going to be, like, a gentleman's agreement or an actual contractual lockup. Um, so, yeah, I mean, obviously the treasury needs to sell to, like, raise money for funds, but, like, I'm curious what you guys think about, like, the way they did it. Is this bullish or bearish and, like, is this better or worse than, like, selling the open market?
00:42:24.894 - 00:42:48.030, Speaker C: I think it's good. I mean, I think it's great for them to diversify their holdings and to actually, like, know for sure that they're going to have capital to sustain themselves. I also wanted to pull this up as well, I'm in an OTC trading chat and basically someone is looking to buy a pretty large tranche of op. So, like, there is some demand out there and I think it's obviously just a healthy thing for them to do, personally.
00:42:48.102 - 00:43:23.492, Speaker A: I mean, we do need to find ways for all these vc's that raised a bunch of money last cycle to actually deploy it, do some capital calls, and they need some legitimate projects that they can point to and not get their lp's pissed off at them that they deployed in them, even if the price goes down. So op is sort of like Microsoft. You're not going to get fired for putting some money into it. I don't know if it's going to have an amazing return, but, you know, it's bullish. Like, some of the money comes into the ecosystem and supports the op price, so shows that there's a bid for it. So I think it's good for sure. Definitely approved by me.
00:43:23.588 - 00:43:32.544, Speaker D: Yeah, I definitely approve as well. I mean, this is like a pretty clean way to sell tokens. They have Runway two year lock ups. Pretty good. I mean, I think it's a win win for everybody, to be honest.
00:43:33.644 - 00:44:06.474, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the alternative would have been to do like a daily twap with DWF and claim that it's an OTC transaction. So I think this is a bit better. And talking about DWF, there's a little bit of drama in the market making world, guys. You know, like as a. As a market maker, I'm standing back and just observing. But, you know, some of Cellini's competitors, GSR, winter, mute, and, you know, the legitimate guys, the cool kids in class have been. They've been bullying my boy Andre.
00:44:06.474 - 00:44:39.952, Speaker A: We see Christian Gill here from GSR saying that DWF, who was on a panel here in Singapore, he had no business to be on this panel. It is insulting to GSR to be in the same room as my boy. I mean, those are strong fighting words. And we saw Andre had an amazing response. He's basically saying that we're better at trading, we're better at bd, we're better at all these things. I can see both sides. I mean, it's a different business perspective that both have taken.
00:44:39.952 - 00:45:03.606, Speaker A: I'm remaining neutral. We do have a scheduled podcast next week, actually, with Mister Grachev. He might be making his directorial debut with us if all goes well next week. So our listeners should definitely tune in for that one. I think it's gonna be a banger. Hopefully, nothing happens in the meantime. And he does show up.
00:45:03.606 - 00:45:11.094, Speaker A: But, you know, this drama, I would say, like, I prefer this to the bit boy drama. So from my side, approved. I don't know about you guys.
00:45:11.214 - 00:45:18.934, Speaker D: Yeah, from the drama perspective, I definitely approve. Definitely fun to see like, all these market makers fighting each other. Definitely like bear market vibes, I guess.
00:45:19.014 - 00:45:26.358, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm gonna hold my final judgment till after next week, so. So I'm holding back my non approval, but we'll see how next week goes.
00:45:26.486 - 00:45:30.022, Speaker A: Thicky. What's your final, final decision here?
00:45:30.158 - 00:46:07.408, Speaker B: It's kind of like, it's very nuanced because obviously if Wintermute and GSR think DWF is like, if they think they're pushing the envelope more in terms of the risk and what they're doing, then it might give them a bad name to be associated with the same people. So I get why they're doing that, and I totally understand why TWF would want to grow the brand and be associated with, oh yeah, tier market maker level of like, GSR would immute and DWF. So I. It makes sense politically from both ends to say what they're saying. So I guess I approve. Approved. It's not like drama for drama.
00:46:07.408 - 00:46:08.976, Speaker B: Fake. It makes sense.
00:46:09.120 - 00:46:35.704, Speaker A: It's exactly what you said. Like, this is like business posturing. It's more for the spectators. It's not like they're doing it talking to each other. They're on stage performing for the community and trying to position themselves either as, you know, legitimate, cool, successful. They're all taking different routes, I would say. You know, Andre has been the meme king and these guys are trying to be like the button down suit, professional type.
00:46:35.704 - 00:46:48.066, Speaker A: And, you know, I. I approve the, the whole transaction. So hopefully Mister Grachev will give us some good memes next week and we'll see you guys there. Take care. Bye.
