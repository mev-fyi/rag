00:00:00.200 - 00:00:27.682, Speaker A: People are starting to worry about, like, 2008 style rehypothecation because you take the points and you restake them, but you're just wrapping, wrapping, wrapping, and, like, there is, like, an economic security of Ethereum at the very bottom. But if any part of this chain breaks, there could be, like, you know, these, like, holes left in different balance sheets all over the place. And, I mean, there are people starting to want to do perks and leverage on restaking yields, stuff like that. Definitely reminds me of some of the scenes in the big short.
00:00:27.818 - 00:00:36.890, Speaker B: I think theoretically, it's not good, and it adds another risk to Ethereum. But at the end of the day, like, they're, they can just roll back the chain and they probably would have to.
00:00:37.002 - 00:00:37.330, Speaker A: I feel.
00:00:37.362 - 00:00:49.354, Speaker C: I feel like a lot of people love to talk about this 2008 style crash that's gonna happen in 2025 that's gonna get destroyed, the bull market. But I feel like there's also this element that people love to talk about it, to claim clout.
00:00:49.474 - 00:00:51.814, Speaker A: Steady lads deploying more capital.
00:00:52.174 - 00:00:54.634, Speaker D: I think a crouch is bullish, and I welcome it.
00:01:15.054 - 00:01:37.394, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody. Episode 29 of Steady Lads. I'm Jordy, the founder of Celini and also the chief alchemist at Mantle. We have thicky with us, half sunburned, half spectacled. So he's kind of, like, in a intermediate state right now. We have Taiki, the founder of HFA. We found out that this means the humble former army, apparently.
00:01:37.394 - 00:01:45.414, Speaker A: So pretty cool name. And Justin, is. Are you with us or are you in a different room? Justin, like, what are you?
00:01:45.714 - 00:01:55.018, Speaker B: I'm in the metaverse right now. I've got you guys down here. I've got my messages up there. I've got the charts up to the left here, and I'm just, just vibing, testing this thing out.
00:01:55.186 - 00:01:59.066, Speaker A: Have you taken it off, or are you just, like, wearing this 24/7 I'm.
00:01:59.090 - 00:02:07.906, Speaker B: Going to be honest, this thing you can't really wear for me, at least after 30 minutes, you just want to take it off. It's super heavy. It hurts the cheekbones. Your eyes are going to bleed in this thing.
00:02:07.970 - 00:02:08.586, Speaker C: It's.
00:02:08.730 - 00:02:16.100, Speaker B: It's just not, it's a very impressive tech, but it's. It's not necessarily there yet, I'll say that. But it's very cool. There's some neat stuff.
00:02:16.202 - 00:02:25.248, Speaker A: I think. I think our viewers, like, appreciate that you're always, you know, got the latest gadgets. I don't know if you can. You use your, like, solana phone on top of the. Can you combine them and you're very.
00:02:25.296 - 00:02:37.760, Speaker B: Much forced to stay in the apple walled garden with these things. So maybe if the saga too, maybe they'll have some connectivity there. But no. Very much stuck in the Apple universe. And like I always said, you got to try everything. You never know, you might get an airdrop for this.
00:02:37.832 - 00:03:10.036, Speaker A: Who knows? You know, I saw people was. Was not very happy with, with the product. He. He wrote a long post describing how, you know, it should just be glasses and this is too clunky and, you know, this is the wrong direction. And then, you know, ten minutes later he posted a beeple daily with snake and his Drake and his snake. So you know that that guy's doing him. But do you agree with, with the criticism? Do you think that this product is a user friendly product?
00:03:10.220 - 00:03:37.508, Speaker B: I do think it has some clear applications. Like watching 3d movies is awesome. Some of the gaming stuff is super cool. It's gonna be something we all use 8 hours a day, and in ten years, surely we'll all have some version of this on 8 hours a day. But the form factor right now is not conducive to a good user experience. It has to get down in size, of course, but you can tell that this is going to be the future. What they've been able to achieve right now is still quite incredible.
00:03:37.508 - 00:03:52.052, Speaker B: And I'm excited they're doing something new. I'm excited to see where this thing is at in five years, ten years. And I think I'll probably get every version of it every year. When they release a new one, I'll probably upgrade because it is good and I'm excited to see what they do with it next.
00:03:52.228 - 00:04:02.598, Speaker A: I mean, it's all about the apps, I guess. So. Do you think there's going to be a trading terminal where you get the charts up and you have the tweets coming out and the alert updates?
00:04:02.756 - 00:04:15.858, Speaker D: I hope so. I definitely. I mean, I feel like I spend most of my life, just like when I'm pretty on my phone, I'm just like looking with my neck down. It's terrible for my posture. So I feel like, you know, this would be a good lifestyle upgrade.
00:04:16.026 - 00:04:28.654, Speaker B: I don't think this is going to be better for your lifestyle or posture. I think this is really going to hurt your eyes and break your neck. So you have neck problems. This thing's going to snap it off. But I got to take this thing off. It's already too long.
00:04:29.164 - 00:04:38.344, Speaker A: Taiki, do you think this is bullish? Nfts are people going to start getting more attached to their nfts or AI waifu girlfriends or. What do you think it means?
00:04:38.964 - 00:05:05.980, Speaker C: I'm bullish. This is unconfirmed, but apparently apple has gated porn from those goggles. I literally just thought of this, but I'm bullish. Deep horn decentralized porn where anyone can access any types of content without having to go through, I guess, like, web two rails and crypto fixes this. Maybe, you know, just. Just being honest.
00:05:06.092 - 00:05:16.424, Speaker A: Maybe pretty soon tyke is going to be, like, shilling. Like, on the one hand, you know, Kanto real world assets, and on the other hand, it's going to be like. It's going to be like the barbell strategy from tight.
00:05:17.044 - 00:05:18.932, Speaker C: No, no, no, wait.
00:05:18.988 - 00:05:22.594, Speaker D: Speaking of Kanto, what was going on in Kanto?
00:05:23.454 - 00:05:29.726, Speaker C: I took a loss. I I. My thesis was invalidated, and I took a lot.
00:05:29.870 - 00:05:32.542, Speaker D: I think it's been down only, you.
00:05:32.558 - 00:05:39.390, Speaker A: Know, you talked about, like, deep porn. I think that that's going to be, like, l porn if you bring up the canto charts.
00:05:39.542 - 00:05:41.394, Speaker B: I don't know if I can do that to him.
00:05:41.694 - 00:05:44.994, Speaker D: I can do that to him. Justin took one look at the chart.
00:05:46.234 - 00:06:06.474, Speaker C: Funny, because, like, last week, I made a video saying that, like, hey, I was wrong on this. And then, like, I had multiple people reach out to me, and they're like, yeah, like, tikey. That video reminded me of the Jim Cramer CNBC clip when, like, meta hit dollar 100 and he was crying on tv. He was publicly apologizing. He's like, I trusted the management team.
00:06:06.514 - 00:06:07.330, Speaker B: I was wrong.
00:06:07.482 - 00:06:08.962, Speaker C: And that was, like, the people bottom.
00:06:09.058 - 00:06:10.850, Speaker D: I trusted the management team.
00:06:10.962 - 00:06:24.072, Speaker A: What's going to happen if it, like, shoots back up? Taiki? I mean, meta is back at, like, 500, right? Like, I saw the run up. Like, just such an incredible bounce back. What happens if, like, you know, you sold pianto at the low and it rips back up? How are you going to feel then?
00:06:24.248 - 00:06:41.928, Speaker C: You know, it just happens, you know? I just have to. I had a thesis. It got invalidated, like, so I just have to cut, you know, like, I just have to stick to my rules and deal with the consequences. I'm already getting trolled everywhere. You know, it's brutal. But I did this to myself, so I can't really. I did this to myself.
00:06:41.928 - 00:06:44.680, Speaker C: I can't really, you know, fault anyone. It is what it is.
00:06:44.792 - 00:06:46.724, Speaker A: He loves take you love the pain.
00:06:47.984 - 00:06:53.844, Speaker D: We need to be buying Tyke's liquidation. That's right. That's, like, the last seller.
00:06:56.144 - 00:07:03.600, Speaker B: Core contributors say they're done with the project and decentralizing to the community or what actually happened there, what caused it to finally sort of capitulate.
00:07:03.792 - 00:07:31.784, Speaker C: I mean, I'm sure there's, like, no one reason, but I guess, like, the real world asset thesis is or the adoption has been slow. I think one of the ex contributors are selling. I think some fund is also selling. And then it's pretty low mark cap, I guess so. There's a lot of price impact and then typical mid curve tyk just selling the lows, just adding to the damage.
00:07:32.164 - 00:08:04.450, Speaker A: I mean, the swings in crypto, they're so reflexive and so extreme. The one that stands out for me, actually is cow swap because. Because it did this round during the bull market, I think it was like a dollar on the private round and token launches. And in the bear market, it just went to $0.05, which just seems pretty extreme because they were still doing everything that they said they were going to do. Pretty good bounce off the bottom of that one, hopefully for the canto crew. What are the cantees?
00:08:04.562 - 00:08:04.994, Speaker C: Cat?
00:08:05.074 - 00:08:07.122, Speaker A: Cantonese, like, what's their name?
00:08:07.218 - 00:08:09.494, Speaker B: The canto cantaloupes, obviously.
00:08:10.234 - 00:08:12.682, Speaker C: I don't think we have a name. I don't think we deserve a name.
00:08:12.818 - 00:08:13.306, Speaker B: We?
00:08:13.410 - 00:08:14.454, Speaker A: What do you mean we?
00:08:19.634 - 00:08:20.394, Speaker C: It's a hoover.
00:08:20.434 - 00:08:20.970, Speaker A: Fuck.
00:08:21.082 - 00:08:22.026, Speaker C: What have I done?
00:08:22.170 - 00:08:34.824, Speaker A: Sometimes when I, like, I hire traders from, like, other firms. You know, they're there. They've been there for like, five years and they come from like, jump or whatever. And they're like, oh, yeah, this is how we do things. Like, no, no, there's no Wii anymore. There's a new Wii now. You got.
00:08:34.824 - 00:08:36.404, Speaker A: You gotta adapt, taiki.
00:08:36.944 - 00:08:44.204, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I have to adapt now. I'm a dimension diamond hands. That's new tribe.
00:08:44.624 - 00:08:54.672, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's talk a little bit about the latest and greatest. So dimension was the most hyped, is that fair to say? It was the most hyped. Tia airdrop.
00:08:54.808 - 00:09:21.674, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, this is the first airdrop to actually hit people. So it is the most hype because it is the first. But in the modular stack like dimension is trying to be the settlement layer. So TF for data availability, dimension for settlement, and then all the roll ups for execution. So it's kind of competing with the eat scaling roadmap in that sense. So it's kind of like that narrative is taking over and then staking it for airdrops, potentially, yeah.
00:09:21.714 - 00:09:39.518, Speaker A: Good narrative. The other narrative is like chains going down, bullish. Now we can sell. So let's talk a little bit about what we saw this week. So quite a strange day. Solana went down for the first time in a couple of years. Right.
00:09:39.518 - 00:10:07.354, Speaker A: I think the last time was during a bull market, and somehow on the same day, the launch of this long awaited coin, and somehow that also, like, the chain was, like, not working as well and people couldn't actually move coins around. So are we back to, like, you know, beta tech is bullish because it's not finished yet and it's going to get better? Or how is the market behaving? Thicky?
00:10:07.514 - 00:10:30.510, Speaker D: So Solana's had, like, eight or nine outages last year in 2022 and 2020, mostly in 2022. And for the most part, like, those didn't really move the price too much. I do think these things aren't really short term price movers, but longer term, they do affect the narrative about who allocates and things like that. It is quite unfortunate to see because they've gone really long stretch before going down.
00:10:30.622 - 00:11:04.684, Speaker A: Yeah, we've had this rotation into new coins. We had a few last week. We had Zeta, for example, come out, and then dimension comes out. It seems like there is still enough money in the system to pump all of these things. I was a little bit surprised that dimension has been ripping up pretty substantially. Do you think? Take that. People are getting bullish, Tia, because they're thinking, oh, there's going to be more of these, and they're going to pay for my entire bag, or you're in that space, what's actually happening?
00:11:05.304 - 00:11:42.030, Speaker C: Yeah, that's definitely the narrative. And I mentioned this a couple months ago on this podcast. But the narrative is the valuation of Tia doesn't really matter because the airdrops will pay for the position. And then it's kind of like this three three narrative where people are willing to pay whatever price just because if you're early enough, then you'll get enough tokens. My dimension airdrop is more than paid for my TF position. So if you have this type of story going, then the community just becomes even more diamond handed, and we kind of have this cult community warming.
00:11:42.142 - 00:11:47.714, Speaker A: And are you holding the dimension airdrop or are you selling it.
00:11:49.974 - 00:12:15.582, Speaker C: For all the other airdrops? In the future, I'll probably just have a plan to sell, but for dimension specifically, I'm not going to sell. I mean, I even launched a validator for dimension, so I'm actually bullish. This project alt layer, I'll probably dump, you know, it close to Eigen layer launch, you know, all the other airdrops, you know, I like this. Nuke it. But, you know, for dimension, I'm staking because, you know, like, the narrative is stake dying for airdrops.
00:12:15.638 - 00:12:35.610, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you like narrative, Justin? Like, this seems to be the new meta. It's you stake, you get airdrops, and then people just airdrop to each other and everyone's just bullish because, you know, pith is airdropping to those guys, and wormhole is airdropping to pith, and the next guy is airdropping. So are we just going to airdrop to each other and play this game.
00:12:35.642 - 00:13:18.460, Speaker B: Or, you know, I'm happy for people that make money in airdrops. I've had, like a ton of success with them, and I. It's like the best part of my day, when you wake up and you see a new airdrop in your wallet and you get to sell it to ETH or do whatever you want with it. One thing I'll say that's sort of ruining this for everybody is that all of the projects airdropping are now rewarding sibyl ers with very outsized gains and not rewarding normal people that just use one account. Like, we've talked about Eigen layer staking for a while now. About a year ago, maybe, or six months ago, seven months ago, when I opened up and I used it, I made only one account and put all of my stake deep in one account because I was like, oh, these are points, you know, I'll just get one for one. It doesn't matter.
00:13:18.460 - 00:13:44.302, Speaker B: I don't have to sybil this, but I have a pretty strong feeling, just based on what we're seeing in the past and, you know, the large whales that now have outsized shares of points in Eigen layer, that they're going to end up sort of flattening out that distribution, which is pretty frustrating. Frustrating. And it makes me less likely to participate in air, in this airdrop farming mechanic. So I've staked celestia, but I'm not going to do the whole thing where I do a bunch of different accounts, even though that's probably like the better ev play.
00:13:44.398 - 00:13:48.478, Speaker A: You're not going to get a ticket on Sisyphus Airlines. That's what you're saying.
00:13:48.606 - 00:14:00.434, Speaker B: Exactly. It's just not a system I agree with. It's so silly that we would. We would reward siblers when it's so transparent and obvious that this is happening and people are staking like peanuts of dollars of amounts. We should have a better system.
00:14:01.054 - 00:14:30.042, Speaker A: I want to give the viewers and the listeners a little bit of deeper insight into this. It is quite important. So taiki if you can bring up the great tweet by Evan, who did some of the math. Look, he says, should it be linear or sublinear? And he has a kind of scale. He thinks one to two, maybe it's okay. And then 100 to 1000 of Sybil, it's like insider crime, he calls it. He actually did calculate for some of the airdrops recently what the ratio is.
00:14:30.042 - 00:15:04.828, Speaker A: If you had broken it up into, you know, 100 wallets. If you had 100 sol and you had 100 wallets, that's the multiple that he's talking about. So breaking it down into the smallest pieces versus just having it in one wallet. And in many of these cases here, we see about dimension. He said, like, you know, if you stake a thousand dimension, you're getting $9,000. If you stake the same 1000, but one per account, you get $1,290,000. How is this real life, guys? Like, how is this.
00:15:04.828 - 00:15:15.004, Speaker A: How is this real life? And obviously, it just suits people who are not retail users, right? It suits people who are just printing wallets with some farm.
00:15:15.344 - 00:15:35.552, Speaker B: Well, it's interesting. Presumably, their goal is we don't want to give outsize returns to larger whales. We want to give it to the quote, unquote real users who only have, let's say, $1,000 in their account, which is obviously, like, a very noble goal. It's better for the distribution, it's better for the community. It's a nice thing to do. But the issue is, I don't think that's what's happening. I don't think they're actually rewarding the real people.
00:15:35.552 - 00:15:46.970, Speaker B: I think they're rewarding the people that are just willing to, Sybil, attack these things and that have the sophistication to do it in an automated way. So I think you're sort of losing in both dimensions when you do it this way, and it should just be linear.
00:15:47.122 - 00:16:05.210, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I think the people who are doing this are the ones actually most likely to sell. And the whales, you know, they're actually not very likely to sell. Like, you know, they. They don't need to sell. Uh, they have, you know, a ton of ETH or salt, whatever they're using. The Tia, whatever they're farming, and compared to the Sibyl ers, whale is better than Sybillers.
00:16:05.210 - 00:16:06.914, Speaker A: That. That's how I see it.
00:16:06.954 - 00:16:17.042, Speaker C: Yeah, that's like a thing, right? Like, show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome. And, like, I was like, okay, like, this is going to happen regardless. So I'm going to Sibyl.
00:16:17.098 - 00:16:17.266, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:17.290 - 00:16:25.322, Speaker C: That was kind of my mentality. I do think it should be linear and then maybe, like, diminishing returns at some extent.
00:16:25.378 - 00:16:36.398, Speaker A: If you sibyl, like, is there a risk too small. Like, if you break it into, like, you know, instead of one t, I. You break it into, like, 0.5 t and then, like, zero because they cut you off. Like, you don't really know. Right.
00:16:36.506 - 00:16:40.910, Speaker C: Yeah, that's why I'm, like, hedging. Like, I have different, like, amounts, you know?
00:16:40.942 - 00:17:12.332, Speaker D: Like, the interesting thing is, like, the counter side of this argument is actually something you brought up an earlier thread, Jordy. I think you were talking about the DodX airdrop, where, like, people got, like, hundreds of thousands, if not a million. And you're like, at a certain point, like, if you give someone over $100,000 an airdrop, like, they're just. They just have to sell it. Like, there's a cap on how much you give someone. It's like, how do you reconcile, like, oh, like, I can't give the whales too much because then it just automatically gets sold. But I also, like, I can't incentivize these tiny guys just to split up wallets because I still need to give away a certain amount of token.
00:17:12.428 - 00:17:21.284, Speaker B: It's a tough. It's a tough pickle. Hopefully we'll see. I mean, Jordy, you're mister game theorizing. Hopefully you can come up with. With something different. But I do want to say one last thing to the audience.
00:17:21.284 - 00:17:34.750, Speaker B: This is like a position where you can either be right or you can make money. And I was giving you what I think is the right answer. But Tyky is, like, thinking about it in the way that we should all be operating. Like, if you want to make money, you should probably sible these things, honestly.
00:17:34.852 - 00:17:35.114, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:35.154 - 00:18:03.954, Speaker C: And there's also, like, the PR element, like the social layer, right? Where, like, if you. If a project is like, you have to stake at least $5,000 of a token to get their job, then that's like a PR nightmare, right? So I feel like projects that, you know, the highest they can go is probably like $1,000 or something, but that's still going to, you know, get Sybils to, like, you know, Sybil accounts because there's, like, no perfect solution. So I think a linear process makes sense, but, you know, it's up to the team, right, to design these things.
00:18:04.034 - 00:18:35.768, Speaker A: One thing that I like quite a bit is the airdrops to NFT collections. So we've seen pudgies and madlads be like the top two favorite collections for getting airdrops. And, you know, you just get the same per per NFT and the coal communities together, and you're actually targeting community. I think those are the best. And that's why I bought my mad lads. You know, hopefully, you know, some insider Alpha, but some of the. I've looked at some of the accounts of the wormhole, you know, coos and stuff, and I see a lot of skulls and mad lads in there.
00:18:35.768 - 00:18:55.558, Speaker A: So they announced that the ticker is w. It's going to be epic. That's like the baller ticker. It's the single, like, you know, just w. I think it's going to be the first one in the top 100 with a single letter. Hopefully some good stuff there. But even for nfts, I've seen that some people had multiple nfts.
00:18:55.558 - 00:19:08.390, Speaker A: They had a pudgy and a madlads, or they had a few together. They still get penalized. You need to hold your five pudgies in five different wallets, which it's not very cool.
00:19:08.542 - 00:19:30.248, Speaker C: Yeah, it's really impossible for teams to do it perfectly. No matter what they do. People will be pissed. There's no perfect way to drop. But, yeah, like, it's always best to Sibyl if you're just trying to maximize profits. Do you guys, like, know when the wormhole airdrop's happening? I heard Starkware is happening, like, this month. I don't know about wormhole.
00:19:30.336 - 00:19:55.680, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's gonna probably be Starkware first wormhole, you know, maybe next month. Given they just announced the ticker, it takes a while after that to move on. So that's the approximate timelines. We obviously, we're still in the afterglow or depending on how you experienced it. We talked about Jupiter last time, so we're a week away now. I would say. There's not many people talking about it anymore.
00:19:55.680 - 00:20:15.674, Speaker A: It was like the topic of the first days. There was a lot of podcasts done by the founder and trying to explain the sell side, liquidity buy side, and he's not rugging. And, thikki, maybe you've been keeping close eye on this. Can you tell us a little bit about that Jupiter situation? Yeah.
00:20:15.714 - 00:20:53.140, Speaker D: So the Jup team is supposed to pull their team liquidity yesterday. I think they would have realized around $70 million of Jup sales with fiat. But I think because of all the community backlash, they decided to pull the asset liquidity first and then, like, gradually pull the bit side liquidity, I think somewhere around $10 billion a week or something so that it would get pulled over the course of two months. So, yeah, this is what liquidity pull looks like right now. There still is some liquidity on the bid and a lot less on the ask after it happened, like, juke pumped maybe like 12%, 13% or something, but it's like, come back down. But, yeah, that's like, the status of this.
00:20:53.292 - 00:21:12.726, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, is it fair to say that, like, it hasn't been like a whole wholly successful launch? I mean, even when you're defending and you're in that position and you're making changes and, like, you know, having to be defensive and, like, is that already, like a sign that, you know, something went wrong or. What's the impression that you guys have?
00:21:12.790 - 00:21:41.882, Speaker D: My personal impression was that the juke team had a lot of community. Price is still pretty good. I thought the Jup team had a lot of community goodwill. Having not raised from VC's and having built just for a long time heads down without any intention of sort of launching a token. But this has definitely hurt their brand and their image on perceived griftiness. CT will probably forget in like few weeks. But, yeah, in the short term, it's not a good sentiment, I think, on.
00:21:41.898 - 00:22:13.922, Speaker A: Jup, I mean, it's clear the team is their grinders. They were grinding with no money during the bear market. So now that they have a war chest, I'm sure they will be trying to keep building. And I do think it's a little bit like Trump when he lost and lost a little bit of the aura that some of his fans had. When you take. Even if it's not a huge, you know, kind of like loss or swipe, it does change the, like, the aura of perfection that you had before. And the launch pad, I have to say, like, I.
00:22:13.922 - 00:22:37.966, Speaker A: I don't think it was very well designed from a game theory standpoint. This is really not how I would have gone about it. I know Evan, we brought him up about the sibilars. He was also quite critical, and I share some of the criticisms. I'll see how I express it to meow. I think I'm supposed to be on a panel with him next week or something. But, you know, I do think about this stuff a lot.
00:22:37.966 - 00:22:44.342, Speaker A: There's lessons to learn and, yeah, I think we'll have better mechanics than doing these type of pools.
00:22:44.518 - 00:23:03.324, Speaker C: Is there also some hindsight analysis where if the token pumps, then everyone's going to be happy, right? Only because the token is kind of down. It's like, oh, like there's a flawed mechanism, flawed design team is grifting. But if the token went up, maybe if they started a lower price, then everyone's going to be, you know, like, just you, fork. So there's also that element.
00:23:03.404 - 00:23:29.924, Speaker A: I mean, to be clear, it's at $5.5 billion for an app that barely existed a year ago, right? So it's all relative, it's all expectations. And just because, you know, he set the upper bound at seven, you know, seven 8 billion, and we're at 5.5 billion. Maybe the name of the game is like, make sure that you exceed your expectations. And just like, the perception that 5.5 is actually an amazing outcome, it's not down.
00:23:29.924 - 00:23:36.120, Speaker A: This is incredible. So it's all about your point of view, I guess. Yeah.
00:23:36.152 - 00:24:17.140, Speaker D: In the grand scheme of things, for sure, like 5.5 billion, excellent valuation. I shared something in the study labs chat if one of you wants to pull it up, but I did an analysis on just how new launches this past cycle. I've done, like, the big ones that have launched above billion FTV, and it's quite interesting to see how consistent the bleed is after 30 days after launch. So we analyzed around ten launches and there is an airdrop fractal, or the first day or two. On average, I think pumps maybe 2030, 40%. But after that pump hits and peak attention, peak hype subsides.
00:24:17.140 - 00:24:21.024, Speaker D: There's a really consistent bleed down across all these things we've looked at.
00:24:22.494 - 00:24:25.754, Speaker A: Wow. Ace. What happened to Ace? Just.
00:24:28.214 - 00:24:32.326, Speaker D: Got cantoed thinking, was this, was.
00:24:32.350 - 00:24:40.754, Speaker B: This inspired by the chart I had showed last week or the week before, about the prime time to sell airdrops? Is that why you made this, or is this just something you've been tracking?
00:24:42.814 - 00:24:52.854, Speaker D: I think that was factor. I've been trading a lot of these new launches. Yeah. Partially inspired by Justin. Yes.
00:24:53.634 - 00:25:04.694, Speaker A: I see you don't have Tia on the list and, you know, tia just kind of keep. Keep grinding to this all the time, I guess. Like, that one's that 1000% change, because I remember it was trading for $2.
00:25:07.794 - 00:25:08.986, Speaker B: Can I ask you a question about this?
00:25:09.010 - 00:25:09.774, Speaker C: Sticky.
00:25:10.394 - 00:25:30.484, Speaker B: When you're actively looking to put on a trade, are you going to take this information into consideration? Basically here, if you just short anything on the second or third day after its launch, you're going to obviously lose in some cases, but on average, you'll theoretically win. Is that something you would consider trading on, or is this just background information?
00:25:32.144 - 00:25:47.884, Speaker D: Yeah, we talked about this last week. I think you just long, like, the newest launch, and then when the next newest launch comes, you just short the launch and then buy the next launch. It's like this, like constantly rotating and front running other people's rotations.
00:25:48.864 - 00:25:49.632, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:25:49.728 - 00:26:26.460, Speaker A: I think these are like, kind of bayesian topics, you know, bayesian probability conditional, like, conditional that it's new launch and you're on the second day. You know, it skews probabilities. But I don't think that you would always short at that time. It just kind of changes your priors a little bit. But not to get to technical, I didn't want to touch on, you know, not exactly Tia, but Eigen layer. I saw some people, I think maybe Taiki, you had a tweet out there. There's been tweets out, you know, asking people, which one do you think is gonna trade at a higher valuation, like Tia or Eigen layer? And I saw the polls that had a lot of responses was around two thirds Eigen layer.
00:26:26.460 - 00:27:05.964, Speaker A: So I think the public perception is that it's a more complete suite of products. You know, it's not just data availability focused and a little bit larger. And also, there is a proof of TVL at this point. So the big topic of this week has been a little bit of a kind of rotation into ETH in order to then restake, because the window opened on February 5, and, boy, did they restake. Let's try to bring up the dashboard. Here we go. TvL, 2.1
00:27:05.964 - 00:27:15.024, Speaker A: million ETH. Not, not, not shabby. I think that is. You know, we're talking about five. Okay. $5.1 billion.
00:27:15.024 - 00:27:38.574, Speaker A: Yeah, it's, you know, it's got. At the time of recording, it's still open for a little bit longer. We see quite a lot of different types of ETH are available to be staked here. I see my. My biased mantle staked heath. There's 180,000, of which 100,000 from the treasury. So some airdrops coming to meth holders.
00:27:38.574 - 00:27:51.214, Speaker A: You know, I had to put that in there because there's somebody in our comments that said, last time, can we get through one episode without Jordy shilling meth? And the answer is no. If you're watching steady, lad, you'll get at least 10 seconds of a meth shill.
00:27:51.754 - 00:27:55.184, Speaker B: But you'll thank Jordy later. Right? They're going to be thankful later.
00:27:55.314 - 00:28:32.124, Speaker A: They will thank me later. We did crack a billion, so not. Not too bad for meth itself. Now it's quickly establishing ten figure floor now. But people are very bullish Eigen layer, they think it's going to be even bigger than Tia. We're seeing Tia trade at 20 billion fdd. So, Justin, you were talking last time that you've been farming layer points, you know, from very early on, is this five, 5 billion mean that there's going to be a lot of dilution of the points, or at this point, is it still worth it?
00:28:32.624 - 00:28:59.338, Speaker B: Yeah, there's. There's obviously been huge dilution incoming. Tough to say if it's still worth it. I would say yes, because if you're holding stake deep anyway, this seems like a decent enough place to put it, and you have decent enough security guarantees. But the real point of being early was that you were getting just such an outsized share of points versus what you would be getting now. And so, you know, if you got in six months ago, you'd have a much higher restake ratio than if you just enter now. That said, actually, I didn't know it was still open.
00:28:59.338 - 00:29:05.754, Speaker B: Probably after this call, I'll put some more in, maybe on the mantle side, too. So we'll see. But, yeah, I think it's still a viable place to be.
00:29:05.834 - 00:29:38.154, Speaker A: There's an interesting mechanic as well that's happening right now, which is like, people are betting on the size of the value of the points and it's all over the place. And basically, some apps like Pendle have just completely blown up as a vehicle to speculate on the price of what this airdrop is going to be worth. Because in essence, you have two sides. You have the people that are very bullish, and they're just trying to accumulate as much as they can. So they're buying these points in essence. Then you have somebody else who just has ETH, and they're being offered 30% APY. I mean, take, you're the farmer.
00:29:38.154 - 00:29:49.920, Speaker A: Have you been tempted by either side of this trade, or do you think it's fairly priced at this point? I'm seeing Etherfi and, and Pendle kind of have this marriage that has driven up TVL a lot.
00:29:50.032 - 00:30:14.160, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, Justin, if you can pull up my screen, I just have the TVL on Pendle, and it's insane. I mean, I guess I could kind of zoom in on the recent growth, but, I mean, it's been literally up only since the beginning of the year. We had like quarter of a billion. Now it's basically at a billion. And if you think about from a degen's point of view.
00:30:14.192 - 00:30:14.312, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:14.328 - 00:30:53.614, Speaker C: It's like it. You stake your ETH, and then you restake your ETH, and then there's all these liquid restaking options, which is all also offering points. So if you wanted to earn yield on top of yield on top of yield, then, yeah. Like, you might not liquid restake your Eid, then LP on Pendle to receive pendle emissions yield, like, from people trading. And, you know, this is definitely, like, positive for, I think, for eigen layer. I think, you know, Tia trading at 20 billion, that's also good for aging layer. I mean, from, like, an ETH Maxi's perspective, you also kind of want TIa to, like, just keep going up, because it also pushes up the implied vow of eigen lair, which I think will also create some mass, mass wealth effect.
00:30:56.794 - 00:30:57.266, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:57.330 - 00:30:59.014, Speaker C: Why do you say that? Why do you say that?
00:30:59.674 - 00:31:04.694, Speaker D: I don't know. It seems like Jody doesn't believe in the TIA.
00:31:05.064 - 00:31:05.844, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:07.144 - 00:31:08.524, Speaker C: Are you getting squeezed?
00:31:09.584 - 00:31:37.784, Speaker A: No, thankfully not. But I have to say 20 billion seems a little bit premature. Not sure how sustainable. And I think the main thing is what we've talked in the past, that once these prime air drops of dimension and things are in the past, you have to actually subtract that out of the valuation. So if a big part of the t evaluation was getting these, like, early prime air drops, those are gone. So what happens after that? I don't know.
00:31:38.084 - 00:31:39.024, Speaker D: Dividend.
00:31:39.364 - 00:31:40.220, Speaker A: Dividends.
00:31:40.332 - 00:31:51.184, Speaker B: Also, is it fair to say that Tia no longer benefits from new coin? Good. It's an old coin, right? Like, it's a 2023 story. Is it? Does it still have that benefit and that tailwind thicky?
00:31:52.364 - 00:32:12.494, Speaker D: I'm not sure. I haven't really looked into it. I will say that, like, back in December, tike hedged his ti. It was at $12, and I said it was shorting it, and now it's up 50% from there. And I'm still hedged my ta, paying 60% a year in funding trying to get out of it. So I was definitely the sucker on that trade.
00:32:13.274 - 00:32:14.450, Speaker A: Ouch. Yeah.
00:32:14.482 - 00:32:23.934, Speaker C: And it's not even an old coin. It came out in November, like, three months ago. So maybe crypto de agents have such little attention spans.
00:32:24.394 - 00:32:26.574, Speaker A: Yeah. New coins are, like, one or two weeks.
00:32:27.474 - 00:32:28.454, Speaker C: I guess so.
00:32:28.874 - 00:33:06.928, Speaker A: Yeah. So, I mean, another thing is, like, I've been seeing some of my chats. People are starting to worry about, like, 2008 style rehypothecation, because a lot of these puffer and, like, go to pendle, and you take the points and you restake them, but you're just wrapping, wrapping, wrapping, and, like, there is like an economic security of ethereum at the very bottom. But if any part of this chain breaks, there could be, like, you know, these, like, holes left in different balance sheets all over the place. And I don't think we're quite there yet. I haven't seen anything that's, like, made my heart stop in terms of big, big risk. But I can see that we're getting close.
00:33:06.928 - 00:33:21.364, Speaker A: I mean, there are people starting to want to do perps and leverage on restaking yields, stuff like that. Definitely reminds me of some of the scenes in the big short. Are any of you guys worried at all, or is it just some of my tradfi chats?
00:33:21.704 - 00:33:52.234, Speaker B: I think from an intellectual or theoretical perspective, it is worrisome. But I think, you know, they talk a lot about the social layer. The fact of the matter is, I think even at this point, like, even if Eigen layer got exploited, they'd probably have to roll back the chain. I mean, that's like five plus billion dollars of ETH. No one wants to talk about that. But, like, are you going to let one exploiter hold all that? Ethan? It's not even large yet, right? Like, imagine if steak DTH is much more of a risk, right? Steak d is a huge percentage of the network. We'd have to roll back the chain if it got, you know, critically exploited.
00:33:52.234 - 00:34:01.862, Speaker B: So I think theoretically, it's not good, and it adds another risk to ethereum. But at the end of the day, like, they're. They can just roll back the chain and they probably would have to.
00:34:01.958 - 00:34:07.302, Speaker A: I'm not sure they would roll back, to be honest. I think Vitalik has been pretty adamant about it.
00:34:07.438 - 00:34:13.998, Speaker B: But what about for Steaktief? Like, at that size, 20% of all ETH, let's say. Sorry, 10% of all ETH?
00:34:14.086 - 00:34:38.724, Speaker A: I think it would be more of a shit show because the reality is the underlying ethnic is in the validator's hands, and it takes days to unstake. And you would have time to, like, you know, freeze contracts and do all kinds of stuff. It would. It would. It would be messy, but I don't think it would be like a complete loss of. Of that amount. And so it would just be like, holes in certain people's balance sheets and certain liquidity pools will obviously get drained.
00:34:38.724 - 00:34:41.120, Speaker A: Things will move on. We've. We've seen worse.
00:34:41.272 - 00:35:04.004, Speaker C: I feel. I feel like a lot of people love to talk about, you know, this 2008 style crash that's going to happen in 2025, that's going to destroy the bull market. But I feel like there's also this element that people love to talk about it, to claim clout. But I think you can have to bet on the team to manage risk and whatnot. But maybe I'm just putting too much faith on, I guess, the dgens and.
00:35:04.044 - 00:35:07.704, Speaker A: Eigen Lair, steady lads, deploying more capital.
00:35:09.824 - 00:35:11.984, Speaker D: I think a crash is bullish, and I welcome it.
00:35:12.064 - 00:35:37.218, Speaker A: You know, the one thing I'm saying I was thinking the other day, though, is, like, there is, like, a little bit of a redemption, at least, you know, high stakes. Cap was saying, you know, others are leaving FTX, and I'm depositing more. I was looking at the claims, and they're starting to trade at 80%. So depending on if he held crypto or dollars, maybe it's not so bad and things can move on. Cool. Let's. Let's move on to our pasta of the week segment.
00:35:37.218 - 00:35:39.662, Speaker A: I have mine ready. I don't know about you guys.
00:35:39.838 - 00:35:41.350, Speaker B: Kick us off. Jordy.
00:35:41.542 - 00:36:10.474, Speaker A: I have a tweet by Kyle Davies. So three AC comeback. This was. I like it when people make fun of themselves, and it's kind of like, you know, play with what's going on with the fud. But you're saying ox is back at the OpenX MSM fud level. If we can reclaim the prison resistance, there's a nice gap in the ta, so just. This might be my favorite chart.
00:36:10.474 - 00:36:47.460, Speaker A: I know we had Andre on, and Andre was, like, painting the charts on the skylines and stuff, but talking about, like, prison resistance and, you know, kind of making light of some of these situations. Well played to Kyle. And I think, you know, what openx is doing is pretty dgen. They have, like, this new thing where you're able to trade perps, and instead of being USDT perps, they're denominated in ox, I think. So your leverage is, like, moving in fluctuation with the coin. So if the coin goes down, you get liquidated, even if you're right in the position and then reverse.
00:36:47.492 - 00:36:47.956, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:36:48.020 - 00:37:01.068, Speaker A: It's pretty crazy. Maybe we need to get Suzu on. I see he's starting to do podcasts, so maybe we'll try to get him on in the next week or two, explain to us what's going on, and maybe give us some of these prison stories that we've been hearing about.
00:37:01.196 - 00:37:02.676, Speaker C: Is anyone long? This coin?
00:37:02.820 - 00:37:09.068, Speaker A: You know, I went into the telegram chat, and there's. There's a community there.
00:37:09.116 - 00:37:09.380, Speaker C: I don't.
00:37:09.412 - 00:37:41.920, Speaker B: I don't know what kind of I can go next. I have two entries, but I'm only going to do one because I've sort of been cheating by, by, by submitting too many entries. So I've got here a video. It's of a chinese influencer. Apparently she only spends like less than 2 seconds showing each product and makes like $7 million a day doing it. And the caption is ansem tweeting out meme coin tickers. As someone that's not, like, following too closely on the Solana meme coin space, this is like, very much what it looks like from the outside of, like, new coin.
00:37:41.920 - 00:37:53.168, Speaker B: Like, new coin. Good. Move it along. One day later, new coin, good. Moving along. And he and everyone else doing that whole thing is just printing capital now. So I thought that was good fun.
00:37:53.336 - 00:38:06.298, Speaker A: You know, it's not only impressive how quickly she is, like, flipping them, but also, I imagine, like, the devs that are giving her the new, the new product they're just shipping so quickly as well. I mean, that's also very impressive. The off camera heroes.
00:38:06.346 - 00:38:14.034, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll defend Ansem. I don't think he's like, I don't think he's like a pump and dumper. I think he's just a prolific bull poster. For sure.
00:38:14.154 - 00:38:14.666, Speaker B: For sure.
00:38:14.730 - 00:38:15.306, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:15.450 - 00:38:17.522, Speaker B: Taiki, I have yours up. Do you want to go next?
00:38:17.658 - 00:38:34.420, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So this really hit a chord with me just because I'm also a farmer slash airdrop farmer. And, you know, this is from rain. Final words to my family. And it's this old guy. Don't forget to go into my leap wallet and unstake my tia. That's going to take 21 days.
00:38:34.420 - 00:38:54.648, Speaker C: Also, don't forget to unstake your eat or my eat from Eigen layer. That's going to take seven days. Then head over to Manta. You have to withdraw my USDC and eat after it gets repegged, then go over to hyper liquid. It's like this constant. Yeah. Like portfolio management of just like, having to deal with all these positions.
00:38:54.648 - 00:39:10.472, Speaker C: There's like the seven or 21 day unbond or unstaking period. And I also thought to myself, like, if I'm ever, like, in a situation where I'm gonna die, like, I don't even know what I'm gonna tell, like, my family and, like, my partner and what stuff, like, they're gonna have no idea what to do.
00:39:10.648 - 00:39:29.512, Speaker B: And I feel this completely, like, you know, back in defi summer days, you just ape into, like, some simple uni v two style farm and, like, not can you go in and out whenever you want, not worry about it too much. But now you need, like, a spreadsheet tracking your unlock days, where your. What platforms you're at. Zapper links, multiple wallets to Sybil attack.
00:39:29.568 - 00:39:29.800, Speaker A: It's.
00:39:29.832 - 00:39:31.032, Speaker B: It's getting out of hand.
00:39:31.168 - 00:39:34.004, Speaker C: Yeah, but, no, we're in the trenches. This is what it takes.
00:39:34.344 - 00:39:58.354, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, just like, as AI is taking away certain jobs, I think there's going to be new jobs for, like, online defi degens that work at, you know, liquidation services for people who, you know, their will require somebody to go into their wallets and unstake and go to different bridges and get all their coins. I mean, this is where we're heading, right? Like, there will be a job for somebody.
00:39:58.694 - 00:40:00.074, Speaker D: I'm hiring for that.
00:40:00.614 - 00:40:01.394, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:01.934 - 00:40:04.514, Speaker D: If anyone wants to do that for me, like, let me know.
00:40:05.454 - 00:40:10.310, Speaker C: I know a fund that, like, literally hired someone just to airdrop farm, you know, I mean, why wouldn't they, right?
00:40:10.342 - 00:40:13.822, Speaker D: Most funds. Most funds have. Most funds have a person that does that.
00:40:13.958 - 00:40:21.878, Speaker B: Well, what's the model? You get, like, the actual worker gets, like, 5% of the return or something like that. Commission base, or.
00:40:22.046 - 00:40:35.634, Speaker D: I think they just get paid salary. And the issue, liquid funds, they have so much capital, and, like, you know, airdrop farm is a good way to get, like, 30, 40, 50% on it. Like, it's, like, free. You just have to, like, go on their discord, stick around, and then, like, put the capital in.
00:40:36.014 - 00:40:42.608, Speaker A: So thicky. We've had pretty strong entrants. I don't know. Do you have anything? It's going to be up to scratch. Let's see.
00:40:42.736 - 00:40:56.204, Speaker D: Mine is a tweet by Jordy. I love this. I love this face. Every time I see it, I just cackle you. Scroll out to the face. His face is so funny.
00:40:57.064 - 00:40:57.568, Speaker A: How many.
00:40:57.616 - 00:41:00.564, Speaker D: How many takes did it take you to make that face? I'm curious.
00:41:01.584 - 00:41:03.044, Speaker A: I think three takes.
00:41:03.744 - 00:41:09.952, Speaker B: This is just an organic picture Jordy had posted to Instagram, and he, you know, re hypothecated it for his meth meme.
00:41:10.048 - 00:41:11.564, Speaker D: He always looks like that.
00:41:12.734 - 00:41:35.878, Speaker A: I did. I mean, this was one of the contest contestants in the meme contest actually made this. I did not make this. I made the original version. I think it was, like, six months ago, and I. It was around the balaji time, and I said, they don't know that bitcoin is going to $1 million. That was a very successful shitpost at the time, but somebody used it for.
00:41:35.878 - 00:41:43.364, Speaker A: For the contest, so, you know, I have to say, vicki, you did not disappoint.
00:41:45.024 - 00:41:46.128, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the strategy.
00:41:46.176 - 00:41:47.184, Speaker D: That's the strategy.
00:41:47.264 - 00:41:53.884, Speaker A: Okay. I think Justin's was strong. Tyky's also strong.
00:41:54.264 - 00:42:06.256, Speaker B: I'm learning, you guys. And might I say, I think going forward we should also allow entries from Warpcast or whatever the thingy is called that everyone's moving to the forecaster Farcaster. Yeah.
00:42:06.280 - 00:42:07.136, Speaker C: Has anyone used it or.
00:42:07.160 - 00:42:13.368, Speaker B: No, I. Yeah, I use it all, all the time. Most of crypto Twitter has moved over, actually. You got to try everything, you guys.
00:42:13.416 - 00:42:16.864, Speaker A: There's going to be a big air drop, new thing. I mean, it's a default.
00:42:16.904 - 00:42:19.192, Speaker B: Yes, there's going to be an airdrop.
00:42:19.368 - 00:42:21.000, Speaker D: All the devs moved over.
00:42:21.192 - 00:42:21.568, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:21.616 - 00:42:32.392, Speaker A: So is the coin degen, like officially the coin of this thing or it's just like, I heard it's like a meme coin. It's just vaguely associated or is there any usage of Degen?
00:42:32.528 - 00:42:36.244, Speaker B: I've not actually heard of that. I know there's no official coin yet, though.
00:42:36.984 - 00:42:41.364, Speaker C: I think it's the meme coin that's on base that people are just speculating on.
00:42:41.904 - 00:42:48.312, Speaker A: Okay, well, Justin will get rich off of some Degen airdrop.
00:42:48.488 - 00:42:54.056, Speaker B: Maybe we'll do a demo of Farcaster next week. There's an app. I'll show you guys the app. It'll be fun. Stay tuned.
00:42:54.160 - 00:42:59.214, Speaker A: I have heard it's mostly, is it like Ethereum maxis that have moved over or is it like a wide.
00:42:59.344 - 00:43:19.698, Speaker B: It is sort of maxi aligned. Right? It's Ethereum aligned. So everyone that's involved in Ethereum is trying to like, pitch this as the use case of why everyone should be using l, two s and base. But the truth of the matter is, it's actually a good app. It's. They actually did a good job with it. So we'll see if crypto Twitter as a whole migrates over.
00:43:19.698 - 00:43:30.790, Speaker B: But basically all of your favorite Ethereum aligned people are all on there posting twenty four seven and not posting on Twitter as much. But like, let's say the Solana community, I haven't seen them on there as much.
00:43:30.942 - 00:43:35.894, Speaker A: I mean, there's going to be some app that just posts on both at the same time. Right? Like you connect the two and it just automatically.
00:43:36.014 - 00:43:48.678, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I will say, like credit to them. It's not just a Twitter or X Fork. Like they've actually added some new features. Like they have communities in it. They have, they have some cool stuff. Like they actually did innovate.
00:43:48.846 - 00:44:06.008, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah. I mean, I never liked it when the liquidity gets fragmented. Uh, in this way. I remember when threads came out and, you know, there was, like, a couple weeks where people went there. But, you know, if it sticks and it's a good product, you know, I'll. I'll definitely be willing to check this one out.
00:44:06.008 - 00:44:09.568, Speaker A: Feel. It feels a little bit more organic this time. Yes.
00:44:09.656 - 00:44:11.920, Speaker C: So, who won? Jordy, you can be the judge.
00:44:12.112 - 00:44:18.484, Speaker A: I think I, you know. Oh, Vicki. I'm kind of equal.
00:44:18.824 - 00:44:22.784, Speaker D: Jordi, you know what you got to do. I can't say anything.
00:44:22.824 - 00:44:25.724, Speaker B: I'm on a win streak, so I don't know. I don't know what to say.
00:44:26.384 - 00:44:32.744, Speaker A: All right, Justin's. Justin's was probably, like, a little bit more catchy. So, Justin, you are in a win streak.
00:44:32.864 - 00:44:35.364, Speaker B: You win again with the commenters can decide, too.
00:44:36.744 - 00:44:45.784, Speaker A: Cool. All right. Yeah. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining. We'll try to get a fun guest soon, and we will see you next week. Take care.
