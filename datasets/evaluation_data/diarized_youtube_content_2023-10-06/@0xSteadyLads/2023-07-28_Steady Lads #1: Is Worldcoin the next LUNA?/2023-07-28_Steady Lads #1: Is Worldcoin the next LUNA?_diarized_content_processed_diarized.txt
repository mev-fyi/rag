00:00:11.960 - 00:00:12.576, Speaker A: Hello everyone.
00:00:12.662 - 00:00:32.186, Speaker B: Welcome to the inaugural episode of Steady Lads. So, my name is Justin. I'm the co founder of Astaria. I also have a defi focused YouTube channel. I'm joined by Taiki. He is a humble farmer and influencer. He's a pretty prolific YouTube channel in this space going over yield farm, yield farming.
00:00:32.186 - 00:01:04.654, Speaker B: We also have Jordy. He's a full time game theorizer. He is the CIO of Selena Capital, a multi strategy hedge fund. And last but not least, we have Alex, who is a junior analyst at Scimitar Capital and also a prolific threader. So welcome everyone. I think the big news that we want to discuss today is right before this piece podcast started recording, we got these GDP numbers that us GDP growth was, I think something like 2.4% annualized over the last quarter, which is obviously pretty impressive.
00:01:04.654 - 00:01:15.954, Speaker B: I think that's good news. I think that means that a recession is not imminent. But let's start with you, Jordy. What are your thoughts? Is this. Is this bullish? Or is good news good news now? Or is good news bad news? What are your thoughts?
00:01:16.534 - 00:01:35.594, Speaker C: I think we're at the point where there's not much expectation of further rate hikes. We just got one yesterday. Maybe we get one more, but that's it. So good news is good news right now. And I think the equity markets are showing it crypto. Not as much, but hopefully at some point the boomers throw some of their shekels to us and we can kind of pump our bags as well.
00:01:35.974 - 00:02:02.822, Speaker D: Yeah, it kind of feels like 30k is like fair value for bitcoin. There's not that many buyers above. Not that many sellers below. There's not that much like new retail interest. Like, I was kind of hoping the XRP news would bring in more retail and like maybe bid our altcoin bags. But I feel like the current bidders of altcoins, they don't really care whether coins are securities or not. It just seems like there's not that much like, overall interest in crypto.
00:02:02.998 - 00:02:38.916, Speaker B: Yeah. Why do you think that is? Just people got burnt last year and it takes time. I mean, I find myself doubting this idea that we could just live in these four year cycles and that there's always going to be another cycle and it always has to happen on the same timeframe. It almost seems too easy, right? Like when everyone's expecting something in a market. Like, how can that be true? How is it true? I guess, Alex, I would throw this to you. How is it true that we can just live under the assumption that starting in January, retail interest will pick up again, and we'll be in this, you know, the start of a new bull market. I mean, the having can't really matter, right? Like, going from 2% to 1%.
00:02:38.916 - 00:02:44.116, Speaker B: Inflation is sort of, in my opinion, it didn't do anything for ETH. Right? Yeah.
00:02:44.220 - 00:03:31.154, Speaker A: I think it's like, an interesting coordination point for people just to throw money into the asset space. I think historically, it has coincided with new innovation entering the space, and I think the current state of innovation, at least in the crypto markets and the crypto tech stack, there hasn't been anything that new from last cycle. I guess the uniswap innovation of giving liquidity to long tail assets, something of that kind of scale, hasn't really, like, attracted, you know, new capital in is, like, my opinion. So I think that's the reason why there's, like, a laggard effect right now in crypto compared to equities and risk. But, like, we have seen signs of froth in the equities market, like, slowly beginning to inch back in. So, as Joey said, like, maybe they'll start throwing, like, their. Their winnings into the crypto casino again.
00:03:31.274 - 00:03:51.710, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm curious. Do you guys all think we need something new to kick things off again? Like, so we had defy summer, kicked off a massive bull run, and then that sort of faded, right? But NFTs propped us up. That's my theory, at least, and created all of this demand for ETH. I mean, do we need a new thing at the scale of defined NFTs just to start a new cycle, or.
00:03:51.782 - 00:03:57.674, Speaker C: Will we got worldcoin? What do you think about Worldcoin? That's pretty new.
00:03:58.374 - 00:04:22.080, Speaker B: Yeah. I wanted to talk about this because, um, I was having a chat with some other crypto friends, and we were just sort of debating, like, is world coin a scam because the tokenomics are scamming, or is it a real project? I'm sort of. Of the mindset that you have to separate the project from the tokenomics. Um, and I think that. I mean, I think this is a real project. I don't think Sam Altman would risk it all, so to speak. Right.
00:04:22.080 - 00:04:32.906, Speaker B: He's got a lot going on. He's certainly, like, a, you know, prolific person in the tech space. Why would he risk risk at all on a scam project? It's just meant to dump on retail. It doesn't really make sense to me.
00:04:33.010 - 00:05:07.390, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I definitely don't think it's a scam. It's not an intended scam, but at the same time, when you're dealing with cryptocurrency, if the currency part is misdesigned, then your project is crap, regardless of your intentions. So, yeah, I don't think he's. He's obviously a very wealthy individual that could maximize his wealth through OpenAI. And I think his motivations might be different. But, I mean, we should dig into the details of the tokenomics and what the project is. But I don't know.
00:05:07.390 - 00:05:08.514, Speaker C: What do you guys think?
00:05:09.134 - 00:05:42.966, Speaker D: Yeah, I think more about it from a retail perspective. Like, capital inflows. This is kind of like a mass onboarding process where it's like, if you think about it, maybe you meet. If you think about, like, I don't know, like, doing something with your friends, like, this is something you can do. It's like, hey, like, instead of getting lunch, like, let's scan our eyeballs and make, like, $50 or something. And I think I saw videos of some iris, like, the orb line at, like, new York. Like, there's, like, an hour long wait, and people are, like, just spending, like, 20 seconds per eyeball and, like, just, you know, doing all that.
00:05:42.966 - 00:06:14.884, Speaker D: And, like, if it's also built on the base chain, it can also, like, create new wallets. Um, so I feel like it's kind of priming retail on, like, the entire market of, like, okay. Like, it's okay to own a crypto wallet? Oh. Like, there's actually, like, I have, like, $40 on chain or something along those lines. Um, so I think that part is bullish, but I don't really think, like, the design of world coin is meant to be, like, some. Something that, like, supposed to be investable. Like, I don't think Sam Altman's, like, trying to make world coins something to, like, make people, like, super rich, right? It's just trying to be, like, this Ubi coin.
00:06:14.884 - 00:06:25.204, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the token is, like, pretty insane. It's like, most coins are going to market makers. And last time I checked, it was, like, a $30 billion FDB or something. Or maybe it was higher.
00:06:25.544 - 00:07:02.268, Speaker B: But let me ask you guys this, right? Like, if the goal is to be a UBI and they want to distribute, like, a reasonable amount of money to people monthly, do these tokenomics not make sense? Right? Do you not want to start with a low float coin that will give, like, the initial people that have signed up? Like, I think it's something like $50 a month for. For doing it. By the way, as a side note, tomorrow I actually have an appointment to scan my eyeballs, so I'm not. Yeah, I'm not concerned about the privacy issues. I mean, I use Face ID 20 times a day on my iPhone with Microsoft Surface laptops. I've used their Face ID or scanning product. I have global entry.
00:07:02.268 - 00:07:11.104, Speaker B: So like when I go through the airport, there's some facial recognition. Like, I don't think this is the place to draw the line, if that makes sense. I think this is something worth trying as a user.
00:07:12.604 - 00:08:01.124, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, I think I almost view, I guess in response to your tokenomics point, I almost feel like these crypto projects as trying to create a network effect. And I guess you can almost view it as economy. Like a nation state where the total value of the token is maybe their gdp. And I think at the end of the day, a strong token price will attract, I guess, immigrants to your state. And we see this issue with Seoul where because of Solana, because of the huge, I guess, overhang of FTX supply, it's been hard to convince people to move essentially to that country and go in and build Solana, learn a new language and basically immigrate to the country. It does have a huge effect.
00:08:01.124 - 00:08:43.954, Speaker A: Making sure that tokenomics is like very, you know, set well from the very beginning, in my opinion, is something that like, I think we've learned from the previous cycle is like, this thing can really bite you in the ass if you give away too many tokens in a concentrated amount to like, actors that aren't aligned with you. So in a way, like opening up this project in a way that like, market makers that are very aligned because of their call option, we can dig into like the exact details later just for the readers that aren't familiar with it. But yeah, the market makers that hold 100 million tokens out of the 110 million circulating, they're very aligned to keep the price up, which will attract new users. And they can basically have the only source of supply come in as like new users that are onboarding and scanning their irises, essentially.
00:08:45.014 - 00:09:04.534, Speaker B: Yeah. I found this, this thread from Matt here. If anyone wants to chime in, feel free to. But you can see some of the metrics here. So 43 million world coins were airdropped. 100 million world coins were loaned over three months to non us market makers. So you can see here that market makers control 95% of the float at launch.
00:09:04.534 - 00:09:12.034, Speaker B: Anything you guys want to add there regarding details? I mean, certainly that's a very high outlier, right, relative to other token launches.
00:09:13.574 - 00:09:40.310, Speaker C: I mean, it's true that they've set a benchmark price starting from $2. And we do see that the price is by some magic, you know, trading around $2, a bit over $2. So there's definitely an effect of that. Now whether this is, you know, the important part of the project, I don't think it really matters. You know, it's a three month loan. It's not like this is the long term holders. This is kind of like the temporary games being played.
00:09:40.310 - 00:10:21.508, Speaker C: And I'm sure there's some heavy bags that can get made if this thing starts to pump and people start like gamma hedging because they don't have to return the tokens. Basically like at $2.80 they can keep all the tokens and just pay back $2.80 per token. So if you sell some at four or $5, you've, you know, you've made millions of dollars. So, you know, that aside, I have a lot of concerns about this project. And, you know, people I've called out, let's say like Olympusdao and Axie and Luna in the past, and people always ask me like, you know, what's the new, what's the next one? And for months now I haven't had something to like point to, but now I do.
00:10:21.508 - 00:10:49.916, Speaker C: So I think world coin potentially will be the next Luna. And the reason I say this is like, you have a similar thing where it just tries to make money out of nothing. Like base money. What is base money? Oh, it's world coin. It's like a new currency. And like what? Exactly? Like what is backing this? Like, who's going to be on the bid of this thing? It's very unclear. It's basically like VC's and people that see that there's, you know, millions of people signed up and so you kind of have this like VC inflow.
00:10:49.916 - 00:11:25.440, Speaker C: This is exactly what happened with Axie though. Like third world country civilians were making $50, which is a lot of money for them by participating and making metrics look good, which then get passed on to VC's. Not to shit on any VC's in particular, but this to me seems like the kind of thing that can grow into a bubble and then just burst when people realize this thing is not backed by government and it's not bitcoin, which is, you know, digital gold, it's just, it's just some random coin. Like what are we doing? Exactly.
00:11:25.592 - 00:11:44.136, Speaker B: So is your point like there is some value in bringing identity on chain and being like the base layer for that which is what they're doing. But it's not even close to the 23 billion fully diluted valuation that world coin is sitting at. Is that the theory, like, there's something here, but, like, it just doesn't make sense at this valuation or.
00:11:44.240 - 00:12:21.430, Speaker C: No, my theory is like, this doesn't need a token. Like, if, if it's a technology company that is giving other companies, it's a b two B company that says, hey, like, we've scanned a billion people's eyeballs. If you want to interact with them in a way that's like civil resistant in the digital world, you do airdrops or things like this. You know, you can do it through our system and, you know, we'll charge you, you know, 20 bips and you can do whatever you want. That's a great business. Doesn't need a token, right? Like, sure, the point, the point of the token is to give investors money back, maybe, but so then that's all. I'm kind of also okay with that because you're funding, you're funding the whole thing.
00:12:21.430 - 00:12:58.426, Speaker C: But the problem I have is this Ubi vision. Like, first of all, it's very, I don't know, like it's kind of imagining this world in the future where some AI has made countless wealth and we need to redistribute it to everybody because, like, everyone's poor and like some Altman and like, elon, damn it, you know, have like $100 trillion and everybody else has nothing. And then as our overlords are kind of like sprinkling in some WLD coins, whatever, to people, this is the only thing that makes sense. Right? And it's like a hedge for that.
00:12:58.450 - 00:12:59.774, Speaker A: Isn't that kind of beautiful?
00:13:01.174 - 00:13:27.654, Speaker C: Sure. I mean, I don't think it's a reality. I think what's going to happen is like, the US government and the chinese government are going to start, you know, making these technologies classified, and it's going to be like some kind of cold war stuff. And the governments themselves will control the wealth. You know, like, they have the military and they have, like, the intelligence agencies. So if they decide to give money to their people, they're going to do it through their cbdcs. They're not going to give it to, like, people in other countries.
00:13:27.654 - 00:13:30.334, Speaker C: I don't know. That's how I see it.
00:13:30.634 - 00:13:49.210, Speaker A: They can't airdrop it in a lot of restricted countries, including the US right now. So, like, I guess they've, they've basically explicitly stated, we're not going to touch your citizens. Um, but I kind of view it as a way, as like, oh, I'm going to build, like, a Nate, like, Sam Altman is going to build a nation state. And these, like, the financial rails where he can distribute, like, money to his, his serfs.
00:13:49.402 - 00:13:52.894, Speaker C: Is it his money? Like, whose money is it? Like, who's going to be on the bid?
00:13:53.634 - 00:14:15.094, Speaker A: I mean, if you control the supply tight enough and you create like, a meme that's strong enough, then, like, eventually it will have value, right? As a token. I started off with, like, a very pessimistic view. When I shorted, like, world coin at like 2.5 ish, I covered it too. And then I started thinking, like, when it didn't go down, when it did break down from two, I was thinking like, you know what, maybe, like, maybe this thing has a future. I don't know.
00:14:15.914 - 00:14:39.554, Speaker D: I guess like, bubble swarm, when you don't know how to, like, value something, right? Like, Jodi, would you be more for it if for example, instead of tokens, it was like a soul bound nfT where. Or like a soul bound token where you can't really transfer it. After you verify your identity, you get this NFT or soulbound token and that kind of verifies your identity. Do you think that's a better model? And they just did a token for a VC exit.
00:14:40.254 - 00:15:35.498, Speaker C: That's a better model. The currency aspect is my main concern. This thing can start gaining monetary value because nobody still has figured out exactly why does ETH have monetary value, but not Solana? Like, you know, there's these things that we're still kind of figuring out as a community, as a society, as a digital natives, and it has the potential to start, like, bubbling up or people think, like, what matters is, you know, number of holders, and it has billion holders at some point. So it just has value. And I have a concern around, like, the volatility of the price and why are we creating a, you know, a situation where, I don't know if you've seen, but people are selling other people's eyeballs now. Like, you know, if, if I want to go around, like, my village and scan everyone and then package that up and like, sell it to, like, hedge funds, like, in New York, they want to. Oh, I'm just going to, you know, today we did a tranche.
00:15:35.498 - 00:15:47.254, Speaker C: We, we bought a tranche of 500,000 prime, prime eyeballs from Southeast Asia. Like, that can happen, right? Like, this is kind of what we're designing.
00:15:47.874 - 00:15:56.134, Speaker D: That's not bad though, right? Like, if, like, these 500,000 people, like, make some money if they opt in. I mean, I don't know how the court.
00:15:56.754 - 00:16:02.214, Speaker B: Right. If world court actually works, then they've lost the ability to participate, right? So.
00:16:02.594 - 00:16:03.650, Speaker D: I guess so, yeah.
00:16:03.722 - 00:16:14.508, Speaker B: It seems like an unsolvable problem. I agree with that. It's like, an extremely complex problem of how do you. Yes. You can prove that someone's a human, but you can't prove that they still own that account. Right. That's sort of like the.
00:16:14.508 - 00:16:32.436, Speaker B: In my opinion, like, one of the biggest issues with self custody. Right? Like, we can't all be issued a private key at birth, whether it's with world coin or some government chain, because you can lose your keys, right? Or you can sell your identity. So it seems like. I just don't know how they're gonna go about solving that. And it doesn't seem like they have a plan yet.
00:16:32.500 - 00:16:41.184, Speaker A: Don't you just have to keep scanning your eyeball? Just. Can I just, like, do a photo recognition of your eyeball from the app and just make it so that every time you want to sign a transaction, just scan your eyeball?
00:16:42.164 - 00:16:47.772, Speaker B: I wasn't aware if that's what they're doing, but that seems like a smart plan. I don't know, Jordy, you're shaking your head.
00:16:47.908 - 00:17:10.976, Speaker C: Well, I mean, that means they need to keep scanning you and verifying, like, you know, then you start getting to the privacy in the data aspect. It's definitely not. It makes sense. Like, what are you saying would be better as, like, a wallet kind of thing. But, you know, right now, I think my design is, like, they. They don't keep that data where they. Where they can keep reverifying, right?
00:17:11.040 - 00:17:14.776, Speaker A: Oh, they say they delete the eyeball data, right? Okay.
00:17:14.920 - 00:17:16.664, Speaker B: But they have some unique identifiers.
00:17:16.704 - 00:17:25.004, Speaker C: All the app would tell you is that, like, you are part of the program, but they don't know if it's the same person that scanned it today or tomorrow.
00:17:26.144 - 00:17:49.258, Speaker D: Would it be able to offer, like, under collateralized lending? Like, if your digital identity is under a certain bucket and you verify that you're a good actor in this space and you have x dollars of wealth, then can that enable other use cases of crypto that currently is unsolved? Because right now, under collateralized lending, it only works for KYC parties.
00:17:49.306 - 00:18:10.336, Speaker C: It wouldn't help. I mean, all this does. You can read Vitalik's post about this, but it's just kind of like a binary. Like, yes, no. Has this person scanned their eyeballs? The soul band NFT idea that you have you know, is maybe more aligned with starting to differentiate different types of NFTs and different types of behavior. But no, this wouldn't help on that side.
00:18:10.520 - 00:18:41.354, Speaker B: Also, to Jordy's earlier point, right? If you can sell your identity, which people will do, and I'm sure I've actually read reports that people have done that, right, then you can, you know, like, you could imagine someone that's a scammer buying up a, you know, a thousand different scans, trying to see what under collateralized loans they can get, and then once they're on chain, there's, you know, nothing keeping them there. So just dip out. But, Alex, you were saying us people are blocked. When I scan my eyeballs tomorrow, does that mean I'm not getting the $50 stimulus each month or what's happening?
00:18:43.014 - 00:18:47.382, Speaker A: I can go verify, but, like, I thought us citizens weren't allowed to scan their eyeballs.
00:18:47.478 - 00:18:57.574, Speaker C: Or you can scan, but you don't get the coin because it's securities law. It's. It's not. You can scan. I think you can be part of it, but, yeah, you might not get your $52.50.
00:18:58.474 - 00:19:01.138, Speaker A: So, no, 25 for you.
00:19:01.226 - 00:19:17.586, Speaker B: So they. They match the identity to a nation state, then? Because I thought they were just, like, scanning your eyeball and there's some unique identifier attached to it, and it gets paired with your world quite app account. But you're telling me I can't just run a VPN on my phone and. But that they always know I'm a us citizen or us resident?
00:19:17.690 - 00:19:23.974, Speaker C: I mean, you're the only one out of us that's going to do it. So you. You're the expert tomorrow. You know.
00:19:26.034 - 00:19:29.854, Speaker B: You might be forced to. If this is the income of the world in the future.
00:19:30.474 - 00:19:55.420, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, if. If this is supposed to be an inequality project, I understand the sentiment. Like, I've been talking about inequality being, like, the topic of the next ten years consistently, and I really believe that this is. This is going to be a huge problem. And actually, like, all these GDP numbers we talked about and stuff, this is just because they've created more inequality. They've backstopped the banks, all the bond buying one to one par.
00:19:55.420 - 00:20:24.924, Speaker C: You get all your money back, even though you've had losses. This creates more inequality. So, ultimately, looking for solutions is really important. And this is. I have to give him credit. This is a solution that's been tried. I don't think it's going to be a good solution, but I appreciate the idea, and I think we're going to keep talking about world coin for years to come, because this thing, I think we'll at some point get into bubble territory, and it'll be something that we'll have to evaluate quite a bit.
00:20:25.344 - 00:20:48.354, Speaker B: Nice. I think this topic is on a similar vein for what we wanted to chat about next, which is real world assets. I know this is a topic close to your heart, Taiki. I know you've been doing a lot of research there and publishing a lot of that on your YouTube channel. Do you want to just give us an overview of what's happening in the real world asset space where you think it's headed over the next couple weeks and months and whatnot, and then we'll dive into it?
00:20:49.134 - 00:21:12.036, Speaker D: Yeah. So I've been doing a lot of thinking on, like, what can actually end, like, this Defi bear market. And if you think, like, fundamentally, like the. In 2020, the volume market was started because Fed cut rates to zero. And then people went out the risk curve seeking higher rates. And, you know, capital flowed on chain. And then as soon as the Fed started raising rates, capital flood the chain.
00:21:12.036 - 00:21:55.732, Speaker D: Because now you can clip five and a quarter in short term t bills. And it's basically impossible right now for DeFi to compete with that. There's no on chain strategies that you can do in a safe way to offer, like, six, seven, 8% without taking on, like, crazy smart contract risk. And most of that is like, subsidized anyways by, like, token inflation. So I was thinking, okay, like, how can, how can defi actually compete with the risk free rate? And I think there's some cool things happening with the real world asset front, where there's a bunch of projects tokenizing t bills on chain. And right now, maker is one of the bigger ones doing this. You can currently stake Dai and earn a 3.49%
00:21:55.732 - 00:22:50.434, Speaker D: with a die savings rate. And of course, it's not perfect, right? I mean, like, Dai staking some of that themselves. There's block tower that's taking like 1%, and it's not really that efficient. But if you kind of think about it, you can actually take these tokenized t bills, maybe collateralize it, and do these various looping strategies where maybe if you loop it five times, you can offer a 10% stablecoin yield, and you know exactly what a counterparty is. And this can actually actually scale, because maker can keep buying t bills, other projects can continue to buy t bills. And I feel like we've been in this PvP market where we're just trying to take money from each other, especially with new retail interest. But I feel like with tokenized T bills, you can actually create a PVE market where capital is flowing from off chain sources like the US government interest payments directly on chain.
00:22:50.434 - 00:23:23.888, Speaker D: And I feel like this can actually not immediately but slowly catalyze a defi bull market and create this multiplier effect where money from these interest payments can go to on chain like stablecoin holders. And then eventually that money is going to flow into other coins and then slowly create this economic multiplier on chain effect. And it's kind of like an idea that I've been toying around with. I'm pretty interested in hearing Jordy's thoughts because I know, I really appreciate your.
00:23:23.976 - 00:24:12.486, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, look, this whole topic for me is, is what we experience in crypto and like, for example, ethereum, right? You have staked Ethereum and 30% of people are staking whatever number is 25%. And they're diluting like the other people because they're getting rewards. And this is exactly what is happening with the US government. There's this 5%, 6% coupon. If you're not staking, then you're just getting diluted compared to everybody else and they're competitively, like making real money against you. And so like the $50 to $100 billion of stable coins that's being like stuck in USDC and USDT, we're just kind of getting diluted by, you know, in this case, the circle and tether who are kind of making the profit. But everybody who has money on chain in stable coins is getting diluted.
00:24:12.486 - 00:24:51.988, Speaker C: And so what we're starting to see now is like a bridging of the gap because people are like, well, you know, you got to give me something because otherwise, like, I, you know, I'll take 4% and maybe you can cut 1%, but I, I need to get something. So we're seeing a variety of projects and I'm advising the mantle treasury right now, which is treasury, which has hundreds of millions of dollars of stable coins. And we're looking and evaluating. There's quite a few coming to market. I've seen three or four recently that are doing the legal work to actually be able to provide a whitelisted version of on chain yield, basically. And the cuts are very reasonable. Very reasonable.
00:24:51.988 - 00:25:42.132, Speaker C: Like I've seen 1020 bps, like very, very small cuts. So you actually get 90% of the yield or more in some cases. Now, like, a lot of these are whitelisted, so you have to KYC and there are projects that are potentially trying to bring this to retail users. It's a little bit tricky, but there might be a way that you take the whitelisted asset, which is going to be in a curve pool, and the curve pool will be only accessible to KYC institutions, but those institutions can potentially interact with it and then issue a wrapper token that is accessible to retail. So there is some legal mumbo jumbo, but you're basically creating enough loops where it becomes legal to provide this yield to any degen that wants it on chain.
00:25:42.328 - 00:26:23.472, Speaker B: It's like, you know, Nexus mutual, their NXM token is a security, but they just have a wrapper for WNXM and it's freely transferable, but it does trade at a pretty significant discount, I think. For some reason I wanted to throw to you and Jordan, to Jordy and Alex. So I know Tykee's bullish on the maker token itself. One thing I've been thinking about, and I'm probably just middle curving this, but how can a project where its sole source of revenue is from the risk free rate outperform the risk free rate when it always is like, has fees that it's. So it's going to earn less, right? Like the treasury is earning less. They're paying out a 3.5% die savings rate, but that's actually going to scale up to 8%.
00:26:23.472 - 00:26:43.612, Speaker B: There's going to be a variable die savings rate. In addition, they have to pay the actual custodians a fee. So are you just betting on maker or is the bet here just that the narrative around maker is positive? Right? Like how can the coin itself, where it's only revenue sources, t bills, outperform the t bills? What are your guys thoughts there?
00:26:43.788 - 00:27:18.852, Speaker D: Yeah, I can answer that. First, I don't really view Maker as a nine month, twelve month hold. It's more so in the short term with the lack of retail interest, with new capital inflows. I just feel like the narrative around the maker is pretty strong. Just having this one way capital inflow that's predictable, consistent. I think the market does value that. And there's also like this narrative around like the end game that Rune Tai, like the founder of Maker, talks about where, okay, we're going to rebrand Maker, we're going to rebrand Dai, we're going to do a token split.
00:27:18.852 - 00:28:10.054, Speaker D: We're going to introduce like the subdao farming where you can stake maker, stake Dai and earn all these like new governance tokens. And like, personally, I'm kind of thinking about like selling the news, like roughly when that happens, like, or not, if not before. Um, it's just more like multi month swing for me. Um, I don't really expect maker to like outperform, like, no, like whatever is pumping on any given week. Um, but I think when there's like macro uncertainty around crypto, um, especially with like the bitcoin ETF, you know, outcome happening relatively soon, people often fear like the binance, DOJ indictment and whatnot. Um, I just feel like in the short term, like maker is kind of like a defensive trade, but with the stuff without farming in the end game, I think it can also be viewed as a defensive yet, like it's like semi momentum driven. Because, you know, rune is like really focusing on growing the circulating supply of Dai.
00:28:10.054 - 00:28:23.294, Speaker D: And I think, you know, like with the enhanced dai savings rate, I think that's actually possible. But that's kind of how you view it. It's not like I don't really intend on like holding maker for like twelve months. It's more like, okay, like maybe into Q four. Something along those lines.
00:28:23.594 - 00:28:29.744, Speaker C: Vicki, how long does shimmer capital hold, hold coins? What's the average holding time?
00:28:31.564 - 00:28:59.494, Speaker A: Probably like three days to two weeks, I'd say. Wow, maybe shorter, maybe an hour to two weeks. But question for you guys, I don't understand how you can get around how you can regar the non KYC part of basically just getting treasury yields on chain. I mean, it seems like the moments like Lazarus group or where beerus starts getting yield on his stable coins, it just topples the whole thing. Right?
00:29:00.074 - 00:29:19.734, Speaker C: So you have like the entity that's actually custodying the treasuries and issuing the token. So they're, they can put the treasuries in BNY melon, whatever. Like they can, they can choose from custodian and they can issue the token. And that's all regulatory, like legal. They get all the services and they say that only KYC people can interact with this.
00:29:19.914 - 00:29:21.622, Speaker A: So they can mint redeem.
00:29:21.798 - 00:29:40.434, Speaker C: Yes, Min redeem. Like they're the only ones doing it. And only like KYC institutions can redeem. Now you can have some like defi protocol that says, okay, we're going to KYC. So then we can interact with your token. We're going to buy a bunch of your tokens, taking money from retail to do it, and then we'll give them a receipt token that we've issued. So this is kind of like the ARB.
00:29:40.434 - 00:29:49.824, Speaker C: So the person minting redeeming from the US government directly is not interacting with retail. There is this, like, middle layer. So that's the thing that we might see.
00:29:50.204 - 00:30:21.538, Speaker D: And there's also. Sorry to interrupt, but there's also protocols, like flux, where you can lend out stable coins to these KYC parties. And then maybe these KYC parties are willing to pay up to 4% to borrow stable coins to clip that arbitrage. And that's one way to allow permissionless the risk free rate arb, it's never going to be 5%. It's going to be on flux. Right now, it's like 4%. But if you compare it like that to, like, basically zero rate, I mean, like, aave rate is like one.
00:30:21.538 - 00:31:00.504, Speaker D: Like one 2% or whatnot, I think that's pretty attractive. And as this happens, like, as the market becomes more efficient and competitive, it also should increase, like the, like, the lending rate on AAve, right? Because if you can borrow Dai for 3%, stake it for like four, five, 6%, then it's gonna bring the on chain yields just up. And I'm kind of betting on, like, this slow process to eventually bring in new money. And that's kind of like my idea that I have for the beginning of the defi bull market. Maybe it's like a multi quarter, multi year thing. But I think, you know, the point is, we see, like, the light at the end of the tunnel. It's my opium.
00:31:01.004 - 00:31:16.318, Speaker A: Makes sense. But, like, I mean, it seems like the loophole shouldn't work because you could just. You could, like, have. You could own a bunch. You could literally own SP 500. You can issue a token, like a Kyc person, and then they can just resell it and wrap it. Like, it's not.
00:31:16.318 - 00:31:24.054, Speaker A: That would. I feel like that would, like, obviously get some regulatory IR. Like, why does it work for treasury securities and not like, just regular equities, for example?
00:31:24.174 - 00:31:28.622, Speaker C: That. That's a great idea. I think someone's going to probably do that, you know, in the next six months. Like, just.
00:31:28.678 - 00:31:31.994, Speaker D: Just because, like, I know if you.
00:31:32.614 - 00:31:55.692, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that. That should be, like, that's a good idea. There's no reason why not to do that. Apart from the fact that it's a lot easier to get access to s and p 500 through interactive brokers or through some other CFD kind of provider than it is to get actual treasury yield. And so maybe the need is not as high, but I don't know if that's true, Jordy.
00:31:55.748 - 00:32:13.440, Speaker B: I mean, in the states here, anyone that uses basically any financial services company, like your money is held in a money market fund. Like, I use fidelity. Right. And it's just automatically put in a fidelity money market fund. I think it's called spac sp a XX. And it just buy short duration treasuries. Right.
00:32:13.552 - 00:32:24.432, Speaker C: Yeah, but this is not. I mean, the whole point of all of this, I think, is 100% not for Americans. Like, this is to give access to like euro dollar users across the world. Yeah.
00:32:24.568 - 00:32:25.328, Speaker D: So is that.
00:32:25.376 - 00:32:31.844, Speaker B: Is it not possible to buy or is it much harder to buy t bills as a non american? I mean, what's that process like for you guys?
00:32:33.144 - 00:32:51.750, Speaker C: I don't think the process exists. I mean, wow, you can. It's, you know, it's hard. And like buying a treasury bond. You know, these things are like million dollar eclipse for like one bond. If somebody just has 100k, they just want to get some yield on it. Like, this is actually a good use case for crypto.
00:32:51.750 - 00:33:00.994, Speaker C: And it does make sense to. To have something that, you know, charges 10% and lets people around the world have access to dollar yield.
00:33:01.564 - 00:33:09.516, Speaker B: So you're an advisor for the new Bitdao protocol they renamed? Correct. So can you share a little bit about what you guys are thinking there?
00:33:09.660 - 00:33:42.074, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the treasury has been holding about a billion dollars of ethan stablecoins and not getting any yield on it for quite a while now, many months. And there are safe ways and legal ways where you can start getting yield. And for the stablecoin side, yeah, we're talking to all these people that are, you know, I don't want to show a specific one because there's three or four or five, but there are several that are doing all the legal framework that can start to offer direct access to those yields.
00:33:42.934 - 00:34:19.544, Speaker B: Very cool. Awesome. So we wanted to save the last five or so minutes of this podcast for a segment that we're experimenting with called how Degen am I for doing this? And so we all came with, you know, something where we been interested in over the last couple of weeks. It's more on the fun side for me. Last week I was on our company offsite. We went to DC, and I think on the last day of the offsite, we discovered hamster racing hamsters, GG. And we all just had a blast betting on these hamsters until we found out that the races are pre recorded and that sort of like, took away all the appeal for us.
00:34:19.544 - 00:34:23.324, Speaker B: Did you guys participate in this at all? Is it 2d gen for you guys?
00:34:23.444 - 00:34:39.028, Speaker C: I have not participated, but I've seen it on crypto Twitter or crypto X now, I don't know what we're calling it, but I've seen people talking about it. That's pretty DJN that. I don't. I don't know. What. What number do you guys have out of ten for how Djinn Hamster racing is like.
00:34:39.076 - 00:34:40.612, Speaker D: Oh, is five.
00:34:40.668 - 00:34:47.156, Speaker C: Like, I think ten is like, what was the other one? There's like cockroaches or something.
00:34:47.340 - 00:34:48.104, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:51.564 - 00:35:11.250, Speaker D: I guess hamsters are. It's kind of. It's kind of wholesome. I guess you can kind of. Maybe it's like some type of animal abuse. But, like, if you think about it, like, purely from, like, a djem perspective, like, if the devs making money then. And it's creating economic value, right? Like, Justin's willing to pay money to steal dopamine, then we're talking about hamster racing.
00:35:11.282 - 00:35:16.786, Speaker C: And it sounds pretty decent to me. I wouldn't cockroach level, but I don't know. Give it a number.
00:35:16.930 - 00:35:19.274, Speaker D: I'll give it. I'll give it a five. I'll start with five.
00:35:19.394 - 00:35:20.082, Speaker C: That's low.
00:35:20.178 - 00:35:25.704, Speaker B: That's pretty low. I would have given, you know, ust an eight, right? So this is less djen than ust.
00:35:26.524 - 00:35:31.116, Speaker D: Well, if you start with an eight, then, like, for future topics, like, tell us.
00:35:31.140 - 00:35:34.104, Speaker C: Tell us what's been, like, your djinn activity. Taiki.
00:35:34.804 - 00:36:08.784, Speaker D: Okay. I don't know how Djinn this is, but are you guys aware of, like, virtual, like, vmms, like on chain? Yeah. So there's a bunch of these NFT per Texas that is clearly not, like, sustainable. And there's, like, this DJN play that I've been doing where, like, I don't really expect, like, nfts to pump a lot. So you can basically short, like, board apes on low leverage and collect funding directly from, like, the team treasury. So it's kind of like this rfv play. And I was just been doing this for over a month and I made, like, three ETH.
00:36:08.784 - 00:36:26.678, Speaker D: Like, you know, like, just pretty low risk. There's, like, the risk of the VM VA and then blowing up. But I'm like, okay, like, if it blows up, then I think the team will compensate me. So I'm literally just trying to arb, like, the ETH, like, insurance fund by showing signal one that's not.
00:36:26.846 - 00:36:30.494, Speaker B: It's just like, standard defi behavior, I guess.
00:36:30.614 - 00:36:33.954, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay. Sorry about that. I need to be more djen.
00:36:34.574 - 00:36:36.314, Speaker A: What's the team yield protocol?
00:36:37.494 - 00:36:40.470, Speaker D: There's. Right now the only one that exists.
00:36:40.582 - 00:36:46.140, Speaker C: Is tribe three shorting. You're shorting the floor of Bordeaux club.
00:36:46.302 - 00:37:02.280, Speaker D: Yes. And everyone's short. But in order for the price on the VMM to, like, I guess, like match, like, the oracle price, like, the system has to incentivize new shorts and the only way to do that is by ping ETH from their treasury. So, like everyone.
00:37:02.392 - 00:37:04.164, Speaker C: It's kind of like a funding rate, basically.
00:37:04.504 - 00:37:13.804, Speaker D: Yeah. So as long as board apes don't pump in price, I can actually share my screen. Actually, um, I pulled it up here too.
00:37:13.924 - 00:37:14.664, Speaker B: Um.
00:37:15.564 - 00:37:16.300, Speaker C: All right.
00:37:16.412 - 00:37:23.544, Speaker B: Interesting. It's gone down 99% short. Okay, it's. Maybe it's not a one. This is higher. I misjudged. That's crazy.
00:37:23.844 - 00:37:37.276, Speaker D: Yeah. Like, everyone's doing this and then all it takes is one, like, degen to, like, say, fuck it. Like, I'm gonna liquidate taiki and like, just like a, like 100 ETH worth of, like, buy pressure for this and then everyone blows up.
00:37:37.300 - 00:37:37.454, Speaker B: But.
00:37:37.484 - 00:37:53.454, Speaker C: But I mean, I hope machi big brother is not watching this because possible. Okay. I mean, I would give this a solid seven. Although I have. I have. The hamsters is higher, I have to say. I don't know.
00:37:55.154 - 00:38:00.514, Speaker A: Hamsters are higher in retrospect because the devs rugged the project. So he's like, oh, yeah, I was obviously a scale.
00:38:00.674 - 00:38:01.010, Speaker C: Yes.
00:38:01.042 - 00:38:02.054, Speaker B: Did they rug it?
00:38:03.014 - 00:38:09.502, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, the debt they sold. They started selling the team tokens, like, secretly. They tried to.
00:38:09.598 - 00:38:12.054, Speaker B: Oh, that's right. I thought you meant, like they were.
00:38:12.094 - 00:38:12.270, Speaker A: Because.
00:38:12.302 - 00:38:36.874, Speaker B: So the races we found out in the first line of the white paper, which no one reads, they actually admit, like, credit to them for being honest. They admit that the races are all pre recorded and so, like, they know the outcome. Right. Like, presumably, like, they could just be betting the winner every time in like, some small amount and capturing value that way as well. I thought that's what you meant by ragging. I didn't. You know, I think it's a little less bad that they're just dumping their token.
00:38:36.874 - 00:38:38.694, Speaker B: That's to be expected, right?
00:38:39.434 - 00:38:40.970, Speaker A: That's to be expected. Fair enough.
00:38:41.002 - 00:38:48.194, Speaker C: You're not dumping it. They are. They're doing a OTC transaction at the fair market value with DWF labs. That's what they're doing.
00:38:48.314 - 00:38:48.922, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:49.058 - 00:38:53.974, Speaker C: Very legitimate. Have you been doing any DJN activity, thicky?
00:38:55.634 - 00:39:08.698, Speaker A: I've been so, like, there's because of. I think you see sort of signs of froth when, like, market can't go down so that you can start playing these fun little minigames that, like, don't get really punished for being overextended.
00:39:08.746 - 00:39:08.930, Speaker B: In.
00:39:08.962 - 00:39:41.986, Speaker A: And, like, one of the examples is you've seen this return of, like, this market manipulator sort of targeting these, like, dead coins that have, like, a really hard to borrow sort of lower market cap. So earlier this week, there was a gold, and then there's sTMX, and then there's KNC. Essentially, there's, like, these dead coins that have maybe like, $70 million market cap. They, like, buy it really slowly. They start accumulating spot so that, like, the perp starts lagging behind spot. So people that are short, I have to pay funding because the funding is negative because, like, spot's been leading. And, like, in the first few days, like, people are like, ah, some guy's an idiot.
00:39:41.986 - 00:40:00.062, Speaker A: Just buying. So they're going to short the token, and then towards the end, they ramp up and they just buy a ton and ton and ton of spot until all this Oi builds up and. And finally they manipulate the price high enough to where, like, all the shorts get liquidated and then they, like, start selling on their spot again. So we saw it with a gold. It went up maybe like 100% or so.
00:40:00.158 - 00:40:02.902, Speaker B: You mean adventure gold, the loot derivative project?
00:40:03.038 - 00:40:03.710, Speaker C: Yes. Yes.
00:40:03.742 - 00:40:04.510, Speaker A: Holy crap.
00:40:04.582 - 00:40:06.806, Speaker B: That's a throwback. That is a useless coin.
00:40:06.870 - 00:40:07.514, Speaker D: Wow.
00:40:09.294 - 00:40:23.938, Speaker A: The first, I was short of intra gold, and, like, I took a, took a small loss in that one, but then I saw, like, the meta happening and they rotated to a different coin. So I was able to catch the long side of those ones. But, yeah, it was kind of just fun just playing the market manipulation game there.
00:40:24.026 - 00:40:31.454, Speaker B: Where do you watch for that? Like, where can someone like a normie like me find that information? You just got to know the markets.
00:40:31.874 - 00:40:39.706, Speaker A: If you look for the biggest movers every day, typically, like, the ones that move like, 40, 50% of the day are like, you know, kind of scammy coins.
00:40:39.850 - 00:41:05.592, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a dangerous game, right? Like, this kind of, it's a pure bear market stuff where people try to find what coin is safe enough to start playing these games. Because if you choose one where, like, there's a treasury that's actually ready and willing to, like, sell, then during the accumulation phase, you just get dumped on by, like, the big token holders. You got to find these ones that, like, no one's really gonna get in the way and just like, you know, let you play your listing games.
00:41:05.768 - 00:41:30.094, Speaker B: Well, thank you. You gotta let us know dm us when the, the next thing is coming up so we can participate too and have some fun. But with that, I think we should close it there. I had a blast. It was a pleasure doing this with all you guys. If you guys liked the video, the viewers, make sure to subscribe like the video and share it with your friends. We're going to try to do this every week now and we're still learning, so if you have suggestions, drop them in the comments.
00:41:30.094 - 00:41:40.734, Speaker B: We'd love to learn from you and get your feedback. So thank you guys. On behalf of all of us, it was an absolute pleasure and hopefully you enjoyed the first episode of steady lads. Bye, everyone.
