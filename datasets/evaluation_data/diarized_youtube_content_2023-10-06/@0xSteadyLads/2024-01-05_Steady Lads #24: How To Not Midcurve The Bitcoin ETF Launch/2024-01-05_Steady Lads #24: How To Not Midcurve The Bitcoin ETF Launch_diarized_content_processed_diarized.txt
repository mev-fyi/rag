00:00:00.160 - 00:00:12.646, Speaker A: Fair enough. I do think Tikkis is probably also relatively accurate. He's kind of a dj that clearly ride tail. I will work on my mid curve ness. You know, it's because you have a.
00:00:12.670 - 00:00:14.634, Speaker B: $6,000 ETH target, man.
00:00:15.214 - 00:00:15.894, Speaker C: More mad about.
00:00:15.934 - 00:00:19.274, Speaker D: Are you more mad about being mid curve or more mad about being Giga deejay?
00:00:19.654 - 00:00:22.074, Speaker A: I'm more mad about the mid curve. I'm okay.
00:00:22.774 - 00:00:37.270, Speaker C: I think you are Giga degen. I have a little quick anecdote. We won't say what coin, but right before the stream started, Jordi said, quick, pull up the tape for this coin. We won't mention the coin. We pull it up. We're looking at the 1 minute chart. It starts ticking up.
00:00:37.270 - 00:00:44.434, Speaker C: That's Jordy with his bid on his other laptop. So he's pretty degen. I think he's pretty active. More so than we. Than we're led to believe.
00:01:05.094 - 00:01:35.760, Speaker A: All right, welcome, everybody, to the first episode of 2024. And what a year it's already started to be. So I'm Jordy, CIO of Salini capital, chief alchemist at Mantle. We have Justin, CEO of Astaria. We have Taiki, our humble farmer and favorite researcher, and also crypto wizard podcaster. And we have Vicky, who is moving up in the world. As we can see here, he is no longer a bus boy.
00:01:35.760 - 00:01:41.124, Speaker A: He's just falling in his robe now. So are things going pretty well in Scimitar, Vicki?
00:01:41.424 - 00:01:44.484, Speaker D: It's going well. Got a good, good bonus this year.
00:01:45.224 - 00:02:06.272, Speaker A: Glad to hear it. Glad to hear it. Hopefully this was before the TRB thing happened and. And the market decided to rug everybody on New Year's Day. That was unfortunate enough to be trading TRB. I don't even get the chart up, guys. This was a couple of days ago.
00:02:06.272 - 00:02:13.816, Speaker A: And quite a banger way to liquidate everyone's. Everyone's earnings for the year was the.
00:02:13.840 - 00:02:23.654, Speaker D: Fireworks for 2020 New Year's Eve. I looked back at all my worst trades this year, and all of them were on these types of scams. So I was luckily able to avoid this one.
00:02:23.744 - 00:02:56.986, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's tell our degen audience. I'm guessing a lot of them do know about this token, because this is probably the most degen thing to try to trade. Background is a certain firm, which we may have had a guest on from that firm at some point. Got a lot of this token. I don't know if it was organic or was it deal with the creators or whatever, but let's just say they cornered the market and then started creating games where the funding rate, uh, would be at, like, -2% per window, and they would just trap shorts. So they trap the shorts in.
00:02:56.986 - 00:03:55.262, Speaker A: They kind of keep moving the spot price out and just sort of, like, liquidating them. And this has happened, like, multiple times, and we can. If we zoom out, this chart has, like, moved up from, like, you know, very, very low levels and just kind of keeps having these liquidation pumps and consolidates and then kind of does it again and again. But, yeah, you can kind of see that in July, August, this thing was trading at $7, and then a couple of days ago, I was trading at $700. I'm not familiar. Familiar with any tech progress that's being done at teller tributes, so forgive me if you've kind of solved some AI thing or something going on over there, but my understanding is that anyone who is unfortunate enough to get pulled into trading this thing, whether you're long or short, doesn't really matter, because you're playing against somebody who has all the cards. So if you're short, they will just kind of liquidate you by pushing it up and getting you a -2% funding rates.
00:03:55.262 - 00:04:00.526, Speaker A: If you're long, they'll just dump on you. So, Vicki, have you. Have you tried to trade this?
00:04:00.630 - 00:04:06.514, Speaker C: Learn the fundamentals, Jordy. Learn the fundamentals. Right here. Oh, fundamentals.
00:04:10.474 - 00:04:10.786, Speaker A: That.
00:04:10.810 - 00:04:13.418, Speaker B: There are so many sections in the docs must be bullish.
00:04:13.546 - 00:04:18.698, Speaker D: I've tried trading this, but I've always lost a bunch of money, so I've given up on it.
00:04:18.786 - 00:04:43.486, Speaker A: It amazes me that some of the biggest, smartest traders in the space that I know asked me about it. They're like, hey, I'm trying to front run XYZ firm. I'll try to be sensitive. Okay, DWS. And, you know, they try to, like, predict when they're gonna pump it and when they're gonna dump it based on, you know, which. Which part of the. The phase they're in.
00:04:43.486 - 00:05:37.410, Speaker A: But the reality is, there's gonna be a net loser, because you're always gonna be on the wrong side of it if. If you're against, you know, the person who's controlling the cards. And the way I liken it is, the coin is a casino, and they happen to be, like, on, you know, binance strip mall, where, like, all the casinos are, like, the main casinos. They have a nice casino there, and if you enter that casino, the odds are very stacked. There will be a few people who do manage to time it correctly and kind of join in on the right side of the move, but most people are going to lose everything that they enter with. And the thing that happened over New Year's was the most extreme version that I've ever seen for this thing, where they literally just pumped it way beyond belief and liquidated everybody, both sides, and it was the largest liquidations of that day. Hopefully you avoided it this time.
00:05:37.410 - 00:05:40.866, Speaker A: Do you know anybody that, that was active on this? On this one?
00:05:41.050 - 00:05:59.476, Speaker D: Yeah, I feel like anyone that actually trades, tries to trade size on it, like, always loses. I think you can, like, win if you, like, try to trade, like, really small size on it, and they basically try to, like, avoid detection, your positioning, like, not get noticed by them. But it was trading, like, I don't know, like, it was like, what, $5 billion of volume? What did you see on your end, Jordy?
00:05:59.580 - 00:06:46.664, Speaker A: Yeah, huge volume. I think the liquidations that were reported were around 40 million of liquidations, caused mostly, obviously, like, shorts that got liquidated on that $700 spike up. Some people did try to trade once it was at 500, and it came all the way back down. So there is a way to make money if you really are small, like you said, you're not getting in their way, but is it really worth it? There's so many more plus ev coins and things to do than try to trade this. And it does make a little bit of a mockery of these markets, because you're confronted with the reality that there's no referee in the room, there's no adult in the room. It's just a honey pot.
00:06:48.364 - 00:06:48.812, Speaker B: On New.
00:06:48.828 - 00:06:53.430, Speaker D: Year's Eve, especially imagine the rice on new year's Eve trying to trade this.
00:06:53.572 - 00:06:54.894, Speaker A: Iki, what do you think?
00:06:55.274 - 00:07:30.662, Speaker B: You mentioned this earlier, but we're in this. I mean, it seems like a raging bull market if you look at crypto prices. And do you really want to focus your time trying to play games with DWF, or would you rather just play on the right side of the modular narrative or the EIP 4844 narrative? It seems like people that try to trade around these DWF coins, there's some sort of ego where they want to be, right? They want to just say that they shorted the top and caught the move. But in reality, most people should just try to make money and not try to be, I guess, quote unquote, right?
00:07:30.798 - 00:07:51.514, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, the reality is that this stuff would be illegal in traditional markets. In crypto, we've talked about before that these retail participants can be exploited in this fashion. They look at this shiny thing that's gone up a lot in the trade. They're opening their apps. They want to see what's trading the most volume, what's moving, where's the activity happening. They want to kind of gamble in that aspect.
00:07:51.514 - 00:08:18.254, Speaker A: And everyone's gambling on New Year's Eve, and that's it. Everybody got liquidated and GG, and obviously ever since then, the rest of the week has continued to have some volatility. Midweek had, of course, a huge liquidation event. This was an opportunity for some people to make potentially crazy amount of money. I think some people did really well buying dips. Did you, did you buy anything on this dip, Justin?
00:08:18.374 - 00:08:34.630, Speaker C: No, I missed out. I was just. I think I'm fully allocated for whatever happens over the next year. I'm not really looking to sell in the short term, and I'm also not really looking to buy. I just don't see the need. I mean, that was. We had the time for that over the last two years.
00:08:34.630 - 00:08:59.468, Speaker C: So for me, I'm just sort of sitting on my hands. I haven't really rotated much out of ETH in like, considerable size right now and feeling pretty comfortable with that. I know we're going to talk about what's been happening with the Celsius sales later, but it does seem to me like there's some mean reversion that we should expect on HPTC. But again, I've been saying that for a year or so, and I've been continuously proven wrong, but I don't think now is the time to sort of capitulate on that.
00:08:59.596 - 00:09:31.776, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I agree with you and we will look at it in a bit. But basically, we've had the battle of the interns, right? Like, we have the, the one intern that gave us the fake headline about ETF approval back months ago that we talked on the show, how it was showing a very bullish reaction from the market. This one was a little bit different. Basically a couple of days ago. It wasn't even during the dip. There was some analysts from Matrix support that said that this ETF is not getting approved and bitcoin is going back to 36k. Cool story, bro.
00:09:31.776 - 00:10:18.398, Speaker A: So everybody ignored it. No one cared. But then for some reason, the block decided to make a story about the other guy who made a story that they literally just had a headline saying, someone else said that this will get rejected. And all the trading algos that go off of headlines picked it up and just started this liquidation cascade. And the market was overdue for a liquidation cascade, so it ran really deep. I think it was a really, really obvious buying opportunity. I did go Max long, not at the bottom, but at this mid recovery period right after, because it was clear that this all started from what was, in essence, a misreading of an AI bot doing kind of a LLM on the headline.
00:10:18.398 - 00:10:36.664, Speaker A: Vicky, you're kind of familiar with these news traits, and I know a lot of tree of alpha and other people run this stuff. Do you think you could kind of actually make money by getting the wrong reaction? But then as long as you cover it in time, you kind of. You're right, even though you're wrong?
00:10:36.744 - 00:11:15.700, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm in, like, quite a few of these groups, and I remember the Sunday before, I was having, like, my other Twitter spaces talking about how everyone seemed to be positioned, that, like, there was, like, a 99% chance they would get approved. And I don't think they were trying to make adjustments, um, you know, around cutting before the ETF happened, and, like, funding rates were super positive. So the positioning was super, you know, super long. And I think these. These news traders actually saw in these groups, like, talking about how, like, the short on a rejection or, like, even rumors of rejection would probably be pretty forgiving just because of how positioning was positioned. Super long.
00:11:15.812 - 00:11:49.868, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there remains to be, like, a lot of opportunity in crypto right now, even though the funding rates got reset. And if you're farming stables and you're farming funding rates, that opportunity of, like, 100% APY is not around right now. With. With, like, the leverage wipeout, I think we will have multiple more opportunities where people get over their skis. We're seeing today already, like, large moves. We see the Tia trannies, as they're called. And the Lido lady boys isn't trannies and lady boys kind of, like.
00:11:49.868 - 00:11:53.596, Speaker A: Are they saying, like, TN and lido are kind of, like the same coin? I don't know what's going on here.
00:11:53.620 - 00:11:59.764, Speaker B: But maybe they have the same holder base. So, you know, they want to identify across multiple. Multiple communities.
00:11:59.924 - 00:12:15.450, Speaker A: Very Thailand based, older base, apparently. Like, Andrew, you see, like, this tweet saying that Defcon is going to be in Bangkok. So the lido and the trannies and the Ladyboy coins are going up a lot.
00:12:15.572 - 00:12:17.154, Speaker D: Um, coincidence.
00:12:17.614 - 00:12:38.806, Speaker A: Coincidence. It does look like, potentially EIP 4844 is. Is nearing. We're seeing arbitrum finally kind of stopping a stable coin. Um, we had my, uh, hard rock Nick meme about stable coin of the year. So Arbo is the stable coin of 2023, and it's finally breaking out. It's doubled over $2.
00:12:38.806 - 00:12:45.954, Speaker A: Thank you. Do you think EIP 4844 is going to change the game for L2s, or are you both L2 right now?
00:12:46.074 - 00:13:08.042, Speaker D: I think from like a, you know, like, I think Justin can talk more on the fundamental side also. But I think, like, from like a narrative trader perspective, like, this is very bullish for L2s. And it's been definitely reflected in the markets as like, the Denkun upgrade has been. I guess the dates have been set and they're like, set a little bit sooner than the market expected, which is like, violently repriced these all twos, which should see a lot more activity.
00:13:08.098 - 00:13:10.054, Speaker A: And what's your take, Justin?
00:13:10.614 - 00:13:41.934, Speaker C: Yeah, so it's interesting. I think the reaction to arbitrum here is a little extreme and perhaps overheated, but those are just the conditions we're in. But fundamentally, I think this goes back to sort of the conversation we've been having over the last whole year. 4844 effectively changes the pricing for L2s, which is Ethereum's whole business model. And we've noted that Ethereum is in this deadly middle zone where it's not quite hard money like bitcoin. That's just sort of committing to that. And it's also not fast like Solana, and cheap and usable and accessible, et cetera.
00:13:41.934 - 00:14:34.178, Speaker C: And now they're sort of like maybe diving even deeper into this deadly middle zone where they're basically like cannibalizing their own fee market in some ways and lowering the amount of revenue that will accrue to the chain. And I understand that it leads to better prices on l two s, which is like the end ultimate goal, but in my opinion, you really got to pick a direction here. Um, I don't know if this middle ground approach is going to work when you have, you know, bitcoin on one side and Solana on the other, and it's just sitting in the middle. And, you know, we've been saying that for a while now. I haven't seen any commentary from sort of the ETH camp, aside from, really us criticizing 48, 44, everyone's sort of been treating it as like the, you know, as sliced bread. Right? Like, this is like the next greatest thing coming down the pipeline, maybe for these l two coins. But I, I don't see it through Ethereum, uh, other than the fact that, like, typically into hard forks, tokens pump.
00:14:34.178 - 00:14:40.922, Speaker C: So ethereum might do well in the short term because of it, but at the end of the day, it, like, fundamentally changes how ethereum is going to make money.
00:14:41.018 - 00:15:25.850, Speaker A: There's been a lot of talk out there around Ethereum kind of needing to rebrand the narrative. And I was in a podcast with, uh, Sano on bankless a couple of days ago, or talking about Ethan 2024, and there were, you know, there there was a consensus that, you know, maybe the ultrasound meme needs to go, but it's not exactly clear what their, uh, kind of return is. Like, where do we go from there? Some people are talking about restaking being, you know, narrative, that where ETH kind of becomes a security layer for a lot of other stuff. Um, you know, my personal take is that people will start to realize this is community money, and it could be very good community money. And that's kind of what makes me bullish. I think you're right. Like, you know, in terms of fees and, like, fees paid for the short term, this is not going to be great.
00:15:25.850 - 00:15:43.354, Speaker A: And also all these, like, celestia options. I mean, I'm talking to some of the projects that I work with. They're looking at using data availability off of the l one to make their gas cheaper. People just hate high gas, right? Like, is that, is that sort of the story? Taiki?
00:15:43.514 - 00:16:28.680, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, if you think about. I guess, like, you know, my background is I entered crypto full time in 2020, and I was kind of like, eat maxi, started using the chain, bought some farm tokens, got dumped on, and then whenever I tried to take my loss, I had to pay $60 to approve the farm token and then $60 to sell, and I was fucking pissed. And then I saw a cheap chain called Polygon, and I was like, okay, I'm going to ape into this thing. And that was kind of the narrative from last cycle. Ethereum has abandoned its users and the people are going to just flock the cheaper chains. And it's been two years since the market top, and not much has changed, right? Ethereum gas fees are still high. The l two ecosystem still looks bleak to say the least.
00:16:28.680 - 00:16:36.232, Speaker B: And that's one of the reasons why. I think that's one of the reasons. For as long as resurgence, I think cosmos will do well, even other alto ones.
00:16:36.288 - 00:16:37.368, Speaker A: And I think that's going to be.
00:16:37.376 - 00:16:41.204, Speaker B: The narrative again this cycle. Ethereum is too expensive. Let's go to cheaper chains.
00:16:41.304 - 00:17:30.418, Speaker C: Can I ask you guys if you think that fundamentally actually matters or if it's just memetics, does the high gas cost actually matter? Or is it just a meme? Because I'm sort of reminded of that quote, like, oh, it's too crowded over there. No one goes there, right? Like the high gas prices means that the chain is, is truly that valuable to use. And I'm just wondering if like, you know, polygon to use it is 1000 x cheaper than Ethereum. Which means theoretically, like the user on a user on polygon is worth somewhere between like one 100th or one 1000th of the value of a user on Ethereum, just as far as revenue to the chain goes. And I'm sort of wondering like how much low fees matter. Are the people that are actually going for the low fees like relevant as users? I mean, of course we care about them and want to offer them a good experience, but are they actually the ones that are adding the value to the ecosystem? Something I've been thinking about a lot lately.
00:17:30.506 - 00:18:02.068, Speaker B: Yeah, I can touch on this. And I did a podcast with Daryl, like Wingarian, and he mentioned that right now on Ethereum, there's no great expectation, there's no expectation of great profits or anything in the Ethereum ecosystem, aside from maybe like buying arbor op. So people aren't really willing to pay high fees. But if you go to BRC 20 land, people are paying like $100 to inscribe things. So I think that's one of the issues Ethereum has. There's nothing new that's happened. We had nfts last cycle and people were paying thousands of dollars to mint like other side nfts.
00:18:02.068 - 00:18:23.344, Speaker B: But this time around, people can make more money on Solana, people can make money on cosmos or centralized exchanges. Why do they need you to go on the chain? So until something happens innovation wise or some new mechanic in ETH mainnet, I just don't see users go there. People have to have expectations of profit.
00:18:24.044 - 00:18:58.100, Speaker C: I agree with the expectation of profit, but I would in some ways argue that's not what we're seeing now, isn't real usage. All of the activity and excitement around these other chains we're not going to name, but some chains worth multiple billions of dollars have 5 million in TVL and a lot of the chains that are popping off now, there's truly nothing really to do there. That's novel. The use case for on chain hasn't shifted from what it was in 2020, which is uniswap and aave or lending in general. And I just don't. We talked about this before. We would love to see a new category emerge to kick off this bull.
00:18:58.100 - 00:19:14.852, Speaker C: But I think we're in a weird spot now because the bull market has kicked off in a huge, huge way. But there's no new use case. And I feel like every other cycle has had a new use case that people have gotten excited about. And for me, there's just not much I'm seeing that, like, is convincing me to do much on chain. I don't really do much on chain these days, honestly.
00:19:14.948 - 00:19:52.770, Speaker A: Well, look, like when it comes to on chain fees, obviously whales are going to drive a lot of it. When it comes to centralized exchange token trading, I think having a large amount of retail, smaller fish will drive that. I don't think it's just a meme. I mean, we saw the Suzu tweet from two years, two, three years ago where he said dream has abandoned abandoned users. Obviously at the time he was just trying to pump his avalanche bags and he very successfully did that. But it feels like two years later that tweet is actually extremely relevant to what's been happening in Q 420 23. With Solana and everything else.
00:19:52.770 - 00:20:20.784, Speaker A: This is kind of like the narrative recreating exactly what Suzu was talking about. I think ultimately it does matter. People do want to not have to pay $50 for transaction. We were doing it for a while as like a new normal, but once you. Once you don't do that, you don't want to go back to it. And I think l two s with 48, 44, hopefully kind of change, change it around. I'm curious, sticky, have you been trading any of the l one, the cheap, fast l ones? Is that I have.
00:20:21.154 - 00:20:52.606, Speaker D: I wanted to pose like a question on this e debate. I almost view that. I think the users and the text, it matters in the tech cycle, in the short term of speculation and memability. I do think on a 510 year timeframe, these things will almost always fade. These flows are going to leave. And what really matters is, in my mind still, is the fundamental store value pieces. And with bitcoins security model, it needs to double the price every single year to keep the same amount of security.
00:20:52.606 - 00:21:32.568, Speaker D: Whereas ETH proof of stake is so secure that even if ETH is worth 250 billion, the amount of money that it would take for youth, 51% attack the ETH network is just astronomically high because its just so hard to gather, say, 10% of the supply in that short of a time without anyone noticing supposed to bitcoin. So this repricing in bitcoin definitely has shifted because I think it's inevitable that the world realizes that like bitcoins security model is fundamentally broken and they make the shift to eat. But because the price bitcoins gone up so much like it might push it back, you know, another four years, another eight years, which is like a lot and like the short term. But like, in the grand scheme of things, like, I do think it'll eventually.
00:21:32.616 - 00:21:55.018, Speaker A: Go back to eat the bitcoin thing just to correct. Yeah, it needs to double every four years, not every one year. And that even that's of being challenged a little bit with the inscriptions and the amount of fees that are being generated, are those still going to be popular in 20 years or Chinese still going to be going crazy over BRC twenties? And maybe those fees go away, it's hard to say.
00:21:55.066 - 00:22:03.290, Speaker D: But even now, subscription fees are only 15 20% of the visa miners get. It's still mostly from the block awards.
00:22:03.442 - 00:22:41.524, Speaker C: One thing I want to point out that really changed my perspective on this that I think is so helpful to frame this, is when there's activity on ETH. Activity today impacts future security because ETH is deflationary, you're burning supply. But all the activity we're seeing on bitcoin today is not at all helpful for the future. All that matters for bitcoin security is sort of like the instantaneous demand, which I think is like a fundamental, like, flawed design. Right? Like, even if ordinals are like the next big thing or some sort of bitcoin, l two is the next big thing for the next four years. That doesn't actually matter because where we're at in 20 years is what's going to matter in 20 years. Whereas, like, build this more sustainable roadmap.
00:22:42.064 - 00:23:26.276, Speaker A: Absolutely. So there's still a lot of uncertainties and, yeah, it does, you know, feel like a store of value thesis for east being an alternative that doesn't require this halving. And, you know, this kind of uncertainty should be there for the taking. Meanwhile, you know, Celsius has been dumping constantly. You know, the fuck are they doing over there? We have, we have our cat looking over. They keep selling. From what my understanding is of the situation there, they initially were going to have a business plan of BTC mining and Ethereum staking, and at some point the plan just became BTC mining and no ETH staking because regulatory, it would be hard to do that part.
00:23:26.276 - 00:24:04.498, Speaker A: And so there's been a bit of a rebalancing. I think those sales, from what I understand, are nearing the end or, you know, sort of, sort of an end. Uh, I have publicly been expecting that once the BTC ETF hits, there will be a very large transition to the next thing, which will be, uh, looking at ETH on the horizon. So I. I, like Justin, have been, um, positioned likewise. And hopefully, I'm not mid curving. And why do I say I am mid curving? Apparently, one of you guys out there, whoever of you this is, created the steady lads curve meme.
00:24:04.498 - 00:24:31.744, Speaker A: So I would say some of it's accurate. I kind of, you know, I think Taiji is the very proud mid carver that, you know, is very happy with the recent maker move, so he's doing okay. I think everybody will agree with, you know, some of this left, left side here. But WTF? I mean, how am I in mid curve Degen, Justin, are you guys happy with your positioning?
00:24:31.864 - 00:24:33.120, Speaker D: I'm happy with mine.
00:24:33.272 - 00:24:37.080, Speaker C: I mean, I think thickie and I have the two best squares, to be honest.
00:24:37.192 - 00:24:37.648, Speaker D: I do.
00:24:37.696 - 00:24:48.224, Speaker C: Because you got to want to be right curve. Right, like you left curve. You're going to make a lot of money, but you don't want to go through life like that mid curve Tykee. I'm sorry. It's a. It's a real tough spot to be. I've been there.
00:24:48.224 - 00:25:02.880, Speaker C: But right curve is where it's at, right? Like, we. We run the narrative. We know what's coming. We're outsmarting everyone. And you don't want to be too djen, right? You don't want to be Giga Degen. You'll sort of blow yourself up. We all know Ansem's going to ride Solana back down to $10.
00:25:03.072 - 00:25:03.784, Speaker A: What?
00:25:03.944 - 00:25:15.576, Speaker C: I'm just kidding. But Vicki and I, like, are in a great spot, and so I'm very happy here. I'm, like, very non djen, and so, like, I'm really, really happy in my square in the top right there. I think I'm in the best spot with Dickey.
00:25:15.720 - 00:25:33.622, Speaker A: Shortly, what steady listener has, like, watched you go over, like, world coin orbs and Solana phones and, like, being like, oh, yeah, this guy is, like, zero b gentle. He does not djen at all. He's not buying random land on, like, NfT projects where you try to. No, this guy is zero degen. Well, he said he's watched.
00:25:33.678 - 00:25:42.318, Speaker C: He said he's watched every single episode, but his handle is ETH boy. So maybe he just likes me because I'm probably more ETH aligned, quote unquote, than. Than the rest of you guys.
00:25:42.406 - 00:25:55.066, Speaker A: Fair enough. I do think thickies is probably also relatively accurate. He's kind of a DJ. That is clearly right tail. I will work on my mid curveness. You know, it's because you have a.
00:25:55.090 - 00:25:57.050, Speaker B: $6,000 eats target, man.
00:25:57.202 - 00:26:02.614, Speaker D: Wait, what's more mad about? Are you more mad about being mid curve or more about being giga deja?
00:26:03.034 - 00:26:04.658, Speaker A: I'm more mad about the mid curve.
00:26:04.746 - 00:26:24.654, Speaker C: Okay, well, I think you are giga degenerate. I have a little quick anecdote. We won't say what coin, but right before the stream started, Jordy said, quick, pull up the tape for this coin. We won't mention the coin. We pull it up, we're looking at the 1 minute chart. It starts ticking up. That's Jordy with his bid on his other laptop.
00:26:24.654 - 00:26:29.054, Speaker C: So he's pretty djen. I think he's pretty active. More so than we. Than we're led to believe.
00:26:29.134 - 00:26:29.326, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:29.350 - 00:26:29.758, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:26:29.806 - 00:26:40.014, Speaker B: Michael Saylor definitely is ultra djen, so. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Michael said there's a mid curve. DJ Jordy runs, like, a delta neutral.
00:26:40.054 - 00:26:43.274, Speaker D: Shop, so I don't know if you categorize them since DJ.
00:26:44.034 - 00:26:48.894, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly. Get my street cred on the institutional stream.
00:26:49.274 - 00:26:53.002, Speaker D: Maybe it was the poker stories you're telling about you'd stay up all night playing poker.
00:26:53.098 - 00:27:21.686, Speaker A: Anyway, we appreciate you guys kind of coming up with this stuff and sometimes calling out some pastas of the week that we end up using. So thank you for that. Another thing we want to get to is, unfortunately, we are still seeing some hacks. We saw very recently, a hack of gamma. I think it was $3.8 million or something in that region. We saw a very large hack very recently of orbit chain.
00:27:21.686 - 00:27:44.450, Speaker A: Orbit bridge on Clayton. And I don't know if we can find this. Maybe your editor can find this later. There was a response by the Clayton Koreans to the person who hacked them. They always like to do these on chain messages to tell the hacker, like, hey, let's. Let's communicate. And they said the most, like, korean.
00:27:44.450 - 00:28:00.574, Speaker A: I have a lot of korean friends, and I know how emotional they get sometimes. And it was. It was such an emotional message. They're basically saying, like, we will find you. We will kill you. We will destroy your life. But, hey, like, can we, like, you know, if you want to negotiate, we're here to negotiate.
00:28:00.574 - 00:28:22.914, Speaker A: Reach out to us any way you can. But it's quite unfortunate where we're still having these things happen. And sometimes it's very common. Even radiant had a hacked couple days ago, and it was something that's been happening quite often, unfortunately, very similar points of attack. Justin, have you also been a part of some attacks recently?
00:28:23.374 - 00:28:57.432, Speaker C: Yeah, it was, let's say, an exciting week, to say the least. So my co founder was, unfortunately Sim swapped, uh, this past week. Uh, he's very security conscious. So he doesn't generally use SMS for two factor authentication. But, like, as we know, some platforms basically just require that. And so, you know, it's quite easy for a hacker, right, they know someone's name easily to find where they live, easy to find their phone number and what carrier they use. They can buy the Social Security online for, you know, $10, $20, something like that, and they can get a fake id made, go to the mobile store.
00:28:57.432 - 00:29:42.042, Speaker C: Whether it's, you know, in the US or outside of the US, they go to the store. They basically just have to convince an employee at that store to activate this new phone that they bring in with that old number to transfer the number over. If a store says no, they can go to another one, right? Like, it's pretty much guaranteed that they can make this happen. And so, unfortunately, this attack was successful in the, in the short term, and the attacker stole a quarter million dollars from our company bank account. Fortunately, it was like 09:00 p.m. Here I was on my computer, as I usually am, and I got the alert that new bank account was linked to our bank, and so immediately saw it, immediately got the accounts frozen, had the money clawed back. But it's one of those things that sort of makes it exhausting to be in this space, right? You talk to people.
00:29:42.042 - 00:29:58.602, Speaker C: I was actually talking to some people at the fraud department at the bank, and some of them have never even heard of a Sim swap attack. So we're really exposing ourselves in this industry to a lot of unnecessary risk. And I think these attacks are going to continue happening until our infrastructure and, you know, wireless space picks up.
00:29:58.738 - 00:30:21.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, even one of our co hosts here. So I know, I know Taiki has gone through this and very similar situation. We saw some of the Twitter hacks happening as well. Thank you. Like, how does it feel emotionally? Like, do you feel kind of, like, violated? Like, I've had stuff stolen from me. Like, and I felt very, like, you know, kind of just physically upset. How did you feel when this happened?
00:30:21.922 - 00:30:56.858, Speaker B: Well, the first time I got spam attacked, I was like, oh, like, I guess I'm big enough where someone wants to attack me. So I was like, oh, yeah, I kind of felt like I made it. But, but, like, you know, it is annoying. I still get, like, spam on my phone. So what they do is like, if someone tries to sim swap you, Verizon or T mobile will probably text you. Like, hey, like, you try to change your phone number or trying to move it to a new phone, if this was you, you can ignore this message, but if it's not, contact us. So what an attacker does is they just spam your texts every ten minutes or so.
00:30:56.858 - 00:31:06.162, Speaker B: So hopefully, or they're hoping that you missed that text. Gratefully. I caught it so I don't have to deal with it, but I still get these texts. It's super annoying.
00:31:06.338 - 00:31:18.510, Speaker A: It does seem to be a bit of a us phenomenon. I've been living outside the US for a long time, never had any. I don't think that ours outside the US are stupid that they just let you convince them.
00:31:18.542 - 00:31:46.216, Speaker C: Tony, we talked to some security folks, and the two things, if you're looking to tighten your security and you're listening, this one is don't use a us carrier. Obviously some people that doesn't work for, but if you are in the US, use Google Fi. Google Fi has some great international plans. It's quite affordable. It seems like it'll be quit pretty quick. And Google, from what I understand, is the least likely to be socially engineered to give up your sim. And part of the reason is they just don't have physical locations.
00:31:46.216 - 00:31:49.124, Speaker C: So we're looking at switching over to that ourselves.
00:31:49.504 - 00:32:35.054, Speaker A: Yeah. The funny thing though, with all these hacks and all these things, we had a dev start in recently outside of crypto and he was looking at play and we, you know, we had this like big hack happen, 80 million lost. And he's looking at like, he's like, the price is going up. Like, what's going on? Welcome to crypto. You know, like, this is less about fundamentals and just the, the fact that the ticker is getting mentioned that it got hacked can pump the price instead of move the price down. I'm curious, sticky, like, do you ever try to like, sell stuff off on like, even radiant, like, you know, it got hacked and then, like, the price was, was not like, reacting. Do you try to trade these hacking headlines and do you know how to do it?
00:32:35.214 - 00:32:55.062, Speaker D: Well, maybe I'll give away snap gear, but, um, I think the mid curve move is to short on hack, but the gigabrain move is to buy on hack. You know, unless like, they're actively like, swapping the tokens into, you know, into ETH or something and they're selling it. Like, there's actually no short term flow that comes from it. Like, nobody really wants to short.
00:32:55.118 - 00:32:55.286, Speaker A: So.
00:32:55.310 - 00:33:01.934, Speaker D: So, like, if someone shorts the coin and there's a lot of liability that you just go buy it from them. At PvP, though, yeah.
00:33:02.014 - 00:33:10.074, Speaker A: You can liquidate the people that think they're too mid curving and they think it's actually going to go down because there was a hack. Imagine that. Imagine.
00:33:10.574 - 00:33:13.674, Speaker D: Yeah, it's actually bullish because there's a lot more attention on the coin.
00:33:14.054 - 00:33:14.678, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:14.806 - 00:33:33.138, Speaker A: This is kind of what we told our new starter. Welcome to this new world. So one day things will normalize. But this is, this is where we live right now. And there have to. There have been a little bit of, like, PvP, a little bit of cat fights. I saw Antonio from DydX, you know, they had a liquidity drain on their insurance fund.
00:33:33.138 - 00:34:00.174, Speaker A: He said that they've identified through a bunch of forensics on chain and so forth. He's not telling us, but he tweeted that they know who it is and they're there in contact with whoever manipulated the protocol to. To take out $9 million from the insurance fund. I don't know if it's any of the main characters that we've talked about, but curious to see if they publicly share.
00:34:00.554 - 00:34:25.310, Speaker C: I wanted to get your guys take on something real quick. We're seeing a lot of exploits lately. I wouldn't say direct market manipulation, but they're sort of manipulating the protocol in a way to extract value, usually a money market. And it seems like, I mean, it's wrong, but it is this weird gray area where it's like they're literally just using the software as intended and out trading the software and the other users.
00:34:25.422 - 00:34:26.366, Speaker A: Like, I don't know.
00:34:26.390 - 00:34:31.774, Speaker C: Do you, what do you guys think? Where do you stand on that? Do you think it's okay? Do you think these people are going to jail?
00:34:31.934 - 00:35:19.132, Speaker A: So it goes back to the kind of code is law, you know, two sides camp. Right? I mean, the legal thing is a completely different argument. And it does look like in many cases, these things are found to be illegal. And things like derivatives can always fall under CFTC in some way or form, shape or another. And especially if you have any us links, bad things can happen to you whether it's right or wrong. I think given it's a dark forest and there are people in Russia that are going to be using these things in North Korea that are not going to be achievable. To actually get the law enforcement involved, you do need to kind of just make the thing robust, right? Like, you can't allow those vectors even if it is wrong, you know, and you're going to get in trouble in some cases.
00:35:19.132 - 00:36:24.942, Speaker A: I think we saw some back and forth. I think Kane can try to pull up this back and forth from Catfish and Kane, the founder of Synthetix, who was making some comments about how, um, DWF is partnering with Daniela, Daniela Sesta, one of the, one of the main characters from the last cycle. There's two epic grifters teaming up and somebody responds, hey, like, isn't synthetix your protocol just got fleeced by DWF? And also like, pith is the oracle provider for it and pith is harder, was EWF. So I would say even if like, legally there's nothing that can be done for some things, there is clearly like a social backlash and a social cost sometimes. We can see a tweet here by the CEO of PiF responding to this. Mike Kael's basically saying, you know, we want to clarify that actually DWF is not one of our providers. And they said that they would onboard, but didn't actually do it.
00:36:24.942 - 00:37:03.324, Speaker A: And we have no other relationship. So there seems to be a bit of a backlash against people who are doing this manipulative behavior. And maybe this is okay because if legal enforcement is not possible because of the jurisdictions at least as like social layer, there's some immune cells that kind of come up. So I don't know if those are going to be effective and what is going to happen in the long run. I think ultimately the social pressure will help. It will put pressure on binance, on like the exchanges. It will kind of create some societal pressure to stop some of the really crazy manipulation that we're seeing on prices.
00:37:03.324 - 00:37:07.404, Speaker A: But in the meantime, it'll continue until somebody does something about it.
00:37:08.024 - 00:37:47.606, Speaker B: Yeah, and like, on the topic of security, I mean, I'm like a defi slash farmer guy, but even me, right? It's like, it's pretty scary to just use some of these protocols nowadays. Like, do I really want to deploy capital into this new money market, even if the yields are good? Do I really want to bridge to this new ecosystem? Given that bridges keeps getting attacked? What do you guys think about, I mean, I guess this is like why there's a lot of upside for being on chain just because like 90% of people don't want to deal with this. But do you think DeFi can ever get more users? I guess. Do you have, like, when's the last time you guys used on chain apps outside of spying something on you miss?
00:37:47.630 - 00:38:26.998, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I personally do still kind of interact with a lot of apps because I want to be at the forefront of what's going on, collaborate with a lot of projects. And I think through a lot of these mechanics, I want to be using them. But I will say, if you agree, if you were silicon farming, you don't want to get 7% for having the risk of four protocols stacked on top of each other. What you really want to be doing is longing and shorting a perp and creating a delta neutral position and getting paid crazy funding rates. And actually, the market is extremely inefficient right now. Like, here's some alpha. Some of these things, like even the stuff that take you, this t's stuff, a lot of it is based around, like, airdrop farming.
00:38:26.998 - 00:39:20.256, Speaker A: And when there's an airdrop farming, the funding should be negative. So BNB holders have figured it out, because BNB is the one token that when they allow it to launch pool, it's clearly like people are going to just be getting an airdrop for holding BNB through the launch pool. The funding goes negative on BNB, and as soon as the launch pool ends, it goes back down. There's no way you can make money, even though you can predict that the price will fall after the launch pool ends because the funding is negative. This is an efficient market, however, for things like Tia, Adam, like other things that are actually kind of valuable because they're paying you airdrops. The funding could still be positive if you could feel it just kind of gambling on it, even though when you long the perp, you're not getting the airdrop that you're getting when you buy spot. And so there's a huge inefficiency, and that's some alpha that I think our users, if they want to be in stables, if they want to be in delta neutral position, they can take advantage of.
00:39:20.440 - 00:39:40.524, Speaker B: Yeah, I know a notorious stablecoin farmer, and he just is staking Tia across a bunch of wallets, and he's short TIA on hyper liquid to collect funding. So it's like this delta neutral strategy. He's farming both celestia airdrops and also the hyper liquid airdrops. So, yeah, lots of, I guess, yield opportunities there.
00:39:41.144 - 00:39:48.688, Speaker A: Yeah. So until you see negative funding rates on these things, guys like you can. You can definitely be making, I don't know, just 100% hearing this conversation.
00:39:48.736 - 00:40:10.396, Speaker C: As someone that's not doing like, this funding arbitrage, it does seem to me like the yield farming of 2021 actually has become more efficient. And like that the ways to make money are now doing these, like, much more complex, let's say, like, derivatives of, like, old farming techniques, which is super interesting to me. Um, maybe that's a sign this base is advancing. I don't know.
00:40:10.460 - 00:40:22.504, Speaker A: Yeah, I wouldn't call it too complex. You know, you buy the spot and you short the perp and, and kind of especially on exchanges like uh, you know by bet. Okay. X that have this like portfolio margin. I guess even by finance has it now. You can, you can do it quite effectively.
00:40:23.204 - 00:40:49.050, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I should correct that of like in poker there's like level one thinking, level two thinking, etcetera. It feels like we've went up a level like even thicky talking about earlier like because everyone else is going to short or sell into like a hack announcement. I'm actually going to long like and trying to think about what everyone else is doing. Like I don't think that was the case. In 2021. It felt like you could like you could really get away with mid curving it whereas now you sort of like have to really think about what the other players in the system are doing.
00:40:49.242 - 00:41:02.064, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'm curious like do you kind of denominate in dollars and or like in some crypto and if you don't mind in dollars. How do you try to generate yield on stuff thats not actively being deployed in positions?
00:41:02.604 - 00:41:08.124, Speaker D: Yeah, its definitely a lot of yield. Farming this past week was really amazing because we're getting 5100 percent everywhere.
00:41:08.284 - 00:41:12.140, Speaker A: Is this funding arbitrages or are you interacting with Defi?
00:41:12.332 - 00:41:19.864, Speaker D: It's a bit of both. Well it's mostly just mostly funding arbitrage. Sometimes you qualify for some airdrops as well.
00:41:20.484 - 00:41:22.064, Speaker B: Which airdrops are you farming?
00:41:22.564 - 00:41:28.104, Speaker D: Well I am far with Tia Manta and there are a couple more.
00:41:28.684 - 00:41:30.644, Speaker B: Oh yeah, I think those are be pretty good.
00:41:30.764 - 00:41:54.444, Speaker A: I think the airdrop thing is quite a next level. Like Justin said, this is like the next level stuff. And definitely like for mantle I've been designing like a massive airdrop kind of staking campaign for later in Q one. Justin, though, you have a lot of bees. So I'm curious, do you have meth? Where do you keep your ETH? What kind of like ETH farming? Because you have ETH. You want yield on your ETH. You got a stake.
00:41:54.484 - 00:41:55.676, Speaker B: You got a damn meth.
00:41:55.820 - 00:41:56.784, Speaker A: What are you doing?
00:41:57.164 - 00:42:30.480, Speaker C: Here's the breakdown of what you want to do. You want to get. It's too late now. But the play was like six months ago to get into Eigen layer when the deposits were capped super low. So you would deposit your stake deeth like stats, Coinbase, dieth, whatever into eigen layer and you'd get the yield from staking ETH and then you'd also get like very explicitly Eigen layers, giving out points you have, like a dashboard, you see how many points you have, and you see like how many points you have relative to everyone else. So that was, in my opinion, like the best way to get a return on ETH. Uh, so I have a little bit in that, but nothing too crazy.
00:42:30.480 - 00:42:42.006, Speaker C: And then mostly holding staked ETH, Coinbase, staked ether. I don't have meth, but, uh, certainly would be open to it. Uh, are the yields different on Mandel staked ETH derivative than they are on, on Mainnet?
00:42:42.120 - 00:43:06.810, Speaker A: So right now we are giving everyone, regardless of where they, where they hold it, whether it's on l one or l two. There is just the largest yield in any ETH product. It's a 7.2% fixed yield. And we just went from like three months, we increased it to like four and a half months. So it'll be at least four and a half months, and maybe we'll increase it again. We're just subsidizing that sustainably through treasury staking.
00:43:06.810 - 00:43:38.774, Speaker A: So the treasury has hundreds of thousands of ETH, we're generating a lot of ETH, and we're actually giving it out to, it's like literally free ETH. So that's kind of probably be the best opportunity you can. Also pretty soon, I expect it will be announced quite soon. A little bit of other alpha. I probably shouldn't be saying it. I expect that maybe meth will very soon also be allowed into Eigen layer restaking. Probably not a surprise given that mantle is the inva Og.
00:43:38.774 - 00:43:45.090, Speaker A: But that's also coming soon. So you can start stacking the highest yield plus airdrops.
00:43:45.122 - 00:43:51.854, Speaker C: Plus, plus for meth is underlying. It's running staked ETH in the background, or did you guys build your own solution?
00:43:52.314 - 00:44:05.286, Speaker A: This is built natively, took many months. Wow. Let's just say very world class developers actually built this very experienced one. So.
00:44:05.390 - 00:44:08.074, Speaker C: Well, let us know if you're looking for professional validators.
00:44:08.894 - 00:44:30.994, Speaker A: Yes, yes, yes. We have some validators we can talk about more. But yeah, I'm very excited about math. I think it's quickly going to shoot up because I am very determined to just keep the thing at the highest yield out of everybody else. So in defi llama, you can check that it is the highest yield and you'll soon also be able to get all the different kind of airdrops for it.
00:44:31.294 - 00:45:03.892, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like no last cycle yield farming was a thing, right? Like, just put your lp here, get more tokens. But now everyone understands the game. The players are more sophisticated. So this cycles farming is just going to be airdrop farming, right? Just hope that these points are going to be worth something. Hope that you're going to get a bunch of these rewards. And I think that, no, I run a YouTube channel so I have access to types of content that people really like. And the airdrop content on YouTube just gets all the clicks.
00:45:03.892 - 00:45:16.104, Speaker B: And I think that coins associated with airdrop farming are just naturally going to get a bit just because it's an appealing proposition for retail. Just deposit capital here and then in three months get more tokens and whatnot.
00:45:16.564 - 00:45:24.738, Speaker A: Yeah, it's sort of like these free rolls on poker stars. You don't, you don't need a lot of money to enter but you can potentially, you know, make, make five figures which is very cool.
00:45:24.906 - 00:45:37.614, Speaker C: So Jordy, I just pulled up the meth staking. I can't believe I hadn't heard of this before. I mean this sounds like plan, but it's really not. So do you have to lock for the 7.2% apy for this double dose drive?
00:45:37.994 - 00:46:02.338, Speaker A: Yeah, no, there's none of this like blast kind of, you know, bullshit in my opinion of like locking and it's just stuck there and something for forever. Uh, you can lock and unlock, stake in on stake, get in and get out right away. Uh, you just get the 7.2 daily for just holding it. It sort of just accumulates. It's an accumulating token. So you put in one and you wait and you just get 1.7,
00:46:02.338 - 00:46:16.354, Speaker A: uh, 1.072. It's uh, it's native yield. I know that term is used a bit too much but it actually is just paying it natively in the token. So it's pure ETH. There's no like, you know, other token shit coins you're getting.
00:46:16.694 - 00:46:27.274, Speaker C: So this is almost filled up. So at that point are you going to raise the capacity or do you think Mantle will raise the capacity? Like should I guess I'm, I'm happy I know this before this episode airs tomorrow.
00:46:27.934 - 00:46:34.326, Speaker A: I would say like there's only, looks like 85,000 left. Only 85.
00:46:34.390 - 00:46:36.474, Speaker D: Justin, you could fill all of it.
00:46:36.804 - 00:46:40.316, Speaker C: Maybe half, but no, I definitely do not have 85. But like 30.
00:46:40.380 - 00:47:09.472, Speaker A: Yeah, 30,000 obviously it's more than like two thirds sort of. So I would say still open but it might fill up and it's really easy if you have Steve as well. You can just easily convert in one click. So we're using native x. There's no fees, you can just kind of. It's a bit of a vampire attack on Leido, Steve. You can, you can easily switch over if you want and just double your yield.
00:47:09.472 - 00:47:12.884, Speaker A: So it's a double. It's a double dose of meth. For.
00:47:13.784 - 00:47:17.360, Speaker B: I heard in another podcast that if you hold meth, do you get, like, airdrops?
00:47:17.392 - 00:47:46.428, Speaker A: Is that like a thing officially? Can. Cannot confirm or deny, but there, you know, I imagine that there, there could be some interesting things to do. Do with holding me then. Yeah. Like, you know, if you want to get more airdrop, maybe, maybe like, having it on the L2 is a smarter thing. But these are rumors that, you know, I'm not in any official capacity able to address such. Stop this past of the week.
00:47:46.476 - 00:47:47.624, Speaker C: We're going to keep it all.
00:47:49.804 - 00:47:55.606, Speaker A: Past of the week time. All right, Justin, what do you got for pasta?
00:47:55.790 - 00:48:27.102, Speaker C: All right, let me pull this up here and get us on the right track. So this video has been going around Twitter. We've seen a ton of different. This meme has been recycled, let's say. But I thought this was just absolutely hilarious, the volume here. But you can see someone had their parole denied and they just went after this judge and jumped the judge. And the caption here is, Mert, whenever someone posts Solana thought, and I have to say this is pretty accurate, I think a few episodes ago, I was accidentally caught on tape saying, there's nothing to do on Solana.
00:48:27.102 - 00:48:41.286, Speaker C: No one's actually using it. They're just speculating on the price. And people really jump on you. I had some nasty comments. I guess I'm the ETH maxi of the pod just for pointing that out. But you got to be careful out there. People will jump at you.
00:48:41.390 - 00:48:49.554, Speaker A: It's not so bad. You're saying you're not doing much on chain in general. So it's not just Solana, you're an all chain hater right now until, like.
00:48:49.934 - 00:48:56.294, Speaker C: Let'S say, I have like one transaction a day, let's say, across all my wallets. So I. Modest not nothing.
00:48:56.414 - 00:49:05.078, Speaker A: I'm curious, like, Vicki, do you think these, like, friend tech points that people have been trying to get on chain? Like, are those going to be worth anything once thing goes live, or has he just missed the window?
00:49:05.166 - 00:49:20.754, Speaker D: I think they still will be. It's like a real product. It's more like a bear market product, just like rollbit and what used to be maker until they rebranded and have that share split. Congratulations, Tykee. But I will.
00:49:23.574 - 00:49:24.910, Speaker B: Mid curvers win.
00:49:25.062 - 00:49:29.502, Speaker D: Is it maker mid curvers or what's the. What's the. What's the moniker that you guys use?
00:49:29.638 - 00:49:42.694, Speaker B: Well, like, I mean, Maker MKR stands for mid curve. So, like, maker is mid curve money, right? Like, if mid. If maker goes up, then it creates a walt effect for the mid curve community, which. Which trickles down to coins. Like, eat another mid kirk coin.
00:49:43.354 - 00:49:48.626, Speaker D: Do you guys already have, like, you know, the T tranny's Lido lady boys? Do you guys already have a name or.
00:49:48.650 - 00:49:50.570, Speaker B: No, no, I think. I think we're just a midcurve.
00:49:50.722 - 00:49:52.682, Speaker D: Okay. It's a good one.
00:49:52.818 - 00:50:00.578, Speaker A: Somebody was hitting out that mantle, dropped the ball. There's no mantle. Manlets. This Solana manlets already took that mantle.
00:50:00.626 - 00:50:01.722, Speaker C: Torch bearers or something.
00:50:01.778 - 00:50:03.250, Speaker A: Wait, it's actually.
00:50:03.322 - 00:50:04.614, Speaker D: They use the same letters.
00:50:05.314 - 00:50:06.746, Speaker A: Same letters? Yeah. Yeah.
00:50:06.770 - 00:50:07.640, Speaker D: Manlets.
00:50:07.802 - 00:50:10.104, Speaker C: It's an anagram, right? Yeah. Yeah.
00:50:10.564 - 00:50:16.756, Speaker A: All right, that's a strong pasta. That's. That's a solid. I don't know, eight or something. Do you have anything to match? Yeah.
00:50:16.780 - 00:50:18.892, Speaker D: Well, I had three. Let me go. Let me. Let me go.
00:50:18.948 - 00:50:20.028, Speaker B: Pick one. Give it.
00:50:20.036 - 00:50:20.944, Speaker D: Give me a second.
00:50:21.484 - 00:50:26.788, Speaker A: All right, three. Okay, I'll pick this one. Okay, you got one.
00:50:26.956 - 00:51:04.296, Speaker D: You know, in spirit of what happened with the. With the matrixport news and the news traders dumping the. Dumping bitcoin, I feel like there's a lot. There's been, like, a huge inflow of people that, like, can make a good amount of money just trading, and there's a lot of people just staring at screens 24/7 reading headlines, and just, like, reacting to news. But obviously, when this thing gets crowd out of it creates a lot of weird distortions in the market that you can definitely see. The hack stuff we talked about earlier is a weird distortion where we see if we see too many news traders trying to short the coin, it gets kind of crowded and you can kind of try to trade against them. But, yeah, this is like an archetype.
00:51:04.296 - 00:51:05.816, Speaker D: We've seen a lot of this cycle.
00:51:05.960 - 00:51:07.284, Speaker A: Is this youth on me?
00:51:07.824 - 00:51:16.604, Speaker C: It is him. Remember when his alarm went off? When there's some, like, bankruptcy. Liquidation news that came out and his phone went off in the middle of the pot and he had to jump off?
00:51:17.984 - 00:51:20.604, Speaker A: Are you afraid to go outside to not miss any news?
00:51:21.184 - 00:51:22.884, Speaker D: Yes, I am. I am.
00:51:23.744 - 00:51:24.504, Speaker B: I have a question.
00:51:24.584 - 00:51:27.736, Speaker A: So at the right, it says, the.
00:51:27.760 - 00:51:34.042, Speaker B: Johnny Silver guy says, quote unquote, uses a pee bottle. Like, have you ever used a Peabody?
00:51:34.178 - 00:51:35.450, Speaker D: I have, yes.
00:51:35.642 - 00:51:36.894, Speaker A: Oh, shit.
00:51:41.234 - 00:51:47.098, Speaker B: Once. Once. Okay. Okay. That's crazy, jody. Like, whenever you play poker, did you ever use a pee bottle.
00:51:47.266 - 00:51:50.346, Speaker A: I have not. Yeah, well, it's public.
00:51:50.450 - 00:51:51.498, Speaker D: A little bit more weird.
00:51:51.586 - 00:52:08.480, Speaker A: Well, online, you can play online. Yeah. Yeah, there. There is one guy who did it live. So Antonios fandiary famously had some bet. This ended up being a bottle. I think he got banned from the casino and I regretted his action, but he might have won a large prop bet.
00:52:08.480 - 00:52:13.736, Speaker A: Okay, this is another very solid one. Taiki, how about you?
00:52:13.840 - 00:52:27.864, Speaker B: I saw this on the timeline a couple days ago. I thought it was absolutely hilarious. So apparently there was some dev that was live streaming and it was rugging a coin called jeet on Twitch, and at the end of the stream, he accidentally leaked his face.
00:52:29.524 - 00:52:35.052, Speaker A: Why was. Why was he rugging it, like, on a stream? Like, just like troll people? Yeah.
00:52:35.068 - 00:52:41.504, Speaker B: I think he just has some God complex and wanted to just look at these comments. My brother, you rugged me. I saw your face.
00:52:43.684 - 00:52:44.236, Speaker D: Oh, man.
00:52:44.260 - 00:52:55.074, Speaker B: You son of a bitch. I will find you, like, wicked two g at the top right. Oh, my God. Thanks, G. Coin soul is the. Is the live stream. It's on Solana.
00:52:55.734 - 00:52:56.926, Speaker A: There is a very.
00:52:57.110 - 00:52:59.054, Speaker D: He did warn what he was going to do.
00:52:59.174 - 00:52:59.630, Speaker A: That's fair.
00:52:59.662 - 00:53:02.894, Speaker B: That's fair. Yeah, people, people knew what they were getting into with the ticker.
00:53:02.934 - 00:53:03.582, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:53:03.758 - 00:53:36.614, Speaker A: All right, well, solid, solid addition here. Mine is a visconti's tweet. So scanty's and I used to have some online beef because of Olympus Dow. We were kind of on opposite side, opposite sides of that one. But we, we met once at a conference in Tokyo, and now we're like besties. So shout out to my buddy Fiscontis out there if you're listening, but he has an interesting tweet here. He says, if you hate seeing people dumber than you making more money than you on stuff, that's absolutely idiotic.
00:53:36.614 - 00:54:10.430, Speaker A: You will have a bad time in next year or so. It's absolutely true. The left covers have been completely crushing. Not just dog coins, rooster coins, all kinds of meme stuff has been performing the best out of, you know, anything that is semi intelligent. So I can definitely relate to this. I even like, I'm scared to even try to touch that stuff because I feel like it will mid curve me. Because if, you know, if I start moving left, I end up more in the middle and I kind of, like, mess it all up.
00:54:10.430 - 00:54:16.242, Speaker A: So I try not to look at the left curve stuff too much as.
00:54:16.258 - 00:54:30.386, Speaker C: The guy they placed in the top right of the steady lads. Breakdown on the curve scale. I'm, you know, I'm far right curve right. So I see this all the time. Every. Everyone is making more money than me, and everyone's dumber than me, so there's.
00:54:30.410 - 00:54:32.134, Speaker B: Some self confidence right there.
00:54:33.994 - 00:54:34.794, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:54:34.914 - 00:54:36.346, Speaker B: I'm happy to be a mid curve.
00:54:36.490 - 00:54:45.732, Speaker A: You're happy? Do you guys ever try to get, like, these, like, completely left curve plays and just be like, what is the dumbest thing that will work right now? Like, this. This will work.
00:54:45.828 - 00:54:47.412, Speaker B: Every time I do that, I just get wrecked.
00:54:47.508 - 00:54:54.724, Speaker D: Yeah. I feel like you can try to transform a left curve narrative into a right curve one if you rationalize it a certain way.
00:54:54.844 - 00:54:59.184, Speaker B: I guess, like, meme coins is, like, this is, like, this social currency of the Internet.
00:54:59.564 - 00:55:09.644, Speaker D: I do think my contrarian take is that we might have just topped Jan one on alls, so I don't know. I think this guy could be wrong. I'm, like, prepared for scenario or just go down only.
00:55:10.304 - 00:55:31.792, Speaker A: Wow. But a lot of stuff has continued to pump through the day. Like, we saw Sega to $0.90. We saw some other interesting coins kind of pump maybe a little bit over their skis, where there's not necessarily the technology or aum quite ready there. Maybe it will come, but you think we might have peaked already?
00:55:31.968 - 00:55:48.550, Speaker D: I think certain names can still do well, but I think know total market cap for all. I'm just like. I think it's, like, more likely the market's positioned for. So that's. I'm still long, like, all the time. I'm still long bitcoin, but, like, I'm just getting ready for that scenario. I think it's, like, not unlikely.
00:55:48.662 - 00:56:03.198, Speaker A: Yeah. I think that was one of your predictions for 2024, that we would have a solid news event. All right, so strong pastas. We don't have a live stream to pick a winner. I think. I think. What do you think, Taika? I think you and I a little bit behind.
00:56:03.198 - 00:56:06.068, Speaker A: I think it's between Justin and thickie on this one.
00:56:06.116 - 00:56:15.664, Speaker B: Oh, damn. Like, my. My jig coin was behind. I personally like thickies because I know for a fact that, you know, he's out there with the pee bottle almost blind.
00:56:18.244 - 00:56:19.524, Speaker D: I don't even notice that guy.
00:56:19.564 - 00:56:31.382, Speaker A: You know, I think. I think Justin was. Was definitely, like, a contender. But given that, I think. I think you had a recent win, Justin. We'll throw it to thickie this time.
00:56:31.508 - 00:56:37.482, Speaker C: I had one win over 24 episodes. I've had one win. We leave it up to the viewers in the comments.
00:56:37.658 - 00:56:39.334, Speaker D: It was only on his birthday.
00:56:39.634 - 00:56:40.414, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:41.594 - 00:56:43.614, Speaker B: It's like a city gift.
00:56:45.434 - 00:57:12.504, Speaker A: All right, we'll make sure we give you another one next birthday, Justin. All right, well, great episode. I hope every enjoyed it. Obviously, we're kind of in the middle of a very active period for crypto, so we're looking forward to seeing how the ETF news plays out over the next few days. Really? Everything's supposed to happen now? Maybe it'll already happen by the time people are watching this and curious to see the market reaction. So we'll catch up with you guys next week. Take care.
