00:00:12.040 - 00:00:12.672, Speaker A: Hello everyone.
00:00:12.705 - 00:00:29.623, Speaker B: Welcome to the inaugural episode of Steady Lads. So my name is Justin. I'm the co founder of Astaria. I also have a DeFi focused YouTube channel. I'm joined by Tyche. He is a humble farmer and influencer. He's a pretty prolific YouTube channel in this space.
00:00:29.623 - 00:01:00.631, Speaker B: Going over yield farm, yield farming. We also have Jordy. He's a full time game theorizer. He is the CEO of Selena Capital, a multistrategy hedge fund. And last but not least, we have Alex, who is a junior analyst at Scimitar Capital and also a prolific threader. So welcome everyone. I think the big news that we want to discuss today is right before this podcast started recording, we got these GDP numbers that US GDP growth was I think something like 2.4%
00:01:00.631 - 00:01:15.915, Speaker B: annualized over the last quarter, which is obviously pretty impressive. I think that's good news. I think that means that a recession is not imminent. But let's start with you, Jordy. What are your thoughts? Is this, is this bullish or is is good news good news now or is good news bad news? What are your thoughts?
00:01:16.535 - 00:01:35.615, Speaker C: I think we're at the point where there's not much expectation of further rate hikes. You know, we just got one yesterday, maybe we get one more, but that's it. So good news is good news right now. And I think the equity markets are showing it. Crypto, not as much, but you know, hopefully at some point the boomers throw some of their shekels to us and we can kind of pump our bags as well.
00:01:35.915 - 00:02:02.809, Speaker D: Yeah, it kind of feels like 30k is like fair value for bitcoin. There's like not that many buyers above, not that many sellers below. There's like not that much like new retail interest. Like I was kind of hoping the XRP news would bring in more retail and like maybe bid our altcoin bags. But I feel like the current bidders of altcoins, they don't really care whether coins are securities or not. It just seems like there's not that much like overall interest in crypto.
00:02:02.977 - 00:02:34.253, Speaker B: Yeah, why do you think that is? Just people got burnt last year and it takes time. I mean, I find myself doubting this idea that we could just live in these four year cycles and that there's always going to be another cycle and it always has to happen on the same time frame. It almost seems too easy. Right. Like when everyone's expecting something in a market. Like how can that be true? How is it true? I guess. Alex, I would, I would throw this to you how is it true that we can just live under the assumption that oh, starting in January, retail interest will pick up again and we'll be in this, you know, the start of a new bull market.
00:02:34.253 - 00:02:44.127, Speaker B: I mean the having can't really matter, right? Like going from 2% to 1% inflation is sort of irrelevant in my opinion. It didn't do anything for eth. Right, Yeah.
00:02:44.231 - 00:03:31.163, Speaker A: I think it's like an interesting coordination point for people just to throw money into the asset space. I think historically it has coincided with new innovation entering the space and I think at the current state of innovation, at least in the crypto markets and the crypto sort of tech stack, there hasn't been anything that new from last cycle. I guess the uniswap innovation of giving liquidity to long tail assets, like something of that kind of scale hasn't really like attracted, you know, new capital in is like my opinion. So I think that's the reason why there's like a laggard effect right now in crypto compared to equities and risk. But like we have seen signs of froth in the equities market like slowly begin to inch back in. So as Jordy said, like maybe they'll start throwing like their, their winnings into the crypto casino again.
00:03:31.259 - 00:03:51.369, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm curious, do you guys all think we need something new to kick things off again? Like, so we had DEFI summer kicked off a massive bull run and then that sort of faded. Right. But NFTs propped us up, that's my theory at least, and created all of this demand for eth. I mean, do we need a new thing at the scale of DeFi and NFTs just to start a new cycle.
00:03:51.417 - 00:03:57.305, Speaker C: Or will we got worldcoin? What do you think about worldcoin? That's pretty new.
00:03:57.345 - 00:03:57.965, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:58.345 - 00:04:30.955, Speaker B: Yeah. I wanted to talk about this because I was having a chat with some other crypto friends and we were just sort of debating like is World Coin a scam because the tokenomics are scammy or is it a real project? I'm sort of of the mindset that you have to separate the project from the tokenomics and I think that, I mean, I think this is a real project. I don't think Sam Altman would risk it all, so to speak. Right. He's got a lot going on. He's certainly like a, you know, prolific person in the tech space. Why would he risk risk at all on a scam project? It's just meant to dump on retail.
00:04:30.955 - 00:04:32.907, Speaker B: It doesn't really make sense to me.
00:04:33.011 - 00:05:07.377, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I definitely don't think it's a scam. It's not an intended scam, but at the same time, when you're dealing with cryptocurrency, if the currency part is misdesigned, then your project is crap, regardless of your intentions. So, yeah, I don't think he's. He's obviously a very wealthy individual that could maximize his wealth through OpenAI. And I think his motivations might be different. But I mean, we should dig into the details of the tokenomics and what the project is. But I don't know.
00:05:07.377 - 00:05:08.565, Speaker C: What do you guys think?
00:05:09.105 - 00:05:54.563, Speaker D: Yeah, I think more about it from a retail perspective, like capital inflows. This is kind of like a mass onboarding process where it's like, if you think about it, maybe you meet, if you think about like, I don't know, like doing something with your friends, like, this is something you can do. It's like, hey, like instead of getting lunch, like let's scan our eyeballs and make like 50 bucks or something. And I think I saw videos of some iris, like the orb line at like New York. Like there's like an hour long wait and people are like just spending like 20 seconds per eyeball and just, you know, doing all that. And like, if it's also built on the base chain, it can also like create new wallets. So I feel like it's kind of priming retail on the entire market of like, okay, it's okay to own a crypto wallet.
00:05:54.563 - 00:06:17.851, Speaker D: Oh, I have like $40 on chain or something along those lines. So I think that part is bullish. But I don't really think the design of World Coin is meant to be something that supposed to be investable. I don't think Sam Altman is trying to make World Coins something to make people super rich. Right. It's trying to be like this UBI coin. Yeah, I mean, the tokenomics are pretty insane.
00:06:17.851 - 00:06:25.215, Speaker D: It's like most coins are going to market makers, and last time I checked it was like a $30 billion FTV or something, or maybe it was higher.
00:06:25.555 - 00:07:02.279, Speaker B: But let me ask you guys this, right? Like, if the goal is to be a UBI and they want to distribute like a reasonable amount of money to people monthly, do these tokenomics not make sense? Right. Do you not want to start with a low float coin that will give like the initial people that have signed up? Like, I think it's something like $50 a month for, for doing it. By the way, as a side note, tomorrow I actually have an Appointment to scan my eyeballs. So I'm not concerned. Yeah, I'm not concerned about the privacy issues. I mean, I use face ID 20 times a day on my iPhone with Microsoft Surface laptops, I've used their face ID or scanning product. I have global entry.
00:07:02.279 - 00:07:11.105, Speaker B: So, like, when I go through the airport, there's some facial recognition. Like, I don't think this is the place, place to draw the line, if that makes sense. I think this is something worth trying as a user.
00:07:12.605 - 00:08:15.763, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, I think I almost view, like, I guess in response to your tokenomics point, I almost feel these crypto projects as trying to create a network effect. And I guess you can almost view it as sort of economy, like a nation state where the total value of the token is kind of like maybe like their gdp. And I think, like, at the end of the day, like, a strong token price will attract, I guess, immigrants to your state. And we see this, like, issue with Seoul where, like, because of Solana, with like, such, because of the huge, I guess, overhang of FTX supply, it's been hard to, like, convince people to like, move essentially to that country and, you know, go in and build in Solana, learn a new language and basically immigrate to the country. And it does have a huge effect. So, like, making sure that tokenomics is like very, you know, set well from the very beginning, in my opinion is something that, like, I think we've learned from the previous cycle is like, this thing can really bite you in the ass if you give away too many tokens in a concentrated amount to, like, actors that aren't aligned with you.
00:08:15.763 - 00:08:43.965, Speaker A: So in a way, like, opening up this project in a way that like, market makers that are very aligned because of their call option, we can dig into, like, the exact details later just for the readers that aren't familiar with it. But yeah, the market makers that hold 100 million tokens out of the 110 million circulating, they're very aligned to keep the price up, which will attract new users. And they can basically have the only source of supply come in as like, new users that are onboarding and scanning their irises, essentially.
00:08:44.985 - 00:09:12.045, Speaker B: Yeah, I found this, this thread from Matt here. If anyone wants to chime in, feel free to, but you can see some of the metrics here. So 43 million world coins were airdropped. 100 million world coins were loaned over 3 months to non US market makers. So you can see here that market makers controlled 95% of the float at launch. Anything you guys want to Add there regarding details, I mean certainly that's a very high outlier, right, relative to other token launches.
00:09:13.625 - 00:09:37.343, Speaker C: I mean it's true that they've set a benchmark price starting from $2. And we do see that the price is by some magic trading around $2. A bit over $2. There's definitely an effect of that. Now whether this is, you know, the important part of the project, I don't think it really matters. You know, it's a three month loan. It's not like this is the long term holders.
00:09:37.343 - 00:10:21.519, Speaker C: This is kind of like the temporary games being played. And I'm sure there's some heavy bags that can get made if this thing starts to pump and people start like gamma hedging because they don't have to return the tokens. Basically like at $2.80 they can keep all the tokens and just pay back $2.80 per token. So if you sell some at 4 or $5, you've, you know, you've made millions of dollars. So you know, that aside, I have a lot of concerns about this project and you know, people I've called out, let's say like Olympus Dao and Axie and Luna in the past and people always ask me like, you know, what's the new, what's the next one? And for months now I haven't had something to like point to, but now I do.
00:10:21.519 - 00:10:52.115, Speaker C: So I think Worldcoin potentially will be the next Luna. And the reason I say this is like you have a similar thing where it just tries to make money out of nothing, like base money. What is base money? Oh, it's world coin. It's like a new currency. And like what exactly like what is backing this? Like who's going to be on the bid of this thing? It's very unclear. It's basically like VCs and people that see that there is, you know, millions of people signed up and so you kind of have this like VC inflow. This is exactly what happened with axie though.
00:10:52.115 - 00:11:25.953, Speaker C: Like third world country civilians were making $50 which is a lot of money for them by participating and making metrics look good which then get passed on to VCs. So not to shit on any VCs in particular, but this to me seems like the kind of thing that can grow into a bubble and then just burst when people realize this thing is not backed by government and it's not Bitcoin, which is, you know, digital gold. It's just, it's just some random coin. Like what are we doing exactly so.
00:11:26.009 - 00:11:44.147, Speaker B: Is your point like there, there is some value in bringing identity on chain and being like the base layer for that, which is what they're doing. But it's not even close to the 23 billion fully diluted valuation that Worldcoin's sitting at. Is that the theory? Like there's something here, but like it just doesn't make sense of this valuation or.
00:11:44.251 - 00:12:21.421, Speaker C: No, my theory is like this doesn't need a token. If it's a technology company that is giving other Companies, it's a B2B company that says, hey, we've scanned a billion people's eyeballs. If you want to interact with them in a way that's civil resistant in the digital world, do airdrops or things like this, you can do it through our system and we'll charge you 20bps and you can do whatever you want. That's a great business. Doesn't need a token. Right? Like, sure. The point, the point of the token is to give investors money back maybe, but so then that's, I'm kind of also okay with that because you're funding, you're funding the whole thing.
00:12:21.421 - 00:12:55.011, Speaker C: But the problem I have is this UBI vision. Like first of all, it's very, I don't know, like it's kind of imagining this world in the future where some AI has made countless wealth and we need to redistribute it to everybody because like everyone's poor and like some Altman and like Elon Damasabis, you know, have like $100 trillion and everybody else has nothing. And then as our overlords are kind of like sprinkling in some wld coins, whatever, to people, this is the only thing that makes sense. Right.
00:12:55.123 - 00:12:58.411, Speaker D: And it's like a hedge for that.
00:12:58.443 - 00:12:59.815, Speaker A: Is it not kind of beautiful?
00:13:01.255 - 00:13:27.735, Speaker C: Sure. I mean, I don't think that's a reality. I think what's going to happen is like the US government and the Chinese government are going to start, you know, making these technologies classified and it's going to be like some kind of Cold war stuff. And the governments themselves will control the wealth. You know, like they have the military and they have like the intelligence agencies. So if they decide to give money to their people, they're going to do it through their CBDCs. They're not going to give it to like people in other countries.
00:13:27.735 - 00:13:30.295, Speaker C: I don't know. That's how I see it.
00:13:30.675 - 00:13:49.251, Speaker A: They can't airdrop it in a lot of restricted countries, including the US right now. So like, I guess they've, they've basically explicitly stated we're not going to touch your citizens. But I, I kind of view it as a ways, like, oh, I'm gonna build like a Nate. Like Sam Altman is going to build a nation state and these like the financial rails where he can distribute like money to his, his serfs.
00:13:49.443 - 00:13:52.935, Speaker C: Is it his money? Like, whose money is it? Like, who's gonna be on the bid?
00:13:53.675 - 00:14:15.055, Speaker A: I mean, if you control the supply tight enough and you create a meme that's strong enough, then eventually it will have value, right? As a token. I started off with a very pessimistic view. When I shorted Worldcoin at 2.5 ish, I covered it too. And then I started thinking when it didn't go down, when it did break down from two, I was thinking, like, you know what, maybe this thing has a future. I don't know.
00:14:15.875 - 00:14:37.615, Speaker D: I guess bubbles form when you don't know how to value something, right? Jody, would you be more for it if, for example, instead of tokens, it was like a soulbound NFT or like a soulbound token where you can't really transfer it. After you verify your identity, you get this NFT or soulbound token and that kind of verifies your identity. Do you think that's a better model? And they just did a token for.
00:14:38.275 - 00:15:13.261, Speaker C: A VC exit that's a better model. The currency aspect is my main concern. This thing can start gaining monetary value because nobody still has figured out exactly why does ETH have monetary value but not Solana? Like, you know, there's these things that we're still kind of figuring out as a community, as a society, as digital natives. And it has the potential to start, like bubbling up. Or people think like, what matters is, you know, number of holders, and it has a billion holders at some point. So it just has value. And I have a concern around, like, the volatility of the price.
00:15:13.261 - 00:15:47.225, Speaker C: And why are we creating a situation where. I don't know if you've seen, but people are selling other people's eyeballs now. Like, if I want to go around like my village and scan everyone and then package that up and sell it to hedge funds like in New York that want to. Oh, I'm just going to. Today we did a tranche. We bought a tranche of 500,000 prime, prime eyeballs from Southeast Asia. Like, that can happen, right? Like, this is kind of what we're designing.
00:15:47.845 - 00:15:56.909, Speaker D: It's not bad though, right? If these 500,000 people make some money, if they opt in. I mean, I don't know if they're screwed.
00:15:56.957 - 00:16:01.945, Speaker B: Right. If World Court actually works, then they've lost the ability to participate, right?
00:16:02.645 - 00:16:03.661, Speaker D: I guess so, yeah.
00:16:03.733 - 00:16:18.031, Speaker B: It seems like an unsolvable problem. I agree with that. It's like an extremely complex problem of how do you. Yes, you can prove that someone's a human, but you can't prove that they still own that account. Right. That's sort of like the, in my opinion, like one of the biggest issues with self custody. Right.
00:16:18.031 - 00:16:32.447, Speaker B: Like, we can't all be issued a private key at birth, whether it's with World Coin or some government chain, because you can lose your keys, right. Or you can sell your identity. So it seems like I just don't know how they're going to go about solving that. And it doesn't seem like they have a plan yet.
00:16:32.511 - 00:16:41.155, Speaker A: Don't you just have to keep scanning your eyeball? Just. Can it just do a photo recognition of your eyeball from the app and just make it so every time you want to sign a transaction, just scan your eyeball.
00:16:42.135 - 00:16:47.791, Speaker B: I wasn't aware if that's what they're doing, but that seems like a smart plan. I don't know, Jordy, you're shaking your head.
00:16:47.943 - 00:17:10.953, Speaker C: Well, I mean, that means they need to keep scanning you and verifying. Then you start getting into the privacy and the data aspect. It's definitely not. It makes sense. What are you saying would be better as a wallet kind of thing? But right now I think my design is like they, they don't keep that data where they, where they can keep reverifying, right?
00:17:11.009 - 00:17:14.777, Speaker A: Oh, they said they delete the eyeball data, right? Okay.
00:17:14.921 - 00:17:16.593, Speaker B: But they have some unique identifier.
00:17:16.649 - 00:17:25.045, Speaker C: All the app would tell you is that like you are part of the program, but they don't know if it's the same person that scanned it today or tomorrow.
00:17:26.145 - 00:17:49.227, Speaker D: Would it be able to offer like under collateralized lending? Like if you're, if you're like digital identity is like under a certain bucket and you verify that like you're a good actor in this space and you have X dollars of wealth, then can that enable like other use cases of crypto that currently is like unsolved? Because right now like under collateralized lending, like it only works for like KYC parties.
00:17:49.291 - 00:18:07.331, Speaker C: It wouldn't help for this. I mean all this does like, you know, you can read like Vitalik's post about this, but it's just kind of like a binary. Like. Yes. No. Has this person scanned their eyeball? The soul band NFT idea you have. You know, is maybe more aligned with starting to differentiate different types of NFTs and different types of, of behavior.
00:18:07.331 - 00:18:10.363, Speaker C: But no, this wouldn't, this wouldn't help on that side.
00:18:10.539 - 00:18:41.375, Speaker B: Also, to Jordy's earlier point, right. If you can sell your identity, which people will do, and I'm sure I've actually read reports that people have done that right. Then you can, you know, like you could imagine someone that's a scammer buying up a, you know, a thousand different scans, trying to see what under collateralized loans they can get. And then once they're on chain, there's, you know, nothing keeping them there. So step out. But Alex, you were saying US people are blocked. When I scan my eyeballs tomorrow, does that mean I'm not getting the $50 stimulus each month or what's happening?
00:18:42.995 - 00:18:47.363, Speaker A: I can go verify. But like I thought US citizens weren't allowed to scan their eyeballs.
00:18:47.459 - 00:18:57.335, Speaker C: Or you can scan but you don't get the coin because it's securities law. It's, it's not. You can scan. I think you can be part of it. But yeah, you might not get your 52.50.
00:18:58.475 - 00:19:01.139, Speaker A: So for you.
00:19:01.227 - 00:19:17.627, Speaker B: So they, they match the identity to a nation state then? Because I thought they were just like scanning your eyeball and there's some unique identifier attached to it and it gets paired with your World quite app account. But you're telling me I can't just run a VPN on my phone and. But they always know I'm a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident.
00:19:17.731 - 00:19:23.699, Speaker C: I mean, you're the only one out of us that's going to do it. So you, you're the one. Tomorrow you'll tell us, you know, you.
00:19:23.707 - 00:19:25.003, Speaker B: Might be forced to.
00:19:25.179 - 00:19:25.931, Speaker D: Huh?
00:19:26.083 - 00:19:29.895, Speaker B: You might be forced to. If this is the income of the world in the future.
00:19:30.435 - 00:20:03.375, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know. I mean if this is supposed to be an inequality project, I understand the sentiment. Like I've been talking about inequality being like the topic of the next 10 years consistently and I really believe that this is going to be a huge problem. And actually like all these GDP numbers we talked about and stuff, this is just because they've created more inequality, right? Like they've like back backstop the banks, all the bond buying, one to one par. You get all your money back even though you've had losses. This creates like more like inequality. So ultimately like looking for solutions is really important.
00:20:03.375 - 00:20:24.885, Speaker C: And this is, you know, I have to give them credit. Like this is a solution that's been tried. I don't Think it's going to be a good solution, but I appreciate the idea and I think we're going to keep talking about worldcoin for years to come because this, this thing, I think we'll, we'll at some point get into bubble territory and it'll be, it'll be something that we'll, we'll have to evaluate quite a bit.
00:20:25.385 - 00:20:48.325, Speaker B: Nice. I think this topic is on a similar vein for what we wanted to chat about next, which is real world assets. I know this is a clock, a topic close to your heart. Tikey, I know you've been doing a lot of research there and publishing a lot of that on your YouTube channel. Do you want to just give us an overview of what's happening in the real world asset space, where you think it's headed over the next couple weeks and months and whatnot and then we'll dive into it.
00:20:49.065 - 00:21:51.755, Speaker D: Yeah. So I was, I've been doing a lot of thinking on like what can actually end like this defi bear market. And if you think like fundamentally like the, in 2020 the volume market was started because Fed cut, Fed cut rates to zero and then you know, people went out the risk curve seeking higher rates and you know, capital flowed on chain and then as soon as the Fed started raising rates, capital flood the chain because now you can clip five, five and a quarter in short term T bills and it's basically impossible right now for DEFI to compete with that. There's like no on chain strategies that you can do in a safe way to offer like 6, 7, 8% without taking on like you know like crazy smart contract risk. And most of that is like subsidized anyways by like token inflation. So I was thinking, okay, like how can, how can, how can DEFI actually compete the risk free rate? And I think there's some cool things happening with like the real world asset front where there's a bunch of projects tokenizing T bills on chain. And right now like maker is like one of the bigger ones doing this.
00:21:51.755 - 00:22:48.093, Speaker D: You can currently stake DAI and earn a 3.49% with a DAI savings rate. And of course it's not perfect, right? I mean like the DAI staking some of that themselves. There's like block tower that's taking like 1% and it's not really that like that efficient but if you kind of think about it, right, you can actually take these tokenized C bills, maybe collateralize it and like do these various looping strategies where maybe if you like loop it like five times, you can offer like a 10% stablecoin yield and you know exactly who the counterparty is. And this can actually, actually scale because, you know, like maker can keep buying T bills, other projects can continue to buy T bills. And I feel like we've been in this PVP market where we're just trying to take money from each other, especially with new retail interest. But I feel like with tokenized T bills, you can actually create a PVE market where capital is flowing from off chain sources like the U.S.
00:22:48.093 - 00:23:23.899, Speaker D: government interest payments directly on chain. And I feel like this can actually not immediately, but slowly catalyze a defi bull market and kind of create this multiplier effect where money from these interest payments can go to on chain, like stable coin holders, and then eventually that money is going to flow into other coins and then slowly create this economic multiplier on chain effect. And it's kind of like an idea that I've been toying around with. I'm pretty interested in hearing Jordi's thoughts because I know, I really appreciate your.
00:23:23.987 - 00:24:07.743, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, look, this whole topic for me is, is what we experience in crypto and like, for example, Ethereum, right? You have staked Ethereum and 30% of people are staking whatever number is 25% and they're diluting like the other people because they're getting rewards. And this is exactly what is happening with the U.S. government. There's this 5%, 6% coupon. If you're not staking, then you're just getting diluted compared to everybody else. And they're competitively like making real money against you. And so like the 50 to $100 billion of stable coins that's being like stuck in USDC and USDT, we're just kind of getting diluted by, you know, in this case, the circle and tether, who are, who are kind of making the profit.
00:24:07.743 - 00:25:01.035, Speaker C: But everybody who has money on chain in stable coins is getting diluted. And so what we're starting to see now is like a bridging of the gap because people are like, well, you know, you got to give me something because otherwise like, you know, I'll take 4% and maybe you can cut 1%, but I need to get something. So we're seeing a variety of projects and I'm advising the mantle treasury right now, which is vex bit out treasury, which has, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars of stable coins. And we're, we're looking and evaluating, like there's quite a few coming to market. I've seen like three or four recently that are, you know, doing the legal work to actually be able to provide a whitelisted version of on chain like yield basically. And the cuts are very reasonable, very reasonable. Like I've seen 10, 20bps, like very, very small cuts so you actually get 90% of the yield or more in some cases.
00:25:01.035 - 00:25:42.137, Speaker C: Now like a lot of these are whitelisted so you have to KYC and there are projects that are potentially trying to bring this to retail users. It's a little bit tricky but there might be a way that you take the whitelisted asset which is going to be in a curve pool and the curve pool will be only accessible to KYC institutions, but those institutions can potentially interact with it and then issue a wrapper token that is accessible to retail. There is some legal mumbo jumbo but you're basically creating enough loops where it becomes legal to provide this yield, you know, any, any djen that, that wants it on chain.
00:25:42.321 - 00:26:17.985, Speaker B: It's like the you know, Nexus Mutual, their NXM token is a security but they just have a wrapper for W&XM and, and it's freely transferable but it does trade at a pretty significant discount. I think for some reason I, I wanted to throw to you and Jordan out or to Jordy and Alex. So I know Tyche's bullish on the maker token itself. One thing I've been thinking about and I'm probably just middle curving this but like how can a project where its sole source of revenue is from the risk free rate outperform the risk free rate when it always is like has fees that it's. So it's going to earn less. Right. Like the treasury is earning less.
00:26:17.985 - 00:26:43.615, Speaker B: They're paying out a 3.5% die savings rate but that's actually going to scale up to 8%. There's going to be a variable die savings rate. In addition they have to pay the actual custodians a fee. So are you just betting on maker or is the bet here just that the narrative around maker is positive? Right. Like how can the coin itself where it's only revenue sources T bills outperform the T bills. What are your guys thoughts there?
00:26:43.775 - 00:27:33.085, Speaker D: Yeah, I can answer that first like I don't really view maker as like a 9 month, 12 month hold. It's more so in the short term with the lack of retail interest with like new capital inflows. I just feel like the narrative around the maker is pretty strong. Just having this one way capital inflow that's predictable, consistent. I think the market does value that. And there's also this narrative around the end game that Rune, the founder of Maker talks about where okay, we're going to rebrand Maker, we're going to rebrand dai, we're going to do a token split, we're going to introduce the subdao farming where you can stake Maker, stake DAI and earn all these new governance tokens. And personally I'm kind of thinking about selling the news like roughly when that happens like or not, if not before.
00:27:33.085 - 00:28:23.265, Speaker D: It's just more like a multi month swing for me. I don't really expect Maker to like outperform like no, like whatever is pumping on any given week. But I think when there's like macro uncertainty around crypto, especially with like the Bitcoin etf, you know, outcome happening relatively soon, people often fear like the Binance DOJ indictment and whatnot. I just feel like in the short term like Maker is kind of like a defensive trade but with the stuff that forming and then game, I think it can also be viewed as a defensive yet like it's like semi momentum driven because you know Rune is like really focusing on growing the circulating supply of dai and I think you know like with the enhanced DAI savings I think that's actually possible. But that's kind of how I view it. It's not, I don't really intend on like holding maker for like 12 months. It's more like okay, like maybe into Q4, something along those lines.
00:28:23.565 - 00:28:29.795, Speaker C: Vicki, how long does Shimmer Capital hold hold coins? What's the average holding time?
00:28:31.615 - 00:28:59.545, Speaker A: Probably like three days to two weeks I'd say. Wow, maybe shorter. Maybe an hour to two weeks. But question for you guys. I don't understand how you can get around how you can regard the non KYC part of basically just getting treasury yields on chain. It seems like the moments like Lazarus Group or where Beerus starts getting yield on his stable coins, it kind of just topples the whole thing. Right.
00:29:00.125 - 00:29:30.471, Speaker C: So you have the entity that's actually custody the treasuries and issuing the token. So they can put the treasuries in bny Mellon, whatever, they can choose from custodian and they can issue the token. That's all regulatory, legal. They get all the services and they say that only KYC people can interact with this. They can minredeem? Yes, minredeem. They're the only ones doing it and only KYC institutions can min redeem. Now you can have some defi protocol that says okay, we're going to kyc.
00:29:30.471 - 00:29:49.865, Speaker C: So then we can interact with your token. We're going to buy a bunch of your tokens, taking money from retail to do it and then we'll give them a receipt token that we've issued. So this is kind of like the arb. So the person minting redeeming from the US government directly is not interacting with retail. There is this middle layer. So that's the thing that we might see.
00:29:50.205 - 00:30:24.259, Speaker D: And there's also. Sorry to interrupt, but there's also protocols like Flux where you can lend out stablecoins to these KYC parties and then maybe these KYC parties are willing to pay up to 4% to borrow stable coins to clip that arbitrage. And that's one way to allow permissionless to risk free rate arb. It's never going to be 5%. It's going to be on flux. Right now it's like 4% but if you compare it like that to like basically zero rate, I mean like AAVE rage is like 1, like 1 2% or whatnot. I think that's pretty attractive.
00:30:24.259 - 00:30:32.971, Speaker D: And as this happens, like as the market becomes more efficient and competitive, it also should increase like the, like the lending rate on ABE.
00:30:33.003 - 00:30:33.171, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:33.203 - 00:31:02.007, Speaker D: Because if you can borrow DAI for 3%, stake it for like 4, 5, 6% then it's going to bring the on chain yields just up. And I'm kind of betting on like this slow process to eventually bring in new money. And that's kind of like my idea that I have for the beginning of the defi bull market. Maybe it's like a multi quarter, multi year thing. But I think the point is we see the light at the end of the tunnel is my opium makes sense.
00:31:02.191 - 00:31:24.217, Speaker A: But it seems like the loophole shouldn't work because you could own a bunch, you could literally own SP 500. You can issue a token like a KYC person and then they can just resell it and wrap it. I feel like that would obviously get some regulatory ire. Why does it work for treasury securities and not just regular equities for example?
00:31:24.401 - 00:31:28.445, Speaker C: That's a great idea. I think someone's going to probably do that in the next six months.
00:31:30.905 - 00:31:32.481, Speaker D: I know a few broadcasting.
00:31:32.633 - 00:31:55.637, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good idea. There's no reason why not to do that apart from the fact that it's. It's a lot easier to get access to S P500 through you know like interactive brokers or through like some other CFD kind of provider than it is to get like actual treasury yield. And so maybe the need is not as high But I don't know if that's true, Jordy.
00:31:55.661 - 00:32:13.417, Speaker B: Like I mean in the States here, anyone that uses basically any financial services company like your money is held in a money market fund. Like I use Fidelity. Right. And it's just automatically put in a Fidelity money market fund. I think it's called Spac Spaxx and it just buys short duration treasuries. Right?
00:32:13.521 - 00:32:23.565, Speaker C: Yeah, but this is not, I mean the whole point of all of this I think is 100% not for Americans. This is to give access to Eurodollar users across the world.
00:32:25.225 - 00:32:31.805, Speaker B: Is it not possible to buy or is it much harder to buy T bills as a non American? I mean what's that process like for you guys?
00:32:33.195 - 00:33:01.075, Speaker C: I don't think the process exists. I mean, wow. You can, it's, you know, it's hard and like buying a Treasury bond, you know these things are like million dollar a clip for, for like one bond. If somebody just has 100k, they just want to get some yield on it. Like this is actually a good use case for crypto and it does make sense to, to have something that you know, charges 10% and lets people around the world have access to dollar yield.
00:33:01.575 - 00:33:09.503, Speaker B: So you're an advisor for the new Bit Dao protocol they renamed. Correct. So can you share a little bit about what you guys are thinking there?
00:33:09.639 - 00:33:42.125, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean the treasury has been holding about a billion dollars of Ethan Stablecoins and not getting any yield on it for you know, quite a while now, many months. And there are safe ways and legal ways where you can start getting yield. And for the Stablecoin side. Yeah, like we're talking to all these people that are. I don't want to show a specific one because there's three or four or five, but there are several that are doing all the legal framework that can start to offer direct access to those yields.
00:33:43.065 - 00:34:05.903, Speaker B: Very cool. Awesome. We wanted to save the last five or so minutes of this podcast for a segment that we're experimenting with called How Degen am I for doing this. We all came with know something where we've been interested in over the last couple weeks. It's more on the fun side for me. Last week I was on our company off site. We went to D.C.
00:34:05.903 - 00:34:23.317, Speaker B: and I think on the last day of the off site we discovered hamster racing Hamsters gg and we all just had a blast betting on these hamsters until we found out that the races are pre recorded. And that sort of like took away all the appeal for us. Did you guys participate in this at all is 2D gen for you guys.
00:34:23.431 - 00:34:36.538, Speaker C: I have not participated, but I've seen it on crypto Twitter or Crypto X now. I don't know what we're calling it, but I've seen people talking about it. That's pretty DJ that. I don't. I don't know. What, what. What number do you guys have out of 10 for.
00:34:36.538 - 00:34:39.256, Speaker C: For how DJ and hamster racing is.
00:34:39.333 - 00:34:41.197, Speaker D: Like, oh, is five like.
00:34:41.275 - 00:34:47.153, Speaker C: I think 10 is like. What was the other one? There's like cockroaches or something?
00:34:47.329 - 00:34:50.045, Speaker B: Yeah, they're doing every animal now.
00:34:51.585 - 00:35:05.609, Speaker D: I guess hamsters are. It's kind of. It's kind of wholesome. I guess you can kind of. Maybe it's like some type of animal abuse. But like, if you think about it like, purely from like a DJAM perspective, like if the dev's making money, then and it's creating economic value.
00:35:05.657 - 00:35:05.841, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:05.873 - 00:35:10.473, Speaker D: Like Justin's willing to pay money to steal dopamine, then I guess we're talking.
00:35:10.489 - 00:35:16.753, Speaker C: About hamster racing and it sounds pretty decent to me. I wouldn't Cockroach level, but I don't know. Give it a number.
00:35:16.889 - 00:35:19.305, Speaker D: I'll give it. I'll give it a five. I'll start with five.
00:35:19.425 - 00:35:20.113, Speaker C: That's low.
00:35:20.209 - 00:35:25.069, Speaker B: That's pretty low. I would have given UST an 8. Right. D gen than UST.
00:35:25.144 - 00:35:28.365, Speaker D: Well, if you start with an 8, then.
00:35:28.985 - 00:35:34.165, Speaker C: For future topics, tell us what's been your degen activity. Taiki.
00:35:34.825 - 00:36:16.305, Speaker D: Okay, I don't know how degen this is, but are you guys aware of virtual AMM, like VAMMs on chain? Yeah. So there's a bunch of these NFT per dexes that is clearly not sustainable. And there's this degen play that I've been doing where I don't really expect NFTs to pump a lot. So you can basically short board apes on low leverage and collect funding directly from the team treasury. So it's kind of like this RFV play and I've just been doing this for over a month and I made three eth. Like, you know, like just pretty low risk. There's like the risk of the vm, the VA and then blowing up.
00:36:16.305 - 00:36:25.609, Speaker D: But I'm like, okay, like if it blows up, then I think the team will compensate me. So I'm literally just trying to arb, like the eth, like insurance fund by string one.
00:36:25.777 - 00:36:30.465, Speaker B: That's not. It's just like standard defi behavior, I guess.
00:36:30.585 - 00:36:41.965, Speaker D: Yeah, okay. Sorry about that. I need to be more degen. What's the team building Protocol there's. Right now the only one that exists is tribe three.
00:36:42.385 - 00:36:46.209, Speaker C: You're shorting the floor of board eight yacht club.
00:36:46.377 - 00:37:01.091, Speaker D: Yes. And everyone's short. But in order for the price on the VMM to I guess match the Oracle price, the system has to incentivize new shorts. And the only way to do that is by paying eth from their treasury.
00:37:01.273 - 00:37:04.311, Speaker C: So like everyone's kind of like a funding rate basically.
00:37:04.503 - 00:37:10.943, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah. So as long as board apes don't pump in price, I can actually share my screen.
00:37:10.999 - 00:37:13.955, Speaker B: Actually, I pulled it up here too.
00:37:15.615 - 00:37:17.195, Speaker C: All right, interesting.
00:37:17.735 - 00:37:23.631, Speaker B: 99% short. Okay, it's. Maybe it's not a one. This is higher. I misjudged. That's crazy.
00:37:23.823 - 00:37:37.373, Speaker D: Yeah. Like, everyone's doing this and then all it takes is one like degen to like say it. Like, I'm gonna liquidate Taiki and like just like ape like 108th worth of like buy pressure for this and then everyone blows up.
00:37:37.429 - 00:37:53.385, Speaker C: But I mean, I hope Machi Big brother is not watching this because. Definitely possible. Okay. I mean, I would give this a. A solid seven. Although I have, I have the hamsters as higher, I have to say, and I don't know.
00:37:55.185 - 00:38:00.505, Speaker A: Hamsters are higher in retrospect because the devs rugged the project. So he's like, oh, yeah, it was obviously a scam.
00:38:00.665 - 00:38:01.001, Speaker C: Yes.
00:38:01.033 - 00:38:02.085, Speaker D: Did they ride it?
00:38:02.985 - 00:38:09.537, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, they sold. They started selling the team tokens, like secretly. They tried to.
00:38:09.641 - 00:38:31.275, Speaker B: Oh, that's right. I thought you meant like they were. Because. So the races, we found out in the first line of the white paper, which no one reads, they actually admit, like credit to them for being honest. They admit that the races are all pre recorded and so like they know the outcome. Right. Like, presumably, like they could just be betting the winner every time in like some small amount and capturing value that way as well.
00:38:31.275 - 00:38:38.715, Speaker B: I thought that's what you meant by ranking. I didn't. You know, I think it's a little less bad that they're just dumping their token. That's to be expected, right?
00:38:39.455 - 00:38:40.935, Speaker A: That's to be expected. Fair enough.
00:38:40.975 - 00:38:48.205, Speaker C: They're not dumping it. They are. They're doing a OTC transaction at the fair market value with DWF labs. That's what they're doing.
00:38:48.325 - 00:38:48.981, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:49.133 - 00:38:54.025, Speaker C: Very legitimate. Have you been doing any djen activity, thicky?
00:38:59.365 - 00:39:42.485, Speaker A: I think you see sort of signs of froth when market can't go down so that you can start playing these fun little minigames that don't get really punished for being overextended in and one of the examples is you've seen this return of this market manipulator sort of targeting these dead coins that have a really hard to borrow sort of lower market cap. So earlier this week there was a gold and then there's STMX and then there's knc. Essentially there's like these dead coins that have maybe like $70 million market cap. They like buy it really slowly. They start accumulating spot so that the perp starts lagging behind spot. So people that are short, I have to pay funding because the funding is negative, because spot's been leading. And in the first few days people are like, ah, some guy's an idiot just buying.
00:39:42.485 - 00:40:00.051, Speaker A: So they're going to short the token and then towards the end they ramp up and they just buy a ton and ton of spot until like all this oi builds up and finally they manipulate the price high enough to where like all the shorts get liquidated and then they like start selling all their spot again. So we saw it with a gold where it went up maybe like a hundred percent or so.
00:40:00.123 - 00:40:02.939, Speaker B: You mean adventure gold, the loot Derivative project?
00:40:03.067 - 00:40:03.587, Speaker C: Yes.
00:40:03.691 - 00:40:07.535, Speaker B: Holy crap, that's a throwback. That is a useless coin. Wow.
00:40:09.715 - 00:40:23.973, Speaker A: I was short of venture gold and like I took a. Took a small loss in that one, but then I saw like the meta happening and rotated to a different coin. So I was able to catch the long side of those ones. But yeah, it was kind of just fun, just playing the market manipulation game there.
00:40:24.069 - 00:40:31.465, Speaker B: Where do you watch for that? Where can someone like a normie like me find that information? You just got to know the markets.
00:40:31.885 - 00:40:39.695, Speaker A: If you look for the biggest movers every day, typically like the ones that move like 40, 50% of the day are like kind of scammy coins.
00:40:39.815 - 00:41:05.625, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a dangerous game, right? Like this kind of secure bear market stuff where people try to find what coin is safe enough to start playing these games. Because if you choose one where there's a treasury that's actually ready and willing to sell, then during the accumulation phase, you just get dumped on by the big token holders. You got to find these ones that no one's really going to get in the way and just, you know, let you play your listing games.
00:41:05.785 - 00:41:30.165, Speaker B: Well, thank you. You gotta let us know DM us when the the next thing is coming up so we can participate too and have some fun. But with that, I think we should close it there. I had a blast. It was a pleasure doing this with all you guys.
