00:00:20.520 - 00:00:54.422, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody, to episode six of steady lads. So this is a very exciting special episode. It's our first guest episode that we've done, and we have one of my very, very most favorite people in all of crypto crypto cred is here with us. And cred, you've done a ton of content and, you know, discord, Twitter, podcasts, all kinds of stuff. And I know you've doxed pictures before, but this is the first time people are gonna see, like, your. Your face moving around. And I know thikki also was recently kind of deciding to, you know, put a face to the name.
00:00:54.422 - 00:00:56.868, Speaker A: How are you feeling? How's it been to be unmasked?
00:00:56.966 - 00:01:12.096, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's fine. It's honestly not a big deal. You can go to Dagestan and find, like, 50 versions of me, except all of them can fight, and I can't. So I don't think there's anything terribly special there. So, yeah, no, it's cool and happy to be the first guest, hopefully not the last.
00:01:12.280 - 00:01:34.994, Speaker A: I mean, after seeing you in person many times, I think I would beg to differ on the MMA. You do seem to be pretty buff, and we can get into the shred with cred later, but, you know, I would say you're sandbagging there. I'm pretty sure you can. You can definitely take all of us nerds down. I don't know about, like, you know, Justin, are you like, a secret Zuckerberg? Are you kind of doing some BJJ?
00:01:35.114 - 00:01:39.322, Speaker C: Yeah, you can find some pictures on my Twitter. I'll send you something after.
00:01:39.458 - 00:01:40.018, Speaker B: He was.
00:01:40.106 - 00:01:41.258, Speaker D: He looked pretty jacked.
00:01:41.346 - 00:01:52.006, Speaker A: Okay. He does have the Zuckerberg thing going. Okay, cool. And think you like. I don't know. How do you feel? Kind of just being on the topic of, you know, doxing. Not doxxing.
00:01:52.006 - 00:02:02.270, Speaker A: You know, your name is not doxxed. It's not. It's not a Zach XBT situation, but are you worried of people coming up to you in the street once steady lads becomes the number one podcast in the world?
00:02:02.342 - 00:02:15.446, Speaker D: You know, I was actually. I'm at the Stanford blockchain conference right now, and I actually had a couple people come up and ask about steady lads. So I think, like, I think about the last name. It's like a nice level of recognizability.
00:02:15.590 - 00:02:24.358, Speaker B: I mean, if I were as handsome as sticky, I'd be doc stuff, like, all the time. Onlyfans, Patreon, all those websites. I mean, it seems like a wasted opportunity not to.
00:02:24.446 - 00:02:30.054, Speaker E: Yeah, thikki, like, why is your. Why is your Twitter profile photo, like, so blurry? Is that. Is it, like, an origin story there?
00:02:30.134 - 00:02:39.582, Speaker D: So it was originally just my face, but then my mom said that, like, she, like, read some articles about people getting, like, murdered, so she was like, please, like, you know, hide your face. Like, I decided to blur it out.
00:02:39.758 - 00:02:40.310, Speaker B: I see.
00:02:40.382 - 00:02:41.566, Speaker A: Here we are today.
00:02:41.710 - 00:02:42.954, Speaker B: There you are. Yeah.
00:02:44.724 - 00:02:46.184, Speaker E: Sorry. Sorry, mom.
00:02:46.764 - 00:02:56.172, Speaker D: Sorry, mom. The thinking is that, like, you know, potential murderer might not go as far as watching our podcasts. You know, they just look at the Twitter profile and like, ah, I don't know. This guy will pass. I'm killing him.
00:02:56.228 - 00:03:18.394, Speaker A: But we have had. I've been noticing in the comments, you know, I've been reading the comments just to get some feedback since it's, you know, it's a new, new show and new content, and there seem to be some. Some thicky fanboys out there. You know, there's a lot of handsome commenting. And have you started using the images on Friendtech? Have you started using that to kind of pump up?
00:03:18.554 - 00:03:21.014, Speaker D: You have to buy a key and find out, Jordy.
00:03:22.794 - 00:03:30.282, Speaker A: I'm going to have to buy one. Craig, have you been using it lately? I know you were one of the first to sign up just to check it out. And what's the story there?
00:03:30.458 - 00:03:56.794, Speaker B: Yeah, there's no story, really. I signed up and I immediately posted that I'm not going to use it for anything, and you shouldn't expect anything, and tried to go through all the points of Howie to. To make sure people know that it's just something for fun. And I really think it's cool. It's nice. I think being cynical is maybe not worth it because we always complain about how crypto never builds anything, and then when someone tries shitting on, it, immediately seems a bit bad faith. I think experimenting and playing around with it is fine.
00:03:56.794 - 00:04:25.824, Speaker B: My broader problem is that a lot of influencers started immediately promising the world to their keyholders. And I'm not sure how sort of reliable those promises are or how consistent they'll be. And I think also the general trend of social media competitors is towards zero, like initial hype, and then it dies off. So then that creates a pretty dodgy scenario where you've promised the world to people, they firmware it into your keys, and then the odds of you actually sticking to your promises are quite low. And then, yeah, people are left holding the bag. So I'm not so sure. I mean, it's fun, it's cool.
00:04:25.824 - 00:04:42.040, Speaker B: It's a good avenue for shitposting and more casual stuff. But yeah, I'm not for the promises and redistributing points and tokens and all my alpha goes here, so. You never had any alpha in the first place, mate. Like if you did, you would have posted it on Twitter. So not convinced on that front.
00:04:42.192 - 00:05:24.996, Speaker C: One funny experience I had, I'm not sure if this person works at Friendtech or is affiliated with them, but I got a DM on Twitter saying, hey, we were watching your steady lads episode. We're trying to think of ways that we can stop that botting problem where the second you sign up your shares, if you're notable, get bought it and bought up to a crazy price and then anyone who buys after gets dumped on. I think Jordy brought that up on our last pod and they asked me if I had any cool mechanisms designs that could get around that. And I spent a lot of time thinking this morning in bed pretty early when I woke up, if there was anything I could think of, and there wasn't, I was thinking of if you could do a declining auction, if you could like have a rising auction and there's really nothing I could think of that would work there. But maybe you guys have some ideas.
00:05:25.140 - 00:06:00.944, Speaker A: I mean, the simplest thing is just on the, on the UI, just say instead of buying one key, like what's the minimum price you want to start your keys selling at so that nobody can like buy very cheap and like dump it later for a profit. So you could just say my minimum price is, you know, 0.1 ETH. That's where it should start. Don't let the bots buy below that. We saw what Cl did, so cl kind of, you know, he front ran all the bots. There's a way you can, you can, you can pre buy using Mev and he just made them by the top, basically, which was epic and very cl like.
00:06:00.944 - 00:06:03.604, Speaker A: So that's a clever cat right there.
00:06:03.724 - 00:06:26.226, Speaker D: So I think he created his account, but he didn't actually mint his first share. So I think the way it is, before the creator mints the first year, nobody can actually buy it. So he basically just created the account and he let me be bots just like fire randomly because they basically have to guess when he's created his first share and they burn $10,000 worth of gas, couple days until they all gave up. And then like as soon as they all gave up, he just minted all the shares.
00:06:26.370 - 00:06:48.240, Speaker A: I saw he was, he was, he was making a comment about how he was kind of getting, getting it close to close to the edge, but not, not quite. Not quite signing up and the bots went crazy. I think it's really good for l two metrics. Just seeing like, oh, look, there's millions. I think was like 50% of the transactions on all base chain were basically bots trying to get cat shares. So that was. That was is epic.
00:06:48.240 - 00:07:02.484, Speaker A: And never a quiet week in crypto, even if prices are quiet or a lot of entertainment. Outside of that, I mean, how are you feeling? Generally cred with the market. We've had an eventual news cycle, but not that much in the price side.
00:07:03.144 - 00:07:39.504, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. The market was impervious to volume for so long because the news cycle was still going and this was close to 30k. We had good and bad news and it just didn't really seem to push the tide either way. And that was really disappointing because you'd hope that news would take you out of a really low volume regime, and it didn't, which was concerning. And I mean, at the moment, yeah, we had the dump I didn't think was super news based, like a single catalyst. I think it was just a shift in vols, really. But this most recent move is definitely news based, and I think the next move is most likely going to be news based as well whenever we get Friday ETF, whatever that looks like.
00:07:39.504 - 00:08:06.764, Speaker B: But yeah, it's a bit of a miserable regime because if you're trading majors, you can just about only trade news, and that's it. There's really no other game in town for BTC, for ETH. Like the top 30 50 altcoins might as well get delisted at this point because they just don't do anything from a trading point of view. There's really nothing to be done. In the past, if we were too poor to trade BTC and ETH, at least we could go down to the top ten, top 20, and pump there. Now, even that's unavailable. That's beyond our reach.
00:08:06.764 - 00:08:45.210, Speaker B: So we've gone on chain or binance, micro caps, the smallest cap or most illiquid thing there. And that's where whatever centralized exchange trading is going on is taking place. So that's not great. I mean, I had a few bullet points that I made as far as sort of meta stuff goes, and to me at least, it's kind of shorting alts because as Sticky said in the previous episode, it's like a ton of supply hitting the market and no one really wants to absorb it. So that's sort of just a cyclical feature of where we are. There's cartel pump and dump shitcoins, which is that comment about the binance max negative funding. Oh my God, there's going to be a squeeze and then there isn't on chain pump and dump.
00:08:45.210 - 00:09:13.266, Speaker B: I mean, maybe I'm being too facetious with pump and dump sort of on chain gems, which I'm sure will be around in a few years, being sort of parroted and traded very aggressively. ETF news catalyst scraping kind of, again, headline related, because nothing else seems strong enough to move the market. And it just seems in general to be like a drive by shooting based meta. Even with alts, it's like, okay, there's a buy the rumor, sell the news. Okay, I'm out and I'm deleting the sync from my watch list. Same for like BTC. Okay, good news, catch the pop and get the hell out.
00:09:13.266 - 00:09:46.798, Speaker B: And you know, there's no kind of longevity in these rotations. Low volume seems quite sticky. Sticky thicky, which is his onlyfans username for those who don't know. But it just seems like outside of those single news events, no one really wants to follow through or participate in either direction. It's just you get the catalyst candle and then that's it, you're fucked. And yeah, outflows and all that other stuff still seems to be the name of the game more broadly. So yeah, I think for the next x number of weeks, at least until we get some sort of ETF clarity, whatever the fuck that means, it's probably just going to be, at least on the major side, news driven.
00:09:46.798 - 00:09:51.846, Speaker B: And then there's a whole on chain bull market going on, apparently, but wrong person to ask for that.
00:09:51.990 - 00:10:33.604, Speaker A: It has been a little bit disappointing that there was no follow through on the ETF kind of grayscale good news. And we were talking about this earlier, possibly one of the reasons is there was like a huge premium on BTC versus the grayscale product. So you have an unwinding of that. And when people are unwinding it, they have to sell bitcoin and buy grayscale because they want to converge the prices. So bitcoin not going above 28 and being able to last is probably because there's a lot of people just dumping bitcoin and buying the cheaper version, because you start to believe that they're more equivalent at this point. Like the odds of them converging and being the same thing right now. They're not.
00:10:33.604 - 00:10:47.392, Speaker A: So it sort of created a substitute that's a cheaper version of bitcoin, and people are buying that instead of the real bitcoin, and that's kind of like stall the price. So maybe that's one of the things going on. I don't know if any of you guys have looked at that.
00:10:47.528 - 00:10:55.084, Speaker C: Is that still a good trade, you think? Or is it too crowded right now to be converting your BTC to GBTC? I'm curious what you guys think.
00:10:55.744 - 00:11:17.444, Speaker D: I think it's a really good trade. The trust have been something that I've been in for a while, both GBTC and ETH. I mean, I personally still think that it went from like a 27% discount to a 20% discount, and I still think it's a good deal. Obviously not financial advice, but yeah, I still hold a lot of trust and I do expect the discount to close.
00:11:17.984 - 00:12:16.574, Speaker E: And, like, one trend that I've noticed is, and this is to add on to like, what credit was saying earlier about just people selling the news and not being comfortable enough to hold into catalyst events, where whenever bitcoin goes up on chain alts, or just altcoins in general go up a few percentage points, and then what pumps the hardest are things listed on things like fidelity or brokerage accounts like Coinbase, marathon, these bitcoin mining stocks. I just feel like there's not that many people left in crypto that are comfortable having money on chain or centralized exchanges. And if people want to play bitcoin beta, they don't chase alts, they just chase things like marathon, which I think is pretty bad for, I guess, the state of crypto right now. And I don't know what brings retail interest back. Friendtech is interesting. There's a bunch of other consumer apps that's launching on base chain, which I think can gain more users and whatnot. But right now it just seems like retail just do not give any shits about just crypto in general.
00:12:17.214 - 00:12:52.346, Speaker A: I mean, retail wants to make money, right? So they kind of follow what will give them a quick, easy cash grab. And then there's a whole other more financial services oriented, which people want more like long term savings. And there's some products maybe designed around that, especially with kind of, some of the stuff we've talked about in the past, like the on chain yields and getting more humble farming going on. But Craig, we have one of the premier crypto trading educators here. So there's a few concepts. I mean, you know, you've been crushing this, like, clean information game.
00:12:52.410 - 00:12:56.562, Speaker B: Oh, the engagement farming. Yeah, absolutely. That's, that's been going very well, but.
00:12:56.578 - 00:12:58.986, Speaker A: Without dumping, you haven't made. You haven't made the dumping millions.
00:12:59.010 - 00:13:00.098, Speaker B: So not yet.
00:13:00.186 - 00:13:11.554, Speaker A: You're waiting. And even friend tech is not big enough for you. You're like, oh, yeah, Kobe's making, you know, 200k. That's, I'm not gonna, like, crush my reputation for this. I need, like, a bigger, bigger, bigger fish to fry.
00:13:11.594 - 00:13:15.480, Speaker B: Yeah, the long con is multi decade jordy, but, you know, when it comes, you'll know.
00:13:15.562 - 00:13:33.144, Speaker A: So we have a few threads that we want to bring up and kind of talk through some of the concepts. You've had a lot of bangers recently. So just in terms of the cycle and the cycle that we've going through. Yeah, this guy looks pretty miserable. What are you seeing on this side?
00:13:33.764 - 00:14:13.628, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, this is just a, I mean, obviously it's a meme, but I think it has some observations that are generally true, and one of them actually comes from Twitter. Since we're on the topic of Twitter is that every kind of strong trend finds its flag bearer. Usually it's one to three people who are just sort of the archetypes of that trend, like peak bear, peak bull. They'll gain all of their followers as part of that trend, and when the trend reverses, they'll be none the wiser. That's not always their fault. It's very easy to get sucked into the social media side of things and have your blinders on, but these heroes or villains always emerge. And on the bearish side, it's very important to kind of be aware that for some of them, they will never buy.
00:14:13.628 - 00:14:46.914, Speaker B: The price is never low enough for them to change their mind. And even if their original targets hit, theyll just dig their heels in and say, well, you know what? Now theres new information even more bearish. So one thing to avoid, and I think I was trying to point towards it with this meme, is that there are a bunch of people who will just move their targets up the higher price goes and move their targets down the lower price goes. And trying to chase, like, the final 510, 15% of a trend or in their estimation of whats left of the trend. And thats just really not worth it. At a certain point, you just have to pull the trigger and take some allocation and actually trade. The market doesnt give you a flashing indicator.
00:14:46.914 - 00:15:30.878, Speaker B: This is the bottom, this is the top, and its time to go all in and all out. If youre in that privileged position where you have some capital set aside for more cyclical long term plays, you need to bloody deploy it at some point. I think it ends up being a mismatch of trader and investor mindsets where that capital exists to allow you to allocate as an investor. But then your trader brain can't turn off, and you want to be really precise with exact level, exact stop, risk defined, and so on and so forth. I think those two concepts have friction, and you should have a sort of clearer distinction between them. Like, if you're an investor, play that properly, the wider time horizons, wider invalidations, and apply that framework consistently, and if you're a trader, do the same. But we all know far too many anecdotes of traders becoming investors.
00:15:30.878 - 00:15:52.278, Speaker B: Not by choice, but I think the other side of that that doesn't get talked about enough is investors becoming traders and therefore missing out on their investments, because that two, three, 5%, which they thought was important in the grand scheme of things within the requisite framework, is actually fairly immaterial. So that was not the thinking that went into that meme. The thinking into that meme was lol banger, let's get some likes. But I might as well dress it up with something.
00:15:52.406 - 00:16:38.436, Speaker A: I mean, liquidations and getting liquidated is sort of a rite of passage of any crypto trader. And the perpetual future is this unique, uniquely crypto, at least for now. We don't see it in tradfi concept and things like funding rates. And these concepts are maybe not that easy to understand, especially for people who are just punting ten x leverage. They think long, short, and they go for it. And sometimes things work out, but often at some point there's going to be some sort of liquidation or it's not going to work out. And I think it's good to use this opportunity to clarify some of the concepts like open interest and like funding rates, that a lot of traders maybe don't really fully grasp, especially with perpetuals.
00:16:38.460 - 00:16:38.596, Speaker D: Right.
00:16:38.620 - 00:17:07.624, Speaker A: It's this unique concept. Maybe, you know, traders like Thiccy, who haven't, you know, lived through traditional futures, and they just go straight to like, perps that they feel. They feel a lot like very like native in it. Like, of course it's a perpetual. Of course there's a funding rate. You know, for dinosaurs like me, I'm used to like, calendar futures, and there's no funding rate. You kind of know in advance what the basis is to the spot when you enter and, you know, until the end, you know, for three months, gold is going to be 2% lower, and that's because of, you know, the storage fee or whatever it's going to be.
00:17:07.624 - 00:17:14.996, Speaker A: Vicki, have you, have you had an easy time with kind of funding rates and understanding how to, how to get manipulated.
00:17:15.180 - 00:17:27.480, Speaker D: How to get manipulated. You know, I thought, I understand, but you know, every time I lose money I question myself, but I'd say I'm like seven out of ten comfortable with it.
00:17:27.552 - 00:17:33.728, Speaker A: Let's bring up the crypto credit funding rates. This was a hugely useful educational thread.
00:17:33.776 - 00:17:36.364, Speaker B: Yeah, chat GPT really knocked this one out the pub.
00:17:38.784 - 00:17:52.884, Speaker A: So I mean, tell us some of the misunderstood things about funding rates. Cred like you engage with a lot of traders of all levels, low to high. What were some kind of the basic things that people really need to understand.
00:17:53.904 - 00:18:31.580, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess first things first is read the thread. I tried to make it as accessible and comprehensive as possible and be useful to a wide range of traders, but if not, I guess the first point, and sorry for the train in the background, if you can hear that the first point is that there isn't always signal in funding rates. I think that there's a tendency amongst traders as soon as they learn a new trick or, or a new indicator or tool, they start hallucinating and they see that indicator everywhere and start looking for setups and signals to deal with that new shiny thing everywhere. And it's just not the case. And I think it's very much the same with funding. Just like if you're a discretionary low or medium frequency trader, you're not sensitive to every price. That just wouldn't make sense.
00:18:31.580 - 00:19:03.630, Speaker B: It's not within your mandate. And I think the same applies to funding. It's not always interesting, actually, most of the time it works fairly well. The funding rate gets up, then the two instruments and the two prices basically stick in line with each other. And that's cool. So you should always, I think you should start by developing a filter as to is this just like a normal funding rate in the market working as intended, or is there something interesting going on? So not always useful would be the first lesson. The second lesson, I guess, would be, I sort of touch on this in the thread, but it's not some sort of long, short or inherently directional indicator.
00:19:03.630 - 00:19:37.790, Speaker B: It gives you a very specific piece of information that here's the index price made up of spot, and here's the perp price, which, which is the instrument that you're trading. And all it does is tell you the relationship between those two and the dislocation in which direction, if any. That's really it. And that's really where your confident guesses can end. And you have to bring in other complementary tools like open interest, and you can look at funding is the obvious one, CVD's. You can actually look at the spot exchanges themselves to see which ones are pushing or maybe being slow. You need to basically use it to build a picture as to whether there's anyone being aggressive on the market.
00:19:37.790 - 00:20:43.194, Speaker B: Is it spot or perks being aggressive and is price rewarding their aggression, or just following along in general? So really it's more of a, I guess, investigative tool to see. Is there a dislocation brewing? Why hasn't it been armed? And just in general, what doesn't add up, and it's when those outlier type of scenarios crop up, is where you'll get interesting trades. But it's not something that you can just flick onto your velo or coin allies and say, are funding red? Therefore, short or long or something of that nature, is just a contextual piece of information that also you should pay attention to more times than others. So, for example, I will never look at just funding if I don't think the market is at or around the relevant level, or if the price action doesn't look interesting, because I'll just assume that gets armed and there's no one really to squeeze or it's noise or whatever. So I guess that's a few of the things I'm happy to go into more detail, but in general, I just want people to build a baseline understanding of how this thing is calculated. And the broad theme that runs through the entire piece is that it only gets interesting when something doesn't add up. And that's what you should look for and filter for and not see it as a sort of omniscient tool that at all times is going to tell you which direction the market's going to go.
00:20:43.854 - 00:21:13.924, Speaker A: So the most interesting thing that I find about funding rates and perps is that we need to look into how it's calculated. And basically it's the difference between spot and futures. And it's trying to make the two convergence. If one's away from the other one, it kind of like incentivizes you to go down. But the key thing to note on that is that the spot has the primary almost. It's like the kingmaker in this. The spot is going to determine the real price, and then everybody who's off of that gets penalized.
00:21:13.924 - 00:22:06.704, Speaker A: So it's not like there's an equal relationship between futures and spot. And one of the strange things is that exchanges, crypto exchanges, especially specifically, generally make it a lot cheaper to trade derivatives, especially if you're doing a lot of volume. Spot might be like, 510 bits and futures might be two, three bps, for example, if you're trading those. And a lot of the volume because of the margin and the cheaper fees actually ends up going to derivatives. And you get in this weird dynamic, which Grachev from DWF, we've talked about him many times in the past, and we're just using his own words here, but he talks about how people assume that spot market cap needs to be bigger than derivatives. But actually, you get these crazy situations where the open interest on derivatives is huge. And the spot market, especially right now, liquidity, is not that big.
00:22:06.704 - 00:22:37.806, Speaker A: And what you end up having is if you can be the one who controls the spot price, you can just make the funding rate fluctuate in your direction. Um, that's something that we've seen the cartel do. I don't know. We don't want to, like, speculate who's in the cartel and who's not in the cartel. But, um, I don't know. Like, for you guys, like Justin and Taiki, have you been kind of seeing these kind of funding rates? You just stay out of it. Are you scared of them? Like, is it just a conspiracy? What do you think?
00:22:37.950 - 00:23:08.406, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, for me, like, I don't really like leverage trade. The only, like, sometimes I do, like, on chain funding arbitrage, where I was, like, shorting bored apes on leverage on, like, these NfT per platforms. And the oracle price was always above the spot price, so the platform was paying ETH from their treasury to incentivize new shorts to come in. So I was literally like farming board apes and being paid, like, ETH from the treasury. And both I was doing this on two platforms and both of them shut down because the system wasn't sustainable.
00:23:08.470 - 00:23:08.670, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:08.702 - 00:23:26.818, Speaker E: It's like the virtual AMM design. And I think both tribe three and NMC perp is going to, like, launched their v two. I don't really trade on centralized exchanges, so I don't really get to see Vicki and jordy and giving cred in the trenches fighting with Grachev and DWF labs.
00:23:26.906 - 00:23:28.374, Speaker A: You need to get in the arena.
00:23:29.474 - 00:23:33.690, Speaker E: Yeah, I have to get in the arena. I have to follow the chamath. This is his mandate.
00:23:33.842 - 00:23:36.898, Speaker A: Yeah. How about you, Justin? Do you kind of get involved in this level?
00:23:37.066 - 00:24:09.084, Speaker C: So I think if there's one skill I have in the crypto space, it's really knowing my place. And to Cred's point, you need to know if you're an investor accidentally drifting into the trader bucket or vice versa. That really spoke to me personally. I'm really just an investor. I try to stay away from the trading side of things. I've obviously dabbled a bit, but I think, you know, like, after learning from you guys over the past few episodes and whatnot and talking to more folks, like, I really do feel like you kind of need a mentor if you want to get into that. I mean, there's just so many minds to step on.
00:24:09.084 - 00:24:34.716, Speaker C: Right. This market is heavily manipulated. There's so many complexities and nuances that, frankly, I'm just not aware of. I don't know what. I don't know. And so, like, I've tried very much to just not drift into the trader bucket and to Cred's point, like, this is the time over the past year or so, in my view, to be deploying capital and playing the long game, and that's what I try to do as best as possible. I have a ton of questions on that cred, and I'm sure we'll get to that later.
00:24:34.716 - 00:24:38.372, Speaker C: But, yeah, I try to stay out of it, but if you guys want to mentor me, I'm here.
00:24:38.468 - 00:25:12.784, Speaker A: Well, think he's one of the, you know, scimitar capital pros over here. Even though he's the busboy, he's been learning a lot from his boss. Well, so when you're looking at funding rates and trading them, the one thing that we've seen a lot of recently is these insane kind of negative funding rate squeezes where it's very spot manipulated up, and then you don't know exactly when it's going to flush in and out. I know you've been trading these, and one of the things I want to get to is how it's very different being on the short versus long side. What's your strategy going?
00:25:13.284 - 00:26:05.574, Speaker D: I definitely think that, like, these extreme, funny running rate scenarios definitely test your understanding of how the mechanisms work and what they indicate really well, because it just gives you these really funky, like, for example, sometimes things will hit max funding, and sometimes things will be, like, five to 10% dislocated from spot perp, and then they exchange just some wacky stuff for. They go like, oh, yeah, we want this to converge really quickly, so we're gonna make the funding rate every 4 hours instead of every eight or maybe every 2 hours instead of four, so on and so forth. One of the most recent ones was actually yesterday, this new listing called cyber. And, yeah, somebody just started ripping a really fat spot bid into it. It ran up from around 3.75 to like almost seven. And at that point I was like, all right, you know, this is kind of crazy.
00:26:05.574 - 00:26:38.972, Speaker D: I decided to short it, and I was like, funding is like pretty in line. It's like negative one or two bps. I should be pretty safe. I think negative funding being so small indicated that the market makers had plenty of inventory. And I was like, I wouldn't get penalized essentially for shorting too much of it because I have to pay very little. But yeah, yesterday, funding started blowing out to Max, and I slowly realized that whoever was buying the spot had begun to corner the market and had bought up literally all of the market maker supply. After that, I was just like, I.
00:26:38.988 - 00:26:39.532, Speaker B: Got to get out.
00:26:39.588 - 00:26:41.264, Speaker D: This could go to infinity at this point.
00:26:41.804 - 00:27:20.934, Speaker A: That's the thing, Craig. We've talked about this before, but one of the key things that I love the audience to understand is that you don't have a birthright to short. You have a birthright to long. If you want to long something, you can always fall back on the spot, long the perp. And if the funding goes very crazy positive, you can just say, okay, I'm exiting probably at a profit, because at that point it must be above the spot price, and I'm just going to put it into spot. I'm great. However, you don't have a birthright to short unless you actually have physical coins that you can borrow and sell, like traditional stock short selling, where you borrow someone's Microsoft stock and then you can sell it and then eventually buy it back for them.
00:27:20.934 - 00:27:34.456, Speaker A: You don't really have the ability to control, especially in a perp funding rate, control the outcome if you don't have spot to sell. What have you been seeing on that side? And how do you navigate traders that want to short perps?
00:27:34.640 - 00:28:08.792, Speaker B: I think a lot of the misunderstanding comes from the fact that when people hear negative funding for them, that's just short squeeze in another term, or like a synonym for that. It's not necessarily true. It's actually very rarely true. For example, you can have negative funding after just a big move down in a liquidation cascade. And because the perks have more leverage than spot, they get dislocated more than spot. And so as a result of that selling, naturally you'll have negative funding after a big sort of fuck off blow up move. And the inference that people make is that, oh, look, a lot of people are shorting the bottom now because funding is negative.
00:28:08.792 - 00:28:56.166, Speaker B: That's not true at all. The only reason funding is negative after that move down is because that leverage flush dislocates the perp even more relative to the index. And you can also get that same misunderstanding based on price going up, for example. So from 55k all the way down to zero wherever BTC bottomed a lot of the time, the argument was made that there was a spot premium in the market. And essentially you can get negative funding from spot pushing harder than perks. So its the same effect, right? If this is the index and you have the perps trading significantly below the spot price, yes, that could be because the perps are being aggressive, but it could also be because spot is being very aggressive to the upside. So it's really important to understand how you get to negative funding as opposed to just seeing negative funding and just assuming a squeeze is going to come.
00:28:56.166 - 00:29:37.700, Speaker B: In the first example, it doesn't make sense to argue for a squeeze because it only got there because the market got squeezed. And in the second example, it's not even short to be aggressive in the first place. The fact that someone's ramming spot, so inherently, the argument of short squeeze in those two scenarios becomes very difficult to justify. As for the kind of cyclical cornering the market mechanism that you discussed, we also talked about this, Jordy, from my notes on this, and my best understanding is that when people pile into that trade, if I'm someone who hasn't thought about this too much or maybe is confused, I'm not bagging on those people. This is complicated stuff and these are really tricky trades. For example, I see negative funding and price going up. What I'll do is I'll long the perp.
00:29:37.700 - 00:30:07.622, Speaker B: I long the perp thinking, look, there's so many shorts in this market that they're going to get blown up and there's going to be a Jesus candle that retires me. Right? So what you're implicitly arguing at that point is basically some sort of convergence trade, that there's a significant difference between the spot and the perp. And ultimately they will come in line. And when they do, because the spot is so much above the perp, I'm going to make up on that difference and that's going to be me making money. So, you know, spot up here, perp down here. And when I long the perp, eventually in order for the funding to normalize, it's going to catch up. And that's my p and L.
00:30:07.622 - 00:30:46.624, Speaker B: Of course, as we just discussed, we can get cases where funding is skewed by the perks being aggressive or by spot being aggressive. So what happens in a lot of these kind of cyclical shitcoin rotations is that participants will pile into the short squeeze trade by longing the perp. But the way that the trade ultimately converges is that spot just gets mega fucking dumped on your head. And that's how you sort of get the normalization in the financing rate and the premium, et cetera. So essentially this kind of negative funding, if your initial assumption is that it's all the shorts are so screwed. I think a lot of the time in this current scenario, it's actually baked for longs. You push up spot, you make funding really negative.
00:30:46.624 - 00:31:09.156, Speaker B: Traders will just want to hop on that and hope that the convergence is from the perk catching up to spot. It's more liquid, it's easy to trade, you get paid the longer. This is great. What could possibly go wrong? And then you're the exit liquidity essentially, for that trade. It is very tricky. This is quite rare. We don't, you know, normally when you look at funding rates and perps, et cetera, it's more or less trades in line.
00:31:09.156 - 00:31:23.916, Speaker B: And even when you get interesting funding related trades, it's not like this extreme with Max, that funding. I think this is a very sort of niche specific feature of the current market structure and it's quite devilish in the details. But hopefully that was somewhat clear as to how it works.
00:31:24.100 - 00:32:00.278, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, let's go even a little bit deeper because I think this is such a key thing. What we're seeing in the markets is a blatant versions of this. What you said that I really want to double click on is ultimately the spot selling is what brings an end to the game. You know, all these shenanigans, short squeeze and funding and all this stuff. When somebody dumps the spot, the game's over, it's done. We saw that with YGG, which we talked about on a previous episode. And, you know, without getting into like, you know, speculation, who's in the cartel and is it, you know, DWF or other, other people? I will say that the power of having a lot of spot, even if it's not a great investment.
00:32:00.278 - 00:32:48.974, Speaker A: So we've seen like DWL, for example, if you go to the website, they've bought all these coins that have questionable fundamentals and they keep announcing, we've bought 5 million of this and 5 million of that. And they've spent months and months buying all sorts of coins. And the common thing that they really need for these coins is just they need them to be listed and ideally have perps or maybe binance will list the perks in the future, because all they're doing is accumulating ammunition. They get all these spot coins, and they just, like, sit them around, and then they can kind of rotate through and decide, you know, this is a good time that we want to sell our spot and bring an end to the game, or this is the time that we want to hold the spot and, you know, they move it on chain, off chain. There's a lot of games going on. I don't know, Thiki, if you have any speculation as to what they're doing when they're telling us that they're moving cyber off chain, and then he, here it is. We have it.
00:32:48.974 - 00:32:57.022, Speaker A: Are they trying to take it off the exchange so that there's not that many coins on the exchange for margin to be done or what do you speculate is happening?
00:32:57.118 - 00:33:14.030, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that could be a possibility. I think some of it's like, they don't want to scare people if they send it to an exchange and they don't actually want people to crash the price. Like, yeah, we're just saying to exchange, we're actually dumping it. A lot of it's like, oh, we're going to move it to a korean exchange because we're going to go dump it there. And it just newly listed, like with Bithome yesterday.
00:33:14.222 - 00:33:35.878, Speaker A: And do you look at stuff Craig mentioned? So he mentioned open interest. That's one indicator that can tell you not really is it bullish or bearish, but more, how many people are in the arena? How many people are actively having financial bets on long or short? Have they closed them or are they opening more? Is that something that you look at?
00:33:35.966 - 00:34:11.912, Speaker D: Yeah, I think this is really important for shorting at all times. You're kind of estimating how much money has been piled into this trade and how much more money is there left to pile in. So a lot of the times when people like, you know, let's say off a socket tweet, people pile in and maybe you estimate, you know, I think maybe $30 million, like, of speculation and this symbol might be around fair. And you just, like, you usually, like, tune and adjust, like, those numbers based on, like, previous events. But, like, once it hits a certain point, you're just like, okay, there's just no more money left in the ecosystem. I think this is a good spot where I can enter in. Yeah, definitely look at open interest a lot when trying to gauge that.
00:34:12.048 - 00:34:14.128, Speaker A: Craig, what's your thoughts on open interest?
00:34:14.296 - 00:34:56.486, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'd once again direct the listeners to read the thread, because that has the introductory stuff, if you don't know, generally speaking. I mean, for open interest, I like to look at two things. I mean, it says six in that list, but they're sort of minor variations. So it mostly comes down to large open interest increases and decreases. So with the increases, I want to see evidence of aggressive participation, and ideally to have other factors and other indicators supporting that speculation being more one sided than not, because as we know, perks are peer to peer, right? So one long, one short, one long, one long, one short. You can't just look at open interest and come to an inference as to, oh, these are all longs piling in. Well, no, there's an equal number of shorts.
00:34:56.486 - 00:35:43.702, Speaker B: The question is, what is the market clearing price technically for those longs versus those shorts? And just looking at open interest won't tell you that. And there's a ton of other nuances, like, for example, liquidations will reduce open interest, but so will closing trades. And so when the market sort of gets to big breakout levels, sometimes you'll see some anomalies in open interest. Okay, why does this candle or whatever measure of open interest looks so weird? Because there's a mix of stuff going on with fresh participation on the breakout liquidations, on that same breakout positions closing on that breakout. It's an absolute sort of quagmire for me, honestly, in the simplest possible terms, I will go on like a velo or a coin lies, and I will look at generally the biggest increases and biggest decreases in open interest. And that will sort of set my filter as to where I'm looking. As for biggest increases, I want to get an understanding of why is there so much speculation in this thing.
00:35:43.702 - 00:36:32.552, Speaker B: Sometimes it can be sort of front running of a news event which might be disclosed or not. Other times it's just sort of aping in on tweets or through breakout levels or breakdown levels, stuff like that. So if there's a reasonably price sensitive area where I see those increases in open interest, that definitely gets my attention. As far as open interest decreases, it's sort of a similar logic. I'm like, why have so many people been carried out of this trade? Why have so many speculators died? Is it, for example, a large ramp up in open interest, and then a lot of those positions start closing? If not, and for example, the price impact hasn't been great, I might think, okay, there might be more in minding to be done other times. We all know that sort of liquidations are generally mean, reverting more often than not. So if I see a large decrease in open interest and like a flush or a spike into a level that I think is relevant, I sort of can make a pretty quick back of the napkin base case that a lot of participants just puked.
00:36:32.552 - 00:37:06.206, Speaker B: A lot of the speculators are gone. But I think in terms of fair value, it might be either ideally somewhere below fair value or priced reasonably for a trade. There's really that kind of stuff, sort of seeing who's being aggressive and who's speculating hard. Are they being rewarded for it or doing it at sort of logical versus ridiculous levels? And if the open interest is new king, I'm seeing who's been liquidated. Is it a good spot to mean revert from there, or is it someone just closing their trades ahead of maybe a larger rotation? I'm sure I missed like a million examples. There are other nuances, like, for example, large increases in open interest, but price not moving. I think maybe those are like the last participants who are going to be getting milked for whatever the funding rate is.
00:37:06.206 - 00:37:41.978, Speaker B: And if they have a certain expectation of price or volatility or whatever, and the market doesn't reward them, they'll end up puking eventually. Vicki and I talked about that when it came to the 30k ETF stuff. You're sat in the trade and the market's not moving that additional open interest, which isn't being rewarded by the price they're going to cut eventually, certainly if they're on the wrong side of funding. So a ton of nuances go into it. But really it's the, as always, as I said in the beginning, it's the outlier stuff, and I'm quite interested in. So the big increases, big decreases. And if it happens to line up with a level where I think you can reasonably expect to see increased participation, like your standard ta breakout breakdown level stuff, then you're cooking with gas.
00:37:42.146 - 00:38:02.702, Speaker A: That's super helpful. There's a lot of nuance, and we will put the threads in the show notes so people can go them a bit more carefully. There's another concept of liquidity that already talks about long liquidity. Is there a lot of liquidity? There's not a lot of liquidity. It's another one that gets me used a lot. But we'll leave that for part two. In six months, we'll try to bring you back on.
00:38:02.702 - 00:38:13.454, Speaker A: I want to give Justin and Taiki a chance to talk to you and ask you some questions. And you do so many things, including your discord as well. I want to try to tap into some of these other topics as well. Yeah.
00:38:13.494 - 00:38:16.918, Speaker C: Cool. I have a few prepared I want to just throw at you rapid fire.
00:38:16.966 - 00:38:20.194, Speaker B: Before not sending them to me in advance, but yes, go ahead, please.
00:38:21.334 - 00:38:53.542, Speaker C: Well, they're all based on your Twitter, right? So it should be good. You posted this tweet, which was like a punch in the gut to me. I was stoked when we had the grayscale victory minor pump. And then I think Blackrock's first ETF deadline is tomorrow, actually, so should be exciting times. Probably will come out just as this show is getting released. I'm curious, like, what your thoughts are just in general on this. And then also curious, are you more of a trader or investor? I mean, it sounds like you have some expertise on the trading side, but I'm curious, like how you think about that.
00:38:53.542 - 00:38:59.950, Speaker C: Are you actually trading this grayscale ETF news, or are you just trying to find the right time to accumulate for the longer term?
00:39:00.022 - 00:39:44.050, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. As far as this particular tweet, the reason it came up is because I remembered how what XRP looked like when they had that big grayscale victory and then the market was in a state where it just didn't really go anywhere. And that would also be in line with the general price action recently, where you have big moves that look like they should continue if the market is anything other than a piece of shit, and instead they just bleed out to the origin. So that's not great. I also think a lot of people are potentially in a position where they sort of create a false equivalence between grayscale losing and ETF getting approved, like on Friday. I don't think one follows from the other. To me, it's completely plausible, and maybe even more reasonable than not, that grayscale loses the case and then just kicks the ETF can down the road on Friday or whatever Friday that happens on.
00:39:44.050 - 00:40:18.700, Speaker B: To me, that makes way more sense than, okay, we lost to grayscale, so it's going to mass approve everything. And they're also, bear in mind, contextually, they're stuck in a quagmire of litigation with like, uniswap, Coinbase, XRP, you know, they just lost, got their asses kicked by grayscale. And there's probably, you know, binance, the sealed whatever the bloody hell indictment thing. So it'd be very strange if in with that sort of pretext of like, ah, yeah, fuck it, send it. Send the ETF. Let's go. There's clearly not a lot of appetite for that on the same grounds, I think denying it in the same week that they lose a case which found that their reasons for denial were not good enough and were arbitrary and capricious.
00:40:18.700 - 00:40:36.744, Speaker B: That would be super ballsy, but also pretty unlikely. So I think the easiest sort of risk free option for them is to kick the can down the road when it comes to the ETF. And that's kind of my base case. But I think the odds of it in the long term have gone up sort of medium to long term. But in the short term, I can see a delay is more likely than not.
00:40:37.364 - 00:40:54.656, Speaker C: Have you seen that pseudo conspiracy theory that they always wanted to approve Blackrock first, and the timing is now lined up perfectly for them to approve Blackrock on Friday and maybe like approve everyone shortly after. Approve Everett at once and make sure that Blackrock is in that first tranche of approvals.
00:40:54.840 - 00:41:42.704, Speaker B: Have you seen that? Have you seen that? I don't know if I fully subscribe to it. I do agree that sort of mechanistically, if you approve one, you have to approve all of them. And Blackrock, probably just because it's Blackrock, has the highest odds. But in terms of how deliberate or engineered that is, I don't think they have the degree of competence to coordinate something like that. As to the second question, as far as trader investor, honestly, to be completely transparent, recently, in the last maybe like three, four months, I've been very lazy on the trader front, which isn't a good thing. I could certainly cope and make arguments that, look, we're at a point cyclically where you should skew towards investment because the time horizons are changing and the bear trend is probably in its last quarter or something of that nature, and make investment minded arguments without be dishonest. It has mostly been up focusing on other stuff as well as laziness.
00:41:42.704 - 00:42:16.558, Speaker B: I do think if you're a trader, you have an obligation to trade your edge when it comes up. You just have to fucking do that. Because you never know when it's going to run out, you never know when it's going to super print. You never know when you're going to discover new things by trading what you feel like is your old and regular edge, and instead stumble upon new edges in the process. So even if you're not feeling it or you think the regime is more favorable towards other forms of investment, if you're a real trader and you have setups, I think you're under some kind of metaphysical moral duty to trade them. And I haven't been doing that, which isn't great. So I guess the coke answer is yes, something macro unprecedented.
00:42:16.558 - 00:42:25.078, Speaker B: I'm just looking to allocate spot and do that and then trade more later. The real answer is I should have been trading more and I haven't. So sort of answered your question. Got it.
00:42:25.126 - 00:43:07.772, Speaker C: And then, yeah, I have to ask this question on behalf of the audience. You're basically a sage in this space. So I'm curious, like, we're all wondering, is the cycle bottom in? Should we expect to double bottom like 2018, 2019? What are the odds that we even see another cycle? There's some speculation that this space is just a scam. What are your thoughts there at a high level? Are we coming out of the bear market? To me it seems like, and you can actually look at the analytics on chain and see that most coins for BTC and ETH at least are in profit. It seems to me that there might not have been enough pain felt. BTC is still sitting at around 30k, eats around two k. These are still very valuable assets.
00:43:07.772 - 00:43:13.340, Speaker C: We didn't see what we saw in 18 and 19. Has there been enough pain and what's to come?
00:43:13.532 - 00:43:56.896, Speaker B: I think price wise, it would take something sort of really monumental to take us below FTX lows. I don't want to speculate on what that would look like because it's so horrific. Like, even a lot of the binance stuff, I feel like the market's quite reasonably priced in. Unless it's like a binance insolvency or something, just like several orders of magnitude worse than what we're imagining, then I would imagine that even in the worst case scenario, the FTX lows hold. That said, as far as has there been enough pain? I'm certainly of the opinion that even though price based capitulation may have occurred, there's always plenty of space for time based capitulation. If macro stays shit, and if in general these outflows continue and we just keep stealing money from each other and no new inflows. Low volatility is another way to shake people out.
00:43:56.896 - 00:44:06.284, Speaker B: And just a crap market, even if it's not directly sort of, price go down equals rekt. So we have other levers we can pull to make people miserable. Don't worry, Justin.
00:44:06.864 - 00:44:11.704, Speaker C: So you're excited for 2024 in general, you think it's going to be a good couple of years ahead of us?
00:44:11.864 - 00:44:44.672, Speaker B: I hope so, yeah. I think the spot ETF is like a real thing in terms of just like a credible narrative. And then if you can basically combine making up that the halving is bullish and dumping it on spot ETF allocators, that's like a match made in heaven to actually get some people buying this thing. And if the economy isn't a total piece of shit at that point, and maybe retail comes back and gambles a little bit. I think in order to facilitate retail, it's not really apps or anything of that nature that does it, it's price. So we start lifting some offers on these things and they'll be back pretty quickly, hopefully 2024. But time based stuff is always very tricky.
00:44:44.672 - 00:44:51.472, Speaker B: I'm trying to figure out what's going to happen in the next hour and still lose money. I don't know, about multi month, I guess.
00:44:51.528 - 00:45:07.988, Speaker E: To follow up on all the discussions we have, I guess. Quick question. If you had to denominate your net worth or your crypto portfolio, would you denominate in a fiat currency like USD or the euro? Or would you choose bitcoin or ether? Just curious.
00:45:08.116 - 00:45:48.572, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I think in the past my answer would have been BTC and then my answer would have been ETH. I think currently it's just sort of USD. I find it's best to be sort of price agnostic when it comes to the underlying. Especially having seen it at like three, three k and also seen it at just feel like having that benchmark in my head will just add so much noise and confusion. And in general, I don't operate on like multi cycle views when it comes to my own trading, investment, et cetera. So I think early on, if you're being aggressive, and especially if you're in a bull market, which is really important, denominating in the underlying is really important because if you're like up in USD on your altcoins, then, and you know you're underperforming relative to BTC and Eve, the risk profile of your trading and investing is like pretty garbage at that point.
00:45:48.572 - 00:46:04.140, Speaker B: You should always know what BTC and ETH are doing, especially if they're going up to make sure that your alt bets or whatever other bets you're taking sort of makes sense contextually. Like if you can make the same or better returns just by holding BTC and ETH, they're doing something wrong. But macro, bigger picture for me at this point, it's USD, GBP.
00:46:04.292 - 00:46:14.708, Speaker A: It is hard to know what to denominate in. The only thing that I've seen kind of be consistent over the years is australian beach mansions. Those seem to be a pretty steady denomination. People do.
00:46:14.796 - 00:46:17.984, Speaker B: Yeah, the Defi founders are having a good old time with that as well.
00:46:19.044 - 00:46:46.552, Speaker E: Speaking of DeFi, and I guess in the e to B DC ratio, of course I focus my content and my research specifically on DeFi. And Justin, he has this project Asteria in the NFT space and I think we're more both lean towards being ETH Maxis, even though we understand the value of etc. How do you use ETH BTC with your trading or investing framework? And where do you think etc goes from here?
00:46:46.648 - 00:47:21.414, Speaker B: Yeah ETH BTC used to be way more useful than it is now. It's been basically range bound for like a year. Bigger picture and hasn't been doing much now. I think there's actually some signal in that because in the past it would just underperform massively, especially on corrections where BTC would dump like 60% and ETH ends up dumping 80. And we've seen a shift from that, which I think is generally kind of positive terms of structure. And my base case is that ETH will still outperform when it comes to bullish market conditions. So just the fact that it's been relatively muted and holding up when the market's been shit I think could be seen as a sign of just sort of apathy, but to me as a sign of strength.
00:47:21.414 - 00:47:55.248, Speaker B: The fact that it didn't do the usual thing and mega dump. And I think when it comes to a different regime, bullish market conditions, I'd expect BTC to just go up. That's sort of my base case. In the past it was much more useful as a kind of altcoin risk barometer proxy of sorts where you could look at BTC and decide how much you want to allocate into alts relative to BTC or just in general. And that was also way back when we used to trade alts primarily against BTC. So ETH BTC was helpful in that regard, but nowadays its a lot less so. But I think yeah bigger picture at the moment, like short term trading, I almost certainly dont use it at all.
00:47:55.248 - 00:48:10.436, Speaker B: All these headlines are also BTC oriented so I dont see why ETH would outperform in the kind of short to medium term while were going through this deluge of bitcoin spot ETF's. But when it comes to larger cycle bull trend stuff, yeah I think BTC, it's my base case until proven otherwise. Cool.
00:48:10.460 - 00:48:52.204, Speaker A: And one thing before we go to our last segment that I want to ask you, getting into the process a little bit, because I've checked out your discord shredder with cred, you tell people how to work out. I know you've had your fluctuations when you were earlier in your life with weight going up and down, and you really dug in and try to find clean information, and that's what I want to double click on. You know, you've done amazing content for trading, and you're one of the most influential kind of trading coaches, but also with something like shred with cred. Are you using the same parts of your brain just trying to like, distill information into like, clean, you know, reliable bytes or what's your approach that makes you kind of able to do both of these completely different topics?
00:48:52.824 - 00:49:19.156, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there must be some overlap in terms of what are the first principles, which is a really cringey term. I hear people use it. It's like the fake philosopher go to nowadays. It also technically means absolutism. Anyway, not going to go down that tangent, but yeah, I think you have to realize for me especially, I don't have a trading background or a finance background. I just had to get into it. And I'm not a particularly intelligent person when it comes to trading related stuff and maths and all of that type of stuff.
00:49:19.156 - 00:49:41.602, Speaker B: It doesn't intuitively click with me as much as other things might. So when I had to start looking for resources to learn, I had to be like, you sort of have to give me one lego break at a time, not even like first level, but maybe like the first bit of gravel, and then explain it, boil it down to as simple as possible, and then build on that as slowly as possible. And that's how I had to learn around trading stuff, because it just didn't make any sense to me intuitively at first.
00:49:41.738 - 00:49:54.756, Speaker A: How do you know if you're checking out a website that has information about, hey, you should cut carbs or you should not eat butter? How do you know if this is a reliable source? Is it a lot of just figuring out which source is reliable?
00:49:54.900 - 00:50:29.176, Speaker B: Honestly, at this point? I've been into it since evidence based fitness stuff since I was 16, and I helped proofread an article for this nutritional research review when I was 17 or whatever, because I've been around the evidence based field for a long time and I guess just experience at this point and knowing which researchers to follow, which publications, etcetera. Also a lot of it is really bloody intuitive. And I think from crypto you can kind of start to tell when someone's a scammer or is acting in bad faith and trying to sell you a diet or something. So that skill has definitely been helpful, but some of it is, like, really commonsensical. Like, oh, bread makes you fat. Garlic bread is my favorite food.
00:50:29.280 - 00:50:30.568, Speaker D: I could honestly eat it for every.
00:50:30.616 - 00:50:32.272, Speaker A: Meal or just eat it all the.
00:50:32.288 - 00:50:35.000, Speaker B: Time without even stopping. You get fat?
00:50:35.112 - 00:50:36.192, Speaker A: No, why would I get fat?
00:50:36.288 - 00:51:00.162, Speaker B: Bread makes you fat. Bread makes you fat. It's like, okay, so if you put me in a metabolic chamber and I eat one slice of bread every single day, am I going to get fat? Very unlikely. Okay, so now we can infer from that that mechanistically, it's not the bread that's making you fat. Maybe there are other forces at play and you can sort of, sort of move from there. As long as you've got, like, decent starting assumptions and also, like, know where to look, it's fine. As far as shred with cred, honestly.
00:51:00.162 - 00:51:53.670, Speaker B: I just built it up as an educational data dump resources resource rather, because certainly in the bear market, one of the things that is worth building is your health, because it's going to nuke in the bull whether you like it or not. So you might as well have a decent foundation in terms of just your energy levels and your habits, etcetera, and build them when you're not really. The opportunity cost is much lower if you want to be really cynical about it. Also, a very common misconception when it comes to fitness related stuff is that the amount of work you need to do to maintain what you've got versus the amount of work you need to do to make progress, there's actually a big bloody gap between those two. So your maintenance volume and your maintenance calories, just the key point you've got is actually a rather straightforward process, whereas in order to make progress, there's quite a big jump. So I think most people can maintain what they've got with far less effort than they might think at first. So it's sort of, you want to be countercyclical with it almost, and build your health and resources in the bear market and try to maintain as reasonably as you can in the bull market.
00:51:53.670 - 00:52:28.890, Speaker B: Yeah, for me, I was like 115 kilos when I was like 18. I'm sat around 78, 80 nowadays, and I'm not obese anymore, which is nice. I've also, I think, sort of discipline, which is a misnomer, but like, in general, having good habits is something that carries over to trading. Like, it's very hard to think of someone who has zero sort of discipline, motivation, willpower, good habits, et cetera, in their sort of day to day life eating activity, etcetera. But suddenly when they sit down at the desk, they're this God disciplined trader with their time and research and execution. It's just quite unlikely. Generally, these things sort of spill over.
00:52:28.890 - 00:52:42.654, Speaker B: And you want them to spill over positively, not negatively. So, yeah, I mean, that exists. I'm sure I can ping a link somewhere in the show notes and description people want to go, and they're just a ton of read only channels that if you want to take care of stuff, you can do that there.
00:52:42.954 - 00:52:56.922, Speaker A: I love it. Yeah, I've checked it out, and it's great having somebody do all the work for you and just kind of find the right sources and you don't have to claw through the Internet and see if someone's trying to sell you, you know, diet pills or what.
00:52:56.978 - 00:53:04.494, Speaker B: That's my next venture. You've leaked it now, Jordy. But it's fine, I'm sure. Yes, on Friendtech. Fatloss pills. On Friendtech. There we go.
00:53:04.994 - 00:53:13.014, Speaker A: Have you been following this, like, hollywood diet? It's like an injection or something, a sempic.
00:53:13.594 - 00:53:40.070, Speaker B: All this other stuff? Yeah, I have. And I don't know, I've got like a hot take that. It's probably a net positive overall, at least with the available evidence. And if it sort of continues working as it's been observed, because obesity is really bad, man. Like, it just is. Like, as far as all cause mortality goes and healthcare costs and whatever reasonable metric you have, it's just not a good thing for life or for the country or for economies. And really there are no upsides to it.
00:53:40.070 - 00:54:08.884, Speaker B: Now, a zenpic is like a bit extreme. And the appetite sort of curbing effects that it has. The reason a lot of the time people come out of it looking like fucking aliens is because they just don't eat anything whatsoever. And so there's like no protein, no calcium, no micronutrients, none of that shit. And so they just lose so much tissue, muscle and fat at like a rapid rate that they look a bit disformed. But I think, you know, I'd rather take some disfigured humans over obesity epidemic. So weird trade there, but that's the.
00:54:09.384 - 00:54:16.984, Speaker A: Absolutely cool. And with that, let's. Let's go to our last segment. So we have a segment that we've been trialing called approved or not approved?
00:54:17.844 - 00:54:18.864, Speaker B: Approved.
00:54:20.284 - 00:54:59.128, Speaker A: Last week, unfortunately, we had a lot of approved stuff. So I've tried to at least kind of skew, skew my choice for this week towards not approved. But let's see where we end up. So this was what I found this week. I opened my Twitter and I see that there's an update on Abraham Eisenberg. Apparently, there's all kinds of not approved stuff going on. There's, like, layers and layers of not approved, starting with, you know, this guy has been caught with child pornography, and next level, the US government is basically analyzing every tweet interaction, even, like, that he had.
00:54:59.128 - 00:55:38.732, Speaker A: And, you know, I realized when I went through his, you know, recent tweets and replies that he was following me in his very most recent retweets are of me. And likes are, funnily enough, this tweet, which I thought was the most sarcastic, epic tweet in history that he liked. I was talking about Richard Heart here because the SEC had just announced that they were going after Richard Heart, and somebody was saying, Richard Heart made a lot of money. And I replied, it's easy to cash out when you're scamming, but it's hard to stay out of jail. And Mister Eisenberg liked this the day before he got arrested and put into jail.
00:55:38.788 - 00:55:50.836, Speaker B: So you're going to jail, Jordy. This is the clearest sort of aiding, abetting co conspirator case I've ever seen in my zero years of being a prosecutor. So nice knowing you. I can replace you as co host. I'm sure that'd be completely fine. Right, guys?
00:55:50.980 - 00:56:17.140, Speaker A: This is like, so many levels of not approved, not approved. You know, I don't know if you guys have been seeing, like, the indictments of CZ and all these other ones, but they seem to always have signal chats or telegram chats or something. I don't know if they're getting them directly. I don't know. What do you think, Craig? Do they have a backdoor into these apps, or are they just having a whistleblower taking screenshots or what's actually happening?
00:56:17.252 - 00:56:36.084, Speaker B: I think screenshots, honestly, I'm not sure if there's. I think at this point, if signal were compromised to that effect, we would have heard about it. But this is just amateur, specifically speculation. But some of the stuff that comes out of it is quite funny. Disastrous, but also quite funny. Like, we're running an unregistered securities exchange, bro. You know, that type of stuff.
00:56:36.864 - 00:56:53.192, Speaker E: And for those that don't know, Abraham Eisenberg is the guy that exploited the Mingo protocol on Solana and then also tried to liquidate Mitch the first time. Second time, he should have done it the second time, but he was the original person that tried to liquidate Mitch on his fat Aave physician.
00:56:53.288 - 00:56:55.284, Speaker A: He's also given us some epic pastas.
00:56:55.704 - 00:56:56.424, Speaker E: Oh, yeah.
00:56:56.504 - 00:56:59.244, Speaker A: We can use in a future pasta of the month episode.
00:56:59.744 - 00:57:02.864, Speaker B: He's also a kiddie fiddler, so fuck him, you know? Yeah.
00:57:02.904 - 00:57:09.304, Speaker A: I mean, once this stuff comes out. Oh, man, I'm glad I never actually interacted with him. I don't know.
00:57:09.424 - 00:57:11.008, Speaker B: Sorry, alleged kitty fiddler.
00:57:11.096 - 00:57:13.964, Speaker A: Sorry, Taiki, what do you have for us?
00:57:14.264 - 00:57:47.070, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think this happened a day or two ago where obviously now with friendtech success, a lot of copypasta and clones are popping off, dropping new tokens and friendtech from their official Twitter account mentioned. Hey, you know, like, we don't like this, right? We don't like this type of behavior. If you use other platforms, we're not going to give you points where you might even, like, forfeit points for your system. And then I think, like, 20 minutes after they immediately deleted the tweet, but fortunately, I got a screenshot. So what do you think, Craig? Is this behavior approved or is it not approved?
00:57:47.142 - 00:58:07.878, Speaker B: No, that's not approved. Not approved. I'm glad they walked it back when they did, and Racer posted, like, a pretty candid tweet saying that it was wrong and how he felt. But, yeah, this is very anti crypto, sort of treno. Not even. It's not even gatekeeping. It's the opposite of locking your members in and stopping people from experimenting with other clones and tech, etcetera.
00:58:07.878 - 00:58:13.808, Speaker B: So, yeah, ideologically, this is, like, really anti crypto. I'm just glad they sort of got rid of it pretty quickly.
00:58:13.896 - 00:58:39.374, Speaker C: It's also anti competitive, right? Like, I think in the US, there's laws around this, right? Like, you can't force people to not use other services. Like, we've seen these sort of loyalty programs arise in crypto, and they're very strange to me. I also don't know how it's enforceable. Right? Like, do you just look at everyone who has a Twitter account and signs up on another app? I mean, you can't do it by address because we can just spin up new wallets. So very strange. I also don't approve.
00:58:40.274 - 00:59:22.504, Speaker A: I think it's more for the kind of tier eight influencers because they're the ones that drive the traffic to the app. So if Kobe, etcetera, were using another one, it would make it less beneficial. I do want to ask you, Justin, since you're in the building space and you have to think about competitive advantage, you come up with a good idea, and then it's just a smart contract. Ten other people can do the same thing. So you have to kind of think about how are you going to differentiate yourself or how are you going to provide some kind of moat, right? And for a place like binance, it's like liquidity. Liquidity begets liquidity. And, you know, even if somebody has the same software and, you know, the same CEO or whatever, they're going to have a problem moving everybody at once.
00:59:22.504 - 00:59:37.468, Speaker A: When you, when you look at something like, like friendtech trying to stop influencers from going to other apps, do you, at least from a builder side, understand, like, what, you know, what they're trying to do? And why do you say it's not approved when maybe they're just trying to, you know, keep their business?
00:59:37.636 - 01:00:12.604, Speaker C: I entirely resonate with the idea of wanting all of cred's content on fin, on friend tech. Like, I get it, I get the intention, but I mean, there's only, there's two paths to this, right? You either make a better product or you have some sort of like better marketing incentives or a marketing campaign, right? And do we really, like, they understand this too, right? If they don't have the best product, they shouldn't win. If they don't have the best marketing and reach, they shouldn't win. I mean, this is sort of like, we know this. You know, I get, I get the, the feeling of, you know, we have to be hyper competitive. We talked about this on the last episode. The market shrinking, the pies getting smaller.
01:00:12.604 - 01:00:24.808, Speaker C: Like everyone's fighting for the same users. It's a little confrontational and, you know, fortunately, racer and the team walked it back. This is everyone's instinct, but I don't think it's, you know, really what they intended or the right way to go about things.
01:00:24.916 - 01:00:51.218, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I do think that at the end of the day, there has to be something a little bit more than airdrops, because if once the airdrop is done, people just move on to the next thing that's going to have an airdrop, and then the next thing, then you're just kind of getting stuck in this perpetual, like, farm dumping cycle which, you know, maybe the humble farmers are used to, but in terms of creating a sustainable app, it's difficult for a builder at least. Cool. Let's see what other approved, not approved we have.
01:00:51.376 - 01:00:56.594, Speaker C: Yeah, so this one is mine here. So if you're following along, Bitboy.
01:00:59.254 - 01:00:59.590, Speaker B: Was.
01:00:59.622 - 01:01:17.306, Speaker C: Unfortunately removed from bit boy. So I think, you know, he's long been struggling with some mental health issues, some substance abuse issues. But I don't know how the bit boy crypto team pulled this off. Like how Ben was just removed from bit boy. What are your thoughts there?
01:01:17.330 - 01:01:17.490, Speaker B: Cred?
01:01:17.522 - 01:01:22.874, Speaker C: Is someone taking over the crypto cred army? Is someone going to kick you off twitter and take it?
01:01:22.954 - 01:01:39.442, Speaker B: I sure. I sure hope not. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, first things first. If the points about, you know, substance abuse and et cetera are true, genuinely, my thoughts go out to people struggling with that type of stuff. It sounds very corny, but, you know, I've seen it destroy lives and it's like a very real and scary thing.
01:01:39.442 - 01:01:51.264, Speaker B: So, yeah, regardless of the truth of that, I hope it's not a thing or that gets resolved. As far as the actual channel and removing Ben, I don't know. You can't really have bit boy without Ben, right? Ben is bitboy.
01:01:51.564 - 01:01:59.876, Speaker A: Maybe you can. I mean, it's like James Bond, you know, people thought that, you know, Pierce Brosnan or whoever is you get the next guy yet? You know, it could be.
01:02:00.060 - 01:02:01.388, Speaker B: I don't know, Jordy.
01:02:01.556 - 01:02:07.904, Speaker A: It could be like a. Like, he's like an asian bit boy. Like, you know, is there a reason why bit boy has to be Ben Armstrong?
01:02:08.244 - 01:02:19.076, Speaker B: Well, I think he just built the whole thing up. Right. Right. Like, it's him. He is the brand. I don't know how much, like, independent research or valuable stuff they put out, which isn't just sort of Ben being entertaining. Right.
01:02:19.076 - 01:02:29.492, Speaker B: So I don't know what the longevity of this is. Be without him. I tried to watch a bit of the show, no pun intended, when he wasn't on it, and it was sort of his co host, and it just wasn't the same.
01:02:29.588 - 01:02:42.274, Speaker A: I mean, Kobe was telling us that Mario Nafwa was trying to buy upon me at some point, and, you know, this is. This is a prime target you're buying, you know, a million plus subscribers, and Mario can take over. Why not?
01:02:42.394 - 01:03:05.614, Speaker B: Well, look, if I suddenly start tweeting cents, then you'll know that I've sold out and sold my account, et cetera, but no plans for the time being. And I just find it really weird because you end up in this place where your sort of personal brand becomes indistinguishable from whatever sort of corporate face that it has. And I'm more of a monist than you on this, Jordy. I really think if you take one away from the other, well, you can't separate the two, rather, is how I should say that.
01:03:05.734 - 01:03:36.102, Speaker C: I wanted to ask you guys about this. I had the same experience as you credit. Sounds like I had legitimately never watched Bitboys channel or any of the content. I mean, I've seen a few clips here and there, but once he got removed, I watched the video, like, where they announced he was removed. First time I've ever seen the show. And I was just astonished that people are watching this. Like, no disrespect to them, but it's just junk content, right? Like, they're talking about Cardano and when the bull runs gonna start for Cardano and all these, like, other irrelevant tokens, and they're really not adding much value.
01:03:36.102 - 01:03:40.662, Speaker C: Like, have you guys actually watched this content ever? Or have you just sort of like, seen the memes?
01:03:40.798 - 01:03:46.622, Speaker B: Crypto YouTube is like, notoriously bad. I think that's really what it comes down to. It either comes down to sort of.
01:03:46.758 - 01:03:49.994, Speaker A: We have two crypto youtubers with us, Craig, so we gotta be.
01:03:52.974 - 01:04:16.048, Speaker B: Exactly. But it just seems like the funnels are either this kind of catch all, respond to every news bull market coming top ten tokens to make you rich type of narrative. And it's not sort of technical, it's not really fundamental. It's just sort of entertainment. And the other funnel is essentially really short term traders just like, punting out content. Like, bitcoin's up 10%, it's down 10%. And they're just trying to farm people for a refling funnel.
01:04:16.048 - 01:04:27.440, Speaker B: And that really seems to dominate. And as far as educational stuff, or even educational plus entertaining stuff, that's just not it. We have all the open mouth memes, and that seems to be what's working.
01:04:27.552 - 01:05:15.140, Speaker E: Yeah, it's all about, like, incentives, right? Like, if people get rewarded for making donut faces and calling for like $1010 bitcoin, then they're gonna do it right, and they're gonna get the ad revenue, they're gonna get sponsored by all these exchanges and the get reflinks. I mean, I've been watching your content for like, three years, and I've always, like, appreciated, like, how honest you are. And I'm also trying to, like, take my channel, like, that route. And I think, you know, this podcast will also try to stay kosher and not touch those types of things. But yeah, I think crypto YouTube, it's mostly just clickbaity stuff. But I think there are pockets of value. And I think with steadylast podcast and I guess the individuals on this panel, I think we can try to take away the stigma around, I guess, crypto content on YouTube, we're in a good spot.
01:05:15.172 - 01:05:57.692, Speaker A: Because we don't need sponsors, we don't need to kind of shill anything. And we, we aim to be entertaining and have good guests and thankfully we've done okay so far. I understand bit boy has done an amazing job of really building a huge amount of viewership. They probably did all kinds of YouTube specialized tricks to get there. I understand that his business associates, now, they're kind of in this spot where they kind of co own whatever the ip, you could call it the channel and the distribution channel of that. And they have somebody who is no longer able to perform at a level that is needed for it. So I'm curious what they're going to do with these distribution channels.
01:05:57.692 - 01:06:15.168, Speaker A: And there is some value, I'm sure, to having just that megaphone, especially in something like crypto. But I agree with all of you. This is a not approved situation. I don't know if they did something wrong, but the whole situation with bit boy and what's happened here feels not approved.
01:06:15.256 - 01:06:16.536, Speaker B: Not approved. Yeah.
01:06:16.560 - 01:06:41.230, Speaker E: And like, I understand, like, bitboy gets a lot of like, hate and stuff, but, you know, he did start from zero and he was able to build this empire and for these, his other business partners to like, just kick him off and claim that he has substance abuse and like, financial damage and like, that, that part was kind of, you know, like, it didn't sit right with me. So, I mean, hopefully, like, you know, Ben's okay in real life and we'll see where bit boy crypto goes from here.
01:06:41.352 - 01:06:46.642, Speaker A: Awesome. And Craig, have you looked at approved? Not approved. Do you have any interesting things to share?
01:06:46.738 - 01:07:17.818, Speaker B: I have, yeah. It was actually Elon's tweet announcing that they're planning to have sort of audio, video and audio calls coming to X, or Twitter, as it's more commonly known. And he also said in that same tweet that X is the effective global address book. So I really don't want my reply guys calling me at three in the morning because one of my calls got stopped out on some illiquid asian session. Wicked. That sounds absolutely miserable. And I also just don't really trust the platform as far as protecting data.
01:07:17.818 - 01:07:45.732, Speaker B: We've also seen some weird action around DM's and sort of gating those to people who have twitter blue and all sorts of weird UI ux type of designs. And this seems like a bridge too far for me and people are going to abuse it and I just look, Twitter, I'm supposed to open it, doom scroll, make myself feel miserable and then close it. This whole turning it into another social media app to that extent, or, like, a more broad communications app. I don't think it's approved.
01:07:45.788 - 01:07:55.764, Speaker A: Justin, what do you think? I mean, when I look at my phone, I can facetime somebody. I can telegram call them. I can WhatsApp call them. I can Facebook call them. Do we need another audio call?
01:07:55.844 - 01:07:56.508, Speaker B: Yes.
01:07:56.676 - 01:08:16.482, Speaker C: To me, this is 100% approved. I mean, the market's a little boring. What is going on? I just want to be able to dial you guys on Twitter anytime and chat. I should be able to send cred one ETH and get on a call with him and ask him if I should hold. Either sell it or if there's going to be a double bottom. I think it's cool. Power to elon and x or Twitter.
01:08:16.482 - 01:08:17.574, Speaker C: I approve.
01:08:18.594 - 01:08:31.534, Speaker A: I guess this is part of the everything app thesis. He's trying to smash everything into what we used to call Twitter, which he's trying to make us call it something else. I don't know. Taiki, are you gonna use it if it's one app for everything?
01:08:33.194 - 01:09:15.292, Speaker E: I was actually gonna chime in and say that I feel like this is what friend text should just mimic as they onboard onlyfans, influencers and whatnot. Maybe they can have an in app system where anyone can permissionlessly send this OnlyFans girl .1 to get on a five minute video chat. And maybe that can be a recurring business model for these influencers, because one of the problems with Friendtech is that the creator only makes money when people sell them by that kind of perverts incentives and whatnot. So I personally wouldn't use, I mean, this audio visual calls, but, like, maybe Elon has, like, a big, you know, like, maybe Elon has, like, a bigger plan in mind and, like, friend tech, right. Racers should be trying to get. Get this, like, you know, on board, like, ASAP.
01:09:15.428 - 01:09:25.116, Speaker A: Wow. So it seems like we have a little bit of a mix of approved and not approved on this one. We need a final say that. Craig, do you want to take the final decision on this one?
01:09:25.220 - 01:09:37.805, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. You know, I'll flip flop, because that's what a trade is supposed to do, right? I'll make it approved, and then when it comes out, it's going to be terrible, and it'll be unapproved again, and we can go. Go back and forth ad infinitum. I think that's the best way to resolve it. Approved.
01:09:37.909 - 01:09:42.565, Speaker A: I love it. Cool. Well, I hope we can get you back cred. And thank you so much for being our first guest it's been.
01:09:42.589 - 01:09:43.373, Speaker B: Thank you for having me.
01:09:43.453 - 01:09:56.553, Speaker A: An awesome episode. I'm sure the viewers will love this one. Cool. We'll leave it here. This is a lot longer than our usual episodes, but I thought it was such a rare, unique opportunity to get cred on. We wanted to go a little bit longer, so hope you guys enjoyed and see you next time.
