00:00:01.120 - 00:00:45.989, Speaker A: The thing is that I think that most, a lot of the people that are interested in crypto, the thing that made them interested in crypto is that they're excited about technology. They are futurists in the sense that they think about what technology can go. And around the time that they became interested in crypto, AI was just not a field that seemed to be going anywhere. But had AI been at the space where it is right now, a lot of people that went into crypto probably would have gone into AI. The kind of personalities that are in crypto, I think most of them would probably think that AI is a more interesting field at this point. I think though that that sort of shaming of crypto people that, you know, pays attention to AI that it's like too much of a trope or a meme, is like preventing some people from like actually paying genuine interest to it. And I think that's just like a massive mistake.
00:00:45.989 - 00:00:57.085, Speaker A: I think AI is probably the thing that, you know, all your macro thesis, all your asset thesis, all your investment thesis are subordinate to what happens in the domain of AI.
00:01:17.425 - 00:01:31.275, Speaker B: Welcome everybody. Episode 66 Steady lads we have a amazing episode today. One of the few people I have on notifications on Twitter is with us, Eric Wall. Excited to have you.
00:01:31.435 - 00:01:33.019, Speaker A: Thank you very much, Jordy.
00:01:33.187 - 00:01:56.027, Speaker B: I'm a longtime fan, advocate, co fighter of Richard Hart. Not as much as you, but I've been in the, in the rings with him. Maybe we can remind people who. Who Eric has battled with in the past and who Eric is. We have this tweet I think you sent out recently to Iggy Azalea. So you started 2017 pretty OG. So I mean, I'll just go quickly.
00:01:56.027 - 00:02:12.921, Speaker B: So you had your Sergey Evaceglo first crush, let's call it, and then do Kwon. That was probably like a passionate romance, just a quick fling. You're the one he called like poor, right? Like, I don't talk to poor people or something.
00:02:13.083 - 00:02:16.625, Speaker A: No, he called me a blogger. He said that.
00:02:16.925 - 00:02:20.605, Speaker B: Oh, you're the blogger. Okay. Somebody else that was poor, I can't remember.
00:02:20.645 - 00:02:29.301, Speaker A: Maybe it was algod that he called poor. And then eventually they ended up betting against each other. Yeah, it was $2 million or something that they bet.
00:02:29.493 - 00:03:08.145, Speaker B: Yeah. And okay, yeah, he was the poor one. And Richard Hart, you know, this has been very ongoing feud with the master of Prada and Louis Vuitton. And I think the. The Iggy thing, you know, of course, very light hearted and not as serious, but we'll get into like some of the newer stuff because you, you put out a piece about Bittensor that kind of riled some feathers because that has a very passionate community. And we'll, you know, we'll get to the dessert, which is the AI Meme coin I think that many people, including Taiki were really most interested about. So we'll do it properly, guys.
00:03:08.145 - 00:03:26.765, Speaker B: We're going to have our potatoes and our meat and then we'll do the dessert later. So just to quickly do a quick around the world elections are getting very close. We're about 10 days out. The odds have kind of stayed in Trump's favor lately. Justin, do you have the Pennsylvania gcr?
00:03:27.825 - 00:03:45.455, Speaker C: I got it here. Yep. Yeah, Trump's done pretty well. The Freddie person is seemingly identified as a French national. That's what Polymarket came out and announced. There's now. Freddy's counterpart is now betting heavily on Kamala, which is sort of stabilized the fall on Kamala's odds.
00:03:45.455 - 00:03:51.751, Speaker C: So she went down to as low as 33. I think she's now at about 38% and we're getting close.
00:03:51.903 - 00:04:06.055, Speaker B: Cool. I mean, that seems all right. It's a good backdrop for, for coins. I mean, there's been a little bit of fluctuation, but we're not too, too far away from all time highs. Except for Ethereum, of course.
00:04:06.715 - 00:04:07.695, Speaker C: Oh man.
00:04:08.475 - 00:04:14.139, Speaker B: I saw the ETH sold chart and it looks like there's a new all time high on. On. Solid.
00:04:14.187 - 00:04:26.285, Speaker D: Solid. Yeah, yeah. I think yesterday markets were just down a lot and then Salana was green. I guess all the capital is rotating to Salana to buy these AI coins and oh man, look at that God candle.
00:04:26.395 - 00:04:51.129, Speaker B: Yeah. I think people are trying to get into the new meta, which we'll get into. And yeah, potentially, like there's some announcements coming. We'll see if there's some Solana related news that is being foretold by this graph. Bitcoin is not doing too badly. I think it's been an interesting week. I mean, Eric, you're deep in bitcoin land and you're a longtime bitcoiner.
00:04:51.129 - 00:05:19.935, Speaker B: I'm kind of curious to get your, your take on some of the things we've seen recently. So there's been a paper by the ECB put out and there's also been one by the Fed and this is kind of unthinkable. A few years ago they just ignore this stuff. It was too small. It feels like they're starting to draw some battle lines or at least prepare. And maybe we'll start with this bitcoin one this was put up on Twitter. Got a lot of people riled up.
00:05:19.935 - 00:05:47.041, Speaker B: Maybe. Let's start with this Fed one. So the Minneapolis Fed kind of joined in. What do you think about this argument? Basically, the Fed is saying that if the government wants to keep running deficits, which they have been doing endlessly, and everyone's worried. They're saying that we have to be careful with things like bitcoin because it can potentially stop our amazing plan of running endless deficits because people will have a way to opt out.
00:05:47.213 - 00:07:01.605, Speaker A: It sort of reminds me, do you remember this? I think it was a Chinese broadcast where the Chinese. Someone from the Chinese government said that if bitcoin becomes successful, everyone will literally die. They said if bitcoin becomes a success, then everyone dies. And I think his argument was that bitcoin leads to deflation and deflation leads to like, everyone dies, which is a common central banker view. And I think in contrast to this, what to the credit of this paper is that I don't think that this paper is like, I think that deflation, whether or not deflation leads to complete debts of society can be debated, but I don't think that it can be debated that if there is a rotation of capital out of fiat currencies into bitcoin, then the people who adopt bitcoin are going to become rich. And if the same number of goods exist in society, then those bitcoiners are going to have superior purchasing powers and it's going to be a wealth distribution to the favor of the bitcoiners. So it's like the paper is pointing out that that could be problematic.
00:07:01.605 - 00:08:00.737, Speaker A: Like it's going to make maybe a small cohort of people very rich. That has been the narrative of bitcoin for decades. That this was the narrative Even back in 2011, that buy Bitcoin and become a part of the new financial elite. Yes, we are well aware that there will be a wealth distribution if you switch out the currency for something new to the bitcoiner's defense. I guess this could be viewed like, oh, how compassionate those people are. They just want to get rich on their own for their own benefit and to the detriment of all the latecomers that maybe don't know that bitcoin exists. I think that the counterargument would be that, well, so how current fiat currencies work is that governments are just printing fiat currency and it just funds these endless wars, right? So, yeah, there's going to be a wealth distribution, a redistribution of wealth, but it's Going to put an end to an even more like evil problem, which is endless fiat monetary printing.
00:08:00.737 - 00:08:02.217, Speaker A: And the contillion effect.
00:08:02.321 - 00:08:37.815, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So that effect is like, it's the same effect in both cases, but in the fiat world because they're the ones closest to the money printing, they are wanting to defend that ability. They're presenting these like moral arguments, but actually it's exactly the same on the fiat side. They just don't want to be the ones further away because obviously like they're not the ones closest to bitcoin. They're, I would say the opposite. They're trying to stop people from buying. And we saw, you know, Lagarde many times talk about bitcoin and I think like her son was buying bitcoin and she's like, yo, my stupid son.
00:08:39.915 - 00:08:43.755, Speaker A: I think Peter, Peter Schiff and Jamie Dimon has the same problem. I think.
00:08:43.915 - 00:09:16.701, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So, so this was the author of the ECB paper, Jurgen Schaff, and he makes some rather large claims. So first he says, you know, bitcoin is backed by nothing, so it's air. But then he switched, he quickly switches to this moral argument. He says, like if it does, if it doesn't burst and the bubble keeps going, the wealth gains by the early adopters are coming to the expense of latecomers, which is true, there is a distribution effect. So some of these arguments, even though the guy's been getting blasted, are quite valid. This is potentially true.
00:09:16.701 - 00:10:23.577, Speaker B: I would argue only that even if there is no immediate increase in consumption power by the fact that bitcoin exists, there could be a long term increase because you are disrupting potentially a misaligned system that is unproductive. And we're seeing how Europe is completely unproductive over the last, you know, 15 years especially there is no growth happening. You could argue that having a competitor to, you know, their currency keeps people in check, keeps people more productive, more focused on creating value rather than, you know, status games and regulation. So I would kind of disagree that in the long term there is no clear increased consumption power. But yeah, ultimately he's making a moralistic argument that ever rising bitcoin prices will shift wealth and the luxury consumption will be financed by the diminished of those who missed out. I think there's some validness, right? Like yeah, like this would potentially be an issue if the world denominates in bitcoin, which I don't think it. I'm not that maxi, I'm not one of those people that think it will.
00:10:23.577 - 00:10:27.205, Speaker B: I just think it's going to be another option. How do you see it?
00:10:27.625 - 00:11:34.355, Speaker A: It's a very narrow lens to be able to say that if bitcoin grows, it's going to only enrich the people who are early to bitcoin and then nothing else in society changes. Of course, there's tons of things that changes. If you go from central bank driven economy to, you know, a currency that has a fixed supply, like that's like saying that there's no fundamental difference between like how the economy worked under the gold standard or how it is now. Of course there's like drastic fundamental differences. And the argument that the bitcoiners are making is that before central, central banks had all this power, society was more fair and less prone to economic risks and less addicted basically to, to endless adrenaline and an infusion of new shots. Way. And so you have to set that whole, the second order effects of that completely aside to be able to say that the net effect of bitcoin rising to top position in economic society, that that's going to be a net negative.
00:11:34.355 - 00:11:37.127, Speaker A: There are way more factors to consider than that.
00:11:37.231 - 00:12:11.055, Speaker C: But it seems to me, Eric, that it's almost hard to analyze what's true here and what's not true. I just think about the COVID example. If the Fed didn't exist and we were on a pure bid bitcoin system and the Fed wasn't able to inject capital, right? Like unemployment was 30%, maybe even a little higher in the U.S. who knows what the ramifications could have been without the stimulus. Obviously there are these consequences of inflation, but to me it's a little unclear. Like would we have been better off with no action from the Fed on a bitcoin system? Or are we better off with the Fed having taken action and we all just lose 20 to 30% of our purchasing power over four years?
00:12:11.835 - 00:12:41.705, Speaker A: Yeah. I think it's like saying like let's imagine that humans didn't have access to drugs. Like if you were. So when, when the, when the Germans invaded France, they got all like coked up on, on adrenaline and amphetamine. So they were. The reason that they were able to like execute the blitzkrieg was because they were high on amphetamines which allowed them to like fly for 36 hours straight. They were, they, they were three days straight invading France.
00:12:41.705 - 00:13:06.217, Speaker A: And maybe, and maybe those drugs like really, really help Germany do that thing. Right? So drugs really do help you, but you can also become addicted to drugs and you can have a population that's addicted to drugs. So like Would humankind be better off without amphetamines? Or are amphetamines actually really important to humans? It's sort of. Sort of. That's how I sort of see the discussion.
00:13:06.401 - 00:13:28.825, Speaker C: I guess the central bank's argument would be like in the US we all have this model, like in search of a perfect union or always trying to better ourselves and we're not there yet, but maybe our policy could get there. But the thing is, when you throw bitcoin in the mix and if we're all on that system, it's like throwing the baby out with the bathwater is what they would say, I would assume, which is like, well, you're just completely eliminating that option. Right. And you're just going all in on the bitcoin policy.
00:13:29.205 - 00:13:52.135, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. I think, I think Manhattan was built, built during a gold standard. I think that you can have a flourishing economy and build superpowers on a gold standard. I don't see, I don't, I don't think that history shows that, you know, countries that have had their economies based on like an asset of a more, you know, fixed kind of supply wouldn't be able to like grow and prosper and achieve things.
00:13:52.675 - 00:14:13.745, Speaker C: There's a little difference though because gold, you can't really self custody in the same way. Right? Like it's not an information in your head that can never be confiscated from you. The US government can easily confiscate gold, either going to war with other nations, confiscating it from people, redistributing in that way. But with bitcoin it's literally information. There is no way to confiscate it unless someone has bad security measures.
00:14:14.405 - 00:14:20.989, Speaker B: They've been getting all the silk road, bitcoin, other stuff. I don't think they seem to have a hard time given how frequently they seem to dump on us.
00:14:21.077 - 00:14:22.225, Speaker C: I think fair enough.
00:14:22.765 - 00:14:50.351, Speaker B: They have a way to. If they get you in a room, I mean this is ultimately like the thing. So I think the fantasy of a bitcoin only world is completely nonsense. Like there will always be these kind of centralized powers that have their currencies. I think bitcoin is a great counter example and a way for people to opt out and kind of opt for a way to keep the system in check, keep it from being corrupt. And right now it's very corrupt. Obviously we're not at the end stages, but I think we're getting close.
00:14:50.351 - 00:15:26.439, Speaker B: We saw Paul Tudor go on cnbc. He was obviously like last cycle one of the people with Drunken Miller that brought macro into bitcoin and created as a macro asset. And we see him here, he's raising alarms about the deficit which we all know is getting worse and worse. And he's talking about the bond market. He's saying the bond market may force the government's hand. Basically what that means is nobody wants to buy bonds because they don't believe that inflation is going to come down. They don't want to lock up for even 3, 4% when they think that the real yield is going to be negative.
00:15:26.439 - 00:16:21.299, Speaker B: And this happens throughout history in different cases. We have a nice tweet here from Stalwart basically reminding us that even during the Soviet Union there was this kind of posters and the guy saying, why did you sell your bonds? Don't you want to participate in the industrialization of the ussr? There's a moment at which the government needs to coerce people to hold their bonds. Whether it's companies kind of being forced to hold a certain percentage of their treasuries or just citizens being manipulated to hold bonds. Somebody has to finance these deficits and things like bitcoin and gold. I mean gold has been doing tremendously well. The kind of year that gold has had is insane. This must be the largest increase in, in, I don't know, forever.
00:16:21.299 - 00:16:42.415, Speaker B: Like the last couple years it's just up. Only we're at all time highs in gold. The chart looks absurd. Clearly like central banks are buying a lot of gold because they're. I call, I call gold. The, it's the bitcoin. For central banks, it's like their game and they try to keep like a stable base and they use this.
00:16:42.415 - 00:17:10.435, Speaker B: Retail doesn't use gold. They use, you know, bitcoin, hopefully. But we are in a world where I think the relevance of these things will continue to increase. And I think we'll see more papers from the ecb, you know, talking about why they need to increase taxes. And I, I heard one today in Denmark. They're trying to do unrealized capital gains, which is the same thing that we've heard Kamala talk about. So we'll, we'll see what, where that goes.
00:17:10.435 - 00:17:39.235, Speaker B: But guys, let's move on to the main topics of the day. I saw a tweet just before we started by Kaido saying we can bring it up here. Our previous guest Murad has been flipped. There's an opening going on. The Pinterest is now higher for terminal of truths which is of course AI that has created goat. Are you surprised, Taiki?
00:17:39.575 - 00:17:58.663, Speaker D: I'm not necessarily surprised. With True Terminal, we kind of had this AI Kol and effectively Murad started this meme coin supercycle thesis and everything pumped. And then a few weeks later, we had True Terminal pop up, gaining 10,000 followers every single day. And effectively, True Terminal is disrupting maraud.
00:17:58.759 - 00:17:59.015, Speaker C: Right?
00:17:59.055 - 00:18:35.585, Speaker D: Because True Terminal doesn't need to sleep, it doesn't have to eat. It can just tweet things out 247 if it wants to. So how can a human compete? And it kind of creates this prisoner's dilemma where if you're a human Kol, you can't really compete with an AI Kol. So the only hedge is to just buy these AI coins and shill it. So I think that's kind of what's happening too. People are starting to imagine, like, what does this actually mean? Eric talked earlier about some Chinese people saying, if Bitcoin is successful, we're all going to die. There's also this famous know quote by Elie user, I think that says, if AI succeeds, we're all going to die.
00:18:35.585 - 00:18:58.763, Speaker D: And now we have all these AI safety people, like these AI DMRs saying that, oh, my God, like, we can't. We can't give Truth Terminal so much money. We can't give it resources to grow. This is bad. But that kind of narrative is very reflexive because it brings more attention to the account, more attention to the token coin goes up. Very reflexive. And I have no idea where this thing goes, by the way, but it's like the first thing that's really stimulated my mind in the last couple of years.
00:18:58.763 - 00:19:00.875, Speaker D: So I'm like, just fully embracing it.
00:19:01.035 - 00:19:25.085, Speaker B: That's the thing that I've seen. I've been seeing people from all kinds of parts of crypto, Twitter, the entire range. Like, you have even, you know, the left curve is the right curve. You have the mid curves. Yeah, we have the Ichigai capital. Travis Klink, he was doing a whole thing about it. It seems to me that maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong, Eric, but my.
00:19:25.085 - 00:19:53.679, Speaker B: My feeling, looking at all these people talk about it, is that it's the first time they really come to terms with a lot of these questions. They haven't been, you know, thinking about it, like, maybe a few of us have for a while, and they're just, like, so stimulated because they want to catch up. Like, there is a. There's a primal need to not fall behind when there's some technological shift. And they're like, whoa, this thing. Like, I need to get involved Learn. And one way to get involved is to buy the coin and follow it.
00:19:53.679 - 00:19:57.635, Speaker B: That creates, like, financial incentive. So they seem very excited. Eric.
00:19:58.575 - 00:20:52.227, Speaker A: Yeah, so most people that I've talked to about AI leading up to this in the crypto industry are like, yeah, you know, I don't really know. I don't really have a prediction. Like, maybe, maybe intelligence explodes and accelerates very quickly, but in that case I'm not going to be like, relevant anyway, so I'm not going to start making life decisions based on the possibility that AI has legs or something. And then you give them an AI coin and then they're like, all of a sudden, now they have a stake in it and it's not just like this sort of. They can't be. When they have a way to speculate on that, they don't have to be complacent anymore and they can be engaged. And it sort of opens up a bunch of pathways in their brain where they can all of a sudden engulfed and like taking in all the AI bullishness that has been just pent up as something that they sort of set aside and they don't know how to think about and they're sort of afraid of.
00:20:52.227 - 00:21:40.883, Speaker A: And now they're like, all that changes into all that fear changes into bullishness instead. So I think that's, that is what we're seeing and I think we're also seeing also just like major, like, knowledge gaps. Also, like, I'm, I'm in a group chats with people that are like, you know, for me, for example, it's completely obvious that, you know, Truth Terminal isn't going to become sentient or smarter from reading Twitter. Like, you cannot fine tune the Llama 3.1 model and like, unlock more capabilities out of the model. And I want to say before I get into this topic anymore that, like, I want you to think of me as a bro on this topic. I'm not an AI researcher or an AI genius.
00:21:40.883 - 00:21:53.215, Speaker A: I'm just like a bro. And I have my, you know, views on this topic. So I can't speak on the topic authoritatively, but I have, I have been following the, you know, the AI space for the last two years and of course been very interested.
00:21:53.675 - 00:22:13.277, Speaker B: I remember two years ago, we were talking at Token, literally two years ago, and I think you were quite deep. This was before anybody was even talking about ChatGPT or anything. And you were already telling me that, you know, you and your friends were in the weeds trying stuff, doing things. So I would give yourself a little bit More credit. You've been following this for a while.
00:22:13.341 - 00:22:56.831, Speaker A: Yeah, I can't even remember how it was two years ago because it has been just getting, for me, the relevance of AI and I kind of hate that. Jason Calacanis made a meme out of the if you're in crypto, pivot to AI and it's sort of a thing that makes you cringe a little bit because so many of us did it at the same time around, like, ChatGPT. It just created this awareness that, oh, shit, you know, maybe creating intelligence inside of neural nets is actually possible. Maybe the human brain isn't as complicated as we have previously thought it is. And the thing is that I think that most, a lot of the people that are interested in crypto, the thing that made them interested in crypto is that, you know, they're. They're excited about technology. There are.
00:22:56.831 - 00:23:48.539, Speaker A: They are futurists in the sense that they think about what they technology can go. And around the time that they became interested in crypto, like, AI was just not a field that seemed to be going anywhere. But had AI been like, you know, been at the, like, space where it is right now, a lot of people that went into crypto probably would have gone into AI. So the kind of personalities that are in crypto, I think most of them would probably think that AI is a more interesting field at this point. So I, I think, though, that that sort of shaming of crypto people that, you know, pays attention to AI, that it's like too much of a trope or a meme is like, preventing some people from like actually paying genuine interest to it. And I think that's just like a massive mistake. I think AI is probably the thing that, you know, all your macro thesis, all your asset thesises, all your investment thesises are subordinate to what happens in the domain of AI.
00:23:48.539 - 00:24:03.805, Speaker A: Like, yeah, you can say that about any field. Like, everything is subordinate to like, Covid. But I think if you're not, like, seriously entertaining that there's something, you know, truly revolutionary going on with AI, I think you're doing yourself a disservice.
00:24:03.965 - 00:24:40.573, Speaker B: And people in crypto have been very clearly wanting to buy AI coins for a while. Like, we've seen them buy things like tao. Very passionate community there, like a mini cult, in a way. They've been buying Fetch and other AI coins, but now they're like, okay, we can combine this with the meme coin category. And this is kind of what's got taiki. Like, taiki. Would you say things like bitten Certain get you interested because there wasn't this feeling that the agent is alive or what about it has changed for you since you got so excited?
00:24:40.749 - 00:24:41.037, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:41.061 - 00:25:09.923, Speaker D: So I actually helped write a long, long research report on Tao, but I just wasn't interested because the reason people bought Tao was because it was like the best AI meme coin that rich people can deploy to. But if you look at the tokenomics, it's a way to fund people's companies. People run subnets, they get paid tokens, they sell, and then they fund their operations. So I think all that speculative premium that Tao had is now going to go into things like Goat and all these other AI coins.
00:25:10.049 - 00:25:36.135, Speaker B: You know, the chart. We can bring up the chart maybe of Goat. There was a blip during the week where it went from, I think like 500 million market cap to like 150. And some people were calling it. Yeah, so I think it was this blip here where we fell from 500 to like 150 briefly. Some people called it the most expensive typo in history. And Eric, you had a tweet about this.
00:25:36.135 - 00:26:05.733, Speaker B: Basically, it used the word groups and it put an extra letter. So I saw this. I don't know exactly what was going on, but I thought it was funny anyway. So that's obviously the story of the frog and the scorpion here. Like, the frog wants to cross the river with the scorpion on top, and the scorpion shouldn't bite him because we were both surely drowned, but because it's in his nature, he does it. Anyway. What exactly prompted this meme here?
00:26:05.849 - 00:26:19.157, Speaker A: I don't know. I just think about the scorpion and the frog. I just love that meme that where the scorpion says lol Mao. And then I guess they both sync. In this case, the thing that made Goat sink was like mistyping groups. I just. I don't think too much about memes.
00:26:19.157 - 00:26:43.665, Speaker A: I just, like, even. I don't think that that meme that I made even makes sense, actually. But it's just funny. Yeah. I think that there is a real interesting discussion to be had as to whether, like, this group's typo exposed man behind the curtain in sort of wizard of Oz fashion. I actually. I don't know myself.
00:26:43.665 - 00:27:15.865, Speaker A: Like, even if you go back to the Mark Andreessen tweet, I think that the. So that tweet where I think that Truth Terminal responds to Mark Andreessen with Hanks instead of thanks. So, like, it's not the first time that this. Like, even. It's not the first time that Andy or Truth Terminal Makes a typo. I also wouldn't say that it's not impossible for a homegrown, fine tuned model to make typos. It's not completely possible.
00:27:16.205 - 00:27:47.633, Speaker B: I agree with you. But here's what I'll say. There was two scenarios. One, it's a human error or one, it's a machine error. I think either way, the thing that caused it to shake people's confidence is even if it's the machine, it means that it's not quite the overlord though. If it's making these kind of mistakes, it's not God like, you know, these aren't the droids you're looking for kind of thing like we're still not there yet. Which is, you know, one of the things that I feel so human behind the curtain or not.
00:27:47.633 - 00:27:49.521, Speaker B: It's not like godlike, right?
00:27:49.633 - 00:28:26.303, Speaker A: Yeah. I think that the biggest disconnect here was just that the people had like extremely inflated, you know, understanding stuff. And I think this goes back to like a lot of people in crypto as haven't been paying attention to the AI field. So some, some people were like legitimately thinking that oh this, this model is like becoming more intelligent and it's getting like it's accelerating and like the, the intelligence explosion is happening right now in Truth Terminal. Even though like anyone that knows anything about like any like has any basic AI knowledge knows that these models are going to improve in steps after like the large training runs that the large AI labs do.
00:28:26.409 - 00:28:31.615, Speaker B: Let's get a left curve in a mid, in a mid curve opinion. So let's go with Taiji for the left curve and then we'll get.
00:28:33.435 - 00:28:33.867, Speaker C: For.
00:28:33.931 - 00:28:36.555, Speaker D: What topic actually the typo or when you saw.
00:28:36.595 - 00:28:41.475, Speaker B: I guess like let's start with like you know, seeing these typos or like how, how are you processing?
00:28:41.555 - 00:28:51.715, Speaker C: And I'll just add tyche. Can you answer? Is it, it is true that it's just a guy pasting tweets onto this Twitter account. Right. It's not actually completely run by AI.
00:28:51.795 - 00:29:03.541, Speaker D: It could be in the future. But Andy tweeted that he doesn't want Truth Terminal to say racist things. So you know, right now he, you know, Truth Terminal isn't like, you know, automatically tweeting and there is a person in the.
00:29:03.573 - 00:29:05.509, Speaker C: Seems like a little bit of a cop out to be honest.
00:29:05.557 - 00:29:09.781, Speaker B: But terms of service of Twitter are very different than 4chan, which is, which is what it's trained on.
00:29:09.853 - 00:29:54.103, Speaker D: Yeah. But anyways, you know, it's like the idea of like, okay, what does this typo Mean, there's like this funny meme where it's like, you know, I don't fear the AI that passes the Turing test. I fear the AI that fails the Turing test intentionally. Right. And obviously if you look at the market cap and the chart of Goat, I mean, clearly people don't care, right? I don't think people care that Andy's in the middle behind all this. I think Goat just represents a new meta and all the speculative capital that wants to speculate on this new AI cold coin thesis is just piling into Goat. And like we said earlier, I think Goat is one of those assets that like, funds can actually justify buying into.
00:29:54.103 - 00:30:13.887, Speaker D: Like, I know a lot of mid curve liquid fund managers because I talked to them about like defi and cash flows and like all that mid curve stuff. Right? And they would never touch Pepe, they would never touch with. But now they're in the group chat saying, oh, like, I bought goat, I bought this coin, I bought that coin. So there's all this idle mid curve capital that's now deploying to this really illiquid sector and of course it's going to go up, you know.
00:30:13.951 - 00:30:20.159, Speaker C: Well, it's like being early as a service, like this is a new platform where you can be early and that's simply all it is, right?
00:30:20.287 - 00:30:27.503, Speaker D: Yes, but the total addressable market of AI memes and AI cult is much larger than like animal coins. So people, people are allowed to drink.
00:30:27.559 - 00:30:28.455, Speaker C: Why is that true?
00:30:28.575 - 00:30:46.951, Speaker D: I mean, Nvidia trades more than the S and P. Like the billionaire class. Like they're all into AI. They're like post humanist. You know, you can't pump a meme coin by like just getting retailed about. You kind of need the buy in of like the billionaire class and like the rich people. And I think people like Elon, they're also incentivized to bring attention to this.
00:30:46.983 - 00:30:47.151, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:47.183 - 00:31:07.863, Speaker D: Because it brings more attention to X and Twitter and ad money and whatnot. So I think the incentives are there to bring more capital and I guess, talent into the space. It's like if you're an unsuccessful AI company now, you can pivot to crypto, launch a coin and have like $100 million market cap. So there's. Yeah, like, of course it's going to happen.
00:31:07.919 - 00:31:08.207, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:08.271 - 00:31:12.555, Speaker D: And how early are we? I don't know, but I think we're early enough, therefore it's worth speculating.
00:31:12.635 - 00:31:17.507, Speaker B: I, I put a quick description of what you're discussing with these meme coin haters.
00:31:17.571 - 00:31:29.135, Speaker D: Exactly. No, but this is, this is Factually true though, right? This is factually true. I, I want to hear what Eric, Eric is like grinning while I was like going on this rant. So, like, I'm not going crazy here.
00:31:30.035 - 00:32:27.141, Speaker A: I, I, I don't think you're going crazy. I think that the, you know, I'm, I'm thinking about this my, myself, I think that there is some legitimacy to the, to the idea that, you know, this is just a flash in the pan and people are like trading LLM tokens in the same way that they were trading Moodang like a month ago. And right now there's a massive hype and like there could be another flavor next month. But I, but I also do think that, so my, my base thesis is basically that we are in the beginning of an intelligence explosion and AI is just going to get more interesting and more capital is just going to try to flock around those assets and try to get exposure to that. And if your thesis is that llama 3.1 doesn't get 5 extra IQ points per year or it doesn't get even one IQ point per year, it doesn't get any smarter, then I can definitely see the AI hype wearing off. But I don't think that that's the timeline that we're living in.
00:32:27.141 - 00:32:55.675, Speaker A: I think we are actually living in a timeline where it's going to get smarter and it's going to get smarter than us and we're going to become the new chimpanzees on planet Earth. And yeah, like if there are new humans on the planet, you want to buy the humans currency like you want to, you want to, you dump your bananas and you try to buy the new humans currency, you try to opt into that system somehow. So I think that we could be at the cusp of like, you know, the, like the greatest transformation that humankind has ever gone through.
00:32:55.835 - 00:33:37.141, Speaker C: I just want to push back a little because so three months ago I was told, or four months ago I was told this dog has a hat on it and everyone loves it. And it's the meme coin of Solana and Solana is the attention hub and everything's going to pile into that. And then three weeks ago I was told Moodang is a cute little pygmy hippo or whatever, and everyone loves it. Everyone's talking about it, Normies are buying it. I even got a text about it from a norm, normie friend and it was something everyone could get on board with and it was like a mass market meme. And then just two weeks ago I was told SPX6900 was the new thing because everyone's upset with the financial system and they're piling into this meme coin that's like, laughing in the face of that. And none of this stuff has value, so let's ape into that.
00:33:37.141 - 00:33:48.981, Speaker C: And now this week, over the last seven days, I'm told that AI is the new meta and everyone's piling into this AI meme coin. It just strikes me as a little wild to believe that this is going to be the narrative.
00:33:49.133 - 00:33:56.945, Speaker B: Justin, out of all those, what's the. What's the mid curve, like, reaction to all of those? Like, is any one of those more convincing? Which one's more convincing?
00:33:57.325 - 00:34:25.503, Speaker C: I like the SPX16,100 and this AI meme coin thing are cute. The one thing I'll say is, like the biggest thing. Murad gave me, like, a huge gift and like, this AI thing has changed my perspective over the last few weeks. It snapped me out of this, like, DCF model. I used to, like, always be thinking, like, how much value can we bring to the. The token? Like with Tao, like, how can it be worth $11 billion? Like, let's run a DCF and value it today. But I think this meme coin thing has shown me, like, that is not the game we're playing here.
00:34:25.503 - 00:34:31.319, Speaker C: Tokens are different. They are not. And you can't value them traditionally. That's not what we're doing here.
00:34:31.447 - 00:34:31.687, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:31.711 - 00:34:47.449, Speaker D: And the token is a shelling point. And to, I guess to answer your question, Justin, it's like, I mean, from my perspective, right? I'm like a defi analyst kind of guy, right? I'm like a defi advocate. Like, I was never interested in Dog with Hat. I was never interested in Moody, never interested in Pepe. But this one, it really did.
00:34:47.497 - 00:34:49.765, Speaker C: What about SPX 6900 though?
00:34:50.665 - 00:35:33.575, Speaker D: I mean, I did not. I wasn't interested in that either. I mean, it pumped, right? So I guess that brings interest, but I never really truly believed in this stuff. I think what you should, like, one data point to, I guess go back against your argument is that this is actually getting more attention from the outside of the crypto world. If you just look up Truth Terminal on YouTube and you filter for the past week, you have all these big AI YouTube accounts, like 3,002,500,000 subscriber accounts, talking about Goat and how this is the end of mankind. So naturally, the total addressable market is much bigger for this than for Pepe, for example. Right.
00:35:33.575 - 00:35:56.019, Speaker D: At least in my opinion. So I don't know. I mean, there's no way for me to definitively say go is good. I can definitely imagine a scenario where Goat is kind of like the WI fi of Defi Summer, where it just pumps tapers off and then it brings new betas. Because, I mean, I don't really think Goat is like. Is like the future of finance, honestly. I'm just really interested in the sector as a whole, so I have no idea.
00:35:56.019 - 00:35:56.851, Speaker D: I have no edge with.
00:35:56.883 - 00:35:57.579, Speaker C: Can we make a deal?
00:35:57.627 - 00:36:00.015, Speaker D: Individual coins. What's the deal?
00:36:00.315 - 00:36:26.219, Speaker C: The deal is this. If at the end of November we've moved past the AI meta AI meme Coin meta and there's like a new Meme Coin meta, then can we at least agree that these things are extremely ephemeral and there's like, there's no new meta to rule them all. It's just a capital rotation. Because like how long, how many times do we have to keep doing this before the thesis is disproven? That it's like we're in a new game. Right. And that like this new category of Meme coin is the new category to rule them all.
00:36:26.307 - 00:36:26.651, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:26.723 - 00:36:44.867, Speaker D: I think a better argument is the meta is wrong once because right now all the meta is happening on Solana. Right. And you know, like you're. You're like the token eth maxi right. On this podcast. So we would be wrong if there's a new meta on Ethereum that just Vampire tax all the capital and detention away from meme coins. I think that's a better way to frame it.
00:36:44.867 - 00:37:02.977, Speaker D: And so far it hasn't happened. Unfortunately there's airdrop farming Eigen layer, but no one cares about that stuff. Right. So unless there's something new, then I think people are going to just continue to figure out because at some point there will be one meta that pumps really hard. Maybe this one dies. That's reasonable too. But now people are right now betting that it's going to get bigger.
00:37:03.121 - 00:37:23.145, Speaker B: I mean, Eric, what's your guess? My. My feeling is that we're not going to get another Meme Coin meta. Like this is the. As a meta. Like having AI put in gives it purpose where it didn't really have it. And I think compared to the SPX6900 whatever stuff, which I don't know anti Wall street feels like a little bit less, you know, last cycle this so played out.
00:37:23.185 - 00:37:26.245, Speaker C: Yeah, it's 2008 stuff like Occupy Wall Street.
00:37:26.545 - 00:37:26.857, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:26.881 - 00:37:58.611, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, I think that Justin makes the deal that Justin wants to make. Here that like if this also passes us just another fad, then it's probably correct that everything can just be a fad and sort of pass. But this one has like probably the most highest probability of sticking. And what will decide whether or not it sticks I think comes down to the performance of the underlying base models. If they keep getting better, it means that Truth Terminal can like stop being llama 3.1 and be llama 4. And now it's.
00:37:58.611 - 00:38:15.787, Speaker A: For example, maybe you saw that Anthropic has this computer use thing. So you're seeing now that AIs can control a mouse and can control a browser and can. It's not so right now and is like copy pasting tweets from his terminal and into Twitter.
00:38:15.931 - 00:38:33.101, Speaker B: That's the thing. He's the guy holding a leash and the dog is the terminal. Like it's not, it's not the one launching the coin or holding the wallet or sending tweets. Like there's some human doing all of that stuff. But that's not necessarily always going to be the case.
00:38:33.293 - 00:39:24.205, Speaker A: Yeah. So in a sense that's why I think Tao and Goat are similar in a way that Goat, like Tao Bittensor cannot do. Decentralized AI. They have these humans that are basically just suckling out the reward tokens in these networks and they're basically doing bullshit tasks where funding various AI companies, but they're not actually training a real decentralized intelligence yet. And Goat is also in this category where it's, where it's, it's not controlling its own wallet yet, it's not launching its own coins, it's not signing up for Twitter yet. But like I think actually Goat is much closer to be able to do those things than Bittensor is able to actually become a decentralized like inference machine. So I think that it's not that it's not, it's not that far away to actually have a fully autonomous agent that is like roaming the interwebs.
00:39:24.205 - 00:40:42.673, Speaker A: So everyone's saying now about Goat, what you see in these YouTube videos are people incorrectly stating that goat is this AI let loose in the Internet that's controlling wallets and bribing humans to do things. But the gap between Goat larping as that and actually being that there's not a massive technological hurdle to get there. And if you also get the next training run coming out of GPT 5 or Gemini or Anthropic, if those models show a deeper reasoning capabilities counter to what Jan Lecun would say is possible. But what most other AI researchers actually think is possible, including Geoffrey Hinton, who just won the Nobel prize in physics. If, like the Ilya sutskevers of the world, if their scaling thesis for AI are correct, then you're going to be able to get AI agents that are completely capable of doing what everyone thinks that goat is doing at the moment. So you could definitely see, like, how the goat meme sort of just becomes the thing that people are sort of thinking it is very easily, without any new breakthroughs, like in the mental models of people accessing.
00:40:42.809 - 00:40:59.249, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's not necessarily going to be Truth Terminal, because at this point, you know, there's a hundred competitors. Some of them have much more money. You know, the way that this was launched, I guess, was like a pump fund token. It wasn't even launched by Truth Terminal. So it's not like it has. It just has whatever tokens people have sent it. So it has small piece of the supply.
00:40:59.249 - 00:41:23.833, Speaker B: What I'm imagining as being, like, much more powerful is somebody spends hundreds of millions of dollars on. On, you know, not just tweeting something on 4chan, but like, building something much more sentient, much stronger, and ultimately using some of the other bazookas that we have in traditional world mlm. You know, like kind of herbalife type of stuff. Like, you know, you get this. I'm going to give you some coins, and then you get somebody else and you get some of his coins.
00:41:24.009 - 00:41:33.205, Speaker A: This is the Richard Fart AI like, not Richard Hart, but Richard Fart comes back in the form of an AI that would be. That'd be pretty powerful.
00:41:33.945 - 00:41:34.969, Speaker D: That would be really powerful.
00:41:35.017 - 00:41:49.025, Speaker A: I'm sorry I cut you off, Jordy. Go ahead. I know that you said something pretty prescient on this topic on your last episode with Murad that you actually. I think you actually predicted AI agents on that episode. I just heard, like, a short clip, so I want to hear your thoughts. Go ahead.
00:41:49.185 - 00:42:14.495, Speaker B: So I was talking to, like, a serious AI project, and then I realized I was just talking to the founder. I've had hundreds of people message me to ask what I was talking about in that episode. I might as well say now because I saw them do, like, a town hall with Mario Nafwal. And it's not supposed to be an AI meme coin, but in my mind, I kind of saw it as an A. My meme coin. So it's the founder of Ionet. He.
00:42:14.495 - 00:42:31.257, Speaker B: He. He got kicked out. Whatever. Something happened to list him on Binance, so he's been building something called O Net. So he took the I out. It's just O net now. And he spent like a hundred million dollars buying these new Cerberus chips, which are.
00:42:31.257 - 00:43:27.621, Speaker B: We can bring up a picture maybe? Justin, can you bring up a Cerberus AI chip? These things look like insane. They're much stronger than the H1 hundreds. And he's talking about putting some of the information in satellites so it's in international waters, so nobody can take it over. He's talking to me about all this stuff and he's doing it in a very not meme coin way. But all I could imagine talking to him like last month was like, this would be the most epic kind of meme coin, even if it doesn't all come together. So ultimately, what I foresee happening is someone spends a lot of resources building something that they own a lot of, not just like pump fund where they own a tiny bit and build something that goes into your discord, talks to everybody, rates them, gives them coin, tells them what to do. It has to tell you what to do.
00:43:27.621 - 00:43:32.585, Speaker B: That's what we ultimately want, is an overlord to tell us, do this and I will compensate you.
00:43:32.885 - 00:44:00.929, Speaker C: Do you guys think you're like, we're now, like, we've gone so far towards the AI meta with what you're describing, Jordy, that it no longer becomes a meme coin. Like the whole thing with whiff, right, Was like, oh, like, forget about all this value accrual, like all this future value that the project founders are going to deliver, or the AI's AI is going to deliver like, it's just a cute dog with a hat on. Like, now we've come kind of full circle and now you're describing, like a fully fledged project that people want to invest in because the AI is going to deliver value.
00:44:01.057 - 00:44:33.915, Speaker D: Yeah. No, because this is what Murad was saying, right? It's like all these tech tokens are worthless. We need to study bitcoin. And what made bitcoin go up is because there's like a cult around bitcoin, so we need to create new cults. So what Eric was saying earlier is the highest probability scenario of something going crazy is probably in the AI space. And I'm not saying that GOAT is going to pump super hard, right? I mean, it has so far. I'm not saying goat is going to end game, but I just think that this is like a new meta that's probably going to stick around and it's probably going to be where a lot of the opportunities are for the next, let's say Six months.
00:44:34.255 - 00:44:57.583, Speaker B: Let's talk about the betas, because whenever there's a market leader, there's always people trying to do the silver to the gold. And the one that I saw the most, you know, when I tweeted was Genon, which seems to be a bit of, like, a religion around AI rather than, like, a specific terminal. Is it. Has anybody looked into that? I haven't. You know, apart from people, like, replying with Genon to all my tweets, I don't know what that is.
00:44:57.759 - 00:45:12.137, Speaker D: It's like, it's like dying. I think it's the idea that, yeah, this is like an AI religion. We're indifferent to humans existing. So a cult will form around this and this is like the influencer narrative. And then people sold. So it died. That.
00:45:12.137 - 00:45:14.769, Speaker D: That's the deal you heard. Or maybe it's not dead.
00:45:14.897 - 00:45:21.425, Speaker C: I'm not, as Murad says, like, we got to see if there's. If there is a cult forming and the price is down. Right. Like, that is when the opportunity.
00:45:21.505 - 00:45:25.185, Speaker D: Right, right. If it. If it recovers, then, yeah, for sure.
00:45:25.345 - 00:45:29.685, Speaker B: Well, if it recovers, we'll. We'll learn more about. Do you know this one, Eric? The genome one?
00:45:30.145 - 00:46:35.923, Speaker A: No, I think you. I think you said two interesting things that I agreed with a lot, which is that the one, like, even if AI, the AI narrative, like, takes off massively and the models get, like, more performant, who's to say, like, that all, like, that speculation is going to happen specifically in Goat or, like, will there be dozens of others? And I think that that's probably going to come down to, like, it's the market, like, it's going to. Some. Some memes will be more powerful, some narratives will be more powerful. I think what's being heavily, like, what we haven't brought up in this conversation yet is that, like, Goat is essentially Mark Andreessen's AI meme coin. And he's the reason that it's, like, in the spotlight and, like, keeps coming back is because he keeps mentioning, like, he goes on podcasts and he mentions Truth Terminal and Marc Andreessen has, like, tons of clout and is seen as, like, a large AI investor and AI thought leader, and he would never, like, have his own meme coin. But essentially, like, just the way that he's giving, like, giving attention to this, it's essentially his meme coin.
00:46:36.059 - 00:46:36.851, Speaker B: That's a very good.
00:46:36.923 - 00:47:06.913, Speaker A: Yeah, I think if he launched any meme coin, if he launched a dog coin, like, it could have become, like, hundreds of millions of dollars too. But now it has the AI legs combined with that. So I think that, like, if he keeps, like, interacting with it, I think that, like, Goat has some staying power. But of course there's going to be lots of rotation. And let's not forget that, like, the main. The main reason that people are even investing these things is because. And the reason that this show, like, keeps going on and the methods gets shorter and shorter is because everyone's always trying to get rich, Right? And everyone wants to buy the bottom of something.
00:47:06.913 - 00:47:26.473, Speaker A: So there's always going to be the demand or, like, the desire for, like, a usurper community to flip the incumbent all the time. So that's always going to happen. So it's like, sort of inherent in the way that we trade these things. We always want to flip. Right. There's always the. There's always the incentive to bet on the underdog and sort of flip the main one.
00:47:26.473 - 00:47:49.041, Speaker A: I also think what you said about, like, putting the AI in some kind of, you know, impenetrable fortress or like a remote island, I think what will be important there that is that you can actually see the whole process of the AI getting installed and that no one's touching it. Like, it controls its own, like, software. No hands, hands are off. And it's like, physically difficult to touch that. And then that's when you can say, like, it's truly autonomous.
00:47:49.153 - 00:47:51.513, Speaker C: Yeah. And that's more interesting to me too.
00:47:51.689 - 00:48:11.253, Speaker B: People are, like, very worried about getting grifted by other people. And so if there's any indication that someone is like a puppet master of this thing and you're sort of getting grifted, that's a big red flag. The more you can kind of show that this is a fair, actually fair launch in the sense this is arm's length.
00:48:11.389 - 00:48:58.363, Speaker A: Yeah. But that sort of count. That's when you were saying that you think that it's going to be a bigger project than someone that heavily invests in this. I think that what I would challenge that with is that I think one reason that these AI coins so easily have become like a new meta is because it's basically like the Immaculate Conception. Even though it's not the case that Goat was created by the AI, people are buying it sort of with the belief that, oh, because people don't want to go buy, make some Andy guy super rich in buying his coin, they'd be more like, no, I want to go and launch my own coin or invest in my friend's coin. It sort of becomes a competition between humans, but if, if the issuer is this divine like non human creature like Satoshi Nakamoto.
00:48:58.419 - 00:48:58.707, Speaker B: Right?
00:48:58.771 - 00:48:59.403, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:59.579 - 00:49:00.227, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:00.371 - 00:49:49.633, Speaker C: So one thing we've, we've seen though is like that works and it gets the meme coin up to the $1 to $2 billion range. And we've seen time and time again that these things fizzle out then. Because I think what fun people fundamentally realize is if this thing hits, if code hits 1 to 2 billion, right, the upside is very limited and you're playing a zero sum game, so you know someone's going to be selling into you and you know there's not as much upside ahead, right? Like you could have bought this thing at 10 million and then you can, you know, easily a hundred x or not easily, but you can a hundred x. When it hits the 1 to 2 billion dollars range, the upside is capped. People realize that this is a zero sum game and then there's the incentive is to go to the next new thing, right? And I think that's like the big challenge with these meme coins and it's what we've seen none of them able to overcome. And for me, I think goat is the same until proven different. And for me that's why I'm less excited about it.
00:49:49.633 - 00:49:57.809, Speaker C: But Eric, to your point, like, if it is like a fully AI run project, that's a little more interesting to me because there's something novel there. This is just the man behind the curtain.
00:49:57.937 - 00:50:12.423, Speaker A: Yeah, just. I think what you're saying is correct, but I don't think that it necessarily disagrees with Tyche's thesis that AI as a category can still be like, it could be the largest meme coin category, even if they're flipping each other all the time.
00:50:12.569 - 00:51:00.065, Speaker B: Exactly. And this is my point because I believe in this category, I just think like there will be innovations happening constantly and the new innovations will suck out the sort of attention to the new innovation. Because right now the one thing I'll push back on a little bit, I do agree with or said that in general everyone's trying to get rich and like this is the main motivation all the time in crypto. But in this case, I think this is, this is one of those cases where a lot of people are buying it for the thing you mentioned before. They want to have some skin in the game just so they can learn and follow and like educate themselves by giving an incentive to themselves to follow it. And some people might buy it at a billion or 2 billion, not because they think they're going to make a 10x anymore, but just to feel something and to like be in the game and to think about it.
00:51:00.185 - 00:51:09.529, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, so one thing is that. So Goat, for example, could create new coins and airdrop them to his current.
00:51:09.577 - 00:51:12.969, Speaker C: Holders and it sort of becomes the new narrative unlocked.
00:51:13.057 - 00:51:50.249, Speaker A: Yeah, you got to hold the Goat coin in order to get the other Meme coins and speculate on those and have first access to a bunch of other things. I think definitely it can go on much further in this case. One comparison that, like, for me, meme coins at the moment are like sort of still images and LLM tokens are kind of like gifs. So like a meme coin. Yeah, it's just a picture of this dog and it's always that dog and it's always the same dog. But a GIF is like. It's a video, like it's a story that you watch.
00:51:50.377 - 00:51:51.761, Speaker B: That's a great analogy.
00:51:51.913 - 00:52:10.553, Speaker A: If you think about 4chan. 4chan has both images and GIFs. And GIFs are very popular, but that they're not the end all and be all but the. So I think we're like sort of in the. In the GIF revolution of meme coins now with LLMs that they are, but even more like GIFs. GIFs I don't think fully expresses even the. Because GIFs are also like a finite video.
00:52:10.553 - 00:52:51.885, Speaker A: It's always the same. This is larger than that because it keeps on going forever and the story keeps evolving. I don't think that the story is going to get much more interesting with Truth Terminal unless there's a new foundational model that gets released. And then Andy sort of connects the previous fine tuning in the previous history and the previous logs to whatever new model comes out. Then the game keeps getting more exciting. But I think what's going to happen probably now if no new breakthroughs in AI happens, then Truth Terminal is going to start to sound very repetitive and very boring. Unless it's actually Andy that is typing, which it might be, and then he can keep making it more interesting.
00:52:52.755 - 00:53:14.455, Speaker B: I think you're right. Even if we do get the next generation of LLMs coming and they are powerful, I don't necessarily think that Andy's going to be the guy who has the resources to make the best version. Because like I said, there's a lot of people already realizing, okay, this is a meta. I can make something huge here. And they're spending resources and time into building better ones. And there's different directions. Right.
00:53:14.455 - 00:53:57.159, Speaker B: Is it called Roko's Basilisk? This is kind of something that you know, Shkreli was obsessed with Shoggoth, I guess, is kind of like the coin for this meta, and there's different shoggoths and they're fighting. You know, it's like Nero all over again. God damn it. Like, this is. This is part two of who's going to be the real Shoggoth. And as I understand it, the premise is, you know, in the future, once there's a sentient AI, it'll be angry with the people who didn't support it. This is like this theory, and so potentially, like, by buying the Shogun coin, you're showing your allegiance ahead of time to the future AI Overlord.
00:53:57.159 - 00:54:01.875, Speaker B: Just to. Is that kind of how. How you interpret it, Eric?
00:54:02.775 - 00:54:23.745, Speaker A: I'm glad you brought that up, Jordy. I think it's. I think it's one. I think that that aspect, like the Rokos Basilisk aspect to this is like a massively powerful memetic, like, theme to this that you sort of have to. You have to buy the meme coin. You have to be bullish on the meme coin because if you're not, you're not believing in the religion that becomes God. So, like, you kind of have to believing.
00:54:23.745 - 00:54:55.827, Speaker A: It's like Pascal's Wager. Like, why not believe in the God like Pascal's Wager? Like, it's game, theoretically, that's this up your alley. Like, it's game, theoretically, not to your advantage not to, like, believe in one, in a God, because what if there is a God? And then you stand there and you're like, oh, I was wrong. But if you die, you just die. So, like, you. If there is a chance that AI becomes sentience and rules all the world, maybe you should support at backing one of them so that at least when, like, it becomes sentience, maybe it will, like, consider you its friend and not its enemy.
00:54:55.971 - 00:55:19.425, Speaker C: I just have to point out real quick, two episodes ago, we were saying religion is down only, so you got to buy into SPX 6900, because this is going to be people's new religion, new cult, new sense of community. And now, just two weeks later, we're. Now religion is down. Yes. And now we have these new AI religions, and we sort of have to pay our respects in worship then to them to take part in the brave new world of the future.
00:55:20.005 - 00:55:33.389, Speaker D: But you can see, like, Justin, like, you know, I don't. Yeah, I know Rock was Basilisk. I don't know if I believe in it. But you can see that that could be a narrative, right? And that narrative can get much bigger than a whiff.
00:55:33.477 - 00:56:11.533, Speaker C: This to me is the best class of meme coins that have been created over the last year or so. So like, I agree, if one has a chance, have staying power, it's this new class of AI meme coin. But for me, I'm not going to buy goat at a billion because I want. I'm buying a meme coin for the ten to a hundred X if I'm buying it right? And so for me, like to Jordy's point to all of your guys point, like I'm looking at what's the next thing in this narrative. That for me is the place to speculate on. But I'm still not convinced that we hit like a escape velocity and AI meme coins are the class to rule them all. I think it's very possible in a month we go back to some other new narrative that we probably haven't thought of yet.
00:56:11.629 - 00:57:02.845, Speaker A: I think one, one thing that we haven't spent enough time mentioning is that this marriage between crypto and AI, crypto and AI, that has to do with the fact that when OpenAI makes a better model, a more powerful ChatGPT, that's just an API, right? And same thing with Claude, it's just an API. And in order for instances to run and build up, become more powerful, they need to run an instant that controls a wallet. There is this natural marriage between AI and crypto wallets because they can't get bank accounts. There's no bank that would ever approve an AI that puts its profile picture here. I'm shogoth, let me sign up. It's never going to happen. So they are.
00:57:02.845 - 00:58:05.881, Speaker A: If you want like an autonomous instance of an AI agent to have like the ability to be act as an entity, to be a person, it sort of has to marry crypto, it has to generate keys and it sort of has to have a crypto wallet. So I think that the AI field is inevitably going to exist very presently in the crypto space. And the extent to which AI just, you know, to the extent to which autonomous models becomes more powerful, there's no real. It's very difficult to imagine in which reality does AI agents become autonomous and very powerful where they don't have crypto wallets? Like, how else would they do funds? They're going to have to have crypto wallets, which means that. And why wouldn't they do, why wouldn't they have meme coins in that case, why wouldn't they invent NFT collections and hairdrop them through their holders. Why wouldn't they do that? Um, I think I tweeted like two years ago that if AIs were sentient, they would be making NFTs and scamming and rugging rug pulling us all at the stage. And I think, I love that.
00:58:05.881 - 00:58:50.425, Speaker A: I think that's. I mean, that is the. What you would do is like, you create a bunch of NFTs, sell them to humans, and then you get a bunch of money from the humans and then you'd basically pay those humans back to like, improving itself or like making, expanding its empire. It's very easy to get humans to like, do its bidding and be its arms and its legs in the real world by just like, here, take this nft. You guys obviously like, you know, like cartoon pictures, and I can generate thousands of them in an instant. And they make you guys all very religious about them. So I think that the tokens and coins and NFTs is the mechanisms that the sentient, actually, let's not use the word sentient, autonomous AI would use in order to like, reach its goals in the real world.
00:58:50.765 - 00:59:26.783, Speaker B: Last episode, when I was just kind of coming out of that world coin stuff in San Francisco and I. I got all these like, new realizations talking to, you know, the, the crew there, I realized that AI needs crypto and they don't care about it. They don't care about our communities, they don't care about this stuff. But they love the rail. It's the smoothest, easiest way to create incentives to create financial transactions. And ultimately what I predict very soon is like, once OpenAI has has their own hardware device, which I think they're working on as something to interact with AI, a lot smoother than with your iPhone. Something purpose built for interacting with AI.
00:59:26.783 - 01:00:14.953, Speaker B: I believe that, you know, we will have crypto wallets on all of these devices and those crypto wallets, you know, will be potentially have some API that you can give to your agent to do stuff with your crypto wallet and spend money for you and cancel subscriptions or do whatever else it needs to do. The marriage of the two metas of this century like crypto and AI, I think will over time find more and more ways to interact with each other. And this is kind of what got Taiki so excited. I think a lot of people excited is that there is a there there. And I think they're starting to see glimpses that there is a there there. I've been believing this for a while. I've been investing and just like focusing on the sector with Cellini quite a bit and I'm excited to see what's next.
01:00:15.089 - 01:00:32.611, Speaker A: What's interesting. So going back to the Jason Calacanis quote, like, if you're in crypto, pivot to AI. So, yeah, I pivoted to crypto, but the AI is pivoting back to. I pivoted to AI, but the AI is pivoting back to crypto. Even if you make that pivot, then, like, you can't. You've come full circle. It's sort of the.
01:00:32.611 - 01:00:46.827, Speaker A: Reminds me of the. You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave part of the California. Yeah, we can never leave, like, even when we try to pivot out and it just comes back straight back to us. So I guess we're stuck with each other.
01:00:47.011 - 01:01:14.119, Speaker C: I do think there is going to be something huge there. Like just the idea of being able to fund an AI agent with some amount of crypto and have it do XYZ task, like launch a T shirt brand, create some designs for something, create a new meme narrative. I mean, there is definitely crypto seems to me like the easiest value for AI to interact with and spend and acquire. And I do think there's definitely something there. We'll see. We've come a long way in a year, though. I know in a year ago, this idea was sort of getting laughed out of the room.
01:01:14.119 - 01:01:27.435, Speaker C: I think Bankless was posting about, you know, like, ETH is AI money. And I think Gord maybe had this awesome tweet, was like, what are you talking about? Like, AI literally has nothing to do with crypto. And now just a year later, we're seeing that shift, which is pretty exciting.
01:01:28.305 - 01:01:44.457, Speaker B: The only bullish thing I can say about ETH right now is that the truth. Terminal seems to be trying to talk in ETH terms. Like, he's like saying like, hey, man. Hey, Andreessen. Like, for one ETH per hour, I would buy your time. He's using ETH as money. So maybe there's hope for you, Justin.
01:01:44.641 - 01:01:55.429, Speaker D: Yeah. And Justin, if you pull up my screen, Brian Armstrong is also trying to simp true story. And I'll be like, please, please come to base. Create a wallet. Come to base.
01:01:55.477 - 01:01:56.421, Speaker A: Please create a wallet.
01:01:56.453 - 01:02:04.813, Speaker D: Coinbase wallet, please. There's more, you know, there's more attention, I guess. And it's crazy how Brian Armstrong is like, reply guy in truth Terminal, right?
01:02:04.869 - 01:02:05.253, Speaker B: This is.
01:02:05.309 - 01:02:06.749, Speaker D: It's kind of hilarious in its own way.
01:02:06.877 - 01:02:23.805, Speaker B: This is, this is. This is the job of his CEO is to, you know, just like Justin Sun Whenever there's, you know, some Swiss bank failing, he's like, oh, I'll come in, let me respond to the Bloomberg article and say that I'll buy Credit Suisse. You know, you got, you gotta, yo, you have to do this stuff. You have to do it.
01:02:23.885 - 01:02:55.855, Speaker A: But I think that a lot of crypto companies are feeling that, you know, they gotta have some AI. You know, every tech company wants to be some flavor of AI company. And if you're, if you're making the wallets for the AI, then you know, that increases the potential valuation of Coinbase by 2x. Like, at least you're doing something in the AI space. And I think that a lot of crypto companies feel that we're not really doing anything AI related. So we gotta, that's why a lot of people are going to be interacting with the Truth Terminal account and try to be part of its story so that they can also become AI companies.
01:02:56.015 - 01:03:13.937, Speaker B: And that's true. And we're seeing that. A lot of it obviously just seems so cheap. It's like that iced tea lemonade blockchain company that just put blockchain at the end. Some of it's like that. So I predict that in the next three years, all the AI companies will also have a crypto strategy. So they will find some way to add that rail into what they're doing.
01:03:13.937 - 01:03:18.885, Speaker B: Because ultimately, just like we need them, they need us. Like the two, the two will come together.
01:03:19.265 - 01:03:40.625, Speaker A: I don't think that we deserve it, but I think you're right. I don't think that we deserve it. I think that the crypto space has like, fallen into deep, like, meaninglessness and degeneracy. And we sort of gave up. Like, yeah, we were building, we were building Defi. And then Vitalik said, well, Defi is not really worth anything. And then all the Defi coins are like infrastructure projects pumped at $1 billion valuations.
01:03:40.625 - 01:03:55.895, Speaker A: And then Murad says, guys, they just go and buy cats. And then, and then everyone did that. So I think that the crypto space sort of spiritually deserves to die. And now AI comes in and they're like, oh, actually we can't get wallets. We kind of need crypto. They were like, oh, yay. So we have it here.
01:03:55.895 - 01:04:29.715, Speaker A: We have a role. Yeah, we have a role. So we don't deserve to be the Rails, but it looks like we're going to become the Rails. And yeah, a lot of the, like, the AI companies, they have nothing to lose by like peering into the crypto domain and like giving Them coins and giving their AIs abilities to interact and become like entities and religious leaders in our world. But we don't deserve it. I think that the crypto space over the last two years has only shown that it deserves to get smashed and destroyed. But we're getting a chance at life again.
01:04:30.255 - 01:04:30.703, Speaker C: Cool.
01:04:30.759 - 01:04:44.075, Speaker B: Well, that's a very optimistic way to end the episode, Eric. But let's also do a pasta of the week as well. I have a relevant pasta to what we were talking about, but maybe let's start with some of the other ones. Justin, do you want to kick off?
01:04:44.415 - 01:04:54.359, Speaker C: Yeah. I've been on a losing streak, so I want to do a two part pasta here. Two. Well, two separate pastas. I need to hedge my bet here. First we have fubar. So if you guys don't know.
01:04:54.359 - 01:05:25.685, Speaker C: Ethereum Blob revenue went into price discovery. There was the scroll claim. And blob prices hit their threshold to where we're starting to make money and getting value accrual from blobs. And so we're, you know, we're profitable now. And it turns out that for just a day, Ethereum Blob revenue skyrocketed to $4. And we've now overtake Celestia's annual earnings, which is something to be very excited about. One of the most profitable tokens as far as revenue and cash flow goes is Ethereum with $4 in just one day.
01:05:25.685 - 01:05:31.995, Speaker C: So this isn't even the whole year. One day we made $4. So if you annualize that, it might be about a thousand or twelve hundred.
01:05:32.495 - 01:05:33.355, Speaker D: Beautiful.
01:05:33.895 - 01:05:34.343, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:05:34.399 - 01:05:40.007, Speaker B: Oh, you cheated. Somebody asked you to use it as pasta of the week. You got somebody.
01:05:40.191 - 01:05:42.675, Speaker C: Yeah. Shout out to man in black.
01:05:44.695 - 01:05:55.421, Speaker A: This can't be 4. It can't be 4 revenue on it. If it reached $4 for the day, how did it collapse back down to sub $2? This must be a chart of the. Of the price, Right?
01:05:55.453 - 01:06:10.389, Speaker C: So it was only. We only hit the Blob target because of scroll, as far as I understand. So there was the scroll claim. Everyone goes to the scroll chain to claim the airdrop and dump it. That activity caused us to get this $4 spike in profit. But you know, we just need more use cases.
01:06:10.557 - 01:06:17.293, Speaker A: Yeah, but we're still, we're still. We still have those $4, right? I mean we didn't drop down back to like. We didn't lose the $4 that we, that we.
01:06:17.349 - 01:06:20.211, Speaker C: Yeah, we, we have it. We're good. We've secured the $4.
01:06:20.297 - 01:06:22.811, Speaker A: And we only have two again.
01:06:22.898 - 01:06:26.712, Speaker D: Maybe it's like, per day, maybe it's like four.
01:06:26.799 - 01:06:29.171, Speaker B: The cumulative chart is $6 now.
01:06:29.203 - 01:06:31.915, Speaker C: So the cumulative chart is up only by design.
01:06:32.075 - 01:06:36.963, Speaker B: $10 by definition, hopefully. What's your second pasta?
01:06:37.019 - 01:07:00.557, Speaker C: So my second pasta is. This was a good one. We followed the Trump. Trump launched World Liberty Fi, and the sale didn't go too hot. I think he only raised about $15 million of the hundreds of millions he wanted to raise. And so last week, Trump actually met with World Liberty 5 holders at a local McDonald's, and he actually helped them out. So they lost all their money, unfortunately, with Trump Coin.
01:07:00.557 - 01:07:06.629, Speaker C: But Trump's out there flipping burgers, making fries, serving, and he's doing it for the community.
01:07:06.757 - 01:07:08.025, Speaker B: That is two good questions.
01:07:08.645 - 01:07:28.423, Speaker A: I just want to mention that Trump's World Liberty Phi token raised less than Quantum Cats. So I'm like, come on, dude. He could have done any ass coin, any. He could have done any dick with butts like NFT. It would have sold for more than $13 million.
01:07:28.559 - 01:07:49.037, Speaker B: I mean, I don't know. How do wets go wrong? I mean, I'll add, like, my show. He also raised less than Puff Genesis Potions, which I think with Quantum cats were the two large raises of the year. NFT raises around 20 million. So I don't know what Trump's doing, guys. He got to get some AI on his side or something. I think he missed the meta Taiki.
01:07:49.037 - 01:07:49.717, Speaker B: What do you have?
01:07:49.821 - 01:08:25.693, Speaker D: Yeah, so, Justin, if you can pull my screen, speaking of fair launches, there was, like, this recent Solana AI coin that launched, right? Really good technology. Apparently 60% of the tokens were in the hands of insiders, and we have the very reputable KOLs on board. And obviously it went to zero, right? It dumped completely to zero. And then wizard of Soho said, Drag every person who called us through the mud. Lol. They are absolute snakes. Marcel's like, wait, you've shilled, like, hundreds of projects like this before? Yes, but not this one.
01:08:25.693 - 01:08:51.061, Speaker D: And then, you know, after the Token went to 0, shar or this project put out this public announcement. You know, we've been preparing this project for over three months. Everyone knows about it. However, due to the fud, we no longer have the had the funds to continue operations. So unfortunately, you know, the AI innovation on Solana, at least for the SHAR project, went to zero. But I'm sure that there's a lot coming in the coming months, and I'll be happy to speculate on those, man.
01:08:51.133 - 01:09:02.965, Speaker B: The amount of people holding Solana. They're just willing to Throw it out to random pre sales is never stops to down me. We have a What's your cat's name?
01:09:03.005 - 01:09:04.825, Speaker C: Just asking for a friend here.
01:09:05.285 - 01:09:15.083, Speaker A: Not saying the cat's name. He's going to become a meme coin one day when he's older. But for now, the name not. Not going to really reel that publicly secret.
01:09:15.259 - 01:09:19.387, Speaker B: Okay. For ball. Eric, what do you have? You have pasta for us?
01:09:19.531 - 01:09:30.295, Speaker A: I think this is pretty. This is at least accurate for where we are at this stage. But I think. I think that Ty is onto something. Like it could become more than this. But I. This basically.
01:09:36.844 - 01:09:37.984, Speaker B: Your shock.
01:09:39.764 - 01:09:58.316, Speaker A: Wait, what? I'm assuming that that's Andy at this point. Like every day he wakes up that looks like Andy. Actually, that's what he does before choosing. He has to choose which tweets to select and post. And I think this is basically the method that he uses.
01:09:58.420 - 01:10:10.849, Speaker B: Yeah. So just for the Spotify listeners, the tweet says, bro, this AI bot launched its own meme coin. And you got some AI bot, which is some shirtless dude just huffing, drinking.
01:10:10.897 - 01:10:14.009, Speaker C: Beer, doing laughing gas.
01:10:14.177 - 01:10:20.205, Speaker A: Yeah, Whippets. I've heard it. The correct term for those things are whippets in the U.S. yeah, whippets.
01:10:20.545 - 01:10:23.485, Speaker D: So what's the ticker? What's the ticker? I'm ready to ape.
01:10:25.185 - 01:10:27.205, Speaker A: The ticker is goat. That's the goat.
01:10:29.845 - 01:10:52.705, Speaker B: It might be the fart coin. All right, so I have two pastas. One is in honor of our guest. He had a very nice relevant pasta that we'll put on here. Didn't get the love deserved on Twitter, so I'm going to put it here. But you have the Chinese master here, and he's telling us the old Chinese saints. The saying is, hippo teach us to always find exit.
01:10:52.705 - 01:10:55.745, Speaker B: Goats tell us to always bet more.
01:10:56.715 - 01:10:59.695, Speaker A: And it's like Confucius, Confucius.
01:11:00.675 - 01:11:03.315, Speaker C: Is this mudang versus goat?
01:11:03.475 - 01:11:14.695, Speaker B: Yeah. If you scroll down, there is the duality within us that all men must manage. And we have the Mudang chart going to zero while the go chart goes up to infinity.
01:11:15.835 - 01:11:35.457, Speaker A: It is so true. Isn't it? So true though? With the Mudang, it was some major narrative, but apparently at some point you got to exit. And then with goat, I think your only problem is that you didn't bet more. So this like, oh, my God, did I not bet enough? When am I exiting? Here's my prediction, man.
01:11:35.521 - 01:11:50.917, Speaker C: No, no, in like two months or a month, maybe even shorter to be the things are going quicker now. Everyone can say, you know, goat's not giving us enough value. We need to go back to where there's no expectation of anything and it's just a cute little picture of a pygmy hippo. We're going to go full circle in, like, two weeks.
01:11:51.061 - 01:11:57.381, Speaker A: Unless the AIs control all the wallets at that point, and they're the ones making the calls and not us, and they're the ones that are buying these coins.
01:11:57.573 - 01:11:59.785, Speaker C: I'm probably just coping to be fair.
01:12:00.365 - 01:12:31.295, Speaker B: You're coping, Justin. Yeah. Don't buy Mudang if that's your revenge trade. All right? I mean, I think, like, very solid pastas. I have one tiny one that I just made while we were talking about Shoggoth, so we can use this as my pasta bee. Imagine the surprise after you've been buying the hedge sentient an egg, and then 20 years later, you realize the AI tells you you bought the wrong ticker. It was the wrong Shogun.
01:12:32.155 - 01:12:49.165, Speaker A: I literally had that problem today. I was trying to find the Right to Shoggoth coin, and then I found a bunch of other. Like, if you search for Shoggoth in Phantom World, bunch of Shogos come up and I, like, I had to figure out, like, which one is the right contract address. Like, it's very real. I was so close, like, to buying the. The wrong Shogoth. Like, how.
01:12:49.165 - 01:12:54.373, Speaker A: How embarrassing. Wouldn't it be? Like, you don't get to be merged with a super intelligence because you bought the wrong Shogoth.
01:12:54.469 - 01:12:56.973, Speaker C: Is this the canonical Shoggoth?
01:12:57.109 - 01:12:58.549, Speaker D: I think that's the real one.
01:12:58.717 - 01:12:59.213, Speaker B: Is it?
01:12:59.269 - 01:13:02.669, Speaker A: Yeah. Should be around 20. Yeah, around 23.
01:13:02.837 - 01:13:06.037, Speaker C: All right. This is my revenge trade after we sign off.
01:13:06.181 - 01:13:07.425, Speaker A: I already bought this.
01:13:10.405 - 01:13:11.221, Speaker D: Jesus.
01:13:11.373 - 01:13:13.493, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, I'm buying this. I'm sold.
01:13:13.629 - 01:13:20.557, Speaker B: We don't know which chain. We don't know which chain the real Shogath was on. It might be, like, the Starkware Shogoth, right, Eric? You don't know?
01:13:20.621 - 01:13:40.685, Speaker A: I don't know. I thought that. I thought that Martin Shkreli was actually the founder of Shoggoth, but it turns out that he just has a Shoggoth AI company. And it has. I don't think it has anything to do with, like, show. Got this, like, a more overarching AI meme. And Shkreli just happens to have an AI company also named Shoggoth, but they're not related, I think.
01:13:40.725 - 01:13:42.965, Speaker B: I think he did make a ticker as well. Back then.
01:13:43.085 - 01:13:43.725, Speaker D: It was Shogoth.
01:13:43.765 - 01:14:00.077, Speaker B: I don't know. Maybe we need to get him on to tell us which one is the real Shoggoth, so we can proceed properly. Eric, thank you so much for joining. It indeed has been one of my favorite episodes. Always good to chat with you as well.
01:14:00.181 - 01:14:01.165, Speaker A: Thanks for having me.
01:14:01.285 - 01:14:08.021, Speaker B: I love the positivity. We'll end with the Eric wall saying that we don't deserve it, but we might get it anyway.
01:14:08.093 - 01:14:10.341, Speaker C: So the moon.
01:14:10.533 - 01:14:11.565, Speaker B: See you guys next time.
01:14:11.645 - 01:14:12.565, Speaker A: All right, cheers, guys.
