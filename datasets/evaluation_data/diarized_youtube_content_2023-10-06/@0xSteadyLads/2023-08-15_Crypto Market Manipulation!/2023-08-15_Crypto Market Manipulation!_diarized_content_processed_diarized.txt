00:00:00.080 - 00:00:27.014, Speaker A: You know, this week I think we saw one of the most brazen acts of market manipulation. There was a listing on binance of ygg perpetual futures. This led to a ramp up of five or six x from the listing price a few days ago. And then one of the most quick and sudden and ruthless collapses I've witnessed of a major coin. I mean, it was capturing more than 10% of the global volume on this day.
00:00:27.094 - 00:00:29.606, Speaker B: Why are these people doing it? What's the motive here?
00:00:29.630 - 00:00:31.086, Speaker A: It's plain and simple. It's Wild west.
00:00:31.190 - 00:00:35.446, Speaker B: This guy's, like, very notorious for mark manipulation and pump and dumping coins.
00:00:35.550 - 00:00:46.342, Speaker A: I was surprised. This Grachev guy, there's a meme already going around in trading circles. But he's trying to be a main character. He has main character vibes all about him. He only has, like 5000 followers right now. But you.
00:00:46.358 - 00:00:54.686, Speaker B: Think the end game is he can just tweet, like, at some point he doesn't even have to, like, actually move the market himself, that he can just tweet it and the market will move in the way he wants.
00:00:54.710 - 00:00:56.414, Speaker A: It to, potentially, you know.
