00:00:20.760 - 00:00:53.942, Speaker A: Welcome to another episode of Steady Lads. I'm Jordy, the CIO of Selena Capital. We have today with a special guest, but let's kick off with a quick intro to Justin, the CEO of Astaria. We have Taiki, the humble farmer who has recently been a RWa DJ. And we have Austin Federa, who has graciously come to discuss all kinds of interesting topics around not just Solana, but, you know, the broader economic systems of what, you know, crypto is building. So welcome, Austin.
00:00:54.098 - 00:00:55.366, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:55.550 - 00:01:53.100, Speaker A: I guess, to preface, there's been some Twitter background here, and it's kind of what got your attention and managed to get you on here. So that's good. I think we can maybe put up a little back and forth that we've been having mainly around this concept of a token being like, a monetary product and not being as like, a stock, in essence, like a discounted cash flow. This is something that, for how much money? Depends on the right answer to this question. There is, like, nowhere near enough discussion or understanding of this topic. And so recently, I kind of put forward some points around ethically, around distribution for monetary premium products. And I'm fascinated with some of your responses around.
00:01:53.100 - 00:02:10.700, Speaker A: You actually don't think none of the cryptos, not just Sol, are money, but we'll get into that, and I think it's going to make a fascinating episode. But maybe just for context, first of all, you can kind of tell us, like, what is your role with Solana and kind of like, how long you've been doing that.
00:02:10.892 - 00:02:37.206, Speaker B: Yeah. So I currently work for the Solana foundation, where I'm the head of strategy. I joined the Solana ecosystem in January of 2021. Before that, I was with Bison trails up until their acquisition by Coinbase. And I initially joined Solana Labs, kind of working on product and product marketing and sort of had a bit of a chief of staff role at Solana Labs. And then in spring of 2022, I moved over to the Solana foundation side of things.
00:02:37.390 - 00:03:09.224, Speaker A: Nice. So you've seen all kinds of different sides of what's going on, and I'm sure things changed at the beginning, SPF was like a cheerleader. I know he was not as involved later on when things were actually getting built. But there was the infamous sell me all your solid $3 tweet, which I have to admit, that was probably when I first bought salama. I don't know about Justin or Taiki, but I'm like, well, this guy's backstopping it at $3. I bought it at dollar two. This seems like a good trade.
00:03:09.224 - 00:03:11.824, Speaker A: Did you guys buy in at that time?
00:03:12.204 - 00:03:48.954, Speaker C: I actually didn't. I was on the sidelines, kind of an EVM maxi at the time, and I think EVM still has significant modes. And one question I had for Austin is recently I was looking into the Solana ecosystem. I got on a call with the Hubble team. They're building Hubble, like USDH, Camino Finance and whatnot. And I posed a question of like, why are all these tokens so illiquid? Because at least on EVM, there are, you know, market makers, whether it be retail or institutional. But for Solana coins, the liquidity is under a million for most of them.
00:03:48.954 - 00:03:57.302, Speaker C: Do you think, are there systemic, or are there structural reasons for that? Because it makes it really hard for me to participate in the Solana ecosystem.
00:03:57.438 - 00:05:02.664, Speaker B: I think there are. And the most basic answer is the average Ethereum user is much richer than the average Solana user. The token has had a much longer time to appreciate. There's been a lot of people who got in at Ethereum when it was $80 and it's 2000 today. And so there's just more free flowing cash in the Ethereum ecosystem than there is in the Solana ecosystem. And I think it's like, it's important to recognize that no one is an LP in uniswap for basically any good reason, right? There's no economic incentive to participate in those pools besides your a 16 z, and you hold a bunch of uni tokens and you want to make sure their market share is maintained. There's a lot of systemic relationships that you see on Ethereum that are great, and it's not to knock any of that stuff, but I think what you've seen is that on Solana, that part of the ecosystem is still maturing because the firms that have high conviction on Sol, some of them are regulatorily boxed out from market making and those sorts of things.
00:05:02.664 - 00:05:52.344, Speaker B: And then I think, you know, very reasonably, a lot of people who were not deep in the Solana ecosystem felt some insecurity and some doubt about whether Solana was going to make it through the collapse of FTX. And I don't fault anyone for that. I think what happened with the collapse of FTX and sort of the perception that they were really closely involved with the Solana ecosystem would have killed almost any other blockchain out there. I think it's like ethereum and bitcoin are probably the only two that could have gotten through something like that. So I don't fault people for being a little gun shy of the ecosystem. What we've seen over just the last few months is folks who have not been paying attention to the Solana ecosystem are starting to pay attention to the Solana ecosystem again. And it's really awesome to see, but I think we'll probably see institutional capital follow a lot of that excitement and attention.
00:05:52.344 - 00:06:20.944, Speaker B: But I agree with you, it's a problem today in the Solana ecosystem that especially some of the smaller market cap tokens, especially some of the sort of very Solana native projects, there is not as much liquidity available. Now, what I will say is that things like Jupiter aggregator are incredibly capital efficient. They're about seven to ten times more capital efficient than Defi and other chains, which means they can handle a lot more small orders. But obviously, if you're talking about big orders, liquidity is liquidity.
00:06:21.244 - 00:06:29.144, Speaker A: Justin, how about you? When did you first start looking at the Solana ecosystem, or at least be curious and, and then investigate it?
00:06:29.524 - 00:06:49.704, Speaker D: Yeah, a lot, a lot of people don't know this about me, but I'm a very big Solana fan, actually. So I've got my Solana phone right here. It's not my, my daily phone, that's an iPhone. But I'm. I love Solana because they're willing to try stuff like that. I mean, I think that's just absolutely brilliant to build like a seed vault. Seed vault into your phone to secure your private key.
00:06:49.704 - 00:07:15.066, Speaker D: And I think more projects should be trying these, like, big, bold experiments, which I, I absolutely love. Sadly though, I've always sort of left or mid curved it, and I've never owned a considerable amount of Solana. And so I'm certainly coping now as it's done so well. So congrats to the community there. But no, I sort of missed out. I missed the $2 call. Jordy, you didn't text me to buy Solana at $2 before SPF's tweet, so I missed that.
00:07:15.210 - 00:07:18.134, Speaker B: And then you almost had another opportunity.
00:07:19.354 - 00:07:23.574, Speaker D: I just keep fumbling the bag, I guess. Yeah, you know, it was a scary time.
00:07:25.734 - 00:07:54.260, Speaker A: I will admit that I was relatively new to crypto at the time when this whole FTX thing was happening, and the person who alerted me to buy Solana will surprise people. It was actually Suzu. He was just like, hey, this SPF guy, he's gonna backstop this. Like, you should just go, max long. So good trademark. I got in at $2. I put in what I thought was like, you know, a good chunk.
00:07:54.260 - 00:08:05.684, Speaker A: I put in like a six figure amount. And I sold it at $6. You know, I was. I was a trapfly guy. I thought like a three x. I thought like, three x is, like, incredible. I'm like, wow.
00:08:05.684 - 00:08:29.796, Speaker A: Made hundreds of thousands of dollars on this, and I didn't even have to do anything. And it moved in, like, so fast. It was like. It was like, within like a month or something, right? Like, it kind of exploded after that. Because from a trader standpoint, from a risk reward, it's all about risk reward. When you're putting a trade on once the risk is. You could say that maybe SPF wasn't fully legitimate now that we know.
00:08:29.796 - 00:08:55.074, Speaker A: But at the time, he looked like, to be this high flying billionaire. And if he's saying, I'm backstopping at dollar three, then the price discovery has to happen above it. Once that sets in, it's just such a great trade because it's almost on the upside. It's asymmetric. So that was my first foray. I watched it skyrocket from six to 50 over the next months, boom. With the hell out of it, because I was quite a big fan at the time.
00:08:55.074 - 00:09:21.994, Speaker A: And then there was a dip to dollar 20. It went from 50 to 20. So this was probably going to be sometime in 21. Sorry. Yeah, mid 21, maybe. And so I'll admit, like, the most money I've made in my life, I think it's kind of close between, like, a very large treasury, kind of macro trade I'd done at some point. And I bought a huge chunk of Solana at $20.
00:09:21.994 - 00:09:38.016, Speaker A: I wrote it up all the way. I mean, I went to breakpoint in 21 with a big bag. I didn't sell any. I had staked it. It ended up becoming, like, half of my net worth or something. It was like a ridiculous bag. I thought.
00:09:38.016 - 00:10:10.818, Speaker A: I'm like, hot shit. You know, I show up. I own, like, you know, many, many bits of, like, the total supply going around. And I just remember this one moment being in a car going to like, this, like they're having these crazy parties, you know, Delphi. And like, everybody was like, you know, blinging out and mansions. And somebody brought up on Twitter there was this chamath thing where he's talking about how, you know, he's gotten billions of it makes my bag selling look very small at a discount. And he's like, oh, I'm holding it ish.
00:10:10.818 - 00:10:37.374, Speaker A: And then they're all kind of, like, laughing all these, like, David, you know, this is your crew, Justin, you know, the link crew is kind of like. And I would say that that kind of lit a light bulb in my head, and I'm like, oh, shit. Like, this is. This is a bit of a three three going on here. And that morning, once I slept on it, I sold everything. And it was a huge trade. It made a lot of difference to my.
00:10:37.374 - 00:11:07.508, Speaker A: So I'm not like, first of all, I like Solana. I'm not bitter in any way. It's done very well for me. But that moment is something I want to discuss with you, Austin, because it kind of brought this forefront of distribution and the potential for certain players to have a lot of power over a community. So any thoughts on, as a preamble?
00:11:07.636 - 00:11:35.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm not really sure that Ethereum is immune from that same sort of thing. Right. There's a lot of folks who are early in the Ethereum ICO days who sold at the top in 2021 or sold at the top in 2018. Right? These exact same market cycles are sort of all wrapped up in this. And, you know, Joe Lubin, like, has sold a lot over the years. Right. I don't think we should necessarily view selling as a problem.
00:11:35.730 - 00:11:51.994, Speaker B: Right. That is a basic dynamic of a healthy market. I think it's also pretty crazy to say something like, chamath crashed the entire crypto market by selling some of his soul. Right. I think that is, like, also a statement that is not really one you could. You could really back up.
00:11:52.574 - 00:12:09.126, Speaker A: But, oh, I don't think he sold. I think. I think he, like, round tripped it. But the fact that he was, like, threatening to do it, the fact that he potentially had. That had that power is not something that I'm comfortable with somebody having over a community. Like, look, like if there's. If there's a cash flow, it's different because, yeah, sell it.
00:12:09.126 - 00:12:39.652, Speaker A: Somebody buy it. Like, you're getting the, like someone's going to exchange the cash flows. But if there's no cash flow, you know, or the cash flows in 20 years, or, you know, I mean, I do want to ask you, like, you know, how far out you think a potential profitable cash flow could come. But at that point, like you said in your tweet there, monetary crypto is sort of a meme. Yes, very much so. Right? So do you think bitcoin is nowhere near being sort of like a money or. What's your take on?
00:12:39.828 - 00:13:28.098, Speaker B: So let's start with the Ethereum is money crowd, because I get, anthropologically why that came up. Right. This is at a time when everyone's like, ether is not a security, it's something. And there weren't enough lawyers in the room to say the word commodity, and instead, the community just sort of settled on this term money. Right? You'd see everyone from a kasib at Dragonfly to, you know, everyone else sort of repeat this idea that ETH is money. Well, how much stuff have you actually bought with ethanol? What percentage of VC's investing in the Ethereum community distribute ETH versus USD? Right? The idea that ETH is money is, like, very tenuous at best, because a. It fluctuates by 70% in a year.
00:13:28.098 - 00:13:40.220, Speaker B: That is not a good characteristic of money. That is not a stable long term asset. Bitcoin is the same problem. Solana has the same problem. Tesla stock has the same problem. Netflix stock has the same problem. Right.
00:13:40.220 - 00:14:19.658, Speaker B: There's all of these different types of systems out there where if you look at them, they actually have very few characteristics of what money has. I think it's even tenuous to say gold is a money, right? I don't think we would look at gold in the existing, totally off blockchain world and say gold's money. We'd say gold is an intrinsic store of long term value that is widely accepted by many people in many jurisdictions all around the world. So is oil. Right? So are oil futures. There's lots of different systems out there that have durable value and high redemption across multiple jurisdictions. That is not a definition of money, though.
00:14:19.746 - 00:14:32.346, Speaker A: So I am a bit surprised to hear you say that gold is not money, because I would say that in most traditional circles, it's kind of considered base money in a form of diamonds.
00:14:32.370 - 00:14:35.234, Speaker B: Money is oil money.
00:14:35.974 - 00:14:54.950, Speaker A: So oil has, like, the potential to back money, I would say. I think no doubt there's that potential, but it's not something that you can give somebody. I can't give you oil, right? Like, I'm not going to carry it around, but I could give you a gold coin. And that's kind of what people have done for thousands of years, but that's.
00:14:54.982 - 00:15:00.424, Speaker B: Only because of the weight of gold versus oil. Right? Like, are diamonds money, then?
00:15:02.524 - 00:15:03.076, Speaker A: Not.
00:15:03.180 - 00:15:41.134, Speaker B: Does money have to be something you can put in a bag and physically hand to someone? In that case, you know, what I mean is a lot of these things, if you actually push them to what it means for something to be money, there's a few characteristics of it. I think we could probably say some form of global redemption and global acceptance across multiple jurisdictions falls into that category, and then some form of stable or at least durable value. Right. And that's where gold has done historically well. It doesn't go up much, doesn't go down much. It's roughly stable throughout the last, let's call it 200 years.
00:15:41.874 - 00:15:45.534, Speaker A: Yeah. What is your statement that gold is not money? Based on.
00:15:47.474 - 00:16:01.094, Speaker B: That, it's not used to buy anything. It's not used as a form of currency. No one buys anything in gold. Right. Well, even the libertarians who have bunkers don't buy it in gold. That's a durable store of value. Right.
00:16:01.094 - 00:16:22.234, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, like, maybe we're talking about since Bretton woods, it's no longer money. Right. I think, obviously, beforehand, when you had most currencies in the world based on a gold reserve, that was a one to one backed system. Sure, gold at that point is money, but we live in a world where gold is no longer money. It's just a incredibly durable commodity that's also highly liquid.
00:16:23.134 - 00:16:39.750, Speaker A: So your thesis is that money, in essence, is something that you're kind of not looking at the store value so much, you're looking at the means of transaction out of those three famous, infamous categories of money. Yeah.
00:16:39.782 - 00:16:43.434, Speaker B: So here's. I guess what I might say is, is the US dollar money.
00:16:45.274 - 00:16:47.330, Speaker A: I would say. I would say it is.
00:16:47.522 - 00:16:57.002, Speaker B: So stamps are also money then, right. Stamps are legal tender in the United States that all banks and all merchants technically have to accept?
00:16:57.178 - 00:17:02.010, Speaker A: I would say it probably is, yeah. I don't know if it's good money, but it's a form of money. Yeah.
00:17:02.122 - 00:17:03.734, Speaker B: But then our treasury's money.
00:17:05.434 - 00:17:08.018, Speaker A: Treasury bonds. US treasury bonds of the government.
00:17:08.186 - 00:17:08.934, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:10.923 - 00:17:22.323, Speaker A: You know, I kind of see it as, like, staked ETH versus ETH. It's like, is staked ETH. ETH. You know, you can make it into ETH. So it's adjacent. It's money adjacent, yes.
00:17:22.403 - 00:17:54.644, Speaker B: And this is kind of my argument is that, like, it's very hard to actually have an honest definition of money. That includes ethereum, bitcoin, solana, any cryptocurrency. I think you can call them money adjacent. You can see, like, how close is it to this thing being accepted as money? And bitcoin's probably the closest. And in some countries, like, this is the thing that gets complicated here. In some jurisdictions, I think bitcoin is functionally money. Right.
00:17:54.644 - 00:18:34.394, Speaker B: If you look at Venezuela, if you look at Turkey, if you look at Ukraine before the invasion war there, those were areas where there wasn't much belief and stability in the local currency. And so if you bought bitcoin when it was $70,000 you're still massively up compared to the local currency in Venezuela or Turkey because those countries have such high inflation. But that's what I mean, be like. The usage of money is very important to the definition of money. If something is not commonly accepted as tender within an economy, it is not money. Right? It is something else. You could make an argument that cigarettes in a prison are money, right?
00:18:34.474 - 00:19:02.886, Speaker A: Yeah. You kind of, you do highlight effectively that the term money is used by different people in different ways and can mean different things and does not have enough clean definition. So let's avoid, you know, getting into the definitional game. Ultimately, we kind of see that there's. There's two forms of things, right? One is what you've described as transacting right away. I want to buy something right now. What am I using to give somebody that thing is kind of like one way look at money.
00:19:02.886 - 00:20:08.788, Speaker A: The thing that I care about more ethically, philosophically, is like, what is the long term sort of value? What am I kind of working today so that, like, in 30 years, my kids can go to college and use the work that I did back then, sort of like as a store of work. And this is something that is important from an ethical standpoint because this is where all the theft happens, right? Like, you have a fiat currency, and then they, you know, the president of Turkey builds himself some billion dollar mansions and, like, you just get hyperinflation and then your kids are not going to college. They're going to, like, you know, McDonald's. So this is kind of like a form of money, right? And when it comes to monetary premium, presumably this is kind of maybe where, like, the crust of a disagreement comes in, you might think that monetary premium is because of the transactional nature of, like, being able to freely, quickly transact in something. And maybe I see that the monetary premium is more people assuming that over many years this will hold value.
00:20:08.956 - 00:20:51.554, Speaker B: Yeah, but, like, holding value over a long period of time is not a definition of money. Like, I could show you a lot of New York real estate that holds value extremely well over a long period of time and actually increases in value. And I could argue that a lot of these apartments, even in the depths of COVID were trading because there was so much demand for certain kinds of them. I think you could talk about, like, a van Gogh probably falls into that same category, right? There are classes of things in this world that whether it's because russian oligarchs really want them and they see it as a good store of value or whatever the function of it is, they have the characteristics you're talking about, but we don't call them money.
00:20:53.094 - 00:21:36.412, Speaker C: If I can hijack the conversation a little bit here, do you think the crypto community, I mean, most of the crypto community, they hold bitcoin ether. And there's a tribalistic nature where the Ethereum community eventually wants to flip bitcoin because they think it's better. And, Justin, I put a link to a tweet here by Buffalo, who I think is the founder of Jito. Do you think there's an obsession within the crypto community around monetary premium trying to be money? Do you think Solana is trying to be a different type of a new asset? Are you trying to create a new paradigm? You're the head of strategy at Solana. What is the strategy around value accrual for the sole asset?
00:21:36.548 - 00:22:08.174, Speaker B: So what I would say is that it makes a lot of sense for people who hold a lot of a specific asset to advocate for that asset to go up in value. And I don't know if that's moneyness, but that is effectively what we're talking about here. There's a groupthink in a lot of crypto communities that has decided X or Y or Z will make this thing implicitly more valuable in the long term, which I also want to say it's very much not what money is. You don't hold money expecting it to go up in value.
00:22:08.474 - 00:22:13.266, Speaker A: Let's get away from the definitional stuff, because maybe that is money for something. You can go to the dictionary.
00:22:13.370 - 00:22:25.374, Speaker B: No economist defines money that way. This is what I mean by that. Crypto's invented a bunch of ways of talking about stuff that don't actually reflect what these words mean to economists.
00:22:25.914 - 00:23:07.848, Speaker A: Yeah. First of all, I would not respect many economists, being an economist myself. It's not, you know, the, I kind of look at the. The more practical rather than academic standpoint. Ultimately, you know, you can think from first principles, and monetary concept is a social concept. It doesn't have anything to do with, you know, what the weight is or, you know, you can put it in a bag or whatever, even, like, how much there is. Ultimately, it's an agreement between society that this is how we are counting the beans in terms of, you know, who can get who to do what.
00:23:07.848 - 00:23:36.410, Speaker A: And I bring up this, like, heavy word of, like, slavery sometimes, because that's the same as slavery. Like, if you can tell somebody what to do, whether because you're, you know, they're starving, and the only way they can get food is if you give them what society agrees as money, and then that's how they survive. Or because, like, you know, you're doing it by force. It's sort of the same thing in the sense, like, yes, they're forced to do something that the person with the power says that they need to do. Right, so I agree with you on that.
00:23:36.482 - 00:23:36.922, Speaker B: Yes.
00:23:37.018 - 00:24:12.986, Speaker A: Okay, great. So if for hundreds, thousands of years, gold was that kind of role in society where pirates would, you know, go to a ship and take the gold, and then nobody would deny them the ability to use that gold to buy stuff, because that was the socially accepted currency. Right. Now, you could say the US dollar is obviously one of those. And bitcoin is trying to create enough of a global acceptance as a macro asset and ultimately a sort of form.
00:24:13.010 - 00:24:14.594, Speaker C: Of gold, digital gold.
00:24:14.674 - 00:24:27.584, Speaker A: That's obviously the meme. It's a little bit difficult if you don't consider gold to be money, to then consider bitcoin to be money. Because I think it's even more of a stretch than gold is, because from a society standpoint, this is very new. Right?
00:24:28.124 - 00:24:33.676, Speaker B: Yeah. And to be clear, I think gold's closer to being money than bitcoin or ether is.
00:24:33.860 - 00:24:34.556, Speaker A: Yes.
00:24:34.700 - 00:25:01.914, Speaker B: But again, this is like, we can move past the definitions here, but I think it's really important to know that money has to be accepted. Money has to be transacted as something other than a commodity. The modern version of this is pirates seize a container ship and they sell off the assets of it. That doesn't suddenly make what's on a container ship gold any more than the pirates stealing gold does. It just means it's a highly liquid thing. Right?
00:25:02.414 - 00:25:32.496, Speaker D: Don't you guys think this sort of debating the definition of money is some sort of obfuscation of the question behind the question? Because I think the real question here is we have a thesis for why bitcoin has value, why Ethereum has value. Those theses could be correct, they could be wrong. We can talk about that later. But we're here to talk about Solana. So if we don't think Solana's money, like, what, what are we, what, what's, what are. What are you buying? Where's the value coming from? Why is Solana, why should it be worth a dollar, a penny, a $100, etcetera?
00:25:32.600 - 00:25:32.872, Speaker A: Totally.
00:25:32.888 - 00:25:34.800, Speaker D: If you can share your thoughts on that a bit.
00:25:34.912 - 00:25:35.224, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:35.264 - 00:26:36.546, Speaker B: So I think the best way to think of Solana is similar to SaaS. In the early days of SaaS, the profit margins were astronomically lower. Than what Oracle was making or IBM was making or any of those companies at the time. But the tam for SaaS was 1000 times larger than what Oracle could ever hope to sell with their $20 million a year contracts. Solana is a long term bet that blockchain technology is going to underpin a lot more of the Internet and of our daily lives and of our financial world than we do today. And if that's the case, if you start to get a world where you have 20 million people transacting on Solana every day, these economics that look like there may be a problem today look very different when you have a huge amount of daily active transactions and daily active users. And the flip side of that, I would say, is that if you look at what's happened with Ethereum, it's economically unusable today with a infinitesimally small user base.
00:26:36.546 - 00:27:04.780, Speaker B: The optimization to go for deflationary fee based systems this early in the adoption cycle, I think is potentially a problem that the Ethereum community has to work through around long term. If we're not increasing the data availability layer, how are we actually going to make sure that this stuff is usable? Because l two s are already in the dollar to several dollar gas fees during periods of high usage, right?
00:27:04.812 - 00:27:55.646, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know if that's a fair argument because the type of use cases that potentially, you know, Ethereum and that secure settlement layer is maybe going after, like you said, the average user, maybe it's richer or maybe it's just the same users, but they're using Ethereum for, you know, securing high value, you know, dollars and using DeFi protocols. And maybe Solana is for, you know, coordinating a global Wi Fi distribution system or, you know, the kind of stuff that we've seen tried on this like very low fee setup. It's not to say that it's unusable or whatever because maybe, you know, I only need to do like two transactions a week and that's still enough gas if everybody's doing it. But it's just different use case, right?
00:27:55.790 - 00:28:23.658, Speaker B: But on a global level, what we see just historically rolling back the clock on any piece of technology is lower fees and higher scalability gets adoption. And this is not to say that wire transfers are not used anymore. This is not to say that Oracle has gone out of business. Oracle is still a company that exists. They still have a stock that's performed pretty well. AWS has eaten their lunch. And this is not to say this is going to happen here here too.
00:28:23.658 - 00:28:58.030, Speaker B: But, you know, you can see things like Venmo or quite frankly, blockchain are really reducing wire transfers except in a certain type of setting. Even Western Union, right, and MoneyGram and these folks have totally changed the wind transfer wise have changed how international transfers occur. Blockchain is also that level of disruption to these systems. And so this is not to say there isn't a great future for Ethereum. I think there is. I think it's very hard to look at a lot of the world's population and say, oh, Ethereum is going to be a usable platform for folks here. But who knows, it might be right.
00:28:58.030 - 00:29:07.314, Speaker B: There's a lot of work that could be done to change this sort of drive for monetary focused value accrual into a drive for usability on the network.
00:29:07.614 - 00:29:39.666, Speaker D: Can I ask a question on that? If, let's say in five years, we're in this hypothetical future where the tech has really developed, well, let's just say in the Ethereum ecosystem and some l two or some scaling solution, maybe we haven't thought of it, maybe it is a key. ZK gets us to the point where transaction fees are negligible or almost at the cost of Solana. Is there still a need for a Solana in that case or not? And I guess if the answer is no, are you sort of bearish that Ethereum could get to this level of scaling needed to match Solana?
00:29:39.770 - 00:30:07.034, Speaker B: So Ethereum had this on the roadmap, right? I worked in the Ethereum ecosystem in 2020 and 2019 when they were talking about ETH two as being a scaling endeavor as opposed to something else, and it became something else. The idea now is we're going to keep Ethereum at the same amount of capacity it had before. We're going to add a bunch of L2s and layer threes and layer 47s on top of that, and we're going to create a really long nested.
00:30:07.074 - 00:30:08.010, Speaker D: Bit of a stretch.
00:30:08.162 - 00:30:56.484, Speaker B: Well, it's not, if you follow the way people talk about this, l two s are at most today 75 transactions per second. If you really want to get up to really high transaction counts that are capable of supporting something like the stock exchange or Twitter or something like that, you're going to need a huge number of layers involved in that system unless you radically scale the base layer. This isn't to say that Ethereum couldn't do it, but culturally, today, the folks who are in decision making authority in the Ethereum community, and that's not to say it's centralized, there's many folks involved in making these decisions, but their focus is on driving value, which is not something I'm going to condemn them for. But I think it's at odds with the idea that we're going to scale this to be a global platform.
00:30:57.064 - 00:31:33.920, Speaker A: I think both me and Justin agree with that take, actually, if anyone, I think our listeners have watched our recent episodes. We have. We had a little Batman with the Buddha belly, and we're talking about how Ethereum is trying to be money and also trying to be usable. And those two things are clashing. And I've spoken at this at length before, and I fully agree with the fact that there's a bit of an identity issue right now. And I think JMO had some good points about that as well. But I will counteract a lot of the other things you said, because you're starting to sound like this thesis of crystics and a 16 z last cycle where, you know, blocks.
00:31:33.920 - 00:31:48.488, Speaker A: There's not enough block space. There's not enough block space. It's the most biggest commodity. We need more block space. And now we have like, shit ton of block space. You know, like, no one's using it. I think the use cases of all this block space are not fleshed out.
00:31:48.488 - 00:31:55.080, Speaker A: And even hearing anatoly talk about it, he's like, maybe in a lot of years we'll see, like, some use cases.
00:31:55.272 - 00:32:08.600, Speaker B: So even if you strip out votes on Solana, right, you just look at user transactions on the network. That steady state of transactions is more than all l two s combined and the Ethereum mainnet per second.
00:32:08.752 - 00:32:11.444, Speaker A: But that's not an intellectually honest.
00:32:12.264 - 00:32:14.040, Speaker B: Oh, it's not an intellectually honest argument.
00:32:14.072 - 00:32:25.432, Speaker A: Because I can say, yeah, I'm willing to spend $10 on Solana, and I'm willing to spend $100 on gas on Ethereum. And if I'm willing to spend $10, yeah, I'll just spam if I'm a bot.
00:32:25.488 - 00:32:27.636, Speaker B: But no one's just spamming, right?
00:32:27.700 - 00:32:48.064, Speaker A: Like, look at it this way. Like, if it's like, there's mev to pick up, that's worth $100, and I'm willing to spend $90 to pick it up, and this is potentially true for any chain, that $90 as a number of transactions could be like quadrillion transactions, and then you're like, look, we're getting quadrillion transactions. It doesn't necessarily, like, reflect on anything. Right?
00:32:48.684 - 00:33:06.480, Speaker B: I actually would not agree with that. I think if you actually look at the mev opportunities on Solana, they're more than they are on Ethereum. Because of the gas fees on Ethereum today. But I think the actual problem we're getting at is everyone prefers to transact on the ethereum l one than transacting on an l two.
00:33:06.672 - 00:33:33.132, Speaker A: My point, just to make it clear. So let's say when Cl was trying to go to fronttech and kind of edge, edge the bots there on Friendtech, we had the biggest number of transactions. It was I guess on base, just like a huge number of transactions. And somebody could say like, look, adoption, like base is getting more than all the other l two s combined. And it's because it's cheap and like there's like an mev opportunity, it's not really reflecting.
00:33:33.228 - 00:34:27.886, Speaker B: Okay, sorry, I wasn't making, I wasn't making a user base argument. What I was saying is when you get like a core thesis of technology, which is true back to the 1940s when we first started building computers, is every time you make something cheaper by an order of magnitude, you get an entirely new class of entrepreneur building on that system and building totally different types of applications than you ever would have seen before. Right? And so this is not to say that Aslana is going to steal all the existing use cases for Ethereum. I think that's not at all we've seen. And what we actually see in our developer numbers is most developers on Solana did not start on Ethereum, right? They chose Solana as the first network they're building on. Or maybe they were part of the bitcoin community early on, but they are not coming from Ethereum. There's this idea that there's this big migration of devs from Ethereum to Solana or something like that.
00:34:27.886 - 00:35:06.482, Speaker B: And that's actually not what's happening. We're seeing net new developers come into the ecosystem. But the transition from something like three g to four g technology changed the entire revolution of what was possible to build in the mobile space. That didn't displace fixed landline Internet connections. It added an entirely new use case and new category. And that's sort of, I think the thing that I think is really important here is that we're looking at transactions that are disruptively cheap compared to what you can get in other networks and have much higher throughput and much faster finality. That is going to mean a different type of product is built on Solana than is built on ethereum.
00:35:06.482 - 00:35:08.418, Speaker B: That's not bearish on ethereum and how.
00:35:08.426 - 00:35:21.114, Speaker A: It'S going to be until we see those products or we have them already. I mean, something that is meaningful for economic world activity. Is there something already that kind of seems like that?
00:35:23.214 - 00:35:26.394, Speaker B: Can you say a little bit more about the kind of thing you'd be looking for?
00:35:26.694 - 00:35:50.554, Speaker A: So something that scale is really needed? I think I'm totally optimistic that in the future, in many years, we will see those things. You seem to be saying that they're already here, but I don't know that anything. Is there something that is, let's say, superior to web two that we need on web3 that needs all this block space to be cheap, that has a meaningful economic impact today?
00:35:52.134 - 00:36:37.144, Speaker B: I think there's nothing in blockchain that has a global level meaningful economic impact today, to be fair. But I think if we look at the kinds of things where you could see that coming from the decentralized physical infrastructure space is very interesting to that effective. I think you can also look at groups like sling and uses of USDC and other international stablecoins that are genuinely cheaper than using web two payment rails to send money abroad. And that's a very interesting component for this too. But look, I think as an industry, we have less than 1% of the world using blockchain. We are still so early on all of these use cases in general right now that it's hard to say anything in crypto has had a world level economic impact.
00:36:38.444 - 00:36:47.316, Speaker C: It seems like the bulkies for Solana is that at some point it's a very forward looking bet once we get more users.
00:36:47.500 - 00:37:20.430, Speaker B: Let me give you the bear case for Solana. We don't need more block space. The bear case for Solana is that blockchain never really catches on to the extent where we need more block space and we need fast finality and we need a high number of transactions that we need low fees. It's entirely theoretically possible that that is just not something that the industry ever needs. And there isn't real mass adoption ever. And we don't see things like social networks built on blockchain. We don't see things like payment networks built on slack chain.
00:37:20.430 - 00:37:35.982, Speaker B: We don't see payroll moving over. We don't see all the ideas of gaming on blockchain. They all fail. I think that the bear case for Solana is basically that crypto also fails in its adoption play. And in that world, what percentage do.
00:37:35.998 - 00:37:40.634, Speaker A: You put on that world? Like, you know, pretty low. You have to put a probability on it.
00:37:41.374 - 00:37:58.954, Speaker B: I mean, I think if that, if that actually happens and we fast forward five to seven years, and fundamentally, the size of the crypto market is twice what it is today as an industry we failed, right. And that would. If your vision for the future is that crypto is going to be about this size forever, that's a reason to be bearish on salon.
00:37:58.994 - 00:38:03.050, Speaker A: When you say size, do you mean market cap or do you mean users? Or what exactly do you mean? Because those things.
00:38:03.082 - 00:38:08.762, Speaker B: Users transactions. Users transactions, real world use cases, right?
00:38:08.818 - 00:38:21.494, Speaker A: Because it's entirely possible that, like, a monetary story does emerge for, say, bitcoin and then the market's massive. But, yeah, like, none of those things that you mentioned of, like web two transitions happen.
00:38:21.914 - 00:39:21.042, Speaker B: Yeah. It's also possible that bitcoin is the only thing that survives, right? That the monetary properties of bitcoin and that proof of, like, in a world where we're maximizing for monetary utility, proof of work is a genius, beautiful system that blows proof of stake out of the water, right? If what we're monet, if we're focusing on is usability and smart contracts, the ability to actually have this stuff support millions of concurrent users. Right? Like, you need systems that are not bitcoin for that. And proof of work is a really bad system for those sorts of use cases. But bitcoin has this cockroach ability where even when you knock off 60% of the miners due to a change in policy in China, the blocks get super slow for two days, they slowly recover. It is a very resilient system that has the characteristics that if monetary, if monetary store of value is the only use case for crypto that lasts long term. Yeah.
00:39:21.042 - 00:39:23.934, Speaker B: You could see bitcoin as being the only thing that survives.
00:39:24.754 - 00:39:26.610, Speaker A: I do appreciate the economic honesty.
00:39:26.682 - 00:39:45.680, Speaker D: We've talked about this over a few episodes where bitcoin is very clearly one thing. We all know what that is. We don't have to get into it. Ethereum is in this what would be considered the deadly middle ground, where it's not really that scalable and it's not perfectly money. It's in this middle. Solana goes completely to one end of that. I think we can all agree on that.
00:39:45.680 - 00:40:10.006, Speaker D: We're obviously trying to scale as much as possible at the base layer, but as we've discussed, like, not these clear money or financial properties yet could be in the future, you're competing in that space. And it seems to me that there's quite a lot of other chains coming competing in that space that I frankly don't know too much about. But I assume you know more than me. Like aptos sui, near several others.
00:40:10.070 - 00:40:10.318, Speaker A: Right?
00:40:10.366 - 00:40:10.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:10.614 - 00:40:11.062, Speaker A: Monad.
00:40:11.118 - 00:40:25.742, Speaker D: Monad, yeah, whatever that is. Right. So in this world where there's like a lot of people competing for this, like, commodity, a very cheap, very low value block space. I don't mean that in a disparaging way.
00:40:25.798 - 00:40:26.110, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:26.182 - 00:40:38.954, Speaker D: How does a chain differentiate? Right? Because I think it's clear that bitcoin differentiates a theorem is going its own way. We'll see if that works. But if everyone's just fighting for this cheap, commoditized block space, what makes Solana different from any other chain that tries to do the same thing?
00:40:39.034 - 00:41:13.606, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a few things today. There really is no chain that has the performance characteristics of Solana. Apdos and Sui are both pretty new, but their transactions per second are 100 or less when you're looking at those sorts of things. And the other piece, too, is Solana is one global state, the same way ethereum, the ethereum l one is one global state. And that makes it. There's a ton of things you can do in one global state that you cannot do with sharded ecosystems or multilayer ecosystems. That is another really big differentiating point.
00:41:13.606 - 00:41:35.310, Speaker B: I think a good analogy here is looking at what TSMC has done. So Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, there's no fab or foundry in the world that can compete with TSMC, because for 20 years, they've been pumping basically all of their profits into making technology better. And for Solana, this is fire dancer.
00:41:35.342 - 00:41:35.486, Speaker A: Right?
00:41:35.510 - 00:41:57.218, Speaker B: This is a new validator client that's anywhere between ten to 100 times faster than the current version of Solana. It's probably a year or so out. It just hit testnet. Right. And so that is just a very different vision of how you actually hit success here. And I think you're sort of two ends of the spectrum. Thing is completely correct.
00:41:57.218 - 00:42:21.126, Speaker B: Solana totally has said before, over the long term, the cost of a Solana transaction should be as close to the cost of running that computer as possible. And the fees come from other places. They come from stake weighted qos, they come from priority fees for writing to certain pieces of state. And so Solana is sort of all in on that thesis of massive scalability and see what people build on top of it.
00:42:21.230 - 00:43:17.824, Speaker A: So, like, I'm curious, like, what is the defensibility of IP in this space? Because you mentioned, you know, Taiwan computer chips, like, all this stuff, there's a lot of special sauce that goes into these things. And as Justin alluded, you know, there's if, like, ethereum was v one and then a smart contract and Solana was v two, we're seeing, like, the next, like, the third gen and maybe like the third gen will not be successful. Maybe this will be like DeFi 2.0, which fell flat on its face, but potentially Monad. Justin, we're going to get Keoni on pretty soon, so you can learn about what that is. But regardless, there are other very smart people and teams that will not even just now into the next ten years, continue to try to build a better version. Are we basically betting that the team and the current path and the technology path is going to be superior long term?
00:43:18.884 - 00:43:42.004, Speaker B: Yeah. So the other piece here that's important is Solana is the first parallel blockchain that doesn't involve sharding to achieve parallel ability. Right. EVM is aggressively sequential. Every transaction takes a global write lock. And look, the folks at Monad are doing incredible work. I think it's the most interesting thing to happen to the EVM in, gosh, six years, basically, since the EVM was invented.
00:43:42.004 - 00:44:18.754, Speaker B: Right. They're the first people who have actually tried to scale the EVM in a way that is meaningful and difficult, and not just marketing. I think it's really interesting to see what they're building. One of the things that's challenging about scaling the EVM out to 10,000 or 20,000 or 100,000 transactions per second is transactions are non deterministic on EVM. So there are some key architectural differences that have been made in how Solana is constructed. That's designed for long term scalability. So, for example, before a transaction executes on Solana, it has to specify the accounts in the state that it wants to talk to.
00:44:18.754 - 00:45:05.274, Speaker B: And so only those accounts in only that state, there's a write lock taken out on, on EVM. A transaction actually can go any which way once you start computing it. This is why wallet drainers are such a problem in EVM, and they're less of a problem in the Solana ecosystem, because you don't necessarily know what all of the interactions that a transaction is going to touch when it executes an EVM. There's some really powerful advantages of that, but there's also some disadvantages. And one of those disadvantages is it's very hard to parallelize. So Monad has a certain amount of overhead because they have to do stochastic analysis of what is this transaction likely to do, then they need reserved compute capacity to actually correct that. If that ends up not being the case, and Keone and the guys over there are incredibly smart.
00:45:05.274 - 00:45:34.300, Speaker B: I've been watching what they're doing, and it's really cool to see. But this is a thing where there are limits to what different types of vms can support over the long term. But all the work that the Solana foundation does and people building on Solana is open source. We hope it makes every blockchain better, the same way that the work being done on Ethereum makes Solana better. Right? Every blockchain owes a huge debt to bitcoin and also owes a huge debt to Ethereum for creating this whole concept of smart contracts.
00:45:34.492 - 00:46:06.766, Speaker D: You mentioned the Solana foundation, and I wanted to ask just a little bit about centralization, securities laws, et cetera. So I sort of take my own approach where I think intuitively, like, is this an investment? Somewhat like a security? For me, I actually think Ethereum is somewhat like a security. We've talked about this before. Very small amount of developers actually decide what happens to the Ethereum chain. People like us that are quite big stakeholders, don't have much of a say, and there is this centralized component, and to me that makes it a security. I don't think it should be regulated by the SEC. I think it's something different.
00:46:06.766 - 00:46:35.104, Speaker D: But I think if we can make that case for Ethereum, we can make that case even more so for Solana. I think Solana would be in the blockchain, would be in much worse shape if the Solana foundation disappeared, as opposed to the Ethereum foundation. So I'm curious, like, what are your thoughts there? How is Solana not a security? We can skip that question if you want to. And then where does Solana go without the Solana foundation? Is there still going to be development on the blockchain if something happened tomorrow?
00:46:35.224 - 00:47:13.370, Speaker B: Yeah, the short answer is yes. The team building fire dancer is totally independent from the Solana foundation. They have their own monetary incentives to create a validator client for the Salana net network. And so I think there would be, the production of cool, awesome software for the Solana network would absolutely continue. The Solana foundation is an important part of the Solana ecosystem. It's not to say there would be no effect if it went away the same way. There would certainly be an effect if the Ethereum foundation went away, but Ethereum would certainly survive that, and I think Solana would too.
00:47:13.482 - 00:47:40.694, Speaker D: But you have to recognize, of course, these teams are somewhat disconnected, but there's a ton of coordination that happens, happens behind the scenes. Like, I'm not just picking on Solana here. I've said the same about Ethereum. The Terra docs are, the Terra legal docs that came out are really interesting in that we saw these validator group chats where all the validators are actually just sort of like coming together to decide on something in what fits their interest. And I mean there it's not as simple as saying these are independent teams doing their own thing.
00:47:40.734 - 00:47:58.210, Speaker A: Like Justin, stop. Like as a high frequency trader, this is like the first time with like fire dancer and all this stuff that, you know, all these like brains in my industry are actually trying to do something apart from cutting 1 like trying to beat the other guy. So I'm actually happy that jump is doing all that stuff.
00:47:58.362 - 00:48:17.580, Speaker B: Yeah. Also like check out their talks from breakpoint. Like they figured out a way to do Ed 25519 acceleration that is twice as fast as anyone else in the industry. That is not a Solana specific innovation. Lots of blockchains use math. This will benefit everyone in the space. Right.
00:48:17.580 - 00:48:48.526, Speaker B: So I think the cool part here is that I think we've had a lot of b quality folks operating in crypto for a very long time because the industry hasn't been taken particularly seriously. And there are some incredible minds. Right. Vitalik Anatoly, fill in the blank. There's lots of incredible folks who believe in blockchain, but the average blockchain developer is not as good as the average high frequency trader developer. I think that's not a controversial statement. Or the average embedded systems engineer at Qualcomm.
00:48:48.526 - 00:48:49.274, Speaker B: Right?
00:48:50.494 - 00:48:51.714, Speaker A: This is a great point.
00:48:52.094 - 00:49:34.668, Speaker B: Yeah. And these are huge boosts to the entire ecosystem to get these folks involved. I do want to go back, Justin, the one thing you were saying, which is I'm not sure that coordination is the same thing as centralization. I think if you look at something like the Linux foundation and the way Linux works, there are a group of people who are very closely aligned, apart from the University of Michigan in terms of what should actually go into the Linux kernel and how that development should be done, and it's done by people all around the world. I mean, Cern operates in the same way. The entire academic particle physics community is a diverse set of stakeholders, a diverse set of funding, but they're all working towards sort of a common goal. And I think that's kind of the end state vision for blockchain.
00:49:34.668 - 00:50:20.964, Speaker B: I don't see a world where the average person is voting on governance decisions and EIP proposals and that sort of thing because I think the average person is not qualified and doesn't really know what's going on. I do think that there is some bag alignment within all blockchain governance today that we have to sort of figure out a way to address, to go back full circle. I think that that's sort of the group that captured bitcoin back in the block, the block size debates. And there's a little bit of that influence in Ethereum to sort of push it to be value accruing at the expense of scale. But these are natural forces in any sort of group of humans trying to figure out what to do. And this is why I think the biggest problems in blockchain over the next five years are not technical. They're all human.
00:50:21.984 - 00:50:59.794, Speaker C: Like Austin, I think the stance you're taking is that crypto as money is a meme, and you're basically saying that Solana shouldn't be money. It's not money. If someone is buying Solana, what kind of bet is it? Is it kind of this bet on the future of this utopian future where so many things like run on blockchain rails? Do you think it's kind of like a shelling point for communities to form saying, hey, like, I own Solana, you own Solana, let's build on Solana. Do you kind of view it as like a Tesla like asset just because, yeah, Tesla has, like, a crazy premium, doesn't generally, you know, cash that doesn't, like, really pay dividends. Do you think it's like, what kind of asset is Solana trying to be?
00:50:59.954 - 00:51:44.044, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there is. There's one important characteristic of the Solana network that I don't think any other blockchains have. But correct me if I'm wrong here, which is stake weighted Qos, which is basically a system where if there's contention for a piece of state, salon has local fee markets, not global fee markets. So what that means is there's a really hot NFT mint or something along those lines. Fees can spike just for that NFT mint because that is a. A serial transaction if you're trying to write to the same piece of state, that has to go sequentially. And stake weighted Qos is a way of basically prioritizing transactions to land, where if they're sent from a validator that has stake, that is weighted higher than a transaction sent from a validator without stake.
00:51:44.044 - 00:52:47.484, Speaker B: So there is a world long term where the same way that high frequency trading firms pay a bunch of money to get faster data from stock exchanges that a whole bunch of business and corporate actors own Sol simply so they can stake to a validator, so they can provide a certain amount of access to the network during periods where there might be something that's, like, state specific, that's contested, like an arbitrage, for example, or something along those lines. But I think in a more broad sense, you're buying a share of a global computer. I mean, share like a security, but like, you're buying time on the global state machine that is Solana. You're buying the ability to send transactions over the long term, and you're believing that that is going to be valuable, right? That the inflation rate on Solana diminishes at about one and a half percentage points per year, down to a steady state of one and a half percent, which is the same inflation rate that Ethereum has. And this is sort of that long term bet. I think it's very fair to look at the Solana ecosystem and go, this is a few years behind. Sorry.
00:52:47.484 - 00:53:11.004, Speaker B: Look at the Solana ecosystem and say, this is a few years behind Ethereum. The Ethereum tooling is better than the tooling on Solana. The average Ethereum dev has been through one more bear market than the average Solana dev. But if you're looking at it as a future bet on that thesis, that one global state is going to be a really attractive place to build applications.
00:53:11.624 - 00:53:36.218, Speaker D: Austin, as someone that missed out on Solana when it was dollar two, when it was at dollar twelve in this recent bear market, how should I personally be thinking about what a good value is for me? Right. And as someone that would be interested in buying sol, you know, like, what makes it attractive now at, say, $60 versus even more attractive at 20 or, you know, 300, what are you looking at personally? And what should I be tracking?
00:53:36.306 - 00:53:50.778, Speaker B: So, unfortunately, the lawyers at the salon foundation will certainly not let me say anything about this. What I can say, though, is I genuinely do not know what drives price in this market. It does not make any sense to me.
00:53:50.826 - 00:54:29.434, Speaker A: How do you feel when you see, like, because, you know, you're talking about this as, like, you know, if you want to secure your future ability to use Solana in ten years when all this cool stuff might happen, you might want to buy some now, so you secure it. But what we're actually seeing is, you know, apes, whatever. Good apes, whatever. I don't know, they're, they're putting in like 50% of their net worth on this kind of thing and leveraging long on bonk and, like, all this other stuff, do you just ignore it? Do you see that as, like, people going to be people, you know, like this kind of thing? How do you like, mentally, because you're a very serious guy, you have a serious role, but, you know, that this matters a lot.
00:54:29.774 - 00:55:07.746, Speaker B: Oh, of course. And just to be clear, I'm not suggesting anyone should buy Solana so they can use it in ten years. I think the lawyers would also be unhappy with that sort of a state statement. But at its core, we see people building things and trying stuff out on all of these networks. I think it's hard to look at apecoin and say it made sense to spend $3,500 in gas fee to claim that airdrop or the crash. We've seen in friendtech that these things are actually sustainable, long term, whatever. In some level, there's a lot of tulip trading on blockchain, right? And eventually the dutch tulip market collapses.
00:55:07.746 - 00:55:49.254, Speaker B: But that doesn't mean that the underlying network or the underlying technology sort of falls into that category. To use a pretty crude analogy, the collapse of Enron did not prove that deregulated energy markets were a bad idea. It proved that Enron was a bad idea. Right. And so I think some of this is just enough monkeys on enough typewriters are eventually going to figure out, like, what are absolute killer use cases for all of these platforms and all of this tech. And that's awesome to see. But it's sort of like the wild west in the early days of the oil markets, right? You would see these incredible boom and bust cycles of refineries of everyone in that space, let alone classic, good old fashioned gold mining and gold rushes.
00:55:49.254 - 00:55:57.254, Speaker B: A lot of the dynamics we are seeing today are very classic dynamics of markets that still just need five or ten years to mature.
00:55:58.134 - 00:56:47.004, Speaker A: I mean, I fully agree with that part. We're at this wild west stage where people don't realize what they're doing. Just like my final point, and we can kind of go to our last segment, but as my closing kind of argument, I will say that, yes, this is sort of like a situation where Solana, not just Solana, a lot of these l one and other tokens become like tulips, like you describe, where people just start speculating like crazy on them. And I understand, you know, you have a legal position, all this stuff, and Tolle is like an amazing guy, technologist, etcetera. But ignoring the fact that this is game is going on, this tulip game, I think sociologically, anthropologically is very important. What's happening? It's not just like a random tulip thing. I think it's people trying to organize community money, as I've coined it.
00:56:47.004 - 00:57:13.794, Speaker A: People are trying to build communities, find like minded individuals around the world, and have this, like, you know, asset that they try to get rich together and congregate together. Now, that's happening outside of, like you said, all the technology, all the amazing stuff that's being built. And that's true. They are separate. But that game is going on. And, yeah, you know, there's two issues. One, the technology I see is like, validation.
00:57:13.794 - 00:57:24.598, Speaker A: When the apes go crazy, like, the apes might be like, playing their games and short squeezing people, and they're like, oh, look, we told you the technology is good. It got three times better this month. Right, right.
00:57:24.726 - 00:58:09.904, Speaker B: But this is always the, this is what I mean by, like, I don't know what makes these markets, like, genuinely, I don't know what makes these markets move. Was ETH 95% worse when it went from one thousand two hundred dollars to eighty dollars? Was, was Solana when it was $260? Whatever math that is times a better network than it is today. No, the Solana network is probably 20 times stronger today than it was in November of 2021. There's more developers, there's more senior developers, there's way more ecosystem adoption. The technology is way further forward than it was before. Traders are going to be traders, and they're going to do whatever they do. I think the real test for any of these is how many serious engineers are actually building on these systems.
00:58:09.904 - 00:58:58.524, Speaker B: Ethereum is a lot of really serious folks building on it. Solana does, too. For me, that is the best indication of how likely a network is to continue to be relevant into the future. Now, if that means the global crypto market is $100 million or $100 trillion, right, make your own bets and figure out your own assumptions and whatever, do your own research on that. But it is these networks that have very serious computer science folks working on them that are most likely to continue existing into the future and are most likely, I think, to find, break out, use cases, to find mass adoption, to find all of these things that we're all kind of looking for in this industry, I think we always underestimate what's possible in five years, and we massively overestimate what's possible in two years.
00:58:59.064 - 00:59:30.980, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean, I think we're very appreciative that you came on. Glad to hear Sol is not trying to be money. It's trying to actually accrue value in the long term. I think, you know, I am personally very interested in the discussion of what all these people are doing. And I don't just see them as traders. I think it's like, you know, traders are subsection, but there's a lot of other people that participate, that have normal jobs, they're not, you know, professional traders. And we will continue to discuss this into the future with, you know, different episodes as we do this.
00:59:30.980 - 00:59:37.184, Speaker A: But I love that you came on, and we're willing to give, you know, your perspective on this.
00:59:37.764 - 00:59:38.196, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:59:38.260 - 00:59:45.664, Speaker B: Thanks for the invite. This is a lot of fun. Really appreciate you guys taking the time and also taking the brain space to kind of dig in on these topics.
00:59:46.444 - 00:59:48.884, Speaker A: Absolutely. We're not done yet. We have one more segment, Austin.
00:59:48.924 - 00:59:49.180, Speaker B: All right.
00:59:49.212 - 01:00:02.730, Speaker A: Hopefully you can join us on it. So we have the pasta of the week segment. We each kind of saw something, maybe, that we want to quote, maybe Taiki, you want to kick off? Yeah, sure.
01:00:02.762 - 01:00:16.814, Speaker C: So I want to talk about the Certik tweet that I think is a little relevant to today's topic around the Solana phone just having a backdoor, and they have this 1 minute video.
01:00:17.634 - 01:00:18.178, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:00:18.266 - 01:00:39.010, Speaker C: And then do you want to pull up the other ve horny tweet? I can't believe I just said ve horny, but I feel like every. It's kind of like this meme where everything that Surtik touches just turns into a pile of shit. I mean, I respect auditors and whatnot, but you kind of want to give a rebuttal on what happened here.
01:00:39.082 - 01:00:39.290, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:39.322 - 01:00:59.410, Speaker B: Let me start off by saying auditors are the most important people in this entire crypto ecosystem. They charge a lot of money. They charge a lot of money for a reason. Most audit firms are great. Get recommendations from your friends. Please get your code audited. I don't know what was going on with this tweet they put out.
01:00:59.410 - 01:01:15.514, Speaker B: They basically showed that if you can break the bootloader on an Android phone, that you can compromise a bitcoin wallet, which, sure. Right. To me, this was sort of something that doesn't really make any sense, and there was no action necessary.
01:01:15.594 - 01:01:15.810, Speaker A: Right.
01:01:15.842 - 01:01:41.228, Speaker B: There's no bug report that they filed with us that said, hey, we'd found this problem in the Solana mobile stack here. We're submitting a bug report for it. This is the basic thing of if you have physical access to a computer, a hacker can always do something. And this is why air gapped signing can be really important for some folks. Keeping your ledger physically secure somewhere is also important. Yeah. There's nothing in this video that had anything to do with the Solana phone.
01:01:41.228 - 01:01:45.772, Speaker B: It just had to do with an Android phone. And the same thing is, of course, possible on an iOS phone.
01:01:45.908 - 01:01:48.084, Speaker D: Is your Solana phone your daily driver?
01:01:48.244 - 01:01:53.344, Speaker B: No, it's not. I am very much stuck on imessage lock in.
01:01:53.684 - 01:01:54.476, Speaker D: Same, same.
01:01:54.540 - 01:01:56.052, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:01:56.108 - 01:01:58.064, Speaker A: Justin, you want to share pasta?
01:01:58.804 - 01:02:37.362, Speaker D: Absolutely. I tried to pick something that was odd topic today. So we've been talking a lot about the value quill to solve the value accrual to ETH. If Sol is just this commodity, where is the value going to accrue? We talked a lot about that. I think Austin made some awesome points, but Evan, who shout out to Evan, huge super fan of the show, tweeted out this fundermentals meme, and this is also what you talked about at the end of the show, is, like, where the fundamentals fit in. Sadly, they don't really fit in anywhere at this point. And coins go up for a number of reasons, usually narrative and memetic based.
01:02:37.362 - 01:02:39.994, Speaker D: But, yeah, that's my pasta of the week.
01:02:40.114 - 01:02:44.970, Speaker A: I love the response there. There's, like, a response by Midi. It's even better where Salana is going.
01:02:45.002 - 01:02:45.770, Speaker D: I didn't see that.
01:02:45.842 - 01:02:54.842, Speaker A: It doesn't need fundamentals. This is like a little. Little Suzu coffee pasta there on. You won't need charts, but I love that.
01:02:54.978 - 01:02:55.730, Speaker D: That's awesome.
01:02:55.802 - 01:03:00.514, Speaker C: Oh, and there's a. Oh, whoa. Austin, is that your old account?
01:03:00.634 - 01:03:09.746, Speaker B: That is not my alt account. I said layer. Thirty seven s. I will have you know, I don't think we need 42 layers, just 37.
01:03:09.930 - 01:03:32.594, Speaker A: This is very good. I'll share. I'll share my pasta. So cryptolin made a very good point in this tweet. I love the picture as well, but this was epic. So if we're going to win the fight against Tradfi, I'll say this at least properly. They need to underestimate us, and we need to act stupid, and everyone's doing a really good job of that.
01:03:32.594 - 01:03:58.610, Speaker A: I think the price action and a lot of random tokens that we're seeing over the last few weeks, even though it's great to see activity back. Yeah. You know, it's not gonna make people take us more seriously. And hopefully that'll give us a bit more of a. Of some time to keep building the, you know, the inside the trojan horse while, you know, the senators are thinking that we're just doing stupid stuff, which we are doing. We are doing stupid stuff. How about you, Austin? Did you.
01:03:58.610 - 01:04:01.150, Speaker A: Do you have anything that you kind of caught your eye this week?
01:04:01.322 - 01:04:28.594, Speaker B: Yeah, there was a great tweet a few days ago from the stalwart account. I think you guys can probably pull this up here, too. The tweet reads, stocks are surging rumors of an S and P 500 ETF. Just, this is. This is. God, this is like, this is like the core of the best part of crypto Twitter. There's so many bad parts of crypto Twitter, but just these.
01:04:28.594 - 01:04:36.294, Speaker B: These dumb insider jokes that are both making fun of ourselves and making fun of the existing economic system. This is what does it for me.
01:04:36.914 - 01:04:39.922, Speaker A: I mean, I'm sure you're starting to get asked, like, when is the Solana eTf?
01:04:39.978 - 01:04:44.266, Speaker D: I was just about to ask. I was going to say, is there a Solana blackrock etf in the works?
01:04:44.330 - 01:04:49.730, Speaker B: I know you're Blackrock. Genuinely. It's not like they'd give us a heads up on this sort of thing.
01:04:49.762 - 01:04:53.226, Speaker D: They bought it $12. That's what drove the price all the way up to 60.
01:04:53.370 - 01:05:07.804, Speaker A: All right, well, I think everybody had amazing pastas as we look at the. The quality was very high. I think Justin's has to win just because the responses kind of just keep. Keep upping the level so that that whole thread was. Was epic. So, Justin, you're the pastor of the week winner.
01:05:07.964 - 01:05:18.264, Speaker D: I'm honored. 17 episodes. I think this is my first win ever. So, Austin, you're my lucky charm. I'll have to bring you back in a year when Solana's killing it and doing amazingly as well.
01:05:18.684 - 01:05:19.468, Speaker C: Fire dancers.
01:05:19.516 - 01:05:26.904, Speaker A: All right. Yeah. Thanks, guys. Thanks for the amazing episode. Austin, again, much love. Thank you for coming on and hope to chat again.
