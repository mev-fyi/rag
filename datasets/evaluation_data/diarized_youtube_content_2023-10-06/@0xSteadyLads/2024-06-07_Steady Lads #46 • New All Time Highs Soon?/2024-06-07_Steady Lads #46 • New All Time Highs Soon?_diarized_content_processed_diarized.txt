00:00:00.320 - 00:00:01.136, Speaker A: All right, I'll go next.
00:00:01.254 - 00:00:02.314, Speaker B: What is this?
00:00:04.334 - 00:00:18.382, Speaker A: This is like a dating app. And then, like, all the. All the hot chicks, which are obviously fake, are like. Then you just paste the ca dot dot dot. I think it's, like, a great way to market your shit calling. Just going bumble with a fake hot chick, and then just get them to.
00:00:18.398 - 00:00:22.270, Speaker C: Buy chicky, you know? This isn't bumble. You know very well this is hinge. Oh, right.
00:00:22.302 - 00:00:23.454, Speaker A: It's hinge. You're right.
00:00:23.574 - 00:00:24.982, Speaker D: Only Justin knows that.
00:00:25.118 - 00:00:29.834, Speaker A: Only Justin knows that. Justin's a dog.
00:00:32.054 - 00:00:33.674, Speaker D: He's got the dog in him.
00:00:56.274 - 00:01:11.254, Speaker A: Oh. How's it going, guys? Welcome to study, lads. I will be hosting this week first time, so, you know, excuse any. Any hiccups. Yeah. Welcome, guys. So I heard Jordy was in Vegas.
00:01:11.714 - 00:01:42.242, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we can see some of the strip behind me, maybe. It's been a long year at the crypto table, so I tried to switch it up with the poker tables a little bit. Every year, I make the pilgrimage to the Mecca and play some World Series events. You know, it's. It's obviously, it's a good challenge. Distraction from day to day, and I get to challenge myself, push myself, and see what happens. And I've been bracelet hunting.
00:01:42.242 - 00:02:11.144, Speaker B: I never managed to get one when I was playing professionally, so I've been trying to do it now in my. In my older years, I don't have many days to play, so I just play maybe, like, five events every year and try to make some deep runs, and. Yeah, I stepped into one this week. Maybe we can show some of the. I'm in the background of Negronu and Ivy here. That's my claim to fame here.
00:02:11.844 - 00:02:13.756, Speaker A: Is that your head right there in the middle?
00:02:13.820 - 00:02:27.184, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, which I don't have any longer, so, you know, not to have it, but if you click play, you'll. I had a massive chip lead at this. What did you work?
00:02:29.684 - 00:02:33.124, Speaker C: Wow, that stack.
00:02:33.284 - 00:02:53.422, Speaker B: Oh, man. Damn. I think I was first with 15 and then went to the final table, like, third, like, the last ten, but was not a good last day. Ended up 7th, I think. Had a couple of weird spots, made some inaccuracies, but I think for my burnout that we talked about, like, this. This was, this was good medicine.
00:02:53.558 - 00:02:54.670, Speaker C: So you're back?
00:02:54.862 - 00:02:58.814, Speaker B: I'm all. I wouldn't say I'm back, but I'm getting back. I'm getting back.
00:02:58.934 - 00:03:02.262, Speaker D: And, like, what was the buy in and, like, the game you played?
00:03:02.398 - 00:03:35.332, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is my favorite tournament by far of the entire, like ever. It's the $10,000 buy in, dealer's choice, and there's 21 or 22 games or something that people can choose from. You get all these plaques and everybody gets like one round to choose and it just goes around. So you think about the metagame of what other people are bad at and what are you going to be better at and it changes depending on your table. So like, I had a table full of stud players. I'm choosing like Omaha and then like those guys get busted somebody else and then I switch the stud.
00:03:35.332 - 00:04:04.444, Speaker B: Now, um, it's super fun. I know poker on like a deeper level rather than like a game level. So I wouldn't say like I'm a Texas Holden player, like an Omaha player. I just understand the general math of it very well, so it suits my, my strengths. I think I'm very strong in that field for just being able to adapt to like any game that gets thrown out. Super fun. It's like crack and it's like the most fun event.
00:04:04.444 - 00:04:33.594, Speaker B: And yeah, I was triple eating most of it. Didn't, didn't made another final table. I think it's my 8th final table at this point. Still no bracelet. And then the only consolation was I got to sweat Tom Dewan playing some cash with Madison beer later. So we're hanging out, playing some. Apparently Madison beer is into crypto and stuff.
00:04:33.664 - 00:04:37.038, Speaker C: So do we have two new study lads viewers after this?
00:04:37.166 - 00:04:43.434, Speaker B: I hope she's not watching. It'll be a top signal. But she was interested in these meme coin and like how to make one.
00:04:44.054 - 00:04:46.406, Speaker D: Oh really? She's gonna launch a shitcoin?
00:04:46.510 - 00:04:47.714, Speaker A: She launches one?
00:04:48.174 - 00:04:55.954, Speaker B: Yeah, apparently like they share a hairstylist or something. So she knows all about the iggy one. So maybe there's something to do there.
00:04:56.494 - 00:04:58.318, Speaker A: What's Malfa right there, Jordy?
00:04:58.446 - 00:05:22.560, Speaker B: There's a lot of alpha. I'm just dropping, dropping them. Vegas Alpha. You know the funny thing, like me and Thikki were at consensus last week, hanging out, but in Vegas, I'm having more people stop me and talk about like steady lads than in the consensus. It's not even a crypto conference. Like, the poker community loves steady lads. I got people at dinner stopping me, got Eric Lindgren kind of shouting out, it's, it's, it's nice.
00:05:22.560 - 00:05:30.288, Speaker B: And I felt like consensus wasn't as like crypto native like then. Then, you know, poker players are apparently.
00:05:30.376 - 00:05:38.184, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a bit more like corporate. A consensus. That's cool that people are recognizing you at these events. They reckon they know me too. Like, they're all these, come over, man.
00:05:38.264 - 00:05:39.164, Speaker B: Come over.
00:05:40.024 - 00:05:41.184, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:05:41.344 - 00:05:45.272, Speaker D: Wait, Eric Lindgren watches study labs, or did he just know you?
00:05:45.448 - 00:05:53.576, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. He says he what? He watches all the stuff. He was, like, excited to see me. I was like, wow, okay, cool. Jesus.
00:05:53.760 - 00:06:09.286, Speaker D: Well, I guess there's a lot of overlap. I know Andrew Roble, like, watched my videos and stuff, and he said he's like, no down to hang out and stuff. So I guess there's a lot of over. Yeah, I mean, we're all degenerates. We all have money. You want to gamble, we're just pure degenerates.
00:06:09.310 - 00:06:55.694, Speaker B: So I guess there's like, a obviously, like, you know, when I was coming of age, poker was the thing that, like, if you were a smart, you know, 20 year old looking to make money because you don't have money, like, what are you doing in the world? You're. You're probably just playing poker because the game's kind of soft, and you could, you know, you could make six figures just by being, you know, pretty, pretty sharp and disciplined about it. And I think nowadays the same young people growing up are more, like, into crypto. And then there's, like, this generation that started off at poker because that was the thing, and then they've just been dabbling or adapting, you know, in some cases, just, like, fully migrating over. So, yeah, it's nice to see and shout out to all our poker community.
00:06:56.914 - 00:07:13.746, Speaker D: That's kind of like my story, too. Like, I. I was playing full time in 2020, working my ass off, running sims every single night, and then, like, it was just too hard. You know, I have no edge. I mean, like, 40 year, and I'm like, yeah, I just can't. I can't do it no more. And then crypto started pumping.
00:07:13.746 - 00:07:20.452, Speaker D: I'm like, all right, fuck it. This. There's more edge to be had here. I know. Thicky, like, thicky. You were a poker player too, right? Or somewhat.
00:07:20.588 - 00:07:43.034, Speaker A: I was, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's cool that, like, crypto has a lot more, I guess, leverage and scale that you can make money in it versus poker. I mean, obviously you can make a lot in the highest levels games. You get, like, those, like, juicy private games, but, yeah, it seems like, you know, a lot of the skill sets, a lot of, like, like, the game modes and the meta games, and just, like, the way you think about it are very, very similar.
00:07:43.204 - 00:08:05.614, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot of politics now getting into private games. I mean, there was just this million dollar game, million dollar buying game at the Hustler casino in LA. And there was all this politics, like, who's gonna get a seed, who's not gonna get this seed? And the fish get to decide because they're the ones like minus. So I think Doug polk only got to play a little bit. Like, they kind of kicked him out. So. Yeah.
00:08:05.734 - 00:08:07.274, Speaker A: Did you get to play, Jody?
00:08:07.574 - 00:08:22.338, Speaker B: I wasn't in LA, man. I'm. And honestly, like, the, the cash, like, you play cash usually because you want to win money. But for me, it's the glory that I'm, that I'm chasing. So a bracelet. I'm going to try to get this bracelet.
00:08:22.506 - 00:08:35.314, Speaker A: Yeah. But the money is in crypto and that the glory is in Falkirk. That's cool. Well, you got it. You got to update us on how that goes. Hopefully you win one. Jordy.
00:08:35.314 - 00:08:37.374, Speaker A: It's quite hard to win one, right.
00:08:38.014 - 00:09:03.766, Speaker B: You know, the way I see it, I'm playing mainly these ten K events and the number of people playing them, depending on the game. Probably the lowest, like stud high. Not that many people really understand set high. So you can get away with like 110, maybe 100 people playing only like. And then some of them have like, you know, 200, 200, 5300. I think they like limit, limit hold them is going to be like 300. But if you have like one in 200.
00:09:03.766 - 00:09:21.604, Speaker B: And I think I'm quite comfortably, well above the average of the field. Even though I don't play poker. I haven't played a single hand. This is like, I didn't tell anybody this at the table because I don't want them like, coming after me. I had not played a single hand of poker since last June. So it's been twelve months. Everyone's grinding, fucking.
00:09:21.604 - 00:09:57.130, Speaker B: I haven't even looked at cards in a year. But I still think I'm a. I'm a favorite to the field comfortably, which is weird. I think I play a lot better the less I play. So I'm gonna do a Twitter spaces, I think, next week to talk about that, like, performance mindset. But I think because I had the fundamental grounding, I think the thing I was missing for years was the like, the performance instinct and just like playing your a game 100% of the time instead of like, fluctuating between, like, you know, ABCDe and. Yeah, I think.
00:09:57.130 - 00:10:02.534, Speaker B: I think that's probably the most interesting part of it is like trying to refine the performance, like the high, like the high performance.
00:10:03.104 - 00:10:09.644, Speaker C: Can I ask you a question, Jordy? After how many hands would you say, like, on average, luck balances out, right?
00:10:10.824 - 00:10:24.604, Speaker B: I mean, it depends how much you want it to balance out. So, like, if you wanted to go like 95th percentile confidence interval, 99th percentile, you know, it really depends. Depends on the type of game, the format. So it's hard to say.
00:10:25.104 - 00:10:36.114, Speaker C: But would you say over one trip to Vegas where you're, you know, playing in a few different games, it's all going to balance out and basically your true skill level as a poker player will come through?
00:10:37.774 - 00:10:53.870, Speaker B: Depends how much edge you have on the field. Like, if you have a big edge, you'll win every trip. If it's like a small edge, it'll fluctuate. So, sorry to be so vague, but, yeah, unfortunately, there's no clear answers when it comes to probability. Like, this makes sense at these poker events.
00:10:53.902 - 00:11:04.134, Speaker A: Like, did, uh, did anyone, like, sort of comment on how they think about markets? What's the general sentiment then? At least crypto markets?
00:11:05.114 - 00:11:22.002, Speaker B: Um, they're generally just, you know, asking if they should stay long. I think is the, they're alone. Yeah. Everyone's like, long, man. Like, people are long right now, and I think it's probably the right thing. Um, I'm directly long. Been long, obviously, the whole way, but continue to hold it.
00:11:22.002 - 00:11:38.254, Speaker B: I think we might break out of the range finally. It feels like the inflows are coming and we've just been knocking on that bitcoin door. It feels like it might break. And we get into the eighties. I don't know how you're seeing it. Thicky.
00:11:39.514 - 00:12:11.444, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, and it definitely looks like, at least just looking at the chart from a TA perspective, it looks like it just wants to go like 80k. There's like the last, like, final boss of like, offers at like 72. That is like, keeping things down. But, you know, equities took all time highs, so. Yeah, I mean, GME also, like, running too into these, like, low ball volume summer months, you know, maybe something. You guys, what do you guys think? Are you guys all along too? Justin and Tyke?
00:12:11.864 - 00:12:38.826, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we added a billion dollar inflow day. Was it late last week or early this week? Which I think is extremely encouraging. Like, you guys, I think I've been long the whole way. Sort of held too long through the bear market and then added a lot in the bear and have kept, have held long. I think it's a little, it would be a little crazy to sell. I mean, everyone knows I hold mostly eth. I think it'd be crazy to sell before we see what the flows are like with the ETF, I think that's a bet worth taking.
00:12:38.826 - 00:12:59.244, Speaker C: And also before all time highs, like, it's sort of hard to imagine the cycles just sort of over. And bitcoin hit all time highs, but effectively nothing else. But I guess BNB has hit it so far. I think BNB just hit all time highs this week or last week. So still long, holding long. I do think, like, towards the end of the year that's going to become more of a question, but we'll see how we do.
00:12:59.944 - 00:13:06.224, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, you didn't go buy EtH at 990 just to sell it under all timelines, right?
00:13:06.304 - 00:13:07.168, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:13:07.336 - 00:13:08.408, Speaker B: I feel like ETH is one of.
00:13:08.416 - 00:13:42.254, Speaker D: Those assets where it's like the majority of the ETH holder base have kind of succumbed to the idea that it's going to underperform, but no one wants to sell below 4k. You know, it's just like, I'll sell at five k or six k. I feel like that's generally the kind of holder mentality. And yeah, I don't see why we can't break all time highs in both bitcoin and Eid. I mean, Nvidia hit 3 trillion market cap. Jensen Huang is maybe that new Elon Musk, right? Maybe like this cycle, he's like signing people's like, boobs and stuff. Equity is just chatting about all time highs.
00:13:42.254 - 00:13:58.362, Speaker D: I feel like Nvidia AI, the entire narrative is creating a positive drift for the stocks, crypto and yeah, like maybe by the election maybe makes sense, take some risk off. But just Max long right now.
00:13:58.498 - 00:14:31.318, Speaker C: Thikki, I actually wanted to ask you. This is something I've been watching, and I'm curious if it matters. So I'm going to pull up this chart. This is ETH supply on all exchanges, and then prices in black and the supply is in blue. And you can see it's just effectively, like, been in down only mode, and there truly is, like, very little eth left on exchanges. A lot of it's been staked a lots in Defi, lots on L2s, a lots locked up, restaked, et cetera, et cetera. Like, does this actually matter? Like, with the ETF? Is the door to get in going to be so small that something wild just happens with the.
00:14:31.318 - 00:14:38.606, Speaker C: The price of ethereum? I think that's something Jordy alluded to, but I'm curious if you think the supply and exchanges is a metric that's worth looking at.
00:14:38.790 - 00:15:25.624, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm curious if Jordy has a take too, on this, but I'm going to, I guess, get my opinion. I do feel like looking at the true circulating supply, which is just the amount of coins that are free floating, is very nebulous task. But it's also like, it literally is what dictates how these things trade, like a local basis. So I do think it's a curious look at. I don't know if this thing measures, like, staked ETH or not, because obviously, like, the percent of ETH that's been staked has gone up a ton since the Chappelle upgrade. So, yeah, I'm not sure, but it definitely does look like there could be a trend of less just free floating eth on sexes, which does make it trade, essentially. It makes it, like, trade at a smaller market cap.
00:15:26.784 - 00:15:58.138, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't believe it includes staked ETH. It's just raw Ethan exchanges and it's about, I think, 13 million eth. And that number is at like a five or six year low. Like, it's just, since it's just been in down only mode. And yeah, I used to think that, like, oh, if people can just hold stake deep in this liquid derivative, that will just impact the price equally. But actually, like, I'm not necessarily convinced that's true. Like, if a lot of people are trying to get out of Lido's products, they're just going to get out at a massive discount or go through the withdrawal queue.
00:15:58.138 - 00:16:07.354, Speaker C: And I'm curious if, like, there really is only, you know, twelve to 13 million ETH available to trade on these exchanges and the rest is sort of just locked up for now.
00:16:07.474 - 00:16:50.108, Speaker B: Well, I wouldn't call it locked up, but it's not in a purely liquid state. And obviously there's an opportunity cost and the whales have realized that just holding it unstaked on an exchange cost you something, whether it's just the basic yield or the restaking bonuses or whatever else. Yeah, I mean, I converted my youth to meth, and I can use that for collateral in at least a few places. I think other people can use Steve in some places, maybe. So it makes sense. But if it was the same chart you showed and it was bitcoin, that would be much more impactful. Because those coins, like, when they're not on exchange, there's no defi.
00:16:50.108 - 00:17:15.337, Speaker B: There's no, like, maybe there's like WBTC or whatever, but there's no. There's not that much, you know, liquidity on chain. And so it does feel like that not being on exchange would, would matter. But ultimately it is a small door if real money is going to come in, and I think it will at some point. I keep hearing rumors. It's a bit annoying. Um, you never know what's real and what's not real.
00:17:15.337 - 00:17:25.057, Speaker B: Like, you know, x, y, z is planning to buy some shit coin, some like massive amount of coins one day. It'll be, it'll be true.
00:17:25.145 - 00:17:26.585, Speaker C: Let's just hope there are coins.
00:17:26.729 - 00:17:43.444, Speaker A: Yeah, well also Justin, I want to say like, you know, there are a few confounding factors too because obviously, you know, since FTX people have been less likely or less willing hold coins on exchange, might just hold it off exchange. So I do think the trends down. It's probably not as pronounced as what that chart shows.
00:17:43.944 - 00:18:02.044, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a great point. I mean, I think a better question is probably like what is the total amount of ETH on centralized exchanges plus the total amount of ETh just held in wallets? That's not in like a smart contract or staked. That would probably be like a more useful number. But I imagine that number is still going down. I mean the utility of ETH is still going up.
00:18:02.744 - 00:18:35.804, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean as Jordy said, the ETF's really do pull out supply out of these like these bitcoin ETF's pulled out like 15 billion supply out of the markets just sitting there. They don't trade anymore. So like these effects, I find it always really interesting to think about liquidity because like, you know, like the marginal barrel prices a lot and like you know as you approach like the local sort of supply, like the price doesn't move much but as soon as you can break past that and maybe go a little bit more like the price just starts going exponentially up. So we're like when one of those zones where it's like looking like we're.
00:18:35.844 - 00:18:38.220, Speaker C: Testing that local, the banana zone, but.
00:18:38.252 - 00:18:43.504, Speaker A: Yeah, and then if we end up like breaking through then it can really just, who knows where it'll go.
00:18:43.884 - 00:18:56.356, Speaker C: I am also reminded of that meme that sellers will always find more coins. You know, like the coins will. There will like, you know if we hit eight k, right? Like there's going to be so many people coming out of the woodwork to sell this thing.
00:18:56.540 - 00:18:58.060, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah I agree.
00:18:58.252 - 00:19:24.354, Speaker C: But so thicky. You think so like the Blackrock ETF has I think over 20 billion in funds now. Fastest ETF by like a long shot to hit 20 billion, which is amazing. But im curious, like how impactful is that really aside from just narrative for a trillion dollar plus asset. Is it really, this was like the marginal bitcoin that was purchased thats moved the price? Or is it more the narrative here that this is like the next big wave of technology coming?
00:19:25.374 - 00:19:53.604, Speaker A: I think so far its the narrative. Obviously, if you buy up like 2% of the supply of any coin, it's going to like, drastically affect how it trades. Yeah, a lot of it's just like narrative about like the nascent asset class and a lot of it's like speculating on other people buy. Yeah, but I mean, like, bitcoin's been really strong relative to pretty much everything recently. But, like, you know, altcoins have been lagging a little. Like tyke, do you think. Have you been looking at any interesting altcoins recently?
00:19:54.504 - 00:20:03.278, Speaker D: Not particularly. I'm, I staked a bunch of matic, which was not that great. So I'm starting to unwind that you.
00:20:03.286 - 00:20:05.766, Speaker A: Didn'T get the Tia airdrop? Another tia. The avail.
00:20:05.950 - 00:20:18.310, Speaker D: Oh, no. I mean, I got that airdrop. Like, that was the reason I staked it. And I was hoping for a few other airdrops, but it didn't really pan out. The avail drops gonna be really big for me, so. Or relatively big for me. So that's, that's pretty good.
00:20:18.310 - 00:20:21.334, Speaker D: So right now I'm like, just focused on, all you need is one.
00:20:21.374 - 00:20:21.954, Speaker A: Right?
00:20:22.614 - 00:20:48.636, Speaker D: All you need is one. Yeah. But right now I'm like, just airdrop farming. I feel like I don't really have an edge trading in the past 612 months. So I feel like my edge is just like, you know, airdrop farming, things are not diluted. And now I'm like, aggressively farming, er, five season two because the deadline for season two is the 30th of this month. So there's, you know, it doesn't take that much effort.
00:20:48.636 - 00:21:15.536, Speaker D: If you look at the amount of eth staked in eitherfi, it's going up only. So I'm not really sure how big it's going to be. But, you know, when I think about airdrop farming, I think about the potential size of the airdrop and the amount of effort I need to put in to, I guess, farm these airdrops. And I just don't think it's like that hard. So I'm like, just like punting a bunch of eth into wrapped eth. There's a lot of degenerate activity going on.
00:21:15.560 - 00:21:17.924, Speaker A: Actually, didn't you post about tio recently?
00:21:18.564 - 00:21:20.164, Speaker D: Oh, yeah. I'm still staking Tia.
00:21:20.324 - 00:21:20.924, Speaker C: Okay.
00:21:21.004 - 00:21:22.004, Speaker D: Oh, yeah. The slots.
00:21:22.044 - 00:21:22.276, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:21:22.300 - 00:21:29.332, Speaker D: I mean, I, if you stake Tia. You could have minted these slots for like $10 and now they're trading like five k. So I minted like, can.
00:21:29.348 - 00:21:31.384, Speaker C: I still mint those or I had some?
00:21:32.844 - 00:21:37.444, Speaker D: No, no, you could only mint it for like 2 hours. It minted out.
00:21:37.604 - 00:21:43.004, Speaker A: Remember when Jordy went on stream and just sold generational top of ta 21? Dude.
00:21:43.044 - 00:21:47.080, Speaker D: Yeah, I remember that. I was like, dude, let's liquidate Jody.
00:21:47.112 - 00:21:49.564, Speaker A: But yeah, I thought he was redacted for doing that.
00:21:50.064 - 00:22:15.734, Speaker C: Tyke, do you remember our conversation? We were talking about mantle versus tia and we were talking about like, which is the better opportunity cost? And I think mantle was like thirty cents and Tia was already at like $15 and I was like, yeah, maybe I'll pull up the screenshots if you don't believe me. I was like, look, maybe Tia, maybe Tia can two x from here, but like, you know, mental. This thing's probably going to a dollar. And sure enough it did.
00:22:15.894 - 00:22:20.206, Speaker B: The dollar magnet is always strong. Whenever you got similar to like.
00:22:20.390 - 00:22:23.994, Speaker C: But Ondo's blown past it, I think, and was going to the $10 magnet.
00:22:24.654 - 00:22:28.474, Speaker B: Hundred billion dollar FTV. That's your, that's your target for your bag.
00:22:29.094 - 00:22:29.854, Speaker C: Yes.
00:22:30.014 - 00:22:32.754, Speaker A: He's been right. What's been very right about Ando?
00:22:33.534 - 00:22:42.870, Speaker C: That's a brilliant. I mean, you just don't want to fade that team. Like, I feel like betting on teams in this space is the way to go versus, you know, narratives and whatnot. Tyke. I'm going to find this tweet, though.
00:22:42.942 - 00:22:51.070, Speaker B: You know, it feels like 100 billion is, uh. We haven't had a third coin at 100 billion, right?
00:22:51.262 - 00:22:55.742, Speaker C: No. File coins. File coin I see was like 500 billion.
00:22:55.878 - 00:23:11.970, Speaker B: The theoretical FTD. I mean, market cap. Yeah, like, I guess like everything. All this stuff is market cap flow. I am a little bit worried about the inevitable destruction in all these coins that you guys are mentioning. Tia. Like all the.
00:23:11.970 - 00:23:27.094, Speaker B: All these coins that have like a one year cliff for, for investors. Feels like the first ones have started with arbitrum and the next ones are continuing now. Don't want to give the full list of coins, but there's a lot of them.
00:23:28.434 - 00:23:31.898, Speaker A: It's like that meme of like the grim Reaper, like knocking on each coins.
00:23:31.946 - 00:23:32.482, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:32.618 - 00:23:35.334, Speaker A: Once they go through these cliffs, they're just like, they just died.
00:23:36.424 - 00:24:13.564, Speaker B: Yeah, we're seeing like some of them try to ask investors if they want to extend or like smooth it out. You know, not. Not to have like a sudden cliff. The worst cliff that I've ever seen was pith, which unlocked last month, like a few weeks ago, for how bad that cliff was, it actually held up quite well. Like, I don't know if jump stepped in and bought some or what happened, but somehow it. It kind of, like, survived. What I think it was more circulating was being released in the existing.
00:24:13.564 - 00:24:23.404, Speaker B: So it kind of did. Nothing happened, like, to 36 and then just bounced back up.
00:24:23.944 - 00:24:48.046, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it was like 130% cirque. But to be fair, like, when I saw this, I thought it was like an obvious short, but I looked at what was actually unlocking. Like, so much of it was validator rewards and, like, community and, like, the stuff that, like, only like 300 million of it was private, so. So it wasn't too bad, you know, like, I think a lot of the tokens didn't actually get sold and, you know, because it was listed on up it. Like, I think the Koreans, you know.
00:24:48.070 - 00:24:54.274, Speaker B: Absorbed a lot of it, might have absorbed some and lived to fight another day.
00:24:54.694 - 00:25:14.716, Speaker C: Jordy, like, can you actually tell us, like, you've seen this behind the scenes? Like, there's a big unlock event happening. Like, let's forget about, like, all the hedging and whatnot, but on the actual day it happened. A ton of coinage has to get sold. Like, what does that look like? Is that people, like, specifically calling market makers and selling to them at a discount? Is that just them hitting the books? Like, who's buying this stuff?
00:25:14.860 - 00:25:50.740, Speaker B: Some of it, like a month before they start trying to give it out to market makers at like a ten or 20% discount where it's just like, just take the bag and, like, you deal with it and the market maker is not going to dump it on day one because they want to get execution. So they'll, you know, they'll spend like two, three, four weeks probably getting out. The discount has to be big enough that, you know, you're taking some risk if you're going to just buy it. Some. Some of them don't sell. There's quite a few, like, VC's are notorious for just, like, not selling. And maybe they'll sell, like, when they have to, like, wind down the fund and like, do distributions.
00:25:50.740 - 00:26:02.856, Speaker B: Those are probably the VC's that you want on your cap table because they're taking like, the full bet on the full life cycle of the thing, which it's not for everybody. But, you know, I respect it.
00:26:02.960 - 00:26:06.808, Speaker C: It's admirable that they're playing a different game.
00:26:06.856 - 00:26:08.696, Speaker B: They're playing game and it's good.
00:26:08.720 - 00:26:11.688, Speaker A: They're very sensitive to their marks, so they don't want to fuck it over.
00:26:11.856 - 00:26:39.024, Speaker B: Yeah. And, like, for them, they're playing, like, a reputation game. Like, they get the access to, let's say, like, you're someone like polychain and you want to keep getting access to, like, the seed rounds of the big, you know, great companies. If they know that you just, like, hold, you make ev, not by, like, getting the best exit because you might, like, overhauled it, but you'll get the entry on the next one.
00:26:42.764 - 00:27:05.720, Speaker C: Like, with pits, specifically, if there was $100 million, let's say, of cell pressure on a given day, on the day on locked, rather, like, where are there actually, like, just normal buyers on the other side willing to absorb that? Like, let's say I had a $50 million pith bag that unlocked. I was a big investor, and I was ready to sell that day, and I didn't work with a market maker. Like, could I just unload that all over the course of 24 hours?
00:27:05.912 - 00:27:26.434, Speaker B: I mean, they never have a certain amount of dollars. They have a certain amount of coins, and at the current price, it might be, you know, $10. Once you start selling, the price goes down, and then you have less to sell in dollars because the price went, it becomes an easier problem. Now you don't have to absorb 100 million. You can just absorb 20 because it went down 80%.
00:27:26.774 - 00:27:34.662, Speaker C: So do you think, like, the average founder that finds themselves in these shoes, or the average investor, like, is their best bet to work with a market maker for a large size?
00:27:34.758 - 00:27:36.158, Speaker B: Depends, like, what you're trying to do.
00:27:36.206 - 00:27:38.234, Speaker A: Asking some interesting questions, Justin.
00:27:39.334 - 00:27:41.634, Speaker C: I'm just learning. We're learning together.
00:27:43.454 - 00:28:14.392, Speaker B: It's very interesting for a founder is, like, if you can get the people that want to cheat to get out at the lowest price that they're willing to take, just get them out the way. And so with these airdrops, it's the same dynamic market launches. There's a bunch of price insensitive sellers. Don't try to support the price. Just let it go to zero. If it goes to zero, they're selling it for $0, you're getting them off the cap, they're gone. It's fine.
00:28:14.392 - 00:28:37.206, Speaker B: Just let it happen, and then. And then go from there. So it's similar with these unlocks. I think you just have to survive it. Now, if there's other dynamics at play, and I don't know, there's, like, going to be on chain liquidations and stuff like that, then. Then you probably need to manage it more. But I don't know how many of those coins are like, curve, you know, that had, like, this big liquidation concern.
00:28:37.270 - 00:28:55.644, Speaker D: Yeah, I feel like this. This conversation just makes me slowly turn more bullish on, I guess, like, meme coins, you know, just pure degeneracy. I mean, you know, meme coins are less. I mean, it's not as fair as it seems, but I can definitely get behind, you know, why retail would rather, like, spy, maybe?
00:28:55.724 - 00:28:59.172, Speaker B: Let's talk about meme coins in the pasta segment, because I have a. I have a little.
00:28:59.228 - 00:29:00.020, Speaker D: All right, all right.
00:29:00.132 - 00:29:01.260, Speaker B: Meme coin pastas.
00:29:01.372 - 00:29:02.484, Speaker C: He's been cooking.
00:29:02.644 - 00:29:38.192, Speaker A: Well, I think. I think the whole, you know, obviously when something is unlocking, you basically can't touch it for, like, six months until, like, the jeeps get out and the chats come in. Like, you just gotta wait for lowest price and then you can buy it again. So, like, you know, for a lot of these, like, like, arbitrum, like, sui, like, these kind of coins that are actively unlocking, like, kind of just have to, like, let, like, you know, the forest burn down and have it grow back just for a few months. But, like, meme coins, like, everyone's saying, like, you know, these meme coins are fully vested. Like, it's very transparent. Like, there is no insider take or something like that.
00:29:38.192 - 00:29:56.758, Speaker A: But, like, that's also not true. Like, all these meme coins, like, these insiders just snipe it at the launch and they. You don't really know how much they have. A lot of times they have 1020, 30% of supply that they just, like, slowly sell into the. Into the pumps. Like, it's pretty much as bad as VC unlock. So I do think it's like a similar game that's getting played.
00:29:56.758 - 00:29:58.326, Speaker A: It's just less transparent.
00:29:58.430 - 00:30:26.504, Speaker B: It's different insiders. Yeah, it's just like, instead of insiders with suits, you got insiders with hoodies. And the reality is it's like someone's getting a low purchase price and that's their basis. Then, you know, they can take profit whenever and they don't care. So the best thing is if everyone has a high starting price, because if someone's selling below the starting price, they're just accepting a loss. No one's taking profit. It becomes a lot harder to have sell pressure.
00:30:27.004 - 00:30:56.884, Speaker D: I had one question for you guys. I remember when DyDX had that huge unlock. You were talking about it. It's been a pretty. I mean, it's been at least a couple months since the unlock happened, and it's basically trading flat. Do you think at some point things like do x ends up being a good long? Because it's probably, I mean, it's still one of the best products in terms of perks in crypto. And Defi still gets a bunch of usage despite not having a points program.
00:30:56.884 - 00:31:08.388, Speaker D: When does something like the OIDX become a good long? Is it still untouchable? How do you think about it for the traders like Dickey and Jordy? Like 1.6 billion. I mean, that's not bad.
00:31:08.576 - 00:31:31.424, Speaker A: It's actually like, you know, it's at 75% vested, it's like, it's like getting there and, you know, it's been washed out for so long. But both the narrative cycle and just, like, the price cycle, even though they're very correlated, I think these kind of setups are actually kind of interesting for long. I don't know what exactly ignites it, but, like, you know, it's one coin that, like, could be good.
00:31:32.164 - 00:32:11.906, Speaker C: Aren't you guys conflating, though, two things? Like, tyke, you're sort of asking. You're conflating two things, right? Which is the unlock schedule is perceived to be safe now. Like, I'm not going to get dumped on. But then you have this whole other question where, like, is this token actually a good investment? Right? And, like, those are, I think, two separate questions that require two, like, very different thought processes. And I think there's, there's clearly more to the story here than just the unlock schedule. Right? Like, can dydx compete when now we have ten other per platforms that are all taking market share. Like, surely I assume you guys wouldn't truly just buy this thing based on the perceived flows of unlocks, right? I don't know.
00:32:11.906 - 00:32:13.250, Speaker C: Maybe that's all you're trading thinking.
00:32:13.282 - 00:32:18.418, Speaker D: But I mean, technically there is cash flow, right? I mean, you can stake DoidX and get paid USDC.
00:32:18.586 - 00:32:24.458, Speaker B: That's part of the problem. It's like when you have a cash flow, then you're the mature ten x.
00:32:24.506 - 00:32:28.718, Speaker C: Dog instead of unlimited potential of revenue.
00:32:28.906 - 00:32:50.806, Speaker B: Yeah. And you look at the staking yield. The staking yield goes up if the token price goes down, because let's say, like, the rewards are in USDC, but if it's only like 5%, then it's hard to, it actually caps the price a little bit. Because if it goes up, then the staking yield goes down like 3%, and it's even worse. So the fundamentals get worse.
00:32:50.990 - 00:33:03.134, Speaker A: Do you have any thoughts, Jody? Like, I know you're, like, you market make on there. I'm sure you trade on there, too. Like, it hasn't been talked about in so long, especially with all this hyper liquid hype. Like, what are your thoughts on where Doidx is?
00:33:04.034 - 00:33:45.434, Speaker B: I mean, I told them when they changed the product from like a smooth, easy, centralized thing to like, an on chain, you know, you start to have to worry about front running and just different other on chain considerations. I understand a lot of the reasons they did it. You know, some of them probably were even, like, legal because the token becomes like an l one token, which is good for legal reasons. I think the liquidity isn't as much of an advantage on V four as it was on V three, where it just was by far the deepest liquid thing you could possibly find on chain. Like, you know, like off a centralized exchange. At the end of the day, I think they're very long term focus. They've already done well.
00:33:45.434 - 00:34:24.554, Speaker B: You know, it might. Price might have been flat, but all these, you know, early employees and everything, I'm sure, have a lot of tokens and they've done very well. And I think now we saw that Antonio stepped down a CEO. I think it's a sign that they're going to go after bigger, bigger fish and just like, not worry about the little squabbles, let's say, with. With the other Dex apps. And I think they might go after, like, full permissionless, maybe more like tri products, just go after a different market. And that kind of fits with their ethos, I think, of being avant garde.
00:34:24.554 - 00:34:36.766, Speaker B: Meanwhile, I think on the crypto native side, people talk more about hyper liquid and vertex and the more native players.
00:34:36.830 - 00:34:51.230, Speaker D: I think it's just so hard for these incumbents to compete because there's always these new products being funded and they can introduce points for like six months long periods, like, you know, like, what can they even do? You know, I guess there's so much.
00:34:51.422 - 00:35:09.754, Speaker B: I think all of them have some sort of points. I mean, even DyDx on D four still has. I think they extended the program. It was supposed to end, and they did. Like, they're doing another season. I think they're still worried about switching off completely. Funnily enough, on v three, they switched off completely because they tried to move people over to Dydx before.
00:35:09.754 - 00:35:24.154, Speaker B: And the old version has no incentives, but still trades quite a lot. So it was the first proof of product market fitting crypto with no fees, with no rewards, still making fees.
00:35:24.894 - 00:36:08.396, Speaker C: Jordy, I was going to ask you. I'm trying to find the tweet, but I saw a tweet that someone was saying a lot of the time the launch price is determined by market makers, centralized exchanges, et cetera, there's an attempt to find a fair value to launch the coin. It's. And this tweet said, I think it was an insider. I'm trying to find the tweet exactly who said it, but this tweet said that a lot of that is actually like the avo markets that are, you know, they have a Parps market for a token that's not yet trading is the reference price for the launch price. One, is there any truth to that? And then two, like, do you think there's any foul play going on here where people are like founders or teams are inflating the price of their pre launch token because the market is so illiquid to sort of get that launch price higher for their token when they launch on a secs.
00:36:08.540 - 00:37:02.214, Speaker B: Like 90% of the conspiracies of cabals and price setting is not true. I guess I would know at this point we're doing most of the launches, so we would know there's none of that going on. The only thing that you'll occasionally get pressure on the exchanges don't want FUD and they want their users to be happy. And if they thinking about what's going to make their users happy, they probably don't want that. Everyone's like, buy the coin and then it goes down. And that's been happening with some of, some of like the, you know, last three months where we haven't been in a full, full bull market. So we've seen some pressure from exchanges to try to get the projects to, I think, list at a price that's not going to be like too hard to sustain, whatever that means.
00:37:02.214 - 00:37:50.696, Speaker B: But most of its rent, it's not really predetermined. And like, these evil prices, they're sometimes wrong. Like we saw with the wormhole, it was trading like 18 or something, and it settled quite a bit lower. I think it's such a low volume and I'm sure there are some projects, I won't name some, but there's some that I think are probably manipulating the evil market just to try to anchor people higher. That seems unsustainable, but maybe it kind of works for a small segment of time. Ultimately, the price gets determined by how much hype you build and how much buying pressure there is. And especially if there's an airdrop, which most projects have an airdrop right now.
00:37:50.696 - 00:38:18.144, Speaker B: So there is a selling at the beginning, you couldn't want to make it 20 billion valuation. But like we talked about just ten minutes ago, the higher you put the valuation, the more the airdroppers are actually going to have to get absorbed. Yeah. Like all the launches I've seen, the initial price is more of like a balanced estimate of where it should be trading at. And then you just let it go with where the market wants it to go.
00:38:18.624 - 00:38:50.308, Speaker D: Yeah. Sometimes I talk to or I hear teams saying, hey, we're going to launch our token at better, more favorable market conditions, whatever that means. I feel like it's more favorable for them to launch at poor market conditions. Op launched when three ac was dying and then ever since op launched, it's been relatively higher highs and higher lows. I feel like if op launched in this market, it would launch at 20 billion FTB and the speed down only. I feel like that type of perception matters because if that happened, then I think you're right.
00:38:50.436 - 00:39:12.840, Speaker B: Better for the chart and for the early buyers. I think it's bad if you're trying to generate a lot of hype and you're the kind of project that needs the TgE for the hype. You want to have people talk about it. And if the market's dead, then no one's trading anyway. And you've missed your one opportunity to do a primary, primary go to market listing.
00:39:12.952 - 00:39:52.010, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think it's like so important. You know, it's why like, a lot of these, like traditional, just like web two companies, you know, really try to time when they ipo just because, you know, you want liquidity conditions to be good. And so much of where you start trading and where you end up trading just relies on a lot of, like, psychological factors. It's hard to, like, find a fundamental reason why tokens should launch it or just trade at like one, two or 3 billion. A lot of it's just like how the vibes are on that particular day. I mean, you can see recently, like, you know, in January, a lot of the new launches were just sending like immediately. And now, like, new launches are very dead.
00:39:52.010 - 00:40:15.484, Speaker A: Like, they're, a lot of these coins are like, trading at like maybe only two x. What they raised the last funding round that where as opposed to, like, you know, in January they would just instantly go ten x 20 x. So it really changes, you know, where you start trading at. And it's a lot easier to start high and try to stay high versus, like, start low and convince new people to buy like a month later.
00:40:16.224 - 00:41:23.084, Speaker B: Yeah, there's no perfect strategy, but there is, there is mistakes and I would say the biggest mistake I see is trying to go too high from the beginning and you use the wrong comp and you think, you know, like, oh, Jupiter is trading at 12 billion and we're kind of doing a little bit of what they're doing in one of the categories. So we should trade at 4 billion. Like, trying to, trying to anchor people too high can disappoint the community and just alienate, alienate some people. So I would generally still say that being happy with lower and just letting it, letting it go above expectations, it's all about relative to expectations. There's two coins that are both trading around like a billion. One of them, I think, was expecting to launch at 3400 and the other one at like three, 4 billion. And they're at the same price, but completely different happiness levels for everybody involved just based on the anchoring.
00:41:24.564 - 00:41:51.662, Speaker D: Yeah, it's funny how, you know, diggie, you mentioned that in all these launches, it kind of depends on how people feel. Like during the time, it's all dependent on vibes. And I feel like, you know, despite markets being relatively good, I feel like the vibes have been negative even. You know, we had Vitalik retweets that, you know, like the Luna tweet from Ansem. I thought that was crazy. Like, why is Vitalik doing that? Like, I feel like that just. Yeah, that's literally his top tweet.
00:41:51.662 - 00:42:07.554, Speaker D: Isn't this like a bad look? I feel like even, like the Justin Drake versus Anatoly, you know, Pinkfist interview thing, Justin Drake just sounded angry, like, the entire time. I know, I know. You watched it, Justin. Like, what were your takeaways from that entire conversation?
00:42:07.934 - 00:42:29.918, Speaker C: Yeah. First to touch on the Vitalik retweet, it's a little out of character. I mean, to some degree, I see where it's coming from. Like, the ethereum ecosystem feels like there's no leader when Solana has anatoly. Like, all of these other ecosystems have a leader and Vitalik has sort of stepped back. And so I think, like, to some degree, people are looking forward to this and they want to see this. But I agree.
00:42:29.918 - 00:43:20.248, Speaker C: Like, you know, for a chain that does try to sit like, it seems like the eth ecosystem is on a little bit of a high horse and then to, you know, sort of stoop down to this level is a little unnecessary in my view. As far as this bankless podcast goes, I actually really recommend you guys all listen to it. You know, you can listen to it on 1.5 x two x speed. Actually, I learned a lot from the podcast and I came away with like a pretty interesting takeaway. So my thoughts are basically that, like, Ethereum has basically accepted that there's these trade offs that you actually can't solve for, and they're going to accept those trade offs and try to mitigate the downside of those trade offs with their scaling strategy. And then Solana takes the complete opposite approach, which is basically that, like, there are these problems today, but we're going to try to build towards a future where we don't have to make any compromises.
00:43:20.248 - 00:43:58.184, Speaker C: And all of this can be done on a monolithic l one, which is objectively better, right, than a fragmented ecosystem, if it were technically possible. And of course, the podcast goes into greater detail. It's very technical, above my head, but I think they do do a pretty good job of breaking it down. And Anatoly is the better debater here. He makes a better case for Solana than Justin makes for Ethereum. And we were talking a little bit about this in pre show, but Tyche, I think you made the joke that Ethereum is becoming cardano. Obviously you don't mean that earnestly, but like, Ethereum feels very research heavy, very like PhD focused, like people are writing papers.
00:43:59.164 - 00:44:00.984, Speaker D: Well, I own big bags.
00:44:01.484 - 00:44:31.362, Speaker C: I'll let him speak for himself. I don't want to upset anyone, any listeners. But yeah, I thought it was a really interesting podcast. I don't know exactly where I stand yet. I mean, for a person like myself who is not an engineer, but like fairly technical, or at least very much in the weeds of crypto, you kind of come away from this thinking like, there really is no way for someone at my technical level to actually come to my own conclusion on what's the best technical way to solve these problems. And so to some degree, you sort of have to like pick your, pick your fighter. Yeah, pick your fighter.
00:44:31.418 - 00:44:40.354, Speaker B: Are you choosing based on like likeability as well, though? Because like Anatoly is like so likable and he's like, he's got the advantage there.
00:44:40.394 - 00:45:09.804, Speaker C: I mean, I found, I think he is likable. I found them both equally likable. If you listen to the whole episode, like, Justin Drake is pretty measured, whereas Anatoly is like interrupting him a lot. Like, I found them equally likable. I thought they both had great points, they both had some pretty weak points, but I tried to take that part out of it. But like, I really do think it is about choosing your fighter because we, like, none of the four of us, can probably know with any certainty, which is the best technical path forward, if even these two guys don't know with certainty. Right.
00:45:10.664 - 00:46:18.394, Speaker B: The other thing that I think is completely wrong and people don't seem to understand is unless there's like a ten x improvement at the end of like, the two paths, there's a lot of path dependency. And, you know, I talked about this when the Ethereum merge was happening, there was so much work for years being put into the proof of stake merge from proof of work, when literally, you know, they could have just like spawned up a new blockchain and it would, you know, there's like a million proof of stake blockchains. Like, why go through all the work? And it's because there's a lot of value in the existing state. And the value of state, what does it mean? It just means like, mainly here's who owns what? And here's what's been built on there. The first part actually is like very important. Like the, on the Ethereum blockchain, we've had ten years to kind of determine like, you know, who owns the coins and where are they. And like, it's like a distribution that society sort of accepts because it's played through a lot of like, events.
00:46:18.394 - 00:46:32.998, Speaker B: And for something to, like, not be ten x better and try to take the same role would be quite challenging. Otherwise, you know, they wouldn't have done all this, like, proof of stake merge. They would have just started a new blockchain.
00:46:33.126 - 00:47:09.312, Speaker C: Yeah. Jordy, I think you touched on what I think are Anatoly's two weakest arguments. The first argument he basically lays out, or not the first argument he lays out, it's actually towards the end of the podcast, but he basically says, none of, none of this TVL, none of this history and legacy that Ethereum has really is that relevant. And Solana's gonna win regardless of that. And then the other thing he really makes the case for that I think falls apart to is he like actually says he doesn't understand this concept of like non state money. So he's not a bitcoin fan. He doesn't think Ethereum can compete on moneyness, and he thinks it shouldn't compete on moneyness, it should only compete on execution.
00:47:09.312 - 00:47:16.604, Speaker C: And I think those are his two weakest arguments, which you sort of pointed out as well. But I would say the rest he does pretty well on, in the debate.
00:47:17.264 - 00:47:41.564, Speaker B: Yeah, we talked about this when we did this lana episode with Austin. I think the view for Solana is something different from Ethereum. So I think they're different products. They should be looked at differently. They have different upsides. I think for Solana, the coin itself is a community coin. But if you listen to anatoly carefully, it's the applications on Solana that should be accruing most of the value, and that's what he's driving towards.
00:47:41.564 - 00:47:56.094, Speaker B: And Solana is a kind of meme coin over that community, which maybe is valuable. Like meme coins are valuable, we're seeing. So I don't think Solana is going to have a claim to the money ness of, like, a macro asset.
00:47:57.114 - 00:48:22.508, Speaker C: You know, there's one other thing Anatoly said, which really, I think, missed the mark. And again, I don't mean to just pick the bad, because I think he did a great job. But the other thing, he. He really tried to hammer home this point that issuance wasn't an expense to the chain, which I think is just patently false. And he made the comparison that, well, if someone has apple stock and they sell it, is that an expense to Apple? He said it's not. It actually is, though. If Apple ever wants to issue stock again, they're doing it at a lower price now.
00:48:22.508 - 00:48:34.304, Speaker C: And the same is true with Solana. Right? Like, for Solana to issue, when they have to issue coins, if there's a lot of sell pressure from previous issuance, they have to issue more coinage, theoretically. So that, I thought, missed the mark.
00:48:34.424 - 00:48:38.256, Speaker A: It goes to stakers, so it stays in the ecosystem. Just that it's not stakers.
00:48:38.280 - 00:48:38.416, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:38.440 - 00:48:45.264, Speaker A: It's not, like real. It, like, kills the price, but, like, it's not, like real if you're older. It's like you don't care.
00:48:45.384 - 00:48:45.712, Speaker B: Right.
00:48:45.768 - 00:48:49.564, Speaker C: Well, it's an expense, though, right? Like the stakers people are presumably selling.
00:48:50.114 - 00:48:54.254, Speaker A: No, why would they? Are you selling your steak, eth?
00:48:55.354 - 00:49:05.054, Speaker C: I mean, I will at some point. You have. Right? Of course. I said before 2025.
00:49:06.874 - 00:49:07.922, Speaker B: You said you're.
00:49:07.938 - 00:49:08.426, Speaker D: It's like.
00:49:08.530 - 00:49:26.814, Speaker C: The point is everyone has to. Yeah, exactly. Everyone has to sell at some point, though, right? Like this myth. I mean, maybe with bitcoin, people are sort of at this point where, you know, they have so much, they're literally never going to sell. But for the rest of the world, like, and for these stakers that are running businesses, like in the inst, everyone has to sell at some price.
00:49:27.914 - 00:49:32.146, Speaker A: I can't believe you're going to sell your eth, Justin. This is like news to me.
00:49:32.330 - 00:49:35.574, Speaker C: The day shall come. I'll let you know. Vicki, after.
00:49:38.154 - 00:49:41.442, Speaker D: My entire opinion, you have changed. Just kidding.
00:49:41.618 - 00:50:11.388, Speaker B: Bottom line, like, in summary, I think bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are all completely different products. They have a different downside and upside and these, like, ratios. And trying to look at the ratios, I think it's just a waste of time. Like, it's great that we have diversified bets with plus EV in the space, and you can just own multiple things. And, you know, you don't necessarily have to choose a fighter. In a sense, you can choose multiple fighters and be diversified. And that's the diversification.
00:50:11.388 - 00:50:26.764, Speaker B: Is Alpha. Like, people think it's. It's just like being risk averse, whatever. But actually, it is Alpha. You can look at the math of it, and it is Alpha. It allows you to bet more. Basically, if you look at it, if you're going to keep cash, you can keep less cash.
00:50:26.764 - 00:50:37.372, Speaker B: If you're diversified across multiple coins that have different scenarios that will play out macro wise and other factors, it actually gives you more upside.
00:50:37.468 - 00:50:40.344, Speaker C: Overall, it's probably the best alpha of the show.
00:50:42.314 - 00:50:43.894, Speaker A: Should we move on to pastas?
00:50:44.754 - 00:50:45.786, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:50:45.930 - 00:50:49.414, Speaker A: All right, who wants to go first? Tyke, you go first.
00:50:50.234 - 00:51:25.954, Speaker D: So I thought this was in line with Jordy being at Vegas. The world series of poker. There's, like, this picture. Can you zoom in on the right one? But, like, apparently, like, Tiger woods is playing poker and he just looks so defeated. I feel like this kind of reminds me of the tweets. Like, bitcoin at 60, 60k, like, you know, 2023, and, like, bitcoin at, it's like the same thing, but everyone's vibe is, like, slowly deteriorate. I feel like the entire crypto community require, like, the price needs to go up for people to, like, maintain the same level of happiness.
00:51:25.954 - 00:51:31.718, Speaker D: And sometimes I feel like this. So, you know. Yeah, I feel like, jacked he is.
00:51:31.846 - 00:51:33.222, Speaker B: I know he's so jacked.
00:51:33.238 - 00:51:34.110, Speaker C: The steroids.
00:51:34.262 - 00:51:58.042, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw this, and, like, I saw the comments. A lot of people were like, man, this is hitting, like, really close to home. You know, we're all aging, and we remember this, like, the number one. And actually, like, when I was playing on day one, Phil Ivey just, like, sat on my table and I had a little moment of, you know, he looks a little bit like tiger woods. But the thing, the good thing, Phyllis, because I think when you look at this, the main issue is the hair.
00:51:58.178 - 00:51:59.894, Speaker C: Like, he's just got to shave it off.
00:52:00.674 - 00:52:13.090, Speaker B: Come on, tiger. One way or another, just. Just can't have this look little. Get a. Get like a transplant or just shave it. Just go. I think he's always, you know, he's done the Michael Jordan.
00:52:13.090 - 00:52:23.654, Speaker B: He's just go for it. So he doesn't have. There's no before and after. Like, it's just. It's just Phil Ivy. And so he's avoided the Tiger woods treatment.
00:52:24.714 - 00:52:26.974, Speaker A: Does this Phil ivy have hair, or is he like.
00:52:27.654 - 00:52:33.078, Speaker B: I don't think so. I mean, he wears a cap. I don't know. But, like, at least it's. It's like he's not doing the little thing.
00:52:33.166 - 00:52:34.554, Speaker A: Just decide to go bald.
00:52:34.934 - 00:52:41.154, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, we can't all have thicky, lush hair, you know, we gotta. Gotta pay the handward dealt.
00:52:43.054 - 00:52:47.234, Speaker A: I like that one. All right, you're up next, Justin.
00:52:47.734 - 00:53:22.784, Speaker C: All right, so I was talking a little bit about that soul leaf debate, and I was reminiscing when there was really only one show in town, and that was ethanol, and everything happened on Mainnet, and everyone had to pay the piper, everyone had to pay our eth tax. Those were good times. And someday I think I'm going to talk to my kids like this bold Leonidas tweet. These are going to be my little ones sitting there, son. The gas would be dollar 250, but you just say, fuck it, and approve the transaction anyway. These were simpler times, right? Better times when everything was on main net. If you wanted to play around, you had to pay the tax, and it didn't matter.
00:53:22.784 - 00:53:26.084, Speaker C: We were all making so much money. You could pay $250 of gas.
00:53:27.104 - 00:53:50.252, Speaker B: I mean, it's good, but, like, when. By the time you have, like, kids to talk about this stuff with, coffee is going to be $250. Like, I feel like so much, you know, I remember 250 used to be a lot of money. And you could get, like, a five star, like, amazing hotel and some dinner, and it's not the case now.
00:53:50.268 - 00:53:51.784, Speaker C: It's like a bottle of wine.
00:53:52.924 - 00:53:53.692, Speaker A: Like a banana.
00:53:53.748 - 00:53:56.492, Speaker B: Now, wait, do you guys think there.
00:53:56.508 - 00:54:02.508, Speaker D: Will be, like, a period, like, let's say, like a prolonged, feel, like a week straight period where eat mean, that gas is gonna be like, let's say 100.
00:54:02.596 - 00:54:03.676, Speaker B: Do you think that's, like.
00:54:03.700 - 00:54:06.012, Speaker C: Are those times maybe. I don't know.
00:54:06.108 - 00:54:06.828, Speaker B: Might be gone already.
00:54:06.876 - 00:54:11.172, Speaker A: Coming up now. It's like. It actually looks pretty good for the past two days.
00:54:11.308 - 00:54:12.384, Speaker D: It's at 20.
00:54:13.644 - 00:54:19.032, Speaker C: We're celebrating like it's a five.
00:54:19.088 - 00:54:21.360, Speaker D: I know, I know. It's deflationary.
00:54:21.432 - 00:54:22.084, Speaker B: Yes.
00:54:22.864 - 00:54:29.204, Speaker C: Just think about how many transactions Blackrock is gonna have to do every day. Maybe. Maybe two to five.
00:54:31.464 - 00:54:34.296, Speaker A: All right, I'll go next. I'll say Jody's for last.
00:54:34.440 - 00:54:35.484, Speaker B: What is this?
00:54:37.544 - 00:54:52.196, Speaker A: This is like a dating app. And then, like, all the. All the hot chicks, which were obviously fake, are like. Then you just paste the ca dot dot dot. I think it's like a great way to market your shit coin. Just go and bumble with a fake hot chick and then just get them to buy chicky.
00:54:52.220 - 00:54:56.060, Speaker C: You know? This isn't bumble. You know very well. This is inch. Oh, right.
00:54:56.092 - 00:54:57.384, Speaker A: It's hinge. You're right.
00:54:58.244 - 00:54:59.784, Speaker D: Only Justin knows that.
00:55:04.004 - 00:55:05.504, Speaker A: Justin's a dog.
00:55:12.604 - 00:55:15.304, Speaker C: He's like, should we move to Jordi's pasta?
00:55:16.884 - 00:55:38.024, Speaker B: All right, I got, you know, Iggy launched the launch them launched the meme coin. It looked like a bit of a. Just like a shit show. Usual kind of celebrity stuff. However, so far, she has been redeeming herself with some a tier shitposting. I don't know who's doing it. Her team, her.
00:55:38.024 - 00:55:59.656, Speaker B: I don't know what's going on, but this stuff has just been butter is being with this chart, which is a beautiful chart. Apparently we're touching 150 million market cap or so. I'm seeing like a second. What's that?
00:55:59.760 - 00:56:02.004, Speaker A: Like? It's sexless soon. Oh, my God.
00:56:02.994 - 00:56:11.714, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, she, she wanted to feed a little hangry. Vitalik here. Come to mother, mother's milk.
00:56:11.794 - 00:56:14.374, Speaker C: Is that why Vitalik snaps and reflects?
00:56:16.394 - 00:56:17.494, Speaker A: It might be.
00:56:19.274 - 00:56:25.546, Speaker B: I mean, this is a tier stuff. You know, you got million views, thousands of likes and comics.
00:56:25.610 - 00:56:40.314, Speaker C: But then did you see, like, there's this whole, like, twitter battle of, like, Hayden from Uniswap and some other people, like, talking about whether this is net positive for the industry and, like, making that a whole big deal. And there's really not much to talk about when this is what we're talking about, you know?
00:56:40.694 - 00:57:06.046, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of what you guys were saying with the purists and the non purists. And there's a lot of us that are just like, okay, this is entertaining. I mean, sometimes I don't, like, fully fundamentally agree with the underlying stuff, but I can appreciate, like, a good shit post as much as anyone else. Like, we had Andre Gracha from DWF, you know, doing the fucking line charts in the. In the skylines and stuff. And, you know, I respect. I respect the shitposting I saw.
00:57:06.046 - 00:57:16.118, Speaker B: Even Gany from Wintermute said he's gonna be Team Izzy Iggy. So not everyone is. Is on the Hayden purist camp.
00:57:16.286 - 00:57:22.074, Speaker A: I was worried when you said it was an e post. You're gonna show us the tweet of her, like, you know, of her ass.
00:57:26.694 - 00:57:35.484, Speaker B: I don't subscribe to the onlyfans of Biggie. Apparently, that. That's. That's where most of our audiences is. That right? Is anyone.
00:57:36.384 - 00:57:36.912, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:57:36.928 - 00:57:37.208, Speaker B: Jessica?
00:57:37.216 - 00:57:37.804, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:57:38.464 - 00:57:40.296, Speaker A: $50 million off that thing.
00:57:40.400 - 00:57:40.920, Speaker B: It's crazy.
00:57:40.952 - 00:57:41.528, Speaker D: Really?
00:57:41.696 - 00:57:42.016, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:42.040 - 00:57:45.204, Speaker C: Off the shitcoin of onlyfans. Oh, wow.
00:57:46.424 - 00:58:06.682, Speaker B: It feels like OnlyFans is the same of. It's like the monetization route for. For a celebrity or, like, concerts. It's not the actual fame. Like, the musicians don't make that much money on the streaming. It's, like going out and having, like, million people pay $50. Who won pasta, by the way? Are we.
00:58:06.682 - 00:58:09.202, Speaker B: How are we determining thiccy? Are you. You gotta. You gotta do it.
00:58:09.218 - 00:58:20.170, Speaker A: Then should you just leave it up to audience vote? The thing is, like, we don't get, like, the. We have to, like, revisit last week's pasta on next week's episode, but then.
00:58:20.202 - 00:58:22.686, Speaker C: Could be a good way to start the show, you know, a little icebreaker.
00:58:22.770 - 00:58:24.238, Speaker A: It kind of breaks the ice.
00:58:24.286 - 00:58:25.486, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:58:25.590 - 00:58:26.158, Speaker B: Okay.
00:58:26.246 - 00:58:27.606, Speaker D: Okay, we'll do the next week.
00:58:27.670 - 00:58:28.126, Speaker B: Let's set up.
00:58:28.150 - 00:58:28.998, Speaker C: Vote in the comments.
00:58:29.126 - 00:58:31.926, Speaker B: Let's set up a poll on our Twitter, and.
00:58:32.110 - 00:58:33.406, Speaker A: Yeah, we're gonna do the Twitter polls.
00:58:33.430 - 00:58:40.110, Speaker B: That's a good idea. All right. Brad's gonna set it up. Cool. Thanks for hosting, Vicki. You got. We got to do it.
00:58:40.110 - 00:58:41.958, Speaker B: You got to do this again. It was a good one.
00:58:42.046 - 00:58:42.726, Speaker A: Glad you liked it.
00:58:42.750 - 00:58:45.334, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, sticky. Cool.
