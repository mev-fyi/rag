00:00:00.600 - 00:00:02.550, Speaker A: Are you an ETH guy? BTC.
00:00:02.742 - 00:00:05.830, Speaker B: I am more ether than anything else.
00:00:06.022 - 00:00:08.086, Speaker A: All right. I've got a friend for Justin.
00:00:08.150 - 00:00:09.354, Speaker C: Justin's happy.
00:00:10.574 - 00:00:15.110, Speaker B: I'll say. It's also, like, really, like, you know, it sucked the last year or two, being.
00:00:15.182 - 00:00:21.478, Speaker A: It's been terrible, but that's when you know it's good, right? Like this. You don't want to buy when everyone's euphoric. You want to buy when there's blood.
00:00:21.646 - 00:00:24.286, Speaker D: Jody, don't you have ETH, too? Or does that change?
00:00:24.470 - 00:00:30.083, Speaker C: Listen, like, of course I have meth, right? Like, my math bag is never going away. I'm never selling method.
00:00:30.083 - 00:00:30.560, Speaker D: We lost.
00:00:30.592 - 00:00:33.644, Speaker C: We're gonna have to wait a little bit. We're gonna have to wait a little bit.
00:00:34.624 - 00:00:38.884, Speaker A: There's more than just the ETF. There's other reasons to like the soldier today.
00:01:02.034 - 00:01:25.058, Speaker C: Welcome to steady labs, everybody. I'm Jordy, the founder of Salina Capital. As usual, we have Justin, CEO of Astario, with us. We have Vicki. Glad to have you here. Thiki, my quant adopted son slash quant father, depending on which YouTube comment you check. And instead of our humble farmer this week, we have the grandfather of farming instead.
00:01:25.058 - 00:02:00.862, Speaker C: So we've upgraded. We have Robert Leshner. How are you, Robert GM, everybody? Well, you know, we were talking in the pre show, you were saying that you're not taking credit for yield farming as a concept, even though, you know, compound obviously was a large part of that Defi summer kickoff. I think it would be amazing to kind of look back into what happened in that really exciting days. When I remember, like, reading tweets about defi, I didn't even know if you pronounce it defi or defi. Cause it was just written down, like, nobody knew. Do you feel nostalgic about those days? Or, like, when you look back, how do you feel?
00:02:00.998 - 00:02:57.746, Speaker B: Oh, I feel totally nostalgic for those days. I mean, you know, the whole defi summer where we sort of saw compound and then we saw yearn and we saw curve and we saw sushi, and we saw, like, a bunch of other projects all launch at the same time, each one trying something radically different and putting their own flavor on? Defi summer was just a really special time. And in a lot of ways, I feel like right now, in 2024, we're starting to see that again, where we're seeing these really interesting new launches of tokens through farming or user based activity or however you want to frame it again, that are really exciting. And I almost think that we are in this moment that feels a lot like 2020 here in March of 24.
00:02:57.810 - 00:03:17.162, Speaker C: I mean, for the poker players among us. I know thiki dabbles in the cards and Tykyu is not here, but it reminds me that 2020 was, like the 2003 moneymaker days where people were just randomly guessing. It was just intuition. Does this make sense? New token vampire attack. What? A pool two tokens worth. Nobody knew.
00:03:17.218 - 00:03:17.722, Speaker B: Pool two.
00:03:17.778 - 00:03:41.048, Speaker C: Yeah, the pool two. I think right now, like, this cycle where we're maybe like, 2010 2014 poker, where, you know, some people have done some research. They figured out, like, there's some training, but we're not at the AI GTO kind of, like, level. There's still, like, incredible inefficiencies as long as you're willing to put in the work. Do you feel that's sort of a good analogy?
00:03:41.226 - 00:04:21.964, Speaker B: Yes, I do. I think, you know, people forget that even in that, like, 2020 era, there still was, like, some level of professionalization of this. Like, you know, FTX and Alameda were, like, aggressively farming things at, like, industrial scale with, like, quants doing all the numbers. There was, like, tools for individuals, like, vfat and stuff that, like, calculated all of the, you know, deep, you know, calculations that, like, most people wouldn't want to spreadsheet on their own. Like, there were, like, very sophisticated actors. Like, even in 2020, you know, and I don't think it was, like, total gut driven. I think for a lot of users, it was just, like, gut driven.
00:04:21.964 - 00:04:30.500, Speaker B: Like, oh, this is also, like, you know, like, I'm not going to run any math at all. But, like, even then, there was, like, some real deep math happening.
00:04:30.572 - 00:04:40.594, Speaker C: You would look at the APY number, and the APY number would just, like, assume certain price of a pool two token, and just tell you, like, yeah, you're getting 400%. Like, click.
00:04:41.894 - 00:05:26.134, Speaker B: Right? But there was, like, I mean, I personally remember, like, I had friends who were building pretty sophisticated models which basically had, like, token admission schedules and decay and, like, Dex liquidity and, like, apy projections by the hour and, like, all of these things. So as, like, new projects launched. Like, there was this, like, squad of people that were, like, had a leg up where they were like, okay, like, I'm gonna move my capital, which is limited from, you know, sushi to basis cash to, you know, whatever the next one was, to, like, you know, yams to, like, because they were all occurring at the same time. And so, like, you basically had to have this, like, understanding in real time of, like, you know, what did everything yield?
00:05:26.554 - 00:05:56.278, Speaker A: I wanted to ask you about this, Robert, because I was in all of those farms as well. But this was when I was just getting onboarded into crypto in early 2020. And at the time, I didn't have the cynicism I have today where I was, you know, like, in something, like, basis cash. And I was, like, farming it with the understanding that maybe this could actually work. And I still haven't gotten to the bottom of, like, was I. Was I the guy you were dumping on, or did everyone have that optimism? So, like, as someone on the inside, did you have that optimism, or were you cynical about it?
00:05:56.406 - 00:06:17.780, Speaker B: No, I was also overly optimistic. Like, this is going to sound ridiculous, and you can make fun of me all you want. I actually thought that yams could have been a global currency, and I was really excited about it. I was like, oh, this is like, a fair launch, you know, currency. Just like bitcoin was like, what if, you know?
00:06:17.932 - 00:06:23.612, Speaker A: Well, now I feel so much better, because, like, if you didn't know, then I can't be mad at myself for not knowing.
00:06:23.788 - 00:06:29.610, Speaker B: Yeah. When you look back in hindsight, you're like, oh, my God. Like, how could anyone think the yams were going to be, like, an actual currency?
00:06:29.732 - 00:06:45.194, Speaker C: But even this cycle, I mean, we're seeing Solana meme coins use the same argument. Like, oh, why wouldn't this be the next BTC? It's the same. Same thing as BTC thicky. Have you been buying any Solana meme coin?
00:06:45.734 - 00:07:03.720, Speaker D: I haven't, but I wanted to ask. I wanted to ask Robert if he's, like, what his thoughts are on. Like, I think back, I wasn't around in 2020, but I felt like there was a lot more optimism on, like, the technical capabilities of what we were building compared to now, where it feels more cynical. I'm curious if you have any thoughts on that.
00:07:03.832 - 00:07:41.454, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, especially when it comes to meme coins, I think the whole thing is much more cynical. It's not about technology at all. There's not even, like, no one's even pretending like there's an innovation here. It's one icon of a token. Symbol is a little bit cuter or a little bit sillier or more offensive than some other one, therefore it should create value. It's like, it's a pretty ridiculous concept, and I definitely think that is a totally different. I'm not going to say irrational, because in a lot of ways, it is rational, but it's a totally different way of thinking about what is an asset in general.
00:07:41.454 - 00:09:01.434, Speaker B: When you really zoom out, pretty much any asset, like, bitcoin like any of these, there's a social consensus that creates its value. There's a lot more justification for the social consensus around bitcoin as why bitcoin is special or valuable or whatever. But at the end of the day, most assets are based on social consensus, whether it's using, like, seashells as a currency, or, like, whether it's bitcoin or whether it's, like, a fiat currency, or whether it's bank, or whether it's, you know, shib. And I think that's, like, the one sort of, like, lining of truth to it that gives it value is, like, well, everything's made up. Like, you know, what separates, you know, book of meme from bitcoin from fiat? You know? And it goes like the original arguments of crypto in general, which is like, oh, it's all made up, you know, therefore, this one's even better. It's disappointing to me because, like, you know, it ignores everything else that makes even something like bitcoin or, like, fiat or, like, whatever valuable, and it just focuses on the, like, why not this with no other arguments? It's, like, with no other, like, positive attributes at all besides, like, oh, I have an offensive cartoon character. And so, like, I definitely think, like, the whole thing is tongue in cheek.
00:09:01.434 - 00:09:33.360, Speaker B: I don't think that, like, this has staying power. I think in the moment, you know, people are having a lot of fun, and, you know, a lot of short term value gets created in the same way that, like, everyone can bet on GameStop at the same time and drive GameStop up, and everyone cheers and says, like, right. Like, you know, we're good investors because, like, we all bought the same asset at the same time. But that doesn't create any staying power. It doesn't create long term value. It is a shelling point. And if everyone agrees to buy the same, you know, slightly offensive meme coin, then everybody wins.
00:09:33.472 - 00:09:45.670, Speaker C: It's not everybody wins. Like, it's like, everybody, like, prints, like, a high p and l number temporarily, which, you know, unwinds as soon as, like, people try to make it real dollars. And that's sort of, like, where the thing kicks in.
00:09:45.862 - 00:10:24.594, Speaker A: Robert, I wanted to ask you sort of building on Thickie's question a bit. So when we started this show about 35 weeks ago, this is the 35th episode, we were just coming out of the bear market, but it wasn't clear yet. And Tyke and I were incorrectly theorizing that to sort of bring us out of a bear market, we needed to see new applications that brought users on and added utility. And in some ways, like going back to our convo about 2020, like, it seems like we've done the reverse. Like, in 2020, 2021, we had things that had a seed or inkling of utility but didn't really pan out. Now it seems like we've reverted where we're not even going to pretend like we have good apps. We're just going to bet on coins and meme coins, et cetera.
00:10:24.594 - 00:10:31.554, Speaker A: How does that make you feel? Are you seeing projects that are exciting you beyond just, like, new meme coin of the week on Solana?
00:10:32.134 - 00:11:29.598, Speaker B: Absolutely. So I think this is, like, where there's a chasm between retail or new people coming into crypto today and the people that are working in the space full time and investing in this space. Yes. If you're coming into the space right now, the shiniest object is going to be meme coins on Solana, and you're not going to take the time to learn about anything else because other things aren't going from zero market cap to $700 million market cap in 12 hours. Only in the meme coin land can things go from zero to $700 million based on absolutely nothing. For a project that's like hours old and that is the shiniest object. But just because there's that incredibly shiny object that honestly is pretty vaporous doesn't mean there's not exciting things happening in, like, the real tech world or, like, the real tech that, like, will create more actual long term value.
00:11:29.598 - 00:12:01.492, Speaker B: Right? And there's, like, still tons of stuff, tons of teams that are focused on, like, actual, like, creating value, making innovations, releasing new l one s, new l two s, new applications, new everything that are being ignored, which is okay because, like, markets are long term weighing machines between value and value less. And, like, it just means it's, you know, it's going to be a slower, more lucrative win for the projects that are actually, like, building things that are important.
00:12:01.588 - 00:12:52.560, Speaker C: The reminder in this kind of meme point season is that the speculation game, the casino game, is so huge. You know, I look, I remember, like, years ago looking at the Vegas versus Macau versus, you know, all the different gambling revenues yearly, and it's all, you know, Singapore's 15 billion and cows 15. It's all, like, around that area, like 15 billion. And you look at what's potentially, like, the best casino right now, you know, betting on, like, random coins, and you look at the market cap of these things and it kind of falls in line into what you would expect for the global demand for this type of gambling. And what Solana has shown is that right now, in the current status, it has the best casino ground floor for those games to exist. So one is the wallet metamask versus Phantom. Maybe it's just a smoother experience for this specific use case.
00:12:52.560 - 00:13:17.022, Speaker C: I'm not saying it's better, better overall, just, like, for this use case, maybe like the Dexs, you know, uniswap versus whatever, Jupiter or, you know, I guess there's like a orca and radium, whatever is. I'm not too much, like, into these things to know exactly, but is it sort of like a weighing machine saying, like, right now, in this point in time, this is. This is just like the smoothest casino.
00:13:17.198 - 00:13:56.506, Speaker B: Right now, the Solana casino. Besides, like, some intermittent, like, block delays and some weird issues around, like, everyone, like, having transactions revert because, you know, they're out of slippage bounds and all this stuff. Like, it is the smoothest user experience right now, especially for retail, like, in general and Ethereum. L two is this is, like, rapidly improving when it comes to transaction costs. And you might actually start to see this, like, inversion between where's, like, degenerate demand. Like, oh, you know, it's back to l two s. But, like, right now, it's on Solana as the focal hub of activity because transactions are pretty dang cheap and pretty fast generally.
00:13:56.506 - 00:14:27.314, Speaker B: And for retail, it's like, yes, if you're coming in with a $100, which honestly, I've seen so many screenshots on Twitter now of people who, like, are like, oh, I got a phantom wallet. Yesterday. I put a $100 in. Like, here's my portfolio of memes. Like, you need a blockchain that a, hash low transaction costs, and b, has, like, all this garbage that you might want to buy. And that's on Solana right now. People are taking $100 portfolios, spending two cent a click, buying ten different tokens and seeing what happens.
00:14:27.314 - 00:14:56.538, Speaker B: You can't do that on Ethereum. L one, it's like $15 transaction costs. It's not that much if you're trying to move a million dollars and there's a million dollars of Dex liquidity on Ethereum, if you want to buy or sell ether, like a major or something large. But, like, if you have $100 portfolio, you cannot spend $15. And so, yes, Solana right now is the best casino. You see it in the volumes, you see it in the activity. Slotted dexes are printing crazy volume figures right now.
00:14:56.538 - 00:15:14.306, Speaker B: Like, clearly that's the focal hub of activity. And that might change. Like, with, like, den kun upgrade and like, blobs, like Ethereum, l two s are getting really cheap again. And, like, maybe we'll see more activity migrate to any of the l two s. But right now, salama clear winner.
00:15:14.450 - 00:15:46.746, Speaker C: I'm on Dutch this week, so I'm in London and, you know, one of the key questions we were discussing around the panels and such is, like, where the hell are we in the cycle? It's so confusing because in some ways, like the Solana stuff, it's so toppy. Like, you have this slurp coin. People just sent a guy $10 million and, you know, he doesn't even know what he's doing. He burns the supply. Like, this is like such a top signal. But at the same time, I'm talking to the institutional side and the hedge funds, and they're seeing these inflows into BTC just starting. This is not the end.
00:15:46.746 - 00:16:12.954, Speaker C: It's going to just pick up because a lot of it's still under approval and we're going to see 18 months potentially of ramp up. Do you guys have any sense? What do you think? Are we in this new type of paradigm where we're going to have a lot of mini cycles? I don't want to say the word super cycle, but, like, are we just going to have, like, you know, overheating and then underheating constantly, or are you just going to. Are just going to go into a bear market?
00:16:13.254 - 00:16:52.484, Speaker D: Yeah, I think, you know, like the bitcoin and, like, separately, Ethan. And then all coins each have, like, their own sort of cycles. A lot of it's due to, like, people that have bitcoin, like, selling it to buy alts whenever bitcoin does go up. And maybe the reverse happens when they want to take profit in their alls and go back into bitcoin. Right now we're in a spot where we just cooled off from a really large meme coin alt, one could say blow off top. And it looks like we're still trying to find our footing on whether we want to resume up on bitcoin or we're just going to chop here for a bit. It's quite unclear.
00:16:52.864 - 00:17:36.795, Speaker B: My personal view is the number one driver of, like, this current bull market and, like, whether we're toppy or not, like, you know, I think it's relatively objectively understood that the bitcoin ETF's success has been probably the biggest macro driver of this cycle recently, since January. I mean, the flows into the bitcoin ETF surprised me. Surprised almost every analyst. Like, the numbers were incredibly, incredibly impressive. And market commentary of who's investing in these ETF's. When you start to talk to people, everyone that's looking at the numbers believes that it's retail driven. It's not like pension funds buying bitcoin, ETF's.
00:17:36.795 - 00:17:54.952, Speaker B: It's retail that honestly probably found Coinbase too hard buying bitcoin, because now they can just do it through the accounts they already have. They don't sign up for something new. They trust it. You know, buying an ETF on Charles Schwab is like, much more palatable for some people than, like, signing up for Coinbase, right?
00:17:55.008 - 00:18:02.816, Speaker C: And Larry Fink was telling us about this, right? Like, he was going on, he was saying, like, our clients are requesting this. Like, this is coming. This is reverse solicitation. Like, they're.
00:18:02.880 - 00:18:46.554, Speaker B: They're coming to us asking for this, right? They don't want to sign up for some crypto thing and deal with crypto wallets and, like, things they don't understand. It's like, use the account you already have, press buy. It's great. And so, like, the ETF's are the thing I'm watching most closely right now in terms of, like, trying to assess where are we in this cycle? And, you know, as of Thursday, you know, March 21, I don't know if your show comes out same day or later, but, like, as of this second, I'm actually really concerned about where we're at in the cycle, because we're starting to see ETF inflows dramatically slow. There's been three days of outflows on an aggregate basis, including grayscale, which. Grayscale is a dying product and all this. And it's dragging the numbers down.
00:18:46.554 - 00:19:33.272, Speaker B: The inflows into the ETF's have been really anemic the last couple of days. In the aggregates, there's net outflows. And if the net inflows into the ETF's and the success of the product was what built up this current cycle? If you start to see outflows from these products and you start to see cooling demand for them, it's potentially a really big narrative headwind. But as well as an actual technical flow headwind to the cycle, I'm a little bit concerned that there's three days now of consecutive outflows. If this trend continues, I would probably view it as just a temporary end to this cycle and a holding pattern for some time. I'd want to be very cautious.
00:19:33.428 - 00:19:41.992, Speaker A: So do you view this sort of four year. Four year cycle theory as something that might be coming to an end. Because what you're suggesting, if that holds true, would be different.
00:19:42.048 - 00:19:42.216, Speaker B: Right?
00:19:42.240 - 00:19:46.964, Speaker A: Like, it would actually be different this time. We'd be deviating from past four year cycles.
00:19:47.824 - 00:20:29.938, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, you know, crypto is so narrative driven. I think, you know, we're on four year cycles because historically, you know, bitcoin havings just seemed to align and it's been like, of the people that are like, invested in trading, like, it's like the dominant narrative. But I think the average buyer at this point doesn't even know what a halving is and isn't paying attention to it. And the importance of Twitter driven, laser eye narrative is going to zero. And I think the influence of traditional narratives is ending. So, yeah, I think we are starting to deviate from what used to be a narrative structure to one that doesn't exist anymore.
00:20:30.066 - 00:20:57.252, Speaker C: We're not seeing, like, much talk about bitcoin having, even though we're just weeks away. Right. Like, it's so soon and it's not being talked about. I do think that it's the last halvening where we do still have like, an impactful reduction in supply. It will be like, meaningfully different. You know, this, like, two to 1% is still like a lot of billions. But Justin and Vicki were discussing last episode, got a little bit contentious on the EFTF.
00:20:57.252 - 00:21:01.024, Speaker C: We can talk a little bit about how things are looking. How are they looking, Justin?
00:21:01.524 - 00:21:45.130, Speaker A: Yeah, I should probably kick off that conversation. I suppose I need to go on an apology tour and tell my critics that I was take off the medal and tell them they were probably right. So obviously the news came out that the SEC was investigating the Ethereum foundation, seeing if ETH could be classified as a security. And I think for most people, this sort of puts the ETH ETF off the table. I think the only caveat to that is if the SEC is not investigating in, let's say, a nefarious way, the Ethereum foundation, but they're investigating to sort of make the case that it's not a security. To be clear, I think that's like a very low probability outcome. I think they're very much going after trying to see if they can classify this as a security and reject the ETF.
00:21:45.130 - 00:22:16.726, Speaker A: And so now I think my odds are much more aligned with the market. So I think even as recently as last podcast, before this news came out, I said Larry Finks in Blackrock saying, I think this is like an 80% to 90% chance of approval. Now I think I'm as aligned with anyone else with Polymarket being at 20%. The one thing that I think is interesting, and I definitely want to pass back to thicki to get his thoughts on this. But the worst news for Ethereum could have happened. Like the best tailwind we had going for it is now a headwind. And ETH BTC was actually up on the day.
00:22:16.726 - 00:22:41.714, Speaker A: It looks like ETH BTC was sort of sold into a week before. Maybe there's insiders with knowledge selling ETH there, but for me it's hard not to be bullish on ETH just because you can't. The ETF's not priced in right. No one's bullish on that happening right now. And there's this regulatory overhang and ETH is still where it's at. It's at the same price. It's actually up on ETH BTC over the last two days since that came out.
00:22:41.714 - 00:22:48.230, Speaker A: Very curious to hear what you have to say, thikki. And if you agree with me, and then also Robert as well, my personal.
00:22:48.302 - 00:23:39.862, Speaker D: Take on why BTC went down so much after it hit 4k was in my opinion, it wasn't like insiders frontrunning it or people putting on the FBC short. Personally, I felt like I knew that it would get rejected at 4k when it was at 158, but like, I just didn't want to put on the short. Just wasn't good risk reward. I honestly think that's what like the lack of demand looks like. Not to like offend any of your bags, but I felt like at a certain point, like if an ETF isn't getting approved, like there isn't much demand to hold to buy ETH at wait two years for an ETF potentially. I think the recent bounce off the SEC fudge, like I think that was mostly due to like a technical bounce off, like that defended 0.05 level.
00:23:39.862 - 00:23:46.030, Speaker D: Like I think everyone knew that photos are kind of old. It was like from like a fortune article that references the case like a month or two ago.
00:23:46.102 - 00:24:08.982, Speaker C: I think it just kind of, just kind of like it's opposite of, you know, sell the news. It was, it was like a buy by the bad news, which is this exact effect you expect when people are pricing it at zero, but nobody has publicly said it. And it's like, I was actually uncomfortable holding ETH like the last couple of weeks because it looked like it was going to get rejected, but until the news comes out, you can't get that out of your system.
00:24:09.078 - 00:24:10.078, Speaker B: There's too many people.
00:24:10.206 - 00:24:30.184, Speaker C: They're very comfortable selling rallies because they know that they'll get bailed out by this ETF rejection now that it's already started to get priced in. Those people don't have anything to lean on anymore. Forward looking now, the rejection is not on the horizon. I see Robert nodding, zooming out.
00:24:30.524 - 00:25:22.584, Speaker B: The only reason why we have bitcoin ETF's is because the SEC got its ass handed to it in a court case over their arbitrary and capricious denial of the bitcoin ETF's. And this is not something that they wanted to approve. The bitcoin ETF's were being rejected for, obviously political biases. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the approval of the bitcoin ETF's. I don't think that there's a desire to go out and approve Ethereum ETF's. I think if it happens, they're going to be dragged kicking and screaming into their approval through the next set of court cases that slam the SEC for their arbitrary and capricious actions. I don't think they want to do this and I think they're looking for excuses.
00:25:22.584 - 00:25:39.072, Speaker B: This is personal speculation, but I don't think they want to approve these ETF's. I think their attitude hasn't changed since the bitcoin ETF's. And I don't think they wanted to approve the bitcoin ETF's. And so they were forced to. They were literally compelled by a court to do it.
00:25:39.168 - 00:26:04.982, Speaker C: Chatter at DAS has been that they're expecting that what's needed is, first of all, everyone is expecting Trump to win. That's kind of like the. I think the odds are only like 50 something percent. But like, over here, it was like foregone conclusion. Just wait till November. Trump is obviously in, Gensler's out, and then we can get moving in. Q one, is that something that is the base case at this point?
00:26:05.078 - 00:26:37.894, Speaker B: Well, if the prediction markets have it as a 50 50, then the base case is that it's a coin flip on what the outcome of the presidential election is. Right? I definitely don't think either president winning is a foregone conclusion. I think it's probably going to be the most competitive presidential election in a really long time. I mean, 2020 was an unbelievably competitive election. 2016 was an unbelievably competitive election. I think both of those were razor's edge outcomes. I think this year will probably also be a razor's edge outcome.
00:26:37.894 - 00:26:55.566, Speaker B: I don't know who's going to win. But I think if there is a turnover in the administration and the odds of Ethereum ETF goes to close to 100, if there's not, I think it's still close to 100, but it's close to 100 because they get dragged kicking and screaming into approval.
00:26:55.710 - 00:27:35.594, Speaker A: Robert, I wanted to ask you something. You mentioned earlier that the SEC doesn't want to do this, but I've really put myself in their shoes and really tried to think about this. And the incentives are aligned for literally everyone to approve the ETH TF, even for Gary Gensler to approve it. It's like, why do you think that's not happening? Like, it's hard for me to imagine that, like, the conspiracy theories are true, that, like, Elizabeth Warren controls Gary Gensler has, like, influence there, and that she's actually made the calculation that somehow it would actually be good for her, good for the Democrats politically to reject this. But to be honest, I think it's kind of a nothing burger. If they approve it, like, I don't, I don't see democrats protesting the BTC ETF. I don't see anyone upset about that.
00:27:35.594 - 00:27:49.394, Speaker A: I just see everyone doing really well, everyone making money, everyone enjoying this product, the SEC getting a little credibility back, it helping their chances of getting jobs after their terms are done at SEC. Like, the incentives are there to approve this thing. Why isn't it going to happen?
00:27:50.054 - 00:28:36.410, Speaker B: I mean, you can say that, but I'll agree, just based on, like, you know, the facts, like this, there was ten years of ETF applications, right. That they sandbagged, like a decade of them sandbagging a bitcoin ETF. Right. You know, clearly the incentives were not there or that there was a hesitance or a reluctance because they spent a decade sandbagging this before a judge had to intervene to say, hey, this is crazy. You're, you know, you need to approve this. They like to say that they're not a merits based regulator, but even in two out of five commissioners dissents, they 100% were arguing against it on the merits of bitcoin as an investment. Right.
00:28:36.410 - 00:28:51.334, Speaker B: There's clearly a level of abandonment of the principles of what they're supposed to be doing because they're trying to make merit based decisions on what people should or should not be investing in. And I just think all of the evidence points to this.
00:28:51.674 - 00:29:13.694, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe that's a good way to transition to chatting about superstate and what you're doing over there. Blackrock, I think yesterday, or the day before. They're like the torch bearer of the industry has now launched their biddle fund. I think they've seeded it with like $100 million of test capital. It's an on chain treasury product. From my understanding, that's what you're working on now. And it seems like it's going to become a very crowded space.
00:29:13.694 - 00:29:24.516, Speaker A: We've got a lot of people bring treasuries on chain. Can you talk just a little bit about what your North Star is, where you think superstate will be in the next few years, and what you really want to bring on chain?
00:29:24.710 - 00:30:07.014, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think there's an opportunity for a lot of different asset managers to compete in this market and win. If you look at the level of competition and assets in traditional markets, Blackrock sits alongside. Vanguard, sits alongside. Fidelity sits. There's many huge asset managers that all share a market together that are all incredibly competitive, that are all also incredibly successful. So I don't think that there's necessarily going to be a situation where even in the tokenization of assets on Ethereum, there's going to be a winner tick on market. I don't think Blackrock is going to be left alone with no competition to tokenize assets.
00:30:07.014 - 00:30:22.910, Speaker B: So I'm coming at this from the perspective of there's a lot of opportunity to build new products and a lot of opportunity to go about it in different ways, and there's a lot of differences in approach that I think we're going to start to see.
00:30:23.062 - 00:31:07.012, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm curious what assets you're most interested and excited about tokenizing, because treasuries do seem like the most obvious next step. But one thing I've been continuously asking myself as I look at the RWA space is like, is there a product market fit for 5% on chain? To some degree, yes. Because Jordy brought this up many, many episodes ago, we're democratizing and opening up this yield for anyone globally. Globally, right. Whereas before, it's very much restricted to us peoples, corporations, etcetera. But at the same time, right now, people that are actually doing things on chain are generally degenerate, or at least would be considered degen relative to tradfi folks. So do you think there's product market fit there? And then what do you think? What products do you want to bring on chain beyond treasuries?
00:31:07.188 - 00:31:47.542, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. So I think there's definitely the potential for a lot of product market fit because there's a lot of product market fit for dollars that go up 0% just logically and intuitively, there's probably more demand for dollars that go up 5% than dollars that go up 0%. The hurdle is that they're not as easy to use as stablecoins today. There's a lot of reasons for that. But right now, any of the tokenized treasury stuff is harder to access and harder to use than stable coins. Stablecoins have an advantage. You can see it in the $150 billion of stablecoins market cap to the 700 million of tokenized treasuries.
00:31:47.542 - 00:32:23.920, Speaker B: But I think over time, as these get easier to use, easier to access, and more composable with other systems, then they'll surpass stable coins. I think in terms of other products, I mean, there's a lot of things that are really exciting. I think eventually equities are going to be on chain. I think eventually real estate will be on chain. I just think it's like a long journey to get there. I'm excited about the Nasdaq. It's a little bit old school, but I think that's an exciting index of tech companies.
00:32:23.920 - 00:32:28.896, Speaker B: And I think there's products like that that are going to be the next focal points of tokenization.
00:32:29.000 - 00:32:52.934, Speaker A: Gotcha. Is Tradfi coming to crypto or is crypto going to tradfi? And what I mean by that is of course there's a world where both super stated Blackrock succeed and other crypto native companies. But in your mind, do you think these traditional issuers are the ones that dominate? They bring their users on chain or we bring tradfi and international folks on chain with our defi native or crypto native products?
00:32:53.354 - 00:33:14.904, Speaker B: It's both. I mean, it's a giant sandbox and melting pot. And crypto people are going to try, going to tradfi, and tradfi people are going to try to bring it to crypto. I think the one thing we have to expect is that there's going to be way more teams trying way more things and it's going to get experimental and messy and fun.
00:33:15.244 - 00:33:59.384, Speaker C: Yeah, it feels like in the bear market, these types of products were very popular. It made a lot of sense to go after them because the governance tokens were all going to zero and anything that's high single digit in some way look good now that these governance tokens are spiking. Like are you, you know, you've been there obviously with compound, you understand like the added boost of being able to give people that. And you know, Athena, despite having a huge yield on the underlying, they're also giving you know, shards or, you know, there's extra stuff. Do you. Do you kind of, like, feel like without a governance token, you can do something that gets the. Gets the attention and gets the TBL? Or is it really hard to compute?
00:34:00.164 - 00:34:54.280, Speaker B: Well, it depends on who you're thinking about as, like, the investor, right. So, you know, there's really, like, a couple different approaches. One is like, you try to create, you know, an asset that has a good, however you define this risk adjusted return, right? And there's so many products out there, there's so many teams, there's so many yields and yield farms. Like, there's so much competition on the risky return, there's some competition on getting closer to the risk free rate, but honestly, not even that much. And the amount of demand for the true risk free rate is actually huge. In some ways, it's probably larger than the demand for, at least on chain risky assets. I think the other direction to approach this from is getting closer to the risk free rate.
00:34:54.280 - 00:35:33.294, Speaker B: How do you get there with even less fees and, like, more liquidity and, like, get closer to the true risk free rate? Because that is also something that people want to hold. And, you know, at the end of the day, you know, if you've studied financial engineering, if you have a risk free rate and, like, a frontier of returns, you can create anything you want. You can compose, you know, the true risk free rate plus a theta or plus eigen layer, plus whatever, and it gets really interesting. But the building block of, hey, this is a risk free rate that you can use as leverage or inverse leverage, is really cool and becomes a very important primitive.
00:35:33.454 - 00:35:57.550, Speaker A: Robert, I wanted to ask you, I saw you had retweeted this. Here's a picture of you with a bunch of dapper looking folks speaking to the UK economic secretary to the treasury. It looks like a very thoughtful and productive meeting, but most of our audience is not privy to these sort of, like, insider conversations. Can you just share a little bit about, to the extent that you can, like, what these conversations look like, what different states and governments are thinking about?
00:35:57.702 - 00:37:23.174, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, in terms of this meeting, in general, the UK, and in this case, you know, this economic minister of the UK, Bim Aflami, they're incredibly excited about creating opportunities to bring crypto companies to their country and turning their country into a hub of innovation and entrepreneurship and opportunity taking an incredibly different approach to the US, which in a lot of ways is doing everything in its power to exile the crypto companies and the crypto builders and the crypto founders. And it's a smart bet. This is what most countries around the world are doing as like, a counterweight to the US trying to basically make conditions here as hard as possible. And in a conversation like that, it's really about asking questions of like, well, from a country asking questions, well, how can we make this a hospitable climate for entrepreneurs, for venture capitalists and for investors? And it's just like a very different perspective, which is a government trying to create a really fertile ground for people to work in. And it's awesome to see, you know, at a meeting like that in particular, like, just the, like, difference of attitude between, like, UK politicians and us politicians is just wonderful to see.
00:37:23.714 - 00:37:50.134, Speaker C: A little bit about robot ventures, maybe. So we're at this point in the cycle where, you know, you're a bit worried about the slowing ETF flows. We don't know if we're hopping for a little bit and stuff. Like, are you finding that, you know, investments are still making sense or the kind of seed round? I was doing a 70 million pre seed round the other day and I was being told that this is a great opportunity. So, like, what are you seeing right now?
00:37:50.714 - 00:38:03.436, Speaker B: Well, you know, not kidding. Yeah, I know you're not. I mean, that's where we're at again. I mean, you know, in the 2001 sort of like, market top, like, you know, seed rounds, pre seed rounds were getting into like the hundreds of millions of dollars.
00:38:03.500 - 00:38:03.820, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:03.892 - 00:38:38.556, Speaker B: And thats because the public market comps were like, oh, as soon as this goes liquid, it says $5 billion, therefore invested 300 million for a week old project. It makes sense. And in some ways, like, the math does make sense if theres, like, you know, a discount rate to public market valuations. Right. In the bear market, valuations got really low. I mean, there was strong founders raising at far below 70. Yeah, 15, 2030, and that was the norm.
00:38:38.556 - 00:39:20.644, Speaker B: And valuations are back in an upswing. They're nowhere near the 2021 top at all? Nowhere close to that. But they are starting to get a little bit detached from reality because they're still frothy liquid markets. And for a lot of investors, it's just a discount rate math calculation where. All right, well, what are things trading at liquid? How many months until something's liquid? What's my return and risk appetite? Okay, just find a comp and discount it. And so valuations are creeping back up. 70 seems pretty on par right now.
00:39:20.724 - 00:39:59.164, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, you're seeing, like you said, such demand for new launches. I mean, I don't think he's tracking new launches quite closely, but we're always like, okay. This exchange automatically assumes, like, if it's kind of going, okay, x, for example, like, there's, like, this level that you expect, and everything below that looks cheap. It doesn't matter what the coin is, what it does, if it's, like, an OKX launch or if it's a binance launch. Binance has raised the bar even further, and it actually consistently seems to be working. It shows that the distribution that these centralized exchanges have, if you manage to get that centralized exchange distribution, it gets. It's a waiting game.
00:39:59.164 - 00:40:24.934, Speaker C: Like, do you vest that fast? And then we're seeing secondaries go on sale right away because somebody just made a six x one month in. No, sorry, they've made a 2030 x, but they're willing to take a six x, and that creates this, like, secondary transaction where someone like, is like, okay, one month, six x, I'm good. And then the next guy's like, okay, 70% discount. Let me buy this, and then, like, you know, figure out what. What to do with it.
00:40:25.094 - 00:41:07.314, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's funny because, like, you don't really see, like, secondary markets in, like, early stage, unlaunched projects unless you're, like, really at, like, the top of a cycle, to be honest. Like, you know, during 2021, during 2017, it's like, the times where things were, like, out of control is when, like, I would see, like, a lot of secondary market activity like this, you know? So it's definitely. It's definitely a yellow flag for investors in the project, for everyone involved. Like, when you start to see private market stuff, like, getting flipped for six x in a month.
00:41:08.094 - 00:41:24.158, Speaker A: Robert, you've talked a little bit about all these caution flags, possibly the cycle. We're a lot further long than we think. Do you actually act on this information, or are you at the point where you have your ETH, BTC, whatever it may be, and you're just holding that as your. That's what you're benchmarking against?
00:41:24.326 - 00:41:39.400, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm very boring, personally. I'm an investor, you know, through robot ventures. I'm an investor in a number of other venture funds in the space, you know, in general. Like, I'm not a trader. Like, I'm kind of, like a Hodl type guy.
00:41:39.592 - 00:41:41.792, Speaker A: Are you an ETH guy, BTC?
00:41:41.968 - 00:41:45.096, Speaker B: I am more ether than anything else.
00:41:45.280 - 00:41:48.456, Speaker A: All right. I've got a friend for once. Someone else on the show.
00:41:48.520 - 00:41:54.024, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll say. It's also, like, really, like, you know, it sucked the last year or two.
00:41:54.064 - 00:42:00.434, Speaker A: Being, it's been terrible, but that's when you know, it's good, right? Like this, you don't want to buy. When everyone's euphoric, you want to buy whatever.
00:42:00.894 - 00:42:03.542, Speaker D: Jody, don't you have ETH too? Or does that change?
00:42:03.718 - 00:42:19.514, Speaker C: Listen, like, of course I have meth, right? Like, my meth bag is never going away. I'm never selling meth. So the reality is, like, tactically, around the ETF, we're going to have to wait a little bit. We're going to have to wait a little bit.
00:42:20.494 - 00:42:24.754, Speaker A: There's more than just the ETF. There's other reasons to like the soldier today.
00:42:28.304 - 00:43:00.444, Speaker C: The good thing is, like, you know, once you stake your ETH and it's sort of like earning yield, you feel much more comfortable just letting it, like, marinate over there and just like, okay, it's doing something. I feel psychologically okay with doing this, especially if it's, you know, you can use it as collateral or anything else. Do I expect, like, the ETH BTC generational pump that I predicted to happen right now? I think. I think it's going to have to wait until the ETF hype begins again. That's really, like, the only thing that's gonna, you know, make it moon.
00:43:01.184 - 00:43:11.080, Speaker B: I agree. I think the thing to be cautious about, and I say this as somebody who is, you know, an ether. I don't wanna say maxi, but you could say it.
00:43:11.192 - 00:43:12.000, Speaker A: We won't judge.
00:43:12.072 - 00:43:44.154, Speaker B: I'm not a maxi as a, as a builder, as a builder, I have focused my building on the Ethereum ecosystem. I don't know if ether has ten x upside. Right? Like most crypto assets that you're investing in, period, full stop. You, like, think that there's at least ten x upside. I actually think bitcoin does have ten x upside from here. I think there's a plausible path to it. I think Ethereum is like an absolutely unbelievable computing platform slash database.
00:43:44.154 - 00:44:17.344, Speaker B: And I think it's hard to justify, like, a $4 trillion database. I think the narrative around bitcoin is like a currency or historic value means it has more sort of unbounded upside. Where could I see it being a $13 trillion market cap? Yes, I actually can. I think it's hard to see ether have ten x upside from here. I think one of the reasons why I love the private markets is most private market stuff has ten x upside. Like, of course, has 100 x upside to me, depending on, like, you know, what stage you're investing.
00:44:17.504 - 00:44:30.164, Speaker A: I actually agree with that. Argument. But it's interesting that me and you both basically agree with that. But our actions are not in line with that. Like, we both hold more ETH than anything else. So why do you think that is for you?
00:44:31.224 - 00:44:52.150, Speaker C: There's quite like a good downside protection, right, for ETH because, you know, if it falls 50%, it becomes like so cheap for what it is and the amount of community it has. Like, we saw this like on the dip yesterday on the ETF, you know, bad news and then people just buying the hell out of it under like, you know, once it gets like around 3000. So the downside is very limited. Maybe that's why.
00:44:52.342 - 00:45:17.584, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, I think, yeah, like, in some ways I think of it as like the world's best staple coin where like, you know, it's super useful. There's like so much you can do with it on chain. Like, you know, you like meth, great. Like, you know, there's so many flavors of ether, like liquid staking stuff and like Eigen layer, like all these things to like do with it that, like, in my mind, like, emotionally, it's like the best stable coin.
00:45:17.704 - 00:45:39.404, Speaker D: That's actually. It's interesting that you say that, Robert, because, like, in my mind, like, if I were if, like, our new person coming in and people explain to me like, proof of stake versus proof of work and explains me ETH versus bitcoin, like, I would assume that like, ETH would be the better store value asset than bitcoin. But I guess you don't see that as like a short term or you know, like a path.
00:45:40.024 - 00:46:28.714, Speaker B: You know, I think if you were to like, ask someone at like a sovereign wealth fund or like, you know, in tradfi, like, the fact that ethereum has so many use cases and can do so much, like, it's much more just like, oh, that's a computing platform. Like, oh, it hosts, you know, 7000 different apps and like so many different tokens. Like, okay, like, it's a platform. So like, let's look at it in terms of like, what are the economics of that platform, right? And like, yeah, it's amazing. Like, you know, it burns $2 billion a year, therefore, like, put some multiple on it. Like, hooray. Like, you know, but like bitcoin, the only narrative it has is, you know, this very, like, you know, simple one which is like bitcoin scarce, you know.
00:46:29.054 - 00:46:44.782, Speaker C: You know, like, that reminds me of the, you know, utilities bearish thing. You know, there's too much utility for ETH. And I'll take this as an opportunity to move into our last week, which is the pasta of the week, because I have a quite irrelevant pasta.
00:46:44.918 - 00:46:46.126, Speaker B: I'm the judge. Right?
00:46:46.270 - 00:47:05.294, Speaker C: You're the judge. I'll kick off with my pasta. So, yeah, we had a little, little fud from bankless. Utility is bearish. So maybe you can play this clip, Justin, that we trade back and forth. But I think you're already seeing the seeds of how this can work in the opposite direction. Like, if you heard of Puff.
00:47:05.294 - 00:47:40.762, Speaker C: So I'm pretty sure Puff is, like, doing the kind of. This is going to be like a real project. We're actually going to start it with the meme, and we're going to use the attention to funnel the people into the real product. Like, we're going to use that attention for good. And I think we're going to see memes. Puff is a meme coin on mantle, and it's being bootstrapped by the mantle community, the mantle thought leaders, people, majority. And then the idea is that actually will turn into something with a team, with good intentions, with a north star, and they will build something.
00:47:40.762 - 00:47:43.814, Speaker C: But they're starting with a meme first, is what you're saying. Yeah.
00:47:44.334 - 00:47:49.234, Speaker B: Yo, Perkinsis Perkins. Perkins.
00:47:51.574 - 00:48:00.734, Speaker C: You know, don't let anybody start saying you have utility when you're trying to get this unlimited, you know, upside. No bounds to the stars.
00:48:00.774 - 00:48:09.174, Speaker A: So everything comes back to the Silicon Valley episode. I always reference this. It's like revenue is bearish. If you have, like, a million dollars of revenue, you're the ten X dog.
00:48:09.214 - 00:48:09.386, Speaker B: If you.
00:48:09.390 - 00:48:12.054, Speaker A: If you have zero, you have unlimited upside potential.
00:48:13.274 - 00:48:32.610, Speaker B: No, no, no revenue. I'll call you back. Why would you go after revenue? Because to make money. No, if you show revenue, people will ask, how much? And it will never be enough. The company that was the hundred x or the thousand x or becomes the two X dog. But if you have no revenue, you can say you're pre revenue. You're a potential pure play.
00:48:32.610 - 00:48:42.186, Speaker B: It's not about how much you earn, it's about what you're worth. And who's worth the most. Companies that lose money. I just thought that mainly the goal of companies is to make money.
00:48:42.250 - 00:48:42.770, Speaker C: Yeah. No, no, no.
00:48:42.802 - 00:48:43.854, Speaker B: That's not how it works.
00:48:45.554 - 00:48:52.774, Speaker C: Unless the revenue is really good, like, you know, Athena or something, and then it's like, it's working. How about you, Vicki? What's your.
00:48:53.914 - 00:48:57.654, Speaker D: Whatever intern made that deserves, like, a raise?
00:48:58.114 - 00:49:04.912, Speaker A: Jordy, are you behind the scenes of all these memes? Like, who's. Who's the. You're the thought leader for mental. Who's, who's thinking of the memes.
00:49:05.088 - 00:49:17.016, Speaker C: There's a fantastic video guy. I'm not going to say who it is because I don't want people using him, but there's an incredible video guy. Shout out. Shout out to my boy.
00:49:17.200 - 00:49:42.814, Speaker D: This is mine. I don't know if you noticed, like, Andre going off on Twitter against. He was going off with the save founder. He was going off. Everyone coming at everyone for subtweeting him. I thought it was just hilarious to see, like, we're seeing a return of this, like, evangelist sort of builder found their very vocal on Twitter. I think it's good to have, like, a very vocal quote, unquote, like, cult leader and guide, the voice and stuff.
00:49:43.234 - 00:49:49.058, Speaker C: I wonder what Robert thinks about these cult, because, like, Robert is such a, you know, composed chess player.
00:49:49.146 - 00:49:50.706, Speaker A: He's the anti cult leader.
00:49:50.890 - 00:49:51.962, Speaker C: He's the anti cult leader.
00:49:52.018 - 00:49:53.402, Speaker A: What do you think, Robert?
00:49:53.498 - 00:50:01.300, Speaker C: We saw do Kwan. We're seeing myrrt. Like, what do you think about, like, this type of behavior or just, like, strategy? And it's a strategy. I don't know.
00:50:01.492 - 00:51:07.522, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it has worked well to build communities, like, period, full stop, right? Like, I think some of the best communities that have been built have always started with this, like, wild evangelist leader, right? For good and bad. And when it's paired with something, like, really attractive from, like, a token or economic perspective, like, you get even bigger situations, not necessarily good ones. Like, Terra is like, it's an amazing example, right? Terra, you had this very compelling person, obviously, like a sociopath, but, like, a very compelling person paired with a unlimited scale, earned 19% on stablecoins project, and it got too big, too fast and imploded, right? And so, like, you know, I don't knock Andre, I don't knock anyone who's, like, going out to be, like, you know, a cult leader, so to speak. Because, like, I think the biggest outcomes and success stories in crypto pretty much all have that as an ingredient.
00:51:07.578 - 00:51:15.450, Speaker C: You could argue that the two largest projects don't have that. Like, you know, Satoshi kind of just quietly, well, there is a cult around Satoshi.
00:51:15.482 - 00:51:31.524, Speaker B: No, I mean, like, Satoshi is the cult leader of bitcoin. Like, period. Like, has that figure, right? Like, and he was crazy active in the beginning, right? He peaced out. But, like, Satoshi was the, like, hyper evangelist of bitcoin.
00:51:32.024 - 00:51:55.324, Speaker A: Here's a question for you, Robert. The most successful projects have the least, let's say, main character y founders. We've got Satoshi we've got Vitalik, we've got yu Stani, Hayden. Like, what's the difference? Why do you think, is there some core, like, causation there that the more modest, reserved founders are the ones that build the most innovative things, and then the boisterous ones are just building the new Ponzis?
00:51:56.784 - 00:52:12.048, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, I don't have an answer to that. Like, I think, like, you know, there's definitely correlation. You're right. Like, there's a. For sure there's a correlation. You know, it's possible that the people who like to fly close to the sun like to be loud when they do it, you know?
00:52:12.216 - 00:52:12.964, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:13.344 - 00:52:14.608, Speaker C: What's your pasta?
00:52:14.736 - 00:52:20.944, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I'm bringing out the big ones for Robert. I had a couple different entries. I whittled it down to one, and I'm a big.
00:52:20.984 - 00:52:22.536, Speaker C: You always have multiple entries.
00:52:22.640 - 00:52:26.248, Speaker A: I have a second one, if you'll allow it, Robert. But if not, this is from.
00:52:26.336 - 00:52:27.280, Speaker B: You get one entry.
00:52:27.392 - 00:52:40.848, Speaker A: One entry. Okay. This is from the cat. Why would a fly ever land on something like that? Venus flytrap. Like, what fly could be so stupid to land on that. Mice should be ashamed of getting caught in a mousetrap. Like, they're just going to eat some cheese on this, like, metal contraption.
00:52:40.848 - 00:52:59.564, Speaker A: And bears, like, they're stepping in this bear trap. How could they be so stupid? And then it's a picture of a human on a computer. A fellow djen. I'm sending too soul to this presale. And I just thought this was so hilarious. Like, we just, you know, every animal just has a little bit better of a mousetrap. And I think crypto and these meme pre sales are ours.
00:53:00.944 - 00:53:05.608, Speaker B: I would give this first place, but it's an old meme format, and I've seen this exact cartoon.
00:53:05.656 - 00:53:06.296, Speaker A: No.
00:53:06.480 - 00:53:16.950, Speaker B: Probably for years. Yeah. I actually have to give Jordi the award for the best pasta of the week only because I had seen that exactly meme format used going all the way back.
00:53:17.022 - 00:53:22.154, Speaker A: You know, if I should have gone with. My other one was good, too. My other one was good.
00:53:23.174 - 00:53:27.478, Speaker B: I mean, play it now, you know, put it up. You're disqualified from, you know, winning.
00:53:27.526 - 00:53:40.754, Speaker A: But, like, I think you might not like this one, though, because it's also played out format. The SEC. SEC thinks ETH is a security. See, nobody cares. And it's. That was really how I felt on that day, is like, oh, just another Tuesday in crypto.
00:53:40.854 - 00:53:42.954, Speaker D: This meme is so funny. I love this format.
00:53:43.034 - 00:53:43.642, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:53:43.658 - 00:53:52.938, Speaker B: It's a good one. I mean, I I agree. I had a lot of friends, like, buying ether as, like, you know, out of animosity. Like, they were like, oh, like, screw that. Like, buy button.
00:53:53.066 - 00:54:10.880, Speaker C: You know, Robert, like, the fact that you say that actually is super interesting. Like, my thesis around, like, all these coins. I've said it before. Is that, like, you know, things like Ethan Solana, like, their community money. There's, like, this concept of community money, and actually, like, when there's an adversary and there's a story and there's something happening, it's. It's better community money. And this is kind of like what you said.
00:54:10.880 - 00:54:22.364, Speaker C: Like, we were all just, like, waiting for this dead east to do something because, you know, people are just knowing it's going to get rejected, but now it's like, the former comes out, like, no, we're gonna fight this.
00:54:23.304 - 00:54:31.232, Speaker B: Totally. Yeah, I agree with you. Like, I've seen, like, so much renewed excitement and energy in, like, 48 hours. It's crazy.
00:54:31.328 - 00:54:35.710, Speaker C: It's good. We have. We have a perfect villain, Robert. Thank you.
00:54:35.782 - 00:54:36.394, Speaker B: We.
00:54:38.454 - 00:54:40.558, Speaker C: Met. It's a lot of meth. Okay, we.
00:54:40.646 - 00:54:41.274, Speaker B: We.
00:54:46.894 - 00:54:47.446, Speaker A: Join us.
00:54:47.470 - 00:54:48.234, Speaker B: Sticky.
00:54:50.494 - 00:55:12.210, Speaker C: This is our coin. Robert, thanks so much for coming. You know, I respect how, you know, you keep level headed and you've seen all this stuff before for. And it's always good to get perspective from someone that has been there, done that, and sees it all clearly. So thanks very much for joining us.
00:55:12.362 - 00:55:13.890, Speaker B: Thanks for having me on steady labs.
00:55:13.962 - 00:55:15.730, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely.
00:55:15.922 - 00:55:22.114, Speaker A: Thanks, Robert, always a pleasure. We really respect you for building in this space and staying humble and wish you the best with super State.
00:55:22.234 - 00:55:22.954, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:55:23.074 - 00:55:23.370, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:55:23.402 - 00:55:23.658, Speaker B: Cool.
