00:00:00.560 - 00:00:43.390, Speaker A: It can't be great knowing that you've had people buy in and that are down infinite. Like, your community, your discord, I'm sure. Looks like once this happens, is that enough of a motivation to not be so predatory on your tokenomics, which, you know, Athena probably is one of those examples that launched at a very low flow, tried to create a lot of hype. They did all the axie infinity stuff. We can bring up the Axie chart because that was probably the equivalent of last cycle where this thing, it ran up infinite based on the Ponzi like loop where you had to keep buying more tokens to farm more tokens, and they started throwing gasoline on the fire. And this chart is epic. I mean, it's insane.
00:00:43.390 - 00:01:25.980, Speaker A: Remember this? When it was, like 100 plus, some of the seed investors that were up, like 1000 x were asking me if they should sell. I'm like, you haven't sold. What are you doing? Like, how you. They're like, everything's unlocked, and they still haven't sold at a $100. I'm like, what? It's like, oh, I think it's gonna go to 250. What's going on? Dm, everybody, or hopefully still a. Still a good morning.
00:01:25.980 - 00:01:48.662, Speaker A: It's episode 50 of steady lads. I'm here with Justin and Taiki. Look. Is it the bear market? Is it back? I don't know, but we talked about this before the show, and steady lads was forged in the depths of the bear market. You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. We are.
00:01:48.662 - 00:02:00.370, Speaker A: We're happy to keep grinding through thick and thin and think about the space, keep learning, and answer the question, who do we blame this for?
00:02:01.470 - 00:02:05.370, Speaker B: Why are our coins going down? Who do we blame?
00:02:06.350 - 00:02:42.276, Speaker A: I'm just down. It's like the charts are, you know, murder. They just look like coins are dying. And Donalt was asking, you know, does this constitute the death of meme coins? Certain meme coins, like bowdoin. We'll look at some of those charts, but, yeah, I'm sure not everyone is in the best mood, but we're here to provide some commentary and not just entertainment, but hopefully. Hopefully some good thoughts, and we'll talk about prediction markets as well. That seems to be one of the few hot parts of the market right now.
00:02:42.276 - 00:02:59.644, Speaker A: So we'll. We'll look at what's happening there. Yeah. So a little bit of a sobering for the market, I would say. Altcoins were already down quite a lot, and now it's majors as well. Unfortunately, it looks like the governments are dumping on us. It's.
00:02:59.644 - 00:03:05.280, Speaker A: It's kind of painful when that happens, right, guys like Germany starting World War Three. Now.
00:03:07.190 - 00:03:20.846, Speaker C: I do remember when the us government started selling its bitcoin that actually marked sort of like a local bottom, and we just went up from there. So I've seen some hopium on Twitter of people saying, you know, this, Germany selling is marking the latest bottom Germany.
00:03:20.878 - 00:03:30.770, Speaker A: We have. We have some of the us coins and then we got Mount Gox. So there's. There's some big stuff. Ultimately, it needs to get digested, and.
00:03:31.390 - 00:03:38.144, Speaker C: We have the ETH unlocks coming, too. And, you know, if the market's taking a bearish turn, who knows how much inflow there will be to offset that?
00:03:38.262 - 00:04:19.130, Speaker A: I'm not too worried about ethi, but it does go to show you how narrative starts to form around just a single big buyer or seller. I remember we had shows and endless people talking about how ETH BTC was awful during the bitcoin run. And it was all because, like I was saying at the time, it was just single seller. It was just Celsius was liquidating and they had decided to just only sell Eth. I don't know if it was some BTC maxi at Celsius liquidation, but they were only selling their ETH. And that just kind of drove a certain narrative into the market around ETH BTC. But now that's over.
00:04:19.130 - 00:04:24.010, Speaker A: Now BTC is the one that has these idiosyncratic sellers.
00:04:24.170 - 00:04:54.060, Speaker C: But I wanted to ask you guys, it feels like there was some incredible news that came out this week that no one cared about. Trump seems to be the likely winner. That's what. We'll talk about that later. The prediction markets are calling that, and Trump also announced he wants to create a crypto strategic reserve for the us government and buy bitcoin. And I think ETH as well, which sounds to me like pretty wild news. Clearly, the market doesn't think he'll follow through on that, but it seems to me there would actually be a good chance that he would make that happen if elected.
00:04:54.400 - 00:05:22.870, Speaker A: It's a huge deal if it happens, especially possible. I wouldn't say the market's not the market's. Like I said, it's not pricing in or not pricing in. The market is just absorbing billions of dollars of forced selling. And these government sellers, it's not like they're trying to get good execution. They probably don't mind nuking the chart because they're hitting their competitor to their fiat. So if they just get bad execution, but they drive the price down more and make the chart look like crap.
00:05:22.870 - 00:05:53.480, Speaker A: They're probably okay with it, I think. There was a tweet by our favorite master manipulator of the media, Justin sun, saying he's willing to purchase all of the BTC off market. And we see Gabriel there saying it's the hero we need. Look, like I take this with a grain of salt. Justin was trying to buy Credit Suisse when, like, Credit Suisse will fall. Like, trying to put a bid in. I'll bid 3.4
00:05:53.480 - 00:06:21.890, Speaker A: billion in eth if you just let me buy Credit Suisse. I don't really, like. I don't. I don't know that he's, like, serious, but even if he was, I feel like the german government and, you know, having seen how the ECB and. And those officials talk about how much they hate crypto, they probably just take a schadenfreude joy out of the chart that they're causing, and they're willing to take $100 million less just to do it.
00:06:22.010 - 00:06:30.114, Speaker B: Yeah, they're probably, like, scrolling down CT and just laughing, you know, all the despair and capitulation that they're seeing on the timeline.
00:06:30.162 - 00:06:34.950, Speaker A: Like Arthur Hayes, but, like, actually powerful. Liquidate. The plebs run the stock.
00:06:36.130 - 00:06:45.706, Speaker C: You know, it's sad they're doing it this way. Jordy, this could be a whole new line of business for Salini capital. I mean, we need governments calling you execute the sales. You know, they shouldn't just be doing it themselves.
00:06:45.858 - 00:07:05.590, Speaker A: Yeah. So, you know, they used to. They used to do auctions. The us government has done a lot of successful auction. On auctions, where I saw chatter that they might even go for premium because they're clean bitcoin. They're like, they're. If they're given out by the government, that means that at that point, they're considered clean.
00:07:05.590 - 00:07:32.870, Speaker A: You don't have to worry about any tainted, you know, transactions. So they could go for a premium if they just sold them instead of selling them on the market. And there are buyers. I mean, DrW was buying these, like, big, big chunks, and I think that would be a much better way to go. Not sure why they stopped doing those. Seems like a lose lose.
00:07:33.210 - 00:07:39.684, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you want to pull up, like, some of the altcoin charts? I mean, because they're. They're the ones absolutely getting decimated.
00:07:39.772 - 00:07:53.040, Speaker A: Uh, let's start with, uh, we. We have a little bog leonidas, uh, tweet here, and we were talking. We want to get Tyche's reaction.
00:07:54.140 - 00:07:55.280, Speaker B: My reaction.
00:07:57.580 - 00:07:58.612, Speaker A: Look, look. Tighty.
00:07:58.636 - 00:07:58.820, Speaker C: Look.
00:07:58.860 - 00:08:00.760, Speaker A: Air drops this way. Just stay.
00:08:02.740 - 00:08:05.756, Speaker B: Really believed. I really believed in the tech.
00:08:05.908 - 00:08:08.320, Speaker C: You and who in that cart?
00:08:09.740 - 00:08:10.908, Speaker B: It's me.
00:08:11.044 - 00:08:33.180, Speaker A: We're gonna talk about this today. But one of the most dangerous, pervasive, you know, things that trick people is when they're told that there's, like, second way to get make money. Like, one way is, like, the price. And, yeah, maybe price goes down, but you're gonna get this, like, amazing yield. Like, you remember, like, the. The three digit yields of, like, olympus dow. You get, like, 200 hex.
00:08:33.340 - 00:08:34.300, Speaker C: That was hex, right?
00:08:34.340 - 00:08:58.940, Speaker A: Oh, well, hex was more like 20. It wasn't as, like, you know, insane yield, but it made you feel like, okay, I'm. I'm kind of hedged. Like, even if the price goes down, I'm getting the yield. And then there was the airdrop meta, which is what, you know, taiki was trying to catch there, which is, yeah, maybe Celestia goes down, but I'm gonna get airdrops that are gonna be worth more than. Than that amount.
00:08:59.640 - 00:09:30.878, Speaker B: Maybe I fell for the. Because I was, like, studying last cycle, and I think safemoon hit, like, 20 billion or something, right? And I was, like, wondering, how did that even happen? And I realized that the tick tock narrative was, well, it doesn't matter if it goes down, because there's, like, a 10% tax that goes back. If you hold your coins, the sellers pay a 10% tax, and it goes, like, back to the holders. So it's like, this infinite yield. It's kind of like that, right?
00:09:30.974 - 00:09:58.160, Speaker A: That's a great example of this, like, two tier approach. Like, don't. Don't look at the price. There's a 10% tax, and we're gonna chop that up between us. So, fine, once we're down 99%, don't worry. Yeah, let's bring the charts up. I mean, it's kind of painful to look at some of these, but we do have to reflect right now and think about why we're making new lows on a bunch of stuff.
00:09:58.500 - 00:10:13.828, Speaker C: Let's start with world coin. Actually, world coin is a good one, because 50 weeks ago, it was the first thing we talked about, if you guys recall, I got my eyeball scanned. I had some great pictures from that. And this was sort of the start of the bull market, was when world coin was first launching, if you guys remember that.
00:10:13.924 - 00:10:47.028, Speaker A: Yeah, their loop. I mean, it was the definition, like, the poster boy of low float, high ftv, tiny float. Like, really? Really? Even if I'm looking, I'm looking now it looks like 2%. So 2% float. It ran up pretty hard. It got these Korea listings and the up it apes were buying it got it up to $100 billion. That might have been when Chad GPT four was coming out and all this stuff.
00:10:47.028 - 00:11:04.820, Speaker A: We're getting near to unlocks in some of these coins and we can look at some more that are nearing unlocks. But I think world coin, you can see the chart started in August. So I'm guessing that in one month on this chart is when the one year unlocks start to happen. Yeah, I mean, this chart is pretty brutal.
00:11:04.980 - 00:11:15.270, Speaker C: It's, I think also the company is selling, what, 17 million or $15 million a day or something like that. I was reading there's just like a crazy amount. The company even announce that they're doing this?
00:11:16.130 - 00:11:48.360, Speaker A: Yeah, they're, they're more transparent than other people who are also selling. But maybe not talking about it. I think it's the, a lot of the founders are doing it themselves. They're realizing that this is their like one last window when they're the only ones that have tokens before everybody else get theirs. And especially the ones where like the investors are still up a lot because the round was done, the nine figures. So they're like, well, my guys are still going to be up, you know, Multi X, you know, they should shut up and just let me, like, sell. Fair enough.
00:11:48.360 - 00:12:36.370, Speaker A: So the reality is like, the price is going to go down no matter what. Like, no matter who sells first, it's going to be down a lot more than even it is now once all the unlocks happen. So the question is, who do we blame this for? Or do you blame for this? Maybe we can bring out this tweet and we can look at the sentiment here on Twitter. Yeah. So we'll talk about the Tehran thoughts here about OTC. But if you look at the blanc tweet here, what do we blame this for? And it's sort of, in this case, ina kind of since April, it's only been a couple of months, but it's, it's kind of a brutal chart.
00:12:37.230 - 00:12:54.278, Speaker B: Yeah. And you can argue that Athena actually is like a real product. You can argue things like arbitrum. Right. Arbitrum is also hitting new lows. But as a farmer, I've noticed that. I mean, I've known this, but all these tokens, they're just meant to be sold.
00:12:54.278 - 00:13:18.098, Speaker B: Right? Like the use case is for you to farm it and sell. Even arbitrum is like the unlocks have started since March. They're giving away like hundreds of millions of dollars in grants and like, you know, on chain incentives. Ina. Right. Like you, if you don't stake your USD, then you get. You get tokens.
00:13:18.098 - 00:13:37.788, Speaker B: And I was also looking like, right now I'm farming eth fi, like Etherfi and it's down like 50% in like the past week or so because the airdrop is going to happen in like four days. So it's like, the purpose of these tokens is to be sold and it really should not be purchased. It really should not be purchased.
00:13:37.884 - 00:14:07.330, Speaker A: You're absolutely right. And I can see your farmer hat and rake in the back. You are the right, like, demographic for these coins. The reality is that they are farming coins. Farmers make money because somebody buys these tokens. And as you rightly said, it's usually the suckers that are buying these tokens because you can just get them without buying them. You can just farm them for, not for free, but like for capital cost.
00:14:07.330 - 00:14:17.798, Speaker A: Whether it's, you know, dollars or eth, it's. It's not a huge capital cost. You know, like, normally it's. It's like 510 percent. Right? Yeah.
00:14:17.854 - 00:14:47.462, Speaker B: And there's a. Because yields have compressed so much and the markets are just bad in general. Everyone with billions of dollars in aggregate, they're chasing all this yield. And if anyone can get, let's say above 20% yield on either stables, they just chase like, whatever protocol that is. And as soon as they get their tokens, they're just going to dump. So you can focus at the, I mean, you can look into the fundamentals and whatnot, but right now the use case is to farm and dump. And perhaps.
00:14:47.462 - 00:15:34.934, Speaker B: Right, perhaps if there's only sell pressure for these tokens, you can argue that maybe at some point the price can disconnect and you can potentially make a bull case for it. But even things like blast, I think it's a pretty decent l two, but it just keeps going down. And I've made this joke that l two is the cycle or the pancake swap forks. You know, where people fund them, people deposit capital, you get tokens, you dump, then you move on. It just kind of feels like that's where we are in the cycle, where there's not that many apps and the only use case is to bridge, to restake, farm and dump and then move on. And it's real. I think that's why the vibes are deteriorating.
00:15:34.934 - 00:15:40.290, Speaker B: There's nothing to be super excited about. It's more around. Okay, let's just farming, dump all these tokens.
00:15:41.150 - 00:16:15.964, Speaker C: I need to ask you guys this. Like a year ago when we started the podcast, we had a similar mindset to what we have now where we said, like, these tokens are going down, there's no reason to hold them. It makes sense to hold the majors, but don't hold these alts. And we also hypothesized, or like some of us did, I know Taiki and I did that, like, to get out of this bear market, we would need to invent like a new use case, new applications, et cetera. But we actually didn't need to do that, right? Like, it turned out that BTC went up, everything else went up with it. And then do you think we'll get out of this again without sort of building our way out of it? We'll just get out of it because the majors go up.
00:16:16.092 - 00:16:26.516, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't see any reason why you need use cases. It's just the pure, the gamblers get more money and then they go to the casino again. This is so simple.
00:16:26.588 - 00:16:37.840, Speaker C: It's the, do you think we're going to be trending towards like, the tokens are valued based on how much value they accrue or are we never going to trend towards that? Like, are we on a slow walk in journey there or are we just not getting there?
00:16:37.940 - 00:16:41.608, Speaker A: We have to get there. We will get there, of course. Yeah, eventually. Yeah, yeah.
00:16:41.664 - 00:17:22.310, Speaker B: Like, like, you know, like I've tried, you know, like, I've tried buying these coins. Like, you know, like a year ago I bought maker and you know, I was like, yo, like, this is a defi dinosaur that has some token value accrual. Let's ape this. And then it like went up like eight x or something. But like, now it's like, okay, like, you know, maybe being able to put a valuation to these things is bearish. So I feel like every year that passes, like, all my friends slowly turn into bitcoin maxis. It's just like, people get burned enough on all these alts that it's like, okay, yeah, maybe I should just stick to the majors and take less directional trades.
00:17:22.310 - 00:17:37.290, Speaker B: And I guess that's what both you and Jordy do. Like, Justin and Jordy, I try to shake coins sometimes and try to do more dj and stuff, but the edge there is so low, it's so limited that it's like really, really hard, especially nowadays.
00:17:38.750 - 00:18:13.426, Speaker A: Let's double click, though, on this question of who do we blame this for. I think everyone's going to look at it from their own selfish perspective. We have to run here. These guys do the most secondaries. This is sticks huge on secondaries. He says here, if we look at his tweet that look, they should have never traded at 20 billion. They should have always traded at 2 billion, 3 billion.
00:18:13.426 - 00:18:47.944, Speaker A: Because if you just let the secondary market trade, this is where it was actually, there were sellers willing to take 2 billion when it was at 20 billion. So secondaries are blocked. And he thinks founders will learn that it's better to. To let sellers exit OTC. So this is something worth thinking about. The founder perspective on this chart, of having this chart. It can't be great knowing that you've had people buy in and that are down infinite.
00:18:47.944 - 00:19:27.970, Speaker A: Like your community, your discord, I'm sure, looks like shit once this happens. Is that enough of a motivation to not be so predatory on your tokenomics, which Athena probably is one of those examples that launched at a very low flow, tried to create a lot of hype. They did all the axie infinity stuff. We can bring up the axie chart, because that was probably the equivalent of last cycle where this thing, it ran up infinite based on a Ponzi loop where you had to keep buying more tokens to farm more tokens. They started throwing gasoline on the fire. And this chart is epic. I mean, it's insane.
00:19:27.970 - 00:19:32.290, Speaker A: Remember this when it was like at like 100 plus?
00:19:33.190 - 00:19:34.022, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:34.206 - 00:19:59.252, Speaker A: Some of the seed investors that were up like a thousand x were asking me if they should sell. I'm like, you haven't sold. What are you doing? Like, how? You're like, everything's unlocked and they still haven't sold at a $100. I'm like, what? It's like, oh, I think it's gonna go to 250. What's going on? And this thing, it's at $5 now. So it's down, like infinite, but it's still at a billion dollars FDB. So you can imagine how many billions it was up then.
00:19:59.252 - 00:20:38.300, Speaker A: I mean, it was like infinite billions. I remember there was a day when they announced that they're going to do staking yield. They were going to do, like 20% staking yield for axie tokens. And, you know, the price just, like, went up, just skyrocketed, because now people are trying to buy to do this. Some of them were trying to hedge on perps, and then the funding went negative. And we can talk a little bit about the implications of this. When the funding is negative, it means that there's people desperate to hedge so much and usually they're desperate to hedge because it's overvalued.
00:20:38.300 - 00:21:15.068, Speaker A: Like, they know, everyone knows it's overvalued. And that's when you get negative funding rates. And, and some of these tokens now have unfortunately done the same playbook where they announced staking, I think, or like forced holding. You need to have this, you need to stake it to get the yield. If you do that, it's like what the fiat system is doing where you just pay down debt with more debt, you're creating more problem later on because you're saying, guys, hold your token, don't sell it. We're going to give you 20% yield. A year later, there's 20% more tokens that you have to get absorbed into the system.
00:21:15.068 - 00:21:16.920, Speaker A: So you've just magnified the problem.
00:21:17.220 - 00:21:43.040, Speaker B: It's similar to like, apecoin, right? Because like, I think apecoin tried to introduce staking and Kobe was like, yeah, like, don't do that. And like, who do we? And it's similar to like all the sell pressure. Even if you introduce staking, just gets pushed back. It's kind of like the curve liquidations. It's like Michael's just borrowed against the Crbden, so he says, pushed back all the selling to like this year, and now it's like, oh, fuck, you know, it's like down so much.
00:21:43.460 - 00:22:24.770, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good example, but like, if you look at it from, from a simple zero sum game where there is a winner and a loser, the losers are generally gonna be, you know, the retail that are buying at the wrong price because they're not doing enough. It's not even like they have to do a lot of research. They just have to look at, you know, Coingecko FDV. Just look at the coingecko FDV as a minimum and just be like, is this thing really worth 20 billion? Like maybe it's just a coin that just got made up two months ago, didn't exist before, you know, maybe, maybe not.
00:22:26.110 - 00:22:44.136, Speaker B: Are you saying that like, who do we blame is one, I guess the team and VC's that come up with these predatory tokenomics and in a way they trick retail to buy these things at high ftbs and then they just like hedge or sell OTC and eventually get.
00:22:44.168 - 00:22:57.612, Speaker C: I think it's an oversimplification. Oversimplification to blame the teams because like this is literally like their incentive is completely aligned at like launching these tokens at high valuations. They have a duty to their investors to do that in some ways that's.
00:22:57.636 - 00:23:03.868, Speaker A: Like, that's, that's not like a shareholder thing where you have to maximize shareholder value because first of all, what I'm.
00:23:03.884 - 00:23:12.980, Speaker C: Saying, but look at the incentives though, right? Like, yes, we can blame them, but are there, is anything going to change there when the incentives are all aligned to do this? Like, I, they're not.
00:23:13.020 - 00:23:55.790, Speaker A: I think, I think first the exchanges have realized that they're the ones that get screwed because people come in, deposit $100, buy the token at like, know, 20 x a price. Those dollars then like disappear. And the exchanges like have, unh, they have less money on them and then unhappy customers. So the exchanges are starting to fight back. Retail is fighting back by like buying meme coins, which reminds me of like Maga 2016 when they're just like, screw it, burn it, burn it all down. Like we're just going to vote for like the stupid coins instead of like the official serious coins. So not everyone's aligned on this.
00:23:55.910 - 00:24:24.960, Speaker B: Justin Bonds, who's like an investor, thought later he mentioned that it is about incentives because if you're a dev, you're not really incentivized to scale ETH and work on ETH because you don't get paid that much. But you are incentivized to create a new l two because then you can just drop a new token multibillion FTV and then just get rich off of it. So the incentive just keeps driving devs to ship new l two s where like the base layer just doesn't improve that much.
00:24:26.100 - 00:25:04.514, Speaker C: I don't understand how you guys though, like are fully comfortable blaming the teams, the exchanges, the market makers, the founders for retail stupidity, right? Like, is it really up to the insiders to sort of police how retail values something and spends their money? Because most of these cases are not obfuscation. Most of the time, people are transparent with the tokenomics and it's very clear what the FTV is and what the cirque is. And when everyone's unlocking, most of the time, like 99% of the time, that's public. So now you're saying like, the teams are doing the right disclosures and we're, but we're still going to blame them for retail mispricing these assets eventually.
00:25:04.562 - 00:25:26.668, Speaker A: Like retail will wise enough. So one way or another, you know, they'll make a mistake and they'll get fleeced for billions of dollars and eventually things get more efficient. So that that will trend. But yeah, absolutely. Like, they're to blame. And the reality is, like, we all have friends that are investors. Even if we're not invested in something, we'll all know some of the people that are investors that you know the space.
00:25:26.668 - 00:26:32.308, Speaker A: Unfortunately, when you just look at the big VC's and the people that have a public platform, so like, you know, the 500 kind of top accounts on Twitter and like the hundred funds, that's not a lot of people. And everybody knows each other and we're all at the same conferences and stuff. We don't want to, I mean, sometimes you see like the quibbles, like, you know, yeah, you invest in this founder who's this, and you invested, you know, Ionet and like all this incident. Yeah, right. Like, you know, there's been a few where the found, like we saw some of the VC's go go at each other and then the next day, like, they delete all their nasty tweets because they realize it's like a zero sum. Like, you just have nothing to benefit by talking shit. So if no one's going to talk shit and we're just going to watch these things happen because some of our friends are in these coins, who's going to educate the retail? Ultimately there's a few lone voices, but who's really going to teach them? They have to learn by losing all their money.
00:26:32.454 - 00:26:58.042, Speaker B: I think there has to be a few projects like teams that understand that this is the meta and, you know, come to truth, like retail, it's just so hard for retail to win. So, like maybe they should do like community airdrop, like, you know, like what Frontek did. The reason Fronttech is down is not because of the airdrop. I think it's more because the product is like not good. I think if like an actual, like real team did something like that.
00:26:58.136 - 00:27:27.122, Speaker A: I mean, this chart is also pretty brutal because it had the normal airdrop. You can see at the very beginning where it had the airdrop sellers and people making fun of CL and everybody for selling at a dollar because a couple of days later, a lot of the bullish people were making fun of them and it was back at $3. It's down to $0.30 now. I mean, but doesn't this, isn't this.
00:27:27.146 - 00:27:41.710, Speaker C: A counterpoint to what you guys are saying? Right. With Friendtech, there were no insiders with any positions. The cirque was equal to the FDV. I believe all tokens were circulating on day one. And yet the same thing has happened. Right. So isn't that sort of a counterpoint to your guys?
00:27:42.450 - 00:27:44.098, Speaker B: No, because the product is not good.
00:27:44.154 - 00:27:44.298, Speaker A: Right.
00:27:44.314 - 00:28:26.964, Speaker B: Like, if the product was good. Like, if. If, like, Athena did something like this 100% airdrop, theoretically, that would have been like, everyone would have won. I think at least if you farmed it and then if it was a very high float, I'm sure lots of people would have sold. And then it gives people the opportunity to buy at a more reasonable price. You can even see this with layer zero because the most recent raise was like 3 billion, and then it traded below like 250 or something, and now it's like somewhere above three. So if these things launch more fair and the product is actually has like, there's like hope for the future, then maybe it is like a fair game and it gives people, like, the opportunity.
00:28:27.012 - 00:28:50.462, Speaker A: To, like, buy it. The fine type thing is more like the geo bowdoin and we can bring him. Bring up that chart. I think it's quite similar, actually, as much more of a Dalai Lama situation that happened initially. Wow. So it was up to now it's down to $0.05, basically.
00:28:50.526 - 00:28:55.010, Speaker B: Yeah. Hit a dollar, I think, like on a wick.
00:28:55.670 - 00:28:58.450, Speaker C: Well, everyone's rotating to the Kamala Harris token.
00:29:00.390 - 00:29:07.450, Speaker A: There you go. That's the real lesson. This stuff is inevitably going to go to zero. It's just you have to rotate to the.
00:29:09.900 - 00:29:34.964, Speaker C: I think one thing you guys are missing about, like, retail getting fleeced, though, is. I agree. There's this echo chamber on crypto Twitter where there is a cabal of investors and it's not in anyone's best interest to say projects overvalued. So let's all cheerlead everything and support it. And retail is going to get fleeced there. But the other issue is there's truly no way to even value these things. Like axie Infinity got to 100 billion or 150 billion.
00:29:34.964 - 00:29:38.318, Speaker C: Certainly that's overvalued. Maybe it's at a billion now.
00:29:38.454 - 00:30:14.790, Speaker A: First it's like demand and supply will make the price happen. So if you as a founder, you kind of know, you have a sense of how much your revenue is, what it's going to be in the future, what's like a reasonable valuation range. And I kind of respect founders that increase the supply when they feel like it's just not a fair price. I think. I don't want to say, like, specific founders, but there's some where they don't let the price get out of hand. They actually just like, unlock a lot of. Lot of supply for people.
00:30:14.790 - 00:30:35.520, Speaker A: Just, you know, vest stuff early, whatever they need to do, and get. Get the, get the price to normal range. You kind of know what your product should be worth. I don't know. We'll see some more examples. I mean, did we bring up apecoin? That was an interesting one. This was a pure, like, retail product.
00:30:35.520 - 00:31:01.254, Speaker A: Unfortunately, like, this is not like a ton of funds for buying it. This was a lot of community hype and it was the same thing. You had these, like massively negative funding rates when it was trading at $20. You had some big influencers showing. This is like the next coming of Christ look, probably like NFT didn't play out, I guess, part of what's to blame here.
00:31:01.422 - 00:31:04.182, Speaker B: And so go for Justin.
00:31:04.246 - 00:31:07.958, Speaker C: I think you're going to point out the same thing, but I can't help but notice the froc AI.
00:31:08.054 - 00:31:08.998, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:31:09.134 - 00:31:11.410, Speaker C: In the banner directly above eight point.
00:31:12.470 - 00:31:23.800, Speaker B: It's. It's like, it's like, literally this kind of explains the industry, right? It's like retail is looking at apcoin valuation and then there's a targeted ad for Frock Aihdeende.
00:31:28.170 - 00:31:50.470, Speaker C: I actually have a little quick anecdote on this. I was in a group chat and someone was saying they were interested in creating a meme coin before there was pump fund. So this was like several months ago. And they told me there was a Dex screener package where you could pay like 25 to basically like have a meme coin launch kit. And they would basically just like advertise your meme coin all over Dex screen. It would sort of initially pump it up.
00:31:51.090 - 00:32:19.758, Speaker B: Yeah. And if you can share my screen, Justin, this was like a topic recently where, you know, Polkadot, obviously, there's like nothing there. And someone leaked their marketing spend package and, you know, they pay like one hundred thirty eight k to the block for things that no one really looks into. They paid like half a million for an animated logo on Koi market cap. It's like, is this really where the VC money is going to? Right, like to the old.
00:32:19.814 - 00:32:22.650, Speaker C: It's not the VC money, it's dot coins.
00:32:23.390 - 00:32:36.822, Speaker A: Where's the Kol one? There was like an infinite amount going to kols where no one even knows which kols. Yeah, because none of us are, like, following people talking about dot. Did you guys see the list of kols?
00:32:37.006 - 00:33:01.660, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw the list of kols. I don't have it pulled up. But, you know, the Kol activation may and June was like $600,000. And I guess it was like all these influencers that I've never heard of, I guess they're big on YouTube or something. And then there's like the private jet fleet randization where for six months we'll pay two hundred k to put our logo on some jets and then hopefully some celebrities will buy our coin.
00:33:02.040 - 00:33:16.612, Speaker C: But to be clear, taiki, I saw your tweet. In your tweet you said this is like VC money going towards this. But I think with Polkadot's case, like this is actually them selling their treasury dot tokens to pay for this and fund it. Right. Because their marketing budget was like $80 million for the quarter or something.
00:33:16.796 - 00:33:28.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess it's more like a joke, right? It's just like, yeah, yeah. It's like how like why are these people like who's leading, who's the CMO of Polkadot that thinks this is a good idea, you know?
00:33:28.780 - 00:33:57.790, Speaker A: Well, I wouldn't say it's a bad idea, unfortunately. Like, you know, would the price be, we don't know what the price would be if they hadn't done all this stuff because there's no usage of the product. So maybe it would be dead. I mean it's dead but like, you know, it would be at a dollar instead of $5. You know, bottom line, there's a lot of tokens. We didn't want to go through the whole list. There is Starknet, Manta.
00:33:57.790 - 00:34:38.330, Speaker A: A lot of them are driven by, you know, launching on a launch pool on binance. And that's very bullish in a bull market and doesn't really like support you when FTD and the fundamentals go out the window. So there's a lot of reflection that a lot of us should be doing. I want the founders to reflect, I'm not going to call out any of them individually, but a lot of examples wherever you can look at your chart of your token and just like think about how you would do it differently to avoid these shapes and maybe go for a better shape.
00:34:40.310 - 00:35:08.695, Speaker B: We need better shapes than McDonald's arch down. Yeah, I feel like this is like cobies platform and I guess community syndicates could be interesting where maybe teams should just sell 20% of the supply, you know, at like a fair value to like people, like regular people. And maybe that's like a better way to build a community goodwill. But I guess that's also not a fair system because, you know, you have to gate who gets to participate and whatnot.
00:35:08.887 - 00:35:38.230, Speaker C: Yeah, and the last point about this, Jordy, I remember almost maybe a year ago we were talking about this, I think offline. There's an interesting dilemma here for founders in that you basically have to make this trade off. You have to let your community win a little bit, and it's good to let them win, but by letting them win, you sort of take a little bit of a hit yourself, right? Like you're giving away tokens that you could otherwise sell for a higher price. You're lowering your paper net worth, you're lowering returns in some capacity, but like, all of this can be healthy in the long run.
00:35:38.650 - 00:36:00.880, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. That's a great way to end this segment. We'll, I'm sure, talk about this topic in the coming weeks, but maybe let's move to our next topic. So we want to talk about prediction markets. That seems to be hot right now with the election going on. And Justin and something that you were saying that you found this very interesting. So maybe you can lead off on this topic.
00:36:01.380 - 00:36:26.970, Speaker C: Jordy, I'd love if you could just start explaining maybe your background. I know offline we were talking about topics for the show and you mentioned that you really knew a lot about prediction markets. So maybe you could just start sharing sort of your background on how you got into prediction markets, what you think of them generally, like, if they're a good proxy for getting us close to the source of truth. And then I have a lot of questions prepared that I wanted to ask you that get, like, really specific about the concerns that we've seen on Twitter about polymarket.
00:36:27.550 - 00:37:04.930, Speaker A: Yeah. So in my early twenties, when I was playing a lot of poker professionally, I also did a lot of sports betting and a lot of prediction markets. So that was combination of how I was spending my time as a young degenerate building my probability skills. I did spend a lot of time on Betfair, which was at the time the biggest prediction market. The liquidity was by far the largest you could possibly find in the world. Sports, politics were the main two things that, that had a lot of people betting. Obviously, politics is very seasonal.
00:37:04.930 - 00:37:47.540, Speaker A: It goes around the US election cycle maintained for the main part, and then a few smaller things like Senate every two years and stuff like that. Sports is one that gives you a lot of daily opportunities to hone your skills. But, yeah, I've dove in. I even considered I got offered a job at bed fair to manage a bunch of their business at some point didn't pay well enough, so I didn't accept it. But I did go deep into the rabbit hole of both the business model, the market making side, the liquidity side. So it's something I'm happy to talk about.
00:37:48.160 - 00:38:21.490, Speaker C: Great. So let's pull up polymarket, because one interesting thing is polymarket has become like the go to betting market for the election. You can see for the presidential election winner, there's been a quarter of a billion dollars bet here. And I'm seeing mainstream media outlets talk about polymarket, certainly the most liquid market now, just at a high level. How close do you think these percent chances of each candidate winning are? Close to the actual number. That's unknown. Right? Like, are these prediction markets highly accurate or do you expect it to be pretty wildly off?
00:38:23.310 - 00:39:03.092, Speaker A: So at this level of liquidity, when you get to nine figures, it's pretty accurate. There are some inefficiencies, especially, and we'll see. Kind of like some of the chatter I was having. But on the lower percentages, sometimes you get really bulky tails that shouldn't be so bulky, like something might have 0.5% and then it's priced at 4%, for example, that kind of thing. That's generally a factor of the fact that it can be quite expensive from a capital standpoint to take the no side. If you want to bet no, you're having to put a lot of money and wait six months to get a tiny bit of return.
00:39:03.092 - 00:39:15.880, Speaker A: So you end up getting like fat tails because no one's willing to skew those. But this 64% for Trump, it's not going to be too far off.
00:39:16.500 - 00:39:33.774, Speaker C: So let's talk about the long tail. So Michelle Obama is a good one to pick on. It's at 4% here right now. Michelle Obama, I think yesterday or the day before she made an official announcement that said she's really not going to run. There's no chance happening. All of the chatter we've seen has said if it's not Biden, it's Harris. That's what the prediction market says.
00:39:33.774 - 00:39:50.750, Speaker C: Are you saying that Michelle Obama is, let's say, overinflated here to 4% when really the actual odds are close to half a percent? Because to bring this back down to the rate of, let's say, half a percent, you would have to buy. No. At such a price that you're basically like, underperforming the risk free rate on the dollar.
00:39:50.870 - 00:40:00.772, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly what you said. Now, I don't want to talk about the specific Michelle Obama example because who knows? Yeah, maybe there's some insight, like, whatever, but as a general rule, that's correct.
00:40:00.916 - 00:40:23.684, Speaker C: And then you mentioned that liquidity is a huge concern. So we've seen other markets like predicted is in the single digit millions, poly markets in the quarter of a billion. How much closer do we get to the source of truth as we go from just like a million dollars bet to a quarter of a billion, is it like the first million gets us 95% of the way there to being accurate and the rest is just honing in? Have, does that work?
00:40:23.812 - 00:40:38.520, Speaker A: No, I think the first million is just pure noise. I mean, it's probably 20% of the information. It depends on the market. But if it's a us presidential market, then you definitely need nine figures to get to 90% of the information.
00:40:39.020 - 00:41:03.960, Speaker C: And I also wanted to ask, because I've heard some people say that these prediction markets become highly accurate because it's a way to extract insider information. You know, me and you might be betting on Biden. Yes or no, he's going to win, but we don't really have any edge or insider information and we cancel each other out. But the marginal dollar is actually the insider dollar that's betting on that. Like, do you hold any stock in that theory, or is this just purely like a wisdom of the crowd?
00:41:04.580 - 00:41:41.474, Speaker A: No, 100%. I fully believe in the insiders, but this is kind of why I insist so much that you need deep liquidity. You have to think of the motivation of the insider. If the downside upside ratio is not great, they're not going to express their view on these markets, because if they're not going to be able to hit enough liquidity to make, let's say, 500k on the fact that they know something. And the downside is they're leaking and they're found out to be leaking, or they get into some legal trouble or even reputational hit, they're not going to do it. If there is ten k of liquidity there, they're just going to let the market be wrong. It's not worth it.
00:41:41.474 - 00:42:13.128, Speaker A: Not worth it to fix it. So there's definitely insiders and they need deep books to act. Now, the tricky thing with these markets generally bootstrapping the passive liquidity as a market maker, that's just placing passive bids and waiting for somebody to hit. You are at the mercy of insiders, and you're at the mercy of not even just insiders. It could just be Like a headline, new headline. Biden had a heart attack. Like you're sitting on the bid, bidding him at 13%.
00:42:13.128 - 00:42:47.566, Speaker A: It's about to go to zero. What is Your motivation to be sitting there? It's kind of like you're GivinG a free option to market because that's what passive bids are. They're like a free option that you're giving out. The reason why people generally put them out is because they get easy, cheap, dumb liquidity to fill them. So they make spread of. So you need enough non insiders to trade to make it worth it when you're getting the toxic fills. And it's hard to get that ratio right.
00:42:47.566 - 00:43:03.818, Speaker A: And it's why you usually only have one big market per cycle. So if polymarket is doing really well and it ends up being the main one, it's really hard to bootstrap a second one because people are going to want to just provide liquidity on the first one.
00:43:03.994 - 00:43:18.870, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to ask, do you know of any of your colleagues, other market making firms that are actually have started to market make on polymarket? Like how much of this do you think is just organic retail professional speculators? And how much of the liquidity here is professionally provided by market makers?
00:43:19.450 - 00:43:55.410, Speaker A: So it's not going to be the same type of market makers that you're used to for financial products are specialists both for sports and politics that focus just on this. So it will be a lot of professional market making, but it's not going to be your, you know, Salini and Wintermute. It's going to be like the guys that are just focused on, on this stuff. I mean, GCR is one that he was like the biggest politics better in the world for years before he did crypto. So it'll be people that are just very focused on this one category.
00:43:55.950 - 00:44:25.666, Speaker C: Got it. I want to get to the Dan Robinson thread, but there's one last question I want to ask. So by far the biggest criticism I see of polymarket, specifically on crypto Twitter, is that polymarket has this huge bias because crypto native people are the ones that use polymarket because you have to use USDC to use it. And we all know, or we all think we know that crypto people lean right. So they're going to have a bias towards betting on a Trump win. Now, personally, I think I completely disagree with this because that would just mean the market is completely inefficient. Right.
00:44:25.666 - 00:44:40.990, Speaker C: If we knew there was a republican or right leaning edge, then you could just bet the other side and on average you'd come out a winner because the market's mispriced. Do you agree that, do you agree with my thinking or do you agree with sort of like the standard pushback against polymarket that it leans conservative?
00:44:42.810 - 00:45:21.160, Speaker A: There's always going to be people willing to come in and take the money if there's enough of a mispricing. So I'm more on your side. Generally you can see a little bit of sku bias. You see this, for example, whenever England is playing in the World cup or some team that has a lot of people betting on them, the odds might say England's going to win the World Cup 20% of the time when the reality is like 16%. And even though people know it's mispriced, it's got so much flow that it'll misprice. But it can't misprice too much. There's always going to be somebody willing to come in, but.
00:45:22.860 - 00:45:23.284, Speaker B: There'S a little.
00:45:23.292 - 00:45:25.916, Speaker A: Bit of truth to it. I remember Conor McGregor.
00:45:26.108 - 00:45:34.760, Speaker C: I was at that fight when he broke his leg, and I remember people telling me he's going to lose, but he's just, he's the favorite because everyone wants to bet on Conor. You don't want to bet on the other guy.
00:45:35.380 - 00:46:03.738, Speaker A: Yeah. And even when he was fighting Mayweather and he was a dog, the odds were still giving him like 20% when he was probably like 1%. He's not going to beat Mayweather at boxing, but some people wanted to bet on him. And even though people were providing liquidity to match the demand, they didn't fully arbitrage it to the fair price. So there's a little bit of that. But I think in Trump's case, it looks pretty reasonable to me.
00:46:03.834 - 00:46:23.720, Speaker C: Got it. And then I know you responded to this thread from Dan Robinson. Dan Robinson basically points out the inaccuracies of prediction markets. Do you want to just give a high level of his case of what he's saying and maybe sort of explain his side of the argument that prediction markets are not a perfect oracle for the source of truth of, you know, like, where these odds should be at.
00:46:24.220 - 00:46:40.344, Speaker A: Yeah. If you click on his, like, initial survey he was trying to do, he says, okay, if an event happens at 75% probability, what is the prediction market probably going to price it at? I see, I see. You bet on 70%.
00:46:40.352 - 00:46:43.260, Speaker C: No, no. These are the final results. I didn't vote on this.
00:46:46.840 - 00:47:10.260, Speaker A: Yeah. People just assume like 75. Yeah. It can be anywhere between. Between zero and a dollar because there's multiple factors to look at. One is we see Josh Lin below saying that it's going to be less than 75 because people are risk seeking and looking for convex payouts. That's not necessarily true.
00:47:10.260 - 00:47:49.650, Speaker A: There could be people that are looking to hedge to, like, the outcome because they're already priced in for it and they just want to hedge. There could be. Yeah. So you can go back to his response, but he says the answer is d. It could be anywhere from zero to one, which I agree, it could be anywhere from zero to one. I think what Dan Robinson is trying to point out is that there's a lot of reasons why the market might be pricing differently, and partly is because the outcome itself affects the underlying. So let's say you're betting on is the world going to be hit by a meteor tomorrow? And let's say the chance was 10%.
00:47:49.650 - 00:48:07.900, Speaker A: If the world's going to end anyway, then I don't really care about winning the bet. So I will never bet on yes, and it'll just be at 0%, even if the chance is 10%, because there's no point for me to win that bet. I might as well bet no and hope that I can make a few cents and the world keeps existing.
00:48:08.720 - 00:48:43.252, Speaker C: I wanted to ask one final question. So just to pull up the Democrat nominee prediction market here. Um, I don't know if you guys were watching this as closely as I was over, like, the last three days, but this was, like, one of the most volatile things I've ever seen. It seemed to me, like every time there was a new headline, like, the odds would flip. Like, we found out Joe Biden was meeting with his family on Sunday, and then suddenly was, Kamala was the front runner. And then Joe Biden came out and said he wasn't going to back out, and then he became the front runner. And we kept, there was just so much volatility and, like, the market was just swinging in massive amounts.
00:48:43.252 - 00:49:03.200, Speaker C: $83 million has been bet here. So presumably a lot of capital was, like, constantly, like, changing positions, betting on different outcomes. Does that indicate at all that, like, there's less insider activity than we might have thought? Because, like, the market was clearly, like, inefficient if it was just being so volatile so quickly, or there's just no correlation there.
00:49:03.900 - 00:49:25.358, Speaker A: Yeah, probably, like, less insight around this. Sometimes there were. Nobody really knows what's going to happen. I mean, Joe Biden himself might not know. Like, the insiders might not know. I saw much more volatile than this. If you were trading prediction markets during the 2016 Hillary Clinton Trump election, there was a moment where it went from 90% Hillary.
00:49:25.358 - 00:49:45.358, Speaker A: I think after, like, some of the first states had come out, it was looking really, really strong for Hillary. And then within, like, ten minutes, it had flipped to under 50%. And it was just, like, some crazy fluctuations based on just a few polls coming in from, like, Florida, I think, at the time.
00:49:45.534 - 00:50:18.828, Speaker B: So, yeah, I had, like, one question. So if you pull the democratic nominee, it's like Biden is leading at 44. But if you look back to the actual election, I think Kamala was leading above Biden. Does that mean that the market is inefficient, or does it mean more so that, you know, if Biden wins the democratic nominee, he's less likely to win. But if Kamala actually got the nomination, like, her likelihood of winning is much higher than Biden, therefore, you know, it's definitely 13.
00:50:18.964 - 00:50:19.308, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:19.364 - 00:50:20.040, Speaker B: Okay.
00:50:20.500 - 00:50:38.520, Speaker A: People obviously can do these basic conditionals and just filter in. They'll filter down from nomination into winner. So they'll say that if Biden is the nominee, he only really has 25% chance to win. So they'll multiply the 44 by 0.25.
00:50:39.380 - 00:50:40.108, Speaker B: Got it.
00:50:40.204 - 00:50:53.680, Speaker C: And the last question, maybe this is a good way to close out the topic. If you could only use one. Would you rather rely on, like, the classic polling, the Nate silvers of the world, and, like, the polling data, or would you rely on the prediction market data?
00:50:54.140 - 00:51:03.000, Speaker A: Everybody knows prediction market by far better. Like, it's not even close, because they'll. They're the aggregator of the polling data. So.
00:51:04.730 - 00:51:27.362, Speaker C: So do you see us heading to a world where polymarket, or something like polymarket, replaces this idea of polling, because polling is so pervasive in politics. It's like even Trump and Biden to this day, they talk about how they're leading in the polls and they're winning in polls in certain key states and whatnot. Do you think over the next decade or so, everyone's going to be saying, I'm leading in the poly market? If poly market continues to be the.
00:51:27.386 - 00:52:16.110, Speaker A: Biggest one, it needs to get bigger. It needs to get into the billions of dollars trading. I think part of that is sorting out the regulatory side completely. I'm not exactly sure polymarket has any regulatory issues, but you want to just have full liquidity where we've heard it, like rumors sometimes, where campaigns, or just like we talked about sometimes with Avo, hyper liquid pre market that the team might, like, buy the token, make people think it's going to launch at 15 billion FTV and it launches at five. If you're going to be using it as a talking point at a debate or something, or at a convention, you don't want to make it less than a million dollars to move the market in your direction, to be actually reliable.
00:52:16.890 - 00:52:45.204, Speaker C: Yeah. Also very interesting. I believe polymarket is using just like a standard amm. So all of you know, if you look at the prediction, the election winner, these are all like binary outcomes, and they're all individual, and I believe they're all just like straight amms. You can see how much, like you can move the poly market for Donald Trump. You know, if you start getting into the hundred thousands, you're already moving the odds from sixty four cents to sixty six. If you were to put a million dollars in, you know, you basically push the price up to a dollar.
00:52:45.204 - 00:52:52.088, Speaker C: So, pretty inefficient markets right now, as far as like old school AMM design, it'll be interesting on the top, right?
00:52:52.104 - 00:52:54.016, Speaker A: If you click on market, is there like a limit bid?
00:52:54.048 - 00:52:55.136, Speaker C: And then, yeah, you can do limit.
00:52:55.168 - 00:52:57.296, Speaker A: Orders like an amm. Okay.
00:52:57.368 - 00:52:57.592, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:52:57.616 - 00:52:59.900, Speaker A: And then what is like, can you provide liquidity?
00:53:00.880 - 00:53:07.420, Speaker C: You can provide liquidity, yeah. I'm not sure what the AMM toggle, how the AMM toggle different differs, but.
00:53:09.600 - 00:53:11.780, Speaker B: Once, those comments are ridiculous.
00:53:12.280 - 00:53:19.456, Speaker A: Maybe there's both an AMF and a limitable order book. Maybe there's both. Maybe like, there's they're overlaid on top of each other is probably more likely.
00:53:19.648 - 00:53:40.180, Speaker C: And you can also see like the word, the spread here in the order book. And then you can see they're also giving rewards. I thought this was hilarious though. But the rewards are only 600 USDC for liquidity providers who provide within a $0.01 price spread, which I thought was like a hilariously low amount of incentives. But that just goes to show, I guess, like, this thing is working without incentives, which is pretty cool.
00:53:40.650 - 00:54:19.836, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'm always of the opinion that these things eventually need to just become a limit order book. It's by far the best price discovery method. Anything else is inferior. And I understand it's hard sometimes to get enough liquidity to get enough market makers, and that's part of the challenge. So that's kind of why you get these intermediate solutions. But yeah, bet fair, I guess, is the gold standard for doing it properly. And, yeah, so here we can see what bet fair looks like, which I think is really the right way to do this, where if you want to place a bid, you just decide what price.
00:54:19.836 - 00:55:01.500, Speaker A: And I think Donald Trump at, you know, 170 is a decent size, and you can see the outcomes that will happen in either scenario. The cool thing is you can bet different people and then you only get, you only pay on your profit, on your net profit. So you can eventually cancel, cancel wins and losses out in the same book automatically. Some people were saying that this is like an amazing thing polymarket's doing, but this is sort of, it's just table stakes. You need to be able to cancel out your wins and losses.
00:55:02.120 - 00:55:21.020, Speaker C: It's so interesting though. It looks like this market, it says matched 23 million pounds. Jordy, it looks like that's changed to 13 million pounds. Is that how much volume has actually been matched here? And so how much has been bet on this market? So polymarket's like an order of magnitude more.
00:55:21.520 - 00:55:49.920, Speaker A: Yeah, because now this is only like available for UK. They've about giving accounts to people not in the UK. And I'm in London right now, which is why I'm able to use this. But you can see that for 23 million bet, there's only like really a lot of liquidity on the inside. Trump that. Everything else is pretty sparse. So let's say, you know that Gavin Newsom is going to be the nominee.
00:55:49.920 - 00:55:55.980, Speaker A: You can probably only get like 1000 pounds in. Unfortunately you can't make a lot of money.
00:55:56.100 - 00:55:58.116, Speaker B: Polymarket has good product fit.
00:55:58.308 - 00:56:23.020, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. And before we go to pasta, given that we're in a little bit of a bear market, I'm just kind of curious to ask the two of you since you're active in the space and doing things in the space, has it affected your roadmaps? Are you changing your strategies or maybe Taiki, you can tell us how you're seeing it.
00:56:23.600 - 00:56:55.628, Speaker B: Yeah, so I guess I run a community, like pseudo community research firm. And when the market started pumping earlier this year, I was like, okay, I need more brain power. So I already had two analysts, but I hired three. But recently the market's been pretty slow, pretty choppy and it's really hard for me to figure out what the ROI on that spend is. So in the past week, I unfortunately had to let go of two people. Kind of sad, but yeah.
00:56:55.764 - 00:56:58.412, Speaker A: Is it the first time you had to let someone go?
00:56:58.596 - 00:57:40.522, Speaker B: Yeah, first time, yeah, they were part time. So it's not as hard as, you know, like having a full time employee and having to let them go. But you know, when I broke the news, I could see the sadness in their eyes, which was kind of sad. But, you know, it is what it is, right? I think we all operate some form of a business. Like we all operate in the space and I think it's so cyclical that you do have to cut costs. Come to truth with, okay, is it worth the ROI? Is the money spent worth it? And yeah, that's kind of what I had to do recently. How about you, Justin or Jordy? Because you both operate your business as well.
00:57:40.596 - 00:58:09.184, Speaker C: Yeah, I can chime in. Curious to hear your thoughts. True, Jordy. And I think maybe we could dedicate a larger segment to this if people are interested. So let us know in the comments. But I think like the name of the game for startups, or really like any organization, is to be able to pivot when something isn't working and try to get to like an MVP, a minimum viable product as soon as possible to see if you can get product market fit. And for us at Astaria, like, we've been in the lending space for two years, so we raised money on the idea of an NFT lending app.
00:58:09.184 - 00:58:37.452, Speaker C: We launched two iterations of that, but our timing was off and we didn't have product market fit. So nfts were dying. We launched it when nfts were dying. No one wanted to borrow against their jpegs, and jpegs have since never recovered. And so we pivoted from that to an ERC 20 lending product. And unfortunately for us, we weren't quick enough. Maybe we just didn't build enough, a compelling enough product, but we have seen some traction there.
00:58:37.452 - 00:59:19.660, Speaker C: But I wouldn't say clear product market fit. And so now we're in this point in the cycle where like everyone knows that DeFi is in a tough spot. It's unclear like where DeFi will be in the next few years. And so now we're in the process of exploring a pivot again to a new web3 social application. And it is really tough to go through those different cycles and to sort of like be reacting to how volatile the market is in your product. Because like ultimately we all just want to like build and deliver the best products to you users. But because we're in an industry that is so volatile and dictated so much by price, we find ourselves sort of like switching up our product to sort of try to meet the market where it is.
00:59:19.660 - 01:00:12.174, Speaker C: So it is challenging. One other little tidbit I'll say is we were talking to an investor about our lending application, our ERC 20 lending app, and we were sharing, like how it's innovative, how it's different, seeing if there was a way we could work together. And I'll never forget he said to us, well, on one hand, Defi is in a really bad spot now. Who knows if we're going to see DeFi tokens do well? But he said, on the other hand, Defi has been around for over five years now, and so it's sort of like a de risk category. And when I thought about that, I was like, I'll never forget DeFi being five years old that's just such a long period of time. And if you look at the last five years in the DeFi space specifically, there really hasn't been much new products created that are really zero to one s. And so that's been something really interesting to think about.
01:00:12.174 - 01:00:23.410, Speaker C: And yeah, we've had to pivot a lot and it is tough and hopefully eventually we get somewhere where we'll have good product market fit and can finally launch our token and do well and get this thing out there.
01:00:24.070 - 01:01:57.140, Speaker A: Look, I mean, every time you pivot, you go with the new knowledge that you've acquired from the experience you just built and the, you know, things that didn't work out, you learn a lot from them. And I think it's actually good to pivot because this space is very new and a lot of the stuff that people thought was going to be a big category just, you know, doesn't even exist anymore. If you have a strong building team and you have good technical expertise, why not go where, you know, the interest seems to be? If it seems to be in social fi, then it's not like a cyclical thing where one year it's social fine and it's going to go back to, it's probably just a one way road and you're trying to keep pace and get the timing right. So I think it's good to pivot. The one thing that surprised me is that this infrastructure only investing has worked for so long. I think we're finally starting to see the for the first time in like ten years since like the first polychain like fund, it could be the first signs that investing just like an infrastructure and l one s that, you know, seem to get all the, you know, premium of being an l one. And the infrastructure premium that seems to be coming back down a little bit, we're seeing with the latest launches, it's not so clear that you can just launch any blockchain and get multi billion dollar valuations on it.
01:01:57.140 - 01:02:23.616, Speaker A: I am a little bit relieved because it never made sense that you give these premiums to these chains that no one's actually using. There's no users, there's no activity. I would much rather see, even though I think polymarkets overvalued. Things like that get the big valuations and it does feel like we're due for a rotation into application layer.
01:02:23.768 - 01:02:56.986, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll also say I was listening to Chao's good game podcast and he was talking about how it really is a good time to build an application. It is harder to get funding for an application than like a layer one. I agree that's changing now. But as Chao pointed out, and it's actually true, is like, chains are paying massive sums of money for projects to come to their chain, because there is nothing more valuable than an application right now. The application is actually the really novel, innovative, useful thing. The chain is the commodity. And hopefully that just means we're going to get more and more apps and better apps.
01:02:57.138 - 01:03:44.964, Speaker B: I think Anatoly from Solana said this, where he wants the total aggregate market cap of all the apps on Solana to be bigger than Solana market cap itself. And I think that's a better way to think about it. And I know for a fact that Solana is handing out massive grants to anyone that's building actual consumer apps. So I think that's kind of the direction Solana is going towards maybe more experimental use cases and maybe ETH is still stuck in this research heavy ZK roll up, infra aggregate liquidity, optimistic super chain, that type of meta. So it'll be really interesting to see how 2025 rolls out. I actually think it's also, like a really good time to fund and invest and also build apps, because for crypto to go mainstream, we need apps, so someone has to make it.
01:03:45.132 - 01:03:56.080, Speaker A: That's been the main mispricing in the market, I think, for years, is just the overvaluation of the blockchains, as if they have this halo effect, like, wow, avalanche.
01:03:57.100 - 01:03:58.480, Speaker C: Avax is money.
01:04:00.450 - 01:04:35.846, Speaker A: The reality is that the, the founders have realized it because they're the ones building and they're like, we're not doing anything special. This is just like a frigging blockchain. Whatever. Like, you need culture users, you need, like, all the other stuff. And we've seen examples, some public, some not so public. When I say public, it's probably the Avax meme coin fund, where they're like, well, we might as well spend $100 million buying meme coins, and that'll, you know, maybe increase our valuation by more than 1% that it costs. I've heard that Solana has probably done quite a lot of the same with supporting things on their chain.
01:04:35.846 - 01:04:57.196, Speaker A: I don't want to get into details, but, you know, spending their money on that layer, because they realize it's actually, the longer term value is bigger there. So might as well rotate the halo effect l one money into. Into further down the chain.
01:04:57.388 - 01:05:32.770, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, just imagine how successful our space would be if we had ten apps of the same magnitude of success as polymarket right now with the mainstream. Of course, we have uniswap in its incredible Aave Solana apps, but I think polymarket is really one of the few applications that has entered pop culture, and I think it's going to be really an incredible election season for polymarket. Right now, we're at a quarter billion bet on the presidential winner. Clearly, that number is going to a billion over the next several months. So, I mean, just imagine where we'd be if we had ten apps that hit the mainstream like that and obfuscated crypto away from. From their users.
01:05:33.710 - 01:06:04.590, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, we'll see if these things are based on regulatory arbitrage, the fact that it's possible accessibility that otherwise hard to get, or if there's deeper reasons for replacing web two products. Cool. Let's finish with a pasta of the week. It's been a good, reflective episode, so let's see if you guys have reflective pastas. I know I do. Do you want to kick off Taiki?
01:06:05.090 - 01:06:13.762, Speaker B: All right. All right. So I think this is a good pasta, given what we talked about in the first half an hour of this episode, but let's wait for this to load.
01:06:13.826 - 01:06:14.390, Speaker A: I.
01:06:14.880 - 01:06:29.140, Speaker B: This is, like, my fiance, right? And her dad, like, does he even have real money? He's not broke, dad. He's just waiting for Altseason. So, you know, this is the story of my life, and, unfortunately, the story of my fiance's life.
01:06:29.800 - 01:06:33.940, Speaker C: You know, when you're in crypto, you have to. You have those questions a lot, right? They come up.
01:06:34.600 - 01:06:39.666, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, isn't it. Isn't it all a Ponzi? Like, isn't it real money? Or is it a.
01:06:39.728 - 01:06:43.010, Speaker A: He's not broke, dad. He's just waiting for the next celestial airdrop.
01:06:45.110 - 01:06:52.250, Speaker B: I'm still waiting, dude. I'm still waiting. I have staked. I've auto compounded my rewards. I'm waiting. I'm waiting.
01:06:54.670 - 01:07:09.230, Speaker C: I don't want to bull market for the price to go up. I just want a bull market so that when I tell someone above the age of 45 to 50 that I work in the crypto space, I don't just see, like, a look of disappointment and sadness like that. This, you know, I want to see, like, a little smirk or a smile.
01:07:11.010 - 01:07:13.910, Speaker B: I want them to be proud of you. Yeah, proud. Proud of us.
01:07:14.970 - 01:07:16.550, Speaker A: All right, Justin, what do you got?
01:07:16.890 - 01:07:44.522, Speaker C: Yeah, so this. This might offend some folks, but it is July 4, and so I think this is a very topical one. Also, with etc coming up, a lot of us are headed there. I know Jordy and I are going to be there, so make sure to say hi. But this is. This is the mental model of the west. We've got the USA and on the left curve and the right curve, we've got by far the dumbest people in the world, and we also have the brightest people flocking to the Us.
01:07:44.522 - 01:08:01.064, Speaker C: We do the dumbest things and also the best things. Then you just have Europe in this, like, complete mid curve center. So. Sorry, Jordi, if that's. That's offensive to you. I know you're in the UK right now, and to our european listeners, but I think this is, like, a perfect encapsulation of the west right now.
01:08:01.232 - 01:08:02.180, Speaker A: No comment.
01:08:03.640 - 01:08:04.580, Speaker B: No comment.
01:08:05.840 - 01:08:30.610, Speaker A: All right. I have a. I have a reflective pasta. And this was posted by recti immediate. You know, it's all about perspective. And you got the one guy looking at the stars saying, looking at the night sky makes me realize how puny and insignificant I am on the cosmic scale. And then the chad says, I am the result of 14 billion years of cosmic evolution.
01:08:30.610 - 01:08:35.710, Speaker A: I am a thermodynamic miracle. I am the waking universe looking back at itself.
01:08:36.730 - 01:08:37.618, Speaker C: So it's all about.
01:08:37.674 - 01:08:43.042, Speaker A: It's all about perspective. You know, it's maybe a tough period.
01:08:43.186 - 01:08:45.690, Speaker C: Which one are you, Jordy? I think you're the guy on the bottom.
01:08:45.730 - 01:09:10.208, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm trying to be the guy on the bottom. You know, I think that's what we should all ascribe to. Yeah, I it makes a lot of sense. Like, there is no reason. They both make sense, but there is no reason why you shouldn't be more like the Chad. And so let's try to take everything with a positivity. And, yeah, there's always opportunity.
01:09:10.208 - 01:09:17.870, Speaker A: And even when the markets are red, maybe there are some interesting opportunities. So, what's happening?
01:09:18.330 - 01:09:22.750, Speaker B: Thanks for that, Jordi. I'm gonna continue to stake my tia for the next intro.
01:09:24.290 - 01:09:28.130, Speaker C: You are unburdened by what has been, by what could be. With Tia.
01:09:28.290 - 01:09:31.750, Speaker A: You are a thermodynamic miracle type.
01:09:32.890 - 01:09:36.722, Speaker B: How am I still alive? Am I still here?
01:09:36.866 - 01:09:37.790, Speaker A: Oh, man.
01:09:38.130 - 01:09:41.858, Speaker B: Actually, maybe I let go of my analysts so I can fund my. My ta staking.
01:09:41.914 - 01:09:49.258, Speaker A: One more, Tia. Just keep firing them so you can find one more clip. Just one more clip.
01:09:49.394 - 01:09:51.150, Speaker B: Just one more. Just one more.
01:09:52.290 - 01:09:58.830, Speaker A: All right, everybody. Well, thanks for joining, and I hope you had a good July 4. We'll catch you next week. Take care.
