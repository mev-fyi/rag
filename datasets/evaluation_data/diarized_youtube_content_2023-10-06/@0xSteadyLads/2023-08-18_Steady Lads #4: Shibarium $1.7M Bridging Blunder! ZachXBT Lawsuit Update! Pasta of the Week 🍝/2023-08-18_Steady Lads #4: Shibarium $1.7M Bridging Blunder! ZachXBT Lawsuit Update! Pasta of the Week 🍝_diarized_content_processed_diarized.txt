00:00:20.160 - 00:00:47.214, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody, to another exciting episode of steady lads. We have some really exciting topics to go through today, plus a new segment at the end. So we're curious to see, see in the comments what you guys think about it. So as usual, I have with me Taiki, the humble farmer. I have Justin, the head of Astaria, and I have Thiki, who is the bus boy at Scimitar Capital. Hoping for a promotion, hopefully soon. So, yeah, there's a lot to get into.
00:00:47.214 - 00:00:49.182, Speaker A: Justin, what do you wanna kick off?
00:00:49.358 - 00:01:03.936, Speaker B: Let's talk shibarium. I think that's where we ended episode three, thicky. What's going on over there? I've seen some. Some crazy stuff on Twitter. I think there's a ton of ETH stuck in a bridge, from what I heard. Is Shibarium dead on arrival? What's. What's going on?
00:01:04.040 - 00:01:27.086, Speaker C: Yeah, I think. I think Shib is pretty dead. I give kind of a recap of what's happened since last week, story wise. So the Shib conference was. They've. So they. They sponsored the blockchain futurist event in Toronto on the 15th to the 16th in the days leading up to the conference, like, Shib's pumped maybe 30, 40%.
00:01:27.086 - 00:01:58.014, Speaker C: But Voyager, who had maybe $15 million worth of Shib, started selling all of their spot. They just transferred two to $3 million clips in the coinbase and very much stifled the pump. Pushed it back down 10% when we let up into the initial. So there are two days. The first day, Shytoshi Kusama, who is the lead dev at Shibarium, was giving a talk and it was kind of hype. You know, price built up like six, 7%.
00:01:59.514 - 00:02:00.454, Speaker A: Kusama.
00:02:00.914 - 00:02:16.930, Speaker C: Shytoshi Kusama. Okay. He's, um. I think the backstory is that he's one of the co founders of Shib that actually held on to all their shib and then dumped it at the top and, like, is worth like a few billion dollars now.
00:02:17.082 - 00:02:17.814, Speaker D: Wow.
00:02:20.774 - 00:02:26.634, Speaker C: He's completely anonymous, but he is boxed. So, like. Yeah, his name is like, Neymar. He, like, lives in LA.
00:02:27.294 - 00:02:34.502, Speaker B: And you, were you in person? You went to this conference to see them speak at the OR? What happened? Were you streaming it?
00:02:34.638 - 00:02:45.202, Speaker C: I was streaming it, yeah. I wanted to go. I was really heavily considering making a trip out to Toronto just to watch it, but glad I did it, you know? I don't know if you saw some of the talks. They were like, very, very cringe.
00:02:45.358 - 00:03:01.330, Speaker B: No, I missed the talks. I will. I'll pull up a few things. We had to share, though. So this is the shib chart. So you can see sort of a, like a broader sell off here. And it looks like, I don't know, thinking maybe this number is not up to date.
00:03:01.330 - 00:03:12.504, Speaker B: But as of this tweet, about $1.7 million worth of ETH stuck in the bridge. What. What's happening there? Is it permanently stuck? Do you think they'll be able to recover it? Any insight with that?
00:03:12.624 - 00:03:22.764, Speaker C: I need to confirm, but I think it's permanently stuck. There is this even funnier one with a picture of Shytoshi himself in a telegram chat. And he was like, guys, I fucked up. All the eat is stuck in the bridge.
00:03:23.864 - 00:03:42.380, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we have that one here. This was actually going to be my tweet for a new segment, but, yeah, it's absolutely hilarious. It looks like this is, like, a Snapchat message or maybe just something from telegram, but, yeah, not great. So are you out of shape? Like, what's. What's your plan there?
00:03:42.532 - 00:04:05.148, Speaker C: Yeah, my plan is to. I'm still in my shorts. I was in and out all week. I shorted also when they had a hyped announcement and ended up just being Shytoshi announcing his book deal, like, 44 ten minutes of crypto trading. Yeah, it was very hype, but, yeah, ended up being just a book deal that he was shilling. I think I'm going to hold it to zero. Like, like, legitimately hold this thing to zero.
00:04:05.148 - 00:04:13.980, Speaker C: I think with shibarium gone, like, shiba is just, you know, completely dead. Like, actually, the exchanges are going to delist it, and. Yeah, that's what. That's my target.
00:04:14.092 - 00:04:21.852, Speaker B: And you're. And you're holding to zero because you're into the fin dom stuff yourself, or you're just a committed bag holder.
00:04:21.948 - 00:04:28.820, Speaker C: Oh, I forgot to. I forgot to say. Yeah, I flipped short after the podcast last week.
00:04:28.972 - 00:04:33.664, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry, everybody, like, you know, told you I was long, but as soon as the podcast ended, I flipped.
00:04:35.784 - 00:04:56.272, Speaker D: Scimitar capital, man. I'm curious to get people's thoughts on, like, meme coins in general, because right now, like, there's pepe, like, the Harry Potter bomba sonic ten inu, and people think that, you know, the old dot coins are dead. Like, do you think doge and Shiva is just gonna dwindle down, like, slowly to zero and, like, pepe is gonna take over? Like, what do you guys think about that?
00:04:56.368 - 00:05:25.404, Speaker A: I don't think the new ones can hold a candle to the doge. I don't know. We'll always get new ones. I think the. The generation twos and generation threes might have a harder time, but the Ogs, like doge, will always have some status. But I don't know, like, the Harry Potter Obama Sonic Inu one. It just reaches new levels of, you know, redacting.
00:05:26.264 - 00:05:52.412, Speaker B: So I have a little different take on this. So the only thing I'm holding in any, like, real size right now is ethanol, um, for better or worse. And I think, though, like, doge is going to have a better return if they're, you know, in the next cycle. That's just my thesis. I also think Shib will as well. I mean, you're taking on a lot more risk, but, like, at the end of the day, we know what's going to happen, right? Like, the playbook has been written. Like, BTC or ETH are going to lead.
00:05:52.412 - 00:06:16.224, Speaker B: Lead us out of a bear market. There's going to be new innovations, new applications built. And then eventually, when the prices are high enough, people are going to start to look at Doge and shib and say, wait a minute, these things never pumped. They're undervalued relative to bitcoin and ethan. These other coins and l one s that are pumping, like, let's buy that. And that's going to be the narrative for a few weeks on Twitter, and these things are going to go absolutely crazy again. Um, you know, I'm not a fan of it.
00:06:16.224 - 00:06:36.770, Speaker B: I think it's sort of silly, and it distracts from what we're doing. Like, all that of that energy Elon put into Doge last cycle, uh, was a huge distraction and sort of, like, discredits everything about crypto. But I think that's what's going to happen. You know? Like, I'm not going to trade on it myself, but I think, yeah, doge is probably going to be a good play.
00:06:36.922 - 00:06:49.694, Speaker A: We'll see. I think Shib holding to zero is aggressive. You know, if jump was able to bail out wormhole bridge for 300,000 ETH, and this guy's supposed to be a billionaire, I mean, he should be able to do 1000 ETH, right?
00:06:50.234 - 00:06:53.866, Speaker D: Think about all those book book deals and those royalties.
00:06:54.050 - 00:06:56.534, Speaker A: Keep. Keep the. Keep the bones coming.
00:06:58.094 - 00:07:00.354, Speaker C: We'll make Shytoshi pay the iron price.
00:07:03.414 - 00:07:05.554, Speaker B: He'll just get liquidated on a bay.
00:07:06.494 - 00:07:32.432, Speaker C: I agree with Jordy's take, though, that, like, both. So I feel like new generation meme coins are kind of like that euthanasia roller coaster where, like, it still has a mini pump, but it's always just, like, best and less. I think it does kind of. It's a warning tale for meme projects that try to become utility as well or, like, have a fundamental value in having an l two. Yeah, they're just gonna do it really terribly, I think, and it's gonna set it up for disaster. Is like the takeaway from this.
00:07:32.608 - 00:07:34.744, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's sort of like what we see with Cardano.
00:07:34.784 - 00:07:34.960, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:34.992 - 00:07:57.658, Speaker B: It's like you never. When you're kind of just a meme coin, which I think Cardano is in a lot of ways, like, you never want to actually execute. Like, it's always better to just have the roadmap, which is really sad. Right. Like, when Cardano, I don't, if you guys remember, launched smart contracts at the peak of last cycle. Huge run up. And then they realized, like, oh, we can't actually execute on this.
00:07:57.658 - 00:08:11.946, Speaker B: Smart contracts on Cardano are, like, very hard to create. There's like some technical limitations and it's just down only from there. And, yeah, I think we're going to continue to see those sorts of things. Is like, the roadmap is always more bullish than the execution or the failed execution.
00:08:12.050 - 00:08:36.194, Speaker D: I have, like, a loosely held thesis that, like, maybe stacks like the bitcoin. Lt can be like the cardano of this cycle. It's like this idea around smart contracts on bitcoin. And I think I know, like, this promise. And especially if bitcoin pumps into the halving or pumps after the halving, I can definitely see SDX just go crazy. It's like, oh, like l two on bitcoin. Like, what a huge, total addressable market.
00:08:36.194 - 00:08:37.786, Speaker D: Have you guys looked into stocks at all?
00:08:37.850 - 00:09:00.994, Speaker A: There's been a few attempts to pump it around the ordinals time I remember that was. That was when we were getting inundated with a lot of stacks propaganda, but it seemed to die down right now. But you're right around the halving, it might come back up. So that's definitely one to just see if traction starts to happen.
00:09:01.614 - 00:09:10.536, Speaker C: I agree. I think having a very charismatic and savvy founder is one of the most important parts of the recipe for that kind of success.
00:09:10.710 - 00:09:38.846, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Charles Hoskinson is pretty high up on that list. Memeable. He controls the stage. I was watching some Masari conference highlights and every video has, like 100 views. But if you go to the Charles Hoskinson one where he's got this, like, massive belly and just walking around with his big, big belly, it's got like 40,000 views. So he knows how to be charismatic. He's built an army.
00:09:38.950 - 00:09:56.714, Speaker C: He was talking in the Shib conference, and he talked right before the ship announcement. The major one. Yeah, he was there. Charles Hoskins, also, like, another one of the co founders. It was actually kind of hype, but, yeah, great storyteller. I actually kind of want to learn from how good he tells stories. It's just, you know, man's got a silver tongue.
00:09:57.174 - 00:10:02.708, Speaker A: All right, next week on the podcast, Vicki will do his best storytelling impersonation.
00:10:02.846 - 00:10:04.768, Speaker B: Maybe we can get him on as a guest.
00:10:04.936 - 00:10:07.160, Speaker A: Well, you need to stop talking shit about Cardano.
00:10:07.272 - 00:10:08.164, Speaker C: Come on.
00:10:08.904 - 00:10:12.512, Speaker B: I mean, if he watches it. Yeah, I'll be very respectful.
00:10:12.608 - 00:10:14.208, Speaker A: Okay, Charles, we'll get you on.
00:10:14.256 - 00:10:14.536, Speaker B: We.
00:10:14.600 - 00:10:47.196, Speaker A: We do plan from next week to start trialing guest segments as well. We'll bring on guests from projects that are active in the space right now. And instead of just asking them to, you know, tell us boring shit about their project, we'll try to have a conversation about one aspect that is maybe a bit more spicy and try to keep you guys awake. So that'll be coming from next week. We've seen the launch of, say, this week, and maybe that'll be something to talk about next week. It's a little bit early now. We're in the middle of it.
00:10:47.196 - 00:11:12.086, Speaker A: There's a lot of tweets going around about the airdrop. Are people getting free airdrops by just moving 10,000 into the bridge and then, you know, just milking it? No one really knows exactly what's going on. I don't know. Maybe you guys have been following it. I haven't been that close on it, but maybe it's one to ask next week, once the dust clears. And talking about dust clearing. So, another big news that came out this week.
00:11:12.086 - 00:11:26.604, Speaker A: We can bring up the story from the dropped lawsuit, which I think many, many people in the crypto space. So we're happy to see. Thiki, you played a part in this as well.
00:11:27.904 - 00:12:13.146, Speaker C: Yeah, this was a really cool story. So, essentially, after the curve thing was happening, we were talking about the after effects, and Machi was one of the investors who invested OTC in curve really early. So I was on a spaces on Sunday talking about how the first tranche of curve investors, like I said, weren't, you know, the most virtuous crowd. And it happened that Machi was actually listening. So he, you know, invited himself up on the stage and, you know, understandably, he was, like, upset by my comments. He was like, you know, kind of went off on a rant about how he really resented those comments, but we were able to have some cool discussion afterwards. Jordy was on the spaces as well.
00:12:13.146 - 00:12:24.416, Speaker C: And, yeah, Jordy asked of Machi if he wanted to resolve, potentially resolve things in the DM's. This is relating to the case with Zack XPT?
00:12:24.600 - 00:12:57.946, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. He ended up messaging me and, you know, a week later. This is something that I think is great for the space because first of all, you know, Zack XPT, regardless of the specific article, whether it's fully accurate or, you know, was not, he has been very net positive for the space. And we don't want to just be, you know, facing north korean hackers all the time and have nobody as a defense line. And he's kind of like the immune system. He tracks stuff down.
00:12:57.946 - 00:13:54.062, Speaker A: He gives it to the authorities like we need him because otherwise, the proportion of crypto scammers and, like, you know, legit people in crypto just gets out of whack. So what I have to say is that regardless of whether someone's feelings are hurt because, you know, somebody called them out and maybe even made mistakes, maybe, you know, said something that they did wrong, maybe didn't. Who knows exactly what the truth is. And many times, we don't really have a way to know because the thing with blockchain detective work is it'll get you so far, it'll show you that some transactions were made, but it doesn't show you, you know, who was exactly clicking buttons and what exactly they were intending to do. And you don't know whose wallets are whose because, you know, unless it's world coin, there's. There's no physical eyeball scanning on the wallet. So I think what happened in this case was, you know, Maciej felt like the story, which we can.
00:13:54.062 - 00:14:26.654, Speaker A: We can bring up the article, the story of Machi Big Brother. It's been edited. Now, this is a medium post that came out last year that Zach wrote. And, you know, in this story, one of the salacious stories, the main centerpiece was around Formosa financial, which I've learned a lot about in the last couple weeks. So Formosa was a 2018 project. Now, this story initially had a title saying Jeff Wong embezzled 22,000 ETH from Formosa Financial. Like, that was kind of the claim.
00:14:26.654 - 00:15:25.324, Speaker A: And there was reasons to think that basically there was a 22,000 ETH transfer out of the ICO. Like, three weeks after the ICO happened, they raised all this ETH. And then half of it, out of the 44,000, half of it got transferred out into two wallets, and the wallets just deposited it into binance and it kind of moved around. Zach tries to do some detective work and see, you know, which devs it goes to, and it goes to some taiwanese devs. And, you know, the assumption was that Jeff Huang, who is Machi big brother, was the one getting this money, which he disputed and, you know, kept disputing throughout. Now, you know, I don't know what you guys think, but it's a game. It's an interesting game theory situation because, you know, if someone is personally damaged, like, their reputation, they feel is damaged from a game theory perspective.
00:15:25.324 - 00:16:09.350, Speaker A: Like, you can, you can kind of fight back and go to, like, legal and try to dox and, you know, go, go through this thing, but you're maybe hurting the community more than you're helping yourself, and then the community is going to kind of rush in and kind of attack you for hurting someone who is a key part of the community, regardless of whether you're right or wrong. So I sympathize with, with both sides. Right. I don't know what you guys would do in that situation. Like, what if you guys, like Justin, if you wake up one day and you see an article like, Justin Bram stole 5000 ETH from Astaria and transferred it to his wallet, like, let's say it was wrong. Let's just, let's just say it was wrong. What would you do?
00:16:09.462 - 00:16:37.498, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's a really interesting situation. This is, like, I think something we see all the time. And, like, obviously not just in crypto, in so many different industries. And the issue is, like, once these allegations, true or not, are out there, people already have their opinions, and their opinions are basically set. So what you can do is, you know, you post your rebuttal, and I know Machi did that. And I don't think people really bought into it too much. And I don't think this lawsuit or the withdrawal of the lawsuit changes their opinion.
00:16:37.498 - 00:17:09.482, Speaker B: I think this is sort of one of the things where you just have to, like, if you know you're right, you have to do your best to put the facts out there and hope that the truth is, like, what wins out. I'm not saying that's what happened with Machi. I don't know what the real situation is, but I think the more, like, people often think, like, oh, everyone's thinking about me. They care what I have to say. They care what happens with this. But, like, most people in Twitter just, you know, in crypto Twitter and in crypto just totally forgot about this, and I think the lawsuit brings more attention to it. That's negative, and I think withdrawing it brings more attention to it.
00:17:09.482 - 00:17:35.154, Speaker B: So I think it's sort of like, once these allegations are out there, there's not much you can do. You rebut the facts, and then the more attention you bring to it, the worse it is, because I think. I don't think anyone's opinion has changed substantially because Zach sued or because Machi sued. Because he withdrew the suit, because Zach updated the article. Like, I think people's conceptions about Machi are out there. I don't think, you know, addressing it is helpful for anyone.
00:17:35.274 - 00:18:10.596, Speaker A: Yeah, I think everyone takes their reputation very seriously, and they do want to defend it, and I. And I fully sympathize with that fact. And, you know, there were quite a lot of changes made to the article to keep it more fact based rather than speculation, because if you're not sure exactly whose wallet this is and you see some transfers, you know, it's better to be a bit more fact based. And I think, you know, the work Zach does, it's extremely valuable to the community. It's very hard work, and it is a very thankless task. You know, we've talked about it in the past where you're doing a benefit to other people, but then you're putting yourself at risk. You can get sued, you can get attacked.
00:18:10.596 - 00:18:38.150, Speaker A: You can get, you know, swatted, like, all kinds of danger you're putting yourself into. And, you know, yeah, you get some social credibility and all this stuff and a lot of support, which is nice, but there's a lot of negativity. And, I mean, tyke, you're one of the good guys in the space. I know. You know, in the past, I've personally offered you seed round allocations and projects I was excited about. And you're like, no, I keep clean. Like, I don't want to, you know, cloud.
00:18:38.150 - 00:18:49.384, Speaker A: I don't want to take anything. So do you think it's a thankless task to keep such a clean rep, or how do you see it for yourself?
00:18:49.844 - 00:19:41.264, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's all about having values, right, that you stand by. And, I mean, one of the reasons I don't participate in seed rounds is that if I'm making content and most of my audience is retail, I want to be able to empathize with, I guess, like, what they're going through. And if I'm, like, just getting, just circle jerking, all these seed deals, then I feel like I'll lose the motive and the drive to be really in the trenches. And there's the saying, it takes ten years to build a brand and one day to just send it to zero. And I feel like Zach is kind of this invisible hand in the markets, at least on crypto Twitter or crypto X, whatever you want to call it, that kind of moderates all the shady behavior. And I guess from a game theoretical perspective, if you don't want to deal with the technology potential of Zack writing a thread about you, it's like, don't do any shady stuff. It's good and bad, because Zack has a lot of power.
00:19:41.264 - 00:20:28.406, Speaker D: If Zach writes a thread on somebody, and even if he's wrong, if it's out there, it gets retweeted 10,000 times, and it tarnishes the person's reputation. So for that reason, I just don't do anything that might even be remotely considered shady. I think that's the best path forward. Of course, there's always. There's always scams and, like, rugs and crypto, where people just make a million dollars, like, you know, taking money from their followers, and then in, like, a month, people forget about it, and then they do, like, another scam. But I think, you know, I kind of view my platform, my brand, in, like, a long term lens. And, you know, part of the reason I wanted to do this podcast with the three of you is because I think, you know, you three are really, you know, great people that, you know, isn't, like, just there to, like, you know, make money from, like, their followers and whatnot.
00:20:28.406 - 00:20:44.310, Speaker D: So, you know, like, I think it's all about, like, having values, having, like, having ethics, I suppose. And I think that's something missing in crypto that I think will have a lot more value, like, in the future, because I think this space is going to grow, like, exponentially and how many.
00:20:44.382 - 00:20:51.126, Speaker A: How many bull markets until Taiki becomes the villain? He's gonna be the main character. He'll be.
00:20:51.150 - 00:20:56.472, Speaker D: So hopefully not I'm being sued. Like, what is going on?
00:20:56.558 - 00:21:41.632, Speaker A: But anyway, I mean, it's obviously positive for both sides. I think that this got resolved on machi side. He had a clear point, which was that in the story for most of financial, and I encourage people to read the story, it's quite fascinating. There was basically some people came together to do in 2018, an ICO around building a asset management sort of like a bank, like a crypto bank. And they had all these powerful people in Taiwan helping and building pieces, and then things went wrong because very early on, the team seemed to not get along, and some people broke ways. And I think that was kind of why ETH was transferred around. Like, some people got out, they got their money back, the shares were resold.
00:21:41.632 - 00:22:03.786, Speaker A: It's kind of unclear exactly what happened. Nobody knows. I think Macie's point was that he was not on the multisig of the wallet that was transferring the ETH. So his main defense, which I think was. Was quite a strong defense, was that he couldn't be embezzling ETH if he's not even in control of the multi stake. Like, somebody else is moving stuff around. You know, from Zack's side, he.
00:22:03.786 - 00:22:40.384, Speaker A: He sees a lot of other projects that, in his opinion, were kind of colorful or, you know, didn't work out. And on the one hand, you could say that was ICO days, and a lot of this shit was happening. It reminds me a bit of how the ethical standards change over time. Like, ten years ago, there were a bunch of words that we were saying every day, and now if you say them, you get canceled. I'm not going to give any examples, but even in poker, certain things were okay to do, and then they start becoming. You can't play at the same table with someone you know, because now it's. So these standards change.
00:22:40.384 - 00:22:53.056, Speaker A: I think this is a big win for everybody. We can move on, and hopefully Zach can keep doing his work and we can keep defending him when things go wrong.
00:22:53.240 - 00:23:18.178, Speaker D: Switching on to a different topic, if you guys are good with it. I think this topic has been on my mind for the past few weeks. I think crypto people don't like talking about burning out, mental health and whatnot. But I think it's something that we all deal with. It's just, like, something that we don't really admit to. But I think this panel is pretty interesting because I do content, I do research. Justin's a builder, dicky trades all the time, and then Jordy's a market maker.
00:23:18.178 - 00:23:51.160, Speaker D: And I think we all deal with just this general idea of burning out, just being tired, because not much is happening in markets. Prices are going down, up, whatever random meme coins are pumping. Do you have any, what steps do you guys take to not burnout? Right? Like, do you do something with, like, how. How do you separate a crypto life and, like, personal life? Because that's something I personally deal with and I'm trying to get better at. Like, how about let's get started like Dickey first? Like, how do you deal with just being engaged all the time?
00:23:51.312 - 00:24:43.050, Speaker C: Yeah. I think it's tough because, like, especially in crypto, like, you pretty much have to be pouring your entire life into what you're doing if you want to be competitive with everyone else, especially, I think, for trading. So, like, for me, like, I tend to get burned out when I put a bunch of effort in. I spend a bunch of time, I sacrifice a bunch of sleep, and the outcome isn't what I want it to be. It gets kind of demoralizing, I think, like, for me, sort of focusing on, like, the other parts of my life that I am grateful for really help. So for me, that might be spending time with my family or spending time with my girlfriend or spending time with, like, some of my friends that don't know anything about crypto and going outside and just, like, remembering, like, even if this all fails, like, life's still pretty good. It helps me, you know, get back on my feet and try again tomorrow.
00:24:43.202 - 00:25:03.422, Speaker D: Yeah, because, like, you know, when the curve situation was happening, everyone was panicking. But, you know, like, my girlfriend, like, my friends, like, they don't know a thing about Michael Igarov and his australian engines. Right. So, yeah, just, I think having non crypto friends is. Is really important. How about you, Justin? I think we talked about this a couple of times before. Like, how do you deal with, like, just being a builder in this space?
00:25:03.518 - 00:25:41.932, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I have a little different experience. So for me, 2022, when prices were actually going down, the whole year was a lot easier than 2023, seemed like there was more, you know, excitement and interest. In 2022, people were still, like, very engaged, whereas with 2023 this year, price has actually gone up. But I would say, like, interest has waned drastically. So, like, there's less exciting stuff happening. I mean, you can just look at our topics from the past four episodes, and, like, most of the things we talk about are pretty negative, right? So, like, there's, like, a ton of negative sentiment. There's a ton of bad things happening in the space.
00:25:41.932 - 00:26:03.640, Speaker B: And this is sort of like, the crypto is dead year, right? Last year was the year of, like, oh, my God, everything's going to zero. The real economy is going to zero. Crypto is going to zero. Everyone was freaking out, but there was a lot to talk about. People were still, like, excited about building projects, were still doing a little bit of fundraising at the start of last year, whereas this year. Right, like, there's no vc capital. Like, people that are.
00:26:03.640 - 00:26:32.418, Speaker B: Companies that are trying to raise are not able to, um, there's, like, very few new innovative things launching. And then everyone in the real world is just asks you, like, wait, you're still in crypto? Like, I thought crypto's dead. Like, what happened? Um, so, yeah, it's. It's tough. Uh, for me, I don't worry about too much about the price. I just hold ETH, which is nice, so I don't have to think too much about it. I was, like, fortunate enough to allocate quite a bit over late 2022 and early 2023.
00:26:32.418 - 00:26:51.868, Speaker B: Um, and now I'm just sort of holding it and waiting and not worrying too much about price. But I would say the vibes are definitely the. The toughest part is just that, um, you know, like, what are we doing here? Is there any there? There's like, what's crypto all about, and where is it going to be in the next few years? I think this is the year where all of that gets questioned, and that makes it tough.
00:26:52.036 - 00:27:13.932, Speaker D: Yeah, it kind of feels like, like a vibe session where prices are generally higher, but the vibes are, like, just down only. Yeah. Whenever I tell people, like, I'm in crypto, it's like, oh, like, but isn't AI hotter? Like, that's what all my friends tell me. And I'm like, no. Like, I still believe in yada, yada, yada. But trying to explain the value props of crypto, I think, is becoming harder and harder every month.
00:27:14.108 - 00:27:46.794, Speaker B: It was a crazy roller coaster for me because when I got in this space through, like, through mid 2022, you would say at a bar to someone that you're in crypto, and everyone would be excited and have a million questions. Now you're embarrassed to say it at the bar, right? Like, if someone's like, oh, what do you do? And you're like, I work now. It's like, I work in software SaaS company. So, yeah, it's tough. What about you, Jordy? Are you like, does this bother you at all? I mean, you seem like such a stoic figure to me that it doesn't get to you, but maybe I'm wrong.
00:27:47.894 - 00:28:33.896, Speaker A: I don't mind the market situation. It is a bit annoying having low volumes. As a market maker, you do see the ebbs and flows in the volume every day. And we've seen GSR, we've seen some of the headlines recently. We can look at some of the headlines that we've seen about some of the other market makers and how they're struggling. For me personally, I think there's so many lessons that we've learned from the last cycle, and I'm still digesting them. And it's so philosophically interesting to think like, what is crypto going to be? Where is it going to go from here? And I've gotten involved with mantle because I want to be a little bit on the builder, not on the builder side, but on the product side to understand, I don't want to just criticize and talk shit about Olympus or this guy and they're doing this wrong and Luna is the Ponzi and all this stuff.
00:28:33.896 - 00:29:30.612, Speaker A: I want to be able to say that, okay, I understand what it is to actually try to build a product for the masses to use like a crypto product that is useful for people that they can manage their financial lives with and doesn't rug them. So I'm extremely, I'm the busiest I've ever been and I've been very busy in the past. I don't even have a lot of time to do a lot of macro trading that I used to be my specialty. For years I've been a macro trader for crypto and even when I was in crypto during the bull market, I would still be trading macro. And now there's so much going on within the space, even though it looks dead, but behind the scenes there's a lot going on. I would say first on the market maker side, there's a push for market share. Right now you have Alameda the way, you have some of the big guys out the way, some of the firms are doing better.
00:29:30.612 - 00:30:17.184, Speaker A: Celini is doing really well. Thankfully, with Wintermute and GSR, everyone is trying to see if they're going to survive or not and the best will and the other ones might not. And yeah, on the l two side, being a part of the l two wars, we can talk about it in future episodes, but it is exciting to be a part of the l two wars. You know, you see the metrics of base and Bass is doing really well and it's exciting just, just to kind of have a foot in there. So, yeah, mentally, like in terms of struggle, not getting enough sleep is the only thing that, that kills me. So I try to somehow force the sleep in. That's, that's, that's the one thing Tldr.
00:30:17.224 - 00:30:24.394, Speaker C: Is that Jordy is, uh, doesn't burn out. Jordy goes hard, dude, Jordy goes hard.
00:30:25.294 - 00:30:27.838, Speaker D: He goes harder than our 20 something year olds.
00:30:28.006 - 00:30:37.398, Speaker C: Jordy's always awake. I like dm him like, like 04:00 a.m. His time. He replies instantly. Dm him like, you know, 07:00 a.m. His time, he replies instantly. He's just always awake.
00:30:37.566 - 00:30:39.054, Speaker D: Do you think, like, power naps, jordy?
00:30:39.094 - 00:31:04.564, Speaker A: Like, how do you know I can't take naps anymore. I think catch up a bit on the weekend. But, but, yeah, it's nonstop. I view this as a sacrifice of, you know, some years of my life and hopefully achieve, achieve a lot during this time. And, you know, I'll take it easy in my latter part of my life.
00:31:05.944 - 00:31:14.044, Speaker C: What's crazy is that your skin looks great. You know, like, you look. I don't understand. It doesn't look like you going to get 3 hours of sleep or 5 hours of sleep at night.
00:31:14.654 - 00:31:40.978, Speaker A: It's the mediterranean weather right now. We'll see if it lasts through the year. Yeah. Did you see, have you guys seen the market makers toefls? I mean, we've seen, you know, DWF we talked about last time. That was a great segment. I think we got some nice memes out of it. But the one interesting thing was winter mute is, you know, Evgeny, he's, he's a board member on the block.
00:31:40.978 - 00:31:50.814, Speaker A: And then the block starts, like, releasing these stories about GSR, which was interesting. I don't know if we can find some tweets there, but there was a little bit of drama.
00:31:51.434 - 00:32:04.770, Speaker D: Yeah, I didn't know Afghani was a board member. I guess. Yeah. I feel like the blogs lost some credibility. I think there was like, some drama around, like its former founder taking money or something. I forget the exact.
00:32:04.962 - 00:32:08.936, Speaker A: He took money from SPF, so it was the worst kind of money. Yeah.
00:32:09.120 - 00:32:16.600, Speaker B: It's so hard to blame him for that, though. I mean, you just don't know, right? Like, no one knew. You know, Congress didn't know that he was a scammer.
00:32:16.672 - 00:32:17.136, Speaker C: This is true.
00:32:17.160 - 00:32:26.768, Speaker A: But as a media organization, you're not supposed to buy, you know, houses with the money from someone that you're covering. It's, it's kind of like a rule number one.
00:32:26.816 - 00:32:29.164, Speaker B: So I did not realize that's what happened.
00:32:30.344 - 00:33:11.702, Speaker A: Extremely bad. To the credit of the block, the people who were not that guy, like the rest of them, were pretty incensed that this happened and, you know, immediately took a, took a side against, against him and then he resigned and all this stuff. But, yeah, like, now if you see, like, every story has at the bottom, it says, you know, disclosure, if Gany is on, is on the, is on, is on the board. This GSR story was quite negative. I don't know who read it. Like, for me, being in the space, it's a lot of popcorn. You know, you look at the stuff and it's like all the COO is leaving and the head of trading and the other head of trading and then the other head of trading and there's like being like eight heads of trading, you know.
00:33:11.702 - 00:33:37.480, Speaker A: Was it objective? I don't know. We saw the GSR founder saying that this is standard bull market, bear market stuff. And to be fair, we have seen it with a lot of exchanges. Like they hire 3000 people and then we go back to 1000 and they're on the shirts of Manchester City. And like every football team you can think of. And we still have the Formula one stuff, surprisingly, except for Mercedes, who had FTX. But the other ones, I think the.
00:33:37.512 - 00:34:07.684, Speaker D: Washington National Stadium, like the baseball team, they still have like Luna, like terror advertisements. Like they're like, why is that still up? But yeah, like lots of marketing spend going down the drain there. One quick question for Jordy. Like obviously, like GSR, maybe they're like allocating less time to market making. Like, what do you think the implications are for like the crypto markets? Are things gonna be like less liquid? Or do you think other market makers will like just plug in the holes and not much is gonna change?
00:34:07.844 - 00:34:29.704, Speaker A: You know, there's a lot we can talk about. The reality is a lot of these firms are not actually market makers. They're like from like GSR is not a real market maker. They don't actually trade. They're more of a investment bank. The background of it is East Goldman Sachs. And they, they are more of kind of trying to give some white glove services to institutions and foundations and stuff like that.
00:34:29.704 - 00:35:00.614, Speaker A: As opposed to from like Jomp who is like a legitimate trading firm. And they have the firepower, like they're one of the biggest in the world in quantitative trading, regardless of markets. So obviously, like they're legit. So you have two types of firms. You have the DWF GSR types, which they're more of BD. They're trying to do business development. They come and they're market making in the sense of they'll take your tokens and they'll try to put them on the book and not lose money.
00:35:00.614 - 00:35:19.560, Speaker A: And then you have real trading firms, like real market makers who actually provide liquidity. Like jump. Let's say tower is another big one. I don't think that the liquidity is suffering because of GSR. They don't matter at all. It's irrelevant. The firms that matter for that are, you know, large ones like tower.
00:35:19.560 - 00:35:59.286, Speaker A: If they have an issue, you'll see the difference. Maybe Jane street firm like that. It is interesting we coincide in the crypto community. I can sympathize with everybody else who's watching because you see these big market making firms and Evgeny talks about it. We'll look at it at the end. But it seems like this big boogeyman thing where they're these shadowy firms and they have their algorithms and what are they doing? And people think that they're just printing money and pumping and dumping stuff, and some of them, like we discussed last week, maybe are explicitly doing it. But there's a lot that are just trying to make some algorithm buy and sell without losing money.
00:35:59.470 - 00:36:22.130, Speaker B: So we saw before the GSR announcement or article came out, I think tons of altcoins just dumped like five or so percent. BTC and ETH were fairly flat at the time. There was. Then the GSR news came out, and then there was speculation on Twitter that this was GSR, like, exiting all of their positions. Is there any truth to that? Is it just a coincidence or what happened?
00:36:22.242 - 00:37:00.288, Speaker A: So I'm not sure. It doesn't look like a GSR thing, because the only things that they can dump are their venture book. It's not like they have tokens that they can dump otherwise because they're market making tokens. They have to, like, return them their loans. So unless they're dumping their venture book because they're in really bad shape, it looks more like a voyager kind of thing, where we have one of these bankruptcies and there's some OTC. So what happens is, like, all of the assets under Voyager get bundled together and people just get dollars back. So somebody has to take all the assets and dump them, turn them into dollars and give them back to people.
00:37:00.288 - 00:37:08.538, Speaker A: That's kind of what it looks like on the outside to me. But maybe by the time this thing comes out, will have learned it is GSR and they're bankrupt or something. But I don't think so.
00:37:08.666 - 00:37:17.454, Speaker C: That's not what I. Joey, as far as, you know, like, GSR doesn't run like a big sort of stat or relative value or alt book, do they?
00:37:17.794 - 00:37:27.214, Speaker A: No, definitely not. Zero chance. That is not something that they do. Yeah, the only ones that would do something like that are from, like, jane street.
00:37:27.634 - 00:37:42.732, Speaker C: Gotcha. I mean, it does kind of look like with your Voyager comment. Like, I thought that was plausible, but, like, EBTC has been doing pretty well. And, like, if I remember correctly, Voyager is, like, kind of overweight ETH. So if it were voyager, I'd expect ETH to sell off more than BTC.
00:37:42.868 - 00:37:57.244, Speaker A: There was some speculation, though, that people would, if you're in the position of liquidating a bunch of assets, you would start with the long tail and not even dump the BTC ETH because if you dump those as well, you'll just wreck the whole market. So you keep the majors last.
00:37:57.364 - 00:38:01.566, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. There was some speculation about that.
00:38:01.740 - 00:38:01.978, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:01.986 - 00:38:26.994, Speaker C: I don't know. I still think, like, we saw this interesting microavior in Robin Hood where, like, we saw the alts dump and then the majors dumped and then on that major stump, like, the alts, like, were actually moving up or they weren't moving at all. Like, it almost feels like maybe some stat arbor, like, hit inventory capacity and they're like, ah, we can't afford to, you know, move the alts down anymore, so we'll just let the majors dump and the alts don't do anything else. Like, we saw a little bit of that behavior last night, which is kind of interesting.
00:38:27.154 - 00:38:48.974, Speaker A: Yeah, we have to keep, keep an eye on this move. We've obviously had flat markets for a couple of weeks where literally nothing was happening. And unfortunately, the first move we got was down. So keeping an eye on it. I'm still pretty optimistic. Justin said, yeah, like, this year is a rough year, but, you know, 2024, we're going to have hopefully ETF and bitcoin halvening and, you know, we'll, we'll, we're going to make it. So.
00:38:50.674 - 00:38:51.242, Speaker C: Let'S see.
00:38:51.298 - 00:38:52.894, Speaker D: Wag me. Wag me. Yeah.
00:38:54.994 - 00:39:28.024, Speaker A: But, yeah, with that, let's go to our new segment. So obviously, we've been trying the dj of the week, and I'm bullish on this week. We've been trying different things. And this week we have a fun one for you guys. It's pasta of the week. So hopefully we have some nice graphics up there. And in line with the crypto Twitter lore, we will be reading some amazing tweets and hopefully in the future we can copy pasta them without people knowing what we're referring to.
00:39:28.024 - 00:39:28.884, Speaker A: And.
00:39:30.644 - 00:39:31.548, Speaker D: We'Re going to do this first.
00:39:31.596 - 00:39:31.820, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:31.852 - 00:39:48.860, Speaker D: So let me to give some background. I think if you've been using on chain, like defi and like, l two s in general, like zksync, all these l two s with little, like actual value, people are like just airdrop farming and whatnot. It's been full of rugs.
00:39:48.892 - 00:39:49.036, Speaker A: Right?
00:39:49.060 - 00:40:07.504, Speaker D: Like developers is like fork, like pancakeswap and like Aave and like this rugged assets. And then this is on the 14th. This. This Dex on the base chain was like, okay. Like, the team is, you know, we shut down the form to prevent further damage. We lost some assets, but the Dex. The Dex itself is not affected in any way.
00:40:07.504 - 00:40:24.136, Speaker D: Don't worry. We are very sorry for a loss. And I love, like, the very last line, like, we are very sorry for a loss. It kind of sounds like someone died, right? Like, we're, like, very sorry for a loss. And then, you know, like, the devs are like, you know what? Like, it doesn't really matter. And I'm sure, like, the tokens, like, nuking. I'm not even sure if they have a token.
00:40:24.136 - 00:40:41.324, Speaker D: But I just feel like I see this pasta every single week. Like, some random l two Dex just, like, rugging, and then, like, blaming some complicated thing that, who knows? Like, maybe it's like, an inside job. So this is, like, my pasta week. Like, l two dexs, just, like, constantly rugging its users.
00:40:42.504 - 00:40:43.384, Speaker C: I like that.
00:40:43.504 - 00:40:44.560, Speaker B: Since I don't have a post this.
00:40:44.592 - 00:40:57.654, Speaker C: Week, I'm going to be the judge of these. I'm going to give this one a seven out of ten. I really like the last one. I like last one because it's like, it's very much just, like, we're not gonna pay back. You know, that's essentially what it says. It's hardness.
00:40:58.994 - 00:40:59.282, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:59.298 - 00:41:02.426, Speaker D: It's transferring the blame to someone else.
00:41:02.570 - 00:41:04.962, Speaker B: Mistakes were made with the wallet I controlled.
00:41:05.058 - 00:41:05.934, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:41:06.394 - 00:41:35.524, Speaker A: You know, I was a bit lazy this week, so I don't have a pasta, unfortunately. But, you know, Alex, I did want to tell you something else. So I think you need to stop blaming others for your degeneracy, because you're such degenerate. You know, you need to understand what real market makers are doing for a living. And, dude, like, just get control of your life for change, okay? Or if you're going to be a docile person, I don't care, because we make money off docile people. So unfortunately, I don't have a pasta. But I just wanted to give you my thoughts.
00:41:35.524 - 00:41:36.384, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:41:37.604 - 00:41:38.932, Speaker C: I needed that. Thanks, Jody.
00:41:38.988 - 00:41:53.774, Speaker A: So, yeah, this. This beautiful tweet here, I will be using this. Thank you, Evgeny. This will go into my copy pasta pocket for future use. I think it's epic. I encourage everybody to read this thread.
00:41:54.114 - 00:42:14.070, Speaker B: Yeah, this was super funny because Evgeny is such a composed person. In my experience, winter mute invested in Astaria, and I've spoken to him once or twice and also just followed along his twitter, and he's normally just extremely even keel flat, very composed. And then this thread is just hilarious. It's absolutely a must read.
00:42:14.182 - 00:42:37.942, Speaker A: Yeah, I think what happened is Kasaka, you know, went after him for trying to borrow rent free, like interest rate free from, from yearn. I think they want to borrow 2 million worth of urine and not pay anything. So he got some pushback and, you know, this was his threat to, to battle. He said he woke up and chose violence. So it was entertaining.
00:42:38.038 - 00:43:11.012, Speaker C: There was like a background before, like Osaka was. I think he was just kind of clowning that like optimism couldn't pump because Wintermute was one of the lead market makers on it. So it's kind of just implying that like, oh, yeah, these guys will just sell any rip. And I think for the people that like, understand how things work, like, it's obviously a joke, but like, for a lot of people that don't because obviously sock has like a huge following, they're like, oh, wow, you know, if winter music market making like, we shouldn't buy this coin because it can't rip. And I think it does affect their business of, you know, being the lead market maker and getting these token deals is like, oh, people think that would mean you're going to sell the rips. Then, like, why would we use them?
00:43:11.148 - 00:43:17.892, Speaker B: I'll just put it out there. Wintermute. The coins that they've market made have done phenomenal. It seemingly initially at launch for the.
00:43:17.908 - 00:43:26.904, Speaker A: First few weeks, like Evgeny said, they are not able to pump or dump stuff. It is, it is the market that chooses. So how about you, Justin?
00:43:27.484 - 00:43:49.698, Speaker B: Yeah, so I had to do a quick pivot on the, on the show because we used my tweet earlier for the shabarium segment. But we've seen a lot of segments on Twitter about nfts being completely worthless and dead. There's certainly some truth to that. So this tweet I thought was hilarious. Narrator. All the NFTs ended up being worthless. And then if you're listening, I'll try to explain.
00:43:49.698 - 00:44:22.958, Speaker B: There's basically just an order of how bad NFT projects are down relative to ETH. So this is not in us dollar terms. We have at the top art gobblers, which was a paradigm prior project to, I believe, down 99.34% against ETH, which is amazing, all the way down to milady, which is only down about 16% against ETH. So it's been a wild ride in the NFT space. It seemed like NFTs were sort of like immune from the 2022 crash. And now in 2023, they're really feeling the pain now.
00:44:22.958 - 00:44:38.316, Speaker B: So we'll see. But, like, the narrative right now on Twitter is that the NFT market, specifically the PFP market, is all headed to zero. And we're seeing that with apes. Punks are doing okay and whatnot, so, yeah, pretty crazy times out there.
00:44:38.380 - 00:45:03.534, Speaker C: Justin, I want to get your thoughts on this because you're, like, you know, the expert on nfts. Like, I. Why do you think this has happened? Why have nfts been down only? My pet theory is that, like, the incentive structure for these projects is just very front loaded, so there's no incentive to stay around. But I'm curious if you have any thoughts on why the charts look like this, why there hasn't been a single project that's maintained or added value in this market.
00:45:03.954 - 00:45:32.900, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think Kobe sort of said it best. I don't know if you guys heard. I think he said it on up only, or maybe it was just a Twitter thread that he was talking about nfts in the state that they were at at the time that he said nfts are just altcoins with pictures. And I think that's very much true for where the market is today. Uh, which is, like, to, like, I agree. It's not that exciting. Right? Like, a lot of these projects simply have nothing going for them except for that there's, like, a picture attached to the coin.
00:45:32.900 - 00:46:24.604, Speaker B: And so I think they're. We're seeing, like, a repricing of what that actually means and what it's worth. I do think, like, crypto punks are here to stay and they'll be around and they'll have value. I think it's possible bored apes have value in the future, but, like, 99% of these projects, just like, 99% of meme coins, I think, will head to zero. And personally, like, what I'm excited about and what I think will pull us out of this is just, like, innovations in the ERC 721 space, which is what an NFT is beyond art. And so I think more and more financial positions will be represented by nfts just because, like, what we saw with uniswap v three, right? Like, it doesn't make sense to have all financial products be fungible and have, like, users compete in a fungible way. It actually makes sense for them to be non fungible where everyone can have, like, a unique financial position and compete in the market.
00:46:24.604 - 00:46:53.600, Speaker B: And so I think NFts as a class are just getting started. But I do think, like, the PFP art space is going to just be like, a very small segment of that going forward. That's my hunch. That's probably, like, a middle curve take. I think, like, the low IQ take and the high IQ take of, like, pictures are good might hold, right? So I think nFTs are not dead. We're certainly going to see a resurgence, but we'll see how it all plays out. What do you think, tyke? I know you're pretty into that, not.
00:46:53.600 - 00:47:02.536, Speaker B: Not into nfts, but you're very much on chain and following along. So, like, what do you think? Are these nfts pfps dead? Is. Are they going to have a resurgence?
00:47:02.680 - 00:47:30.914, Speaker D: Yeah, I feel like nfts pump after, like, the majors pump. So, like, when people feel wealthier, maybe they want to show off their wealth, like, by buying board apes and stuff. I am super excited. I feel like Defi and nfts should converge at some point. We started to see this with Univ three. There's a new stablecoin project called Dyad, which represents eve collateral as nfts. And I know you bought those nfts from Dyad.
00:47:30.914 - 00:47:46.326, Speaker D: I'm excited to see that part do well, but when it comes to pfps, I think they're still going to slowly bleed. I'm like, I've been short for deeps on these perp platforms for the last couple of months.
00:47:46.470 - 00:47:46.766, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:47:46.790 - 00:47:50.238, Speaker B: Remember that in episode one? That was your d gen play in episode one, right?
00:47:50.286 - 00:47:58.934, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm still keeping that. I'm just collecting the funding. I'm shorting board apes. I don't really see bored apes pumping anytime soon, so you can just short it.
00:47:59.014 - 00:48:13.214, Speaker A: What do you guys think about d gods? I'm not super deep into this stuff, but I was seeing a lot of discussion around, you know, this downgrade they did, and then the price doesn't seem to be doing very well. Justin, have you been. Is that another down only, or.
00:48:13.994 - 00:48:33.164, Speaker B: Yeah, I was. I mean, I would think it's just sort of follows the trend of the rest of the space is like, you know, these things all might have, like, pumps along the way of going down, but I think only a few of these, like, larger PFP projects will make it so I haven't followed that too closely. Was it machi that bought a ton of them from the blur bidding pool?
00:48:33.324 - 00:48:38.964, Speaker D: Yeah, I think he was airdrop farming, and I think he owns, like, one of every ten d gods or something.
00:48:39.004 - 00:48:39.132, Speaker C: Or.
00:48:39.148 - 00:48:52.544, Speaker D: I mean, I can't confirm, but I think I saw that. Like, he's just setting bits and people are just dumping into his bids and, like, you know, he's gonna sell at some point, right? So he's gonna take a, take a loss and. Yeah, it's kind of like this blurb spiral.
00:48:53.404 - 00:48:59.384, Speaker B: That man has a crazy risk appetite to just be like the floor buyer of apes. And now to gods.
00:48:59.424 - 00:48:59.688, Speaker C: It's.
00:48:59.736 - 00:49:04.608, Speaker B: It's nuts. I couldn't imagine doing that. But, uh, he's got conviction, right?
00:49:04.696 - 00:49:04.944, Speaker A: So.
00:49:04.984 - 00:49:06.528, Speaker B: Or at least he thinks he can trade.
00:49:06.656 - 00:49:09.208, Speaker A: He likes the tokens. What can we say?
00:49:09.376 - 00:49:10.824, Speaker B: Altcoins with pictures.
00:49:10.984 - 00:49:15.984, Speaker A: Chef Thickey, who, which pasta of the week do you want to try?
00:49:16.104 - 00:49:47.824, Speaker C: I'll pick. I'll pick. Jordy's just because of personal and like, yeah, that Anthony we was, I found on them later that week. I guess amongst, like, our circles, we know that, like, you know, when winner meets market making or when market makers have a large supply of token, in general, it's pretty much just down only. So it's just like, yeah, there's definitely not a pump aspect, just dump. But, yeah, I think I'm going to start calling people docile and not serious people from now on, too, after this.
00:49:48.164 - 00:49:50.784, Speaker D: Lots of new pastas to be consumed from now on.
00:49:51.944 - 00:50:03.272, Speaker A: Let us know what you guys think of the new segment or which one of our closing segments you like the most. So we can, we can do those ones more often. And. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for joining and see you next week.
00:50:03.328 - 00:50:04.084, Speaker B: Bye, everyone.
