00:00:20.840 - 00:00:39.724, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody, to another episode of Steady Lads. We have an exciting one today. We broke out of the range, the boring trading range that we had. You can see the chart here. But unfortunately, it was to the downside. So we've had a little bit of a breakdown. And, you know, we have top crew for analysis here today.
00:00:39.724 - 00:00:42.440, Speaker A: You know, I have my quantitative here.
00:00:42.512 - 00:00:43.584, Speaker B: My quantitative.
00:00:43.744 - 00:00:44.904, Speaker A: My math specialist.
00:00:44.944 - 00:00:46.192, Speaker C: Look at him, thicky.
00:00:46.288 - 00:00:47.360, Speaker A: You can look at his face.
00:00:47.472 - 00:00:48.344, Speaker C: Look at his face.
00:00:48.464 - 00:01:02.620, Speaker A: Look at. Look at his eyes. Look at his eyes very carefully. This guy got first in a bybit trading competition. Okay, so Thiki, give us the lowdown. What are you seeing here?
00:01:02.692 - 00:01:08.304, Speaker D: Yeah, well, my actual name is Alex not thicky, and I placed fifth in that private trading competition.
00:01:08.644 - 00:01:15.244, Speaker A: So you verified that you're still at Sumitar Capital. You managed to not get fired. It seemed for a second that you were being let go.
00:01:15.364 - 00:01:23.184, Speaker D: Yeah, it was rough start to the month, but I had to beg my boss for my job back. And luckily able to make it all back and more.
00:01:23.844 - 00:01:24.316, Speaker B: Wow.
00:01:24.380 - 00:01:24.700, Speaker D: Okay.
00:01:24.732 - 00:01:33.784, Speaker A: I mean, in such a beer market, I think the viewers would be quite interested. Like, how are you finding alpha? How are you doing so well in the bear market? How are you coping?
00:01:36.204 - 00:02:10.020, Speaker D: There are, like, two big wins that I think were, like, kind of anomalous in the volatility event. The first one was when. So the XRP inverse contract. So, basically, like, when you trade perpetuals, you can either deposit staples and then trade perpetuals, or you can deposit spots and perpetuals, and they traded different markets, and they usually trade very in line. So when the market crashed, one of them actually dislocated by around 33%, which is kind of insane. It's like someone got blown out, and it was stuck there for, like, 2030 minutes. So, yeah, definitely the biggest win this week was just manually going in, fixing that arbitrage.
00:02:10.020 - 00:02:13.588, Speaker D: I think I made, like, 200 from that dislocation.
00:02:13.756 - 00:02:31.374, Speaker A: Nice. It's pretty chunky. I know that bybit has unified trading accounts, but I saw that they separated out the perpetuals for coin margin. Those are not in the unified. So if somebody has a bunch of unified money, they still can't trade those different perpetuals. You need that coin.
00:02:31.994 - 00:02:32.466, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:02:32.490 - 00:02:48.814, Speaker D: Yeah. And I think that's the reason why it persisted for so long, because, like, no one. I don't know, most people just don't trade inverse perpetuals. Like, for me, it took me, like, five minutes to figure out how to transfer the money to the account and what I needed to go buy spot and then transfer it, and then, like, buy the contract with spot, it was really confusing.
00:02:49.774 - 00:03:08.594, Speaker A: Yeah. It's awesome that those kind of inefficiencies still exist. Those trading formats, these kind of inverse, I think it's a lot of old school traders that like these because these were like the Bitmax style back then, back in the day. So that's awesome. Okay. So you made a chunk there and where else did you find alpha?
00:03:08.894 - 00:03:28.258, Speaker D: So the rest was just, you know that mega candle, it like when the BTC went down at 24 two, it just like stuck there for like 10 seconds. And in my mind I was just like, you know, it feels terrible to bid here but like I just, I just have to bid. So I think I put like maybe 95% of the firm's capital.
00:03:28.426 - 00:03:32.694, Speaker A: I didn't know that the, the junior bus boy gets such a capital allocation.
00:03:33.954 - 00:03:37.114, Speaker B: So you just perfectly long the bottom is what you're telling us.
00:03:37.154 - 00:03:38.834, Speaker D: I literally bottom ticked it. Yeah.
00:03:38.994 - 00:03:39.734, Speaker B: Wow.
00:03:41.094 - 00:03:43.710, Speaker D: And that was like another like 150.
00:03:43.822 - 00:03:59.354, Speaker B: I think just for everyone listening. We have a telegram, group chat and Thickie could have told us to buy at this point but we didn't get a message from him. We didn't hear anything from the guy all day. So we're just all running around like headless chickens. And I guess thiky's just trading this perfectly.
00:04:00.574 - 00:04:06.354, Speaker D: I mean definitely go, super luck. And I think, I think the rest, maybe like 35% of the rest is just from shorting alts.
00:04:07.034 - 00:04:19.674, Speaker A: And you said like you know, 10 seconds was, was the BTC time window which maybe explains why you didn't let us know. But does that mean you just kind of like need to be in front of the screen 24 hours to catch those like ten second opportunities?
00:04:19.834 - 00:04:39.966, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, exactly. I said it. I set the chart. So usually people have like 1 minute charts but I set my charts to like ticks. So like every 100 trades it makes a new candle. And what happened is like it obviously went down and then like someone had, I guess someone had a huge bid on purpose at around 24 two. It just kept like you know ping ponging in that range for like 10 seconds.
00:04:39.966 - 00:04:42.478, Speaker D: And I guess like I just figured that was the time.
00:04:42.646 - 00:04:53.062, Speaker A: Nice. Well, well played. It's nice to see you guys up on that leaderboard. Maybe the offer from DWF will not get accepted today.
00:04:53.238 - 00:04:54.394, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
00:04:54.814 - 00:05:31.248, Speaker C: Yeah. I have one question, Dicky. Like would you say that like most of your trading wins is around all these inefficiencies where first it's like DexRP, like someone got blown out and then in the case of PTC obviously someone was like, I mean, maybe if someone blew up, maybe someone just like worth like four sellers and you noticed that there's a bid around 24 two and you're like, okay, like maybe this is like a good demand zone for me to step in. Like if our audience, right, for example, can only watch the daily chart, a weekly chart, how do you think that they can, I guess, extract value in these markets? Or do you think that's way too hard?
00:05:31.416 - 00:05:45.964, Speaker D: I think this is more like a one off. Definitely the majority of my PNL this year is just coming from doing deep research and putting on a position. It's usually not something, a frantic inefficiency. This is definitely a rare one off occurrence for us.
00:05:46.304 - 00:05:59.694, Speaker A: I know you guys were building during the bull market, you weren't trading, so maybe you were trading on the side. But how different is it now in the bear versus the bull? Did you see that there were a lot more opportunities back then or what are you experiencing?
00:05:59.854 - 00:06:45.334, Speaker D: I think the meta definitely has changed. I think if you look at the altcoin, the total three charge has been down only, and the only correct meta right now is just the short alts because there's just so much supply coming in the market, there's not enough demand to buy these new altcoins. There's still 7500 billion dollars of altcoins supply that have, you know, are still locked and they're still going to hit the market and it's definitely going to affect, you know, trading circulating prices. Um, so yeah, I think that's just been the theme of this year. And like you really can't make that much shorting. It's not like you can't hit a home run every time you shorten alt because like your upside's limited, unlike when you long and alt. But um, I guess if you just keep, keep doing it and like it builds up eventually is the kind of takeaway from this year.
00:06:45.984 - 00:07:44.874, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely look at shorts quite a bit myself. I've written some threads about it because it's a very dangerous thing to do. And I don't recommend most novice traders to try to do any shorting, especially right now. So the meta, as we've seen and GCR talked about this, but we're seeing that some of the manipulative market makers or trading firms have been using short squeezes and using the funding rate to milk people who get stuck in shorts and just keep getting the funding rate at max negative 2% per window and just milking it by manipulating the spot price. So we're hoping to get crypto cred next week as a guest to discuss this. He wrote an epic tweet describing some of these dynamics, the traders out there, all the trading curious. Next week, we should have a banger segment for you guys that we're looking forward to.
00:07:44.874 - 00:07:58.566, Speaker A: But let me go to Justin. So, Justin, you're less on the trading side. You're more in the fundamentals. You're in the weeds. You're building. You're doing the actual crypto, not the coin crypto, the real stuff.
00:07:58.590 - 00:08:02.262, Speaker B: I'm not just extracting value, I'm trying to make value.
00:08:02.438 - 00:08:21.218, Speaker A: Obviously, bear markets are tough for making value as well. I know CZ talks about build, build, build, you know, the bear markets for building. But I find that personally, a little bit too optimistic. Let's say it's not. It's not that simple. Like, how are you feeling? How are you experiencing it?
00:08:21.386 - 00:08:44.764, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's. It's really tough. Right. So the way we've been talking about it, and I've been explaining it, is the pie is certainly not growing right now. It's probably shrinking. I think users are probably still leaving the web3 space or at the very best, it's just sort of about flat. And so everyone is competing for the same amount of capital or lower, you know, less and less capital each week and fewer users.
00:08:44.764 - 00:08:58.604, Speaker B: Right. And so it makes it extremely competitive. And I think, like, that leads to some toxicity that you see on Twitter. Right. Like, everyone is much more tribal. I'm not just talking about people working on projects or building, but really investing too. Right.
00:08:58.604 - 00:09:35.252, Speaker B: Like, you're seeing communities, like, much more antagonistic, I think, than in the bull market. Everyone is sort of feeling very defensive. Everyone feels like they're backed in a corner a little bit, and I think it makes it tough. I think we're going to talk about this a little more as well. I know you're doing some fundraising now, but fortunately we raised before the bear market started, so it wasn't an issue for us. But I know a ton of teams that, very talented people that would have easily been funded one to two years ago at pretty decent, you know, valuations, even pre product. And now that's just not possible.
00:09:35.252 - 00:09:37.036, Speaker B: So what do they do?
00:09:37.100 - 00:09:47.584, Speaker A: Do they just, like, self fund and try to get to some working product themselves, or do they just end up taking jobs like normal jobs or what do those people end up doing?
00:09:48.364 - 00:10:35.598, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so usually, I mean, we've seen so many projects shut down. I feel like over the last year, that seems to be very common. You know, I think crypto people are a little different in that, like a lot of the people building this space are like financially well off, presumably from like being somewhat early in crypto that it's not like a huge financial concern for them. But I know a lot of people that are either trying to sort of do like get hired or get hired by another project or have their project, you know, sort of be bought out with equity because no one's like buying projects out with cash. Now, I think the last big one we saw there was when Uniswap bought Genie, right? I think it was like at some hundred million dollar valuation. And the Uniswap NFT integration has not done well. They're seeing like low single digit trades on Uniswap NFt per day.
00:10:35.598 - 00:11:02.928, Speaker B: So I think, like large m and a activity is basically non existent. It just doesn't make much sense right now. And so I think we're seeing a lot of projects shut down, a lot of smart people joining other teams. I can tell you it's much easier to hire now. So we see like tons of great candidates come up, especially in the smart contract space. So smart contract engineers are, are out there, which is awesome. But, you know, we're just seeing what you'd expect to see, like more competition.
00:11:02.928 - 00:11:19.574, Speaker B: It's harder to get the word out about your product. You know, I think everyone in this space looks at Frontech, which I know we're going to talk about a little bit and we're all wondering, like, how do you catch that lightning in a bottle? What makes Frontech succeed? And everything else is just like, you know, meh.
00:11:20.274 - 00:12:06.748, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, as a builder, you know, you're fighting so hard to get 1000 users or something. I mean, I know some of the top dexs, even though we talk about them a lot, like the GMXs and all these things, you look at how many daily active users they have and, you know, it's usually like in the hundreds. It's not, it's not millions of people. But how do you feel when you see a success, let's not call it a success story because, you know, it's very early, but something like Friendtech, you know, or step in a couple years ago, you know, one of these apps comes out and seems to just catch lightning in a bottle. They don't have a fully functioning product, they haven't fully figured everything out, but it just seems like they get enough of the formula right. Do you feel like you want to learn from it? Do you feel like angry because, like, oh, this shitty stuff is working, but, like, my cool thing isn't working.
00:12:06.748 - 00:12:09.584, Speaker A: Like, what's the reaction that you have seeing that?
00:12:10.054 - 00:12:47.820, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's tough, right? I mean, I use Friendtech. It's really fun, it's exciting, and I'm really encouraged by what they did because there's a ton of innovations we can talk about that, in my opinion, are really smart, but it's certainly tough. There is this non tangible flywheel that gets kicked off with a new project where people are using frontech to make money and people are using it because everyone's using it and because everyone's using it, you can make money. And that flywheel could kick off with so many other different projects. Right. But it doesn't. And I'm trying to spend a lot of time thinking about why Friendtech succeeded.
00:12:47.820 - 00:13:02.300, Speaker B: I think being on a new chain is like, super helpful. So launching when a new chain launches makes a ton of sense because capital is going there anyway and they want to find something to do. But, yeah, it's definitely a little tough to see, but it's also inspiring at the same time.
00:13:02.452 - 00:13:24.186, Speaker A: I mean, there is no airdrop, though, on base, even though it is a new chain. So from that aspect, it's quite interesting. But it's not like we saw with GMX and Arbitrum back then. I know, Taiki, you've already done early on. You were earliest to do a deep dive into friendtech. I think it's been a couple of weeks already now. I know you've had more time to digest and experience it.
00:13:24.186 - 00:13:28.934, Speaker A: Have you been a user? Have you been an active user? How are you finding friendtech right now?
00:13:29.634 - 00:14:20.436, Speaker C: Yeah, I was, I guess, pretty early on. And I first signed up and I bought shares of, like, other crypto, Twitter influencers and some of those shares have appreciated. But I think now, given the fees are so high, so like, there's a 10% fee, 5% goes to the marketplace, 5% goes to the creator key. And Justin, if you can pull up the dune dashboard, given the fees are so high, I think, you know, the system currently relies on new money coming in to the application because otherwise, you know, as people sell, as people extract value, you know, 10% leaves the ecosystem. It's kind of like the similar problem with NFT royalties. And if you look at the right hand side here with the friend deck protocol inflow, we had a huge boost a couple of days ago or like a week ago with paradigm announcing its investment and people getting airdrop points. But now we're back to the pre hype phase.
00:14:20.436 - 00:15:06.404, Speaker C: So if this can't pick up, then I think that the average key, the value of it is going to just trend down. But we do know that every Friday people get airdrop points and new referral codes. So perhaps every Friday and every weekend we're going to see a spike up in user activity. And the airdrop, the fronttech airdrop, has to happen soon because if it's going to take six months, I think the hype is going to die down. But maybe if they can do it in October, November, maybe the hype can continue. The one promising thing that I've seen is that it's actually onboarding, like, people from other industries and not like, just crypto natives. We saw an NVA athlete, Grayson Allen join.
00:15:06.404 - 00:15:19.752, Speaker C: We were seeing a bunch of Onlyfans girls join, which, I mean, I think it's fine. And there's other gamers, too. So if it can attract people from different industries and they're spreading it to their audience, then that can grow.
00:15:19.848 - 00:15:55.750, Speaker A: I mean, it's definitely showing like a product market fit. Right. There is proof that people are at least interested in the idea of, yeah, you called it keys now, which, you know, it seems like you've already adapted from shares to keys. I know it used to be called shares and they very cleverly, like, changed it. So it's not looking like an investment product. So, you know, you have keys of people and people do want to check it out. We've seen like a burst and this double top potentially of activity.
00:15:55.750 - 00:16:25.724, Speaker A: The question is probably going to be, are people going to get enough value out of it as a creator? Like, are you able to give people enough that they'll keep wanting to use this app? Or is this just because we had a Black Mirror episode a couple of years ago talking about this concept and now we're seeing it in action. People want to just try it and see if black mirror is, is in reality. I mean, you're a content creator, Taiki, are you feeling like people are going to be able to provide value to key holders?
00:16:26.464 - 00:17:09.640, Speaker C: It's pretty hard because most of the value that creators get, it's upfront. And I feel like one thing that I've noticed is that I've seen some other content creators, if you buy a key, they give you access to a discord because the chat feature is basically broken. They're trying to get people on the telegrams and discords, but the problem is if someone sells a key, then they're still in the discord. So it's not perfect there. So until they fix the chat feature to allow for photos, videos, I don't really think that this can sustain. But I think the reason people are super excited is because it's one of those things that it makes people feel like they're super early into something, right? It gives people hopium, basically. And I think crypto needs hopium, especially in this type of market.
00:17:09.640 - 00:17:23.716, Speaker C: And this hope that, okay, like maybe if I buy shares of Dickey, right? He's at 0.3. Okay. He's going to be number one in the by bit leaderboards at some point, you know, he's gonna be worth so much more because he's gonna share some thicky picky alpha.
00:17:23.820 - 00:17:53.486, Speaker A: I mean, is that the case? Like people are gonna share Alpha? I mean, it would be cooler if they could share some revenue stream, right? Like if you could get your Twitter. Some people are getting paid from Twitter every, every month or something, right? You get some payment. If you sign up for that, potentially you could plug that in and it creates even more of a financial product. And I don't know, like, Vicki, do you see something like fintech from a trader perspective, as an opportunity where you can make money trading?
00:17:53.670 - 00:18:27.560, Speaker D: I think that's what something Al mentioned. So I guess the one way you could pass back revenues is like whatever revenue you generate, either from the fees or from whatever you do normally, you just use it to buy back shares and it kind of distributes as a share dividend. The only issue is like, it only makes sense if you can actually, let's say people invest in you. It only makes sense if you can sell your shares and use that capital to fund your business. There's a lot of value capture from the protocol from that. It is kind of expensive and people don't like having the share owner, like the guy, sell your own shares. It's just kind of a bad look.
00:18:27.560 - 00:18:30.368, Speaker D: So that part needs to be streamlined. I think.
00:18:30.536 - 00:19:20.590, Speaker B: I think your assumption that they have product market fit, I mean, they certainly have it in the short term as some speculative product market fit. But I think assuming they have sustainable product market fit, it's very much too early to tell. I mean, you can see here, if you're looking at the leaderboard here, you can see this is all P and L. People are all just interested in speculating and trading on these tokens. These are just meme coins attached to a name. And that's really all the utility is right now. I don't think this sort of like private chat room provides any real value at the moment, I think they could build something, but I think if they want to achieve sustainable product market fit, they basically have to rework the entire model of how creators are getting paid and how people are paying them.
00:19:20.590 - 00:20:13.158, Speaker B: Right? So, like, it doesn't make sense that you, the creator, makes no money. Like Taiki was saying, when someone just holds their key and sits in their room, right, like, you need to be providing continuous value and then you need to be like, continually extracting value. I know that sounds negative, right? But, like, if you have users that want to pay for your content, they should be paying continuously as opposed to just, you know, building a bot that buys their share the second they sign up, just holding that and then trying to, you know, dump those keys on a grid or fool. So I think some real changes need to be made. There's also a lot we can talk about about the bonding curve that decides the pricing for the key. It's extremely steep. So that, like, you basically cap out access at, you know, under 200 people, which makes it very hard to have a compelling case that, like, if I'm making thousands of dollars on Twitter via Twitter ads, that I'm willing to share that revenue when I'm really not making that much money off friendtech.
00:20:13.158 - 00:20:47.988, Speaker B: I know we've seen Kobe and others make a few hundred thousand dollars, but I don't think that's going to be the base case for, like, any of us, right? If any of us opened up an account or we do. Some of us do. So I don't think there's sustainable product market fit yet, but I do think Frontec has done some really exciting stuff and they could get there. But I also question, like Tyche, your point about the airdrop. I don't know if the airdrop will make a difference. I mean, there's this really interesting tweet here from altcoin psycho about if airdrops are pointless or not. And in some ways, I think that's kind of true.
00:20:47.988 - 00:21:02.164, Speaker B: Right? Like, the second friend tech drops this coin, most people are just going to dump it. Who's going to hold this? Why are people going to buy it? How does it add value to the system as opposed to just creating another hype cycle in another bubble? So that's my little rant there.
00:21:02.704 - 00:21:37.284, Speaker A: Yes, psycho has had some spicy takes this week and that was one of them. The airdrops are useless. And we've seen projects get sibled for airdrops with bots that are obviously just trying to make money and sell them. And I don't know if they're useless. They potentially get attention. And that's one thing that if you've been in the space for a long time and you've talked to exchanges and other protocols, you've probably figured out that influencers are very important for crypto. When you have a product, when you have an exchange.
00:21:37.284 - 00:22:37.950, Speaker A: Some of the biggest exchanges, like bybit and some of these ones, they got literally made by some specific influencers, right? Like there's this korean guy that, like, goes on stream and gambles like a ton of money and falls asleep and wakes up liquidated. But then, like, you know, he gets like a ton of traders to, to sign up and follow him. And, you know, in essence, maybe what we're seeing with friendtech is, you know, maybe to support your point, Justin, that it's not necessarily a deep product market fit, but what we're seeing is they managed to get the influencers incentivized because they've literally given them a very easy way to make. If I signed up tomorrow, I'm sure I would make, let's say, ten ETH or something. It wouldn't be that hard to just have some bots buy and sell your shares and make some fees on that. And they're in essence being very successful at buying the attention and getting people to tweet about them. We've seen so many of the big crypto influencers tweet about them.
00:22:37.950 - 00:23:05.506, Speaker A: And if you put a dollar value on, if you had tried to hire all those people and, like, you know, pay them to show your product, it probably would be worth, you know, millions of dollars to get all those people to tweet about you. And, yeah, they've made 10 million in fees or whatever they've made. So is this, I mean, I'll think you, like, do you, do you think this is just a matter of getting the influencers incentivized and buying that attention share, or is it? Or is it something more?
00:23:05.650 - 00:24:01.084, Speaker D: Yeah, I think there's some sort of Ponzi nomical aspect to it. If, like, as long as you're bringing in new money and attention keeps growing, then, like, it, even if the mechanism is flawed, like, it can still succeed. I think what racer did with, so they had that first mini cycle and then, like, everything retraced and then he, like, reinvested all the protocol fees and basically just gave everyone an airdrop, like all shareholders pretty much. They doubled all their value when racer re injected the ETH into everyone's shares. So I think, like, as long as he keeps doing that and it's kind of random, and people just never know when that's going to come. Like, you know, if you couple that with more attention going in, stories of just people making fifty k, one hundred k just for being on an app, I think it can hit a flywheel and keep growing as long as the bots don't extract too much value at the beginning. Because, like, those MEV snipers are really extracting a lot of, sucking a lot of, you know, money out of the system and ruining the wealth effect.
00:24:01.394 - 00:24:54.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's something that I've personally said that as, as long as these bots are going wild and I don't have a way around them, I'm not gonna sign up because it's in, it's in essence, you know, a bot comes in, buys 2030 shares, and then as soon as somebody wants to actually follow you, they, they're just gonna get dumped on and their share price is gonna go down by, you know, 30, 40% or something. So that's a UI problem. Justin mentioned some of the other UI problems. The bonding curve, a huge issue with it Taiki has talked about as a content creator. Apart from upfront value, how do you do much? They're gonna have to expand the capability of the app. Even though it's janky enough, people seem to be complaining about the server and the lag time. I know the OnlyFans girls are gonna want to have some videos or some images at least.
00:24:54.394 - 00:25:18.530, Speaker A: You know, I understand from the product side, like, Justin, you're on the product side. Like, if you were making this product, I understand why they went so safe at the beginning. Like, it's text only. They obviously need to take some risks. They can't just make it very vanilla like it is now, where you can't share images. Only fans, people, you know, they want videos, potentially, but then you start becoming like an x rated interface, potentially. That can have legal liabilities.
00:25:18.530 - 00:25:29.396, Speaker A: Like, which route would you take? Would you just say, hey, it's decentralized. People can put goatsy or whatever they want to put up here, and it's not my responsibility. Or do you try to keep it like a sandbox?
00:25:29.540 - 00:25:48.364, Speaker B: What's. I think you sort of mirror Twitter and what they've done. So what's interesting is Twitter. There's pornography allowed on Twitter, but it's sort of isolated, right? Like, I never encounter it. I'm sure you guys don't either. If you're just going through your feed, it's not something you see, it's something you have to seek out. And I think that's more the approach they should take.
00:25:48.364 - 00:26:34.616, Speaker B: They should let people use it how they wish. And because friendtech is a very isolated experience, it's not very social, broadly, like Twitter is, you're getting, you know, like one on one interactions, and you only have one way communication with the owner of that, you know, the shared chat, that it's not going to be a huge issue for them. But what I want to ask you guys is there's this theory in the crypto space that, like, everything will be tokenized and people really do want to have, like, financial value attached to everything and speculate on everything and, like, just broadly about the idea. Because simply put, this is just like, everyone gets a meme coin in their name. That's like what it is right now. We can talk about adding value and delivering value to your chat, but, like, 99% of people can't deliver alpha, and if they. They can't do it consistently.
00:26:34.616 - 00:26:55.714, Speaker B: Right. So this is really just, everyone gets a meme coin that can be speculated on. Like, what are your thoughts about that? Like, in the future, will all of us just have like a Justin Bram token and anyone can buy it or sell it, and there's like, this memetic value to it and it's fun to trade? Is that the innovation here? Is that what people are going to keep leaning into?
00:26:55.834 - 00:27:42.076, Speaker A: I think it has the novelty aspect. Like I said, it's the first time that we've seen something take off in this category. But I don't think it's healthy for young people, especially, to associate themselves with a token that goes up or down. I've seen some of the other takes from Twitter people and other podcasts talking about if somebody can start shorting you and then they might be incentivized to hurt you. There's these kind of problems. But ultimately, if all we make is a better version of Patreon, where you can also be a bit more partaking in someone's journey as a content creator, and this just becomes something for content creators, then potentially there's an upside. And I agree, this will succeed or fail based on how well and how quickly they make improvements.
00:27:42.076 - 00:27:50.700, Speaker A: Right? Like, how good is team? Team has a chance. They got the attention. They're going to have to keep fixing bonding curves, fixing different things.
00:27:50.852 - 00:28:32.862, Speaker C: Yeah. And I actually think, like, of course, I think as soon as, like, there's like 100 holders for a particular, particular key, the price of the key goes to, like, one ETH, which prices most people out. But I think that was intended because if there's like a thousand holders of Kobe and the shares are worth like $10, no one's going to care, right? The only people, the only reason people care is because if 100 people buy a certain person meme coin, whatever you want to call it, the share can go to, like one or two ETH, and that brings attention. And like you said, it is a bit on the team. The team can fix the bonding curve, like, later down the line, they can lower the fees. They can do buybacks of the most active key holders and whatnot. So I actually think it's a really novel experiment and I'm really looking forward to it.
00:28:32.862 - 00:28:54.714, Speaker C: I will say that I think I saw a tweet about, if you want to invest in, like, people, like, you need to bet on people with, like, super high egos because they're going to do whatever they can to make sure that they're their key trades above their other competitors. So I've seen, like, a lot of, like, egomaniacs just say, okay, like, for sure I'm worth more than that guy. So I'm going to, like, just buy back all my shares until, like, I'm above that guy.
00:28:54.794 - 00:28:58.722, Speaker A: Are you buying some Adam Cochran keys? Is that what you're telling?
00:28:58.898 - 00:29:11.244, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I was, like, sub tweeting him, but there's also other people, too. But it's like, yeah, Adam Cochran's just buying back keys. It's like, okay, that's pretty funny. Cool.
00:29:11.284 - 00:29:50.574, Speaker A: Well, we'll keep an eye on this project for sure. Obviously, it's one of the few that has separated itself out in terms of activity. So we'll, I'm sure, have some updates as they develop their product. But, taeki, I wanted to get your thoughts on another of the spicy altcoin cycle takes. We can put it up, but he's basically saying DeFi is a failed experiment. We had a balancer pool and this is coming after recently, we had a curve pool issue. So even these, like, very safe og products, some of the very ogs of DeFi, DeFi 1.0,
00:29:50.574 - 00:30:03.892, Speaker A: are having issues and the yields are generally not that high right now. And I know you've been a humble farmer for a long time. How do you take what cycle is saying here? Do you agree? Is it more nuanced? What do you think?
00:30:04.028 - 00:30:50.302, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with half of what he's saying. I do say that because the yields have dried up across the board, I don't think it's worth aving too much of your portfolio into DeFi protocols. The only applications that I'm farming right now is using Aave. I stake some meat into Eigen layer, and I also farm on GMX, like shorting avalanche and whatnot. I think that's more like a nuanced take. But I think it's unfair to say that Defi defies a failed experiment, because if you think about, like, the tradfi and fintech products, all the products are built around the dollar and trying to create more value around the dollar and the utility for anyone that uses it. And Defi, the crypto money, crypto native money is like bitcoin and ether, and Defi enhances the utility of these crypto monies.
00:30:50.302 - 00:31:21.264, Speaker C: And, of course, if the value of bitcoin and ether is going down, then there's less value inherently for Defi. But as soon as bitcoin and ether both appreciate in value, which I think we all, I mean, hopefully believe that's also going to enhance, like, the value of defi. So it's very cyclical. And I've been saying that I think right now, like, defi native applications are, like, just not good enough. You know, like, nothing in crypto can beat the risk free rate, which is a hard pill to swallow. But I think that's just how it is right now. And I fully do believe that.
00:31:21.264 - 00:31:48.412, Speaker C: I think if Defi were to come back, they kind of need to rely on real world assets and bringing yield from off chain sources to on chain sources. So, unfortunately, I do agree with Hava's statement. I'm not really. I don't really encourage people to just ape their life savings into earning 7% yield on whatever lp positions. It's probably just not worth it. And I think it's better to just try to survive and, you know, take bets. Like air draw.
00:31:48.412 - 00:32:03.744, Speaker C: Yeah, like most air. Like most farming right now, it's not even, like yield farming. It's like airdrop farming. Right. I guess, like, I'm also farming ambient finance, which is like the bear chain Dex, with, like, that raise of money. An Eigen layer, I mean, like, everything else, is probably not worth it, unfortunately.
00:32:04.644 - 00:32:18.592, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's not that much, you know, safe farming in the traditional sense. So we've gone down airdrop farming and more of sisyphus style farming, I guess, like. Justin, have you, have you been doing any farming?
00:32:18.688 - 00:32:53.988, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been airdrop farming. Eigen layer. So for those that aren't familiar, Eigen layer is this restaking project, and they also launched, like, a very transparent point system. And so for the capital that you put in for the stake deep and other variations of stake deep tokens you put in, you get a certain amount of points proportional to everyone else, and they track this really nicely for you. And so what I personally did was I built a little model in Excel where I basically, on one axis, I have the fully diluted valuation. I think Eigen layer could launch it. And that's a range from about 1 billion to 5 billion.
00:32:53.988 - 00:33:34.122, Speaker B: You can talk about how I landed at that. And on the other end of the spectrum, I have what percentage of the supply they're going to airdrop. And then from there, you can build this like, great chart plotted on an X and Y axis of like, based on how much capital you put in, what share of the airdrop will you receive, and then what will that be worth? Right, based on these different valuation possibilities and airdrop percentages. So, for me personally, like the inputs I put in, I think they're going to airdrop between one and 5% of the total supply. That's a little more conservative probably, than most people. I think a standard airdrop is usually about 10% now. But I think they're going to launch at such a high valuation that they can get away with a one to 5% airdrop.
00:33:34.122 - 00:34:19.904, Speaker B: And I think the valuation will be somewhere between one to 5 billion fully diluted. I see this as having as high valuation as comparable L2s. Right now, Eigen layer is obviously not building a L2, but I think it will sort of be valued in that same lens, if not a little higher, because it's the only project right now building what they're building. Um, so for me, like, these are opportunities I look at where I can safely maintain staked ETH exposure, because I still want to get that 4% or so yield on ETH and then get like, potential additional upside. So, for me personally, about like 10% of my portfolio of ETH is sitting in eigen layer earnings, staking yields, and then presumably farming this airdrop should. And when they, when they do it. So that's how I think about that.
00:34:20.364 - 00:34:34.943, Speaker D: Let's say like, so I'm guessing you've modeled this out for, like, I'm gonna have to stake this for three to six months. What is like the, what is like the yield percentage on your ethnic, on top of the staking yield in your model?
00:34:35.643 - 00:35:14.152, Speaker B: I didn't calculate yield percentage. I was just looking at net new dollars that I'd earn. And simply because for me, the yield is less interesting to model because I don't know how long we're going to have to stay locked. They might not airdrop for another year, they might airdrop next month. And that would impact your aprs, basically how long your capital is sitting there. But for me, the way I modeled it out, I think I'm expecting about a 20% return when they do airdrop it, whenever that date may be. So if you put in $10,000, I think I modeled out that you would earn 2000 for doing so.
00:35:14.152 - 00:35:42.544, Speaker B: And that's based on. I think I don't have the sheet in front of me now, but about a two and a half billion dollar fdv and a three or 4% airdrop, which I think is pretty conservative. These yields are diluted now just because when I joined, there was a smaller, a lower cap on ETH. Now we're at a higher cap, and that cap was reached. There's over 100,000 ETH, I want to say put in. So your yield is going to go down as you keep getting diluted. But for folks that were in a few months ago, I think it'll be pretty lucrative.
00:35:42.964 - 00:36:21.494, Speaker C: Yeah, like, I know some people that put like a couple million dollars worth of ETH, and I think, I don't have the model with me, but I think they modeled out that, like, if you got in really early, you can get a 50% to 70% aPR, assuming a reasonable valuation for Eigen layer. So, definitely worth it. I think anyone that stakes ETH, when they next open deposit caps, you'll probably earn at least 10% in ETH, maybe 20, 30%. And I guess we're invested in a market where on chain yields, not that great. So we just have to airdrop farm, and like, farm those imaginary points. Imaginary APR, that's kind of where we're at.
00:36:21.654 - 00:36:43.320, Speaker B: This is very speculative, but, and I wouldn't take this to, to the bank, but I've also heard that you'll get sort of potential ecosystem airdrops from people building on top of or with eigen layer. So this is a throwback. But if you remember, I think stake terra people. Like, if you stake Terra on, with terra staking, you would get like project airdrops from when they launched.
00:36:43.422 - 00:36:48.428, Speaker A: Adam has that. You can do that with staked atom, you get all the cosmos airdrops.
00:36:48.516 - 00:36:49.420, Speaker B: Oh, nice.
00:36:49.612 - 00:36:50.380, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:36:50.412 - 00:37:04.084, Speaker B: So I think that'll be like, if you're a new project building on Eigen Lair, want to utilize Eigen lair. It's sort of a no brainer to use that as a subset of people you want to airdrop to. So I think that's a potential cherry on top, but it's not something worth expecting.
00:37:04.204 - 00:38:22.944, Speaker A: I generally like, you know, listening to you talking about Eigen Lair thinking about it from like the big, big picture. We're in this bear market right now and you have, you know, you have a few VC darlings like layer zero raised at 3 billion, you have Eigen layer, you have some of these like projects that potentially ZK sync, you know, very, very well funded and there's airdrops, there's money that those projects have to disperse with their token. There's a bunch of other ones coming on board like PIF, some of the big Oracle's multi billion projects. And I think we're all hoping that a lot of these end up becoming correct in the sense of like the VC investment at 3 billion for layer zero makes sense because it is indeed going to be something that creates even more than that of value. And that's the bull case and that's great for everybody. And the more scary cases like those things won't have product market fit, but because they're all well funded, you know, for people that are airdrop farming or able to participate, you know, there's some money to be made during the bear market to kind of keep the, keep the fire burning on the wood stove. Do you guys think it's, it's more part a or part b? What's the voting between you three?
00:38:23.404 - 00:39:16.022, Speaker C: Yeah, like for me, like every time I've gotten like an airdrop I've like just dumped it. So maybe this is like a vote in favor of like maybe aerodrops aren't really worth it from a project perspective, but I guess like they have to have like one way to distribute tokens. Yeah, I do think that, you know, most people just view aerodrome farming as a way to like just extract value and try this all the top and you know, we're kind of like just basing off these Eigen layer, layer zero valuations based off of like what these vc's valid at. We have like no idea, right? Like we have no idea what value layer zero or Eigen layer creates. So I think it's people just hoping that, okay, prices aren't going up. It's so hard to make money. The only way to make money in a safer manner is by just depositing either and stables into these less tested smart contracts and hopefully be rewarded for the risk we take.
00:39:16.198 - 00:39:38.854, Speaker A: Yeah, it reminds me a lot of the thing that we were seeing during the COVID times, this like crazy zero interest rate situation that we had going on for a few years where it was just about getting users didn't really matter if you had profit. It just mattered to have some good metrics. And then you use Softbank as somebody to kind of pump your bags. I don't know, Justin, are you more optimistic than me?
00:39:39.394 - 00:40:22.248, Speaker B: Well, I want to throw out a counterpoint that I fundamentally do believe into this post we referenced earlier, that basically airdrops are pointless and that you guys are sort of alluding to now. I think that's missing a huge piece of it. Like, yes, you're giving out free money and most people are going to dump and you're going to get Sybil attacked, but from a regular regulatory standpoint, I can't think of a more reasonable way to distribute a token and get your token out there than airdropping it. If you're in the US, you don't want to be selling your token to everyone. So how do you get initial liquidity, initial distribution? The only way I can think of, and maybe I'm, this is a blind spot for me, but is through an airdrop, is by giving it out to people that have used the app. Of course, it's not an efficient use of capital right now.
00:40:22.296 - 00:40:22.456, Speaker D: Right.
00:40:22.480 - 00:40:53.042, Speaker B: It would be better to sell those tokens on the open market or do something else with it. But this is the state of where we're at now. You can't sell your tokens. You need them to start trading if you want to eventually exit or, you know, whatever it may be with your token. So this is the option people have. And, you know, I've been bearish on airdrops, growing communities, being sustainable, leading to further adoption, all of that. Like, I'm totally on board with that, but you need to get your token out there, and this is the only way to do it.
00:40:53.042 - 00:41:11.964, Speaker B: And so I think they're going to continue for that reason. But I definitely agree they're not, you know, super effective. Right. People mostly dump early, and you're, I don't know anyone that's regretted dumping an airdrop early. Right? I mean, tokens are pretty much down only against Ethan, at least they have been for the past several years. So, yeah.
00:41:12.624 - 00:41:27.244, Speaker A: Who's on the bid during these, like, airdrop dumping periods? Like Thiki, do you think, like, we had say recently, we had some of these, like, larger ones. Who. Who is buying the people selling the airdrops? Do you think about that? Is it like liquid funds or is it just the community?
00:41:28.864 - 00:41:58.134, Speaker D: I think it's a mix of both. I mean, I think it is the airdrop fractal is like a very famous thing where, like, you know, it dumps hard in the beginning, but then, like, there's always like a rip once the dumping stops. So it could just be speculators trying to, like, you know, like musical chairs and see how far they can push it because it is like a, you know, how high can you go? Kind of thing. And, like, you know, a lot of the Koreans tend to push up these new listings, too. Yeah, I don't know if there are any genuine, like, long term holders that are going to buy these prices that are still left because I feel like they've already all lost all their money.
00:41:59.534 - 00:42:26.036, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm always curious if, you know, it's more institutional or more community who is kind of, like you said, there's a sell off and then somebody's buying. We do see like a second wave of the price going up. So cool. Anyways, great conversation. I think we have a new segment that we, as usual, want to trial at the end of our episode. This one is inspired by a couple beloved italian influencers.
00:42:26.140 - 00:42:31.384, Speaker C: Chocolate and coffee together proved chef Burak not approved.
00:42:31.724 - 00:42:57.844, Speaker A: It's gonna be called approved or not approved. And we're gonna see some interesting tweets, and we'll see, we'll see if you guys approve or not approve. So one that went the rounds this week, Chamath has been gotten a little bit snarky. There's been some back and forth between Chamath and some Twitter folk. And what do you guys think of this take?
00:42:58.184 - 00:43:43.926, Speaker B: Yeah, this was a good one. You know, I'm a big all in fan. I think with this podcast, we're trying to go for all in vibes, but for crypto. So I'm not anti chamath by any means, but he got, he got absolutely roasted. So he posted this reply to a journalist, Joe from. I think he's at Wall Street Journal talking about how Chamath has sort of just like, pumped these spacs and Chamath made fun of basically journalism as a career, this amma journalism meme, and then this, this random guy with like, well, actually has quite a bit decent amount of followers just posted in the arena. Just sort of like mocking VC's for thinking or for like, promoting this idea that they're like, absolutely building.
00:43:43.926 - 00:43:55.876, Speaker B: And some of them are, of course. But I think Chamath's reputation is more. He launches these spacs and sort of dumps on the market, and we saw a lot of that during the COVID bubble, so I thought this was hilarious.
00:43:56.060 - 00:44:18.414, Speaker A: Can we talk about how brutal this ratio is? I mean, this guy got less views than Chamath's tweet, and he hit. The ratio is 21 72 to 47. I mean, this is a fifth. I don't think I've seen a brutal ratio like this just. Just for the entertainment value. Definitely. Approved.
00:44:19.114 - 00:44:19.866, Speaker D: Approved.
00:44:19.970 - 00:44:20.418, Speaker B: Approved.
00:44:20.466 - 00:44:53.884, Speaker C: You kind of see this similar sentiment crypto, too, right? Like, this anti VC sentiment. And, you know, like, people might not like what. What's happening with Frontech, but, you know, at least people are trying to launch something that, you know, trying to get people to use and in a way, like the on chain degens. Like, we are in the arena. Like, we're, like, depositing money into these untested protocols and just trying to speculate. And I do like the idea behind chamath, but I guess the person saying it, I guess it doesn't really resonate with his audience because he just dumps specs.
00:44:54.464 - 00:45:09.222, Speaker B: If you are an all in fan, I just. Not to interrupt. I want to throw this out there. I'm actually going to the all in summit because I'm in LA, and it's happening in LA, so it's mid September. If you're going to the all in summit, drop a comment below. We should meet up. Do a steady lads meet up there.
00:45:09.398 - 00:45:53.576, Speaker D: I mean, I think it is like a common, like you said, this is a combination crypto where it's, like, it's hard to balance the sort of material wealth and, like, also social wealth. You know, it's hard to be rich and well liked, especially when the reason why you become rich is by, I guess, going on natural television and telling everyone to buy your spacs and buy Tesla and then dumping on them at the top and then having everyone lose a bunch of money. Like, I feel like chamath is being a little bit tone deaf here and not recognizing, like, that, so. Or zero sum nature where he basically just dumped a bunch of shares, worthless shares, on american retail and, you know, profit hundreds of millions, if not billions, off of it. But, yeah, I think that's just a trade off you have to make. I still like the guy, but, yeah, I think he's being looked on deaf here.
00:45:53.720 - 00:46:06.696, Speaker A: All right, well, hopefully you don't get kicked out for the summit for making fun of chamath, Justin. But, yeah, this one is approved. Let's see what else we have. NYT, don't miss. What is this one, Taki?
00:46:06.720 - 00:46:11.284, Speaker B: This is yours, right? Do you want to walk us through this meme that we've been seeing around crypto, Twitter?
00:46:11.824 - 00:46:43.822, Speaker C: Yeah. So I guess it's like, this idea that male virginity is on the rise. Male loneliness is on their eyes, and the only way to bet on that trend is to bet on crypto, because I guess crypto is mostly a male dominated industry that's, you know, that happens to be, like, terminating terminally online. And this trend towards frontech and, like, these mini bubbles that form around some of these craters, maybe this is, like, literally, like, if you want to bet on male loneliness, you, like, buy frontech shares and, like, hope the airdrop is worth something.
00:46:43.878 - 00:46:46.822, Speaker A: So what the hell is going on in this picture? Is this guy.
00:46:46.878 - 00:46:47.166, Speaker D: This.
00:46:47.230 - 00:47:04.890, Speaker A: This guy with a mustache has these, like, crocodile tears watching some people play paddle ball, and he. He want. I don't understand this. You want to play pickleball, and he. They don't let him play, and he's crying. What's going on here? I don't, like, this is not approved by me. I don't know.
00:47:05.082 - 00:47:05.626, Speaker D: I think.
00:47:05.690 - 00:47:32.254, Speaker B: I think the original meme is, like, I don't know if where you're based, like, pickleball is blowing up, but here in the US, like, pickleball is this crazy phenomenon over the last year or two where, like, everyone's pivoting from tennis to pickleball. Everyone is into pickleball. It's all guys can talk about. And so I think the original New York Times article is actually. Is pickleball the cure to male loneliness or is male? Yeah. Which is hilarious. So I think it's just the same picture replicated.
00:47:32.374 - 00:47:33.534, Speaker A: Okay. Okay.
00:47:33.654 - 00:47:36.994, Speaker C: It's a crypto, bro. That's. That. His friends are touching grass.
00:47:37.694 - 00:47:43.914, Speaker D: Okay, so the title is like, like, inspect elemented. It's not like a real.
00:47:44.254 - 00:47:45.786, Speaker C: Oh, fuck.
00:47:45.950 - 00:47:47.834, Speaker D: Is that, you know, happening?
00:47:47.914 - 00:47:49.786, Speaker B: Yeah, this is. This is edited.
00:47:49.930 - 00:47:53.814, Speaker D: I was about to say. I was like, wow, July 19. That was, like, some amazing foresight.
00:47:56.394 - 00:47:57.010, Speaker B: No, no.
00:47:57.082 - 00:48:03.534, Speaker A: All right, so, you know, I have mixed feelings. This is approved or not approved?
00:48:04.554 - 00:48:06.594, Speaker B: Approved. 100% approved.
00:48:06.714 - 00:48:07.570, Speaker D: Approved.
00:48:07.722 - 00:48:11.802, Speaker B: Betting on BTC and ETH is betting on the. Is betting on male loneliness.
00:48:11.898 - 00:48:28.930, Speaker D: I kind of. I mean. I mean, like, there's been a whole generation of, like, people just playing video games all day and, like, being online, internally online, and, like, having them, I guess, provide price discovery for assets might be, like, a good use of their time compared to having them play video games instead. I don't know. What do you guys think?
00:48:29.082 - 00:49:04.752, Speaker C: The one thing I like about crypto Twitter is? It's like a meritocracy, right? Like, you don't have to have, like, a crazy background to gain followers. If you have good ideas, then, you know, you can gain a following. You can have, like, online friends. And actually, you know, think that crypto, I mean, crypto is exclusive in a sense that, like, you know, it's me. It's like, mostly male dominated, but it's also inclusive in the fact that, you know, you don't have to, you know, you can like to spin up an online avatar and just start saying things. And if that, if your ideas resonate, then, you know, you're going to be part of a community. So actually kind of like.
00:49:04.752 - 00:49:13.576, Speaker C: Yeah, it's kind of like a double edged sword, I suppose. But I think xt is a really interesting niche community that you can't find elsewhere.
00:49:13.720 - 00:49:29.848, Speaker A: Yeah. And this specific joke did go over my head, but I can see that it was a joke in the end. Okay, all right. Well, approved for managing to level us. What else do we have?
00:49:29.976 - 00:49:39.058, Speaker B: So we have one last one here that is dedicated to our co host, thicky here. Who wants to walk us through this one?
00:49:39.226 - 00:49:42.614, Speaker A: This seems to be a thick collective. Is this an actual NFT collection?
00:49:43.434 - 00:49:45.094, Speaker C: I think so. I think it exists.
00:49:45.714 - 00:49:47.490, Speaker D: I sweep the floor on this one.
00:49:47.602 - 00:50:02.522, Speaker A: When several of these thicks gather, their thick, electric cheeks can cause thunderstorms. The art is amazing. The colors pop out. We have a thickie here. I mean, this is, this is a home run.
00:50:02.658 - 00:50:03.746, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I have to go.
00:50:03.770 - 00:50:07.014, Speaker D: Buy one right now. Off blur or something.
00:50:07.354 - 00:50:12.538, Speaker B: I disapprove. This is inappropriate. Shouldn't be part of the podcast. We should move on.
00:50:12.706 - 00:50:16.010, Speaker C: I went on opensea. I found the blankets. It has a 6.98 floor.
00:50:16.082 - 00:50:17.522, Speaker D: 6.9. Geez.
00:50:17.618 - 00:50:25.826, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I mean, I doubt it's been traded, right? It's like this one, dude, like, listing it. I don't even know if this is, like, the real one. There's like, thicky.
00:50:25.850 - 00:50:28.772, Speaker B: Is this your collection? The thick labs generation.
00:50:28.908 - 00:50:30.916, Speaker D: But there's holographic ones too.
00:50:31.060 - 00:50:37.464, Speaker C: There's some unrevealed. Interesting. Can you look at thick blastoise?
00:50:38.284 - 00:50:39.464, Speaker B: Where is that one?
00:50:39.804 - 00:50:43.064, Speaker C: Scroll down a little on the left. The. Yeah, that one.
00:50:43.684 - 00:50:46.304, Speaker B: Oh, wow, look at the. It's actually nice imagery.
00:50:47.284 - 00:50:48.864, Speaker D: The arts, actually really good.
00:50:49.324 - 00:50:52.984, Speaker C: Yeah. I approved. I approve this. I approve this collection.
00:50:53.644 - 00:50:54.372, Speaker D: Approved.
00:50:54.468 - 00:51:01.050, Speaker A: Is that shine symbol? This is supposed to be like the gloss on a physical card as you move it.
00:51:01.162 - 00:51:02.186, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:51:02.330 - 00:51:03.034, Speaker D: Wow.
00:51:03.194 - 00:51:06.294, Speaker B: I'm still disapproving it sounds like you guys all approve, though.
00:51:06.794 - 00:51:07.906, Speaker D: Yeah, heavy approved.
00:51:07.970 - 00:51:09.574, Speaker C: Pokemon was my childhood, so.
00:51:09.874 - 00:51:30.666, Speaker A: All right, folks, well, looks like we have a clean sweep. Of approval for the most part. Let us know what you think about this segment next time. We'll try to have some not approved as well. And yeah, catch us next week. We're looking forward to having a bit of a trader focused conversation next week as well with our first guest, potentially. So till next time.
00:51:30.770 - 00:51:31.154, Speaker B: Bye, bro.
