00:00:00.720 - 00:00:21.310, Speaker A: Hopefully, benefits of doing this episode is trying to explain to both sides, like, what's actually going on. Because, yeah, it's like, who do we blame this for? Everyone is looking at the price. Is it the market makers dumping? The market makers are pissed off because they're actually getting the. They're the ones getting dumped on. You're the ones losing money. It's not like they're like the evil mastermind, like, you know, selling tokens. They're the ones buying.
00:00:21.310 - 00:01:14.046, Speaker A: So welcome to episode 53 of steady lads. This is season two, apparently, is what we're calling it internally. But we will continue to do a weekly show here and hopefully reach episode 104. And none of us drop out, hopefully this time. So we're gonna do a bit of a kind of evergreen episode. We'll dive into market making and how it all works. I think everybody wants to learn more about that, not just on the project side, but even retail traders.
00:01:14.046 - 00:01:23.330, Speaker A: Everybody else probably wants to understand what's going on. There's a lot of who do we blame this for? Who do we blame this for?
00:01:23.750 - 00:01:33.146, Speaker B: To set the stage. Jordy, can you just go over your background and starting Salini? And I guess you know how much volume you do now on a daily basis.
00:01:33.258 - 00:02:11.266, Speaker A: Yeah, so Cellini is a prop trading firm. Our main business is trading to make profit on our own behalf, which just means, like, no clients. We're just simply trying to be smart about like buying and selling, hopefully buying low, selling high. And our background is very much on traditional finance trading. So HFT, usually those types of strategies translate pretty well to crypto because it's ultimately the same thing. You have similar microstructure, similar books. That's mainly on the c five side.
00:02:11.266 - 00:02:57.354, Speaker A: Defi is like a different beast. You're dealing with a lot of extra parameters and you need to have crypto domain expertise to really do that well. But you can see firms that are dominating on the traditional side, like Jamfeene Tower, those are probably the two biggest, are also the ones doing a lot of activity on the crypto side, and Cellini is in that group. We're doing a lot of volume on CME and ICE futures exchanges, and a lot of our team has background from Virtu and tower. And I myself was at some of these firms as well. So our DNA is very much on the HFT side.
00:02:57.522 - 00:03:08.978, Speaker C: And for folks that don't know, what would you say that the job of a market maker is? So switching gears from Salini being a trading firm to a market making firm, how could folks understand what you guys actually do.
00:03:09.074 - 00:04:17.740, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's exchange market making, and then there's kind of like designated token market making, which are two quite separate things. Exchange market making means you are providing passive liquidity in the markets, and you're just trading different books. Now, you can be doing it without anyone incentivizing you purely because the flow is good. Like, if you're trading on binance, you're not really getting incentivized necessarily to provide liquidity on the bitcoin or ETH books, but because there's so much flow and so much volume, you can mix spread. Now, if the book is not getting a lot of flow and it's illiquid, usually there'll be incentives to kind of get things going. So a lot of dexs, and notably like Dydx was one of the first ones, they just provide a lot of token incentives to get that first liquidity going, get the game started, because when you have retail coming, you want them to see books. You don't want the slippage to be, you know, they put a $10,000 order and it just like rips through the book.
00:04:17.740 - 00:04:55.530, Speaker A: So in, it's kind of like a chicken and egg thing. And to get the, the chicken started, a lot of exchanges will give incentives to market makers. And I consider this to be like a very legitimate thing. Like, you know, CME does this with every new product. Like they started a ten year tn future. They start just giving you monthly payments to quote a certain size. So this is one kind of market making, and it's very natural that there's a requirement for people to step in and bootstrap this.
00:04:55.530 - 00:06:01.068, Speaker A: The other kind of market making is what you would see in traditional markets on maybe like Nasdaq or NYSE, you'll have dmms, which are designated market makers for a specific stock, to make sure that there's liquidity when somebody trades. Because if there's not a ton of back and forth flow all day, nonstop, like you have an s and P 500, you'll need someone to provide liquidity. The reason is every time you place a passive order, if you think about it, you're not getting anything. You're sort of just giving everybody else a free option to hit you. So whenever there's volatility, like, somebody can just take you whether it's up or down, and you're not getting anything in the meantime, because no one is trading back and forth and giving you spread. And sort of being a market maker involves, in essence, sometimes taking a bit of a hit on showing these orders and giving the market an option to hit you, and then hopefully you're getting compensated in some other fashion.
00:06:01.214 - 00:06:15.704, Speaker C: And would you say, talking about the crypto landscape, do projects need market makers? And what happens when a project doesn't sign on with a market maker and just say, launches their token airdrops? It launches it on chain, and doesn't worry about sexes, listings, market makers, etcetera.
00:06:15.872 - 00:07:06.574, Speaker A: So it depends what type of project and what stage it is generally, and I've talked about this on the podcast many times before, there is the product that people are building, like whether it's a Dex or they're building like liquid restaking or whatever they're doing, and then there's the token. And the token is also a product, and you want the token regardless of what you're building. You want the token to be a good product, and that usually means that it's on different places where it's easily accessible, you know, major exchanges, major kind of Dexs maybe as well. And then you want there to be liquidity so that the slippage is not high. We see that a lot of projects say that liquid funds will not invest in their project. If they don't see that they can get out of, you know, a million dollars within like, a day. They want to be able to exit their positions.
00:07:06.574 - 00:07:36.812, Speaker A: Otherwise they're not comfortable to invest. Maybe they have a mandate that, you know, they need to be able to see the exit door. And so they do often need a market maker. There is a need for having real market makers that are providing liquidity. And the way I'll describe it is, as a market maker, if you're doing your job properly, you are sort of bridging the gap between long term buyers and sellers by providing the short term water that will let things be liquid between them.
00:07:36.956 - 00:07:58.288, Speaker C: You talked a little bit about how in the stock market, for a very liquid stock, they might not need to hire market makers specifically for an S and P 500 ETF. Do any crypto projects get to that scale when they're, let's say, listed everywhere? And we'll go through the exchanges and the players in a minute. Do projects ever graduate outside of needing a market maker, or is it always something that you think is typically required?
00:07:58.424 - 00:08:19.216, Speaker A: Yeah, they do. I think obviously bitcoin doesn't need a market maker. It's what everyone trades all day. You can just make money. Trading spread ETH is definitely also in that category. And I would say Solana is probably there as well. Like, really doesn't really need any market maker.
00:08:19.216 - 00:09:05.326, Speaker A: I mean, there's, there's a lot of reason for people just to quote it anyway. And then you have like the other top tens, I would say most of them don't need a market maker, but some of them choose to have it anyway because they realize that like XRP is a good example where I've heard for years and years that they have paid a lot of market makers just to quote and do volume. And it's like why? Like you're a top ten project, you don't really need it. They don't need it, but they do it anyway just to stay relevant. In terms of being high on the volume charts and just having really thick liquidity, they are very focused on their token being a product and they'll still spend a lot on it, even though I would say they don't need it. And then once you get out of top ten, I think every single project does need a market maker.
00:09:05.398 - 00:09:21.170, Speaker C: So Jordy, I see you have a list here that you've shared of exchanges and then listing strength, difficulty and cost. And we'll talk about Dexs after. But let's just start here. What does listing strength mean? What does difficulty mean? Can you just walk us through what this looks like?
00:09:22.030 - 00:10:12.010, Speaker A: Yeah. So listing strength is how much buying activity is there in that exchange? Like how good is it for your token? And definitely founders are very much trying to get high listing strength. You really want to be on the topic of exchanges if you're trying to hit billionths of FDB. And I would say it's pretty known for the last year that binance is the place where you get the biggest amount of distribution in terms of the amount of users they have in the many, many millions. So we have a couple categories. One is listing strength, another one is difficulty of listing. How hard is it to get your project if you're trying to get a listing there and they're not necessarily one to one.
00:10:12.010 - 00:10:41.114, Speaker A: I would say there is exchanges that are hard to get listed. They don't matter that much and vice versa. And then we have the cost, which is what generally happens when you try to get listed, what to expect. So there's quite a range here. It's well known that binance is the most desirable and it's also like a high difficulty listing venue. And you can generally see the number of listings that are done. It's not that high.
00:10:41.114 - 00:10:56.170, Speaker A: Arguably though, like OKX lists even less stuff. They're very careful with what they list, but I wouldn't say that they're buying right now is as strong. We're not seeing that their market share is anywhere near binance, for example.
00:10:56.790 - 00:11:18.980, Speaker C: I want to get to cost in a second, but just before that, have you seen projects that have struggled to get decent listings on day one and have grown into powerful listings? Or is this something that you think needs to really be sorted for TGE? And the strongest projects really need to be on these large exchanges with great listing strength? Or is it not so much a concern on day one?
00:11:19.960 - 00:11:50.310, Speaker A: You can fight against the current. There's not many examples. Generally, exchanges want to be there on day one because they want to get that big activity. They make trading fees and the volumes are the highest at the beginning when the TGE happens. That's also when they can get new users. Because let's say like you're your gaming project pixels or something, the users that are about to get an airdrop, they're going to look for a centralized exchange. And you can actually get new users if you list the project on TGE, because that's, that's when everything's happening.
00:11:50.310 - 00:12:25.290, Speaker A: So generally, there's the really obvious projects, the ones that are being talked about for years, and everybody knows about them. They don't really need to do much. The exchanges will just list them, even if they're hyped only recently. Like Jupyter, for example, is one that got listed everywhere, didn't really need to do much. People just knew that this was going to be a big deal. And even though they had their own launchpad on their own website, they still got listed everywhere. Then you have strong projects, but they need to go through a process and try to get there.
00:12:25.290 - 00:13:00.676, Speaker A: They'll negotiate with the exchanges. Maybe they'll give them tokens, do a launch pad or kind of advisory tokens. So, you know, the most desirable exchanges right now, I would say, are binance. And then probably bybit is very desirable. And in that next category, you see like upbit, Coinbase, OKX, those are pretty hard to list on. They'll list a few things, maybe a couple of months, that's about it. I think Korea is quite strict, and Coinbase obviously is, has a very long legal process as well as Okexe.
00:13:00.778 - 00:13:23.540, Speaker C: I know you can't give recommendations. This would be painting such a broad brush on something that's nuanced. But for a project that's just getting traction, would you recommend they push tge off until they have enough traction to make these listings easy or more of a sure thing? Or would you say just launch the token today, get the token out there, build your community and try to grow into these exchanges?
00:13:23.840 - 00:13:48.630, Speaker A: Well, obviously it depends. If you're going to get there, then you should just wait. If you're not sure, then you can launch a token. Use the token, because tokens are like a growth hack. So sometimes launching the token can give you a lot of growth and then you can parley that into your next level. But if you're close to getting a listing, then you should definitely wait and go through the process.
00:13:49.210 - 00:13:58.064, Speaker C: And then as far as cost binance being the most expensive, can you just walk us through what range of costs you've seen as far as a percent of the token supply?
00:13:58.232 - 00:14:41.990, Speaker A: Yeah, so obviously like these are sensitive negotiations. You can see publicly though, when they do a launchpad, and that's how they launch a lot of projects is through a launchpad. They give BNB holders, and recently they've been doing FD USD farming as well, which seems to be like something that they're promoting. They'll give them a decent percentage of the project. It'll range between one to 5%, depending on the size of the project. If it's a multi billion project it might be 1%, and if it's a bit of a mid couple billion project, it'll sometimes be up to 5%. So you can see publicly how much is going to launch Pat.
00:14:41.990 - 00:15:22.478, Speaker A: And then sometimes there's negotiation for advisory tokens. These might be locked up. Most exchanges do ask for advisory tokens, and I would say that the bigger the exchange, like a binance or bybit, they can ask for more because obviously they're negotiating. The negotiating power is very imbalanced. There's a ton of projects. The poor listing managers at these exchanges, they just get inundated, especially in the bull market with so many projects, while in the lower tiers, they're usually the ones reaching out to the projects and being proactive. And so the flow is the other way.
00:15:22.654 - 00:15:38.530, Speaker B: So we talked about centralized exchanges, but what about DeXs? Do we need centralized exchanges? Can tokens get to a point where on chain liquidity is deep enough? Or how do you see the Dex versus Dex landscape for liquidity?
00:15:39.310 - 00:16:26.270, Speaker A: Yeah, so I love Dexs though. This amm thing is a way for having orders without somebody having to constantly cancel and replace, because you're just letting the market go up and down. Obviously impermanent loss is a problem. Now if you're a project, I think the idea of having protocol on liquidity is good. I don't know, like legally with foundation, sometimes you can't do it, but as a concept if you're like an on chain project and you want to own your liquidity and placed x liquidity, I think that's great. Obviously it's mainly crypto natives that are on chain that will then access your token and you'll lose track of like the 90% that are just on their phone, you know, trading binance or whatever else. If you're small, I think you can start with just an on chain presence at some point.
00:16:26.270 - 00:16:55.250, Speaker A: As you grow, it's inevitable. The reality is most of the users are still on centralized exchanges where they can just put their password and have their fiat on ramp, off ramp. But I love Dexs. I think market makers sometimes can help with on chain liquidity as well, which we can get into. But I think on chain is going to become more and more important as people are finding account abstraction to be allowing them to just access it easily.
00:16:55.410 - 00:17:22.950, Speaker B: Okay, so I guess the next question I have is the players in this space. So of course, Alene, one of the largest market makers, also wintermute, I think has really strong brand awareness. What role do these market makers play when it comes to how to token trades? One narrative that I see on Twitter is, oh my God, DWF is the market maker. This token is going to pump. Winner is the market maker. It might go down. Do you think there's any merits to these narratives? Or is it just random Twitter just making stuff up?
00:17:23.290 - 00:17:54.752, Speaker A: Well, look, ultimately there's a dash of truth to everything, but a lot of these claims are exaggerated. And also it depends on the size of the project. Obviously, no one can really determine the price of Solana that easily. It takes way too much to be able to do that. But for a tiny meme coin, then I'm sure there's a lot of pump and dumps happening. There's different categories of market makers and they target different projects. And I would say that here.
00:17:54.752 - 00:18:35.650, Speaker A: When I say highest coverage, I would say that for the major launches of the coins that we all know, Salini, wintermute, and flow traders are probably the ones that you'll see the most often these days. And these are like the multi billion projects, highest coverage because these are trading firms. The main business is trading. So we trade 50 venues. Same with flow traders and wintermute. Then you have firms that are more like asset management or OTC business, and they, they do some trading. So I would say Amber GSR are the most well known and they've been around the longest and kind of like they.
00:18:35.650 - 00:19:33.666, Speaker A: They're still in the old school guard, you know, other players, of course, exist. You know, manifold is one that's also, like, very active on chain. Then you have, you know, and then we have a category called flexible approach. I don't really know what to call this category, you know, being politically correct. Let's just say that they're, they're one of these firms that are open to doing other, you know, a flexible kind of market making and trying to just make, make price look good or make volume look good. So a lot of smaller projects will definitely want to get attention and use that. Then we have recently, I've noticed that a lot of random firms are starting to get into the market making like the DMM space and Galaxy, Falconx, Cumberland.
00:19:33.666 - 00:20:13.510, Speaker A: These are firms that are doing other things, and they're trying to add it as a business line. And that's quite interesting. I think they're not getting a lot of serious projects, but it's kind of like a late joiner. The party's kind of ending, and they heard about the party, so they show up at 03:00 a.m. well, we have the extinct category, so rest in peace. But we'll go through these firms, because last cycle, these were the major market making firms like these four, and none of them are doing it anymore for different reasons. So autonomy has been sort of acquired and sold off.
00:20:13.510 - 00:20:58.640, Speaker A: Doesn't really exist. Three arrows is one that was offering market making deals as part of their investment. And their investment was so sought after for the logo that even though they weren't really doing proper market making, let's say they were still getting the mandates in terms of getting call options. And I could say the same for Alameda to a certain extent. Like Alameda and three arrows were the ones selling their logo. And finally, notably, the biggest market maker, jump Crypto, they have had a lot of run ins with the law, especially after Luna Terra, notoriously, they were the ones repegging UST and all that stuff. And there's a lot of court cases going on.
00:20:58.640 - 00:21:32.590, Speaker A: They're also like one of the best trading firms in the world in traditional markets. They make a ton of money there. So they have completely exited the sort of DMM space because the risk reward for them is just like, not reasonable for them to do anymore. All these firms were asking for crazy terms. So if you look at some of the term sheets from, like, last cycle, you know, jump was being like, you know, we want 5%, 10% of your tokenization with call options. That's what the landscape was. You don't really see those things anymore, though.
00:21:32.930 - 00:22:00.206, Speaker C: Yeah, I want to get into the structure of these deals in a second. But before that we had this article from the block about how DWF makes deals, and really interesting segment here, but they talk about, they have a section in their contracts apparently called price management. And I think this sort of piggybacks on Taiki's question, and I wanted to just double click on it. What about launch price? Who determines the launch price? How is that negotiated between the exchange, the project, and the market maker?
00:22:00.278 - 00:22:39.040, Speaker A: Again, it depends on the size of the project and the seriousness of the listings going on. If it's one of the serious projects, more legitimate, you're not going to see a lot of price determining by anyone. It'll trade where the market wants it to trade. So airdrop sellers will just be selling, people will be buying, and just depending on how strong the market is, it'll even out. Now, exchanges do ask for things like they'll want a listing price or a starting price. This is not too important. And I think the importance of it gets overblown.
00:22:39.040 - 00:23:27.576, Speaker A: This is sort of like a cosmetic thing, just like, where to start the chart? Do you want to start the chart here or do you want to start the chart here? And generally you want to start the chart a bit lower so that it looks good, it goes up. But this is like a plastic surgery type of decision, and I don't think it matters much. The main things that will determine the market price are the supply and demand. Supply will be how much airdrop or how much selling is happening from, you know, are there unlocked tokens given to investors day one? Who has tokens? And conversely, like, how hyped are things like, have they done a good job of, have they done a bunch of, you know, memes that have caught attention and then, you know, people are aware, or is there a very small community and the tree falls in the middle of the forest, but nobody hears it.
00:23:27.688 - 00:23:52.190, Speaker C: So on the topic of the who do we blame this for? Question, which I think is on everyone's mind when a project price starts really high, let's say, and just perpetually dumps, you would say there's some shared blame there between the project, the market maker and the exchange. But the flip side of that is if the project does a good enough job growing their community, getting traction, hyping everything up, the project will do well, right? It's not like these factors are sort of outside of the project's hands, right?
00:23:52.730 - 00:24:18.206, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't say it's everyone's fault. It's mainly the project's fault. It's tokenomics. So the tokenomics design is what's usually to blame. If you start with a low float, deceptively high FTV, and then you just like unlock tokens forever. As we've seen with like ton of projects, you know, like even, even like good projects, like the Lidos of the world and, you know, even like the most successful ones, like arbitrum, you kind of have this dynamic where the project's doing well.
00:24:18.206 - 00:25:13.956, Speaker A: It's got a lot ton of TVL, everyone's using it, but the price just hasn't moved in years or it's moved down. Sometimes it's scary down. So unfortunately, I hear quite often still that founders want to have a high FTV to start. It's like a vanity metric, and I guess they kind of prefer to defend, like, do you want to start high and defend it, or do you want to start low and grow it? I always suggest starting low and growing it because then you're kind of giving a good entry point to people. They have a good taste in their mouth from, you know, making money on your project and they're in the green. Even if there's volatility after they're still kind of in the green. If you start high and go low, either it's because you want to be relevant or you want to sell tokens, or you just kind of want to use that momentum to do a lot of business deals.
00:25:13.956 - 00:25:25.228, Speaker A: Maybe that's the nicest way to put it, is that some projects want to list high and then use their high FTV to do partnerships that will hopefully keep up their FDV.
00:25:25.284 - 00:25:46.956, Speaker C: Well, actually, this brings up an interesting question. I mean, we see a lot of projects, or we hear a lot about projects teams, founders, insiders exiting before they're unlocked or exiting even on day one, on listing day, how does that actually happen? The tokens are locked up. How are they actually either hedging out exposure, selling OTC deals, what are you actually seeing there?
00:25:47.108 - 00:26:28.780, Speaker A: So investors generally cannot get out? Investors can only get out if they sell the SAF. And if reassignment is allowed to happen as a secondary sale, usually these happen at pretty steep discounts to the market price because again, like, there's this expected dynamic that things will fall over time and also there's the cost of capital over like the next year while you're waiting for best thing or three years. So discounts can go from 40 to 80, 90%. Obviously, last cycle we saw a lot of these jewel was selling at like 90% and then ends up being a good trade because it still goes down, like even further. Or stepn was another one. That rental was at $3. It was trading at 70% discount.
00:26:28.780 - 00:27:11.506, Speaker A: Like, what is that? Like ninety cents and still kind of touched 20. So you still didn't get a good deal if you bought that on a discount. However, projects can sell if they want. Their treasuries can diversify. And I think if you're not getting good terms from venture capital firms, it's quite reasonable to diversify your treasury by selling some tokens or I, or doing an ICO or whatever it is. If it's legally compliant in your jurisdiction, then often projects will sell some tokens, get Runway, and keep building. And unfortunately, exchanges get a lot of advisory tokens that they can sell as well.
00:27:11.506 - 00:27:15.618, Speaker A: So there is some selling happening from different places.
00:27:15.794 - 00:27:35.712, Speaker C: What about hedging? Do a lot of founders that maybe do their market maker, you do a listing with. Do a lot of founders, like, all of their net worth is tied up in this project. Maybe they have 5% of the supply, 10%, maybe even more in some cases. Do they reach out about hedging exposure? Do they hedge it independently? Is that something you're seeing or not so common?
00:27:35.896 - 00:28:05.872, Speaker A: I wouldn't say hedging is very common in terms of shorting perpetuals, because it's just a hassle to keep perpetual positions open. You don't know the funding rates. It's a little bit of a mess. If they have tokens that are unlocking, they'll of course, want to sell them. If your entire net worth is in some altcoin, you'll want to sell it now the project's live and doing. Well, that's fine if it's. I think Eclipse was one that was trying to sell a lot of tokens before the launch.
00:28:05.872 - 00:28:22.118, Speaker A: At the time, I think, obviously there's management change there, but it can look bad on the outside, and if it gets out of, you know, the founders have already sold before even launching a product. That's probably not advisable, even if they're not diversified in their personal holdings.
00:28:22.214 - 00:29:11.282, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely wish I sold my locked jewel at the top, even at a 90% discount. That's something I regret. But speaking of not selling tokens at a really high price, we had this phenomenon happen yesterday or the day before, where avail did this token or airdrop? And it got listed on bit them, which is a korean exchange, and on Bybit avail was trading at $0.15. But on bit dumb, this thing was trading at like $2. And people talk about the kimchi premium all the time and the korean degens aping in, but why do you think this type of thing? Why do you think there's this much dispersion in how tokens get listed and priced on certain exchanges versus upbit versus bybit? And why doesn't this get arbed immediately? Isn't there, like, a free money glitch to be made here?
00:29:11.426 - 00:29:46.670, Speaker A: So there are certain areas of the world. Korea is the most notable. And potentially, you could kind of come up with a few other asian countries as well, where it's hard to move money and coins around. And the korean exchanges have a lot of KYC requirements. Where did the money come from? The government is being quite strict in terms of money flowing in and out. So what you see with, with korean exchanges is sometimes there's a premium, but what you're referring to is not the kimchi premium. This is a listing supply and demand issue.
00:29:46.670 - 00:30:24.736, Speaker A: The main exchanges, like Bybit and binance don't allow withdrawals for the first day of the listing because they want to keep the activity there. So you'll still have quite, like, large arbitrage that nobody can close because they can't withdraw from one to the other. And the issue is, korean exchanges require KYC for moving funds in. So I don't think most people could move. I don't know how the specific person there managed to move funds in to sell it. It is generally difficult to get coins onto korean exchanges. Maybe if it's an airdrop, maybe that's why.
00:30:24.736 - 00:30:55.448, Speaker A: But if you try to withdraw from Bybit and it's trading a ten x difference, one's trading $0.15, one's trading like $2, you can't do it for the first day. And now we're past 24 hours. And if you check the prices, they've converged because people were eventually able to close that ArP. So I would generally suggest that if you're doing listing on a korean exchange, you wait at least 24 to 48 hours. Otherwise, you have these kind of things. And the reason is because retail doesn't look the price.
00:30:55.448 - 00:31:08.660, Speaker A: They just say, oh, this is a new token. That's listing. I've heard about it. Or maybe I just want to buy the new token. And they don't try to compare, they just buy. And we've seen this with korean exchanges quite often.
00:31:09.200 - 00:31:21.100, Speaker B: Yeah, I heard that the most powerful passport in crypto is Korea, just so that you have access to all these price differences. But, yeah, I just thought. Thank you for the explanation.
00:31:21.480 - 00:31:34.042, Speaker A: Even Koreans, they can't move a ton of money. They can move limited amount of funds in and out. So closing that loop when it's really large is not very optimized.
00:31:34.226 - 00:31:49.058, Speaker C: So, Jordy, we've talked a little bit about who the players are, the exchanges, how this works, but let's go through the actual deal structure on what you're seeing, and then talk a little bit about how market makers make money, how they lose money on occasion, and then how these deals are just structured overall.
00:31:49.234 - 00:32:27.464, Speaker A: Yeah, kind of like top line number is the loan size. Ultimately, when you're market making, you don't have tokens, you're being given tokens, you're giving a loan. And the size of the loan is, I guess, probably the most important thing. So if the loan is very small, you don't have enough tokens, you can't provide liquidity, you can't markets arbitrage between them, so you have different prices. As we talked about with Korea, that happens often. On the other hand, like we talked about jump asking for 5% of tokens. This kind of stuff is probably excessive.
00:32:27.464 - 00:32:54.090, Speaker A: So as a general rule of thumb, I think this market cycle you're seeing for larger projects, somewhere like 50 bps, and for smaller projects, like one to 2% is a typical loan size. Sometimes it's written as a notional, so it'll be like x million dollars. And sometimes it's just a market kind of decided based on bibs.
00:32:54.250 - 00:33:15.372, Speaker C: So just to keep the numbers simple, let's say the loan size is $1 million of XYZ token. Is there any requirement to pair that with, let's say, $1 million of USDC and you're going to be trading both sides, or do you sort of sell some of the tokens that were lent to you and that covers the cost of the, the quote token, whether it's ETH, USDC, BTC, that's actually a really.
00:33:15.396 - 00:33:51.390, Speaker A: Good question, and it'll take us down a little bit of a rabbit hole. But the reality is that you should consider market makers as doing the job of an amm, because ultimately you're just doing the same thing. But on a centralized exchange. And you do need the other side of the token. You do need like dollars to pair with it, not as many dollars because you don't have to provide the full liquidity. And just like lp it, you can, you know, place orders and cancel replace. But generally the tokens will come from the project and the dollars will, will come from the market maker.
00:33:51.390 - 00:34:35.904, Speaker A: So it's quite rare to get a dollar loan as well. Although it does happen occasionally, we do know that there are a couple services that I call software as a service that do market making in the sense it's in quotations because they're not actually taking any risk. So flow desk is probably the most well known of these, where they're more giving you their quoting software. And it's your own money, so you have to provide the dollars. And then if you lose money, which usually, you know, there's some kind of loss, it, it kind of goes to the project. So that's one option that not many projects are choosing these days. But if you don't want anyone else kind of having your tokens, you can just use the service.
00:34:35.904 - 00:34:36.192, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:36.216 - 00:34:51.664, Speaker B: So if you're getting a loan for, let's say, a million dollars of a token, and let's say the token just pumps to absurd levels, is it possible for a market maker to run out of tokens and actually lose money because they have to buy back at a higher price, or is that not really a thing? That usually happens.
00:34:51.752 - 00:35:14.074, Speaker A: Damn. The lads are coming with the great questions. So that's going to, that's going to lead us to another question, which is why are there call options? And it's for the reason you mentioned. The reason why there's call options is the way you should think about it. There is impermanent loss if the price moves up or down. If the price moves up, it's kind of like a good case scenario. The project's up a lot, they're making money.
00:35:14.074 - 00:35:56.240, Speaker A: So getting a call option where you can basically return dollars instead of tokens because you ran out of tokens, people just bought all your tokens is quite sensible. So the reason why there are these call options in crypto makes sense. I think in essence, when you're market making, you are also investing in the project. Like you have a similar distribution of outcomes. Where the project does well, then you have upside, you have a call option, you don't have to return tokens past a certain price. And if the project goes down only and it just keeps selling, you're just going to have to keep buying. Theoretically, if you're doing your job properly and you just lose money.
00:35:56.240 - 00:36:24.460, Speaker A: So if you choose a shitty project as a market maker, that's going to go down only, you lose money. And I guess shitty is not the right word. Like it could be a good project. Like we saw, you know, we talked about a couple episodes ago, some of the projects that are, you know, who do, who do we blame this for? Project like, that might be like a really large project, but as a market maker, you just have to like buy all the way down, and your strike prices are like three times out of the money. You're not going to make money, youre going to lose.
00:36:24.840 - 00:36:54.584, Speaker C: Well, I was actually going to ask about this, and maybe part of the answer is how the options are structured. But whats to stop a market maker that maybe theyre uncertain about the project or theyre just in it for the short term? Theyre not trying to build a real business here from selling a large portion on day one and then sort of de risking to the point where theyre not really putting the other side of the pair up. And so theyre not necessarily buying with fresh capital on the way down, but theyre just using the tokens they had sold on day one to provide the other side of the liquidity.
00:36:54.712 - 00:37:33.622, Speaker A: So, I mean, here is kind of where we come to the boogeyman theories that have some grain of truth to them. Let's kind of maybe ask the question of like, how do market makers make money? Because it's all around like this. It's like all incentives, right? So why are market makers providing the service they need to make money? You know that you have costs. You have obviously, like a lot of operational costs to deal with, and you're ahead, um, presumably like providing a white glove service. So you can make money in three ways. One is, um, cross exchange arbitrage. So if the tokens are selling at different prices and you have inventory, you make money.
00:37:33.622 - 00:38:14.104, Speaker A: This could be like Dex, sex arbitrage. It could be like different sexes. Um, that's one, like, good way to make money that I think is good for everybody, because you're sort of taking this mev out of the market and you're giving everybody a fair price, and it's just good for everybody, right? There's no loss there, so that's a good reason. And generally, good market making firms are the ones that trade everywhere. They're good at arbitrage, and they can kind of provide, like, the stability of the price. Another way that you make money is sometimes there's not a lot of spot out there and the funding rate goes negative. You can potentially, like, help bridge the gap between spot and perpendic.
00:38:14.104 - 00:38:50.060, Speaker A: So it's similar to the other case where you're doing cross exchange, but you're doing between spot and perp. So you can, you know, you see like, sometimes negative funding rates if there's not enough people that want to long perp. So you end up providing that service, you kind of long the perp and sell tokens and do this like delta hedge so you can make a little bit of funding rate. And then the third main way is like these call options. There's two ways to treat call options and different firms treat them differently. One is you treat them as a lottery ticket. So you just hold it at the end and if at the end it's in the money, then you know yay, you made money.
00:38:50.060 - 00:39:29.874, Speaker A: And great. The other way is you treat it as an asset on your balance sheet. You try to gamma kind of hedge the gamma. So you have an option. Every option has a certain volatility that you can imply and a certain strike price. So let's say that I have Justin Token and Justin Token is $100 and I have a call option for $120 and the volatility of Justin Token is like 50. I might calculate that I'm actually long out of the 100 units that I have, I might be like kind of gamma long 22 units.
00:39:29.874 - 00:39:54.088, Speaker A: So I might sell 22 units just to start, just to be like gamma hedgede. And then as the price goes up, I sell more and more and more and more. And as the price goes down I start buying more because I have this like gamma hedging. So some firms make money by doing this. I don't think it's necessarily bad. It does mean that you'll have some initial sell pressure. Ultimately you need your market maker to make money somehow.
00:39:54.088 - 00:40:06.070, Speaker A: Otherwise like they're not going to do a good job for you or be a good partner. So ideally there's arbitrage opportunities or a little bit of gamma is quite common.
00:40:06.190 - 00:40:29.922, Speaker B: I remember one time earlier this year, our previous co host laid out his world coin thesis where I think there was a call option on world coin at x dollars. And I think the thesis was, okay, well the market makers have an incentive to pump it above so they can make money. Is there any merit to this? Or is this some self fulfilling prophecy that traders just squeezing shorts and the market makers had nothing to do with it?
00:40:30.006 - 00:40:39.074, Speaker A: Yeah, so let's put up a clip of the CEO and what he said about this because he did make a public statement describing this.
00:40:39.202 - 00:41:27.078, Speaker D: The thing that the foundation wanted to achieve here is that essentially short term liquidity provisioning. So you have like a spike of interest and you want to make sure that a token price doesn't spike to like $10 or something, then crashes down again. Because then you have like a lot of unhappy people that lost money, which is something that we've seen historically a lot with, with a lot of projects. So the main, and I think it actually is pretty cool what kind of the Deakin team of the foundation came up with can we have this like linear increase in terms of supply they can emit? Exactly for that reason that if you have a huge spike in interest, you damp that and you make sure that the price doesn't spike, which that I think would have been a horrific outcome.
00:41:27.214 - 00:42:02.242, Speaker A: So let's talk about what Alex, the CEO of Worldcoin is talking about here. He's saying he gave call options to market makers so they could dump tokens above a certain level to avoid the price going too high because he didn't want anyone buying in too high. So that's understandable. Like you don't want to have, like we talked about what happens in some of the korean exchanges, you don't want to have people buying in the ten x, the fair price. It's not going to be good long term. And unfortunately the market is so inefficient that a lot of people buy without checking the price. They just market buy.
00:42:02.242 - 00:42:44.750, Speaker A: In essence, market makers are good to do that. In world coins case, I think they put strike prices around two to $3. And as the price went up, it was more and more tokens. Market makers make quite a lot of money just selling the tokens as they were going up. Good or bad, it's good for the market makers. They made a lot of money and that's probably why a lot of these random firms are not trading firms are trying to do market making because they hear about these rare but occasional cases of free money where world coin was a good example. There's many ways to treat this mev and who's getting the mev of people buying a price.
00:42:44.750 - 00:42:56.346, Speaker A: But yeah, commonly you'll have kind of market makers selling into those abnormal price events and that's part of the money they make.
00:42:56.458 - 00:43:20.208, Speaker C: I know you compete for these deals and I want to talk about sort of how you win the deals and what you're offered, what you have to offer in the SLA's. But maybe you can talk about how lucrative are these deals. Obviously it's a case by case basis, but like I on average, for an average size launch, let's say the project launches with a $1 billion FTV and you have a 1% call option on it. How lucrative are these deals? Can you speak to that a little bit?
00:43:20.304 - 00:43:55.780, Speaker A: Yeah. So it varies massively. And I would say the main parameters are like where are you in the cycle? The deals that were done last year. It's sort of like, again, it's very similar to VC. The vintage, like the 23 vintage is fantastic because everything, if you look like a year back, it is up a lot. But it means your strike prices, which were set at the time on the twaps or the expectations of 2023, they're in the money and great. That's probably why a lot of new market making firms appear.
00:43:55.780 - 00:44:38.964, Speaker A: The deals that were done in 24, especially after March, where altcoins have gone down as sticky warned everybody. A lot of firms have lost money and most market making firms are sort of bleeding nonstop on these deals. They were structured in a way that didn't really align incentives longer term and creates frustration for everybody. And one of the hopefully benefits of doing this episode is trying to explain to both sides like what's actually going on. Because, yeah, it's like who do we blame this for? Everyone is looking at the price. Is it the market maker is dumping. The market makers are pissed off because they're actually getting the, they're the ones getting dumped on.
00:44:38.964 - 00:44:47.820, Speaker A: They're the ones losing money. It's not like they're like the evil mastermind, like, you know, selling tokens. They're, they're the ones buying. So this is quite important to dig into.
00:44:47.940 - 00:44:53.582, Speaker C: So can you talk a little bit about more about the deal structure and then how you actually win these deals?
00:44:53.686 - 00:45:38.540, Speaker A: Yeah, so generally what happens is a project says, okay, we're going to do tge soon. We need exchanges and market makers like we went through like the main exchanges who they try to get. If you're super tier one project, you go for the big ones and you know, otherwise you, you go for like mid tier, then you go to market makers. It's a little bit similar wherever. You won't be able to get wintermute or Cellini if you're some tiny project that they haven't invested in because there's too many projects and they don't want to deal with constant requests from tiny projects. So it's good to think of it as the VC space. It's quite similar.
00:45:38.540 - 00:46:17.436, Speaker A: There's space for many market makers that serve different types of projects, different size of projects, different categories. You know, meme coins are obviously we're seeing like DWF do some meme coins. We're seeing this, this other one. If you go back to the players tab there, we've seen recently that some of the meme coins are going to got bit. I think they're doing some of these meme coins look like there's thousands of coins out there. And it's not like PvP or winner takes all when it comes to market making games. There's, there's too many projects for just to serve.
00:46:17.436 - 00:46:50.022, Speaker A: So you try to get a good market maker. You know, good is in the eye of the beholder. We can get into what, what good is for me, good means like you're actually providing liquidity and providing a service which you're supposed to be providing. They'll go to the market makers and ask them to give them quotes. Often there's some firms that chase the projects, so they'll just like harass the projects. There's a lot of those players that have like a 50 person bd team, just salespeople everywhere. Sometimes they use hot girls, sometimes, you know, not.
00:46:50.022 - 00:47:22.236, Speaker A: But either way, like they're just blasting projects constantly trying to get market making deals because that's how they get judged by their boss, right? So projects generally, depending on their size, will have a choice. They'll get a these option strikes these KPI's offered to them, and then they have to choose. I feel like generally they choose based on reputation, word of mouth. And then they'll sometimes try to compare some of these terms and try to get the most competitive terms.
00:47:22.388 - 00:47:27.484, Speaker C: And do usually projects sign with a couple different market makers, or just one generally.
00:47:27.612 - 00:48:03.636, Speaker A: So we've seen everywhere from one to like eight, which is crazy. I strongly suggest not doing that because it's just a mess. I think the absolute max for a huge project that makes sense is probably like five, where like one or two of them are doing on chain stuff. And so they're providing like different services. I would say most common by far is two for a smaller project and three for a large project. And that seems about right. Having a backup market maker who does other exchanges is good.
00:48:03.636 - 00:49:12.820, Speaker A: So like two is kind of, I think enough for almost all cases, but generally we're seeing two to three. Sometimes they go through intermediaries, and in terms of the current state of the market, we're seeing that something like coin watch, which is one of these intermediaries, that it used to be a data firm, or you could just look at market analytics and they've turned into, let's call it a advisor firm, like a consultant, where they try to get projects to pay them consulting fees to help them choose market makers and get good terms. This has created quite an interesting dynamic recently, where it's like a race to the bottom. These intermediaries will go to 40 firms and ask them to bid. If you're generally bidding for one of these deals. You might get feedback that, oh, you know, XYZ firm has given more competitive terms, or instead of asking for a $5 million loan that asks for 400k, you're kind of being pressured to match it or lose the deal. And this has created a bit of an unfortunate situation where the terms start not making sense.
00:49:12.820 - 00:49:30.422, Speaker A: The market makers lose money on them. They get pissed off. There's not enough tokens. The project's pissed off. You just get all kinds of mess. So I would say, like, right now, it's a little bit of a broken system when it comes to these intermediaries, and it's in the process of getting adjusted. I would say right now.
00:49:30.422 - 00:49:42.966, Speaker A: It's the first time that with a lot of the recent launches, we saw, like, zksync being, like, a prime example. There were no one, no one's. No one was really happy coming out of it. And in my opinion, a good market making deal is like a win win situation. It's not a lose lose.
00:49:43.038 - 00:49:53.440, Speaker C: So what's your suggestion? That if a project has an upcoming TGE doing well or just starting to get traction, what do you recommend they do if they don't use something like coin watch to get different bids?
00:49:53.780 - 00:50:41.932, Speaker A: I mean, even if they use or don't use, I think it's important to one choose partners that you like. You're going to be able to communicate with longer term partners that are incentivized to keep it simple. Really just keep it simple. Some of these, again, like, these intermediaries you have, they have to, like, fill out a form with, like, all these parameters that honestly just don't make any sense. They have, like, parameters of, like, what's the total exchange liquidity gonna be? Instead of, like, the actual, you know, how much are you showing as a, as a trading firm? They say, like, the entire exchange should have 2 million. Like, a lot of, like, really strange terms that didn't make sense. So keeping it simple, I think, is, is by far the most important thing.
00:50:41.932 - 00:51:16.208, Speaker A: The other thing is you can find partners that will help you in a lot of ways, because market makers, if they're trading firms and they're trading on all the exchanges and they're active on Defi, they can help you with liquidity on different chains. They can help you bridge things. They can give you feedback on your project. If it's a chain, they can run nodes. There's all kinds of activities that, in a deeper partnership, you can find. So I think, don't treat market makers as a hostile counterpart. Try to just work with them and make sure that it's a win win.
00:51:16.344 - 00:51:23.432, Speaker C: Jordy, can you walk us through the other components of the SLA's here of what other metrics you have to hit when you're providing liquidity?
00:51:23.536 - 00:51:51.176, Speaker A: Yeah, let's go through the list we talked about. Loan size. I think too small gives not enough tokens out there, and there's not enough upside. And too high is just unnecessary. We don't see these 5% duration. A year to two years is generally like, where you see it. I think two years is more like, you don't want to have to hassle with renewing the contract too often, so you just do two years, and one year is probably the minimum amount of time to turn these things over.
00:51:51.176 - 00:52:21.840, Speaker A: So we see 118 24. When it comes to strike prices, they'll usually be set on a t wap, vWap type of thing. Sometimes they'll refresh. So there will be like every six months, it'll go back to like, whatever is the current EMA. And I think it makes a lot of sense because the issue with strike prices, if you have like one or two year loans, the market can change drastically. And if you're. The ideal situation is your strike prices are relatively close to the price.
00:52:21.840 - 00:52:54.090, Speaker A: If they're like two, three x away, it's as if they don't exist. Like there's no protection. Like the market can just go up two x and you have no protection. Conversely, if you're already way above the strike price, you can just sell your tokens. So I think having resetting strike prices every three to six months is a good thing. It's not common, but I think it's a good way to do it. And sometimes firms will want specific FTV strike prices.
00:52:54.090 - 00:53:27.900, Speaker A: It's generally based off of, like, their previous raise, plus, like some premium. Like, if they raise a $200 million, they might want like a $400 million fixed. I think that that can work sometimes. It just depends, though, you're a little bit beholden to market conditions, because market can be like sentimentally way above or way below, like a fixed fdv uptime. I think that's pretty understandable. It's just like, you know, how. What percentage of the time are you in the market? And generally, like 95%, I think is like a pure minimum to be there.
00:53:28.280 - 00:53:43.140, Speaker C: This raises an interesting question, though. Like, maybe people are wondering, there's obviously not salini employees on binance or whatever exchange actively trading. So how is this actually managed? How are you guaranteeing 98% plus uptime.
00:53:43.840 - 00:54:29.250, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, any serious trading firm will have everything systematically done. It'll throw an alert if something happens, you will get out of the market. If the price suddenly spikes 100% and doubles or goes down 50%, you'll get stopped out on all your positions and somebody will have to manually put it back in so you'll be out. A serious trading firm also has 24/7 coverage so you can keep up time high and deal with any issues. Let's get into a really interesting one. Reporting. You say you do certain uptime, you're going to do certain KPI's, you're going to show some, you know, x amount of size, $100,000, you know, within 2%, 1%, 50 bps, whatever it is.
00:54:29.250 - 00:55:11.534, Speaker A: How do people know if you're actually doing it versus just saying you're doing it? And this is kind of like where reporting comes in. It's generally like self reporting. You're saying that yesterday or last week, depending if it's daily or weekly. Here's what actually happened. We traded this much and we were showing this much size. There's a wide range of market making firms that are not really doing the market making. And the reporting doesn't actually show much apart from market statistics like, oh, the price range was from five dollars to six dollars yesterday and the market volume was this.
00:55:11.534 - 00:56:00.004, Speaker A: That usually means they're not doing much. If you see full KPI's then hopefully they're doing it. There might be some smaller firms that are willing to lie and just make up numbers, but for a serious firm, the reputation damage is keeping them very accurate on these things. And you never want to have a false report go out. Generally, if you really need to check, there's ways to, you know, switch off, switch back on this kind of stuff so you can, you can get it before and after snapshot. But I think reporting is non standardized right now in the space and is usually a sign of the credibility of who you're dealing with. And then, you know, we talked a little bit about this pre show.
00:56:00.004 - 00:57:00.060, Speaker A: We got, we got the other category. I have heard of unnamed three letter firms and stuff offering all kinds of things like profit shares, kickbacks, or price management. I think we saw the article before, volume management generally, if it's a really small illiquid coin and you want to generate momentum, so called momentum ignition, which is something that's illegal in traditional finance, you know, given how decentralized the space is, you might find somebody out there willing to do it and like manage price or like, you know, activity for you. So, you know, this stuff still happens. I think the profit sharing is a. Is a. It's like a fine line because, you know, if somebody does an introduction, it's quite common in the real world to give them a commission, right? Like, you sell a house, you get like some commission of the sale kind of aligns incentives and introductions.
00:57:00.060 - 00:57:55.140, Speaker A: That's generally like something that is okay and aligned. I think what we see sometimes that's not aligned is like founders get not founders. It could be like BD, people get bribed. Those people generally get found out and fired or think things happen. But I would say that this kind of stuff still goes on from what we hear. And the last thing is extras, like, what else? What else are you doing apart from just providing some KPI's, which you could call it the vanilla? Are you giving feedback chain, TVL market color, helping with listings and giving advice? Are you doing technical integrations? Are you helping with OTC? There's a lot of other things that generally a market maker can try to do, but these won't be on a contract. These will be sort of like bespoke and trying to be a good partner.
00:57:55.600 - 00:58:00.352, Speaker C: Before we move on to the next piece, is there anything you think we missed or anything you wanted to cover in particular?
00:58:00.496 - 00:58:49.760, Speaker A: I mean, I guess you guys did ask a little bit about how do you make money? There's also ways like, you lose money. And this is why I kind of find it comical that random firms are providing market making services where in essence, they're just trying to get call options and just get this, like free money. As we saw in the world coin case, if you're doing your job properly and you're quoting a certain amount of size, you can lose a lot of money. Especially if there's a sudden announcement or there's a hack and somebody moves money and just suddenly crashes the price. All kinds of stuff obviously happens in crypto. If you're the one providing quotes, both sided and the market moves a lot, you're losing money, especially if it's down. We talked about the call options kind of protecting you on the way up, but on the way down, there's no protection.
00:58:49.760 - 00:59:24.666, Speaker A: So if there's unlocks happening and it's a VC project, sometimes the project will try to strategize and be like, look, there's a sudden cliff coming. Just to be aware. There's going to be a lot of supply coming into the market, give you a heads up. Sometimes you just get dumped on and you have to absorb a lot of tokens, and you end up owning so much of the supply that you can't do anything with it. And also, the project's pissed off with you because they think market makers should determine the price. So this is.
00:59:24.778 - 00:59:52.024, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to say maybe this is a good. Another bogeyman question, but, like, from a regulatory perspective, is there any coordination between the project and the market maker that goes on behind the scenes? Like, let's just use Worldcoin because they're massive. If Worldcoin is about to announce that chat, GBT and Worldcoin integrating are some big bullish news, do they go to the market maker and say, we're announcing this at 08:00 a.m. eastern time. As a heads up, do what you will with that information or make your liquidity. Is there.
00:59:52.152 - 01:00:38.216, Speaker A: There's a range of projects that treat themselves as public equities versus projects that are offshore in Asia and don't really have as much concern versus, like, meme coins, where it's just like, you know, some Degen anon made the coin, and then he's just like, telling you, like, hey, we're about to pump it or whatever. So if we're dealing with like a, you know, a large tier one project, and they have a foundation, and the founders don't even want to talk to anybody. Cause they don't want to be accused of market manipulation. So then you're talking to the foundation only. There's generally, like, not a lot of communication there. And the foundation generally has some chinese wall, so they're not especially sharing a lot of information. So you're kind of in the dark.
01:00:38.216 - 01:00:44.640, Speaker A: And, yeah, it's not that common to get a heads up on things, actually.
01:00:44.800 - 01:01:09.330, Speaker C: And maybe a good segue before we get into pasta. This article broke that a couple different market making firms, including Cellini, are looking at acquiring DyDX's v three software, since moved to v four. But can you talk a little bit? Like, are a lot of different market makers trying to sort of vertically integrate across the board here? Is this something more unique you're seeing? And what would be the motivation for you guys actually acquiring this technology?
01:01:09.830 - 01:02:05.984, Speaker A: This is market makers in the first sense we talked about originally, which is like exchange market making as opposed to token market making. So these are actual firms are providing liquidity on the DyDX Dex, not the tokenization. So it is kind of weird, right? Like, we saw Alameda have FTX, and that created all kinds of good and bad situations. You know, they bootstrapped their own liquidity, and then they had issues. We've seen Kronos with Wu, which eventually, like, Wu has managed to, you know, decentralize, you could call it, in the sense of like, opening up to other market makers. And so it's not uncommon, unfortunately, like, something I don't like at all about the space is that some of the asian exchanges have internal market makers, and they don't allow anyone to really quote on their platform. So in essence, they treat their customer as like the fish at the table.
01:02:05.984 - 01:02:40.260, Speaker A: So they're playing poker, the house is playing poker against the player, instead of just let the players play against themselves and just charge her impartial rake. So some of the exchanges do that, especially in Asia. So it's not uncommon. We've seen also, like, trading firms kind of pivot. Like hyper liquid used to be a trading firm, and they sort of like, pivoted to building a product. And that's totally okay. You know, they kind of built a vault and just let other people lp into it instead of trading themselves.
01:02:40.260 - 01:03:08.714, Speaker A: In this specific case with DyDX, the news that broke, I can't comment too much. It's just like this ongoing thing. But basically, DyDX has their new product, which is V four. They've decentralized, they're on chain. It's their evolution is the V four product. However, V three is still being used and still alive, and actually has no incentives, there's no tokens, and still has revenue. So it's a decent business.
01:03:08.714 - 01:03:53.040, Speaker A: And I think DyDX is in the spot where they just want to focus on what they're building, which is like this decentralized on chain app chain. And meanwhile, they have a money making business that they want to shut off. But it's valuable. So I think there's the idea of having it continue to live by some other management, some other buyers, and I mean us, we're not looking to run it or get involved at all in the operations. That would be a headache. It makes sense to have ownership stake, just like every trading firm on CME has board seats on CME and has equity of CME. In fact, you kind of need to have it to get trading fees.
01:03:53.040 - 01:04:15.286, Speaker A: So this is just trad five playing itself all over again. It makes sense for the people who are providing liquidity to be aligned with the equity of the exchange. All right, well, we're still going to do a pasta of the week, even though it's been an evergreen type of episode. I have a good one. I don't know about you guys, mine's okay.
01:04:15.358 - 01:04:21.062, Speaker C: Okay. Not as strong as last week. I mean, last week I lost when I should have won, so, I don't know, I kind of gave up.
01:04:21.086 - 01:04:23.170, Speaker B: This week, I got rugged by Charles.
01:04:24.990 - 01:04:27.090, Speaker A: Well, thank you. Maybe you can kick off.
01:04:27.590 - 01:04:50.814, Speaker B: Yeah. So I thought it was fitting, given it's a market making episode. And I remember Danny Sesta. Last cycle, he made this application called Popsicle finance, which was kind of this UneV three liquidity manager token. Pumped a lot, and then it just dumped a lot. But it seems like Danny, he's trying to become relevant again. And he mentioned the July 23 post.
01:04:50.814 - 01:05:04.730, Speaker B: After months of testing and figuring out how to launch a meme coin fairly, we got it. Soon. TM on the right network and right below it, he literally retweeted this post. Can you play this, Justin? I just thought it was so funny.
01:05:05.310 - 01:05:12.410, Speaker C: Is it a Ponzi? Well, I guess depends on your perspective.
01:05:13.950 - 01:05:30.622, Speaker B: So I was like, he retweeted this post saying that his projects were a Ponzi, and now he's saying, hey, we're about to launch a fair meme coin. I was like, the juxtaposition was uncanny. So that was. My boss thought that. That's hilarious.
01:05:30.806 - 01:05:49.780, Speaker A: You know, Daniela, that takes me back. He ended up being a bit of a mafioso, but I have to admit that I like that he was. He wasn't in that clip. He's not even wanting to say, like, it depends on your perspective. He's like, yeah, it is. Does it depends, like, no, no, it's a Ponzi, sure.
01:05:50.080 - 01:05:57.256, Speaker C: But he is. He's, like, a good Ponzi architect. Like, when he launches that meme coin, I mean, there's gonna be a lot of interest, and I think it could do well. We'll see.
01:05:57.408 - 01:06:23.630, Speaker A: No, I mean, he's not talking about launching a meme coin. He's saying about, like, a launch. Padded. And, you know, when it comes to fair launchpad for meme coins, you do want to avoid sniping bots, but you also know that there's always going to be insiders because someone's launching it, and the insiders are going to want a certain amount of allocation for themselves. So, yeah, let's see what he has in mind. But, Daniela, that's a pretty good one. Justin.
01:06:23.630 - 01:06:24.198, Speaker A: Justin.
01:06:24.254 - 01:06:43.242, Speaker C: Yeah, so, my pasta actually comes from my co founder. Shout out to Joe. So, I'll give a little backstory. After playing this clip. This. This tweet went absolutely viral on Twitter. I think it's, like, one of the most seen posts from Twitter, that from crypto, that has sort of expanded to three and a half million views, which is kind of crazy, but I'll play this.
01:06:43.242 - 01:06:59.244, Speaker C: This is Joe's house. DeLong, he said that he did not.
01:06:59.292 - 01:07:01.000, Speaker A: Call united the country.
01:07:04.140 - 01:07:17.900, Speaker C: So if you guys hear in the. On the radio, you can hear them saying they just got off with Joe DeLong. He's actually not even in the country. You see the big burly cop trying to bash down in the door, just throws the hammer down. Fuck. And walks away. Just.
01:07:17.900 - 01:07:47.880, Speaker C: He was just so jacked up to get in there, guns drawn. But the backstory of what happened is actually really scary and not great. So Joe got swatted. If you don't know, swatting is sort of when someone, you know, calls in, they find your address, they dox you, and they call in something happening at your house and basically send the police. And I guess this person actually tried to ransom Joe for a sum of money to not get swatted. Joe ignored the message, and unfortunately, they actually did come. The cops.
01:07:47.880 - 01:08:03.666, Speaker C: Fortunately, Joe was out of the country and out of town and nothing here when this happened. But what got people really excited was he had, like, a really heavy metal door. I've been to his house. It's like a pretty substantial door. And I guess this door, you know, he's bringing some business there to DoMA.
01:08:03.698 - 01:08:12.274, Speaker A: That is an epic door. When Sari met Halle and the girls, like, I'll have what she's having.
01:08:12.402 - 01:08:13.070, Speaker C: When.
01:08:14.090 - 01:08:19.910, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. When Harry met Sally. I want the door that he's having. I mean, that is. That is epic.
01:08:20.220 - 01:08:26.612, Speaker C: Yeah. So just a crazy post. I was talking to him as this was happening and pretty scary. So stay safe out there, everyone.
01:08:26.796 - 01:09:00.852, Speaker A: Well, you know, I have a. I have a Gordie pasta to wrap up, which our previous guest, Cordy Gord, he's always showing these bangers. And so we had the bitcoin convention coming up, and Trump is going to talk. And Kamala was thinking about talking, decided not to, and Gord explained why. Here's the reason why she backed out. Kamala just didn't feel comfortable speaking to bitcoiners until they addressed the security budget. You know, I've been saying this for a while until they sort out this tail emissions or what's going to happen once the emissions go down.
01:09:00.852 - 01:09:06.348, Speaker A: So Kamala is not comfortable speaking at the bitcoin conference, guys. That's why that's funny.
01:09:06.444 - 01:09:23.069, Speaker C: You know, one narrative, like, we haven't heard in forever, but, like, I wonder if this plays apart from her team. Is the environmental perspective. Like, bitcoin uses so much energy, it's not just not good for the environment. Like, I wonder if that's a component, too. Maybe she'll come to an ethereum conference. Maybe she'll be at the next ECC.
01:09:24.889 - 01:09:30.705, Speaker A: Does anybody talk about the environmental thing anymore? I haven't heard that in, like, not at all. I feel like it's crazy.
01:09:30.737 - 01:09:37.829, Speaker C: It just went away, right? First blackrock launches the ETF, and then, boom, environmental concerns out the window.
01:09:38.169 - 01:09:48.359, Speaker A: I mean, Elon was the one saying that he was going to stop it until environmental thing gets sorted out. Maybe. Maybe he'll start rebuying. I don't know.
01:09:48.779 - 01:09:49.883, Speaker C: You never know.
01:09:50.051 - 01:09:51.119, Speaker B: You never know.
01:09:51.939 - 01:10:04.867, Speaker A: Cool. All right, guys, well, thank you for joining. Hopefully this has been a helpful episode, and we'll see you next week with regularly scheduled programming. Take care.
01:10:05.043 - 01:10:05.379, Speaker C: Bye, everyone.
