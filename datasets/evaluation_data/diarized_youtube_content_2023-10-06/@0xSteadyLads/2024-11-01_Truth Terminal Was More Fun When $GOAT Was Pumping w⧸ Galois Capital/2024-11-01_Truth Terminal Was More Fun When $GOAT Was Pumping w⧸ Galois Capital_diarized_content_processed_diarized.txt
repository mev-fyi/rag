00:00:00.400 - 00:00:24.205, Speaker A: I think, and not just facetiously, that Vitalik should come on Steady Lads, but he, like, really should, right, because, like, at the end of the day, like, you know, there's always the sentiment with the eth crowd, like on Farcaster and stuff, that they're, like, kind of in this research ivory tower, right? They spend all their time drawing boxes and mines, basically, right. And they really need to come and talk with us retards and degens, right? They need to come and talk to the people.
00:00:24.505 - 00:00:26.165, Speaker B: If that's what people.
00:00:27.065 - 00:00:47.731, Speaker A: I think it's totally fine. If they. If they really have conviction that what they're doing is correct, right? And they don't need feedback from, you know, us degens and retards, that's okay, too. But then they can't complain about short term price action. If they're right in the long term, they'll win, and then the short term, and then the short term, they'll just have to suffer pain, Right? But if they care about the short term at all, they need to come talk to people, so. I totally agree. They need to come and tell you, that's for sure.
00:00:47.803 - 00:00:58.135, Speaker C: You know, Vitalik sort of reminds me of Kamala Harris dodging Joe Rogan. Just thinking, you know, we're just friendly guys, the three of us. We just want to talk to him, get to know him anymore. We're not going to grill him too hard.
00:01:18.655 - 00:01:26.255, Speaker B: Welcome, everybody. Steady, lads. We have Justin with us, the. The meme coin hater, as he's known now in this, and the meme coin.
00:01:26.295 - 00:01:28.915, Speaker C: Master, some might know me as. But that's okay.
00:01:29.415 - 00:01:35.095, Speaker B: Okay, okay. We'll get into that. Maybe. So Taiki the goat lover is here.
00:01:36.235 - 00:01:37.895, Speaker D: Love the goatsy gospel.
00:01:39.715 - 00:01:49.019, Speaker B: The preacher of the gospel. And we have Kevin with us, the warrior of the Roman Empire. How are you, Kevin? Good to see you. It's been a while.
00:01:49.147 - 00:01:51.891, Speaker A: It has been a while. No, thanks for having me. It's been good.
00:01:51.963 - 00:02:11.031, Speaker B: So for our viewers who were not. We're in a cave. Last cycle, Twitter handle Galois Capital was the one battling with the Do Kwon legions over on Twitter until they finally succumbed to his. To his power. Are those. Are those days memorable?
00:02:11.103 - 00:02:11.407, Speaker A: Do you.
00:02:11.431 - 00:02:14.847, Speaker B: Do you still look fondly upon those. Those battles, Kevin?
00:02:14.951 - 00:02:27.357, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, I remember being in the trenches with you. Jordy, too, you know, but. But I just want to say, you know, off the bat that I didn't cause anything to happen. That thing was, like, doomed from the beginning, you know, So I just want to, you know, just clarify that.
00:02:27.461 - 00:02:54.555, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree Kevin. I think the. The mechanism, as I've tried to explain since, is basically one where the. The people just kept, you know, minting Luna, and it was not being backed by the amount that it was being mint by, and that was eventually going to kind of crash. I still think it was such a. Interesting approach you took with this, like, mythology approach is this. And I've seen you potentially look at doing that again.
00:02:54.555 - 00:03:04.195, Speaker B: Are you a believer in creating culture and creating, like, these, like, vivid storylines? And do you see that in, like, these meme coins now, or.
00:03:04.355 - 00:03:34.813, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, you know, to some degree. I mean, for me, it was mostly just, you know, everybody just has ADD on Twitter anyway, right? So you got to, like, hold people's attention. So I thought that would be a good way to do it. And, you know, plus, I'm a big history buff, especially when it comes to the Roman Empire. But I think, for me, I think the PvP days are kind of over because I, you know, I have a feeling that we might be getting into a bull run soon. So, you know, bull runs are normally marked by everybody kind of coming together, working together, and then, like, bear markets are just, like, everybody's margins are getting squeezed. Competition is tight.
00:03:34.813 - 00:04:11.405, Speaker A: Everything gets a little ugly. It's very PvP. So I think, you know, the right mentality for the right, you know, part of the cycle. And then, you know, just on top of that, I feel like, you know, that was such a, you know, and I think you were there, too, right, Jordi and, like, you know, GCR and, like, all these guys, right? Like Monet and, you know, Freddie Reynolds, all those. These guys. And I just feel like that whole thing was just a very thankless job, you know, because you're just getting a lot of hate from a lot of different places, and then finally you're vindicated, and then, you know, everybody wants to talk to you, right? But it's just, like, whole thing just, like, reeks of, you know, that. That kind of, like, very populist, kind of, like, popularity contest.
00:04:11.405 - 00:04:20.763, Speaker A: And, you know, I think for the most part, you know, those fighting days are kind of over. I kind of want to just, like, chill, you know, a little bit and just, like, you know, maybe do some, like, venture investments and stuff.
00:04:20.819 - 00:04:40.443, Speaker B: So if you were gonna, you know, take the Spears back on for. For one last Roman Empire battle, is there something right now in the space that you might target? You don't have to start the war, but, like, theoretically, is there something out there that you kind of feel like, oh, if I. If I was younger, you know, I.
00:04:40.459 - 00:05:15.721, Speaker A: Would, I would go, well, you know, there's definitely coins out there that I think are gonna go down and that they're not good for the space. But I would say two things. Like, one is just that, you know, like nothing is like super egregious, right? Like, because like Luna and ust it was like double digit billions by then. You know, there's nothing like that. Like right now there's at least nothing that reflexive on the downside. And then like on top of that it's like, you know, it's just I'm a bit tired. You know, it's just I don't really want to do it again, really.
00:05:15.833 - 00:05:26.377, Speaker B: Eric Wall, last week he was trying to, you know, fud bit tensor and explain why this is, this is not going to work. And pretty sure his Twitter replies are full of them now.
00:05:26.561 - 00:05:39.009, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, I kind of agree with Eric, but it's still not big enough that it's like a real problem. Problem. Right. Like if, if me and Eric are right, then it'll just go down and if we're wrong, then it'll just go up. Right. But there's no real like systemic risk here.
00:05:39.057 - 00:05:50.377, Speaker D: Yeah. I have a question for you, Kevin, because I think this is the first podcast you've done in a year or two, right? So what have you been up to the past couple of years? And I heard you have a funny story to share with us though. Can you.
00:05:50.561 - 00:06:17.975, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. So, you know, just, you know, these days, you know, after the whole FTX collapse, it was really terrible for us. And then, you know, I'm sure you guys read about the settlement that we did with the SEC afterwards. So, you know, I've been mostly pretty on the quieter side. And then the operating companies that we had, we basically fire sold them to an acquirer. I can't really say who it is, but we're basically working for the acquirer right now. And you know, most of the team went over, maybe about half the team went over.
00:06:17.975 - 00:07:09.897, Speaker A: And then also on top of that, I'm basically working on my family office right now, so looking forward to being a humble farmer and retired to, you know, till the land and that's. But yeah, I have actually a funny story about Thicky and you know, so I'm friends with Vicky and you know, if you guys remember, there was like one point where, you know, right before the investors unlocked for like World Coin. Right. Like both us and them were like short World Coin. Right. And you know, and then like there's this huge sort squeeze going into it, right? So we're looking at his BYBIT account and we're looking at it and we're like, oh, this guy's taking some pretty big losses. So I wonder if he's like Short World coin like us, right? And then we're looking at our position, right? And it's pretty painful.
00:07:09.897 - 00:07:52.791, Speaker A: But our liquidation point is pretty high, right? So I'm not too concerned about it. But then I was thinking, man, but all these guys are short wolfcoin, right? Going into this unlock, so what if they get liquidated and then there's just like a prints like this candle and liquidates us, right? It's like a liquidation cascade know that could be like super dangerous, right? So then I go like, hit up thicky, right? And like, yo, dude, are you like Short World coin, Like what's going on over there? You know? And he's like. And he, I, I think he was like a little bit suspicious. So he was like really cagey about stuff, you know what I mean? So I think, I think he thought that we were on the other side, that we were squeezing him, right? But like, we were just in the same boat as him. We were losing money too, you know, so, you know, it was just super funny. And then he, he was like, he was like telling me all sorts of about, oh, his liquidation was like super, super high. I'm like, I don't know, man.
00:07:52.791 - 00:08:07.205, Speaker A: Looking at this P and L chart, I don't know, it could be a little bit lower. You know what I mean? Worried. Because I'm worried he's going to wash me out, right? So like, that's what I'm worried about, right? But he's worried that I'm squeezing him, right? So it was just like a, it was like a funny situation over there.
00:08:07.625 - 00:08:13.673, Speaker B: For, for all the kids at home. This is, this is your explanation for why it's not too short.
00:08:13.769 - 00:08:14.513, Speaker C: Wait, Kevin.
00:08:14.609 - 00:08:14.833, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:14.849 - 00:08:16.577, Speaker C: So what happened? So what happened?
00:08:16.601 - 00:08:19.833, Speaker B: In the end, Suzu squeezed them and liquidated them. What do you mean?
00:08:19.889 - 00:08:30.765, Speaker A: Remember? Oh, so that's who it was. It was sue, huh? Oh, man. But, but I, I don't know what happened to him, but like, we were fine, basically. You know, we took some losses though. But we did take some losses.
00:08:30.885 - 00:08:54.155, Speaker B: Yeah. The mechanic of that. So let's say like you short at two bucks, right? And then it starts ripping for like three bucks and you're like, okay, we're down like 50%. How did you. Because eventually it went down to, you know, $1 50. But is it like you're just like happy to get out for at like 250 or 220 or like how mechanically, just out of curiosity, do you handle that situation?
00:08:54.495 - 00:09:21.689, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it depends on the timing. Right. Because like once the unlocks actually happen, there's physical coin that come onto the market and a lot of these investors, the cost basis is so low that at least some of them will sell. Right. So you'll get some relief there. But I guess the kind of calculation there is whether or not you think that between then and now and then that it's going to continue going up, at which point you're better off closing and maybe even going long, you know, for the short term or you think that. Or maybe you like if your size is too big, maybe you just have to hold through it.
00:09:21.689 - 00:09:42.921, Speaker A: Right. So there's like sizing considerations. There's also considerations of how much time is left for it to go up or down. But I think like you should always just kind of reevaluate the situation once you're in it and then like, you know, not kind of get married to your position. Right. But at the same time, you know, maybe your position is good and not just also to be like super weak about it and then just puke it out, you know, and then just completely lose conviction either. Right.
00:09:42.921 - 00:09:52.523, Speaker A: So it's just kind of like synthesizing the reasons that you got into the position in the first place with all of the new information coming in. And I think that's like the best that you can do. And it's like kind of like on a case by case basis.
00:09:52.619 - 00:10:12.923, Speaker D: Yeah. So I guess talking about shorts, I think the big unlock that happened recently was Celestia, so Chris Berniski's boat posting on the timeline and I think Dickie and co, they're all short. So are you playing the celestial unlock? Like what do you think happens here? Do you think it's going to just keep going down, everything is overvalued or what's your read on the situation?
00:10:13.059 - 00:10:49.093, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm happy to share my thought, but I also want to hear your guys thought on this because this is something that I'm actively talking about with the team. And you know, I think it's actually a bit unfortunate because it was a trade that we could have caught. Right. Because it only started going down maybe about like six or seven days ago. And you know, usually when, when there's like an eminent unlock that's very big, usually, you know, starts going down beforehand. Right. So like, you know, I Think maybe what it is is that everybody's so caught up in this meta, you know, with like all the AI coins and all of the, you know, meme coins that people like stopped looking at the unlock trade, which, you know, kind of stopped working for a while, right.
00:10:49.093 - 00:11:25.355, Speaker A: There were, there were some times where you know, these unlocked trades were kind of bullish and people got punished for. And then, you know, this one came about. I think people were a little bit shy about it and maybe that's why it took, you know, one week is just not, not a very long time, right? So, you know, that's why, you know, I think it took a while for people to start piling into it. And then now at this point, you know, the price has been suppressed so much that I'm actually trying to look for a long, but maybe, maybe a lower prices. Because I was thinking something like one of my guys who was doing some analysis and he was looking at like how much like would people actually sell, like who are the investors, you know, that sort of thing. And we're thinking something like, you know, maybe at like 3.8, maybe like 4, 3.9,
00:11:25.355 - 00:11:50.149, Speaker A: something like that just go along. But maybe not, maybe, maybe earlier than that. You know, if everybody was shorting needs to cover, then there's at least going to be some relief over there. So it kind of depends a little bit on the price action, right? Because I imagine like some people just get bored, you know, if the price doesn't go down enough, you know, after the unlock happens, maybe then they just cover their shorts, you know, something like that. But it's always hard to say. We just playing it by here, but yeah. Curious to hear what you guys think about this whole TIA thing.
00:11:50.237 - 00:11:58.629, Speaker D: Yeah, for me, I've been staking my Celestia for close to a year now. So I'm the ex liquidity where the investor.
00:11:58.757 - 00:11:59.505, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:12:00.525 - 00:12:03.453, Speaker D: So I'm hoping you buy my bag so I can dump it on you.
00:12:03.549 - 00:12:08.415, Speaker A: Okay, okay, I'll buy you guys, you can dump it on me. But lower prices, lower prices, lower prices.
00:12:08.455 - 00:12:27.359, Speaker C: Okay, Kevin, in your experience, like how. How do these things generally get priced in? Maybe you could just talk a little bit to that of like what a month out from an unlock looks like up until the unlock date. And then usually what happens on the unlock date is not what people are expecting. That's sort of what I've noticed that you and Jordy and Taiki have all been talking about. So maybe you could just give an overview of how that looks.
00:12:27.487 - 00:13:33.171, Speaker A: Yeah. So what I would say is that everything's kind of on a case by case basis and how priced in it gets really depends on, you know, a bunch of different factors, right? Like how big the unlock is, how expected is it, right? And how much shenanigans you think there's going to be like right before the unlock, right? Because a lot of these token prizes, what they do is they like try to match up like good news to come out with the unlock, right? And then try and like get, give some muddle signals to the market. So you have to be a little bit careful with shenanigans or like pushing back the investor unlock. They're like, oh psych. The actual unlock is like, you know, two months from now or we're just going to change the schedule or whatnot, right? So you also always have to be a little bit careful about that. And then you can kind of see what the pre positioning is, right? Because you just like look at like OI for example and then you know, you can see like whether or not people are already really positioned for it. And then, you know, I think on top of that it's like who are the holders of it, right? Like you can kind of do an analysis, like a cohort analysis of all the different VCs and there are some are just way more likely to dump and some that are like way less likely to dump, right? And they're, they like some of these guys have played much more longer term games, some are much more shorter term.
00:13:33.171 - 00:14:30.127, Speaker A: So you can kind of see like, and then you can see like the different series that they got in like seed series, a pre seed, all that stuff. And you can see like if they're above water, below water, you know, that sort of thing. I think in general when it comes to like trading news, one thing that matters is like whether or not the, the thing that's coming out. If it's like known uncertainty or if it's like unknown uncertainty, right? So like to give you like an example there, like, you know, we don't know, let's say like, you know, we're like a couple months ago, we don't know if the Fed is gonna cut by like, you know, 25bps or 50bps. But we do know that on this day they will make that announcement, right? So that's kind of like a known unknown, right? Like people are always already pre positioning for what they think the Fed is gonna do as opposed to something like the ripple lawsuit which came out and kind of blindsided everybody when ripple kind of like beat the sec. On, you know, this one, on that one particular ruling or case and that like nobody was really prepared for. So then something like that might take a little bit longer to price in.
00:14:30.127 - 00:14:39.223, Speaker A: And maybe that's not as much a sell the news event. While things that are a lot more expected, you know, maybe a lot more like buy the rumor kind of sell the news. Right. But it's just all, it's all kind of like case by case.
00:14:39.359 - 00:15:11.685, Speaker B: Yeah, it's case by case. I agree with Kevin. I'm very familiar with Celestia in particular. It's something that we've been actively trading, did quite well on. I think a lot of the secondary brokerages made a lot of money because there was a huge amount of demand for hedging because just the size of this thing was so big and a lot of the investors were up so much. When you have that combination investor up a hundred x and like huge unlock, there's generally a lot of secondaries going around for people just to sell their unlock. We bought a bunch of that stuff.
00:15:11.685 - 00:15:19.625, Speaker B: I think other people did as well. Then you kind of like figure out how to hedge and what you want to do exactly around that period.
00:15:19.745 - 00:15:33.845, Speaker C: Taking that into account. Jordy, if, if most insiders or the large holders, the large investors are hedging before the unlock, is that net bullish? Right. There's all this activity pricing in like instant sell pressure. But actually that sell pressure has already been realized.
00:15:34.505 - 00:15:52.729, Speaker B: It's, it's net neutral. It just sort of smooths out the curve. It gets a lot of the selling. Over the last week, like we've seen it just sell off from six bucks to like 450. And then when the actual unlock happens, this is like nice to see. It's just all normal. Nothing else happens because it's just people unwinding the hedges.
00:15:52.729 - 00:16:27.821, Speaker B: The funding rate is the key. When it gets super negative, it means that too many shorts are demanding hedging. There's a demand for hedging so high that it just forces the funding to be negative. Now we see it completely normalized, which means that there's a lot of spot. It's out there. People are just slowly unwinding their, their per spot positions and that's not a risk to the market and doesn't create any, any problems because the funding rate turns positive because they're spot selling and that's fine. I think depending on when you hedged, you might have done quite well.
00:16:27.821 - 00:16:48.153, Speaker B: Some people hedged at six bucks for five bucks and then, you know, ends up being 450. So everybody makes money. The hedgers make money. They make money. The only people losing money are the people who believe the, the VC tweets about like, you know, you should buy this is like so cheap. And don't worry about unlocks. I, I think those are borderline.
00:16:48.153 - 00:16:54.161, Speaker B: Yeah, just, just it's, it's kind of unethical to be tweeting before an unlock about, about a project, in my opinion.
00:16:54.273 - 00:17:01.409, Speaker A: So Jordy, what you're saying is that the VCs don't have our best interests in mind. Really? Blasphemy.
00:17:01.457 - 00:17:31.509, Speaker B: I'll, I'll end, I'll end with this because I have been quite public about this problem with the forward curve being so negative and what an issue it is when it comes to unlocks. I think the only tokens that should not get unlocked from day one are conditional tokens. A team. Like for example, if you're an employee, you get a four year vest. If you leave in two years, then you lose the tokens. It makes sense. You should be vested and then those should unlock as you work.
00:17:31.509 - 00:17:57.073, Speaker B: But if you're always getting the tokens and it's just a matter of time, there's no way you're going to lose the tokens. You have to like do something to get them, then you should get them right away. There's no reason to stagger them to align incentives, whatever. And I think Andrew Kang said it very nicely, which is like if the VCs wanted to sell day one, then you know that's going to hurt their reputation anyway. Like they're not going to do that anyway. Like there's reasons why they wouldn't do that stuff.
00:17:57.129 - 00:18:10.557, Speaker C: So as someone that's getting close to launching a token, one thing I'll say is there is a very strong mandate in the US that you at least have to lock people up for one year as sort of of like the minimum duration. But that's if you, you can abide by that and unlock ever and after one year, for example.
00:18:10.661 - 00:18:22.973, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely agree. I think, you know, and Andrew King is spot on there, at least for the investors. It should just be unlocked on day one. But you know, maybe for employees and founders, maybe a bit longer. You know, that kind of makes sense.
00:18:22.989 - 00:18:23.357, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:23.461 - 00:18:46.151, Speaker A: But yeah, I definitely agree. And I also agree with your, your, your point, Jordy, about that. Overall, it's kind of like a net neutral effect with the OTC edging. I actually think it's really interesting the position that Taran is in at Styx because he gets to see a Lot of this kind of flow, which is very opaque, I think to the rest of us. But yeah, I'm sure he's seeing all sorts of hedging and people selling atc.
00:18:46.263 - 00:18:49.951, Speaker D: Yeah, Maybe we can have Taran on the show one time.
00:18:50.103 - 00:18:50.727, Speaker A: That would be cool.
00:18:50.751 - 00:19:13.115, Speaker B: Yeah, Taran's a cool guy. People need to get educated about Taren. So just like a little pre story here. I've been in Dubai this week. This is the Binance blockchain week going on and there's Ton Gateway as well. So a lot of people in town. You know, last time I think you were here was for, was for Token and sadly the traffic has not gotten any better.
00:19:13.115 - 00:19:53.305, Speaker B: Despite, despite there not being a torrential, you know, cataclysmic flood going on, it still takes an hour to get anywhere, which is pretty bad. But I've had some really interesting discussions. The main summaries are one, like, not a lot of people hold bitcoin, so there's not that much euphoria going on. A lot of people in other stuff, altcoins, you know, still kind of depressed. Two, you know, this is a meme coin heavy city. All the meme coin influencers, not surprisingly because of the kind of tax regime and the legal regime, a lot of them are in Dubai. They all know all the cabals.
00:19:53.305 - 00:20:19.423, Speaker B: There's like 40 person cabals that work together and trade together and put alerts and they're building tools. I learned quite a lot. I had to sit down with some of these guys. Some of the highlights from the streets, from what I'm hearing in the streets, one base is dead apparently. Like it's all in Solana right now. I didn't know this. I thought like Bastille had some pretty big stuff going on, but they're saying it's, it's, it's sort of one, one pony show with Solana at the moment.
00:20:19.423 - 00:21:17.063, Speaker B: I found out about some of these marketing strategies that are used and, and a lot of telegram groups, a lot of reply guys, a lot, a lot of concerted efforts going on. The amount of professional tooling that these guys use to track wallets getting funded from Binance, like, oh, this wallet just got freshly funded and you know, they get all these alerts. It's a very professional setup to track these pump funds and all these launches and figure out if someone's bundling and then you try to snipe them when they're going from the pump fund to radium at the 60K market cap and you try to snipe that and Then people dump on you. There, there's, there's a lot of game theory going on. What else? So people are talking about Hyper liquid right now. I, I would say that that's quite hyped and it's kind of getting close to pg. Everyone is asking each other what do you think is, is this actually going to launch where it's hyped or like what, what's, what's, what do you think? My general answer to these is I think it's going to launch at 500 million market cap.
00:21:17.063 - 00:21:31.627, Speaker B: So the FDV just depends on what they actually use as the, as the, as the float though the main question I guess is will Binance list hyper liquid? And I think probably not, but, but there's some chance.
00:21:31.731 - 00:21:41.211, Speaker D: Quick question for you Kevin. As a high frequency trader, do you use hyper liquid? What's the experience like, do you think? Are you bullish to token once it comes out? Do you have any thoughts there?
00:21:41.283 - 00:22:11.395, Speaker A: Yeah, we, we used to do a bit of HFT at gala but we don't do any of that anymore. We're, we're mostly discretionary long short right now. But I like the product. I mean I think Jeff is a really smart guy and there's a reason that they've been picking up market share. I mean they're basically doing their own market making, which I think at some point there's going to be some issues there. But at least for now it's like the execution quality is really good and they're listing tons of different markets. So I like what they're doing.
00:22:11.775 - 00:22:52.691, Speaker D: Nice, nice. If I can pivot the conversation. One thing you said earlier, Kevin, is, you know, in markets there's known unknowns and unknown unknowns and I think one known unknown that, you know, we're all talking about is the election. So according to Polymarket, I think Trump peaked at 67 and now it's closer to 61, 39. How do you think about the markets with the election? Like one thing Justin and I noticed is that you know, as soon as Trump odds peaked, that's when the markets started nuking. I'm not sure if that's like related, but how are you playing the election? Are you risk on bitcoin, light on alts, et cetera? Or how do you think about this? How do you position for this?
00:22:52.883 - 00:23:26.091, Speaker A: Yeah, so I just want to maybe pre qualify that in this and say that I don't really have any edge in political markets. So just take this with a grain of salt. I think whether Trump or Kamala Wins. I don't think it's that bad for crypto, even if Kamala wins, because they're still like the House and Senate. And generally crypto, at this point, at least in Congress, is pretty bipartisan. It'll still be pretty rough, I would say. I still expect price to go down if she wins, but maybe not as much as people are kind of scared of.
00:23:26.091 - 00:24:08.635, Speaker A: And then on top of that, probably bitcoin does well, just because bitcoin is already kind of like a commodity. And then all of the possible, quote, unquote, security coins, maybe, you know, they still have a lot of pain to deal with going forward. And then, you know, if Trump wins or if there's like, Republican sweep on both houses, then, you know, it should probably be, you know, very good. And, you know, probably ICOs come back. And I think there's like, two counterbaling effects here, because, like, with Solana, one of the reasons. Well, I think there's, like, two main reasons meme coins have taken off. One is, like, purely, like a regulatory reason, you know, and then because it's very hard to make the case that, like, a meme coin is a security, just because, like, nobody in their right mind could think that they would actually profit from it.
00:24:08.635 - 00:24:39.515, Speaker A: So I think in the long term, at least in the short term, of course, you make massive profits on it. So I think partly it's that, and then partly it's just that people are sick of being exit liquidity for private investors. But going on on the first point, if ICOs do come back, maybe Solana does take a hit because the meme coins go away. But if there are ICOs and they come back, then, like, probably a lot of that happens on. On Solana anyway. Right? So, like, I don't really even see Solana doing that badly. They lose one thing, but they game another, maybe.
00:24:39.515 - 00:24:51.947, Speaker A: So, you know, that could be okay. You know, as for the election itself and the odds, probably the right person to ask is like, gcr, who's really good about that kind of stuff? Like, I don't. You know, for me, I just. I go with the poly market odds.
00:24:52.051 - 00:24:56.415, Speaker B: Kevin, we have Justin here. He's the Pennsylvania gcr.
00:24:57.115 - 00:25:00.575, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you think, Justin? Let me hear. I want to hear your thoughts on it.
00:25:01.105 - 00:25:29.167, Speaker C: Yeah, so I've been. I've been tracking this pretty closely, actually. This week, a tweet unfortunately became very popular. This was when we did When Shift Happens in Singapore, and I came out one. I was sort of, let's say, not favorable on crypto, Twitter, for being more long eth or more bullish eth than Solana for 2025. But I also in that clip said that I thought Kamala was going to win. I'd like to revise that now.
00:25:29.167 - 00:25:55.623, Speaker C: Personally, you know, like you Kevin, I don't think I have an edge there. I do think based on everything I've been seeing, I think poly market odds make sense. It's about 60 40, which is like virtually a tie. Right? I mean that, that's pretty close. I do think Trump has an edge now. He's made some inroads in Pennsylvania, although the early voting is a little scary, I would say for Republicans. But I would say overall he's definitely done better than I anticipated even just a month and a half ago when we were in Singapore.
00:25:55.623 - 00:26:07.755, Speaker C: And so I think Polymarket is about right here as it should be. Right. Like this election in our country is very divided. 50 50. So it would be very hard to expect an outcome or the true odds to be anywhere different than 60 40.
00:26:08.135 - 00:26:11.063, Speaker A: Yeah, your guys guess is as good as mine. I have, I have no edge.
00:26:11.159 - 00:26:57.565, Speaker C: But I do want to push back on something you said, Kevin. I do think there is actually a big difference and it's all because of the sec. Not necessarily what would happen with Congress or the House or the Senate. I think the SEC makes there's a big difference here on who wins. I also think there is this meme going around that meme coins are not going to be treated by as securities by the sec. But I actually think there's really not much reason to support that because like if you look at the Howie test, I think it would, I would not be surprised if Gary Gensler made the accusation, even though I disagree with it, that these meme coins are securities because you're betting on a core team to basically build a culture market this thing, get the word out there, etc. Like even though they're not building a core product, they are marketing the token as a product and I think they're not immune from regulation either.
00:26:57.905 - 00:27:26.065, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean I think you could be right. I just think that it's just a harder case to make because it's sort of like how do you get profits? How do you make profits from the efforts of others? Like one, there's a question about how profitable is this stuff anyway? You know, do people actually going go into it thinking about as an investment class kind of security or is it just like they understand that it's gambling and then two, it's like what efforts of others I Mean, you just click a button, right? Like there's no, there's no even real effort there.
00:27:26.225 - 00:27:33.425, Speaker C: But we're not seeing that. We're seeing like insider cabals getting allocations. We're seeing like actually organized marketing around these tokens.
00:27:33.545 - 00:27:45.091, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I would say that in that case then, yeah, that, that looks more like a security, right, Than like someone just randomly clicking a button, creating like a picture and then putting up a token. Right. But, but then I. Yeah, then I would agree with you for sure.
00:27:45.203 - 00:28:26.295, Speaker D: So a couple days ago I went to like a dinner hosted by Uniswap Labs as a bag holder of the governance token and I was talking to a few members of, you know, people you know in Uniswap. And one thing that, of course, you know, they, they know about the SEC and legal situation because they got the walls notice. And one thing that one of the employees talked about was that it could actually be really bearish short term if Trump wins because Gensler knows that he's going to be out, so he's going to just drop all the cases all at once. He's like, fuck it, this is my last hurrah. He's going to just drop all these cases. And that can cause a dump in the short term for alts, but of course in the medium to longer term it would be net beneficial.
00:28:26.375 - 00:28:47.849, Speaker C: I think that's huge. Unbelievable. Cope. The Uniswap team is publicly known as very left wing, which is fine, it's totally within their rights. But even if that were to happen from November till January, that's like a couple month window and then all of those cases can be dismissed if a new chair of the SEC came in. Right. They don't have to pursue these cases if they think they're not valid.
00:28:47.849 - 00:28:50.721, Speaker C: And so personally, I think that that's just complete Cope.
00:28:50.793 - 00:28:54.225, Speaker D: Yeah. And you know, Justin and I know how to cope as a need holder.
00:28:54.265 - 00:28:55.767, Speaker C: So yes, 100%.
00:28:55.873 - 00:29:28.515, Speaker D: Are you still long uni taiki as of October 31st? Yes. But that may change depending on the what happens with the price. Well, speaking about Cope, Justin, do you want to talk about the ETH blog Cope? Bull post. I want to hear Kevin's thoughts on this as well because, you know, Kevin has been tweeting about, you know, ETH holders, like both tweeting at the same time and you know, this collective, you know, bullpost and like, it worked for one day, now the prices are going down again. But care to share their bullets for.
00:29:28.855 - 00:30:10.141, Speaker C: For eth? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So, like, over the last week, after that when shift happens, like clip of me talking about being an ETH bull relative to Solana came out. I've seen like a lot of people reaching out to me, sending things like this. There's actually a lot of discussion happening in the Ethereum space on how bullish these blobs are. The TLDR is that if a demand for Ethereum block space on L2 does a 2x from here, about a 2x ETH becomes basically massive, massively deflationary, where we're burning thousands and thousands of ETH per day again. And so right now we're doing about 180 tps across all L2s according to this tweet. But if we get to 400, which you can see in this give here, I know it's quite small, then ETH becomes massively deflationary.
00:30:10.141 - 00:30:37.899, Speaker C: I'd recommend folks reading this tweet, but basically I thought like the most interesting post from Tim is he basically said like, you guys really thought that Vitalik and the whole Ethereum foundation and everyone building this hadn't thought about this. And so like if you actually look at how blobs are priced, it does get Insanely bullish for ETH. If L2 demand really does pick up, obviously that's the question. But if people are using L2s, it is not fair to say that they're parasitic towards eth, in my opinion.
00:30:38.067 - 00:30:44.691, Speaker D: Can you click on the image and explain like what's going on there with the, the red curve and all that? I'm too smooth brained.
00:30:44.723 - 00:30:45.603, Speaker B: I don't really know.
00:30:45.739 - 00:31:15.436, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So this, this image is an example of ETH doing 10,000 TPS, which is obviously quite bullish. If we got to 10,000 TPS, the average cost of a transaction on L2 would only be $0.06, which obviously is higher than Solana, but still quite reasonable. For context. We're doing 200 TPS now, so 10,000 is a huge jump. But if we ever got there, which is obviously like the long term goal to get to something like the scale of visa, 10,000 tps, you can see we'd be deflationary by 4.6%
00:31:15.436 - 00:31:32.923, Speaker C: per year. And so that's 15,000 plus eth burnt per day. So this is obviously lofty goal. But this has been the Ethereum roadmap, right? Ethereum is trying to build for something like 10,000 TPS per year. And if we, if we ever get there, right on Ethereum L2, that's going to be insanely bullish.
00:31:33.099 - 00:31:35.415, Speaker D: What do you think, Kevin? Do you buy this.
00:31:35.755 - 00:32:05.833, Speaker A: I think that I particularly like this post as opposed to like a week ago there were like these novels that were being written by everybody Pokemon the timeline, which I didn't like. And the reason I like this is because I feel like this is, it's much more concrete how this affects the market and it's much more relevant to me. While everything else like, on like the super long term tech side, I think as more of like a short term trader, that's not stuff that we really care about. They could be right, they could be wrong. It'll take forever to even figure out exactly what they're saying. It'll take forever. Even read that thread, you know, it's a fucking novel, you know.
00:32:05.833 - 00:33:09.313, Speaker A: So, you know, like, I think at the end of the day this one I actually did like and you know, the previous ones, I think it's a lot of like naval gazing, you know, like a lot of times like, you know, sometimes people like start shitting on like bank lists that they start shitting on like, you know, like Vitalik and stuff like that. And that's like they're on trial for price going down, right? It's like there's this veil of like, people think that it looks like they're talking about tech, but really people are just mad that the price is going down, right? So like if that's the case and they're wondering why the price is going down. Well, my thesis is just that there's just too much infighting in Ethereum, right? Like all these boomers who might be wanting to buy this etf, they're going to be reading these tweets and they can't make heads or tails of it. They're going to be looking at this tech and I'm like, this is just like some wacky gizmo, some crazy mechanism. Mechanism. They have no idea. But what they can tell is that a lot of people are constantly in disagreement with each other and that kind of scares them off, right? So that's why, you know, I thought it was very interesting that when, you know, Vitalik, you know, said that, you know, the ticker is eth, he started calling people bro and stuff like that, you know, then like, and then like everybody started in unison chanting, the ticker is eat.
00:33:09.313 - 00:33:21.001, Speaker A: The ticker is eat. I mean, the whole thing was pretty cringe, but it kind of, you know, kind of did what it was supposed to do, right? Like at least there was some unity there. And you know, and I think, you know, that the market reflected that, right?
00:33:21.073 - 00:33:33.015, Speaker B: It was A good start. Yeah. And then like he kind of paired it with his tweet here. After his long post somebody said, is Vitalik retarded? And he, he responded himself. He said yes.
00:33:35.355 - 00:33:55.147, Speaker C: Yeah, so Vitalik, he needs like a PR team, like a personal PR team. Like of course these like, look, these posts are great, like talking about the surge and then we've got these like nerdy engineering charts. But like people don't want to read this, right? Like of course it's great for engineers and builders, but the average person just wants like a quick tldr. This is like a very technical spec.
00:33:55.251 - 00:34:17.159, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, us traders, we all have ADD anyway. Are we going to sit here and read this fucking novel? Like no way. Right? Like, and you look at like Ansem, like back in the day, right? Like all of Ansem's tweets are mostly short and every once in a while he posts this like super long essay and then like soul goes down. You know what I mean? There's always this correlation where like the longer the tweet thread is, the like, the worse it is. Basically digging yourself a whole.
00:34:17.287 - 00:34:30.871, Speaker C: We should get to that. But I think that's what happened with these AI memes. I mean, maybe we'll circle back to that later. But memes went from like, it's a cute pygmy hippo, it's a cute dog with a hat on it, to like all this AI thesis of AI influencers and KOLs.
00:34:30.943 - 00:35:19.891, Speaker A: Yeah, I think like once people start to try and justify and back rationalize why certain phenomenon are happening in like this like highfalutin kind of speak, you know, it's just like, it's just all bad, right? Because like at the end of the day, like at some point you just kind of like, you know, some meme coin trader is sitting in their, in their parents basement and then like power goes out and they're staring at the reflection on their computer screen and then just kind of dawns on them like what the fuck is actually going on? You know, like, what am I actually doing? You know, and it's like in those, in those, in those moments of clarity, then it's just like, well all this, you know, all this, all this like backwards justification is complete nonsense. You know, it's just like, at least in the short term, what these guys care about. And I'm not saying anything about the long term. I mean, long term, you know, all these devs and all these technical guys, you know, on the tech side, they could be totally right, right. But I'm just saying, like the market is dictated as, you know, it's a voting machine in the short term. Right. And it's a weighing machine in the long run.
00:35:19.891 - 00:35:42.039, Speaker A: I think it was like, maybe. I forget who said that. Was it Gary or naval or something? But, but you know, basically in the short term, if that's what people care about and you know, a dev is like working on their code and stuff and on their second screen they're just like constantly watching the price action, you know, while they're working. If that's what they care about, then like that's what's going to, that's what's going to move the market. You know, in the short term, it's not going to be anything to do with the long term roadmap.
00:35:42.127 - 00:36:18.061, Speaker B: I mean it's, it's a huge change compared to the bear market where ETH was literally the only chain. I remember Rollbit moved their token from Solana to ETH and then suddenly started pumping and people were like, okay, SPLs are dead. Like, you know, ETH is the only chain compared to now. Like this week I've Talked to several L2s that apparently the cool thing now is to speculate on like becoming an L1 instead. Like, why be an L2? Like, just like might as well go for the full premium of being an L1 rather than being an L2. And maybe this is the bottom. Maybe like we're bottoming, but I have a, I have a feeling that I think there is no bottom.
00:36:18.061 - 00:36:43.165, Speaker B: There is no bottom. Vitalik. Until you come unsteady lads, you keep, you keep playing these games and not coming on, but that would mark the bottom. When you finally come to the people, come organically to the people. So I responded to a tweet that I saw on my timeline saying a lot of the stuff that we've been saying, you know, like it sounds like philosophical, you know, we kind of. It was time fun if you want to bring it up. Justin.
00:36:43.165 - 00:37:20.453, Speaker B: They, they moved from base to Solana, which is a sentiment I've been hearing that generally, you know, basis kind of maybe drop the ball a bit. And the builders that are just looking for active traders, degens, you know, activity are right now using Solana. These guys said the vibes couldn't be more different. We've seen a few of these posts recently and then it's always like Solana foundation just responds like welcome at the bottom. This is usually the okay. And then Jesse's like, thanks for coming. See you next time.
00:37:20.453 - 00:37:24.385, Speaker B: You know, respect for Very nice guy.
00:37:25.165 - 00:37:52.015, Speaker A: But yeah, Jordy, I totally agree with you. I think, and not just facetiously that Vitalik should come on Steady Lads, but he like, really should, right? Because like at the end of the day, like, you know, there's always the sentiment with the ETH crowd, like on Farcaster and stuff, that they're like kind of in this research ivory tower, right? They spend all their time drawing boxes and lines basically, right. And they really need to come and talk with us retards and degens, right? They need to come and talk to the people.
00:37:52.315 - 00:37:53.935, Speaker B: If that's what people.
00:37:54.835 - 00:38:10.795, Speaker A: I think it's totally fine. If they, if they really have conviction that what they're doing is correct, right. And they don't need feedback from, you know, us as degens and retards, that's okay too. But then they can't complain about short term price action. If they're right in the long term, they'll win. And then the short term and then the short term, they'll just have to suffer pain. Right.
00:38:10.795 - 00:38:15.739, Speaker A: But if they care about the short term at all, they need to come talk to the people. So I, I totally agree. They need to come on tell you, that's for sure.
00:38:15.867 - 00:38:36.535, Speaker C: You know, Vitalik sort of reminds me of Kamala Harris dodging Joe Rogan. Just thinking, you know, we're, we're just friendly guys, the three of us, we just want to talk to him, get to know him anymore. We're not going to grill him too hard. But, you know, like to me, Vitalik is a little woke, sort of like in the same bucket as Kamala Harris. And I think, you know, it's just a little. He's scared, you know, but we're nice people. We want to have him on.
00:38:36.535 - 00:38:37.343, Speaker C: We're friendly.
00:38:37.439 - 00:38:41.711, Speaker A: I'm all for it. I think that's what he needs to be. But, you know, you can do what he wants to do.
00:38:41.823 - 00:38:46.271, Speaker B: Yeah, we need to get his opinion on Goatsie. Like no, no one is able to extract that.
00:38:46.343 - 00:38:52.515, Speaker A: So I want to get your guys opinion on goatsie. If anything. You guys been on the track. I mean, Justin and it's only me.
00:38:52.855 - 00:38:53.711, Speaker D: It's only me.
00:38:53.783 - 00:38:54.695, Speaker A: Oh, thank you.
00:38:54.815 - 00:38:56.315, Speaker D: Justin's on me.
00:38:57.375 - 00:39:05.155, Speaker C: I think it was just me, to be honest. I'm getting all the flack somehow. Jordy is a little skeptical too, but he never gets flack from this stuff. I get all the fl.
00:39:05.715 - 00:39:23.987, Speaker B: So we have a full spectrum here. So Justin thinks it's like all stupid. I think the meta is here to stay, but it's not Necessarily like the coins that we saw last week and we've already seen Genon died. Code is still alive. It might have some staying power. And Taiki is just like full in. He's full in.
00:39:23.987 - 00:39:26.603, Speaker B: So we have the full spectrum here.
00:39:26.699 - 00:39:34.895, Speaker D: Yeah, I was bow posting Goatse like a week ago and then all my shit coins are down like 70% at this point.
00:39:36.275 - 00:39:48.707, Speaker C: I. I have to. I just have to point something out. We had this episode a week ago. Look, we're cherry picking goats down. Call it 41% from the all time high. We're cherry picking price highs to where it's at now.
00:39:48.707 - 00:40:25.763, Speaker C: Who cares about that? I did say though, like, you know, this is all just one big rotation game. What about Mudang, our cute pygmy hippo? And Moodyng got a binance listing the day after our episode and I think it pumped a couple hundred percent back to close to the highs, which is quite interesting. But I do think we'll see in the next couple of weeks. But what I pointed out, that was just sort of like if this AI meme coin thing turns out to be a fad, then I think it's safe to assume that all of these meme coin categories can just be fads, which is fine, but I really do think until proven otherwise, these are just hot ball rotations of money.
00:40:25.899 - 00:40:42.295, Speaker D: Yeah, I 100% agree. It's just that this is the first meme coin meta that I was actually interested in. So I just embraced it and then I rode my shitcoins. Went up like 10 15x and then it went down 70% in a single day. It's like, oh yeah, this shit's only fun when it's pumping.
00:40:44.475 - 00:41:03.693, Speaker B: But such as life. You're forcing me to find a new pasta now. I mean, I was going to use your pasta now. You said it. Now I'm going to have to get a new pasta. So Taiki's tweet about it's only fun when the price is going up and the AI stuff is less cool when it's not. Was going to be my pasta.
00:41:03.693 - 00:41:04.505, Speaker B: Okay.
00:41:06.205 - 00:41:09.765, Speaker D: I have some other pastas. If you go to my profile, I have a lot of pastas.
00:41:09.885 - 00:41:15.585, Speaker B: No, no, I'm never going to use a taiki pasta ever again. You're just going to ruin it on the show. No more tanky pasta.
00:41:16.845 - 00:41:43.141, Speaker A: Yeah, my thought on the whole goat thing, I'm kind of in the middle too. I kind of like it for the reason that it was like pretty emergent and organic and there was quite a bit of work that went into it, right. From the developer and whatnot. And also maybe comparing it a little bit to, like, SPX6900. There's at least some work that went into that website and the content that they put up there. I think people were kind of getting sick of just like cute animals and pictures and stuff like that. Right.
00:41:43.141 - 00:42:10.051, Speaker A: That you could just launch with a click. So I think that the meta is changing a little bit there, but at the same time, it's like, hard to say. Like, maybe some new meta comes and upsets it. You know, it's always like, the first thing always does well, and then there's always like infinite copycats, right? Like Genon and all these other things. And then, like. And then that just, like, hurts everything basically, you know? So, yeah, I mean, hard to say either way, but I kind of still like Goat right now. We don't own any, but I still kind of like it.
00:42:10.123 - 00:42:30.243, Speaker D: Yeah. If Goat goes to zero, then I'll probably never touch memes again. It's pretty brutal. There was also this shitcoin on Ethereum. So there's the goat on Ethereum called T he. Because the Eth people are. So maybe the Eth people are very ethical.
00:42:30.243 - 00:42:41.223, Speaker D: Like, oh, this is not our token. This is not our token. So it went to a $40 million market cap, and then the team were like, please don't buy this token. And then it went down, like, 90%. So even the eth people couldn't pump. The eth version of go.
00:42:41.339 - 00:42:47.115, Speaker A: Is that the one where, like, anonymous people can, like, go through a tee to go make posts on Twitter or something?
00:42:48.055 - 00:43:11.277, Speaker D: It uses te, but I don't think anonymous people can post about it. It's about, like, a pet rock that has emotions. It was built by News Research, actually. News Research, they built. They launched a subnet on Bittensor Left, and then they just launched some random AI agent shitcoin. Or they didn't. They didn't launch a shitcoin, but they launched, like, an agent AI agent bot that has a token.
00:43:11.277 - 00:43:15.749, Speaker D: So they're fucking around. They're fucking around. They're trying things.
00:43:15.917 - 00:43:26.269, Speaker A: I see. I think they were making some joke. That balloon lover, the venture apologist guy, was really. Multiple people's accounts and everybody's going through a tee. So I think that's something different.
00:43:26.437 - 00:43:32.671, Speaker D: Okay, so you're somewhat optimistic, Goat, but the jury remains out.
00:43:32.853 - 00:44:02.275, Speaker B: So. Something that made me chuckle pretty hard recently is I'm following this Korean streamer, trading streamers. You know, Koreans love their trading streamers and Ja Dudu was long eth for a while. I think she doesn't know what's been going on for all this year. She, you know, she just entered into a long eth position. So we see here she's 30x long on Ethereum. And she says, thank you, Vitalik.
00:44:02.275 - 00:44:23.651, Speaker B: You are my God. And she's wearing the soccer jersey and like pumping, pumping, you know, up $36,000. Just, just, you know, you're my God. And she did not close her position. Rookie mistake. When you're long youth, let's. Let's see what happened the following day.
00:44:23.651 - 00:44:43.537, Speaker B: So three days later, the 50,000 profit disappeared in an instant. Ethereum was not a God, it was trash. Still does not close the position. Let's see what happens next. 2471 now in Ethereum. Ah, Mike test to the commander's office. Never hold Ethereum.
00:44:43.537 - 00:45:03.943, Speaker B: I repeat, never hold Ethereum. And then we should see the final tweet. There's a. Where a whale alert on 26 October, somebody transfers 32 million. She says, who the just keeps selling eth. Save me from this hell.
00:45:04.119 - 00:45:11.675, Speaker C: You know, I gotta give her credit. She's learned in four days, but I still haven't learned over five years being in this industry. So kudos to her.
00:45:12.055 - 00:45:25.125, Speaker D: She's the first cycler, you know. Yeah, this was, this was me in 2020. I was, I bought eth and I was like, holy shit. Vitalik is my God. And they're like, oh, my God, this is insane. And now I'm like, God damn it, Vitalik. Why?
00:45:25.245 - 00:45:32.105, Speaker A: It's a whole roller coaster of emotion, you know, it's the euphoria, all the stages, you know, denial, anger, everything, basically.
00:45:33.165 - 00:45:38.425, Speaker D: Yeah. We still haven't capitulated, unfortunately. Happening soon. Happening soon.
00:45:38.725 - 00:45:41.185, Speaker A: Unless he comes on the pod. Unless he comes on the pod.
00:45:42.045 - 00:45:48.941, Speaker B: It's not necessarily like him coming on. It's what it would show. The fact that he would come on would show that on the right path. He's on the right path.
00:45:49.053 - 00:45:56.405, Speaker A: 100%. 100%. Yeah. I mean, he. I mean, making a bankless appearance, that's. It's too friendly, you know what I mean? You know, it's too much of a friendly kind of a.
00:45:56.445 - 00:45:59.141, Speaker C: You know, that's like when Kamala went on call her daddy, right?
00:45:59.173 - 00:46:03.185, Speaker A: It's the same. Yeah, exactly. Oh, exactly, exactly, exactly.
00:46:03.485 - 00:46:19.713, Speaker B: All right, let's wrap up with a pasta of the week. There's a. A few good ones I've seen, and mine got ruined by Takey, so I have a new one now just no. Okay. All right, I'll do mine first. Here we go. So this was a few days ago when Bitcoin was getting very close to the all time high.
00:46:19.713 - 00:46:41.765, Speaker B: It was 2k away. And Ethereum also happened to be 2k away from all time high. A bit of a different percentage difference, but know the rules. When the workplace girl gets hit on With Bitcoin being 2KOH, she thinks it's sweet. And when it's ETH, we have to call human resources.
00:46:41.925 - 00:46:45.305, Speaker A: Yeah, the bottom guy is Eugene. That's the bottom guy right there.
00:46:48.165 - 00:46:50.109, Speaker D: It's Michael Saylor and Eugene.
00:46:50.237 - 00:47:03.781, Speaker B: Kevin. I do not know what you speak. There is no way that a venerable member of the well known dwf Very ethical and moral company would ever stoop to anything.
00:47:03.893 - 00:47:09.555, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I was surprised. I thought DWF was like the moral compass of the space, so I was just completely surprised.
00:47:09.605 - 00:47:12.895, Speaker B: Dealer T, do you have anything to follow that up with?
00:47:12.975 - 00:47:39.633, Speaker D: Yeah, this is also kind of inappropriate, but I've been in the, you know, shitcoin trenches and the one thing Morel talks about is, you know, having like free cult labor. So apparently Mr. Dean Bullough here was on Pornhub and you know, in the comment section of some of these, some of these videos, we had people shilling pump fund tickers like, how can I get this cat on radium bruh? And then has a pump ticker, you know, free cult labor. It's pretty bullish. Got everyone working for their bags.
00:47:39.769 - 00:47:41.569, Speaker B: Justin. Yeah, I gotta clean up.
00:47:41.617 - 00:48:07.295, Speaker C: First of all, my meme is this is gonna outclass you guys. I also think it's nice to go back a little towards civility. You guys are a little more on the appropriate side. I've been very concerned about AI Deepfakes, all of these scams going around. And this is just another helpful psa, I would say, especially as we're all going get gearing up to go to Thailand for devcon. I think this is something we all have to keep in mind. So today my dad got a call that no parent ever wants to hear.
00:48:07.295 - 00:48:27.275, Speaker C: He heard me tell him I was wrapped up in a crypto scheme involving Thai prostitutes and needed 30k to bail me out. This time it was me. But soon AI will be able to make these calls indistinguishable. Scary. And I think we all have to be careful. You know, give your folks a heads up that you're going to Thailand just so they don't think it's an AI call if you give them a ring. And you need to get Bailed out.
00:48:29.045 - 00:48:30.145, Speaker A: That's great.
00:48:30.725 - 00:48:33.813, Speaker B: So you're. You are buying into the AI thesis.
00:48:33.949 - 00:48:34.469, Speaker A: You're coming.
00:48:34.517 - 00:48:43.665, Speaker C: Exactly. AI agents are the future of scams. I feel like those were all weak pastas. No one laughed at an pasta. We all just laughed at our own pastas.
00:48:44.805 - 00:48:46.821, Speaker A: I liked them all. I thought they were all pretty funny.
00:48:46.973 - 00:48:57.659, Speaker B: I think the internal one is epic, but everyone's seen it. It has like, you know, millions of impressions. So everyone's already seen that one. So Kevin, which. Which of the three pastas is going to win? What's the pasta of the week?
00:48:57.747 - 00:49:05.563, Speaker A: You know what I actually thought was the funniest was the Korean girl, actually. I thought. Yeah.
00:49:05.619 - 00:49:08.427, Speaker C: And why wasn't that your pasta? Jordy? That was so much better.
00:49:08.571 - 00:49:18.055, Speaker A: That was hilarious. And she went through all the emotions. She went through all the stages of grief, you know, so fast. Went through a full cycle. Went through a full cycle in a few days, you know.
00:49:18.475 - 00:49:30.337, Speaker B: Yeah. And if you want to check her Twitter and scroll up, she has stopped trading eth. She's only logging bitcoin. Now she's talking about bitcoin. So she's moved on. She learned it one week.
00:49:30.441 - 00:49:31.925, Speaker D: My gosh, she's so smart.
00:49:32.345 - 00:49:37.485, Speaker A: Wow. Seems like a lot of people learned that lesson over a couple of schools. She just speed ran a cycle. That's all it is.
00:49:37.945 - 00:49:38.953, Speaker B: Bitcoin to the moon.
00:49:39.009 - 00:49:39.601, Speaker C: Now wait.
00:49:39.673 - 00:49:42.476, Speaker B: Yeah, she bought it at 69, so she's rich.
00:49:42.573 - 00:49:47.209, Speaker C: She also bought Ethereum on the 20 eigth and made seven grand.
00:49:47.257 - 00:49:47.865, Speaker B: Oh no.
00:49:47.985 - 00:49:58.747, Speaker D: See, she learned. She took profits. Can you click on that tweet like he. She took profits on half. She. She learned her lesson whenever eat pumps you had like you have to sell.
00:49:58.891 - 00:50:01.723, Speaker A: Yeah. You're always smarter in your second cycle. That's definitely true.
00:50:01.819 - 00:50:02.691, Speaker D: Well, I don't know about that.
00:50:02.723 - 00:50:02.867, Speaker A: You.
00:50:02.891 - 00:50:09.163, Speaker D: You become a mid curve on your second cycle. I think because you have the ptsd, you're not going to get wrecked, but you're going to miss out on all the pumps.
00:50:09.299 - 00:50:27.423, Speaker B: All right, so Jaadodu, you are the pasta of the week winner. Wherever, wherever you are out there in Korea. Congratulations. All right, guys. Well, it's going to be a busy week, I think. There's a lot of data coming out and then we have the election results. So could be a very different world when we next see you.
00:50:27.423 - 00:50:30.039, Speaker B: Hopefully it'll be to the upside. Take care.
00:50:30.087 - 00:50:33.511, Speaker C: Bitcoin. All time highs and a Trump presidency. That's my prediction.
00:50:33.663 - 00:50:35.395, Speaker A: Let's go. Yeah. Thanks for having me.
00:50:35.815 - 00:50:37.255, Speaker B: See you, Kevin. Thanks for coming on.
