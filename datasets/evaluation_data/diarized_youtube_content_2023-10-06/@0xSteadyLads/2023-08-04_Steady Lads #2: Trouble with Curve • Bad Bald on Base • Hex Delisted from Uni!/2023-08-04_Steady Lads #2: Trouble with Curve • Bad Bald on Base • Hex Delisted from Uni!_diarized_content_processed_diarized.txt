00:00:20.800 - 00:00:39.544, Speaker A: Welcome to episode two of steady lads. As everybody can see, you know, with the 500. 500 subscribers, we were now able to afford a proper intro video. The quality of production has gone up massively. So good to have you with us, and we're hoping to make this a weekly occurrence. I'm Jordy. I'm the CEO of Salini Capital.
00:00:39.544 - 00:01:10.718, Speaker A: We have the usual crew. We have Taiki, the humble farmer. We have Justin Bran, one of the founders of Astaria. And we have Thikki, who is a junior analyst coffeeintern at Scimitar Capital, which is one of the most notorious crypto funds around. And, you know, let's start off this week with the hot topic from last week, which is world coin. And Justin, last week we were discussing how none of us were willing to go get our eyeball scanned, but you were. So we're kind of curious to hear the story.
00:01:10.718 - 00:01:11.902, Speaker A: Like, how did that go?
00:01:12.078 - 00:01:55.826, Speaker B: Yes, you can see here, I was trying to respect everyone's privacy, but snuck a photo, so you can see the orb there on the table, and actually to the right, you can't really see them, but there was a family there, and that family was asking, if they scanned in the US, could they still get their coins? Eventually. And I found the answer to this. I took a while, but you can scan anywhere, but if you're based in the US or using a VPN, you can't claim. So if I were to go to, let's say, Canada or the UK, I could claim, but you can't do it from the US. And if you turn a VPN on, they can track you. And I log on. Some of the developers that have started, they were trying to see if they could help me connect to their private networks outside of the US and, like, go around that, and it still didn't work.
00:01:55.826 - 00:02:22.540, Speaker B: So they've got great detection. But if you're in the States, claim, yeah, but you can scan, so. And it's. It's really cool. So you go there, you have the world app download it on your phone, you scan the QR code on the orb, and then immediately it starts sort of scanning your face. It scans the whole face, and then the eyes, I believe, and the whole process takes about 30 seconds. Very quick, the orb chimes, saying, your id is unique and verified, and then you're good to go.
00:02:22.540 - 00:02:28.704, Speaker B: Very simple. And hopefully someday I'll be able to claim these, claim these coins and eventually sell them.
00:02:29.244 - 00:02:55.752, Speaker A: That's quite interesting that they managed to detect that. I mean, I know from the poker days that poker stars and some of these websites did have a way that they could tell that you were using a VPN and actually from the United States. And I thought that in Defi, like, people just, they have the technology, but they don't use it because they just want to turn a blind eye and be able to tell the regulators that, hey, we checked IP address, but in this case, wow.
00:02:55.928 - 00:03:14.874, Speaker B: Well, we went above and beyond. So I don't know if folks listening are familiar with Wireshark or Wi fi man, but I actually tunneled into someone, we have someone based in Canada. I tunneled into their network, and it still detected that I was using it. So I wasn't using expressvpn or Nordvpn. I, like, went above and beyond trying to get these coins, and no luck. I hold zero world coin.
00:03:15.574 - 00:03:25.558, Speaker A: So for that, like, $64 of world coin, I hope you haven't just admitted to breaking any federal laws and it's not just going to be the three of us next week, hopefully.
00:03:25.686 - 00:03:26.014, Speaker B: Cool.
00:03:26.054 - 00:03:34.074, Speaker A: Okay, so you get the app, you don't have the coins yet, and we'll wait for your next trip to Europe to see when you can claim the coins.
00:03:34.654 - 00:03:44.564, Speaker B: Well, I think it's just one coin now. I don't think I'm eligible for the full $50. I think it's just a single world coin coin. So I don't know if I'll be making a flight just for this, but we'll see.
00:03:45.744 - 00:03:55.880, Speaker C: Well, so they actually extended the deadline for the Genesis airdrop. It used to end on the 31st for the first. They extended to the 7th, I'm guessing, because they didn't get enough signups.
00:03:56.072 - 00:04:41.448, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, thinking. I had a. I had an amazing Twitter spaces a few days ago going through all the scenarios with world coin, and, you know, my thread about world coin and my thought about it blowing up potentially made a lot of people bullish because bubbles usually get a lot bigger before they burst. And it's entirely possible. I think the downside, though, is some of these stories we're seeing potentially, where in Africa or in other third world countries, you can have hunters going around and collecting $1 per eyeball and then selling them the black market. So I'm still kind of worried about these dystopian scenarios, but we'll see how it plays out, and I'm sure it'll come up. But we have other drama in the meantime.
00:04:41.448 - 00:05:09.614, Speaker A: It's been one of the heaviest weeks of drama. I think kind of started with this, the curve wars, which is not the curve wars that we expected. It's a different kind of curve wars, and I think a lot of you guys have managed to do quite a good deep dive. Taiki, I know you were looking at the list of the amazing counterparts that have bought curve at $0.40. What do you think about this list?
00:05:09.994 - 00:06:15.404, Speaker D: It definitely doesn't inspire that much confidence. I mean, of course, I don't want to generalize all these people, but, for example, I feel like in an ideal scenario, Mitch would have found OTC buyers of, like, like, VC's or other Defi founders who have, I guess, aligned interests. I feel like most of these people are just profit driven. And I feel like there's also PvP games to be played here where if you're, for example, Mancha Big Brother, and you know that this news is going to be announced, they can just lever long curve on perps, and then when the short squeeze happens, cover it, short it on purpose, and just hedge his entire exposure. I think he has some protection because he locked his entire curve stack for six months or something. But I would assume that he made a bunch of money already by using other centralized exchanges and whatnot. It seems like Michael had trouble finding buyers, and he resorted to selling it to these less than stellar characters.
00:06:15.404 - 00:06:20.980, Speaker D: And then, you know, we can talk about, okay, like, these lock ups aren't even contractually obligated.
00:06:21.012 - 00:06:21.156, Speaker A: Right.
00:06:21.180 - 00:06:27.436, Speaker D: Like, if one person sells, then it can lead to a cascade of, well, if he's selling, I'm gonna sell. And then that can lead to a whole other shenanigan.
00:06:27.540 - 00:06:53.484, Speaker A: Absolutely. I mean, the list of characters is so questionable that wintermute, which, you know, they try not to say who they're dealing with or not dealing with. I don't know if you guys saw this tweet by Evgeni. He's so disgusted by the list of people that he wanted to clarify that he. He and his firm are not a counterparty. He wanted to make sure everybody's aware. And I think I saw you posted this.
00:06:53.484 - 00:07:00.672, Speaker A: Yeah. How do you expect this game theory to play out? Is everybody kind of just follow the rules at this point?
00:07:00.768 - 00:07:14.336, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, yeah, it's definitely tough to tell. I mean, as soon as one of them defects and brings the price down, it does incentivize other people to sell to suboccan their profits.
00:07:14.520 - 00:07:29.284, Speaker A: Yeah. And you've said that he's paid the iron price, and is the iron price. Is it the iron price that he's just sold some tokens at $0.40? Is that enough of an iron price? I would think the iron price is getting liquidated on something. Is that enough of pain for him?
00:07:30.544 - 00:07:36.204, Speaker C: Yeah. The ultimate iron price is definitely selling a house, or both houses for it.
00:07:37.414 - 00:07:42.834, Speaker D: And that marks the end of the Defi bear market. Career founder liquidates his house.
00:07:43.774 - 00:08:02.650, Speaker A: One of the interesting things we had in the last bull market was this, like, fractionalization where they were taking, like, a picture of, you know, Shiba Inu and making a million pieces out of it, and, you know, fractionalizing this. And I think a much better usage would be if we can take over the house of Michael and fractionalize that. Maybe.
00:08:02.742 - 00:08:09.614, Speaker B: There's so few on chain users that each on chain user, like anyone that's operating on chain, could probably get their own bedroom across these two houses.
00:08:10.034 - 00:08:35.314, Speaker A: But, yeah, the curve wars have been keeping us very entertained. Every day there's, like, a new development now. Like, aave is potentially looking to buy some curve and help kind of keep. Keep things afloat. So we'll see how that plays out. But one of the more interesting things that happened was definitely, you know, base. And even though we thought that base was going to potentially be a very safe and regulated chain.
00:08:35.314 - 00:08:56.578, Speaker A: Yeah, we've seen the first rug pull. It's a proper, proper yow. Kind of rug pull. We have a steady lads as well here by Will Clemente. So, since we are the steady lads, I mean, what do we make of this? Is this. Is this Alameda? What do you think, Vicki?
00:08:56.766 - 00:09:17.010, Speaker C: I think there has been talking about some research earlier where the addresses that deployed had a pretty rich on chain history that matched signature of the US FTX deposit addresses, their voting proposals that were really associated with Alameda FTX. So very possible it was a rogue Al made employee or something like that.
00:09:17.122 - 00:09:42.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw some people were looking at the grammatical. They do this recently. Now, whenever you have someone talking, they'll try to pull up tweets and look at historical things. And I don't know if you guys saw this. Correct, correct. But apparently, SBF or the twitter of SPF, whoever. Whoever was managing it, has a proclivity to respond with the single word correct.
00:09:42.914 - 00:10:23.524, Speaker A: And this is kind of potentially a tell that it's either SPF, which I don't think it is, SPF, because that would be a bit too brazen to do that from his basement, but potentially somebody that was running the Twitter of SBF during. During all these times. And I'll show an interesting anecdote from five years ago. So I interviewed a lot of traders, and we had a trader that was very smart seemed really good. He made huge claims to us about his results, and I asked for a reference. I did a reference check. So I called the first reference he gave me, and it was some guy that he was working with.
00:10:23.524 - 00:11:06.300, Speaker A: And the guy was like, yeah, I kind of know him, but I actually haven't worked that closely with him. I can't answer a lot of these questions that you're asking me. So I go back to the candidate and I say, hey, like, do you have any other reference? Like, this guy? He didn't really have the ability to give a proper reference. So he says, yeah, call this number, call this guy here. So I call, and immediately I had a suspicion that it was the same individual, the same candidate, just putting on, like, a really thick accent. So he had this, like, thick accent and was, like, responding in a different voice, but I had a suspicion it was him. So I just play dumb, and I go through the process, you know, I'm asking him, like, oh, have you, have you worked with Mister X? It's like, yes, yes.
00:11:06.300 - 00:11:30.680, Speaker A: He's a really, he's extremely good. And I kind of get him a little bit more interested. Ask me a few more questions. And he loses composure for a second, and he responds like, correct, correct, correct. And I had this immediate flashback remembering with the actual candidate had also said, correct, correct. So for me, like, this is, this is proof. Like, I believe this proof.
00:11:30.680 - 00:11:43.314, Speaker A: I don't know if anybody else is convinced, but for me, it's such a rare tick to use this terminology. I don't know. What are the chances? What do you think, Justin? What's the chance that this is Alameda?
00:11:43.434 - 00:12:22.526, Speaker B: I don't know if we can just base it off the correct tweet. I also, I don't, you know, like, this address that deployed the ball token also was the largest holder of Cbeth at one point, I think. And to me, I like, yeah, to your point, I think it's too brazen to assume it's someone from Alameda slash FTX, but it is a page from their playbook. Right? Like, who else can pump? Who else knows how to pump a token is like, alameda can? So, yeah, I don't know. I don't think so. I also, like, frankly, like, I don't know if the deployer did anything wrong here, right? Like, they just pulled the liquidity that they put in. There's no, there's no commitment, locked the liquidity.
00:12:22.526 - 00:12:41.764, Speaker B: I mean, if they're not exploiting anything, they didn't lock the liquidity. The token is notably useless. Anyone that's buying it knows it's a potential rug and it's a meme coin. Like, why is it. Why is it bad? I mean, I I wouldn't do it. It's unethical, but it's not, in my opinion, illegal or uncommon. This is, like, to be expected.
00:12:41.764 - 00:12:56.184, Speaker B: I mean, if you're buying that token, you've got to imagine that this is, like, 50% of the outcomes results in the developer just pulling the liquidity, especially when it's not locked. I mean, even the hamsters token, they locked the liquidity, and that was, you know, that. That's different. So.
00:12:56.564 - 00:13:08.864, Speaker A: Wow, okay, we haven't. We have a. We have a bald apologist here, like, tate, do you agree? Like, is this just. Is this just fair game? Like, should we all just try to. Try to rug pull some users?
00:13:09.644 - 00:13:11.464, Speaker D: It's definitely unethical, right?
00:13:11.844 - 00:13:13.044, Speaker B: Totally, totally.
00:13:13.164 - 00:13:33.572, Speaker D: Yeah. I mean, I guess I think we all knew how this was going to end. Like, this deployer was just kept adding on, like, adding liquidity. And I think at the peak, they had, like, $30 million worth of liquidity, like, $100 million market cap. And then, of course, like, as soon as something pumps, people look for narratives like, oh, my God. Like, this is. This is Brian Armstrong, or this is a Coinbase employee.
00:13:33.572 - 00:13:52.014, Speaker D: He's trying to bring liquidity on chain. Um, and even after the guy rug pulled, I think, on the Twitter account, he was like, oh, like, what are you guys talking about? Like, I never saw the token. Like, I just added liquidity and pulled out. And I think there was, like, actually, like, an exploit for lead swap. Right. Like, a day later. So I guess technically, he also saved.
00:13:52.014 - 00:14:06.496, Speaker D: Technically saved this liquidity from, like, the leadswap exploit. Um, so I don't know, maybe he's like a Giga brain employee, Giga plane, former Alameda employee, or just like, some serial rugger that, like, who knows what's gonna happen to him?
00:14:06.520 - 00:14:14.904, Speaker A: Like, I mean, he had. He has, like, a. He's. It's not a small fish, right? Like, this is a whale. Like, thiki. I don't know if you. You dug in, but it looks like he's.
00:14:14.904 - 00:14:19.928, Speaker A: This is a rich guy. He's got millions of Ethan stable coins.
00:14:19.976 - 00:14:51.550, Speaker C: Yeah, usually what they do is, like, they lock up liquidity for, like, a year. So, like, there is, like, at least a floor of liquidity. And I guess, like, the ethicality of adding and removing liquidity on top of that as a team member is, like, I don't think it's in a vacuum bat the issue was like, what he did was he added, he added twelve and a half million or maybe 15 million of liquidity. So like, it's half ETH, half token. So it was a total around 25 to 30 million on the way up. And then he completely stopped. And then the issue was like towards the end, he started buying even more.
00:14:51.550 - 00:15:12.872, Speaker C: So he bought 1000 ETH. He basically doubled the price at the end. And then while he was buying, he pulled all the liquidity out. I think that's the part where it was like misleading, because he was buying to pick up the price to get other people to come in. And then he pulled liquidity at the last second. So I guess that's like the unethical part, not more so, like adding and removing in itself.
00:15:13.008 - 00:16:00.048, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think the question, you know, some people have been saying is based then on arrival, because, you know, it was supposed to be the safe playground and they put their name on it, regulated company, you know, public company. And we've seen a rug pull and we've also seen a hack. And this is in the first week of existence. So one of the questions that has been going through my head, like every day for the last weeks is when we talk about Defi and decentralized finance, where's the line between just letting things play out? Rule of the jungle, dog eat dog, whatever. Whoever's the biggest scammer kind of wins out versus having some level of centralization that at least, you know, if you do something wrong, we're just going to freeze your coins, we're going to freeze your USDT, and we're going to get it back. And there's some kind of policing going on.
00:16:00.048 - 00:16:07.056, Speaker A: Where do you guys fall on the spectrum of, you know, do we just let it, you know, code is law or. Justin, what do you think?
00:16:07.160 - 00:16:29.648, Speaker B: So I. Yeah, I don't think code is law. I used to, but I don't anymore. And I don't think policing is really sustainable. Like, we saw BSc try to do that at the start. But what happens is all of these bridges, like, anyone can deploy a third party bridge, right? So within moments I can exploit and then bridge out. And so, like, you can't really do anything about that, right? You're rugging.
00:16:29.648 - 00:17:17.248, Speaker B: If you reverse transactions, you end up rugging the people that were supplying liquidity to that bridge. And so to me, I don't think they should set that precedent. I think the risks are expected. I mean, Coinbase had to know what they were doing when they launched it at layer two. Unfortunately, this is the world we live in where developers for better or worse, can deploy whatever they want, no matter how nefarious. Like I'm sure someone's going to fork tornado cash and deploy it on base eventually and there's nothing Coinbase can do to stop that. Maybe they will, but to me I don't think it's really sustainable to start policing because once you open that can of worms, it's really hard to put it back in the box because what's okay, what's not okay, where do you draw the line? What dollar value is acceptable to let get stolen what isn't? So hopefully they don't open that can of worms.
00:17:17.248 - 00:17:28.560, Speaker B: I don't really see them doing it because it seems like a legal nightmare. And the get requests from everyone saying, you know, my funds were stolen, I lost my keys, can you help me out? And I just don't see it being something they can do.
00:17:28.752 - 00:17:39.976, Speaker A: Okay, so you fall in the kind of, you know, you have this lawful and anarchy, you have this three by three pictures and you sound like you kind of fall in the middle of that. You're, you're quite neutral. You've gone from the, how about you thinky, where do you fall on this?
00:17:40.080 - 00:17:42.764, Speaker C: I think they should, you know, police the shit out of it.
00:17:44.984 - 00:17:46.172, Speaker A: Very lawful.
00:17:46.368 - 00:18:16.702, Speaker C: Very lawful. Yeah. I mean I think that, you know, we've experimented a lot with the sort of permissionless, you know, blockchain. I think we should just experiment with like a half permission one. I think if you, as best I mentioned, it is hard to police like the bridges, especially in real time. But like if you just force everyone to KYC before you enter an exit, then they can just keep it inside and like, let's say someone commits a crime and I mean in six months they can come prosecute it. So I guess giving that sort of, as long as they know who's doing it then I don't know.
00:18:16.702 - 00:18:27.142, Speaker C: It's interesting to see because I think the crime aspect of DeFi is definitely an existential risk, at least to regulation the government. So it's cool to see if this is a solution that sort of can coexist in that framework.
00:18:27.278 - 00:18:45.794, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean the way I feel about it is over time we can let code talk more and more because the code will get good enough. We'll have gone through all the hacks possible, we'll have figured out solidity and we won't have as many hacks and we can just let the code talk. But in the meantime, just so we keep things together and don't keep getting hacked by North Korea. We, we maybe want a little bit of centralization.
00:18:47.854 - 00:19:31.914, Speaker B: So if Coinbase succeeds and they launch, this base chain is like the safe chain where you have all the apps you want. Aave is there, Uni is there, whatever you want is there. But you have the security that if you, let's say you lose your keys or you are in a DeFi protocol that gets exploited, Coinbase comes in and saves you. Does that mean like all of the ethical, legal willing to KYC users all migrate there? And that's a huge selling point. And then it's like, who's taking the risk of doing these activities on Mainnet, right? When you can just have the assurances of Coinbase backing you up on their chain? I mean, is that a huge value prop? I mean, to me it seems like it, right? I hold steak deep. It'd be nice to hold it on the base chain if they're going to insure me basically, and willing to help me out if anything happens.
00:19:32.034 - 00:19:55.834, Speaker A: Or is there a world where we just have different countries regulations being more applicable to one l two or another l two? And this is the american ones, this chinese one. This is like, you know, we kind of have the fiat governments managed to claw their way back into the ecosystem. I don't know. Taikin, how do you see it? Taykin, do you think is based on arrival now with all this bad press?
00:19:56.374 - 00:20:39.372, Speaker D: No, I don't really think so. I think when Arbitram first launched, there was that farm, arvinian token, with the Nyan cat, the rainbow cat, and they had like a billion dollars of the TVL because that was the only game in town. And of course the token went to zero. But now Arbitram has the most TVL out of all the l two s. And I can definitely see a scenario. It depends what's Coinbase's goal for launching base? Is it supposed to be this safe playground? And maybe something they can do is maybe they can cap deposits up to 1000, $10,000, and then people can try out lp ing on uniswap curve or aave. And maybe it's not a place for people to make money, it's a place for people to experiment.
00:20:39.372 - 00:21:23.044, Speaker D: And then once people feel comfortable with their risks, they go on Mainnet and then they play the Ponzi games that we all know and love. So if that's the case, I think that's pretty bullish because it kind of obfuscates the Uiux problem, because from a normal normie perspective, having to bridge fiat to Coinbase, convert it into USDC, bridge it to metamask, store your private keys by eat. And dealing with all the complications, that's a huge barrier to entry. And if Coinbase can create the space chain, that's a safe playground. I think it's top of funnel pipeline onboarding process and I think it's a medium to longer term bullish event.
00:21:23.544 - 00:22:05.762, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm looking forward to account abstraction as well in some of these normie procedures. Getting a lot simpler with paying gas and all that stuff being hidden. But staying on the topic of centralization versus decentralization in Defi, one of the original issues that we had was around the OFAC compliance. And I saw this recently, like this week. So hex, which is, you could argue that hex created Uniswap. It was potentially the app that really was traded a lot because centralized exchanges were not willing to list what is kind of a scam coin. And I've said this before, and at this point, Uniswap has delisted it.
00:22:05.762 - 00:22:49.644, Speaker A: So it's turning of the tide. And this is all because this man right here, Richard Hart, who I had the privilege of debating once upon a time, apparently he has finally kind of received a legal consequence for pulse chain and hex. And I don't know, I have mixed feelings about this because, you know, this is the SEC winning, but also I'm not very positive. And Richard Heart and the kind of scams that he's been perpetuating, I don't know if you guys have any feelings about this, but whose side are we on? Like, I'm very conflicted. Are we on side hex or inside sec?
00:22:50.484 - 00:23:15.124, Speaker B: For me, it's side sec. Very clearly. I agree with you that SEC is basically, or, excuse me, hex is basically a scam coin. And I think that SEC should go after these scam projects. I do think it's like a very hard thing to enforce. Right? You can have anonymous developers deploying anything from anywhere and where we can interact with any other country without permission from any government or intermediary. So very hard to enforce in practice.
00:23:15.124 - 00:23:50.840, Speaker B: But when there's something so blatant like hex, I'm all for it. Like, like the ripple case is interesting too, because ripple is basically a scam coin as well, I would argue it doesn't really do anything or function in any way. It just has this crazy high valuation because it's a legacy coin, I guess. And so while I'm very happy that the SEC lost in that case and that XRP is not by default, a security. It's a little bittersweet because XRP is basically a scam token and in some ways operates as a security. Right. Like they are just dumping this token on you and telling you that they're going to drive value to the token token and then never delivering.
00:23:50.840 - 00:23:56.804, Speaker B: So on this one, I'm back in the SEC. But for obviously more meaningful projects, it's a bit different.
00:23:57.504 - 00:24:38.004, Speaker A: I mean, XRP maybe is not quite as bad in the sense of, you know, hex was really putting, you know, posters and sending to people's houses and telling them, put your, put your mortgage and put your house into this. And, you know, this is like a whole other level. I don't know if Taiki or thinki you guys have watched any Richard heart videos, but I'll admit that early in my exploration of crypto days, Richard Heart was this larger than life guy who has all these bombastic videos on YouTube. And people were giving me shit for debating him, but I really wanted to just experience it firsthand and interact with him. And I was a little disappointed. He didn't really have answers to the hard questions that I asked him. I was a little bit deflated.
00:24:38.004 - 00:24:53.604, Speaker A: He was expecting Donald Trump to pull, you know, wow, here we go. Yeah, yeah. Alleges he used 12 million funds to purchase luxury goods. Looks like more than 12 million to me. I don't know.
00:24:55.024 - 00:25:17.854, Speaker D: Yeah, he's, he's kind of selling, isn't hex like a wealth as a service, like a dream as a service? Like there's, he's basically selling the dream, right, to other hex sacrificers or buyers. And I get. Yeah, I mean, because everything's like a spectrum, right? I mean, hex is a scam and XRP is less of a scam, but, you know, there's like a fine line there.
00:25:18.554 - 00:25:41.702, Speaker A: He was very early on, you know, we have to give him credit. He's the godfather of the scams because he made people lock up their tokens for ten years so they couldn't buy. And the longer they lock it up, the more they would get. And it was exponential. So, like, if you only lock for a month, you're getting nothing. But if you lock for ten years, oh, man. Like, just wait ten years and you're going to be exactly what you said he's selling the dream of in ten years.
00:25:41.702 - 00:25:51.074, Speaker A: If you're just patient and you wait, you'll get, you're going to dilute everybody else and be super wealthy. Vicky, have you ever looked at hex much?
00:25:51.814 - 00:26:15.554, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought what they did with polls was really interesting. It's kind of like the lawful evil version of coinbase, I guess, kind of just policing its own ecosystem and, you know, guarding the entries and exits and making sure that only he can sell to his, you know, retail people. I do think it's funny that, like, jody that you like to, you like, hunt these sort of, you know, Ponzi, you know, you got ohm. We got hex like Luna, too.
00:26:17.414 - 00:26:42.710, Speaker A: The communities are the most fun part. They really start attacking you. And I haven't talked about hex in a while, but when I did, I mean, my twitter, like, notifications were. It was. I just had to, like, I think I've blocked thousands of hexagons, and I don't envy. I don't know if you guys follow Eric Wall, but right now he's been commenting about the situation, and there's a lot of angry hexagons, and it's a weird spot. People dig in.
00:26:42.710 - 00:27:26.374, Speaker A: I don't know if you guys have taken any psychology classes in college or anything, but when people are faced with counteracting evidence and it's kind of harsh evidence in their face, people dig in their heels and they double down. And, you know, people are really doubling down now about hex, even though it's. It's obviously like, you know, pulses. It's just a fork of ethereum, and they've created separate versions of every coin, but they're not backed by anything, so. And then the funny one is, like, I don't know if you guys watched it at all, but there was a hex coin on Ethereum, and because it got forked, there was a hex coin on pulse, and people don't know which one to buy, so they both kind of started, like, falling down because, like, which one's real, right?
00:27:26.914 - 00:27:50.382, Speaker B: So this was, um, during, like, the main, the mania phase of this last market cycle. This was a big problem for me. I saw, I built this YouTube channel that got pretty popular. Like, my videos were very well liked. I basically did tutorial videos about Defi protocols and interviewed founders. And I had the privilege of interviewing do Kwon. I was very much not into Tara, similar to you, Jordi.
00:27:50.382 - 00:28:28.094, Speaker B: I didn't call it out publicly, but in a lot of private chats or in, like, my discord community, I called it out, and I found him to be, like, a complete jerk on the interview. I really didn't like this guy, but it was this huge pickle. Like, I decided to just not ever speak about Ust or Terra and, like, the eventual collapse that everyone, frankly, saw as a possible outcome because like, it's just, there's no benefit to it. Everyone hates you. Like, no one's happy about it, you don't gain anything. And so I think that's like, ended up silencing so many people. And like, Jordy, I mean, props to you for being like one of the few people willing to actually call it out because like I'm embarrassed and ashamed a little bit to admit.
00:28:28.094 - 00:28:35.230, Speaker B: Like, I just wanted to avoid the topic. I didn't want anything to do with it because it was a lose lose for me. And you can't win, exactly.
00:28:35.262 - 00:29:17.722, Speaker A: If you have like a place in crypto and you're trying to do any kind of institutional thing, like if you're a VC and you want to get deals or with, even in my position, honestly as a market maker, if you're trying to get some of these coins that maybe it's good for business, like a world coin. The market makers that got world coin, Cellini did not get world coin, unfortunately. I'm sad about it, but if you were one of the five that did get it, I don't know what the call options are going to be worth by the end, but just the gamma hedging, I'm sure they've made a few million dollars apiece. You know, talking about world coin, I'm never going to get the world coin deal. Now. That's, that's, that's pretty, pretty obvious. So, you know, you take, you take a side and you stick with it.
00:29:17.722 - 00:29:26.354, Speaker A: And I hope on this podcast, since, you know, all of us are not trying to be like the VC route, we can kind of keep it a bit real and speak our mind.
00:29:26.514 - 00:29:41.024, Speaker C: Definitely. You definitely have to have kind of like a maybe contrarian sort of personality to take on these communities. And I'm curious, Jordy and maybe Justin, too, like, what was the meanest thing that like, you know, a hexagon or Luna said to you?
00:29:41.364 - 00:30:09.854, Speaker A: So, so this was a good one. So Richard Hart himself, after, after this, this whole thing that played out with, to be honest, I think I destroyed him. People can at their leisure, bring up and watch this video. I think the debate I had with him did not go well for him at all. But he called me a Todd BoD several times during, during this interview. And apparently a Todd BoD. Todd is like a toddler.
00:30:09.854 - 00:30:28.074, Speaker A: And it looks in this video because of the camera that I have like a toddler body. So, you know, the Todd bot, the hexagons took it and ran with it and just called me Todd bot for weeks on Twitter. So, you know, that. That. That was good. I have to give props to Richard on that one.
00:30:28.524 - 00:30:47.108, Speaker B: Yeah, people love to make fun of your appearance, I think do Kwon once retweeted something I said and said I was poor. So, I mean, that. But that was a. You know, he just said that to everyone. So that's not just me, but it's really just the communities, right? Like, going after you on Twitter, comments, I mean, it's just. It's just brutal. Everyone hates you, especially when you're making money, too, you know?
00:30:47.196 - 00:31:14.320, Speaker A: Absolutely. I want to call out take you as well, because actually, the first time I interacted with Taki a few years ago was. Was during the om days, and he was. He was brave enough to kind of feature my article breaking down why om was not going to work. And I remember the first pre call we had, he was in the spot where, like, a lot of my viewers are into ohm. I don't know, like, I'm going to upset them. But, you know, props for you for doing the right thing and, you know, presenting both sides of the argument.
00:31:14.320 - 00:31:18.128, Speaker A: What was going through your head when you were kind of making that decision? Are you. Were you worried?
00:31:18.216 - 00:31:56.898, Speaker D: I mean, I was a little worried, but then I think when we started recording, I was kind of like, you know, fuck it. Like, just let's, like, talk about it. Like, I mean, I still have, like, there's, like, still, like, I have, like, there's faults to be put on me as well because, like, I was. I also drink, like, the Luna USD Kool Aid. But, like, as soon as it started pegging, like, I knew it was over, and I made, like, an apology video, which is pretty rough too, right? But, you know, I guess understanding projects for what they are and understanding, like, when it's going bad, I think it's, like, really important and not having, like, tunnel vision, especially because this. It's so tribal.
00:31:57.066 - 00:32:25.428, Speaker B: I'll also admit it's, like, a little hard to keep that conviction, right? Like, Luna lasted forever. I remember first hearing about it and having doubts, and then when it became, like, a multi billion dollar project, I was like, this is surely gonna blow up. And then you're just wrong for, like, a full year, right? And the community, like, people are just dunking on you for a full year until you're silenced and you're like, huh. Like, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm the problem. Like, this thing is working. Maybe they have achieved some sort of exit velocity and like, Luna is just.
00:32:25.428 - 00:32:32.108, Speaker B: USD is going to be the stable coin, the currency. Maybe they did it, and then, you know, right when you think that, that's when it all crashes.
00:32:32.156 - 00:33:12.616, Speaker A: In my experience, I do feel like it takes a lot out of you to go after these things when there's a large community there, and sometimes even when there's not a large community. There was one scam that some people fell for that I could have called out, and I was just a little bit tired after having gone through all the ones. It was called freeway or something. There was some. Some token that claimed to give you yield based on FX strategies, that they had this, like, amazing effects engine that was making money and, you know, could give you, like, 20, 30% returns. And this is obviously a scam. Like, this is, like, the stereotypical bullshit scam that they always use, which is, oh, we have this amazing trading bot and just give us money.
00:33:12.616 - 00:33:31.328, Speaker A: The reality is, I mean, I had a call with a team. I started doing investigating. I pretended I was interested. Hey, guys, let me, like, let me find out. Yeah, maybe I'll put money in. And I asked them, like, why don't you just raise, like, actual hedge fund capital? Like, that's what people who have profitable trading strategies do. And they're like, oh, no, we want to give it to the people.
00:33:31.328 - 00:33:53.790, Speaker A: It was so full of. But, you know, I just didn't want to deal with. You know, sometimes you can get sued. Like, we saw, like, Zach XBT is getting sued by. By big brother, which, you know, I'm quite upset about, because Zack, I've interacted with him quite a lot, and he's. He's a very legit guy, and if you present to him evidence that he's made a mistake, he. He will correct it.
00:33:53.790 - 00:34:10.704, Speaker A: I've seen him do it. He. He's not gonna pretend that he's right when he's not. And if big brother thought that he had misappropriated and made mistakes, I think he should have dealt with it differently. So that was quite upsetting to me. I don't know if any of you guys followed the Zach thing.
00:34:10.864 - 00:34:47.424, Speaker D: Yeah, it's important because, like, I think the, like, machi big brother, like, doxed him too. Like, zach's last name was on there, and, like, that was also, like, upsetting because he's trying to be, like, this anonymous on chain police. But, like, as soon as he's doxxed, I feel like it kind of gives reasons for, like, other, like, bad actors to, like, maybe threaten them physically and stuff. I think you know, characters like Zach, like, he deserves to be a non and he deserves the community's backing. I haven't really tracked, like, what happened to that case. I think Machi was like, oh, like, I'm not serious. I just wanted an apology or something.
00:34:47.424 - 00:34:58.238, Speaker D: So, like, maybe he's pulling up. But, yeah, I think, like, these rich figures, like, they just, like, use, like. Like, their wealth and money and, like, influence, like, threaten, like, any naysayers.
00:34:58.376 - 00:35:20.370, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I agree. It's disheartening to see a dox for no reason at all, apart from just someone trying to save his reputation and in the process destroying his reputation because Zack is, like, such a beloved community character that it's kind of having this Barbara Streisand effect. I don't know. Think if you follow this Zach drama, if you have any comment on this one.
00:35:20.442 - 00:35:22.094, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. I totally agree with you.
00:35:22.914 - 00:35:26.240, Speaker A: Very common in the tri fight world, in traffic world. How so?
00:35:26.432 - 00:35:31.084, Speaker C: Well, it kind of just, like, you know, intimidating people through legal process.
00:35:32.184 - 00:35:32.624, Speaker B: It's.
00:35:32.664 - 00:35:39.240, Speaker C: Yeah, it's increasingly hard to hide your identity now on chain and, like, you know, actually be anonymous, so.
00:35:39.352 - 00:36:27.674, Speaker A: And we do see that the legal system, like, the trad trad world legal system is so money based that whoever has the most money can just draw it out and just create enough costs that you have to give it in and settle. And I remember Bitboy tried to sue a youtuber last year for a similar thing. He thought that he was being misappropriated. And once Kobe and some of the other community started throwing money at him and gave him a bunch of money, then bit boy backed off because he realized actually his bags are not bags and he wouldn't be able to draw the lawsuit as much as he was hoping. But, yeah, hopefully we see better actors in the future, be supported. Cool. All right, well, let's wrap up with our weekly how Djinn am I? Segment.
00:36:28.134 - 00:36:41.734, Speaker B: So we're changing it up a little bit, and we've decided that Jordy is now going to be the source of truth for grading this. So thicky, Taiki and I are going to be presenting our Dejen plays of the week to Jordy and getting his thoughts.
00:36:41.894 - 00:36:55.076, Speaker A: Like, I'm like the defi boomer, and I don't do Djinn stuff that compares with you guys. Although this week, I have an interesting one to show. But in general, I think you guys are way ahead of me. So let me. Let me judge your dj ness.
00:36:55.260 - 00:37:20.294, Speaker B: Cool. Well, I'll kick things off. I actually switched up my play because I think taiki and I might have had the same one. So I thought of something else. So I'm not sure if you guys saw this kind of blew up on twitter ETH xy. And this is like another one of those land plot sales on crypto total game, right? But this was a hackathon project, I think at ETH CC, that was a finalist or something like that. And you could effectively, like, buy this plot of land.
00:37:20.294 - 00:37:49.566, Speaker B: And when you buy a plot of land, you got a hundred of these ETH xy tokens that you could then redeem for the proceeds of, like, future sales. And the only way to sell your plot of land was if someone buys it from you at two x the price. So I bought a couple of these things at 0.16 ETH or something like that. And one of my plots was purchased, so I made a little on that, and the other one is just still sitting there waiting to get bought. I'll keep you guys posted on if it does or not. But yeah, that's, that's where I'm at.
00:37:49.566 - 00:37:52.966, Speaker B: So my capital is kind of just locked in this thing, but fortunately it's not much at all.
00:37:53.070 - 00:37:57.790, Speaker A: So people just put whatever flags and whatever memes they feel like.
00:37:57.822 - 00:38:12.390, Speaker B: And so I think it's tied to your ens record. So if you set your ens to your address, it'll show the image associated with it. And I'm not going to zoom in because there's some inappropriate images here, but yeah, basically how it works is that the default one?
00:38:12.422 - 00:38:16.006, Speaker C: That one that's, that's like that face, there's like.
00:38:16.110 - 00:38:34.634, Speaker B: I know the default one is actually the color, the rainbows in the background. So that face person is just an ETH xy whale. And if you buy squares together, you get a giant square. So you see, like, there's the base unit, and then, but if you buy multiple ones that are close to each other, you get the whole area and get a larger image. I sound too excited about this. I'm really.
00:38:36.644 - 00:38:40.024, Speaker D: What's the end goal here? Like, metaverse?
00:38:40.724 - 00:39:09.148, Speaker B: I mean, the end goal is basically the same end goal of fault, right? Like, this is just a meme coin, and you hope someone buys at a higher price than you. I mean, the ETH XY, the ERc 20 token that you get from buying a plot is redeemable for treasury value. So the devs actually don't get any money from this. Like, all that he purchased for plots goes to the treasury. But, like, my redemptions are like, per plot, like, it's really not much. So it's. Yeah, definitely.
00:39:09.148 - 00:39:10.624, Speaker B: This thing is faded fast.
00:39:11.124 - 00:39:25.700, Speaker C: There's a. There's a bit of metagaming here because, like, if someone. I'm guessing it turns into a bigger one when you have a two by two and then a three by three. So if you can, like. Yeah, try to snag a corner before they can get the rest, and then you just flip it to them for higher. Like, it's a fun little game you could try to play.
00:39:25.892 - 00:39:39.906, Speaker B: It gets expensive. So this middle plot here, or zero zero, I guess the top left sells for 40.9 ETH. And then if you look at. If we can pull up the center plot, it's something like 100 ETH. It's selling for now. So it's expensive.
00:39:39.906 - 00:39:45.474, Speaker B: I mean, to double each square, doubles each time it's been purchased. So a little out of my budget.
00:39:45.554 - 00:40:04.862, Speaker A: It's a nice. It's a nice flex game. Like, if this picks up, then it's the same as driver license plates, where people want to have, like, in the Middle east, they want to have, like, a single digit one or double digit one. If you're poor, you mentioned that you. You only spent, like, you know, 0.2 ETH or something, and that kind of plays into it.
00:40:04.958 - 00:40:06.374, Speaker B: That's what I'm willing to say publicly.
00:40:06.414 - 00:40:22.486, Speaker A: Jordan, if you had bought the zero zero for 40 ETH, kind of waiting for the flip one day, then that would be higher. You know, this is the same as buying, like, a super cheap kind of NFT. This is, like, a three out of ten. I'm sorry.
00:40:22.630 - 00:40:24.474, Speaker C: So that's tough.
00:40:25.974 - 00:40:36.478, Speaker A: In your defense, Justin, you. You actually had. You said you had Tyke's one, and he took it from you. So that. That could be your defense for. For not being degenerate enough on this.
00:40:36.646 - 00:40:39.234, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll try to come back stronger next week.
00:40:40.054 - 00:40:57.042, Speaker D: Yeah. And, like, yeah, my djmplay, like, it was first highlighted by Justin, and, like, he was looking into, like, the superconductors, right? Like, I'm sure you've heard of, like, this hype on Twitter, but is everyone here aware of, like, what superconductors are? If not, I can kind of explain.
00:40:57.098 - 00:41:04.454, Speaker A: We're all experts by now. Everyone's debating if it's true or not, if they've actually found a room temperature one.
00:41:04.834 - 00:41:40.166, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. Basically, like, modern materials, like, don't allow electrons to flow freely, so it traps, like, the material gets super hot. It, like, wastes a bunch of heat. So if this room temperature superconductor is actually real, I mean, this is, like, a hotly debated topic. And there's a bunch of scientists all across the world trying to replicate, like, whether the material is real or not. But I guess, like, the DJ play here is that there's a bunch of micro cap stocks that kind of play into superconductors. There's one called Amse, which is literally called, like, american superconductor corporation, which is kind of, like, similar to, like, how Internet computer.
00:41:40.166 - 00:42:14.720, Speaker D: Like, ICP is, like, oh, my God. Like, it's computer of the Internet, right? And there's, like, hype around that. Like, AMSC is, like, down 50% in the last 48 hours. But I bought this other small cap, like, micro cap with, like, a $400 million market cap called RGTI, like, rigat, like, righetti computing, which is, like, a quantum computing play. And literally, like, I was, like, bridging fiat to, like, fidelity to try to buy this thing, like, kind of fomoing it. And then, like, when I tried to click buy, fidelity made me go through this process of, like, are you sure? Like, this is a penny stock. It's, like, very risky.
00:42:14.720 - 00:42:56.878, Speaker D: And then it gave me, like, a warning of, like, your purchase can cause slippage, and, like, you're gonna get, like, bad price execution. And then, like, I think, like, every group chat is, like, trying to look into this, and, like, I just like, aped RGTI, which is, like, a $400 million market cap stock. It was formerly a spacious, so it launched at $10 in nuked to a dollar, and now it's trading at $3. And I never paid attention in physics class, but I'm like, okay. It kind of reminds me of in Q one of 2020, no one really was paying attention to COVID, unless you're on Twitter. And then this whole superconductor thing, it's only a thing on Twitter. If you talk to regular people.
00:42:56.878 - 00:43:08.136, Speaker D: They don't really know what they are. I mean, of course, if the science is, like, fake, like, every stock is gonna go down, like 50% because they're all kind of, like, vaporware. But if it's real, then maybe, like.
00:43:08.160 - 00:43:09.024, Speaker A: The risk is asymmetric.
00:43:09.064 - 00:43:12.152, Speaker D: So I aped rgti. So how do you rate this?
00:43:12.168 - 00:43:16.448, Speaker A: Jody, how much slippage did you end up paying? This is an important question.
00:43:16.616 - 00:43:19.244, Speaker D: I think I pay, like, 2%. 2% slippage.
00:43:19.544 - 00:43:22.632, Speaker A: Pay 2% slippage by a mic on.
00:43:22.648 - 00:43:24.184, Speaker D: A stock, though, right? Like, that's kind of crazy.
00:43:24.224 - 00:43:37.196, Speaker B: So can I just say to redeem myself for the last one, that I actually went above and beyond Tyke and I bought call options that are, like, expire in two weeks. So I'm just putting it out there. I would have probably surpassed him a little on the score.
00:43:37.260 - 00:43:55.236, Speaker A: You would have zero day call options on the micro cap. You know, this is. This is a. This is a four. I'm a little bit disappointed. I think the call options would have been, like, a six or seven would have been quite a bit higher. 2% slippage helps.
00:43:55.236 - 00:44:05.468, Speaker A: It helps. I'll give you a solid five because of the slippage. I don't know how much size you showed to get that 2% slippage, but it sounds like it was a reasonable purchase.
00:44:05.636 - 00:44:14.624, Speaker C: This guy was saying buy out of money calls and obscure shit goes. And then use Chad's BT to write, like, research to dump on archive and then show the comments.
00:44:15.844 - 00:44:26.276, Speaker A: That works well, thank you. I don't know what you have for us, but, you know, the field is open. You know, you can get past the five.
00:44:26.460 - 00:44:28.064, Speaker D: We set the bar.
00:44:29.284 - 00:44:53.184, Speaker C: I don't think I did anything superheat. I think yesterday, like, after. After the curve situation, I really. I genuinely thought Kane's tweet was, like, very market moving. So I think at, like, 1843, I bought, like, 15k worth of, like, one day or just zero day options on BTC or. Sorry, expiring 1850. And then, like, literally ten minutes later, like, the BNP news came out and I just.
00:44:53.184 - 00:45:01.932, Speaker C: A bit unfortunate. If I bought the options, maybe. Maybe 20 minutes later, I think they would have ended in the money, but, yeah. Fifteen k. I was reading yesterday, where.
00:45:01.948 - 00:45:03.944, Speaker A: Do you buy these zero day options?
00:45:05.044 - 00:45:06.184, Speaker C: I buy one by.
00:45:07.004 - 00:45:12.780, Speaker A: Okay, this is just like a normal weekly expiry and happen to be, like, the next day. Or do they actually have, like, zero day options?
00:45:12.892 - 00:45:19.514, Speaker C: They actually have one in two day rolling options now, mainly for DJ's.
00:45:20.134 - 00:45:34.194, Speaker A: Wow. Okay. But it's on the major. You know, you just bought it on bitcoin. I mean, I'm a little bit disappointed, guys. You know?
00:45:36.374 - 00:45:37.390, Speaker B: I'm so sorry.
00:45:37.502 - 00:45:48.810, Speaker A: We're so sorry. I think Justin's call options actually went out. Even though he. And present them. I have to give the prize there. And I'll show you. I'll show you what real Degen looks like.
00:45:48.810 - 00:46:12.074, Speaker A: So, you know, let's put a chart up there. This is the korean market after curve stopped deposits. So when curve was crashing, the rest of the world was in disarray. Curve was going to zero right around this point in the middle of the curve. In the middle of the chart. Sorry. The Koreans decided to.
00:46:12.074 - 00:46:44.614, Speaker A: The doors are locked. Nobody can get in. Nobody can get out. And they gave curve legitimate. What is that, like a 40% pump? And just ripped the face out of anybody within that locked ecosystem. This is what real degeneracy looks like. You have a coin that you know is losing value rapidly, but because there's nobody in deposit to dump on you, you start playing these, like, games of, you know, trying to, trying to make a pump.
00:46:44.614 - 00:46:55.858, Speaker A: The korean curve play is a ten out of ten. No questions. I did not participate personally, but this is the kind of stuff that, you know, I hope you guys bring to us next week.
00:46:55.946 - 00:46:57.334, Speaker C: Were you market making it?
00:46:57.954 - 00:47:23.168, Speaker A: I cannot confirm or deny any market making activities, but, and thankfully I was not because any kind of signal from the rest of the world, you know, you try to use a binance price to price this, you would get destroyed. Because they don't, they don't care what binance is doing. When nobody can do a loop and deposit and then, like, sell it and sell out, nobody. Nobody could do that.
00:47:23.336 - 00:47:41.124, Speaker B: Thank God for Chainlink. Well, with that, I think a successful episode two is in the books.
