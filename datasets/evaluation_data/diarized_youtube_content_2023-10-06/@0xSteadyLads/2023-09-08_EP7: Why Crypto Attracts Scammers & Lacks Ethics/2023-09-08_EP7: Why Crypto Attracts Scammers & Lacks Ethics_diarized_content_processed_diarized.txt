00:00:20.440 - 00:00:52.328, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody, to another episode of Steady Lads. Unfortunately, there's no handsome crypto cred with us this week, so an absence of that. And because I'm in Korea and I'm seeing a lot of beautiful faces around, I've asked everybody, those of you watching on YouTube, you can see that everyone has touched up their appearance, which is a nice kind of plug in for webcam. So we're all looking pretty spiffy. I'm also having one grape an hour so I can start to feel like, you know, fit and thin. Justin, are you doing any. Are you taking care of yourself?
00:00:52.446 - 00:00:59.924, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. Reintroduce creatine into my workout regimen. It makes a big difference. So. Doing what I can.
00:01:00.044 - 00:01:02.780, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. I. How about you, Thikki?
00:01:02.892 - 00:01:06.064, Speaker C: Yeah, I just started working it again, you know, drinking water.
00:01:06.524 - 00:01:10.028, Speaker A: Taiki, your. Your. Your touch up looks like you're wearing lipstick, though.
00:01:10.076 - 00:01:10.704, Speaker C: It's.
00:01:12.084 - 00:01:32.316, Speaker D: Yeah, my. For some reason, mine looks. Maybe it's the lighting. My looks ridiculous, but I'm, like, not really taking care of myself. There's, like, this new eat to earn app, like, in New York, so I've been getting pizza and ice cream every single day to farm these real, like, real life tokens. So I'm definitely going to be, like, gaining weight, and I'll probably, like, break out pimples wise in a few weeks.
00:01:32.460 - 00:01:37.716, Speaker A: How does it track that? You're eating it? Like, you can just order it and just collect points or how does it know?
00:01:37.860 - 00:02:07.664, Speaker D: So you go to, like, these restaurants and they have these NFC chips and you tap in and you get tokens every time you go and purchase an item. And then there's, like, a pizza joint and, like, an ice cream shop, like, minutes from each other. So I spent, like, hitting up that spot every single day with, like, a few other friends just farming these points and because no one knows about it. So I guess, like, talking about it, like, it's, like, diluting my yield, but the amount of tokens you get is, like, insane right now. So I actually think that in a few months, this can be, like, one of the most talked about apps.
00:02:07.964 - 00:02:12.460, Speaker B: You need to not eat the food or just buy it for someone else in the store just to farm the points.
00:02:12.612 - 00:02:15.556, Speaker D: Yeah, I thought about that, but I love pizza too much.
00:02:15.660 - 00:02:21.396, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure Adam Cochran is going to start showing up to your local pizza shop now and trying to farm the airdrop.
00:02:21.460 - 00:02:28.084, Speaker D: Yeah, he's gonna. He's gonna bring, like, ten phones and, like, he's gonna be tapping one in one and one each every single time. Yeah, I can definitely see that.
00:02:28.164 - 00:02:45.060, Speaker A: I haven't been taking too care of myself either. It's been rough with the jet lag. Flying back to Asia. I tried to get a massage. I show up, and, you know, I asked for a 90 minutes massage. First time in my life, I show up, and they got a dude instead of a girl to do the massage. They just didn't ask.
00:02:45.060 - 00:02:58.470, Speaker A: Like, they normally. They'll double check. They're like, we only have a male therapist. Is that okay? And I always say, no, I don't want to be touched by hairy arms. I want, like, a nice touch. And so that did not distress me at all. And then I went for a haircut.
00:02:58.470 - 00:03:10.502, Speaker A: I asked for a number three, which is like, you know, it's pretty chunky. It's not a tight. And then she starts, like, taking off. Like, I can see my skin. It's like, I feel like an army kid. And I'm like, no, three. Three.
00:03:10.502 - 00:03:22.420, Speaker A: And she's like, oh, I thought. I thought you said three. 3 mm. Which is, like, a number one. It's, like, literally, like, what the army does. And she's like, well, it's too late. She's, like, translating on the app, like, in Korea, and she's like, it's too late.
00:03:22.420 - 00:03:23.664, Speaker A: You're fucked. Basically.
00:03:25.164 - 00:03:47.994, Speaker B: You know, jordy, it's funny you mentioned that. I got a massage just two weeks ago at my local massage envy, and my girlfriend booked it for me. And the name was sort of ambiguous, so we thought it was going to be a female. I show up, and I look up, and he says, built, six foot three, good looking guy, extremely muscular. And I'm like, oh, shit. And, you know, I didn't say anything. I just went through with it.
00:03:47.994 - 00:03:56.014, Speaker B: And the whole time, I just felt like George from that Seinfeld episode. If you guys are familiar. George?
00:04:00.714 - 00:04:02.614, Speaker C: Yes. I'm Raymond.
00:04:04.954 - 00:04:05.734, Speaker B: Hello.
00:04:08.034 - 00:04:09.014, Speaker A: Oh, boy.
00:04:09.714 - 00:04:13.254, Speaker B: You know what? I should open those pants. It's going to be a lot easier that way.
00:04:15.314 - 00:04:47.364, Speaker A: Cool. So, yeah, we wanted to talk a little bit today. There's a relevant headline I think we just saw. Ryan Salameh has pleaded guilty, so the dominoes are starting to fall in the FTX case. So FTX obviously, is determined the fate of our 2023 in many ways. And a lot of it can be stemmed back to, you know, an ethical decision that SBF potentially made. You know, we saw his posters all over the place where he.
00:04:47.364 - 00:05:29.594, Speaker A: He claimed that, you know, he's in crypto for good. Why? Why are you in crypto? Why are you why are you making all this money? I'm gonna save the world. You know, we're gonna develop vaccines and get mosquito nets, and we're going to solve AI, which, you know, he may actually end up helping on the I front, because out of all the shit he's done, the one good thing is possibly investing in anthropic. But I think this is a topic that's very under discussed. I did try to Google and go to YouTube and search crypto ethics, and there's basically nothing. There's people talking about bitcoin, maxi stuff before we dive in. I don't know, Justin, is it the topic that you think about daily or weekly or once, once a year?
00:05:30.494 - 00:06:06.780, Speaker B: Yeah, I think about it all the time. I think the really tricky part is there's, like, anon arbitrage. If you're anon, ethics are not necessary. Right. You can sort of do whatever you want on Twitter or whatever it may be, launch your own project anonymously. And then if it doesn't work out, if it does work out and you want to exit prematurely, let's say you could do that, and then you can just create a new Persona. There's also, like, a geographic arbitrage where obviously, some jurisdictions don't have the same regulations that we have in the US, and it makes it really tricky.
00:06:06.780 - 00:06:49.340, Speaker B: It's like a really tough landscape to navigate, to discern, like, which anons can you trust? Which people can you trust? And what's also interesting on that is, like, the people that quote, unquote rugged, the most, like SPF, doquan. There are very public people in jurisdictions that didn't allow that behavior. So I do think about it all the time. I do think it's sort of a murky topic and not. Not talked about enough because we definitely, in this industry, highlight and in some ways, like, love the scammers. Right? Like, we in some ways are responsible for do Kwon for promoting his tweets and not us here, but just the general community for promoting his tweets and making him such a big public figure. And, of course, it's not just him.
00:06:49.340 - 00:06:58.464, Speaker B: The list goes on, but for some reason in crypto, people are attracted to those big, controversial personalities that are willing to say and do unethical things.
00:06:59.404 - 00:07:43.570, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think part of the problem is that we don't even know exactly where the lines are because these things, you know, Keone put a nice tweet out. Hopefully we can put up. I think you said something like, it's all social consensus, doesn't matter if it's code, like, all this math, all this other stuff that we're doing, it's just trying to help us. But ultimately, it comes down to social consensus, and, you know, we'll talk a little bit about the poker world. You know, me and Taiki have kind of been in that world, and there's a lot of shifting ethics in that world, as well. But before that, Thaki, I know you've had some run ins with the law recently. What have you been experiencing lately? I know it's been anon who has since deleted his account has put a bunch of stuff out of context, and you've been dealing with some of the fallout from that.
00:07:43.642 - 00:08:22.068, Speaker C: He didn't delete his account. It was suspended for violating Twitter rules. But, yeah, I think we hit this point in the bear market where we run out of coins to trade, so it's time to pvp each other on the social forum. So a lot of people were just hurling insults at everyone else. I think there's maybe just a little bit of pent up anger and boredom. But, yeah, somebody clipped an interview of mine, and, like, I almost feel like it was kind of, like a mass media sort of social media attack where they, like, completely clip it out of context to, like, paint a sort of picture. But, yeah, it kind of went viral.
00:08:22.068 - 00:08:38.443, Speaker C: I had, like, you know, 350,000 views on Twitter. But, like, it basically was a clip of me saying that. Like, it tried to imply that, like, I was pretty much just going to shield narratives and dump on people in the bull market, which was, like, completely opposite of what I was trying to say.
00:08:39.063 - 00:09:04.474, Speaker A: Yeah, listen to the full clip. And you're literally saying the exact opposite. You're like, you shouldn't do this. And then you're kind of talking about examples and what's going on out there. This guy definitely looks like he has a vendetta. And for those of us that are semi public or doing something publicly in any way, there is always this risk that someone takes a personal vendetta against you. And I don't know if you.
00:09:04.474 - 00:09:14.294, Speaker A: I don't know if Justin or Taiki, you've ever had anybody take offense to something. Taiki, you're, like the cleanest person in the whole space. So I can't imagine this has happened to you, but maybe. Has it? I don't know.
00:09:15.034 - 00:10:03.940, Speaker D: Yeah, there's, like, this one moment in 2021 when I was, like, my YouTube channel was growing, and I was, like, talking about farming on Polygon because the yields there were just insane. And there was, like, this one particular farm called dinosaur that I made a bunch of videos on. And I kept making videos, and I'm like, okay, I've talked about this form for so long, how can I ethically sell my tokens? So I did a live stream, I think, on a Sunday, saying, hey, on Monday I'm going to sell my tokens, so feel free to dump on me on Sunday. So I did a live stream, and then on Monday, I sold, and the entire token just dumped 30, 40%. And then I got all the hate for it. Like, guys, like, I literally said, I'm gonna sell. And then I think I was, like, pretty new to this.
00:10:03.940 - 00:10:27.324, Speaker D: So with all the hate, I got really angry and I was, like, fighting with these people online. But, you know, like, all these people, I guess they're all, like, behind these anon accounts. You know, it's really easy to target, like, a semi public figure. But I think the best course of action is to, like, just not pay attention to it. Like, because, you know, talking about it just brings more attention. So that's kind of what I try to do now.
00:10:27.984 - 00:10:59.138, Speaker A: So, I mean, I think it's understandable that when it comes to money, people can sometimes get, you know, very touchy. I think about this stuff daily, and this is kind of why I wanted to do this episode. It's something that I don't see talked about at all. And it's a murky subject because, you know, there's so many gray lines. I think ultimately, what I always bring it back to is that we're like animals. Even if we're social animals, we're still like homo sapiens and were filled with instincts. And the two main ones are to procreate and survive and procreate.
00:10:59.138 - 00:11:43.504, Speaker A: You kind of survive long enough to pass on your genes. And that's why we all exist today, because we've had thousands of ancestors and monkeys and bacteria that have kind of managed to do that. And resources, money are part of surviving. And unfortunately for men especially, it's also part of attracting a mate, right? Like, women are drawn to people who have resources because they can then provide for their children. And it might sound like I'm going off topic, but once you, like, see this and see the world and see all the, you know, whether it's do Kwan, no matter what it is, if we start looking at things in this perspective, you can't unsee it. Like, I don't know, have you guys ever kind of looked into evolutionary biology and this kind of stuff?
00:11:43.804 - 00:12:26.524, Speaker D: I mean, I've, like, seen, I mean, I think everything we do, especially with money, is it relates to the fight or flight response. It kind of plays with our emotions, where if we see something pumping, it activates something in our brain, and we're like, oh, my God, I have to buy this thing. And when something's dumping, it's like, oh, my God, I have to run away. And it's something I deal with all the time. I think playing a bunch of poker in my teens has allowed me to numb my emotions when it comes to money. And the psychology of money is pretty interesting. But, yeah, I mean, I never thought about, like, crypto and how it relates to, like, procreation and survival, but I guess it does make sense if you think about, like, practical, like, or, like, just managing emotions in general.
00:12:27.024 - 00:12:56.564, Speaker B: I'm not sure if you guys have read 48 laws of power, but this really reminds me of one of the laws. I forget which number, but it's basically court attention at all costs. And I think that's, like, a really interesting lesson that people, like very much take to heart on crypto, Twitter. And just in our community, like, in our community, it is, you're rewarded if you're known. It doesn't matter if you're known for good or for bad, you're just rewarded. And this isn't just crypto, right? It's also, like, just standard venture and building in tech and whatnot. Like, a great example is the founder of WeWork.
00:12:56.564 - 00:13:37.906, Speaker B: WeWork, obviously, is sort of a train wreck now, but the founder was able to successfully raise because he's well known. And so I think there's just this huge incentive misalignment where if you're always doing the right thing, if you're always ethical and talking ethically right, it's less controversial. People are less interested in reading it. Like, people want the do Kwan personality. And, you know, I think in some ways, like, our community built him versus he built up himself. Like, I don't think he started off as this sort of, like, boisterous, like, obnoxious, rude, arrogant person. I think, you know, he started sending some tweets that might have been on the line, and those tweets are the ones that did the best.
00:13:37.906 - 00:14:05.296, Speaker B: And he realized, well, this is what the people want, and it's probably a subconscious thing. It's like a stimulus response, right? Like, you're getting the right response, and so your. Your behavior starts trending towards that direction. I mean, you see that on YouTube, right? Like, if we did, we could easily bump our views up by doing a ridiculous thumbnail where we all have, like, the crazy faces. We could add a click bait, baity like title. We could talk about unethical things and do unethical things, and we'd get. We'd have, like, a better reception and what we did, we'd have more views.
00:14:05.360 - 00:14:43.154, Speaker A: So, I mean, let's talk about ethics, because, you know, when it comes to survival, it ties in. The thing you mentioned about do Kwan is an example where the gang, the cavemen, you know, the village is basically, you know, seeing a strong leader that's, you know, hunting for us. He's gonna make us all prosperous. This is the caveman feeling, and so we're all supporting him. There's this kind of gang mentality, and then as soon as it's actually bad, like, he's doing something that is going to bring enemies or it's going to harm us. How quickly sentiment shifts. And we've seen this do Kwon with Sue, with a bunch of other people that have taken that initial role.
00:14:43.154 - 00:15:14.874, Speaker A: And then when things were going bad, the amount of hate that they get is equal or greater to the love that they were getting before. And when it comes to ethics, one thing that I'm a Sam Harris fan, he talks about how ethics are fully subjective. Like, there is nothing objective, even something that we consider to be common sense. Like, you know, we shouldn't eat each other. Like, you know, cannibalism is bad. It's something that is innate, right? Like, we. We don't like cannibalism because if we started eating each other, we.
00:15:14.874 - 00:15:41.148, Speaker A: We wouldn't thrive as a society. But if you're stuck on some island and you're not going to get rescued for five days and you're. You're going to starve to death, and the only way to survive is to, like, you know, eat somebody, and you just kind of. I don't know how you do it. If you do it randomly or how you do it, but you just choose somebody and you eat them, and then you survive, it's obviously, like, an awful thing to do. But, you know, we've seen it in movies where that kind of situation arises. Probably happened in real life in some cases.
00:15:41.148 - 00:15:47.864, Speaker A: And I don't know if you can blame somebody or should they all just sit there and starve? Like, it's a very gray area.
00:15:48.204 - 00:16:26.320, Speaker D: I actually, like, took a class in business school called ethics, and it's, like, called utilitarianism. Like, you had to benefit, like, the most amount of people, and it doesn't really matter how you get there, but in, like, the example, it's like, if there's ten people and if no one eats each other, like, ten people are gonna die. Or if one person gets eaten, like, nine people survive, then ethically, you should eat this person, hypothetically. So, yeah, I do agree. Ethics, especially in crypto, I think. I mean, for now, right? Like, no crypto assets are quote unquote securities. So even things like insider trading is technically not illegal.
00:16:26.320 - 00:16:46.126, Speaker D: But, you know, if we all think about it, right? I mean, like, most crypto tokens are securities, so it should be illegal. So, like, what do you guys think about, like, all the insider trading that happens in crypto? Like, have you experienced, like, opportunities to insider trade? Like, have you taken them? Like, how do you manage, like, these profit opportunities, like, when they come up?
00:16:46.230 - 00:17:19.539, Speaker A: I mean, I think in something like insider trading, it reminds me a lot of poker, because in poker, if you're playing against an opponent and, you know, he can't hide his cards, or, you know, he's just so totally drunk and he's just kind of giving away money, you can say, okay, I'm going to get up. I'm going to, I'm going to get away from this table. I don't want to play against this guy. Like, you know, he's some, let somebody else take his money. Or if your goal is to be a professional player and that's how you make a living, you're in the game. You have to play. That's what you're doing.
00:17:19.539 - 00:17:55.044, Speaker A: And if someone's playing very awful against you and giving you an advantage, insider trading. Somewhere along that line where the US regulators have said it's illegal when it comes to actual securities in crypto, it's an open secret that every announcement is front run. We can see it in the price, every single thing that comes out. Like, oh, clearly somebody knew this half an hour ago, especially when it comes to projects. So you have ten people working on a project. They're telling their friends, hey, we're going to announce v two. Or this is especially during the bull market.
00:17:55.044 - 00:18:25.214, Speaker A: I would say nowadays announcements are probably bearish. It's sell the news. But I have personally, like, heard, you know, this project is gonna announce something and bought and, you know, I don't know that that is wrong. Maybe in ten years, once, you know, there's different laws about this, maybe it will be wrong. I don't know. How about you guys? Have you heard any rumors and traded upon them?
00:18:25.514 - 00:18:52.504, Speaker D: I think they all, like, do it, like, subconsciously. Like, I never, like, if I know it's like, asymmetric info and it's insider trading. I try not to participate just because I don't want to do anything that can be considered unethical. But if I'm scouring discords and I talk to the team and they say, oh, yeah, this, and this is going to happen in two weeks, then, yeah, I think that's information that I've earned.
00:18:52.624 - 00:19:15.054, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great point, because the US law takes the position that it's the, it's the responsibility of the CEO of, like, the insiders to not disclose to outsiders. And if you happen to find that information, it's not necessarily, you know, you did something wrong, somebody else did something wrong, that by passing it to you and, you know, maybe you're facilitating them.
00:19:15.094 - 00:19:37.854, Speaker B: But, yeah, it's a really interesting question. I've never personally done it. I don't really buy any coins besides ETH, mostly. But it is a really interesting question, Tyche. Like, if, if the discord has 100 people in it and the founder shares some information with those 100 people, like, guys, this is an alpha leak. Next week we're announcing this huge update. You know, that discord is so small relative to the rest of the market.
00:19:37.854 - 00:20:20.824, Speaker B: Is that ethical to share there? Like, yes, theoretically, anyone could have logged into that discord, but they probably didn't. Most people aren't tracking that stuff. Most people don't care. And, yeah. Is it ethical to do that? As a founder, I mean, I would argue that, like, if you're just in the discord and you come across something, you know, sure, that's public enough that it's, it's fine, but it definitely, we have this culture of, like, everyone wants to share alpha leaks, right? And there's some sort of gray area there of, like, what's fair to share and what isn't and who do you tell? But, yeah, it's, it's definitely ripe. This industry is ripe with fraud. I don't think it's right to trade on insider information personally, even if it may be legal currently.
00:20:20.824 - 00:20:34.608, Speaker B: I mean, it's tough to say. Like, you know, I think with the Coinbase case, the insider traders were accused of defrauding coin. So I think there's always ways to go after, like, unethical actors if they're based in a jurisdiction where you can do it.
00:20:34.696 - 00:21:21.654, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great example, though. So, like, if you, if you're working on an exchange and you're the one that knows what's going to get listed and you trade on it, we've seen people go to jail. Right. So, like, this is like, very serious, but at the same time, a lot of the heroes of, you know, crypto, Twitter have made most of their money by, you know, hacking, or not exactly hacking, but you figuring out when something's about know to list in Korea or somewhere else, and they'll check the websites and the pre configured symbol slash, whatever, and they'll figure out that there's going to get listed. We don't treat them as criminals. They're just smart traders using any information to make profitable trade. So this is such a gray area.
00:21:21.654 - 00:21:29.436, Speaker A: And the line is probably drawn at like, you know, actually being an insider versus not, I don't know, take you. What's your take?
00:21:29.620 - 00:21:44.764, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. I think, like, normally in security stealings, like, any communication to the public is like, in a very structured and regimented form. So, like, a CEO's never go to, like, tell a discord room, like, oh, yeah, we're gonna do this.
00:21:44.804 - 00:21:44.980, Speaker B: Right?
00:21:45.012 - 00:22:03.710, Speaker C: Like, that's just, it usually has to come out like some sort of broadcast that everyone can see and some like, you know, central Forum. So I think it does, like, add a lot of murkiness. Like, let's say some team member tells you like, oh, the launch is going to come out here and they can. You don't know whether, like, he's told like, 20 other people, 50 other people. We don't know it's public or not. And it definitely gets tricky.
00:22:03.822 - 00:22:41.276, Speaker A: Yeah. I want to get your guys thoughts on influencing as well. You know, we're all semi niche Internet celebrities, whatever, whatever the phrase is. So, you know, we potentially, you know, we can talk about something and it'll get attention, and attention leads to some people end up buying it or, you know, at least looking at it, getting involved in some way. And because, like you said, attention is part of power in the sense, like, you know, you have influence and power comes responsibility. And so at the same time, you want to create content. Let me just go through a list of ideas and see what you guys think.
00:22:41.276 - 00:22:59.384, Speaker A: Is this okay or not okay? Right? So what if you're sharing a trading idea that you're putting on, or you just put it on, you went long some coin, you have some thesis behind it, and then you tweet about it. Do any of you guys think that that's not okay?
00:22:59.724 - 00:23:33.776, Speaker D: I think that's okay. I mean, Twitter or just any social media is a platform to share ideas and you're just putting an idea out there, I think, where, like, not okay. As if you have, like, some undisclosed paid allocation from the team, and you're, like, tweeting some ticker and, like, you dump on followers. Like, that's definitely not okay. But if you're, like, sharing trade ideas on anything over, like, $500 million market cap or something, I guess it also depends on the size of the coin, too. I think it's generally okay, but it's up to, like, the person to, like, you know, interpret, like, that information.
00:23:33.840 - 00:23:55.254, Speaker A: Right? And what if you don't say that? What your exit point is? Like, you just say, hey, I'm entering here. You're not going to tell people, let's say people follow you and the thing doubles over the next couple of weeks, and you're like, okay, well, now it's fairly priced. I'm going to exit left. And you just sell. You don't talk about it again. Are you supposed to disclose that you got out after or before or.
00:23:55.714 - 00:24:24.410, Speaker C: Yeah, it's kind of tricky. I mean, it's really ambiguous because obviously the timing of when you sell matters. If you tweet something and then you sell it, like, 30 minutes later, I think that's not good because, like, you're literally just using your followers as ex liquidity. So, yeah, I think. I think the timing is kind of subjective, like, what's good and what isn't. I mean, but, like, it feels like it's wrong. I feel like you should be able to, like, if you spot an inefficiency to, like, just, like, share it with other people.
00:24:24.410 - 00:24:28.850, Speaker C: So, yeah, I think it's really tricky, tricky, tricky thing.
00:24:29.042 - 00:25:03.662, Speaker B: I think it personally is usually wrong. So, like, if you're, like, osaka, like, he's notorious for this on Twitter, right? Like, if he tweets about a coin, it will go up. Presumably he's filled right before it and he can start dumping immediately. Like, there's, like, no restrictions on that at all. I also think it's very dependent on the conduct of the actual message. Like, if you were to write a thread about why you have a thesis for Baker and you're now long maker, and there's, like, a fundamental thesis there that you're sharing and people, like, are reading that and it can decide whether they buy into that thesis or not. That's very different than just tweeting.
00:25:03.662 - 00:25:34.278, Speaker B: Like, you know, MKR just hit, like, support levels. It's going to pump from here, and then you just dump it the next day. Right. So I think it very much depends on how the messages are conducted and what your audience is like. Do you. Most people know what their audience is like, like, for any of us here, we probably don't have the ability or would we ever, like, you know, start pumping some random shitcoin? But if we had a fundamental thesis that we're sharing, that's a little bit different, in my opinion. So I think it's, you know, this is still a gray area, and it's very case by case.
00:25:34.366 - 00:26:03.184, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. It's super gray area. I think the only thing that people generally, you know, we've collectively as a caveman group, agreed that is bad is when, you know, and certain of the larger actors who were accused of this during the last cycle is you talk very bullishly just so you can exit. You know, you're actively trying to exit and you're like, oh, the market's feeling bullish this week. It's going to be a big week, but you're actually, like, specifically trying to get liquidity for. For fills. Like, you're sitting on the ask.
00:26:05.244 - 00:26:05.532, Speaker C: Is.
00:26:05.548 - 00:26:28.408, Speaker A: That okay if somebody, like Sisyphus or Dejan Spartan, like, some of these guys who actively say, like, I will dump on you, they're like, pre warning you that you're flying on Sisyphus air lies or that you're going to get dumped on. So they're giving you that warning. It's, like, really visible. But does that absolve them of this, or is that okay? I don't know.
00:26:28.576 - 00:26:58.454, Speaker B: Well, at some point, people have to take personal responsibility for their own actions. So, like, you know, you're the one clicking the button to buy and executing the order. And, like, I very much believe people should be held accountable for that. And, like, the responsibility falls on them to do their own due diligence. And that's, like, how what? I believe in theory, but in practice, that's not how most people operate in this space. Most people just, you know, take the lower band IQ approach, or maybe it's the higher band IQ approach of, like, oh, big Twitter person just tweeted about this. Bye bye.
00:26:58.454 - 00:27:04.062, Speaker B: Bye. So, yeah, I think generally it's definitely not ideal.
00:27:04.238 - 00:27:54.380, Speaker D: Yeah, they're like social games, too, where I think there was this article called Hand of Hasaka, which dropped 2021, where someone did, like, some research report of, okay, like, whenever Hasaka tweets a ticker, it goes up, like, 5%. And, like, all the bots build around, like, built around that. And then even, like, the Sisyphus Airlines meme. I'm not sure where people fall in terms of how they view Sisyphus, but he's usually on top of narratives, and everyone understands that if Sisyphus talks about something, it'll pump, and then it'll dump at some point, and then people try to play, okay, if I buy now, is it gonna pump more? Should I sell now? And there's this weird social element, and I think that's part of the fun on Twitter. I think. I'm not sure, like, if people view Sisyphus as, like, a nice guy, but he's, like, a fun character to, like, follow just because, you know, he does have so much influence in the markets.
00:27:54.492 - 00:28:17.584, Speaker A: Yeah. So, in a way, it's sort of like, are we surprised by. By the. The behavior? Right? Like, if it's somebody that's supposed to be a leader that we're following, that, you know, telling us what to do, and then they dump on us, that's bad. It's like, you know, Teddy KGB, when he's like, you take me, check, check, check, and then you take me. It's not tonight. This son of beats all night.
00:28:17.584 - 00:29:39.744, Speaker A: He trapped me. Well, you feeling satisfied now, Teddy? But, you know, if it's a case where everybody knows that, you know, this is going to be like a. I mean, DWF, we've seen the most brazen tweets lately, where Gratov is just saying today, this amazing tweet. So here we have, like, DWF basically telling us that maybe, you know, they're not saying it's them, but they're saying, wow, did you notice that there is a new coin pump and dumping every day? And it seems to be happening all the time? I mean, in a way, like what you said, taiki, like, there's an entertainment element. Like, when people bet on sports, you know, they want to participate in this opportunity to predict the outcome or get the right direction and win money. And if we had two worlds, like, one world where the market's just dead, every coin is quiet, every coin is going sideways for days on end versus what we have now, where you can call it market manipulation, but there's a game to play. People are showing up because cyber, or whatever coin it is of that day, is getting thicky out of bed, and he's trying to figure out what DWF is going to do with it and when they're going to dump it, and it creates a sport for us, in a way.
00:29:39.744 - 00:29:47.464, Speaker A: Thiki, how do you feel about the sport? Is it an opportunity? Is it fully bad? Is it kind of.
00:29:47.884 - 00:30:22.442, Speaker C: That's a tough one. I mean, it does create a game to play, and if it's socially accepted and who's to say it's wrong or right, especially with security's laws being so unclear. And it does present an opportunity for people to train on. I do think, net, though, the amount of value capture that they get from having this asymmetric ability to just corner the market or maybe they're affiliated with a team, probably not good for just the overall space and long term health, but it's the only thing that's happening right now. So I guess people are. Yeah, I don't know.
00:30:22.618 - 00:31:06.664, Speaker A: I think we have to accept that in crypto there are vastly different types of participants. And yeah, we're all trying to ultimately make it and get resources so we can see views like this in a year time, like little Lambo says. But ultimately there's two groups, right? Like there's people who are, you know, caring about saving and long term savings and then there's people buying lottery tickets. And I've been surprised, being in Asia, how prevalent this is. I talked to people from Korea and people from Vietnam and in these countries that are like super into crypto, like these, these countries are like the most crypto obsessed countries in the world. And Vietnam, they just love trading, like meme coins on Defi. Like, they don't trade anything else.
00:31:06.664 - 00:31:53.612, Speaker A: Like, you know, I'm working on mantle and I realized that the only thing Vietnam knows about mantle is there's like a mantle Inu coin. Do not buy. This is not financial advice to buy mantle Inu, but apparently, like, this is the thing in Vietnam that's about mantle. And meanwhile in Korea, they don't even touch defi because, you know, they don't care about all this blockchain stuff. They just want to go on a centralized platform and, you know, they love it when we've shown in the past, like, these charts, when a coin, you can't deposit it, so, like, no outsider can come in and like, arbitrage it and then they just go wild. Apparently there's like telegram chats where somebody announces that, hey, like, this coin has just like, stopped deposits and then they just go, like crazy on it and it's sort of, it's sort of like a lottery ticket. Like they're just kind of taking their chance and, and it's a cultural thing.
00:31:53.612 - 00:31:58.184, Speaker A: It's hard for us to understand. Justin, do you understand this kind of thing being in the west?
00:31:58.724 - 00:32:34.292, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I think we all do, right? I mean, we've all been to the casino and seen people playing casino games. Like, I mean, isn't it better to gamble on like, some random mantle inu coin than playing the slot machine. Like, certainly the risk reward is much better with mantle coin. And I mean, a lot of our world is built upon speculation. I don't think it's surprising to me that this sort of like open market is rife with speculation and basically like casino like apps. And I, you know, I think that stuff's going to continue to grow and also spread in the US as well.
00:32:34.468 - 00:33:03.116, Speaker C: I was going to say, like, to your point, Jordy, that I think having an unbounded upside is like almost like a human necessity. I think, like with a lot of people's current lives that like, you know, they're working nine to five jobs and like the chances that they'll actually make it from it are like so close to zero that like having any outlet to be able to get that uncapped, you know, seven figure, eight figure, nine figure payout is like almost. I think it is necessary for people to have hope and people to continue on.
00:33:03.220 - 00:33:30.934, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. It's like if you're playing this optimally and like, you're working a standard nine to five job and not doing too well, but you're like, you know, you can pay all your bills, you have a great apartment, kids, good life, it's like, you know, if a really bad recession hits, the government's going to drop stimulus. So are you really worried about like growing your savings or should you just like buy that lottery ticket on some token? I'm not saying that's right, but I can see why that is like more and more the mindset that we could see in the future.
00:33:31.594 - 00:34:14.798, Speaker A: No, I agree with both of you that it's a very human instinct and there's reasons for it, especially for men, that our lives are more expendable, our lives are cheap, we go to war, we kill each other, and then the winners take the few women and they can take five women each. At that point, it doesn't really matter. It'll still create the same number of kids in the end. So society lives on. I'm sure you guys can imagine that my ex girlfriends had a great time with me explaining to them that the only reason that they're mad that I'm looking at the other hot girl is because their survival instinct has kicked in and so they just chill out. I'm sure you can imagine how well that's gone in my life. But to get to your guys point, so if we accept that there's value being created, buy these lottery tickets.
00:34:14.798 - 00:34:44.540, Speaker A: Because, you know, ultimately, like, there is this game that we desire to play. What that means, though, is that everybody who's creating those pump and dumps, whether it's TWF, whether it's, you know, some random korean telegram chat, those people end up being the casino, and they end up making money because the casino, the house, makes money. They have the edge. So they're going to know when it's going to dump, because they have. They've cornered the spot supply. They're going to dump it. They're going to know when this thing's going to rug, because they're the ones rugging it.
00:34:44.540 - 00:35:19.764, Speaker A: In essence, we're giving them the power of the casino. And anybody that has attention can create a casino and grab that position, and it becomes a very murky water. And I think this is something that we haven't figured out or talked about at all as a community. The 100,000 of us that are left, maybe 200,000, I don't know how many of us are still left around. But now that it's the bear market, before things start getting crazy again, I just feel like we should at least have these conversations, or where are the lines if you're a casino maker?
00:35:20.344 - 00:36:05.264, Speaker D: Yeah. I also feel like people give these people power. There's no one forcing people to participate in the DWF pump and dumps and these meme coin influencers, in a way, like crypto is like dopamine as a service, like dream as a service. It's like you can put x dollars into this and maybe it'll buy you a house or something. And I feel like crypto has been so cyclical and it's been led by hyper speculation. And I feel like the next full cycle has to be led by actual consumer apps where people can actually see that there's value and then invest accordingly. I think most of us, we want to buy things that have value that can appreciate over time.
00:36:05.264 - 00:36:29.884, Speaker D: I think just because the markets are boring, nothing's going up. These random meme coins are going to capture people's attention just because there's nothing else to talk about. But I do think that. I feel like it's just because the markets are boring. And I think once people enter back to space, I think we'll start to actually see fundamental value, hopefully.
00:36:30.344 - 00:37:04.124, Speaker C: I wanted to. I feel like crypto is almost like a confluence of many different, I guess, social use cases that have yet to be separated out. One of them is obviously trustless, decentralized, programmable money. But there's also markets for liquid private equity. The other third one is just a new digitized version of lottery or casino system, and they're all kind of commingled into one thing. Each token has elements of each, and it's interesting how people value them and separate them out across time.
00:37:04.544 - 00:37:42.094, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we have seen the dreams being fulfilled sometimes. There's so many people that know someone who, I know a guy who bought Dogecoin in 2015 and kept it all and retired, and he's living in Miami and enjoying life. But Justin, as a builder, we're seeing this on the builder side too, especially with NFT projects. And I know that you're familiar with the space. I think last time you were saying how much you hate NFTs, but with empty promises from NFT projects, because you have this weird dynamic. They get all the money upfront, like there's a mint. You can talk about roadmap and what you can do with it, and maybe you try, maybe you don't try.
00:37:42.094 - 00:37:59.314, Speaker A: Where's the line drawn? Because it's hard to know. Is it unethical if somebody tries but then they give up after a while? Should they keep trying until they die? Do like, at what point do NFT projects go from being ethical to unethical in terms of their fundraising?
00:37:59.734 - 00:38:27.530, Speaker B: Yes. I thought this tweet was interesting. I wanted to share here. So Azuki Elementals was crazy story. In this bear market, they raised $40 million for this elementals collection. They basically sold this NFT and it's basically just down only, right? Like people just start selling it when they don't see any sort of value coming back to them. For me personally, the way I think about it is if you have any sort of a roadmap or promise any sort of like longer term development and you can't execute on that or don't, you should return the money.
00:38:27.530 - 00:38:51.506, Speaker B: If you're very clear upfront and say this is just a picture, this is just art, whatever your project is, this is what it is. I don't think I'm going to build anything further. We're not going to do anything further. If you like it, you can buy it. If you don't like it, don't. Then I don't think there's an obligation to return funds. But I think it's just like raising venture capital, right? Like if you raise x million dollars from VC's and you don't execute, you return the money.
00:38:51.506 - 00:39:16.074, Speaker B: If you want to give up, you return the money. If you can't execute and you don't think it's viable, you return the money. Like you, you really shouldn't just keep. You keep it, right? Like in traditionally, that would just be fraud, right, to just promise something, keep the money and then not work on it. So I think if there's a roadmap, if there's any vision, you should return the money. If you're not executing or you don't want to execute, it's different. If you're trying and you fail, that's one thing that's normal.
00:39:16.074 - 00:39:20.494, Speaker B: But if you promise something and just sort of throw your hands up and don't do it, you should give the money back.
00:39:21.034 - 00:40:18.744, Speaker A: But that, what that means is that it really depends, like, what's inside the person and only they know. Like, you know, was I trying hard or was I not trying hard? Was I lazy? Like, you know, did family, family tragedy happen? And then I, you know, I couldn't actually, like, go through with it. Only the person knows. And as a society, and I think what kind of think you experience is that, like, some people pile on when somebody accuses somebody else because there are people who are taking advantage of these kind of scams and when somebody calls them out, there is like the natural behavior to kind of gang up, even if it's unverified, because sometimes these things are hard to verify. And I think ultimately it's such a gray area that we have to sort of establish our own story and get it out. I know, like we talked about, you know, people in the past that have gotten accused by Zack, XBT, for example, and, you know, they had their different side of the story, but Zack has kind of established reputation. It's so difficult to, to respond to accusations.
00:40:19.044 - 00:40:41.108, Speaker B: I think you're in some ways worrying about the wrong problem. Like, I think, you know, that ethics, quote, is like, ethics are what you do when no one's watching. And I think it's like more of an individual or personal question. Right. Like, if the Azuki team knows that they were, they've been trying in this example, they've been building, they've been shipping stuff. They've been giving you the best effort. Well, then that was ethical.
00:40:41.108 - 00:41:09.650, Speaker B: And, like, there's going to be noise on Twitter and in the community and, like, there's literally nothing you can do about that. I think it becomes a personal question of, like, knowing that you're doing the right thing and that, like, most people, if they really saw what you were doing, they would believe it. And I think that's what will matter, like, from a legal standpoint as well. Like, if I'm not saying this is at all in the cars, but if someone sued the Uzuki team for like defrauding investors, let's say if you can convince a jury of your peers that what you did was ethical and. Right. Well, like that is the standard. Right.
00:41:09.650 - 00:41:17.654, Speaker B: So I think it's more of an internal question than sort of worrying at all what the community thinks because people are going to be shouting from the rooftop, whatever you do.
00:41:18.034 - 00:42:04.704, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, how do you generally actually take a view when, you know, on the one hand, you know, you're a poker player, you're in the arena, you know, you're supposed to be buying and selling at the right price and, you know, that's kind of what you're focusing on, let's say, versus, you know, starting to see like, you know, oh, there's, there are opportunities and, you know, your out of context clip was actually saying the truth in the sense of, you know, people are potentially able to move markets and they can dump on people if they want to. Like they can play the, play the long game and wait for the right opportunity. That clip being out of context doesn't take away the reality that, you know, this type of stuff is possible and the only thing preventing it is the person themselves. How do you actually think about it?
00:42:05.364 - 00:42:37.274, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. I think if we completely exclude the case for someone who's compensated for tokens, then it is still in the capitalistic system. There's still a huge reward for being the one to direct capital in a way that actually sustains. For example, someone who in the very early days says bitcoin is a great buy. This is the reason why. And like, I have a big bitcoin and it manages to convince like hundreds of millions of dollars to flow into bitcoin. And obviously, like, you know, his assets appreciate, like, is that really like a, is that a pump and dump? Like, probably not.
00:42:37.274 - 00:43:09.636, Speaker C: And in the bull market, having that trust built up to where people listen to you, you're credible and like, you identify good sources where capital inflows are deserved and, you know, everyone wins, then, like, I don't think that's a bad thing. And I think like, there are plenty of people in the past cycle that have been like turned to heroes because they've done that accurately. It's really subjective. If it dumps immediately after or if you affect the prices because of that, then obviously you're doing something wrong. But it's very unclear. Good or bad.
00:43:09.740 - 00:43:37.744, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this has been a great first chat. I hope we can chat about this again, especially if you have a guest on that thinks about these things. It's a topic that I'd love to touch upon again. You know, in the meantime, hopefully we don't have any more spfs trying to save the world by taking all our money and, you know, doing orgies in Bahamas or whatever they think is gonna save the world. Cool. Well, that was. That was awesome.
00:43:37.744 - 00:43:50.620, Speaker A: I would. I would like to move on to our closing segment. We're going back to one of the. One of the early favorites, which is pasta of the week. Maybe. Maybe tyke, kick us off. What's your pasta?
00:43:50.812 - 00:44:16.624, Speaker D: Yeah. So this ties into our discussions around ethics, but, I mean, I know nothing about this trader NJ guy, but apparently he got some token allocation, he sold or. I have no idea what happened. But the response, basically, Don Alt is kind of pointing this out and then this auto cannon. I mean, first of all, that tag is on its own. It's ridiculous, right? Auto cannibal. The pasta here is.
00:44:16.624 - 00:44:49.572, Speaker D: Yeah, their content is good. Although for sure, as every influencer, they go to rug, sometimes rugs are part of the ecosystem. Embrace them. So I just felt like it was so funny how maybe it's not funny. It's kind of sad that people just understand that, okay, every influencer is gonna rug and scam and it's just part of the ecosystem, and people are entering this accepting acceptance phase of this is what we have to deal with. And it kind of encapsulates the entire video. And I thought it was, like, a pretty fitting pasta right there.
00:44:49.628 - 00:44:55.740, Speaker A: It's very sad. It's like the opposite of. Respect the pump, which was like an epic pasta we had before. It's the exact opposite of that.
00:44:55.932 - 00:44:57.180, Speaker B: Respect the dump.
00:44:57.372 - 00:44:57.716, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:44:57.740 - 00:45:00.500, Speaker A: Yeah. Thikki, what do you have for us this week?
00:45:00.652 - 00:45:23.764, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. So, I mean, I still don't understand what's going on here. I just was cracking myself up yesterday when I saw it. But essentially Genesis global capital sued DCG. And I thought Genesis was just like, a substantial, like, a wholly owned subsidiary of DCG, but they sued them over, like, an unpaid bitcoin loan. And this guy, you know, just had a hilarious meme because obviously everyone knows, like, they're two. They're owned by the same people.
00:45:23.764 - 00:45:28.360, Speaker C: Yeah. Guess you can't trust anyone out there. You know, even your subsidiaries are out there soon.
00:45:28.472 - 00:45:29.744, Speaker A: And, Justin, how about you?
00:45:29.864 - 00:45:46.646, Speaker B: Yeah, for me, I have this. Martin Shkreli is just. It's a long pasta, so I don't know if it counts, but it's. I would recommend everyone read it. It's absolutely hilarious. So Martin Shkreli the Pharma bro. He's been sort of, like, blowing up in the crypto Twitter space.
00:45:46.646 - 00:46:25.964, Speaker B: He does a lot of podcasts talking about what's going to happen to SPF. But in any case, over the past few weeks and months, like, he's been sort of sharing on Twitter publicly what a lot of women have dmed him. Actually, it's a really interesting story. While he was in prison, there were a ton of women that were very interested in visiting him and developing relationships with him, let's say. Actually, the journalist that was covering his story became his long term girlfriend while he was in prison. They later broke up, but said because of all this female attention, he actually needs, like, a jacked security guard to sort of protect him from this. And it's absolutely a hilarious read.
00:46:25.964 - 00:46:39.924, Speaker B: Martin Shkreli, whether you love him or hate him, he's a funny guy. And I would recommend everyone read this one. Too long to go through here, but he's a bad boy. He's like a nerdy bad boy that's made it in pharma, right? He's got a lot of resources.
00:46:40.084 - 00:46:44.524, Speaker A: Justin, for our Spotify listeners, you should at least give us a couple quotes from that one.
00:46:44.644 - 00:47:00.924, Speaker B: Sure, I can do that. I need you by my side to one, beat these hoes off me to protect my neck in case I'm slipping, which I absolutely never am. Three, check any disrespect because haters are fucking my whole aura up. And there's a lot more. There's so many more gems in there. You guys got to check it out.
00:47:01.044 - 00:47:02.024, Speaker A: That's epic.
00:47:03.274 - 00:47:06.970, Speaker C: Did you go into Martin Rally's? Have you looked at his Wikipedia page?
00:47:07.162 - 00:47:08.894, Speaker B: No. What's. What's over there?
00:47:10.434 - 00:47:23.814, Speaker C: It's actually kind of wild how he got landed into jail in the first place. So essentially, he, like, he raised the hedge fund, like, 600k. He lost it. He raised money again. He lost. He lost it all, by the way. And then I think he raised a third time and he lost it all again.
00:47:23.814 - 00:47:55.716, Speaker C: Or maybe he didn't lose a third time. Anyway, he basically lied to his investors that, like, oh, he didn't. He didn't lose the money and he made it all back on the third time, and he ended up paying everyone back. And then, like, nobody knew this for, like, many, many, many years until, like, after he was on tv, like, they investigated him and they found this out and they, like, put him in jail because of that. But, like, it's kind of. Kind of amazing how many, I guess, stories are out there. People, like, losing everything and covering it up and then winning it all back on the third try and like, everything's okay and no one hears about them anymore.
00:47:55.820 - 00:48:17.660, Speaker B: Yeah. I actually saw Martin in an interview say that he was the only person in the US that's been convicted of securities fraud who actually, actually made their investors money. I don't know if that's true, but I've heard him say that with Laura Shane on Unchained quite a bit. Because if you haven't seen his SBF podcast, they're really interesting. I would just recommend everyone watch it. He talks about what jail is like, sort of like a nerdy tech person. So.
00:48:17.660 - 00:48:18.308, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:18.396 - 00:48:36.146, Speaker A: All right, well, let us know in the comments if you guys want Martin Shkreli on the show, and maybe, maybe he can be our next guest to talk about ethics with. Cool. Well, you know, I didn't. I didn't come up with a pasta this week. You know, I've been. I've been busy trading. I don't know if you guys have been trading, but, you know, I've been doing pretty good because, you know, I can push it up, I can push it down.
00:48:36.146 - 00:48:53.170, Speaker A: I can liquidate you, or I can bless you, I can force you to go long and go short. I can select random coins, guys, and I can let them skyrocket, but your portfolio will be bleeding. I am the master of this game, guys. Okay. Wow.
00:48:53.202 - 00:48:54.668, Speaker B: Where'd you get that one, Jordyn?
00:48:54.668 - 00:49:03.630, Speaker A: Well, you guys can probably guess. The audience can guess. This is my fav. This is Mister Grachev. Once again. Well done, sir. You know this.
00:49:03.630 - 00:49:31.834, Speaker A: You are stepping up your game. When we first started covering Mister Grachev, by the way, he had, you know, 4000 followers. I was commenting how, how low that was, and I think the steady lads family has been giving him, giving him a follow, because here we go. 10,000 followers achieved just a couple days ago. He's already at 12.5. You can see me right there below. If you scroll back, Justin, you know, if you scroll down a little bit, you know, I'm doing my part.
00:49:31.834 - 00:49:58.034, Speaker A: We're doing our part here at steadilads. Mister Grachev, we would love to have you on. You would be an interesting ethics guest as well, to discuss. So, you know, the amount of main character aura that this guy has is, is huge. And I don't know if he's going to end up in jail in two months or if he's going to, you know, manage to be the new CZ or what's going to happen, but I'm interested to watch.
00:49:58.454 - 00:50:03.474, Speaker C: Did you see my tweet that I literally just posted it inspired by you, Jordy.
00:50:03.814 - 00:50:11.314, Speaker A: Think he's live tweeting our podcast right now. So if you're seeing his tweet and tomorrow you see the podcast, you'll know why he just tweeted that.
00:50:12.534 - 00:50:15.978, Speaker B: You need to set up alerts for all of us so you get live updates.
00:50:16.166 - 00:50:17.218, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:50:17.346 - 00:50:23.694, Speaker A: I think. I think we had some good pastas this week. Taiki, do you want to choose a pasta? Is it Mister Grachev? Is it Justin Branch?
00:50:24.074 - 00:50:25.762, Speaker D: It has to be Mister Grachev.
00:50:25.858 - 00:50:26.162, Speaker C: What?
00:50:26.218 - 00:50:36.850, Speaker D: Yeah, he definitely gets the pasta. For him to grow his Twitter account in this bear market, definitely. Very, very impressive. The power he yields.
00:50:37.042 - 00:50:43.134, Speaker B: So let me get this straight. We spent an hour talking about ethics and you pick Grachev over ethical? Martin Shkreli?
00:50:44.154 - 00:50:51.218, Speaker D: Well, what can I say? You know, like, we're just evaluating the pasta and not just the ethics of the entire thing.
00:50:51.346 - 00:50:51.922, Speaker B: Fair enough.
00:50:51.978 - 00:50:59.442, Speaker D: And I look forward to seeing more of his work. So I'm definitely an avid follower. Mister Grachev, I think Rachev unfollowed me.
00:50:59.458 - 00:51:00.730, Speaker C: He unfollowed a bunch of people.
00:51:00.842 - 00:51:01.854, Speaker B: Oh, no, no.
00:51:02.194 - 00:51:03.770, Speaker C: He's only following 23 now.
00:51:03.882 - 00:51:15.736, Speaker A: Cool. All right, so another pasta of the week goes to Mister Garage. I think he's piling on the wins. He's the chef. We can get a little image of him with it. With a chef hat on. He's done it very well.
00:51:15.736 - 00:51:36.256, Speaker A: So, Mister Grachev, you might be one of our future guests, hopefully. And yeah, let us know what you guys think in the chat. Should we. Should we bring on Mister Grachev? Should we find another guest? Let us know who you want to see up next. I think we'll. Should we do like one a month? One guest a month? Like every three, four episodes? What do you guys think?
00:51:36.360 - 00:51:43.564, Speaker B: Let's do it. I'm still working on Charles Hodgkinson. If you're a watcher or viewer and you're connected, please dm us. That would be a great interview.
00:51:47.264 - 00:51:47.664, Speaker A: What's.
00:51:47.704 - 00:51:48.684, Speaker B: What's his name?
00:51:49.064 - 00:51:51.924, Speaker D: He doesn't even know. He's such an evacuation.
00:51:52.624 - 00:51:54.440, Speaker A: You're not gonna get him anymore.
00:51:54.632 - 00:51:57.936, Speaker D: Yeah, he'll be easy. His ego is gonna be hurt.
00:51:58.040 - 00:51:59.880, Speaker A: Thanks, everybody, and see you next week.
00:52:00.032 - 00:52:00.464, Speaker B: Bye, bro.
