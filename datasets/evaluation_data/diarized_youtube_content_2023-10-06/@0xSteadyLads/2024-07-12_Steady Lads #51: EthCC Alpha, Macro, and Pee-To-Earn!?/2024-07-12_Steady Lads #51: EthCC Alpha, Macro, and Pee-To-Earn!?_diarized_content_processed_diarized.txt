00:00:00.320 - 00:00:32.778, Speaker A: You know, we're all getting this infra fatigue, right? It's like l two s are, like the uniswap works of this cycle. And I'm trying to invest in, like, consumer apps for, like, a future that I want to see. And one of the projects I've been talking to is AI companions for dogs. And there's this element called P to earn. And when I heard P to earn, I was like, hey, like, my dog pee is everywhere. And if I can earn from that, sign me up. So what they're trying to do is you can scan your, like, your own dog's nose printhead, and it would verify that this dog is unique, and they would create a representation on chain.
00:00:32.778 - 00:00:48.830, Speaker A: It's kind of like tamagotchi if you've ever played it. Mix of Pokemon. Go, like, the p to urn. Like, you don't. There's no actual peeing going on in real life. You just, like, walk with your dog, like, virtually, and then pee on monuments for points. And that's kind of how it works.
00:00:48.830 - 00:00:54.770, Speaker A: It sounds ridiculous, Jody. And Justin is looking at me like I'm. Like, I'm stupid for even, like, considering investing.
00:00:54.810 - 00:00:58.072, Speaker B: Justin, do you have a dog? Can you try this? Everything?
00:00:58.216 - 00:01:04.536, Speaker C: I don't have a dog anymore. I had one, but. So I can't just. Can I borrow your dog tyke, scan the nose, and then.
00:01:04.608 - 00:01:08.940, Speaker A: Well, my dog is my dog. You know, it's a one of one. You can't take away my dog.
00:01:29.300 - 00:01:43.636, Speaker B: GM from Brussels, at least for me and Justin. This is episode 51 of Steady Lads. Two of us are here in Ecc. Taiki is fomoing. Or maybe not so much. Maybe you've been seeing some of the headlines.
00:01:43.748 - 00:01:46.068, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel safe in New York. I feel safe.
00:01:46.164 - 00:02:04.960, Speaker B: Definitely safe in New York, in Brooklyn. That. That's not something that should be normal. But I haven't had any, any issue. Justin, I think, you know, with your karate training, you're probably scaring people off. Are you at any encounters?
00:02:05.380 - 00:02:23.200, Speaker C: No encounters at all. And I've been roaming around, too. Just last night, I left the Ravi party. We scootered to the bear chain rave and then left at 02:00 a.m. and the streets were peaceful, I think, as long as someone posted a tweet of what areas to avoid, unless you know how to fight. And I think if you stick to that map, you're good.
00:02:23.750 - 00:02:48.570, Speaker B: Yeah, well, maybe it's because, you know, you're intimidating physique or maybe not. I don't know. We had a little picture go viral on crypto Twitter with Justin from last night. Yeah, pretty interesting one here. So not a female in sight. 0% probability we've talked. And what's the situation here, Justin?
00:02:48.880 - 00:03:14.060, Speaker C: So I wanted to meet for the first time in person one of our favorite guests on steady lad, Suzu. Fortunately, he was at the party I was at last night. Got a chance to say hello, and really quite a charming guy. So got to show him a little bit about what I've been working on and have a good conversation with him, and, yeah, hopefully he'll be on the show more. Tucky. Kind of roasted me here with this one, though.
00:03:15.200 - 00:03:21.014, Speaker A: What were you mansplaining to sue? I mean, going back to the photo, if you scroll down, seems like you're.
00:03:21.062 - 00:03:27.974, Speaker C: At this very moment. I was telling him, you don't remember me. I was on. Came on my podcast, study lads. You know Jordy, right?
00:03:28.022 - 00:03:31.110, Speaker A: I'm friends with Jordy, and he's just smiling.
00:03:31.190 - 00:03:54.210, Speaker B: Awkward. I like the analogy. Taiki. I think Justin's bicep needs to get a little bit bigger, but that we're almost there. Unfortunately, there have been episodes of people getting, getting robbed and everything. And we had the, the bold Leonidas cartoon on topic here. We can, we can bring up where does feel like a little bit of a crusade.
00:03:54.210 - 00:04:01.690, Speaker B: Says, are you. Are you doing cosplay? It's like, no, I'm going to Brussels, just like full crusade shield and everything.
00:04:02.750 - 00:04:21.048, Speaker C: Well, you know, what's been. Been crazy I've seen is, like, even taking all that stuff aside, like, seeing Vitalik. So I've been going to a lot of talks, talk, talks. Actually more so than I've ever gone at a conference. I've gone to a couple of Vitalik talks, one where I actually had the opportunity to speak right before him. So I got to meet him backstage. Funny interaction there.
00:04:21.048 - 00:04:33.152, Speaker C: But the other thing I noticed is, like, he'll go to these talks with, like, 200, 300 people, and there's no security. Like, he walks in alone, he walks out alone. No metal detectors, no security. And it's just, it's. It's wild to me that we don't have that.
00:04:33.216 - 00:04:57.790, Speaker B: I'm glad you're going to the talks because I saw a picture of, I think it was a side event with, say, an aptos. I think you can bring up some of the pictures here, but massive room, tons of chairs. And I think you got the founders of, like, two of the large, large camp protocols, and there's, like, two guys on their phone, basically out of, like, 8000 chairs. So.
00:04:58.850 - 00:05:14.032, Speaker C: So I wanted. I actually wanted to go to this journey. I messaged you, seeing if we could meet at this event. I think no one went to this because it was, like, a 30 minutes uber. It was really far outside of the city. City. But I have gone to several events where it looks exactly like this, and I'm one of only a few people in the room.
00:05:14.032 - 00:05:26.740, Speaker C: We also have, like, this thing in the. In our industry where, like, there's always, like, people gathered in the back just talking to each other. So you can often never hear the talks themselves. Like, everyone's always, like, talking and socializing and networking. No one's actually listening to the talks.
00:05:27.040 - 00:06:00.818, Speaker B: Yeah, I've done, you know, keynotes with, like, 10,000 people in the room, and then I've done talks wherever there's, like, two guys, and they're, like, not paying attention, and I have to give, like, a speech for 30 minutes. And it builds character, it builds resilience. Doing both, you have the two extremes, and if you're comfortable doing both, then that's. That's the ultimate, ultimate goal. So on my side, I've done a few panels. I had some with Santiago, who's the co host of Empire podcast, our friendly competitors, and that was a blast. The guy is you.
00:06:00.818 - 00:06:24.118, Speaker B: He's a free thinker, and I don't agree with all his takes. Makes it even more interesting. I did go to the main event, walked around. I wasn't too excited. There was a couple things I liked. There was some progress happening on the web. Two user bring in, which is something that I finally want to see people where they can just click a link and then the wallet gets created for them.
00:06:24.118 - 00:06:43.180, Speaker B: Apparently, passkeys are the thing now. Apple passkeys, you just use no passwords, you just scan your biometrics and get access to the wallet. I think that's fine for things like nfts, and if it's not your entire net worth, that's a good place to start. Have you seen anything interesting, Justin?
00:06:43.960 - 00:07:09.240, Speaker C: Yeah, I have. I've been using a lot of those apps where you sort of, like, create a wallet with a passkey. Base has introduced their wallet for that. And then also at eTHCC, they have this wallet list, basically raffle going on, where you scan the QR code on your phone of these ten red balloons they have hidden around the event. And if you scan all ten, you're entered into the lottery, and it creates this private cryptographic experience for you. But you don't even have to deal with a wallet. Which is pretty cool.
00:07:09.360 - 00:07:41.388, Speaker B: Yeah, no, one of the few things that I left quite excited by, because ultimately the user experience doesn't get better. And this is the kind of stuff that I want to see. Yeah, I mean, nothing too crazy. Generally, it feels like the market is starting to realize that the infrastructure thesis is overcooked. And I've been feeling this for a while, but it, you know, we've still had the valuations on all these, like, ghosts. L1 s, l two s defy my feeling. But finally it's starting to appear.
00:07:41.388 - 00:07:45.476, Speaker B: And then, you know, hopefully we'll focus a bit more on apps.
00:07:45.628 - 00:08:12.796, Speaker C: I guess what I'll say. I mean, it feels that way. People are sort of exhausted. Like, everyone I talked to is exhausted by, like, we're talking about new chains, new l two s, new layer one ZK, etcetera. But, like, Guay has been one for the past couple weeks. And there is this sort of, like, energy here. Like, well, why are we building all this cool tech? Like, who's even going to use it? Like, who needs an intent based blockchain? Who needs the ZK scaling solutions? And there really are no, like, I've been going to a lot of events.
00:08:12.796 - 00:08:39.030, Speaker C: There really aren't many, like, app based events. Like, I don't think I've gone to one event that was dedicated to, like, an interesting new app that was coming out of. And I think even a lot of the app projects themselves are not putting out events here. Like, I haven't seen a uniswap event or like, a DyDX event or GMX event, or just really anything from the Ethereum ecosystem or outside. It's all been infrastructure. Have you had the same experience, Jordy?
00:08:39.650 - 00:09:06.280, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know if some of it is maybe regulatoryly driven, where layer ones are a bit more comfortable displaying themselves, versus app tokens are a little bit more, like, worried from a regulatory perspective. But I did run into some apps at one of the site events, and apparently, Taiki, you have invested in one of these ones. Can we see the name or just the concept, or what do we want to do here? Taigi.
00:09:06.740 - 00:09:37.420, Speaker A: Yeah, so I guess we can talk about the concept. I feel like we're all getting this infra fatigue, right? L two s are like, the uniswap works of this cycle. They just keep popping up. And I'm trying to invest in consumer apps. I'm trying to invest for a future that I want to see. And one of the projects I've been talking to is they're trying to do AI companions for dogs. And there's this element called Peter Earn.
00:09:37.420 - 00:09:40.864, Speaker A: And when I heard Pete earn, I was like, hey, my dog pees everywhere.
00:09:40.952 - 00:09:41.106, Speaker B: I.
00:09:41.128 - 00:10:11.088, Speaker A: And if I can learn from that, sign me up. And apparently, I didn't know this, but, like, the dog's nose print is, like, really unique. It's similar to a human's fingerprint. So what they're trying to do is you can scan your own dog's nose print, and it would verify that this dog is unique, and they would create a representation on chain, and there would be elements. It's kind of like Tamagotchi if you've ever played it. A mix of Pokemon. Go where you would, like, you know, like the p to earn.
00:10:11.088 - 00:10:27.080, Speaker A: Like, you know, there's no actual peeing going on in real life. You just, like, walk with your dog, like, virtually, and then pee on monuments for points. And that's kind of how it works. It sounds ridiculous. Jody and Justin is looking at me like I'm. Like, I'm stupid for even, like, considering investing.
00:10:27.120 - 00:10:30.376, Speaker B: Justin, do you have a dog? Can you try this? You like to try everything.
00:10:30.528 - 00:10:37.444, Speaker C: I don't have a dog anymore. I had one, but. So I can't just. Can I borrow your dog tyke, scan the nose, and then just go and.
00:10:37.492 - 00:10:41.620, Speaker A: Well, my dog is my dog. You know, it's a one of one. You can't take away my dog.
00:10:41.700 - 00:10:58.668, Speaker C: You know how, like, when we were all scanning our eyes for world coin and people would be, like, buying off people in Africa to, like, use their eyeballs and, like, giving them $20 to do it? Like, maybe I'll just start finding people on the streets here, giving them $20 to scan their dog's nose and really farm this airdrop.
00:10:58.764 - 00:11:30.042, Speaker A: I think there would be, like, proof of dog elements to it. One thing I was kind of curious about is there's these AI companionship stuff, right? It's like AI humans. They can bring your dead grandpa back to real life. I mean, or not real life, but virtually. That sounds kind of weird. But what if, unfortunately, the day my dog passes away would be one of the saddest days of my life, but would I still appreciate this digital version of my dog that has its own mind? Like, that part I'm not sure.
00:11:30.106 - 00:11:32.122, Speaker C: You wouldn't. I can answer for you.
00:11:32.186 - 00:11:33.258, Speaker A: It sounds really dystopian.
00:11:33.314 - 00:11:37.350, Speaker C: You just get, when your dog dies, you don't build a version of it.
00:11:37.890 - 00:11:44.402, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess so. So maybe this. This app is bearish, but I'm willing to believe I, you know, we need to believe in something.
00:11:44.586 - 00:12:15.734, Speaker C: We are seeing other stuff like that. And I think we have a new puff competitor, the puff mantle meme coin. There's now vape to earn with the token ticker puff. And I think this was going around the conference here, but it's pretty interesting, these using incentives to get people to quit smoking and reduce vaping over time with green tea extract, which, Jordi, you say is quite popular in Asia. And then the rewards are all verifiable on chain, where each pod is a token minter. So as you're replacing pods, you're getting more tokens here at Iraq.
00:12:15.782 - 00:12:31.334, Speaker B: This is Bera chain project, part of their build a Berataindeen incubation. And I don't know if it's popular in Asia. They say that they have, like, there's like 80 million people in Asia that that vape this stuff, and, oh, wow. They want to do puff tokens. That's interesting.
00:12:31.382 - 00:12:34.214, Speaker C: That's what I'm saying. You have, there's a little competition for us.
00:12:34.262 - 00:12:53.914, Speaker B: You know, like, sometimes people buy the wrong, the wrong ticker. This will be good. We'll get some inadvertent puff buying. Yeah. I mean, everyone's trying x to earn, and this is the latest. They seem to say that this will help you reduce vaping or maybe reduce tobacco. Maybe that's what they mean.
00:12:54.042 - 00:12:55.310, Speaker C: I think so, yeah.
00:12:55.770 - 00:12:56.106, Speaker B: Wow.
00:12:56.138 - 00:13:31.668, Speaker A: And they can expand other markets, too, I guess. Yeah. I really like this concept of x to earn. That's not like play to earn with gaming, because to earn tokens, humans have to take an action in the real world that produces some economic activity. I feel like that's, you know, I feel like that could be powerful. Of course, most of these things are going to fail, but trying to connect crypto to drive human behavior in the real world, like, I feel like that is, like, consumer deep end that I really find fascinating. So, yeah, like, I'm more than happy to, like, you know, keep looking into, like, these potential consumer apps.
00:13:31.844 - 00:13:43.184, Speaker C: Do you guys think these are just like, loyalty programs on steroids? Like, remember when, you know, with Coca Cola, you could, like, scan the bottle cap and get points that you could redeem for giveaways and rewards? Is this just a more liquid version of that?
00:13:43.272 - 00:13:50.392, Speaker B: We'll see. It feels a little bit last cycle, right? Like, we had step in, we had sex to earn. We had all this, like, stuff that was.
00:13:50.536 - 00:13:55.232, Speaker C: Stepping was the big one, though. Step in was the first and biggest to walk to earn app. Right.
00:13:55.416 - 00:13:57.424, Speaker B: Well, that was actually a successful one.
00:13:57.592 - 00:13:58.500, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah.
00:13:59.520 - 00:14:30.270, Speaker B: I think that one made a little bit of sense because people are willing to spend money in essence to motivate themselves to exercise. But yeah, we'll see what the next one is. Taiki seems to be pretty excited. I mean, I can't say that there's a lot better, exciting stuff out there. I have been going kind of deep into the AI rabbit hole. I think AI agents are going to probably change the world in the next few years and there's going to be opportunities for crypto to be a part of that. But yeah, l one, l two feels like we don't need more and more.
00:14:30.270 - 00:15:01.666, Speaker B: There's maybe a few that we want to go through that might perform on a price action basis a little bit good. Maybe let's bring up some of the, the latest and greatest coingecko. So at the time of recording, a little bit of red, but I think the markets bounced off the lows. At least we're no longer at 2800 eTh. And did we touch 54? That was a little bit scary for a little bit. So, you know, we're kind of still in this choppy period. I think some of the l one s that are interesting and that people are talking about a lot.
00:15:01.666 - 00:15:30.132, Speaker B: Number one is probably tawna. Seems like most conversations I've been having here lead to taunt at one point. Like people want more opinions, they see that there's a lot of obviously traction and there's a lot of potential users. I think the tech is still not fully there. And then a lot of the apps are tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Justin, any views on Tanya?
00:15:30.226 - 00:16:03.536, Speaker C: Yeah, you know, it's interesting you bring it up. I. So I went to two talks with, I listened to Vitalik twice this conference like two days in a row. And both talks he took reserve like 1 minute of his time to tell people to get off telegram because it's not private and it's not secure and it's not an app that any of us should be using, is what he says. I don't know if now that's because they're competing and they have a blockchain or if there's merit to that. But he said, you know, signals a little better and then there's one he said he recommends that's even, even better. But to get everyone off telegram at this point in the crypto space seems like a challenge.
00:16:03.536 - 00:16:05.888, Speaker C: But he was really, really against telegram.
00:16:06.024 - 00:16:39.350, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know, man. I mean, it kind of reminds me on one of the panels I was at on one of the site events, they asked, what does it mean to be a theory maligned? And is it important to be a theory maligned for a founder, for a project? Is that a thing? And my answer was, Ethereum aligned means that instead of talking at these site events, you're just talking at the main conference. It feels like. I like that there's a, there's like this ivory tower where it's a little bit disconnected, I think, from where most of the activity is happening, and telling people to get off of telegram to use, like, signal or something else.
00:16:39.510 - 00:16:43.558, Speaker A: Pretty out of touch with, like, actual humans. Actual people.
00:16:43.734 - 00:17:09.026, Speaker C: Yeah. I'll give you another out of touch example. So I thought Vitalik did actually a really good job at his talk, but there was another thing that was super out of touch. Raised their hand, they did a little q and a and asked about meme coins and, like, what Vitalik's thoughts are on meme coins, basically. And he started talking about how we should be using these meme coins to, like, fund social projects and social good. Yeah, yeah. And he wrote a blog about that.
00:17:09.026 - 00:17:50.080, Speaker C: And the whole time I'm, like, listening to that, and I'm kind of, like, looking out the audience. There were a few hundred people there. I was sitting off to the side, and I was thinking, well, like, on the surface here we have a billionaire, very successful person, very humble, though, like a nice person, but this is a billionaire telling all of these people in the crowd that are still, like, trying to figure out their financial journey and trying to make it. And now they're being told that they're, like, meme coins purpose, or, like, the project that they're working on or what they care about should be used for charity when these people are still just trying to make it and take their first steps when he's a billionaire. And I thought, to me, that was a little out of touch. Like, I don't know if the use case for meme coins is to fund charities. I don't think that makes much sense.
00:17:50.500 - 00:18:10.252, Speaker B: I think it's okay. I mean, his mindset at this point is not how to help more and more people get rich. I guess he's already done that with all the people that joined ICO and everything. I think at this point, he's just thinking about how to make the world more in the image that he would like it to be. And that's totally fine for someone as successful as Jody.
00:18:10.276 - 00:18:28.850, Speaker C: Imagine you have $2,000 to your name, and it's all an on chain meme coins. And now you're hearing, like, the pepe treasury is going to be donating, you know, 20% of his treasury to get dumped on you to, like, I think he donated his meme coins to, like, Covid preparedness or something like that. You wouldn't be pleased, you know?
00:18:29.430 - 00:18:52.386, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, he did say, like, stop sending me these fucking. I don't want them in my wallet. Let's go back to coin Yeko. Let's look at a few more. The charts. I mean, Taun is the one that I think has been overperforming throughout this choppy period. And there seem to be a lot of buyers, and I've heard a lot of examples of not crypto natives talking about it.
00:18:52.386 - 00:18:54.710, Speaker B: So maybe it's the next cardano.
00:18:56.330 - 00:19:35.130, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Pantera made its biggest investment in the tan and the tan ecosystem. And I think telegram, they can't really run ads. Sometimes they have these groups where they run ads, but it's really hard to monetize these social apps. And if they can't go that route, then maybe they just have to go the on chain route, introduce payments because they have a partnership with tether. Maybe it can become, like, USDT chain and overcome Tron. And Tron itself is already worth 12 billion. So if ton can become Tron plus an actual on chain gaming, whatever consumer app ecosystem, then, yeah, there's a bull case for it.
00:19:35.130 - 00:19:45.880, Speaker A: But it's kind of hard to imagine right now. Right now, I just played hamster combat. I was tapping for 30 minutes, and I'm like, I'm over this. I can't do this anymore.
00:19:46.040 - 00:20:24.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, ultimately, we need more users, and Tong has the best chance of tapping into a huge user base. So we'll see how it plays out. I think it's hard to dismiss it, and it'll probably keep going up the charts. Is my feeling BNB has been doing okay, I think. Is CZ meant to come out of jail soon? I feel like he'll want to do a few fireworks around the time that he gets out of jail. My personal thesis is probably to at least expect that someone will try to pump me and be around around the time of his jailbreak.
00:20:24.650 - 00:20:34.150, Speaker A: It's already such a big asset, though. It's going to be hard to pump it, but I guess the supply is cornered, so it might be easy to pump.
00:20:34.810 - 00:20:38.550, Speaker B: Yeah, sometimes you got to just think, like, who's trying to make a message here? Who's trying to send?
00:20:38.970 - 00:21:03.820, Speaker A: I remember people tried to pump Luna ahead of the trial. I'm not sure if that worked, but even people try to long doge ahead of kabosu, like the dog passing away. It's like crypto degens. They'll look for any source of volatility, and they'll come up with any sort of thesis because the markets are still pretty pvp, so I guess you have to bet on the cabal.
00:21:04.640 - 00:21:38.680, Speaker C: I'm curious, have you guys seen the sort of thesis or the conspiracy theory that every time a chain or ecosystem hosts a conference, the token does poorly? And I actually wanted to ask you, Jordi, like, is there actually something to this where, like, HCC, they sold 7000 conference tickets, so that means there's probably about 15,000 people here. I don't think the majority of people spend the money for the expensive tickets. Is it actually possible that there's like, 15,000 participants out of the market that can't really be buying ETH or whatever asset? And so, like, that marginal decrease is what causes performance to lag? Or is this just like a hokey conspiracy theory?
00:21:39.750 - 00:22:07.240, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought about this, but it seems hard to make that case scientifically, I think. And usually tokens go down when it's kind of been exhausted, which means that there's been a lot of buying going into it with certain expectations, and then there's no one left to keep that price. So I'm not sure. We've obviously had bullish conferences as well, so the meta has been not as consistent as it used to be.
00:22:07.580 - 00:22:26.244, Speaker A: So let's see, bullish conferences in the past. Every conference is bearish. But I guess all these conferences, it's to celebrate a particular ecosystem. So people are like, oh, I love this ecosystem. Time to buy. And then there's no one else after to, like, buy. All the marginal buyers are gone.
00:22:26.332 - 00:22:57.714, Speaker B: It doesn't always feel like, I feel like the ethereum. One has a lot of non ethical things going on, a lot of other l one s obviously not just barrichain, but a lot of the other ones are here. And maybe that's the sign that you've made it where you're not having to kick everybody else out. That's not talking about your one thing. I think the bitcoin conference is going to be interesting this year. Apparently, Donald Trump has announced that he's going to be speaking, which makes me very, very convinced that this guy is just leaning into the crypto thesis. He will be the crypto president.
00:22:57.714 - 00:23:02.062, Speaker B: Um, that was a good headline, and I think the market kind of pumped.
00:23:02.086 - 00:23:09.410, Speaker C: At least if he announces something like a strategy, the strategic reserve there, or confirms it or doubles down at it. That's going to be a wild event.
00:23:10.030 - 00:23:10.486, Speaker B: I mean.
00:23:10.518 - 00:23:11.090, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:13.670 - 00:23:20.410, Speaker C: But it's. Speaking of conferences, Jordy, the only swag I've accepted, I think you'll be very happy and proud of me, is a mantle shirt.
00:23:21.310 - 00:23:24.086, Speaker B: It is a. It is a nice and clean. You know, they don't like to.
00:23:24.118 - 00:23:26.332, Speaker C: It's classy. Yeah. It's not ridiculous.
00:23:26.526 - 00:23:33.192, Speaker B: And there's a meth crystal in the back. I think if you. You flip it around, you'll see the. The red meth crystals. There we go.
00:23:33.216 - 00:23:35.016, Speaker C: Oh, an ethereum. I like that.
00:23:35.128 - 00:23:36.020, Speaker B: It's nice.
00:23:36.520 - 00:23:44.180, Speaker A: Yeah. Is it too late to farm? Is it. Is it too late to farm cook? How does it work? It just started.
00:23:44.480 - 00:23:56.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I just need the whole meth. And if you put it in any of the apps on mantle, then you get more powder. Get more powder, get more cook. So it's just beginning. I think it's going to be 100 day campaign.
00:23:57.280 - 00:23:59.580, Speaker A: Okay. So for the next three months.
00:23:59.920 - 00:24:22.738, Speaker B: Yeah. And all the puff holders will get a chance to have some as well. We're releasing NFts, which is super exciting. I think we'll show some of those once they're out. But I like pfps for community building. I talked with Luca quite a bit during this conference. I think pudgies has announced that they are also building their own chain, which I think is a logical endgame.
00:24:22.738 - 00:24:58.952, Speaker B: They've bought one of the teams. I think Saigar is part of that. And they're going to be trying to build an actual chain ecosystem around their ip, around their community, I think makes a lot of sense. We're going to invest as well, see how it goes. But I like this stuff more than I, you know, some ZK thesis without any actual usage. Although, Justin, you were saying you're eyeing one of the kind of bad launches as potentially a good opportunity.
00:24:59.016 - 00:25:25.534, Speaker C: Yeah, I was saying earlier, I think there's just a lot of signal in looking at these events and seeing what crowds are there and what types of people are getting excited and who you're getting to speak at these events. And so Zksync did an event in partnership with Lenz, which is Stani's social web3 project. And, you know, I was looking at this and Zksync has just sort of been hammered. It's down, I think, over 50%. The FTV is 3.3 billion. Of course, there's not too much circulating.
00:25:25.534 - 00:25:43.930, Speaker C: It's about 600 million circulating market cap. So there's obviously a lot of unlocks coming. But like, this is starting to get pretty attractive, don't you guys think? 3.3 billion versus the optimistic l two s, which is sort of like old tech relative to Zika tech, are valued more than this. Like, what do you guys think about that?
00:25:44.730 - 00:26:01.986, Speaker B: I mean, this has been one of the more interesting launches because it launched so much lower than the expectations have been. And this is a project that everybody knows about. If you've been in crypto, these guys have been building since 2017. 2018. Right. Like they've been really grinding away. And I think their expectation was ten to 20 billion.
00:26:01.986 - 00:26:24.766, Speaker B: Especially when the market was good, it was more like 20. And then it launched that. Yeah, I mean, quickly you can see there like even in the first few hours it went to did buy some at thought, you know, surely this has to be the bottom. It's like 4 billion. It's much lower than all the comparables we're expecting. Yeah, we're down to 16. It looks like an appealing price.
00:26:24.766 - 00:26:51.636, Speaker B: I haven't sold. I'm still kind of holding. I think there's a lot of lessons here and probably in different categories. Obviously they had the Fud around the airdrop, so that kind of hurt the, you could just say the buzz, the go to market hype. There was a lot of people upset around how the airdrop was distributed, which I know Justin, you always say people always be upset, but I still think.
00:26:51.668 - 00:26:55.680, Speaker C: That Vitalik thinks that too, for what it's worth. He talked about that.
00:26:56.900 - 00:27:23.020, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's better and worse. Maybe bring up the other chart that was around this exact same time because it was the next day. So we were also part of this. So layer zero can bring up. I think it launched the day after showing more signs of life. Obviously it's not down only it's back to the high price. Similar valuation, around 4 billion ftv.
00:27:23.020 - 00:27:43.870, Speaker B: Also pretty hyped. Also, I think it was expected around seven. The private round was three. So it's actually bounced below the private round, which Taiki. Are you surprised to see companies trading below their private rounds? This is a bit of a new barrier that is unexpected.
00:27:44.450 - 00:28:26.660, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess the problem is that when these tokens launch, it introduces a couple hundred million dollars worth of value. And the majority of the people that get these tokens, they were only farming it to dump to accumulate more eth or something, or USDC. Given the lack of, I guess, retail appetite and retail participation, there's no one to really buy these things at launch. But I think given how Zksync is at three, blast is sub two layer zero went to sub three. You can actually make an argument that maybe it's worth buying these hated coins. Yes, there are VC coins. Yes, they're relatively low float.
00:28:26.660 - 00:28:51.580, Speaker A: But people have been complaining this entire time around, oh, retail doesn't get a good price because all the price discovery happens in the private rounds. Well, maybe this is what people wanted. You want people to dump or you want the price to dislocate to the downside. And if you actually believe in layer zero Zksync, maybe you're actually getting a good price relative to VC's that are long before four years.
00:28:53.280 - 00:29:44.020, Speaker B: I agree with the first part of the thesis for sure, which is that there's a few hundred million or maybe sometimes a billion dollars of market cap that gets created on day one. There's a lot of people that have become very short term focused and just looking to convert to their preferred currency, whether that's dollars or ETh or BTC. I wonder if it's a little bit of a natural progression where it's just like the survival of the fittest and the people who have survived crypto and are still around are the ones who have not been back holding things down 99%. And the ones who do convert it and they become a larger and larger force of the market. And all the whales that still exist are like the ones that are good at farming. And maybe this is like the new direction. Unfortunately, it's hard to say.
00:29:44.140 - 00:30:05.692, Speaker A: Yeah, and that, that reminds me of this, this funny meme I posted today. Let me just, let me just pull it up. There are four types of airdrop farmers. There are the zoomers, right? There are the zoomers with their haircut. They're new to crypto, actually learning and participating. They're poor but earnest. We have me, who deposits like $10 for three months.
00:30:05.692 - 00:30:53.920, Speaker A: I do nothing else of value, and I complain on the timeline. And then there's the rich, earnest people like Justin sun, who deposits like billions of dollars in the Eigen layer, and like, diamond hands their coins, probably sells it at some point. And then there's, you know, the types like Sisyphus that just continue to civil. I think one of the funny things about Zksync is that layer zero put out this entire civil filter list, right, of all these addresses. And I, you know, Sisyphus was like, oh, like I got civil filtered for layer zero, but Zksync gave me all their tokens from all these wallets. I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but I just kind of thought that this thing was pretty funny. And I guess there is a survival of this, right? Because over time, the longer you are in this space, crypto conditions, you that selling is good, right? Like you don't have hold of these things.
00:30:53.920 - 00:31:27.470, Speaker A: So the only types of people that are around to farm these things are just the prolific dumpers. And therefore there's so many sellers, not that many buyers. It is hard to buy these things, though, because buying Zksync here, relative to holding ETH and airdrop farming, there is a cost of capital and opportunity cost. And I also think that that's why people rotate back to ETH, because farmers farm with ETH, so they dump this airdrop to accumulate more eth to farm something else. And it's like this constant rotation of farming capital.
00:31:28.210 - 00:32:58.808, Speaker B: There's been a lot of talk about financial nihilism, and definitely people that I've met in the space that have been around a long time that have gotten burned by Luna, this or different contractions that have not worked, they do eventually become a little bit more jaded, I would say. And on the other hand, on a macro level, things are starting to get interesting again. And let's talk about macro for a few minutes, because I was listening to some of the macro podcasts that I generally like to keep in touch off and hearing the latest chatter and the latest moves in the market. I do feel like now is the time that I might start paying a little bit of attention to macro once again, because we're in an interesting spot where the US dollar as a currency, we all know that it's not going to go away anytime soon. And all these people who think it's just going to disappear maybe don't understand geopolitics, but it's an interesting time in the markets. Potentially, we will get some inflation readings, as we've been seeing lately, that will allow cuts to happen. And the Federal Reserve would like nothing more than to be able to cut rates, because right now the amount of interest being paid on the national debt is so insane that there is literally just a bottomless pit of ever increasing debt.
00:32:58.944 - 00:33:30.700, Speaker A: I've heard this argument in other macro podcasts I listen to that high rates are actually inflationary because you're giving all these rich people with dollars like 5%, and they're going to, what are they going to do with it? They're going to spend, they're going to buy assets with like the 5% yield. Do you think that holds any value? Because that kind of goes against, I guess, what we learn in economics. But maybe that is pending. Maybe higher rates is somewhat inflationary, and cutting could be better to manage inflation.
00:33:31.600 - 00:34:22.718, Speaker B: Yeah, well, actually, it's funny you say that unplanned, but let me show you one of my tweets, because I think I was the first person online to talk about this last year. Yeah, so this is February 23, when people were expecting that raising rates was going to fix this inflation problem. And I kind of realized from first principles at the time that, yeah, not so fast, cowboy. So, actually paying a large interest rate to all the financial asset holders creates more money, puts more money in the system. They're just not spending it, but just buying assets. So it encourages things that maybe are not conducive to getting the economy under control. If you scroll down here in this post I made about a year and a half ago, and Lyn Alden was sort of beating the drum around the same time.
00:34:22.718 - 00:35:03.260, Speaker B: Similarly, there are situations where increasing rates can cause tightening and disinflation. But when the debt is so high and there's so much money that he's giving out 5% risk free, it just gives so much extra printed wealth for no risk taking in the economy. And unfortunately, bonds are kind of like the odd asset out where we start needing the governments to incentivize bonds more. That's where you start getting to things like yield curve control, as we're seeing in Japan, or they force big entities to buy the bonds because somebody has to buy them.
00:35:05.440 - 00:35:36.484, Speaker C: So I will say, jordy, I mean, I don't know if you can ring the victory bell right now, because, of course, we don't know if this is the reason why, but inflation has come down, right? Raising rates presumably had an impact or was the main driver of rates, of interest rates coming down or, excuse me, inflation coming down to 3% as of today and 3.3% for core. It did work. We didn't have this catastrophic spiral that Lynn Alden really was beating the drum behind. So how would you explain that?
00:35:36.612 - 00:36:06.210, Speaker B: Oh, it's not. I know. I think you definitely can. I mean, this was 18 months ago, and 18 months ago, if you look at the interest rate curve, the futures were pricing in, like eight cuts by now, and we've had zero cuts. So the hire for longer has fully proven out. I mean, it's been 18 months. They haven't been able to do anything because, yeah, we're not at hyperinflation levels, at least the way to count it, but we are still above, way above target, I think, now with the deteriorating job data, for the first time in unemployment above four.
00:36:06.210 - 00:36:48.438, Speaker B: Unemployment already is a bad metric because it doesn't count all the people who are not actively looking for jobs, and that's been quite a large change over 2019. So right now what we're seeing is they're going to have a window where they will be able to cut rates a little bit. Obviously, Europe has already started. Other economies are really wanting to take the gas off the pedal a little bit and give a little bit of breathing, but we're just going to see more inflation. It's not going to go away, I think. And ultimately the national debt is the key differentiator. That takes us back to a time where we will need a bit of a reset for the entire economy.
00:36:48.438 - 00:37:42.560, Speaker B: So long way of saying that things like bitcoin will come back into play. I do feel weird listening to these macro podcasts because these guys all love gold so much that they just assume by default that gold will be the answer. Like that is the base currency. It's usually, you know, men over 45, and I understand that everyone's looking for a base currency apart from the dollar, and it makes sense because this is the 5000 year Lindy option. But I really feel that, you know, guys of your guys age, people in their twenties that are even in their thirties don't see gold in the same sort of way, and they're looking maybe for a digital alternative.
00:37:42.980 - 00:37:50.612, Speaker C: Don't you think? In some ways gold has been replaced by S and P 500 ETF's and index funds as the best store of value?
00:37:50.756 - 00:38:25.934, Speaker B: Yeah, probably. Stocks, I think are undoubtedly a good store of value because even in inflationary environments they will inflate as well. We're seeing this passive index effect where there's just money always going in the index without anyone even thinking about it, just automatically from pensions and everywhere else. So there's always a bid there. We're seeing s and P to new highs. For me, this is just even more inflationary. I mean, the cost of a hotel room is a metric to watch.
00:38:25.934 - 00:38:31.850, Speaker B: And I don't know about you guys, but I used to be able to get much nicer hotels for the same price like 510 years ago than now.
00:38:32.560 - 00:39:11.180, Speaker A: I definitely agree. I think the S and P is the best store value. But how do you think this? If the Fed is going to cut rates in September, maybe even in July? I think the market is pricing in an 85% probability that they'll cut by September. What do you think that does to asset prices? More notably crypto? We have the ETF happening presumably next week, rate cuts on the horizon. A lot of the crypto apes, the degens, they're banging their chests saying that this is bullish, we're going to go to Valhalla. Of course, it's not as simple as that. What do you think happens to the crypto markets as a result of this macro backdrop?
00:39:13.120 - 00:39:59.532, Speaker B: The macro backdrop has been holding us up from collapsing during a period where governments have started dumping their long held coins and we have to absorb it because stocks are at all time high. I think there is enough of a emotional reaction there that we'll be okay. This is just a blip because asset prices are still doing well. We have politics coming into play in the US. So I think both Biden and Trump are bullish in the sense of the existing government is going to want economy to be good in November. And I think as Trump starts to promise more and more printing and more and more promises of number go up, which I think you will, and that's his whole shtick. Pretty bullish going into end of year.
00:39:59.532 - 00:40:08.520, Speaker B: I think for crypto, a lot of stars are aligning. Next year there'll be a point where we'll get over our skis, I'm pretty sure.
00:40:08.940 - 00:40:28.630, Speaker A: Yeah, because I know crypto has been suffering recently because of the Germany government selling. Do you think it is as simple as after this idiosyncratic cell pressure subsides, we're just going to start going up? Can the markets be that simple or is it more complicated than that?
00:40:28.970 - 00:40:54.030, Speaker B: No, I think it's that simple. It's a lot to absorb. We underestimate sometimes when you look at the market cap of crypto at $2 trillion, and we think that if it's just a few percent, it's not going to matter. But these things move a lot based on front running things of these size, like in the billions of dollars, they'll still move markets up 1020 percent and then they'll rebalance after.
00:40:54.730 - 00:41:30.900, Speaker A: I guess if we're all bullish, I mean, I think we're all bullish on Eid ahead of the Etf into the ETF. I guess Justin kind of showed his case thesis as a potential eth beta play. But what do you think about, like, what do you guys think about eth beta? Like, do you think it makes sense to look for eth beta buy memes or does it just make sense to just be heavily allocated to eth, just ride the inflows, airdrop farm here and there, eke out some additional apy? That's personally how I'm positioned. But I'm wondering if the panel here have different thoughts on how to best be positioned into end of year.
00:41:31.360 - 00:42:25.902, Speaker C: I think for me, I mean, it always comes down to portfolio construction. Like, if you're almost all in on Zksync as opposed to ETH, right? That's probably a bad mistake, no matter how bullish you are or how much inside knowledge or technical knowledge you have. Because at the end of the day, these things are so correlated that if we have a downturn, if ETH goes down 50%, ZK sinks going down 75%, regardless of how good the tech is. So for me, it's all, you know, at this point, just about allocating small percentages here to projects that I want to learn more about and be involved in. But I think also at this time, like where we're at right now, there's no clear narrative or no clear innovation that I feel really excited about. And I think in times when you're not too excited, you just stick to the majors. I've also talked about my thesis, like, if we're not seeing new consumer apps and we're not seeing new innovation on the app layer that people will, like, really fall in love with and use, like we had in DeFi summer, that's probably when you would want to hold bitcoin.
00:42:25.902 - 00:42:34.530, Speaker C: But when there starts to be new innovation, new apps, things, people are getting excited about people moving on chain, that's when you want the community money, that's when you want the ETh.
00:42:36.070 - 00:43:03.210, Speaker A: Speaking of innovation on chain, I mean, celebrity coins, Iggy azalea coins, mother coins, you know, like. But hypothetically, I mean, she's trying to innovate on in her own way. And I think recently she struck a deal with DWF, the notorious market maker, and winter mute Jody. Like, whenever you see news like this, like, how do you make of this? Like, is this going to make token go up or.
00:43:03.560 - 00:43:18.104, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So obviously altcoins have been going down and there's fingers wanting to get pointed at somewhere. And market makers are these like, boogeyman that always are the ones responsible.
00:43:18.152 - 00:43:19.248, Speaker C: They control the price.
00:43:19.384 - 00:44:07.306, Speaker B: They control the price. They tell you what the price is. So there's a huge lack of understanding and education, like, of what market makers do and what some of them, maybe that cross certain boundaries, do. So Iggy, in this tweet, was pretty proud to announce about her coin that she cares so much about, that there's market makers now in TWF and wintermute. I'm not quite sure that she understands the basics of market makers and what they do, given that they don't really have centralized exchange listings and order book listings, most liquidity is, you know, traded on amms for these coins. Right? Like, these are tiny coins on amms. It's not clear to me that it needs a market maker when it's just on an amm.
00:44:07.306 - 00:44:36.180, Speaker B: And also, it's not clear to me that she understands that these guys are just probably just getting a call option and able to sell coins as they go up without actually providing much apart from their brand name. And it seems like she was getting a little bit of a pushback here from people in the comments. I saw that Kobe responded as well.
00:44:36.640 - 00:44:58.552, Speaker C: I think one day we need you to do a segment on how these market making deals are structured and what you should look out for when you're going to sign one. Because these things are crazy complex and it's insane to expect the average founder, the average person, no matter how financially literate they are, to understand these things. Like, this is something that you guys play in every day, and, like, we have no idea how it works. So it'd be cool to do a class on that.
00:44:58.736 - 00:44:59.768, Speaker A: Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah.
00:44:59.824 - 00:45:28.766, Speaker B: Justin, I mean, I saw, like, on our last episode, you got the highest commented liked comment. Was somebody saying that Justin is amazing at, like, asking questions that nobody, you know, feels comfortable to ask because they don't want to sound stupid, but you just, like, ask all the questions. So if you want to do next, one of the next couple episodes, your amazing preparation, and we can go through this, I think it would be very useful for people to understand, and there's a lot of misconceptions to go through.
00:45:28.798 - 00:45:35.650, Speaker C: Yeah, I have some of these contracts floating around. I'm sure you do, too. We can redact some of the names and participants and just talk through the structure of some of them.
00:45:36.430 - 00:46:44.888, Speaker B: Ultimately, I think it's very important thing to do because there's two types of products in crypto, and they're usually the same team that has to do both. One is the infrastructure, like the actual app that web3 users are supposed to be using. And then there's the coin, which is arguably, like, there's hundreds of millions of people on binance and coinbase, and you have a much bigger target market than the 1 million people that are doing things on chain. It's like 100 x, and you have products on both sides. And ultimately, there's a relationship between the two, because if one gets really hyped, and maybe the coin gets hyped, but they're not one to one, and everyone in the crypto space probably needs to understand more. I was told that at one of the large conferences, especially the investor ones, where they have all the funds, they're not really talking about the tech anymore. They're talking about token launches and what makes a good token launch and market makers and all this stuff, because ultimately, it's such a big part of the puzzle now that people can't ignore it.
00:46:44.984 - 00:47:22.796, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think it'd be great to go over. I mean, it feels like it's a dark forest out there if you don't live and breathe this world. I mean, also, when, even before you've built a project, when you're fundraising and you start pitching people that you think would be good investors and value add, I know you do a lot of investing, Jordy. A lot of these market makers will even want you to sign a market making agreement to have them invest. And then you're sort of, like, pre committing to a market maker before you've shopped around, before you raise money and can go to your investors that have experience and can, like, tell you whether this is a good deal or not. So it's. It's an interesting space, and I think a lot of founders fall into pitfalls there, and a lot of retail just alone thinks there's shady stuff happening.
00:47:22.796 - 00:47:25.320, Speaker C: So we should do a. An episode on that.
00:47:26.060 - 00:47:47.920, Speaker B: Okay, we'll do it. You'll be the questioner in chief, and we'll go through some of the interesting stuff there. Cool. I mean, let's plan for that, maybe not for next episode, which will be our anniversary one. We'll try to get some good guess for that, but let's do it for the next one. And how about we do some pastas? Taiki, you want to kick off?
00:47:48.500 - 00:48:15.534, Speaker A: Yeah. So I saw this pasta. I thought that was pretty funny. I think it's relevant to our previous conversation. So I think at Eat CC, there was this big cake that talked about all these layers, and no one ate the part where it says application layer, and the quote says the application layer untouched as usual. It's like all these people, you know, they want, you know, the permission layer, like all the infra, but no one wants to touch apps. You know, like, it's.
00:48:15.534 - 00:48:24.490, Speaker A: It's unfathomable to create an app in this space. So I just thought that was, like, pretty funny, and maybe this explains, etc. Well, how about did this cake am I.
00:48:26.950 - 00:48:39.990, Speaker C: Completely explains what's happening here? I thought this was, like, a cake that they had served some event here, and it's like, it is funny when you go to, like, these events always, like, the food table gets absolutely mobbed. It literally looks exactly like this. Always.
00:48:40.290 - 00:48:44.842, Speaker A: What's even in there? It's like blue, green, pink. Like, that's rainbow layers.
00:48:44.986 - 00:48:46.914, Speaker B: It's a rainbow layer, yeah.
00:48:47.042 - 00:48:53.110, Speaker A: Oh, okay. It's a tech stack. It's all mumble, jumbled, just like Ethereum.
00:48:54.450 - 00:48:54.786, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:54.818 - 00:49:16.422, Speaker C: So originally, I was going to present this pasta. It was going to be fun, novel, exciting, and really encapsulate my ETCC experience. I'm basically the guy here in the middle listening to these talks. So the pasta is. Maybe they have seen the tech and no one cares, but I'm not going to do you guys like that. I'm going to give you guys another pasta. Because Jordy had already sort of presented this image, so I wanted to keep it ecc themed.
00:49:16.422 - 00:49:34.436, Speaker C: So I want to tell you guys a little story that happened last night at Ravi. So, having a great time with some friends, I had some colleagues from Astaria, some former employees, some founders. We're having drinks, having a great old time. Delicious beer. And, you know, you're drinking a lot of beer. You got to go pee. So I go downstairs, I go to pee.
00:49:34.436 - 00:50:03.830, Speaker C: I've got my beer in one hand, I got my phone in the other, and up at this urinal, and I'm just sort of, you know, free dangling. My hands are tied. I'm just sort of unzipped. When you have a few drinks, you're just kind of hanging out there and chilling. And the show has gotten a little big, right? We got a lot of viewers of steady lads. And so I literally had this happen to me. One of our amazing viewers, super nice guy from Bulgaria, comes up to me, I'm peeing there, doing my thing, looking at my phone, texting, seeing what event to go to next, and he goes, hey, you're Justin Wright from study lads.
00:50:03.830 - 00:50:25.498, Speaker C: We had a little conversation, and then he looked down at me and he goes, you know, I really gotta learn how to pee like that. You're just multitasking. You got your hands tied. You're peeing like, how are you doing this? So it was like one of the better study lads introductions. People are not shy about saying hello, and I'd love to meet you guys, too. So anytime, whether I'm at the urinal in the stall, dancing, just come and.
00:50:25.514 - 00:50:27.270, Speaker B: Say hi, hands free.
00:50:27.570 - 00:50:32.330, Speaker A: I've never had this happen to me before, but I guess it happens. Just people. There's like, ten year olds.
00:50:32.410 - 00:50:35.990, Speaker C: We got to get you to a conference, I guess, at token 2049 Tyche.
00:50:36.370 - 00:50:43.082, Speaker A: Yeah. I have to be careful with public bathrooms. They're going to be people chasing me into urinals.
00:50:43.106 - 00:50:57.380, Speaker C: And Europe's. Europe's not big on the dividers. I don't know if you guys have noticed that. Not big on the dividers here. You don't get much privacy. So, you know, I'm doing the two hand thing. I'm trying to sort of, like, pivot my body a little bit to the right, and I hide, but, you know, is what it is.
00:50:58.800 - 00:51:34.310, Speaker B: Is what it is. I will share an AI pasta here. So this is perverse economic incentives, and it's the usual meme where Star wars characters are here. AI is going to be used to change the world as a tool to make the world better, right? As a tool to make the world better, right. And in the second, someone has, like, put some huge boobs on padme on the character.
00:51:34.650 - 00:51:36.270, Speaker C: I think it's Padme, right?
00:51:36.930 - 00:51:51.434, Speaker B: It is. Yeah. Yeah. Padme looks. Looks a little bit different here. Look, I understand that this is going to be prevalent. I talked to some anons who are telling me that the reason they're anon is they don't want their face to be out there.
00:51:51.434 - 00:52:05.750, Speaker B: Apparently, like us doing a podcast, we're at risk of people taking our. Our face and doing all kinds of porn or I don't know what with it. So we have to keep an eye out for people using.
00:52:06.130 - 00:52:12.830, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I got deep faked, actually, literally just last night. This was a deep fake. This isn't me.
00:52:17.570 - 00:52:18.590, Speaker A: Oh, man.
00:52:19.610 - 00:52:37.610, Speaker B: Cool. All right, so we'll let the audience on our twitter choose which pasta is the pasta of the week. Guys, we're closing. We're closing a year, please. Closing a year of episodes. So hopefully we'll get some good guests. Like a rare.
00:52:37.610 - 00:52:40.670, Speaker B: Like rare guests, like thicky, maybe. Hopefully.
00:52:41.850 - 00:52:42.630, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:44.780 - 00:52:48.860, Speaker B: And, yeah, we'll catch. We'll catch everybody then. Talk to you soon.
