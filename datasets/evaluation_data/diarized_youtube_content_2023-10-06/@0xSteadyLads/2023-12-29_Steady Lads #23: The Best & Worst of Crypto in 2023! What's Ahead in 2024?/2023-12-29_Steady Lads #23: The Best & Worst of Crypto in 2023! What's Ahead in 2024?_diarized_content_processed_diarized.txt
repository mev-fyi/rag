00:00:00.200 - 00:00:12.878, Speaker A: Sort of. Remember a few months ago, I happened to pull out my Solana saga phone, and I said, this thing is going to pay for itself. And sure enough, we're at the end of the year, and it's paid for itself a couple times over. So you really do have to try everything in this space.
00:00:12.966 - 00:00:15.754, Speaker B: That was a base call, Justin. You never know.
00:00:16.054 - 00:00:22.918, Speaker A: Now you can't get your hands on them. They're sold out. I think they're going for, like, four to five k on eBay, the last I checked, but, yeah.
00:00:23.046 - 00:00:24.214, Speaker C: Is your dump your bunk already?
00:00:24.254 - 00:00:25.968, Speaker B: You dump it? Did you dump the bunk?
00:00:26.126 - 00:00:29.344, Speaker A: Yeah, when I found out it was there, I dumped it immediately.
00:00:50.124 - 00:01:11.362, Speaker D: Welcome, everybody. Steady, lads. This is episode 23, and it's actually the last episode of 2023. So fitting. We have had quite a run. I think we've not missed a week now since we started this during the summer. So we're looking to end in a bang, and we have some very cool awards and predictions.
00:01:11.362 - 00:01:14.298, Speaker D: So, Justin, where are you at right now?
00:01:14.426 - 00:01:24.966, Speaker A: So I'm in Okinawa, Japan, taking a little Christmas vacation. Really amazing time here when I'm bundled, bundled up now, because it's freezing. It's like 01:30 a.m..
00:01:25.030 - 00:01:25.206, Speaker E: Here.
00:01:25.230 - 00:01:33.942, Speaker A: But I went scuba diving yesterday. Absolute blast. The people are phenomenal here, and, yeah, first time in Japan and absolutely loving it.
00:01:34.118 - 00:01:37.062, Speaker B: It was the water cold. You wear a wetsuit or something?
00:01:37.158 - 00:01:49.714, Speaker A: Yes, you wear a wetsuit, five millimeter wetsuit. But all the locals here think it's freezing because in the summer here, it's just, like, absurdly hot, and the water is like bath water. But here, the water was about 74 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface.
00:01:49.794 - 00:01:50.330, Speaker B: That's really nice.
00:01:50.362 - 00:01:55.938, Speaker A: So it's chilly without a wetsuit, but it's really not bad at all. So when you have a five millimeter wetsuit, it's like. It's just nothing.
00:01:55.986 - 00:01:56.698, Speaker E: It's really nice.
00:01:56.746 - 00:01:58.650, Speaker A: It was really beautiful time.
00:01:58.762 - 00:01:59.802, Speaker B: Nice. Nice.
00:01:59.938 - 00:02:03.554, Speaker C: I'm going there in March, so looking forward to enjoying Okinawa.
00:02:03.634 - 00:02:05.514, Speaker A: And we got to sync up our travel schedules better.
00:02:05.554 - 00:02:05.906, Speaker E: Taiki.
00:02:05.930 - 00:02:07.842, Speaker A: And make sure we're here at the same time.
00:02:07.978 - 00:02:13.374, Speaker D: Thiki, are you somewhere a bit warmer? You're kind of wearing your wife beater, so I'm guessing the temperature is a bit nicer there.
00:02:13.994 - 00:02:16.258, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm in Miami right now.
00:02:16.386 - 00:02:22.018, Speaker D: Miami. Is Miami coin still thing? Like, can you use Miami coin, or did they scrap that whole thing?
00:02:22.106 - 00:02:23.294, Speaker B: I don't know what that is.
00:02:23.954 - 00:02:46.044, Speaker D: Okay. It doesn't sound like that project went very well then. Yeah. So let's kick off on that side, then. So, you know, biggest L's of the year is something that we want to look at. You know, Miami Coin, I think, has not even made it to that list. But, Justin, how about you?
00:02:47.224 - 00:03:20.184, Speaker A: Yeah, for me, it's the famous J Cal tweet. If you're in crypto, pivot to AI, this was a funny one, almost sort of a bottom signal for us, signaled the sort of peak of the AI fundraising narrative in the bottom of crypto fundraising. And now it's funny because we're seeing messages or tweets from JCal saying he wants to do a podcast on Solana and learn more about it, which is absolutely hilarious. I feel like he's backing the wrong horse and we'll see what happens. But for me, that's the absolute bottom, and that tweet is going to be memeable for a long time.
00:03:20.304 - 00:03:49.352, Speaker D: Yeah, it feels like Jason has become the Jim Cramer. You know, Gensler is hard to not at least include in that category. The L's. He's been taking one after the other. You know, XRP had a victory, and it's been. It's been downhill from him since, since then. So I think that definitely at least an honorable mention for Mister Gensler right now.
00:03:49.448 - 00:04:00.512, Speaker A: But we also owe him a big one. I mean, he's pushing the BTC ETF through, hopefully in, knock on wood, in under two weeks. And he's sort of our savior, our kryptonite in some ways, but also our savior.
00:04:00.568 - 00:04:00.970, Speaker E: Right.
00:04:01.072 - 00:04:06.714, Speaker D: Thank you. Do you think he's like an undercover bitcoin, Maxi? He's just trying to kill all the alts and let bitcoin run, or what do you think?
00:04:07.574 - 00:04:12.554, Speaker B: Maybe. He's always talked pretty positively about bitcoin.
00:04:13.494 - 00:04:40.752, Speaker D: I think we have a few more l categories, but let's move on to something positive, or depends how you look at it. But we have a category for an award for founder of the year. It's been an interesting year in crypto. I think some founders have really stood out. Maybe let's start with Cliche thicky. Can you give us kind of a clear standout for you? Who's your founder of the year?
00:04:40.888 - 00:04:48.024, Speaker B: Yeah, I gotta say, it's gotta be Toli in Raj from the Solana foundation, especially given how well Solana is doing this year.
00:04:48.144 - 00:05:22.936, Speaker D: Yeah, I think Toli specifically, you know, I haven't been tracking Raj as much, but, you know, Toli's done both the podcast circuit and seemed like he's impressed a lot of people that he's spoken to. He's gone on both friendly and unfriendly podcasts, and he's a very likable guy. So he's stood out for making the community have this very positive role model. I would say Vitalik had maybe in the early days of Ethereum. Yeah, given the comeback, that's a very clear choice.
00:05:23.080 - 00:05:38.464, Speaker A: Sort of. Remember a few months ago, I happened to pull out my Solana saga phone and I said, this thing is going to pay for itself. And sure enough, we're at the end of the year and it's paid for itself a couple times over. So I just want to throw that out there. You really do have to try everything in this space.
00:05:38.544 - 00:05:41.324, Speaker B: That was a base call, Justin. You never know.
00:05:41.664 - 00:05:47.404, Speaker A: Now you can't get your hands on them. They're sold out. I think they're going for like four to five k on eBay, the last I checked.
00:05:49.384 - 00:05:50.608, Speaker C: Did you dump your bunk already?
00:05:50.656 - 00:05:52.360, Speaker B: You dump it? Did you dump the bulk?
00:05:52.512 - 00:05:55.724, Speaker A: Yeah, when I found out it was there, I dumped it immediately.
00:05:57.464 - 00:06:00.644, Speaker D: Speaking of Justin, like, who's your founder of the year?
00:06:01.224 - 00:06:43.296, Speaker A: For me, it has to go to Brian Armstrong. I mean, this guy, he's been in this space for so long and he's just been a consistently good actor. I had the privilege of meeting him and spending a lot of time chatting with him. And he is just an incredible guy. He's passionate about this space and he really is willing to, like, champion this fight against the SEC and basically just the fight against the establishment to defend. Crypto and Coinbase stock has done very well despite all, everything that's been thrown against it. I mean, how many companies are doing so well even though the SEC is investigating them and are actually in a lawsuit against them? So for me, Brian Armstrong has never blinked.
00:06:43.296 - 00:06:48.720, Speaker A: He's never doubted the space, and he's just been there for the past decade. So cheers to Brian Armstrong.
00:06:48.872 - 00:07:13.060, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, both of these picks so far, it's hard to argue with them. I mean, Brian has done an incredible job. He's my kind of founder, you know, just steady during the tough times and, you know, trying and experimenting different business lines during the good times. He's. He's had staking, he's had USDC, he's had all kinds of base. I mean, what a great one. Kudos to Coinbase.
00:07:13.060 - 00:07:27.140, Speaker D: They have multi xed off the lows like a meme coin. And hopefully we'll keep going and keep fighting the good fight against the regulators. Taiki, anything is good.
00:07:27.292 - 00:08:00.760, Speaker C: Yeah, I think my vote for best founder goes to CZ. I haven't really followed what happened to him right now, following everything that's happened. But, you know, he has like the four meme, right, that's been used throughout the, you know, the last twelve months. And even though there's so much fud, like Adam Cochran, just like, you know, calling CZ a scam or like, binance a scam, you know, like, no one lost money on Binance. I have no idea if he goes to jail. I have no idea how much fees Binance has to pay. But, you know, like, in hindsight, Binance was a net positive to the space.
00:08:00.760 - 00:08:13.656, Speaker C: They onboarded millions of users. Binance smart chain taught people how to use the EBM in the last bull market. So CZ, definitely similar to Brian, but net positive to this base overall, big fan.
00:08:13.760 - 00:09:18.684, Speaker D: I mean, clear winner, right? So Binance has had this albatross around its neck with the DOJ investigation, and they got to some settlement that looks like the company is still capturing a large percentage of the market share. So at least for 2023, he's managed to get through some of the toughest possible FuD. My founder of the year, I had to think about it a little bit. I have to say I have mixed feelings on some of the things that have been put out, but I feel like Pac man has changed the game in many ways in 2023. We'll get to open sea later on. But I feel like both blur and what he's shown with both points, using points for getting people excited for seasons and becoming active users and then, you know, this kind of bit more controversial, maybe the dark side of using it too far, in my opinion. And, you know, locking people's money in a smart contract for three months with a promise of points.
00:09:18.684 - 00:09:53.644, Speaker D: But no matter what, you know, he's clearly a young gun that experimenting. He's found the pulse of retail and, you know, you could say that he straddles the line between, like the. The power of the Ponzi and kind of like the legit, you know, backed by paradigm sort of meme. So he's my founder of the year. I haven't had the, you know, the chance to chat with him much, but somebody that I'm very excited to kind of keep an eye on also.
00:09:53.724 - 00:09:56.980, Speaker A: I believe he's 24, too, which is just extremely impressive.
00:09:57.012 - 00:09:58.676, Speaker E: I mean, you know, he must have.
00:09:58.780 - 00:10:10.452, Speaker A: Started blur when he was 23 or so, which is just wild. And really goes to show you, in this space, you can be the Persona that's not necessarily tied to your identity.
00:10:10.508 - 00:10:10.700, Speaker E: Right.
00:10:10.732 - 00:10:13.164, Speaker A: Like, he's Pac man. He's not his real identity.
00:10:13.204 - 00:10:15.012, Speaker E: He's not this 23 or 24 year.
00:10:15.028 - 00:10:24.834, Speaker A: Old kid living in the Bay Area trying to make something work. He's just Pac man. And he's the founder of a hundred million dollar plus, you know, Defi project or two of them, which is pretty cool.
00:10:25.494 - 00:10:57.818, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. And I think all four founders, they have a claim. So, uh, starting with Toli, I mean, just based on comeback, comeback and like price appreciation during the year, that's kind of insane. Brian Armstrong for, you know, steadfast, just kind of keep, keep pressing on and keep growing. I think CZ for surviving through enormous Fud and really kind of still standing strong. He's investigating DeFi now. Whatever he said he's doing, he's looking into all kinds of stuff.
00:10:57.818 - 00:11:25.662, Speaker D: And I think Pac man for innovating in the web, three kind of mantra. So very strong, very strong group of founders. Let's move a bit to the opposite. Let's go to the biggest backdroppers who has been like from a really high point and somehow managed to not capitalize on that opportunity or not kind of cash out maybe when things were good. Justin, we were talking about Opensea. Is that maybe top of your list?
00:11:25.758 - 00:12:03.024, Speaker A: Yeah, Opensea is going to be the big one for me. It's hard to say blur did anything surprising or new like we were sort of talking about earlier, but they really mastered this points, mechanic, gamification, etcetera. And Opensea had this maybe six month or even twelve month window to drop a token, sort of figure their, figure out what they were doing. And they sort of just stalled throughout the bear market. And since then they've actually laid off a lot of folks from their smart contract team. So they built this whole platform called Seaport, which is probably like the coolest thing they've actually came out with. And they've laid off their best team.
00:12:03.024 - 00:12:47.976, Speaker A: They never launched their token. They've sort of fumbled the bag with, you know, where NFTs are going. And now Haseeb put out a really interesting tweet recently that most of the NFT volume, whether it's real or not, has actually moved off of Ethereum Mainnet. So not only have they lost to blur, but they've also lost basically just NFT market share as a whole. And it's sort of hard to imagine a world where Opensea gets that market share back because our new projects not going to go where the incentives are, are they not going to just build out their new marketplaces, are they not going to just deploy in these new incentivized chains. And so Opensea went from a, what, a $10 billion plus valuation to who knows where it's at now? And they're a really great team. I'm certainly hoping for them, but I think they definitely could have done a lot more in this bear market than they did.
00:12:47.976 - 00:12:53.440, Speaker A: And so it's a little disappointing to see where they're at now, where they're sort of not a part of the NFT conversation.
00:12:53.592 - 00:13:08.352, Speaker D: I mean, it's tough. It's tough to compete in web three if you can't really kind of go into these Ponzi omics. We talk about having your token drop at the right time and create these flywheels. Somebody else is willing to do it, you might have an issue. Taiki, any backdrops that you've seen?
00:13:08.528 - 00:13:41.828, Speaker C: Yeah, I think zero x racer with Friendtech. I think Fronttech was this phenomenon at the very beginning of the year that this caught everyone's attention. People were very hopeful about, like, this is gonna get all these people to crypto. We had some athletes, like Grayson Allen download friendtech and whatnot, but then following that, we still don't know what the airdrop thing is going to look like next year. I think he tweets some random things that doesn't make him seem like a great person. And it seems like people are not really supporting friendtech anymore. I feel like there's a lot of promise.
00:13:41.828 - 00:13:59.700, Speaker C: People were really hopeful, but now there's not much to show for it. So hopefully, I think they talked about Frontec v two sometime next year, but definitely seems like they fumbled the bag. They definitely could have done something much better, but just seems like they. Yeah, just, like, dropped the bag.
00:13:59.892 - 00:14:17.316, Speaker D: Yeah. If you look at, like, what, how well they did during the bear market and nonexistent during the bull market, that seems like a wasted opportunity. You know, really was one of the very few things people were talking about during the summer. I remember, I don't know if the fees were too high where people were willing to pay them the five. 5%.
00:14:17.500 - 00:14:43.222, Speaker C: Yeah, 5% to the creator, 5% to the team. And then there was like some three, three mechanics going on which, you know, Jordy, you know, you love, and then as soon as one person defects, everyone's just defects. And then people lose money. They're pissed. There's no coins, there's, like, no airdrop, and they just leave. And I really haven't opened my friend tech in so long. When's the last time you guys opened your friend tech? Dicky and, Justin, I ended up selling.
00:14:43.278 - 00:14:55.074, Speaker E: Everything that wasn't my own personal keys just because there was really no need to hold those things. Sorry, Taki, I sold your key. I think I sold yours. Sticky and Jordy. You never made one, so I didn't have.
00:14:55.194 - 00:14:59.294, Speaker D: I never signed up, so I don't have nothing to apologize to people.
00:14:59.714 - 00:15:02.138, Speaker C: It's okay, Justin, I think. I think I sold your keys first.
00:15:02.186 - 00:15:10.414, Speaker E: So you dumped me into oblivion. I was, like, climbing the ladder. I was at, like, 0.15.17, and then. I know you sold a bunch.
00:15:12.514 - 00:15:49.482, Speaker B: I don't know how much I can blame on, obviously, like, people think Frentech fumbled the bag, but I do think a lot of, like, the casinos that were really popular in the sort of doldrums this year in, like, august with, like, both rollbit and friendtech, I think they were kind of just destined to, like, take a backseat once things started popping off again, because, like, I think the only reason why they were so popular during that time was because, like, we didn't have enough money to actually pump anything. So it was just, like, the lowest of the low liquidity things that could actually sustain a pump. And then as soon as money came back, like, we just went to, like, you know, the old casinos again.
00:15:49.618 - 00:16:04.602, Speaker E: Everyone was just craving something too, right? Like, we all just wanted something to do on chain. This is something that we all sort of believed could lead to this new social narrative. And so it sort of makes sense. I mean, it was a nice thing to carry us through to where we're at now.
00:16:04.738 - 00:16:29.654, Speaker D: I think another one that sort of stood out to me is some of the people that I kind of dropped Solana right at the wrong time. Like, Lido dropped Solana just before the run up because I think they were losing money, running liquid, staking there. And we've seen that Jito and, you know, some of the other ones have obviously capitalized some of the NFTs also. Like, frank the gods, I think.
00:16:29.694 - 00:16:30.554, Speaker C: Oh, my God.
00:16:33.494 - 00:16:35.154, Speaker D: That was a bit of a shit show.
00:16:35.454 - 00:16:57.076, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, yeah, he definitely fumbled. I think he tweeted recently, like, this. This has been the worst year of my life or something. He said that, and he, like, left Solana at $10 to go to Polygon, and now he's considering coming back or something. I mean, yeah, it's feel bad for the guy, but I guess from a business perspective, it was definitely the wrong decision.
00:16:57.220 - 00:17:24.948, Speaker D: You know, nfts in general, kind of Azuki's. There are a few other examples of drop bags, and we'll kind of see who manages to recover in 2024. How about we go to a fun one? Let's look at the meme of the year. I think we have some pretty epic ones. Meme of 2023. We've had some really nice memes. Let's start with Chamath.
00:17:24.948 - 00:17:27.384, Speaker D: This was a fun one, Justin.
00:17:27.684 - 00:17:52.302, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm keeping it with the all in theme. Huge fan of all it. I watch it every week, so I don't mean to rag on these guys, but Chamath's in the arena tweet was just absolutely hilarious. I think I was the one that brought this tweet to our attention for one of the pastas of the week a couple months ago. But this thing is just going to go down in history of one of the best tweets of 2023. Chamath says, I'm in there. You're reading a trying stuff.
00:17:52.302 - 00:18:12.204, Speaker E: Some will work, some won't, but always learning. And he really got just sort of torn apart just because he's, I don't want to say just a VC, but he's not really doing stuff. He's just investing in, sort of talking with companies, advising, picking what companies to invest in. And so he sort of got torn apart for this one. But absolutely hilarious.
00:18:12.664 - 00:18:26.312, Speaker D: I love the idea of this guy, you know, just imagining himself as a gladiator and putting it out. But I will have to fact check you, Brad. Maybe you can find the clip of who actually used pasta of the week with Chamath.
00:18:26.368 - 00:18:28.604, Speaker E: No, it was me. It was me for sure.
00:18:29.354 - 00:18:37.594, Speaker D: Okay, let's check one that went the rounds this week. Chamath has been gotten a little bit snarky.
00:18:37.674 - 00:18:40.986, Speaker A: You know, I'm a big all in fan. I think with this podcast, we're trying.
00:18:41.010 - 00:18:43.330, Speaker E: To go for all in vibes, but for crypto.
00:18:43.402 - 00:18:45.610, Speaker A: So I'm not anti chamath by any.
00:18:45.642 - 00:18:49.778, Speaker E: Means, but he got. He got absolutely roasted. Just posted.
00:18:49.866 - 00:18:52.634, Speaker A: I'm in the arena just sort of like mocking VC's.
00:18:52.714 - 00:18:57.350, Speaker D: How about you, Taiki? Any pasta? Sort of any meme that stood out.
00:18:57.462 - 00:19:20.074, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think if you're in CT, this is, you know, the pasta of the year, I think with crypto, capo. You know, I've been checking the charts all this time, avoiding noise from Twitter. The way the upward movement is happening, the way the high timeframe resistances are being tested, it clearly looks manipulated. No real demand. Once again, the biggest bull trap I've ever seen, but they won't trap me. And this is January 21, 2023.
00:19:20.074 - 00:19:51.674, Speaker C: And I feel like Capo is not even, like, he's kind of this mythical creature that just. His personality is like, just call everything bear traps or, sorry, bull traps, and call for twelve k price targets. And every time crypto pumps, people just, like, copypasta this tweet, every time a new capital comes out, he calls for a twelve k bitcoin, and then price immediately pumps after. So I just love crypto capital. Probably one of my favorite accounts. Uh, just, like, just not chuckle at.
00:19:51.974 - 00:19:56.950, Speaker D: Yeah, I think this is probably the CT meme, maybe of the year. What do you think, Vicki?
00:19:57.062 - 00:20:19.482, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like every, um. I think with every bull sort of cycle, like, somebody gets trapped in a really stubborn short, and they just make it their personality. They just become the main character. Bear, you know, this. This one was, like, capo, I think nap tiener just, like, refused to, like, flip bias. And at this point, they're just like, I'm not wrong. Like, I'm just early, and they can't flip now.
00:20:19.482 - 00:20:22.882, Speaker B: Like, if they flip, that's, like, a pure top signal.
00:20:23.018 - 00:20:27.174, Speaker D: It's the meme of the guy looking in the mirror. He's like, I'm not wrong. Market's wrong.
00:20:27.594 - 00:20:29.730, Speaker B: Exactly, exactly.
00:20:29.802 - 00:20:39.674, Speaker C: Yeah. That's, like, the most dangerous thing in crypto. Right. Because it's so tribal. Like, you can't make something your personality. Like, at that point, you just get fucked over. At some point, when you're public about.
00:20:39.714 - 00:20:47.254, Speaker B: It, it makes it even harder, because it's like, if you flip, then, like, that means everyone that you hate was wrong or was right.
00:20:48.034 - 00:20:49.194, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:20:49.314 - 00:21:29.956, Speaker D: So I have a meme. It's gonna be a self meme this year. I managed to recreate one of my favorite ct memes in real life, and I just had a sudden inspiration during the Balaji $1 million bet while I was in a club, and I managed to get the guy in the corner of the room while everybody else is partying. They don't know that within 90 days, the fiat system is going to collapse and bitcoin will go to 1 million. I've been trying to, like, do more of these live memes. I was in Thailand last week, and there was some butterflies going around, and I was really trying to get a selfie with one of the butterflies so I could do the meme with the guys. Like, you know, there's, like, a butterfly.
00:21:29.956 - 00:21:42.644, Speaker D: Like, is this. Yeah, I want to put it together, so I'll try for that in 2024. Hopefully I'll have a similar one. Vicki, any. Any memes recently?
00:21:43.064 - 00:21:43.328, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:43.336 - 00:21:55.244, Speaker B: I really like this one, I think. I think sailor is just such a. Such a sigma male, Chad, he's been carrying bitcoin this year, and this is just like the pinnacle of, like, a sailor ism that he tweeted out recently.
00:21:59.384 - 00:22:11.738, Speaker A: Which one's the best crypto asset? Well, bitcoin is the best crypto asset. What's the second best? There is no second best. There's no second best crypto asset. There's a crypto asset. It's called bitcoin. Right, right. There's no second best.
00:22:11.738 - 00:22:15.334, Speaker A: Okay, but take all your money, buy bitcoin.
00:22:17.514 - 00:22:32.322, Speaker D: All right. And last thing for 2023. You know, narratives. Crypto is all about narratives. They kind of drive the markets. They drive everyone's emotions. Curious, like, what you guys think was the narrative of the year for you, Taiki? Any narratives?
00:22:32.498 - 00:23:30.630, Speaker C: I don't wanna take anyone else's narrative, but I think generally, Solana has been just eye opening for everyone. And I think the narrative that will translate over to next cycle is the revival of these alt out ones. And if you think about it, in the past two years, since the market toughed, there hasn't been that much new innovation in crypto, so people just end up buying alto ones and meme coins. And unless I also feel like this is one of the reasons why crypto natives just have a bearish tune with where the markets are right now, because what new has nothing has changed. It's just new coins, new memes. And until something new happens, I feel like it's really hard to imagine that much more retail getting super excited about crypto. But, yeah, like, definitely Solana just surprising everyone and it forces everyone to be more open minded about Alta one's coming back.
00:23:30.630 - 00:23:35.790, Speaker C: And maybe the Ethereum killer or the Ethereum hedge narratives comes back again next cycle as well.
00:23:35.942 - 00:24:14.358, Speaker D: It's so funny. It feels like every year all the l one s just always do well, and there's unlimited appetite to launching ten more l one s at 10 billion ftv and just never seems to run out of appetite. And, yeah, Solana obviously, like, you know, coming back from Phoenix from the ashes, and I would say, like, the. The community that kind of stood at the core, you know, maybe like 5000 people, they all bought a mad lads and, you know, they just kind of hung out during the eight dollar price and made it through. So definitely one of the narratives for sure. Thank you. I've heard you talk about AI.
00:24:14.358 - 00:24:19.030, Speaker D: Is that something that you think is the narrative for last year or for New Year?
00:24:19.222 - 00:24:45.634, Speaker B: I think it carries over. I picked it kind of ironically, because I think it's not like a real. There's nothing there, just like pure vapor and ape impulse pattern matching. But I do think it's inevitable. There's been a few names that have done really well this year because of the AI sort of narrative, and I think it'll continue to next year.
00:24:46.384 - 00:24:47.764, Speaker D: Justin, how about you?
00:24:48.184 - 00:25:12.430, Speaker E: I'm actually going to call a little bit of an audible. I think the narrative of the year has to be the BTC ETF and not just the fact that it's happening. But we knew Blackrock had their application in well before the cointelegraph intern dropped that fake news. The fake news caused a pump, and then everyone started to freak out and think, wow, when the BTCE ETF actually happens, there is going to be this buying pressure.
00:25:12.552 - 00:25:40.418, Speaker D: I mean, Justin, like, I do want to say that, because on this podcast, I think we were the first out of any, any, like, other, you know, commentator in the market. We were the first. I think me and thiki were kind of quite clear that we were, like, all in long as soon as we saw the fake pump. And the reaction to it was. Was, like, so clearly bullish. I think you're right to pinpoint the fact that it hasn't fully retraced. And Bitcoin has been healthy ever since that fake news.
00:25:40.418 - 00:26:00.094, Speaker D: And from a game theory standpoint, it's one of those moments where people who have been on the sidelines are starting to be too scared of waiting too long, and they're looking at each other, and everyone's realizing that there is buying demand. They saw that there is. The fact that when this ETF does come out, there will be a candle.
00:26:00.474 - 00:26:09.522, Speaker B: I don't think people are going to sell until the inflows come in. Between the time it gets approved and it actually starts trading, I could see it just easily grinding up.
00:26:09.658 - 00:26:29.546, Speaker D: I think at some point, Avi also had a very similar take, and, you know, people, eventually, some of them packed on, but we called that very clearly and very strongly that exactly that move that kind of showed that there are people sidelined. There was sideline money, and it was going to come in very powerful.
00:26:29.690 - 00:26:56.944, Speaker E: Yeah, very interesting. And it just shows you this industry never stops. Amazingly, the fact that we can have this amazing run up solely based on the catalyst of a cointelegraph fake news announcement happening, because that's really what's happened over the last couple months. So it's truly wild. And now we're in uncharted territory. We don't know if the ETF's going to be sell the news because there's been a huge run up. So that's my narrative of the year.
00:26:57.844 - 00:27:28.554, Speaker D: Absolutely. It's been a defining one. Towards the end of the year, I think for me, the fact that bitcoin has had some changes and we have ordinals and BRC twenties is interesting. It's definitely a narrative. You know, it's the biggest crypto and we don't normally see like large changes. I'm not sure if, you know, security budget is solved because just because people are paying a lot of fees now doesn't mean that they'll still want to do the same use cases in 50 years when the problem will be really bad. But that has to be like one of the narratives.
00:27:28.554 - 00:28:09.240, Speaker D: And for me personally, people forgot about this now because we're at the end of the year, but at the beginning of the year, a certain character called GCR, maybe the best goat trader in all of crypto, blew my mind. He called for an echo bubble. I don't know how he saw that or it just came out of nowhere. We were after FTX and it was looking like a very horrible bear market was about to start and he just called that there was going to be an echo bubble. And he correctly called this very strong bounce off the lows. We've forgotten about it now, but kudos to GCR, I would say.
00:28:09.392 - 00:28:31.004, Speaker E: Isn't it also amazing? I remember when that happened and I was thinking, wow, we're in for a couple of years of terrible regulatory pressure, suppressed price, but that was actually the bottom. I mean, looking back on that, it's just so wild. That was the bottom for the regulatory, the bottom for price, the bottom for the social metrics. Just fascinating how that was just the perfect bottom.
00:28:31.384 - 00:28:59.092, Speaker D: And I think you will agree with me, but part of it feels like it's because a good chunk of the industry is about gambling. A lot of these meme coins and all this stuff is about gambling. And gambling sort of does well even in the worst of times because people just want to punt. There's this lottery ticket sort of frustration, you know, it shows that there's a resilience even. Even during the negative reflexivity.
00:28:59.268 - 00:29:02.664, Speaker B: The defensive industry, defensive.
00:29:06.124 - 00:29:07.624, Speaker C: Crypto becomes defensive.
00:29:09.564 - 00:29:28.504, Speaker D: Meth and meth and gamble fi. Cool. Awesome. Well, it's been. It's been quite a 2023. I'm kind of curious to hear you guys predictions on 2024 as we enter potentially a new type of market now. A lot of new things popping off.
00:29:28.504 - 00:29:46.524, Speaker D: Maybe. Let's start with what's going to be some of the new coins that you guys are very bullish on. Or maybe bearish on. Maybe. Let's start with bullish. Thinky. Out of all the new launches that have been telegraphed, what are you liking right now?
00:29:47.224 - 00:29:55.632, Speaker B: I think Monad seems like the most clear consensus. Bullish for an l, one for narrative, I guess, for its size.
00:29:55.768 - 00:30:15.604, Speaker D: Yeah, it's kind of crazy to me, having tracked that project from the very beginning. They've done such a good job of already pre launch making such a huge grab of expectations in mind. Space. Taiki, have you followed Monad?
00:30:15.984 - 00:30:23.720, Speaker C: Yeah, they're trying to do like a paralyzed EVM. Right. For our audience. Do you mind explaining the value prop of Monad?
00:30:23.832 - 00:31:08.704, Speaker D: Yeah. So obviously right now there's a lot of talk about Ethereum versus Solana and how Solana is paralyzed as an architecture and can perform a lot better because a lot of the executions can sort of be done on different nodes. But in reality that is possible with Geth. So I think with EVM, what Monad's doing is rewriting geth and kind of from the ground up, trying to paralyze executions. Ultimately, there's a world where you're making optimistic assumptions to get even faster and start pushing the boundaries there. So they're using C being from HFT and Keone, who's the founder, and we'll have him in January here. So I'm very excited to have him on soon.
00:31:08.704 - 00:31:34.124, Speaker D: He knows C. He understands how performance can come out of that world. So, yeah, I'm pretty clear that Monad's done well. Justin, you've seen Monad maybe with. They hired intern from CMS and they've hired a few other CT people. Do you think that those guys are kind of worth their weight in gold? It seems like they've really done an outstanding job of community building.
00:31:34.704 - 00:32:07.036, Speaker C: When I interviewed Cl, the cat on my channel, he mentioned that social media is the fundamentals, right? Because a lot of crypto, there's no way to value these things. So what you see online is people's source of truth. So if people see a community and they're like, oh, like, Monet is so good, Solana is so good. XYZ token is so good. Then it's like, oh, I guess that token is good. And then the token gets bit up and it kind of goes against. It goes along like what Vicki said as well about everything in crypto is a meme coin, right? It's just like all driven by narratives.
00:32:07.036 - 00:32:14.780, Speaker C: It's all like, yeah, just like narrative speculation and fundamentals might be there, but that's just part of the speculation.
00:32:14.932 - 00:32:27.544, Speaker D: I love what Cl said. I mean, it makes a lot of sense to me. I would say it's memes, it's social media, and it's also probably price, you know, charts. People look at the charts. Oh, it's breaking out. Like, it sort of, like, takes a life of its own. And we've seen that many times now.
00:32:27.544 - 00:32:33.302, Speaker D: Taiki, any launch that you're excited by?
00:32:33.428 - 00:33:21.654, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm honestly excited. With all these new app chains that's going to launch on Cosmos, if you look at the price action for all the cosmos tokens, everything except atom is pumping really, really hard. Adam is this cucked coin with all the politics and baggage, whereas any chain that launches using the Cosmos SDK just sends. I'm really excited for dimension. That's going to be this l one that's going to be built on top of Celestia, that's going to allow, or I guess their value prop is that launching an application specific roll ups should be as easy as launching a smart contract. And I think as Celestial launches, dimension launches, we're going to see this plethora of all these new role apps and the market has shown its hand. People love to bid l one tokens app train tokens.
00:33:21.654 - 00:33:34.616, Speaker C: So I think that's where most of the speculation is going to happen and we're going to see all these new chains launch on the ethereum side. Cosmos Solana SPM so excited for all these new l ones. More tokens to gamble on, I guess.
00:33:34.760 - 00:33:40.136, Speaker D: Always need more of those. Justin, how about you? What are you excited for launching? Justin?
00:33:40.160 - 00:34:29.015, Speaker E: Yeah, I think the big launch this year is going to be the layer zero token. They sort of announced this was coming in the first half of the year, I think late Q one, maybe Q two at the latest. And I think this token has just been hyped up for so long. And in my mind, the layer zero token sort of stands in its completely own new category because they've nailed it with the branding, right? Like layer Zero, it's this base layer that all chains sort of sit on top of and communicate through. And people are just absolutely hyped for this token. I also am very excited to see what happens because there's a Stargate token, right? And so, like, where does the value accrue? Who's holding Stargate when you can hold this new shiny token? Layer zero? But for me, I think that's probably going to be, you know, as far as market cap goes, for like project tokens specifically. This is going to be the biggest launch of 2024 that I'm pretty excited for.
00:34:29.159 - 00:34:58.436, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm ready for the bridge wars. I mean, layer zero raised at 3 billion, we have wormhole is also launching raised at two and a half billion. These are going to be massive valuations. I don't really see them going below their private raises in this kind of market environment. So especially with lower floats. So both layer zero and wormhole, very, very excited to kind of see those finally go to market and see what kind of airdrops and stimmies they create. Probably more free money to go around.
00:34:58.540 - 00:35:32.054, Speaker C: Speaking of airdrops, I think Eigen layer is also a hyped one. And I also feel like all these big airdrops, it might actually help create a bottom in each BTC, like a sustainable one. Just because the majority of these airdrops are going to be going to Ethereum, I guess, users, and if they get five figure airdrops, people will always sell all these drops into eat at some point. And that's going to be additional liquidity, like buy pressure and, you know, ETH community money. You know, like that can actually help stop ETH from being this cooked coin that's been, that it's been for the last twelve months.
00:35:32.394 - 00:36:05.728, Speaker E: The flip side of that Tyche is what is what you pointed out, I think, two weeks ago, which is sort of like, if you want to buy any token, any ERC 20, and speculate along the risk curve, you actually have to sell ETH to do it. Right, because you're, your base holding is ETH. You have to swap on uniswap, sell your ethan, buy this new coin. And it's sort of this interesting dynamic where like the better Ethereum does the worst token could theoretically do, because everyone has to sell the coin to buy the hot new stuff that's built on Ethereum. So it's a very interesting dynamic and I've, you know, been trying to think through that just a bit more.
00:36:05.816 - 00:36:19.444, Speaker C: Yeah, it just needs more retail inflow, I think, and maybe institutional interest to like bid ETH. We're seeing that with bitcoin. Um, and until there's new money, I just feel like ETH is going to just underperform, like hot new shiny stuff.
00:36:19.564 - 00:36:50.796, Speaker D: Yeah, I get later. I've seen in some of the estimates and private valuations that some people are estimating it launching at like 20 billion. I know that some people are extremely bullish on the ability for restaking to capture all kinds of new market segments so there's a lot of hype. That's definitely something to keep an eye on. Layer zero, obviously huge. Monad's going to be very, very hyped as well. How about like some of the ones that we think might not launch as you know, large as people are thinking.
00:36:50.796 - 00:36:53.676, Speaker D: Justin, any in that category for you?
00:36:53.820 - 00:37:48.678, Speaker E: Yeah, I think Zksync and Starkware, it seems like they've sort of like lost their window to launch. I keep going back to this, but I remember in 2021, I interviewed the head of VD from Stargate, excuse me, Starkware, and he was telling me that they were just like a few weeks away from launch, like all this big stuff was going to happen. And I'm not going to say they fumbled the bag, but they've certainly lost mind share. Right? Like you have, you have arbitraryment, optimism and mantle and many other like, layer twos on ethereum that are live now that people are actually using, experimenting with, comfortable with, and like, for all intents and purposes, the fees are cheap enough. Like, I know, like, that's not really the hot narrative. You know, people are with these fees, people are saying need to be sub one penny, but if you use arbitrary minus optimism, it's just a few dollars, which is frankly fine. And so, like, part of me wonders if Starkware and Zksync have sort of lost their window to launch.
00:37:48.678 - 00:38:10.322, Speaker E: I mean, I'm curious, what do you guys think? But it's like, is there an appetite for that? Or is the appetite all to l one right now? Like Solana, these new l one chains that are launching. So I don't know, I think they've sort of lost mind share a little bit. They've delayed and they've sort of kicked the can down the road for just a little bit too long. But we'll see. Also, I'm not sure the tech is ready too.
00:38:10.458 - 00:38:40.948, Speaker C: So I feel like from a narrative perspective, there's too many l two s that isn't able to differentiate itself from one or the other. And as more of these tokens launch, if a retail investor wants to buy an l two token, do they buy arb, op, scroll, Taiko, Ck, sync, Starkware? And I just feel like most of these l two tokens, it's gonna be a big airdrop, there's gonna be a bunch of hype. People will show it for like a month, and then people will just dump it because it's like, why do I hold this token? That's kind of like my prediction.
00:38:41.076 - 00:39:12.240, Speaker E: Do you really want to buy arbitrary optimism? And, like, hope that your l two is the one that wins on ethereum? Or do you want to just go to this, like, blue sky scenario where you're betting on soul or you're betting on avalanche, or just an entirely new l one? It does strike me as, like, this tricky spot where all of the l two s are competing with each other, but if you launch a new l one, you're sort of competing with yourself. You're doing something new. So I agree with you. And I think, like, the only differentiator between the l two s is the color that their token has, right? Optimism is red, arbitram is blue.
00:39:12.272 - 00:39:45.750, Speaker D: And, like, I mean, I'll take the other side here. I'm definitely, like, a bit more bullish on the l two wars. I think people are going to try different things. They're going to experiment more on the different l two s. Not just the blast kind of manta type of experimenting on the ponzionomics, but, you know, on the tech side, I think we'll have a lot more experiments. And I like some of these things, like, immutable, that are very focused on one sector and really just trying to nail, you know, what that subsection that they're doing instead of trying to build a whole new, like, mini ethereum as an l two. But I agree with you, Justin.
00:39:45.750 - 00:40:03.582, Speaker D: I think maybe, like, you know, some of the zksync type of ones might, might not necessarily do well after the airdrop. There's a lot of farming going on. But I wouldn't say that there's a clear path right now in terms of capturing users and attention.
00:40:03.758 - 00:40:16.514, Speaker C: Quick question for Thiki. Let's say we have all these l two tokens launch. Are you gonna be viewing all these tokens like short opportunities? From a trading perspective, how do you think about all these l two tokens coming up?
00:40:17.134 - 00:41:02.466, Speaker B: I do think that if they were to launch in this environment, they're gonna do quite well because people just come up with a narrative. I think all the new coins have done pretty well. I think a successful token launch is kind of subjective. I agree with you that the frac tool is going to play out like it's just going to Giga pump in the first month and then it's going to bleed slowly. But I'd argue that that's a success, because with all these tokens, I do feel like what you want to do is just try to get your token price, like the spot holders, into as many people as possible, as high as possible, and then slowly they'll bleed due to disinterest. And that'll give you, like, six months or a year of time to, like, actually, you know, deliver on what you promised and then be around for the next wave of pump again. Yeah.
00:41:02.610 - 00:41:08.698, Speaker C: And then it's like the twelve year, like, lockup finally. And then the team's like, yes, exactly.
00:41:08.746 - 00:41:24.780, Speaker B: You're seeing this play out with, like, the Solana Airdrops right now with, like, Jito. I think the valuation is, like, very, very high and I think Jup is going to have the same fractal. It's going to start trading very, very high and then it's going to, like, bleed. But, you know, that could be viewed as a success.
00:41:24.932 - 00:41:30.904, Speaker D: The one never ending kind of meme in crypto is new coin good. Always seems to be new coin good.
00:41:31.284 - 00:41:32.388, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:41:32.516 - 00:41:44.692, Speaker D: Here's a fun category. Who's going to make a comeback in 2024? Who's sort of being away, going to come back? And please don't, don't say anybody called Sam, please.
00:41:44.868 - 00:42:12.700, Speaker E: I think for me it's going to be Cardano and Charles Hodgkinson. I think this token, and this is not even. I'm not joking, this isn't ironic. I think this is going to be, like, the best performing, you know, top five, top ten or so that's currently existing token for the next year. And I don't have the conviction to hold it, but I do think it's going to outperform pretty much everything else in the top five, top ten. I think Seoul's done incredibly well. Kudos to them.
00:42:12.700 - 00:42:49.368, Speaker E: But how much more room does it have to go? Obviously, I'm a huge bull there, but sure, it could three x at best, right? But, like, how much can we really hope for? Maybe at four x's BTC, we'd be happy with a two x. But Cardano seems to me to be the coin that's, like, has the community, it has people that know the name, it has the mind share, it's got the, you know, exciting founder. And I really do think Cardano is going to be, like, the best performing asset in the crypto space over 2024. So we'll see. That's going to be a clip we can cut back to at the end of the year. But that's my bold prediction.
00:42:49.496 - 00:43:08.084, Speaker D: Yeah. I'm curious, like, for top, you know, top ten coins, you know, we'll. We'll exclude, for the purposes of top ten, the tether circle and Steve. So, you know, we can add dogecoin, polkadot and Matic man matic. Has broken through. It's overtaken Tron. So that's now in the top ten of non stable coin.
00:43:08.084 - 00:43:15.514, Speaker D: Taiki, which one of those ten do you. We're gonna look back in twelve months. Which one do you want to choose? Is the high performer?
00:43:15.974 - 00:43:31.942, Speaker C: Ironically, I mean, yeah, I think Cardano is a pretty good pick. It's like a meme coin. Right. But I think, ironically, Solana can just keep outperforming. I think it's taking the mantle because last cycle, Cardano was the hedge against ethereum. That was the narrative. And then, like, 100 x.
00:43:31.942 - 00:43:39.914, Speaker C: And I think this cycle, Solana is the hedge against ethereum, according to the eyes of retail and even to the eyes of Jason Calacanis.
00:43:39.954 - 00:43:40.106, Speaker E: Right.
00:43:40.130 - 00:44:05.034, Speaker C: Like, at some point, he's going to have Anatolia on this podcast. You know, he's going to buy Sol and be like, wow. Like, look how open minded I am. You know, I changed my mind on Solana. I'm so smart. I just feel like Solana is going to become, like, the shelling point of a success story in crypto. And if you want to hedge your Ethereum holdings by Solana, that might be the narrative that just takes it to greater heights and even all time highs, like, next year, I wouldn't be surprised.
00:44:05.414 - 00:44:10.314, Speaker D: Thinky out of top ten, which one do you like to bet on?
00:44:11.214 - 00:44:12.894, Speaker B: I'm probably going to bet on bitcoin.
00:44:13.054 - 00:44:15.870, Speaker D: What do you see bitcoin ending up at?
00:44:16.022 - 00:44:22.110, Speaker B: I feel like I always have to revise my upwards estimates. I don't know. I'll just throw out 100k, just randomly.
00:44:22.222 - 00:44:26.474, Speaker D: So you feel like no other coin will sort of more than 2.5 x out of the top ten?
00:44:27.394 - 00:44:28.894, Speaker B: I don't think. It's not from here.
00:44:29.234 - 00:44:59.978, Speaker D: Interesting. Yeah, I mean, I'm gonna go classic with you. I will choose Ethereum. I think it's massively under, kind of performed in 2023 and kind of suffered from this, like, mid curve thing that we all kind of spoke about in previous episodes. But I think it's time for the revenge of the seath, and we will have quite a huge year for Ethereum. I think the ETF narrative will pick up. I think the supply will keep shrinking.
00:44:59.978 - 00:45:29.690, Speaker D: And I just see a lot of things aligning. There is not a lot of supply overhang, and I think it's massive. I think people underestimate over the year plus timeframe how supply overhangs can matter. And I worry for Seoul as an asset. I like the sole ecosystem. I think a lot of the apps and a lot of the spls will do really well. The fact that there is billion dollars just kind of constantly unlocking of new Solana is not very bullish, in my opinion.
00:45:29.690 - 00:45:54.652, Speaker D: The one dark horse, I'll say is polygon. It's had quite a good run. I would give it a good 30% chance. I think it's risky. It's a worse risk reward, in my opinion, than ETH. But there's a huge indian community that's growing and that economy is doing very well. They have a coin that they can kind of call their own that a lot of the indian builders have been looking at.
00:45:54.652 - 00:46:12.852, Speaker D: It's great. Ck tech. I think they're ahead of the game on that side. So that's my dark horse. So yeah, we'll look back in twelve months and see if it was Solana, Cardano, something, ethereum, polygon or bitcoin. Or maybe we're all wrong and Polkadot makes a comeback.
00:46:12.988 - 00:46:15.104, Speaker C: XRP, the standard.
00:46:16.884 - 00:46:25.420, Speaker D: Who else do you guys think will make a comeback? So we've had some characters take a beating. Is any of them gonna come back? What do you think, Taiki?
00:46:25.572 - 00:46:46.160, Speaker C: I definitely think. I mean, so I'm gonna take. So I'm not even sure if he ever like, died, but I think he took a beating, you know, after like the whole, you know, every billionaire is calling me to buy Solana or like whatever. Like whatever that tweet was. If you think about it. I mean, all his plays have done really well this year. Like Solana, helium, like deep and stuff.
00:46:46.160 - 00:47:15.664, Speaker C: I think he was early into the, say round, like 50 million FTP or something. And people love to hate on him because I guess it doesn't go with the ethereum ideals, speed over security, etcetera. But from an investing perspective, he's been contrarian and he's been right. So I think he might have another arc, right. His profile might reach higher highs next cycle relative to last cycle. So big up to Kasamani.
00:47:16.244 - 00:47:37.704, Speaker D: That's definitely a good chance one, because those type of characters have very large variants. They write it all the way to the top and they don't sell. But if it keeps going, they can 100 x and then they can -95% as well. So money is a good high variance bet. Justin, any comeback stories you see forming?
00:47:39.014 - 00:48:18.870, Speaker E: I'm not sure about comeback, but I will say I'm like, I think this is going to be the year that we get some really big new voices and new advocates for crypto. Part of me wonders if Chabot is actually that person we've been talking about all in a lot. But he, you know, he knows about blockchain. He's bought a lot of Solana before. It seems like he did well on it and sold the top. And I'm sort of wondering if he's going to come around and sort of go head to head with J Cal on the podcast and sort of be a champion for crypto or it could be sort of someone else from lever field. But I think this is going to be the year with the ETF that we're going to get some really big voices supporting crypto, which I'm actually really excited about.
00:48:18.870 - 00:48:20.198, Speaker E: I think that's going to be really helpful.
00:48:20.246 - 00:48:40.704, Speaker D: So just think, the all in fanboy wants all in podcast to be the crypto comeback story. That'll be cool. It'll be cool to see. They definitely seem to be more interested in it. Again, thank you. I know you, maybe you're not as bullish on how the year is going to play out. Do you think capital maybe makes a comeback?
00:48:41.324 - 00:48:58.024, Speaker B: Yeah. My, I guess prediction for 24 is that we see kind of like a one or two quarter top after the ETF gets approved. So, yeah, I do expect, you know, Capo's time in the sun will come soon.
00:48:58.604 - 00:49:04.300, Speaker D: Are we getting twelve k? Is twelve k predestined? How bad really can it get, though?
00:49:04.452 - 00:49:15.144, Speaker B: I don't know. I don't think you can get that bad. But like, these things always go a lot higher and lower than I expect. So who knows? You might see like a weird candle just because of like liquidity.
00:49:16.244 - 00:49:34.496, Speaker D: This is true. Well, one last category we want to kind of go for dark horses, non consensus. What, what kind of categories or what, what segments are we kind of viewing as a dark horse that could take hold in 2024? Taiki, what do you think?
00:49:34.680 - 00:50:09.420, Speaker C: Yeah, so I kind of have two somewhat tangential, but the one dark horse category I think people are overlooking is decentralized social. Social fi. We've already seen friendtech just take over the timeline for a few months and just open the imagine like, you know, open up, I guess like the dreams of, you know, mass adoption. Of course, fintech didn't really do that well, but I think that was somewhat of a test pump. And whoever figures it out, maybe it is front tech v too, right? They drop a token. Maybe it's bit cloud. They have $100 million in the treasury.
00:50:09.420 - 00:50:51.512, Speaker C: Or maybe there's other, I think there's a project called yo lol that is backed by Coinbase. I feel like one of those projects are going to just do something really well and just take over to my share again and be like, wow, we saw what happened to frontech. This is the real deal. And then people are going to speculate really, really hard. And another thing, this is somewhat of a comeback. I wanted to add this as well, but I think Mark Cuban, I think he could also be a main character sometime next cycle. He's just made, like, a billion dollars or a few billion dollars selling the Dallas mavericks or some of his stake, and he's tweeting about ZK technology, and maybe he wants to become, you know, Michael Saylor of Ethereum.
00:50:51.568 - 00:50:51.760, Speaker D: Right?
00:50:51.792 - 00:51:04.144, Speaker C: Like, maybe he just becomes this ETH main character. That could be some black swan slash dark horse that people are overlooking. And he just, like, starts aping into Ponzi's, you know, like, like iron finance and stuff.
00:51:04.304 - 00:51:16.934, Speaker D: If Trump, like, wins the election, you know, and he's kind of into this nfts and all this stuff. And then Cuban starts becoming political and crypto becomes on the main stage that that will be, like, a fascinating world to live in, I would say.
00:51:17.064 - 00:51:28.722, Speaker C: Yeah, that'll be good for everyone. I mean, you know, like, politics aside, like, you know, like, just general price action wise, I think that's gonna be good for everyone. So, yeah, these, like, social and Mark Cuban, I guess, dark horses.
00:51:28.858 - 00:52:01.786, Speaker E: It strikes me as funny that I think crypto is going to get more and more political. Like, I love talking how, like, arbitrary is the blue coin and optimism is the red coin, which sort of reminds me of Democrats and Republicans. And I think we're going to see more and more of this tribalism as, you know, like, Trump's issuing nfts on Polygon, right? Maybe that becomes the republican chain, and maybe Mark Cuban goes to optimism or arbitrary, and that's more of a liberal or left leaning chain. I think we're going to see some more alignment with that where people, like, follow their favorite politicians, influencers, etcetera.
00:52:01.970 - 00:52:13.544, Speaker D: Interesting. Yeah, I mean, crypto can reflect the divisions of the real world. Just like we have divisions between the cults and the religions in crypto as well.
00:52:13.844 - 00:52:18.704, Speaker B: They're like different sports teams. I feel like, you know, we're all just, like, cheering for your favorite team.
00:52:19.684 - 00:52:25.584, Speaker D: Definitely feels like that. And speaking of thick, yeah, I think you have a dark force category.
00:52:26.484 - 00:52:55.988, Speaker B: I think, like, meme coins and gambling, but, like, not in, like, the form that you expect. But I do think this, I guess this is kind of a cinema take, but I do think, like, everything, it has kind of just gotten, like, meme coin inflows. And as long as you're the best in your category, and you are, I guess, like alive and still, like there's a possible chance you're going to ship something that you just get a huge premium when money's flowing into the ecosystem. So, yeah, more of that to continue.
00:52:56.156 - 00:53:01.268, Speaker D: So you kind of think that all this tech, all this other stuff doesn't really matter. People just want a nice way to gamble.
00:53:01.396 - 00:53:20.324, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I think the CT natives have kind of figured it out, which is why we're so surprised that like, oh, why are l one s pumping again? Like we've already kind of figured out the tech, but I still think like, you know, the masses haven't really figured it out yet. It's still like, you know, something mystical and new and promising. So it might take a few more cycles for.
00:53:20.624 - 00:53:33.538, Speaker D: I've seen some of the this like, taken some of my trading telegram chats where people are saying that they feel like, you know, trading these like rotations between all these different coins is like the best video game they've ever played. It's like the most addictive video game.
00:53:33.586 - 00:53:44.734, Speaker C: And that thesis on chain is crypto gaming, you know, like that. That's my thesis. This is the best gaming entertainment industry ever.
00:53:45.434 - 00:53:50.650, Speaker D: Hopefully there's something more than that. Justin, any categories that you see as a dark horse?
00:53:50.762 - 00:54:31.590, Speaker E: Yeah, for me it's stable coins. The stablecoin market cap seems to have bottomed. And I think from here on out in 2024, the stablecoin market cap will basically just be up only. And I think more specifically, the sort of thing that's going to surprise us next year is actually CBDCs, which I'm fairly excited about. I think there's a huge narrative of different nations and countries buying BTC as a way to hedge against currency risk and whatnot. But I actually think the big thing we're going to see is some major countries launch CBDC is we're just now starting to hear about countries exploring it, releasing some papers. And I think, you know, one semi major nation is going to launch a CBDC on a public blockchain.
00:54:31.590 - 00:54:35.302, Speaker E: And I think we're all going to be very impressed by that. I think it's going to be a new narrative.
00:54:35.478 - 00:54:48.638, Speaker D: Wow. I mean, I feel like cbdcs are maybe, you know, 510 years away, but it's interesting. We went from meme coins to stable coins being like the two complete extremes for a dark horse. Yeah.
00:54:48.806 - 00:55:17.876, Speaker C: If I can just quickly chime in, like, Brad, if you can share the screen, there's this website called naivetracker.com and it kind of tracks naive Bukele. He's like the president of El Salvador and he's up 0.01% on his bitcoin purchases. And it'll be cool if bitcoin starts pumping and El Salvador's economy improves as a result of this, if other start.
00:55:17.900 - 00:55:19.060, Speaker D: To FOMo into BTC.
00:55:19.132 - 00:55:55.560, Speaker C: And, you know, you have to kind of think about this type of stuff, right? Like, you kind of have to think about, like, bull market narratives. And I just love the fact that he just aped in at the top and then he just, like, DCA'd and, like, double down at the bottom. He actually has, like, a literal bottom by, like, post FTX. So, you know, big up to naive. And El Salvador, I hope he ends up being successful, but, yeah, like, countries adopting crypto, right? Like, you have to think about all these out there narratives that could just catalyze us to some super cycle. Yeah, Susan talked about.
00:55:55.752 - 00:56:13.744, Speaker D: Yeah, we saw Argentina obviously kind of take a direction of going in that way, and we'll see if other countries are also interested. I think even countries as large as Brazil at some point might give a look to crypto for, for fixing some currency issues.
00:56:14.324 - 00:56:15.980, Speaker C: Jordy, what are your predictions?
00:56:16.132 - 00:57:19.368, Speaker D: So the one thing I'm very bullish on as a dark horse category is steady lads. So I think just, you know, both the show collectively, I think we will kind of keep improving, getting very, very top guests, but also, I think individually, some of the people on the show, I'm expecting thicky to kind of go into his villain mode and short the hell out of the ETf pump and start becoming a main character. One of the top performing traders, maybe, of 2024. I think Justin has some cool, cool stuff they're working on now with Staria. I think Taiki subscribers are going back up and he's in a groove now. We have all kinds of new research and new podcasts doing so. And I'll kind of, like, quickly show Cellini, my firm, you know, we've survived through the bear market and, you know, we've hired some super talented people and I'm very excited for 2024.
00:57:19.368 - 00:57:41.420, Speaker D: So I think steady lads in twelve months will be, will be doing very, very well individually and collectively together. So hope our audience is going to join us on that journey. We hope you all will also have an amazing 2024. And we'll be here to chat with you as we kind of get all the developments over the next month. So catch you next year.
00:57:41.532 - 00:57:42.076, Speaker E: Happy New Year.
00:57:42.100 - 00:57:44.284, Speaker C: Herbert bullish on the lads.
00:57:44.444 - 00:57:46.484, Speaker B: That was a good finish. I like that one.
