00:00:00.200 - 00:00:03.390, Speaker A: Crypto. People don't like talking about burning out mental health and whatnot.
00:00:03.422 - 00:00:04.294, Speaker UNK: But I think it's something.
00:00:04.334 - 00:00:07.494, Speaker A: That we all deal with. What steps do you guys take to, like, not burn out?
00:00:07.574 - 00:00:30.778, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's tough, especially in crypto. Like, it is. It gets kind of demoralizing. I think, like, for me, focusing on, like, the other parts of my life that I am grateful for, really help for me, that might be spending time with my family or spending time with my girlfriend or spending time with, like, some of my friends that don't know anything about crypto going outside, just, like, remembering that, like, even if this all fails, life's still pretty good. It helps me, you know, get back on my feet and try again tomorrow.
00:00:30.866 - 00:00:50.522, Speaker A: There's, like, very few new innovative things launching, and then everyone in the real world is just asked you, like, wait, you're still in crypto? Like, I thought crypto's dead. Like, what happened? Yeah, it's tough for me. I don't worry about too much about the price. I just hold ETH, which is nice, so I don't have to think too much about it mentally. Like, in terms of struggle, not getting enough sleep.
00:00:50.658 - 00:00:51.450, Speaker UNK: Is the only thing.
00:00:51.482 - 00:00:55.818, Speaker A: That kills me. I try to somehow force the sleep in.
00:00:55.986 - 00:00:56.714, Speaker UNK: That's the one thing.
