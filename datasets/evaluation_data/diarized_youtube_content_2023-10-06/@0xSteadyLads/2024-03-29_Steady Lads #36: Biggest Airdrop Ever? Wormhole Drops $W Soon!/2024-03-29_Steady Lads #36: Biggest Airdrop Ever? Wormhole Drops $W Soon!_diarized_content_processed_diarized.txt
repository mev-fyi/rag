00:00:22.240 - 00:00:36.986, Speaker A: All right, welcome, everybody. This is officially the start. We're doing a live episode, episode 36. I'm Jordy. I'm the CIO and founder of Salini Capital. We have Justin with us, CEO of Astaria and base lover. Apparently he's into base.
00:00:36.986 - 00:01:04.444, Speaker A: He's going to tell us why. And we have thiki, who has been trading nonstop. Grinding. Eyes are red. That's the sign of a champion. He's grinding, powering through and, you know, unfortunately, we don't have Tyche with us, but also fortunately, because the reason he is not with us is he has gotten engaged and this is his engagement week. He has shared this nice picture.
00:01:04.444 - 00:01:08.404, Speaker A: That's quite a squiggly smiley face there.
00:01:08.784 - 00:01:10.244, Speaker B: She looks so happy.
00:01:12.944 - 00:01:21.236, Speaker A: I like the comments, man. These guys are like. They're just eating and breeding crypto. The comment says, congrats. Why is the hat off? You know, they want the hat to stay on.
00:01:21.340 - 00:01:22.304, Speaker C: That's funny.
00:01:26.044 - 00:01:37.464, Speaker B: Super happy for him. And when, when he told us about this a couple weeks ago, I just made him promise us he wouldn't do a cringe caption, like, I sold the top or something. Like, I was just very happy. There's nothing crypto related in that.
00:01:38.644 - 00:02:13.714, Speaker A: You know, I love to see, like, how much engagement that post got. You know, we're all busy trying to make money and grind, but, like, you know, 4000 likes and, like, you know, six figure views on a post like that, that feels good. You know, there is a community at the heart of everything going on. And, you know, obviously, we all, we all love taiki and looking forward to congratulating him when, when he's back next week. Just to get straight into the comments, someone's saying, bro, the hat's going 100. Look like some. Some.
00:02:13.714 - 00:02:30.734, Speaker A: The smartest people I know are all long, this whiff thing and all of the, like, the absolute giga brains. I'm personally, like, not, not getting involved either way. Long, long, short. But thinky. Are you. Are you following the, the whiff or are you fading?
00:02:31.274 - 00:02:33.934, Speaker C: Sidelined. Sidelines.
00:02:35.234 - 00:03:04.844, Speaker A: If there was one meme coin, I mean. Well, I think it's true for thiki. I'm on the opposite side of the spectrum here in Singapore, so I'm burning the midnight oil. But let's talk a little bit about the state of the meme coin nation, given that we're still in meme coin season. Vicky, are you preferring doge right now? I think there's some April. It's always the April catalyst for Doge, right?
00:03:05.844 - 00:03:26.784, Speaker C: Always April catalysts. But doing really well. They had obviously April fools run up and there's a Coinbase futures launch on April 1. And something else. I can't remember what it was, but there's a lot of catalysts going on for doge right now, which is why it's been doing well despite being such a big market cap token.
00:03:28.404 - 00:03:33.778, Speaker A: There's the 420 meme. Right, like that. That's always historically been part of that culture.
00:03:33.826 - 00:03:52.374, Speaker C: And elon and 420, oh, it was the coinbase suit. They, they, you know, didn't win the dismissal. So these things that were already cemented as non securities, just doge, litecoin, BCH got like a bid. Really heavy bid, actually. They're all up like 40% plus.
00:03:53.594 - 00:03:53.930, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:53.962 - 00:03:55.934, Speaker C: Because of their superior status.
00:03:58.334 - 00:04:08.074, Speaker A: Yeah. Justin, what do you think about BCH? I know it's a, it's maybe not the most active chain, but I think.
00:04:09.174 - 00:04:25.954, Speaker B: I don't have any thoughts on it. I think there's probably better places to be. I haven't followed BCh, frankly. I hadn't heard of BC. I haven't heard of BCH in years. It feels like it's been a while, but I just think there's much better places to play around than things like BCH. Like, I'd much rather buy doge than, than BCH, that's for sure.
00:04:25.954 - 00:04:27.374, Speaker B: Or.
00:04:32.514 - 00:05:09.210, Speaker A: I had heard of it. I mean, like they were trying to do smart BCH last cycle and they were trying to figure out what the hell smart BCh, you know, smart contracts we're going to do. I don't personally understand the dinosaur buyers. I never understand who is buying litecoin BCh because it's just a distribution thing. I guess that's the play. It's that the fact that they have the ability to maybe get good distribution on a platform where normies will get in either because, you know, they're not securities, they've been around a long time and they're sort of decentralized. But yeah, maybe those are the original meme coins.
00:05:09.210 - 00:05:23.386, Speaker A: Right? Like litecoin is a meme coin. I don't think anybody could make a strong claim that it's not a meme coin. And maybe BCH at this point similarly, is in that category, just like those jordy.
00:05:23.490 - 00:05:36.854, Speaker B: So litecoin had its having like nine months ago, I think in the bear market maybe a little less. And seemingly the halving had no effect. Why do you think the halving is presumed to have an effect for bitcoin but not litecoin and these other dinos?
00:05:39.594 - 00:06:10.926, Speaker A: The notional amount that bitcoin emits is just so enormous that going from 10 billion to 5 billion, maybe eventually to 2.5 billion is meaningful enough, then I don't know for litecoin exactly what that community is looking at. What's this crazy color box you're in? Let's show a little bit around. This is what it actually looks like. It's an office that seems to have.
00:06:10.950 - 00:06:12.234, Speaker C: A lot of refraction.
00:06:15.994 - 00:06:36.974, Speaker A: But let's talk a little bit about base. So Justin, you were saying as we started the show that you're starting to look into base, and I am seeing a lot of controversy about base on the timeline. Some people are saying that it's base season, then others are saying that it's a very forced narrative. It feels very artificial, and everybody was shilling at the same time. Oh, we're going from solana to base. What do you think's going on?
00:06:37.274 - 00:07:24.226, Speaker B: So there's a lot of truth to the fact that anything that happens in the ethereum ecosystem is very much a forced narrative, in my opinion, because these like legacy ethereum influencers and the Ethereum ogs, like when they get behind something, it does feel very forced because they're the ones getting angel allocations to the big ethereum projects. They're the ones always like pumping the big stuff on the timeline. But like, if you actually look at the metrics and what's happening, if you look on Defi llama, like the base TVL growth is insane. And to base his credit, like, they are very developer focused. Jesse, who is the founder of base and at Coinbase, is extremely involved. Like involved to the level of some of these other founders. Like, you know, he's a good actor, not like Do Kwan, but like he's as active as do Kwan, helping projects grow.
00:07:24.226 - 00:07:49.904, Speaker B: Like getting them on base. That's an unfair comparison. He's obviously a good dude. But I think all of the new Ethereum developments and deployments are happening on base, which is really interesting. So like I said, we launched Astaria on base first. The coinbase team was super supportive and helpful there, and I think base is really going to do well over the next several months. Degen is the meme coin of the month on base.
00:07:49.904 - 00:07:59.516, Speaker B: Djen launched a layer three, apparently that literally just went live. And Degen is the gas token. And this layer three is built on base, but it's an arbitrum orbit chain as far as I know.
00:07:59.620 - 00:08:02.612, Speaker A: Wait, what? It's an arbitrum chain on base?
00:08:02.788 - 00:08:10.904, Speaker B: Yeah. So base is optimism. And then they're doing an arbitrum chain on top of that as a layer three, because that was the only way they could figure out how to get Djen as the gas token.
00:08:11.864 - 00:08:20.864, Speaker A: Oh, okay. So the. Well, I mean, mantle is an optimism stack, and they've, they've twiddled enough to make it the gas token. But I guess maybe we can connect.
00:08:20.904 - 00:08:25.844, Speaker B: Them to your team. Connect the DJ team.
00:08:27.104 - 00:08:50.082, Speaker A: That, that is surprising, though, that they chose a path. It is quite interesting that base is, at this point, I would say, the de facto chain for optimism. I don't think that Op is any longer, you know, like, carrying the flag for the optimism ecosystem. The op sort of, you know, stack at this point is, has a flag bearer, which is base, I would say. Is that, is that a fair thing to say?
00:08:50.258 - 00:09:27.774, Speaker B: Totally. And I mean, also, just look at this, the TVL growth, right? So if you look at the one month change of base, it's at 150% with current TVL, a little over a billion, which is pretty impressive, right? Like, that puts it over polygon, that puts it over optimism, that puts it over some of these other chains that are just sort of getting started well above Cardano. Um, and we'll see if it can flip things like arbitrum and blast and Solana. Um, they have a huge disadvantage by not having a token. I am personally of the belief that that will change. I think they will have a token, but I think they're, the timeline of that is just what's uncertain. But I am pretty confident they're going to end up decentralizing this thing.
00:09:27.774 - 00:09:49.834, Speaker B: Um, so, like, just imagine what they've been able to accomplish without incentives, and then when they can finally turn that spigot on, how, how big this thing is going to get. So I'm, I'm very bullish on base. I think base is the place to look. If you're in the Ethereum community, look at the projects deploying there. There's pretty good signal there. And then Farcaster is also a great place to be instead of Twitter or in addition to Twitter. So a lot of alpha to be had there.
00:09:50.294 - 00:09:53.774, Speaker A: That is a, that is a pretty good show. Vicki, do you think it's forced?
00:09:53.854 - 00:09:54.918, Speaker B: Is this a financial.
00:09:55.006 - 00:09:56.154, Speaker A: Just a narrative?
00:09:58.294 - 00:10:01.974, Speaker C: I don't have any allocation, the base team or any projects on there.
00:10:02.014 - 00:10:02.190, Speaker A: So.
00:10:02.222 - 00:10:03.898, Speaker B: Don't you own Coinbase stonk?
00:10:04.086 - 00:10:25.514, Speaker C: I don't. I'm gonna say, yes, it is forced. I mean, they're gonna air. If they are gonna. I'm farming it, because, like, if they are gonna airdrop, it's gonna be, like, a massive airdrop. So you just have to be a part of that. But I don't know, I feel like without a wealth effect, it's hard to, like, build an ecosystem that, like, actually sustains.
00:10:25.514 - 00:10:37.834, Speaker C: Like, it quickly turns into PvP. And I tried shit coining on coins on base versus, like, coins on Solana, and they just sell so early, it's quite annoying.
00:10:38.534 - 00:10:49.726, Speaker A: They rug earlier. Like, they can't sustain the pump. Is it because there's not enough liquidity? Like, there's not enough speculative liquidity? Like, there's money on the chain, but there's not, like, Degen. They're all on Solana right now.
00:10:49.830 - 00:11:09.454, Speaker C: Yeah, and, like, you can make the argument that, like, Solana back in January was like this too. And, like, eventually it got that sort of Solana pump and wealth effect. People started three. Three more. So maybe that comes along with base, especially the token launches. But until that happens, like, it's an annoying place to try to actually, like, make money on or speculate on.
00:11:10.114 - 00:11:10.474, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:10.514 - 00:11:44.934, Speaker B: One thing I will say, though, I agree with you, it does feel forced. I'm not at all denying that. But one thing I will say is, like, if you want to be early, you do have to go to these chains where things are annoying, where, like, most things don't stick. And, like, I do think, you know, if you're doing all of your stuff on Solana, like, you're not going to be early to things on Solana, very likely, but it's much easier to be early to a chain like base where there's no token. Yet their narrative is not quite there. It feels forced. I mean, just think about how forced the Solana narrative felt, right? For the longest time, there was no activity on Solana, but the valuation was absolutely bonkers.
00:11:44.934 - 00:11:54.874, Speaker B: And so I think you want to be in places without a token. I think there's much more value to be, like, on chains without tokens, using projects that don't have tokens, et cetera.
00:11:55.334 - 00:12:22.656, Speaker A: Well, maybe. Maybe that might be right. That might be the mid curve view. I'm a little bit, like, starting to see that Solana is being undergoing just a massive sort of wealth effect flywheel because these airdrops that are happening are so insane. So we have maybe one of the biggest in history on Wednesday. I don't know how much you've been following the wormhole announcement that they've made now. So now it's official.
00:12:22.656 - 00:12:49.022, Speaker A: It will be this Wednesday. And guys, like, we are looking at, I think it's 11%, 12% airdrop, something like that. And the pre market on this thing is, like, 18 billion. So if you do the math, you know, it's kind of, like, comfortably over $2 billion airdrop. And it's an SPL token. Have you guys checked your wallets?
00:12:49.158 - 00:12:53.874, Speaker C: Yeah, I got a healthy airdrop from these guys. Thank you, warpal. Thank you, Kunov.
00:12:55.014 - 00:12:58.394, Speaker B: I have a small airdrop, so it feels very forced to me.
00:13:00.614 - 00:13:22.386, Speaker A: Can I ask something? Because I've been talking to a few people and asking them which wallets got which wallets didn't. It does feel like I have wallets that I have literally used. Wormhole. Go to sui. I've actually used it, and there's zero. And then there's, like, old Solana wallets that just, like, we're buying some nfts, and they have, like, a massive airdrop. So it feels quite Solana heavy.
00:13:22.386 - 00:13:29.138, Speaker A: Maybe, like, maybe this is why Justin is feeling it for us. Is it mostly Solana wallets or.
00:13:29.266 - 00:13:41.214, Speaker C: Yeah, it's pretty much all salon wallets for me, especially, like, those older wallets back in 21, 22 that, like, just had a few transactions on them that were just moving funds back and forth. I feel like. It feels like they rewarded those quite heavily.
00:13:43.174 - 00:13:49.874, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm expecting that this will be. I mean, this. This should be, like, a massive boost to that ecosystem, right, Justin?
00:13:50.334 - 00:14:05.334, Speaker B: Oh, for sure. So I. Yeah, I mean, I have just. I'm a great example. I have a few addresses that have a couple thousand or a few thousand tokens each. I'm not exactly positive those were all from when I was bridging using Warhammer onto Solana. That's where I got the airdrop from.
00:14:05.334 - 00:14:44.084, Speaker B: And, like, for me personally, I'm just gonna swap, depending on the price of wormhole, at some point, I will just end up swapping the wormhole token to the Solana token and just basically holding it. Usually when I get an airdrop, I just keep it in that ecosystem, but sort of like, just use the transfer, transfer it to the, or swap it to the gas token of that chain. So in this case, Solana, for me, that's been the best approach, and I totally agree. It's a huge wealth effect. Solana is the chain where people have gotten wealthy. That's where most of the gains of this bull market have gone by far, which is really interesting to see and definitely happy for that community. And to a degree, I definitely feel a ton of fomo.
00:14:44.084 - 00:15:07.456, Speaker B: A ton of fomo. You know, the three of us or four of us. When Tyche's here. We're all so involved in this space. And to be so involved during the bear market, just as involved as I was in the bull market. And then to have Miss Solana, like, there's a huge lesson there, right? I remember when the bank lists guys, I think one of them tweeted Solana when it was at $10. They were like, this is ETH's $80 moment.
00:15:07.456 - 00:15:20.404, Speaker B: Who knows if Solana is going to survive, but this is the time to bet on it. And I remember reading that tweet thinking they were right and doing nothing. And so that. That's a huge lesson for me in the future to sort of like, what I'm looking to change when we go into the next bear market.
00:15:21.544 - 00:15:22.496, Speaker A: Makes sense. Jordan.
00:15:22.520 - 00:15:23.964, Speaker C: I faded it so hard.
00:15:24.624 - 00:15:29.444, Speaker B: Yeah. Actually, Jordy, you're the reason I didn't buy Solana. I take it back. It's not me, it's you.
00:15:31.484 - 00:16:11.540, Speaker A: I'll just, like, reiterate for the audience, maybe, like, missed our episodes from, like, you know, several months ago. My issue with Solana is not the tech, and it's not the community, and it's not, you know, I love a lot of the things going on there, and I've actually, like, held a lot of Solana in the past. I agree with Solana people, actually, that there is no huge difference between, like, the Solana token and the ethereum token in some ways, in the sense that they're both community money. Like, this is the money of that community, then, you know, a lot of people just denominate part of their. Their wealth in that community, in. In Solana tokens, right? Like, the NFTs are in Solana. Like, you know, they kind of, like you said, Justin, they get the airdrop, and then they switch it into, like, that community token.
00:16:11.540 - 00:17:11.584, Speaker A: The issue I've always had with Solana, and I will always have with Solana, and I've taken this up with, you know, publicly with both, you know, Austin and, as well as, you know, directly with, damn, what's the Anatoly sorry flagged is that there are years and years and years of VC unlocks happening. And I think this, you know, if you look at the philosophy of community money, which is a new thing, no one's ever studied a course about it in university. But I don't think that there should be VC overhangs for years on community money. I think it should be kind of like how Ethereum is at this point, where it's unencumbered, everything's unlocked, it's even deflationary and that makes a better basis for community money. That said, the casino is so strong that they've just eaten up so far all the supply that's coming, and maybe they will continue to do so for years and years. And then they've kind of made a lot of VC's super rich. And this is actually maybe something we should talk about today.
00:17:11.584 - 00:17:55.364, Speaker A: The wealth effect on some of the people that are key positions, like, let's call it like a, you know, Khalsa money, you know, I can give more examples, is just so ginormous. I mean, it's so exponential when, you know, if you're a VC and community money and that takes off. These numbers are insane. Someone's asking like, is 18 billion fair for wormhole? I mean, we just had etherfi, you know, which is one of. I mean, it is the leading LRT token, but like Lido is it, uh, whatever, 3 billion. And, uh, Etherfi is at like seven, right? So, um, that's. That's what things are being valued at right now.
00:17:55.364 - 00:17:58.024, Speaker A: That's. This just. That just seems to be what's going on.
00:17:58.724 - 00:18:19.084, Speaker B: On that note, thikki is like, I know you. You and simitar have done a ton of posts on basically the inflows from just altcoin inflation every day. And, like, the numbers are staggering. Vicki, do you think we can continue to chip away at that? And actually, do you recall what the weekly inflows are just from inflation and unlocks?
00:18:20.104 - 00:18:45.016, Speaker C: Yeah, it's, you know, seven days a week. It's roughly 225 a day at these prices. So it's like million, 225 million a day. So it's roughly 1.5 billion a week. And I'm sure Jordy has thoughts on this, too, but I think it's impossible to decouple altcoins and bitcoin. They just move.
00:18:45.016 - 00:19:27.984, Speaker C: So correlated, and everyone has both for now. I think it decreases over time, but I do think the altcoin supply weighs down on the bitcoin supply. Everyone's focused on the post having number and looking at the ETF numbers versus how much bitcoin supply there is. But there's so much altcoin supply that sort of, in my mind, is sort of a little parasitic towards that. And it's hard for bitcoin to move up and altcoins move down. It seems like they always have to move together. So it makes me tough to be overly optimistic on bitcoin price when the altcoins are emitting so heavily that, like, so heavily, in fact, they're outweighing inflows like stable coins and ETF's and everything at its current pace.
00:19:29.944 - 00:19:40.924, Speaker A: I think eventually, like I've been saying, the, the holders of bitcoin will be very different than they are now. They won't be crypto native. And at that point, you know, we will have the correlation and assets will act very differently.
00:19:41.944 - 00:19:42.544, Speaker C: Totally.
00:19:42.624 - 00:20:08.698, Speaker A: Someone's saying, like, you know, we're sounding like coke guys. Like, I can assure you, you know, I personally don't mind missing every single coin. And we're at the part of the cycle where no matter, like, what you buy, you're buying, like, litecoin, you're like a bch maxi. You feel like a genius. Like, you just think you're so smart because your stupid coin that you bought is just like up 100% every day. But the reality is they're all up. Like, not all of them.
00:20:08.698 - 00:20:17.174, Speaker A: You know, maybe not XRP, but, like, everything else is just like, up infinite. And it reminds me a lot of 2021 right now.
00:20:17.874 - 00:20:43.714, Speaker B: It's so weird, like, in crypto where I feel like we're one of the few industries, and I mean, maybe it's because we have these tokens to speculate on, but we're always comparing our tokens to other tokens. But we all have stock portfolios and we're not like, oh, damn, I missed. I held Tesla down. As opposed to buying Nvidia, we're not comparing everything to Nvidia. Right. In our portfolio, Nvidia is up like ten x over the last couple of years. And we could all be saying, well, we're just holding the s and P 500 for coping.
00:20:43.714 - 00:21:00.642, Speaker B: We're doing terribly, but you don't really think that way. And for some reason in crypto, we're always comparing, like, just a reminder, if you held bitcoin and ETH, of course, you drastically underperformed Solana, but you still made a ton of money, life changing gains. And I think that is like, you know, something to be happy about.
00:21:00.698 - 00:21:51.142, Speaker A: So, I mean, my mental construct that has not failed me and, you know, I just sort of keep grinding up is you just look at risk reward. Like, if something's market cap has gotten really, really high and it doesn't have that much reward at that point, you look for, you know, much better opportunities and there's always really good opportunities because this space is so inefficient. I mean, we've talked in the past about launches. Like, even just looking at launches, like launch pools, stuff like that, we have very predictable things. And in bull markets, we're seeing it once again with Etherfi, where there was a launch pool sold off from $4 to like 280. And then you just wait a few days and the thing, like, rips to $8. There's ways where you can just have incredible risk reward.
00:21:51.142 - 00:21:53.954, Speaker A: I don't know if you played that specific one, thicky.
00:21:56.454 - 00:21:57.550, Speaker C: Sorry, which one?
00:21:57.702 - 00:21:58.846, Speaker A: The Etherfi.
00:21:59.030 - 00:22:20.184, Speaker C: Oh, I didn't. That was a huge miss. I rerated because, well, partially, like, launched when the market was all moving down, and when it started moving up again, it finally got a bit. And plus, like with Eigen lair, sort of surprisingly, announced their launch mainnet on April 15. I think it rerated a lot of this, like a restaking ecosystem. So that was a good catch to those who caught it.
00:22:21.164 - 00:22:56.478, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a ton of liquid restaking coins coming to the market soon. Obviously, there's kelp dow, there's so many others. It's going to be very interesting how they all compete, but ultimately, I think this is extremely bullish. And Etherfi is now taking huge market share from Lido, which is obviously just very positive for the Ethereum ecosystem. It seems like the LSD FUD that existed before, where basically staked ETH would control the network, or lido holders could control the network. A lot of that, I don't want to say, is evaporated because Steth is still at about 30% of all staking share. But it's going down, which is great.
00:22:56.478 - 00:23:00.394, Speaker B: When I would have thought they would have continued to go up and just eat the whole market away.
00:23:01.814 - 00:23:27.380, Speaker A: I mean, 2% yield, two and a half, whatever, three yield with nothing else. It's just so below the market. Imagine getting eigen points and then the, these, like, shitcoin LRT tokens that are just like, pumping insane. Like you said, it's going to reprice all of them. Like Rio, Renzo, puffer, kelp, swell. Like all of this stuff. Now, you know how crypto people think.
00:23:27.380 - 00:23:45.742, Speaker A: Even like, the smarter, smartest ones, they're always like, relative value. If it's like, well, this is at seven. This has half the TVL so let's like, you know, it's like doing a little three and a half, Billy. And, you know, I'm looking at the private rounds of these things, and I'm just like, yum, yum, yum, yum. Let me get some. 90 million kelp. Let me get some.
00:23:45.742 - 00:23:48.354, Speaker A: It's just so juicy. I mean, it looks incredible.
00:23:49.734 - 00:24:26.146, Speaker B: Yeah, it's very interesting, this. Actually, I'm surprised. I sort of, like, missed thinking that Steth would, like, lose market share, because this reminds me of when convex launched. So convex is like a curve wrapper, and it's effectively just like slapping another token on top of curve and using that to give out yield. And I was thinking earlier, like, forget restaking. Like, you could literally just make a Steth wrapper, throw a new governance token on it, increase, give out some rewards, and, like, you're always going to make Steth plus your shitcoin on top of that and getting additional yield. And so, like, of course, these things are going to continue to, like, adapt and grow and take away market share.
00:24:26.170 - 00:24:46.486, Speaker A: From Stephen, by the way, I love the fact, like, you know, the word shitcoin doesn't feel bad to use anymore. It's now endearing. It was something like bitcoiners came up with it. Like, bitcoiners just want to, like, you know, shit on all the other coins and call them shit coins. But now it's like I'm in chats and people are, like, calling their own coin. Their own coin.
00:24:46.670 - 00:24:47.230, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:24:47.262 - 00:24:48.862, Speaker A: You know, have you bought my shitter?
00:24:48.918 - 00:24:53.750, Speaker B: Like, I think Arthur Hayes popularized this because he's a huge son.
00:24:53.782 - 00:24:55.184, Speaker A: Right? Was in just.
00:24:57.084 - 00:25:05.944, Speaker B: Oh, really? I thought it was Arthur Hayes with Athena. He's like calling Athena shitcoin, even though he's a huge investor, came up with the idea and a huge background.
00:25:07.684 - 00:25:27.384, Speaker A: Well, we had guy on the show. So Athena is the other huge launch next week. There's probably the busiest week of the calendar. It's going to be the busiest week of our calendar. Athena Tuesday, wormhole Wednesday, and Zeus Thursday. So three huge ones.
00:25:27.684 - 00:25:28.744, Speaker B: What was Zeus?
00:25:29.324 - 00:25:51.988, Speaker A: So Zeus is going to be the first launch pad on Jupiter. Sweet. So that'll be quite interesting. I have to say the thing that I. So all of the tokens recently that have done well, and they're expected to do well. I talk to the founders quite a lot, very often, and they have one thing in common. They're all really fucking aggressive.
00:25:51.988 - 00:26:16.464, Speaker A: Like, they are so aggressive. And it just shows you that to win in this market, you do need to have a little bit of like this, you know, direct. I don't want to call it high tea, but, like, high t approach. Like Mike from Etherfy. This guy is just a fucking. He's a beast. I mean, he sees something, he sees an opportunity.
00:26:16.464 - 00:26:40.980, Speaker A: He'll get the TVL in. You know, get his. His Excellency, you know, sort out a deal, get this thing to, like, 3 billion of TVL. You got guy who's just, you know, we had him on the show, this guy just crushed it. He's, he's done deals with centralized exchanges that I didn't think were possible. You have Robinson from wormhole. Honestly, I have to say one of the best decisions of the year is probably naming his token.
00:26:40.980 - 00:27:00.598, Speaker A: Wow. Like, how aggressive like that. You know, that's not a corporate thing. There's no, like, boardroom. Everyone in, like, a normal situation will just, like, choose, like, worm or hole or whatever. I think this guy, I know what you think, Vicki. I feel like he added, like, at least $2 billion of market cap by calling it w.
00:27:00.598 - 00:27:01.950, Speaker A: Just w. He's like, I'm done.
00:27:01.982 - 00:27:10.894, Speaker C: W o is good. I feel like these guys don't like giving out. Sexes don't like giving out one letter tickers. So definitely like a high tea move, like you said.
00:27:11.554 - 00:27:37.584, Speaker B: Yeah. One other pattern I've noticed, Jordy, is these the founders with successful projects and successful tokens, rather. I mean, they treat their token as highly valuable even before it has a price, which is something I like. They analyze every bit they give out to employees, to investors. Like, they really treat this thing as a precious asset. And I think the thinking there is, like, if we don't treat this as valuable, no one else will. And that's another pattern I've noticed too.
00:27:37.584 - 00:27:42.564, Speaker B: Like, they're hyper aware of the supply and hyper aware of who's getting what and what is actually fair.
00:27:43.704 - 00:28:12.994, Speaker A: I just, I agree. And at the end of the day, like, there's so much like, win win situation. If you just do the right partnership, you get the right, you know, one plus one equals three situation. There's such a huge premium to attention, such a huge premium to, you know, being in the right distribution channel. And you have to have this, like, very aggressive approach to make it work in a bull market. I mean, in a bear market, you know, it's a different story.
00:28:14.734 - 00:28:21.834, Speaker B: Totally. I see some comments asking about the Ethereum ETF. I don't know if we want to talk about that first. Or we could also talk about munchables.
00:28:22.774 - 00:28:28.034, Speaker A: Let's. Let's get the Ethereum etF out the way. I know, I know. You've been watching my favorite topic, Justin.
00:28:29.014 - 00:28:39.142, Speaker B: He's my only hope right now. It's like, help me, Larry Fink. You're my only hope. He went on business. He went on Fox business. I know you missed it, Jordy. I think you saw it.
00:28:39.142 - 00:28:40.834, Speaker B: Thicke, if I'm right there.
00:28:41.374 - 00:28:42.878, Speaker C: Yeah, I saw some clips.
00:28:43.046 - 00:29:14.294, Speaker B: Okay, so they asked him about the Ethereum ETF. He put on the biggest smirk slash smile you've ever seen. A smile so big, even think. He had to recognize it, which was very exciting and bullish. But the real interesting thing was they said, the Fox business host said, you know, larry, we see that the SEC, there's murmurs, they're going after ethereum, trying to classify it as a security. Would that impact your ability to have an ETF for Ethereum? And he basically said, no, not at all. He doesn't see it as being a problem, which is very interesting.
00:29:14.294 - 00:29:42.326, Speaker B: I still think the base case has to be that the ETF doesn't get approved with that news that came out. But it does help reframe some of my thinking, where we all thought that if Ethereum is a security, you can't have an ETF. But actually why? Right. Larry Fink doesn't think it's a problem. Presumably he has some information there and intuitively it makes sense. Like, why would it matter if Ethereum is a security? Regarding listing the ETF, maybe the goal here is actually to classify it as a security and then let the ETF happen. After that.
00:29:42.326 - 00:29:54.824, Speaker B: Of course, we don't know. We'll see. My base case is still probably at this point that it doesn't happen. Maybe I'm just coping. I don't know. But what do you guys think? I thought overall it was extremely bullish the way he spoke about ethereum publicly. So.
00:29:56.524 - 00:30:17.388, Speaker A: I think I agree with the market. There is zero new information from anything he said. It's just the same. The reality is we know eventually it's going to get approved. Right. It's not going to happen now, and it'll happen eventually. And the timing to like, really play the ETH BTC ratio will be like, when it's within sight, then it'll kind of like run.
00:30:17.388 - 00:30:34.900, Speaker A: But may is not going to happen. We do see that the CFTC is kind of passively aggressively, you know, in their law, in their cases, they're just like putting ethereum as a commodity. So I think that it will prevail as a commodity. But, you know.
00:30:35.012 - 00:30:46.824, Speaker B: But Jordy, did you be honest, though? You did sort of conflate the security question with the ETF question. I think we all did. Like, we all sort of thought that news to me. No, you didn't. Okay.
00:30:47.244 - 00:31:01.274, Speaker A: No, I think, you know, one way or another, they're going to find some excuse to delay it, and that's just like buying time. And at some point it's inevitable. But the security thing for me is just like a red herring.
00:31:01.894 - 00:31:02.834, Speaker B: Got it.
00:31:03.894 - 00:31:11.194, Speaker C: I think if they do designated security, it might add a year or two to the timeline. But, yeah.
00:31:14.094 - 00:31:16.932, Speaker A: It seems so hard to be able to actually get that.
00:31:17.078 - 00:31:22.204, Speaker C: Yeah, it does. I don't think that for sure. It'll just take forever in court.
00:31:23.784 - 00:31:29.168, Speaker A: But somebody, somebody in the chat saying that you were on banter. Were you on banter today, Vicki?
00:31:29.336 - 00:31:30.564, Speaker C: I was on yesterday.
00:31:31.144 - 00:31:37.444, Speaker A: Oh, wow. Okay. All right, so any exciting. Exciting. Alpha.
00:31:40.104 - 00:31:45.734, Speaker C: Brand'S actually, like a good podcast host despite, like, his, like, reputation.
00:31:46.114 - 00:31:58.226, Speaker A: He's been offering. He's been offering me to. Come on, steady, lads. I don't know if in the chat we can. We can see some thumbs up or thumbs down. Do you guys. You guys want to see Rand Noyer as a steady last?
00:31:58.370 - 00:32:05.082, Speaker C: If he's going to, like, come on. Retweeted to his, like, he's got a good distribution. So I think if he, like, helps.
00:32:05.098 - 00:32:10.694, Speaker B: Us out him right now, can he. Can he just pop in with the invite link live last minute?
00:32:11.204 - 00:32:17.424, Speaker C: I will use. He was actually a good. He was actually a very good speaker. It was a good time.
00:32:18.044 - 00:32:32.224, Speaker B: You know, people, people, like, make fun of these influencers that get almost too big, right? Like, eventually steady lives is going to get there where we're just going to become too big and people make fun of us. But, like, you don't get to that size without some talent, right? Like that. That's what people miss.
00:32:34.644 - 00:32:44.210, Speaker A: We're seeing. We're seeing some mixed. Seeing a lot of nos to use here. I think, like, you know, look, we've had. We've had. We've had controversial figures in the past. I don't.
00:32:44.210 - 00:32:59.746, Speaker A: I don't need to list, you know, the people that we've had. I think, fuck it, right? Like, we'll. We'll. We'll see how it goes. We like to experiment. Fuck the chat. Oh, God, we're going to have a rebellion here.
00:32:59.746 - 00:33:04.414, Speaker A: All right, I'm going to have to start giving puff airdrops for everybody to. To keep the rebellion at bay.
00:33:04.924 - 00:33:10.384, Speaker B: Is there Puff Alpha you can leak to keep the rebellion at bay? I mean, I'm all ears for it, too, Jordy.
00:33:11.164 - 00:33:31.374, Speaker A: So the chat probably knows Puff. We've been sharing some of the memes and the clips of puff, and puff is nearing chapter two, so you can. I know you've been, you've been playing with this justin. You've gone into the meth lab and. All right, guys, it's time for my 62nd chill time. It's a little puffy. You want to show the.
00:33:31.374 - 00:33:32.758, Speaker A: Your screen, Justin?
00:33:32.926 - 00:33:37.422, Speaker B: I do let me. I got to make sure I've got the right address or the wrong address connected.
00:33:37.478 - 00:33:37.670, Speaker A: Let's.
00:33:37.702 - 00:33:51.314, Speaker C: Yeah. Jordy. Jordy. We first puff. There was a 420.69 meth market buy last week on puff that went unnoticed. I'm curious if you knew who was behind that.
00:33:51.734 - 00:33:53.366, Speaker B: That was this guy over here.
00:33:53.550 - 00:34:06.800, Speaker A: I checked on chain. It looks like it was a by bit by bit address. So I don't know if there's some by bit kind of ancient whales dipping in, but, uh, interesting. Uh, Jordy, this is so high tea, though.
00:34:06.832 - 00:34:10.544, Speaker B: Like, no one has made a video game crypto app, like defi app.
00:34:10.584 - 00:34:33.603, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, it's. It's a high t baby dragon, but, yeah. So at this point, people can start basically, like, uh, either choosing puff or meth. You know, both of those are God tokens. They're both godly tokens. And the puff will make you a potion, and the meth will get you a vial, and that will kind of be your entry into chapter two. So you're not, you're.
00:34:33.603 - 00:34:54.884, Speaker A: This guy in the chat is like, what the fuck is this? Yeah, you know, if you know, you know, and I think there's, there's a very huge puff chat community here, but I'm excited for chapter two. It's, it's coming soon, and I know you guys are creating your potion, so.
00:34:55.544 - 00:34:57.296, Speaker B: Can I ask you a question, Jordy?
00:34:57.480 - 00:34:58.272, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:58.448 - 00:35:14.804, Speaker B: So you have six chapters going. Like, do you have something planned for the next. I know what chapter two, I'm sure, is planned, but you can't possibly plan something that's like eight to twelve weeks out, right? Or do you guys have, like, a perfectly detailed roadmap of what's going to happen?
00:35:16.244 - 00:35:48.024, Speaker A: The way this stuff works is like, you always need to have at least, like, the horizon within you. So, you know, chapter three is, is pretty good. And then, you know, four or five, you have to figure out. But the important thing is that six is, is done. And that's the most important thing because it's all about how you close out and the difference between something like, you know, somebody called Defi kingdoms, whatever. In the chat, the complete opposite of Defi Kingdom is because Defi kingdoms, you know, you just. And ending up in this, like, cycle of, like, death loop.
00:35:48.024 - 00:36:17.444, Speaker A: And with puff, you know, the design is actually something that builds up and sort of like, ends in a, in a nice way, sort of like an airdrop type type of way where, you know, you sort of break the, break the pinata. So that, that's, that's hopefully novel. I saw Vitalik. If anybody has read his post, he's, uh, he's written a post about meme coins. Uh, have you, have you, have you checked this out yet, Justin?
00:36:18.064 - 00:36:41.992, Speaker B: I haven't yet. Um, I'm sure it's something about, like, using meme coins for good or something silly like that, but what I wanted to ask you, um, Jordy was like, I've. I've heard some murmurings, and we can get back to the Vitalik, I would love to hear more, but I've heard murmurings like, you're mister game theorizing. There's six chapters. Fourth chapter is a good time to dump you. Dump. You know, like, people are going to be waiting to dump till the end, so you got to front run that.
00:36:41.992 - 00:36:46.804, Speaker B: But, like, let's be honest. You've thought of that, right? You've. You've thought it all out.
00:36:47.504 - 00:37:12.404, Speaker A: I mean, like I said, like, why would you dump in chapter four if the pinatas in chapter six? Like, it's sort of, it sort of defeats the purpose. I mean, you can, if you want, anybody at any point, you know, is free to choose their path and choose their journey. There's people that, you know, I'm looking on chain. This guy's, like, messaging me. He's like, asking for tech support. I checked his wallet. He dumped it like, five minutes after, like, just after launch.
00:37:12.404 - 00:37:19.980, Speaker A: He made like, a 10% profit and just, like, dumped it. He's like, I'm done. Like, okay, cool, good job. And now you're asking for tech support.
00:37:20.052 - 00:37:25.824, Speaker B: Like, yeah, it's always like, the smallest holders or the worst holders that are always begging you for support.
00:37:26.764 - 00:37:59.156, Speaker A: Yeah. But basically, bottom line, you know, the thing that I'm bullish on is taking these, like, dry defi things where you, you know, you just have something that you click in a number and you make a story out of it. You make a campaign, you make something, like, very interactive and kind of engaging, and you can kind of build a community around. Let's talk a little about munchables. Because Munchables has been in the news. This is the, the biggest story of the week, perhaps. Definitely the pasta of the week, which we'll, which we'll get to at the end of the.
00:37:59.156 - 00:38:49.662, Speaker A: But, you know, we are video. Celini is an investor in Munchables. And unfortunately, I think, was it Wednesday? Two days ago? I'm just starting to get notifications on my Twitter, you know, trying to call me out for investing in Munchable. So I check what's going on, and they announced that they had an incident. It seemed like, you know, there was a potential unauthorized access, basically, to funds. There was, like, funds moving around and that sort of set the alarm bells off for a lot of people because the reality is they had found product market fit. So for people who don't know, munchables was this, like, very cool interactive nft kind of collection on base.
00:38:49.662 - 00:39:34.804, Speaker A: And of course, everyone is, you know, sorry, it's on base, on blast. Everyone's farming, blast gold and munchables are these, like, super cute characters that you have to feed them schnibbles. Unfortunately, even though this thing was growing exponentially, the TBL had gone up to, I think, 96 million, which is, like, super impressive. This thing had just launched, like, a week before they announced that there had been a north korean dev that was sort of, like, on the inside and had, I guess, threatened to rug and try to take the money. Did you guys kind of catch the headlines on this?
00:39:37.824 - 00:40:10.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I've followed along a bit. I didn't have any exposure, so I didn't follow it too closely. But from my perspective, it was sort of like a guarantee there would have to be some intervention, and I'd love to learn more if you guys have any information on what actually went down. But even if you believe code is law, the code was written in such a way that the blast team could do whatever they want to get the funds back. So I don't think the code of law code is law argument has any legs to stand on here. And, like, if I had lost millions of dollars in that, you know, you can file a court injunction in the US. This is a us based team.
00:40:10.674 - 00:40:27.604, Speaker B: You could get them to take action. Like, there is a two week window, I think, for blast to intervene before the transaction finalizes on Mainnet, from my understanding. And so I think there was no question they get the funds back. It was just a question of how they would do it. I don't know. Do you have any, any info on that, Jordy?
00:40:28.744 - 00:40:41.164, Speaker A: Yeah, a lot. A lot to say. But before we get into it, have you. I mean, you're a CEO, right? So you interviewed Devs. Have you, have you ever encountered a suspiciously.
00:40:42.164 - 00:40:43.784, Speaker B: Yes. Yeah.
00:40:44.164 - 00:40:47.024, Speaker A: Have you interviewed any devs that, you know, might be.
00:40:47.404 - 00:41:20.546, Speaker B: It's super common. I mean, so at Astaria, we don't hire anon, so it's much less of a problem. Right. Like, we want people on the team that are like, docs that we can do video calls with, that we can meet, that we can go to conferences with. But like, in the early days when we were hiring engineers, we had a couple of suspicious actors that could be from North Korea or other places. And in fact, my co founder, Joe, when he was at sushi, accidentally did hire a north korean engineer. There's a whole funny story there that I won't get into, but it's super common, I think, to be safe, if you don't hire anons, you're good.
00:41:20.546 - 00:41:30.054, Speaker B: But obviously in our space, there's like a, you know, people really respect the anon life and are happy to hire anons, but it's very common and it's only going to become more common, I think, as time goes on.
00:41:30.834 - 00:41:40.800, Speaker A: Are these North Koreans, do you think they're always just trying to rug or are they just trying to get a paycheck? Because, like, you know, for them, even just getting a job as a dev might be a lot of money. Yeah.
00:41:40.872 - 00:42:08.854, Speaker B: So there's also, we've also interviewed devs that are like, just from other asian countries that have no engineering experience, and we'll actually ask them a question. And, you know, we've seen them on the interview, like sort of stall and then like, try to type the question in online or in chat GPT and come up with an answer. It's very obvious. But yeah, like, I'm sure you've dealt with this too at some of the projects you've worked on. Like even just getting a two week paycheck or whatever for not working is a great outcome. Right. And if they can do that many, many times over, they're in good shape.
00:42:09.634 - 00:42:49.160, Speaker A: I mean, for us, you know, Cellini is kind of, you know, we're a very quantitative firm and everybody that we hire is like, you know, from tower jump, like Citadel, these kind of backgrounds. It hasn't happened. There was one time, though, it did happen. I got a cv last cycle, so this was after 3 hours, blew up, 2022. There was an interesting cv. It actually was not north korean, it was egyptian, some like Omar guy or something. And he had claimed on his cv, and I spelled on LinkedIn, if you could find him on LinkedIn, and he had three arrows capital on his LinkedIn and he claimed to be the Defi guy.
00:42:49.160 - 00:43:22.978, Speaker A: And he said he did all the, he was evaluating all the DeFi projects. He was a great DeFi analyst. So I got curious because I was like, okay, let's see what's actually going on. We were looking for a Defi analyst at the time, and it became increasingly clear that he had some knowledge of the space. He had some understanding of defi, and he could talk to on a superficial level. He even knew to refer to Kyle and Sue and things like that. You could ask him, who were you reporting to? And he would answer.
00:43:22.978 - 00:43:45.310, Speaker A: But as I dug in, it became very apparent to me that this guy is just actually scamming. He's making this shit up. And I confirmed, I kind of messaged some of the traders at three AC that had left, and they confirmed that they never heard of this guy. So it does seem to be pretty common. And they will fake their, yeah, it's interesting.
00:43:45.342 - 00:44:10.130, Speaker B: Like, our world, not crypto necessarily, but our world is built on so much trust. Like, there's really nothing to. You could just make a LinkedIn. Say you went to Harvard, say you worked at Goldman, say you worked at jump. And, like, 90% of the time, or a good portion of the time, new companies that are interviewing you might look into that, but there's so many that won't. Like it reminds me of Elizabeth Warren saying she's, like, Native American. Like, so much of our society is built on trust with things we can't verify.
00:44:10.130 - 00:44:22.500, Speaker B: And I think in crypto, because there's so much room for scammers, we have to be even more careful. And, like, to that end, we just haven't hired anons like, wouldn't. But, yeah, it's very interesting.
00:44:22.572 - 00:44:40.548, Speaker A: I mean, let's get to the other point. So, I mean, this is the most interesting part out of, you know, the whole topic. Well, maybe the second most interesting, which is, like, blast was faced with, like, just a very difficult decision. And can you bring up the Cindy. Cindy low kind of. She has the trolley problem. And this was the.
00:44:40.548 - 00:45:32.244, Speaker A: The perfect representation of, you know, this, like, philosophical dilemma. And, you know, people in the chat probably know, trolley problems. You have, like, one bad outcome, and you can possibly make a moral decision to prevent that bad outcome. But then, you know, there's. There's another victim who the other victim would not normally, you know, get hurt, but you have to make a choice. And either way, you know, you do have a moral dilemma. So for blast, it's either, you know, just let the 62 million get drained, and we can talk a little bit about what the options of that hacker were, or they kind of make it clear and evident to the world that the concept of decentralization on the chain is actually not there.
00:45:32.244 - 00:46:21.314, Speaker A: And it is a centralized chain, and they do have the ability to just roll back the chain and that we're all just playing on their casino. I've seen a lot of good takes on the situation. Can you bring up the next tweet? So we had Justin James Hudson Jameson write quite a good thread about this. And he described as this was ongoing, that there was a way to roll back the chain and prevent the blocks from existing. This is similar to what we saw, you know, with ethereum at the very early days with, with the DaO. And we did, I don't know if it was real, but we saw, like some people say that Pac man was like, asking on forums about how to do this thing, this irregular state transition.
00:46:21.474 - 00:46:25.414, Speaker B: I think that was a joke. I think that was a meme. Yeah, yeah.
00:46:25.714 - 00:46:26.614, Speaker C: Okay.
00:46:27.314 - 00:46:58.944, Speaker A: I wasn't sure, but, you know, like, there was this option. Right. And I'm quite cynical. I've been in the space a long time, and at this point I realize that most things just get based on dollars and dollar, dollar impact. And I think $62 million is a lot of money and people would have lost a lot of money potentially. But blast. I don't know what the pre market is or the expectation, but last I saw, it was like, I don't know, four or $5 billion or something.
00:46:58.944 - 00:47:24.234, Speaker A: If you do something that will potentially reduce your, your credibility and take away a billion dollars from your predicted market cap, you talk about morals and you talk about decentralization and all this bullshit. I'm just thinking that this was a financially kind of calculus. I don't know what you guys think.
00:47:25.134 - 00:47:49.856, Speaker B: I kind of just disagree with the premise that one blast has a perception of do decentralization. I don't think they do. And I don't think it's a problem that they're not there yet. Like, we sort of know what stage that their layer two specifically is at. I just don't see anything wrong with them taking action to recover that money. I don't think anyone has ever been under the impression that blast to date has been decentralized. And to be clear, I don't think that's a bad thing.
00:47:49.856 - 00:48:19.928, Speaker B: Like, we use decentralization, or lack of it, as like a dirty thing in this space, but that's just where the chain is at. That is like, the facts. They, the power to do it already exists, whether they take action or not. And it's already known that they could. So it seems like a no brainer to recover the funds. And I also think there's like, a lot of legal precedent that you, if you have the ability to, like, stop this and recover the funds, you, you have, like, not only just an ethical and moral obligation, but I think there could be some legal ramifications as well. Um, which is why it's so important to be clear that they.
00:48:20.056 - 00:48:20.804, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:21.144 - 00:48:39.904, Speaker B: Which is why it's so clear, in my opinion, that they have to eventually progress to being decentralized, however long or however much work that might take. Like, that is the North Star. That's the end goal, and that's great, and I hope they get there, but it's known by everyone that they're not. Not there yet, so I see no reason to not recover the funds, which it sounds like they did.
00:48:41.164 - 00:48:48.580, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, on an l two, you're. You're obviously using ethereum security in some way, but in other ways, you have a ship, you have a sequencer.
00:48:48.612 - 00:48:48.756, Speaker C: Right?
00:48:48.780 - 00:49:23.124, Speaker A: It's centralized sequencer for. For the most part at this point. You can censor transactions, you can censor OFAC addresses and all this stuff. So there is something to do, and probably with North Korea, it does come into play. National security. Do you just let North Korea take money from a blockchain? So I think it was going to be an impossible decision, and I don't know what would have happened. Thankfully, nobody had to actually, like, pull the lever of the trolley either way.
00:49:23.124 - 00:49:59.404, Speaker A: And I have no idea what would have happened. I don't know what. What they would have done, but thankfully, there was a bit of a happy ending. And we had a super crew, kind of like an all star crew there. Pac man was joined by people such as SAC, XBT and Samsung, who are, you know, the two most, let's call them, notorious security researchers in the space, and they announced that the. They got the private keys back. And, you know, there hasn't been exactly an explanation of how that happened.
00:49:59.404 - 00:50:12.224, Speaker A: The only thing we saw publicly was, you know, some of Zach's threatening posts. Maybe I'll leave it for pasta of the week, because I think. I think that post is.
00:50:13.004 - 00:50:53.902, Speaker B: I have a hypothetical to pose to you two, though, so. And I'll answer for myself to you. If I had, let's say, like, a lot of money, a large portion of my net worth in this project, let's just say. Or let's just make it simple. I have a million dollars in this project, assuming I lost that money, like, would you not attempt to file an emergency court injunction? Maybe you spend three to $10,000 on legal fees just to get this filed in court. I think it's pretty obvious that, and there's precedent there that a judge is obviously going to approve that and basically compel blast to recover the funds, because they can, and it's stolen money, and it's going to North Korea. Like, would you not expect that some people that lost money would do that? I mean, it seems like a no brainer to me.
00:50:53.902 - 00:51:00.314, Speaker B: Like, it seems like the decision would have quickly not been theirs to make. You know, after a couple days of just letting this go.
00:51:02.534 - 00:51:28.864, Speaker A: It'S really hard to say. You know, people always will. And every case is case by case specific. Like, there's details, like, who's in the US, who's not in the US, like, what comes into play at the end of the day, you know, thankfully, in this time, there. There was a good recovery. I'm sure that munchables has fired the dev, and apparently it's four devs that were the same guy because, like, he was sending one of the same addresses. So it's like, the picture of, like, the.
00:51:28.864 - 00:52:00.556, Speaker A: The different devs, and they're all. They're all the same guy. So I think he has sort of surrendered under the weight of Zack's rape threat, which we'll get to. And, you know, we're kind of left with a great, you know, quote, a disturbing people picture the next day with Kim Jong un and Puff Daddy. And I think munchables will. Will be back. I think, you know, we're.
00:52:00.556 - 00:52:33.854, Speaker A: We're kind of helping them regroup and get some proper devs. And obviously, the concept had huge market fit, so expect them to improve security, and we'll have munchables part two. Maybe we're asking a little bit about Phantom. Have you been trading Phantom? Think you'd seem like a great catalyst. Uh, we have Andre. Really, really trying to be. Try to be main character there.
00:52:35.954 - 00:52:51.414, Speaker C: I've been kind of trying to avoid it. Um, feels forced to me. Uh, defi squared put out a post saying, I, like all the fantasies. Got wrecked with multi chain, and it's like that's you typically come back from, but I don't know. We'll see.
00:52:53.054 - 00:53:02.674, Speaker A: Take you. What are you trading? There's no whiff and there's no phantom. Like, what's. What's on your mind? Are you just majors or what, shorty? Okay.
00:53:03.534 - 00:53:06.070, Speaker B: Anything in particular you can. You can.
00:53:06.142 - 00:53:15.870, Speaker A: Anything you want to talk about or. I'm too scared they're going to short squeeze him. They got the chat. Going to short squeeze thicky.
00:53:16.022 - 00:53:29.370, Speaker C: Yeah. I really like just longing the new coins and shorting the old ones, especially with, like, a huge amount of new coin inflation. Those next week, I'll be watching those quite closely. Both wormhole, Athena, and Zeus is an.
00:53:29.402 - 00:53:38.894, Speaker B: Old coin in your mind something like Celestia, which is not old, but, like, old in our narrative cycle, or is an old coin in your mind something like doge?
00:53:39.754 - 00:53:53.034, Speaker C: Definitely more like things that are, like, emitting and still vesting, but, like, yeah, out of the cycle and that have been pumped up to, like, a really high level. Previous cycles, I think are, like, the best targets.
00:53:54.774 - 00:54:22.322, Speaker A: Has the market finally woken up that Celestia was maybe a little bit overcooked? Because since we talked about it a couple of months ago and you guys were seeing me and Taiki go back and forth because he's a celestia bull on the panel, the market's rallied a lot, and Celestia is down. Just down. Only has there been supply unlocks? Or is it just like, I guess there's the inflation, right? Just from the staking inflation?
00:54:22.418 - 00:54:25.614, Speaker C: Jody did publicly sell the top.
00:54:26.354 - 00:54:28.734, Speaker A: I did sell the top, right? It was exactly like.
00:54:31.514 - 00:54:39.174, Speaker B: You sold the top and Tyke bought or sold the bottom of Kanto. So I feel like between all of us, we could put together some really good terrains.
00:54:40.934 - 00:54:59.950, Speaker A: Oh, man. Okay. At least Taiki's not here to see the situation. But let's. Let's maybe move to pasta of the week, because we're. We're kind of running on an hour, and we do have some good pastas. Justin, do you want to kick off pasta of the week?
00:55:00.102 - 00:55:21.012, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll kick it off. Mine's. Mine's a good one. I'm happy with this one. So we don't have to read this whole post, but this. This guy sent demands to Pac man of blur of what he should do to basically recover the Yuga community and increase the price of apes. So he wrote this demand letter of shut down.
00:55:21.012 - 00:55:44.056, Speaker B: All NFT collections that should be. Blur should be shut down, and all NFT collections affected should be refunded. A written apology to the Yuga labs community, which might be the funniest one. Sell all Remelia assets. Um, as of today, March 28. So this was yesterday. Pac man has refused to even acknowledge the letter, which was signed by a ton of notable apes, allegedly.
00:55:44.056 - 00:56:10.958, Speaker B: And so as a result, this guy has capitulated on his ape that it looks like he held down from 85 ETH to twelve e twelve ETH. And some of the comments were just absolutely hilarious. Like, I'm trying to find my favorite one, but it's like, dude, this is literally a jpeg of an ape. Like, how do you feel this much connection to it? It's literally just a picture, which I thought was just absolutely hilarious. Um, you know, there's all the right click. Save memes. Um, I'm going to try to find the.
00:56:10.958 - 00:56:20.502, Speaker B: The one that, uh, really got me laughing, but. Yeah. What do you. What do you guys think of this? Like, are you. I know, thickie. We talked earlier on the show, like, maybe now's the time to buy apes. What.
00:56:20.502 - 00:56:21.514, Speaker B: What are you thinking?
00:56:22.374 - 00:56:37.264, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought it was hilarious at first, and, like, you know, given how cringe a lot of these ape holders are, I just thought it was so on brand. The more I think about it, the more I wonder if this was, like, some engineered, uh, attention posts. It was very well engineered.
00:56:38.124 - 00:56:41.624, Speaker B: It was. Yeah. This popcorn, it's funny.
00:56:42.284 - 00:56:50.636, Speaker A: I feel like it has to be. Yeah, troll. Like, the. The chat thinks it's a troll. Obviously, a lot of people have, uh. Yeah, I didn't hear you guys say.
00:56:50.660 - 00:56:55.052, Speaker B: That when I was sharing my pasta before the show. Now I look like a fool. I guess I fell for the satire.
00:56:55.188 - 00:57:01.410, Speaker A: Um, you know, I mean, it's great. Like, it's pasta. The week is supposed to be like, it's supposed. Like, this is a pasta. I have seen.
00:57:01.442 - 00:57:03.674, Speaker B: I actually thought this was real, by the way, because I've seen.
00:57:03.714 - 00:57:04.034, Speaker A: We have.
00:57:04.074 - 00:57:06.014, Speaker B: I've seen so many posts like this.
00:57:07.034 - 00:57:14.410, Speaker C: Like, I wouldn't put anything past NFT holders at this point, but, like, yeah, the more I think about it, it's just too. It's just too perfect.
00:57:14.602 - 00:57:23.214, Speaker B: Yeah. Kicking someone who lost essentially everything is real class, bro. I'm just reading some of the comments. They still got me.
00:57:25.754 - 00:57:26.654, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:57:28.534 - 00:57:30.314, Speaker C: I do. I sent it in the telegram.
00:57:30.854 - 00:57:32.594, Speaker B: Let me pull that up here.
00:57:33.534 - 00:57:41.390, Speaker A: Let's get Picky's pasta. Whoa. Sydney. Oh, my God. Okay, what do we have here?
00:57:41.502 - 00:57:54.924, Speaker C: I think it embodies the philosophy that crypto broke quite well. It's a. You know, everyone else's bags are always terrible. In mine, they're just pristine. Whoever I'm in is the superior assets.
00:57:55.304 - 00:58:09.764, Speaker B: Dude, this should be really, like, ETH for Solana. Like, Solana is, like, the sexy, new, hot, fast, like, chain that's, like, conservative and profit oriented. And then Ethereum is just, like, this ugly relic that can't catch a narrative that's just forced.
00:58:11.784 - 00:58:34.354, Speaker A: I mean, I like this one because I think bag bias is under talked about for how much it actually affects, you know, the space. It leads to these, like, really, like, overcooked prices where everyone is just, like, looking at the Sydney Sweeney superior assets situation, and they don't kind of, like, rebalance it. A little bit with. With reality.
00:58:37.574 - 00:58:38.350, Speaker C: Let's.
00:58:38.502 - 00:59:15.348, Speaker A: Let's see if this wins. Although we've had to pull from the dead a deleted post by. By Zack xpt, which. Let's just preface this by saying that this was so epic that everyone thought that Zack was hacked. This was so, like, out of character that the only assumption that people had was that surely his Twitter. His Twitter has been hacked and someone is, like, shitposting, because this does not look like the, you know, very friendly neighborhood detective. Let's.
00:59:15.348 - 00:59:54.894, Speaker A: Do we have this? Here we go. Okay, so the context is that the dev that we mentioned, which Zach kind of figured out was a north korean dev, he says, buddy, I will rape you and your entire nation so hard, you will have more blackouts. And I think he actually deleted this, and then he reposted an even more aggressive version. I don't know if you have that one, but there was some. There was, like, first he deleted it, and then he, like, reposted it. He was really pissed off. And I have talked to Zach on several occasions, and the guy, like, takes it personally.
00:59:54.894 - 01:00:23.784, Speaker A: He despises scammers so much like it, it makes his blood boil. And, you know, people thought that he was hacked, but the reality is he feels this way. Like, he really, like, hates them so much that he's willing to put the entire of North Korea. I remember now. I think the new post was, he said, I will rape you on chain, is what. Is what the new post said.
01:00:24.924 - 01:00:42.544, Speaker B: I remember when Zach was doxxed, that was, like, a sad day for the industry, because this guy really goes out on a limb to find scammers and bring them to justice. And by doxxing him, he loses, like, a little bit of that safety. But Zach's an absolute hero in the space. I know he's had some controversial moments, but I think he's. He's not good.
01:00:44.164 - 01:01:07.144, Speaker A: Oh, 100%. I mean, he's a. He's a freaking legend. Yeah. White hat for the win. And, yes, sir. You know, I love that we're in this world where, like, in a pre Internet world, and definitely, like, in a pre blockchain world, someone like Zach, you know, he's like, this, like, shy, you know, kid, like, nerdy kid.
01:01:07.144 - 01:01:45.390, Speaker A: He would just get bullied around by these kind of, like, bigger types. But he's such a legend with how he manages to get stuff done on chain and kind of bring that. He's the actual real world asset. The real world asset is Zach. He gets people in jail. He gets actual fun things done, and we're in the world now where somebody like him can, can threaten some, like, hacker and scare him so bad that the guy just like, surrenders the keys, bag and he's like, just take the 60 million. Just as long as, you know, we're good, right? We're good, right? You're not.
01:01:45.390 - 01:01:56.126, Speaker A: We're okay. Just take it. So that was epic. And kudos. Kudos to him. I think that might be the possibility of the year, but we have to find a real one.
01:01:56.190 - 01:02:06.304, Speaker B: I think I feel like Thickie might be ahead, honestly. Thiccy's possibly got so much engagement from the comment section. Everyone loves Sidney sweeney. She's, she's the narrative of the week.
01:02:08.444 - 01:02:14.964, Speaker A: I need to get backed up, guys. Come on. Chat. The chat has to decide. But I. Let's see, let's see. Is it.
01:02:15.004 - 01:02:41.134, Speaker B: While we're waiting for that to come in, we did get a submission from the, from the audience. Pasta of the week. Judge staked SPF for 25 years for a future lock drop. I thought this was hilarious because, you know, I saw this judgment came out. 25 years. I was like, fuck, that's a lot of time. Then I was thinking, like, could you imagine where the crypto industry could be in 25 years? Like, it's, it's literally almost imaginable what this industry may or may not become in 25 years.
01:02:44.554 - 01:02:53.138, Speaker A: That was, uh, that was fantastic. Um, let's see, we're seeing boobs. So that's stickies. Seeing, uh, a little bit of say.
01:02:53.186 - 01:02:55.174, Speaker B: Uh, I like Justin's, to be honest.
01:02:56.514 - 01:02:58.370, Speaker A: That's like one guy. Is that one?
01:02:58.402 - 01:02:58.546, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:58.570 - 01:03:00.894, Speaker A: Is that your alt? Is that your alt again?
01:03:02.154 - 01:03:07.226, Speaker B: Again with the alt accusation. Now I see a lot of jordy. Zack is a legend.
01:03:07.330 - 01:03:12.894, Speaker C: Free Ross versus guy is always fucking fanboying. Jordy, dude.
01:03:13.874 - 01:03:17.574, Speaker A: Imagine you save 62 million but still lose to Sidney Sweeney.
01:03:18.674 - 01:03:20.494, Speaker B: That might be the past of the week.
01:03:24.664 - 01:03:35.564, Speaker A: Oh, it's close. It's close. All right, we'll have to Zack with boobs. Okay. Zach with boobs wins. If you have the boobs, then you get the best of both worlds.
01:03:36.864 - 01:03:37.768, Speaker B: Oh, man.
01:03:37.896 - 01:03:41.684, Speaker A: All right, guys, any last, last thoughts or topics to touch upon?
01:03:42.664 - 01:03:46.284, Speaker B: Everyone, give Taiki a congratulations. That's the man of the week.
01:03:47.124 - 01:04:07.012, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. We're looking forward to getting take you back and please like and subscribe. Thanks for the, thanks for the reminder to Brad, our editor. Please subscribe. Guys. It's great to see so many people in the chat and the community growing and. Let's go, let's go.
01:04:07.012 - 01:04:15.924, Speaker A: It's gonna be a big week, next week with all the things happening and hopefully we survive it to do another episode next week. Take care, everybody.
