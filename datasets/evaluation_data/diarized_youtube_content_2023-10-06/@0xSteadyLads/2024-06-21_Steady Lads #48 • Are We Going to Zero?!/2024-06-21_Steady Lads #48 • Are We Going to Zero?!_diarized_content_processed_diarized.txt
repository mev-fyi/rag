00:00:17.040 - 00:00:23.514, Speaker A: All right, we're live. Episode 48 of Steady Lads. Jordy, you're somewhere different. Where are you right now?
00:00:25.614 - 00:00:34.250, Speaker B: Starting day three here, we got some chips. So we'll be. We'll be battling. So you guys will have to take over today. Are you the ship?
00:00:34.282 - 00:00:35.374, Speaker A: What are you doing? Are you.
00:00:38.794 - 00:00:41.074, Speaker B: I am second in ships.
00:00:41.234 - 00:00:41.714, Speaker A: Wow.
00:00:41.794 - 00:00:48.534, Speaker B: Damn. How many? How many left? Twelve left. Yeah. Let's go.
00:00:48.874 - 00:00:49.850, Speaker C: Let's go.
00:00:50.002 - 00:01:04.684, Speaker B: Yeah, it's all good. We got. We got some fish here. We got Negrano. Very optimistic, by the way. The glass is half full, always full. He wants to say I'm a bad player, but he calls me optimistic.
00:01:04.684 - 00:01:11.224, Speaker B: He calls me optimistic. He's very polite. I'm optimistic.
00:01:12.884 - 00:01:15.944, Speaker A: Jordy, the chat is asking you to go all in next.
00:01:17.204 - 00:01:23.924, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, it's limitless. I can't go all in, but tell the chat I'll do my best.
00:01:24.424 - 00:01:25.808, Speaker A: All right? All right, sounds good.
00:01:25.816 - 00:01:28.160, Speaker B: So you guys have a good show, and I'll catch you next week.
00:01:28.312 - 00:01:28.640, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:28.672 - 00:01:29.592, Speaker A: See you, Jordy. Thanks.
00:01:29.648 - 00:01:32.804, Speaker B: Good luck, dude. I'm rooting for you.
00:01:33.424 - 00:01:34.696, Speaker C: Can you believe that?
00:01:34.880 - 00:01:36.284, Speaker B: I know. We got him live.
00:01:57.334 - 00:02:03.674, Speaker A: So who is Nagranu, by the way? Thicky and Tyke. Is he a world renowned poker player that Jordy's up against right now?
00:02:04.174 - 00:02:07.886, Speaker C: Yeah, he's, like, one of the most famous poker players of all time.
00:02:08.070 - 00:02:09.194, Speaker A: Wow. Okay.
00:02:09.694 - 00:02:14.366, Speaker B: And I think he had Phil Ivy on his match. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah.
00:02:14.390 - 00:02:19.974, Speaker C: He's got, like, two of the three, like, the most, like, maybe two out of four the most famous poker players right next to him.
00:02:20.134 - 00:02:20.814, Speaker B: Wow.
00:02:20.974 - 00:02:36.486, Speaker A: So we're live now. Jordy was live with us there. He just dialed in. We'll see how he does. I know he's been tweeting a little bit, some updates here. He's going for the bracelet. So he couldn't make steady lad, so we have to do it without him, which means we'll need all the help we can get from the audience.
00:02:36.486 - 00:03:00.284, Speaker A: So we have a few topics we want to discuss today, but if you guys want to just drop comments, we'll be watching them and be able to answer questions live and whatnot. So let's get started here. Thicke. I wanted to discuss this tweet you put out about Germany selling their bitcoin. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on your side? How much is still left to sell? What is this going to do to the markets?
00:03:01.064 - 00:03:39.584, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. This is definitely one of the big events of this week was, you know, on Juneteenth on Wednesday, Germany, the government that they seized some funds from some, like, illegal movie pirating thing back in 2010, and they voluntarily transferred 50,000 bitcoin to the government to avoid getting jail time. So they literally just gave them like $3 billion worth in today's prices. It was like 25 million back then 2012, but it's worth 3 billion now. And the german government just started sending some to Coinbase both yesterday or, sorry, two days ago and yesterday, and it just kind of spooked the market and we sold off because of that.
00:03:41.624 - 00:03:45.248, Speaker A: Wow. Okay. And how much do you think they have left to sell? Is it unclear?
00:03:45.376 - 00:04:00.804, Speaker C: Well, they've only sold like 3000, 4000 bitcoin. So, like $250 million. So they still have to sell 2.7 billion. But it's like, unclear. Like, yeah, if they're going to do it immediately or if they're going to slowly do it. This is just like test liquidity or something.
00:04:01.184 - 00:04:14.242, Speaker A: And what happened to the us government bitcoin that they had to sell? I mean, I remember last year they were supposed to sell it by the end of the year, or that's what they judge had agreed to and that it clearly didn't happen. They only sold a small bit. Is all of that still just sitting there?
00:04:14.378 - 00:04:15.694, Speaker C: So still sitting there.
00:04:16.114 - 00:04:16.974, Speaker A: Okay.
00:04:17.474 - 00:04:30.334, Speaker C: I think they changed their mind because when they seized it, bitcoin is at they route and they, like, drew it down 70%. So I think in the back of their minds, they're like, I want to sell it higher. You know, they're just like us. So they waited.
00:04:31.194 - 00:04:39.300, Speaker A: You got to wonder if they have their own version of you, thickey on their team. You know, watching sentiment on Twitter, tracking these things and getting ready to trade.
00:04:39.492 - 00:04:43.304, Speaker C: The DOJ, all these governments, the DOJ, they all have their own trading desks.
00:04:43.804 - 00:04:44.772, Speaker A: Is that true?
00:04:44.908 - 00:04:45.588, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:45.756 - 00:04:46.504, Speaker A: Wow.
00:04:47.524 - 00:05:02.858, Speaker B: I guess. I mean, it is a lot of money, right? And I guess the EDTF is happening in two weeks. There's a question for Thickie here in the comments. Mister Chef say, here he is. Love long. Eat all his net worth, around 100k. Liquidation at 29.
00:05:02.858 - 00:05:18.754, Speaker B: Don't want to realize loss, don't have much capital to add to margin. What would you recommend, Vicki? What do you guys think is going to happen with the ETF? I mean, it's in two weeks.
00:05:20.654 - 00:05:30.174, Speaker A: I've been traveling the past week, so I haven't followed it. I know. Thiki, you have some thoughts on the timeline for the launch? Is anything public or confirmed there? And what do we know?
00:05:30.594 - 00:05:53.574, Speaker C: So they just filed the amended s one s today. So they're going to wait on the SEC for another round of comments and, you know, they might accept these and they might give it like another final round. And then after that they just approve the s one s. Then it launches the next day. So the ETF guys think it's going to be July 2 is like most likely date, which is one Tuesday. Tuesday in two weeks.
00:05:54.534 - 00:06:32.084, Speaker A: Yeah, I think as far as what I think is going to happen, I mean, I think everyone's base case is that the same thing that happened with the BTC ETF launch is going to happen again. Where like, there's going to be initial sell pressure. Well, for one, it's going to look like sell the news initially, then you've got the grayscale redemptions, and then after that we'll see what real demand is like to buy into this ETF. I thought it was interesting that really a lot of the big Blackrock purchases didn't really happen for the first couple of weeks. They're really slow to get started, and I'm thinking that's what's going to happen again. But I know, Thiki, you're more bearish than me, right? You think this is going to be actual sell the news and like, this could be like a real turning point in the market after the ETF. Is that still how you guys are thinking about this?
00:06:32.864 - 00:06:37.404, Speaker C: I never said that. I don't have any views on how it's going to go.
00:06:40.304 - 00:06:41.816, Speaker A: Yeah, one bad you started, right?
00:06:41.840 - 00:07:25.654, Speaker B: Because I feel like. I feel like all the crypto natives that want to hold it or buy it has already bought. And we're kind of relying on the boomers pumping our bags and I guess counteracting the cell pressure from the grayscale ETH trust, it's really hard to get a view on how that's going to go. And I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of capital has flown to ETH and a lot of altcoins are kind of just getting shrek. Because if the ETF does well, then ETH will do well, maybe some memes will do well, and if the ETF doesn't do well, then alts are even going to get more shrek. So maybe it's just better to just, you know, flock to ETH Airdrop farm for the next couple weeks and then reevaluate. That's kind of how I'm thinking about it.
00:07:25.654 - 00:07:31.614, Speaker B: The risk of just a return of ETH, like airdrop farming, it's hard to beat that. It's hard to buy alts right now.
00:07:33.554 - 00:07:50.176, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. We'll talk about the layer zero launch in just. Just a second. I'm curious what you guys think about that sort of forced donation model, if you think something like that's effective. But I also did. I pulled up the top meme coins by market cap here on Coingecko. It's just an interesting category to look, to look at.
00:07:50.176 - 00:08:10.284, Speaker A: And you can see in the past seven days, things are down 1020, 30%, 40%. There's a few things that are notably up here. I know, Taiki, you put a tweet out about pepe being up, and you think that this could be the time, possibly for eth memes to outperform this. A lot of meme coins. Do you still think that's true, or how are you approaching this?
00:08:10.824 - 00:08:40.028, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm not, like, just buying a lot of memes. That's not really where I have an edge in. I am dabbling, though. The thing is, if you're on crypto Twitter, everyone is just anti meme, and it's this ivory tower mentality. But whenever I go to real life meetup events, I was at the blockwork spear event, and I literally sat down, and Rando just walked up to me, started showing me the meme coin that he made on base. He was like, oh, it's a $3 million market cap. I'm buying below 3 million.
00:08:40.028 - 00:09:00.010, Speaker B: It's a free trade. And I was like, you know what? Fuck this guy. And then I walked to a different table, and then the guy in front of me was like, oh, yeah. Like, I'm in web, too, and I'm in the shitcoin trenches. So clearly, like, the market wants memes. Of course. I think with the ETTF being the biggest catalyst, I think setting up a situation where Eth memes will probably outperform Solana memes.
00:09:00.010 - 00:09:20.592, Speaker B: That's not to say that I'm, like, bare salon memes, but I would much more be interested in, like, Eth ecosystem stuff than alt ecosystem stuff. Of course. Like, I'm not, like, a meme guy, so I'm not really. I'm probably not the person to ask, but I am in the trenches. I am in the trenches, and I'm trying stuff.
00:09:20.648 - 00:09:26.792, Speaker A: Thank you. Do you trade meme coins at all? I know we've mostly talked about majors with you, but I'm curious, do you dabble in any of this long tail stuff?
00:09:26.928 - 00:09:48.194, Speaker C: No, not much. Not much. Yeah, I had a question for you guys on memes. Like, do you think that this cycle definitely seems a lot more meme focused than last. Like, how do you think it's affected just the entire ecosystem as a whole? Like, do you think this, like, pre sale meta and its effect on the market is? Like. Yeah. How do you view its effect on the market?
00:09:49.814 - 00:10:18.500, Speaker A: My thoughts are, I think it's adds, like, a level of cynicism to our space or maybe amplifies the cynicism. Right. Like, I think the more meme, the better memes do. Like, it makes the space look maybe less grounded in reality. Um, we've talked about this a lot over the last few weeks, but I really don't like or agree with the idea that none of these tokens have any value. So they're all meme coins. So you might as well just pump what launched, you know, quote, fair launch.
00:10:18.500 - 00:10:37.544, Speaker A: We've dispelled that there's no such thing as a fair launch that doesn't exist. Like, whether you're pre sell, pre selling to investors, whether you're sniping a meme coin that you bought with a bot, the first few blocks, it's live. Like, there's no such thing as a fair launch. We understand that now. But, um, for me, it's pretty discouraging. I mean, we've talked about this before. I think the.
00:10:37.544 - 00:11:13.298, Speaker A: The better memes do, the worse. Like, overall, our space looks, and at the end of the day, like, it's taking capital away and investment away from projects that are actually building something innovative. So, like, if there's only, you know, $100 to go around to invest in projects, and $40 of that is going to meme coins, right? That's $40 less. That's going to people building the next uniswap or the next aave or the next layer one blockchain or the next L2. And so, like, right now, capital is not coming in this space. And when meme coins attract most of the attention, that just means capital is leaving from other places, in my view. Um, so I think it's pretty much a net negative.
00:11:13.298 - 00:11:29.334, Speaker A: Um, that's why I think it seems like we're in sort of a healthy phase where things are coming back to reality, a bit like, the meme coins are clearly not doing so well recently. Um, and we'll see what happens. I don't know, Taiki, do you. Do you share my sentiment, or. I know, maybe you're a little more positive on the memes.
00:11:29.704 - 00:12:06.706, Speaker B: Yeah. Depends like, how you think about it. But I did an interview with Joe McCann, and he kind of gave this analogy of how when you think about Vegas, you think about just gambling and all those casino profits. But I think 80% of the profits that Vegas generates as a city is coming from, I guess, non casino activities. So people come for the casino, and then people consume other things, and then that becomes, like a healthy ecosystem. And then I guess the bulk is for Solana, is that right now Solana acquired users, their memes. People figure out, learn about crypto or whatever, use other indexes.
00:12:06.706 - 00:12:26.072, Speaker B: There's more value. Cool. I don't really think that's happening right now, but I guess that's the more optimistic view. That's the more optimistic view. I mean, of course, crypto is a tool for speculation, and these shitcoins are just way out there. Um, you know, it's. It's like a decentralized system, right? Like, anyone can launch tokens.
00:12:26.072 - 00:13:05.024, Speaker B: Um, you know, I just think that, like, nothing crazy is happening. I just think it's like a byproduct of a lack of, I guess, like new apps and new infra, because last cycle we had Defi and NFTs. That's like, very, very exciting. And then this cycle, it's like, you know, we have defi and then Nfts are kind of dead. And then we have, like, infra projects that launch, you know, like start, like, you know, layer zero, like launched, or it's trading below the recent raise, which is kind of crazy to me. So too many tokens, people are jaded. But the thing is, bitcoin and ETH are still doing pretty well, if you think about it, zooming out.
00:13:05.024 - 00:13:21.794, Speaker B: But I think people have been, I guess, waiting for all season that hasn't really come only in select sections of the market. And it's just like getting people all, like, no, angry and tilted. And that's kind of how I see the markets happening right now.
00:13:22.254 - 00:13:41.310, Speaker A: Yeah. I want to highlight two comments that sort of build on what you said. One is by venture, he says, meme coin is a net negative. It's gambling. It's not replacing our financial system. But then he has, like, a really interesting point that you touched on, which he says, on the other hand, it's stress testing our infrastructure. Like, you guys saw how much activity was brought to Solana by pump fun, like, and the network held up.
00:13:41.310 - 00:14:17.132, Speaker A: Right. And it was like a great way to stress test the network with actual, genuine, real transactions. So, like, there's definitely a point there. And then to your point, Taiki, about the casino's revenue or the Vegas's revenue not chipping fully from gambling or 70% not from gambling. Joshua says he couldn't pump our eth bags if it wasn't for memes. So perhaps all of this stuff just gets recycled back into the ecosystem. What about you, Vicki? I know you've asked us a bunch, but what are your thoughts on the meme coins? Do you think it's pulling capital out, pulling capital away from the projects that matter? Or do you think, like, this is the true use case of crypto? So, like, let's just lean into it.
00:14:17.268 - 00:15:01.320, Speaker C: I've done a lot of thinking about this because, like, I was reminiscing about last cycle, and I just feel like it was so much smarter. Last cycle. Like, last cycle, I was, like, learning about, like, what, like, an XYK amm was and doing all these, like, derivations on stuff and, like, all these, like, ponzi's or, like, just a giant, like, huge convoluted machines that no one, like, quite understood the mechanism for. There's all these, like, threads, like, explaining these, like, defi protocols worked and how they could compose on top of each other to, like, hyper leverage. And, you know, the NFT tech was actually kind of, like, interesting and new. And nowadays it's. It feels a lot dumber, and I feel like a lot of, like, the marginal money and the new entrants have come into memes, and it's not until, like, these, like, random.
00:15:01.320 - 00:15:32.324, Speaker C: It's not about the tech anymore. So I do think, like, these tech alts have been, like, I think they'd be like, ten to 15% higher as a market cap if we didn't have so much sort of funneling into these meme coins. And obviously, these meme coins, they're a bit more extractive, because with these techs, with these tech sort of coins, everyone's locked and they can only sell so much, but these meme ones, they can just hitler the chart to zero immediately. So, yeah, I think that's some of the observable effect I've had on the market.
00:15:32.984 - 00:15:35.084, Speaker A: But do you think it's bad for our space?
00:15:37.844 - 00:15:54.944, Speaker C: I think it. I think it shortens the lifetime. I don't think it's, like, good or bad, but, like, I think it, like, makes it more, like. I don't. If there's another cycle where we don't have any innovation, like, the next one could just be, like, a smaller one and it could be shorter lived, and, like, at that point, a lot of people just give up and leave.
00:15:55.484 - 00:16:07.674, Speaker A: Yeah, Pat, this is sort of what we've been talking about, and it, like, Pat, encapsulated. What I've been feeling is, like, I missed last cycle so much. There were new things and it was fun to figure them out. There was nothing new. This cycle. Sort of interesting. Like, I.
00:16:07.674 - 00:16:15.134, Speaker A: When you were talking about the tech Vicky, I was like, when was the last time you heard someone talk about impermanent loss? You know, like, it's been so long.
00:16:17.034 - 00:16:45.004, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, last cycle, like, Tarun and all these, like, PhDs are, like, writing complex threads and everyone's just, like, so optimistic. Like, this is the future of finance. It's so complicated. It's like, it's so revolutionary. And we were just operating off the backs of, like, a perpetual. Like, that innovation came, like, relatively recently and, you know, the perpetuals in 2018 or 2017, and then it was, you know, all this random shit, and now it's like, now it's like, there's nothing. This cycle's got nothing.
00:16:45.164 - 00:17:06.668, Speaker A: Yeah, but, you know, like, on the positive, maybe some of this stuff is happening behind the scenes. Like this tweet from Jonah. Stable coins are the 18th biggest lender to the US. By 2030, they will be number one. Obviously, he's making a bold prediction there, but, like, it's not that far out to submit. Stable coins could become the biggest lender in 2030. Right.
00:17:06.668 - 00:17:18.904, Speaker A: And so, like, maybe a lot of this stuff is happening behind the scenes in different ways. Like, maybe we're not rewriting financial system on chain with defi apps, but maybe, like, a lot of things are moving on chain that. That is happening slowly but surely.
00:17:19.604 - 00:17:34.070, Speaker C: You're not wrong. But, like, it's. We can't make any money off of it because Paolo just keeps all of it. It's like, we can't make any money off of it. Palo just keeps the 5% and he buys a little bitcoin every. Every quarter. So, like, the only way you can actually make money is just by holding.
00:17:34.092 - 00:17:40.146, Speaker A: Holding bitcoin or maybe on some other proxy to RWA adoption, like Ondo. I don't know.
00:17:40.290 - 00:17:42.874, Speaker C: There's a meme coins involved. Yeah, yeah.
00:17:42.954 - 00:17:47.014, Speaker B: And nobody's talking about impermanent loss because it turned out to be permanent.
00:17:49.754 - 00:17:51.066, Speaker A: Did you just come up with that?
00:17:51.130 - 00:17:51.874, Speaker C: No, no, no.
00:17:51.954 - 00:17:56.014, Speaker B: It's in the chat. It's in the chat already. Oh. I'm not gonna take credit for it.
00:17:57.234 - 00:18:11.436, Speaker C: I will take credit for it. Like, that sort of disillusionment with permanent loss because, like, my first. My first claim to fame on Twitter is when I, like, called out uniswap for, like, wow, these guys are just losing like, hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and, like, no one had actually, like, measured it in the way I did.
00:18:11.620 - 00:18:20.828, Speaker A: Um, I remember that. That was awesome. And I'm curious. So, thinking of the people that are still lp ing, like, on average, they're making. They're losing, right? I think.
00:18:20.876 - 00:18:29.784, Speaker C: I think it's gotten better now, but, like, nobody talks about it. I don't think they're losing as much now because there's a lot of, like, dumb people trading. So I think they're actually break even slightly winning.
00:18:30.164 - 00:18:52.184, Speaker B: And also, it's like, there's external incentives with points and airdrops and yields. So that kind of covers it. But also, like, you know, if we're trying to create something that's no long lasting, then, yeah, you know, at some point, it has to be profitable on its own. There's a question around, I guess, layer zero. Do you want to talk about that airdrop?
00:18:53.024 - 00:19:05.328, Speaker A: Uh, yeah. I'll. I'll pull up the chart. We'll intro it, and then I'm curious if you guys got an airdrop. I did. Not personally, but you can see this is the 1 hour layer zero chart. Uh, in fairness to them, that they launched at a really tough.
00:19:05.328 - 00:19:26.660, Speaker A: In a really tough environment, right. Where sentiments just down, they launched it about at peak of $4 billion valuation. Now it's $3 billion fully diluted valuation. The really interesting thing about the airdrop is, to claim the airdrop, you had to basically pay. If you wanted to claim it, you had to pay a tax to the protocol guild. Like, I'm curious. One, did any of you guys get the airdrop? And two, did.
00:19:26.660 - 00:19:29.904, Speaker A: What did you guys donate to the protocol guild? What are your thoughts on that?
00:19:30.284 - 00:19:45.188, Speaker B: Yeah, dude, like, I mean, this was, like, my 40 x trade. I bought layers at, you know, it was trading at $4 that when I sold, like, a free 40 x, of course. Did you. That was supposed to be a joke. F it didn't land.
00:19:45.236 - 00:19:48.604, Speaker A: Okay. We weren't sure if you got in the presale or something. I don't know.
00:19:48.644 - 00:19:55.554, Speaker B: No, no, no, no. I mean, yeah. I mean, of course. Like, of course you have to pay, right? It's like, you. You pay $0.10 for it, and you get. It's, like, trading at $3.
00:19:55.974 - 00:19:56.754, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:57.574 - 00:20:10.674, Speaker B: Like, I got, like, a few thousand dollars. I feel like everyone expected it to be, like, really good, and whenever expectations are high, it's, like, impossible to reach. I'm surprised you didn't get it, Justin. I feel like you bridge a lot, right? We all use a chain?
00:20:11.934 - 00:20:28.794, Speaker A: Yeah. I've been using mostly aggregators. Like I use jumper exchange, which just aggregates to the cheapest and fastest bridge and that's typically been what I've used. I've obviously used Stargate, but I think. Didn't you need like a minimum of 50 transactions to qualify or something intense like that? I didn't have that many.
00:20:29.374 - 00:20:33.794, Speaker B: I know. There's no way I did 50 transactions on Stargate. There's no chance.
00:20:35.374 - 00:20:37.278, Speaker A: What about you Vicki? Did you get the airdrop?
00:20:37.406 - 00:20:39.830, Speaker C: No, I didn't. I got, I got called out civilian.
00:20:39.862 - 00:20:44.114, Speaker A: Well you still. Hopefully protocol yelled, right?
00:20:46.154 - 00:22:01.784, Speaker C: No, but I don't want to, like, I don't want to flame the launch too hard because Brian was a guest on steady lads, but, you know, because I didn't make it to that podcast, I guess I don't. Anyway, it's funny to me how in depth they went on like detecting sybils and like hyper optimizing this and like they went with like a bigger percent airdrop with a higher circ and it just ended up being a complete flop. There were no volumes. They got all the best sex listings, they got on Coinbase, they got binance, they got up it and it still is trading below their last round. I think maybe it's not their fault that infrastructure has just been so boring and bidless, but it's interesting to see. I just felt like they're so focused on maybe raising so much from top tier vc's and doing all the civil detection and then maybe trying to optimize the tokenomics that they forgot what really matters to get your token price to go up, which is just having a convincing and compelling narrative for djns to hold your token. So yeah, I think it's been a pretty, I mean, Zksync also is pretty floppy this week, but yeah, both of them have been like really bad.
00:22:02.204 - 00:22:11.574, Speaker A: Can you explain? I'll pull up coingecko here so we can see some info on the volume. Like why is this, why is layer zero a flop to you in your mind? Like is that a definitive conclusion or is that just your opinion?
00:22:12.434 - 00:22:15.894, Speaker C: I think if you, if you trade below your last raise, it's a flop.
00:22:18.154 - 00:22:18.834, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:22:18.914 - 00:22:20.602, Speaker C: Yeah, that's definition at least.
00:22:20.658 - 00:22:24.734, Speaker A: Well it. The last raise was at 3 billion. It's, it's basically there. Right?
00:22:25.474 - 00:22:28.242, Speaker C: Well if it's not like some multiple, then it's a flop.
00:22:28.378 - 00:22:29.174, Speaker A: Okay.
00:22:30.034 - 00:22:43.606, Speaker B: Yeah, like wouldn't, like, I feel like this has to be like a decent buy here. Of course, like that's not based on any fundamental analysis. It's more like, you know, I feel like there would be buyers below three from a trading perspective. Did you try trading this, Vicki?
00:22:43.790 - 00:22:45.966, Speaker C: By trading, and I lost money on it.
00:22:45.990 - 00:23:05.514, Speaker A: So is there any point where you'd buy back in? I mean, like, layer zero is building some really cool stuff. Brian's clearly a thought leader in this space. Very smart guy. Massive Runway, massive treasury. Last I saw an announcement on, it was like, on $100 million treasury or close to it. Right. They've got a ton of capital to build and innovate.
00:23:05.514 - 00:23:08.562, Speaker A: Like, is there any world where you're longing this Vicki or.
00:23:08.738 - 00:23:12.374, Speaker C: No, probably buy it, like at a dollar down.
00:23:13.274 - 00:23:16.530, Speaker B: Psychological support. Yeah.
00:23:16.602 - 00:23:19.414, Speaker A: What about you, Tyky? Are you buying this thing at some point?
00:23:19.954 - 00:23:30.954, Speaker B: Um, not really. I still have my airdrop. Um, I sold a little bit, but I still have, like. I mean, it's like two k, right? It's like, whatever. Um, but it kind of rans a.
00:23:30.954 - 00:23:32.294, Speaker A: Lot of money for a lot of people.
00:23:33.054 - 00:24:07.706, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, but, like, given the amount of volume I did, I would expected it to be bigger. I feel like, you know, because the most recent airdrops have done really poorly because maybe they just, like, launched too high. And if optimism, they just, like, launched when, like, Suzu was, like, in the three arrows was getting liquidated. And then, like, that token has technically be been putting in higher highs and higher lows. Maybe not recently. So I feel like tokens that airdrop in, like, a really unfavorable environment are candidates for better longs. But, you know, would I rather hold eth? Probably.
00:24:07.706 - 00:24:26.494, Speaker B: And I think that's kind of the mental calculation people come to. It's like, would I rather just pull this thing, watch the charts, see if I can see if it goes up 50%? Or should I just sell to eth and farm some LRT protocol? I feel like that's kind of everyone's mindset right now, and it's hard to get people to buy these things right now.
00:24:27.534 - 00:24:46.394, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. I know, like, jordy's talked about it a lot. Like, people also really need something to do with the token. Like, no one wants to just hold a token in their wallet like it has. They need it to be staked somewhere, even if the yield is trivial. Like, do you guys think it would have made a difference if, like, layer zero ZK saying all of these platforms had, like, staking on day one?
00:24:47.894 - 00:24:58.744, Speaker B: I don't really think so. I mean, doesn't wormhole have staking? And it's also, like, down, you know, and they didn't have like a Monad thing. Monad essentially.
00:25:00.884 - 00:25:07.500, Speaker A: I just, like, every launch is just a dilutive event to the whole space. It's very interesting, you know.
00:25:07.692 - 00:25:37.124, Speaker C: Yeah. I think last cycle infrastructure was very, very hyped and that's why, like, they got, they got so much money getting pumped into it because that, like a proven track record of working. But like, I think, you know, this cycle has just been a clear example of, like, there was just too much money allocated in the private round to infrastructure and now it's just like, it's overvalued and it doesn't do that well in public. I'm still hopeful for Monad. I still think layer ones, like, still have a premium over, like, let's say, infrastructure, but, yeah, we'll see.
00:25:38.624 - 00:25:39.992, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the last one.
00:25:40.008 - 00:25:41.604, Speaker C: It's the last hype launch. Right.
00:25:42.784 - 00:25:47.150, Speaker A: Well, we still need Eigen layer to go liquid, even though it's Eigen layer. Yeah.
00:25:47.302 - 00:26:03.514, Speaker C: The funny thing is, like, we. Everyone. Because Stark launched at like, what? They launched at like 20, Bill? 25. Yeah, everyone thought ZK sync would be 20. Everyone thought wormhole would be like 15. Everyone thought layer zero would be 15. And they're like a fifth of what people expected now.
00:26:05.734 - 00:26:14.594, Speaker B: Yeah, there's like no buyers, right? Like, everyone farms it to sell. So it's like, it's hard to buy and the only buyers are like term traders. It's like, oh, like, here's their John fractal.
00:26:16.464 - 00:26:28.044, Speaker C: It's a tough time out there. It's. The meme coins are sucking away all the speculative capital. All these, like, retards that would have bought this coin and held it to zero. They're not doing it now. This goes to zero faster.
00:26:28.784 - 00:26:29.816, Speaker A: Yeah, it's efficient.
00:26:29.880 - 00:26:31.432, Speaker B: It's good. Maybe it's more efficient this way.
00:26:31.488 - 00:26:40.632, Speaker A: The Solana meme coin is also taking a ton of speculative capital out of the space too, I'd say. Yeah, let's talk about, let's talk about solely.
00:26:40.688 - 00:26:43.000, Speaker C: Oh, my God, it's terrible. Jesus.
00:26:43.072 - 00:27:08.824, Speaker A: So I think I, you know, announced my public call that this was the top on May. Seems like widely reported. Seems like that was the case. Um, what, what do you guys think happens here? I mean, this can't go on forever, right? Like, maybe Solana sole eth goes down another 1020 percent. But I do. I do think Solana has a bright future ahead. All jokes aside, like, do you guys think this bleed continues through the rest of the year? Through the rest of the summer? Lol.
00:27:08.824 - 00:27:12.514, Speaker A: What are you guys expecting here? All right. And do any of you hold soul?
00:27:14.174 - 00:27:20.554, Speaker C: I don't hold. So I think. I think all coins have topped globally and everything will bleed against everything.
00:27:21.934 - 00:27:24.114, Speaker B: So you mean like the majors, right?
00:27:24.574 - 00:27:34.274, Speaker C: Yeah, everything will bleed against ETH. ETH bleed against bitcoin? Yeah. Everything will bleed against something that has a higher market cap in it.
00:27:35.454 - 00:27:41.274, Speaker A: Yeah. So you think. You. You think the ETF is not going to basically reverse the ETH BTC ratio?
00:27:42.814 - 00:27:44.594, Speaker C: I have no views on that, Justin.
00:27:45.734 - 00:27:49.710, Speaker A: Well, you just said ETH is going to bleed to bitcoin, so maybe I'll. We'll go ahead and make that assumption.
00:27:49.782 - 00:27:50.874, Speaker C: I didn't say that.
00:27:51.974 - 00:27:52.902, Speaker A: Okay.
00:27:53.078 - 00:27:53.534, Speaker B: Okay.
00:27:53.574 - 00:27:55.234, Speaker A: What about you, Tyson? What do you think?
00:27:55.614 - 00:28:02.874, Speaker B: I feel like EBTC is going to be, like, around 0.06 and it'll just be ranging and it's going to drive people insane.
00:28:04.274 - 00:28:10.094, Speaker A: Yeah. Who was it that said 0.069 is the fair valuation? It's just going to chop around from 0.05 to 0.08?
00:28:10.474 - 00:28:19.414, Speaker B: Susan, I think said, like, yeah, 0.07 is like, the fair value and you know, it's going to range.
00:28:19.834 - 00:28:20.614, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:23.794 - 00:28:26.574, Speaker B: Let's see. You want to do some.
00:28:29.394 - 00:28:34.092, Speaker C: You called the top. Are you covering your short now? Moral short?
00:28:34.228 - 00:28:42.044, Speaker A: Unfortunately, I never shorted. I don't think it's. I think it's too soon to call a moral short. I need to see more capitulation on. On Twitter.
00:28:42.164 - 00:28:43.624, Speaker C: Lower, you think lower.
00:28:44.244 - 00:29:04.548, Speaker A: Well, listen, look, I've been. We've been eating glass, like, EtH maxis have been eating glass for how long now? A year and a half, two years. If you consider ETH BTC just being down only for, like, over two years now. And in a world where meme coins are fading, Solana has nothing. Right. Solana was only. Basically, the only activity was meme coins.
00:29:04.548 - 00:29:36.322, Speaker A: We talked about how there's really not any app layer innovation there, even aside from, like, what's being done on the infrastructure and tech side for this, for Solana itself. But if meme coins are fading away, right, Solana should just be like. Should trade as a proxy for that, right? Activity is going to go down on Solana. All the metrics that look good before don't look as good. ETH got the ETF coming up. I mean, you would expect this to go lower, but I do think Salada, like, on average, will outperform ETH just because it's so much smaller. You know, it has a lot less ground to cover and a lot less capital needed to push it up.
00:29:36.322 - 00:29:57.254, Speaker A: So I think this has to go lower. Maybe through the rest of the summer lull. I think the ETH, eventually, within the first few months of it being live, will have meaningful inflows. I agree with Tyk that ETH BTC should go up a little, maybe that's 2.06, maybe 0.07. But I'm definitely not like a sole leaf buyer here. I don't necessarily think it's the right time to sell, but not long in Solana here.
00:29:59.974 - 00:30:00.874, Speaker C: Fair enough.
00:30:01.294 - 00:30:02.510, Speaker B: Yeah, fair enough.
00:30:02.622 - 00:30:04.174, Speaker C: Articulated answer, Justin?
00:30:04.294 - 00:30:26.794, Speaker A: Yeah, I see a lot of questions about the DJT meme token situation. From my understanding, Martin Shkreli sort of tricked Barron Trump or convinced Barron Trump to launch DJT. Have you guys followed that at all? Did. Did you trade that at all? Thicky or Tyche? Did you follow, you know, I know there was some anger on the timeline between Ryan Selkis and Martin Shkreli. Have you kept along with that?
00:30:28.464 - 00:30:36.472, Speaker B: I personally haven't. I'm not sure why. Like, the chat thinks I'm, like, some DJT guy, but I honestly think, you.
00:30:36.488 - 00:30:37.924, Speaker A: Know, some inside info.
00:30:38.224 - 00:30:55.498, Speaker B: No, no, no. I do know someone that, like, bought DJT really early, made like a few mil, but, like, round tripped it, so it's, you know, it's tough out there. Yeah, but there is, like, I guess opportunities. I know it's so little bit.
00:30:55.546 - 00:31:02.734, Speaker C: Every little pump you sell, a little bit, little checkpoint, you're peeing out. People always around everything.
00:31:03.194 - 00:31:41.232, Speaker B: Yeah, people want the home runs. And I was also thinking about it because, like, I've been, like, buying, like, random shit coins, like, memes. And, like, for me, like, I just know that this is all vaporware, so it's like, you know, it's easy for me to, like, trade it or, like, take profits and whatnot. But, like, I'm so mid curve that, like, whenever I buy, like, a tech play, I just, like, believe in the tech too much, and I got, okay, okay. I forgot that mid group meme existed. But anyways, I feel like, you know, with, like, tech plays, like, infra plays, I kind of, like, believe in the tech too much. And I, like, bag hold, but I feel like, with these, like, shitcoins, I'm like, I feel like I'm, like, a better trader for these things.
00:31:41.232 - 00:31:56.792, Speaker B: And maybe, like, that's why I think he's, like, so good, because he just thinks everything's a paperware, so he's just like, oh, yeah, like, I'll buy it here, sell it here. You know, like, screw this. Like, these people are yapping, like, in the grand exchange. Do you think that makes you a better trader, like, to be.
00:31:56.808 - 00:32:21.854, Speaker C: So I think it's. I think it's good for, like, locking in, like, some wealth and, like, slowly grinding it up. But the people that will, like, make the most wealth and the most parabolic wealth every cycle are always people that just hold from zero. But it's just, like, a lot. It's more of, like, a lottery than, like, something that's, like, you know, for sure gonna happen. I think just depends on, like, your personality type, your risk tolerance.
00:32:22.994 - 00:32:36.774, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm still upset at Jordy. He's not here to defend himself. But Jordy shield us all on Trump as a hedge against Bowdoin's performance. The Trump bowdoin ratio. And it looks like now there's so many other Trump tokens. The Trump meme has been diluted out of control.
00:32:37.634 - 00:32:39.946, Speaker B: Even bowdoin's, like, down 90% or something.
00:32:40.090 - 00:32:40.602, Speaker A: It's.
00:32:40.698 - 00:32:44.800, Speaker C: I know. Brutal.
00:32:44.992 - 00:32:49.404, Speaker B: Wait, did you get, like, an alarm for something thicky? Yeah, I saw your phone again.
00:32:49.864 - 00:32:50.272, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:32:50.288 - 00:32:57.564, Speaker C: I've been getting a lot of. There's a lot been a lot of s one filing stuff. They all finished filing their s one s today, so they're gonna do zero fees.
00:32:58.144 - 00:33:08.048, Speaker A: Wait, what? Yeah, for the first six months or for a promotional period or forever. I think it might be forever because they're staking on the back end. You think, or.
00:33:08.176 - 00:33:18.616, Speaker C: No, I don't think they can do that. Um, I think they're just trying to, like, win the crypto games. They're like. Yeah, just, like, competing on the fees a lot. It's like a race to zero.
00:33:18.760 - 00:33:26.296, Speaker A: Is it any notable. Yeah. Notable funds that are doing 0% fee, or is it just the smaller ones, like, bit wise and stuff?
00:33:26.400 - 00:33:28.684, Speaker C: Like, I think it's fidelity and Blackrock.
00:33:29.784 - 00:33:32.264, Speaker A: Wow. So that is extremely bullish. Right?
00:33:32.384 - 00:33:40.050, Speaker B: Isn't that, like, a leading indicator? Because, like, if they're doing that, then that basically means that they're going to show the fuck out of it in the first couple of weeks and months.
00:33:40.162 - 00:33:44.970, Speaker C: It'S, like, out of it. They don't get any fees, but it's a lot.
00:33:45.002 - 00:33:49.054, Speaker B: They're going to turn the fee switch on. It's like. It's like, uniswap, right? Like this fucking liquidity.
00:33:50.634 - 00:33:51.634, Speaker A: No, no, no.
00:33:51.794 - 00:33:55.454, Speaker C: You can't just get aum in and increase fees. You can only decrease fees.
00:33:57.514 - 00:33:57.938, Speaker A: Wow.
00:33:57.986 - 00:34:00.454, Speaker B: I feel like it's, like, different, though, but I don't know.
00:34:04.614 - 00:34:05.518, Speaker C: That's very.
00:34:05.566 - 00:34:06.014, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:34:06.134 - 00:34:07.038, Speaker C: Compliment.
00:34:07.206 - 00:34:07.838, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:07.966 - 00:34:08.914, Speaker B: Thank you, sir.
00:34:09.534 - 00:34:14.074, Speaker C: Thank you, Pop. All right, so we do Q and A or is there anything else you want to talk about?
00:34:16.094 - 00:34:17.034, Speaker B: Let's see.
00:34:17.974 - 00:34:35.529, Speaker A: Let's tell people to get their questions lined up. Drop your questions here. Also, it looks like Pat is saying there are fees. Franklin has 0.19 grayscale, 0.2. Vicki, do you know if that's Grayscale's new ETF or the eth one? They're just dropping it down to 0.2.
00:34:35.601 - 00:34:49.713, Speaker C: Well, just. Just to, like. I mean, grayscale for bitcoin is at, like, 150 bps. So, like, them going to 0.2, they're going to be the highest. So fidelity zero. And if the grayscale, which is the highest Franklin's is the Franklin doesn't matter.
00:34:49.713 - 00:34:52.649, Speaker C: But, like, if Grayscale is a, .2 then yeah.
00:34:52.721 - 00:35:09.234, Speaker A: Well, that's going to mean, like, outflows are significant to be significantly dampened right from the Ethi. ETF. E trust to the point. Yeah. Takes. No, I got thinking to acknowledge my point. That's a huge.
00:35:09.234 - 00:35:11.326, Speaker A: This is huge.
00:35:11.510 - 00:35:12.554, Speaker B: This is huge.
00:35:13.214 - 00:35:24.064, Speaker C: But I think they were gonna come out. It might, like, stem some of the rotational stuff, but, like, if they wanted to get out, I don't think they'd really care. There's no, like, fee to get out.
00:35:26.084 - 00:35:27.024, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:35:27.404 - 00:35:28.184, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:29.964 - 00:35:43.348, Speaker A: All right, let's. Let's have the audience drop Q and A. We just got a message from Jordy offline that so far, all. Okay. So hopefully he's doing well at the poker table. It looks like he might even be sending a video now. So if we get that video before the show ends.
00:35:43.396 - 00:35:43.916, Speaker B: Oh, sick.
00:35:43.980 - 00:35:52.934, Speaker A: We'll definitely have to. Have to pull it up, as long as it's appropriate for the audience. But folks have questions. Drop them in here, and then we'll dive into pasta.
00:35:53.474 - 00:35:57.294, Speaker B: Yo, pull up that video.
00:35:58.034 - 00:36:09.894, Speaker A: All right, one sec. I gotta. Alright, so we've got some live footage from Jordy just streaming. And now I'm gonna pull this up best I can. All right.
00:36:12.354 - 00:36:20.444, Speaker B: If you wanna read. Yeah, we'll do questions after you pull this up.
00:36:20.864 - 00:36:23.724, Speaker A: All right, let me know when you guys. How.
00:36:25.184 - 00:36:25.648, Speaker B: There you go.
00:36:25.656 - 00:36:26.000, Speaker C: There you go.
00:36:26.032 - 00:36:26.804, Speaker B: That's good.
00:36:29.024 - 00:36:30.844, Speaker A: Look at that chip count.
00:36:31.224 - 00:36:37.404, Speaker B: I know. He's got. He's got some. He's got the tower. He's got the ivory tower going.
00:36:37.904 - 00:36:40.084, Speaker C: The grommet looks like it's about to go bust.
00:36:43.464 - 00:36:52.904, Speaker B: I think Ivy's just putting him on the spot. We'll see what happens. That's crazy. He said he's at a table with Ivy and Negroni. Like, it's crazy.
00:36:52.944 - 00:36:54.312, Speaker C: Jordy's living like, cause a dream.
00:36:54.368 - 00:36:55.536, Speaker B: Yeah, I know.
00:36:55.600 - 00:37:07.524, Speaker A: All right. I still. I see some questions here. Coming in mood mode tikey. Are you still bullish on Celestia? And then what do you think, Vicki? I think I can guess what Vicki thinks about Celestia, but let's start with tyche.
00:37:08.044 - 00:37:31.340, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I still like Celestia. I'm so shocked to have begun zero airdrops. It's pretty bad, but for me, I staked early to mid December, and internally I was like, okay, this is a cycle. Hold or cycle. Yeah, I'm just gonna hold it for the cycle. That's still kind of how I view it. There's all these modular projects launching soon.
00:37:31.340 - 00:37:50.444, Speaker B: When I say soon, I have no idea what that actually means. And, you know, if they, you know, hopefully, you know, they airdrop. I don't think the airdrop is gonna be, like, crazy, but I still like Celestia. But maybe it's better to, like, buy the slots or something, like the NFT collection. It's harder to symbol, maybe, but.
00:37:52.144 - 00:37:53.724, Speaker C: Celestia is going to zero.
00:37:56.464 - 00:38:01.484, Speaker B: Dude, I saw his nostrils fuck. That's so intimidating.
00:38:02.344 - 00:38:14.204, Speaker A: Vicky, uh, not. Not to pick on you, but Chad. Chad said he had a little freudian slip here. Are you Giga bearish ethan ETH BTC, smirking because of no fees and whatnot.
00:38:15.584 - 00:38:18.364, Speaker C: I'm not Giga bearish eth or Eth BTC.
00:38:19.144 - 00:38:26.424, Speaker B: He's gigabarish. Okay, not yet, right? Not yet. Yeah.
00:38:28.044 - 00:38:30.624, Speaker C: There will be a time when Justin Bram sells.
00:38:31.924 - 00:38:33.904, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, let's talk about that, Justin.
00:38:34.644 - 00:38:35.384, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:36.644 - 00:39:01.914, Speaker A: I mean, I've said for a long time, you know what? Like, when you look, when you load up a huge position, sub 1000 and, you know, 900 and whatnot, you got to think about when it's appropriate to sell. I also work in this industry. So you want to de risk and not be fully exposed all the time. Uh, but I am quite exposed now and have been really, since the bear market. Um, I've. I've said I've. I've wanted to sell sort of by the end of this year.
00:39:01.914 - 00:39:40.330, Speaker A: Like, I just can't stomach going through another bear market again. Like, I'd rather miss out on an extra 40% or 25% or 30% upside than just go through the bear market. It would have been so nice, you know, last bear, last bull market, I didn't really sell much. It would have been so nice to have stables to just buy the dip. Um, so I think by the end of this year would be, like, a good time to start considering selling, but that still could be early. Things are taking longer than I thought. So maybe, like, q one, q two next year, I'm 90% out of the markets, and, you know, for most folks, they know, like, I basically just have Eth right now and then venture deals and angel deals.
00:39:40.330 - 00:40:09.114, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think Eth has done okay. I still think there's a ton room to grow. I think ten k still can happen this cycle. I'm still, like, quite bullish and quite excited about that, and I think we're all going to be pleasantly surprised by the Eth ETF. So, you know, if things get really heated by the end of this year, I'm gone. I'll still come and chill on the podcast with you guys and listen to you guys bickering about how everything's going down, but try to be out by q four, q one, q two, something like that. But obviously I'll keep you guys posted.
00:40:09.974 - 00:40:17.720, Speaker B: Yeah, like, that's so bearish. You know, like, someone like Justin's thinking about selling end of year. Like, think about all the other jet, like, justin Bram.
00:40:17.792 - 00:40:25.724, Speaker C: They're all. They're all thinking about selling. They've been waiting for this. They've been waiting for this for years. They're all trying to sell everyone, every last one of them.
00:40:26.224 - 00:40:30.604, Speaker A: We were all. We held for ten years just for the ETF, and then we're all trying to dump.
00:40:33.624 - 00:40:43.374, Speaker B: I think that's true, though. I feel like every, like, big eth holder is going to, like, just going to start de risking, like, end of this year. Um, well, you really need, like.
00:40:44.594 - 00:41:15.314, Speaker A: I agree. I also think, like, the pace, the case for bitcoin is, like, stronger than ever. Like, in a world where crypto is just meme coins and gambling. You want to hold bitcoin, you don't want to hold ethereum, right? Like, ethereum is betting on the on chain casino, betting on innovation, betting on smart contracts, etcetera. In a world where that's not relevant, if that's where we're headed, which I don't think it is, but, like, in a world where people think that's, you know, we missed a cycle of innovation, we have a bear market. The narrative is going to get pretty bad. Right? And, like, in that case, you really would rather hold bitcoin, in my opinion.
00:41:15.314 - 00:41:24.234, Speaker A: I don't know. But, tyk, you're always. You're committed to always having exposure, right? Just because of your podcast and your humble farmer army community. Is that right?
00:41:24.894 - 00:41:35.442, Speaker B: Yeah, I always have, like, at least half my net worth, liquid net worth in crypto and it's pretty brutal. But, you know, the other 40, does.
00:41:35.458 - 00:41:37.134, Speaker A: That count stable, whatever it is?
00:41:37.874 - 00:41:46.694, Speaker B: Yeah, it does. But I don't. I barely hold stables right now. I'm like, just so heavy eth. Just like farming. Just like air drop farming?
00:41:47.394 - 00:41:56.094, Speaker A: Yeah, it's thick. Do you have, like, a cold storage or like a moon bag? Like, are you zero? You're just trading.
00:41:57.474 - 00:42:21.524, Speaker C: I have, like, two bitcoins because I'm trying to, like, do some cap gains thing. I'm trying to maximize for, but yeah, yeah, I. Yeah. I don't know. I'm just, like, not that optimistic. Well, I don't know. I'm not going to talk about this now.
00:42:23.824 - 00:42:49.714, Speaker A: People think we're too bearish and so we got a lot. We got to liven ourselves up and be a little more bullish. I will say, like, I think that the cycle is far from over. I think a lot of good things are still to come. But I do think, like, if we don't have innovation by the end of this cycle, whenever, like, global macro starts to turn for the worst, which could be coming soon, in the next six months or something like that, if we haven't innovated at least a little bit, that's not going to look good when we go to through the bear market again, you know?
00:42:51.814 - 00:42:52.594, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:55.774 - 00:43:11.172, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I have the fees wrong from earlier. So, like, disregard what I said. FTC, zero fee until. For a year. But grayscale, the mini one is, is 20 bps, but, like, the bigger one is actually 250. So it's 100 higher.
00:43:11.172 - 00:43:14.264, Speaker C: So they're actually trying to incentivize people to leave eth.
00:43:15.324 - 00:43:26.604, Speaker A: Wow. Okay, interesting. Shall we jump to pasta? And then if any good questions come through, we'll. We'll tackle those after pasta.
00:43:27.984 - 00:43:29.008, Speaker C: Sounds good.
00:43:29.176 - 00:43:30.084, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
00:43:33.504 - 00:43:39.684, Speaker A: You guys, we got to pump the energy up. We got to get the crowd moving. We got 350 live viewers here.
00:43:39.984 - 00:43:43.324, Speaker B: It's so hot in this room. New York is so fucking hot.
00:43:43.704 - 00:43:45.564, Speaker A: But is there a wave there now?
00:43:45.904 - 00:43:56.786, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like in the mid nineties. It's ridiculous. All right, that's why I think he's got a wife beater on. All right, should I go first? I can go first.
00:43:56.970 - 00:44:02.466, Speaker A: I think I have the weakest one. So, like, let me go first. We'll get it out of the way, and then we can chuckle for yours. Fair? Okay.
00:44:02.490 - 00:44:03.494, Speaker B: Okay. Okay, sure.
00:44:03.994 - 00:44:23.426, Speaker A: So I was, I was traveling this week. I wasn't following Twitter. My pasta is so weak. But I do think it's very topical for what we've been talking about. Vance Spencer meme coin super cycle canceled. You know, I opened my phone this morning. I haven't been tracking the markets, and this was, like, the first tweet I saw.
00:44:23.426 - 00:44:46.518, Speaker A: I haven't really even been on Twitter too much in the past week, and then seeing this just made me so happy on the inside, because I'm someone that's missed all of the meme coins. And then I did some research, went on coingecko, looked through the charts, and saw that this was, in fact, confirmed. So not the funniest, but I don't know. This just made me feel a little bit better. Potato says I got a zero out of ten, which is fair.
00:44:46.566 - 00:44:47.102, Speaker B: It's a.
00:44:47.198 - 00:44:47.670, Speaker C: It's a.
00:44:47.742 - 00:45:11.770, Speaker B: It's a cope pasta. I actually disagree. I actually think meme coins are just gonna continue to outperform because, you know, we talked about how all the infrastructure and, like, all the speculative capital is still gonna go to memes. It's just like, you know, it's hard to pick these memes. But, you know, right now, I'm looking for, like, the TikTok coin. I'm like, I'm on TikTok. I'm following all the grifters scan, like, you know, showing, like, random, like, yes.
00:45:11.770 - 00:45:17.394, Speaker B: Hoping that I can kind of, you know, predict the tick tock out. Go. Yeah.
00:45:17.434 - 00:45:22.974, Speaker A: Jordy won the pasta this week with his video, his live video from poker. I think that's fair.
00:45:23.314 - 00:45:24.534, Speaker B: Yeah, that's pretty good.
00:45:26.114 - 00:45:28.826, Speaker A: Tyche. Do you want to send me your pasta, and I'll pull it up?
00:45:29.010 - 00:45:31.858, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm sharing the screen right now, if you can.
00:45:31.986 - 00:45:34.558, Speaker A: Oh, perfect. Yep, I got it up.
00:45:34.746 - 00:46:02.936, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, based 16 Z, he mentioned that, you know, when we talked about how study lads, we have zero viewers. You know, base 16 Z said his top signal is when one woman watches the study labs podcast. And this was. When was this? This was June 10. You know, we saw our female viewership go to 1%, and that kind of coincided with all the memes, like, getting the alts, getting shrek. So, you know, like, I thought this was kind of funny.
00:46:02.936 - 00:46:09.960, Speaker B: You know, like, it's just steady lads. No, like, no female viewership. We get 1%, and the market goes to zero. Okay. And, like, not zero.
00:46:09.992 - 00:46:10.160, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:10.192 - 00:46:14.924, Speaker B: Of course. Like, I'm just kind of poking fun, but I just thought that, you know, this was hilarious.
00:46:17.944 - 00:46:19.484, Speaker A: Chocolate says no.
00:46:21.064 - 00:46:21.924, Speaker B: I know.
00:46:25.224 - 00:46:28.704, Speaker A: And then, thicky, what do you have for us today?
00:46:30.324 - 00:46:36.584, Speaker C: What do I have? Oh, this is on the layer zero claim. So funny.
00:46:37.804 - 00:46:39.944, Speaker A: Will you send me the link so I could pull it up.
00:46:40.804 - 00:46:41.584, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:43.564 - 00:46:44.904, Speaker B: It'S in the telegram.
00:46:45.484 - 00:46:47.624, Speaker A: Oh, I see it here. Thank you.
00:46:52.904 - 00:47:13.844, Speaker C: There is no force donation. If you don't want to donate, simply don't claim it's not something you own, it's something being offered. So I just love how, like, intimidating and, like, the picture. For those listening on, like, Spotify is a picture of the dawn from the Godfather with this caption.
00:47:14.904 - 00:47:36.664, Speaker A: You know, I. I actually was reading. I don't know, maybe you guys did some more research or thinking you might know, but I was actually hearing Brian's playing, like, 3d chess here. And then because you're forced to donate it, it's actually like a capital gain because there's a real cost to acquiring your tokens and it's not income. Do you guys know anything about that? Or is that just, you know, one person on Twitter larping as an accountant?
00:47:38.084 - 00:47:43.984, Speaker C: That's what I heard. And I think, you know, if you provide the transactions iR's, they're gonna, like, count as a capital gain. Yeah.
00:47:44.564 - 00:47:45.344, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:46.204 - 00:48:02.364, Speaker C: Like, you only have. You only write off the income on what you claim it for. And then if you sell it a year later, then, yeah, you give you better tax benefits. So you're saying it's like 3d chest because it actually incentivizes people to hold their tokens for a year to minimize.
00:48:04.144 - 00:48:04.888, Speaker B: That's interesting.
00:48:04.936 - 00:48:06.324, Speaker A: We'll see if that happens.
00:48:07.624 - 00:48:16.944, Speaker B: That's the best one. Mistaking this is a. The energy on this podcast is at an all time low.
00:48:18.244 - 00:48:29.104, Speaker A: I'm trying this cake. I'm trying. I know this lb had a funny comment about your pasta tanky. Women probably just checking why their boyfriends cry all day.
00:48:29.844 - 00:48:31.060, Speaker B: That's probably true.
00:48:31.252 - 00:48:32.024, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:32.604 - 00:48:39.604, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, maybe we can do a little poll if Brad can pull that up.
00:48:41.144 - 00:48:49.120, Speaker A: I think the clear winner here is thicky, though. I don't even know if we need to pull this. I think I know my pasta running. Jordy's could be.
00:48:49.152 - 00:48:57.684, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not a pasta, but, like, it's such a chad move to be in, like, near the final table and just, like, pop it.
00:48:58.064 - 00:48:59.104, Speaker C: I'll help get a really?
00:48:59.144 - 00:49:05.454, Speaker B: From Daniel Negroni. Yeah. That'd be sick. Yeah, I know. He's been wanting a bracelet for years.
00:49:06.274 - 00:49:08.494, Speaker C: You can, like, show it on the stream next time.
00:49:10.034 - 00:49:34.294, Speaker B: Yeah. Unlike on the grounders channel, too. Yeah. I feel like people give us criticism that, like, our pod is, like, pretty bearish, but I feel like we're just kind of honest with how we feel every week. It's like, it's easy to get jaded, you know? Like, obviously I'm like a permeable of the industry, but, you know, just like, seeing what happens week to week is like, yeah, like, yeah, it is pretty, pretty boring sometimes.
00:49:35.114 - 00:49:42.370, Speaker C: I'm unapologetically bearish. Anyone has a problem, they can go, fuck off. Yes. No.
00:49:42.402 - 00:49:42.970, Speaker A: No, thank you.
00:49:43.002 - 00:49:47.042, Speaker B: No, thank you. Gets so much hate. But, like, we all need someone to tell us that our bags are going to zero.
00:49:47.098 - 00:49:59.084, Speaker A: He doesn't get hate. Everyone just tells him his skin looks great. Everyone wants his opinion on everything. Like, it's crazy. He doesn't get hate. Even though he's more bearish than I am. I get hate for my solana takes, whereas he's hating on the whole industry.
00:50:00.224 - 00:50:13.400, Speaker B: And I'm midcurve and no, like, everyone, like, no one hates a mid curve. So, yeah, it's like they did. They're like, oh, tyke is a mid curve. I feel sorry for the game. Yeah, he's just trying, you know, he's just trying.
00:50:13.472 - 00:50:14.244, Speaker A: He's trying.
00:50:14.904 - 00:50:16.804, Speaker B: He's trying to be best. You know?
00:50:18.184 - 00:50:35.906, Speaker A: We have 55 votes. If you haven't voted yet, we've got hundreds of you listening, so make sure to vote and we'll pull up the results of the poll in just a moment. So the poll is up. Also, a friendly reminder to like and subscribe. It just takes a second to do both while we're waiting on those poll results. Great time to do it. I can promise you.
00:50:35.906 - 00:50:57.394, Speaker A: Jordy's going to be back next week and we're going to be back with some fire energy. Maybe while we wait for the poll, Brad, we can shut it down in 30 seconds, but want to go around. What are you guys doing this weekend? I'll start. I'm in Colorado. I'm going camping this weekend, which should be fun. Should do a little fly fishing and touching some grass, which should be nice. What about you guys? Anything fun going on?
00:50:58.374 - 00:51:07.614, Speaker B: What am I doing? This is so wholesome, but I'm gonna go. It's like a board game night with a bunch of wholesome Asians. Let's play some.
00:51:07.694 - 00:51:10.314, Speaker A: Vicky. Are you, are you gonna. Are you a board game guy?
00:51:11.134 - 00:51:13.798, Speaker C: I am a board game guy. No, I am a board game guy.
00:51:13.926 - 00:51:22.484, Speaker A: All right, well, what board games are like, closest to trading, right? Because it's all game theory, right? Like settlers of Catan. Is that a good one? Are you a mahjong guy?
00:51:25.104 - 00:51:27.192, Speaker B: Yo, yo.
00:51:27.248 - 00:51:27.760, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:27.792 - 00:51:28.312, Speaker B: Canceled.
00:51:28.368 - 00:51:31.524, Speaker A: Just kidding. What do you mean? It's a strategic game.
00:51:32.504 - 00:51:33.684, Speaker C: I don't realize.
00:51:36.144 - 00:51:36.664, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:51:36.704 - 00:51:49.374, Speaker C: I think about that more. There are a lot of board games I like. My board game choice is pretty vanilla. So I think there are some, like, esoteric ones that are actually quite a lot closer. But I am. I am going out and socializing. Um, I've.
00:51:49.374 - 00:51:56.154, Speaker C: I've been stuck inside trading for the past six months, so it's finally nice to, like, touch grass again.
00:51:57.054 - 00:51:57.526, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:57.590 - 00:51:57.814, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:57.854 - 00:52:01.166, Speaker A: All right. I guess that's the theme of the week. We're all. We're all touching grass.

00:52:02.190 - 00:52:08.914, Speaker B: Like. Like, why are we. Why always touch grass? Touch the fucking buy button and earn your money for once. According to LV.
00:52:10.974 - 00:52:26.216, Speaker A: That might be. That might be the top pasta. Someone needs to tweet that out. That's fire. One last thing before we show the results of the poll. Thinking, I've always wondered this. Crypto is a 24/7 market.
00:52:26.216 - 00:52:31.352, Speaker A: Do you only trade us trading hours because that's when the catalysts happen? Or, like, are you off on the weekends?
00:52:31.448 - 00:52:48.184, Speaker C: Always on. Even the weekends used to be now, so less so, but, like, now. So the weekends just, like, literally just, like, do this. They just, like, stayed a straight line and then they liquidate the shorts and then they come down and then liquid the longs and it comes back every weekend. That's what it does.
00:52:48.964 - 00:52:52.484, Speaker A: Interesting. All right, well, let's pull up the results here and see what we got.
