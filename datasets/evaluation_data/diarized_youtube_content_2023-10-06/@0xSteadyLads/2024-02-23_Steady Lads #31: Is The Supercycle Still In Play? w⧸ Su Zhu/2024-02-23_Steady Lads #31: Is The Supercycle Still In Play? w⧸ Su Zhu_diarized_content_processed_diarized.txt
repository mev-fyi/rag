00:00:00.400 - 00:00:29.704, Speaker A: Hey, lads. So we just finished recording with sue. You know, Taika and I wanted to recap the episode that you guys are about to watch. Obviously, it was kind of like a rare experience. I think sue hasn't done any third party podcasts like this in a few years, since last cycle, really. And even though there's people that love him, people that hate him, a lot of mistakes were made last cycle that affected a lot of people's balance sheets. And obviously, you know, it gets quite emotional when that's the case.
00:00:29.704 - 00:00:44.704, Speaker A: We thought that there would be, you know, putting aside, you know, any ethical judgments, just a lot of value. And, you know, at steady labs, we always have this culture of preferring open communication and neutrality. Taiki, how did you feel about the episode?
00:00:45.564 - 00:01:32.964, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I thought he was pretty open about, I guess, his experience with, like, jail and whatnot. But from my point of view, I was more curious to get his viewpoints on where we are in the market cycle, because I think we're all trying to navigate the markets. And given his experience, I do think it's valuable to at least get his viewpoints later in the podcast, I did ask him about what did he learn just going 100 x and then just being liquidated and blowing up, and I think he showed a lot of humility. And, no, I think overall, there's a lot to learn from this episode. So we're just trying to open communications, give him a platform to give his market views, and, yeah, I think the viewers are going to enjoy this one.
00:01:33.384 - 00:02:12.264, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we're at the point in the cycle where things are really starting to froth up, and some of the echoes of last cycle are starting to appear. There are obviously massive mistakes, a lot of lessons learned, and we did manage to get through a lot of the things that could be gleaned and maybe done better the second time around. And sue is really like one of the people that was front row center at a lot of the stuff that was going on, both on the upside and then the downside. And he told us from the beginning all questions were on the table. So we really had an open discussion, and we hope you guys enjoy it and find some value in it.
00:02:12.424 - 00:02:12.720, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:12.752 - 00:02:54.634, Speaker B: And one last thing I'd like to add is, I think near the end, he also talked about some moral hazard in the space where in order for a company in crypto to become big, you kind of have to do certain things because that's how you get there. And it's the things that you do to get there that end up leading to excesses and I guess, holes that end up ending cycles. I think also from a viewer's point of view, it's also important to start thinking about that, where maybe things are still relatively early, but maybe near the end, a tail end of the cycle, it's, you have to ask yourself, okay, like, you know, who's swimming naked if, you know, if this head runs out. So things like that, I think it's very important.
00:02:54.974 - 00:03:44.014, Speaker A: No, I totally agree with that point at the end, like, we have to remember that there's a lot of individual incentives, and sometimes they work collectively for the good. You know, we're all kind of in the same boat going the same place, and sometimes, you know, people are different parts of the pipeline and there can be adversarial effects. We've seen those play out many times, and they will continue to play out until the structure changes. So it's good to reflect on them. So hope you guys enjoyed the episode. Welcome to Steady Labs, everybody. I'm Jordy CIO of Salina Capital.
00:03:44.014 - 00:04:02.974, Speaker A: As usual, we have with us Taiki, the humble farmer and full time researcher at HFA. We have Justin, the CEO of Astaria. We have thiki. I'm seeing double. We have two thickies. Okay, looks like we have a very special guest. So we're very excited today.
00:04:02.974 - 00:04:09.806, Speaker A: Suzu is here. I think this. Is this your 1st, 3rd party podcast, I think, since.
00:04:09.870 - 00:04:10.742, Speaker C: Yes, for sure.
00:04:10.878 - 00:04:11.686, Speaker A: It's been a while.
00:04:11.750 - 00:04:15.314, Speaker C: Yes. Two years almost. Yeah.
00:04:15.774 - 00:05:00.660, Speaker A: We're in this part of the cycle right now where things have obviously been heating up. There is all kinds of random stuff popping off. I'm getting vibes of 2020, 2021, and I think you're one of the few people that really knows and understands the psychology of the markets in this kind of time. I feel I'm a bit too normy to understand some of the things that I'm witnessing every day. So we wanted to bring you on, give our audience a chance to kind of, like, dive into the mind of someone that has really kind of ridden the waves here. So I guess, like, first question is, like, is this like, that sort of part of the bull market? Are we getting into the craziness or how are you seeing it?
00:05:00.812 - 00:05:14.772, Speaker C: Yeah, I think actually it's still very early in the cycle because we're pre having. I think true retail is not here yet. Right. If you look at metrics, if you look at the man on the street, he's not. He's not coming in and buying coins, really. I think that. So from that point of view.
00:05:14.772 - 00:05:44.114, Speaker C: It's almost like late 2019, early 2020, but without the COVID macro. I think that's almost the way to think about it, because stuff was already doing well. Stuff is getting heated. I mean, funding was really high in early 2020, for instance, as well. I think that just that because it's a new cycle, crypto is so much bigger that it just all feels ubiquitous all the time now anyway. But I think if you look at some other similarities, it's like bitcoin is really strong. You've got the ETF inflows, which is a little bit like the grayscale inflows.
00:05:44.114 - 00:06:05.654, Speaker C: So I think it's a really nice time for natives to start positioning themselves for the big moves. I think it's like, definitely the huge moves are ahead of us because you don't really have that big liquidity distribution timeframes yet. Stuff is up. But then can people really take it to the next level? Not necessarily yet.
00:06:06.434 - 00:06:29.206, Speaker A: Yeah. On the retail side, it does look like Coinbase application rankings are agreeing with you. We're not quite there on retail side. So it seems to be that the forex moves that we've had in the bitcoins are mainly driven by institutional flows. Or are we to believe that kind of big guys are coming in?
00:06:29.310 - 00:06:58.604, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's a combo of a reversion to the mean. Right. If you take out the big dumps of 2022, the June dump of 2022, and then the November dump, it's almost like a reversion back to fair value. I feel the current ranges that markets are in, the kind of the, you know, the high 40, low 50 range is actually a natural range for bitcoin to sit in. I think. I think ether as well, you know, three k is a really natural number for it to sit in. Sort of pre having pre big catalyst type stuff.
00:06:58.604 - 00:07:15.322, Speaker C: So I think the. The amount of supply on exchanges is very low, especially on ether right now. So that that's also a big contributing factor. Like, you know, a coin with very low circ supply, you don't even need that much new money to come in. You just need the existing community to all restake and hold hands. Right. And then it can go up just from that.
00:07:15.322 - 00:07:33.186, Speaker C: So I think a lot of that has been happening. That's why you see funding high. It's a little bit scary on one hand, but on the other hand, I think it's like, it's, you know, sometimes the leverage guys win, right? They don't always lose. If they always lose, then the whole thing wouldn't work. So I think here's a period where they've been winning, and I actually think they will generally keep winning.
00:07:33.290 - 00:07:42.796, Speaker D: You mentioned now's the time for crypto native to natives to reposition themselves. Are you fully allocated at this point? Have you been fully allocated, or are you still building that position?
00:07:42.980 - 00:08:20.236, Speaker C: I think a hypothetical portfolio that I would have would definitely be fully allocated. I think that you want to be long ether over bitcoin at these levels, for sure. I think that zero five is an immortal bottom in general, just because of a lot of dynamics, really. But mainly just because ETH is still more deflationary, bitcoin flows are coming. It just doesn't matter that much because either people will be like, if bitcoin goes up and I don't sell my ETH, I wait for a higher price. So I think that that structure really bullish at the same time, you get cycling out. So I saw around zero five levels.
00:08:20.236 - 00:08:51.856, Speaker C: You want to be much more overweight to eat than bitcoin. I think that zero one is more trickier now, because you have seen a ten x on Solana now. And I think the downtime on Solana actually did take people a bit by surprise. I think that, plus, you can't really do a lot of the defi stuff that you can do on EVM. Still on Solana, as great as it is, you can't do a lot of things. Yeah, it's not safe for a lot of the things that you can use ethereum. So I think that there is kind of a return to normalcy.
00:08:51.960 - 00:09:11.454, Speaker A: I mean, I think everyone in the audience is going to be curious. Your thoughts on the ETH versus alt l one. Infamously, you had said that you're abandoning heath, and then you kind of like, you know, rebalanced it. You're like, okay, actually, I'm not gonna just let you guys know. Watch the burn at this point. Like, you know, there's new ones as well.
00:09:11.574 - 00:09:16.766, Speaker C: There's a legendary pasta. Like, sometimes I just see it, like, on the dude, I remember when this.
00:09:16.790 - 00:09:25.874, Speaker D: Came out, and I, like, took this as gospel, and I had to reevaluate my whole thesis around ETH. It was. This was crazy. So you really messed with my mind here.
00:09:26.204 - 00:09:27.492, Speaker A: I remember that day it came out.
00:09:27.508 - 00:09:27.780, Speaker B: I was.
00:09:27.812 - 00:09:32.184, Speaker A: I was short avax, and I just got ripped a new one. I mean, it was so painful.
00:09:32.764 - 00:09:38.700, Speaker B: This is still kind of true, though, right? Like, still on ETH mainnet, you can't really do much other than restake ETH.
00:09:38.812 - 00:10:17.062, Speaker C: It's kind of played out. You can't, you can't do anything on ETH mainnet then restaking. I think that it's only going to get worse actually, because I think that there, there's no need for a plan. The same as bitcoin l one, bitcoin l one. You also are not going to be able to do much soon, eventually, but it won't matter because when the market caps are so big and that store value, people don't really want to upgrade the l one all the time and like risk things. So I think it's just going to be very expensive. And you know, I do think we're going to see a big ETH NFT revival though, because the expensiveness of the chain actually creates more value for the NFTs and the culture on it because you're just doing expensive as hell shit all the time, right? It's like you think about the DNFt cycles in 2021.
00:10:17.062 - 00:10:36.958, Speaker C: It's like, wow, we just burned 10 million gas to together. Like we just burned like, you know, we're all burning our money together. That's awesome. Like so, so there's a kind of, there's already that element, you actually can't compete with that as a low key chain. Like if you're, if you're a say or something or if you're like some, some chains really fast. Like what? There's no costliness. There's no proof of work to the culture.
00:10:36.958 - 00:10:47.762, Speaker C: So I think that's the biggest strength ethereum and bitcoin have, which is that, you know, people mainly hold and then they do really costly things to ball out and show off. So you know, that that's good for.
00:10:47.778 - 00:11:26.354, Speaker A: NFT, proof of paycheck basically. You know, you have to, you have to burn it to, to make it matter. I mean some people would agree. I've been recently looking at the ape chain stuff though where like, you know, ape holders are still remembering how much gas they burnt on that day, that, you know, they just like burnt infinite gas, I think, on the ape launch. So they're not too pleased about their like post gas, uh, money that they got out. Um, I mean thiky, you kind of look a lot about catalysts and I, I remember in 22 it was all about like tradfi, like following equities and like CPI was coming out. What a huge deal.
00:11:26.354 - 00:11:50.136, Speaker A: As an HFT firm now we barely like look at the tradfi like releases anymore. It doesn't seem to matter. Does that mean that we're less institutional? More institutional? I mean you're looking at the ETF flows, what, what do you think is actually relevant right now? Is it retail moving price? Is it macro? It doesn't seem to be macro anymore. I think we're past that.
00:11:50.320 - 00:12:26.884, Speaker C: In my perspective, we definitely saw huge inflows ETF's, which is kind of what I expected on my part after equities broke all time highs. The question remains right now, is this long term sticky allocator capital coming into it, or is this more speculative, like GME retail tradfi traders, like coming into bitcoin. Today's actually like an interesting, like data look at if there's an inflection point, because today's actually the first day, there's negative net flows into these ETF's. So it'll be interesting to see whether we see outflows on like ibit or FPC, or if we just keep getting, you know, constant, steady allocations.
00:12:27.664 - 00:12:55.438, Speaker A: He said it and then he dropped off. He just like dropped the mic. You know, we got a little like a little sticky picture moment there. I mean, sue, my feeling is, reading the market that there's a lot of gambling going on in like some of these coins that don't make sense. Like these, these valuations are clearly like wrong. Like in terms of like a long term, you know, fundamental perspective. And given what you said, that there is not that much retail, like new retail, like the mom and pop kind of shop, people haven't come back.
00:12:55.438 - 00:13:07.282, Speaker A: Does that just mean that the DJ's have like more money to gamble with or, you know, they got their FTX checks back, you know, like they sold for 60, 70. Now they're just putting it back in. Like what's actually happening?
00:13:07.418 - 00:13:42.324, Speaker C: There's always going to be coins that don't make sense from a fundamental perspective. And that's kind of what I meant today with the price leads narrative stuff where at a high enough price, people will come up with a new narrative for it. And then you'd be like, ah, so that's why it's worth so much. The coins that are looking overvalued, they don't really matter because you never know the true Cirque, you never know the true game that's being played. Like, FTV is a meme as a concept in the bull market because of the fact that there's an interesting bifurcation that market makers can do by launching at a high FTV, which is that they don't let anyone buy. Who cares about FTV.
00:13:42.404 - 00:14:09.760, Speaker A: We talk about it quite often, like the FTV versus market cap. I know thiki always thinks about this, positions himself on the low market cap, high FTD coins, because something like world coin is probably like the most effed up example, in my opinion, where this thing is trading at higher than OpenAI. It's like 86 billion today or something. And at the same time, the market cap is something that the DJ's can easily two x if they want to.
00:14:09.872 - 00:14:41.684, Speaker C: Sure. But Sauna himself owns a very high percentage of the coin. The investor base is diamond hand. And they know the playbook, you know, where it becomes like that kind of a coin and where it becomes more like a dfinity, where it's just like high FTV, like lock everyone in the nuke it. Possibly the difference between, let's say like a starcore and a world coin. But I think that generally big projects now, they have an understanding of what their plan is. So I think that it's just executing the plan.
00:14:41.684 - 00:15:06.070, Speaker C: It's become more efficient. I feel it's become more tradition in that like they know how it's going to trade. The market makers are more concerned conservative. So I think that that's why you generally see conservative price action. But it's like kind of logical ish. And then, you know, I mean, that's my feeling from having seen it. I think you see this especially with, with launchpads, right? Where launchpads, they're not really good for the TEDx on launch anymore.
00:15:06.070 - 00:15:28.530, Speaker C: They're more just like, okay, here's almost the exit event. And then after the exit event, you then wait and you buy it or something, right? So, so I think the dynamics there are, are evolving a lot. I think that it's valuation. We're not in the part of the cycle where the FTV is the reason why you can sell it. It's going to be something else, I think.
00:15:28.642 - 00:15:55.824, Speaker B: I have a question, Justin, if you can pull up my screen here, you had this tweet around. We're still early in the bull cycle. And this isn't really a time you want to sell. It's a time to accumulate and combine farming with trading, optimize that 3d portfolio, get agile market beta, and also going against the current market at key pivots. Can you kind of go over what you mean by this? And what do you mean by a 3d portfolio?
00:15:57.284 - 00:16:55.902, Speaker C: I think 3D means that, and Soros talks about this in his books as well. But basically you want to have a base layer of, let's say, your core positions that are going up denominated into whether that's ether or bitcoin. And then you also want to have ways you're then using that capital. So whether it's, you know, you can borrow some against it and then farm with it, or whether you can replicate it in perps and then get dollars. Like one of the things you can do is you can always see at any given time, can you farm more from coins like ether and bitcoin or from stables? Right, because that varies depending on the regime. Like, one of the things we did really well on was like, you know, there was a period where compound farming, right, when it launched about 200% apy on huge size from the double sided farming of Dai. And so we were really big in that to the point that Robert, I think he messaged us and was like, can you please stop or at least not sell it if you farm this? And we're like, okay, we just won't sell it or something like that.
00:16:55.902 - 00:17:18.856, Speaker C: I can't remember what we said, but he couldn't do anything about it because that's the power of Defi, right? But the double sided farming, I think, got the TVL up to 2 billion. So he can't complain either. It ended up going, the coin went up a lot. Yeah, so, so basically, so what we did. But we want to keep a long exposure. So we long eat calls, we long eat perks, long ETH futures. So you keep the exposure while you farm with stables.
00:17:18.856 - 00:17:48.828, Speaker C: That's kind of 3d, right? Because it's like you need to combine derivatives and defi and c five a bit. I think, like always look for spots. Or like, where can you get, like, given that you want to belong, x amount of coins. How do you create that exposure with the most alpha, right, so that right now can be, you know, pendle type plays, if you like some of those. Or it can be like, you know, you can just go raw restaking if you like those. But I think it's an interesting time. I mean, there's also blast, right, which I think actually will probably do really well.
00:17:48.828 - 00:17:55.100, Speaker C: I think they've been really impressive. The blast deb air drop especially. I think it will create a good ecosystem.
00:17:55.212 - 00:17:55.860, Speaker A: They want to sync.
00:17:55.892 - 00:17:56.060, Speaker C: Right?
00:17:56.092 - 00:18:19.308, Speaker A: Like, people love having a sink. I feel like this is a human need just for like closure. Like, okay, I got my coin. Where do I stake it? I mean, you know, I saw this guy, like, I'm not gonna like name names, but I'm in some telegram group and this dude is like tradfi guy. He's like, where do I stake my ondo? I got my ondo. Token, but I don't know where to stake it. How do I get my yield? It's like there's, there's no state.
00:18:19.308 - 00:18:33.844, Speaker A: Like, what do you think staking is? They want to put it somewhere and then feel like, you know, it's in the fridge. Right? Like it's, it's somewhere and it makes sense. Yeah, I did my job and I put it in the safe or something.
00:18:34.184 - 00:18:56.584, Speaker B: If I can chime in earlier, sue, you said that the markets are more efficient. You have to be sharper, and then maybe there's less edge trading, centralized exchange coins. And I think a lot of our audience were playing the liquid markets. What do you think, what types of sectors and verticals do you think will be, you know, obvious in a few years, but looks dumb right now?
00:18:56.924 - 00:19:27.390, Speaker C: AI and crypto is one that's definitely in that category. I think that the problem with web two and AI is that web two companies are doxxed in a certain way. They're beholden to a lot of interest. And so there's going to be a huge explosion of activity. That's AI, but doesn't have to, you know, you know, have to report to somebody. Right. And I think that, that, you know, we're starting to see that now.
00:19:27.390 - 00:20:23.314, Speaker C: I think also just the sheer ability of AI to mobilize lots of people and lots of data. I mean, when we invest in a world coin, it was controversial at the time. I don't you guys remember the whole meta then, but world coin was, it was going to scan your eyeballs, right? And then people all said, well, this is against crypto ethos because your eyeballs are holy. Never mind that you use your face to unlock your phone every day, but that was the ethos. And then they also said, well, how is he going to store the data? What we've seen now is that actually it's all about money. It's all about how much can you make from your data, how much can you make from your identity. So there's projects that are like proof of gamer, proof of human, proof of this, that I think that stuff in this range, I think step in actually showed the power of cryptonomics, crypto tokenomics, to mobilize lots of people really quickly.
00:20:23.314 - 00:20:48.572, Speaker C: I think we're going to see stuff like that a lot the cycle, because crypto has been normalized very heavily now in society. I think that even governments, that they'll have programs where it's like, I give you a token if you work out. I give you this if you work out. So the idea of doing something to earn, and then we add an AI component to it as well. I think it's going to be, yeah, pretty big stuff that happens there. It's also the nice thing there is that I think the ambition level of teams is getting higher. Right.
00:20:48.572 - 00:21:03.124, Speaker C: You think about product, the world coin, that couldn't have happened five years ago because there's no infra now. You know, they're the infra is there? And moreover, the societal acceptance is there. That, of course, if I scan my eyeball, you're going to give me money like that. That's just natural. How much are you going to give me?
00:21:03.244 - 00:21:05.344, Speaker A: Justin did it. How much did you get, Justin?
00:21:06.324 - 00:21:16.294, Speaker D: I'm still trying to figure out how to claim sue, so if you know how, let me know. I've tried a VPN, I've tried tunneling into someone's home network in Canada. I just can't get access.
00:21:16.954 - 00:21:23.914, Speaker C: I remember when I heard about world coin, I was so bullish that I sent it to everyone I knew, and they're all like, this is against crypto ethos, man.
00:21:23.954 - 00:21:24.538, Speaker A: You can't scan me.
00:21:24.546 - 00:21:45.628, Speaker C: Was I eyeballs? And then. And then they had this idea of that time of the orb runners where people will, like, they thought, you will. You will buy the. You will buy the orb, right? And then you will scan eyeballs and you earn like a split. So then, you know, it's kind of like a. It's a bit like a step in model, actually there, too, because you have to buy it, and then you're, like, locked into it. They ended up doing a bit of a different model.
00:21:45.628 - 00:22:18.710, Speaker C: But I just thought that people, you know, people want Ubi. People want something for free. There is very little that you can say to a person about the value of his data that he won't be able to sell to you for $10. Right. I mean, I think the Onlyfans generation proves this really well, where people are like, you know, people are selling nudes for. For literally, like, tens of dollars in many cases. Right? So I think that in that sense, world coin is actually more democratic and more egalitarian.
00:22:18.782 - 00:22:23.934, Speaker D: Also, there's the thinking in crypto, like, this facial recognition data is not already out there.
00:22:23.974 - 00:22:24.174, Speaker C: Right?
00:22:24.214 - 00:22:34.322, Speaker D: Like, to your point, we use our iPhone boarding with planes. You can do it with facial recognition. Now, when you enter via global entry or immigrate back to the US, they scan you. So it's sort of silly.
00:22:34.478 - 00:22:59.034, Speaker C: Exactly, exactly. And so now that there's that acceptance and that that AI itself is in that acceptance wave, where it's like, okay, if I'm gonna get cool stuff because we're all using AI now, then sign me up. Just make sure I'm early so I get the most airdrops I can. That's the mentality now. So that opens up a huge playing ground for projects where before, you know, it was more. It was more Ted Kaczynski ish. It was more like, I don't.
00:22:59.034 - 00:23:23.734, Speaker C: Because there was a way where people like, how do I get people off my, you know, how do I get big companies off my phone? How do I get, you know, this kind of stuff? And that's just in my view, I think it's been fully rejected because people, uh, each generation gets more and more Internet native. They're not used to times where they've ever had any privacy. They're not used to times when they've ever had any, you know, not always online. So it's impossible to. To take it back, I think, at this point.
00:23:23.894 - 00:23:37.448, Speaker D: Let me ask you this. You've mentioned the word cycle a lot on this show so far in the last half hour. What are your thoughts on cycle theory? I mean, do you believe in cycles? Is it because of the having, is it something else going on? Where does macro play a role?
00:23:37.616 - 00:23:56.384, Speaker C: Cycles definitely exist. I think part of it is that projects get really overheated, and then expectations and reality that there's a gap. Once there's. That gap is too large. I think that there needs to be a reset. Typically. I think that the levels of reset are usually higher and higher on good coins.
00:23:56.384 - 00:24:22.002, Speaker C: And then for ones with bad teams, then they'll just use that as an excuse to not work anymore. Right? So that's why up to now, the only coin to have ever outperformed bitcoin across two cycles is dogecoin. There's no other coin out of, like 30,000 coins that has ever outperformed its previous high versus bitcoin. It's actually shocking to think about. It's actually shocking to think about. When you really think about it. I mean, some people think ether, but then you think about, like, ether, it actually hit 0.13
00:24:22.002 - 00:24:59.078, Speaker C: at some point in, like, May 2017 off Ethereum, you know, Ethereum alliance and bitcoin scaling war stuff. So the next cycle it only hit 0.089 or something, right? So by that logic, you need to sell your BTC at zero seven because it may not make a higher high versus the previous cycle. From that point of view, as scary as that may sound to ETH bulls, is that what you believe I'm reserving judgment on it. I think I need to see how it develops. I think that EBDC is in an eternal range, 0.05 to 0.075.
00:24:59.078 - 00:25:16.150, Speaker C: So I think 0.07, you'll see a lot of whales sell. So then it's a question of is there enough fundamentals to push it through? Not, I think that 0.05 they buy. It's just free money for them. You see it on bits all the time. They're just like, okay, it's 105, they just click it and then they buy everyone's ETH versus bitcoin.
00:25:16.150 - 00:25:38.938, Speaker C: And then, oh, seven, okay, press the button to sell it back to you. You know, so. So it's not going anywhere. It's like Lundar's tweet said that as well, right? It's like zero, six, nine is the fair value. We're just gonna bounce back and forth around it. Those are kind of the good lessons to learn from each cycle, I think. And that's why market wants new new coins, it wants new narratives.
00:25:38.938 - 00:25:43.666, Speaker C: It stuff where they don't know where the back holders are and they don't have to care. Right.
00:25:43.730 - 00:26:03.298, Speaker B: So like one thing that surprised me is that, I mean, this cycle looks a lot similar to last cycle where people can't use ETH mainnet, so they just go to alto ones and they just bid the native token. Do you think that like this, what do you think this cycle looks like? If you think that we're in the early stages of mobile market, are we just going to pump all the alto ones? Maybe some AI coins?
00:26:03.466 - 00:26:35.396, Speaker C: I think multi vm stuff. I think arbitrum optimism, I mean, arbitrary is kind of one for a lot of defi perp stuff. I think that optimism has its own stuff base. I think that EVM, honestly, not much of the values to be captured by ETH from like multi vm type activity. ETH is just the new bitcoin basically, right? It's like ETH and bitcoin are both bitcoin. So the ogs swap between them interchangeably. It doesn't matter, it's the same.
00:26:35.396 - 00:27:08.696, Speaker C: So that, that's the way that I think that the market trades very much so. Especially because they're going to be both the coins with Ethereum ETF's, right. So it's going to be a little bit like Coke and PEPC type thing. Especially because now bitcoin has ordinals as well. So it's really very, very similar. If you really zoom out, you got l two activity. You've got ordinals, and then you've got holders who like to hold mainly, and then they're go up to the burn in the ETH case, and then in the bitcoin case, they drove off to the supply that's logged, they drip out to the halving.
00:27:08.696 - 00:27:16.644, Speaker C: So there's a lot of holding while jerky off. Right in both, for sure. Which is good, by the way. It's good. It's bullish.
00:27:17.264 - 00:27:45.404, Speaker D: A few episodes ago, Sue Jordy said that he thinks ETH BTC could hit all time highs, or at least appreciate substantially this year, partially due to the ETF, and then just the lack of supply of ETH on exchanges. You mentioned the fair value is probably like 0.07 and will range somewhere around 050708. Do you think what Jordy is saying is in the cards for like a temporary bubble, or do you think ETH BTC is. It's sort of over. All of the edge with ETH is gone.
00:27:46.344 - 00:28:17.518, Speaker C: I think if you asked me at a different time, I would have said it's more possible. But now I think there is a lot of competition, and new users generally go to Solana or they go to other chains. So I think that the value accrual back. I mean, I think in general, ETH is burning a lot less than people thought it would burn. Right. I think if I looked at, I mean, bankless is a bit ETH hard, but I think their estimate, I think we're about at 10% of that estimate. I think that it's not inflationary, but it's not deflationary.
00:28:17.518 - 00:28:40.096, Speaker C: It's like a fixed supply coin, I think, is what it is. So the net, so the narrative on that is not like, we're going to burn all the ETH. You got to hold the final ETH, and the final ETH is worth infinite kind of thing. I think we're much more in, like, you know, we're roughly gonna burn. What we emit weakens the narrative a bit. I do think that because the mainstream still views ETH as smart contract platform, and then when they try to use it, they're like, I'm not gonna use that. I'm gonna use something else.
00:28:40.096 - 00:29:16.776, Speaker C: That that does naturally hurt its prestige. Also, I think that ETH people cannot go to bitcoin and say, no one, like, how are you gonna solve fees? Right? Because remember, that was a huge part of the ETH narrative, which is that bitcoin is gonna not be able to have any fees on it. And now it's like, ridiculous amount of fees on it actually from BRC 20 activity. So that's another kind of card that they don't get to play in the mainstream media by saying bitcoin has this problem. So I think the fighting of bitcoin is kind of gone now. Right? You don't get the POW fud as used to do either because I think people just. It's kind of moved on from that.
00:29:16.776 - 00:29:25.864, Speaker C: ESG has kind of hit its top as well. So I think bitcoin's really strong, basically. So you're not going to get that bitcoin to ether rotation that you used to get.
00:29:25.984 - 00:29:33.952, Speaker A: You might not get a rotation, but you could just get like, fresh, like ETH money without bitcoin. Like, it doesn't have to be crypto native. It could just be like, you could.
00:29:34.008 - 00:29:36.456, Speaker C: You need Larry Fing to really hit the ballpark, I think.
00:29:36.480 - 00:29:36.784, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:36.864 - 00:29:58.136, Speaker C: Where he's like, you know, I have bitcoin, any three ECF, but I'm like, you got to sell your bitcoin for ether. Because I do think it does have to be. It does have to be a rhetoric of negation because if it's purely, you know, ETH is great, but because also great, then they'd be like, okay, so what are the market caps? I'm gonna buy the market cap weighted. Thank you. You know, and it's never gonna pump from that. So. So you need the, you need there to be like.
00:29:58.136 - 00:30:14.656, Speaker C: And that's what Salana did really well, right? We're just like, it's obviously very toxic Swanna man live type culture at that time. But it's, it's still, it's still. It does work for. It does work because people are like, shit. Like, I'm owning the wrong smart contract platform. I gotta own the right one. I'm owning BlackBerry.
00:30:14.656 - 00:30:23.404, Speaker C: But that's why that time, so money got so much because you always would make the BlackBerry analogies, like, eat this BlackBerry, and if you own BlackBerry, you're screwed out.
00:30:23.904 - 00:30:51.324, Speaker A: Let's talk about Dogecoin a little bit because we mentioned it briefly and that's something that, you know, I remember we've, we've had like, you know, famous debates about dogecoin. Um, is, you know, I've always been the dogecoin bear, I guess. Um, it hasn't done anything this cycle. It's like the, you know, the meme with, like, the guy, like, poking with a stick. Like, come on, do something. It's like, not done anything is the only way it does something. It's like, is it an Elon coin?
00:30:51.364 - 00:30:51.540, Speaker C: Now.
00:30:51.572 - 00:30:54.340, Speaker A: And it just needs Elon to really get involved or.
00:30:54.492 - 00:31:21.008, Speaker C: Yeah, I think actually Elon. Yeah, I mean, I talked to some guys in the doge community about this a bit, and they actually think, like, Elon almost got too involved. So it became Elon because the problem with that too high of an involvement is that then when he stops, then you're like, well, then instead, because he always hasn't done anything right. So, so I think that that's been a problem for Doge because he's, he's such a high profile figure that he kind of, kind of made that his identity.
00:31:21.136 - 00:31:31.912, Speaker A: I remember, I remember, like, you were, you were kind of, like, expecting more from doge at this point. Have you kind of abandoned doge or like, or are you not abandoning doge?
00:31:32.048 - 00:31:52.816, Speaker C: I think that Shiba inu. Shiba inu did very, very well. A cycle off. Like, you know, essentially they had a stealth phase of, like, defi farming bone kind of stuff. And then I was actually shield Shiba Inu at like, a really, really low market cap. And I didn't buy it. It would have been like a, like a billion dollar trade from the guy who showed it to me.
00:31:52.816 - 00:32:22.090, Speaker C: But I watched it for a bit then, and then I just thought there could never be another dog coin because, like, you know, you only need one dog coin, and then you just come up with, like, infinite dogecoins. So I do think that does hurt doge prestige because now people are like, you know, there's not, in fact, this one dogecoin. And then I'm like, of course not, because bitcoin thought the same thing. And then they were wrong. Everyone's always ETH people thought the same thing, and they're also wrong. They're always wrong because you can always make a new coin, right? That that's the power of human ingenuity. And it's a rentier society mentality as well.
00:32:22.090 - 00:32:48.960, Speaker C: Let's say you buy the first dog coin and you're like, this will be the only dog coin that ever exists. Everyone that likes dogs will have to pay rent to me. They will buy my dogs, right? And then that becomes very natural to think. And then you look around and be like, no, I'm going to buy a lower priced one. I remember there's a guy who had a spreadsheet of all the dog coins that he bought during, like, the beginning of dog coin. Uh, like, there's a dog coin wave, right? And he's like, this one ran away in rug. This one ran away.
00:32:48.960 - 00:32:56.212, Speaker C: This went up 100 x this one up 100 x. Okay. This one up 30. But it's just hilarious. On BSC, I'm like different chains.
00:32:56.388 - 00:33:15.356, Speaker D: I'm not, but I. Sue's comment on doge is the only coin to put in new highs against BTC. Two cycles running is very fascinating. I don't own any doge now. Maybe I should after hearing that. But sue, on a similar note to Doge because I think they're sort of the one in the same Cardano. What are your thoughts there? Same as, as doge, basically.
00:33:15.356 - 00:33:19.156, Speaker D: I mean, I guess Cardano probably hasn't put in another high against BTC.
00:33:19.300 - 00:33:47.750, Speaker C: Cardano, I think, didn't reach a high versus previous cycle, but it got close ish. Actually, it was one of the closest ones. But I do feel that Cardano, I mean, it's kind of been a long time. I mean, we've been told about these peer reviews and these defi projects for a long time and they're not really here. Yeah. So I just don't know if it's just too late, I think. I mean, if you look at eos, right, they almost like, front ran it because they were like, you know, we could try to build it, but let's just, let's just not.
00:33:47.750 - 00:33:50.142, Speaker C: And then, and then there's no point.
00:33:50.278 - 00:33:51.634, Speaker D: Building it is bearish.
00:33:52.054 - 00:33:58.846, Speaker C: So that's what I think Cardano is in. So I think it's going to be harder to get that narrative because there were people who bought it thinking that they were going to actually build it.
00:33:58.950 - 00:34:34.671, Speaker A: Talk about, like, getting money and not building. Another one that we used to talk about was the NFT situation because back then it was very new. And you have this situation where you get all the money upfront and just for a picture, you know, and then, like, some people are like, okay, like, why should I work now? Like, I've already been paid. I mean, some people have managed to build it out, like pudgies, I guess, is the one, ether rocks, which is like the least effort stuff still is, like doing really well. I think, like, GCR is like super bullish on, on the rocks at this point. Like the whole NFT phase. Like, is.
00:34:34.671 - 00:34:40.415, Speaker A: Is there like a proof of work that is there? Or is it just, you know, is it like a meme coin?
00:34:40.519 - 00:35:14.946, Speaker C: I mean, if you look at NFT grail culture, it's actually doing decent, right? I think autoglyphs, a bunch just sold for like 12 million. I think that, you know, punks have reclaimed the number one. You know, it's low hype, but it's also it's sort of value ish. I think. I think that NFTs, yeah, it's like the debate between utility and, like, community versus, like, just, it's like cool and rich people on chain own it. I think that that's the. I mean, ether rocks are bullish because rich people own them and then they are going to be like, this is the thing that rich people own.
00:35:14.946 - 00:35:16.282, Speaker C: It's a shelling point, right?
00:35:16.338 - 00:35:32.746, Speaker A: I mean, the old stuff, I guess we kind of agree, like, yeah, the old stuff is like museum relics, right? Like, it has this, like, interesting. But, like, imagine a new NFT collection would come out. What would it take for that to, like, succeed? Like, if, you know, 2024, someone's launching an NFT collection?
00:35:32.930 - 00:35:55.902, Speaker C: That's a really tough question, honestly, because, I mean, I haven't been that impressed with the new NFTs that have come out. You know, I haven't followed that closely. But, you know, there's like, knock amigos. There was a few others that I looked at a bit. I mean, I actually still like Remelio and milady a lot. I think that if you look at it, you know, you're not depending on the founder to pump it. You're not depending on a team to pump it.
00:35:55.902 - 00:36:46.948, Speaker C: That's always bullish, in my opinion, for NFTs, because if you were depending on that, they, people now remember that it doesn't always work and the team could just keep the money, right? Like, I think the Azuki elemental launch was kind of that big jolts in people's psyche where they were like, wait, they just told me the same picture again. But I still think Suzuki is a great community, actually. But I just think that people still use those pfps. But I do think that there is actually a fatigue with the fact that the team can make more content sometimes. And you said in the traditional art world, too, where art appreciates after the artist dies. So, milady, I actually think, you know, it's the only NFT that Elon's ever tweeted. And, you know, Romelios, I feel like, are going to take over CT because they're just the funniest.
00:36:46.948 - 00:37:07.936, Speaker C: So I think that. I think that culture is really important. You know, you can't fake culture. I think bored apes, you know, even though they did like stuff where they give celebrities in the beginning they had good culture, you know, they had a good thing. But NCO always has a problem was that it starts with good culture and, like, good vibes, and then at the top it becomes cringe from the fact that it's so expensive.
00:37:08.040 - 00:37:36.094, Speaker B: So I have a more personal question, I guess. And of course, in the last cycle, you ran up your fund, 100 x thousand x. And then there's the infamous three AC candle in June 2022. And now you're back. You're trying to run it back again. What were some life lessons learned from, I guess, that entire the past couple of years? And, you know, like, can you share some wisdom on, like, how you plan to handle things better this time?
00:37:36.214 - 00:38:13.914, Speaker C: The most important is, like, remember what got you there and make sure you keep doing the things that got you there as opposed to the story about yourself that you hear other people tell. Because I think that that's at its core one of the, one of the issues, which is that, you know, we were very good at meeting people, synthesizing information, learning from others. You have to always stay hungry and always keep learning. I think kicking, you know, that, that energy is really important. I think also, like, I think both SPF and myself, we had this mentality because we never failed much before. Like, we both started companies very young and just everything you touch makes money. You don't think as much about, like, failure.
00:38:13.914 - 00:38:54.854, Speaker C: And I remember this one time I was talking to CZ and he was like saying, you know, to, I've had five companies fail before I started binance. Like, you know, it's not that easy for most people to just like, like press button and then make money, right? Because he, I think he was trying to nudge me at that time, saying, you're a little bit out of touch. Like, normal people actually can't just press touch everything and make money. So I think, like, being, you know, understanding that, like, making money actually is hard for a lot of people. And also that when you are lucky, you recognize that when you have been lucky, right? And also when you are good, you recognize why you were good, not, not just this and not just that. So I think knowing yourself really well, being really self aware is super important. I think.
00:38:54.854 - 00:39:37.434, Speaker C: I think also just like from a, like a karma perspective too, like, being really good to people who are good to you. You know, that, that, you know, what I've seen last year is, like, everyone that I was really good to, like, you know, during that period, they were good to me, like, after. And it was something where, like, I actually wish I had been good to even more people. You know, there were times when we were, like, randomly very generous, but other times when we were a bit more like, you know, sharkish, we cried out the round, get the best allocation, you know, do all this kind of stuff. And I think that at the time, it feels really wise, but then afterward, you know, and you can do it because you're a big shot. Right. But, you know, when we think about it, when I think about it now, it's like, you know, there was, there was definitely a more wise way to do some of those deals.
00:39:37.434 - 00:39:51.352, Speaker C: There was more wise way to do some of those things. So I think. I think that this time, like, definitely more mellow, definitely not trying to do, like, a three ac 2.0 per se, because I think that also the market is different as well.
00:39:51.448 - 00:40:13.306, Speaker D: And let me ask you this, sue. It got to a point where, and it might even still be the case, but you could tweet out something and it would move our small markets. Right. What does that do to your psyche? I mean, we have new people coming up in the space that have that same phenomenon around them. Can you talk about that a little bit where you're sort of controlling your own destiny and you can control the market?
00:40:13.490 - 00:40:14.854, Speaker A: The main character?
00:40:15.154 - 00:40:17.090, Speaker D: Yeah, I think there's.
00:40:17.122 - 00:40:46.764, Speaker C: Yeah, there's two broad advice I would give. I think one is that when you become the main character, you're gonna get a lot more pressure and a lot more hate regardless of what you do, actually. And one of the reasons for that is just because you're the main character. So people are bored. They can only, you know, you're the center topic. And so what I've actually realized is that, like, my perception of hate is very different than what other people might realize. Because, like, in late 2021, early 2022, like, you would assume it's universal love, but it's not actually.
00:40:46.764 - 00:41:07.836, Speaker C: Like, everyone was mad all the time for, like, us dumping on them. Like, we, like, that was the universal three arrows meme. It was like, three arrows dumb sun followers. It's dumping. It's dumping. And so I do think that, like, if you try to please everyone as the main character, not going to be possible. And one of the reasons for that, on a more deep level is the level of inequality in society that we have today.
00:41:07.836 - 00:41:37.740, Speaker C: Right. I think in the US now, the top 1% has now more money than the bottom 50% with those trends. Basically, if you're going to be a main character, you're just going to have to take the heat that comes with that. There's no other way around it. Every decision you make can get scrutinized. I think that with that said, the true wisdom is, like, just if you think, like, top is in or you think that, you know, there's no way to solve that problem. You just eject.
00:41:37.740 - 00:41:46.676, Speaker C: I think that that's what DJ Spartan and GCR learned really well, because they realized that you actually, you can't. The only way to win is not play. Yeah.
00:41:46.700 - 00:41:58.044, Speaker D: On that note, let me ask you this. I mean, this is a simple question. It may sound silly, but I think it's important. It's like, why are you not retired right now? Why didn't you leave crypto? What. What caused you to keep building in this space? Why are you still here?
00:41:59.344 - 00:42:48.642, Speaker C: I think I realized that I really like the space. I also like the challenge. I think that crypto is super interesting. And I also think that there's, like, when the flex stuff first came out, the way that story kind of came about is like, I was hanging out with Mark Lamb in Dubai a bit, and his company had a blown up of, basically it had gone insolvent because a trader on the platform had a manual margin agreement that when it came to collected, the margin wasn't there. The market gapped through on bitcoin, cash, on ether, and so he had that platform, and then it was right after FTX collapsed. And then before that, I was more thinking just like, retire, but. But then after collapse.
00:42:48.642 - 00:43:35.742, Speaker C: And I talked to Mark, you know, then we said, why don't we, you know, why don't we think about how we can reboot, you know, something here? So now we had the GTX deck leak, right, which was. Which was, I think, early Jan. And then Mark put out a tweet where it's like, you know, any new platformer, will you still use the flex token? And then I just saw, like, people pinging us being like, wait, I buy this flex token, and Coinflex is insolvent. So people were, like, depositing money to an insolvent exchange to buy the coin. And it was just like, I think the coin went from, like one or two cent to, like, fifty cents and then to a dollar and then $3. And then I was seeing a Kyle, like, wow. Like, you know, even though we thought there's a lot of hate, actually, there's, like, a lot of people who want to, like, you know, you know, bet on us again.
00:43:35.742 - 00:44:02.902, Speaker C: And I think that was really touching for me, actually, because it was at a time where it's like, right after I came back, right. And so, you know, it was a tough journey for, I think, flex and then Oxford, because first it went one cent to eight cents, now back to $0.01. But I think that. And then there was the prison dump, obviously, as well, to half a cent. But, you know, like, through that whole experience, I'm like, you know, crypto school, you get to find your friends. You get to find a lot of, like, a lot of fun stories. It's exciting.
00:44:02.902 - 00:44:42.492, Speaker C: I think, also, ideas wise, I do think that there is a, like, I have somewhat of a responsibility to share some of my knowledge back because, you know, there's mainstream media accounts at SPF, there's mainstream media accounts of stuff that happened, and obviously, like, you know, Dokon is going to be a cent. C cz is not tweeting anymore. SPF is up. So I actually think I will write a book one day about crypto, but I think it's still too early because I think it's too fresh. I think usually these things take two, three years. But I feel like, like, you know, I do fast myself. A bit of a historian, so I want to be able to just be in the space and really kind of be able to think about that history.
00:44:42.668 - 00:44:52.028, Speaker A: Is there, like, any, like, big Netflix kind of? Like, there was a lot of talk back when Luna was happening that there was going to be some. Some Netflix documentaries and stuff about it.
00:44:52.076 - 00:45:09.270, Speaker C: You know, the problem is that western media and, you know, more broadly, they need a narrative. If they don't know what it is, they have to make it up. So here, they're just too confused what the narrative is. You know, they're like, what is the story arc, you think about social network, right? The one based on Zuckerberg. They make him look like a. Basically. Like an.
00:45:09.270 - 00:45:33.714, Speaker C: Like an incel. But obviously, that's not actually. That's not actually who he is. But they just need a story, right? Like, they need it because. Because the iq. The average iqs drop so low that they don't think they can make a movie just about the actual thing, that they have to make it so that you, like, understand it, right? I mean, a great example of this was when I read Game of Thrones books, and then I saw the show. Like, there are many characters that the writer says, this character is ugly as hell.
00:45:33.714 - 00:45:37.682, Speaker C: And then in the show, it's like, this guy is, like, hot, right? And it's like. Because, like, you wouldn't understand.
00:45:37.818 - 00:45:48.490, Speaker A: Side question, by the way, do you think, like, Zuckerberg is. Is he. Is he happy to be portrayed as an insult? He's doing, like, an SPF where he's like, oh, let me get this, like, crazy hair and do this, like, yeah, stupid shit.
00:45:48.522 - 00:45:48.690, Speaker C: So.
00:45:48.722 - 00:46:14.406, Speaker A: So people kind of, like. Because I, from what I understand, I have met somebody who claimed that they were like a Zuckerberg sugar baby. I don't know if it's true, but I know pauly is pretty big in San Francisco. But I have a feeling, given this guy's BJJ and stuff, maybe Justin can back me up here. But the guy who kind of looks like he's an incel, sometimes he surprises you. Sometimes he's got some stuff up his sleeve.
00:46:14.550 - 00:46:22.254, Speaker D: He's protecting his brand. That's my theory. Right? He knows what sells. He knows what sells the stock, but he's. He's no incel. Let's be real.
00:46:22.674 - 00:46:28.898, Speaker C: Zuckerberg's on a great PR arc, I feel, because he's got, you know, he's buffed up a bit. He's got the BJJ stuff.
00:46:28.946 - 00:46:30.890, Speaker A: The stock is looking healthier, too.
00:46:31.082 - 00:46:33.054, Speaker C: Stock is looking great. Yeah.
00:46:33.514 - 00:46:44.174, Speaker D: As I say, let me transition. I have questions, because I've been curious about this, too, about prison. It's something you've been open about. How many days or months did you end up serving, Sue?
00:46:44.584 - 00:46:46.672, Speaker C: I served about 60 days, so.
00:46:46.808 - 00:47:04.472, Speaker D: Okay, so what. What do you think? I mean, obviously, it's very different. SPF's in American prison. He's in jail, I should say, in a notoriously terrible jail. He's looking at ten years, 20 years, who knows, right? Is this guy just. He's in hell right now? I assume that's just a totally different ballgame you can't relate to.
00:47:04.608 - 00:47:32.374, Speaker C: I think it's. I think, honestly, it's what he makes of it. Right. Because american jail has its advantages, too, from what I've heard. I mean, it's got more freedoms in the sense of, like, there's more information flow where I think, bourgeois, more isolated information. You're kind of just really on the retreat, I think, in the US, you know, he could write a book. He could start putting out statements like, Ross Albright has a great presence online, you know, and he's still really popular.
00:47:32.374 - 00:47:51.260, Speaker C: You know, people can study it in prison, too. Like, even in Singapore, you know, people get their law degree, they get their bachelor's. They do stuff. They can do work inside the prison. Like, the other cool thing is that the. The people who, like, serve you the food, they, like, help run the yard, whatever. They'll all be inmates, typically.
00:47:51.260 - 00:48:29.192, Speaker C: So they'll be like, ones who are there longer. So that's cool because there's a lot more empathy, basically, in the system where it's like, you know, inmates. Inmate is always going to be nicer than, like, officer to inmate, right? So actually, in a lot of situations, it's actually like, I mean, I wouldn't call it as, like, european, as, like, the full, like, open prison model of, like, Sweden, but it's definitely, like, you know, they want for small interactions to be, like, inmate to inmate as opposed to, like, officer to inmate. So I think in the US, too, like, I saw the interview with SPF and his, or the one with his soulmate and Tiffany Bong. You know, it's actually roughly similar to my experience. Like, you know, you bond with your soulmates, you. They roughly understand your story.
00:48:29.192 - 00:48:39.334, Speaker C: There's a lot of empathy. You learn a lot about people. I think he'll be all right, honestly, I think. I think that, you know, I've known SDF since late 2018.
00:48:39.454 - 00:48:40.114, Speaker B: He.
00:48:40.574 - 00:49:14.626, Speaker C: He has gone through different phases of who he is. He's actually incredibly generous and sometimes incredibly, you know, aggressive in others. I think that he. I think he will be better for the experience as well, actually. I think that. I mean, now that the FTX estate is, like, whole as well, I do wonder sometimes, you know, is his argument that it was a liquidity crunch actually true? Right? Because, you know, FTT, yeah, it's worth zero if you shut down the exchange, but what if you don't shut it down, right? And FTX equity was worth 30 billion. You know, why couldn't he just give equity to token holders? So I.
00:49:14.626 - 00:49:26.890, Speaker C: So I do think that, you know, he definitely crossed a ton of lines, but I think just from a. From a, like, operational perspective, you know, maybe he can work on that after he's been sentenced.
00:49:26.922 - 00:50:07.540, Speaker A: And then, I mean, like, you've gone through, like, you, you know, massive p and l swings. And, like, for me, I mean, you always seem stoic despite, you know, insane market moves. And I'm sure, like, you were having, like, nine figure p and l swings some of those times. And for me, like, I can. I can stomach, you know, increasingly, like, more p and l swings. But still, like, once it gets into the millions, you know, I'm feeling kind of, like, nauseous, like I'm not feeling good. And I kind of try to extrapolate that to, you know, I know it's a lot like a video game at some point, you know, like, swinging 50 million, 100 million, 500 million.
00:50:07.540 - 00:50:31.108, Speaker A: It sort of just feels, like, surreal because you're not tying it to, like, you know, what you can buy. Like, at that point, it's just, like, it's just numbers. But, like, comparing that to prison, I feel like I would prefer, like, I could do, like, a good, like, six months in prison instead of, like, you know, the feeling I get when I swing? Like, you know, a shit ton of p and l. It just feels worse. Were you, like, okay, like, I've been through worse.
00:50:31.236 - 00:50:47.540, Speaker C: Definitely true. Definitely true. Like, I think that, like, honestly, once you enter prison, there's no fear, there's no anxiety because your schedule is so clean. Like, you're. You sleep at 930, the light goes off. You wake up, and the light goes on. Like, it's really, really different.
00:50:47.540 - 00:51:00.090, Speaker C: Like, you. You have no information load also. So you're, like, here outside. If you have a big position on, you're checking the price all day. You're checking the price when you wake up, you check it. When you go to the bathroom, you check it in the shower. You know, you check it everywhere.
00:51:00.090 - 00:51:23.890, Speaker C: Uh, you're messaging your friends. What's your view now? You're going on trading view. You're putting in, and, like, it's nonstop cycling, cycling between apps, right? And the switch time between apps is absurd as well. You're switching every 15 seconds. So you're just in this non stop cycle. So you would assume that you get really anxious and fearful in prison, but it's the total opposite because you just reversion to, like, the natural state of man where. Where it's just like, you're actually just, like, sitting there.
00:51:23.890 - 00:51:38.906, Speaker C: You notice, like, your own hands. You notice, like, a lot of stuff, like, the texture of the wall. You notice all this. You're like, like, I don't think I've ever felt as clear minded as inside. And, like, once you get out, actually, I'm already back. I'm already back in the haze again. Because you're taking cold showers too, which I highly recommend.
00:51:38.906 - 00:52:00.432, Speaker C: Cold shower is incredibly good for the mind. Now I'm back to, like, warm showers. And it's like, you know, I tried to do a cold. I was like, comfort is better. You do that. But actually everything you think is a comfort is because you got used to it. But if you just got the so called discomfort, it would not feel like a discomfort after, like, three days, you know, because we're actually literally evolved to live in the jungle.
00:52:00.432 - 00:52:09.356, Speaker C: Like, we're evolved to live, like, to sleep on, like, fig, like, fig leaves. So there's no actual need for the comfort that you think you need. Like, it's not a real thing.
00:52:09.520 - 00:52:23.584, Speaker D: The distinction here, sue, like, for our american listeners, is probably, like, I assume safety is not a secure, is not a concern in a Singapore prison, like, it's very much law and order based where people are getting jumped. You're not worried about that?
00:52:24.044 - 00:53:09.082, Speaker C: It's super safe in saber prison. I think even in the US, honestly, it's quite overblown. Like, I watched the SPF so many interview, he's like, you know, there's none of that dropping soap soap that was maybe in the nineties, but, like, you know, now we're quite civilized. And I actually think that's probably true in the US. I think it's just because prison media, prison movies that they just like the, I mean, I think it's actually like a, it's fun and it may be like, it may be a playing out of like a story in a story. Right? So, but you look at even prison break, I mean, prison break was reasonably realistic in terms of the way that the prison was the design. I think they modeled it after real prison, but it's still like, you know, it's just like an action, it's like an action place.
00:53:09.082 - 00:53:28.304, Speaker C: Whereas if you really understand prison, you're in the cell a lot of the time, but you're just reading. So, like, if anyone ever made a real prison documentary or like a real prison show, it'd just be like tons of sitting around talking about stuff, reading. You go to play some basketball, come back, eat some food. You know what I mean? Like, it's a very, very, it's incredibly slow paced.
00:53:28.434 - 00:54:06.594, Speaker A: Um, I mean, just to wrap up that chapter, obviously, you know, you guys didn't have, you know, retail money. It's not like, like, you know, FTX type situation there. There were obviously some creditors which, you know, had holes in their balance sheet. I guess, like Luna kind of started that situation where people thought they had certain money, either that they fell or dollars, and then ended up that they didn't. And that sort of like filtered through to the entire market and, you know, including you guys, and then kind of wipe through and there's stuff getting worked out now. So FTX is kind of clearing up. Celsius is whatever those things are finalizing.
00:54:06.594 - 00:54:49.414, Speaker A: I guess the three Ac creditors are going to get at least something. I don't think it's going to be as high as some of the other ones. Are you looking forward to that wrapping up? Obviously, there's still a lot of people that are associating three arrows with the collapse of the entire market, even though, you know, part of, part of that, that whole crash. And there are still kind of people that maybe, like, looked at you specifically as like the super cycle that kind of gave him conviction, obviously, like, everybody should have, you know, made their own opinions and, like, not just being like, okay, I'm gonna go long. Because, like somebody else said, like, how do you, how do you see, like, the whole, you know, post blow up, not landscape.
00:54:49.534 - 00:55:08.532, Speaker C: I mean, I think from a. A personal perspective, I think our creditors will do pretty well off the portfolio. I mean, did they sell 95% market share? World coin is at IFTB. I don't know how much they'll get to ultimately realize that at. Or how long that'll take. But starkware as well is doing really well. So the portfolio is solid.
00:55:08.532 - 00:55:21.584, Speaker C: It's unfortunate they've sold the penguins already because I think they sold the bottom of penguins because there were actually quite a few penguins in the portfolio. I believe we had almost 100 penguins. So testament to the taste that we had.
00:55:22.124 - 00:55:30.064, Speaker A: I mean, they infamously, like, you know, they had, like, the FTX guys had sui, which they sold. Relaunch.
00:55:30.804 - 00:55:46.586, Speaker C: Yeah. You know, you know, we have aptos also had fuel labs not doing. I think it's not launched yet as well. But, you know, there's some big tech. He does some good stuff. Unfortunately, didn't have Celestia. You know, I think the reality is that if you look at even the previous cycle of bankruptcies, like, they all were hole in dollars by the end of just the.
00:55:46.586 - 00:56:38.474, Speaker C: So because of how forgiving crypto is and how big it gets each next time, like, Gox was like a big deal and then everyone got 20 x the dollars back, just not as much bitcoin back. And then, you know, Bitfinex, you know, they had a situation. Actually, what I realized is that, you know, there's always, like, the stories that people tell about things. It always, generally speaking, tell you more about themselves than it tells about the things. Right. Like, the criticism that I do take the most to heart is like, I think we should have been more active on trying to find a restructuring because I think that. I think we, in a way, and I talked to Arthur Chan a lot about this recently because we've been thinking about how would three arrows restructuring look like? And it's just like the brand value of three arrows was so high, and we kind of just brought it off to zero in a way, the way we put into liquidation.
00:56:38.474 - 00:57:02.946, Speaker C: I think that that was a shame. And I also think that if we had that courage and also that wisdom to find it, because there were guys at the time who wanted to restructuring. They want to say, you know, we'll come in, we'll put Lloyd Blankfein on the board, and then we'll, like, do something. We'll renegotiate terms of creditors. You know, people wanted to do this, and we. We lacked the energy to. To follow through with it, you know, and then our lawyers said you just put in liquidation.
00:57:02.946 - 00:57:27.782, Speaker C: I think similar thing happened, uh, in some other states, too. But I think, you know, uh, I'm kind of glad I had this experience now, because I kind of see life from both sides. Like, I see that it's not always just like, everything you touch wins, and also, you know, you gain more empathy for when. When stuff fails. Right? Because in the past, you know, we were the more judgmental when people fail to be like, huh, like, you failed. That sucks for you, you know, like that. But that's like, you know, that must mean you.
00:57:27.782 - 00:57:48.712, Speaker C: You suck also. So I think I would like to create something that ultimately my creditors can benefit from as well. I think that, that, you know, we. There's been such a divide in, like, the way that critters behave. I mean, some actually, they immediately invest in the new thing, whatever it is, and they're like, let's. Let's double up, right? Let's double down. I think there's others that, you know, take a different approach.
00:57:48.712 - 00:58:16.154, Speaker C: I think ultimately, for the ones that are still alive and doing something, I think there's a general sentiment that, yes, we messed up in terms of having this kind of hole in this situation, but I think that they also feel that we paid the price with them now in some sense, because it's not like we made money while they lost money, right? It's like we. We're, in a way, we were given a very long leash.
00:58:16.974 - 00:59:16.110, Speaker A: I mean, looking back, obviously, like, they're trying to put myself in your situation in, let's say, like, you know, that Luna sort of period where there's two things going on through my mind. One is, you know, we have a ton of leverage that's available to us based on, like, brand value, whatever, where we can bet five and lose one type of thing. And if we make five, then we keep five, and that's a big bet that you can make and you can move markets. And if you believe that markets can hold up, obviously, the macro environment was the one thing that was falling apart at the time that changed the dynamic. But given what you had seen up until now from the crypto markets, you can, you know, move enough size and just, you know, sailor, he just keeps buying and, like, the guy is just, like, making. Making it happen. So that's one thing going on through my mind, and then the other one is like, this is maybe like, the more conservative side of me, at least.
00:59:16.110 - 00:59:38.924, Speaker A: And I wonder if, like, you're looking back, you see it that way as well, where you're like, we have a money printer, which is, like, our brand value we're getting in all the deals. They're all clearly, like, really good valuations. We don't need to take that much risk because, like, and you can say, said that I about FTX as well, there is a really good business here that doesn't require the quick acceleration.
00:59:40.104 - 01:00:32.868, Speaker C: Yeah. But I think, in a way, it's not to be totally fatalist about it, but I think because we were rewarded so many times for a certain way of doing things that I think it was just such a fast shift. And I think also in general, the behavior of, let's say, genesis and the big lenders was such that Luna was such a shock to system. Like, we actually always thought we were conservative with ISIS because they always wanted to lend us much more than we actually wanted to take. Like, there's a period where we return all loans to some of the big lenders, and they begged us to take it back because they're like, we're going to do an IPO, assume we can't have the loan brook strength. So then we were, like, racking our brains saying, okay, then what do we do with this? Like, can we keep it and do something with it? So I think, like, if I was more mature, I would have realized that, like, yes, these guys have the capital, but it's all open term deposit from, you know, their base. If there was a huge crash or something, like a.
01:00:32.868 - 01:01:02.740, Speaker C: Like a huge black swan, they would also suddenly need everything back. Right. So I think saylors was smart because he termed it, like, it's all two year, three year paper type stuff. You know, we. We never had in house counsel, right. A lot of these agreements that they were just, you know, you just sign them and then you do it. So I think, you know, that's one big lesson, I think, for Kanai, which is that should think about all the scenarios with your counterparties before they happen and talk about what you should do, and then it's a lot cleaner.
01:01:02.740 - 01:01:33.036, Speaker C: Right. I think, you know, I think DCG, Genesis, for their part, I mean, I think, you know, they grew very fast. Also, originally, if you think about it, the whole business grew because of ourselves and SPF, right. I mean, they lent us against ETH and that we did so well, you know, and then they lent against TBTC. They also lent huge amounts against coins that Sam had just made, because then that creates infinite borrowing demand. Essentially, it's like a neo bank where it's backed by SPF's brand, right? So I think.
01:01:33.140 - 01:01:52.106, Speaker A: But surely, like, the left tail has to go through your mind. Like, you have, like, such a good distribution of outcomes. And, like, you know, the sort of, like, fat tail on the left is like something that, like Talib says, right? Like, sometimes, like, people don't consider it. Did you not consider the left tail enough? Or, like, did you. Did you sort of, like.
01:01:52.290 - 01:02:00.330, Speaker C: I think. I think it was just, you know, we were behaving the same way that got us there. I think it was just something that, you know, it's. It's, uh. So you.
01:02:00.362 - 01:02:05.810, Speaker A: You were acting, like, in the ways that kept working, but the sort of, like, landscape had changed around you.
01:02:05.962 - 01:02:47.596, Speaker C: That that's, I think, what happened. And then I think also, um, I think that realistically, we. I mean, I think there was a coordination problem in the whole market at that time because, you know, Celsius is buying ether. We were bullish bitcoin, and then Sam was selling both of them to buy Solana. And, you know, this was, like, a thing where it was actually hanging out with FTX guy the other day, and he was, like, saying, you know, imagine if, like, Celsius, three arrows, and FTX were all buying Solana. Like, that would have been a crazy market. You know, that would have been something where it goes to $200 while ether is $2,000.
01:02:47.596 - 01:03:21.746, Speaker C: Right. And then. But, you know, it's a lot of things like that where it's, you don't quite know until, like, so March 2020. A lot of firms actually, at that time went. Went, you know, bit into a pickle, and then there was a lot of forbearance because people are like, okay, this will only last one month. You know, we went to that position very conservatively, and we did well. And then I had seen that, you know, there's a lot of forbearance, actually, when these companies are, you know, briefly have problems, Celsius, but also Babel, both of which later blew up.
01:03:21.746 - 01:03:38.612, Speaker C: So I think, in a way, like, everyone learned the wrong lesson from that kind of moral hazard situation. I think that tends, when these kind of things, that tends to happen where there needs to be first, like a learning of the wrong lesson and then later on, a paying for that lesson. So that's kind of what happened.
01:03:38.748 - 01:03:50.820, Speaker A: Same thing with Luna, right? Like, Luna, like, repegged when it was small, and then it just, like, became much worse because people thought it was going to repeg, given the first time that it repegged.
01:03:50.892 - 01:04:17.240, Speaker C: Yeah. But I do think that, like, I think. I think smart people are generally aware that, you know, Genesis never would have grown if it had not done such loans. So there's no world where, like, they were conservative and then they should have, like, done this or this, that. Like, they very much knew all along that this was the game. Right? Like, this was their game to, like, when you lend billions of your client deposits to FTT, you know, that that's the risk that's gone. That's on the books, right? Like, that's.
01:04:17.240 - 01:04:39.836, Speaker C: Especially in the early days when it was not even that big. So I think that, you know, like, I had that tweet right afterward, too, where I said, you know, actually one of the biggest victims of these kind of big flywheel wizards is that the companies that try to do things normally, like, if you're just like, a normal borrower lender, let's say, you know, how are you going to get any market share? How are you going to get any growth, right? Because you got guys, meanwhile, that are going to lend toward fresh tokens that are just created.
01:04:39.980 - 01:04:54.108, Speaker B: I guess there's always a moral hazard, but I feel like I would be doing our audience a disservice if I don't at least ask about the potential super cycle. So do you still believe in the super cycle, or do you think that crypto is going to do have these boom and bust cycles?
01:04:54.276 - 01:05:27.214, Speaker C: I think actually it's still in a super cycle. I mean, even if you look at the way that it bounce back so quickly, like, I think the three arrows bottom was the ETH bottom in dollars, and the FTX bottom was actually, ETH was still higher. It was more of like a Solana capitulation, that bottom. But now we're back in reversion to the mean. It has followed the four year cycles, but at the same time, like, the underlying trends are really strong. The last bear market was more brutal in some ways than people thought, but it's also much less right. Despite all the things that happened.
01:05:27.214 - 01:05:48.306, Speaker C: Regulatory clarity. Most companies that fought SEC actually won. Coinbase had some good victories. Ripple has some victories. So, actually, if you look at the regulatory landscape for crypto, it's cleaner than before. You've got more ETF's, and the US is a big leader in that space. Once you have that, you're going to have Hong Kong ETF's.
01:05:48.306 - 01:06:05.768, Speaker C: You're going to have, every country's going to have ETF's. So I think history is long, right? Maybe when you zoom out 100 years, people will be like the super cycle of 2009 to 2035 or something, and then they'll be like, that was like, but if you zoom in really deep, they're like, no, here, it died. And then here, you know, so we.
01:06:05.776 - 01:06:16.184, Speaker A: Can look at, you know, like, Eric Wall has like the Rainbow chart. So, like, we're back in the rainbow. That's kind of what you said. Like, you can zoom in and just be like, oh, like, you know, look at that crash in 22.
01:06:16.224 - 01:06:32.248, Speaker D: But yeah, I tend to agree with you. I think we're still there. I mean, crypto has been so forgiving. If you've just, I mean, you can't. If you just stay in this space. Everyone's done well. It's shocking to me, seeing people that, you know, I know that are from 2020, everyone's done so well.
01:06:32.248 - 01:06:33.824, Speaker D: It's really amazing.
01:06:33.984 - 01:06:55.720, Speaker C: You know, when I meet some older people nowadays, they'll tell me something like, yeah, I'm pretty bullish crypto the next two decades on like a midterm basis. And that's the way, I mean, they're not making a joke. They literally think in decades. And they're like, yeah, I'm bullish for two decades. I don't know what happens after that. But, and so I think that, like, the boomers are all here. I feel in crypto, they're all watching it every day.
01:06:55.720 - 01:07:41.888, Speaker C: And I think that, you know, for some it's a digital gold element and for some it's like a, you know, it's the new game in town. I think one thing especially interesting too, is like, you're, like, you're seeing, you know, with the China big tech crackdown and like, you know, you can't do as much innovation. A lot of entrepreneurs, they want to find ways to do stuff anyway. So that'll drive activity. I think crypto is a solid ground for entrepreneurs to raise capital on chain, but also to find users quickly and also to deploy ideas quickly. So I think last few years, it's still mainly financialized, but I do think we will see broader and broader use cases come. I think that what has been needed is for that foundation of infrastructure to be built.
01:07:41.888 - 01:07:51.382, Speaker C: I think that now it's pretty, it's pretty built. It can always be better, but you can probably do stuff. You can properly just come up with the idea and just do it.
01:07:51.558 - 01:08:17.622, Speaker A: The bull case is there is available capital sourced globally and talented founders are going to use crypto as a means to generate their vision. And I've seen so many companies that during the bear market, they couldn't go to VC's and properly raise cash. They issue a token. They tell people their idea online. And then people are like, some people around the world are like, yeah, like, I. I want to back you on this. And then they, you know, they build businesses around it.
01:08:17.758 - 01:08:18.246, Speaker C: So that's.
01:08:18.270 - 01:08:34.006, Speaker A: That's something that will keep, like, the talent flow going. And that's definitely a bullcase. So. So super cycle continues. And also the super cycle in Singapore prisons of the population of those going up as well. Upon me. Let's wrap up, guys.
01:08:34.006 - 01:09:05.064, Speaker A: Let's. Let's do a little pasta of the week. We've seen a lot of these, like, AI. Every time I look at it, it's just absurd, you know, like, there's all these, like, this is from Gemini. This is the Google, a chat GBt equivalent, LLM. And it's so politically correct that there's just been, like, way too much San Francisco kind of sprinkled dust being put into it. You can't get them to, like, show a white, white person, you know, you ask them, well, like, show me, like, the president, 1940.
01:09:05.064 - 01:09:16.524, Speaker A: And it shows you, like, some, you know, Asian Pacific, like non binary, like, whatever. So this meme is basically like, hey, can you generate a picture of vanilla pudding?
01:09:17.464 - 01:09:18.632, Speaker C: And it says, here you go, here's.
01:09:18.648 - 01:09:28.520, Speaker A: Vanilla pudding, and there's just, like, all these pictures of chocolate pudding. So I thought this was funny. I sent this to Damas, and he did not think it was funny.
01:09:28.552 - 01:09:45.585, Speaker D: So, you know, I saw something funny on Twitter. I saw someone make a comment like, how much brand equity was destroyed from Google for this charade. And then I was thinking about it first. My first thought was like, oh, Google's toast. They lost AI. But then I was thinking about. I was like, this is just a small, little autistic corner of crypto Twitter.
01:09:45.585 - 01:09:47.673, Speaker D: Like, no one in the real world looks.
01:09:47.833 - 01:09:48.817, Speaker C: No one cares.
01:09:48.945 - 01:09:55.813, Speaker A: The firepower is still there, right? Like, the firepower is gonna. What's gonna, like, matter in the end in that, like, AI war.
01:09:55.993 - 01:10:18.158, Speaker D: I can go next. I have a strong contender. I'm excited about to hear Sue's thoughts on this. So this is from meltem here. She said, my friends, why are you telling her? Why are you so upset? Crypto is ripping, and she's just there crying. And this meme of this guy, you see all these narratives, BRC twenties, sui farms, AI coins, decentralized physical infrastructure.
01:10:18.206 - 01:10:22.146, Speaker A: Community is e beggar paralyzed.
01:10:22.170 - 01:10:36.842, Speaker D: Evm intense. It's like restaking. There are so many narratives and things to keep track of. It's. It's overwhelming, right? Like, it didn't used to be like this. You could just farm sushi and chill. Now there are all of these things that you have to stay on top of.
01:10:36.842 - 01:10:45.974, Speaker D: And if you're missing just one of these, the FOMO is unbearable, right? Like, I miss. I've missed so many airdrops. Tyke, he's been rubbing it in my face, and I'm just coping out here.
01:10:46.354 - 01:10:49.076, Speaker A: Amazing. This is top.
01:10:49.180 - 01:11:12.308, Speaker B: It's a good one. Yeah, the markets change all the time. And I think there was the uncommon Core podcast where sue talked about financial populism, I guess. And I think airdrop farming is, in a way, that similar idea where we have these rich whales complain about linear distribution points, mechanisms, and then we have the smaller fish talking about, well, fuck those guys.
01:11:12.356 - 01:11:12.808, Speaker C: Give me.
01:11:12.876 - 01:11:16.840, Speaker B: Give me all the tokens. And I think that's kind of what's playing out in crypto as well.
01:11:16.952 - 01:11:36.164, Speaker A: I think the right distribution is, like a bit above zero for the kind of very low amounts, and then it should go linear after that. That's my personal belief about you kind of hit the two extremes, and then the guys in the middle usually are mid curving anyway.
01:11:37.784 - 01:11:56.554, Speaker C: Yeah, but I mean, the problem with linear, though, is that you often get, like, whales will own, like, all of it, right? Because the sum of whales, like, the top 100 will own 95% of the supply. And some bad ones, like, think about defy summer BDP, something like that. You get farmed by, like, Justin sun, and then it's dead.
01:11:56.674 - 01:12:10.960, Speaker D: Well, he just put 500 million or something dollars worth of ETH into eigen lair. And I was thinking, well, this just totally ruins the parts distribution. Now they're going to have to do it in buckets. Like, over 100k points is this amount of tokens, 50 to 100k is this amount of tokens, etcetera.
01:12:11.032 - 01:12:19.232, Speaker A: Let me the final one. Justin sun. After all the different tiers, it's like $10. What do you have, Taiki?
01:12:19.408 - 01:12:49.422, Speaker B: I thought it was pretty funny. It's like the different types of fund managers and, I guess, traders in general. We have the value investing people who think they're super smart, but they're crying inside. We have the energy cowboys, the statistical arbitrage, the neckbeards, the tail risk hedging that's always getting wrecked, like, paying for premiums. And then the venture capital is like just circle jerking and sucking its own dick. Like, who do you like? For me, I identify with the value investing guy, right. The mid curve.
01:12:49.422 - 01:12:54.766, Speaker B: I'm the ultimate mid curve. Like, who do you like? What do you three identify as from this?
01:12:54.950 - 01:12:56.782, Speaker A: Who? None of them.
01:12:56.918 - 01:13:10.804, Speaker D: Well, for me, it's got to be vc. Like I've said before, my little barbell strategy is basically ETH only, and then a ton of angel investments, and then not much, like, long tail liquid coins in the middle, so I'm taking the bottom right there. VC.
01:13:11.864 - 01:13:27.256, Speaker A: I guess I'm kind of, like, the activist I got. I got the little, like, you know, thing going on. You know, I don't have the glasses, but I do like to be active and get my, you know, be in the arena. I kind of, like, make fun of myself, but I like to be in the arena, so I guess that's me.
01:13:27.440 - 01:13:44.722, Speaker D: Jordy, I kind of think of you as the short seller. He's a short seller because remember when you called for the UsT collapse? Right. You were early to that, and it went up for so long and so much, and I just. Could I just picture you there just depressed, and then finally, when it collapsed, just euphoria.
01:13:44.858 - 01:13:45.626, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:13:45.810 - 01:13:46.994, Speaker B: How are you, sue?
01:13:47.154 - 01:13:54.562, Speaker C: Hard to say. Maybe. Maybe energy, I think. I don't know what it means, but, like, the hat, so smoking.
01:13:54.738 - 01:13:59.186, Speaker A: That sounds about right. Any. Any pasta on your side, sue?
01:13:59.370 - 01:14:00.010, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
01:14:00.082 - 01:14:00.594, Speaker C: This is.
01:14:00.674 - 01:14:03.614, Speaker A: This is, like, the. This is the new big thing right now. This.
01:14:05.314 - 01:14:34.380, Speaker C: I absolutely love this. I was just telling the other day, like, he's got to hold a conference in Bangkok called White City. If he does, I'll keynote it for sure. I'll lie in for that. I think it's like, he has such a strong brand. I hope he uses it in cycle, because I think that, like, my story was obviously, like, you know, the well known one, but, like, he's, like, such a legend in the. That he was such a good developer as well, like, with lead code, and then just, like, entered into, like, white city, and then it's like, boom.
01:14:34.380 - 01:14:51.284, Speaker C: Like, huge number two, P and R FTX. So I just think, like, the lore. I think there's a lot of potential for lore. Sometimes. It's like, it's a non duality where, like, very bad things can actually be very good. Very good things are often actually very bad. So, you know, hope he does it.
01:14:51.284 - 01:14:51.628, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:14:51.676 - 01:15:08.290, Speaker B: And for those that don't know his story, I mean, I just remember during, I think, early 2021, where, like, he was just posting seven figure p and ls every single day, and then I think he got liquidated at some point, and then the next image he posted was like, him in a hospital for whatever reason.
01:15:08.442 - 01:15:10.770, Speaker A: I just remember that so much.
01:15:10.962 - 01:15:11.938, Speaker B: Legendary.
01:15:12.106 - 01:15:39.864, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, people maybe don't know all the stories from the old cycle. Sue, you were saying in the pre show that, you know, you go to meetups and people don't even know who three arrows is. You know, there's just, like, so many different corners of even, like, during the bull market, I remember. I mean, I've talked about this before, but we were in Bahamas for the FTX conference, and, like, there was some, like, marketing girl sitting next to you at the table, and she had no idea who you were or something.
01:15:40.404 - 01:16:04.818, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Crypto is just so big. It's so big. Like, what I found is that in Dubai, I'll get recognized, but it's usually some indian teenagers, and I'll be like, whoa. And then it's almost every other day, but in other cities, it's almost never. And at crypto events, I think from what I've seen, Dubai has the most crypto, Saudi maybe just because our brand was also quite well known in Dubai.
01:16:04.818 - 01:16:22.840, Speaker C: And Dubai is more of that kind of a culture was like, who's this? Who's that? But, like, yeah, in other places, like, people really will shake. Like, I'll shake their hand. I'll be like, yeah, like three arrows. They'll be like, oh, okay, cool. And then they'll just say what they're from, and they're like, okay, yeah. It's like, they won't even. It won't even register anything.
01:16:22.840 - 01:16:38.600, Speaker C: Just kind of glaze over. I find that really, really cool, actually. Like, it must be what Milken felt like, you know, five years later. Like, milken's like, yeah, Drexel. And then the guy will glaze over. He's like, I'm from, you know, Deloitte, you know, and just go straight into it.
01:16:38.792 - 01:16:45.810, Speaker A: Yeah, the cycles just, like, keep refreshing with new entrants and new characters and different bubbles.
01:16:45.962 - 01:16:58.826, Speaker C: Because if you think about it, like, who do you know from, you know, who do people know from the 2016 cycle or, like, the 2017 stuff? It becomes just, like a memory, right? So I think, yeah, the speed that crypto moves at is incredible.
01:16:59.010 - 01:17:07.882, Speaker B: So it's like a main character cycle, too. Like, every cycle has, like, its own personality that just becomes the guy. We'll see who that is. This cycle.
01:17:07.938 - 01:17:19.628, Speaker A: Well, I think all the. All the meme kind of meme or pasta of the weeks were pretty strong. So we're going to have to like leave the chat to choose a winner this time. I don't think we can let you win it Justin. Even though yours was very strong.
01:17:19.796 - 01:17:23.252, Speaker D: I think I had the best one there. I was waiting for sue to crown.
01:17:23.308 - 01:17:25.796, Speaker A: Me but maybe, maybe I guess we'll.
01:17:25.820 - 01:17:26.908, Speaker D: Leave it up to the audience.
01:17:27.036 - 01:17:39.840, Speaker A: We'll leave it up to the audience. Cool. It's been, it's been, you know, a great conversation. Sue, thanks for hopping on. Any, any final thoughts? Like, I mean thanks for having me.
01:17:39.912 - 01:17:50.856, Speaker C: This is a great podcast. It's one of the main ones that I listen to nowadays. I think that, I think guys are doing a great job at kind of presenting ideas in a funny way. I think it's good.
01:17:50.960 - 01:18:04.484, Speaker A: Yeah, we're happy to explore all coins, all corners and we have fun with it. So thanks for hopping on and everybody, we'll see you next week. Take care.
01:18:04.524 - 01:18:04.764, Speaker D: Bye everyone.
