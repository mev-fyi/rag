00:00:20.360 - 00:00:43.428, Speaker A: Welcome to another episode of Steady Lads. I'm Jordy, the CIO of Celining Capital, and we have with us the humble farmer. We have Justin, the CEO of Astaria, and Thiki, who is thicky. Did you lose your role at Scimitar Capital or you have an undefined role there now?
00:00:43.556 - 00:00:49.036, Speaker B: I got pipped, but yeah, still here, at least for this quarter.
00:00:49.180 - 00:00:51.064, Speaker C: He lost the shirt off his back.
00:00:53.014 - 00:00:55.814, Speaker B: Was it clearly wrong about the call about alts?
00:00:55.974 - 00:00:57.634, Speaker D: They're pumping across the board.
00:00:58.174 - 00:01:06.830, Speaker A: What do you think made you wrong? Is it just that people got bored and started looking for shitcoins to buy, or what do you think actually happened?
00:01:06.902 - 00:01:17.486, Speaker B: Yeah, I think probably just underestimated the demand side. I think supply is always very. It's a lot easier to measure the demand, whereas demand is a bit more like intuition based, especially in crypto.
00:01:17.550 - 00:01:29.696, Speaker A: Do you think it's just the lag defect of, uh, the usual, you know. Oh, is that like your. Your phone alert sticky or, uh, are you getting these, like, fire alarm? What's going on?
00:01:29.800 - 00:01:32.424, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, it looks like FTX is moving their soul around.
00:01:32.584 - 00:01:40.248, Speaker A: Are they. They just kind of baiting people so they can short. So they can short squeeze them more or. What do you think they're doing that. I would not put it past Novo.
00:01:40.376 - 00:01:48.970, Speaker B: I. I had that same exact suspicion, like, some of these things that, like, they, like, unstake it and restake it and, like, just do all these random things. It's hard to trade off of.
00:01:49.042 - 00:02:15.290, Speaker A: Speaking of alerts, I mean, now that I heard the little bell, if our viewers could be nice enough to, like and hit the subscribe and notification bell as well, our editor would be very happy. But in all seriousness. So we're seeing, you know, alts having quite a good pump after the initial BTC rally. So is this an altseason or thick? I mean, you didn't expect this, but how do you see it now?
00:02:15.402 - 00:02:17.374, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it looks like it is.
00:02:18.074 - 00:02:42.976, Speaker A: How much room do you think it has? I mean, equities have been not great. The Fed is pausing, but interest rates are not in a great spot either. So macro is not amazing. But somehow the ETF news for bitcoin has spread into alts, but not for ETH. That seems to be consistent with our show last week as well. The huge underperformer.
00:02:43.080 - 00:03:19.298, Speaker B: Yeah, I think typically, like, you see, like, BTC lead, and right now there's a lot of reasons to bid BTC. I think the ETF is like the main one, but, you know, with race going through the roof, and, like, just infinite issuance and just questions of, like, a death spiral. Like, there are some similarities to, like, the march situation with the SVB thing with BTC. So there's some, like. And, like, you know, with the war going on, too, there's some, like, other auxiliary reasons why people might want to be bidding BTC, which could explain a lot of the moves in the past couple weeks. And usually you see BTC lead and then ETH follows. And then finally, like, the wealth effect causes people to gamble in alts.
00:03:19.298 - 00:03:29.722, Speaker B: But like, this, you know, this time around, you saw ETH not really move that much, but alts sort of, kind of just skipped the ladder and pump up, which is, like, quite interesting.
00:03:29.898 - 00:03:50.486, Speaker A: It's very idiosyncratic. We're seeing some coins, you know, go up two, three times and then maybe some favorites of Taiki, for example. I saw Maker wasn't performing as well lately. Mantle is not doing great right now. I think some of the Kanto doing well. How's Kanto doing?
00:03:50.590 - 00:04:32.794, Speaker D: Kanto's? Yeah, Kanto's still holding up. Some vertical accumulation going on. At least I hope, if I can. I mean, justin, you had the total three chart up, and like you said, jordy, it seems like people are not bidding ETH before just bidding alts and total three is a total market cap for crypto not containing bitcoiner ether. And yes, it's up 13%, but it's still not hitting any new local highs. It kind of makes me believe that people are selling ether to fund new purchases of altcoins like Solana. And until this is pumping, putting in your local highs, I still don't think that we are in an all clear altseason.
00:04:32.794 - 00:04:44.358, Speaker D: I do think the supply overhang is a factor for a lot of alts, but there are some strength in select sectors, and I think it's worth noting, and they might be the best performers to look at.
00:04:44.526 - 00:04:48.910, Speaker C: Vicki, you just sent along this chart. What are we looking at here? There's a lot going on.
00:04:49.062 - 00:05:02.608, Speaker B: Yeah. These are some of the coins I was tracking as fund coins. I think these are all coins with defensible narratives for why a long only spot only fund might allocate some money into.
00:05:02.776 - 00:05:03.032, Speaker C: It.
00:05:03.048 - 00:05:35.482, Speaker B: Just kind of highlights what's been performing and what hasn't. I do kind of liken this to the sort of out performance of, like, you know, the magnificent seven inequities where, like, everything else in P is flat, but, like, the seven names, like, the top tech names are all pushing everything up. So, like, as a whole, like, the indexes are up. But, you know, if you look granular wise and you do some cross sectional stuff, it's really just concentrated. A few names, like Sol is up so much up. You know, since September, it's up, like, almost three, four. X link has been a huge outperformer.
00:05:35.482 - 00:05:52.226, Speaker B: And there are some, like, you know, some names are doing, like, outperform BTC, like blur, Aave, Dyx. But, you know, most other alts are actually underperforming BTC, which is, like, quite interesting to see, especially the east ones, like optimism, r lido, et cetera. Maker FSS.
00:05:52.370 - 00:06:13.634, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's. I mean, there really just is no narrative for anything other than bitcoin right now. I mean, when you talk to non crypto people, bitcoin and crypto are sort of synonymous with each other. No one really thinks about all of these other things, all of these other tokens. Right. I mean, bitcoin is the one. And with so little to do on chain, that's exciting and novel and new.
00:06:13.634 - 00:06:28.548, Speaker C: I think tykes been hammering this home a lot. Like, we need something new to catalyze and bull run for everything other than BTC. And I think that is generally true. Unless price just continues to go up and then all bets are off and people start gambling. To your point, Vicki, I think a.
00:06:28.556 - 00:07:09.374, Speaker A: Lot of this is definitely trading related. It's not so much fundamentals. We're seeing the DWF effect that we've talked about in certain coins. We had some insane rips of liquidity TRB. We see them moving these coins around on chain. So we know that there's some trading momentum happening there. I think the fact, though, that Celestia, you know, which recently ICO, has not performed amazingly well, if you compare it to something like Sui, which was also, you know, in the depth of the bear market, which launched at, you know, 10 billion, this is 2 billion.
00:07:09.374 - 00:07:40.730, Speaker A: It was a 2.3 billion launch FDV for a chain that was talked about for a long time and did this, like a huge airdrop campaign. I'm curious if pith might do better. We've seen them announce an airdrop, and when you looked at the top two performing coins, Link and Solana, which are kind of like the two compare comps that you might have so thick. Yeah, I'm sure you must have been getting a good amount of airdrop. What are you expecting?
00:07:40.842 - 00:08:09.726, Speaker B: I mean, the pith airdrop has been hyped for a really long time. It is nice that it gets the double dip on solar performance. And the link out performance with oracles and with, you know, the Solana, even though pith does serve data to like pretty much every chain now, it's not just Solana. And historically it has been focused on Solana. Yeah, I mean, given that Celestia hasn't done that well so far, it only has been like two days. So we'll see. But like, it's not like an amazing condition to launch.
00:08:09.726 - 00:08:14.934, Speaker B: But I do think like, you know, a couple billion easily be in the cards.
00:08:15.054 - 00:08:22.484, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so. I mean, a lot of this money that's kind of around the Solana ecosystem could, could potentially bid pretty hard.
00:08:22.944 - 00:09:03.822, Speaker D: For those that are unaware, kit is an oracle on Solana. They're also available on optimism and other l two s, but mostly on Solana. Do you notice or the one thing I noticed is that we've seen more and more projects start to just drop tokens as soon as prices start pumping. Do you think that this could be a new form of a catalyst where tokens and projects that's been waiting to launch tokens are going to start launching them and that can be somewhat of a boost for user wallets and maybe this can help put a bottom in EBTC because people take their airdrop, they're mostly ethereum users, people that get these airdrops, maybe that can create some artificial bid in Eid. Do you guys think that can potentially be a catalyst for a bull?
00:09:03.918 - 00:10:01.800, Speaker C: Yeah, I think for projects there's definitely a time pressure to get your token out sooner rather than later. Because I mean, just think about the incentives here, right? One, you don't want to launch your token at the top or in the heat of a bull market, because then, you know, you're going to be down 90%, let's say, in a theoretical bear market. And then two founders and everyone on the team, investors, et cetera, everyone that had insider allocations has generally, like, let's say a one year lockup and then a few years of vesting after that. And so if you want to be able to capture any of that value that you created, you want to launch and you token in the bear market, you want your community, your investors ever to have this wealth effect where your token goes up and then you want to be unlocked at a time that it's reasonable to sort of take profit without like destroying the market, destroying your community, etcetera. Whereas if you launch, you know, a year from now, you might have all of your tokens locked up until the bear market. And then, you know, maybe you don't have enough capital to keep building. Who knows what the issues are.
00:10:01.800 - 00:10:18.282, Speaker C: But there's definitely, like, a time pressure to get your token out sooner rather than later. And so I do think we'll see more of this start to happen. I think pith could have done their airdrop a couple months ago, right, but they decided to do it now because market conditions are better. That's my speculation.
00:10:18.418 - 00:10:48.062, Speaker A: I mean, I think these things are not that easy to put together. So I'm not sure that the pith and the starknet and the Celestias, they all were quickly getting it out the door. I think they've been planning for a while, and it just so happened that timing is a lot better now than it was a couple of months ago. Stockinette, one might be what you talked about, Taiki. That could be potentially a good one for ETH. So looking forward to seeing that one as well. I think that one will be maybe q one.
00:10:48.238 - 00:11:15.818, Speaker D: Yeah, there's so many l two s now. There's scroll, there's Tyco, there's darkware, Zksync. At some point, all these projects have seven airdrop. That could create a massive vault effect within the Ethereum community. And maybe things like this has to happen, because right now, like Justin said, there's not much happening, even Solana. I mean, it's pumping, but you go to the defi ecosystem, all you can do is stake Sol and borrow against your soul. You can say the same for other l two ecosystems as well.
00:11:15.818 - 00:11:25.612, Speaker D: But this isn't really what we need to see for a sustainable bull market. It just seems like this flows, right? More buyers and sellers getting price to go higher?
00:11:25.738 - 00:11:41.696, Speaker A: I think so I don't know how many of you guys actually read the Vanek report or just everybody saw the headline. You know, base case, $300. Bullcase Solana, 3413.25. You know, very scientific. I did. I did go through and read it. I don't know.
00:11:41.696 - 00:11:43.644, Speaker A: Did any of you guys actually go through it?
00:11:44.504 - 00:11:45.536, Speaker D: No, I didn't.
00:11:45.680 - 00:11:47.080, Speaker C: Enlighten us, Jordy.
00:11:47.232 - 00:12:48.846, Speaker A: You know, despite the awful kind of memeness of the headline, it's decently well written and well researched. It does point out the huge problem with Solana is that it's very hard for them to actually generate fees. And right now, because of how cheap the chain is, it makes a million a month, and then the costs of just solely the supply are 30 million a month. It makes a good point that the way that the chain is designed makes it very hard for it to actually earn money. And therefore, like this price action or to be sustainable. We talked about this a little bit last time, but it kind of goes into the monetary premium aspect, because if it's not going to actually make any fees, what's the game plan? And I had an interesting back and forth on Twitter this week with Anatoly and Austin as well, who will get on the show because he graciously offered to come and debate this with me and with all of us as well. We'll see what everybody else thinks about this.
00:12:48.846 - 00:13:43.334, Speaker A: But my own take is that in the long run, short term price action really doesn't matter. This is just people putting money in a box. And then the question is what happens? And if it's not going to really start generating cash flows that are going to exceed the investments, then you're trying to create money. And I've thought about this for a very long time, and I think the worst possible characteristic of money is who is it going to go to, like this money in the box? Who's going to extract it? And it's going to be whoever sells into it. And if the people selling are like massive $10 billion funds like multicoin or lawyers trying to get more fees and extract more fees from FTX estate, stuff like this, I don't think that's very equitable, regardless of whether some people manage to make money trading it or not.
00:13:44.104 - 00:14:11.676, Speaker C: This sort of strikes me as the argument, like, do you want to be right or do you want to make money type thing. So we talked about this a couple of weeks ago, and I was trying to play devil's advocate of like, well, there is a lot of sold that has to be sold, but maybe they can find some sort of OTC deal at a given price. And you are very much. And I think this is definitely true. Like, no, this supply has to get sold. It will have downward pressure on the price. But at the end of the day, the market seems to be willing to pay for that.
00:14:11.676 - 00:14:21.668, Speaker C: And the market's not thinking. You know, they're not taking the rational thoughts that you're thinking. And we see that all the time in crypto. I mean, like, what are your initial thoughts on that? Is it.
00:14:21.716 - 00:14:41.160, Speaker A: No, I mean, that's. That's a question. And I understand a lot of our listeners and a lot of listen, like, 99.999% of the population is in a very different situation than me. I've worked hard in my life, and I have a skill set that I could apply to different things. And at this point, I can make money in different ways. And I don't actually think about it from a trade so much.
00:14:41.160 - 00:15:15.824, Speaker A: I think about it more for the space. Like, are we doing the right thing by trying to create money out of coins that have shitty supply dynamics? And I think it's morally, ethically wrong. And the people that like Anatoly, I think he just doesn't understand it. So he's not trying to be a grifter. I think he just literally doesn't understand what. What is happening. You can see the replies to my tweets where he's saying that, well, you know, in a diffuse system, the coins will get distributed to that long term equilibrium, which is, you know, sure, like.
00:15:15.824 - 00:15:48.606, Speaker A: Like the atoms in the room when somebody farts, like, they'll get distributed, whatever. Like, sure, but that's not what we're talking about. And so, like, if people that are watching the show are just trying to, like, make. Make some money and, like, you know, two extra bag, you know, in the next month, then that's not what I'm talking about. These kind of dynamics can obviously get short squeezed and. But in the long run, I think there's only one way things go. And when I say long run, you know, 510 years.
00:15:48.606 - 00:16:22.086, Speaker A: And even anatoly himself, if I've listened to him on thousand x podcast, he is very clear that there is no money coming. There is no revenue coming. He says maybe in the long distant future, some new use cases will hopefully appear that will use all this block space and use this TPS, and then we don't know what they are. They don't exist. So this is a very theoretical, long term bet. And if you believe that bet, that's fine. I think there will be new chains like Monad and other ones that go after this TPS narrative, and it's not as unique.
00:16:22.086 - 00:16:34.374, Speaker A: You know, maybe I'm wrong. Like, maybe the cash flow comes, but when it comes to the monetary premium, I don't think I can be wrong there. Like, selling into retail is, you know.
00:16:34.414 - 00:17:26.068, Speaker B: Not a great setup regarding, like, the monetary premium aspect. Like, there are plenty of currencies in the world that, like, have really shitty, I guess, economics where, like, they're just like, you know, I guess you view it as, like, fee burn might be viewed as, like, tax receipts, and it's just like they're infinitely always issuing more debt than they're getting in tax receipts, but they still exist for maybe some reason. Maybe it's like, use that country's commodities or to trade with that country. People still swap into that and trade with them. Like, do you think those, like, those currencies are, like, are still around even though they're going to bleed against the dollar? Do you think that, like, even though it may not ever be cash flow positive, like, maybe nothing will ever, like, analogously, nothing may never displace the dollar, but there still is a reason for it to exist and be traded? Like, what do you think about that argument?
00:17:26.196 - 00:17:52.112, Speaker A: Like, any. Like, any economy needs a currency so that people can transact. But when you're looking at the digital economy, do we need 10,000 coins? Like, we can just. Theoretically, we could just use one, right? Like, I don't know if it's. I'm not gonna say which one. You know, it could be, like, just USDT or whatever, but digitally, we're not constricted, we're not requiring things to exist. So might they start existing in these, like, network states? I think so.
00:17:52.112 - 00:18:28.834, Speaker A: I think we will potentially have multiple digital currencies for different network states, for different, like, geographical regions. Potentially. Potentially, like, you know, just different left right, you know, libertarian type of people. They might have different community coins, but I think the community coins that should get chosen are ones with, like, no shitty supply coming for years, where people will just kind of keep getting unlocks and then basically extracting, you know, the value out of that. Out of that economy, really.
00:18:29.254 - 00:19:02.256, Speaker C: Can I ask another follow up? And this is sort of what we talked about with there, what Jamo talked about last week. But, like, let's imagine we're back in, let's say, I don't know, 2011, and we're looking at bitcoin. And we don't know at this point that, like, Satoshi lost his keys or has passed away or something like that. We've got this one individual that holds millions of coins. I think other miners held probably millions of coins. It didn't look great, right? We would have probably said the same things we said we're saying about Solana now, about bitcoin. I mean, what are your thoughts there that, like, a lot can change? We don't know how the supply will change.
00:19:02.256 - 00:19:15.794, Speaker C: Maybe the FTX estate loses its keys or there's an emergency injunction and they can't sell. You know, like, there's just so many plausibilities, and we wouldn't have given bitcoin a chance with the same argument years ago. And so I'm curious what your thoughts are with that.
00:19:16.614 - 00:19:49.406, Speaker A: That's actually a great question. And I spent the entire bull market thinking about this. We can't get, like, an up only market as like, you know, the Suzu sort of bulls were expecting. And it's precisely for the reasons you mentioned. Like, there is this like, very not great distribution even for things like bitcoin. And the reality is, the reason bear markets happen are to like, redistribute coins and they will then, like, unlock the next leg up. We need.
00:19:49.406 - 00:21:00.564, Speaker A: We need the distribution to happen because if you think about it from the coin holders point of view, if I'm just holding a ton of bitcoin, like a ton, and I'm not doing anything and the price just keeps going up, I will not. I will not sell it. I will just keep doing the same thing. So we literally are forced to create bear markets so that the Winklevoss and whoever else like, holds too many coins, a little doubt starts to appear in their mind of maybe this is not up only so I should diversify and be like, maybe there's credit events, who knows what? But ultimately the point is we need the coins to get distributed. The sad part is, and this is why I'm not super bullish on an immediate bull market. Some of the things that happened with Celsius, FTX, Voyager, all these issues that we had in the last bull market, they're very bearish for distribution because they were taking coins that were distributed. Everybody had one bitcoin on Voyager or Celsius, and those fuckers basically stole it or, you know, got liquidated on it.
00:21:00.564 - 00:21:47.622, Speaker A: And then when the estates come in, they just sell everything and give people dollars back. So it just ruins the distribution. That was already, like, getting better and it actually takes us a step back. So that was a little bit frustrating to see as somebody that wants this next leg to happen. And my last point is, the reason why I really don't like things like Solana as being treated as money is because I think in the long run, if you're trying to really hold coins for years, which is where I'm at, the way that we have exponential 100 x type of returns is through a supply squeeze. And that's such a key ingredient. There's only so much bitcoin, there's only so much ethereum.
00:21:47.622 - 00:22:09.174, Speaker A: As long as the community grows a little bit and a little bit, a little bit, a little bit more. At some point there is a huge. I kind of foresee this Nike swoosh coming at some point where the price will just go exponential because there are no coins, as opposed to VC coins that will get unlocked for the next five years.
00:22:09.474 - 00:23:01.054, Speaker D: I totally understand that argument, but can't you also make an argument that back in 2018 there was nothing. I mean, we were shooting on salon earlier for a lack of an ecosystem, but back in 2018 to 2019, there was nothing to do on Ethereum other than buying cryptokitties or something. And right now there's not much to do on Solana. But the Ethereum ICO that happened, we talked about the token distribution with JMO. Can Solana be eventually money in the future after this big supply overhang is lifted from the markets? And can't this actually create better distribution? Because you have these Alameda coins that if FTX didn't implode, maybe they would have kept them and that overhang was always going to be there. But now if it's going to be forced, sold into the community, then maybe we just have a wide, super long accumulation range and then just a Nike swoosh for a Solana token once actual use cases come online.
00:23:01.174 - 00:23:46.714, Speaker A: Yeah, well, there's years and years of unlocks, right, going into like 28, whatever. The other thing is that there's a huge staking yield on Solana compared to Ethereum. It's like twice as big or something. And that kind of makes it so that the less sophisticated people who aren't staking are getting diluted as well, which is not amazing. But we did talk about Ethereum and you look at Ethereum, there are fees getting burnt. It's a decent, compared to Solana, it's like 100 x, it's not even closed. But it's still not that much like, let's say it's a billion dollars a year, which, you know, I think that's kind of during the bull market, it was around one or 2 billion of actual, you know, income, you could call it.
00:23:46.714 - 00:24:14.110, Speaker A: If it's trading at 200 billion, that's still like 100 p ratio, which is not amazing. So it's clear that there is like a monetary premium and actually the monetary premium is the larger one because, you know, a normal tech stock would trade at like 30, right? 30, 40, let's say. Okay, theorem, you could call it early stage, it could be 50. But where is that? Where's the rest of that? Like, you know, 100, 200 billion coming? It's, it's this monetary premium that we're talking about.
00:24:14.222 - 00:24:22.766, Speaker B: Do you think it's a monetary premium or just like a tech and speculation premium? Because I mean, like, like things like Amazon, we're trading at like, they're negative pe, right?
00:24:22.950 - 00:24:24.718, Speaker C: Amazon's 70 right now.
00:24:24.846 - 00:24:28.178, Speaker B: Well, yeah, right now. But I'm saying like maybe like ten years ago.
00:24:28.306 - 00:25:05.568, Speaker A: So I mean, Amazon is this, you know, weird financial games going on where they can decide when to get profit, when, you know, they went for 20 years without taking profits, so there was no earnings. Like they literally just were loss making. When they could flip the switch, you know, just like you, just like you can flip the fee switch on uniswap. They could have flipped this pretty similar. Yeah, they waited 20 years. So I don't think it's a great metric for Amazon. Well, you know, for Ethereum, I have seen like the, the stuff that we talked about last time, last week, I have seen it throughout Twitter.
00:25:05.568 - 00:25:37.604, Speaker A: I don't know if people are taking from us, but a lot of the kind of influencers on Twitter were making the point that, you know, there's, there's a divide in the theorem community between people really trying to make it better money and trying to like, make burns and buybacks and whatever else, and then the people who just, they just want something to build on and they just think about the tech and some of the decisions that will have to get made coming up for Ethereum will put those two head to head, as we've talked about.
00:25:37.984 - 00:26:04.176, Speaker C: I don't know what the solution is, but it is frustrating that most, 99.99% of users of Ethereum, and even project founders, builders, etcetera, have absolutely no say in the direction of Ethereum. Like, it just strikes me as this decentralization sham. And I mean, obviously I'm, you know, called the ETH maxi on the show. I'm very much a believer in it. I love Ethereum. I hold it, I want to build on it.
00:26:04.176 - 00:26:29.408, Speaker C: But can you really say it's extremely decentralized when, you know, none of us can even control anything about any of these decisions that are being made about the money? And, you know, I know the narrative is, well, we can hop on these calls anytime we want and join the, you know, the core developer calls and contribute, but that's not actually true. Right? Like, we can be present there, but it doesn't matter what we say, we don't actually have a real voice there.
00:26:29.536 - 00:27:09.044, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a, that's an amazing point. I think you either choose the bitcoin route where, you know, one guy just presets it so there's no, there's no foundations and discussions and everything else. It's just that that's basically what it is. I mean, you do have some upgrades here and there, but for the most part, it's enshrined. And the problem with that is if you make a single mistake, I think Satoshi made, unfortunately, a couple mistakes, especially with the long term supply issue. No one's really around to fix it. If it was ethereum, they've changed inflation rate so many times, and that's part of the game.
00:27:09.044 - 00:27:28.118, Speaker A: That's the other extreme where there's a loss of neutrality potentially. I think both are imperfect. We still haven't found the right exact formula, but they both have promise. But yeah, there's a bit of an issue on both sides. Yeah.
00:27:28.166 - 00:28:06.572, Speaker D: I'm curious to ask this question for you. Jordy and Vicky and I talked about this some time ago, but we recorded a podcast that said altcoins are uninvestable vaporware. Is there anything that's truly investable outside of crypto monies? Or do you just view things like Solana and Alto ones and Defi tokens as just an instrument to speculate on? Because it definitely seems like you're leaning more towards, okay, like bitcoin and ether. I'm bullish on them as crypto monies. I'm bullish on the future adoption, but all these other tokens maybe not so investable. And this is an open question to you guys as well. I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts.
00:28:06.718 - 00:28:58.622, Speaker A: I think apart from bitcoin ether, where potentially the community money aspect, does hockey stick as the supply runs out and it's programmed to run out. I'm looking for cash flows, and there's a lot of reasons why coin can have a cash flow. There are digital economies, our users, there's people on DyDX trading back and forth. There's fees being burned. People are minting nfts, they're doing stuff. There are altcoins I like, and I look for like, this boomer like concept of, you know, is there going to be cash flow and also like, what's the expenses? You kind of look at it as a company, like something like Lido. I haven't been as bullish as other people on Lido just because they spend, I don't know, 17, 20 million a year on.
00:28:58.622 - 00:29:23.534, Speaker A: On the cost of the foundation. And the revenue is potentially going to get squeezed down as like, there's a fight for yield. The margins are not amazing to justify, like a multi billion valuation. I think right now it's at one point something. So I definitely look at it as a business for a lot of these coins.
00:29:24.374 - 00:30:18.456, Speaker C: I'm personally very much hoping that regulation is actually the solution for this. These, like, challenges we're talking about. Like, I think what happened with Uniswap is actually a much bigger deal than we realize now where they basically, right, like they turned on a fee switch but not for the token. And in my mind, the right regulation would say if you're going to have a token, the goal has to be those are your shareholders and your stakeholders and you have to drive value there. If we continue down this path where there's a split between incentives of what is in the best interest of the actual builders versus what is in the best interest of the quote unquote, investors or holders of this token, then I don't think we're going to get anywhere because the incentives are so poorly designed right now. It's like unimaginable. And so I really am hopeful and I really do hope that we get regulation in order and we actually come up with an amazing framework where we can drive value to tokens.
00:30:18.456 - 00:30:23.262, Speaker C: And if you have a token, you have an obligation to those shareholders. But we'll see.
00:30:23.358 - 00:31:05.738, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the third category that we could look at as having value or, you know, you could try to play is token that forever. For whatever reason, traders love to trade these tokens. Like they're just, they're useful as a speculation instrument in and out of themselves. You know, in Korea we talked about XRP as being, you know, a long time favorite there. We're seeing some like injective or pepe, I'm not sure if that's gonna, it's quite new. You know, dogecoin was in that category for a while. I don't know if it's still in favor, but think you do.
00:31:05.738 - 00:31:31.436, Speaker A: You think that if coins don't really have any cash flow and they don't really have any monetary premium per se, but they're just the kind of coins that for some reason the trading community just loves to speculate on XRP and the korean market or potentially injective or some of these coins that the trading volume doesn't really align with everything else. But is that a form of value?
00:31:31.620 - 00:32:14.842, Speaker B: I guess you can view it as playing blackjack, a casino where you just, over time you eventually just bleed all the money out. It can keep going for a while. And I mean, yeah, there's like, you can argue there's an economic need to be able to like speculate on these coins and people just take risk and swap p and l with each other, but without like some sort of long term value creation or like a lot of long term value creation is enabled through like these like legal covenants that equities have or through, you know, like actual sustained inflows or just like. Yeah, just good to economics without that, then, like, they're destined to go to zero on some time frame.
00:32:14.978 - 00:32:43.814, Speaker A: Yeah. I want to put this tweet up by Frankie from paradigm BC. He says today proves yet again there is nothing in crypto that comes close to the product market fit of users wanting to trade tokens. It is a prerequisite to building a function ecosystem. So, like, this is kind of, you know, along the lines of what we're talking about, where there is a product market fit. You know, it's blackjack. Blackjack is played in casinos around the world.
00:32:43.814 - 00:33:09.566, Speaker A: I'm not sure that it goes to zero. Like the idea of blackjack and playing blackjack. If you manage to be blackjack the game, then if people are just betting on it and you're just getting like some tiny rake on that, maybe there's a casino gambling premium here. Like, whoever invented roulette or blackjack, I.
00:33:09.590 - 00:33:39.376, Speaker C: Used to think it was very much a bug, that there's no way to value bitcoin or even ethereum or any of these other l two s, but it's actually sort of like a feature. I just love that Silicon Valley clip of, like, the second we have revenue, the second you can put a multiple on this thing, it's never going to be enough. And by just having this all be, like, abstracted away and obfuscated, there's so much more love for speculation when there's no tangible fundamentals to value these things off of.
00:33:39.560 - 00:33:49.804, Speaker D: I totally understand that view. And Jordy, you mentioned earlier that you don't really see a bull market happening anytime soon. I don't see all season happening. Or Vicki said he doesn't see all season happening.
00:33:50.464 - 00:33:51.096, Speaker A: What do you think?
00:33:51.120 - 00:33:59.600, Speaker D: I can actually catalyze these things because surely if we do see a next cycle, is it going to be led by actual apps?
00:33:59.712 - 00:34:00.364, Speaker B: But.
00:34:02.784 - 00:34:13.964, Speaker D: What do you think will actually bring more users? Is it purely just going to be trading what needs to happen for you to be more on board with the risk on train?
00:34:14.704 - 00:34:48.840, Speaker A: Well, I think when the supply gets better after these government tokens, I think it was like 30, 40,000 BTC need to get sold off and some of these can clear out in Q one. I'm very bullish around the halvening. I think that's going to be a really good time, especially if there's ETH and BTC. Hopefully both of them have ETF's spot. ETF's at that point. I am cautiously optimistic around what happens next, for sure. Ultimately, if people see that there's money being made.
00:34:48.840 - 00:35:22.304, Speaker A: They come in, and the sad truth is, we've been seeing that as well. My Twitter followers have been going up for the first time in, I don't know, it's been like six months or something. They were kind of flat. And then now suddenly there's wave. And I've seen that our videos are also getting more views. And I think this is just a pure fact of numbers are going up and, you know, people are paying attention because they, they want to participate in that process. So the reflexivity is huge, and it's hard to underestimate that.
00:35:22.684 - 00:36:14.704, Speaker C: Yeah. Anecdotally, I can say that, you know, six months ago, if I said I was working in crypto and just meeting someone, complete disinterest, even, like, borderline disgust of, like, you know, isn't that dead scam? What are you doing? And now you're sort of starting to see that, like, change a little. Like, especially in more smarter circles, let's say, or more like, financially sophisticated circles with people like Larry Fink and blackrock making, like, such a huge bet on, you know, Larry Fink literally said, like, all of our products will be tokenized someday. I mean, that's a, that's a huge deal. And if he's saying that and theoretically believes it, and, like, people are going to take heart and think that there's actually, like, a technological future here. And I think we just saw some amazing regulations come out of the UK. I'm a little hazy on the specifics there, but it looks like the UK has, like, explicitly said we think blockchain technology will be, like, a core part of the future.
00:36:14.704 - 00:36:42.652, Speaker C: And they've even said that we think Defi could be a core part of the future as well. So I think we are seeing sentiment shift, and I think it is possible we can have a bull market just based on people, you know, liking and believing in bitcoin, that translating to ether in the future. And then who knows what happens with the rest of these coins? Who knows what even happens with Defi? I don't even think we need any of these use cases to succeed, for people to sort of adopt BTC as a different store of value relative to gold.
00:36:42.828 - 00:36:55.716, Speaker D: Do you think it's possible for the next bull to just be led by bitcoin and everything else, just not do anything? I mean, that would be Max Payne for Justin and I, but there is a possibility where that happens, right?
00:36:55.780 - 00:37:07.144, Speaker C: It's already been disproven, though, right? Because, like, bitcoin has gone up to 35k in Seoul, nothing has changed fundamentally about soul. Right? At least as far as I can tell. And it's going up. So it's sort of like this wealth effect.
00:37:07.484 - 00:37:34.226, Speaker A: You can't just choose one coin. Like, you have to make a basket. Like, even in the last, you know, crash, we saw matic at the time, it was. That was like, the huge over performer. You can't just pick one coin because no one is going to always get the right coin. So it's either bitcoin or, like, you know, a group basket of other stuff. And as a basket, it's not looking amazing as a basket.
00:37:34.410 - 00:37:55.402, Speaker C: Yeah, this is the. You're right, that's a good call out. And I think cherry picking soul is not fair because there will always be tokens that pump, whether it's a new meme coin, whether it's a chain that has the hot narrative of the day, whatever. But as you can see with this chart that thicky builds, coins are up, but certainly bitcoin is leading, so you make a great point there.
00:37:55.538 - 00:37:55.810, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:55.842 - 00:38:33.868, Speaker B: And also, like, one thing is, like, liquidity is so low now that, like, it doesn't take that much money to pump these. A lot of these coins. I think with Seoul, there's definitely been maybe a good amount, maybe like, $250 million of inflows. It was actually surprising. If you look at the coin shares report, like, where a lot of that money came from, there are a lot of, like, Solana, like, etps, like, in Brazil and Switzerland and Germany, that actually got, like, a substantial amount of inflows the past month. Maybe, like, close to $100 million of inflows. And I guess for a coin like Solana, that can move it a lot, given, like, the current liquidity conditions, do.
00:38:33.876 - 00:38:52.608, Speaker D: You think it's like a bull trap and altcoins are going to just continue to underperform until the supply overhang issue is resolved? Or do you think this is one of the signs that, okay, the market ties are turning, and maybe if it is time to go more risk on and, you know, place your bets. Or is that too optimistic?
00:38:52.776 - 00:39:05.600, Speaker B: That's a good question. I've been kind of humbled over the past week, so I'm, like, really not sure. I still think for the majority of all, it's, like, going to keep lagging. But, you know, I do think a select few can outperform.
00:39:05.752 - 00:39:06.040, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:06.072 - 00:39:14.474, Speaker D: But I guess that's because there's so little liquidity. Where there's not enough money to pump everything, there's only enough money to chase a few coins.
00:39:14.624 - 00:39:15.070, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:39:15.102 - 00:39:36.678, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And like, soul is nice because it's like, it's pump of four. It's got a lot of mind share and there's like a lot of sort of rails set up for retail that already as opposed to something like Tia. Like, there is no Tia ETP. It's not like listed on a bunch of exchanges. So it's just, you can see the, you know, the effect of that. Like, it's not really pumping as hard because it's only CT native people that can pump it.
00:39:36.806 - 00:40:37.574, Speaker A: Yeah, we saw like Kyle Samani and we have this tweet by Evan as well, kind of questioning it, but he says that he hasn't sold any soul. The question is, are these funds that have all of it gonna risk ground tripping once again and going like 90, 95% down for a second time? Like, imagine the lawsuits at that point. But he says he's never sold a single soul other than to buy an nft for nine soul. In a way, if you can get the community to just push price up and then you just hold on and try not to sell, especially if the leverage comes in. And we saw a lot of leverage during the last cycle. It was obvious that everything was over leveraged. The system had like positive funding rates, you know, sometimes extremely positive funding rates.
00:40:37.574 - 00:41:02.134, Speaker A: There was just putting money into nfts which were then treated as ETH. And then you're kind of like leveraging ETH through nfts. There's always, you know, crazy stuff going on and you. Yeah, like, if nobody's around to do anything, like, this cycle can keep going for some time. It's hard to know when it's going to stop. Cool. And with that, we'll do another degen of the week.
00:41:02.134 - 00:41:12.118, Speaker A: Since now that things are happening, potentially you guys have been degenering a bit more than when things were quiet. Justin, did you do anything degen?
00:41:12.286 - 00:41:42.832, Speaker C: I did, yeah. Very degen for me. So I had a small airdrop from Celestia and I bridged back, swapped it to ETH, and then I bought this new NFT by Snowfro, who, if you're not aware, he's the founder of art blocks and also the guy that made the chromie Squiggle, which is like, you know, still quite a valuable NFT. And he launched this new project. There's only 2000 of them and they're trading at very, I don't know, who knows if it's low, but they're trading at 0.8 ETH or so. That's about the price I bought it at.
00:41:42.832 - 00:42:02.850, Speaker C: Obviously not saying anyone should go out and buy this, but for folks that don't know, I interviewed Snowfro once and he gave me a squiggle for free. So I feel like it's my duty to support the guy in art blocks. And there's. Although this looks simple, there's some, like, elaborate on chain math behind it, which is cool. So that was my. My degen of the week.
00:42:02.922 - 00:42:04.666, Speaker D: And this is generative art, right?
00:42:04.850 - 00:42:08.578, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you guys like it? Is it. Would you say this is museum quality.
00:42:08.626 - 00:42:12.054, Speaker B: Or can you show us more of the pieces?
00:42:12.474 - 00:42:27.684, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, sure. So there's a ton of variety here. So you've got arrows and slant lines and different color patterns and. Yeah, single comment.
00:42:28.304 - 00:42:42.004, Speaker D: You seem a little confused when trying to explain this and why this has 0.8 ETH worth of value. Like, when do you think NFT buyers will show up again? I mean, obviously you bought this, but that's because you got a stimulus check, right? From Celestia.
00:42:42.424 - 00:42:43.244, Speaker C: Correct.
00:42:44.504 - 00:42:54.286, Speaker D: When do you think nfts will ever show signs of life? I still like nfts, but I'm not really sure what the actual catalyst is.
00:42:54.430 - 00:43:06.230, Speaker A: Well, we saw blur starting to do well, right? It was on that chart, like, number three or number four there. So the farmers of blur are not going to get totally buried.
00:43:06.422 - 00:43:28.466, Speaker C: I'm not really. I don't know, Tyke. I wish I knew. I feel like I'm really the wrong guy for that because I'm always, like, middle curving everything. I feel like. I feel like the left curve take, which is probably right, is that like if bitcoin pumps, if Ethereum pumps, if we have another bull market, everyone's going to look at something like crypto punks and say, hold on a minute. This was created so many years ago.
00:43:28.466 - 00:43:46.692, Speaker C: It's the first on chain art. We think on chain is the future. Like, buy, buy, buy. And that is what I think the left curve take is. And that's probably the most probable outcome. But the middle curve take is like, what do you mean? You can just right click save this. And that is true.
00:43:46.692 - 00:43:48.652, Speaker C: So I don't know. We'll see.
00:43:48.828 - 00:43:51.764, Speaker D: How about you, Jordy? Have you done anything degen this week?
00:43:51.924 - 00:44:24.288, Speaker A: I did do one thing that was pretty degen. So there's these non liquidation loans, and for people who are not familiar. So this is different than Aave and compound. This is a design where you borrow against your token, but you can't get liquidated, so you can just not show up if you want. At the end you basically get a free put option. So whoever is lending you has to be confident that they're setting a floor for a price because they might have to take your collateral in exchange for that price that they gave you. So I decided to play around with this.
00:44:24.288 - 00:44:51.720, Speaker A: And I put five hundred k at like a 93% LTV. So I'm basically putting a floor for, in this case, M and T at 93%. So it's trading at, let's say 37.5 cents. I am basically buying, I'm giving people thirty five cents of USDT and they don't have to pay it back. Like if they want, I'll just keep the m and T. And I've bought it at $0.35.
00:44:51.720 - 00:44:56.244, Speaker A: So it's pretty Djen like, the LTV ratio is not a normal ratio here.
00:44:56.544 - 00:45:01.604, Speaker C: So this is your SPF moment. Sell me all the MNT you have at fuck off.
00:45:02.044 - 00:45:03.612, Speaker A: Thirty five cents. Thirty five cents.
00:45:03.628 - 00:45:05.704, Speaker C: Thirty five cents. Thirty five cents.
00:45:06.444 - 00:45:15.116, Speaker A: Not all of it. There's five hundred k. I think some people have started nibbling. We'll see how much there is by the time people want to look at it.
00:45:15.140 - 00:45:24.144, Speaker C: But is this liquidity per duration or is this your total liquidity? So it's 400k for seven days, 400k again for 330. Or how does that work?
00:45:24.604 - 00:45:53.714, Speaker A: So there's more than 400. 400 is like the maximum. Like one single wallet I'm allowing to take. But you do have to choose. So you have to choose. Do you want a seven day or longer term? Obviously, options have time money. So the shorter the option, the higher LTV I'm willing to give out for the loan because there's less time for things to move around much.
00:45:53.714 - 00:46:04.442, Speaker A: But I thought this was an interesting semi degen. I think it's degen enough. 92.8% floor fuels Degen.
00:46:04.578 - 00:46:17.010, Speaker D: Yeah, you're effectively selling a put option at like thirty five cents. And if the price goes lower, then you're effectively spying at that price. Very dgen I'm a fan of that. How about you, Tikki? Have you done anything?
00:46:17.042 - 00:46:27.834, Speaker B: DeGeN one thing was I want to ask Jody, did you price the option when trying to set these loan rates? What kind of? Definitely not.
00:46:29.094 - 00:46:59.360, Speaker A: So in this case, like, there is a large treasury and you can look at the outstanding, like the market cap and look at the treasury ratio with the market cap. So I think around, like in the low thirties, the treasury itself is, you know, you can rage, quit and break the piggy bank and it'll be around that price. So I thought I would put like, a higher, higher price than that. Like, a little bit higher. And, you know, it's 500k. Worst case, I'll buy some.
00:46:59.512 - 00:47:12.524, Speaker C: I mean, this is just like. This is the best ad for Jordy I've ever seen. If you're a project founder and you're building something awesome, like, this is the guy you need in your corner. He's doing the opposite of everyone else. He's, like, willing to buy. Everyone else is dumping.
00:47:13.984 - 00:47:33.742, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember I was talking to a founder, like. Like, a year ago, and I. I bought some tokens from. From the team, and I sent the money. I sent, like, the USDT, whatever it was, and I just never asked for the tokens. Like, I think I remember, like, a few months later, and he's like, man, this is really bullish. The fact that you didn't even, like, wanna transaction.
00:47:33.838 - 00:47:34.870, Speaker B: You're clearly not selling.
00:47:34.902 - 00:47:46.224, Speaker A: Like, you don't even, like, wanna. At some point, I got. I got hold of them. But, yeah, eventually, like, a long, long time later.
00:47:50.204 - 00:47:52.704, Speaker D: How about you, thiki? Have you done anything, djen?
00:47:53.164 - 00:48:03.436, Speaker B: Nothing on crypto, but I've been. I've been in the market for buying a scimitar for one of my friend's birthdays. So I have to shop around some sword shops looking for a scimitar to buy.
00:48:03.580 - 00:48:09.028, Speaker A: Are they all legal, or is there, like, a level at which, you know, it's too dangerous as a weapon?
00:48:09.196 - 00:48:14.732, Speaker B: We were actually looking into this. Justin told me that, like, swords used outside of the kitchen are illegal in New York.
00:48:14.828 - 00:48:25.660, Speaker C: So, yeah, there's some restrictions on length and width of the blade and, like, how it is handled. Like, I. I'm not too familiar with it, but there's a lot of stuff going on.
00:48:25.812 - 00:48:28.584, Speaker A: It's the motion of the ocean. That's. That's.
00:48:31.644 - 00:48:37.024, Speaker D: Is your friend in the swords? Is there some sentimental meaning behind this gift? Or, like, not really.
00:48:37.444 - 00:48:41.584, Speaker B: You know, I feel like the scimitar capital give should be, like, an actual scimitar.
00:48:42.604 - 00:48:46.804, Speaker C: We should not beep out the name. But it's a very, very notable person in the crypto space.
00:48:46.844 - 00:48:47.744, Speaker B: Let's say that.
00:48:48.324 - 00:49:18.448, Speaker D: Well, okay, so I've heard all the djens. You know, Justin, you know, you got a free stimulus check, bought some nfts. You didn't really use your own money, so that's not gonna be good enough for me, Vicki, unless you're buying a scimitar and flying to New York with it. Like, I don't think that cuts it for me. The Jordi, you know, allocating half a million dollars to, you know, buy a token. I think that's very, very impressive. So I think this week's Djinn of the week goes to Jordi.
00:49:18.448 - 00:49:19.764, Speaker D: Congrats, Jordy.
00:49:20.144 - 00:49:28.684, Speaker A: All right. It's worth it. It's worth it for. If I get dumped on by. At $0.35. It was worth it for. For the DJ of the week.
00:49:30.384 - 00:49:30.696, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:30.720 - 00:49:33.336, Speaker D: I'm curious, like, God forbid, if m.
00:49:33.360 - 00:49:37.230, Speaker B: And t goes below $0.35, like a curious to see how fast that gets armed.
00:49:37.342 - 00:49:51.114, Speaker A: It will get armed. I'll just leave it out. It's okay. We'll see. I think because it's a new chain and there's not that many people that have bridged over. It might be pretty inefficient. It might just kind of give an arbitrage for a while.
00:49:52.174 - 00:50:12.594, Speaker D: So one question I had is we talked a lot about l one s and l two s as money, and seems like, obviously, you're bullish MNT. Like, what is the bull case for the MNT token? Do you think it can be money, or can it have, or do you think it's a cash flow token, or what is your take there?
00:50:12.934 - 00:50:56.854, Speaker A: Yeah. So if l two is successful, like we've seen with arbitrum and at some points, base stuff like that, you can have a cash flow in the nine figures, potentially between what you're charging users for fees and what you're actually spending. And as fees end up getting cheaper and cheaper to check into l one with 48, 44, et cetera, like proto dank sharding, I think the margins can get pretty good. And also, if you have a great ecosystem, you can start just charging higher fees if you want. So that's one way to get revenue. I think for M and T, there's other ways to get revenue, because it's not just an l two, it's a product suite. So the mantel ETH, the meth is coming out soon.
00:50:56.854 - 00:51:32.150, Speaker A: It's similar to Lido. Like, whatever money lido gets, like this, 5%, that'll be the same revenue for M and T as well. And I think there'll be, by the end, four, five, six different revenue streams. Another one could be like jvs with apps. So one of the things that I was looking at was potentially having these on chain games. I don't know if you've seen, but these are starting to kind of pop up now. I think scroll had an interesting one where you're, like, you're trying to negotiate against, like, a SPF type character, and whoever gets, like, the right negotiation wins.
00:51:32.150 - 00:51:59.656, Speaker A: I think these like massive multiplayer online kind of gambling games where it's like a poker game, but instead of ten people at the table, it could be like 1000 people. And you design like a nice strategy mechanic with game theory in it. Those can, those can really pop off. But yeah, I think that a chain could potentially do a jv with game designers and share revenue. So a lot of things can lead to that path.
00:51:59.800 - 00:52:30.644, Speaker D: So do you think these l two s like arbitrary optimism? Are they going to be viewed as cash flow assets? And how do you value these things? Is it simple as ethereum is a $200 million market cap. Arbitrum has x amounts of usage. Arbitrum can be 10% of each market cap. Do you think people will start to value it like that? Or do you think there's going to be these quote unquote worthless governance tokens until people can actually reap the benefits of the cash flows that they generate?
00:52:30.764 - 00:53:12.288, Speaker A: I think the 10% of ETH type of model is not very sophisticated. And it is a lot easier to look at these tokens as cash flow tokens. And a lot of people have done this analysis, you know, looking at how much revenue these l two s are making. And, you know, potentially in the future they could just increase fees, decide like where the right ratio is because you do have to pay developers, you do have to pay people to update. You know, we look at some of the things you have to deploy as well, like chain, chain link. Chainlink is expensive. It is not a cheap product to have on your chain.
00:53:12.288 - 00:53:32.924, Speaker A: And because it's kind of blue chip, you, you sort of need it. Like, you know, what oracles are you going to use if not, and they ask for millions of dollars for each chain. So link marines aside, like there is some cash flow potential at some of these things. I don't know if it's, you know, whatever, 12 billion, but there is potential there.
00:53:33.544 - 00:53:38.884, Speaker C: Ether scan shakedown, right? They charge a couple million dollars after they get you hooked on, on their product.
00:53:39.624 - 00:54:15.944, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess like Ava labs decided they're not going to pay that anymore, but I think most projects still will pay that. And, you know, fair enough if it's one or 2 million, but Chainlink is substantially more than that. And then you have to incentivize the, you know, the operators as well. So it's a chunky one. Let's, let's wrap up there. Hopefully everybody enjoyed the episode. And yeah, we'll see if next week we'll be with Austin from Solana, but we'll get him on soon enough to take the counterpoint of what we talked about today.
00:54:15.944 - 00:54:19.504, Speaker A: And, yeah. Hope you guys enjoy it. Take care.
