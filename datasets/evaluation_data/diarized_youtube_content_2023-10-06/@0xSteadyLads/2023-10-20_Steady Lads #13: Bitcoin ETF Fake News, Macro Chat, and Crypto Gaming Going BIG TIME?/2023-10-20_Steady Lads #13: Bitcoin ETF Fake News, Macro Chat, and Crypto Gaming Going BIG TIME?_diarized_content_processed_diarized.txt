00:00:20.760 - 00:00:41.204, Speaker A: Welcome to another episode of Steady Lads. As usual. We have Thikki, junior busboy at Scimitar Capital. We have Taiki, the humble farmer. We have Justin here, the CEO of Astaria, and myself, Jordy, the CIO of Cellini and chief alchemist at Mantle. So it's been quite a week. We're starting to see a little bit of volatility.
00:00:41.204 - 00:00:44.408, Speaker A: Dustin, how have you been spending the last days?
00:00:44.536 - 00:01:26.468, Speaker B: Yeah, I've had an amazing few days. So Coinbase Ventures held a summit here in Malibu, which is pretty close by to me, in Los Angeles. And it's just a very inspiring few days getting to meet Brian Armstrong, meet these other amazing builders, hear what Coinbase is excited about and what other people are excited about. I think if you spend a lot of your time interacting with crypto folks on Twitter or just digitally, you don't remember how much is actually getting built. That's really innovative and really special and really cool. And so going to things like this is really nice for recharging your conviction in the crypto space and believing that, you know, we're actually here for a reason. There's actually something here.
00:01:26.468 - 00:01:30.628, Speaker B: And it's not just number go up, number go down. So I had an amazing time.
00:01:30.716 - 00:01:35.772, Speaker A: How many of you guys watched the documentary? The Coinbase documentary?
00:01:35.868 - 00:01:37.020, Speaker C: I haven't watched it.
00:01:37.132 - 00:01:38.372, Speaker B: I've seen it. Yeah, it was great.
00:01:38.468 - 00:01:55.574, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, they. They tried to charge people. There was like a cost when they first released it. So they were asking you to pay to watch their own propaganda, which I found a little bit bizarre. I think after six months, they eventually released it free. So it's free now on YouTube. And I watched it a couple weeks ago.
00:01:55.574 - 00:02:26.310, Speaker A: It's definitely very favorable to the regime type of documentary, but it was cool. It was cool to see how a company like this, one of the most important companies in the space, got built. And I liked some of the behind the scenes, you know, co founder stuff with Fred, and then he. He goes to paradigm, but he's still, like, involved in the. It was interesting. Would more people have seen it if it wasn't. If it wasn't, like, pay to play that?
00:02:26.342 - 00:03:05.874, Speaker B: Yeah, the doc was awesome. I'd recommend people spend the four or $5 on Amazon prime to watch it. It was great. And I think it, you know, based on getting to chat with Brian for, like, quite a bit of time over this summit, like, I actually think it portrayed him pretty well. I can confidently say he's an extremely nice person. He's very down to earth and it's just amazing to get to talk to someone that's gone through this journey of starting a company from nothing. When no one believed in bitcoin, there was nothing else in the crypto space to taking company public and what that life journey is like and how that changes his experience.
00:03:05.874 - 00:03:10.108, Speaker B: It was just amazing to pick his brain on that.
00:03:10.206 - 00:03:10.480, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:03:10.512 - 00:03:23.644, Speaker A: Yeah, he does seem very down to earth. I've never met him, but, uh, you know who else seems down to earth? Vicky. I mean, normally he's got some japanese robe, but today he's got the trucker hat. Is this, like, from a marijuana store or. What's going on, Vicki, what's this outfit?
00:03:26.264 - 00:03:29.496, Speaker D: I just woke up, so my hair is all messed. So I said, we're ahead.
00:03:29.640 - 00:03:46.760, Speaker A: All right, seems right down to earth. Vicki, have you been trading these insane bitcoin ETF news? I know everyone's wondering because they normally, like, you have a house alarm that goes off whenever there was, like, a headline like this. Were you. Were you, like, jumping on the trend? Did you get caught on the. On the false news?
00:03:46.872 - 00:04:07.502, Speaker D: I actually woke up, like, pretty late that day, and it was at, like, 29. I actually didn't trade it that well. I slept through it well, I saw it. I saw it go to 30.5, and I saw the tweet, and I was like, it's probably bullshit, but, like, you never know. So, yeah, no participation on that movie from Scimitar. Yeah, I didn't buy it, but, like, yeah, I didn't trade it.
00:04:07.598 - 00:04:46.236, Speaker C: Yeah, I had a question to you guys, because I feel like the price action in the bitcoin or the price action of bitcoin is pretty interesting. Because, I mean, like thikki said, like, I mean, it was bullshit, right? It's like, you know, this coin telegraph, intern, just click send and, you know, send price up 10% and whatnot. But if you look at the ripple, Gandalf, when Ripple won its case against the SEC, bitcoin pumped, and then it retraced its entire movement in 24 hours. And then a couple of weeks later, the grayscale news, right? When they won this case against SEC, bitcoin pumped, and then within 48 hours, it retraced. But obviously, I mean, this is bullshit news. But bitcoin has retained its gains. It hasn't retraced.
00:04:46.236 - 00:05:04.742, Speaker C: So I feel like, is there, like, some trend shift? Like, is the tape changing to bullish? There's this theory around, okay, like, now the market is going to front run the actual bitcoin ETF launch. Do you guys actually believe in that? Or do you think that it's just like shorts getting blown up and markets are going to just retrace in the next couple of weeks?
00:05:04.838 - 00:05:50.466, Speaker A: I think you're right to pinpoint the fact that it hasn't fully retraced. And bitcoin has been healthy ever since that fake news. And from a game theory standpoint, it's one of those moments where people who have been on the sidelines are starting to be too scared of waiting too long and they're looking at each other and everyone's realizing that there is buying demand. They saw that there is the fact that when this ETF does come out, there will be a candle. I think some of the fundamental buyers, potentially some of the macro guys, we've seen some really strong traditional finance people backing bitcoin. Larry Fink and Paul Tutor joins part two. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a confluence right now.
00:05:50.466 - 00:05:55.906, Speaker A: It is making the ETH BTC ratio looks like a DWF coin.
00:05:56.010 - 00:06:23.768, Speaker B: Just on that note, for Jordy and thicke, the expert traders here, like does whats happening now make the ETF more likely to be sell the news? Right. Like the markets pricing this in that this is guaranteed or theres a 90% chance this happens in January or February or something like that. And weve already had the news, right. It turned out to be fake, but we had it. Does this make the next time it's announced when maybe it's real more likely to be sell the news?
00:06:23.856 - 00:06:43.934, Speaker A: I don't think. You think? I don't think it's sell the news. I think it's just, it can overshoot. Previously, you know, it was at 26, 27, it goes to 30, 32, it's okay. Like it's not overshooting now. It's already going to be at 30 and then it goes to 35. You know, it can, it can short term overshoot, but I don't think it's going to be a selling use type of event.
00:06:43.934 - 00:06:44.942, Speaker A: What do you think, Thiki?
00:06:45.038 - 00:07:01.646, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with you. I think increases the odds that it overshoots now that people are already positioned for it. I don't think people are gonna sell until the inflows come in. So in between the time it gets approved and it actually starts trading, I could see it just easily grinding up.
00:07:01.750 - 00:07:30.754, Speaker A: I think the first time we see somebody talk about ETH ETF as being the next step after the bitcoin one does get approved. And I'm not talking about the bankless guys. We need someone non ethnic, ETH maxi to talk about it. But that'll be the signal, I think, to put the bottom in on the ETH chart, which we can take a look at it here. And I'm a bit surprised of. It's tapping on 0.05. Yeah.
00:07:31.134 - 00:07:32.914, Speaker C: If you go to ultrasound money.
00:07:34.854 - 00:07:35.142, Speaker D: If.
00:07:35.158 - 00:07:47.726, Speaker C: You look at on chain activity, we're basically back to post FTX levels. No one's using a chain. Right. Maybe you can argue that. Oh, you know, people are using l two s, people are using other chains. But, you know, I don't. I don't really believe in that.
00:07:47.726 - 00:08:13.770, Speaker C: I just think that on chain lacks users. And in this environment, you know, the ETH is deflationary. Meme is no longer there, of course, like, you know, ETH inflation is lower than bitcoin inflation. But, you know, it's. If ether is community money, you know, like, the narrative weakens a little bit. And, you know, last time we had this level of on chain activity, ether was at, you know, like 1000, $201,300. I wouldn't be that surprised if it gets down there.
00:08:13.770 - 00:08:34.666, Speaker C: But I think buyers will step in. I think people think that 2024, but generally going to be able to share. I think that's where consensus is. So I'm not, like, doomering ETH. I mean, I still like ETH, but I kind of like to see it as. Yeah, like, maybe this suffers for the next couple of weeks. I'm curious, like, where do you guys think bitcoin dominance goes from here? It's like, yeah, 52%.
00:08:34.666 - 00:08:39.550, Speaker C: It's kind of on a rampage. Uh, like, where do you guys think that, you know, it's going to top?
00:08:39.622 - 00:08:43.686, Speaker A: I haven't heard that name in a long time. Bitcoin dominance.
00:08:43.830 - 00:08:46.822, Speaker D: Yeah, I was pulling up the chart myself. Just take a look.
00:08:46.918 - 00:08:48.190, Speaker A: It's multi year high.
00:08:48.262 - 00:08:51.350, Speaker C: Yeah, it's chatting up. And this is with stablecoin market cap, too.
00:08:51.462 - 00:09:44.312, Speaker A: So, yeah, I just don't like this metric because there's more and more coins that, you know, you have Ethan, you have everybody else, but then everybody else gang ETH is able to keep punching, but then you guys got more and more random coins joining the other side. Every week there's more icos. So I don't love the dominance percentage, but it is saying something that it's at this multi year high. And to your point about ETH, we're around a year after the anniversary of the merge, and I was quite outspoken as being contrarian against some of the narratives at the time. I did say that ETH was going to end up being inflationary. Forever because the increase in staking was going to increase the supply. And then the l two dominance starting to increase would also move activity there.
00:09:44.312 - 00:10:10.152, Speaker A: So Gui is low, issuance is higher, we have more and more people staking. And also I had said that staking yield would be five and then four and then three. And at some point we get to two. I think that's where it bottoms. You know, those narratives, I think, were good for building hype, but ultimately, the community money needs to decide for itself what. What form it takes. And I'm still bullish ETH.
00:10:10.152 - 00:10:14.256, Speaker A: I just think those old narratives were a bit over the top. Yeah.
00:10:14.280 - 00:10:55.100, Speaker B: I've been harboring this, like, theory that all of the scaling for ether could be bearish price, right. Especially with 48, 44. Like, if we didn't have any l two s and people were still using ethereum today, like, presumably ETH would be deflationary right now with no l two s. Now that doesn't necessarily mean, though, that not creating l two s is more bullish. Right? Like, there's this weird balance between, do we want a lot of users with cheap fees and scalability? But if the fees are cheap, if we can scale, well, then of course ETH is going to be inflationary. It's sort of like ETH is now in this, like, deadly middle zone. So, like, Solana is in this ultra cheap, very inflationary side.
00:10:55.100 - 00:11:22.700, Speaker B: Bitcoin, or rather ether used to be on this, like, deflationary side. But now ETH has moved to this middle ground, which generally, like, I feel like in business, you don't want to be. Right. Like, you want to be on one or two, one side of the coin. You want to be very inflationary, very cheap, or deflationary, low issuance, but, like, expensive and not scalable, like BTC or ETH how it used to be. So, yeah, it's a very interesting spot to be. I'm curious if they're able to thread the needle with Ethereum.
00:11:22.812 - 00:12:15.030, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great point. I think we can pull up, actually, I made this point exactly a year ago, and you can look at some of the memes that I used to describe exactly this point that you're making, that it's sort of in the middle and it needs to choose what it is. Yeah. To your point, Justin, this was a meme I made a year ago during the merge, kind of foreseeing that potentially ETH would get stuck in this middle zone. It says, Confucius say, be a great Batman or a great Buddha. Don't try to be both at once and then for 48, 44, which is something that, you know, it's still, we don't know when the date's gonna be, but, you know, the cheaper gas gets on l two s and the less they have to pay to check in, you know, it starts, it starts to make a different economy and those apps become more valuable. So everyone's kind of being more bullish on the app layer.
00:12:15.030 - 00:12:30.594, Speaker A: Two tokens, their margins will be better, potentially. And ultimately, this is not necessarily bullish for ETH in terms of the gas case. So the community cases is maybe still interesting.
00:12:31.134 - 00:13:36.172, Speaker B: This strikes me as there's a conflict of interest between Ethereum core developers and ethereum holders, or ether holders. Governance happens entirely off chain for Ethereum, for better or worse. Like, a lot of people think that's good. Like, I think it is probably too, because I don't necessarily trust ether holders to vote. But presumably, like, there would be a lot more conversation about if 4844 is the right path forward, if like, trying to throw all of our resources at l two is the right path forward, because, you know, it just like, to your point, it just changes the economics, right? Like we have to increased demand by orders of magnitude at the l two layer than we would have had to on l one. And I'm surprised that no one has talked about the potential bearishness for the price of ether if 4844 goes through, which it will, it seems like no one's talking about it. There's been no dialogue with the community, and Ethereum is decentralized, but it's a centralized party that's actually doing the development with which a lot of people don't realize are talking about.
00:13:36.268 - 00:14:26.984, Speaker A: I'm curious to see what's going to happen, and I think we have quite a few of these situations in Ethereum where they're not win win. Like one site's going to win, one site's going to lose. And another example is the proposal to increase the maximum ETH from 32 per validator to 1024, which sounds great from a user standpoint. It makes a lot of sense. You don't have to keep rebalancing your ETH and running a ton of validators. But then the whole validator industry, which is quite a large contingent in the ETH world, will only need one validator for every 80 validators or 50 validators, whatever it is, so they won't be able to have a huge business anymore. So we'll see what wins out when it comes to these win versus lose dynamics.
00:14:27.064 - 00:15:08.190, Speaker B: Yeah, we talk about how all, all of these chains are decentralized. And I mean, to some degree they are, right? Like, I do believe, you know, like, our ether won't be seized, right? But the four of us all have, like, a relatively decent, you know, side, like following in the community and like a voice, we have more of a voice than the average person. But if any one of us wanted to sort of, you know, throughout EIP 4844, like, you know, push that narrative. Not that that's what I want to do. Like, we would get nowhere. Right? Like, you have to be in that small core dev circle and, you know, you have to be really in the know to even have a voice there, which is super interesting. Same is true with every other chain, with BTC, Solana, whatever you're looking at.
00:15:08.190 - 00:15:10.766, Speaker B: But yeah, it's interesting.
00:15:10.870 - 00:15:55.898, Speaker A: I think they know that there's the foundation side, which is maybe like less people, but very idealistic. And then there's the, the users that are, you know, maybe we're seeing that now with Lido, where users like Lido, it makes sense. But then the pristine foundation is kind of pushing back on the risks of the protocol, and we're seeing some of those voices come out, and like you said, they're much more impactful than anybody else. Cool. Should we talk a little bit about the macro situation? I think that's one topic that our listeners have been asking about, and it is a very interesting time in macro. Right. Haven't talked about macro in a while because it's sort of been in this range bound mode.
00:15:55.898 - 00:16:31.934, Speaker A: I think now the moves are starting to be very large. I'm surprised every day I wake up and I see that overnight stocks are moving like, you know, percents, two, 3%. So volatility has picked up. It is usually like one up and one down. So people who are buying the dips and selling the rips have been doing well on equities, but when it comes to bonds, it's completely the opposite. It's just been one way down. And if you listen to any person in the know, they're all saying that the concern right now for the economy and for everything else is ultimately the treasury market.
00:16:31.934 - 00:16:40.294, Speaker A: Do you guys follow the treasury market at all, or is this a kind of like a macro board?
00:16:40.594 - 00:17:13.930, Speaker C: I mean, I follow it loosely, obviously, the rates staying higher for longer, but maybe that's only shorter term treasuries, like one month to, let's say, one or two years, around 5%. So it's a sign that the market thinks we're going to be higher for longer. But then recently, the longer the 20 year treasury, the 30 year treasury is just chatting up to 5%. Do you think that's mainly due to the market pricing and future growth and higher inflation expectations, or do you, do you just think that it's because there's like just no demand for these long term treasuries?
00:17:14.042 - 00:17:56.874, Speaker A: There's some demand, but there's more supply and the supply keeps coming. And I think the whole approach towards containing inflation has been wrong from day one, and I've been very outspoken. This was never going to work. Basically, you're giving rich people who have billions of dollars 5% yield, and that's a lot of money. I mean, with Mantle, we're starting to get this yield on the treasury and we're just looking at the daily number that we're getting is just absurd. And I can only imagine the billionaires out there, the institutions that are getting 5% yield, that's not going to fix inflation. Ultimately, it's going to reduce, maybe people getting mortgages and that's not going to make people happy either.
00:17:56.874 - 00:18:31.184, Speaker A: But the ultimate solution to inflation was always going to be austerity tax hikes and ideally corporate tax hikes. That's the reverse of what happened that caused the inflation. And you put the genie back in the bottle that way, trying to do this great stuff we're seeing. Argentina has they just increased their rate hike from 95% to 130%. I'm not making this up. It's at 130. Theoretically, if raising rates was going to fix inflation, they would have fixed it by now.
00:18:31.184 - 00:18:33.226, Speaker A: I don't know that that's the right solution.
00:18:33.330 - 00:18:59.178, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, Lynn Alden, I really enjoy listening to her takes there and I know she, early days in the fed hiking, she shared this quote, and I'm not sure if she came up with it or if she heard it elsewhere, but when your debt is higher than GDP, when you raise rates, it's actually inflationary. And you're creating this inflationary loop because, like, to your point, you're paying out. You know, everyone's getting more money when you raise rates. It's not as though everyone's getting less.
00:18:59.266 - 00:19:36.942, Speaker A: No, she, she nailed it on the head. And I think me and her were both like the only two warning people a year ago that this was not going to be the solution. And I think now it's playing out and we will eventually need something else to happen. And the first sign that we're getting into trouble is not the short end, but it's the back end. So the fact that the Fed is losing control. I kind of put out a tweet thread talking about this because it is worth everyone's attention noticing that the Fed itself, they're starting to put some quotes up here. So the Dallas Fed president said they might not need to raise rates again.
00:19:36.942 - 00:20:37.796, Speaker A: And it's not because inflation numbers are better, but it's because they're seeing that rates are going up by themselves, the back of the curve. They can't control it. So I'm saying that the Fed is starting to poo poo in the pampers because they're babies. They don't know what they're doing, but they're starting to get scared and they're realizing they need to maybe pause and not keep raising rates and try to fix the back end of the curve. Ultimately, if nothing happens on the austerity side and nothing happens on the tax hike side, I think what we're going to see is what happened in Japan just a couple of days ago, which is they will start having to do operations and buy bonds because nobody else is buying them and they keep supplying them because the national debt keeps going up. Ultimately, that means yield curve control, and that is very bad for the dollar and quite good for alternatives to the dollar, which hopefully crypto is one of.
00:20:37.900 - 00:21:27.260, Speaker B: Jordy, can I ask you what you've outlaid now? Is that your base case or is that just a very plausible bad outcome that we could see? Because in my mind, the base case for everyone really should be that, like, things continue on and it's fine, right? Like, the dollar is actually strong. There really isn't an alternative unless you talk about gold, crypto, et cetera, which is not mainstream yet. And so, like, for me, it seems like you would have to think that, like, the base case is rates end up coming down, we settle into, like, normal market behavior. Yes, our debt is ballooning and we're not making as much money with tax receipts. But, you know, like, there's no, you know, I've heard tremoth say this on all in. There's no, like, turning point where debt to GDP is just so bad that everything collapses. So do you think this is an imminent threat? This time is different.
00:21:27.260 - 00:21:35.396, Speaker B: Something's changing here. There's really a paradigm shift. Or is your base case actually, we're fine. Things are going to chug along and whatnot.
00:21:35.540 - 00:22:21.236, Speaker A: I think. I think it's more likely than not that this happens, but it's 60 40, so it's not an overwhelming base case. I think that the next steps are quite overwhelming in the sense of the Fed will very, very soon start changing their tone, not only talking about stopping raises, but trying to say that, yeah, maybe like, it won't be for longer. Maybe like we will cut at some point because they'll try to bring the back end of the back end of the curve down by bringing the front down, and they'll try to just shift the whole thing. But if they start to lose control and it steepens, that will basically, you know, increase the chances of a recession massively. And the next step is probably stimulus buying bonds. QE.
00:22:21.236 - 00:22:38.048, Speaker A: And we've seen QE. Even the youngsters among us, including the guys co hosting with me, have seen QE a couple of times now. It's not going to be a new paradigm for even young investors, I think. So we know what happens next. Yeah.
00:22:38.056 - 00:22:50.296, Speaker B: I mean, it's, it's also their desire. Right. Like, I think, uh, the Fed wants to do everything they can to stimulate the economy. Like, they don't actually want to be higher for longer. Right. They're trying to find every excuse to not do that. It seems like.
00:22:50.400 - 00:23:20.880, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. In his, you know, heart of hearts, Jay Powell is a dove. He can talk the talk, but when there's going to be a reason to, uh, to change direction, he will do it very quickly. And I do think that we're in for some volatility in bonds, but also in the broader market. After having quite a quiet period for the last year or so, apart from the Silicon Valley bank, again, they smothered as soon as that started to appear.
00:23:21.032 - 00:23:51.460, Speaker C: What do you think this means for BTC and gold? Because in theory, on paper it should be bullish. Do you think that the big macro gurus are going to start to price this in and start to allocate more to BTC? Maybe 1% to 3% allocations. Even Larry Fink is going on tv saying, yeah, bitcoin is a flight to safety, which, coming from his mouth is pretty insane. But I guess he's also thinking about all the management fees that he can make from the eventual ETF that might be approved next year.
00:23:51.532 - 00:24:17.744, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the mid curvers are going to win out for a while, so bitcoin is going to do really well. I say mid krovers, because there are issues with bitcoin and the distribution of bitcoin and the long term security of bitcoin. Everything else has to get sorted out. But in the short term, it's just hard money. And all this FTX stuff creates again, like more barter for this. This is bitcoin. It's not crypto.
00:24:17.744 - 00:24:30.028, Speaker A: It's different. It's just a singular commodity. I'm less sympathetic to that than I used to be, but I think that it will have its moment in the sun, which we're already starting to see.
00:24:30.156 - 00:24:40.596, Speaker B: Are you ready to say that? I guess I'll pose this tavern. Are folks here ready to say that the bear market is almost over, if not already over for crypto specifically?
00:24:40.700 - 00:25:11.458, Speaker A: I think there's too much volatility on the macro side in the horizon, and I think all assets can have sell offs based on broader market issues. So I think China still has a real estate crisis to resolve. I think the US is the interest rate crisis. I think there's wars going on. We can have sell offs. So I don't think we're quite out of the woods. But there is sprinklings of hope starting to appear.
00:25:11.458 - 00:25:11.850, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:11.882 - 00:25:42.422, Speaker C: And I think Vicki said this in a tweet, and feel free to give more color. But, you know, whenever some altcoin sells off and people want to buy the dip, they have to sell something to, like, buy, like, fund those purchases. Right. And if people are using either to fund those purchases, then maybe either BTC just goes down. Like, is that still your view, thiki? Or, like, do you think that, like, eventually the future is bright enough to just say, you know, like, square, like, you know, just starts accumulating and, like, holding, like, where you're at on that?
00:25:42.518 - 00:25:42.918, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:43.006 - 00:26:18.232, Speaker D: I had this tweet last night that said I thought the fixed income markets were similar to the altcoin markets, and that there's just a lot of issuance in the next few months, and there's essentially no buyer, which will be, like, immense sell pressure on ETH in the next few months. I really agree with Jordy's takes in that. Like, I do think time wise, then, the bear market should be soon, maybe in the next six to 18 months. But path wise, depending on how events play out, we could easily go down before we go up. So even though the bear market might be ending soon, it might not be clear just to go long from here and just mark the bottom.
00:26:18.368 - 00:26:57.778, Speaker B: It's very tough to be an ETH bowl now. Honestly, even just having this conversation with you guys, it's very clear that the narrative, if the narrative is BTC, ETF approval, if the narrative is endless, money printing, inflation, market turmoil, the flight to quality, truly is BTC. And conversations like this make me re question my. My thesis, which is more ETH denominated of course, maybe that means the ETH BTC bottom is in. I don't know. But, um, you know, having this conversation and then being at the Coinbase venture summit and hearing, um, chatter from very notable people about, uh, being more. So BTC bulls.
00:26:57.778 - 00:27:02.738, Speaker B: Um, it's, it's having me question my thesis, but I think it's a little too late to swap back now.
00:27:02.906 - 00:27:48.564, Speaker A: Here's a way that I thought about it this morning as I was, you know, waking up and having, having some shower thoughts. It feels to me that right now. So bitcoin is the sign of like non crypto natives getting involved. And ethereum is like the crypto natives getting richer and increasing in numbers and doing more stuff. And I do think that the number of people that are looking to actually do stuff on chain and are more Ethereum based and Ethereum pills like yourself, Justin, they're still waiting for more good apps. We saw fronttech. Ok, it was fun for a little bit, not hearing so much about it right now.
00:27:48.564 - 00:28:19.098, Speaker A: There needs to be more done and better UI and I think potentially yield bearing stablecoins and better yields. And that savings account mode is one thing. I think, you know, we'll talk to Thiki about gaming in a little bit and see if that's another one. But ultimately it's kind of quiet on that front. And meanwhile the normies are starting to I bitcoin again and that's, that's sort of like dominating the ratio right now.
00:28:19.186 - 00:28:30.294, Speaker B: Look, can I just ask very quickly, if you're me and you're mostly ETH, would do you think it's too late to swap? Is the ratio too bad now or do you think this is just getting started?
00:28:30.434 - 00:29:02.138, Speaker A: I think we're towards the end and I think that once the ETF comes out, you know, a couple days later, people will start looking for the next thing and the next thing is going to be the ethereum ETF. So that will probably mark the bottom. So we could see a little bit more until this news finally hits. But it's a scary ratio already. Yeah, even I'm a bit surprised. And I was expecting a little bit of a move, but not this much.
00:29:02.306 - 00:29:05.130, Speaker B: All right, I'm holding strong. You heard it here first.
00:29:05.322 - 00:29:06.694, Speaker C: What about you, Dicky?
00:29:07.234 - 00:29:35.072, Speaker D: I think that there could be another ten to 15% downside in FTC just because there's so many people selling alts and a lot can happen in 85 days. I do agree, Geordie, that like the ETF approach approval on gen ten or maybe a few weeks after we'll mark the bottom. But like, as you can see, like, things moved really fast in e three BTC already and they can continue to move that fast.
00:29:35.128 - 00:29:35.800, Speaker A: I think.
00:29:35.952 - 00:29:37.480, Speaker D: Especially with all this all supply coming.
00:29:37.512 - 00:30:01.404, Speaker B: To the market, ten to 15% is nothing. I was talking more. 2030, 40, 50 would be something I'd care about. But to push back on your, you know, people swapping out of vaults, like when they're swapping out of vaults, they're actually. You have to buy ETH to do so generally. Right? Like maybe on a sex you can go straight from AlT to BTC, but for most people like you, when you sell your alt, you're actually buying ETH. Right.
00:30:01.984 - 00:30:07.764, Speaker D: I guess the unlocks I'm talking about is mainly focused on the team and the investors.
00:30:09.464 - 00:30:10.104, Speaker A: That are.
00:30:10.184 - 00:30:18.056, Speaker D: And they're just going to sell their alts for dollars and someone needs to buy these alts and it's going to come from somewhere else to do it.
00:30:18.160 - 00:30:19.472, Speaker B: Got it. That makes sense.
00:30:19.568 - 00:30:55.506, Speaker A: We are starting to see the VC market also be quite dry on new funding. We're not seeing that many announcements. The projects that I know that are looking for funding are finding it harder than ever. And there's a few sources of new flow into the money. I would say there's three main ones. So we have like retail people that are just, you know, coming to finance and whatever other centralized exchange and just depositing money. And that kind of enters the environment that's good for all coins, including altcoins mainly.
00:30:55.506 - 00:31:37.594, Speaker A: Then you have institutional money. There's two types of institutional money, though. So there's the macro money and that is mainly like ETH, BTC and probably more on the BTC side. And then you have the VC money and, you know, VC's go out there, they raise a billion dollars from Harvard endowment and, you know, whoever else is looking to. To diversify their multibillion portfolios. And they generally are investing in projects that are good for ETH, right? Like they're good for the doers, not for the kind of money holders. And it's a time that that pipe is quiet.
00:31:37.594 - 00:32:23.854, Speaker A: And after FTX, I mean, this is one of SPF's gifts to the Ethereum community. His parting gift was just drying up the VC funnel that, you know, I think we're seeing the effects of that because all these teams have people to pay, there's mouths to feed, there's tons of developers that have to spend money on rent and travel and going to conferences and getting tables at marquee. Very important. I mean, I still can't believe the last one. But like Vicki said, somebody has to fund the alt buying and somebody has to fund the champagne buying. And it's sometimes coming out of, out of our coins.
00:32:24.194 - 00:32:55.454, Speaker D: Their day of reckoning will come. I was talking about HFT is like the first sort of canary hash flows token in the coal mine. They're doing like 91% unlock of their circulating supply. It's only like $50 million, but they're circulating, it's only 50 anyway. And in the past week or so it's down like, you know, 30, 40%. So I do think like any alt with upcoming supply in the next few months is gonna, is gonna face that problem of like the, you know, 30 year treasury market. Just no buyers, down only.
00:32:55.914 - 00:32:58.498, Speaker B: Wow. Yeah, it's crazy.
00:32:58.546 - 00:33:01.374, Speaker C: Tlt. Yeah.
00:33:04.414 - 00:33:11.302, Speaker A: What do you think? What do you think about gaming thicky? There's been this interesting launch recently with big time. Have you been following this?
00:33:11.398 - 00:33:45.434, Speaker D: Yeah, big time. They raised like 20 million in 2021 and they've been in beta for a while. And they just announced their token last week and they announced like the preseason of their game. So I was playing a good amount of big time over this past week just to sort of like test it out. And it's actually like, you know, it's, it's, it's a step above the games of old with like Jewel and Decentraland and Sandbox. Those are actually just like complete garbage. This one's actually like you could sink in 1020 hours before it gets stale.
00:33:45.594 - 00:33:48.414, Speaker C: The video title is worst NFT game ever. So.
00:33:52.394 - 00:34:02.644, Speaker D: It'S like Unreal Engine. It's like, it's like, it's like a, you know, if you played an MMORPG like kind of like guild wars two or World of Warcraft, it's like, you know, it's like decent. It's like.
00:34:03.264 - 00:34:05.204, Speaker B: It looks like a real game.
00:34:05.784 - 00:34:08.124, Speaker D: Yeah, it is a real game. It's a real game.
00:34:08.464 - 00:34:16.928, Speaker B: So what is, how is crypto involved? Like, are the in game items, NFTS is the currency that you use in the game a token? Like how does it play into crypto?
00:34:17.016 - 00:34:43.666, Speaker D: Yeah, so their idea is that like they want to do play to earn. The CEO is the CEO of Decentraland. So you can deposit four tokens. You can deposit ETH, BTC, USDC, and you can deposit mana, which is essentially a token. And you can use that to buy in game items and you need those in game items in order to earn essentially the big time token that you can sell. And they launched. It was a pretty interesting tokenomics.
00:34:43.666 - 00:34:54.234, Speaker D: It was like a billion FTB with like 30 million cirque. So it actually worked out to where like, you could earn like $30 an hour playing this game. It's been quickly being sold off, though.
00:34:54.314 - 00:34:54.682, Speaker C: Right now it's.
00:34:54.698 - 00:35:02.894, Speaker D: Maybe you can earn $15 an hour playing this game, but yeah, that's how it's supposed to set up. Like, you can actually make some money playing this game.
00:35:03.794 - 00:35:07.014, Speaker B: Is this how you're funding your bills?
00:35:10.314 - 00:35:37.754, Speaker D: Well, I funded it by shorting it. It's like an. It's a super interesting grift. Because the investors got no token, the investors get equity, and the token, there is no actually real reason to buy the token. And when you buy in game items, you don't spend token to buy them, you spend real world dollars, which accrues to the equity holders. So I think it's a really clever way of enriching equity holders at the expense of token holders. As we've seen this week, very common trend.
00:35:38.094 - 00:35:48.232, Speaker B: If this game picks up, though, it doesn't matter that the token is completely useless because all tokens pretty much are completely useless, right? If this thing is the next thing that the token number is going to go up.
00:35:48.328 - 00:36:02.032, Speaker D: I think it's like at the weird middle ground where it's like, it's not actually a fun game. Nobody will play the game just to play the game. They will only play it to make the token, to earn the token. It's like, it's like an okay game, but like, you really can't play this for more than 20 hours.
00:36:02.168 - 00:36:13.954, Speaker C: I see. And the token is called big time. Right. It's just like, it's such a non serious branding of a token. Wasn't this like listed on Coinbase, like this pumped because it was listed on Codebase, right?
00:36:14.254 - 00:36:14.606, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:36:14.630 - 00:36:15.054, Speaker A: Finance.
00:36:15.094 - 00:36:28.274, Speaker D: That's correct. Yeah, finance as well. All the perps we've been, we've been making. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's perps. We've been calling it small time or tiny time. Every time the price goes down.
00:36:29.614 - 00:36:34.478, Speaker C: What's up? Even like, shorting this, like, are you just like playing the game, earning tokens, dumping it?
00:36:34.606 - 00:36:37.564, Speaker D: Oh, short earlier, but I'm not in the position anymore.
00:36:37.734 - 00:36:44.744, Speaker A: Hopefully there's. There's more life to the gaming market than what we've seen so far.
00:36:44.904 - 00:36:57.768, Speaker D: That's. That's like the issue, right? With. With these games. It's like crypto. We were talking on our podcast earlier, Pikey, is that like, crypto is already a game. So like, why. Why play a game on top of crypto? It seems like it's.
00:36:57.768 - 00:37:00.696, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:37:00.760 - 00:37:24.876, Speaker C: I don't understand. Yeah, like crypto is such a whole new experience. Like playing on chain, buying meme coins, farming. It's just like a financial game and I have zero motive to play big time or whatever. Yeah, it doesn't really make sense. I feel like it's more of like a VC narrative because VC's like to sink money in here. So they're trying to like push it, but I think in practice, like no one really cares.
00:37:25.060 - 00:38:15.714, Speaker A: It's so, it's so complicated as a game as well. Crypto is challenging. Lovely strategy game. If you're trying to play this meta narrative of figuring out what coins to buy, buy and sell, it's so easy to make the right prediction and say, okay, obviously sandbox is not worth $5 or obviously Sui and Aptos are not worth 5 billion ftv. And then if you don't have the financial means to keep a short on for a forex and wait the inevitable twelve month timeline for it to go down, you still lose. So it creates an extra layer where you don't have to just predict the end goal, but you have to navigate the path as well. And it's challenging, it's fun, but not for everybody.
00:38:15.874 - 00:38:20.454, Speaker C: Yeah, we're all DJ's here with insane risk tolerances.
00:38:22.074 - 00:38:30.460, Speaker A: Speaking of DJ's, shall we go to our past of the week segment and see if Taiki's gonna maintain his incredible winning streak?
00:38:30.572 - 00:38:31.464, Speaker D: Oh no.
00:38:31.804 - 00:39:01.376, Speaker C: Yeah, you guys need to try harder, man. Alright, so this is a long pasta, but I thought it was great. I guess I have to read this out loud for our non YouTube watchers, but this is from Gort. Vitalik, Hayden and Justin Drake were walking one day when they noticed a dollar 100 bill on the sidewalk. Vitalik picked it up and said, we should use this to build public goods and core infrastructure. Hayden nodded his head, agreed, we can put this money to good use. Justin Drake smiled and asked Vitalik for the bill.
00:39:01.376 - 00:39:29.372, Speaker C: He obliged. See that homeless man down there? He gestured roughly 50 yards down the sidewalk to a homeless man with a sign and a little hat with a few dollar bills and some change in it. Watch this. They walked over and Justin appeared as though he was going to give the man money, but instead pulled out a lighter and lit the $100 bill on fire. The homeless man looked confused, as did Hayden and Vitalik. Justin pointed at the hat with the small bills. That money right there is now more scarce because I took $100 out of the total circulating supply.
00:39:29.372 - 00:39:44.276, Speaker C: The homeless man still looked perplexed. Why couldn't I just have the money if you were going to burn it? Well. Justin paused. It was never yours to begin with. The homeless man smiled and responded, that actually makes a lot of sense. Thank you for making the money. I do have more valuable.
00:39:44.276 - 00:39:57.134, Speaker C: Vitalik clapped, but in a weird way, putting his elbows together and sort of slapping his hands back and forth. Anyways, the homeless man later died of starvation. The state of eat. What are you guys, what do you guys think?
00:39:57.254 - 00:39:58.314, Speaker D: He's not wrong.
00:39:59.094 - 00:40:03.158, Speaker B: It's funny that that's like, exactly, it's similar to what we were talking about earlier.
00:40:03.246 - 00:40:17.706, Speaker C: Yeah, I love the metallic clapping card. It's like he's just like, there's this, there's like videos on YouTube where he's just like, coughs like this. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I love italic, but yeah, I love his demeanor.
00:40:17.810 - 00:40:40.542, Speaker A: Vitalik posted saying that he's not the somebody that sells ETH for getting money, that he only donates it. And then those people sell it because they need to, you know, fund whatever charity or thing they're doing. But it's sort of equivalent, right? Like whether he's cashing out or he's just dispersing coins to people to cash out, it has the same selling price ultimately. Yeah.
00:40:40.558 - 00:40:59.950, Speaker B: I mean, is there a difference if he sells it or if he donates it to his llc to buy a house? I mean, it's the same sell pressure. Just a joke. I'm sure. I'm sure that's not happening. Yeah, that was a good one, Tyke. I don't know if I can top that, but I have one pulled up here, so I'll just share this one. So this is from Fubar.
00:40:59.950 - 00:41:24.834, Speaker B: Awesome account on Twitter. And he said, remember when litecoin tweeted that it was going to be sold in Walmart? And for me this was like the peak of the bull market. I remember when litecoin pumped like crazy on this fake news. Everybody shorted it and they were right. It was completely fake. And it sort of reminds me of like what happened with the fake BTC ETF news. So I had like a similar experience when I was announcing Astaria's fundraise.
00:41:24.834 - 00:41:55.316, Speaker B: You go through like the pr process to announce it. And actually anyone can submit any pr they want through some sources like Sijin, Presswire. If you're familiar, you can google it and you just pay like $900. And if you have a press release, they just send it out to everyone, like Reuters, Yahoo news, thousands of places pick it up right. Like, it's so easy to disseminate fake news and it really never gets verified. So be careful what you read out there. But I thought this tweet was funny, and it brought me back to a much simpler time in the crypto space.
00:41:55.500 - 00:43:19.374, Speaker A: There's a weird power that the media has because unless we coordinate and then we share information and we need some centralized places that we're all looking at and dispersing information, you know, we don't function as well. So we end up putting a lot of power into not just news outlets, but even like, individual tweet accounts. And not to mention, unfortunately, all these, you know, youtubers that are not us, but like the other guys, you know, bitboys and those guys that end up having, you know, naval talks about how there's the money game and the status game, and some people just try to get power by playing political games and trying to not create and build a business, but sort of just being in a position of influence. And it is always better to be the one that is actually creating economic value rather than the one that's playing the influence game. And this media thing reminds me of the same thing where everyone might be following, you know, cointelegraph, and it's not because they respect them, because they've earned, you know, some thought leadership or something. It's purely because we're relying on them for this other type of game where we're dispersing information and things can go wrong quickly. And it happened in this case.
00:43:19.794 - 00:43:27.774, Speaker B: So I know we do what we talk about ETH being community money. Is this our community pasta? The coin telegraph? Intern getting fired?
00:43:28.394 - 00:43:29.130, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:29.282 - 00:43:41.974, Speaker D: Did you see the screenshots afterwards of like, the telegram chat where they source the information from? It was just some, like, random dude with the Pepe PFP just like, posted a joke headline. The point Telegraph guys were like, is this real?
00:43:43.634 - 00:43:59.292, Speaker A: Yeah. It's like the guy responds, well, it must be real because the price is moving. It's like, yeah, you tweeted it, and now it's like the elephant, you know, having his own donk. It's just like, oh, yeah, well, moving, so real.
00:43:59.348 - 00:44:01.344, Speaker D: And then they just keep repeating it.
00:44:01.844 - 00:44:03.820, Speaker A: Vicki, how about your pasta? What do you have?
00:44:03.932 - 00:44:38.934, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, it's Vance Spencer tweet. Yeah. So I guess I'll read the tweet for the podcast listeners, but says when no millennials or zoomers can afford a house and job prospects are limited, don't be surprised when pes for zeitgeist tech stocks in crypto are going vertical even with higher rates, interest rates don't matter to millennials and zoomers. They have no savings and little prospect to ever have them. Even big tech friends are living paycheck to paycheck. All that matters is swing for the fences, a portfolio optimized for the Instagram lifestyle that is actually quite rational. Spend more time in Asia, you'll understand the crushing paradox for young people.
00:44:38.934 - 00:45:17.124, Speaker D: So, I mean, I do think this, like, is a prevailing sentiment amongst, like, the younger generation is like, you know, if you don't have 1020 million liquid, then, like, why? That's like, there's like a weird, like, discontinuity with, like, the value function for these people. Rather than grind at a nine to five for like 20 years in order to make it, or just make it, you know, quickly, it does, like, affect the sort of behavioral patterns of what these people invest in and like. Yeah. So I thought it was very good commentary on the sort of trends of the investment mindset that we've been seeing right, lately.
00:45:17.244 - 00:45:45.264, Speaker B: And also just looking at this price to earnings ratio chart that he posted of the top seven companies in the S and P, which are basically just tech companies and everyone else. And, like, the disparity is insane, right? So for, like, seven companies in the S and P 500, their PE ratio is an absurd 45. And for all the rest, it's like, at 19, it's absolutely insane. The disparity we're seeing in, you know, all of the. All of the economic game gain is going to just a few players.
00:45:45.444 - 00:46:14.866, Speaker A: Yeah, the passive flows really help those large stocks, and it ends up becoming like a self reinforcing cycle because they just have more money to maintain monopolies. But Vance is right. Even though I have to say, for pasta, it's not as catchy. It's much more of a philosophical tweet. But it is correct. I recently tapped into the Zoomer market and talked to. Talked to some 20 year olds to understand what's going on out there.
00:46:14.866 - 00:46:56.846, Speaker A: And I asked, like, are you interested in crypto? It's like, yeah, interested in crypto. Oh, what kind of crypto? And I'm waiting to hear about ether, BTC. And it's like, no, my 18 year old friend made his own coin. And then, like, his family put money into, like, his random Ponzi coin that he made, and then it went down, it got hacked, and everybody lost money. So it's just, this is what's going on. And then I ask if, you know, I was like, oh, you know, that scene in the big short and they're like, what's the big short? They don't even know, like, the basic kind of stuff that we've lived through over the last 15 years. So, yeah, they don't care.
00:46:56.846 - 00:47:03.814, Speaker A: They don't care about that. They care about Instagram and, you know, great take by Vance, although not as catchy as a quote.
00:47:03.894 - 00:47:11.786, Speaker C: It's kind of like the bookcase for meme coins, right? People just want to get rich quick, so they just, like, buy doge. You know, they don't care.
00:47:11.930 - 00:47:16.162, Speaker A: There is no, like, bull case for meme coins. Like, there's.
00:47:16.218 - 00:47:17.934, Speaker D: They're all meme coins, in fact.
00:47:20.794 - 00:47:22.810, Speaker C: Yeah. Like, uniswap is a meme coin, right?
00:47:22.842 - 00:47:42.788, Speaker D: Like, yeah, exactly. I mean, you look at, like, January this year with. With aptos, and you had Koreans being like, one apt equals one apartment. I feel like that's what he was referencing when, like, talking about the youth in Asia is like, we make fun of them for being DJ's and just buying random shit just because price goes up. But, like, I think I see that trend happening just globally.
00:47:42.916 - 00:47:52.572, Speaker A: Yeah. And speaking of Koreans, that's going to be my. My pasta of the week. So I run into this article, and you guys do guys know what burger coins are?
00:47:52.668 - 00:47:55.184, Speaker C: Like, us coins or pc coins?
00:48:00.324 - 00:48:31.274, Speaker A: You know, I use Google translate here. So this may not be exactly the korean language, but I think it is because there's a picture of a burger next to all these, like, coins. So basically, the Koreans, the regulators are starting to get involved in the politicians because what they call burger coins, which is like foreigners, Americans, let's say, are coming in and listing, you know, Stephen, I'm not sure which one Stephen is. We have avalanche.
00:48:31.434 - 00:48:32.738, Speaker C: It's probably Steppin.
00:48:32.906 - 00:48:34.174, Speaker B: Yeah, it's Stepan.
00:48:35.274 - 00:49:11.310, Speaker A: We have app toss and siba inu. Basically, the korean regulators are angry that, you know, the burger coins are listing and then going down 90% and losing locals there. They're hard, hard earned korean won. So this is pretty epic. And I don't know. I don't think aptos is going to come back for these guys. But kudos for burger coin.
00:49:11.310 - 00:49:14.790, Speaker A: You know, the Koreans crushed it here.
00:49:14.942 - 00:49:29.952, Speaker B: The last quote is funny because it says all of these coins, without exception, have fallen for the past two years. That is also true, just to be clear, for every coin in the entire space. So it's not just us burgers, it's everyone.
00:49:30.088 - 00:49:55.386, Speaker D: The article cited Defi squared's Twitter on the Sui stuff, how, like, they were just any potential investigation of them selling stake rewards. I wonder if they've read my twitter because I've referenced many times. Oh yeah, these american VC's are just trying to police korean retail and take money from them. Like I'm curious if like, you know, korean regulators have been reading Twitter but I think Joey's Taco Justin might have won him the game.
00:49:55.530 - 00:49:58.374, Speaker C: Yeah, I really like the burger coin pasta.
00:50:00.234 - 00:50:07.002, Speaker A: Okay, good. Last minute we take, take the crown away from Taiki. Gotta get a week on it now.
00:50:07.138 - 00:50:11.374, Speaker B: We should get it. We need a trophy and we just start mailing it to each other for each week.
00:50:15.964 - 00:50:18.224, Speaker D: Maybe doing NFT, you send it to each other.
00:50:18.924 - 00:50:20.144, Speaker B: Not a bad idea.
00:50:20.604 - 00:50:24.036, Speaker A: A little bit better for global warming to use some.
00:50:24.100 - 00:50:24.348, Speaker C: Yes.
00:50:24.396 - 00:50:31.284, Speaker A: Maybe we can spend some ETH gas just to revitalize the ETH economy. Cool. All right, well, thanks everybody for joining and see you next time.
