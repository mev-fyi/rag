00:00:00.160 - 00:00:08.014, Speaker A: Think you shared this with me. Um, apparently, I'm labeled as the ETH guy in the show, which I don't know why it's true. If you guys have listened, I've criticized ETH all the time.
00:00:08.094 - 00:00:09.494, Speaker B: Even the ETH guy.
00:00:09.614 - 00:00:12.374, Speaker C: You are the ETH guy. You're the ETH max.
00:00:12.494 - 00:00:13.534, Speaker D: You're the ETH guy.
00:00:13.654 - 00:00:15.214, Speaker A: What do I have to do to change that?
00:00:15.294 - 00:00:16.874, Speaker C: Buy something other than ETH.
00:00:17.574 - 00:00:18.094, Speaker B: It's good.
00:00:18.134 - 00:00:18.902, Speaker E: Yeah. Yeah, this is fine.
00:00:18.918 - 00:00:20.294, Speaker C: It's like, lead into it. You're fine.
00:00:20.414 - 00:00:20.878, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:00:20.966 - 00:00:21.246, Speaker B: All right.
00:00:21.270 - 00:00:22.754, Speaker A: Fuck it. I'm the ETH guy.
00:00:42.974 - 00:01:09.248, Speaker E: Welcome, everybody, to another show, steady lads. It's a special episode. Today we have guy from Athena joining us to talk meme coins and shitposting and also, you know, his amazingly growing TVL on Ethina and talking. But, you know, some of the pieces of that puzzle, as usual. I'm Jordi. I'm the founder of Salini Capital. We have Justin with us, the CEO of Astaria Taiki, the humble farmer, full time researcher.
00:01:09.248 - 00:01:20.976, Speaker E: And we have Thiki, who is. Are you trading these, like, all time high breakouts, rejection? Thiki, are you. Are you doing well or what's going on there?
00:01:21.120 - 00:01:25.000, Speaker B: Doing Okay. I didn't expect it to reject so hard off.
00:01:25.032 - 00:01:27.312, Speaker D: Sixty nine k. And then I talked to all these odds, and they're like.
00:01:27.328 - 00:01:43.744, Speaker B: Yeah, never breaks all time highs on its first try. So, like, to a lot of people, this, like, giant wick 69 was obvious, but, like, you know, I got caught in a wave there. But luckily, I have, like, a decent entry from, like, 64. Not the best, but, like, yeah, just sticking it, holding it through.
00:01:44.164 - 00:02:06.674, Speaker E: Yeah, I happened to be awake. I think it was, like, four or 05:00 a.m. Singapore time when. When the wake happened, and I happened to. I guess I yolo'd a little bit. I bought that. That dip seemed like free money, but I think at this point, we'll get one more attempt at the all time high, and if it gets rejected again, that'll be a little bit worrying, because I think now the expectation is the next time it's going to go through.
00:02:06.674 - 00:02:20.714, Speaker E: Guy, have you been having any time to trade? I know you're like, you're so busy with everything going on, but it feels like even for those of us that are founders and they're doing stuff, you just have to put some positions on here and there.
00:02:21.494 - 00:03:10.586, Speaker D: Yeah. Lesser, I'd say actively. So there's obviously quite a big perks on the trading stuff on the Athene side and just keeping an eye on that. But I think my approach to it has been less sort of active day trading and just having positions, and I'm sort of happy holding through the cycle. I think it's something that I learned about my own personality last cycle as well, which is that there's an interesting middle ground, I think, between day trading, which I know I'm not going to outperform just holding, but then there's also holding too long, which I think a lot of people did last cycle. I know that sounds like it's basically just saying buy the bottom and sell the top, but I think that there is an interesting middle ground of basically reducing the decisions that you make every day to just have a few decisions where you act on key inflection points. I personally am only buying when I feel like you're at an extreme towards downside and then selling slowly on the way up.
00:03:10.586 - 00:03:12.654, Speaker D: So it's not something that I do very actively.
00:03:12.974 - 00:03:33.686, Speaker E: Okay. I mean, I'm just curious. Let's get a. Let's get a poll from everybody. Like, what inning are we on? If any one is, let's just say, like March 2020 when, you know, we hit the bottom and we kind of started growing and then inning nine is two years later once Luna collapses, and then everything starts falling down. Justin, like, what inning are we on, do you think?
00:03:33.750 - 00:04:12.526, Speaker A: Well, if we're just going. If we're going based on price, I think that's a different answer than time. If we're going based on price, we're in like this, the 6th inning, I want to say, because if you think about it, like, the move from 15 to 69, et cetera, is like a forex or so. We're not getting a forex from here on bitcoin, at least not in my opinion. That would put us at 240k, almost a quarter of a million dollars, which I just don't see as realistic. But if you go on time, I think we're going to have, like, a long, drawn out period of prices being, you know, pretty decent, at least through the end of this year. I think after this year, it gets a little murky just because elections will be over in the US and we could start to see, like, something like a recession.
00:04:12.526 - 00:04:15.766, Speaker A: But I think for this year, we should be in pretty good shape.
00:04:15.870 - 00:04:20.358, Speaker E: Okay. I didn't get a clear number. Sounds like a six. But then the other one was like a four, maybe.
00:04:20.406 - 00:04:35.474, Speaker A: So I'd say, yeah, six thinning. If you're looking at just price, if you're looking at time, you know, we've only been extremely bullish for, like, six months, and I think we've got at least, you know, six months, maybe nine months left of, like, solid bullish sentiment on the timeline.
00:04:35.874 - 00:04:38.654, Speaker E: How about you, Taiki? Where do you see us right now?
00:04:39.114 - 00:05:15.562, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we're in the fourth or fifth inning, to be honest. I think the bull market started January of 2023, and I think the past couple of months, it's been crazy. I mean, I just started to get texts from my normie friends, and they're all asking me if they should sell their bitcoin. That's literally the question they're asking, not what they should buy, not what altcoins do you like? It's like, okay, I have my bitcoin. You know, should I sell? There's a lot of PTSD still in the air, and I think crypto will continue to climb all worry. But I do think, yeah, I agree with Justin. For the majors, I think we've seen most of our gains.
00:05:15.562 - 00:05:25.506, Speaker C: I think when we get closer to 7th, 8th, 9th inning of the bull market, that's when altcoins go absolutely nuts. But I think we're still at least a few months away from there.
00:05:25.690 - 00:05:34.384, Speaker E: Let me just quickly go to thicke, because he was. He was very bearish to start the year, and I think he's had to adapt and change direction. Like, Vicky, what's your current outlook?
00:05:35.564 - 00:05:36.100, Speaker D: I'm actually.
00:05:36.132 - 00:05:59.360, Speaker B: I think I'm more bullish than Justin Taiki. I think, like, seeing three or four, I just think about, like, how much money there is in the world, and, like, how we've kind of opened up a can of worms for tradfi. And I like, I'm like, wow, 50 billion of inflow. So where's bitcoin gonna go from here? 50 billion? And I don't know. Yeah, I'm very bullish. I think it can last longer. Like, years, maybe.
00:05:59.432 - 00:06:00.200, Speaker A: Super cycle.
00:06:00.272 - 00:06:20.912, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly. That's what I was going to say. We don't have super. We got picky super cycle guys. So, you know, obviously, with Athena, you're running a market neutral kind of strategy there, but in a bull market, people don't want to be market neutral, and you have to incentivize them so hard. You got to give them, like, you know, hundreds of percents of TvL to. Sorry.
00:06:20.912 - 00:06:30.364, Speaker E: Of APY. Do you think that we're at that point where it's just so hard to get people's attention on a stable product because they're so bullish, or where are we? Are we at the top.
00:06:30.484 - 00:07:22.520, Speaker D: Yeah, it's an interesting question. So I think maybe just addressing where are we in the market cycle first, and then I can jump into the Athena thoughts. I think a couple of weeks ago, I probably agreed with the sentiment that it was actually a lot earlier than people thought. And then I think the action in the last two weeks definitely gave me January 2021 vibes in terms of what is moving and how quickly. I think the one thing that just gives me pause for consideration at least, is that we haven't really seen a crypto cycle when rates are above zero. So if you believe the forward curve, I think we might see actually a crypto cycle, but then something really late within the cycle where rates actually give you a second shot in the arm. So I don't want to say the word supercycle, but I think there is a reasonable case there to say you might get basically a second leg further on in the cycle, or actually just interest rates take you further than you thought you would be able to go.
00:07:22.520 - 00:08:11.714, Speaker D: So I think I generally agree with the sentiment of the guys here, which you definitely not at the beginning, but you actually got quite a bit of room to run. I think the one thing to just keep an eye on is if jay battle basically allows it to run longer than it normally would, and you don't want to sell, I think, too early in that scenario either. I think on Athena, it's been interesting, as you said, it's quite difficult to actually find new capital to come into a stable product. Generally, people are pretty willing to throw their ETH into a liquid restaken product or whatever it is, and get yield on that because they still got the delta, but it's quite difficult to actually get people to sell into dollars. One thing which I think does help, actually, with Athena is that obviously, generally, stablecoin size has been creeping up since October, so it bottomed out at around $120 billion and sitting at 140 now. So the market is still growing on stable coins. But actually, I think people's risk tolerance increases through the cycle.
00:08:11.714 - 00:09:05.702, Speaker D: So as you're making more money elsewhere, you're actually more interested in going finding a higher yield with something like Athena, and you're caring less about, I guess, the stability and brand that comes with something like USDC. I think the real loser, though, within that construct is RWAS, which are stuck in the middle, which is it's not liquid and a trading instrument like a USDT, and to a lesser extent USDC. And it's not like the high yield alternatives that you get with Athena. So I think we have seen flows because obviously some people do have some amount of their portfolio in dollars, even at an extreme moment in the market like we are now. But I think one thing people also forget is that you have an ability to borrow from Defi at much, much lower than the cost of capital within centralized exchanges. So one example here is you can go into maker and get a nine figure loan at 6.5% in Daisy and then throw that into S USD, which just paid out like 67% this week.
00:09:05.702 - 00:09:18.478, Speaker D: So that's just like an insane spread, right? Where even if you don't believe the whole, like, thesis was Athena around synthetic dollars or whatever it is, you can actually just conceptualize it like an interest rate arbitrage vehicle between DeFi, Tri and CFI.
00:09:18.606 - 00:09:26.074, Speaker E: This is like Taiki's bread and butter, these type of strategies, I think. Taiki, have you been finding these looping opportunities?
00:09:26.494 - 00:10:13.246, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm actually. Last week I mentioned that I sold my stone on Manta network at 96 something, and everyone was like, what the fuck, Tyche, you're such an idiot. But I just felt like I can get better rates elsewhere, and what I'm doing is I bridged ETH into Polygon and using that as collateral, borrow matic, and I'm staking it. So if I believe in the matic staking thesis, then the future airdrops are. I mean, obviously, I don't know what the size of these airdrops are going to be, but if I think that these airdrops are going to happen, then I can borrow matic at 3%, stake it for 5%, and then, no, it's not really a stable coin arbitrage, but it's somewhat of a similar idea where if Athena can offer higher rates, then technically the velocity on chain should increase over time.
00:10:13.350 - 00:10:47.522, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. And I want to touch on something guy said in terms of people get more bullish as the prices go up. I was talking to a friend today, and they work at Apple, and they have a bunch of apple stock, and they have a little bit of bitcoin, and they're about to buy a house, so they need to liquidate something. And they're just like, last thing they want to sell is their bitcoin right now. They're going to just dump apple stock and just make sure that they keep the bitcoin exposure. So, like guy said, people just want exposure right now. I think there's a general sentiment that know, we're not, like, the greatest.
00:10:47.522 - 00:11:09.146, Speaker E: We're not like, the fool at the table, right? You're not like the guy, like the fish at the table. And the reason we think that is because we're seeing these ETF flows. So it feels like there's outsiders out there that are later than us, we're earlier than them. So that kind of, like, gives. Gives people the impression that they should be still holding delta even though we're at all time high valuations.
00:11:09.290 - 00:11:25.168, Speaker C: Yeah, it's crypto. Still reflexive, because I was looking at doge couple months ago at, like, eight cents, and I was like, this is so, so much like, this is pure vaporware. And now it's at. I'm like, wow. Like, doge is kind of cheap. It looks kind of cheap. Crypto is those assets, like, the higher it goes, the cheaper it looks.
00:11:25.168 - 00:11:27.264, Speaker C: And the lower it goes, the more expensive it looks.
00:11:27.424 - 00:12:03.284, Speaker E: Let's talk a little bit about dog coins, because it just feels like, you know, crypto. So ridiculous that we just have categories in one of the categories, dog coins, and once one of them starts, they all kind of start barking together, you know, like they do in real life, where they all join in. So, like, I was looking at, like, all of them being up, like, 50%, 100%, 500%. You know, I got quoted on Bloomberg about dog coins. Apparently, like, this is, like, the normies love to make fun of us and look at the stuff that we're doing, but the volatility has been insane. Justin, any favorite dog coins? I think there's, like, ten of them that are. That are kind of popular.
00:12:04.544 - 00:12:10.826, Speaker A: I've passed the dog coin era, and I bought the Joe Bowden token on Solana for fun. You just.
00:12:10.890 - 00:12:11.266, Speaker E: It's.
00:12:11.330 - 00:12:26.706, Speaker A: You want to be early on these things. You don't want to be the guy. You know what I mean? Like, you got to buy these things before they're super popular. So I don't have any dog coins, but I did buy a small amount of Joe Bowden, and we'll see if that. That does well for me. I missed the trump coin, so maybe the Joe Biden coins will do well for me now.
00:12:26.770 - 00:12:29.374, Speaker E: Interesting. So the Joe Bowden is, like, the.
00:12:29.674 - 00:12:31.042, Speaker A: Geo Bowden or something?
00:12:31.138 - 00:12:33.990, Speaker E: The geo bowdoin is the revenge trade for people who miss Trump.
00:12:34.162 - 00:12:36.230, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And who missed the dog coins.
00:12:36.302 - 00:12:52.038, Speaker E: Yeah, I've been looking at dog coins. I can kind of. Maybe our audience is interested in a little dog coin breakdown. Think you. Have you. Have you been kind of doing a little dog versus dog comparison with your analysts? Are you, like, long spread any, like, spreads of dogs that you're long short?
00:12:52.206 - 00:12:56.830, Speaker B: No, just long. All of them. I didn't want to bother with the spreads. I was.
00:12:56.862 - 00:12:57.166, Speaker D: I'm not.
00:12:57.190 - 00:12:58.094, Speaker B: Not anymore. I was.
00:12:58.134 - 00:13:13.974, Speaker E: I was. Okay, so here's a key question that, you know, it's kind of tying into the Athena thing. When you, when you got your dog calling exposure, have you perp longed in paying the funding or did you go into, like, you know, Solana chains and trying to find spot to buy? How did you actually express it?
00:13:14.054 - 00:13:19.406, Speaker B: I just paid the funding. I bought some spot and I paid a lot of paid, like, a lot of funding.
00:13:19.590 - 00:13:24.734, Speaker E: This is like, exactly who is, like, providing the, you know, insane ap wise?
00:13:24.814 - 00:13:25.030, Speaker D: It's.
00:13:25.062 - 00:13:28.384, Speaker E: It's guys like thicke paying dog coin funding rates.
00:13:28.574 - 00:13:31.348, Speaker D: Delta neutral dog money, I think is the next one that's on.
00:13:31.476 - 00:13:32.184, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:13:33.684 - 00:13:35.596, Speaker C: Did you imagine that? Oh, my goodness.
00:13:35.740 - 00:13:36.772, Speaker A: Dog thema.
00:13:36.868 - 00:13:42.980, Speaker C: And it also, like, makes it cheaper to long the perp, right? Technically. So it can actually lead to more speculation.
00:13:43.132 - 00:13:56.284, Speaker E: You know, guy, you are doing a service to the dog coin community. If you expand Athena to Shiba and doge. And what's the biggest one so we have bonk with. There was like three, number three, number four.
00:13:57.544 - 00:13:59.924, Speaker A: Here are all the top ones by market cap.
00:14:00.384 - 00:14:01.456, Speaker C: Floki is a billion.
00:14:01.560 - 00:14:02.632, Speaker E: What the heck? Yeah.
00:14:02.648 - 00:14:15.536, Speaker A: I can't believe we miss Floki. They back in the 2021 bull market around LA. Here at UCLA, there was a bus with, like, a Floki advertisement on it, like a state or a city run bus. And I still missed floki.
00:14:15.720 - 00:14:38.928, Speaker E: I mean, I'm actually, like, very interested to look at the seven day. So Dogecoin is the old grandpa. You know, he can. He can barely get out of bed. Sad dog situation many of us have lived through with, with dog pets. 2020, 2 billion market cap. Hard to be, like, bullish on this thing multiplying, right? Like, last cycle, it was like Elon just kind of single handedly creating that impression.
00:14:38.928 - 00:15:00.028, Speaker E: But 20%, pretty weak sauce we got Shiba. I have to say, shiba is the one that, like, completely surprised me because it was already at a massive market cap cap. And it just, like, ripped 132%. We're seeing it at 19 billion. I think it was trading quite a bit higher. Like 50% higher. I think it was at, like almost 30 billion.
00:15:00.028 - 00:15:02.132, Speaker E: That's. That's sort of like when I put my massive short in.
00:15:02.188 - 00:15:17.908, Speaker A: Yeah. I wanted to ask Nikki on this. I saw a tweet that went pretty viral saying, you know, the market's overheated when Shib starts to get close to flipping Doge. And that's when you exit your dog coins. Have you thought about that? Thinking at all? Is that, like, the sign of ultimate froth with Shib is going to flip doge?
00:15:18.036 - 00:15:19.396, Speaker B: I haven't looked at that.
00:15:19.580 - 00:15:25.508, Speaker E: I mean, that's a quote by GCR, by the way. That's like a. That's a GCR quote. Yeah.
00:15:25.636 - 00:15:41.484, Speaker B: Shib is, like, cleaner tokenomics. Like, doge is constantly emitting 4% a year because they. They pay litecoin miners. Their proof of work, just constantly inflating. Whereas Shib is, like, shib is a token and doge is a coin. You know, like, shib is, like, there's no emissions and they're still building stuff.
00:15:41.524 - 00:15:42.204, Speaker D: So I don't know.
00:15:42.284 - 00:15:47.538, Speaker B: That's my counter argument for this. Shib doge pooping. I don't know. I don't see why it can't happen.
00:15:47.626 - 00:15:55.250, Speaker A: Doesn't doge get, like, an l one premium? Right? Like, it can become the settlement layer for the world where Shib. That's just rolled out.
00:15:55.322 - 00:16:00.874, Speaker B: They could. They're actually launching. They might launch, like, a polygon l two doge chain.
00:16:00.914 - 00:16:01.394, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:16:01.514 - 00:16:17.144, Speaker E: Who is, like, on the other side of. Who's, like, on the other side of my short. Like, who is the guys, like, longing apart from you, thiki? Like, is it college kids? Like, is Shiba, like, what's. What's this? Is the community, like, frat boys? Is that. That's what I'm imagining.
00:16:17.304 - 00:16:41.170, Speaker B: I think the marginal buyer right now is probably those people. But, like, a lot of, like, ct people have seen, I think that the reasoning was, like, oh, bitcoin's about to take all time highs. There's, like, a binary switch. When retail does take all time high, or, sorry. When bitcoin does take all time highs, retail suddenly fomo in, and they were going to buy dog coins. So, like, people who identified that trend very early were able to, like, get, like, a clean, you know, two, three, four, x on a lot of these coins.
00:16:41.362 - 00:17:07.688, Speaker C: I think I've seen a lot of takes on Twitter saying that, oh, like, dotcoin's pumping. It's a sign of fraud. We're near the top. But can't you also argue that the market's getting smarter over time? We just recognize patterns over time. So certain subsection traders just end up buying dog coins. But that's not really a sign of fraud. I mean, I guess it technically is, but I don't really subscribe to the idea that dog coins pumping is near the end of the cycle.
00:17:07.688 - 00:17:12.624, Speaker C: I just think that traders are getting smarter and are detecting patterns yeah, maybe.
00:17:12.964 - 00:17:31.620, Speaker E: But, yeah, Shiba was the one that surprised me. And then when I saw where it was trading in the fours, I had to, like, whack it pretty hard. And that was a great trade for me, I have to have to say. Let's talk about the siblings. Let's talk about the siblings. We got the little tool. Solana siblings, very close in market cap right now.
00:17:31.620 - 00:18:03.350, Speaker E: Been flipping each other. So we have bonk and with very different coins. Bonk is sort of like this, like, supported community. You know, it was an airdrop token, which is very different than, you know, a Dex, like, free, free token where you can get in early, you know, with. Is just a funny name and less. Less supported. But is this the left curve versus the right curve between the two siblings? I think they're.
00:18:03.462 - 00:18:04.954, Speaker C: I think they're both left curve.
00:18:05.694 - 00:18:20.830, Speaker B: I think Jody possibly. I think, like, one is more institutional, one is a team and team allocation and, like, besting. And the other one is just, like, grassroots, per se. So I do think, like, there are different sort of communities that end up holding these coins.
00:18:20.982 - 00:18:57.606, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think with is more relatable. So, like, I mean, I'm a total mid curve, so I haven't, like, purchased anything, but, Justin, if you can share my screen, there was, like, this on asteroid, so on cosmos, you can make an inscription. And the first thing that I thought of was, okay, like, if I'm going to mint or if I'm going to inscribe something on Adam, I'm just going to inscribe left curve tiki. So I feel like the meme is viral to some extent. It's like, oh, does the dog have a hat? You can apply that to anything. Does the animal have a hat? Does a person have a hat? Does the orange have a ha.
00:18:57.606 - 00:19:12.550, Speaker C: Like, you know, and I think it's more funny than, like, bonk. You know, like, bonk is like, what? Like, what? Dog with a bat? It's like, what the hell is that? I don't know. I feel like it's, like, more unique, but, I mean, I guess, you know, after price pumps, the narrative gets stronger, so. I have no fucking idea, guy.
00:19:12.582 - 00:19:16.554, Speaker E: Do you have a favorite, favorite dog out of the bunch?
00:19:16.974 - 00:19:43.544, Speaker D: Yeah, I think, actually, one thing is that, like, when they try to do anything other than being a meme, I think it, like, ceases to be funny at all. And you kind of move from being undervalued versus doge to, like, 100 x overvalued versus anything else that is serious. And so just on the comments around, like, bonk versus with. I look at with. And I actually do find it quite funny the first time that I saw it. And I did actually feel compelled that I should own a little bit of it. And I did not feel the same way with Bonk.
00:19:43.544 - 00:20:31.294, Speaker D: And as you say, when you've got like Solana VC's who are in there, like shilling bonk, you've got like, we're doing a telegram trading board, and now we're doing 10 million in revenue that now the joke is no longer funny anymore, actually, with ponk, when you've got revenue attached to it. And so I think with memes, they really have to be exactly as whiff is now. It's totally organic. You've got everyone else who's pushing it and pushing the meme. And I also think that actually the mind share of whiff relative to its market cap does actually feel quite mispriced, if I'm being honest. That thing was on Bloomberg. You had Arthur Shilling that thing a few weeks in 300 mil market cap, and you compare it to some of the market caps that you're seeing there now, it feels like the mind share is definitely all up a whiff, at least on my timeline, relative to the market caps that you see on the rest of that page, which I think to me is the only relative valuation you can think about with these things.
00:20:31.454 - 00:21:06.192, Speaker E: Yeah, I think you make a great point. There's this insider versus outsider game in meme coins. It's all about fair launch and distribution. And with Bonk, they did a great job of tying in the Solana community because they gave free coins to the NFT collections and the developers. You know, the people like really, really deep into like that space, the bear market. So that kind of brought them together and did really well. But if you're outside of that core, you know, Solana og status, it's much more something like wif, where it's just like, it's funny and they'll just see like, where it goes.
00:21:06.192 - 00:21:44.066, Speaker E: That maybe relates to people. So great point there. And I think looking at distribution of coins ultimately is going to decide their success. Curious about other coins? There's pepe. You know, when you, when you start getting into pepe, it has this, like, strange on chain history in terms of how it was minted. And maybe like some hackers are mint, there's some like, shady stuff around its potential creation. It's possible that it gets distributed enough and the original people, if, even if they were trying to like, do something shady or not holding it anymore, and it just becomes distributed.
00:21:44.066 - 00:21:50.294, Speaker E: I see thicky. You're nodding. Are you familiar with the Pepe situation?
00:21:50.994 - 00:22:09.908, Speaker B: I'm not familiar with the roar, but I do think that when you do the community launch, it's harder to get high up there, because I think just launching at XyK at a low val, it disproportionately rewards early buyers. But the ceiling is higher, I think, if it does reach the terminal escape velocity.
00:22:10.026 - 00:22:33.088, Speaker E: Good point. I mean, let's talk a little bit about airdrops because, you know, bonk was an airdrop ultimately, and sort of taken a life its own. We're about to have an insane airdrop. I saw the w wormhole. Oh, my. Like, is this like a 2 billion airdrop? That's gonna happen. I mean, we're looking at the pre market valuation on things like Avo and hyper liquid.
00:22:33.088 - 00:22:47.332, Speaker E: If this thing launches anywhere near, you know, the sort of like 15 plus billion valuation, and they're giving away, you know, over 10% of the token. Justin, you, you're very active on chain. You must have gotten some wallets. Have you checked?
00:22:47.508 - 00:23:06.528, Speaker A: I've checked. I'm a little disappointed. I only have a few thousand w coins, which is kind of crappy. It's actually interesting. I have a ton of ETH addresses that have used wormhole, but my Solana address, which I've minimally used, got the largest airdrop. So it is interesting. I think it's going to have, like, a very nice stimulative effect, mostly to Solana, which is probably bullish.
00:23:06.528 - 00:23:19.924, Speaker A: Solana meme coins, like, to that point, but I think we're just sort of like, starting this season. I think the Eigen layer one is going to be incredible as well. I think Coinbase's base chain is going to do an airdrop. That's going to be very lucrative as well.
00:23:20.384 - 00:23:20.816, Speaker B: Wow.
00:23:20.880 - 00:23:22.664, Speaker E: You think there's going to be a base token?
00:23:22.784 - 00:23:36.844, Speaker A: Almost certainly, yeah. Their, their chief legal counsel said, you know, they weren't ruling it out. Uh, Jesse has talked a lot about sort of like, spitting base out from Coinbase. He said that publicly, and I think it's just a requirement at this point. And it's good for everybody.
00:23:36.884 - 00:23:37.108, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:37.156 - 00:23:50.644, Speaker A: The company will get some tokens and make a ton of money. The community makes a ton of money. The founding team makes a ton of money, and it helps you compete. So it seems like a win win. The incentives are lined up, and my thesis has been for a long time that everyone's going to have a token.
00:23:50.804 - 00:24:04.728, Speaker E: There's no free lunch in reality, so I'm curious if what you're saying happens, theoretically, the price of the stock should go down. You're taking an asset out, removing it and creating, like, a value somewhere else, you would think.
00:24:04.776 - 00:24:24.744, Speaker A: But do you. Do you think Wall street is valuing base at all? Right, my hunch would probably be no. Like, everything I see from all analysts is like, they're just looking at fees paid and, like, fees, you know, and just comparing how their fees are doing from. From swaps, which Coinbus has publicly stated is not the future of their business. But it seems to me that's all Wall street really cares about right now.
00:24:24.864 - 00:24:25.240, Speaker D: What is.
00:24:25.272 - 00:24:33.104, Speaker B: What is base sequencer revenue? The sequence of revenue is actually meaningful, right? Oh, actually, no. It's only $7 million. For Q three, it's probably not that much.
00:24:33.404 - 00:25:10.874, Speaker D: They can get quite close to nine figures, I think. If you are really seeing a ton of activity, I think there's actually a really interesting architecture for Coinbase, which is Coinbase stock is valued on EBITDA, cash flows, all the normal metrics, and you can actually be the sequencer there and collect the cash flows. But if you drop a token, it doesn't matter. If you like doing any value accrual or anything like that to CT, they're going to bid that up for like a 5 billion, $10 billion valuation. So actually, like, pick up value on both sides, which is like, Wall street will actually value the sequencing fees when it shows up in your p and l at like a reasonable size. And then CT will just bid you bid based to some ridiculous value.
00:25:11.494 - 00:25:25.152, Speaker B: You're 100% right. And then don't pass back any of the sequence of revenue to the token. Just keep it in the company. But count the token on your balance sheet for the company so it pushes up the equity even more. The best of both worlds.
00:25:25.288 - 00:25:25.680, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:25:25.752 - 00:25:33.512, Speaker A: My thesis has been for a while that the equity and token will both be monetized until it's no longer feasible. And I think Uniswap is the best example of that.
00:25:33.608 - 00:25:37.604, Speaker E: Tyche. How about you? Is wormhole being generous and kind to you?
00:25:37.944 - 00:25:47.604, Speaker C: Yeah. So I haven't checked all my wallets because I've been busy, but on my EVM wallets, I only got a few thousand. I do need to check my terra station wallets.
00:25:48.104 - 00:25:49.560, Speaker E: I don't know where my seed phrase is.
00:25:49.592 - 00:26:08.598, Speaker C: I have to. I've been looking for it, but I remember frantically bridging Ust out of terra to like, avalanche, to like, just sell. So I've done that many times. So I feel like, I should be able to get like, a decent amount of w tokens that way. And also I bridged Algorand and stuff, so I think I'll get a decent amount.
00:26:08.726 - 00:26:15.718, Speaker E: Yeah, I saw that. There's like, algorand wallets, taro wallets. There's like all these things that, you know, we were using many years ago.
00:26:15.806 - 00:26:16.390, Speaker B: So we'll see.
00:26:16.422 - 00:26:39.244, Speaker C: I made no money on Algorand, but maybe the wormhole airdrop. And this is so good for everyone because if I get this airdrop, another thing I was thinking about is whenever you get an airdrop, it just feels like house money, like free money. So I think people are more willing to just degen with it and just reinvest that into whatever does. That's hot right now. So I think it can also add to the momentum of, I guess, the on chain economy.
00:26:39.584 - 00:27:25.034, Speaker E: It does, and it generates a crazy situation during the launch. I think Thicci trades launches very closely and thinking this is going to be probably one of the more interesting launches because you have on the one side just a very strong project. It's very, very promising, and it's going to be valued very highly. And then you're going to have billions of dollars potentially, of airdrops, of people, just some people will want to be long term holders, some people will want to cash out and that generate these interesting wicks at the beginning and people, too much selling pressure, then it recovers. Have you been scoping this out? Do you expect the usual sell off and recovery or what do you think?
00:27:25.334 - 00:27:42.024, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's inevitable. I think it's interesting to think about where the money will come from to buy these tokens and then the sellers that sell where that money will go, where they rotate to. Those are the two main, I guess, ideas I look for for every airdrop.
00:27:42.144 - 00:27:42.400, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:27:42.432 - 00:28:03.272, Speaker C: And if you expect the airdrop meta to continue, it's also bullish because if you have to claim and sell these tokens on Mainnet, it helps ETH become more deflationary in a way. So it's kind of this continuous loop of on chain transactions. Oh, the on chain people make money, they buy more stuff on chain.
00:28:03.368 - 00:28:47.530, Speaker E: Yeah. This is the usual meme of the elephant with the trunk going down below. But staying on the topic of the wormhole airdrop, there's two more interesting things that I thought are kind of unique that they did. Number one, NFT associations that they've done, they've obviously airdropped to some NFT collections, including mad lads. So like, hello to all the lads out there, fellow lads, the reality is when you get it usually gets dumped. One very cool thing they've done, I don't know if you guys caught this, they will be streaming like 80%. They can get like 20% at the beginning and then they'll be streaming the rest I think over like a year or two years or something.
00:28:47.530 - 00:29:15.320, Speaker E: So it actually gives Nfts cash flow, which is insane, but I think we're finally there. This is the first time that I actually feel that my thesis of like, you know, NFTs becoming this like magnet for community and like brand, you know, awareness and people throwing money at it through creating this like cash flow over, over time where like it actually has like a DCF at this point. It was just crazy.
00:29:15.432 - 00:29:44.356, Speaker A: Can I ask you guys on that note, like is it, you know, Taiki mentioned that we think of airdrops as free money sometimes when we get it psychologically. I think teams are starting to think that too. I think FuBAR's tweet like really highlights that. Well here he said modern airdrops be like used product. You get one token, restake, twenty cents of scam, Celestia fork, ten tokens and then join the Discord channel for a competitor between two and 03:00 a.m.. UTC. And then like to tweet with an emoji and got 1000 tokens.
00:29:44.356 - 00:30:04.234, Speaker A: And I'm curious like why are teams giving free money, like free pseudo equity out to people that have nothing to do with the project and will not benefit the project in like a material way? Is it, is it just a vibe with the community or what's going on here? Why, why are people airdropping to NFT communities?
00:30:04.894 - 00:30:30.790, Speaker E: Yeah, so it's not just NFT communities. So the very interesting thing, which is the second point I was getting to that you brought up, is Monad. Monad has gotten an airdrop. And people might say Monad's not even live. Like there's no wallets. Like how, how is Monad getting an airdrop? And this is an off chain airdrop. So they are, I guess giving tokens to the discord community of Monad just to kind of pre associate and pre generate the vibes.
00:30:30.790 - 00:30:43.634, Speaker E: And this was, you know, something a little bit controversial, but I think makes sense. Curious to get thoughts from you guys who has a strong opinion on off chain airdrop participation.
00:30:44.214 - 00:31:02.024, Speaker B: I think it's very good. And I think like you want to, like you actually want to decentralize your token amongst people that are not going to sell it, but like potentially join your community. You're kind of like, bribing seeding a community startup. So if the community is strong like monads or mad labs, I think it's very smart to do well.
00:31:02.064 - 00:31:48.746, Speaker E: Look, I mean, the reality is, Justin has a great point. Why is this happening? It's just a very strange situation. And I have thought about this extensively. Like, my explanation is that the value of attention is so high because there's, like, new entrants coming in. And if the existing, like, core group are talking about, let's say, like, monad, even if they're just, like, a thousand people, when, like, a million people come in, they'll be, like, asking their cousin or the guy that they know that is, like, really deep, and they'll be getting information from them. So if you give that guy, you know, $10,000 and he, like, then shields, it's like, the 100 cousins that he has, you're kind of, like, buying a lot of customers for cheaper than it looks like. And, Taiki, you're probably the perfect example where, like, whenever you get an airdrop, you're like, this is the future.
00:31:48.746 - 00:31:52.018, Speaker E: And when you don't get it, you're like, this is going to zero scam.
00:31:52.186 - 00:32:22.054, Speaker C: I call this activist airdrop farming, where it's like, I don't accept, like, paid chills, right? So, like, I will never, like, accept money to, like, shill, but the only way to get my stamp of approval is to airdrop to, you know, to me. Uh, so I feel like that's also, like, this element. It's like, free marketing. Um, I guess there's also concerns around, I guess, regulation. Maybe it's more ethical and it's more regulatory compliant to air drop 10% with a supply versus just, like, you know, like, a 2% float or something?
00:32:22.134 - 00:32:22.422, Speaker E: No, no.
00:32:22.438 - 00:32:38.190, Speaker C: I feel like. And also the team has the incentive to just start their vesting in cliff schedules. So I just think that this year is going to be just every other week, like, a decent airdrop, and then everyone on Twitter is gonna be bull posting, and then it's gonna be a vibe. I'm really looking forward to it.
00:32:38.302 - 00:32:57.702, Speaker E: It's a vibe. And, like, what it is. Closest analogy to, I think, is, you know, the casino is active right now. Binance. Like, all these casinos are friggin active. And if you get to be the coin of the week or the coin of the month, because everybody gave everybody a little bit, now everybody's looking at the chart because they have to sell. And Dubai premarket.
00:32:57.702 - 00:33:09.624, Speaker E: Can I pre hedge, like, w has done an amazing job. They got, like we talked about the first one letter. One letter ticker. They're giving $2 billion to, like, infinite people.
00:33:10.044 - 00:33:11.844, Speaker B: Threshold. Thresholds. Just tea.
00:33:11.924 - 00:33:13.384, Speaker E: Yes, that's true.
00:33:14.004 - 00:33:15.156, Speaker C: Maybe it's the second.
00:33:15.340 - 00:33:17.424, Speaker E: 1 second. It's the first blue chip.
00:33:20.244 - 00:33:21.984, Speaker B: Threshold is caught straight.
00:33:23.764 - 00:33:30.824, Speaker E: We have a founder of a project that, you know, will presumably be having to make decisions around this kind of thing.
00:33:30.904 - 00:33:33.084, Speaker B: Do ETH. ETH.
00:33:34.064 - 00:33:40.604, Speaker E: ETH. No, no, no. ETH. Two. ETH. Two. I think the temporary thing, that should be g.
00:33:40.604 - 00:33:44.504, Speaker E: That's how guy goes by. Just g. What do you think, guy?
00:33:44.624 - 00:33:47.964, Speaker D: I think that would be extremely narcissistic to do that.
00:33:48.624 - 00:33:50.204, Speaker A: So you're saying there's a chance.
00:33:52.504 - 00:34:05.740, Speaker D: I do actually have a question for you, which is whether you think, like, Athena is a full ticker. I know some people sometimes do that. Or just taking the last three letters at NR makes more sense because I don't think you see it that often, where it's, like a longer one and it seems to split people quite a bit.
00:34:05.812 - 00:34:15.420, Speaker A: I think neither of those are good names, to be honest. For a token. Yeah. You need something a little more memeable, something more exciting, like yield or something like that.
00:34:15.492 - 00:34:21.824, Speaker C: The best sticker is like three letters. I think that's usually the best three or four. It's like bitcoin eat soul.
00:34:22.144 - 00:34:22.520, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:34:22.552 - 00:34:47.136, Speaker A: What if you just did dollar sign? I have a story about this. We were, when we were doing something else at Astaria, we were gonna launch tokens that weren't our governance token, and we were gonna put the asterisk symbol in a token. And there's actually nothing preventing you from doing that. Like, you could just do dollar sign for your token ticker, which I think would be so cool and unique, you're.
00:34:47.160 - 00:34:49.244, Speaker B: Never getting sex listed, but that would be cool.
00:34:50.634 - 00:35:04.294, Speaker C: And also wait, because I know, like, some teams prefer to have their ticker start with an a, so it shows up at the top of, like, centralized exchanges. If you use, like, an asterisk, does that put you at the top or, like, the people bottom?
00:35:04.714 - 00:35:06.974, Speaker A: We'd have to test it out on uniswap.
00:35:07.354 - 00:35:14.654, Speaker B: The ticker. The ticker philosophy is always a hilarious conversation. I saw one listed on Bybit called 10 million AI doge.
00:35:16.654 - 00:35:18.394, Speaker E: That's doing really well, actually.
00:35:19.734 - 00:35:28.142, Speaker D: I do think it's generally underrated, though, how much of an impact this can have. I mean, the ondo condo thing, I think was brilliant, and you see that everywhere.
00:35:28.198 - 00:35:34.078, Speaker A: Ando just put in all time highs while we were on this call. That's why I've been a little distracted. It's, I think, $0.61.
00:35:34.166 - 00:35:41.932, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that that meme alone was actually worth a few billion of the FTP. That's how good it was. So you underrate how powerful these things can be.
00:35:42.078 - 00:35:56.560, Speaker E: Yeah. You know, ondo condo you had apt apartment, you had Sayan, you know, dragon ball. I think that generated like a nice 4 billion of market cap for say so. Absolutely. I think, gee, you're gonna have to.
00:35:56.672 - 00:36:00.564, Speaker A: Do you guys want to know the story behind the word Ondo?
00:36:01.744 - 00:36:02.408, Speaker E: Go ahead.
00:36:02.496 - 00:36:15.980, Speaker A: It means wave in Esperanto. Esperanto was like an international language that someone was trying to start and found. So it translates to wave. Fun story because the founders from Hawaii and the logos of kind of like a wave.
00:36:16.172 - 00:36:29.276, Speaker E: Interesting, interesting. That's. That's pretty cool. So, yeah, guy, I think. I think something like that. Does Arthur have any ideas for a dollar?
00:36:29.380 - 00:36:44.222, Speaker D: Well, that's actually where. That's where the Anna comes from. So greek for one is Anna. So it was like ETH and then one together, but it hasn't got the same ring as the condo thing going on, so we'll give another think about that.
00:36:44.358 - 00:36:49.874, Speaker E: It sounds a little bit like Athena as well. Was that sort of part of the nameplay?
00:36:50.174 - 00:37:06.364, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. Yeah. So, like, the Athena is obviously like the greek goddess, I think, of war. And there's quite a few firms out there who actually use Athena, which I think is actually quite a clean name. So, yeah, it was just a play on, like, ETH, and then the Enna was greek for being one. I thought, like, tied it together.
00:37:07.344 - 00:37:13.644, Speaker C: If it was Athena, then you can make the ticker all time highs, right? Ath, that would be super bullish.
00:37:14.104 - 00:37:27.568, Speaker D: That's actually good. Yeah. But also I think, like, if you move away from having just ETH within USD, which is obviously possible, like, on the roadmap, you might normally have, like, ETH at the front of your name as well. So that's actually a very good call.
00:37:27.656 - 00:37:41.004, Speaker E: All time high ina, I love it. Okay, that's a great idea. Cool. But apart from ticker names, so in terms of what you guys are doing, you have this shard thing and people call points miles, or what is Pendle calling them?
00:37:41.084 - 00:37:41.388, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:37:41.396 - 00:37:51.228, Speaker E: That is there's different names for them out there. I think shards is one of the cooler ones. How do you think about shards? Are they going to be like, you know, one to one with airdrops or what's your strategy?
00:37:51.316 - 00:38:23.720, Speaker D: Yeah, I think what's interesting about it now, you've also got, like, markets that are, like, forming around it. So I think it's quite interesting that, like, with crypto, even when you try to not put liquidity around something, people still find a way to actually trade it and form markets around it. So the stuff that's going on with Wales market, I think is quite interesting. They actually listed today, they listed SUSD as, like, a collateral asset to actually trade. So you can put down SUSD and yield while you're actually trading the points. And then I think the stop of the pendle is actually brilliant. And it's actually, people look at it and they think that it's just a bit of a points casino at the moment.
00:38:23.720 - 00:38:47.914, Speaker D: I think on the surface that can be, like, the first way that you view it, but I actually think what they're doing beneath the surface is actually super interesting. And it's the beginning of actual fixed income on Defi for the first time. All that's to say, I think it's quite interesting now that you can see speculative markets forming around these things before you have any idea around ftvs percentage of token supply, it really is at the very bottom of the level of degeneracy that you can find within this market.
00:38:48.814 - 00:38:49.454, Speaker C: Let's say.
00:38:49.534 - 00:39:15.134, Speaker E: I'm just saying, you're a founder and you haven't decided yet. You know exactly how many points there's gonna be. Like, even you, who's the guy deciding, you don't know ultimately, like, how many points, what's gonna be the value? And then you got some clowns, like, buying and selling the points and, like, deciding, like, a fair value, and you're like, I can just issue ten times as many points. Like, what are you guys doing? Like, it's just full degeneracy, right?
00:39:15.434 - 00:39:51.364, Speaker D: It is quite crazy because the number, it's like, it's multivariate, right? Where you've got, like, duration, you've got percentage of supply, and you've got FTV. All of these things can move a lot. Like, even the percentage of supply can move quite a bit. But what is interesting about that is when you've got three wide variables that can be very different, is that they can be quite mispriced, actually. So, like, on this pendle stuff, you saw some pretty interesting price action around, like the Athena one, where it was trading at, like, a 40% implied yield. And then one guy put out a thread one day, and it traded up to, like, 110% in a single day. And so when you're owning that leverage on YT, that was actually a lot of money that people made doing that.
00:39:51.364 - 00:39:59.744, Speaker D: So it can be like, pretty wildly mispriced because of the fact that these variables can move quite a bit. And I think a lot of people who are playing in that aren't running the maths the whole time.
00:39:59.824 - 00:40:20.346, Speaker E: Absolutely. I mean, we saw another one that was friend tech points that got massively rerated. They just sort of made an announcement saying that I guess everything would get distributed to points suddenly. I guess friendtech is relevant again. I mean, it seemed very irrelevant for a while. Taiki, have you been following the points? Have you been looking at it?
00:40:20.410 - 00:40:45.838, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they're going to do a 100% community airdrop and they're going to introduce liquidity mining whenever the token does go live. Sometime this month, I believe the way I played it is like, okay, like, there's probably going to be, even if frontec dies twelve months from now, they're going to at least try to pump it again one last time. So I think it's worth buying, like, Ansem's keys. So I just bought Ansem's keys and it's like, it's up like 80%.
00:40:45.966 - 00:40:50.822, Speaker E: Is anyone, like, is he, is he, like, still posting there? Is anyone still around?
00:40:50.958 - 00:40:52.606, Speaker B: Not yet. Not yet.
00:40:52.670 - 00:40:58.870, Speaker C: No. He's posting in there. He's posting. I forgot what he said. Honestly, he's just like bull posting everywhere.
00:40:59.022 - 00:41:00.006, Speaker B: I should go post to mine.
00:41:00.030 - 00:41:01.054, Speaker D: I'll get my keys popped.
00:41:01.094 - 00:41:02.982, Speaker B: I can get some heat put into Athena.
00:41:03.038 - 00:41:03.836, Speaker E: There we go.
00:41:03.990 - 00:41:09.768, Speaker B: Wait, we need to have a lawyer on this call one day because, like, points definitely seem like a security to me.
00:41:09.856 - 00:41:11.712, Speaker A: Wassee lawyer. Let's go.
00:41:11.848 - 00:41:17.576, Speaker B: We need to get a lawyer on here. I feel like some, some protocols is going to get hit hard on this.
00:41:17.720 - 00:41:20.512, Speaker A: I think we're past that point, honestly.
00:41:20.648 - 00:41:25.404, Speaker D: That's why we went with shots, because I agree with you on points, but charts are completely different.
00:41:29.304 - 00:41:48.708, Speaker E: All right, so before we go to pasta of the week, I do want to take like five minutes. And then. And we have guy on. We talked a little bit about Athena last time. We had questions from the audience in terms of how sustainable is this? There's different thoughts about this. Let's go through some of the greatest hits. Guy, what do you think?
00:41:48.796 - 00:41:50.012, Speaker D: Yep, happy to do it.
00:41:50.108 - 00:42:02.874, Speaker E: Yeah. So I guess number one is the sort of terra comparison. You see really high yields and people start wondering when things are going to blow up. How do you address that?
00:42:02.994 - 00:42:48.480, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the terror comparisons are probably the weakest things we saw on CT on the first week. When it came out, it was kind of like, I actually understand why there's initial skepticism and pushback. And I actually think that that's quite healthy after what we saw last cycle, which is I actually quite want people to actually question things when they see it come out. I think it was slightly frustrating though, because in immediate comparison to Terra, when you just look at the mechanism and the collateral and all those kind of things, if you spend five minutes on it and you try to understand it, you'd see that it's very different. I think the one key thing to just point out here, well, actually two. So one is obviously Terra was backed by nothing except for the belief in future value of Luna, and then market makers who are acting as a central bank behind it on the margin. While here you've actually got collateral, which is ETH, BTC, whatever it is, and then a corresponding hedge on the other side.
00:42:48.480 - 00:43:27.180, Speaker D: So it is fully collateralized, which Luna obviously was not. And then I think the other key difference is just think about the interest rate, which is one of the big mistakes I think they made among many, was actually just fixing the anchor rate of 20% when you're coming to the tail end of the bull market. So in the midway through the bull, everyone thought that 20% was weak, actually, and Anchor wasn't getting much traction. But then when market rates fell down to 10% at the back end of the bull, that's actually when you saw anchor tick up quite a bit. The key difference here is that the interest rate attached to Athena is purely exogenous to our system. So it's purely markets at interest rate where if there's demand for leverage via perhaps and the staking, it's high and when there's not, it's low. And we adjust to that.
00:43:27.180 - 00:43:44.356, Speaker D: So I think that's a key piece that's different here, which is you can really think of like the supply of USD is just responding to markets at interest rates. And if the interest rate unlevered cash and carries at 60%, that's the market saying that USD is too small and it needs to grow. And if it's too low, it's the opposite. So I think that's a key difference.
00:43:44.500 - 00:44:02.370, Speaker E: Yeah, I agree. It is kind of like a weak comparison. I was obviously like very vocal during the terra days. Days. And, you know, this to me is just people ask, where's the yield come from? It comes from thickie buying dog coins. Like, it's the same. It's the same thing where people are just longing without looking at the funding rate.
00:44:02.370 - 00:44:26.994, Speaker E: You know, people talk about this bonk guy. Yeah, you know, cool trade. Like you bought low and like, you're still holding, you're going to hold it forever. I think the estimate I saw was like near a million dollars. He's already paid in funding. So, like, if he just keeps holding, even if the thing, like, doesn't go down, there's a draining happening by people like Athena that are kind of providing that spot basis. So that's the source of the funding.
00:44:26.994 - 00:44:44.914, Speaker E: And I think the stronger maybe criticisms around, like, centralized exchanges. Right. So we've seen a lot of bad stuff happen with centralized exchanges in the past, not just FTX. You guys have already gotten a roster of, I think, is it four or five? How many centralized exchanges?
00:44:45.454 - 00:44:49.054, Speaker D: We're executing on five. And we've got like seven who are investors.
00:44:49.214 - 00:44:57.550, Speaker E: Yeah. So are you doing due diligence in all these exchanges? What if one of them blows up? It's not.
00:44:57.742 - 00:45:23.178, Speaker D: Yeah, 100%. So this was a very key piece of the infrastructure that we put in place with Athena. So Arthur's idea actually didn't include what we've done on the custody side. And this is a bit where I actually disagreed with him. I was not happy taking users assets and just throwing them on the centralized exchange. What we're doing is basically taking them and putting them in institutional great custodians. So you can basically hold your assets there and then mirror them onto centralized exchanges, which obviously helps to reduce the credit risk to those venues on the other side.
00:45:23.178 - 00:45:29.858, Speaker D: You haven't brought the credit risk down to zero, but if something does happen with one of the exchanges, you always have to collateral to get back to the users on the other side.
00:45:29.986 - 00:45:44.590, Speaker E: How did you manage to do that? Aren't the exchanges always wanting people to be directly deposit into their wallets? Did you have to get Arthur into a room with them and sort of godfather them, or how did you get that done?
00:45:44.782 - 00:46:26.960, Speaker D: Some of them were easier than others, I think. It's not just us, by the way, who's trying to do this. After FTX, some of the largest trading funds in the space refused to actually leave their collateral in some of these venues at certain sizes. And so it was kind of like a team effort between us and other investors who are large traders and different funds who have started to demand this since FTX. Ultimately, these exchanges, we are their customer, and if you are bringing volume and size and you have a request, it's like any other relationship where they just want to do right by their customers. But, yeah, I think it's like a natural process that the crypto space is going to go through. And actually, I think it's a really healthy development and market structure where having custody, execution, and settlement put together in the same black box, I do not think is actually the correct market structure.
00:46:26.960 - 00:47:18.846, Speaker D: And that's something that tried buy actually does better than crypto, and I hope that that's actually where the industry sort of evolves, and Athena can play, like, some small part in that. So, yeah, that's how we think about the custody piece and the exchange risk. And I think one of the pieces just point out here is that people have been quite critical that it's not like sitting in a smart contract and obviously got this dependence on custodians. I saw some interesting data that came out of into the block, which is actually just looking at what's the probability of default of leaving your assets within a smart contract on DeFi. And 7% of the time when you put your money into a smart contract, you actually get zeroed on the other side, which is an insanely high number. If you just ask, would you rather leave your money in an institutional great custodian, a smart contract, or a sax? The data just says that it's unequivocally safer to have it in a custodian. I know it doesn't align with the ethos and stuff of a lot of stuff on chain, but we thought it was an appropriate trade off that we could.
00:47:18.846 - 00:47:20.366, Speaker D: The access liquidity.
00:47:20.510 - 00:47:55.106, Speaker E: Yeah. You know, I think, like, this cycle, what we're seeing is things like blast and Athena are, you know, trying to provide a better user experience or, you know, just do something without adhering to the pure decentralization on chain ethos. And I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to explore that space. I've always been a little bit into the web 2.5 use cases. Sometimes, if you can significantly increase the. The product and then the user experience, then, you know, there's some trade offs that can get decided upon.
00:47:55.106 - 00:48:19.704, Speaker E: Last question. So Arthur Hayes obviously came up with some of the idea of what you're working on, and he's, like, a very strong investor in your project. When you deal with these exchanges, there's, like, the goddaddy, right? He came up with the whole perpetual thing for Bitmex back in the day. Like, at what point do you, like, bring him in the room? You're trying to, like, negotiate something? Like, oh, I'm getting a call. It's my buddy Arthur. Like, he. Do you mind.
00:48:19.704 - 00:48:23.376, Speaker E: Do you guys mind if he. If he joins us? Like, when do you do that? When do you pull that card?
00:48:23.520 - 00:49:05.276, Speaker D: Unfortunately, I can't pull that card. Barely ever. He's always sitting, he's always skiing, so he's never around to actually jump. But, yeah, no, I think he's just to get to your comment more seriously, I do think it's quite interesting between the different centralized exchanges, there's obviously healthy competition between them around, obviously competitors that you dislike and you want to beat. But actually, with Arthur, there seems to be this overwhelming sense of respect because he ultimately created the product that made all of these guys billionaires. So I think it is quite interesting that while they don't like each other, they all seem to have this underlying respect for Arthur. And, yeah, I think we obviously have good, healthy relationships with all of them that we're working with.
00:49:05.276 - 00:49:15.744, Speaker D: I think they're all investors, so they believed in what we're doing independent of his involvement. And so he hasn't actually been that involved in terms of getting things over the line to get what we need for the product.
00:49:15.864 - 00:49:46.494, Speaker B: I was just going to say I was a little annoyed because I've been putting on this long Steve or me short ETH perp trade for a year, and it's very good yields. And then just this past week, I was like, well, because I have that trade on delta neutral that I want, bitcoin, perps. And usually ETH funding is always higher than bitcoin. So I'm making money and I'm getting a free long, basically. But, like, the past two weeks, like, I've been losing money. I was like, what is going on? And then I finally looked at Athena TV. I'm like, 830 million, only in ETH.
00:49:46.494 - 00:49:48.714, Speaker B: I'm like, dude, these guys took my trade.
00:49:49.894 - 00:50:08.298, Speaker D: Exactly what you're describing there. This is the first week that we've actually seen ourselves sort of, like, impact BTC versus ETH funding. And actually, the venues that we're not on, there's now a discrepancy between, like, Athena venues and non Athena venues. So, yeah, it is starting to have, like, a marginal impact on the market. But we can go push down BTC for you next month if you want.
00:50:08.346 - 00:50:13.334, Speaker B: Well, I'm moving it over to bitcoin now, but I'm guessing in a month's time and I'll have to move it back into.
00:50:15.594 - 00:50:15.906, Speaker E: Then.
00:50:15.930 - 00:50:19.178, Speaker C: You go to Solana and then chasing.
00:50:19.226 - 00:50:20.218, Speaker B: Me wherever I go.
00:50:20.306 - 00:50:23.666, Speaker E: Altcoins just keep on the dot coin at the end.
00:50:23.690 - 00:50:26.058, Speaker B: I'll just be stuck in these dog coins. Yeah, exactly.
00:50:26.146 - 00:50:44.240, Speaker E: There's still plenty of stuff that's like 1515 bits window. Like I was looking today, I had to move my axlr position from. From perps to spot. I put it. I put it on spot instead because like, it was like 16 bits of window. I mean, I want to hold this thing, but I'm not paying that on perps. So.
00:50:44.352 - 00:50:44.640, Speaker B: Cool.
00:50:44.672 - 00:50:50.472, Speaker E: Guys, let's. Let's move to our last segment. Let's do our past of the week. Maybe, Justin, you can take it from here.
00:50:50.648 - 00:50:54.920, Speaker A: Sure. Am I allowed? Well, I got. Am I allowed to entries again?
00:50:54.952 - 00:50:55.224, Speaker D: I got.
00:50:55.264 - 00:51:31.406, Speaker A: I have one that I have to bring up just because there's a story here. So Evan, super fan of the show. Big fan of me personally. He's in a couple group chats and he tweeted out, I'm going to tell my kids. This was Jim Cramer. And unfortunately, it's a picture of Tyche getting carted out from that Spider man scene because Tike unfortunately marked the bottom, allegedly encanto. And I just found out before we started this call that tikey or that thickie and Jordyn both longed Kanto when Tyke sold, which I think is distasteful and against the spirit of the steady.
00:51:31.430 - 00:51:32.154, Speaker D: Lady.
00:51:34.494 - 00:51:39.278, Speaker C: I might leave this podcast now. Actually, you need to give half of.
00:51:39.286 - 00:51:43.274, Speaker A: Your profits to Tyche. This is ridiculous. I would never counter trade any of you guys.
00:51:43.614 - 00:51:52.694, Speaker B: I didn't even know. I just bought it because the chart looks so bad. And I was like, tyche likes this coin. It must be a good coin. It's only after I learned that Taki.
00:51:52.734 - 00:52:06.044, Speaker E: Sold taiki, you know, you gave us a good liquidation entry point. So much appreciated. Next time I'll take you to a nice greek dinner. Once again, it'll be on me.
00:52:08.024 - 00:52:25.482, Speaker A: But that's not my entry, though. Although I think that's hilarious. It's a little niche, but shout out to Clayton for making that and Evan for tweeting it. My real pasta is Poehler retweeting David Hoffman. David Hoffman said ETH is AI money. And Poehler was like, I mean, it's not. It literally has nothing to do with AI.
00:52:25.482 - 00:52:42.074, Speaker A: Why do we do this to ourselves? And we can debate? You know, I think there are some use cases for AI here, but I thought this was absolutely hilarious. Like, we are certainly just following into this. This new narrative here. We were. I don't know, when is Athena going to be AI money? That's what we're wondering.
00:52:42.194 - 00:52:44.114, Speaker D: Whenever it's bumping, let's do it.
00:52:44.154 - 00:52:44.914, Speaker A: Hell, yeah.
00:52:45.074 - 00:53:05.244, Speaker E: I mean, the AI are going to be, like, making decisions around, like, you know, which. Which stable coins and which assets and, you know, which things to put money into. And if Athena is going to be the one with the big yield and the good risk reward, it could be AI money guy. That's maybe, like, your next tagline for when you go next stage.
00:53:05.404 - 00:53:05.892, Speaker D: More roll.
00:53:05.908 - 00:53:07.700, Speaker E: Was that taiki? What do you have?
00:53:07.812 - 00:53:10.068, Speaker C: Yeah, so, Justin, if you can pull mine up.
00:53:10.156 - 00:53:10.332, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:53:10.348 - 00:53:49.232, Speaker C: It's from Mister Kunti cakes. Jmo. We had him on the pod, and I guess it's. He's a study sailor, literally 100 IQ, doesn't know how to DCA, never used a single smart contract, doesn't have metamask, claimed zero air jobs, not participating in any points programs, does a line and then hits the green button. And he's more successful than anybody else in the industry. So, you know, I feel like this kind of goes back to the idea of if you just stay in crypto long enough and you don't get liquidated, then, like, the market will bail you out. And I think in our day to day, we try so much to, like, you know, like, trade, farm, whatever, but most of the times we're, like, just better off holding.
00:53:49.368 - 00:53:50.216, Speaker A: What the heck is that?
00:53:50.240 - 00:53:52.600, Speaker B: Jordy, there's only one chair, man.
00:53:52.672 - 00:53:53.404, Speaker D: You need.
00:53:55.144 - 00:53:57.784, Speaker C: It's a single chair. It's my favorite person.
00:53:57.944 - 00:54:10.716, Speaker A: People do say crypto so hard, but it really pretty much every sick. Everyone that hasn't sold has been bailed out officially now, which is insane to think about. Everyone has been bailed out. If you just. If you just stick with it, you're going to be okay.
00:54:10.840 - 00:54:13.504, Speaker B: Kamikaze is gonna come after you again, Justin.
00:54:16.244 - 00:54:18.260, Speaker A: Is that a good transition to your pasta?
00:54:18.292 - 00:54:18.628, Speaker D: Is that.
00:54:18.676 - 00:54:20.024, Speaker A: Is that part of your pasta?
00:54:21.084 - 00:54:22.868, Speaker B: We should share that eventually, though.
00:54:23.036 - 00:54:24.212, Speaker E: What do you got, Dicky?
00:54:24.348 - 00:54:29.384, Speaker B: Let me pull it up. I sound like some guy sent me a YouTube short yesterday.
00:54:29.684 - 00:54:46.572, Speaker E: The co founder of €3 Capital, a now defunct cryptocurrency hedge fund, was arrested this evening at Changji airport, Singapore. The co founder of the once billion dollar, now bankrupt company was detained after trying to leave the country and has been sentenced to four months in prison for a freedom to cooperate with witness investigators who are investigating a virtual. Authorities are currently searching for.
00:54:46.588 - 00:54:47.184, Speaker B: Kyle.
00:54:48.524 - 00:54:58.276, Speaker E: Oh, my God. I can't believe it. You know, last episode, I was saying, like, you know, we have thickie with us, and it was Suzu, and. And I guess somebody got confused, sticky.
00:54:58.300 - 00:54:58.596, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:54:58.620 - 00:54:59.984, Speaker E: They put your face on there.
00:55:01.204 - 00:55:05.024, Speaker A: That smirk, though. It's just like you really want to punch it.
00:55:07.924 - 00:55:23.704, Speaker B: I used to think people like, I guess it's like a common, you know, most people just think I look like him. It's interesting. I don't think it seemed like a genuine mistake by this guy. Yeah, he literally, genuinely thought that was him.
00:55:25.724 - 00:55:26.508, Speaker E: Oh, man.
00:55:26.596 - 00:55:44.784, Speaker A: Vicki, can we, can we pull up this, this little piece of hate mail we got? And I didn't get support from any of you guys, so. But think you shared this with me. Um, apparently I'm labeled as the ETH guy on the show, which I don't know why is true. If you guys have listened, I've criticized ETH all the time.
00:55:44.864 - 00:55:46.224, Speaker B: Even the ETH guy.
00:55:46.344 - 00:55:47.568, Speaker C: You are the eat guy.
00:55:47.696 - 00:55:48.640, Speaker D: You are the ETH.
00:55:48.672 - 00:55:52.160, Speaker A: Maxi, what do I have to do to change that?
00:55:52.312 - 00:55:54.324, Speaker C: It's buy something other than ETH.
00:55:55.024 - 00:55:55.560, Speaker B: It's good.
00:55:55.592 - 00:55:56.200, Speaker E: Yeah. Yeah.
00:55:56.312 - 00:55:57.744, Speaker C: It's like lead into it. You're fine.
00:55:57.864 - 00:55:58.328, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:55:58.416 - 00:56:26.056, Speaker A: All right, fuck it. I'm the youth guy. In any case, this guy's accusing me of being so delusional that it would be like betting against a monkey to bet against, to bet against me that I think the approval is going to happen. And he said he, like, you know, delivered all this fundamental analysis and my only response is, do you want to bet on it? But this guy gave no argument of why the SEC will not approve ETH. And in fact, this guy's Twitter handle is kamikaze ETH. So I don't know what this guy is doing. He's supposed to be an ETH guy too, but, you know, there's a, he's.
00:56:26.080 - 00:56:29.600, Speaker E: Accepting his roles, like, yeah, I'm an ETH guy. He's supposed to be an ETH guy too.
00:56:29.752 - 00:56:47.434, Speaker A: But one thing I will say is, like, after, you know, having this tweet, I was like, damn. You know, I was about to tweet back, like, I promised to take this back as long as you don't stab me at East Denver. Fortunately, no one attacked me. I was good. I did meet a lot of steady lads fans, though, so if I met you, thanks so much for watching, and it was really a pleasure.
00:56:47.554 - 00:56:49.934, Speaker E: Guy, do you have a, do you have a pasta?
00:56:50.594 - 00:57:13.202, Speaker D: Yeah, I scrambled to find one a few minutes ago. I think. Yeah, it's probably not just this, but Vance has been doing this, I think, on a weekly basis for the last few months, which is basically just. Basically just dunking on Jason Calacanis. Whether he's buying, like, t bills or some of the shitty series a's. He's been going into. So I don't think this one's not particularly funny.
00:57:13.202 - 00:57:24.126, Speaker D: I just think it's hilarious that every time crypto goes up, we can dunk on Jason. And I think I was looking at his cope on his feed as well. And that's just been entertaining to watch while everything's been going on.
00:57:24.310 - 00:57:29.554, Speaker A: And guy, are you running the official Athena Twitter account? I see you guys sort of tweeted at him here.
00:57:31.054 - 00:57:36.554, Speaker D: That was inspired by round straight afterwards. Yeah.
00:57:37.294 - 00:57:39.110, Speaker E: Jason Calcan is still stuck in t.
00:57:39.142 - 00:57:40.806, Speaker C: Bills and see deals of insolvent.
00:57:40.910 - 00:58:01.830, Speaker E: Okay. Strong pasta for a newcomer. That's definitely like one of the strongest newcomer pastas we've seen. Let's look, let's close out. I have one to share. I've been in the puff announcements channel for Puff. You know, we have, this has been puff's launch week and you have to use meth.
00:58:01.830 - 00:58:29.734, Speaker E: You have to use me to, to buy puff. And looks like there was an unhappy customer called Fuck fuck XRP. And Mister fuck XRP seems to have a lot of complaints. So he says, hey, could someone please point me in the right direction to get ride of this meth? All I get is meth drugs. In my searches for a way to sell meth. I can't seem to swap or sell on any Dex. I just want to get rid of this crap.
00:58:29.734 - 00:58:51.396, Speaker E: I believe this is real. Someone, someone is trying to sell this meth and is Google searching otherwise all math not getting satisfactory results. So, you know, hopefully, hopefully somebody in the comments can direct him in the right place to fulfill his math.
00:58:51.580 - 00:58:54.064, Speaker C: Maybe guy can figure out who the winner is this week.
00:58:54.804 - 00:58:58.620, Speaker D: They were actually quite good thickies. One didn't make me laugh the most, I think.
00:58:58.692 - 00:58:59.544, Speaker B: Let's go.
00:59:01.524 - 00:59:03.132, Speaker D: His tune is Friday with video, I.
00:59:03.148 - 00:59:07.244, Speaker A: Think, but with the clips of you from steady lads.
00:59:07.404 - 00:59:10.918, Speaker B: Vicki, another interview I did like last year.
00:59:11.086 - 00:59:26.974, Speaker E: Yeah, well, I think it's well deserved. I was in stitches on that one. Although it was indeed a very strong pasta week from everybody. Good job, guys. Hopefully everybody enjoyed it. Thanks, everyone for joining. Thank you, guy for hopping on and chatting dog coins and everything else with us.
00:59:27.054 - 00:59:28.278, Speaker D: I appreciate having one.
00:59:28.406 - 00:59:30.910, Speaker E: And yeah, catch everybody next week.
00:59:31.022 - 00:59:31.950, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone.
00:59:32.142 - 00:59:33.794, Speaker B: Lay off the yield for me. Please.
00:59:36.094 - 00:59:37.794, Speaker A: Withdraw. Everyone withdraw.
