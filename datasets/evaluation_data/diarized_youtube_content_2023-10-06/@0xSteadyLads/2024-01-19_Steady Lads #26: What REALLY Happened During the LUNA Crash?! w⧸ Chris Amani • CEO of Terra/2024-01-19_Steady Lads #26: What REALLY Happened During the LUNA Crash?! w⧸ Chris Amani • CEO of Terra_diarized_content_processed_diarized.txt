00:00:00.280 - 00:00:13.134, Speaker A: Yeah, it was like, I wasn't sure exactly what I was gonna do next with my career, but, I mean, do was like, this incredibly intelligent guy. I get along with him pretty well. And so I thought, yeah, I'll go help him do this. It'll be fun. What's the worst that could happen?
00:00:13.254 - 00:00:23.950, Speaker B: He's charming. I mean, like, I've never met him in person. You probably spent a lot of time with him, but I've seen his interviews and he's witty and he's extremely intelligent. Justin disagrees.
00:00:24.022 - 00:00:38.592, Speaker C: I'm sure he's quite smart. I don't know if I would say charming. I mean, we should pull up some of the memes here, but he always had to, you know, sort of glowed about how he was the richest guy on Twitter and, you know, everyone else was poor. So I don't know if charming is the right word. Maybe charismatic.
00:00:38.688 - 00:00:41.384, Speaker B: Let's say charismatic. That's what I meant to say.
00:00:41.544 - 00:00:43.724, Speaker A: I think charismatic's probably the right way to put it.
00:01:03.864 - 00:01:28.464, Speaker B: All right, welcome, everybody. Study, lads. We just had a very interesting interview that you will follow this. We learned a little bit about those, like, final days of terror and what's been happening since. It seems like there's a trial coming up soon, extraditions and all this stuff. So we'll get into that for a little bit. But curious before we get into it, Vicki, you didn't talk much during the interview.
00:01:28.464 - 00:01:33.154, Speaker B: It seems like you're pretty preoccupied with the trading, what's going on out in the markets today?
00:01:33.694 - 00:01:38.794, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, yeah. Things have been kind of nuking today after being held up at, like, 42 for a while.
00:01:39.374 - 00:01:44.262, Speaker B: Is this kind of the GBTC outflows or what do you actually think is happening?
00:01:44.438 - 00:02:23.662, Speaker D: I think there was, like, a lot of complicated dynamics going on. I think a lot of fast money was very focused on GBTC and the outflows, and I think a lot of slower money was really focused more on the inflows. So, like, we saw, like, a lot of choppy price action, especially, like, I think it was Tuesday, we saw GBC outflows stop and the discount closed, and we. We saw, like, an attempted squeeze up that, like, failed. Uh, which, like, kind of told me that, like, there was not as much demand as, you know, possible, maybe not as much shorts built up, but then now today we're seeing just like, uh, ETF volume just fall off a cliff. And I think a lot. It's starting to get to a lot of people's heads that, like, you know, they're on an island in terms of.
00:02:23.678 - 00:02:46.374, Speaker B: Demand, yeah, I think we. We're kind of looking for support. There will be support. A lot of people are saying that they're eagerly anticipating 38 or so maybe to start coming back in pretty heavy. Is that how you see it or you think we're. You think we're done? You said, you said the few times we're going to zero what's happening.
00:02:46.534 - 00:02:48.674, Speaker C: Lose this level and it's lights out.
00:02:50.734 - 00:03:11.974, Speaker D: I don't want to, like, say anything too hyperbolic. I do think there's, like, doesn't seem to be any more inflows coming in. I think a lot of funds already fully deployed and, like, we've hit, like, peak attention. So I guess we'll see. I think, like, you know, we'll have moments of defense in some levels at, like, 40 and 38, like you mentioned, but, yeah, I'm unclear. I could easily see it going all the way back home.
00:03:12.134 - 00:03:20.848, Speaker E: Oh, wow. Because your prediction was that the ETF was going to be assaulting the as. That's going to be a multi month top, and maybe that ends up happening, right?
00:03:21.016 - 00:03:50.420, Speaker B: Yeah, we're seeing some launches coming out, and that's kind of maybe saying a little bit about the market sentiment whenever you have hype launches and you see how they actually do compared to expectations. So this week we had manta. Just sort of came out pretty middle of the road, I would say. It seems to be around, like, $2 ish, a little bit above. It wasn't a disaster, but not the animal spirits that we've seen with some of the other ones.
00:03:50.572 - 00:04:17.474, Speaker E: Yeah, I think some people got, like, wrecked because they bridged the ETH over and they barely got any manta tokens as an airdrop. And, like, once you bridge for the airdrop, your ETH gets converted to stone, which is, like, staked ETH. And right now that's deep. So people bridged over, and, like, now they have this deep pegged ethanol, and they barely got any money, and they're kind of stuck in this thing and they have to wait, like, two months. I actually bought stone at a discount, you know?
00:04:17.594 - 00:04:18.894, Speaker D: Is this the only discount?
00:04:19.434 - 00:04:23.362, Speaker E: Yeah, let me. Let me check. Actually, last this morning, it was, like, off by six and a half percent.
00:04:23.498 - 00:04:24.194, Speaker A: Wow.
00:04:24.354 - 00:04:35.214, Speaker D: What the hell? I mean, dude, the manta perp was, like 10% dislocated from spot, like a solid hour. And people were really clamoring to get out of the manta.
00:04:35.654 - 00:04:37.926, Speaker E: Oh, yeah. It's off by six and a half percent right now.
00:04:38.070 - 00:04:50.254, Speaker B: Is this, like, deep? Basically, like, on the one side, you have people that are expecting the airdrop to be big, and the price of math had to be big. And on the other side, you have people that are just willing to take the arb. Yeah.
00:04:50.294 - 00:04:54.714, Speaker E: Like, for me, like, I bought the arb from like 0.90 to 0.93.
00:04:55.654 - 00:04:56.150, Speaker A: Wow.
00:04:56.222 - 00:05:12.246, Speaker E: Well, and it's the pegged because people bridge eat over for stone. Then they sell stone at this discount. They bridge back and they bridge again. So they're like betting on this airdropping worth something or they just want to get out. And that was a bad trade. According to current market pricing, it's like.
00:05:12.270 - 00:05:15.686, Speaker D: 35% APY, six and a half for 70 days.
00:05:15.710 - 00:05:16.638, Speaker B: It's not bad.
00:05:16.806 - 00:05:17.950, Speaker E: Yeah, it's not bad at all.
00:05:18.062 - 00:05:20.374, Speaker A: You got a killer one at 90.
00:05:20.454 - 00:05:21.714, Speaker D: That's a killer trade.
00:05:22.054 - 00:05:23.134, Speaker E: It was like nine oh five.
00:05:23.174 - 00:05:33.608, Speaker C: I think he did share it on steady lads. We discussed it. I was excited about it, but, yeah, I didn't buy any myself. I was focused on mantle and the Ondo launch, too.
00:05:33.736 - 00:05:35.084, Speaker D: Ondo, let's go.
00:05:35.984 - 00:06:08.124, Speaker B: Yeah, we've had, we've had an RWA launch. One of the first kind of, in that, in that sector. Everyone's been talking about the sector, but we haven't really had a lot of coins apart from Iggy's favorites, the submit curve tokens, maker, maker and trade. Um, but Ondo, I would say, has done pretty well. Uh, pretty solid. It's, it's, it's well over a billion FTV. We are seeing, you know, some speculation about how's blast going to do given, given, you know, this manta thing.
00:06:08.124 - 00:06:18.036, Speaker B: Some people had them in the same category because the same shtick of, like, I'm just gonna lock up your ETH and then, look, there's a lot of TVL. Does this any of blast taiki?
00:06:18.180 - 00:06:33.094, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I'm not really sure how to evaluate blast. I think it's trading at like $5, which implies an FDB of 5 billion. FDB? Oh, actually, no, on Avo, it's at 440. So there's like a 50% correction.
00:06:33.214 - 00:06:35.262, Speaker D: It went down because of Manta, right?
00:06:35.438 - 00:07:06.486, Speaker E: Yeah. If Manta is going to be worth like two, then I'm not sure, like, why blast should be worth any more. So seems like all the hype is kind of coming back to earth. You know, we have seen some frothy, I guess, conditions. For example, like, I saw this yesterday where Franklin Templeton, you know, in order to, I guess, market their product, they talked about, you know, Ben with hat, you know, like, just really trying to I guess ride like the meme wave.
00:07:06.670 - 00:07:30.194, Speaker B: So we did have another listing today. So I guess yesterday for people watching, but we did have with on finance. So seems like, you know, similar to Bonke. It might just be the top when it, when it gets listed. There is a Coinbase listing maybe still to come. Have you been tracking it thicky?
00:07:30.574 - 00:07:48.622, Speaker D: I like, remember when that guy just bought like $8 million of Wif and just like sets it up ten x? I like immediately bought for that because I thought like, you know, it was just great marketing. I just had no resolve and I just paper handed. I think I lost like fifteen k and if I had only held, I would have made so much more cool.
00:07:48.678 - 00:08:23.258, Speaker B: Well, we'll let you guys enjoy the interview and then we'll catch you at the end. We have a very killer meme of the week segment for you guys. Welcome to steady lads. We have a special guest today. Resamani is joining us. He is here to both share stories of cycles passed. And I think a lot of people, you know, were in the middle of a bit of a crazy resurgence and it's good to remember, I think, some of the mistakes and some of the lessons from the last cycle.
00:08:23.258 - 00:08:53.752, Speaker B: And I was a minor character, I think Chris was a little bit more of a major character. And of course, you know, we have some even more major characters that are not with us today. But I think all of us live through what was one of the most insane situations of having a top ten coin disappear overnight, I guess so. We're here to talk about that as usual. We have my lovely co host, Justin, who, you know, we'll show the meme later. We chest bump. Taiki is with us.
00:08:53.752 - 00:08:59.528, Speaker B: We're lucky to have thiki, even though it's a busy trading day. And of course, Chris. Welcome, Chris.
00:08:59.656 - 00:09:06.316, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks. Glad to be here. I can be the human face of what not to do this cycle. Is that the idea is.
00:09:06.360 - 00:09:07.092, Speaker C: No, no, no.
00:09:07.148 - 00:09:12.172, Speaker B: I mean, I think it's like we have to learn from the past so we can get better in the future, right?
00:09:12.228 - 00:09:22.024, Speaker A: No, absolutely. Yeah, no, happy to be here. Especially when I saw that you guys launch this, watch this show with the name steady lads, I was like, well, I have to. I have to be there eventually.
00:09:23.844 - 00:09:44.572, Speaker B: You're right. This is, you know, unfortunately, you know, though, is not, not in a great situation right now. But we, our podcast is named after his kind of meme. And you've dealt with him quite a lot. Maybe can you tell us kind of like, you know, how did you meet? Do and how did you end up in this, in this crazy world?
00:09:44.708 - 00:10:17.120, Speaker A: Yeah, so I guess back in. I guess it was back in 2021. I had just sold my company. My last company was a workforce management b, two B SaaS company called Humanity. I sold it, and I was working for the company that bought us for a year post that sale, doing the earn out thing, running product, doing m and a, but getting really deep into crypto. This was the second cycle that I've been around for, and I wanted to get involved. I had done this asking for a while and wanted to go try my hand in a new industry and learn what it was all about.
00:10:17.120 - 00:11:05.542, Speaker A: I started digging around in places where I could get involved, and I learned about Terra. I've gone back and re listened to what drew me into the terra ecosystem, what resonated with me originally, and we can get into that, that later, but learned about Tara. I went to an event. I booked a ticket out, and just kind of showed up at Masari Mainnet and went to a terra party that was happening that night, met do there, stayed in touch. And then there was a point where he just needed help running Terra because it was too much for him to try to be like the face of Tara. Excuse me, running TFL for him to be the face of Tera and also just run all of the backend stuff that needed to be done to scale TfL as an organization. And so, yeah, it was like, I wasn't sure exactly what I was going to do next with my career.
00:11:05.542 - 00:11:16.838, Speaker A: But, I mean, Doe was, like, this incredibly intelligent guy. I get along with him pretty well. And so I thought, yeah, I'll go help him do this. It'll be fun. What's the worst that can happen?
00:11:16.966 - 00:11:29.654, Speaker B: He's charming. I mean, like, I've never met him in person. You probably spent a lot of time with him. But I've seen his interviews, and he's witty and he's. He's extremely intelligent. Justin disagrees. Justin, what do you, what do you feel?
00:11:30.394 - 00:11:45.122, Speaker C: I'm sure he's quite smart. I don't know if I would say charming. I mean, we should pull up some of the memes here, but he always had to, you know, sort of gloat about how he was the richest guy on Twitter and, you know, everyone else was poor. So I don't know if charming is the right word. Maybe charismatic.
00:11:45.218 - 00:11:48.386, Speaker B: Let's say charismatic. That's what I meant to say.
00:11:48.530 - 00:12:17.114, Speaker A: I think. I think charismatic is probably the right way to put it. I mean, like, when you listen to him talk he's incredibly articulate. He can weave together narratives across multiple domains better than anyone I've ever seen. His ability to process and organize and then communicate information is second to none. But then also, he had this Persona that he developed online, which was, I think, arrogant to him. I think he just.
00:12:17.114 - 00:12:51.002, Speaker A: My perspective, working with him on a day to day basis, it always felt like a game, and that Twitter was a place, like, you didn't come to crypto Twitter to have, like, polite conversations. It was. It was what everyone was doing. I think, in some ways, he was maybe just a little bit better at it than most people. And so at a certain point, it was funny at the point when Terra achieved its success, right? Like, it was kind of funny with Luna at a $1 billion market cap, at a $40 billion market cap, it was kind of punching down, I think. Right. And that might be where it just kind of.
00:12:51.002 - 00:12:52.690, Speaker A: It got out of control. Right.
00:12:52.762 - 00:13:09.334, Speaker B: Do you feel like, you know, the higher it goes, the more kind of intense you have to get to keep justifying the valuation? Because, you know, if it's 1 billion, you can kind of be a little bit eccentric, but if it's, like 40 billion, you have to get, like, you have to be a religion, basically.
00:13:09.914 - 00:13:28.814, Speaker A: I mean, I think, yeah, there's a religion aspect, um, to all of this, I think. Because the valuations, none of the valuations match the underlying fundamentals. Right. Except for maybe, you know, bitcoin and ethereum. Right. But so everything. Everything that we're doing here relies on you being able to project very far into the future.
00:13:28.814 - 00:13:53.264, Speaker A: And so narrative matters a lot more than it does even adventure. And even adventure. Like, your chances, like in web two venture, your chances of success are minimal, and you have to be able to see pretty far into the future to see a world where you can get your returns back. It's even more so on crypto. And so narrative matters, personalities matter, I think, you know, I think he developed that. And again, I don't want to speak for Doe. There will be a point when he can come back and speak for himself.
00:13:53.264 - 00:14:31.356, Speaker A: I think he. But he's talked about this before, right? Like, he developed that online Persona to try to get attention for Tara. And I think it was less about, like, trying to, like, crank it up a level as things got bigger and try to get more and more bombastic. I think it was more that once Tara was, like, when Terra was a top 100 token, it was getting attention and getting people to pay attention to him. When Terra was in the top six, again, like, I said it felt punching down in some ways, even though it was the exact same kind of behavior. And I think as terror got larger and his platform grew, I think he probably regrets not modulating that behavior, is.
00:14:31.380 - 00:14:48.234, Speaker B: What I would say makes a lot of sense. I'm curious, taiki and. And thiki, maybe you guys can chime in. I mean, we're all participants as well. During that time, like, how did you. How did you feel about what was going on with Tera?
00:14:48.854 - 00:15:18.666, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, for me personally, like, I bought Luna after, like, the may crash, like, $7, and I'm like, oh, yeah. I mean, it seems like a good play. And then it just, like, kept going higher, and I kind of just got caught up in, like, the whole cult mentality. Um, and, Chris, you're the CEO, right? Like, what was it like? I remember, like, the Luna foundation guard with, like, you know, backing Luna with USD, with bitcoin and whatnot. What was it like? I guess setting that up and I guess planning that. I'm sure that it was, like, a lot of work.
00:15:18.730 - 00:15:50.038, Speaker A: No, you know, I came in after LFG was set up, so I joined TfL about five or six months before the deep. So LFG was almost essentially a done deal. I think they were finalizing it when I came. LFG is an interesting one because there are these accusations that, and I think when people look back on it right now, do just gets looped in with everyone else, lumped together with all of the other frauds, and terror was something altogether different. It was an open source protocol. We never took customer money. We didn't miss appropriate funds.
00:15:50.038 - 00:16:48.630, Speaker A: There's never been any even accusation of that. It was just Terra didn't fit anyone's pattern recognition because things that big in the real world aren't allowed to fail, right? And so you can imagine a world where Silicon Valley bank could have failed just as quickly, but it's not allowed to, right, when the run on that bank happened. And those are, like, pretty interesting parallels, if you think about it. Under collateralized, you know, under collateralized banking systems, one of them was allowed to fail because it's crypto and another one was bailed out. So I forgot where I was going with that with regards to LFG. But the idea with LFG was acknowledging the purpose of LFG was kind of to acknowledge the risk in kind of like, the single source of collateralization that was backing UST and to diversify that and hopefully make it more reliable and sustainable. And I think we all knew, I even at TFL, right? Like, everywhere.
00:16:48.630 - 00:17:42.038, Speaker A: I think everyone in crypto kind of agreed on what the risks associated with this death spiral were for Terra. I remember, I mean, like, I go back and I've listened to the debate Jordy you had with Jose. Like, if you listen to that, it's like two people agreeing on the risks and then talking about why their probabilities of it playing out are assigned differently, right? And so we really thought, and Doe really thought, like I said, I came in at the end of it. We really thought that, like, by the time we raised that LFG fund, that that was going to provide a really much needed level of security to make this thing even more resilient. And I think maybe even in the community, everyone kind of took a sigh of relief, because it's like, okay, now do we not only have, like, the terror machine keeping UsT pegged, we have this LFG fund. It's an acknowledgement that we needed to diversify the collateral to guard against this DPEG risk. But then it ended up not being enough either.
00:17:42.038 - 00:17:52.474, Speaker A: I think ultimately, almost every dollar of it was deployed. An additional money was deployed by TfL as well to defend the peG, but it wasn't.
00:17:53.094 - 00:18:32.782, Speaker C: So no one at the company, you think, had any hunch that this mechanism was fundamentally broken. Because one of the really interesting things, it's easy to tell in hindsight, we found out that Doquan launch, it's alleged the doquan launched basis cash, or one of these other rebasing stablecoins. And for folks that don't know, before Terra made this model popular, there were probably, like dozens, if not hundreds, of projects that did the exact same thing, but just didn't grow to the same scale. And they all collapsed in the exact same way that terra collapsed. So is it really accurate to say no one saw it coming in your mind? You had thought you had sort of like, reached some terminal velocity where terra could literally turn on the money printer and just print money?
00:18:32.958 - 00:18:48.568, Speaker A: No, I don't think that's how I would describe it. I would say everyone was acutely aware of the risks, right? And I. And I think you could see Doe, and there's so much. I've gone back. Cause I've had to do a lot of soul searching through this whole process of being involved in this. Right. I gotta explain it to my kids.
00:18:48.568 - 00:19:14.204, Speaker A: There's so much conversation, and Jordy's conversation was one of them, where, like, all the risks are just, like, clearly acknowledged, and people assign different probabilities to them. So, like, no, I do not think that anyone at TfL thought it was, like, fundamentally broken from the start. I believe, and I still believe that Doe believed in it 100%. I think most people believe. I think Doe was all in it. This was not some kind of elaborate scheme, right? He believed in this.
00:19:14.324 - 00:19:21.812, Speaker B: I mean, clearly, like, given, like, the consequences that he's faced, and, you know, how he was definitely all in. I mean, he definitely believed it. And.
00:19:21.948 - 00:19:45.698, Speaker A: Yeah, so. But. But I mean, like, whether it was fundamentally flawed from the beginning, you know, I think that's a conversation worth having now, right? Like, whether anyone should ever try to do it again. I saw someone today saying I would invest in Ust part two with these different changes, and I was just like, don't. Just don't. But anyway, to answer your question, everyone was kind of aware of the risks. I think by raising the LFG fund, we thought we had mitigated the risks.
00:19:45.698 - 00:20:29.496, Speaker A: And I think to a certain extent, we mitigated them. Just not enough. Although I think when you talk about Ust in relation to the other ones that had failed, Doe was coming at it from a different perspective. And I've gone back and listened to these podcasts where I first learned about Doe and about us, UsT, and he articulated this a lot, right. The reason they failed in the past is because they were primarily just token incentive based or based on an interest rate. So they had this circular logic where you pile money in, money comes in fast because you're being promised a return, and then money exits fast when that return disappears. And the thesis behind UST and why it could be different was that it was going to be useful in the real world, right? It was.
00:20:29.496 - 00:21:25.084, Speaker A: The first killer use case was a real world payments app in Korea. The idea behind how to scale it was to continue to increase the number of useful applications for it, such that there was always steady demand, and it wasn't based on an interest rate. But what happened is anchor in some ways, and I'm not saying anchor, is the reason why I didn't fail. It might have been destined to fail from the beginning anyway. I don't know. But when Anchor launched, that 20% interest rate wasn't that interesting for a stable coin, right? But over time, it became more and more like these speculative rates came down. It became more and more interesting, and as Terra got more popular, more money flowed into UST, and it felt like we weren't able to diversify those more practical use cases for it in relation to the amount of concentration that now became caught up in this interest rate.
00:21:25.244 - 00:22:13.414, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely something that, you know, I regret not spending more and more time before everything fell apart, because I had a lot of the pieces in my head. And it's only when it actually crashed that I put everything aside. And I spent a couple days just really analyzing to understand this mechanism and what happened. And I did realize, unfortunately too late, that it is flawed at the core. And there's no the way it would have been saved before. When I'd done the debate with Jose, this infamous debate, I thought maybe there was a 1015 percent chance, 20% that it would be okay, because I thought the bitcoin reserves might just appreciate and that itself would over collateralize things. But when I dug in deeper, I realized that the hole would just keep growing.
00:22:13.414 - 00:23:01.614, Speaker B: And even if bitcoin saved it for a while and it was over collateralized, at some point, there's just like this design hole in it, and it just sucks out liquidity. And the reason is, whenever Luna gets minted cheaper and then gets sold more expensive, it increases the hole in the balance sheet. And that just keeps happening because this thing will just keep going up, and so the hole will just keep increasing. So I don't think many people, I didn't realize that it was that like, deeply flawed and anchor itself wasn't really the issue. It just sort of made it bigger, more popular. But that wasn't the flaw. I think 20% yield, I mean, people have temporary yield boosts all the time.
00:23:01.614 - 00:23:04.986, Speaker B: We see it with all kinds of protocols.
00:23:05.130 - 00:23:28.734, Speaker A: I think anchor just accelerated the scale. Right. Because so many people came in and then it wasn't being used like it was intentionally designed to be used, which is like a savings account for normal people. It turned into like, if you remember degen box with mim. And people were looping it. So now 20% is whatever, whatever they were able to loop it up to. And then institutions started piling in and.
00:23:28.734 - 00:23:57.940, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like, look, I've thought about this. When, when people talk about like how to design a stable coin, they want it to be. I think of it kind of like, you've heard of like the blockchain scaling dilemma, right? Um, I can't remember like the three components of that, but Vitalik's talked about that. I think about like the, the stablecoin trilemma, that you want it to be stable, you want it to be decentralized, and you want it to be scalable. And UST was an attempt to make it scalable. Right. And I just fundamentally don't believe it can be all three.
00:23:57.940 - 00:24:16.644, Speaker A: I don't think they can be all three. I think, like, you don't. 1st first and foremost, you don't need a decentralized stable coin to pay for coffee. You don't need it for the vast majority of the stable coin use cases. And so it needs to be sturdy, it needs to be resilient. If you want to decentralize stablecoin, it's for handling an edge case.
00:24:17.064 - 00:24:45.206, Speaker C: Just to pick apart that a little more. I don't know. I mean, I'd be curious your thoughts, looking back on it, but I don't know if it's fair to say that UST was actually decentralized, especially with a lot of the chats coming out in court documents and whatnot, where the validators colluded to make determinations about what happened with the chain. Sort of just a fact. I guess you can argue where it sits on the spectrum of decentralization, but from my understanding, that's sort of where we stand.
00:24:45.390 - 00:24:54.062, Speaker A: Yeah, it'd be interesting. I don't know what you mean specifically about validators colluding. I mean, validators making decisions together is just kind of how proof of stake works in cosmos.
00:24:54.118 - 00:25:17.344, Speaker C: Right? But there's telegram chats where I think Do Kwan says to a group of, say, 20 to 30 validators, we're going to push this update at this time for the chain. Everyone has to vote yes or we're going to pause the chain for X reason for X period of time. I guess you could argue in some ways, maybe 20 to 30 validators. It is decentralized because they can sort of choose to not agree with TfL's wishes.
00:25:17.464 - 00:25:23.896, Speaker B: Is it like, whenever Solana was going down, were they just kind of escorting? Just.
00:25:24.080 - 00:25:53.476, Speaker A: Well, yeah. Look, I mean, like, validator coordination to me isn't it's, look, is Cosmos SDK as decentralized as Ethereum? No. So I think decentralization is a scale, is a spectrum, but I don't think validator coordination really falls. I wouldn't say that takes you all the way off of the decentralization scale. It puts you right in the middle of the cosmos decentralization scale is what I would say. So we could have that. There are plenty of arguments.
00:25:53.476 - 00:26:07.164, Speaker A: Is cosmos decentralized enough? We can have those arguments. I'm probably not even the right person to have those, but I wouldn't say that's evidence that UST wasn't decentralized. I mean, it ran. I mean, if it wasn't decentralized, they could have shut it down right when it was all depeing, but it was allowed to fail.
00:26:07.984 - 00:26:10.044, Speaker C: It could have been shut down though, correct?
00:26:10.704 - 00:26:12.400, Speaker A: If the validators chose to.
00:26:12.512 - 00:26:13.048, Speaker C: Right?
00:26:13.176 - 00:26:30.014, Speaker A: And maybe what you're saying is Doe could have gone in there and told them to do it, and because he had that influence and power, it's not decentralized. But he didn't. And so I never saw. I never saw any evidence that Terra was any less decentralized than any other cosmos. Sea cage name is what I would say.
00:26:30.514 - 00:26:43.042, Speaker B: I think it's the smallest point that matters or doesn't matter is the decentralization point. There's such bigger fish to fry in this case, I feel like I would.
00:26:43.058 - 00:27:04.850, Speaker A: Say on the decentralization, I would say one thing is LFG was progressively decentralizing, so the assets that were used to defend the peg weren't fully decentralized yet. And I think that's a valid complaint. You know, it's crypto, right? So you just say progressive decentralization, and everyone says, oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. It happens over time. So I'll lean on that. But to be fair, you know, that could have been more transparent. We have.
00:27:04.850 - 00:27:30.154, Speaker A: Just so everyone knows, we got a third, a very reputable third party consulting firm to go through and audit every single transaction that TfL and LFG made during the PEC defense, because there were accusations that we, like, people were just running away with LFG money. So that's available. If you look at LFG Twitter account, I mean, it's boring, but it's there if anyone wants to go see what happened. So we did at least rectify in terms of providing transparency on that.
00:27:30.494 - 00:28:10.196, Speaker C: I agree with you on that point, but I wanted to touch on one last thing that you mentioned earlier. You were talking about how Ust grew in part because of this narrative that it was used, actually used for payments in Korea. But from my understanding, and I would love for you to clarify here, because I'm not fully educated, from my understanding, the court documents alleged that that was sort of like in hole, mostly a fraud, and that no one was actually using a chai for payments. No one was actually using this thing in a credible way. It was just sort of a narrative that had spun out and sort of grew out of control where, um, it sounds like dode, like, kept exaggerating how much traction there really was when it was all just, you know, wash trading and no one was actually using it.
00:28:10.380 - 00:28:37.092, Speaker A: Yeah. So on that one, maybe, maybe we talk a little bit about the upcoming SEc trial, because I can put that in context of that. Like, I can't. So we have an SEC trial coming up. One of the reasons I had reached out to Jordy was because it was coming up. It was supposed to be, like, a week from Monday, but it got delayed two months, so it's going to be in late March now. And one of the reasons I haven't done a lot of podcasts to explain what happened is because I don't think anyone should actually care what I say about what happens.
00:28:37.092 - 00:28:45.342, Speaker A: The point is, we need to wait for this trial to happen and the evidence will be presented. What I would say is everyone, Doe.
00:28:45.358 - 00:28:48.870, Speaker B: Is expected to be at the trial, right? Like, he's expected to come for that.
00:28:48.982 - 00:29:05.670, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know. I don't have any insight into, like, doe's personal stuff. Like, there was. There was a motion recently that Doe's counsel filed to delay the trial two months in case he was extradited to the US. I don't know that that means he's going to be. I just have no insight in his situation.
00:29:05.670 - 00:29:45.198, Speaker A: Maybe he'll be there, maybe he won't. But terraform labs is mentioned, so, like, we're in this, like, as me leading terraformed labs, I'm still leading, like, the legal effort for that. And so, yeah, I got delayed, unfortunately, because we were looking forward to getting it out. And so, I mean, like, so as regards chai, that's one of the accusations, right? The chai wasn't real. And so I can't litigate that with you right now. But what I would say is, I hope people look at the evidence when it's presented in trial and make their own determination on whether chi was fake or not. Because, yeah, we're not allowed to, like, I'm not allowed to, like, answer these on Twitter or live.
00:29:45.198 - 00:29:54.214, Speaker A: TfL just has to sit there and kind of take whatever accusations come at them, because we're preparing this. This legal trial, which is why we're excited for this SEC case to actually kick off as soon as possible.
00:29:54.334 - 00:30:12.354, Speaker C: And can I ask you, have you had the opportunity to talk to Doe? Or has word come, gotten back on just how he's doing mentally? Cause, like, I don't love what happened with Tara, but I wouldn't wish what's happening to do on my worst enemy right now. Like, I just couldn't imagine going through that. So, I mean, do you have any indication on how he's doing? Does he think he'll win?
00:30:12.774 - 00:30:32.390, Speaker A: Yeah. So I haven't had those kinds of conversations at all. I changed. So when Doe was arrested, like, one thing people don't realize is like, after the DPEG, he went straight back to work relaunching Tara. And the point of relaunching Tara was that we had this vibrant community. We had this ecosystem. You have to put yourself back in the mindset.
00:30:32.390 - 00:30:57.538, Speaker A: At the time, it was still like layer one season. And we were like, we can at least, we might not have the stable coin. We can compete with at least 80%. We can beat 80, 90% of the layer ones out there that are just launching tokens and have no traction. And so we were like, can we capture all this energy? Our builders were devastated. We had a massive ecosystem. Our community, by the way, our community and our ecosystem doesn't think Doe's a villain.
00:30:57.538 - 00:31:29.678, Speaker A: I mean, they've essentially turned Doe into a martyr because the people who were involved with Terra understood the risk. This was never, they lost money. It took some time to mourn and get over it, and theyre back, were still rebuilding. But just to put that in context, he went straight back to work, relaunched the chain. We airdropped the tokens to builders and community members because TfL already had a treasury that we could rebuild with. The whole point was he was going to get back to work and try to salvage this thing for the builders in the community.
00:31:29.786 - 00:32:09.990, Speaker B: I mean, let's like, talk about that period because I remember it quite vividly. I was, you know, already, you know, involved in a lot of telegram chats and stuff back then. I remember, you know, the thing about what happened is it happened so suddenly and Doe had made a lot of people a lot of money and, you know, a lot of it was paper, you know, didn't, didn't actually materialize. But some people did cash out money infamously. You know, CZ says that they had, like, I don't know, $4 billion worth of terror that they never sold. And they just like, let's sit there and eventually evaporate it. But there were people no go and some very large investors that it all happened so suddenly.
00:32:09.990 - 00:32:35.352, Speaker B: I'm sure that they were wanting at least to try to see if something could come out of the ashes and this Luna two thing came out. I know that jump three ac. Like, a lot of the big, big players were in the ecosystem of Luna. So can you tell us kind of like a little bit behind the scenes? Like, were these players kind of trying to see if something could come out or what? Was everybody sort of thinking around it?
00:32:35.448 - 00:33:01.516, Speaker A: Yeah. So I can't give you too much on, like, individual conversations like that, but I think, I think people were supportive initially until, like, just the onslaught of allegations came on. And then I think we and Doe were just too toxic to touch. Whether you believed in Tara and you believed in Doe, it was, and we never took it that personally. Shit. It was toxic to myself. I had trouble coming home and looking at my kids in the eyes.
00:33:01.516 - 00:33:34.434, Speaker A: I was in Singapore when it all went down and was in the war room when we relaunched. So I was ashamed of myself and dealing with that kind of stuff. And so I didn't blame anyone else for also not wanting to associate with us. But now people abandoned pretty quickly, I think, after you had these absolute dishonest grifters like fat man Tara, who came out and just started lobbying. Unfounded allegation after unfounded allegation and we couldn't respond to them. I mean, we would have to. There's a lot going on right inside of TFL.
00:33:34.434 - 00:33:56.754, Speaker A: I mean, some of the allegations seemed credible. So we're a group of people who could all go find jobs somewhere else if we were to stick around. We needed to dig through them ourselves and understand what happened. And so, yeah, I don't know what institutional minds were thinking at that point. I think they were like, this is one of the biggest collapses we've seen and we're just going to stay away from it.
00:33:56.914 - 00:34:18.646, Speaker B: Yeah. The unique thing about the original era was that it wasn't generic. It had this stable at the middle, which no other system had it so ingrained where it was literally part of the code. And so it brought that. And then I guess when you lose that and you try to move into a different direction, it's just another block space, like you said.
00:34:18.710 - 00:34:48.634, Speaker A: Yeah, it's commodity. It's a commodity. It's like, well, it's like I have a barrel of corn, right? I mean, what am I going to do? How am I going to make that interesting for people, especially given everything that we went through? But look, we have a. Beyond just being kind of a generic layer one, we do still have a lot of people who believed in the terror mission and are still like, we have a pretty rabid community. I mean, if you just go to, like, our. It's kind of crazy. Like, I sent you a link, right? Like, go look at, like, Cosmos developer activity.
00:34:48.634 - 00:35:18.826, Speaker A: And it's higher on Terra last week than it was on any other chain in the cosmos ecosystem. Our spaces are full and vibrant. So we still have this community, we're still building TfL has been building this entire time, but TfL is going to have to, like, provide a way out of this. TfL is going to have to, like, show a new vision or a new reason why Terra is going to be. And that's kind of my job, right? Is to see if I can pull that forward. If I can find, like, a thread, a common thread from old terror to new Terra, that's something that I can actually execute and something that's safe.
00:35:18.930 - 00:35:21.442, Speaker C: And what do you think that is? Do you have any idea?
00:35:21.578 - 00:35:56.024, Speaker A: I do, yeah. Like, you know, I spent a lot of time on this because I had a presentation at Cosmoverse last year where it was kind of like my reintroduction to everyone. And I went back and I, like, listened to all the reasons why I got involved with Tara in the first place. I went back and listened to all the Doe interviews before. You know, things turned into, like, pure speculation mode. And I go back to this quote that Doe had in one of his interviews where he was, like, he said something along the lines of, I'm one of those people who. Who believes that Wall street exists to serve Main street and that capital allocated in a vacuum is meaningless.
00:35:56.024 - 00:36:34.110, Speaker A: And, you know, I think what resonated with me about the stable coin, about UST, was just Doe's focus on making it actually useful and productive. I don't really live online. I live in the rural, in suburban California where I spend more time swim meets than I do on Twitter. And so I still am always looking for, how am I going to. I still have to explain why crypto matters to people who don't and will never care what a layer two is. When I was searching for a way to get involved in crypto, it was always about usefulness. And so Chai resonated with me in a meaningful way.
00:36:34.110 - 00:36:53.838, Speaker A: Like, okay, this is crypto being used in the real world. And so I think kind of like those principles, while it didn't work out with the stable coin, I think they still apply to building out a crypto ecosystem. Like, at some point, we've got to stop launching scaling solutions and someone has to build an application that my wife will use.
00:36:54.006 - 00:36:54.406, Speaker C: Right?
00:36:54.470 - 00:37:33.764, Speaker A: And I have experience building those types of applications. I've been in a lot of companies that have had applications that have scaled to millions of hundreds of millions of users. Electronic Arts, MongoDB, Synga, my last company had two or 3 million users. And so I think that's an edge that I can bring. I think there's an opportunity both from the infrastructure that we build into the terra chain and some of the applications that we can show proof of concept with, to show people a different type of crypto experience and to build a type of applications that might actually go mainstream. And so that's where we're going with that. That's the thread that connects old Terra to new Terra.
00:37:33.764 - 00:38:13.624, Speaker A: I think everyone, there's nothing super unique. Everyone's trying to build something that other people will find useful. So that's not some kind of amazing insight. I think if it's successful, the reason it'll be successful is that we have a specific perspective on how to do it and where there are massive market inefficiencies in terms of how people are thinking about building and designing applications and protocols, and then we have a unique perspective to apply to it. We've already gotten started with that. The new station wallet, I think, is the cleanest and the best in the cosmos ecosystem just by incorporating basic stuff that web two applications that you would demand in a web two application.
00:38:14.644 - 00:38:25.384, Speaker B: What do you think about Cosmos ecosystem right now? We're seeing it having this incredible resurgence. Didn't believe that so many cosmos chains could.
00:38:25.544 - 00:39:02.556, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think there are two different things you're seeing, right. One is you're seeing that for specific use cases, having your own app chain makes sense. Right? Dydx. I think what you also see in Cosmos is a lot of people launching their own chains, and they're calling them app chains, and it's like a slight twist. It's like a new chain with a feature which I don't think you can kind of count on. I think if you're a Cosmos app chain, you have to have a perspective and you have to be doing something new, and you probably need to be applying something to your app. Like, it needs to give you some kind of edge by running on your own app chain.
00:39:02.556 - 00:39:44.780, Speaker A: What I would say that I am hyper bullish on is IBC. The amount of work that team has done on IBC to make it a smooth, bridging experience. There are all of these new features that I'm going to bore you to death with. Technical stuff like IBC hooks and packet forwarding middleware, but they just make the bridging experience seamless. With our station wallet, you can initiate multi hop IBC transactions in one click. You can get consolidated multi chain, multi hop transaction histories that actually tell you what the hell you did. If you want to look at it six months later in our enterprise application for Dao management, you can create Daos cross chain with one click.
00:39:44.780 - 00:39:56.808, Speaker A: You don't have to bridge from place to place. You can vote from anywhere. Like, wherever your token is in Cosmos, you can vote on your proposals. You can claim rewards anywhere. The IBC infrastructure is.
00:39:56.936 - 00:40:06.520, Speaker B: Do you think that the Cosmos verse, do they, they try to support each other more than, like, layer twos who are more trying to compete against each other?
00:40:06.592 - 00:40:29.618, Speaker A: There's. I mean, there's Cosmos drama. I mean, I've seen, I haven't been able to keep up with the last couple of years. I've been so focused on, like, saving Tara or trying to rebuild Terra. But I see some of the picking back and forth between optimism and arbitrum. There's some of that in Cosmos as well. But I think there's definitely a little bit more of a grow the pie mindset in Cosmos.
00:40:29.618 - 00:40:56.676, Speaker A: Sometimes there's too much of a grow the pie. At some point, we just got to sit down and compete. I enjoy that competition. You build your software, I'll build my software, and let's go see who likes it better. But, yeah, there's definitely, I would say, a more collaborative approach in cosmos. But I think if you're not looking at, and, I mean, this is me, like, I'm not really pumping my bags. We don't have tokens with these products, and they don't provide any direct utility to Luna.
00:40:56.676 - 00:41:15.206, Speaker A: But, like, if you look at some of the stuff that's being built on top of IBC, you can see a future where it's just the best infrastructure for bridging and for, like, cross chain, um, uh, application, um, interaction. So that, that's my, that's my bowl case for Cosmos. That's how, that's what I'm most excited about.
00:41:15.310 - 00:41:15.526, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:15.550 - 00:41:41.478, Speaker E: I'm also a fan of the cosmos ecosystem. I just think that the most of the teams building there, they're, like, super smart, but they don't really have, it's like a high iq, low eq type of situation where they don't. They don't really know how to, like, talk to, like, regular people. Um, and then, like, it's hard. It's kind of hard to understand, you know, why these teams are building what they're building. But they've been building throughout the bear market, and now they're starting to launch tokens, and that's kind of like, the bulkies, I think.
00:41:41.566 - 00:42:08.342, Speaker A: Look, I mean, I think crypto generally needs more product people. People would like web two product management experience. I think there are a ton of brilliant finance minds. I think there are a ton of brilliant cryptographers and a ton of brilliant engineers. My sense is there aren't a lot of people who have been built products at scale. And by scale, I mean built products that millions of people have used before and iterated. And I think this is one of the reasons why.
00:42:08.342 - 00:42:40.376, Speaker A: I think there's an advantage that I can take advantage of is there's also just incentives get screwed up. Right. I think people confuse protocols with applications and vice versa. And every time I see an application that I kind of like, I see them launch a token, I'm just licking my chops because I know I can out compete because the minute they launch that token, they've got a fake decentralization and I'm going to be able to out execute them. And so we're not doing a ton. Our protocol is a terra blockchain. We're not doing a bunch of defi development ourselves.
00:42:40.376 - 00:42:53.144, Speaker A: But what we are doing is building an application layer on top of those protocols that are building on terra that provide a different level of Ux UI. That's the layer that we want to attach in the stack.
00:42:53.564 - 00:43:07.076, Speaker B: How much do you keep track of some of this drama between the classic and the non classic? Some people are very nostalgic. They want to just repeg the original stuff, burn Milkins.
00:43:07.260 - 00:43:42.376, Speaker A: I track it because I can't go on the Internet without being swarmed. My Twitter mentions are all from that community as well. So, yeah, the background there is that we rebranded the old terror to Terra classic and then the old Luna to Luna classic, which is loan. So just to clarify, if you see Terra or you see Luna right now, you're looking at v two. You're looking at the one that we launched after the Deepak. If you're hearing about loan or Terra classic, or even some crazy scheme to repeg UST, which I hope they're actually successful with. Right.
00:43:42.376 - 00:44:23.744, Speaker A: That would work out well for me personally, but that's the old Terra classic. And what I would say is, like, the way I think about that, that's not necessarily like a lot of old OG terra people that, like, stuck around to, like, save the old chain. That's kind of like a brand new community that sprung up around an opportunity to do something. So, you know, the old community that I know, like, the people that I was in telegram with and discord and were at events with, those are all like, they've all transitioned over to the new chain, but this other one's still out there and we've got like some emotional connection to them and we try to be helpful and we treat them just like we would treat any other cosmos. Layer one. And so I hope they're successful. Our apps will always launch there.
00:44:23.864 - 00:45:00.390, Speaker B: I remember, like, when the price was crashing, there were so many Lunas being printed. I mean, just the zeros. I remember, like, on FTX, just, like, it just kept going and going, and they just kept adding, like, decimals on, like, the price because it was, like, below $1 and, you know, had to add it. And I remember, like, I was trying to stay up and bottom ticket because I thought that even though this thing was clearly spiraling to zero, I was like, you know, screw it, I'll put ten k at, like, the bottom tick. So I. Yeah, I. I waited, and it was, like, trading between, like, 0.0025,
00:45:00.390 - 00:45:19.004, Speaker B: like, 50 and seven five. And it wasn't, like, filling me at, like, two five. So I go to sleep, and unfortunately, like, it never really got that full last tick. It went to that second tick, and then I woke up. It had literally, like 50 x or 100 x. Oh, my God. Which was a bit.
00:45:19.004 - 00:45:30.744, Speaker B: Bit annoying. But like you said, the community that owns, like, those gazillions of Lunas is those people who were, like, just kind of shitcoin trading it, right?
00:45:31.124 - 00:45:38.148, Speaker A: I think so. No, I mean. I mean, it depends. There are factions, right? And I won't get too deep into it. Cause I just. I can't keep up with it. But, like, there are factions.
00:45:38.148 - 00:45:55.376, Speaker A: There are people with good intentions trying. Well, they all probably have good intentions. Some people are just shitcoining it. There are people who are building that chain and implementing new modules on terra classic and expect to build an ecosystem around it. And so we'll see if they'll be successful. Preston. Yeah, there's definitely that point.
00:45:55.376 - 00:46:15.420, Speaker A: I mean, I was sitting there, too. I was sitting in the lobby of the hotel. We had an off site planned for the day of the deep. So when it was happening, we were all there together in this conference room watching it go down. Like you said, they just kept adding zeros in front of it. And I almost, like, expected it, you know, like, on a calculator where they just, like, they just put, like, the exponential thing. They just put, like, the e 16 at some point.
00:46:15.420 - 00:46:19.076, Speaker A: Um, but, yeah, yeah, it spiraled pretty hard, pretty fast.
00:46:19.180 - 00:46:35.944, Speaker C: So as we were discussing, I just pulled it up and really interesting to know. Luna classic lung, or Luke, is actually has a higher both market cap and FTV than the real Luna, the new Luna. Should we read into that at all? Is that because of the meme aspect?
00:46:36.024 - 00:46:55.552, Speaker A: I don't know. Yeah, I don't know how to explain that. I think maybe. Yeah, I mean, maybe that's like a community evaluation of the job I'm doing and trying to resurrect Tara. I don't know, but, yeah, I don't know how to. It's been larger since the moment we relaunched.
00:46:55.688 - 00:47:00.716, Speaker C: So will you be at the SEC trial whenever that happens? Will you be there in New York?
00:47:00.880 - 00:47:09.652, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll definitely be there. It's a big moment for us. So I don't know if I'll be. I don't know if I'll be participating, but I'll be in New York. You know, as a representative of the.
00:47:09.668 - 00:47:20.068, Speaker B: Fo, can you tell us, like, what's at stake in this trial? I mean, obviously, you know, do himself. Has. He has separate trials or is this his trial or how does it exactly work?
00:47:20.156 - 00:47:58.772, Speaker A: Yeah, so I can talk about, like, kind of the key. There are, like, I would say there are kind of, like, four key things at this trial to keep an eye on, first and foremost. Well, let's say there are three, and then one of them, I would break into two different categories. The SEC brought three charges against TfL, and they brought securities violations. So were mirror, Luna, and UST securities. I say you can break one of them up into two because I think you can have a different conversation around Luna and mirror than you would have around Ust being a security. And I think a lot of people in crypto would quibble with any of them being securities, but specifically with stable coins being securities.
00:47:58.772 - 00:48:10.276, Speaker A: So, um, that was ruled on in summary judgment. So that's not going to go to trial. So that's just done. Those were marked as security. So if you saw terraform labs lost on the security, saying that's what that.
00:48:10.300 - 00:48:12.796, Speaker B: Means, what is the penalty for that?
00:48:12.980 - 00:48:14.868, Speaker A: I don't know yet. We'll find out.
00:48:14.956 - 00:48:15.556, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:15.700 - 00:48:30.328, Speaker A: Um, that'll come after the main trial. Um, and then the. So what will be the trial that's coming up in March that. That we hope people pay attention to is the fraud allegation. And there are two. Two allegations of fraud, roughly. Right.
00:48:30.328 - 00:49:10.142, Speaker A: One of them is just misrepresentation of how UsT worked and how terror worked, and the other one is misrepresentation around Chai, whether Chai used the blockchain or not. And so we think there's not merit to both of those fraud allegations. But it's, again, like, there's no. I don't expect anyone to trust me, but there will be a vast amount of evidence presented at the trial, I'm sure. And so people will be able to kind of finally see once and for all whether make up their own mind about if there were misrepresentations or not. But, yeah, that's coming up into March, so we're looking forward to finally having our day in court.
00:49:10.278 - 00:49:44.150, Speaker C: Before we sign off, I do just have to say, like, I think we should all be calling this out. I mean, Chris, I have to say it's someone that's been, like, trying to build in this space and work on a startup and try to go after product market fit. I mean, I have to give a ton of credit to you, for one, staying with the terror community. I mean, I can only imagine how many people were, like, considering leaving, depressed, doubting it, didn't know how to talk to their friends and family. I mean, even just the shame of being in crypto when FTX blew up and not having any affiliation. FTX was absolutely brutal, and I can only imagine what it was like for you. So I have to, like, tip my hat to you.
00:49:44.150 - 00:49:56.396, Speaker C: That's incredibly impressive that you stuck with it. And I also think it's amazing that you're trying to do something important with terror now. Um, so, you know, I have a lot of cred. Give a lot of credit to you for coming on and sharing with us your thoughts and sticking with it.
00:49:56.420 - 00:49:56.604, Speaker B: It's.
00:49:56.644 - 00:49:59.292, Speaker C: It's pretty impressive. So thank you.
00:49:59.348 - 00:50:12.620, Speaker A: Yeah, man, I appreciate that. You know, I mean, it's not just me. It's our community. It's a pretty resilient group. Our team at TFL, we still have 20 people from before the D Pag, which I think not many people would. Would imagine. And they're building fun stuff.
00:50:12.620 - 00:50:25.664, Speaker A: You might not like it, but if you want to check it out, you know, you can always follow our Twitter feed for what's going on. I appreciate you guys having me on. Um, it's good to catch up. I, like I said I wanted to do this since I saw steady lads is the name of the YouTube. So I'm glad we were able to make it happen.
00:50:25.784 - 00:50:34.120, Speaker C: Yeah, hopefully we can have you on in a few years when you guys are a huge success and there's been, like, a huge comeback story and everyone's, you know, excited to talk about Tara again.
00:50:34.272 - 00:50:36.080, Speaker A: Yeah, sounds good. Appreciate it.
00:50:36.232 - 00:50:42.856, Speaker B: Thank you so much for coming, Chris. Good chat, and I think the insights are going to be very valuable for everybody listening.

00:52:46.624 - 00:52:56.010, Speaker B: This is possibly going to win the grand prize, so we'll have the judges decide. But this is incredible. Um, bravo, because we're all in it.
00:52:56.042 - 00:52:57.454, Speaker C: How could we not love it?

00:53:07.634 - 00:53:18.306, Speaker B: It's very cool, Bateman, but that's nothing. What do you think? Nice. But wait, you ain't seen hope?
00:53:18.330 - 00:53:18.802, Speaker A: That's not me.
00:53:18.818 - 00:53:19.654, Speaker B: Is that me?
00:53:21.074 - 00:53:22.146, Speaker A: That's not good.

00:53:32.594 - 00:53:36.374, Speaker A: Wait, that's that thicky middle.
00:53:36.794 - 00:53:39.734, Speaker C: But Vicky, you're on the left and I'm on the right, I think.
00:53:40.994 - 00:53:42.094, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:53:43.074 - 00:53:43.770, Speaker D: Who is that?
00:53:43.802 - 00:53:44.434, Speaker E: What do you think?
00:53:44.514 - 00:53:48.352, Speaker A: Is that me? Oh.

00:53:53.424 - 00:54:01.904, Speaker B: Not the best AI ever, but, you know, I would say the effort is good enough that it's not going to win the total prize, but it's maybe good enough to crack the top ten.
00:54:01.944 - 00:54:03.712, Speaker D: So what is the grand prize?
00:54:03.848 - 00:54:06.352, Speaker B: Grand prize is like six meth. So it's like.
00:54:06.368 - 00:54:07.088, Speaker A: Are you serious?

00:54:49.494 - 00:54:51.206, Speaker D: Well, I think that was Irene. That's me.
00:54:51.310 - 00:54:55.234, Speaker C: There we go. Just so pretty chicky.
00:54:55.974 - 00:55:03.154, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good one. Well, we have. We have a few that are just art. Very well. Very well designed.
00:55:03.934 - 00:55:05.514, Speaker D: This is a rich contest.
00:55:05.944 - 00:55:06.884, Speaker B: It is.
00:55:07.344 - 00:55:08.564, Speaker E: Next one is this.
00:55:10.904 - 00:55:11.684, Speaker B: Yes.
00:55:12.704 - 00:55:13.884, Speaker A: I love this guy.
00:55:14.304 - 00:55:21.644, Speaker B: He's such a good artist as well. Very solid. What are the top ten?
00:55:23.064 - 00:55:25.536, Speaker C: This might be my favorite due to simplicity.
00:55:25.720 - 00:55:33.878, Speaker B: Yeah, very good one. We have another simple one right after. Hilarious. It's just the look on unjustin's face.
00:55:34.016 - 00:55:35.066, Speaker D: I look like a predator.
00:55:35.130 - 00:55:38.374, Speaker C: There we go. We gotta go to the next one, Tyke. We gotta move this one along.
00:55:39.074 - 00:55:43.814, Speaker D: I think we gotta give it to the, uh, that video that. The key and P O one.
00:55:44.474 - 00:55:46.538, Speaker B: Yeah, I really can feel one.
00:55:46.626 - 00:55:48.914, Speaker D: The key and P O one. Or is like, dapping everyone up.
00:55:48.994 - 00:55:49.614, Speaker A: The.
00:55:49.914 - 00:56:10.884, Speaker B: The black president one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I have a feeling that that is very likely to win the top prize. So we'll. We'll have a quick voting from the. From the judges, but let's put it up one more time and let's put full screen and let's end the episode with this and we'll see you guys next week.

00:56:30.610 - 00:56:31.642, Speaker A: Emily George.
00:56:31.778 - 00:56:33.770, Speaker B: No, but it's one of the memes.
00:56:33.962 - 00:56:35.214, Speaker A: Daryl Stokes.
