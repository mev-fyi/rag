00:00:18.640 - 00:00:31.098, Speaker A: Alright, guys, it's been an eventful week. We'll have a lot to get into. Taiki's half, half dead, but he's here as well.
00:00:31.234 - 00:00:38.550, Speaker B: I saw all the meme coin rugs and I've been dealing with a severe headache recently, so apologies if I'm less talkative.
00:00:40.410 - 00:01:03.552, Speaker A: We have a guest. We'll be learning about bitcoin from someone. I think it's our first bitcoin. I don't want to say Maxi because he seems very open minded, but bitcoin focused for sure. So Paul Stork is going to be with us. We'll talk meme coins, we'll talk markets, we'll talk bitcoin and a lot of interesting stuff. So let's hit the intro.
00:01:03.552 - 00:02:07.610, Speaker A: Let's get going, guys. Episode 55 it's been quite a week. We have hopefully a continued recovery happening, but we'll kick off maybe with what happened Monday morning. It was a bloodbath across entire macro space, not just our little land of crypto. But I saw some of the numbers in like Nikkei and some of the asian indexes that they were just like having -14% days, which is pretty insane. Like that's like, that's a Solana shitcoin kind of daily volatility.
00:02:07.950 - 00:02:08.730, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:09.470 - 00:02:13.010, Speaker C: Can you tell us what happened, Jordy? What's this yen trade everyone was talking about?
00:02:13.390 - 00:03:00.906, Speaker A: Yeah, so basically the, the bank of Japan has been trying to get out of their insanely negative rates that they've been doing all this yield curve control and they raised to like, I think 25 bps, which is not a lot, but it's enough to get some of this like free money that was literally just borrowing for free back into Japan. And a lot of it was in things like the Nasdaq. Lo and behold, Nasdaq collapses and suddenly like the yen goes up. And it was more than expected. It seems like it rattled them so much that they came out the next day and put out statements that we're going to slow down, don't worry, we're not going to just keep raising like this. We're watching the markets. The Fed has not necessarily flinched.
00:03:00.906 - 00:03:43.990, Speaker A: I think there is no emergency rate cut priced in right now and they're still looking at maybe just doing 25 bps in September. This is not like something that's immediately being fixed. There might be a continued rotation out, but it feels to me that that was one excuse. The main thing is just that markets have been overvalued. We've seen a lot of the AI companies in the last few weeks before this even happened, start to have questions asked once earnings came out. You're spending all this money to invest, but there's no actual revenue. So hopefully it's just a healthy correction.
00:03:43.990 - 00:03:56.870, Speaker A: But I would say, unfortunately, crypto took a rather large hit, and a lot of our brethren had positions liquidated.
00:03:58.290 - 00:04:25.460, Speaker B: Yeah, lots of people got hit pretty hard. So I'm curious, Jordi, we've been seeing rumors of, I guess, jump just selling a bunch of eth, like, I guess, unstaking their stake deed, sending it to exchanges. What do you think is happening there? Of course, it's all speculation. We don't really know. But do you buy the rumor that they're getting probed by the CFTC and they're exiting the industry? What's your take on that entire situation?
00:04:26.640 - 00:04:59.534, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'm very familiar with jump as a broad company. I've been competing against them for my entire trading career. They're in the same markets all the time, and I know a lot of people that work there, so I understand how they operate. But it did take me by surprise that they suddenly sold off all the ETH. I think that they had recovered from the wormhole hack. There's all this 300 million that started getting sold off, and I think is now being eradicated into the market. I wasn't sure why it was happening.
00:04:59.534 - 00:05:51.688, Speaker A: I was suspecting that maybe it was related to some settlement with the investigation going on as to their UsT, Luna repegging and all that. The more we find out, it doesn't look like they are necessarily exiting crypto completely. It's a very lucrative trading business. So even if they get out of some of this, you know, project, you know, vc type of stuff, they're still going to be dominating the markets as they have been with their infrastructure advantage. So I can't imagine them switching that off. It definitely is a, you know, seven figure a day business for them. But for whatever reason, they, they decided this was the time to sell an enormous amount of eth.
00:05:51.688 - 00:06:20.774, Speaker A: We don't know what they did on bitcoin. Side. There was a lot of weakness on bitcoin before the macro mess started. And I have to say, like, I feel quite humbled, because I did feel like after the Trump speech, I was expecting that that was like, such a momentous occasion. And at the time, equity markets were at all time highs. This was before they even flinched. I thought we were going to have a little bit of a breakout, and I couldn't put my finger on it.
00:06:20.774 - 00:06:54.030, Speaker A: It just felt like there was somebody selling for no reason related to macro? And this is the thing with trading, you can get all the normal parameters. What's macro doing? What are stocks doing? What's the regulation doing? Everything looked positive and somehow we were still hitting this resistance and selling off. And yeah, we were questioning last week on our show whether it was the government dumping on us. And it does feel like was selling just chose that moment. Maybe it was jump.
00:06:54.450 - 00:06:59.058, Speaker C: Who do we blame this for? Jump. Safe to say there was a little.
00:06:59.114 - 00:07:26.206, Speaker A: Video circulating with Knav, who is no longer the president, but he was the ex president. Maybe we can put a few seconds of this video up. Terra Luna was an algorithmic stablecoin. We knew this thing didn't fucking work, but the young asian kid had everyone fooled. Now, as the exclusive market makers for USBT, we controlled the peg. And. Look, I know you're not following what I'm saying anyway, right? That's okay.
00:07:26.206 - 00:07:36.610, Speaker A: That doesn't matter. The real question was this, was all this legal? Absolutely fucking not. But we were making more money than we knew what to do with.
00:07:37.870 - 00:07:38.550, Speaker C: There you go.
00:07:38.590 - 00:07:39.606, Speaker D: It's pretty good.
00:07:39.798 - 00:07:57.966, Speaker A: Kudos. Kudos to whoever put that together. Yeah, I mean, you know, it's. It's been turbulent. Obviously, we've had a little bit of a recovery, so the. The collapse hasn't, like, eradicated everything. Bitcoin crossed back over 60 somehow after crossing below 50.
00:07:57.966 - 00:08:16.182, Speaker A: So this has been a wild, like, few days. We have Iggy Azalea, who is quite new to crypto, just now realizing how insane we are in this space. She says, I don't think I ever expected crypto to be this insane. Literally, one day it's to the moon, and then the next day it's all over. And you'll make up your minds.
00:08:16.326 - 00:08:18.290, Speaker B: Yeah, she's one of us.
00:08:19.310 - 00:09:11.022, Speaker A: She's learning. She's learning. But, yeah, I mean, I would say Eth has hit an all time low of sentiment. We've been saying that for months, but I've never seen what I saw this weekend. Obviously, it underperformed Solana and bitcoin, and we had Kain, one of the main builders in Defi of Synthetix. Just say fuck it, and just publicly go after Vitalik for not supporting Defi enough and maybe being a bit in the clouds. I don't know if we can find the tweet, but the good news is for all etheads like Justin, I don't know if he's still part of the club, but this tweet by Kane where he says if the only thing propping up your chain for the last five years is Defi and the best you can muster is begrudgingly tolerate it.
00:09:11.022 - 00:09:20.490, Speaker A: You're anti defi. This actually marked the bottom like of ETh. We've kind of rallied substantially since then.
00:09:21.870 - 00:09:24.770, Speaker C: I don't know about substantially. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
00:09:26.070 - 00:09:27.982, Speaker A: Let's bring up Coingecko and see where we are.
00:09:28.006 - 00:09:41.808, Speaker B: I haven't checked for background for reviewers. I think Vitalik, he only supports like, maker Uniswap and he doesn't really like anything else, which is kind of weird, right? But who knows? Maybe he's living in his own world.
00:09:41.984 - 00:10:04.140, Speaker C: Well, I've also mentioned this. I've heard him speak just like Kane, and he has this sort of perspective of like, I've already made it, and now that I've made it, and I don't actually think he thinks this, but he comes across as like, I've made it. And now that I've made it, let's just focus on making ethereum, like a public good for all. And let's focus on charity work and not actually like building use cases that the people are interested in.
00:10:04.880 - 00:10:24.024, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, just to quickly go here, I mean, you know, bitcoin only down 5% on the 7th day, obviously, you know, it was going down slowly before that, as we, as we said. But eth down 15, Solana also down like around five. So still the underperformer, even though it's made a little bit of a bounce back.
00:10:24.152 - 00:10:26.060, Speaker B: So much pain. So much pain.
00:10:26.610 - 00:10:43.714, Speaker A: Yeah, and some of the shitcoins. I mean, Tron. Tron is up. XRP had some good settlement and ton got listed on binance. So some things are doing all right. But yeah, let's find out a little bit, like, you know, why bitcoin is so resilient. We have a guest that is deep in that land.
00:10:43.714 - 00:10:49.510, Speaker A: So Paul Stork is here, CEO of L2 labs. Hello, Paul.
00:10:50.210 - 00:10:53.372, Speaker D: Hello. Hey, guys, thanks for having me.
00:10:53.556 - 00:10:57.600, Speaker A: Absolutely. Can you tell us, like, what is L2 labs? And you know what?
00:10:57.980 - 00:11:45.456, Speaker D: Well, you know, I started this company because everyone in bitcoin has just given up on the goal of making bitcoin something that 8 billion people would use and that would change the world. And instead, people are settling for something very, very, very small, which is just something that there's only 21 million units of and there's no reason for it because we can very, very easily obtain all these other things. It's just a stone's throw away. So that's why I started the company. And it's based around this idea of the side chain or the drive chain, more precisely. And that allows you to send bitcoin to other pieces of software and back. And those pieces of software, they have their own blockchain.
00:11:45.456 - 00:11:59.420, Speaker D: They have their own block size limit. They have their own code. They have their own features. So you can. Do we have like a clone of zcash. We have, you know, you get planetary scale immediately with. With side chains because you can just have as many as you like.
00:11:59.420 - 00:12:25.232, Speaker D: And the issues of the full nodes costing a lot of money to run in the large block universe, that doesn't really apply in the sidechain world because you can just kill the side chains off at any time and just restart them. So it's like a kind of like a caching layer in a way, for. For bitcoin. It's kind of a lot of. In many ways, it's like what people thought the lightning network would be, but people did not think about the lightning network.
00:12:25.336 - 00:12:35.720, Speaker A: I think for the first time in the last months, I feel like even the lightning network believers are kind of capitulating. Like, it seems that that's a very long time.
00:12:35.880 - 00:13:03.910, Speaker D: Yeah, but it's finally happening. It's happening very slowly. I mean, there was a two. You could go two tab conferences ago, I think I. Which would be nearly three years ago since these are in these, like, in late September, October, Matt Corallo gave a talk called lightning is broken af. And. And then there was a subtitle that was like, and maybe we could fix it or whatever, but that.
00:13:03.910 - 00:13:30.572, Speaker D: But that part. That half of the presentation was not as persuasive as the first half. First it's broken because lightning is broken, and then everyone just kind of keeps going through the motions. You know, everyone just keeps going through the motions. And you just always have these people who are like. So all these people who are just saying, like, okay, they come to bit devs or something, and then here's flood and loot. There's some attack, and then there's how to mitigate it.
00:13:30.572 - 00:13:34.252, Speaker D: The whole thing is just a bunch of academic, you know, nonsense.
00:13:34.276 - 00:13:40.148, Speaker A: How much. How much, like, do you get the bitcoin community these days? You go to the conference, you listen to, like, the.
00:13:40.244 - 00:13:41.564, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, the bitcoin.
00:13:41.692 - 00:13:42.900, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm.
00:13:42.940 - 00:13:55.500, Speaker D: Well, I thought you asked how much. I'm very in the bitcoin community, and I. I go to all the conferences and I. I talked to all the people. So if you want to know where the bodies are buried. Sorry.
00:13:55.580 - 00:14:08.530, Speaker A: Yeah, it's sentiment, like, very high. Like, you know, at the moment with, with, I would say, like the. Yeah, like the political acceptance and, you know, price doing relatively pretty. Pretty. Okay.
00:14:08.870 - 00:14:43.320, Speaker D: Well, I think bitcoin unfortunately, has evolved a culture that is not. The self criticism has diminished enormously from where it was like back in 2011, 2012. It was very strong, but now everyone's just supposed to get on board and, yeah, engineer the Trump bump or this other stupid crap that people talk about. So. So, yeah, I do think that everyone. Yeah, you're not supposed to like, criticize lightning too much because that's stabbing bitcoin in the back. If you say something like lightning is going to fuck up bitcoin, it's.
00:14:43.320 - 00:15:02.840, Speaker D: These people are vampirically leeching the life out of bitcoin. And if we want bitcoin to succeed, we have to get rid of this idea. If you say something like that, you won't be as popular as if you're just like some Jack Mahlers and you just go up on stage and you just say, everyone will be. Every cv's will have lightning in eight months, which he said like three years ago or something. Something to that effect.
00:15:03.300 - 00:15:07.412, Speaker A: Justin, do you feel like no one cares? Yeah.
00:15:07.556 - 00:15:15.404, Speaker D: Macro does the talk. Bitcoin is broken and just no one cares. So the whole thing is unfortunately like just this weird cultural disaster. I think.
00:15:15.452 - 00:15:46.430, Speaker A: I feel like it could be worse than Ethereum because there's this concept of Ethereum alignment and projects and chains are either Ethereum aligned and to what extent, it's like you get a report card from the Ethereum foundation and they say like, oh, you're not using the daily availability layer, you're using external DA. So you're only like a 6.3 out of ten. We're not gonna. And there's this kind of politics and it does feel like people are getting a little bit fed up with that part. Do you have any sense of this, Justin?
00:15:46.920 - 00:16:49.764, Speaker C: It does seem like that's sort of fading away, I think, to an extent, for like the last, excluding the last three months when things have sort of changes before that, like the previous three, four years, you had this bankless premium, I think, and this is oversimplifying a little bit, but like, if bankless enjoyed your project and talked about it, there's like a premium and crypto Twitter and just in the space in general of acceptance of this project, this project being in that good. Now, I think with ethereum sort of faltering, I think obviously it's a little depressing seeing eth btc, eth, USD, sol, eth, eth doing so poorly across all three dimensions. But I think now is a time where, like, you can be critical of ETh again, just like Paul, you're saying, like, it's good to be critical of bitcoin. So I think that that tide is shifting as we go through this challenging period that I think bitcoin really probably faced in, what, 2022, 2021 to some extent, when everything was outperforming it and people were questioning the value of it. Now bitcoin's having this renaissance of the values there. It makes sense. But we have that question again, where if it makes sense with Ethereum.
00:16:49.764 - 00:17:00.160, Speaker C: And so I think, like, to your, to the extent that this could be good for Ethereum with, like, people taking a step back and actually seeing, like, how can we make sure we're building the best chain possible for what we want to achieve?
00:17:00.620 - 00:17:31.903, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Paul was telling us backstage about this sense of complacency and we were telling him, like, Ethereum has definitely had that same thing. And, you know, I run like, a trading firm, and there's where you just, the algo is just make money for months. You don't, you know, there's just auto, autopilot, and you get complacent. Things change, the market changes. And then you start asking all the questions like, what's going wrong? What do we need to. And it's healthy because you can make the changes. Let's, let's bring up this comment here.
00:17:31.903 - 00:17:38.860, Speaker A: Some people asking about thoughts on Zcash. And you know, what's so funny?
00:17:40.960 - 00:17:45.940, Speaker C: How is that relevant to, I mean, it's Zcash. Is that still relevant?
00:17:47.360 - 00:17:50.112, Speaker A: Well, I mean, Paul, you said, like.
00:17:50.136 - 00:18:07.924, Speaker D: There'S like a mention of zcash privacy. Yeah. So, like, a side chain is good if it has an actual feature that people like. So this is like the gwart. Like, it's. So I feel to give, it's giving someone too much credit to say, this is like the Gord critique that we have to care about the user.
00:18:07.972 - 00:18:11.400, Speaker C: We love Gord. We've had Gordon, this should be like.
00:18:11.700 - 00:18:51.310, Speaker D: Basic 101 thing that everyone takes for granted, but instead, this is the joke is that he just keeps writing these tweets about there are no users, or, oh, I was going to try, I was going to try to improve the software for my users, but then I remembered I don't have any users or stuff like that, like that type of joke. So, I mean, zcash is like, doesn't have, they don't have users, but it's not because the feature is bad. The code. The code actually is good, but they don't have users because of just network effect. They have huge dev tax. It's sinking the market price of the coin. So it's like low on coin market cap.
00:18:51.310 - 00:18:53.090, Speaker D: So this stigmatizes the coin.
00:18:53.590 - 00:19:19.464, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Justin laughing at me. But there's a reason why I bring up the zcash as a kind of entree into this topic, which is, you know, we often talk about monetary premium and things like zcash don't really have a, like, they're meant to be money, right? Like, that's kind of their intention. Maybe it's privacy money, but it's meant to be a form of currency. And yeah, you know, that's a sad.
00:19:19.512 - 00:19:23.430, Speaker D: Chart when in a world where bitcoin is like thousand.
00:19:25.930 - 00:20:00.730, Speaker A: Right. But it's kind of, I think you hit the nail on the head when you said network effect. And so my thoughts on zcash are it doesn't have anywhere near the network effect. So how can it be successful even if the tech is a little bit preferential? You need to reach such a high level, and I've tweeted about this for years, that, like, the. The benchmark for monetary premium, so to call it, is so high that it's not just a matter of, like, you know, the tech is okay. You. You really need, like, you know, millions, hopefully, like you said, billions of people to participate, be distributed to have, like, a fairness factor where.
00:20:00.730 - 00:20:16.840, Speaker A: Why are all the coins where they are okay, like, there's a reason. If zcash suddenly, like, you know, goes to the price of bitcoin and you have Barry Silbert back from the. Back from the grave suddenly being our overlord because he. Because he owns all of it, that's not going to work out much.
00:20:18.260 - 00:20:38.540, Speaker D: Well, I want to stress something about the side chain point of view. It's something of a paradox, because the side chain point of view says, in one sense, we must copy all of the tech from everyone else. We want all the tech. So you have bitcoin, l one, but then you have a z cash, l two. Or you have Monero, l two. Or you have eth. L two.
00:20:38.540 - 00:21:06.014, Speaker D: Or you have Solana, l two. We don't want anyone to be turned away. But the paradox is that you also don't care about the tech. Because I believe in this world where there all be side chains in the future, once that happens, everyone will have equal tech. So there's no point in, like, doing the R and D on the tech today, because you will never monetize. You can't monopolize it. The only thing that you.
00:21:06.014 - 00:21:46.696, Speaker D: That is, the only thing that's inimitable, the only thing that you cannot imitate is the network effect. And this is why bitcoin, again, the whole thing is very nuanced because everything kind of contains its opposite, in a way. But it's like bitcoin has this strong network effect, which gives it all this strength. But that also means that it can onboard all these useless parasites, and it can just like, kind of like, be too slow to innovate. There's a Mark Andreessen from a 16 z. He always said this. He has this huge disagreement with Peter Thiel about Peter Thiel's pro monopoly, and Mark Andreessen is anti monopoly.
00:21:46.696 - 00:22:01.528, Speaker D: And I really think Mark is right because he says the motto of every monopoly is, we don't care because we don't have to. So you're in this strong position. You just think, well, I don't need to innovate. I don't need to put wheels on the, you know, on the.
00:22:01.584 - 00:22:25.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, now that. Now that you talk about the innovation. So, you know, in my land of my other hat, like the VC hat, we're seeing a lot of bitcoin, l two s, obviously, as you know, in the last year, there's botanics and bit layer and all kinds of l two s build on bitcoin. Are these because l two s are different than side chains? You know, they're actually trying to. I guess, like.
00:22:25.480 - 00:22:42.860, Speaker D: Yes, well, my view is the side chain is an l two is in the category of l two. This is an unfortunate thing where people really trip over the. The definitions of things. I think it's maybe not as important as people might think, the whole definition. I mean, let's just talk about the thing. Each. We could talk about each individual idea or a concept.
00:22:42.860 - 00:22:44.076, Speaker D: I don't know if that will help or not.
00:22:44.108 - 00:22:53.220, Speaker A: But, yeah, I mean, we've had things that are, you know, like Merlin, where it feels like it's more of like a TVL game and.
00:22:53.340 - 00:23:11.332, Speaker D: And TVL. Yeah, so that. So, yeah, this is a new thing. Like, I had honestly never really. People did not use the TVL phrase, like, frequently. It wasn't big. I'd, like, heard of it, but until very recently.
00:23:11.332 - 00:23:14.240, Speaker D: Right. I don't know. Like, this is like the new.
00:23:14.540 - 00:23:19.638, Speaker A: It's a defi thing. It started like, you know, so maybe.
00:23:19.654 - 00:23:30.198, Speaker D: It'S a bitcoin experience, because, like, in bitcoin world. We just assume, like, all that eth stuff will either just be copied into BTC or is like a scam. And of course, 99% of everything in the industry is a scam.
00:23:30.374 - 00:23:56.102, Speaker C: Even 99% is a scam. But can I just ask a qualifying question? It is harder to develop applications on bitcoin. We know that ethereum, like and other chains, not just Ethereum, now have a flourishing ecosystem where it's easier to develop. Why will people, in your view, migrate? All of this tech that they've spent building in an environment that's friendly to building, move that over to bitcoin, where it's really hard to do. And bitcoin is very behind.
00:23:56.246 - 00:24:08.582, Speaker D: The builders will not, and they will fight it tooth and nail, in fact. But this is a marxist theory that we should do whatever the workers want. And it's like the consumer will prefer, the consumer will look at the same thing.
00:24:08.606 - 00:24:10.894, Speaker C: Why will the consumer prefer bitcoin?
00:24:11.062 - 00:24:24.698, Speaker D: You have bitcoin versus eth, and bitcoin will be. It has the network effect and it has whatever. Donald Trump and Michael Sailor, their savior. And if you buy bitcoin, you get sucked. Michael sailors dick or whatever. So that will be enough to just get everyone.
00:24:24.794 - 00:24:26.114, Speaker C: So it's a price thing then.
00:24:26.202 - 00:24:52.262, Speaker D: Like, if a theory is not a completely. Again, it's a difficult thing. It's all about what is inimitable. So there's only one person can be the number one slot, and then you roughly attract people in proportion to how big you already are. It's like gravity. So you have like a black hole, it's sucking in more planets, it's becoming stronger, and it's just, this is just network effect reality. Now, I want to stress that the network effect is not.
00:24:52.262 - 00:25:05.518, Speaker D: It doesn't. It's not like a one shot ko or something. You know, it's not like the golden gun from, you know, a Goldeneye 64. It's not like you get the network effect and then you just win.
00:25:05.614 - 00:25:11.822, Speaker A: Yeah, because you were telling us before that you do think there's going to be one winner, but you're not even 100% sure it's bitcoin. Like, if they get.
00:25:11.846 - 00:25:14.050, Speaker D: I'm definitely not 100% sure. Yeah.
00:25:15.670 - 00:25:26.166, Speaker A: Let's do a little, like, thought experiment. What if it's not bitcoin and it is something else? Is it going to be something? Is it going to be aetherium? Or is it going to be like something that hasn't existed?
00:25:26.198 - 00:26:25.170, Speaker D: I think it'll be something new that it is, that it's like sort of calculated to appeal to not only the, the existing network effect people, but also just new users, because there's got to be a rotation when you, when you, you have your investing hat. So you think, okay, I'll buy this for $10, but then the price will go to $100, and then the price will go to $1,000. There eventually will reach a point where the market price cannot increase anymore. And the only way to justify holding the coin is that it does become money for the, or has some kind of convenience yield, or it does something. The coin has to be doing something. So it does have to eventually translate from, basically, equity into revenue, so to speak. I mean, this is speaking very loosely here, but the market price is sort of like the stock price, and then this is, again, kind of loose.
00:26:25.170 - 00:26:31.570, Speaker D: So, but it's like the transaction fees paid in the block that is kind of like the sales or the revenue or something.
00:26:31.970 - 00:26:43.950, Speaker A: So when you see, when you see attempts like Z cash, you know, to make alternative, or Monero or, you know, you could even say, Luna, this type of thing.
00:26:44.490 - 00:26:45.154, Speaker D: Yes.
00:26:45.282 - 00:27:02.966, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, I have a similar mental construct as you in that I see them as, you know, they're like rockets trying to escape the atmosphere, and they go up, but, like, if they don't actually escape the gravitational pull, like, they just come back down and crashed. But maybe, maybe one day, one of them will, if it's designed very well.
00:27:03.078 - 00:27:44.390, Speaker D: Right. I think the rocket is a great metaphor because there's so many, at least in the pre Elon. Pre, the Elon revolution, you know, praise Elon. But there was, like, many stages, and you would have to, like, do everything in the exact right order and, like, separate and do all this stuff, and you had to have, like, the life support working, you know, so it's, like, very complicated project, and it also crucially depended on timing. Like, you. You accelerate the. The rocket at the right speed, and you will make it out, but if you go too fast or too slow, the friction, you either burn up or you'll run out of fuel before you get far enough away, or you'll so, or you'll.
00:27:44.390 - 00:27:55.010, Speaker D: The pressure will not be right, and the chamber will explode. So you have to thread a needle through a high, very high dimensional space. I think that's exactly the same.
00:27:55.950 - 00:27:57.982, Speaker C: And can you, Paul?
00:27:58.086 - 00:28:24.556, Speaker D: Sure, sure. But let me just say something about Zcash, which is, it's debatable whether or not ZC, how committed they really are. A lot of people just, they want to work on their little tech baby, you know, and they think, oh, I'll get someone to fund this. And then a lot of things in the space. Many of these l two s, many of the altcoins, there's just a. People are not actually focused on building something that a lot of people use and enjoy. They actually are not.
00:28:24.556 - 00:28:46.398, Speaker D: It's the tech. People want to work on their own tech that they, like. A lot of people are doing money laundering, and the altcoin is just a vehicle for that. And. Or they just, you know, they're just. It's not even in the case of Zcash, it could just be with litecoin and stuff. People just want to move their coins around a lot, shuffle the coins around.
00:28:46.398 - 00:29:24.122, Speaker D: They want to have a lot of different stuff that I do think a lot of people say, like, there used to be, like, Ricardo Spagny, creator of Monero. Not quite the creator, but, you know, the lead guy, lead spokesperson. He used to say, like, you should put dollar 500 into every shitcoin. And this is partly what you should do. If you think one of them will win and they will become this huge asset that is worth, you know, if there were 21 million units, it would be 20, $30 million per coin. But you don't know which one. Well, yeah, then you should be throwing $500 into anything.
00:29:24.146 - 00:29:27.146, Speaker A: What do you think about, like, all these, like, runes and Justin had a.
00:29:27.178 - 00:29:30.650, Speaker D: He had a thing that he was gonna say first. Right. We have to go in the right order.
00:29:30.810 - 00:30:00.056, Speaker C: Thank you, Paul, our new moderator. You know, you mentioned Peter Thiel, so I wanted to circle back to it. Peter Thiel has this theory, like, to supplant the existing competitor that has already a foothold in the market, you have to build something ten x better. So, like, an example would be, like, uber ten x better than taxis. So everyone's going to switch to it. You talk. You talked before, and you were sort of just talking about now people migrating over to bitcoin from Ethereum land or existing smart contract land, but I just don't see that happening.
00:30:00.056 - 00:30:05.000, Speaker C: Right. Like, stable coins on bitcoin are not going to be ten x better. An amm on bitcoin is not going to be ten X better.
00:30:05.040 - 00:30:31.978, Speaker D: Like, where you don't have these around. I kind of throw it around back at you and say, I don't think the Ethereum. I don't think the Ethereum and most of these, the early. Right now, it's still kind of early days, actually, because it's not a function of time. It's a function of, like, users versus employees. So, like, if we were going to build something like an amusement park, we haven't let the normal people in. We're still, like, building the rides and testing them, like on ourselves.
00:30:31.978 - 00:30:57.612, Speaker D: It's like real mechanical engineers are riding the rides to make sure that they don't, like, explode or whatever, whatever the metaphor is. But we haven't let the laypeople still don't understand what the point of this technology is. And we don't have a lot of normal users, if that makes sense. I'm trying to say, like grandma or whatever, like lay person. And people still don't quite get it. Like, they don't quite. Although now I think I.
00:30:57.612 - 00:31:20.920, Speaker D: People are getting closer. One of the things that's closer is, like the web3 login and. But like, transactions use case has been suppressed. The Defi use case is very hard for people to understand because to a regular person, it really looks as though it's just a bunch of useless stuff that's all being rearranged. You know, it's like a casino where you. It's either. It is just a casino, or it's a casino with chips that you.
00:31:20.920 - 00:31:33.962, Speaker D: You can't cash out. Or, like, people don't. They don't understand what the social function this is. They don't. They don't agree that it's a bank, like bitcoin, saying, we're going to replace the banks with something better. But people don't agree with that.
00:31:34.026 - 00:32:04.354, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, whenever I listen to, like, bitcoin podcasts and dive into that world, and I have dive in pretty deep, it does feel like, you know, there's been this ongoing purity test of, you know, nothing else matters. It's just the asset, and we're trying to replace fiat currency. That's it. Versus. You seem more open minded, cap. And even Michael Sailor, you know, since he's so invested in minors and everything else, he's been happy with some of the recent renaissance of ordinals and runes.
00:32:04.402 - 00:32:32.010, Speaker D: And staler is truthfully happy with the ordinals. I think he did a quick calculation politically in his head, and he was like, this has already happened. It has some people who really like it, some people who really hate it, but they are on the losing side. So I think that he. I don't think that he would get out of. I don't think he got out of bed, like, three years ago and said, oh, you know, what bitcoin really needs is more tokens on BTC.
00:32:32.430 - 00:32:32.958, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:33.054 - 00:33:04.282, Speaker D: I don't think that that's how he thinks at all. But I want to just finish what I was saying to Justin, which is we haven't. No one has opened the door. There's like, bitcoin park, bitcoin theme park, and ethereum theme park. And no one has really opened the doors yet, in my opinion. It's still early. People have yet to actually deploy something that I think is a consumer facing app, with the exception of stuff like ordinals and runes and ERC 20 and stuff like where people just like to just have meme coins.
00:33:04.282 - 00:33:30.736, Speaker D: Meme coin is like the first ride. And so I actually think that the question is flipped around where eventually the doors will be open for bitcoin and for Ethan and ETH will just be. It'll be something that has the same features as BTC, but. But it won't be number one on Coinmarketcap. And so that's why I think people, it's Ethereum. That's not ten x better than BTC yet. Although there's no limit to how complacent BTC can get and how badly we can screw everything up.
00:33:30.736 - 00:33:47.412, Speaker D: We're already. We already have many address formats and we already have. Now you cannot import a private key because the wallet is being deleted. And we now have descriptor wallets which are like, made by the devil. So. So pretty soon it'll all just be ruined. Yeah.
00:33:47.412 - 00:33:49.116, Speaker D: Another three or four years.
00:33:49.308 - 00:34:05.564, Speaker A: Yeah. Just to keep on track. So we, we did mention, like, you know, some of the, like you said, shitcoins maybe are the first ride, but there, there's a lot of people in bitcoin land that don't like this kind of stuff. They don't want the NFTs. They don't want any of this stuff. You seem to be okay. That let people play hop on a ride.
00:34:05.564 - 00:34:06.092, Speaker A: It's fine.
00:34:06.156 - 00:34:07.044, Speaker D: Consumer sovereignty.
00:34:07.092 - 00:34:16.336, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Is op cat gonna be a good idea? And kind of, well, is a good.
00:34:16.368 - 00:34:50.010, Speaker D: Idea, but there's many dimensions to this, which is, why haven't we done many soft forks right now? We used to do three or so a year or two. We used to average two a year. It was not hit that way. But once we did three in one single go, and then the end of 2015, we did check lock time, verify, check sequence, verify. And like something else, I don't remember the exact list, but anyone can look it up. I have tweeted about this list before, and you can just see many soft forks in the past. Then with Segwit, the political will to do, the soft fork collapsed.
00:34:50.010 - 00:35:13.340, Speaker D: So my view is that the reason why Opcat is now getting attention is because it's very short. It's only a few lines of code. You know, whatever, 11, 14, 15, depending on how you count. And it's very small. It just concatenates two things and puts them back on the stack. So it's pretty simple. Bitcoin.
00:35:13.340 - 00:35:42.902, Speaker D: So I think that what people are doing is people are slowly realizing that. It's like you have. I'm not sure what great metaphor I can come up with, but it's like you have this. The patient is sick. The soft fork can cure any disease, but people are slowly realizing we actually can't. The medicine box that has the cure, the soft fork is we can't get it open. And now people are just panicking and they think, well, Opcat, that is.
00:35:42.902 - 00:36:10.926, Speaker D: That is pretty simple. And Udi and Eric, they shrewdly calculated. They figured this out before they said, okay, they understand the lay of the land. So they knew Opcat would be the one that people would re, would focus on because all this other stuff about CTV has been corrupted because of, because Jeremy Rubin is the scapegoat. Jeremy Rubin did nothing wrong. Like all scapegoats, Jeremy Rubin did nothing wrong, and, in fact, did everything right heroically.
00:36:10.998 - 00:36:14.398, Speaker A: I don't even know who Jerry, tv check.
00:36:14.534 - 00:36:15.330, Speaker D: Check.
00:36:15.910 - 00:36:20.366, Speaker B: Template verify Joseph Rubens brother.
00:36:20.438 - 00:36:27.578, Speaker A: I think we're learning more and more about the multi year drama of bitcoin land.
00:36:27.634 - 00:36:48.274, Speaker D: Yes. Yeah. I've got all the bitcoin lore that you want and probably too much. So if it goes on and on, I mean, specific question we do have to ask about OpcaT. I'm telling you, like, the Opcat part is not the relevant part. Yes, Opcat is a good idea. Yes, we can and should add it with soft fork.
00:36:48.274 - 00:37:07.690, Speaker D: I have a way, by the way, this thing cusf, I have coded away. If you go to bip 300, qsuff.com, i have an Opcat QSIP in addition to Bip 300. This is a core untouched soft fork. So this is a way of activating Opcat without even changing bitcoin core on GitHub or changing the binary of bitcoin core. You have a second.
00:37:07.770 - 00:37:11.670, Speaker A: Somebody in the chat is asking if you. If you've gotten a quantum cat.
00:37:12.250 - 00:37:21.266, Speaker D: I don't have one yet, but I feel like my relationship with Eric and UD is, you know, I feel like I should be getting stuff from them.
00:37:21.338 - 00:37:28.402, Speaker B: Yeah, the floor price has been pretty steady. I feel like the lots of diamond hands in the quantum, but those guys are great.
00:37:28.466 - 00:38:03.790, Speaker D: You know, here's but what I wanted to bring up about this is I don't think that they even care. I think they, what they understand. Opcat does a lot of things because there's already opcodes that endo other parts of what is basically a merkle tree. So I'm glossing over some technical stuff here, but basically if you, you want to have these trees of things that are very compressible because they're like merkle tree, the Opcat is like the only missing ingredient. So it's not the Opcat part. It's like they want this other thing where they want to do these various roll ups and things that they want to do.
00:38:03.910 - 00:38:05.118, Speaker A: ZK proofs.
00:38:05.254 - 00:38:28.696, Speaker D: Yeah, right. And so I think, like UD and Eric, the taproot wizards people, the opcat people, some of the meme people. I'm talking about the meme. I'm not talking about. Yeah, you know, the meme people. Exactly. They just like, they think that it's kind of like siblings and they can tell one of the siblings really wants something.
00:38:28.696 - 00:39:12.220, Speaker D: So then they kind of like, oh, they play with that toy first, but they don't really want it. They're just like, dad, no, this is mine now you have to ask me for it or something like that. They're playing some kind of like, funny little game with that, which is, which is fine enough, but it just shows you this whole process is completely irrational and defective. What? In a sane world, all the miners would know or they would have some kind of council or they would have some kind of thing where they just think in their head, will this make us more money? Will we get more transaction fees? Will we get a higher bitcoin exchange rate? And then they would do it, and there would be no, nothing else would happen. But instead, all this other crazy nonsense happens because of block size war and other software drama that is. This is strangling Paul.
00:39:13.200 - 00:39:34.780, Speaker A: Let us give you a sense of, you know, the crazy nonsense that can potentially happen on bitcoin. We have a segment, we have a segment this week called what's new in meme Coin Land? And you'll hear kind of like for a few minutes some of the crazy things just this week in meme coin land happening.
00:39:34.900 - 00:39:36.000, Speaker D: A lot can happen.
00:39:36.700 - 00:39:51.560, Speaker A: A lot can happen. We each have a story about a different meme coin. So we have three meme coins we're going to get into, but everybody, please like and subscribe and we'll dive in. Maybe, Taiki, you want to, you want to maybe start with, like, the Pac Moon drama?
00:39:52.540 - 00:40:08.214, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I mean, maybe this is, like, the least controversial out of the three, but, you know, Pac Moon was, you know, obviously based off of Pac man. Right. The founder of Blast, you know, Pac. Pac Moon. To the moon or something, whatever, right. They were talking about.
00:40:08.214 - 00:40:42.310, Speaker B: I think he had, like, $100 million market gap during the blast farming season. And there's been a lot of drama between the Pac Moon founder and the Blast foundation because the blast foundation is not really supporting native coins within their ecosystem. So now Pac Moon has decided to leave blast for solana, I believe, which makes no sense, but I mean, you know, I guess it drives more attention, right? Complaining about this on Twitter gets, like, thousands of impressions. So maybe it's good for the token price, because otherwise no one would care about it.
00:40:43.130 - 00:40:53.010, Speaker A: So it's pretty literally rough for the chain if the literal, like, meme coin based off the founder of the chain just says, like, screw it, we're leaving.
00:40:53.790 - 00:40:56.890, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, I don't really know, like, what their vision is.
00:40:57.630 - 00:40:57.966, Speaker A: There.
00:40:57.998 - 00:41:20.100, Speaker B: There's some utility, I think they're trying to be like, this social fi. Right, where Pac moon is, this, you know, like, tipping token where if you post something and people like it, then, you know, you can send other people, like Pac moon and stuff. It did pump a lot, you know, like, around may hit like hundred million. Now it's maybe like close to 100. And now it's. Yeah, it's in the depths of. It looks like a blast token chart, basically.
00:41:21.320 - 00:41:52.150, Speaker A: It kind of pumped when they said they're going to Solana, at least like a little bit. And it reminds me that things have changed since, like a year ago. This time it was the exact opposite. I think rollbit had changed their token from an SPL to ERC 20 and started mooning because they kind of tapped into the liquidity. Now the liquidity's moved. So, yeah, I mean, I saw Pac man himself put out a statement after this happened and saying, you know, sorry, like, we will be supporting. It just took a while, and these guys left before we were gonna about to do it.
00:41:52.150 - 00:42:08.150, Speaker A: So, I mean, as a founder, like, it definitely makes you reflect and see and I don't know how much, how much a change should support. Obviously, like, Solana has been supporting their. Their meme coins quite a bit.
00:42:08.250 - 00:42:28.006, Speaker C: I think a lot of it has to do is just look at the blast token price. The FTV is now about a billion. It's basically been down only mode. People thought this thing would be five x higher from here, or even more than that. And I think, like, to some extent, the Pac. The Pac moon meme coin founder. Like, the price is going down on blast.
00:42:28.006 - 00:42:55.090, Speaker C: Their meme coins going to go down with it. And there's just this desire to do something and move chains. I don't know if, like, like, it's sort of my theory that people are going to be upset no matter what you do. If price goes down and, you know, I don't know how much this is, the desire to go to Solana, even though there's more speculation there and just the relative underperformance of blast. But I don't really blame Pac man for this, for not, you know, providing the right incentives for builders and token launchers on the blast chain.
00:42:57.470 - 00:43:05.560, Speaker A: Yeah, um, we'll see if they, I think it looks like they've rebranded to army, so we'll see if they're successful.
00:43:06.340 - 00:43:06.708, Speaker B: Okay.
00:43:06.724 - 00:43:11.724, Speaker D: I like to review the right name. It doesn't matter what it does, you know, fight.
00:43:11.812 - 00:43:13.880, Speaker C: This is what you're building for on bitcoin.
00:43:14.980 - 00:43:57.524, Speaker D: I do think that this type of thing should be allowed, even though it should not really be like, empathy. Yeah. It's celebrated, right? It's what it is. The, the whole securitization process. Like the idea that someone, you have an entrepreneur with a good idea who's poor, and then you have some rich people down the street who get money under the mattress doing nothing. And the question is, should the poor person work as a janitor for 20 years, save up a lot of money and then launch their idea, their idea for a new engine or something? That's a horrible way to run society. There's a shortage.
00:43:57.524 - 00:44:22.012, Speaker D: We definitely, I knew new ideas is that is in short supply. And so the idea that you'd go to the rich people and you say, I'll give you shares in this corporation, I'll pay you back. After the engine makes a lot of money, I'll pay you back. Give me the cash now. That's doing nothing. They get a return. The entrepreneur who's poor quits their stupid job that is poorly allocated with their labor, is inefficient.
00:44:22.012 - 00:44:23.292, Speaker D: So this is like why we would.
00:44:23.316 - 00:44:26.356, Speaker A: Want, I'm gonna say this is like.
00:44:26.388 - 00:44:51.000, Speaker D: Issuing coins, is issuing stocks, collectibles, having, like, being able to join control. Who's in a club? You start a club with your friends. You say, whatever. Baseball club or whatever, you. And to be able to bet on things, all this stuff is, that's very healthy. But the idea of just creating something and just saying, you know, this is a Pac man coin. This is all because we don't have good banking.
00:44:51.000 - 00:45:01.754, Speaker D: I think, actually, none of this would happen if, if bitcoin, if the bitcoin network worked for banking, if it had already taken over, no one would want to do this, I think, or it would just be like, there will be.
00:45:01.802 - 00:45:02.750, Speaker A: There will be no.
00:45:05.730 - 00:45:07.042, Speaker C: Way to want to gamble.
00:45:07.146 - 00:45:52.400, Speaker D: There is like, recreational gambling is, of course, things that something that people do anyway. But, but I think that there's nothing wrong with, like, people should be allowed to do, should be allowed to do this, but we want to live in a world where I. There's so many other ways of just taking a gamble on something. Like, what if someone said three entrepreneurs are starting a new, whatever, spaceship company or something, and you kind of research them all and you think, I don't know. And then you and your friends, you kind of, like, have fun, and you say, I'll mostly invest in a, you mostly invest in b, you mostly invest in c. Well, now you're still getting all the fun of recreational gambling, but you're actually funding a real thing.
00:45:52.480 - 00:46:00.948, Speaker A: Paul, Paul, Paul. Like, zoomers have that attention span. They want to bet on hamster race, you know, which, which hamster is going to go quicker. They don't want to wait for ten years.
00:46:01.044 - 00:46:19.380, Speaker D: Doesn't. I think you may be right about that. I think the zoomers may actually be. It's, it's, it's a, it's a cliche to, to put down a certain generation, but I do think it's hard to do. It's hard to survive without an attention span. I think it hard. It's hard to make a lot of money also or, like, do anything important and anything worth doing in life.
00:46:19.380 - 00:46:32.956, Speaker D: Like, can these people, could these people even play, like, Simcity? I wonder about, like, if they would even be able to play that game, like, something that people, people born in, like, the eighties thought was really fun to, like, run the city and run.
00:46:32.988 - 00:46:34.680, Speaker C: The traffic on conversations.
00:46:35.220 - 00:46:41.476, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if Gen Z would, like, just kill themselves, like, after ten minutes of that.
00:46:41.668 - 00:46:47.840, Speaker A: I think they would. And I think you'll agree after these two more meme coins. Justin, do you wanna.
00:46:48.370 - 00:47:21.680, Speaker C: I'll go, yeah. So I took my first real big hit of the 2024 year on the Trump from the Trump guys, the Trump boys. So Donald Trump junior and the other brother, for the past week or so, starting on, like, October 6 7th, they have been hyping up this idea that the Trumps were going to launch a project in the crypto space, which it sounds like they're still standing by and they're still going to do. There was speculation on around the 7th. This was going to be like a real world assets, real estate company. People were looking into the trademarks, the filings. Everyone was getting excited.
00:47:21.680 - 00:47:53.056, Speaker C: Fast forward to this all happened yesterday. Things are moving very quickly. A new token was deployed on Solana called RTR restore the republic. And in sort of all of the established group chats on Telegram, a lot of established and, like, well known people on crypto Twitter were coming out and saying, this is the official Trump meme coin. Donald Trump junior is going to make a tweet any second now saying RTR is the official Trump meme coin. And everyone was bought in. I got caught up in the hype myself and got burnt by this.
00:47:53.056 - 00:48:11.520, Speaker C: So I heard about this early. I was in a group chat, I thought I was early. I heard about RTR at about five cents. And at five cents, I see, like, credible people saying, this is the official Trump coin. So I bought in and for like 2 hours I got the whole Solana thesis. I was euphoric. This thing went from five cents to fifteen cents.
00:48:11.520 - 00:48:47.532, Speaker C: I was counting all my chips before they were cashed in. Everything's going great. And then suddenly it turns out that this is not an official Trump coin. So Donald Trump Junior tweeted out saying, this is not the official project. We love what you guys are doing, but this ain't it. It turns out that there's, like, pretty good evidence that the Trumps were actually involved in, like, talking to the Kanpai Pandas founder from the Solana ecosystem to launch this meme coin. And rugged, the people building this, the kung Pie panda guy, and Donald Trump Junior then came.
00:48:47.532 - 00:49:19.088, Speaker C: He did like this. I'm not going to play it here, but he did this live podcast where he talks about how RTR isn't the real token and they have a real, real project. But, like, right before Trump Junior announced that RTR was a fake coin, there was, like, a lot of insider dumping. And so there's a lot of speculation that the Trumps are dumping on crypto people launching. Now, the second scam, Trump coin, I got burned by this. It's a little unfortunate. I think all of the crypto people for Trump are going crypto for Kamala now after we've been burnt by Donald too many times.
00:49:19.088 - 00:49:20.432, Speaker C: So we'll see what happens.
00:49:20.496 - 00:49:46.008, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I think what happened to add more color is, you know, this was supposedly the real one, but I think ice bags, like, told all his friends about it. And then his friends told other friends about it, and there was, like, this cabal that formed and they were all like, okay, like, let's. Let's just, like, buy this up, buy this up, buy this up. And then they started shilling it on Twitter. And then the Trump people were like, wait, like, this is. This is not good, right? Like, this is not fair.
00:49:46.008 - 00:49:48.920, Speaker B: This is insider trading. So they just like, yeah, they want.
00:49:48.960 - 00:49:51.936, Speaker D: They were supposed to do that. They were supposed to do the insider trading.
00:49:52.088 - 00:49:53.792, Speaker B: Yeah, allegedly.
00:49:53.856 - 00:49:58.432, Speaker C: They were locked up for six months. They had, like. They were doing this, right. There was proper vesting.
00:49:58.576 - 00:50:03.952, Speaker D: This thing is locked because you just sign a, like a forward contract or a futures contract.
00:50:04.016 - 00:50:04.360, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:50:04.440 - 00:50:30.452, Speaker D: Listen, I. I will get this in six months. What will you give me for it today and then return? There's really no such thing. I suppose. I mean, maybe a little bit. But I do think that the, like, you invite this situation in when you say that you will buy something that is just because it's endorsed by a celebrity, the celebrity has the full power to either make or break. They say, well, that's not the real one.
00:50:30.452 - 00:50:45.676, Speaker D: So they could do this 100 times in a row. You know what I mean? They could say, doing something big. Only they know that number 97 is the real one or that number five is the real one. So they can do it. They don't have to do it across time. You know what I mean? They just launch. They say, they create 100 rumors.
00:50:45.676 - 00:51:12.140, Speaker D: They say, I will launch Paul coin. I'm sure no one has done that. But there's like twelve different Paul coins. And then I say, this is. But I don't. You pump and dump first and then you tell people which one it is. So you're inviting this situation where it's something that the person can make or break the coin, that they're the only one who can make money in this.
00:51:12.300 - 00:51:15.260, Speaker A: No one is to blame but you, Justin. That's the bottom line here.
00:51:15.340 - 00:51:33.644, Speaker C: Like Jordan in the pre show, you shared this bold Leonidas image of the two trumps cackling together. So then I bought a bunch of the supply unveiled five minutes before the launch. I did the same thing with shkreli. Listen, I'm not to blame for this. I'm the victim. Okay?
00:51:33.812 - 00:52:08.812, Speaker A: It definitely happened twice. And, you know, there was a lot of anger against, you know, the compile pandas guy and even, you know, size chat and anybody else who tweeted against this. And it kind of is a bad look, because even if it was the real one, they're still you know, like, caballing to kind of, like, push it. So either way, it's just like, there's not a good look. Although, you know, I have to say, it's all gray areas. It's in a black and white. You know, what's the difference between them caballing a coin and pepe getting cabal'd.
00:52:08.812 - 00:52:29.394, Speaker A: And then everyone's happy because it does go up a lot. I think in this case, people are angry that there were wallets that sniped and then dumped and made, like, millions of dollars. And it's unclear who those are. And I. Some. Somebody out there has done well, um, and that's, I think, what makes people angry. And we'll see.
00:52:29.394 - 00:52:31.594, Speaker A: We'll see how that plays out. But given what happens.
00:52:31.642 - 00:52:38.618, Speaker D: But if you're not willing to be angry, then why are you happy when you make money on meme coins? Because it's the same thing.
00:52:38.674 - 00:52:39.106, Speaker A: Just.
00:52:39.218 - 00:52:40.290, Speaker C: I will never be happy.
00:52:40.330 - 00:52:41.510, Speaker D: Don't worry about you.
00:52:42.370 - 00:52:44.746, Speaker B: Yeah, we hold Eth, so we're never happy.
00:52:44.898 - 00:52:45.630, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:52:46.990 - 00:52:59.850, Speaker D: Yeah. Wait until bitcoin releases its 84th address format, but no actual, no real innovation. Then Eth will look really good.
00:53:00.710 - 00:53:10.630, Speaker A: Yeah. So I have, like, one more meme coin to talk about, which is, unfortunately, that the doge og passed away.
00:53:10.670 - 00:53:11.406, Speaker B: Kabosu.
00:53:11.518 - 00:53:34.882, Speaker A: Yeah, kabosu is dead. Uh, the family got a new coin, and apparently there, this is, like, how the human ingenuity is being used these days, Paul. This is where all the great minds of our time are being used. Yeah, they made scripts to try to make a meme coin as soon as the name was announced. So they're waiting for the family to announce the name of the new Shiba Inu dog. And as soon as it came out.
00:53:34.906 - 00:53:44.334, Speaker D: This is like the FOMC. You're aware of this with the fed? People do this where the fed puts out whether the rate cut and people have, like, advanced Jordy does. This is.
00:53:44.422 - 00:53:48.678, Speaker A: That was my life. Yeah, yeah, I did the whole PDF.
00:53:48.734 - 00:53:51.050, Speaker D: So this is you probably doing the script.
00:53:52.190 - 00:53:53.530, Speaker B: It's Jordy.
00:53:54.110 - 00:53:57.650, Speaker D: Jordy is dumping on you guys five minutes before the next episode.
00:53:58.670 - 00:53:59.490, Speaker B: Yo.
00:54:00.470 - 00:54:08.130, Speaker D: Holy. Those effects. Wow. Yeah.
00:54:11.280 - 00:54:51.000, Speaker A: The dog was right over your head, Paul. I digress. So, bottom line, a ton of scripts got the name narrow Nero. They made shitcoins, and obviously, Solana, right now, you have pumped out funds. All this, so easy. So two Solana meme coins started around the same time. The first one apparently, you know, was going up and went up to, like, nine figures, and apparently Ansem, who is, you know, the Michael sailor of Solana, let's call him, because his opinion kind of moves the mountains there.
00:54:51.000 - 00:55:12.610, Speaker A: He got on Twitter spaces and said, guys, no, it's not that one. I like the other one. Even though everything's the same, it's the same name. Maybe you can bring up the deck screener here, Justin. We can look. I think this one was the. Which one's which? This looks like the one that.
00:55:12.610 - 00:55:15.770, Speaker A: Well, it's a 9 million.
00:55:16.630 - 00:55:32.612, Speaker D: When people are walking down the street and they're like, americans and like, where is Iraq? And then they have a different map where Iraq is, like, over Australia. And people like, oh, and they put like a pin in. You see that for these charts, like, which one is the real one? Oh, which. And then everyone's just like, what? And they haven't.
00:55:32.676 - 00:55:39.084, Speaker A: You know, the funny thing is, like, they've both ended up being around 10 million ftv now. So here's another one. That make any difference?
00:55:39.252 - 00:55:41.200, Speaker D: All's well that ends well, you know.
00:55:41.740 - 00:55:45.636, Speaker C: Yeah. Another one about maybe all the people.
00:55:45.788 - 00:55:57.160, Speaker D: Launching these projects and promoting them also lost track. So it's just like a random crapshoot now. Just. They have to be the same. They have to be the same in every way. The same price, because they're just the same.
00:55:57.690 - 00:55:58.430, Speaker A: Well.
00:56:00.730 - 00:56:04.482, Speaker D: Fungible dog meme coin with.
00:56:04.586 - 00:56:09.994, Speaker A: Not exactly. Not exactly. Because even, like, the ticker, you know, that there's. There's a. Paul, is there.
00:56:10.082 - 00:56:11.870, Speaker D: Do you know which ticker is which?
00:56:12.290 - 00:56:19.530, Speaker A: Well, that's my point. That's my point. No, there's a ticker called bitcoin. Right? There's a bitcoin and.
00:56:19.610 - 00:56:38.228, Speaker D: Yeah, but people know how to tell that one. They know how to tell that one from the real bitcoin because they could run. They could run a bitcoin full node. I mean, I don't know. Just people like Coinbase or whatever people are. Coinbase will get fired if they give people the wrong bitcoin. You know, but no one's.
00:56:38.228 - 00:56:44.604, Speaker D: No one's gonna get fired if they give them coin because no one knows the difference. No one will even know it's a victimless crime.
00:56:44.772 - 00:56:47.680, Speaker B: Wasn't there, like, the real neighborhood on either or something?
00:56:47.980 - 00:57:04.776, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is. Yeah, so, so Nero and ETH has ended up beating both of them. And maybe. Let's bring up that chart, because that one has actually gone up to 200, 220 million. Here we go. So this one is winning, apparently.
00:57:04.968 - 00:57:07.980, Speaker D: Look at how green that chart is. Green. That means good.
00:57:08.280 - 00:57:08.920, Speaker B: That's good.
00:57:08.960 - 00:57:09.540, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:57:10.360 - 00:57:11.800, Speaker C: You approve of this, Paul?
00:57:11.920 - 00:57:17.634, Speaker A: I like greenhouse so I don't know.
00:57:17.642 - 00:57:20.098, Speaker B: The name is Nero on. It's like the only way to describe.
00:57:20.154 - 00:57:21.870, Speaker D: Is the number of decimal places.
00:57:22.650 - 00:57:54.324, Speaker A: So I did inquire, and I was a bit perplexed, because Solana is getting most of the meme coin hype. And I asked. I asked around, I said, why is Nero and eth the one that's actually at, you know, 200 million? I think it's like dust. And apparently it's because, you know, Shiba inu, ethereum based. And the culture for Shiba is more like a theory maligned. So screw these Solana guys trying to, like, steal our meme. The etherium version is gonna be the one that has to win.
00:57:54.324 - 00:57:58.044, Speaker A: And, you know. Yeah, I guess that's working for now. So.
00:57:58.132 - 00:58:04.320, Speaker D: I love jealousy. Trying to make someone jealous. You. You flirt with the other.
00:58:05.140 - 00:58:17.710, Speaker C: Whatever someone said, this was a top signal in the comments. So true. I went to Solana and I missed nero coin. I bought this fake from Ponzi scam coin, and I missed the canonical nero coin on ethereum. That's terrible.
00:58:18.570 - 00:58:22.710, Speaker B: Yeah, they're distracting you, right? They're distracting you from the real prize.
00:58:23.010 - 00:58:23.790, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:58:24.290 - 00:58:28.550, Speaker D: So much attention in any given day. Scarce resource.
00:58:28.930 - 00:58:42.724, Speaker A: So, Paul, this is what you have to look forward to. If, you know, l two s and sidechains come to bitcoin land, you'll get a sale of coin. You know, sailor Moon. You'll get sailor moon for sure. That will 100% be like the main.
00:58:42.772 - 00:58:45.396, Speaker B: Yeah, there'll be like a chair coin or something.
00:58:45.588 - 00:58:46.300, Speaker D: Chair coin.
00:58:46.340 - 00:58:49.476, Speaker B: Yeah, one single chair.
00:58:49.548 - 00:58:52.940, Speaker A: Um, let's, uh, limited supply to just.
00:58:52.980 - 00:58:59.540, Speaker D: One very illiquid liquidity is very low.
00:58:59.580 - 00:59:06.090, Speaker A: Because let's maybe get, uh. Let's get some, like, um. Last question for.
00:59:06.830 - 00:59:08.690, Speaker D: Okay, yeah, yeah. Let's go.
00:59:10.790 - 00:59:19.326, Speaker A: Before we go to cost of the week, I'll start with one. You know, one of the reasons we wanted to have you on was prediction markets. And we talked last episode about, yes.
00:59:19.478 - 00:59:44.040, Speaker D: There'S some market and most neglected technology of our time. It will make the printing press look like Cartoon network. When people, when our descendants among the galaxies look back on this era, it will just be like, when was writing invented? When was fire invented? When was the printing press invented? When was the computer invented? When. When were prediction markets invented? Is my opinion. This is my opinion.
00:59:44.080 - 00:59:47.020, Speaker A: I may be your future most bullish.
00:59:47.480 - 00:59:49.860, Speaker D: Play this clip and put, like, a little slide rule.
00:59:50.960 - 01:00:15.678, Speaker A: There is no one, no one as bullish as Paul in the entire universe on prediction markets. The printing press has nothing on prediction. Let's maybe like, yeah, let's maybe understand why. So is your thesis that aligning incentives brings in the collective knowledge of society, and that collective knowledge makes us make better decisions?
01:00:15.734 - 01:00:15.998, Speaker D: Yes.
01:00:16.054 - 01:00:16.446, Speaker A: What is it?
01:00:16.478 - 01:00:39.432, Speaker D: We definitely need to combine our knowledge, but the issue is how? I mean, it's easier said than done. Oh, we'll get everyone in a big room, and then we'll all talk to each other. Wait a minute. That doesn't work at all because it's n squared. Only so many people can talk at once. And in fact, people self censor what they say based on what they think is acceptable. So even once a committee reaches like twelve people, it becomes useless.
01:00:39.432 - 01:00:57.250, Speaker D: Even if there's, even if Elon Musk is on the committee, the only way it works is if one person just says the rest. The other eleven people just shut the fuck up and go home. I will do this project. That's the only way the committee will work. If you decommittiate it, no art was ever made. No, no, nothing ever good ever came out of a committee, ever. So.
01:00:57.250 - 01:01:22.358, Speaker D: But we, but having one guy, yolo, it, that's also terrible. The ideal thing would be if you can combine all of society's knowledge. So you say aligned incentives. But that's very, that's the trick. You know, it's like saying, oh, the trick to getting to outer space is to just fly a rocket up there. But it's like, okay, like there's like a million things in your way, a million little decisions you have to make. So this is the trick.
01:01:22.358 - 01:02:19.760, Speaker D: The prediction market does this. And one of the reasons why it's so great is that people don't understand the extent to which all of us are self deluded and to which we have been corrupted by. There are these parasites. They don't know that they're para, I don't, you know, I don't mean anything bad, but like when the reason why Bill O'Reilly had a show, I mean, I'm trying to guess how old all of you are and where you're from, or pick like a good metaphor. But Bill O'Reilly was not like the most insightful person, but he, but he, he had this kind of people, the audience trusted him because he had a certain personality and a background. And, and so that was, that was actually good because having some champions of the media, Walter Cronkite, whatever, this had like a log n scaling, basically, where the society has, America has 300 million people, you have log of that very small few trusted people. And then people would just say, I'm not going to watch that show anymore.
01:02:19.760 - 01:02:56.996, Speaker D: If I catch that person in a lie now, that was okay. But this is not, this is still not good enough, because as you, as we know, with every host, including Bill O'Reilly, they have, like, their own human bias. They have their own frailties. And the audience, they're captured by the audience also. We need something where everyone is rooting out error constantly. And that is what the prediction market does. Because if there's any error defined as the difference between the current market price and the objective likelihood, the objective reality, someone has an incentive to buy the cheaper, sell, the more expensive, and bring them back into alignment.
01:02:56.996 - 01:03:04.010, Speaker D: And it's a tireless thing where every bias will be rooted out eventually and then.
01:03:05.230 - 01:03:10.974, Speaker A: Yeah, but, like, you know, do you expect that society will make, like, important decisions based on the prediction markets, though?
01:03:11.022 - 01:03:50.362, Speaker D: Yes, but not, it won't be like, it'll be like the printing press, where at first everyone just be like, what the hell is this going on? And, like, they just have no idea what it's doing. And, like, the printing press, at first, people just used it in the old context. So, as you probably know, all the only people who could read or write were members of the clergy or other various monks of various kinds. Extreme cultural. So, like, these are people copying the Bible by hand. And so, of course, when the printing press came out, it was. I don't want to say it was pitched to the world, but I'm just trying to translate it to, like, a more modern phraseology, if you will.
01:03:50.362 - 01:04:41.820, Speaker D: You know, where it's like, okay, this is now an easier way to make bibles, and we can give more bibles to people. Of course, in a way, this was the last thing that many people wanted, because the, the, the way of doing the, like, way of controlling society included that the priests were the only ones who could interpret the religious scripture and stuff. And as soon as the Lutherans, as soon as some people prioritized everyone being able to read and everyone being able to read the Bible in particular, as soon as they prioritized that, it led to, like, a complete revolt against the aristocrats and the king, and those countries became more of what we might call, like, a liberal democracy. But that was so, this is enormous upheaval, just copying the Bible. Little did people know that what was coming down was the ability to publish pamphlets and on any sort of market.
01:04:42.160 - 01:04:47.800, Speaker A: I mean, just in the interest of time, like, where are we now? Like, is polymarket? Do you like.
01:04:47.920 - 01:05:22.648, Speaker D: We're, like, of the way in. We are not even. We don't even have the first real prediction market that would meet, like, my standards. Although we have had, I would say, really in trade started it. The idea of the custodial foreign us dollar prediction market in trade with this company in Ireland because of weird us gambling laws. And they started this up, and it has slowly accumulated steam. They're having, maybe I would say the have a market scoring real blockchain.
01:05:22.648 - 01:05:45.200, Speaker D: Ethereum would be like, level two. So. But we have to get to, like, level 50, basically. So we're okay. We're very far from what I think we are. And in particular, what will happen eventually is the public will realize that this is the most reliable way of doing things. It'd be kind of like gap accounting, where if you're the first person to do gap accounting, it makes it seem like you're a weirdo.
01:05:45.200 - 01:05:56.640, Speaker D: You say, oh, this is this way. I don't trust my auditors. I don't trust my company. I don't trust anyone, any of my employees. I don't trust the investors. Don't trust. So you'd say, why are they doing that? But after everyone starts to do it, then.
01:05:56.640 - 01:06:00.020, Speaker D: Now you look weird if you're not doing it. So we will then reach a full.
01:06:01.440 - 01:06:11.200, Speaker A: It's good to get that understanding and also the fact that we're not anywhere near, like, we're on .0 the site, bitcoin hivemind.com.
01:06:11.240 - 01:06:14.380, Speaker D: You can read all about my prediction market thoughts, if you care about that.
01:06:14.760 - 01:06:31.540, Speaker A: Bitcoin, hivemind.com dot, please check it out, guys. We'll head out to pasta of the week. I know we're running short on time. I thought we had the better graphic with, like, the full. The full, like, all the pepes and stuff. There we go.
01:06:31.540 - 01:06:33.744, Speaker A: This is. This is the one that we need.
01:06:33.792 - 01:06:34.432, Speaker D: Wow.
01:06:34.616 - 01:06:41.260, Speaker A: Thank you. All right, so, taiki, let's put off the pasta.
01:06:42.010 - 01:06:52.586, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, as a. As a sizable eat holder, this pasta really resonated with me. Justin, if you can pull it up. Wait, wait, no. And it's not this one. It's not this one.
01:06:52.738 - 01:06:54.590, Speaker D: This is funny, though. I like this one.
01:06:55.450 - 01:07:01.802, Speaker B: I mean, it's true, right? This is bullish or bags. Hashtag copium. Wait, you don't hear. Let me. Let me share mine.
01:07:01.866 - 01:07:03.510, Speaker C: I got it, I got it, I got it.
01:07:04.570 - 01:07:05.082, Speaker B: There you go.
01:07:05.106 - 01:07:06.058, Speaker D: There you go. Yeah.
01:07:06.074 - 01:07:16.378, Speaker B: You know, bad news eth down, good news eth down, no news eth down. Fud east down, no fud eth down. Market's good. Eat down, not good. Eth down. Eth goes down a lot. East down.
01:07:16.378 - 01:07:18.682, Speaker B: Eth kind of goes up and then e goes down.
01:07:18.786 - 01:07:19.234, Speaker A: This is.
01:07:19.282 - 01:07:24.426, Speaker B: Has been the story of an ETH holders journey for, like, the past five months. We just.
01:07:24.578 - 01:07:25.430, Speaker A: We keep.
01:07:25.730 - 01:07:41.534, Speaker B: They keep, you know, getting us. You know, there's so much hopium on the timeline, it's like, oh, it's. The ETF has to be bullish. No, like, I feel like everyone kind of expected the ETF to give us, like, the final exit pump, and now everyone's trapped because we're all underwater on our lungs.
01:07:41.662 - 01:07:58.010, Speaker A: Sad. Yeah, it's too real. Shad is going to be more. More sad about this, Justin. Any good one?
01:07:59.190 - 01:08:30.740, Speaker C: It's also sad, but it's close to home, so I'll give some. Some background on this one. So working on a project, we build on chain applications, and there's always this question of where you're going to launch it. And you sort of have to play this, like, mental game of, like, trying to figure out which is going to be the hype chain of the next few months. Is Solana gonna be there? Is it gonna be base? Is it gonna be optimism? Maybe if a bitcoin L2 ever gets off the ground. Like, maybe a bitcoin L2 could do that. But, like, three or four months ago, before the summer started, we're having a little powwow with our whole team.
01:08:30.740 - 01:08:44.096, Speaker C: Like, where should we go? And I raised my hand and I say, guys, didn't you hear? Base is doing another on chain summer. We've got to be on base. Like, this summer is going to be lit. And people still say lit.
01:08:44.248 - 01:08:45.600, Speaker D: I thought they changed it something.
01:08:45.680 - 01:08:52.072, Speaker C: Well, I'm over 30 now, Paul, so I'm pretty outdated when it comes to the right terminology and stuff. I'm a boomer.
01:08:52.256 - 01:08:56.160, Speaker D: You need to consult a younger cousin or a niece or something.
01:08:56.320 - 01:09:23.592, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah. The new password, but Gort part. How about you come down here and tell us about your little on chain summer? And this is sort of what I felt like over the past few months. Like, on chain summer. What even is that? I know base is activating, like, a coffee shop where you pay with USDC everywhere but in a few places, but there's really nothing that's substantial that has, you know, come out of this thing. So that's my story.
01:09:23.776 - 01:09:28.100, Speaker B: This. That's also very sad. I resonate with this.
01:09:28.400 - 01:09:37.496, Speaker A: Solid sad. It's a sad, sad pasta week. Paul, we. We. We decided as a guest, you get two pastas, so I didn't know they.
01:09:37.528 - 01:09:41.288, Speaker D: Said, find a funny tweet okay, can we do the second one, the space one?
01:09:41.464 - 01:09:44.792, Speaker C: The space one. Space one first. You got it.
01:09:44.816 - 01:10:09.430, Speaker D: This one's a little heavy, even though it's also funny. So this is hilarious. Tweet. I mean, I know it's not crypto related, but I. The people Boeing trapped these astronauts in this, in space for, like, nine months. They're stuck up there, and Elon can't even fly up his own thing and get them down because, like, they would have to, like, lose this. There's no software.
01:10:09.430 - 01:10:36.600, Speaker D: I mean, it is software related. So basically, they can't rescue the humans because they need the humans to fly this Boeing part back to Earth. The humans have to fly it back to Earth. So they were supposed to be up there for, like, whatever, like a couple days or something. Now they're going to be up there until, like, February 2025 or something like that, all because of Boeing and because of software. So I thought this was pretty funny. You know? You know, that's just how it goes.
01:10:36.600 - 01:10:44.016, Speaker D: Sometimes you're just stuck in a space just because of Boeing. You're just stuck in space with someone else.
01:10:44.088 - 01:10:47.264, Speaker B: These are all sad busters. This is like, these people are trapped up there.
01:10:47.352 - 01:11:12.520, Speaker D: Well, I mean, the other one I had was really sad. So can we do that? We do that one. Also, I think this is the most accurate description of communism ever established. Establish a new communist utopia. Rob or kill the successful. And then a lot of people don't emphasize this third step. Everyone always says they kill all the successful people so there won't be any great companies.
01:11:12.520 - 01:11:26.520, Speaker D: But then they forget the third step. Force everyone to work for free. The rest, like, the poor people, they have to farm, but they don't get to keep what they farm. It just all goes to someone else. And then maybe they give you food back.
01:11:27.620 - 01:11:32.680, Speaker A: Then he knows all about the farmers getting farmed. He knows about that.
01:11:33.300 - 01:11:45.224, Speaker B: Yeah. And also, I feel like this tweak or this screenshot also encapsulates the nero and the Trump coin. Like meme coinbugs. It's just like, oh, that's not the real meme, Cohen. And they just keep doing this entire thing.
01:11:45.272 - 01:11:46.060, Speaker D: It's not.
01:11:46.880 - 01:11:48.328, Speaker C: People keep giving away.
01:11:48.504 - 01:12:08.532, Speaker D: They usually remember that some point you run out of food and then starve to death, and then everyone remembers the last second to last. That stay wasn't real communism. People remember that. But people, I just thought this is a great description because it. Everyone always forgets that. They force everyone to work for free. Everyone always forgets that, Stephen.
01:12:08.532 - 01:12:22.952, Speaker D: And then they just think like, it's no. There's no Elon Musk. So we run out of food, and it's like, no, because every. There's no anything, and then everyone dies. So I thought, everyone dies. What an accurate tweet. And I just thought, there you go.
01:12:22.952 - 01:12:27.776, Speaker D: I got a laugh out of that one. We don't want any communism around here. That's not good.
01:12:27.888 - 01:12:45.740, Speaker A: No communism. No communism, please. All right, well, talk about communism. I'm going to end up with Eth as well. Another. Another sad heath, just to round it out. So Eric wall, as we've spoken to with his little cat there, says, this is my culture.
01:12:45.740 - 01:12:49.520, Speaker A: This is my culture. Let's listen to the culture here.
01:12:57.100 - 01:13:21.376, Speaker D: Great start. Thank you so much, Vitalik. Bertram, when you talking, I saw everyone's eye is sparkling and then fully focused without natural timing of blinking. So I can tell how much they all looking forward to this precious moment. Let's give up. Oh, I'm too excited anymore. Once more.
01:13:21.376 - 01:13:24.784, Speaker D: So let's give a big applause.
01:13:24.872 - 01:13:25.992, Speaker B: Okay, thank you.
01:13:26.096 - 01:13:33.170, Speaker D: Thank you so much. This is, you know, these poor people, their English is not their first language, and so they're trying. What if we had to speak Chinese?
01:13:33.670 - 01:13:35.038, Speaker A: Uh, I mean, it's.
01:13:35.094 - 01:13:35.750, Speaker C: We don't try.
01:13:35.830 - 01:13:38.486, Speaker A: Sentiment is, you know, it's not English.
01:13:38.558 - 01:13:38.782, Speaker D: It's.
01:13:38.806 - 01:13:40.886, Speaker A: It's like she's like, there.
01:13:40.918 - 01:13:47.330, Speaker D: Yeah, I know. She's like, I'm so overwhelmed. Just the great. This. This presentation is going to be the greatest thing ever made.
01:13:47.990 - 01:13:58.210, Speaker B: I love your body stance. He was like, I don't know, like, his. His body posture. His body language is so uncanny. I've never seen anyone like it.
01:13:59.060 - 01:14:23.970, Speaker D: He's like that guy that, like, that weird philosopher, like, moving around, you know? You know what I'm talking about? What is his name? Like, Zizak or something. This is. Now he's like, he has, like, a very interesting way of talking, and he's always, like, flinching and, like, I guess I don't know who it is, so I shouldn't have brought it up. Apologies to that person who's. Yeah, work I have read, but I don't remember his name.
01:14:24.140 - 01:15:03.044, Speaker A: The live poll is up, so we'll get some votes. We'll take a couple minutes. But, you know, speaking of Vitalik, it does feel like it's hopefully a time for some reflection about, like, the role of the founders on these chains. You know, maybe it is good that they take a life of its own. Even on Solana, we saw that Anatoly Washington, he, quote, tweeted, the RTR meme coin thing himself, and he put an american flag before it, rugged. And I think maybe he deleted his tweet. So founders are not infallible, even.
01:15:03.044 - 01:15:05.520, Speaker A: Even blockchain founders.
01:15:05.900 - 01:15:12.360, Speaker D: Vitalik supposed to be, like, handcuffed to Ethereum for the rest of his life. Like, is that the premise?
01:15:13.620 - 01:15:17.080, Speaker B: Until he goes to ten k. If it goes to ten k, it's okay, he can leave.
01:15:17.940 - 01:15:48.458, Speaker D: Yeah, but when people. I remember when people used to say, wow, if bitcoin went to a thousand, can you imagine if bitcoin went to $1,000 and everyone said, that was the moon. $1,000 per coin was the moon. So we go to the moon, and people thought, can you imagine? And I knew people who said that when it went to $2 a coin, they said, or even when it was $1, they said, wow, one bitcoin is worth more than $1. That proves that bitcoin is better than the dollar. I remember when that happened on my bitcoin talk. So there will always be these people who say, oh, we want more.
01:15:48.458 - 01:15:49.910, Speaker D: We want it to be 100,000.
01:15:53.010 - 01:16:23.734, Speaker A: The only thing bearish right now about that is the founder of bitcoin. Can't do anything wrong at this point. He's kind of disappeared. But they're finding faults with everything that Vitalik is doing. Apparently, the poor guy, he got a girlfriend, I think, is what it looks like. We'll look at this, this tweet, but it does look like a girlfriend boyfriend type of situation going on. And, you know, the Twitter sphere started dumping all their ETH because, you know.
01:16:23.742 - 01:16:41.060, Speaker D: The artistically focused on the mission. This is the issue with centralization, though, is that people will try to harass Vitalik or. And. Or whatever, assassinate him or something, which I don't have. You know, we don't encourage, but those.
01:16:41.100 - 01:16:42.480, Speaker C: Matching hats, man.
01:16:46.220 - 01:16:56.044, Speaker D: Necessarily look like that could, you know, women, when they go. When they take the selfie, they often lean in, or they do. They try. They pull some kind of, you know.
01:16:56.092 - 01:16:57.812, Speaker B: But he's not even looking at the camera.
01:16:57.916 - 01:17:06.788, Speaker A: Like Justin. Remember when Justin was with Suzu and the nightclub, and they took a picture? That's what Justin got the line, yeah.
01:17:06.884 - 01:17:07.920, Speaker C: No, no, no.
01:17:08.340 - 01:17:32.728, Speaker D: I mean, many times this is like a humble brag, but, like, people come up to me at a conference, and they're like, okay, we take a picture, and you're like, what the fuck am I gonna say no? I can't say no. They could just, like, stand near me and just take it, and then I'm gonna look like an idiot. So, so, yeah, you always just kind of smile and say, sure. And then what are you gonna do? Are you gonna do the hover hand? You know, people don't like that. People complain no matter what you do. So they have a, we have a.
01:17:32.744 - 01:17:44.820, Speaker A: Great, we have an amazing comment, by the way. Somebody says the reason jump was dumping is because they, they had a, they front ran the girlfriend news. They, they had a high frequency feed for the girlfriend news and started dumping.
01:17:46.640 - 01:17:50.568, Speaker B: Smart, actually. It's very smart. That's why the best results you gotta.
01:17:50.584 - 01:18:05.670, Speaker D: Get in, you say, you put in your short, you say, I'm gonna short eth. And then you, you hire some, some women, you say, listen, photos of them girlfriend, and we'll make it. We'll make $100 million, I hope comes back.
01:18:05.710 - 01:18:07.054, Speaker C: I'd love to see what he's work.
01:18:07.102 - 01:18:10.450, Speaker B: Actually, no, like, that could actually work like every day, just different.
01:18:13.310 - 01:18:30.016, Speaker A: You should have said more of these ideas. These are amazing. This is like a hundred million dollar idea right there, for sure. All right, so we have the poll results. Oh, I think, I think the only.
01:18:30.208 - 01:18:34.700, Speaker C: Listeners voted, first of all, that's, that's a huge problem. We gotta get those numbers up.
01:18:35.560 - 01:18:42.792, Speaker D: The video was captivating. I was on the edge of my seat. I was.
01:18:42.896 - 01:18:45.848, Speaker A: You, were you blinking? Were you blinking naturally in the, I.
01:18:45.864 - 01:19:04.530, Speaker D: Didn'T know what was gonna happen. I was like, how? I mean, I feel like that could have gone on and on and on too. Like maybe it just starts and it's just so, just awkward thing about like twelve dimensional hypercubes or whatever, and you're just like so awkward and everyone's just like pretending cuts to the audience. The audience is like pretending to pay attention.
01:19:05.390 - 01:19:10.054, Speaker A: Vitalik's face encapsulated the WTF of that moment.
01:19:10.102 - 01:19:20.458, Speaker D: So he's got that like really dramatic hairline now. The hair, his hairline. Yes. I remember young vitality.
01:19:20.654 - 01:19:26.282, Speaker C: Now he's in wartime Vitalik. He's got to shave his head and really get rid of my girlfriend and commit to building.
01:19:26.426 - 01:19:28.298, Speaker B: Yeah, that would be bullish that we're so bullish.
01:19:28.354 - 01:19:33.882, Speaker D: Like then if you're miss Ten K and he gets like the hair surgery or something, or whatever, I don't know.
01:19:33.906 - 01:19:35.830, Speaker C: Like goes to turkey.
01:19:36.650 - 01:19:37.630, Speaker A: Oh, man.
01:19:37.930 - 01:19:43.550, Speaker D: He goes like full Joe Rogan. And he's just like MMA fighter podcaster.
01:19:44.810 - 01:19:52.440, Speaker A: Oh, my God. The comments are, the comments are brutal. All right, Paul, well, thank you so much for, thanks for helping us.
01:19:53.060 - 01:19:57.000, Speaker B: Wait, can we pull up the comment by Ng?
01:19:57.420 - 01:19:59.044, Speaker C: I don't see a comment from Ng.
01:19:59.092 - 01:20:03.748, Speaker D: I don't even pulled up. What does the comment say?
01:20:03.844 - 01:20:05.520, Speaker A: All right, all right.
01:20:06.620 - 01:20:08.244, Speaker D: You know, we'll never know.
01:20:08.332 - 01:20:11.000, Speaker B: You gotta pull it up now, Justin. You gotta pull it up.
01:20:13.500 - 01:20:18.080, Speaker D: Oh. Oh, that's dirty.
01:20:18.380 - 01:20:19.440, Speaker B: That's dirty.
01:20:21.140 - 01:20:23.628, Speaker D: That's not. Yeah, that's. That's. Yeah.
01:20:23.804 - 01:20:24.800, Speaker C: Yeah, that's.
01:20:25.260 - 01:20:29.280, Speaker D: Yeah. You're asking for trouble, then it will happen to you. That's how it happens.
01:20:29.780 - 01:20:32.788, Speaker A: Oh, man. All right, well, thanks, everybody, for.
01:20:32.924 - 01:20:39.040, Speaker D: For joining hair cloning. DNA. Hair cloning. They're gonna invent that in, like, five years.
01:20:39.940 - 01:20:51.240, Speaker A: Please, like and subscribe. Thank you to Paul for. For hopping on this week and sharing everything going on bitcoin land. And we'll see you guys next week. Take care. Peace.
