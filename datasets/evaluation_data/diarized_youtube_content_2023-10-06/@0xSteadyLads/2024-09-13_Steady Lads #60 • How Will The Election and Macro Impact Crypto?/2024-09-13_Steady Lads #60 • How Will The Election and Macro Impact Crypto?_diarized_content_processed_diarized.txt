00:00:00.400 - 00:00:19.565, Speaker A: Hey everyone and thanks for tuning back in. I wanted to remind you that we're hosting Steady Drinks with Steady Lads for subscribers in Singapore for token 2049. The link is in the description below and the event is on Tuesday, September 17th from 4:30pm to 6:30pm the three of us will be there and we'd love to meet you there and chat more about our space.
00:00:40.485 - 00:00:51.485, Speaker B: Welcome steady as everybody. Episode 60 this is the pre Singapore episode. Justin and Taiki are about to fly out and meet me in the wonderful land of palm trees.
00:00:51.565 - 00:00:54.865, Speaker A: And Jordy, you're going to scoop us from the airport, right?
00:00:55.685 - 00:01:06.831, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. I'm going to, you know, use use my car, which I don't have here. Come get you. We'll get into markets in a little bit, but excited to have you here.
00:01:06.863 - 00:01:07.111, Speaker A: Of course.
00:01:07.143 - 00:01:47.051, Speaker B: We're going to do a live episode on stage at Token on Thursday so anyone who's around can come hang out. We will have Chao Wang, he will be our guest as he has been a couple times already and so we're looking forward to that. He's always really on the ball but it has been an eventful week. We have had debates and inflation news. Everything has been quite volatile. But at the end of the week, at least it looks for now, I'm recording that we are in a pretty good spot. I think the vibes were really bad and things still balanced.
00:01:47.051 - 00:01:55.331, Speaker B: So I don't know what it tells you guys but for me it says that there is some external support coming in and it could be macro related.
00:01:55.483 - 00:02:22.191, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I had a question for you Jordi. So before we talk about the debate, I think we can talk about the rate cuts. So obviously the Fed meeting will be next week. They're expected to rate cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points. Do you think that will have an impact to crypto or do you think that's mostly been priced in but just generally do you think that will lead to more stable coin inflows on chain? Because maybe the, you know, defi rates will be more competitive with Shatfi rates.
00:02:22.383 - 00:02:43.855, Speaker B: It's not going to change anything. For now. You know, 25 bips is definitely priced in and at this point it's not going to affect anything. No one's going to change their behavior based on that. I think at the end of the year if we get four rate cuts and we're at 1% lower, things might start to shift a little bit. For now, this is nothing exciting in terms of uncertainty being resolved. There's no uncertainty.
00:02:43.855 - 00:03:06.451, Speaker B: I Think at this point with CPI coming in a touch higher than expected because of housing, we are going to be at 25 bips and we'll start the cycle. The question is when do, when will they stop? I think we'll definitely get the next four meetings a 25 bit cut unless something crazy happens and we'll take it from there. So I think the main thing is going to be the election, guys.
00:03:06.563 - 00:03:22.577, Speaker A: And do, do you think 25 is enough? Like, do you think by going slowly and cutting slowly that's they could be doing too little, too late? I mean, we're seeing that unemployment slowly going up. Things are slowing down in the economy. Generally. The rate cuts are doing what they're supposed to do. Do you think 25 is too little?
00:03:22.721 - 00:03:52.801, Speaker B: Honestly, I would say it's fine. It's the right rate cut size and the right pace. I wouldn't mind if they make a accelerated mistake and heat up inflation again. I'm kind of prepared for the reheating of inflation. So if they want to do more aggressive cuts, I'm here for it. But realistically right now the economy is not in a terrible shape. The Japan situation is stable for now and I think this will be the right progress of rate cuts.
00:03:52.801 - 00:04:04.765, Speaker B: But let's look at the debate as well. I don't know if you guys watched all of it. I did sit through it. I wasn't sure if I was happy about it at the end that I watched it and I lost a few brain cells. Do you guys watch it?
00:04:05.065 - 00:04:39.279, Speaker A: I watched the whole thing live, obviously. I mean even right wing people agree that Kamala won. I think that was pretty clear. I think she was pretty skillful, whatever you think of her, in sort of baiting Trump down paths that were, let's say, a distraction from the key issues for people that are voting. And Polymarket has priced that in as well. So Trump had a 6% or so lead, 6 to 7% lead going into the debate and he lost that all during the debate. It was about tide, neck and neck, 49, 49, 50, 50.
00:04:39.279 - 00:05:01.655, Speaker A: And now you can see that Kamala has actually taken the lead. So I'm not going to, you know, medal, give myself a medal like Jordy did last week just yet. We have to sort of see how things unfold. But you know, if you guys remember, I said Trump has about a 45% chance of winning. Kamala has about a 55. I said it's all coming down to pa. Pa has now flipped back to somewhere in the middle.
00:05:01.655 - 00:05:22.719, Speaker A: You can see here it's gray, it's not blue, it's not red. And we'll see what happens. We'll see if Kamala can maintain this momentum. Obviously, this is probably bearish for our tokens because Trump has certainly been more friendly towards crypto from a regulatory standpoint, but we'll have to wait and see. I do think this trend will continue, especially if they do another, which sounds like they will.
00:05:22.767 - 00:05:46.313, Speaker B: I mean, for everyone who missed last week, Justin Bram is Philadelphia gcr. So he is the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania. So just as a reminder, he thinks that Nate Silver has it wrong. He thinks he's got the right odds, as he said. Look, like the debate, I wouldn't say was too bad. I think Trump was outnumbered.
00:05:46.313 - 00:05:54.321, Speaker B: We have this bold Leonidas cartoon here to illustrate how, you know, he got cooked, but he got cooked by like, you know, the moderator.
00:05:54.393 - 00:06:19.709, Speaker A: It was a three on one. Yeah, look, it was, it was totally biased. I don't know if the average person that's undecided is watching the debate and saying, well, it was a little unfair. They fact checked Trump four times and Kamala obviously lied as well and they didn't fact check her. I think the average person just saying, like, wow, she's like a very skilled prosecutor type and he's just going off the rails and he just seems angry. So we'll see. You know, Trump had some good moments.
00:06:19.709 - 00:06:27.155, Speaker A: She, she seemed very nervous at the start, but I think the consensus is that she, she definitely won and seemed more like, let's say, presidential on average.
00:06:27.655 - 00:06:51.455, Speaker C: I have a question for you, both of you. So I think it's pretty much consensus that, you know, Trump is more better for our coins than Kamala. But in a way, don't you think that the election, once it happens, it'll remove uncertainty because no matter who gets elected, like, it's going to take time for anything to happen. And crypto realistically is not really a priority for either of these candidates.
00:06:51.495 - 00:06:51.905, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:52.015 - 00:06:58.397, Speaker C: Uh, so do you think that the election could potentially just be a bullish event for crypto, or am I just a delusional bull?
00:06:58.501 - 00:07:23.583, Speaker B: I think it could be bullish. Either way, we did see that the debate went against Trump and we had a sell off. Initially we went from 58K down to like, you know, back to the 57, 56. And then later in the day just no one cared. You know, it's back to buying and it's not the end of the world. I think also, you know, the amount of impact of a debate is quite small. I think it was a 3%, 4% move.
00:07:23.583 - 00:08:10.405, Speaker B: But you know, all in all, it's not going to affect the outcome more than one out of 25 times, which is not a lot. I do think for the economy it's even more of a nothing burger. So look at Kamala. She will print money as well in terms of stocks. She might even be better for stocks and Trump because Trump is going to start the, the whole, you know, he loves the trade wars, he loves all this stuff. He's gonna start that stuff. So we're trapped by, I think Kamala might even be slightly better, assuming that she gives up all these insane ideas about unrealized gain taxes, which I don't even think that if she didn't like, I don't think there's a way to even implement that.
00:08:10.985 - 00:08:17.651, Speaker A: Well, they, it's a pretty in depth policy. If you read it. They have like a very in depth plan on how to actually make this happen. It's, it's pretty wild.
00:08:17.803 - 00:08:20.935, Speaker B: You know, let, let, let them try.
00:08:21.395 - 00:08:24.787, Speaker A: Well, you're not an American, so it doesn't affect you, but I, I, I.
00:08:24.811 - 00:08:42.435, Speaker B: Think like regardless, there's no way to really implement this kind of stuff. Right. Like this, this would be quite crazy. I do think for crypto it is influential. It'll, it will matter. I think, Justin, yours, you're probably agreeing that for our little corner of the world, like it or not, there will be a difference.
00:08:44.135 - 00:09:08.983, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. In the long term, I mean, I think like that night of the election, if Trump wins, maybe bitcoin goes up 5% and sort of trades into like nothing over the next week. And if Kamala wins, maybe bitcoin goes down 5%. So pretty insignificant. But over the course of four years, I mean, if we have Operation Chokepoint 3.0 with Kamala, I do think that could basically just, you know, continue to set the industry back even more. Right.
00:09:08.983 - 00:09:49.609, Speaker A: Like just imagine a world like, you know, it's like imagine the world if we could have tokens that represent, that are securities and that represent, you know, actual ownership over the company that do have the plan of driving value to token holders, if that's all allowed, if there's a framework to do it that's hugely beneficial and opens up the industry in a, in a big way. There's some skepticism over if Trump will actually do that or if he's just sort of all talk. Obviously we don't actually know. But I think like, objectively speaking, Trump is more, has more favorable views to crypto. And in the short term, sure, it's not going to be a big deal, but four years of very pro crypto regulations versus four years of very anti, I think do make a big difference.
00:09:49.777 - 00:10:04.813, Speaker B: Yep, yep. Let's bring up a few charts. I mean, it's been choppy as hell, but it has been holding up. I think the vibes probably bottomed out. Maybe not for Ethereum. I think still down on the day compared to Bitcoin being up. So we're.
00:10:04.929 - 00:10:07.945, Speaker A: This is an Ethereum free episode though, right? We agreed on it.
00:10:08.805 - 00:10:10.425, Speaker C: It's still our therapy hour.
00:10:10.845 - 00:10:49.799, Speaker B: Therapy hour. I think we're breaching that 04 level. So we're kind of just there now. BNB having. I don't know if it's a CZ premonition or what's going on, but it's up 8% of the week, which is the best performing coin as well with Pawn Coin, which, you know, Ton, I think is just slowly recovering from the initial shock of Durov. And so that was maybe to be expected. A little bit of a bounce back there, but there's still a lot of CT in fighting between the the Bulls and the Bears.
00:10:49.799 - 00:11:04.695, Speaker B: We have Thorn Cole here. He has been the leader of the Bear faction, I would say. And this dude just posts like every 30 minutes he just posts something bearish. He can't stop.
00:11:05.715 - 00:11:11.975, Speaker C: Dude, let's look at his, let's, let's look at his pin tweet. 44,000, the yearly open. I'm sorry.
00:11:13.275 - 00:11:50.431, Speaker B: Yeah, if you, if you check, he has been calling for much lower levels than anyone else. Look, is always a chance that we get liquidations there, but the game in my opinion is very different. I don't think we can see 44k sustainably just because of the amount of like inflows and money printing and sinful isolation. I would be surprised if we, if we get that low. He's calling for yearly lows breaking, basically. I don't know, I don't see it.
00:11:50.543 - 00:12:01.635, Speaker A: Yeah, Jordy, on that note, I saw this tweet you had posted that if you are bearish coins and you're holding USD, you're. You're actually long fiat. You're long dollars. Can you talk about what you meant by this tweet?
00:12:02.415 - 00:12:28.749, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically if you're trying to short like this coal guy and I'm telling him he's just going to get like a sack of coal for Christmas. If you're trying to short for prolonged periods of time for the whole year, you're starting getting affected by the debasement of Fiat. Currency. So, you know, estimates vary from, you know, 15, 20%. Who knows exactly what the basement rate is, depends on the exact policy. But you don't want to be just like structurally short.
00:12:28.749 - 00:12:58.915, Speaker B: You will have a problem. And I learned this the hard way. So in 2020, maybe we can. Let's bring up S P 500 during COVID years. So I was trading some, you know, discretionary macro book, doing quite well on the fixed income side. And then when Covid hit, we can see here 2020, S P had just been running up nonstop without any dips for like the last years. And it was at 3400, which was quite a high P ratio for the entire index.
00:12:58.915 - 00:13:44.901, Speaker B: And you can see that there is this sudden collapse where it went from 3400 to 2200 because of COVID of course, the whole world's stopping. So we see that this was at 36% drop, which is obviously like, yeah, that's huge for equities. But things were overvalued. So caught some of that got out and at that point the Fed cut rates to zero, started just debasing to an insane degree that we've never seen before. And I made a mistake. So when it bounced back around 2600. So from 2000 to 2600, there was a lot of talk, I don't know if people remember back then, there was a lot of talk about a double dip.
00:13:44.901 - 00:14:25.275, Speaker B: There was an expectation that there, you know, we would not just suddenly like V shape or cover. There would have to be a double dip. So I shorted 2600 and I just stared in disbelief every day as things just kept ticking up despite the whole world economy being stop. And thankfully I came to my senses once we hit, I said to myself, once we hit like 3100, at that point I was sure we would get like 4,000. Because it means the game has changed. It's not based on fundamentals economy P ratios anymore. It just means that, you know, the debasement has happened and we're, we're just playing a different game.
00:14:25.275 - 00:14:35.355, Speaker B: So thankfully I lost that 500 points and then I avoided losing. What you can clearly see here is a run up to 4,700 without a single dip.
00:14:37.335 - 00:15:18.045, Speaker A: Jordy, I'm curious, like, what's your take? So like since basically the middle of, you know, the stock market's up about 2x 2 and a half x depending on when you put the bottom at the currencies, you know, with according to CPI, like cumulative inflation since 2020 is, call it 25 to 35% somewhere around there. 30%. The market's well outperformed inflation. Do you think we're just a much more productive economy, we've got AI coming online, all of these things or you're laughing? I mean is, is it really just. Actually the dollar has just been debased and devalued and the inflation number, well that's accurate for the price of goods that they're tracking. It's not actually accurate for the debasement.
00:15:18.505 - 00:15:45.923, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I shouldn't be laughing because ultimately the reality is there's, there's theft happening and you know, we're on the right side of it. Probably everyone watching, you know, owns some assets and asset owners are the ones that are benefiting from this, the ones that are getting hurt that we're stealing from. In essence, their purchasing power are the lower classes that don't own any assets whatsoever. And you know when, when you see moves like this. No, we're not more productive.
00:15:46.099 - 00:15:48.855, Speaker A: Like it's not like AI 2x more productive.
00:15:49.195 - 00:15:53.539, Speaker B: Do you really think like AI has changed much yet? Like maybe. No, five years, but like hasn't.
00:15:53.587 - 00:16:22.455, Speaker A: So, but one thing I will say like a caveat to that is in this environment over the past four years the US has gotten relatively much stronger than the rest of the world. And I mean maybe that's a factor as well. So you've got 30% of this 2x according is accounted for by inflation, maybe 20% by the gains of the US relative to elsewhere. There's just no alternative to where, where to put your money. And then like this other 50% which is a huge amount from debasement. Do you think that could be true?
00:16:23.315 - 00:17:14.243, Speaker B: A little bit. The US dollar is the TradFi equivalent of bitcoin, where like when there's uncertainty, a lot of the other alts kind of flow into bitcoin. So we have that with the US dollar whenever there's uncertainty and we have been living in uncertain times. I think, look, the one positive thing I will say about the economy that is sustainable, and this is what I've been saying for years, is the one hope energy is cheaper right now for whatever reason oil is in the 60s. I think we can bring up an oil chart maybe if you want to bring up CL or Brent, this is something that does create a bit of a sustainable tailwind and it's good to see. I think, okay, so, so crude is $74. Obviously it's a multi year low here.
00:17:14.243 - 00:17:23.163, Speaker B: So this is, this is quite a positive situation for everybody who is not, you know, Qatar or a heavy exporter.
00:17:23.299 - 00:17:36.779, Speaker A: I've heard people say this can be a signal though that the economy's slowing down, people are just buying less and that's why the price is going down. Is, is there merit to that? People are driving less, traveling less, building less things, etc, etc or I think.
00:17:36.827 - 00:18:01.851, Speaker B: I think a little bit, but that's a second order effect. Do you want to bring up copper? Do you have copper? Yeah. So, you know, copper is a bit more of a industrial metal. There are still quite a lot of people buying copper here. We're not, we're not that far from, from the highs. So I do think that activity is still ongoing in the, the real economy. The last thing we should look at is gold and this one is always really interesting to look at.
00:18:01.851 - 00:18:39.543, Speaker B: Obviously it does go to show that there are buyers. I think the central banks are hedging their dollars with gold and a lot of central banks are preferring gold to dollars. Now this kind of thing can get. It looks like a banana zone. Right? Like you can start to get reflexive on things like gold and I expect that bitcoin will be continuing to be a macro asset in the same vein. Even if it's just like some guys like Drunken Miller and Paul Tudor that are putting on the spread, I do expect that we'll carry, carry that momentum.
00:18:39.639 - 00:19:04.775, Speaker A: And Jordy, I wanted to ask you. So people do talk about gold as like this hedge for currency debasement, but actually like, you know, we just looked at the numbers. The S and p is about 2x or more actually up from the COVID lows. And you can see here that gold's only 60% above the COVID lows. So do you really want to hold gold as your store of value or maybe even bitcoin to some extent or do you want to hold the S&P 500?
00:19:05.635 - 00:19:39.519, Speaker B: I think both are good. Gold and bitcoin are for more extreme situations rather than these like slow grinds. Therefore situations where people are actually worried that the, the way that the world operates might change and there, there will be a need for a different unit of measurement at that point. That can get very reflexive. Stocks can never get reflexive. There will never be like this mania of like, oh, I need to get some because I don't have some. Like no one will ever care that they don't have a little bit of, you know, Apple stock.
00:19:39.519 - 00:20:00.265, Speaker B: It's, it's not the end of the world. While if you are off sites when the world is starting to, let's Just take gold, because that's the, you know, the one that's closer. If that $17 trillion asset starts to become really central to how economies are operating and you don't have any exposure, then that can create a banana effect.
00:20:00.425 - 00:20:35.239, Speaker C: Yeah. And speaking of reflexivity and I guess going back to crypto, you know, obviously the vibes are down bad. Vitalik is tweeting more often than ever. But as we approach Q4, I feel like it kind of reminds me of Q4, 2020, when Bitcoin was going up. Alts were just getting wrecked. People were calling for altcoins will never pump again. Do you think we're kind of repeating the same cycle in terms of human psychology, where now people just think that everything is vaporware, it's only bitcoin, even eth is shit coin.
00:20:35.239 - 00:20:45.195, Speaker C: Do you think things can happen right, where if certain alts start to go up, people are like, oh, my God, we have to buy. And then that can also cause some reflux of cycle?
00:20:45.295 - 00:21:11.917, Speaker B: I don't think it's anything like 2020, even Q4. Yeah. So right after defi summer, I think there was a little bit of a lull. And then of course, like 21, I was a little bit worried because I saw that every single coin was outperforming bitcoin, even, like complete junk was. Was like outperforming by 5x. So I think that was nothing like what we're seeing now. What we're seeing now is that basically bitcoin has a product market fit, a macro asset.
00:21:11.917 - 00:21:22.853, Speaker B: We're. We're living in a very, like, volatile macro period. So it has a point. I have been thinking about this a lot. I. I brought this up last week. We have a big problem with alts.
00:21:22.853 - 00:22:25.335, Speaker B: I've been reflecting more. I think the problem actually is, and no one has touched on this, there is a misallocation of resources happening. And a lot of it's driven that. We don't have a consensus as to, you know, where should capital go? Where should resources go? What should the builders be building? Where should the money be flowing? We're lacking a clear, let's call it like an academic framework of, like, what is, what's valuable? What's the market cap? What's an fpv? How should these things be treated? How do we look at, like, revenues? What's the P ratios we should be looking at? Nobody has any clue whatsoever. There's a few people with, like, nibbles of pieces of things. But as a community, as like an investor group, and I talked about like the entire investor group that buys crypto and is willing to invest in coins. There is very little consensus or understanding of how we should value these things.
00:22:25.335 - 00:23:05.105, Speaker B: And I think that's what's sorely lacking. And the good thing about stocks is that you have simple nice products like S&P 500. It allows every like random middle income person to just get a reasonable allocation in a capitally non destructive way where they're just buying a tiny bit of the biggest 500 companies and getting exposure. You cannot do that in crypto. If you try to do that with like the top 100 coins, you know, you'll, you'll have your ETHs and then you'll also have your not as good coins. I don't want to talk any coins right now. I don't want to go to war right now.
00:23:05.105 - 00:23:06.669, Speaker B: But you guys get my point.
00:23:06.717 - 00:23:39.095, Speaker A: It's obvious though, right? It is interesting. The top 100 tokens, to your point, if you just were to scroll through coingecko, I don't know if it's 75%, 80%, 60%, but probably the majority are what we would consider. Some are scams, just outright scams. Some are money grabs, some have no utility and no usage and are just valued there for like memetic purposes. It is true. There's no like reliable, you know, way to hold a basket of this asset. And there's no clear valuation framework to your point.
00:23:39.095 - 00:24:06.909, Speaker A: I mean I remember if you guys remember the Defi Pulse Index. I remember when this came out it was an aggregator of the top defi tokens. And it's interesting because these are still the top projects in defi that the Defi Pulse index holds. It holds things like uni Ave, compound, etc. Etc. Like the top quote unquote blue chip defi projects. And obviously there's a few select winners like, but generally this thing is down only even though these are still like the best products we have in this space.
00:24:06.909 - 00:24:34.439, Speaker A: So I totally agree. There's. There is a weird thing that happens in our space where the most valuable projects aren't valued as the most valuable projects. And Jordi, I think this goes in line with your thesis from last week that we've talked about before of like you've got your product and that can have your product product market fit and then you have your token and that can have token market fit and the two are completely separate. You can have a great product and a bad token or you can have no product and a great token. And I think that's part of the problem too, to your point.
00:24:34.607 - 00:24:34.951, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:34.983 - 00:24:37.679, Speaker C: So you're saying that I think the industry needs to self correct.
00:24:37.767 - 00:24:38.015, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:38.055 - 00:24:44.991, Speaker C: And capital needs to allocate to the good quality coins and then things kind of have to make sense because right now things don't make sense.
00:24:45.103 - 00:25:22.641, Speaker A: But to be clear, it's not the, in my, in my view this isn't the industry's fault. This is a fault of lack of proper regulation. If we had the ability to drive value to tokens in a clear and legal way and the US was not clamping down on going after tokens like Uni which are quite decentralized and still doesn't direct value to holders, if they were actually supporting these efforts and saying, you know unis swap can be an equity, the token can be an equity and it can be a security and you can buy it and hope you're investing in something that will deliver you value. I think the problem is regulation and lack thereof as opposed to like founders and investors not knowing what to buy and sell.
00:25:22.833 - 00:25:39.345, Speaker B: I've heard that. Take I, I, I, I like I think there's elements of truth to it and yes, like if you can just comfortably start making a value accruing token, you can start designing better things. Even if we had that, we would still be lost in the fog of.
00:25:39.385 - 00:26:24.445, Speaker A: War on the piece of regulation though. Jordy, I do think a lot of this really more comes down to regulation than we think. And the last example I'll give is what if when you bought the uni token you weren't buying control over some fee switch, you were actually buying a share in what the Uniswap, this multi hundred person team does in New York and what they're building next and you're you know, buying equity in the uniswap wallet in iOS, you're buying equity in their front end fee, you're buying equity in everything that they're working on in the future. I think to me that investment thesis is much more clear and the Uniswap token would be much more valuable and as a result of that the best companies that you could invest in would perform better and there would be like a true way to value these projects.
00:26:24.905 - 00:27:09.923, Speaker C: Can I also step in there? So I hear you guys right? There's not enough regulation. If the Democrats get elected president then there can be no fee switch. But that's actually incorrect, right? Like maker did a buyback last year, AAVE introduced a P switch or about to introduce a P switch. And then even earlier this year Uniswap foundation, they tried to turn on a fee switch. Ultimately this did get shut down by Andreessen Horowitz, but at the time, uniswap pumped like 2x whenever this proposal got posted. And that told me that the market will clearly bid uni once there is some task towards value growth. And you know, going back to what Jordy said, you know, this would make sense, right? Like if there's value for uni, like this thing is going to send but the final Boss is the SEC and a 16Z but.
00:27:10.099 - 00:27:41.353, Speaker A: So I agree with you. I think that's all true. But I think one big thing you're missing is there's actually like a fight between and it's not a real fight, but there's a fight between uni token holders and uni equity holders. The two actually have misaligned incentives. The the more uni token can take a fee and the more on chain fees can be accrued, the less the Uniswap foundation or the Uniswap company, the Labs company can turn on the fee switch on the front end. We were actually just looking at this. The fee on Uniswap front end is like 15 to 25 basis points, which is quite large.
00:27:41.353 - 00:28:00.245, Speaker A: Right. And the second that Uniswap fee goes on at the protocol lever, you would think at the protocol level, you would think the Uniswap Labs fee goes down. So there's this weird problem where Labs equity holders and token holders actually have the opposite incentives. Here the Labs equity holders want as little value to the token holders and vice versa.
00:28:01.065 - 00:28:45.085, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I definitely understand that. That's definitely a counterargument. But last month Andreessen Horowitz, who is one of the biggest VCs in the Dinosaup, literally put out this blog article on how to drive cash flows for APP tokens in a compliant way. And the way they did it is or the three ways is to allow staking for certain jurisdictions. So maybe if there is staking for or whatever fees that gets generated in let's say the Asian front end, you can stake your unique with the Asian front end and that would be very compliant. That doesn't sound practical, but that's one way they talked about applying a token or applying a fee switch. And in terms of regulation, I do think that there is things happening behind the scenes that will allow for a fee switch.
00:28:45.085 - 00:29:22.955, Speaker C: So for example, Miles Jennings here at the bottom, they say that that's why A16Z, they suggest that they should consider the Duna standard. And I looked into this and this was also opposed by a 16Z. But this came into effect July 1st of 2024. And if you just go through the post year, Dunas are a nonprofit legal entity. But through the Duna legal entity, you can actually pay people for voting. And this can be in the form of a fee switch. And they also say that using this entity form you can actually argue against the how we test.
00:29:22.955 - 00:30:02.601, Speaker C: And know these tokens wouldn't be a Security. And A16Z plans to basically help their portfolio companies in the US adopt the Duna standard. And I also listened to a podcast where async or a 16z guys like working on this reading Swap. So don't you think that, you know, there is a path for a fee switch? Because they also talked about, you know, creating an app chain. And don't you think this would also align incentives where you can stake unique for an app chain or an L2 and then the unisoft front end can charge the front end fee. But uni also becomes like a staking token and then you can capture the transaction fee, mev, et cetera. I feel like that's one way that they can do this.
00:30:02.601 - 00:30:20.565, Speaker C: And coming from a 16Z, I do think that we should be watching this because a 16Z is like final boss when it comes to turning on the V switch. And they're literally telling us that there's two ways to do it. You can, you know, block certain jurisdictions or create an app chain. Don't you think that, you know, people are ignoring this, or am I just kind of delusional here?
00:30:20.725 - 00:30:55.909, Speaker A: I mean, I think you're right and those things will and can drive value. But I think the, the problem is all of these solutions are a form of regulatory arbitrage or basically like trying to skirt the regulations and go through an like an inefficient system like it. And I think that you can add value even though we're sort of like handcuffed by the regulations, like we've seen that happen before. But I still think the best solution is proper regulations to where we don't have to play these silly games. Right? And it can be a token that actually is considered a security under the Howie test. And that's actually a good thing. As it should be.
00:30:55.909 - 00:31:03.309, Speaker A: You should be buying the uni token to bet on the uni team delivering value to the uni token. That's like exactly how it should work in my mind.
00:31:03.477 - 00:31:51.149, Speaker B: Well, I mean, at the end of the day, there might be a few tokens that could be quite improved, but they are far and few between and there are teams outside the US that don't anyways care about this stuff. There's anonymous teams building in Asia that are very happy to give their tokens all the utility that they can. Doesn't mean that there is enough sustainable cash flow there. So as we talk about when there is a lack of understanding or certainty and there's this fog of war, people get very antsy. The vibes are deteriorating and it looks like Vitalik is feeling the pressure. He has come out of the woodwork we see here. Number of tweets per month started at 13, 20, 23 and first half of the year was 44 per month.
00:31:51.149 - 00:32:16.085, Speaker B: He is on fire 158 for August. That is insane. Let's look at some of the amazing things he's been responding to because I see him everywhere every time I open this app. Cannot believe the stuff that's going on. We have Khan here saying this is the real insight of Vitalik coming out. He never used to comment about this random posts. And that's true.
00:32:16.085 - 00:32:50.273, Speaker B: Scroll up. He's telling people like I don't even know or care who you are. And he's responding to them saying somebody called him a dick and he's like, no, this is a dick. It's a star instead of the I or you. You know, he seems to be trying. He's put posting all his bulls, AI bulls and all this stuff.
00:32:50.449 - 00:33:10.919, Speaker A: And. And then he had this other. This other one where we. I think we had talked about Vitalik or not Vitalik sales, but the EF sales not being telegraphed. And you can see someone, you know, like disinterested in Vitalik saying like, I'm only going to talk about L2s that are stage one plus that are like somewhat decentralized. And then bizarre. Nachi said, fair.
00:33:10.919 - 00:33:33.325, Speaker A: Just stop selling. And Vitalik's actually here like defending his sale, the sale from yesterday by. By a biodefense group, I find. I think that is his Covid stuff was triggered by an automatic cow swap to that was set way back in August 29th. That was the last one. And I do think it's a little absurd here that defending his eth sales like directly on Twitter. It's.
00:33:33.325 - 00:33:36.373, Speaker A: It's kind of funny how much things have changed in the last month though.
00:33:36.509 - 00:33:50.131, Speaker C: And if you scroll down, there's a comment that's like, say that you dislike Kim Jong Un right now. I guess it's like a way to prove that he's not. I mean, I don't even know like why this is even a question. And he's like, oh, yes, okay, we're all good then.
00:33:50.163 - 00:34:22.030, Speaker B: He's responding to everything, right? Like, I think that he's not getting the vibes. He's not understanding the community sentiment. He's trying, you know, in his own way to try to respond. But this, this tweet you just read out Justin for me is so tone deaf, it's hard to believe someone's saying like, please stop dumping on us. And he's saying, well, I'm funding a biodefense fund and they need to tee up my cow swap order.
00:34:22.222 - 00:34:30.434, Speaker A: And it's all like Covid stuff, by the way, that he had committed to and was obsessed about in 2020 and 2021. It's like, it's just not that compelling.
00:34:30.774 - 00:35:20.919, Speaker B: And then like last one, last, last little Vitalik, like nudge here. But if you look at the tweet that he, like he posted above, he did say that from next year, he's no longer going to mention any L2 in any blog post or talk. If it is not a stage one plus L2, he's like threatening to like not mention you on his talk. So this brings us to our bigger topic for today, which is again, we have this decentralized tech as a human species. No one's gonna understand everything. We have people that are very good at left side of the brain, right side of the brain, social versus technical. Vitalik is clearly like, you know, incredible technical cryptography person and he's built something amazing.
00:35:20.919 - 00:35:38.355, Speaker B: Are we going to kind of have a leader that we're following and it's like a country and we're just like listening to what he thinks a L2 should be based on the stages that he set. Or are we just going to take this as decentralized tech and then people will just decide for themselves?
00:35:38.805 - 00:35:49.893, Speaker A: I mean, that discussion is very important and all well and good, but like to your point, it is just so out of touch with like what the community cares about right now and how value is being delivered to the community right now.
00:35:49.989 - 00:36:18.845, Speaker B: You know, in this time of crisis where eth BTC is hitting multi year lows, Vitalik is posting that he take this seriously. He will not mention in blog posts or talks if you're a stage one L2, he will not. He'll pretend you don't exist. And he's very serious. And it just reminded me of this boomer Al Gore on South park where he's talking about manbear pig and you know, he's talking about manbearpig and he's super serial. We have the clip here.
00:36:19.505 - 00:36:24.307, Speaker C: ManBearPig isn't real. Well, I'm here to tell you now.
00:36:24.404 - 00:36:28.753, Speaker A: ManBearPig is very real and he most certainly exists.
00:36:28.929 - 00:36:30.361, Speaker C: I'm serial.
00:36:30.553 - 00:36:39.545, Speaker A: ManBearPig doesn't care who you are or what you've done, ManBearPig simply wants to get you. I'm super serial.
00:36:42.245 - 00:36:46.253, Speaker B: So, you know, this is the vibe I'm getting, but I think Vitalik is.
00:36:46.269 - 00:37:08.975, Speaker C: Starting to get it right. I mean, you can see it from the number of tweets. And I actually got invited to hang out with Vitalik and some divu founders. I don't even know how I got invited to this, but maybe the Eve people are trying to. They want, like a left curve slash, mid curve, like me to figure out community outreach. Yeah, community outreach. You know, like Ty, like, how do we talk to mid curves like you? Maybe.
00:37:08.975 - 00:37:12.151, Speaker C: Maybe, like, that's. That's my role. So I'll try. I'll try to help.
00:37:12.263 - 00:37:15.015, Speaker A: Well, make sure to invite Vitalik on. Steady, lads.
00:37:15.095 - 00:37:16.631, Speaker C: I'll plug it in. I'll plug it in.
00:37:16.743 - 00:37:17.263, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah.
00:37:17.319 - 00:37:26.115, Speaker B: I mean, you're. You're the Defi champion, Taiki. Like, all the other YouTubers are shilling, you know, random stuff and you still going hard on Aave. Yeah.
00:37:26.655 - 00:37:31.847, Speaker A: Wait, but Taiki, do you have, like, some topics you want to bring up? Like, what are you going to say to Vitalik?
00:37:31.991 - 00:38:03.409, Speaker C: I don't. I don't know what the agenda is, so it's hard for me to say, but it's going to be just me, like, Stani, I think Kane's going to be there. So I think it's just going to be like, maybe a discussion on where defi is, where eth is, what people care about. Because if you think, like, maybe last month Vitalik had that tweet storm around, you know, like, he wants other stuff then, like, other things other than Defi to be built. Right. So maybe, you know, Vitalik wants to know, okay, like, what does the community actually think? And maybe he can start bullet posting Defi at some point. I don't know.
00:38:03.497 - 00:38:24.179, Speaker A: It's not just about bull posting, though, to be clear. Right, Tyche, it's like, actually about, like, supporting these teams, funding research from the EF level and DeFi, like, I actually think the bull posting is, like, the least exciting piece of it. I couldn't care less if Vitalik is, like, tweeting, know, at the level that Anatoli from Solana is like, it's actually like the actions are more important, in my opinion.
00:38:24.307 - 00:38:48.077, Speaker B: I mean, if. If Vitalik and Yev at this point just got teleported to Mars and, And we're setting up like some new society and we lost them here, I think we would still be in a good. Maybe like in a better spot for Ethereum, because at that point it would. It would have this Bitcoin vibe, you know, where there's. It's a leaderless community that can. Can just like function without the politics. Maybe.
00:38:48.077 - 00:39:17.675, Speaker B: But all in all, I think this is a constructive period where the discovery of the next direction to go is going to be found. We're seeing Kyle so money on bankless and everyone hearing that and having opinions. We had this interesting tweet from Ryan Watkins. He has a few thoughts. He thinks we still don't have enough block space. I don't know about that. He says it's not fungible.
00:39:17.675 - 00:39:54.455, Speaker B: Like L1 block space is not fungible. I think everybody understands and agrees that we're still not in that fungible point. And this one I do agree with part three. He says value capture will increasingly be monetary driven. He thinks that applications will start capturing more mev. This is quite interesting, the Somani thesis that chains are only as valuable as their MEV and that's the way to measure them. I think this is presenting more of the future that I expect, which is that applications will be able to capture mev.
00:39:54.455 - 00:40:26.641, Speaker B: And I think what this starts to create as a question is how do you value the Layer one token? We've talked about this many times for Solana Ethereum. Ryan's second tweet here says that he thinks the only way any of this is sustainable is if the layer 1 tokens are money. So not just Bitcoin or ETH, but basically like any layer 1, the base token needs to be money in order for sustainability to exist.
00:40:26.793 - 00:40:46.505, Speaker C: I think the point three by Ryan is assuming that maybe there's going to be more app chains, right, where maybe uni becomes a chain. AAVE has its own chain, it captures the mev, but then as a result ETH captures less mev and then perhaps the apps become more valuable relative to eth. Do you think that's possible as well?
00:40:47.205 - 00:41:11.997, Speaker B: Well, he's taking it even a step further. He's saying even the apps won't be able to keep it, they'll have to give it back to the users, because even apps are fungible. So, like, ultimately MEV will not really exist. It will go back to. To the users. To quite a large extent, as will gas. So, like, basically the users will get a very good experience and all that matters is going to be base money.
00:41:11.997 - 00:41:39.665, Speaker B: And of course, we've seen Ethereum people say that L2s are not a bad thing because they're increasing the meme of eth as. As money. So it's an interesting thesis. So I'm sure we'll revisit the topic of resource misallocation in crypto in future episodes as we try to chew through this. But let's go to Pasta of the Week, guys. I got a couple good ones. Maybe, Justin, you want to kick off?
00:41:40.085 - 00:42:14.161, Speaker A: Yeah, I like my pasta. My pasta is community driven. So, you know, we talked about Nate Silver being a little off here, the Poly Market model being off, and the Justin brand model, the Pennsylvania model being the real canonical model you should be following. And I think people are starting to sort of wake up to that, which, you know, to be expected. I'm not going to pat myself on the back too much, but we're actually seeing a lot of people on Twitter now, like, you know, going after Nate Silver and saying, look, Nate, your model's off. Like, you need to follow the Justin Brown Steady Lads official model. And so shout out to the Gopher here.
00:42:14.161 - 00:42:39.349, Speaker A: Nate Silver posted on September 8, Big piece about the campaign, the mistakes of 2019 and what could cost Harris the election this year. And the governor says, you don't address Justin C. Brown's disagreement with your model or include the data from his model in your. In yours. Till you do, I can't take you seriously. I'll stick with Xerox Steady Lads. And you can see even Jordy is singing the Gopher's praise.
00:42:39.349 - 00:42:53.591, Speaker A: So I. I appreciate you, Gopher. And, you know, keep tweeting at Nate Silver. I'm sure he'll get it someday. I'm sure he'll update his model. And, you know, I just want this election to be, you know, properly calculated and weighted by the market. So Poly Markets getting there.
00:42:53.591 - 00:42:57.271, Speaker A: It's time for Nate Silver and his group to sort of come along.
00:42:57.423 - 00:43:05.999, Speaker C: I just find it funny that he misspelled your Twitter profile. Just C. Brown. Sorry.
00:43:06.047 - 00:43:12.795, Speaker A: Well, look, the sentiment is right, right? Like, the sentiment is correct. Steady Labs was properly tagged and I think this is correct.
00:43:13.225 - 00:43:23.737, Speaker B: Yeah. And the one, like, shows that it's a tsunami of people that are saying about your model. So it's true.
00:43:23.881 - 00:43:25.561, Speaker A: Was that your like, Jordy?
00:43:25.753 - 00:43:28.401, Speaker B: I think it was my like. I think it's you now, so.
00:43:28.473 - 00:43:33.925, Speaker A: Well, Steady Lads fans, show your support. Here to the steady lads. Official model for the election.
00:43:35.265 - 00:43:38.289, Speaker B: I'm not a part of this model. It's Justin Brown.
00:43:38.337 - 00:43:40.257, Speaker A: It's just Taiki and I. You're right.
00:43:40.441 - 00:43:41.845, Speaker C: Don't involve me in this.
00:43:44.065 - 00:43:46.805, Speaker B: All right, so, thank you. How about you? What do you got?
00:43:47.145 - 00:44:14.993, Speaker C: Yeah, so as you mentioned, Jordy, I've been the DeFi GCR, the mid curve GCR or whatever you want to call it. I've had so much PTSD holding DeFi coins in 2022, 2023. It's been horrible. But I'm ready to just forget all that PTSD and I'm ready to dive back in. So buying DFI 1.0 again, it's kind of like this girl who lost her memory, falls in love with the same boyfriend. Talk about a story of true love.
00:44:14.993 - 00:44:17.201, Speaker C: Me and Defi. True love, baby.
00:44:17.313 - 00:44:18.925, Speaker A: It's 50 first dates.
00:44:20.345 - 00:44:20.817, Speaker B: Yes.
00:44:20.881 - 00:44:25.601, Speaker C: I'll never leave. I will continue to buy Defi coins until I run out of money.
00:44:25.713 - 00:44:50.615, Speaker B: It's very good. Very fitting. So I have a tweet pasta and also we have little puff update. So I'll give that first. So we have two cool things going on. One, we have a uniswap mainnet pool now. So Puff is not only in mantle now, I think we're going to see the effect of having a token on multiple chains.
00:44:50.615 - 00:44:59.667, Speaker B: It was wrapped using layer 0's of T. And there is a meth puff pool on Mainnet now.
00:44:59.851 - 00:45:08.305, Speaker A: But, Jordy, you got to be honest with our listeners here. I mean, our friend Jared from Subway made an appearance, right, and took $1,000 from you, is that right?
00:45:09.085 - 00:45:33.713, Speaker B: Well, we were checking the on chain transactions after the deployment on the uniswap pool. And Jared from Subway, man, you can't get away from him in the dark forest. He just appears out of nowhere. You just try to initiate the pool and deploy capital. He made half an eth by arbing the pool against itself. So it's not safe out there, guys. It's not safe from Jared.
00:45:33.909 - 00:45:58.313, Speaker A: Yeah. So we were actually watching this happen live, and I saw Jared from Subways ENS here, and looks like he bought 24 ETH worth of puff and then a second later sold it for 25 and a half eth, which is so interesting. I mean, it was just crazy to watch this live and see Jared from Subway. He was the first transaction on the pool too. So, I mean, this bot just really knows what it's doing.
00:45:58.409 - 00:46:00.205, Speaker B: It is dangerous out there, guys.
00:46:00.945 - 00:46:01.965, Speaker A: Stay safe.
00:46:02.465 - 00:46:23.925, Speaker B: Applications will have to protect us. Protect us. Stay sifu. So we do have a little clip from the new episode of Puff in the Dark Forest as he and us are learning about the dangers in the dark forest. Maybe let's play a little clip of it. You walk in on this, bro.
00:46:24.985 - 00:46:41.975, Speaker A: No, don't do that. You're killing them. Those meth crystals, huh? That's how I do it.
00:46:44.475 - 00:46:45.855, Speaker B: Oh, that crystal.
00:46:48.715 - 00:46:52.865, Speaker A: This is high production quality, Jordy. I mean, this is like a Pixar movie.
00:46:53.035 - 00:47:11.269, Speaker B: You know, we talked about this. Like, you got to build a brand and you need the highest quality materials to make your Prada bags. So this is. This is what's going on. People can check it out on the. On the Puff Twitter if they want to see the full video. My pasta of the week, just to wrap up if we can bring it up here.
00:47:11.269 - 00:47:38.275, Speaker B: You know, people are adding more and more complication. There's more and more versions of staking, restaking and vaults. So yield farming. Who is following all this religiously? He has a. May I interest you in ether phi7c's use d usde USD0 vault in mitosis restake symbiotic re restaked by our receipt token to crack yt7.
00:47:38.895 - 00:47:43.487, Speaker A: Is this probably real too, right? Wait, it's real.

00:48:00.325 - 00:48:01.745, Speaker B: What's going on?
00:48:02.285 - 00:48:09.625, Speaker C: I know. And probably with all this additional smart contract risk, you'll probably get like a 10% APY for dollars.
00:48:10.455 - 00:48:47.541, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the reality is, like, you start creating more and more new tokens, and if they're worth something above zero, then you just stack them on top of each other until you get some 10% yield. And here you go. Here it is. The good thing is we do have something like Pendle, which will, at the end of the day, simplify the entire stack into just like a single number in the pt. So you can at least get a simple experience if you want as well. All right, guys, well, vote for your favorite pasta of the week on our Twitter. We'll have the poll out soon and hopefully see a lot of you in Singapore.
00:48:47.541 - 00:48:55.345, Speaker B: I think the live event and the and the drinks will be a good opportunity to catch some of you in person. So till then, take care.
