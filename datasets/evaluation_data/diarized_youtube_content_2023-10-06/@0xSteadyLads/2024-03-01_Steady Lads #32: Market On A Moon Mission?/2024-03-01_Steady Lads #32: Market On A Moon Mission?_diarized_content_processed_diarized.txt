00:00:23.360 - 00:00:53.076, Speaker A: All right, welcome, everybody, to another episode of Steady Lads. We're going live this week, and I think it's appropriate because the market is, it's just shifting under our feet. Like, I think if we filmed two days ago, the next day would be, like, different. You know, we'd be talking about how the market's nuking and then, you know, by the time the episode comes out, it'll be 80k. So thanks for joining us. I have to begin with, please like and subscribe. Our editor has politely asked if we can kick off there, and that would help us a lot.
00:00:53.076 - 00:01:36.286, Speaker A: We're getting the five K subscribers, so thank you, four. Okay, thank you once again. I'm Jordy. I'm the founder of Selena Capital, and we have our full crew this week. So we have Taiki, the humble farmer and researcher at HFA, double hatted. Tonight we have Justin with us, the CEO of Astaria and tryer of all kinds of devices and phone, and I think he's with us. So we have the expert trader here to tell us what to, what's long and short in this, like, very exciting, volatile market.
00:01:36.286 - 00:01:57.574, Speaker A: So, oh, people are going to start about White City. All right. It's going to be a fun episode. We got a lot of active chat here. Let's kick off a little bit with what's going on. I mean, this is the first conference in a while that maybe not the first. I think Solana breakpoint kind of started off, and now ETH Denver is, is raising the bar where, you know, we're not getting the conference.
00:01:57.574 - 00:02:00.394, Speaker A: Nuke. How's things going on in Denver, Justin?
00:02:01.014 - 00:02:18.394, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. I've gone to Denver for the past three years. It's always a fun event. There's always, you know, a ton of people, and it's really warm now, which is nice. It's in the sixties. Definitely a different crowd than we saw last year, I'll say that. And definitely a lot busier from what I can see.
00:02:18.394 - 00:02:58.094, Speaker B: So just anecdotally, last night I went out to dinner with one of our investors at Astaria, had an amazing time, and got to hear about what everyone's been pitching these days, which was interesting. It looks like a ton of teams are raising, a lot of stuff happening in the intense space. And then I tried to go with some team members to a party, but the line was probably, and this is not an exaggeration, 400 people long for the sort of main party of the night. And it's definitely a different crowd. You're seeing more of the NFT style crowd, I'll say that we saw two years ago coming back. So a lot of FOMO, a lot of people euphoric and pretty good vibes all around, but very busy.
00:02:58.594 - 00:03:12.054, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it is so busy. The markets are so busy, I can't even imagine being at a conference right now. I'm happy I skipped Denver because just there's so much going on. I'm sure. Thicke, have you been sleeping or are you just, like, pulling on? Like, what is. What is going on with you? Are you going hard?
00:03:13.814 - 00:03:17.062, Speaker C: I haven't sleeping enough. All right.
00:03:17.198 - 00:03:17.654, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:17.734 - 00:03:18.550, Speaker C: Okay.
00:03:18.742 - 00:03:19.914, Speaker A: Pacing yourself?
00:03:21.094 - 00:03:30.350, Speaker D: Yeah. I feel like now it's like I go to bed thinking about the markets, then I wake up thinking about the markets, and I can never escape this cycle of.
00:03:30.462 - 00:03:34.794, Speaker B: But was that ever not? That was true in the bear market, too, right?
00:03:35.334 - 00:03:35.686, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:35.710 - 00:03:50.094, Speaker D: But now I'm like, okay, like, in the bear market, it's like, oh, my God. Like, what am I doing in this space? And then now it's like, oh, my God. Like, I feel so underexposed, even though I'm so, so long. Do you guys feel that way, too? It's like a reflexive asset.
00:03:50.554 - 00:04:03.266, Speaker B: I had a goal in mind of how much ETH I wanted to accumulate in the bear market, and I hit that within 10%, let's say. And it still does, you know, it never feels like enough. Right? Yeah, exactly. I should have. Should have bought more.
00:04:03.330 - 00:04:20.470, Speaker A: But it is what it is, is what it is. Let's catch up since last week. So first, like, you know, let's recap. Obviously, we had an interesting episode. We had Suzu. He's kind of doing the rounds now, but we got him on for the lads. I think we, we asked a lot of direct questions.
00:04:20.470 - 00:04:44.524, Speaker A: I don't think we fucked around. Like, sorry, we were live. We went pretty straight at it. And I'm pretty happy of the work that we did, you know, getting into some of the truths and getting some of the thoughts there. So, you know, we know it was a controversial guess, but I think it turned out really well. And, yeah, we're happy to have Danielle and any kind of interesting characters. Like, we have Andrei Grachev as well in the future.
00:04:44.524 - 00:04:51.324, Speaker A: Justin, any special guests? I think you want?
00:04:52.584 - 00:05:05.726, Speaker B: I want Charles Hodgkinson's. But I also think once SPF gets sentenced, like, how cool would it be if we sort of flew to whatever prison he's at and interviewed him in the. In prison? I think that would be really special.
00:05:05.790 - 00:05:06.190, Speaker C: I would.
00:05:06.262 - 00:05:09.554, Speaker B: I'm honestly unironically going to see if something like that is even possible.
00:05:10.814 - 00:05:49.694, Speaker A: Okay, I'm going to skip the prison visit, but if you want to go and hook it up, then I'll join. I'll join by video. Yeah, so I mean, obviously like there's been a massive run up. And I think the main thing to point out is that the game has sort of like been changed by the ETF's at this point. You had a nice meme, Justin, we can maybe bring up, but we have obviously surprised the upside. And I mean, thinking you've been following the ETF's pretty closely, is this level of inflows, was this like within like two standard deviations or are we just like really outside of what was expected?
00:05:51.114 - 00:06:30.368, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it was. We saw like Blackrock dollar. 600 million a day for this entire week. It definitely changes the math of where bitcoin will settle. I've been thinking about this a lot this week, but just to keep it brief, if we have 15 billion of inflows this year for the rest of the year, we already have seven. And there's around 200,000 coins that needs to be sold this year, distributed amongst mining supply, Gox and the US gov and maybe like the german gov as well. And it works out to around 75k settling price for bitcoin.
00:06:30.368 - 00:06:46.804, Speaker C: But it's a very sensitive number because it's averaging 220 right now. So it does that for the rest of the year. That's what, like 45 billion. And then we get to like a 200k number for bitcoin settles. So there's a wide range of where it settles depending on how these flows sort of shake out.
00:06:48.624 - 00:07:22.984, Speaker A: It's really wild, you know, I had to like buy some bitcoin. I just, I feel like when I see this kind of chart that I, I couldn't buy during the run up, just psychologically I feel like, um, I don't like buying a chart at the top. I know, uh, you know, mister one chair just says he's going to buy the top forever. I feel like I prefer buying dips. It's just like psychologically for me, it feels better. So we had this like massive dip from 65 to 60 or 59, and I finally got an entry point. I just loaded up there.
00:07:22.984 - 00:07:44.764, Speaker A: I'm happy with seeing where this ETF flows go. Obviously I've been bullish ETH and I've been publicly pronouncing and long ETH, BTc long ETH remain long ETH. But I think it's good to play a little bit of the BTC game just in case those inflows keep coming. Right now it feels like the risk reward is very healthy. On the upside.
00:07:45.244 - 00:08:35.826, Speaker B: Jordy, I actually, I was going to save this as a pasta, but I have so many pastas prepared. I'm going to let it rip now and get your thoughts on this. Sort of sneak a second one in. But I was thinking about this too, and talking to Taki and Vicki a little bit about this before the show last night in my Uber home from the hotel, I was thinking, you know, it is a little sad that Ethan BTC have already experienced the majority of their move from the bottom. You know, like bitcoin going from fifteen k to sixty k. Almost a forex, right? And bitcoin could forex from here in the long run, but going to 240, this bull run seems above anyone's wildest expectations. What are your thoughts on that? Does that make you sad at all or does it just mean you have to go further out on the risk curve? I thought this tweet was funny because it's sort of like, you know, this person saying, if bitcoin even goes to 122k, I'm only going to double my money.
00:08:35.826 - 00:08:37.774, Speaker B: I'm only going to make $1,000.
00:08:38.604 - 00:09:18.240, Speaker A: I mean, as you, as you deal with like a large asset class, you know, is s and p going to go to 10,000? You know, it's like 5000. Is it, is it going to double? It will, but like, you know, how many years is that going to take? And, you know, that's, that's not going to make anybody rich either, mister user 243987. So tick tock. Yeah, you know, look, I do expect a lot of people will be just gambling now, trying to get, you know, multiples. I think we're seeing that already with the meme coin mania. So meme coins are back, especially the big ones. Surprisingly so.
00:09:18.240 - 00:09:43.532, Speaker A: I've seen dog coins rip back, even dogecoin for the first time this cycle has. I think it put in a 30% day yesterday. So we are expecting that retail is looking healthier. The Coinbase app is something that all my telegram chats are tracking quite closely. And it's like 300. Today we're like 212. Now we're like 156.
00:09:43.588 - 00:09:44.004, Speaker B: Let's go.
00:09:44.044 - 00:09:49.196, Speaker A: Like everyone's tracking the Coinbase app. Yeah, I don't know, just.
00:09:49.220 - 00:10:13.272, Speaker D: And if you share my screen, I have the Coinbase app rankings, some 420 to 340. I mean, this is parabolic growth, right? I guess, you know, apps outside the top 100, they don't really have that much usage anyways. So maybe it's easy to climb up the ranks. Maybe it's harder once you get into like the top 69. But, yeah, I mean, retail is back. They're buying meme coins and they're not going to buy bitcoin. Right.
00:10:13.272 - 00:10:24.238, Speaker D: Of course, it's been really hard to keep up with the majors in the past six months, but, you know, as retail comes back, what are they going to buy? They're going to buy alts. I don't know when that's going to.
00:10:24.246 - 00:10:48.826, Speaker A: Happen, where retail is going to really come back. I mean, we had this very unique moment in time with COVID and the retail checks going out. This run up has clearly been more institutional led. Right. It's like ETF flows, it's not retail led. And that money is sort of spreading around. It looks like the press being good has started to fomo some of the retail back in, I think.
00:10:48.826 - 00:10:53.066, Speaker A: Are you trading any meme coins? Is that, like, easy to do right.
00:10:53.090 - 00:11:20.394, Speaker C: Now, even trading somewhere? A little late to the move? But, yeah, I agree with you. I don't know if retail has necessarily been buying them yet, but it's more so, like the expectation that they will buy them. It's like, you know, once bitcoin hits all time highs and attention comes back, they're going to come and buy meme coins. And it's kind of like forming like a siren call pattern for retail traders. Like, you know, dogecoin, like doing these 30% moves, it grabs a lot of headlines, so we'll see if it kind of self manifests.
00:11:20.694 - 00:11:39.510, Speaker A: Let's get to details. I know, like, our audience is going to want, like, you know, don't give me a category. Like, let's talk coins. So we have dog coins. There's like a few big ones right now. So bonk, you know, it had the most recent explosion in dogwift hats. So we have two Solana ones that are top of mind, from my understanding.
00:11:39.510 - 00:11:50.884, Speaker A: And this is like, you know what I'm reading, they're saying bonk is the one that's on Coinbase and dog with hat now is kind of like on Robin Hood. So like, the two retail avenues kind of COVID those guys.
00:11:51.224 - 00:11:54.088, Speaker C: Well, Robin Hood Eu. Robin Hood Eu.
00:11:54.216 - 00:11:56.024, Speaker A: Oh, shit. Okay, I'm going to short.
00:11:56.104 - 00:11:57.684, Speaker C: That's a big difference.
00:11:59.184 - 00:12:01.524, Speaker A: I mean, EU is like, come on.
00:12:05.504 - 00:12:10.760, Speaker D: Such disrespect for the euros in poker. You have to respect the euros.
00:12:10.872 - 00:12:27.624, Speaker C: I'm not going to, but, like, I mean, it's maybe bullish that, like, oh, Robin E listed it. So eventually Robinhood us listed it. But if you look at the assets on us, it's like the most boomer dino institutional assets ever. It's like tezos, like, not even solomatic or on there. It's just like, yeah, okay.
00:12:27.664 - 00:12:30.256, Speaker A: Do you think, what do you think.
00:12:30.280 - 00:12:37.944, Speaker D: Will be relisted on Robinhood? I mean, surely they have to list new stuff to catch up with Coinbase and whatnot.
00:12:38.404 - 00:12:49.156, Speaker C: Do you think they'll worry regulatory wise? I think they're worried to jeopardize their cash cow with the equities trading. So they're going to be pretty safe until regulatory wise things clear over it.
00:12:49.180 - 00:13:40.804, Speaker B: Might read, have you guys heard the theory that the meme coins or altcoins might not catch as strong a bid this cycle or catch a bid at all just because the inflows we're seeing are tradfi institutional? Going into bitcoin, presumably going into ETH for the ETH ETF that's coming in May in a couple of months. But then there's this whole theory of, like, you know, retail over the past three years has been hurt by inflation. They've sort of been shaken out of the markets they're struggling to get by, et cetera. I personally don't see much merit to that just because income has risen faster than inflation. But, I mean, there's something to be said for that. Like, we're not in COVID helicopter money times where everyone's getting stimulus checks and you can just pile into altcoins, right? Like, people would actually be having to put their own hard earned money into these things. I mean, is that a bear case for altcoins?
00:13:42.344 - 00:14:19.604, Speaker A: So I think it's. It's definitely going to have an attempt to break out on the altcoin side. We're going to have this attempt on the meme coins that whether it sticks and, you know, whether ultimately you end up being correct, we'll have to see. And I think, you know, it's too early to tell, but what's clear is, like, we're at least gonna, you know, test the resistance and see, like, if it can, you know, go through now, you know, next week everything might be red, and we will see, I think the mid curve, you will be. What's his coach is saying here, the mid curve, you would be like, awesome. I agree. I agree.
00:14:19.604 - 00:14:44.734, Speaker A: Like, we're definitely gonna at least try to pump them, and then we'll see how far it goes. Although there has been a huge discrepancy between different assets and the ones that have been underperforming are the ones that were strongest recently. It feels like people are like, well, this already. It's the already pump orders are winning. The guy who's like, ah, Celestia already pumped. Like, you know, this thing already pumped. They're actually, like, crushing it right now.
00:14:44.734 - 00:14:48.554, Speaker A: They're. They're looking for the new stuff. Are you seeing this as well? Think it, or is it just me?
00:14:49.494 - 00:15:14.774, Speaker C: Yeah, I tend to agree. I think this next leg up will be stuff that maybe is further down the risk curve that hasn't already pumped from last year. I think those will outperform, and it could be, like, meme coins. Those didn't pump at all last quarter, and now this quarter might get its time. I agree with you a lot, though. I think they're like, two. The bear case is that retail doesn't have as much money.
00:15:14.774 - 00:15:38.574, Speaker C: No stimmy checks. They're not, like, locked inside all day. I think the bull case is that, like, there is an increased sort of desperation and realization that, like, if these. If you don't hyper gamble your way up, like, you're going to be stuck in some sort of, you know, lower class of people because social mobility has decreased a lot. So we'll see if those two cancel each other out and which one wins.
00:15:39.354 - 00:15:39.682, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:39.698 - 00:16:07.906, Speaker D: And I saw, like, I think sports gambling hit an all time high as well. So clearly. Clearly people are looking to punt. Alts tend to go crazy for a few months after bitcoin breaks, all time highs. And I don't really. I'm not sure if we see, like, an altcoin super cycle, but typically, alts go, like, alts go vertical in a very short period of time, and I think people will eventually front run that. I have no idea which altcoins are going to go crazy, though.
00:16:07.906 - 00:16:12.596, Speaker D: I'm a mid curve, obviously. So, um, I'm trying to go at the left curve. Um, that's.
00:16:12.620 - 00:16:12.852, Speaker A: That.
00:16:12.908 - 00:16:33.652, Speaker D: That's actually one of my worst fears this cycle is that, like, last cycle, I was so stupid that I was, like, you know, aping into, like, defi kingdoms, but, like, now I'm like, so I don't know. I think. I think critically about these things now I'm like, oh, like, if there's, like, a new defi kingdoms, I'm definitely not going to put money on that. So I might just miss out on all these crazy gains.
00:16:33.748 - 00:16:34.116, Speaker A: So that.
00:16:34.140 - 00:16:35.336, Speaker D: That's, like, my greatest fear.
00:16:35.460 - 00:16:59.164, Speaker B: Yeah. Have you guys seen the meme of, like, if you're in the first cycle, your left curve, second cycle, your mid curve, and third cycle plus your right curve. I definitely feel that because I just don't have the zest for on chain activities that I had four years ago. Right. Like, I'm comfortable just holding, you know, one or two coins and just, you know, relaxing as opposed to just finding the new thing to do on chain, which is definitely to my detriment. It's not good.
00:17:00.024 - 00:17:06.536, Speaker A: You know, I just want to point out taiki, probably Max Payne for Taiki. This cycle is if like, Kanto makes a new all time high and Taiki.
00:17:06.560 - 00:17:12.003, Speaker C: Is just like, did you allocate back?
00:17:12.543 - 00:17:13.643, Speaker D: No, no, no.
00:17:14.263 - 00:17:18.479, Speaker C: I bought. You bought a routine. I'm bullish Kanto now.
00:17:18.631 - 00:17:21.447, Speaker D: Oh, my God. You bought my capitulation.
00:17:21.615 - 00:17:22.803, Speaker C: Someone on this?
00:17:23.183 - 00:17:26.083, Speaker B: One of the lads always needs to have canto. That's just.
00:17:27.183 - 00:17:39.184, Speaker C: I have a new canto bowl when tanky got liquid. Oh, my God, that's like 80 billion fpv for now. One. Yeah, that's crazy.
00:17:39.964 - 00:18:04.374, Speaker A: You know, there is like a fight for attention right now. So there's a lot of different things going on. I think blast was one that, you know, they had done a great job of initially attracting attention and then getting the TVL. And then, you know, they loop back into this interesting competition. They had this blast competition. I think they said there were 3000 projects who submitted. It's pretty clear that some of them are rugs or maybe a lot of them are rugs.
00:18:04.374 - 00:18:20.602, Speaker A: They chose winners, so they announced the winner list in different categories. It wasn't as a short list as I expected. I thought they would choose, like, one perp and one this, and instead they chose multiple. I think got diluted a little bit. I think it's up to 50 winners or something like that, but I can.
00:18:20.618 - 00:18:21.242, Speaker D: Kind of talk about that.
00:18:21.258 - 00:18:22.234, Speaker A: So please.
00:18:22.314 - 00:19:01.976, Speaker D: I think someone in the comment section asked about blast, so they launched Mainnet. Right now it's full of rugs and they're doing more points. And I think 50% of the points that's going to come is going to go to users. So if you use apps, you get points and then 50% of the airdrop is going to go towards gold. So, like, applications will receive gold and the apps can decide whether to distribute them or not. Some people are upset because, you know, people bridged, like, millions of dollars into the multisig and now they're going to get diluted again. For me, like, I'm not really touching blast right now.
00:19:01.976 - 00:19:18.724, Speaker D: Like, I don't really have an edge, like, aping into these on chain shitters. I've reached 0.1 ETH to blast. And what I need to do if I want to bridge my blast, my ETH to blast, I have to pay, like, 0.02 ETH to, like, you know, move my ethnicity. Uh, so it's not even worth.
00:19:18.884 - 00:19:20.012, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, farming glass, right?
00:19:20.028 - 00:19:20.876, Speaker D: Now, you.
00:19:20.900 - 00:19:32.904, Speaker A: You said you bridged your 0.1, but you didn't actually bridge it. You locked it up, and people were just in an l one smart contract, right. Just waiting. So it wasn't actually bridge. Now that you actually have to bridge, it costs a lot to bridge.
00:19:33.244 - 00:19:43.356, Speaker D: I know. And then I think if you. If you bridge the blast and you, like, withdraw that ETH, you, like, lose points. So, like, yeah, you don't get your.
00:19:43.380 - 00:19:47.984, Speaker B: Points for the two weeks that you're in the withdrawal queue, which is crazy. And you lose a bonus. Right.
00:19:48.474 - 00:19:51.574, Speaker D: Yeah. So that's their way of maintaining liquidity.
00:19:51.954 - 00:20:18.660, Speaker A: I mean, does it remind you guys a little bit of friend tech where, like, you know, the guy at some point was, like, trying to enforce, you know, you're gonna lose all your points if you. If you go. If you use a different app and you're also like, you know, it's a competing app, then you lose all your points. And, like, all this other stuff, it feels like, kind of, like, heavy handed ways to kind of force the incentives. And we know that incentives are everything. But, like, this is like. I see Vicki nodding.
00:20:18.660 - 00:20:20.144, Speaker A: Does this remind you of that?
00:20:21.604 - 00:20:27.104, Speaker C: It does. I can't wait for the start of the blast versus mantle l two wars.
00:20:28.604 - 00:20:58.394, Speaker B: No, I do. So, actually, last night, a lot of people were talking about blast, obviously, because just launched, there are some airdrops floating around. I know some people that got pretty decent airdrops and are pretty excited, but everyone is a little burnt out from the points thing. Like, it's a very transparent situation that Pac man's running. Right. Like, everyone knows this game is to sort of, like, curate the points in such a ways to keep you on the chain as much as possible. And everyone also knows that you're probably going to get deluded to the point where your points aren't worth that much.
00:20:58.394 - 00:21:14.194, Speaker B: But, like, to their credit, they've been able to engineer this flywheel where no one has left the blur ecosystem, and they've been able to run it back with blur blend and now blast. And you got to wonder what next b word is coming. But there's always going to be something. So it's pretty interesting.
00:21:15.414 - 00:21:41.268, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, like Pac Man, I think a few months ago, when we did our year end episode, he was my founder of the year. And it's like, you know, it's not just all, you know, good or bad, it's just I just find him to be doing things, you know, he's pushing the boundaries. Very interesting. I'm very curious to see how things play out. I think blast was a huge new approach that, you know, some people are copying certain things. I do think that they were a bit rushed to get out.
00:21:41.268 - 00:22:04.904, Speaker A: I think they had told the teams that I've spoken to, hey, we're going to launch Feb. And then became late Feb, and then literally on the last day of Feb, like the last moment that they could still say technically it was still February, they put it out. I'm seeing a lot of complaints, and I think you see in the chat here mean a disaster. Lots of bugs, lots of rugs.
00:22:05.224 - 00:22:07.404, Speaker C: I got rugged a couple times on the blast.
00:22:08.024 - 00:22:10.000, Speaker A: You got rugged, you got rugged.
00:22:10.152 - 00:22:13.688, Speaker C: Just small, small rugs. Calculated rugs.
00:22:13.856 - 00:22:18.136, Speaker A: Okay. Calculated. Uh, gamble. Gamble rugs.
00:22:18.280 - 00:22:19.004, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:20.464 - 00:22:25.016, Speaker A: What, what can you, can you tell us a little bit? Are you able to, like, say what kind of stuff it was?
00:22:25.160 - 00:22:40.134, Speaker C: Well, it wasn't me, it was my partner, but we were just like, tailing, like, smart whale wallets and just like buying coins that they're buying and, you know, just like five hundred, ten k at a time. And a lot of projects just kind of just pull the liquidity. But that's just part of the game.
00:22:41.074 - 00:22:53.306, Speaker A: Yeah, part of the game. I thought that they said that they're kycing at least one person from, from each team, at least the ones that won. Are you, are you going into stuff that, like, won a prize or are you just going to like.
00:22:53.490 - 00:22:54.882, Speaker C: Okay, random stuff.
00:22:54.938 - 00:23:36.488, Speaker A: That's not where the real legions, they want the losers. So, look, it's early, and Pac man has, you know, talked down the critics and come out victorious many times. I think when blast first came out, you know, there was a lot of shade thrown and then he's ended up building all this tbl. I think right now it's a tough moment, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if they kind of pull through and do really well. But, yeah, it's early to tell. So, Jordan, do you have a little.
00:23:36.536 - 00:23:40.724, Speaker B: Rivalry going there with mantle or you just want everyone to win?
00:23:41.264 - 00:23:51.484, Speaker A: No, I think I'll be honest. If I see a weak l two that has tbl to drain, it's probably Manta right now.
00:23:53.754 - 00:23:56.210, Speaker D: The name I'm actually bridging out of Manta right now.
00:23:56.282 - 00:24:01.014, Speaker C: I'm like, all right, March 28, all this stone gets unlocked.
00:24:01.474 - 00:24:02.146, Speaker A: Here we go.
00:24:02.210 - 00:24:04.626, Speaker D: I've been selling some stone recently. I'm like, all right.
00:24:04.690 - 00:24:06.254, Speaker C: Really? At a discount?
00:24:06.834 - 00:24:14.334, Speaker D: Yeah, because I have, like, better places. I need the money. I know. I'm mid quirking so hard. I need the money.
00:24:14.714 - 00:24:18.014, Speaker C: You need some 4% monthly yield. Not enough.
00:24:18.734 - 00:24:20.994, Speaker D: It's not enough. It's not enough.
00:24:21.854 - 00:24:57.234, Speaker A: Look, the yields are insane right now. I mean, even basis for the last few days, if you don't want to go long and you're happy to short the basis, you're getting paid, like, 1020 bps a window. So that's like 40 bits a day, 100% a year APY. And I think let's talk about Athena a little bit, because their yields have been just like strata, stratospheric, stratonomic over the last days. And so for the first time, Jordy is tempted to farm.
00:24:59.054 - 00:25:00.794, Speaker C: You haven't been farming Jordy?
00:25:01.334 - 00:25:24.824, Speaker A: You know, I don't usually farm, but when I see 100% APY plus plus, you know, shards or whatever. Look, Athena is a very interesting project. It's been very controversial, and I think we had a lot of requests to talk about it. I have been following it, and I think some of you guys have as well. Are you farming this taiki, or have you looked at it?
00:25:25.604 - 00:25:41.320, Speaker D: Yeah, but I think I can get better yields elsewhere, which is kind of crazy to think about, right? Like some of my stables, it's in drift. Like collecting those drift points on Solana. I think that'll pay off better than Athena. I'm bullish. Athena, though, I think it's going to be.
00:25:41.320 - 00:25:42.100, Speaker C: Be really big.
00:25:42.252 - 00:25:43.264, Speaker A: They can expand.
00:25:44.244 - 00:26:08.424, Speaker B: When you said you can do better than the 33%, that reminds me, if you guys remember in the cycle last time when Terra was anchor was paying 20% on UST, and at the time, everyone was like, that's not enough. Like, who the heck is going to use this? You got to pump that up. It's not high enough. And here we have 33%, and the market is so bullish that you can beat that as well, which is crazy. I don't know what to make of that. Maybe that's a top signal.
00:26:10.974 - 00:26:15.118, Speaker D: Institutions are coming. They're going to die. They're going to dilute us and pump our bags.
00:26:15.166 - 00:26:49.570, Speaker C: I think the big thing is being able to, like, do something with the stables, which, like Athena doesn't allow quite yet. But back then, like, you could lev, you could margin like your ust on FTX. Nice thing about meth and like bybit is that, like, you can farm meth, you can short the perp, you can make like, 2030, 50% a year, and you can use it as trading collateral, so you can put on trades on top. So, like, that's what I. That's like the. Eventually, Athena will have things built out that accepts USDC es collateral, and you can do stuff on top, but in its current state, it's like you actually just lock it in there and you don't do anything with the stable. So that's like the downside in its current state?
00:26:49.762 - 00:27:11.924, Speaker A: Yeah. Correct. I mean. I mean, just to go on what Thiki just said, you know, the closest analogy for Ethan is probably not a stable coin. It's like a vault. Like a solve vault, where there's a strategy being run. In this case, they're running the strategy, and it's one that's working really well in a bull market because so many people won along, and you're sort of providing them leverage.
00:27:11.924 - 00:27:32.504, Speaker A: Whether it actually ends up becoming a stable coin in the sense of it's used as collateral or as a means of payment or exchange. We'll see. If it gets into the billions, maybe it will. Go ahead, Justin.
00:27:33.004 - 00:27:58.434, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess I was going to ask. So, from what I understand, I haven't looked too much into Athena, but from what I can tell, they're doing a lot of this, like treasury management for the user, and they're also doing it on centralized venues, so they're using. Doing the strategy on a sec. So does that mean this, like, Athena team is running? I assume there's some regulatory arbitrage where they're not in the US, and then they're also just custodying funds to get that yield. Or does. Do you guys know how that works?
00:27:59.174 - 00:28:54.594, Speaker A: I know very well how this works. I mean, talking to them, you know, since the pre seed kind of days and been tracking the project, I have to give my hat off to the founder, first of all, guy, when I first heard the idea, and this is like Arthur Hayes's idea of doing this sort of centralized exchange, shorting perps, I was quite skeptical that everything could. There's a lot of moving pieces. You need the third party custody for the exchanges, to take collateral of the stake teeth, and then you short it, and you want the yield to, like, be high somehow. Like, he's kind of pulled off a very difficult task so far of getting everybody to agree to all the different moving parts. And it looks like their TVL is kind of on the way to a billion. So this is one of the situations where I think the founder, the quality of the founder is sort of just like, just forces something that shouldn't normally work, but it kind of is working.
00:28:54.594 - 00:29:28.990, Speaker A: So pretty impressed, I have to say. And, you know, I think the communication ultimately, you know, has had back and forth, but they're saying, you know, this, this is a strategy. It's not a stable coin. And if someone is too lazy to do it themselves, they can do it through them. And actually they'll probably make more money because there's like, you know, extra rewards going on and it's probably even safer because of the third party custody. So. Pretty impressed.
00:29:28.990 - 00:29:53.300, Speaker A: Celini has not invested in. We got a little just, you know, disclaimer. There is no disclaimer. Celine is not invested. But I have to say that, you know, Mantle has been quite interested in USD and there's a good amount of USD on mantle. And I think right now it works until it doesn't.
00:29:53.412 - 00:30:04.544, Speaker B: I actually want to ask you about this. That is the sentiment I'm seeing from like a 30% of crypto Twitter is like, this works until there's a bank run and then it's just terror all over again. Can you either dispute that or confirm that?
00:30:05.524 - 00:30:31.140, Speaker A: I mean, thank you. Maybe, like, you can chime in, but my. My personal belief is that this doesn't have any explosion risk. All that can potentially happen is you take a little bit of loss because the funding goes negative. And funding goes negative means at that point it's inversed or the perp has gone below the future, below the spot. And so as people unwind because they're like, oh, shit, negative yield. Like -5% yield.
00:30:31.140 - 00:30:49.044, Speaker A: I get out, they're actually selling like a little bit of a loss. So you end up taking like a 510 percent loss, which, you know, they're trying to build an insurance fund to. To be able to catch up. So not really blow up risk. It's just sort of like, it's a risk that you'll have to unwind the trade if the yields go negative.
00:30:49.384 - 00:31:09.978, Speaker D: Yeah, I feel like people are, in general are like, super horny to see things blow up. So it's like, oh, like Athena's gonna crash the markets. Oh, Eigen layer is gonna crash the markets. And then they want to retweet that. Tweet, like two years from now and then claim clout. But, you know, you can have to bet on these teams to like, but.
00:31:10.106 - 00:31:17.934, Speaker B: It'S not necessarily that they're looking for that. It's also that all of the biggest products of the last cycle did blow up the market, you know. So we have PTSD.
00:31:18.314 - 00:31:20.574, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, it's still the PTSD.
00:31:21.594 - 00:31:37.990, Speaker A: So just looking at the chat, Andre makes a good point. Yeah. Like we got, we got a lot of people watching. Let's click some likes, click some subscribe analysis. Let's do this. And then we have whiskey saying when Usdypool. I actually was just talking about this with guy today.
00:31:37.990 - 00:31:46.474, Speaker A: I said we need to, we need a USD, USD white pool and I'm gonna try to get this done on mantle AsaP. So good question.
00:31:50.574 - 00:31:54.034, Speaker D: Should we, should we talk? Should we do some q and A or.
00:31:55.434 - 00:31:57.994, Speaker A: Yeah, we're doing.
00:31:58.034 - 00:32:08.578, Speaker B: I'm going to scroll up to find some questions. If you have anything pressing that you want the lads to answer, drop your comment and we'll get to it. We're looking for fun stuff to wrap up on Athena.
00:32:08.626 - 00:32:37.438, Speaker A: We got maybe my cypriot brother vias. I don't know, that's a very cypriot name. Versus Nikola. It is here he's saying airdropping a token in our staple. So this is the very interesting thing I just realized today. They have these shards and you can claim the shards and get, like you kind of get points for the token, but you give up some of the yield or something. So you can either get the token or you give up some of the yield and then that goes to their insurance fund.
00:32:37.438 - 00:32:59.488, Speaker A: So it's kind of like a win win for them because they give out tokens and they build up their insurance fund. So you sort of have to choose. So that's an interesting dynamic. And then people have to kind of price. I love this stuff recently, like, this is like the meta is like people pricing tokens that haven't launched yet. So this is like pre, pre launch. There's not even like a whales market.
00:32:59.488 - 00:33:18.632, Speaker A: You just have to figure out like what's a shard gonna be worth? And I heard, like people are farming this and they're buying on Pendle at like 6% a month, which is very high, but some people are like buying it. That seems reasonable, to be honest, because.
00:33:18.768 - 00:33:33.120, Speaker D: They'Re going to drop a token when USD hits a billion, which might be like two weeks or a week from now. So I mean, I'm sure that token is going to trade at 2 billion FTB at least. You know, that's the type of market we're in.
00:33:33.312 - 00:33:51.888, Speaker B: All right, I've got it. I've got a few questions pulled up here. Let's do some maybe rapid fire and keep the questions coming. I think these are good. So this one has been top of mind for a while. We're seeing this whole narrative, left translated, accelerated cycle. What are your guys thoughts? Is that possible? I think it is possible.
00:33:51.888 - 00:34:01.044, Speaker B: I don't think we're there yet, but I do think the top could come earlier in the year of 2021 or in 2025 in this case, than it did last time.
00:34:03.144 - 00:34:22.916, Speaker A: I think so. I think so. It does feel like everything's getting accelerated. The reality is, like, there's a lot of burns from last cycle as well. So I think there's muscle memory. And the first thing that I realized this cycle is that even on the way up, there's a lot of muscle memory. People, like, remember, okay, this is the stuff that pumps.
00:34:22.916 - 00:34:44.783, Speaker A: Let's just pump it, like, faster than, like, you know, just preempting. And I think the same thing will happen on the way down. People remember the PTSD, and they'll just be, like, getting out of stuff that's, like, speculative when they feel the shift is going. So I wouldn't be surprised if we have a different, like, kind of more volatile cycle. I don't know. Thiki, wait. What do you think?
00:34:45.723 - 00:34:47.623, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I totally agree with you.
00:34:49.203 - 00:34:49.611, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:49.667 - 00:35:08.134, Speaker C: I think, like, some things, like, they have to take their time to play out like this. Human nature just takes a certain amount of time for, like, things to wash out on the bottom and so on and so forth. But I do think, you know, like, you know, life is event based, and these events are moving faster than ever, so. So it makes sense that cycle be shortened.
00:35:08.634 - 00:35:10.414, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Good question.
00:35:10.874 - 00:35:11.554, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:11.674 - 00:35:12.026, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:35:12.090 - 00:35:12.306, Speaker B: All right.
00:35:12.330 - 00:35:25.414, Speaker D: Everything is reflexive, right? So it's like, if people expect a top in q one of 2025, then it'll probably top q three or q four, or, you know, people, like, front run expectations, and then it's also like.
00:35:26.394 - 00:35:36.824, Speaker C: Yeah, you could see it actually, like, front run it too quickly. And we, like, double top or something, you know, like, because, like, the first round, people expected to pass, but it's, like, not actually over for everybody. Or, like, a triple.
00:35:36.864 - 00:35:38.232, Speaker D: That's what happened last night. Goal.
00:35:38.408 - 00:35:39.364, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:35:40.784 - 00:35:45.808, Speaker D: A double double top. Like, four years cycle of a double top. Double McDonald's.
00:35:45.896 - 00:35:46.120, Speaker A: That.
00:35:46.152 - 00:35:51.124, Speaker D: That would be painful. Everyone's going to get wrecked. I'll get wrecked for sure, you know?
00:35:54.304 - 00:36:07.776, Speaker B: All right, I see another interesting question here. I'll. I'll start with an answer. Do you sell a percentage of your core holdings on pump days? Um, no, although it does get tempting. I just think it's. It's too early for that. Like, we didn't hold through this bear market to sell before all time highs.
00:36:07.776 - 00:36:43.808, Speaker B: So for me, I. I've said this publicly, I think I have just sell targets where I'm going to sell, and if they don't get hit, they don't get hit and I'll keep holding. But for me, maybe this is a little too bullish, but for me, I'm going to sell about 25%. And this is all in ETH terms. 25% of my ETH at about eight k, 25% at ten ish k, 25% at twelve, and then the last 25 if we ever get there. I know that's bullish, but this would still be like a massive diminished returns relative to all other cycles. This would be even more diminished than BTC's last cycle.
00:36:43.808 - 00:37:01.854, Speaker B: And I do think ETH can get there to ten k for sure. Maybe 15k, we'll see. But I'm fine holding some. If we ended up crashing, not reaching, you know, that last 15k target, I don't know. Do you guys think those numbers are crazy? Are those realistic? But I'm really not selling until we hit that. So if we never hit it, I'll just hold to zero.
00:37:03.394 - 00:37:39.830, Speaker A: It's reasonable. It's not a bad way to approach it. I don't like to, like, set these targets for me. I just want to get a sense of where we are, where are we in the cycle? And I think at this stage, I can't imagine not having my core holdings. One mistake I made last cycle, I think, was trying to trade too much around, like, my beta. And I'm very, like, psychologically happy now of just, like, having some Ethan. It's in meth, so it's even harder to unwind or sell whatever.
00:37:39.830 - 00:38:10.462, Speaker A: It's just doing fantastic. Getting double dose shield, getting all this stuff and it's just pumping and I don't want to sell a single. I'm not even tempted at all. I'm not tempted at all. You know, BTC, sometimes it gets a bit tempting, but it's so reflective. I scratch my itch by looking at, like, what alts, I think are going to come back down and I just short alts instead. Maybe I'm going to get, you know, a little bit of drawdown with things pumping harder than I expect.
00:38:10.462 - 00:38:14.032, Speaker A: But that's how I. I keep my core holdings. How about you guys?
00:38:14.088 - 00:38:29.864, Speaker D: And you can borrow against it too, right? Like, you can borrow against bitcoin, borrow against Eid farm with it. You know, it's just. That's like another good way to diamond hands. Oh, like, not diamond hands, but, like, make your collateral, like, really productive and they're dropping or something.
00:38:29.944 - 00:38:57.824, Speaker A: Can we talk about that a little bit, Taiki? Because somebody was saying that today. To me, he's like, oh, you know, you can borrow against your math and get, like, die for 7%, and then you can put that into, you know, Athena get 100%. Like, is the fact that you can borrow for cheap or that you can farm? Is that a mistake of the market, or is that just me, that you're going off the risk curve, or you are actually taking more risk? Like, why can you borrow and farm? Like, why? Like, shouldn't those yields be the same? Theoretically, unless. Unless it's more risky.
00:38:58.244 - 00:39:38.040, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, there's definitely, like, a risk premium, right? Like, Athena yields, and then there's the cost of unwinding. So if you want to unwind that position, then something bad is happening. So you might take, like, a haircut. And then there's gas costs where, you know, if you borrow on mantle, then you have to bridge takes gas at the approve and all that stuff which eats into the yield. I do think over time, like, the yields will, you know, reach parity and compress, maybe, like, maybe the institutions really have to come on chain, uh, to dilute our yields. But even then, like, if that happens, then, like, our bags are going to pump. So I'm not, like, necessarily that worried.
00:39:38.040 - 00:39:58.900, Speaker D: Um, yeah, but I also think that markets are inefficient. There's edge in identifying these opportunities. And, yeah, like you said, like, you can easily earn 40, 50% apr on ETH right now, which is, like, pretty crazy. Uh, whether it be restaking eigen layer, like buying stone on manta at a discount, there's a crazy yield opportunities. It's insane.
00:39:59.092 - 00:40:31.396, Speaker B: I can share an anecdote that might be interesting. I personally think our markets are extremely inefficient, and I think the reason is eyeballs. There's just simply not enough eyeballs on all of these thousands of different DeFi platforms where you can get a yield. And the example I'll give is, when we were designing an auction mechanic at Astaria, and we initially thought, like, oh, we'll just run a reverse dog, a dutch auction. And, like, whoever fills it, fills it, and if it doesn't get filled, it doesn't get filled. And, like, that's the fair market price. The issue is you need a certain amount of eyeballs for that to be true.
00:40:31.396 - 00:41:00.054, Speaker B: Right. And we're just not there yet. I mean, there's so many different money markets where you can borrow, you can leverage, where you can stake, where you can get yield, and you might only be getting 5%, but you're also getting points. And how do you calculate that? So I don't think we're there. I don't think we're going to get there this cycle. I mean, even last cycle, aave and compound. And I think to this day, aave and compound, very blue chip, you know, quote unquote safe protocols, still have massive discrepancies on yields, so I just don't think we're there.
00:41:00.054 - 00:41:08.674, Speaker B: I think this thing has to be, you know, 100 x ten to 100 x larger for us to see yields be reflective of the risk reward you're taking.
00:41:09.774 - 00:41:35.014, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree. I mean, I feel like you can run like a $200 million fund and make 20, 30% a year delta neutral completely this farming basis. And it's just, you know, it's not even touching DeFi or anything on chain. So it's just a definition of inefficiency. I think, like, everyone that can make money is. Has better opportunities. So, like, this kind of thing is just, like, left, you know, for other people to take.
00:41:35.014 - 00:41:42.170, Speaker C: I've been tempted to do that, but, yeah, it's free money. Quite literally, yeah.
00:41:42.242 - 00:41:48.522, Speaker D: So much free money on the floor. Famous last words. Thank you.
00:41:48.538 - 00:41:55.094, Speaker A: Do you have core BTC, youth holdings, or just playing video games and just trying to get a high score?
00:41:57.754 - 00:42:20.418, Speaker C: I capitulated after that move from 50 to 55, 57. I'm like, fuck, I can't risk this happening again. We all know these down where the fair value is. In my mind, I'm like, oh, it's just going to grind up slowly. Worst case, I missed out on 2%, but if I can miss out on a 15, 20% move just like that, then you has to be allocated. It's kind of unfortunate. Painful lesson, Jordy.
00:42:20.418 - 00:42:22.214, Speaker C: Sure you've learned it before.
00:42:22.554 - 00:42:33.810, Speaker A: I have, I have. And the good thing about thick is that he may, he goes out into the arena and he makes the mistakes and he learns and always trying things.
00:42:33.882 - 00:42:34.534, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:42:36.314 - 00:42:44.344, Speaker D: Jordy, in the comments section, there's a question from Tristan Scherhaus. Is the hex ecosystem worth investing in?
00:42:46.804 - 00:42:47.900, Speaker C: Great question.
00:42:48.092 - 00:43:01.464, Speaker A: You know, today we saw for the first time some of the old classics like the litecoins and the bitcoin caches. We're trying to do a little catch up. So, you know, I haven't heard that name hex. Haven't heard that name in a long time.
00:43:06.204 - 00:43:07.620, Speaker B: I want to, I want to ask.
00:43:07.652 - 00:43:08.092, Speaker A: What is it though?
00:43:08.108 - 00:43:10.034, Speaker D: Is it though? Sorry.
00:43:10.074 - 00:43:25.946, Speaker B: I want to know. You're good. You're good. I want to ask a question that's near and dear to my heart. And if we could, it would be cool if you guys were willing to give percentages of how the percentage chance you think of the ETH ETF being approved. I'll start one. I think it's amazing that we have the opportunity to run this whole situation back.
00:43:25.946 - 00:43:46.266, Speaker B: People faded the bitcoin ETF until it happened. They also said it wouldn't matter. You're hearing the same narratives for ETH, and Blackrock is the one pushing it through. You're seeing how much money ever all of Wall street is making and how much Wall street loves the bitcoin ETF's. I think the ETF is a lock. I'll say 95%. I think I said 90% last time.
00:43:46.266 - 00:44:09.738, Speaker B: I'm revising it up. It's hard to imagine that Blackrock gets a second loss on their book for approvals. They're like 500 something to one. I think they knew that this would be accepted based on conversations with the SEC. And I think also Wall street clearly wants this, so it's going to happen. And I think it's amazing that we're able to run this trade back again. The same exact thing is going to happen in my, in my book.
00:44:09.738 - 00:44:16.578, Speaker B: And I think this is sort of like that free money on the floor and you have to pick it up situation. But what do you guys think? Am I just too bullish?
00:44:16.626 - 00:44:16.874, Speaker A: ETH?
00:44:16.914 - 00:44:20.174, Speaker B: I've got my blinders on, so I can't see the, the truth or.
00:44:21.914 - 00:44:57.026, Speaker A: Look like it's. You're not going to go wrong being long ETH. It's just like, when does it happen and when are you rotating? You could miss. You could, you could miss, like this, like huge BTC run up if you don't have any BTC allocated and if the ETF gets delayed, which is possible, we're seeing in the chat someone saying it's like 46% for me, so they might play games. I do think it will eventually have to get approved. I think maybe there's a chance that Ganster will have to leave and try. Trump puts whoever he puts and then the next guy does it.
00:44:57.026 - 00:45:06.014, Speaker A: But, you know, I'm expecting it in the next twelve months, but it's hard to say the timing, so we have to just keep an eye on it and.
00:45:08.954 - 00:45:52.374, Speaker D: Can I say something? You can argue that, like, maybe, like there's a chance, right? Cause ETH has pumped a lot because everyone knows the playbook like a big ETF. Good. So there's a chance that the ETF can be like, the ETF can be a local top, at least for the cycle. So can't you also argue that if it gets delayed to 2025, that's somewhat bullish the markets, because it gives people a longer time period to anticipate, because the markets, it's all about anticipation and reflexivity and expectations of the future. So it might be better if we just like, don't blow our load too soon. Right? What do you, what do you guys think about that?
00:45:53.394 - 00:45:54.374, Speaker A: We're live.
00:45:55.914 - 00:46:35.604, Speaker B: Well, well, I have a couple of thoughts. I do think, like, I think I was saying before, the most bullish thing for the bitcoin ETF is if it somehow gets miraculously delayed and we get to keep writing this up. I think that was invalidated just because, like, the inflows are real and you can't, you can't fake that. And I think the ETF inflows will not be as good, but will be real. I also think this comment from, wants to comment that polymarket is at 46% shows you, I think it was actually similar for bitcoin and around the same time period out. I think that shows you that the market's not really pricing this in right now, even though it seems to me to be obvious. I also think Jordy talked about when it will happen.
00:46:35.604 - 00:47:13.776, Speaker B: The final deadline for Blackrock is in May. So I think that's when our base case should be, that it gets approved, improved on and, yeah, I just think it's amazing that we can't, we get to run this back. And the one last thing I want to touch on that was a comment Jordy made, is, when do you allocate to this? You might miss a rotation from bitcoin, blah, blah, blah. I don't think that's necessarily a helpful way to think, jordy, no offense. I mean, I've, I missed the sole run up, right. There's always something that's going up more than what you're holding. And I think, like, a lot of the success from this market can be had by having long term conviction in a few specific things.
00:47:13.776 - 00:47:34.428, Speaker B: And yes, I should have held bitcoin over ETH over the last six months to a year, but it is what it is. I'm holding ETH. I'm still doing well in dollar terms, very well, and, and I'm happy with that. And I think, like, a lot of your success can come from that. Right? They say comparison is the thief of joy. So you're never going to have the fastest horse. You just want to have a good horse.
00:47:34.616 - 00:48:15.544, Speaker C: So mathematically I want to say that like if we think ETH goes to ten k on ETF and my internal odds pretty much match, polymarket say it's 40% and that's already like $4,000 worth of EV baked in there. So it was obviously kind of like very smart to be long, even if you think it was less likely than not for the ETF to get approved in May. If it does, and it goes to ten k, then it was a clear long at 2.5, which is something I missed. Personally I don't think it does, but I really think we should get a lawyer on this show just to give his thoughts. There's a lot of stuff I want to ask him about, like our point securities. How does he think about the ETTF, all this sort of regulatory stuff? Because crypto in the day is all just reg arb.
00:48:15.544 - 00:48:35.794, Speaker C: But I think this is a unilateral decision by Gary right now and I think it's less likely than not that ETH is approved on May is my current thoughts. I still think you can go up though because it's, I think, I think like the math is still, it's still got room to go up just on the probabilities. But yeah.
00:48:38.654 - 00:48:47.034, Speaker A: Cool. I mean I'm sure we'll be discussing this specific topic, you know, many times as the year goes on. Let's talk about some alts.
00:48:50.614 - 00:48:52.254, Speaker C: Let's talk about some altcoins.
00:48:52.334 - 00:48:57.374, Speaker B: What's your, what's your take on condo? I mean Hondo, so.
00:49:00.914 - 00:49:23.654, Speaker A: I'm quite familiar with Ondo. I'm close to the team. We have them on mantle. Usdy is pretty big there. They had an interesting announcement. They have this idea to around tokenization. Most people, when they talk about tokenization, they talk about taking the stock or taking SMP and making a token out of it, same as we're used to and then people trading it.
00:49:23.654 - 00:50:10.688, Speaker A: So Ondo's vision is a little bit different. It's interesting, they are saying that the way that they see tokenization is setting up a traditional prime broker like the ones you have right now. And actually when you make a subscription to buy a stock through that traditional prime broker, the same you do now. That's when a token would be issued. So it sort of changes the loop a little bit of how this Blackrock tokenization vision might go. I think it's an interesting one to think about. And different things will be tried.
00:50:10.688 - 00:50:27.914, Speaker A: And I do think we will have this interactive brokers version potentially tried, where you're doing the same interactive broker stuff, but you get a token, and then maybe there's some defi stuff you can do with that token. I don't know. I don't know if you guys have been following this specific.
00:50:31.414 - 00:51:01.070, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been following it closely. I think. I mean, I just think it's an incredibly competent team. I think in this space, you always have to bet on the team, even over the idea, because so many people pivot. When I was working at Ondo, we were doing liquidity as a service. We were like, you know, helping shitcoins get liquidity with stablecoin pairings. There were a ton of stable coin projects, like fracs, Faye, et cetera, et cetera, that had all of this liquidity that they could either mint or that was just on their books, that they could pair with other tokens and give liquidity.
00:51:01.070 - 00:51:17.894, Speaker B: And, you know, the sign of a good team is if they can pivot. And Ando has pivoted into something that I think is really exciting. I think the idea bring these assets on chain is amazing. And I'm never going to bet against that team, but, yeah, obviously I've vested interest.
00:51:19.234 - 00:51:37.014, Speaker A: Let's see. I mean, the only thing kind of an issue right now is that 5% treasury yields, when Taiki just said that he is not interested in 6% a month, this is like 5% a year. So the tension in the bull market goes to.
00:51:37.194 - 00:52:11.986, Speaker B: Because it's a great point, Jordy. There's a huge disconnect between what people that are doing things on chain one and what real tradfi, you know, quote unquote real trad five people want. Right? Like, I have thought about this a lot. It's like, how exciting is 5% on chain? You know, when you can do that elsewhere off chain? I do think it's cool that they're democratizing this, like, low risk investment to people outside of the US. We talked about that about earlier. I think that's quite cool. But we need to see more people operating on chain for this stuff to get really attractive, because the people on chain are just DJ's.
00:52:12.090 - 00:52:26.138, Speaker A: You need to be able to at least use it for collateral, for trading, so you can just kind of boost yourself a little bit. That's sort of like the next step. Let's. Let's kind of loop through apps. Okay. Versus my buddy again. Tell us, Axel, or what's up? Listing on binance.
00:52:26.138 - 00:52:51.606, Speaker A: So I haven't, I think, have I talked about Axelar? I have been bullish on Axelar recently. I love, this is like my traditional markets bias, but I love teams that are so freaking legit that it's hard to copy what they're doing. You can't just copy paste the thing. And these teams are tackling. I've talked about layer zero, wormhole. Axelar. Tackling is very difficult.
00:52:51.606 - 00:53:18.354, Speaker A: Problem of safe cross chain tokens and messaging and standards. This is, like, so freaking difficult to do. These teams have been building for years. I mean, Axelar, I think the founders, like, co founded Algorand and then kind of moved to this years ago. So hard to do. And I love betting on. It's like the only thing that's undervalued in the market is, like, things like Axelr where, like, someone really, like, is tackling an incredibly difficult problem.
00:53:18.354 - 00:53:25.914, Speaker A: And, you know, if I think about five years time, it's not going to be like manta, which he's going to get farmed to zero. And, like, who cares?
00:53:29.654 - 00:53:31.710, Speaker B: The name collision is they gotta get.
00:53:31.742 - 00:53:57.614, Speaker A: Out of the MA and t like category we just had. But in all serious tokens that I guess I'm comfortable holding long term are the ones that are, like, building fundamental infrastructure that is very hard to replicate. And I don't just mean, like another l one because, like, there's 100 billion of those. But this category in bullish on XR got listed on binance a little, nice little pump. Go ahead.
00:53:58.314 - 00:54:30.790, Speaker D: I just raised my hand. So realistic. Ask the question. So I guess XLR is part of the interoperability type of narrative, right? So we're seeing so many l one s and l two's launch that. Are you bullish? These interoperability type of. I guess it's like a two part question. It's like, what? What do you think about the liquidity fragmentation with all these l two s? Is that bearish l two tokens in general and bullish heat because there's some value pool there.
00:54:30.790 - 00:54:37.474, Speaker D: And do you think the multi chain future, the interoperability narrative comes back again or comes back to cycle?
00:54:38.134 - 00:54:51.166, Speaker A: Look, we're about to have it hit hard. Wormhole is going first. W. I told the guys ticker W. I know it's like a hotel chain, but that is freaking brilliant. They're so. They're so just like letter one letter.
00:54:51.166 - 00:55:10.350, Speaker A: It's like the Saudis with the license plates is they spent like $5 million to get like a single digit license plate that's going to kick it off. Right. So you have that one layer zero is going to follow. It's. It's something that makes sense in the sense of, like, it's a high total addressable market. The Tam is very large. If the.
00:55:10.350 - 00:55:34.054, Speaker A: If the field of crypto and chains is going to keep growing, then you need like, this. This premium stuff. So I think W is trading at like 17 billion on Avo. I know what's going on. It started five and it's just been climbing, climbing, climbing. So we are going to have this be a narrative very soon. And I would position in things that are around that narrative.
00:55:34.054 - 00:55:48.562, Speaker A: So things like Axelr, things like, there's some proxies potentially for wormhole or layer zero. Anything you like, Vicki, or. We can't. We can't.
00:55:48.738 - 00:55:50.654, Speaker C: I know. I was saying zeta.
00:55:51.194 - 00:55:54.906, Speaker A: Zeta is interesting. It's the new coins.
00:55:54.970 - 00:55:55.922, Speaker D: It's always the new coins.
00:55:55.978 - 00:56:02.854, Speaker A: Chain flip has been doing very well. That's one that Celini is actually market making on.
00:56:03.234 - 00:56:10.250, Speaker B: If we're going to talk about longer tail coins, can we get a little alpha on puff before we go to. To pasta?
00:56:10.442 - 00:56:11.794, Speaker D: I forgot about the pasta.
00:56:11.874 - 00:56:58.976, Speaker A: We did get requests. So if you guys like meth, and you've been following the channel and we talk about meth a lot, and that's been fantastic, there's a meme coin around meth that is trying to do something unique that I've been advising and talking to the team, and it's starting on Monday, so in a couple days you'll be able to kick off Puff's journey. We see this tweet that the team put out that you can mint a potion with meth. Once you mint a potion that gets converted to puff, and then the games begin, puff is going to be out in the wild. You can subscribe on l one. And I think that I hate meme coins. I've said it before.
00:56:58.976 - 00:57:19.274, Speaker A: I think they catch attention and they're pointless. This could be a new paradigm. I know that another phrase get used a lot, but it'll be interesting so people can take a look if you want to get an NFT. It looks pretty cool. So we'll have more to say in the future.
00:57:19.894 - 00:57:29.354, Speaker C: I'm a big puff supporter. After Jordy pvP, ohm, and Luna and Hex, I'm curious what his iteration will look like.
00:57:31.254 - 00:57:41.954, Speaker A: You know, it's like, easy throwing punches and, like, throwing shade at. And sometimes you got to just, like, get in the arena. So, yes.
00:57:43.814 - 00:57:45.434, Speaker D: We'Re all in the arena.
00:57:48.134 - 00:57:55.926, Speaker A: Cool. Do we have any, any other lovely questions or should we head to our pasta. I think before we go to the.
00:57:55.950 - 00:58:04.724, Speaker C: Pasta, I just wanted to say this comment, maybe crack up. Manta, wait. This guy's from lost in Co. He says, amanda, wait. You can always rebrand to bybit. Smart chain.
00:58:08.984 - 00:58:12.684, Speaker B: Wait, where is that? I need to pull that up. Oh, my God. That's brilliant.
00:58:15.104 - 00:58:16.644, Speaker A: BSC is a winner.
00:58:19.464 - 00:58:20.724, Speaker D: Lost in code.
00:58:21.584 - 00:58:39.552, Speaker A: BNB has been doing pretty well lately, actually. I guess, like, exchanges should be doing well just during this kind of market. It looks like. The volumes are insane. We had a biggest volume day ever for Salini just yesterday. We traded twelve. Twelve point five billion in 24 hours.
00:58:39.608 - 00:58:40.680, Speaker C: Are you serious?
00:58:40.872 - 00:58:41.604, Speaker A: Yes.
00:58:44.144 - 00:58:44.792, Speaker C: Christ.
00:58:44.928 - 00:58:53.244, Speaker A: I would say we are so back, but we've never actually been here before, so I don't know where we are. We're not back. We're just somewhere new. I don't know what's going on. So it's a new paradigm.
00:58:54.874 - 00:58:56.134, Speaker D: Yeah. Where we're going.
00:58:58.634 - 00:59:01.218, Speaker A: Aggressively. We got a staff up.
00:59:01.266 - 00:59:02.814, Speaker B: You have spots for interns.
00:59:03.394 - 00:59:23.270, Speaker A: No, we need people that have done a few things because they need to get in line. We, you know, we're trying to spin up. Backpack is an interesting exchange. It's been doing very well. We announced the raise we participated in. There's no token. So they're trying to do it the traditional way, which I respect as well.
00:59:23.270 - 00:59:30.954, Speaker A: And so there's a few exchanges. We're looking on board. And so think you. Maybe we can get you back in the.
00:59:31.334 - 00:59:37.754, Speaker B: If you need a bus boy or an intern, Vicki can be the best way. I can be the intern and Tyche can be the researcher.
00:59:39.254 - 00:59:40.074, Speaker A: All right.
00:59:41.854 - 00:59:43.286, Speaker B: We'Re all on Jordy's payroll.
00:59:43.310 - 00:59:49.544, Speaker C: You guys, I saw backpack volume at, like, $3 trillion the other day.
00:59:51.244 - 00:59:51.884, Speaker B: Okay?
00:59:51.964 - 00:59:54.184, Speaker A: I don't know. Maybe there's some typos going.
00:59:57.684 - 01:00:02.184, Speaker C: Anyway. No shade, just. Interesting, interesting, interesting.
01:00:02.604 - 01:00:08.024, Speaker A: All right, guys, let's do pasta. We'll talk more alts next time. Let's do pasta.
01:00:08.364 - 01:00:15.084, Speaker B: That makes me hungry. Brad just pulled up. I'm like, I haven't had breakfast yet. I'm starving. I might get some spaghetti.
01:00:16.944 - 01:00:24.720, Speaker A: I have to make pasta every day. My daughter is obsessed with pasta. She always wants spaghetti with salt. Nothing else. Just salt. I don't know what's wrong with these. No, no.
01:00:24.720 - 01:00:25.856, Speaker A: No butter. It's just salt.
01:00:25.920 - 01:00:26.724, Speaker B: I don't know.
01:00:28.104 - 01:00:32.364, Speaker A: All right, let's kick off pasta taiki first up.
01:00:32.864 - 01:00:57.892, Speaker D: All right, Justin, can you pull up? It's a video. It's kind of a follow up to the Suzu episode if you can full screen it. So this is Alex Weiss, Weiss City. And this is from last cycle, when bitcoin was at basically the same price, like, 62k, you know, and there's, like. There was, like, a 6% dip in the bitcoin markets, and. Can we just play the video real quick?
01:00:57.988 - 01:01:18.016, Speaker B: And I don't know why they're doing this at 02:00 a.m. It's kind of crazy. I don't know, man. It's crazy. Let me look at how many millions I lost. So he's in the hospital trading right here.
01:01:18.200 - 01:01:18.816, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:01:18.920 - 01:01:22.284, Speaker B: Oh, it's not so bad now. I only lost 14 million.
01:01:26.224 - 01:01:27.112, Speaker D: There's, like, a sick.
01:01:27.208 - 01:01:31.134, Speaker B: I think I was down, like, 21 million or something when I really nuked.
01:01:32.194 - 01:02:04.728, Speaker D: Yeah, we don't watch the whole video, but it was, like, just. This is, like, the crypto lore, right? Where I think in Q one of 2021, he, like, weiss, became the main character, just showing off his p and L. And then he got liquidated, I think, or he lost a bunch. And then we heard, like, radio silence for a few weeks, and then when he came back, he's in the hospital because of some health issues, and then he's doing some live streams. Like, you know, this is. You know, this is what we need to see this cycle. We need new main characters.
01:02:04.728 - 01:02:06.284, Speaker D: Live streaming from the hospital.
01:02:06.944 - 01:02:09.928, Speaker A: Yeah, he got COVID, and, like, he was, like, trading.

But I don't know if you guys remember in the peak of the, the bottom of the bear market, hamster racing blew up as a thing on Twitter. It was like the only thing you could do on chain that was at all fun. And Fubar here says he's dedicating this bull run to CK. CK was one of the hamsters.
01:04:57.240 - 01:05:00.056, Speaker B: He was a notorious loser. He was a trash hamster.
01:05:00.200 - 01:05:01.608, Speaker C: If any of you guys played this.
01:05:01.656 - 01:05:13.244, Speaker B: Rocky was the winner. And it actually came out that all of the hamster races were pre recorded, and it was all just rigged. So we all got rugged in the end. But it was, it was great thing for the bear market.
01:05:14.304 - 01:05:16.304, Speaker D: This is for the. This is for Ck.

01:05:56.876 - 01:06:12.088, Speaker A: So he's climbing the pyramid. He's like, finally, blast is out. We can claim our points, convert to dollars, and the Ponzi is done. And then it zooms out and there's like multiple massive pyramid coming. So the game is just started. You're not done.
01:06:12.176 - 01:06:13.684, Speaker C: You're not going to claim points.

01:07:32.770 - 01:07:44.978, Speaker C: It was looking like we're going to break down, actually from 50k. But then, you know, Larry Fink found two yards of capital to fire back. So. Yeah, good.
