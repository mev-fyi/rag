00:00:00.400 - 00:00:07.233, Speaker A: Kind of drives the decision making there. Like what, what are the aspects that you are looking at that make you say this is, this is going to.
00:00:07.249 - 00:00:39.745, Speaker B: Run number one, you need to kill all of your brain cells, right? You have to, you have to become fully retarded. Like it's just, it's just a game. And I think like selling like some people get, come in, make a 50% return and leave, sure you can do that. You will lose because risk return wise there's probably an 80% chance that, let's say a 90% chance that coin goes to zero. So expected value wise you should be only going in if you expect to hold beyond the 10x. So one lesson I've learned is if you're scaling into something, scale into the will.
00:01:00.465 - 00:01:20.729, Speaker A: Gm everybody. I think it's one of the best M's. One of, one of the most G's of M's this week. Obviously we are all post election here and I guess you know, regardless of the political side in terms of crypto, the outcome is universally positive.
00:01:20.897 - 00:01:33.865, Speaker C: Well, did Pennsylvania GCR not come through for everybody? All steady lads viewers, you know, that followed Pennsylvania gcr. I called it last week the Trump win and bitcoin all time highs before episode 68 and here we are.
00:01:34.245 - 00:01:44.293, Speaker A: Yeah, you managed to flip flop a couple times, Kamala. Who's gonna win? But your final prediction just before the end, that that's when the, the GCRness matters the most.
00:01:44.389 - 00:01:45.585, Speaker D: GCRness.
00:01:46.725 - 00:01:56.755, Speaker A: Yeah. And so Justin, apparently like you've been getting some more praise on Twitter lately. Like your people on Twitter, you're starting to feel like a different pulse towards you.
00:01:57.055 - 00:02:18.499, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm getting a lot of engage. I mean just look at this tweet. This is, I'm getting a ton of engagement. So this had 45 likes. Just call it circling back to my study lives predictions which is like very nice. Then when I took down meme coins on October 25th, this got 105 likes here. Just talking about how goat was just another rotation and it's just nice to see when you get these things right.
00:02:18.499 - 00:02:22.203, Speaker C: People like really love to bandwagon you. Everyone's a fair weather fan.
00:02:22.339 - 00:02:27.779, Speaker D: What do you mean? You're right, dude. Go is like near all time highs. You're temporarily right for like three hours.
00:02:27.827 - 00:02:29.667, Speaker C: Just feel that it, that it's over, right?
00:02:29.731 - 00:02:45.465, Speaker A: You could, you can feel it. And I think like the, you know, the 45 likes. Justin, you remind me of the Pepe there. You know the, there's a guy who says this one's doing numbers, you got four likes and one bookmark, so.
00:02:45.845 - 00:02:49.065, Speaker C: Well, obviously I'm 30 years old with no baby, so.
00:02:50.765 - 00:03:28.887, Speaker A: Even better. So I think one of the things everyone's talking a lot about is poly market because they front man the whole mainstream media in terms of calling the election. I think at some point it was 97% before election battle swing states have been called not bad. We have the story of the French trader that has made, I think like 20, 20, $30 million off of banning on Trump. He made so much money and caused such a stir that apparently the French government is considering banning Polymarket now. Did you guys see this?
00:03:28.991 - 00:03:40.799, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, just classic move from the French. One person does well and has an outstanding return, so the whole thing has to be banned and no fun for everybody. God forbid a French national does well.
00:03:40.927 - 00:04:11.059, Speaker A: There was a, There was a funny tweet as well on, on like the French wife of, of the trader. You know, before the outcome, the French wife says, like, you know, this is your stupid trumpet. And then afterwards we have the, the communist bunny saying, this is our common financial betting outcome now. So hero, hero made overnight. Uh, good for him. I think in terms of his methodology. I think he tried to run his own tweets.
00:04:11.059 - 00:04:20.923, Speaker A: So basically he, he tried to ask people what their neighbor was gonna vote instead of what they were gonna vote. What do you guys think of this approach here? Was. Was this clever?
00:04:21.019 - 00:04:31.923, Speaker C: Well, thank you. This kind of reminds me of who is. There's a meme coin trader that you've interviewed several times that runs his own Google Ads to see what ads get the most engagement and then buys those memes. I guess this is somewhat akin to that, right?
00:04:31.979 - 00:04:32.619, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:04:32.707 - 00:04:32.931, Speaker A: He.
00:04:32.963 - 00:04:58.307, Speaker D: It's. It's Alex Good. You know, like, for example, you know, Sam Altman was getting lots of clicks, so he needed like Long World coin and stuff. I'm not sure if this is applicable or comparable, but yeah, like, I don't think anyone, like the majority of people don't. Don't want to admit that they're voting for Trump, right? So it's like, oh, if you ask someone, oh, like who do you think that guy's going to vote for? It's like, oh, yeah, Trump. And then, you know, maybe that's like a more accurate measure. But yeah, prediction markets probably much better than polls.
00:04:58.307 - 00:05:04.919, Speaker D: I mean, hopefully Poly Market continues to, you know, gain market share, mind share and yeah, that's pretty, Pretty good.
00:05:05.007 - 00:05:33.665, Speaker A: Crazy stuff, Crazy stuff. I mean, personally, I did enter the day quite long positioned for a Trump victory. There were Two major signs, like anyone who knows trading knows Alpha already knew that he was going to win. It was like very obvious to us. I had no doubt in my mind there were two signals that kind of confirmed it. One was Katy Perry, apparently a you if you bring up this tweet here, that's Alpha. The Katy Perry curse is undefeated.
00:05:33.665 - 00:06:07.531, Speaker A: So we have the, you know, the pictures from last cycle here with SPF and co. He appeared at that Harris rally just before election. So she was, I would say 75% and then the last 25% that just made me go all in. You know, our boy at cnbc, I don't know if you guys saw, but Jim Kramer, Mr. Jim Kramer was saying the action is showing that people think Kamala is going to win. I mean those two. Come on, Taran, like you must have gone all in when you saw that.
00:06:07.603 - 00:06:11.135, Speaker B: All in, bro. Only wonderful in goat. That's all that matters.
00:06:11.755 - 00:06:12.535, Speaker C: Yes.
00:06:14.955 - 00:06:30.663, Speaker A: Let'S, let's quickly intro Taron because maybe, you know, our viewers need to get the background here. So Taran, I've known you, I've known you, I've known you for a while. I know what kind of chad you are. But maybe give our listeners just a quick intro of your background and what you're doing.
00:06:30.759 - 00:07:03.135, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I run a company called Sticks. We are OTC traders. So most of the audience, I mean a lot of the infra coins that you guys trade, they're all venture backed. So a lot of the team members and a lot of the vcs, they're locked and they're usually motivated sellers when those coins hit the market after the investing periods. So we trade them before they get to market and we help early investors as well as team members get liquidity. And most of these old coins trade at pretty steep discounts to what the spot price is.
00:07:03.135 - 00:07:06.255, Speaker B: And I like trading memes.
00:07:07.275 - 00:07:48.655, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean these are two topics I think our listeners are going to love because one is, you know, just the general dynamics of, of most of these coins and the other one is the meme coin market, which I know you're plugged into and you actually are properly in the weeds on. So guys, let's, let's look at some of the price action. I mean it's, it's been very eventful, a lot of swings, obviously mostly to the upside. We'll look at the current prices right now. Bitcoin's all time highs. I mean we're, we're touching 76, which is pretty epic to see Eth showing signs of life. 28:50 Right now, Solana is picking up and a lot of coins I think that, you know, don't have unlocks going on right now are doing quite well.
00:07:48.655 - 00:07:53.175, Speaker A: Even Cardano. Your coin, Justin.
00:07:55.235 - 00:07:57.387, Speaker C: My favorite, Bitcoin. L2.
00:07:57.571 - 00:07:57.891, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:07:57.923 - 00:08:10.007, Speaker C: Jordy, I wanted to get your thoughts on dogecoin. I know you had some referenced it in some tweets here. Like, do you think what Elon's doing with the Department of Government Efficiency if. If he actually creates that department? This is a big boon for Doge.
00:08:10.111 - 00:08:40.233, Speaker A: I think so. I mean, I was very clear on the downside. I think people started front running Doge, which is why, you know, its performance post election is not getting insane. It was already running really hot. We saw it go from 12 cents to like, you know, 18 cents even before. If Trump had lost and Elon kind of would not have the influence that he's, you know, going to have, I think Doge would just like, just be dead. But now it's going to have signs of life and I don't know, Taron, I mean, this is kind of your territory.
00:08:40.233 - 00:08:54.257, Speaker A: My feeling is like it's going to do well, but not crazy because it's a bit of the fool me once, you know, shame on me. Shame on you, boy. George, George Bush number two here. But what do you think?
00:08:54.401 - 00:09:31.695, Speaker B: I think, I mean, Doge, you. If you talk to a normal person about meme coins, outside of crypto, the only coin they pro, all of them probably know is Doge, right? So Doge winning is good for all the other memes because it sets a higher barrier. I don't know. I mean, if, if crypto's got to be around three to five years from now, if all like meme coins are going to be around, I think Doge still remains the biggest one. But you were right when you said, okay, if Trump had lost, downside would be pretty, pretty big on Doge. Almost every single meme, right. There's quite a few which you had to watch very closely.
00:09:31.695 - 00:09:38.179, Speaker B: But hey, I mean, Doge is the winner. I think it remains the winner. I don't think we see it dethroned at all. Like, that's, it's at a different level.
00:09:38.227 - 00:09:38.815, Speaker A: Right?
00:09:39.315 - 00:09:40.539, Speaker B: All time high.
00:09:40.707 - 00:10:00.811, Speaker A: Congrats to Elon in general. He. He went all in. A lot of people are saying he was going to be pretty effed if the Dems won. Like, he might deal with a lot of problems. He went from that, like the delta. Forget the delta of like, like, you know, bitcoin, just the delta of like, Elon's life between like losing and winning is pretty massive.
00:10:00.811 - 00:10:12.043, Speaker A: And now he's, he's obviously very close to Trump and he'll be whispering in his ear certain things. So I don't know if that's good or bad, but it's good for Elon.
00:10:12.219 - 00:10:17.505, Speaker B: I mean a boring company. I heard they were hiring dogecoin developers, so.
00:10:17.805 - 00:10:19.021, Speaker D: Oh, interesting.
00:10:19.213 - 00:10:22.061, Speaker C: But there are dogecoin developers. I don't know.
00:10:22.093 - 00:10:38.341, Speaker B: So some, some developers they wanted to hire. It was initially going to be about. This was last year as well. They were still hiring. They wanted to implement like a payment system in Tesla or Doge and they wanted to be native settlement on Doge itself because it's just a copycat of, of bitcoin.
00:10:38.493 - 00:10:39.305, Speaker D: Interesting.
00:10:40.005 - 00:11:11.059, Speaker A: But I mean let's, let's talk a little bit about the, the election trading. I was, you know, I turned 40. I should not be doing this, but I did pull, you know, whatever all nighter in Asia. It was like an all day or I don't even know what it was. I gave a little bit of my predictions. If you scroll down we can see maybe the tweet that I had. The experience I have with these things is that liquidity generally flows first to the biggest coin because that's where the sharp money can put a lot of money to work.
00:11:11.059 - 00:11:58.645, Speaker A: So if you know that Trump is wing, what's the first thing you do if you have a lot of money? Even if you have like a thousand bucks, you might put the highest beta thing and buy a call option somewhere. But if you're trying to put nine, ten figures to work, you're just going to buy bitcoin. So the first move that really showed what was happening was the bitcoin move I think ran very hard and once that happened, I think the bitcoin move of like 12% spread. So I kind of predicted 74 win, 65 loss seemed to be quite, quite close to what happened. And then my ETH prediction was that eth actually is, is a higher beta because Trump, you know, is quite aligned with Ethereum. He's doing stuff on the chain clearly. And also just, you know, it seems to be a bit of a beaten down catch up move.
00:11:58.645 - 00:12:13.855, Speaker A: So we did get the catch up move. I, I thought about 2800 and we're nicely above that now. So that went well. Karen, did you, did you trade through or were you, were you just watching?
00:12:14.795 - 00:12:44.549, Speaker B: I actually followed through on your easting. So I sold my spice and I went to the best equator. I knew Pepe. Pepe's pulled A good move. I mean we, we were spot long Doge to be honest. If you look at the Doge market cap itself, it put on, you know, it bottomed out this week at 21 billion and it ran all the way to 31 billion. You know, this coin put, put $10 billion in market cap in less than, I don't know, 72 hours.
00:12:44.549 - 00:12:51.941, Speaker B: So it shows like, you know, that downside was definitely real. Yeah, people were going pretty hard into Doge.
00:12:52.093 - 00:13:13.045, Speaker D: Like for me it's so funny because Taren, he, you know, he sees all the OTC data and I think that makes him a little bit nihilistic. And now he's just like, he only trades memes and I feel like that's kind of like the story of the cycle, right? It's like we all try so hard to like do analysis and then we just reach a conclusion that, you know, like memes move the best. So let's just trade memes. Is that kind of your journey?
00:13:13.345 - 00:13:55.545, Speaker B: I think so. You know, start of the cycle. I was like everyone else trading altcoins, you know, ti Injective and sei even they ran pretty hard. But, but then, you know, earlier this year it was so frothy. Athena, you know, Hazel Shielding Athena, like 20 billion plus. And at the same time we were trading OTC pretty steep 80 plus percent discounts. So if insiders were willing to sell, you know, long, long duration positions for like 80 to 90% off, that just meant means holding, you know, those positions, those olds in spot was just, there was no risk return there at all.
00:13:55.545 - 00:14:05.681, Speaker B: So you had to trade whatever asset you could get the biggest amount of edge in. And that's when I really started trading memes. And it was early this year so I was a bit late to the party.
00:14:05.793 - 00:14:48.105, Speaker A: Yeah, let's talk a little bit about the, you know, the value of doing secondary sales and you know, the work that you do. Because I've been quite vocal, I don't like these like hugely negative sloping forward curves. I think, you know, even though someone like me can make a lot of money because I understand this market structure and I know how to, you know, trade it. It's not good overall. It's not good for retail, it's not good for the charts. They're always down. And you know, when you have these insiders, like you said Taron, in my opinion, like, it's great that you're letting people de risk and like get some of this like unlocks out the way and give it to buyers that are, you know, willing to sort of take them off the market early and like you know, manage their own risk whether they're shorting perps or just holding it because you know they like the coin.
00:14:48.105 - 00:15:12.893, Speaker A: That's totally fine. Justin, you're probably familiar with founders that you know or teammates just they're, they're up 50, 100x on, on some investment. I mean you angel as well. It doesn't mean it's a bad price, it just means like you just want to de risk it because it might be like a very meaningful amount of money for you to get this like 50x and maybe it's still worth more than what you're selling it for. But like it's sort of, it's like a win win from a risk reward perspective.
00:15:12.989 - 00:15:42.431, Speaker B: Look, buyers obviously want it right? On a day to day basis we receive a lot more bids than we do asks. You know there's especially now six months ago sellers were feeling too rich, right that all of that old coins were above 10 billion. If you were launching a layer 2 you would de facto launching it at 10 billion. Right. Starkware, ZK Sync, Arbitrum, all of these were trading there. And you know buyers weren't really that interested because they knew the supply overhang. They knew how many motivated sellers there would be.
00:15:42.431 - 00:16:12.099, Speaker B: So the amount of bids were not that much. Now buyers are smarter, right? And they realize that the sellers need liquidity. They've got these like big concentrated positions that they could sell below even like the, the actual value of the coin just to get money out. If they're venture funds, they got to give money back to LPS and raise new new funds to redeploy that cash back into venture. So and team members, their cost basis is zero. Right. You could have a guy with like I don't know, 100 million in old but he hasn't got his mortgage paid off.
00:16:12.099 - 00:16:15.035, Speaker B: Right. So he just wants to cash out and pay his mortgage.
00:16:15.195 - 00:16:16.003, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:16:16.139 - 00:16:34.145, Speaker C: Have you seen any patterns that would indicate why one coin would recover from the massive dumps we've seen? Like why would Star Ware come out of this or Celestia or TIA come out of this? Like have you seen any pattern or some signals that these things might be working? Even though price action has been very poor.
00:16:35.125 - 00:17:08.647, Speaker B: TIA was a good one, right. Recently I mean there was a bunch of OTC trades like historic this year we've probably trade like between 100 and 150 million of locked here. And the thing is you just increasing cost basis. So you just need a long enough period of time to See which ones go to zero and which ones don't. But patterns wise, I don't know, I don't see stockware recovering to, to its highs. But Athena is recovering, right? And there's, there's different. You know, Athena is probably one of the big winners this cycle for insiders, right? They're still up like 25 to 30x.
00:17:08.647 - 00:17:21.319, Speaker B: So Athena versus stockware. I mean stockware has no cliff, period. Everyone's just unlocking monthly and all the holders keep selling. Right. Athena, they had a one year cliff so there's still quite a bit of time until new supply comes in.
00:17:21.407 - 00:18:00.085, Speaker A: Exactly. Like the. I'm not, I'm not a big fan of these like games of trying to rotate in and out before the unlocks happen. Like let's say like unlock is in six months and people's thesis is like oh don't worry, it's not, it's not for a really long time because they're short term traders like Eugene Ing and like the good Eugene Inc. This like trader, he, he loves these like rotation where he can get in and out. But for longer term holders, someone's going to be left holding the bag in the end. So anyway, I'm a fan of like you know, people having price discovery in secondaries and the founders that try to block secondaries and, and not allow the price discovery to happen.
00:18:00.085 - 00:18:19.505, Speaker A: I think, you know, kind of setting up for, for poor charts. We'll get into the nihilism I guess just. And like, just, just to get your pulse before we move on to that topic like, you know, ETH has shown signs of life. Maybe let's bring the ETH BTC chart up right in this moment. Are you ecstatic?
00:18:20.285 - 00:18:45.385, Speaker C: I am ecstatic and I think saying signs of life is an understatement. Possibly the understatement of the century and the understatement of steady lads history. I mean I tweeted this and I genuinely believe this. If the bottom is not in now, I think it's probably fair to capitulate at this point. I'm not, I've already, I've already sort of shared I'm holding from. I'm holding ETH until we get to 8 to 10k or 0. There's no in between for me.
00:18:45.385 - 00:18:57.657, Speaker C: But personally I think this is as clear of a bottom for ETH as, as we could hope for. I think it has to be in here. Eth's done very well since the Trump victory and I do think ETH has a ton of tailwinds.
00:18:57.761 - 00:19:10.965, Speaker A: Let's Change the five day. Instead of this like all time thing. Sorry, I. I mean the last five days there's like a. You got to really zoom in to see like the little.
00:19:11.885 - 00:19:17.429, Speaker D: Look at the hourly. Look at the hourly. Just go to the hourly. You have to zoom in. We can't zoom out. We have to zoom in.
00:19:17.517 - 00:19:20.385, Speaker A: There you now it's a proper candle.
00:19:21.725 - 00:19:31.461, Speaker D: We did say that if Trump wins, then bitcoin dominance likely tops, right? It has to be in btc. I mean, we've been calling the bottom for the longest time.
00:19:31.653 - 00:19:59.517, Speaker C: I think what people might be missing though is that all of the projects that are the most innovative project and also have faced the most regulatory scrutiny are built on Ethereum. And for me, I think that is the big sea change here is that all of these projects that had regulatory trouble that were on Ethereum are now not going to have that as far as we can tell right now. And to me, that is hugely bullish. And that, like I said, that has to be bullish. And if this isn't not just to.
00:19:59.541 - 00:20:19.395, Speaker A: You, Justin, not just to you, but also to Mrs. Jadudu, our favorite from last week, fan favorite here. 13,000 USDT profit from Ethereum. When everyone mocked Ethereum as trash, I bought it. Don't call it Ethereum. Call it God theorem. And yeah, look at this shirt.
00:20:19.395 - 00:20:28.655, Speaker A: Let's zoom in. We have a little. This is the Chad Vitalik shirt. You know, like the big muscle. Pretty epic. She went back in and she wrote it up. Good for her.
00:20:28.655 - 00:20:49.791, Speaker A: Pretty good. Like 13, 000 on only 50 eth. So she's, she's sizing conservatively but still doing well. So shout out to our girl Jidudu. Even, even Eugene, who I just mentioned, he, he had a tweet here. He's, he's coming back, back on, on the team with you, Justin.
00:20:49.863 - 00:21:32.849, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't want to undersell this for our listeners and I feel like you guys are in some ways, like, I actually think this is, this is big, right? I mean, the point of meme coins was there is the cynicism in this space where people are saying all of the good projects, you can't hold the tokens because there's regulatory uncertainty. We can't drive value to the tokens. Teams can't be working on this transparently in the US they have all these roadblocks. All of that is effectively cleared and we're still talking about memes on the show. I mean, to me that seems like we're sort of missing this key pivot point. If this isn't the pivot point in the inflection point for people to get back into what actually matters and get out of memes, which is honestly quite boring, then like, what else? What else are we really hoping for?
00:21:32.897 - 00:22:03.343, Speaker A: Right, so this is going to be, you know, one of our main topics today. We'll start with this tweet from Altcoin Psycho who has laid out what you're saying. Justin and I think me and Taiki are a bit more not sure. And we'll get Taron's take as well. But let's start with Altcoin Psycho. So he says unpopular opinion, but the new administration will be bullish for utility tokens and bearish memes will be easier to raise money and launch without complex legal funding structures. It'll be easier to add creativity to tokens.
00:22:03.343 - 00:22:36.297, Speaker A: I think that part's true. We'll see an increase in quality projects. Not sure about quality, like projects appearing out of nowhere, but he thinks it'll be, you know, potentially ICO boom type of opportunities. And he says accreditor investor laws will ease and let people kind of come in early for crowdfunding. This is sort of a little bit what you're saying, Justin. Like potentially this is the time for the real projects, not the meme projects that you so love. Let's get a couple of takes.
00:22:36.297 - 00:22:38.209, Speaker A: Taiki, how about you? What do you think?
00:22:38.297 - 00:23:07.885, Speaker D: Yeah, I, I don't think it has to be one or the other. I think I'm coming to the conclusion that like, just because Trump won doesn't mean that every defi coin is going to pump. Like most defi coins are uninvestable, untouchable. Even with Trump. I think things like AAVE will just continue to appreciate. I own a lot of aave, but I'm still also embracing like meme coins. Like I actually think that both meme coins and, you know, certain coins will do well, but I don't believe that it's bearish Meme coins.
00:23:07.885 - 00:23:26.421, Speaker D: It's pretty clear that meme coins have the best clear pod market fit. No one is going to be buying 5 billion dollar FTV coins because Trump won because it's. They think it can go to 20 billion. Maybe the past of resistance is like less, but I still think that, no, it makes sense to have like a mixed approach. I think so.
00:23:26.453 - 00:23:48.517, Speaker C: Tanky, you really think this time is different with regards to meme coins? You don't think this is just the NFT hype cycle We Saw playing out in a better vehicle. I mean, yes, these are ERC 20s or fungible tokens. So it's, it's better, right, for trading purposes. But is it fundamentally different? Right? I mean it's, it's the exact same idea, just with a different vehicle. Like what. Why is this fad going to continue longer?
00:23:48.621 - 00:24:12.109, Speaker D: I mean it's not really a fad because I mean it's continued for a very long time. If you look at meme coin infra like shitcoin infra like they print money, it's actually insane. Like Photon makes under 50 million, Dexter makes 300k a day. People just want this stuff, you know, and it does. Like I personally want utility coins to do well, but it doesn't really matter what you or I want. What matters is what the market wants. And the market wants memes.
00:24:12.109 - 00:24:22.491, Speaker D: Yeah, making a prediction that people are going to stop is like probably not correct, but I mean, but yeah, like I think makes, it makes sense to hold memes and utility coins. Like everything's going to go up, right?
00:24:22.603 - 00:24:41.105, Speaker B: It's, it's not a zero sum game, I don't think, Justin. What matters is mind share, right? What makes crypto so, I don't know, marketable to normal people is you can put a bit of money and make, potentially make a lot of money. Right? It's just, it's just a new way for them to, I don't know, feed their gambling actions.
00:24:41.235 - 00:24:46.301, Speaker C: I mean definitely though, the meme coins are zero sum, right? I mean we can at least agree on that here.
00:24:46.333 - 00:25:15.857, Speaker B: Now, individual ones, yeah. But in terms of the sector itself, it will continue growing regardless of what it is. As long as crypto continues growing, the meme coin sector will continue. There'll be new winners and new losers, that's for sure. Because these are much riskier assets than the utility coins. But now we've seen the average holder of crypto understands what FTV means. Three years ago when STEPN was at 25 billion, no one knew, right? No one knew what FDB meant.
00:25:15.857 - 00:25:56.737, Speaker B: And back then people actually believed in tech. You know the pumped up funds of last cycle were companies like Coinless Republic, Dao maker and these launch pads doing like angel deals like 5 million FTV and so on. And people cared about the tech. I don't know, putting medical records on the blockchain or I don't know, some walk to earn. Whether regardless of what it is, people thought tech meant number go up. Now they realized all of these, you know, starco is amazing tech, right? You know but it doesn't mean number go up because the, the team could screw up the token so badly that retail lost a lot of money. So the entrants that came last year, they've seen 60, 80% drawdowns on coins like Starkware.
00:25:56.737 - 00:26:02.997, Speaker B: So they just don't, don't want to bid it anymore. They just want to treat as a gamble a higher risk investment, which is what it is for them.
00:26:03.141 - 00:26:54.447, Speaker A: I think ultimately I agree with what Taron said, that it's not one of the other. These two things kind of are complementary and reminds me of this, this tweet that Matt Wong from Paradigm had. He, he has this Trojan horse and he says, you know, crypto may look like a speculative casino from the outside and it distracts from the deeper truth that there is a new financial system being hidden inside. I love this take. This is like one of my all time favorite takes and when I zoom out, this is always what I see that all the speculation is sort of like funneling activity and energy into the atoms and ultimately like we are creating these like Rails and we're seeing that with the purchase obviously from Stripe, we're seeing it from, you know, World Coin, which I consider to be a very web2 product. Using crypto as Rails to achieve, you know, like the incentive structures that they want to achieve. It's not a crypto product, it just uses it because it makes sense.
00:26:54.447 - 00:27:05.127, Speaker A: We've talked about this before, so I think like the fact that speculation for pure memes will continue, everything will do well. I don't think it's one or the other. I wouldn't get too excited, Justin, because.
00:27:05.311 - 00:27:33.131, Speaker C: So I, I just want to be clear. I was not really, I, if I came across saying it was one of the other, that was me misspeaking. What I really mean to say is which is going to outperform and where do you want to belong? And my thesis right now is that meme coins, well, I do think they will do well and the sector will grow and I do think it's possible. Doge hits all time highs at this cycle. I just don't think that's where you want to be allocated right now. I think we've seen so much growth in this sector over the last year. It's all everyone's talked about.
00:27:33.131 - 00:27:48.575, Speaker C: It's all been Solana meme coins. I think that has hit a crescendo and I think we have now a huge tailwind for the other side of the crypto space, the other, you know, side of this barbell. And so I'm not saying it's one or the other. I'm simply saying where do you want to be allocated and what's going to outperform?
00:27:48.615 - 00:28:24.285, Speaker A: I understand, but like, even from like the relative thing. So we have, I mean, Taiki, maybe you can fill me in. I might be missing a few, but we have, you know, uniswap trying to do a chain, trying to monetize Ethena. I think Wintermute just put out a proposal to turn on a fee switch. You know, Lido pumped quite a lot today. Well, not sure, but the reality is if you look at the actual revenue of some of these projects and you try to extrapolate it towards the price. So gwart, our favorite guy, he put out a tweet.
00:28:24.285 - 00:28:30.125, Speaker A: Good job, guys. Now our tokens are going to be valued off of their cash flows. Hope you're happy. Idiots.
00:28:31.625 - 00:28:53.239, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I probably look at the fundamentals more than probably a lot of people in the industry and like, unfortunately, most projects, they just like, make no money. So, like, for things like Lido, it doesn't really matter if Trump wins. I mean, eth goes up and then like the cash flow goes up. You know, it. It gives people more hopium. That, that's, that's the only difference. It gives people more hopium.
00:28:53.239 - 00:29:23.335, Speaker D: The ceiling goes higher. And Justin, you're right. You know, like ave, like, you know, these defi coins, like lido was up 40% yesterday, you know, but also goat is pumping, right? Like everything is pumping. So, you know, it's not one or the other, I think. And I know that's what you're saying, right, but there is a ceiling to all these coins because if there is a cash flow component, you can't really dream too big if you're selective. If you pick the right coins, then the risk adjusted return is much better for defi coins or whatever. But people are still going to pump memes.
00:29:23.335 - 00:29:27.119, Speaker D: It's just the reality of crypto. I've come to accept it.
00:29:27.287 - 00:29:42.647, Speaker B: It depends, Justin. If you're talking about people want to buy shit and long or if you're talking about risk return investments. Right? Risk return point of view. Yeah. I mean, of course, probably Solana is a better investment than all of these memes. Solana hit all time high market cap just now. So risk return point of view, I don't doubt it.
00:29:42.647 - 00:29:58.515, Speaker B: Most memes go to zero over time. But I'm also cynical on alts. Most alts go to zero. The supply overhang is just not enough. I can make an example of Grass, Right. So grass, we just open up Coin Market Cap. So it pumped, I know forex in the last, I don't know, a week or something.
00:29:58.515 - 00:30:24.471, Speaker B: They claim the float to be something like 25%, but in reality the float is something like 6%. Right. They've got the staking rewards of 15% which unlock over like three or four years. Out of the 10% airdrop, 2% weren't claimed. And out of the 8%, I think 40% were staked. So the real actual circulating market cap is something like 5.8 or 6%.
00:30:24.471 - 00:30:30.659, Speaker B: Right. Which is only like 150 million to $200 million market cap coin. But it's advertised at a 3 billion market cap coin.
00:30:30.747 - 00:30:50.779, Speaker A: But what does that mean from a punter's perspective? It's another one of these where it can pump for now because there's not much else. But you also have to get out quickly before the flood gets open. And you really have to monitor when these coins are going to come online. It's still a game for people that are very sophisticated, right. That kind of really track.
00:30:50.907 - 00:31:22.917, Speaker B: You have to, you have to exit these coins because is there $3 billion of demand going into this coin to, to feed the supply overhang? No, not really. I'll bet that there isn't. So to smart traders who are on the supply overhang, they just short with, I don't know, 1x leverage or whatever, over three years they'll probably win. Right? Like World Coin, it was similar. The supply overhang was just too large. Went down 80%, 80, 85% when the unlock started. So yeah, short term, keeps bumping, wouldn't short it.
00:31:22.917 - 00:31:40.581, Speaker B: And then look at the early invest, the early investors at 300x right now. Right? Two days ago they were willing to sell for like 400 million OTC. Now they're like, yeah, I know it's going up 3x. I'll take 600. Right. So that the OTC price has only gone up 50%, but the spot price has gone up 3x. So I don't know.
00:31:40.653 - 00:32:19.427, Speaker A: So. So one of the things that's been cracking me up on Twitter this week, you know, our, our lovable, our favorite lovable Adam Cochran, the, the designer of tweet threads that are 172 tweets long. Apparently he's been doing some streams and there's been some epic ones. But the one relevant here, there's this profile picture where he looks very slim. And this one says the before and after the circulating supply at launch versus after the first major Unlock. So to your point, Taran, the coin can look very different after unlock start.
00:32:19.531 - 00:32:19.795, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:19.835 - 00:32:24.695, Speaker D: Prof. Actually, question for you, Justin. I mean, given that Trump one, are you longing any utility coins?
00:32:25.155 - 00:32:57.721, Speaker C: I am, yes. I posted a little bit about my thesis on Twitter. But I think where you want to be exposed to is tokens that rely on government regulation and that being more favorable and tokens that would do well in that. And that's sort of where I think you want to be positioning right now. Tokens that are projects that have like a clear and unique value proposition, but have to have in the past struggled to get around regulation with creative, creative like legal loopholes and whatnot and offshoring. I think those projects are poised to do the most well, it's interesting.
00:32:57.753 - 00:33:15.555, Speaker D: Like, the tokens are just in the billions already. So, like, how much upside does it. Can it reasonably have? Right, that's, that's kind of how retail thinks. You know, there's like an expiration date for all these because, like, you can't really invest in these. You know, they're tradable, but not investable. I mean, that's meme coins too. I feel like it doesn't really fix the high FTV issue.
00:33:15.555 - 00:33:16.131, Speaker D: That's the problem.
00:33:16.203 - 00:33:37.035, Speaker A: So, I mean, meme coins kind of be a little bit different. Let's put this other tweet from Matt. Matt had one this week, a more recent one that I think this is deep here. He says the game theory for traditional assets is to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others agree. Right. Like this is the traditional thing. We hear Warren Buffett, et cetera.
00:33:37.035 - 00:34:11.555, Speaker A: He says the game theory for monetary assets is to get to the coordination point first, because what you're buying is not a fundamental cash flow that you want to get at a cheap FDD price. What you're buying is the reflexive nature of monetary assets. Monetary assets. Of course, we're mainly talking about things like Bitcoin, potentially Ethereum, maybe some meme coins that, know, start to snowball and become like elite meme coins. I was with you at Tehran last week in Dubai and talking to some of these, like family office guys. Like, these are like, just getting into crypto. They have no clue what they're doing.
00:34:11.555 - 00:34:30.964, Speaker A: And the guy's like, yes, yes, I, I got some meme coins. I, I just get the blue chip ones. I have a whiff. There's like one more he had. So this guy, like, why is he, why is he buying whiff? It's because it's just this. It's Just like reflexive nature. It just established itself as like a multi billion coin.
00:34:30.964 - 00:34:46.572, Speaker A: And now if you think that like there's 20, 30 coins that people have every day or that they look at and they've managed to crack, you know, within like the consciousness that's just like where money flows because new people coming in, it just goes to that. Right.
00:34:46.628 - 00:34:48.084, Speaker B: My mind shares the word.
00:34:48.204 - 00:34:48.460, Speaker A: Right.
00:34:48.492 - 00:35:09.865, Speaker B: Why would light was a curse coin? Why would someone new come and bid an ethereum striking protocol? First of all, he probably doesn't even know what staking means. Right. And then he's like, okay, the dog has a hat. He's probably going to bid that because it captures mindshare. But the people bidding lido, they probably already hold with. Right. They probably already hold some meme exposure.
00:35:09.865 - 00:35:19.541, Speaker B: And they are more sophisticated traders, I would say now rather than last cycle you had actual like retail buying, you know, supply of defi coin spot. I remember. Yeah.
00:35:19.733 - 00:35:53.135, Speaker A: I mean I would say like my point is even less about how good the meme is and like, oh, it's a hat or whatever. Let's move on from the hats. It's just the fact that price gets reflective for these assets that don't have a fundamental cash flow. The monetary premium is all the premium. Right. So for these assets, like just being a certain size and a certain distribution, you've kind of won the right to just get the inflows just by default. And I think there's some cabals that try to artificially create this.
00:35:53.135 - 00:36:12.509, Speaker A: I won't mention like specific coins, but obviously if you have a hundred million dollars and you're willing to by force create an asset that's worth $2 billion just by buying the hell out of it, that unfortunately like seems to be like a hack or you can get like an inorganic, you know, attention that.
00:36:12.587 - 00:36:20.409, Speaker C: Are you, are you actually seeing that? Jordy, you're seeing people put up tens to hundreds of millions of dollars to make an asset a thing.
00:36:20.577 - 00:36:28.833, Speaker A: Yeah. Not like a single person, but like within like a telegram group or something like that. Like of course, you know, some of these see Taran nodding his head and it's kind of well known that some.
00:36:28.849 - 00:36:39.653, Speaker B: Of these it happens so much. It happens so much. And not, I don't know any with nine figures, but people with like kind of 2 to 10 mil, especially on Salana, they've done so many of these.
00:36:39.769 - 00:37:09.865, Speaker A: Yeah. So you know, something to consider. The good thing is, you know, for our coins in general as an industry in general, you can generalize and just say that right now. With ETF being on the table and people being able to join in, the coordination point, or at least for majors is there. And I think it's compelling. I think that's why the whole market's ripping. And to be honest, like, if Ethereum didn't rip, I think all these alts would, would not be moving much.
00:37:09.865 - 00:37:29.405, Speaker A: The real money that is the community money is, is ETH money because everybody has to have it. Everybody has some bitcoin, like at this point, there's like some huge whales and there's some die hards. But when, if, if it was just bitcoin pumping, I don't think alts would pump much or maybe like even at all.
00:37:29.525 - 00:37:46.607, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. I think eth. Eth pumping creates the most amount of wealth effect for like the degenerate community, like crypto, Twitter, essentially. So the fact that eth is up, I mean, it's almost at 2900 is really good. Hopefully. I mean, I think it'll keep going up, but it is community money.
00:37:46.711 - 00:37:47.183, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:47.279 - 00:38:02.399, Speaker B: I mean, that decoupling that we, everyone was talking about in 2021, where, I mean, for the last six, seven, eight years, you could describe Bitcoin goes up, money flows into ETH that, that's already decoupled because bitcoin's outperformed eth to see it, which is crazy.
00:38:02.527 - 00:38:03.119, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:38:03.167 - 00:38:13.079, Speaker D: But maybe the cycle, it's eth goes up and then finally, like alts show signs of life. You know, maybe people skip bitcoin because, you know, the djs, they don't own bitcoin.
00:38:13.207 - 00:38:15.031, Speaker B: You know, they don't know who owns bitcoin.
00:38:15.103 - 00:38:15.775, Speaker A: It's big people.
00:38:15.815 - 00:38:22.115, Speaker B: Right. If you're going to have like, I don't know, 100 to $500 million portfolio and then buying bitcoin makes sense.
00:38:22.415 - 00:39:02.703, Speaker A: Yeah. And those people, like, if they make an, an extra 20% on their money, like if Michael Sailor makes an extra billion dollars, it's not like it's going to spread anywhere else. You know, he's just, maybe he'll, he'll, he'll buy some more like wooden ships for his background. But, you know, it's. Maybe those guys that make those ships will do well and not, not anybody else. So just to wrap up the E thing, I am optimistic that we'll get a bit of a coordination kind of momentum going, not just because of the Katy Perry thing, but also we are negotiating, you know, with Vitalik right now. Vitalik, if you're out there, probably you're not, but if you are.
00:39:02.703 - 00:39:06.991, Speaker A: Yeah, we're Trying to get Vitalik on in on the ETH piece.
00:39:07.023 - 00:39:44.019, Speaker C: The one last question I wanted to ask you guys was, you know, I try not to think too much about the four year cycle process and I think it, you know, it's played out, but it's hard to imagine it continuing to play out in perpetuity. But it does strike me as interesting that everything this cycle has played out as it did four years ago, where BTC does really well. And then at the time, back then we had defi tokens doing really well in ETH stalling. And everyone's saying just own defi and bitcoin. And now everyone's saying things like just don't soul slash memes and bitcoin. And it just strikes me as very reminiscent of what happened four years ago. And I'm not one of these people that thinks everything happens in the same four year timeline in crypto.
00:39:44.019 - 00:39:47.003, Speaker C: But it also wouldn't surprise me if that's, that's what's happening.
00:39:47.139 - 00:40:14.311, Speaker D: Yeah, it's, it's so interesting because I think December 2020, everyone said, oh, alts are dead. Bitcoin dominant 70%. DeFi coins were down 90, ETH was down 50% from all time highs. And then I think January 3rd or something, ETH went up 30% or something. I was like, I was like a disbelief. So I can definitely see something like that happen. Of course I want that to happen as a ETH holder and whatnot, but maybe it's similar, right? Everyone thinks alter that ETH is dead and then we just start ripping and then everyone has to chase.
00:40:14.423 - 00:40:38.989, Speaker B: But I've heard this so many times over the last six months and I coins outperformed eth. It's just been such a terrible coin to bid. Like everyone holds ETH, right? Everyone who was around in 2021 holds ETH and I still hold ETH. I capitulated some yesterday, but I don't know, everyone's been saying that all year and it's just been doing pretty shitty.
00:40:39.077 - 00:40:56.243, Speaker A: I mean, let's talk about what you've been rotating into. John, just out of curiosity, before we go to pasta, I know that you take some sizable meme coin bets. What kind of drives the decision making there? Like what, what are the aspects that you are looking at that make you say this is, this is going to.
00:40:56.259 - 00:41:47.989, Speaker B: Run number one, you need to kill all of your brain cells, right? You have to, you have to become fully retarded. Like it's just, it's just a game. And I think like selling like some People get come in, make a 50%, make a 50% return and leave right now. Sure you can do that. You will lose because risk return wise, there's probably an 80 chance that, let's say a 90 chance that coin goes to zero. So expected value wise, you should be only going in if you expect to hold beyond the 10x, right? So one lesson I've learned is if you're scaling into something, scale into the winners, right? It doesn't matter what the chart looks like because end of the day, even if it's a high market cap, coins to like, I don't know, 50 million, 100 million, right? So the upside is real. So Goat was one of the only refreshing new coins I've seen in a while.
00:41:47.989 - 00:42:20.315, Speaker B: I think the last one was whiff, right? I mean, whiff still wasn't as refreshing because bonk had come before whiff. But go, you know, all the VCs, all of this here I've been talking about was AIX crypto. And the AI coins obviously did really well. But go, you got this new meme coin launched by someone and Mark Andreessen is talking about it, right? Terminal of truth. This is like, I don't know, some AI Twitter run by AI. And yeah, I mean this was a 50 million market cap. People were like, oh, it's super expand.
00:42:20.315 - 00:42:59.061, Speaker B: Like it's a 50 million shitter, right? You need like 10 million, 10 to 20 million in real buy side interest to send it to 500 million. So the upside was cute. So scaling into these, if you've got like, I don't know, you know, around six to seven figure portfolio, it's probably the best return you can expect in crypto right now. But yeah, the risk is real and you have to treat these as individual venture bets. And also, I mean like I sold my ETH to buy Pepe, right? Is it rotated into an ETH beta meme? Obviously. ETH, I think ETH Apple phone Pepe over the last 12 hours. So the Pepe isn't really caught up that much.
00:42:59.173 - 00:42:59.685, Speaker A: That's for me.
00:42:59.725 - 00:43:23.893, Speaker C: I want to ask you, you said that you know, like bet on the winners, which makes sense. I'm curious though, when, when you stop being interested in something. So goats almost at a billion now we've talked in the show how these memes seem to putter out in the one to $3 billion range. That's sort of where they top out and then they fade more or less into obscurity for now at least. So like, when is Goat no longer worth the risk? Reward for you at a billion, I.
00:43:23.909 - 00:43:47.501, Speaker B: Think it's the Reward is a 5x from here risk is 50% down. Right. Ratio is still pretty attractive here. I mean, last cycle I saw ship go from 1 billion to, I don't know, 12, 13 billion or something in like a week. You know, doge went from 5 billion to like 85 billion in I don't know, I don't know how long it was. It was like a very short period of time. Right.
00:43:47.501 - 00:44:11.671, Speaker B: So when something goes viral, and if it really goes viral, it can, it can be parabolic, regardless of what price you're at. Because end of the day, what's, what matters is mind share. Right. You got, you, you got real traders. Even like Nachi, this, this Twitter account he put, I don't know, I think it was 13 or $14 million in soul into it on a dex. Right. It wasn't even on, on exchange.
00:44:11.671 - 00:44:17.871, Speaker B: Right. He scaled into it and yeah, you got traders like those who are very profitable traders buying these.
00:44:17.983 - 00:44:35.837, Speaker C: You're thinking is you want to, you're looking at these things as they're going to hit escape velocity when crypto does well and they're going to actually do as well as what we've seen in the past. And your thesis isn't that this is like the hot ball of crypto money that's getting moved around from meme coin to meme coin. You're actually in it for the, let's say medium term probably.
00:44:35.941 - 00:44:53.203, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, I think that's a good representation. End of the day, like it comes down to risk reward ratios. Each individual meme is probably zero sum game, but the market as a whole is going to keep growing like Jordy said. So yeah, you need to, you need to allocate your attention to it if you're trading anything.
00:44:53.299 - 00:44:53.531, Speaker A: Right.
00:44:53.563 - 00:45:02.971, Speaker B: I trade the majors often, but, you know, I'm not playing with 100 mil or like 50 mil. Then I would probably just trade majors.
00:45:03.043 - 00:45:28.857, Speaker A: Yeah. Just to wrap up on Goatsia Stack, you know, you, like, you're, you've also been tracking this. So you, you, you like. I love your tweets when you're like, you know, the charts going back up. So it's funny again, it's so funny. He has been changing the tweets, so he's been adding images and those were kind of janky, but they're getting a little bit more interesting, maybe we can bring up. But basically like the AI is now using an image generator as well, so it's giving us a bit more than the Boring.
00:45:28.857 - 00:45:32.217, Speaker A: The tweets were getting a bit boring, right? Like now we're getting a bit more juice.
00:45:32.401 - 00:45:52.815, Speaker D: Yeah. Honestly, I don't really think people think the tweets themselves are funny anymore. It's only funny if the coin is pumpy, honestly. But I guess the idea is that as AI tech gets better over time, it's going to start to produce better content. So some AI agents are posting images, they're making videos, they're making songs.
00:45:53.675 - 00:45:54.443, Speaker A: What is this?
00:45:54.539 - 00:46:01.411, Speaker D: My goss dad is a self sucker? This doesn't really resonate with anybody, I don't think. Maybe a few people, but it's got.
00:46:01.443 - 00:46:03.375, Speaker A: Even less likes than Justin's tweet.
00:46:03.755 - 00:46:23.691, Speaker D: I know a hundred likes. It's amateur hour. I don't know, I, I, I just feel like, I mean I, I'm a, I'm a pleb, right? I'm a mid curve pleb. Like I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, but I, I just feel like it's kind of this idea of gut feel. I think Taran said this. But you know, you just see it, it resonates and you just like go in because the upside is insane. So it's just, you just have to embrace it.
00:46:23.723 - 00:46:53.875, Speaker B: I think you have to be dialed in, man. Some of these meme, Meme Coin guys, they are, they don't sleep right. They've got charts open, you know. You know, I go, I go to Dubai quite often. That's, that's Meme Coin city. Right? You got these people like running Meme coins as a different like operation, you know. One guy I know, he launches so many Meme coins, he's got like a 40, 30, 35 person team, like fulfillment team, content creation team, social media team.
00:46:53.875 - 00:46:55.995, Speaker B: You have to be really dialed in.
00:46:56.415 - 00:47:34.661, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, you have the people creating and then you have the people consuming and you know, I would love to get to a bit of a fair launch situation better than the current ones where you can create an and like maybe get like a fixed supply, like a 10% but not like snipe 90% or you know, do like the full thing. There's different people working on different launch stuff, so maybe we'll see something good come out. But guys, let's, let's do a pasta of the week. I think we have some strong ones given, given all the activity going on. Justin, you wanna, I haven't seen yours yet. You wanna, you wanna share us?
00:47:34.773 - 00:47:34.973, Speaker B: So.
00:47:34.989 - 00:47:58.383, Speaker C: Yeah, Poly Market, I've been following it. I don't know if you guys have checked out the comments lately in Poly Market, but it gets heated out there. For people that are like very passionate about politics. Kamala Trump, et cetera, some of these are hilarious. So pre rich here posts, I'm telling you, the Poly Market comments are comedy. These two have a combined $200 in positions. Punk Monk with, you know, about $120.
00:47:58.383 - 00:48:17.879, Speaker C: I'm actually shocked at these prices. If I had more USDC in my wallet, I would go all in on Harris. She is likely to win Penn, Michigan and Wisconsin and that's all she needs. And then this guy with 173Trump which is like, you know, a hundred dollars of tokens here. Borrow money you broke. Fuck. I thought this was, this little exchange was hilarious.
00:48:17.879 - 00:48:21.063, Speaker C: There's a ton of these in Poly Market. This just gold if you guys want to dig them up.
00:48:21.119 - 00:48:58.841, Speaker A: I mean this kind of like a engagement, I think really like the only shot that volume market has to stay relevant because as we all know, like the four year election cycle is such a huge thing for prediction markets. It's like a hundred x bigger than all the other stuff put together. I think the fact that we're getting some of this type of, you know, emotional engagement from plebs is a sign that maybe like there'll be some next stuff to bet on. And I'm hoping for Poly Market's sake that these guys come back next week and they're, they're fighting about, you know, will, will Trump appoint Elon to treasury or something and start betting on that and that that's kind of like the bullish case.
00:48:58.953 - 00:49:30.757, Speaker C: This is actually an interesting point, Jordy. Like, I do think Polymarket can like fuel or can kind of sort of fulfill the needs of what meme coin traders are doing. So I actually bet that the Patriots would win the super bowl before the season started. They had like a half a percent chance of winning. I put $1,000 on it with a payout of $250,000. And I do think these sort of like speculative, very like long tail outcomes are where Poly Market can thrive. Because you can get a lot of people, you know, seeing these 100x wins like you see with meme coins.
00:49:30.941 - 00:49:45.133, Speaker A: I don't know. I, I don't know. I hard disagree. I think the first like the amount of time you have to wait to get some, you know, dopamine hit is just a killer right there. Like the meme what Trump or Kamala.
00:49:45.149 - 00:49:55.015, Speaker C: Will say in a speech, right? These things happen. You know, these are like one day that there's only one Day till those outcomes, you know, are realized. I think we could see more of that, is what I'm saying.
00:49:55.135 - 00:50:00.247, Speaker D: Yeah, I understand you don't like meme coins, but the. The utility of meme coins is the social aspect.
00:50:00.351 - 00:50:06.047, Speaker B: If you're short meme coins and your long betting markets for these, like, random individual.
00:50:06.111 - 00:50:08.839, Speaker C: I'm not short meme coins. I'm just not long.
00:50:08.967 - 00:50:18.803, Speaker B: Yeah, you're not long meme coins, but if you think this, like, like, you know, immediate release of dopamine that doesn't exist, like, they might as well go play blackjack.
00:50:18.899 - 00:50:19.535, Speaker A: We.
00:50:20.115 - 00:50:20.499, Speaker B: We.
00:50:20.547 - 00:50:45.785, Speaker A: We should sponsor a Justin Meme coin bag that he owns but cannot sell for, like, at least a month. Get him, like, financially incentivized with a bag on. On, like, Goat or, like, one of these meme coins. And in the back of his mind, I think there'll be, like, some, like, wheels turning and, like, recalibrating, and then he's going to have a completely different belief system around meme coins once he's a forced bag holder.
00:50:47.285 - 00:50:52.317, Speaker D: But he needs to spend it with his own money. If he gets it back for free. He doesn't. Justin needs to buy $100 of goat.
00:50:52.341 - 00:50:52.525, Speaker C: Just.
00:50:52.565 - 00:50:55.237, Speaker D: Just buy a hundred bucks of Goat and then the tweets will come out.
00:50:55.261 - 00:50:58.941, Speaker C: Gotta be something that moves the needle, though. You gotta have a real stake in these things.
00:50:59.093 - 00:51:00.453, Speaker A: Yeah, Justin's not like that guy.
00:51:00.509 - 00:51:03.517, Speaker C: I have. I have over $100 of goat. I'm just saying just to put it out.
00:51:03.541 - 00:51:04.085, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:51:04.205 - 00:51:06.751, Speaker D: Like the heck. When did. When did you buy Goat?
00:51:06.893 - 00:51:08.755, Speaker C: When we first talked about it on the show.
00:51:08.875 - 00:51:09.531, Speaker D: Okay. Interesting.
00:51:09.563 - 00:51:10.163, Speaker A: How's everything?
00:51:10.259 - 00:51:18.655, Speaker C: It's not enough I have to even think about it, you know, it's not. It's not enough for me to care. Right. I'm, like, too cautious to put enough at stake on something like Goat.
00:51:19.035 - 00:51:22.891, Speaker A: We'll get a meaningful bag of a coin and have Justin.
00:51:23.043 - 00:51:27.535, Speaker C: Yeah, Journey, send me some tokens. I'll take them. Whatever you want me to shill, I'll share.
00:51:28.715 - 00:51:32.935, Speaker A: So, Taiki, do you have a pasta?
00:51:33.635 - 00:52:02.765, Speaker D: Yeah. So I just thought this was funny because I think there's been a lot of burnout from the eth Defi developer dev. Like, just, like, just any developer in general. And there was like, this tweet where, you know, Peanut, the squirrel, they killed Peanut and the Meme coin hit. I don't even know what the market cap was, but Web3 founder in shambles, a dead squirrel has six times our market cap. I just thought this was hilarious. It's kind of like this.
00:52:02.765 - 00:52:11.341, Speaker D: It's like, oh my God, what are we doing? We're trying to build for this future. And then peanut the squirrel hits like 200 mil mark or whatever the fuck it did.
00:52:11.533 - 00:52:19.293, Speaker B: I also think this comes back. A lot of vcs, I know, they actually do personal DD on the founders to see if they're addicted to meme coins or not.
00:52:19.389 - 00:52:20.821, Speaker C: Really? Yeah.
00:52:20.853 - 00:52:51.175, Speaker B: Because a lot of these founders especially, I don't know, some edge case individual projects that, you know, didn't raise that much but like, you know, not the billion dollar plus projects because expected value for these guys, they think that token will cap out at 50, 100 million, but they're making like tens like millions from memes. So the projects overall died die down. So they're, you know, when, when these projects raise their Series A, some of these VCS are doing like personal DD if the founders are being distracted and trading memes instead.
00:52:51.525 - 00:53:15.877, Speaker D: Yeah, I've been going to like these meetup events like in person. And I've also noticed that so many founders and fund managers, you know, the front is very professional, but with their personal book, they're just like slinging meme coins. It's crazy to think about, but I guess this is kind of where we are at. Maybe we go back to utility and whatnot, but I think it's if we've gone too far, we're not coming back. The people aren't going back.
00:53:15.981 - 00:53:18.669, Speaker C: Yeah, it's interesting. That's like another disincentive to build.
00:53:18.717 - 00:53:18.901, Speaker B: Right?
00:53:18.933 - 00:53:25.237, Speaker C: Except everyone's making their money in meme coins. It's not even that their tokens aren't worth much, it's that they're making money on other tokens.
00:53:25.341 - 00:53:26.029, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:53:26.157 - 00:53:52.379, Speaker A: I think, I think it's like lose, lose. Like even if they don't make money and they have to make their thing work, they're probably just, you know, gambling. I've had a few angel tickets where the guy, you know, says like here, here's my address, send me the money. And then I, I do like a debank and I check the address. There's just like random fucking meme coins in there. This is like, you know, the address supposed to be like the treasury address. Those investments have never done well, let me tell you.
00:53:52.379 - 00:54:01.659, Speaker A: Yeah. Either way it's probably lose, lose to be distracted. Let's go to another Repasta Taran. Do you have one?
00:54:01.787 - 00:54:50.035, Speaker B: I do. It's not really that funny one, but Kobi put out this tweet. So arrogant founders and botch token launchers I've met so many arrogant founders recently who get humbled after their tokens launch and do terribly right, Especially a lot of infra coins where I don't know that have gone down 80, 90% and the arrogance just almost like disappears because they see that net worth basically quote unquote, their net worth evaporate by 80, 90% in a year. Kobe responded, he's like these founders are raising 1 to 2 billion FTV and they're probably going to launch at 5, 8. And you know, coming back to your point Justin, these also like unbeatable.
00:54:50.115 - 00:55:35.183, Speaker A: Let me just read Kobe's tweet for the audio listeners. So he says, I've had several people get angry when I pass on later stage rounds. I ask why and they get angry again and I tell them price is the issue. They say, well I raised from XYZ at 2 billion. So yeah, they're complete morons, are overpaid. So what you get these arrogant founders who basically like get validation from a VC investing and they, they think that if you get a tier 1 VC it sort of like is proof of their superiority, let's say. So you know, I've talked on my Twitter about an incident where this happened quite recently to me where speaking to a team that had raised from one of the tier one VCs and they just get so cocky.
00:55:35.183 - 00:56:02.707, Speaker A: I mean like even pre launch, like you said, they, they start to think that they've been ch, they've been the chosen ones because XYZ VC has, has, has done a big check. And like you said Taran, like the game on the streets, once you actually launch a token, it's very different. The, the scroll launch is kind of interesting there where you launch the 1.8 billion and then just the market doesn't want to buy it. It is, it is humbling for a lot of these people and you go.
00:56:02.731 - 00:56:49.175, Speaker B: Down 70% in like I don't know, three weeks. And the main, they first screwed their early investors, right? When you invest in a company, you get into a saft, right? You get given a vesting period. But the thing is these safts are not really worth more than, I don't know, toilet paper like some people call it. Because the founders, they can change vestings at any point they like because the duration of the trade is very important when judging price. If you're not early, let's say you get into something, a 500 million market cap, it could be a great trade, but if you're locked up for six years, it could end up not as good as you thought. So a lot of these founders, they changed vesting periods, like scroll, for example, initially, because my previous one with the seed round, it was like three months cliff and a 24 months linear. Right.
00:56:49.175 - 00:57:07.973, Speaker B: And then they got screwed. It was one year cliff and three year linear changed just after it launched on Binance. Right. So, and on top of that, you know, the market really just doesn't want to bid it because they had the opportunity to launch six months ago, but they kept trying to time the market, timing the market doesn't work.
00:57:08.029 - 00:57:08.197, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:08.221 - 00:57:39.639, Speaker D: And if I can say one thing too, Justin, if you can pull up my screen, like this is like, even if like Trump wins, like, I don't think these tech halts are going to pump. Right. It's like a goes down, you know, the, there's like a social pressure for Justin Drake and Dan Grad to like just resign from the foundation. I just don't think that these coins can, I mean they, they can like, you know, 2x or whatever, but it's not like people are going to be more excited about Ian because Trump won. You know, I just like don't think it's going to happen. I don't know if people have thoughts on this, but maybe this is like a sad pasta, right?
00:57:39.687 - 00:58:07.655, Speaker A: It's like, I mean, I, I, I, I don't think Eigen is a good example because for me it is one of the few kind of like good tech. Like, it's interesting. They're doing some stuff that will potentially have use cases, I think like securing certain things like ZK proofs and other things might, might end up using Eigen. I think like long term, I wouldn't choose that as the example. I think like some of the layers that, you know, lose the relevance might be a better example.
00:58:08.075 - 00:58:11.255, Speaker C: You're making me sad. I think you guys might be right.
00:58:12.925 - 00:58:14.145, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:58:14.885 - 00:58:21.941, Speaker D: I've just been so locked in on cash flow for like two years and now I'm like, you know what? Maybe it doesn't matter.
00:58:22.013 - 00:58:50.757, Speaker B: You got to kill your brain cells, bro. You can't have brain cells. I think a lot of the AI companies that don't make that much cash right now, they can't even IPO, right, because they raise so much from VCs. The VCs need an exit somehow. So I think a lot of the traditional AI companies will probably launch coins like it say crypto goes to like 5 to 8 trillion in market cap. It's going to go mainstream, even, even more mainstream. So I think a lot of These random AI companies with zero cash flow, they're probably going to launch their coin.
00:58:50.821 - 00:58:52.141, Speaker A: It's going to happen. Yeah.
00:58:52.173 - 00:59:00.665, Speaker D: Some random LLM turned goat is like a $900 million token. You know, some random AI company is going to just create tokens and say our tech is the best.
00:59:01.765 - 00:59:08.203, Speaker A: Yeah. Blue chip AI companies are in a different category and different league. Different league. Yeah.
00:59:08.379 - 00:59:14.175, Speaker B: They will actually. There'll be an IPO room, but the smaller ones, they've got nowhere to go. There is so much money and they've got to do something.
00:59:14.915 - 00:59:48.815, Speaker A: Yeah. As a vc, you don't know which one's going to be which. I mean, shout out to my boy SPF in jail listening to Steady Lads during his break between, you know, getting smothered by Puff Daddy over there. But like, you know, the investment in Anthropic, like, when the hell. When he did it and we first saw the FTX holdings, we're like, what the hell is this guy, like, putting a billion dollars into. Billion dollars into. What is this anthropic thing? Well, it turns out it's going to be the main rival to chat gbt, and it probably will be worth infinite money.
00:59:48.815 - 00:59:53.295, Speaker A: Brilliant investment, although too early for his time.
00:59:53.995 - 01:00:00.215, Speaker D: And Anthropic created goat. So SBF created the Goatsee Gospel.
01:00:00.605 - 01:00:03.265, Speaker A: SPF is responsible for Goatsy.
01:00:03.965 - 01:00:05.785, Speaker B: Raise your price targets.
01:00:07.725 - 01:00:31.763, Speaker A: I'll buy all your goats. You $3. Oh, man. All right, I'm gonna finish up the pasta. So, you know, this week before the election, Kamala got caught having some fake conversation. Probably why she lost the election is like, you know, this inauthenticity. You know, she was talking and her phone got flashed and showed that she was just using her camera app making stuff up.
01:00:31.763 - 01:00:50.335, Speaker A: So Gort had a nice pasta referencing this, which I appreciated. Here you go, Gort. I'm going to reference you twice today. So she says, oh, my God. Kamala just pretended to be a solo sticker the crowd of voters, but she accidentally showed her phone and all her ethos in Lido. Laughed my ass off.
01:00:51.155 - 01:00:53.575, Speaker D: It's pretty good. It's pretty good. It's a good pasta.
01:00:54.825 - 01:01:14.249, Speaker A: So that was a good one. Yeah, guys. I mean, listen, overall, we're in for a new ride. Obviously, the dynamics are shifting under us. I don't think the money is going to come in as quickly as the repricing is happening, so we might get some temporary corrections. But I think over the next. Over the next six months, the.
01:01:14.249 - 01:01:23.443, Speaker A: The boomers will be. Will be coming in at least through their ETFs and hopefully it's going to be good for everybody. I feel the optimism in the air again.
01:01:23.619 - 01:01:34.235, Speaker D: Boomers compete eat makes us happy alt season hopefully we'll see though. Yeah's been dreaming of an alt season for three years now we're dreaming about.
01:01:34.275 - 01:01:59.463, Speaker A: It and Vitalik come on come on the show and make everyone's dreams come true. We will end it here guys. Thanks for joining Taran thanks thanks for hopping on. Looking forward to more of your yeah I mean follow taron on Twitter everybody at Stix Co. Some some banger tweets so how you recommend following and if you're in Bangkok.
01:01:59.559 - 01:02:02.751, Speaker C: And you see one of us there come and say hi. We'd love to meet you.
01:02:02.823 - 01:02:03.343, Speaker D: There you go.
01:02:03.399 - 01:02:03.791, Speaker B: There you go.
01:02:03.823 - 01:02:11.153, Speaker A: Justin. Justin wants some more friends. Let's let's say hi to Justin. Let's see you guys next week. Take care.
01:02:11.169 - 01:02:12.845, Speaker C: Maybe we have to snip that part out.
01:02:13.905 - 01:02:15.153, Speaker A: No, leave it in.
01:02:15.329 - 01:02:15.665, Speaker D: See you.
