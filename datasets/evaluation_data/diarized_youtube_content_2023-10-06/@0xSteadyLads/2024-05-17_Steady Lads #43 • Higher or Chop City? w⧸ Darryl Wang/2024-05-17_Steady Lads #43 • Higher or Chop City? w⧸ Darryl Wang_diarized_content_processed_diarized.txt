00:00:00.320 - 00:00:25.714, Speaker A: All right, I'll finish the pastas. We had a knower of markets pasta. He's saying, I think we really need a CT native podcast. I know there are some very high quality ones out there, but none have tapped into an audience that wants a relaxed, unstructured conversation between a couple of friends with nothing to sell you but a good time. So, guys, we need this product. Maybe that's us. Maybe one day, one day we'll make the product.
00:00:25.714 - 00:00:35.320, Speaker A: I mean, I pinged him after and he's like, oh, okay, I'll listen to steady lads. He'll give it a shot. So hopefully Noah is one of our audience this week.
00:00:35.352 - 00:00:57.460, Speaker B: So, you know, I'm a little concerned, Jordy, because I did just see that uponly, their twitter has been revived after, you know, like six or seven months of inactivity. And we've got a little meme here that they've posted. And I'm wondering, you know, if uponly comes back on the air, our viewership's just gonna tank, right? I mean, we've been called the Costco version of up only before, and I think if they come back, we might be in trouble.
00:00:57.632 - 00:00:58.956, Speaker C: I think Kobe said he's no longer.
00:00:58.980 - 00:01:11.372, Speaker A: Doing podcasts, but maybe, maybe Ledger brings it back. But, you know, hopefully our small audience, as ran called it when he came on the show, even you guys, you're a smaller channel, but you have to.
00:01:11.388 - 00:01:16.904, Speaker D: Be very balanced in your coverage because what you say actually influences what people do.
00:01:18.004 - 00:01:56.060, Speaker A: Our tiny audience of 10,000 crypto natives is still enjoying it. Welcome, everybody. Episode 43 of steady lads. We have a special guest this week. We have one, Gary, with us. Daryl is someone I've known for a long time. We've been in the trenches, it's been some years.
00:01:56.060 - 00:02:37.246, Speaker A: And here to get his market views as well as we were talking a little bit before, we'll get some interesting views about the overall meta of where the space is at and the various verticals. Maybe let's just dive in this week. So we've had an interesting week where it was quiet until the CPi number, and then it looks like Macro is back in the menu because the CPI came a little bit soft. And it's not just crypto. I think stocks went to all time highs, gold all time highs. A bunch of stuff was moving around pretty strong. Daryl, are you going to have to become a macro analyst again or how are you seeing the situation?
00:02:37.390 - 00:02:59.224, Speaker D: I really hope not, man. Yeah, no, I really dread the days where we were camping. PPI and CPI numbers every month. That was really not pleasant. I hope we don't revert back to that state. I think the last week we had two interesting developments. The first one is obviously the CPI news that kickstarted the BDC run up.
00:02:59.224 - 00:03:56.670, Speaker D: And the second one is obviously Warren Kitty's return that introduced a bit of a hoo ha GME and some spillover effects to crypto. I think for BDC because I still am off the mindset that we are in a chop market. Chop goes both down and up. I think most people were accustomed to the down aspect of the chop and not so much to the up aspect. And so, you know, over the last couple of days, actually last 24 hours, people were reminded what chop in a, what up in a chop market means. And so you have BDC reacting very strongly, but only select coins doing well. And I think even on an aggregate, most alts were probably still bleeding versus BDC, even on this uptrend.
00:03:56.782 - 00:04:41.164, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And to your first point, I am a bit worried that we are going to be back to watching ppis and stuff. I saw there was a kind of minor unemployment number, which is the weekly jobless claims came out just slightly above the expectation, and then markets started spiking all over. It means that the people who are running the Algos, waiting for the number and reacting off of Es on CME, it seems like they've turned them back on. And I used to run one of those, so I don't miss those days. It was nice having to just focus on crypto markets. Justin, maybe let's bring up some of the recent prices.
00:04:41.164 - 00:04:47.552, Speaker A: Unfortunately, your ETH BTC doesn't look any better than it did last week.
00:04:47.728 - 00:04:51.404, Speaker B: It looks worse. I think it's hitting new lows.
00:04:52.344 - 00:04:54.104, Speaker C: Justin's about to go on a mental health break.
00:04:54.144 - 00:04:58.552, Speaker A: At this point, not as bad as BNB. That's a bit surprising. I'm not sure what's going on there.
00:04:58.688 - 00:05:02.284, Speaker B: Solana up 10%. Congrats to Solana holders.
00:05:04.324 - 00:05:06.308, Speaker C: Can you pull up eth BTC?
00:05:06.476 - 00:05:20.904, Speaker B: I can pull up ETH BTC, but I will say I've gotten feedback from the chat. I'm reevaluating my position. I'm trying to be a lot more agreeable, a lot more friendly to Solana folks, and just trying to be a better overall podcaster for you guys.
00:05:22.164 - 00:05:45.524, Speaker A: Okay, so we've broken the. We're broken the multi year low. So that huge run up looks like it was in May 2021. And if I recall correctly, that was when Elon was starting to get off of the bitcoin train. And getting into doge. And that seems to have been the catalyst at the time for. I mean, it was quite a huge change.
00:05:45.524 - 00:05:56.344, Speaker A: It went from 3.03 to 0.08 in like a month or two. So, Justin, there's hope. Just wait for the ETF.
00:05:56.884 - 00:06:17.364, Speaker B: Yeah. It feels a little hopeless, though. I won't lie to you guys. It sort of feels like crypto. Crypto gives you these emotions a lot of the times where it feels hopeless. Like, what is the narrative that could possibly bring us out of that? And I don't see what that could be right now, short of the ETF approval. But you're right, it all can change so, so quickly.
00:06:17.364 - 00:06:26.870, Speaker B: And I think that's where you've got to hold out hope if you're long ethereum and not so long. Anything else? Like myself, I did buy some polymarket.
00:06:27.062 - 00:06:27.582, Speaker A: Yes.
00:06:27.678 - 00:06:46.806, Speaker B: Approval shares for before, for the month of May. So I think my average price for a poly market, yes, on the ETF being approved is like $0.10 on the dollar. So about a 10% chance. I'm happy with those odds. Of course. I think the base case is it doesn't get approved, but still, it would be nice to be pleasantly surprised here, that's for sure.
00:06:46.990 - 00:07:05.810, Speaker A: Yeah. Although you might have been better off just buying poly market shares, period. I saw that they raised like $80 million or something, which I'm kind of curious on the economics of that and what the round valuation was. I don't know if you know, Daryl, but looks like they did a 45 million round.
00:07:06.002 - 00:07:07.394, Speaker D: No, we wouldn't preview to that.
00:07:07.474 - 00:07:12.894, Speaker A: I mean, it has to be at least series b 45 at, I don't know, 300 minimum. Right.
00:07:13.194 - 00:07:28.610, Speaker B: One thing I saw, which maybe justifies this in some ways, is I don't know if you guys saw this as well, but it looks like polymarket is responsible for 80% of betting volumes on the us presidential election. So not even crypto specific, but like polymarket is the place for these prediction markets, which is pretty cool.
00:07:28.762 - 00:07:46.704, Speaker A: That would be surprising. I haven't bet this time around, but last cycles I've been active on Betfair and usually that's by far the biggest volume. I don't know if they're excluding it or if something's changed in the market. Let me check what the Fed fair volumes are.
00:07:47.204 - 00:08:00.780, Speaker B: So here I'm just pulling this tweet up from nick to mano. He says Betfair has 20 and a half million dollars bet versus polymarkets 125 million. Obviously we could check the source in this tweet but if that's true, I mean, that is pretty staggering.
00:08:00.892 - 00:08:33.944, Speaker C: Yeah. And I guess this is kind of the narrative around, like, everything is going to be tokenized. Like, people are going to just bet on all the social outcomes and, and people talk about the meme queen super cycle and how this is the trend. I'm a little curious, Daryl, because I've had you on my channel a couple of times talking about how cucked ETH is. Do you have a view on ETh? What is your market analysis? What's your take on the market right now? Because it just seems like alter bleeding, like you said, what's the hope for Ethan at this point?
00:08:34.304 - 00:09:14.574, Speaker D: So on ETH, I actually think that the, at least in the last 48 hours, you sort of entered that capitulation mode for ETH. At least it certainly feels like it. I held no ETH until 24 hours ago. And we, as a fund, we actually started aggressively buying ETH and shorting BDC in the last 24 hours. So something to note for you, Justin. I'm in your camp as well, but maybe this is just a pain trade. We'll see.
00:09:14.734 - 00:09:33.914, Speaker B: You know, it's so funny you bring that up. We've had so many guests on and I've, we've, they've called for ETH, BTC bottom. I've called for it. Other people on the podcast have called for it and it hasn't rang true. I hope you're right this time. And I think me sort of capitulating to the Solana side maybe is the bottom as well, which I think I'm doing here.
00:09:34.654 - 00:10:54.314, Speaker D: So it's funny because we're actually selling the majority of our soul and we're going pretty long ETh right now on a hedged basis. But I think one of the reasons why we don't mind taking a step here where so many other, so many people before us have tried and like, basically gone underwater is because I think there are very compelling reasons due to positioning that the rejection, the finality of the rejection will mark the bottom. Because I think at that point, people have been, especially because of the price action leading up to the decision day. It sets up for massive off site positioning for the majority of the market. A lot of people, as you see in some of the tweets on Twitter, that it's not just disinterest in Eth, it's actually hate or a lot of negative sentiment that comes out and is typically what you want to see for something when you're betting on a trend reversal. So hoping that the rejection. Because my base case is, it definitely is a rejection.
00:10:54.314 - 00:11:09.106, Speaker D: But that rejection may not necessarily mean that ETH BDC continues to bleed down. We're betting reasonably large sizes. That is a bottom.
00:11:09.290 - 00:11:11.122, Speaker A: So you're shorting bitcoin?
00:11:11.298 - 00:11:15.214, Speaker D: Yes, we're hedging it via a bitcoin short.
00:11:15.994 - 00:11:26.210, Speaker A: Okay. That's a brave. Understandable, but brave. Let's bring up the Hashaka Treya tweet, because he has some ideas, maybe that can help out Daryl, so.
00:11:26.322 - 00:11:27.174, Speaker B: Oh, no.
00:11:27.954 - 00:11:37.698, Speaker A: He found his notes on how to possibly revive a dying token for the Ethereum foundation. Token burn. I think they're already doing that.
00:11:37.746 - 00:11:38.330, Speaker B: We've done that.
00:11:38.362 - 00:11:46.354, Speaker A: Not deflationary. Yeah, but we tried that. Tried it, at least. Fee burn. There we go. We did that. Ve tokenomics.
00:11:46.354 - 00:11:52.226, Speaker A: Maybe you can lock up your ETH and get. That's kind of like what eigen layer is. So. I don't know. It's already.
00:11:52.290 - 00:11:53.556, Speaker C: We tried it. We tried it.
00:11:53.650 - 00:11:54.000, Speaker A: It.
00:11:54.072 - 00:11:54.724, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:55.064 - 00:11:56.524, Speaker D: Everything's exhausted.
00:11:56.944 - 00:12:10.168, Speaker A: I can split. I mean, there's already ethereum classic, so I don't know if that's gonna rebrand. Maybe that's the. Maybe that's the key one, because I don't want to get to the last one, which is partner with DWF as a last resort.
00:12:10.296 - 00:12:11.896, Speaker D: Oh, no, that's a bad idea.
00:12:11.920 - 00:12:25.504, Speaker A: Let's not get to that. Yeah, rebrand. So I think everybody is starting to realize that the ultrasound money brand is not working, and maybe we do need a bit of a rebrand.
00:12:25.804 - 00:12:53.920, Speaker B: I'm totally on board with the rebrand. We've kind of talked about this for a little and I think Evan ss six, he always, he's like. He's bullish Ethereum, but can be critical about Ethereum, which is super valuable. And he has put out this tweet. He's put out a lot of tweets. I'd recommend reading his thoughts on Ethereum and rebranding Eth, but he, quote, tweets someone that replied to his message about rebranding ETH and he said, like in typical Ethereum community fashion, this completely misses the point. This is not about the technicals.
00:12:53.920 - 00:13:20.934, Speaker B: This isn't about any achievements or this ambition ambitious roadmap. It's about community marketing users, you want to speak to them, not distributed systems PhDs. And I think Ethereum has sort of lost its way in that regard, where it's become the chain that's like holier than thou, that won't talk to the people. I think I've been guilty of that myself. And like, rightfully so. Our listeners have accused me of that. And I think that's like part of Ethereum culture that, that needs a change in my opinion.
00:13:21.354 - 00:13:40.816, Speaker C: Yeah. And this, that reminds me of like the Suzu tweet last cycle. It's like, you know, Ethereum has abandoned its users. Like buy my Avax bags. Yeah, now that's like, I guess, like buy Solana. But Justin, if you can pull up my screen. I feel like there's been a lot of cynicism, at least on Twitter.
00:13:40.816 - 00:14:18.334, Speaker C: I just feel like it's so hard to make money nowadays that, you know, not only are we playing Pvp games like financially, but there's also like status Pvp games, you know, it's like, oh, you know, like that founder's bad, I didn't invest, I'm so good. Like I'm better than you. That type of, you know, like the vibes are off, you know, generally. Oh, yes, like what I know, like, Darryl, you also did like internal analysis on, I guess, the current market meta, like, like, what do you think about, you know, just like quote unquote real things not doing so well, whereas the things that's only outperforming are just general memes. Like, what's your general take on like this type of question?
00:14:19.154 - 00:15:25.038, Speaker D: So I think when you say real projects, I think there are two, there are two distinctions here. One are older projects that contribute utility and value, and one are the sort of newer, flashier projects of sort of, I guess the fresh tokens of this cycle. I think the older projects, those that provide a service or a value to users, for example, Abe as a borrow land protocol, I think there will be a flaw value for them that is probably not going to go away. And that's probably been established through last bear markets cycle lows. Um, they are not the particularly interesting tokens to long because there is no sexiness or narrative to it. There are no accelerating, uh, numbers of any sort, right, be Tbl revenue earned as daus, etc, etcetera. Um, and so these, these sort of dinosaur tokens typically sit in one pond and nobody really touches them.
00:15:25.038 - 00:16:19.924, Speaker D: And so they don't really do anything. They're just beta. But they're like the shittiest beta within this group. There are a handful of older tokens that no longer have unlocked concerns. And this is a big point that are re innovating and I guess rediscovering a new narrative that can potentially cause them to be outperformers. I think two examples that come to mind would be maker as they've been doing their DSR stuff until recently, and arweave, which is building out ao and transitioning from a data file storage protocol to something more in line with the AI sector. These are two examples of older tokens with no unlocks happening that are potentially interesting.
00:16:19.924 - 00:17:03.622, Speaker D: And that's why you see that they're driving a lot of the outperformance within the dinosaur camp, and then you have the new coins where, for whatever they do, I think people are beginning to get wisening up to the fact that you cannot be launching at three to $5 billion valuations and just waiting for the VC's to unlock on you. And it's only a question of time. I think this concept of, like, VC's unlocking a new and, like, bullish unlocks, they worked last cycle. I think you probably get one in 100 that has a bullish unlock this cycle. Right. And it only really works if the positioning on this, on the. On the coin is extremely lopsided.
00:17:03.718 - 00:17:40.642, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, they were saying that it was happening mainly because a, like, Alameda was, you know, seeing inside information of people's positioning on FTX. And, you know, they were listing all these perps that. Trying to get people to short and then just blowing them out. So if you have that cowboy mentality and you have the information, you can potentially have a bullish unlock squeeze people. But you're. Right now it's not happening. And actually, I think what you're describing is the most important meta that the market's starting to realize and look no further than arbitrum.
00:17:40.642 - 00:18:01.730, Speaker A: I mean, it's like number 50 now starting unlock since March. It's only been two months of unlock. So there's a lot more unlocks to come. The market cap is now lower than a lot of other. Not as, you know, famous coins or not as. Let's not even call them famous. I mean, arbitram, supposed to have endless FTV.
00:18:01.730 - 00:18:04.134, Speaker A: Sorry. Like TVL, right? Like 16.
00:18:04.954 - 00:18:07.208, Speaker B: It's the largest l two by far.
00:18:07.296 - 00:18:07.964, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:08.424 - 00:18:30.696, Speaker A: And it is just. I mean, this chart is. It's pre bull market. So you've basically missed the entire bull market if you've. You've been holding this liquid voluntarily. It's different if you're a VC because, you know, you're just, like, waiting for the unlocks to happen, and, I mean, no end in sight. Right.
00:18:30.696 - 00:18:34.104, Speaker A: Like, there's just monthly unlocks.
00:18:34.524 - 00:18:36.584, Speaker D: You're just getting dumped on endlessly.
00:18:37.044 - 00:18:37.420, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:37.452 - 00:19:01.826, Speaker C: Yeah. The use case for ARb is for it to dump. Justin, if you can share my screen. I talked about this last week too, but there's round two of arbitrary incentives. And I had my team just fill this out and I was trying to look for Alpha. It's like, oh my God, some of these projects are getting all these tokens. What are they going to do with it? And my takeaway was that none of them is worth using.
00:19:02.010 - 00:19:11.254, Speaker A: It's so sad. So when you say they're not worth using is because the amount of Arb tokens is not worth that much compared to what you would have to do or what does it mean?
00:19:11.554 - 00:19:42.742, Speaker C: Or I guess from a money making perspective, some of these prep Dexs, or Dexs, they're going to just incentivize liquidity. So maybe the APR go up 20% to 50%. But I guess that's not really exciting as a narrative. I was looking for. Remember last cycle when people were buying random Arpgum tokens because they were going to get a fat grant and that was a little pseudo pump and dump where a bunch of altcoins retraced. I'm not endorsing this vodka. They were a project.
00:19:42.742 - 00:19:55.434, Speaker C: It's a million market cap. They're getting a million dollars with the tokens. But I think people have wisened up. I think people get smarter around these games and they're not really willing to, I guess, like punt on these coins anymore.
00:19:55.554 - 00:20:24.536, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean. I mean, arbitrum theoretically is still one of the good ones. I mean, let's bring up this tweet from crypto condom who's always making some funny comments, but saying death is coming for Starknet's 13 billion and their eight users. And you can scroll down a little bit and look at the chart. So this is another one that hasn't even started the unlocks as far as I know. Or maybe like very, very light. Um, I mean, where is this one going to end up?
00:20:24.640 - 00:20:28.084, Speaker D: It's, um, it's more icps, basically.
00:20:28.584 - 00:20:49.444, Speaker B: Can I ask you guys a question? Is the solution making these tokens valuable by giving them cash flow and like trying to grow price to earnings, basically? Or is the solution narrative based or is the solution getting more participants in the system? Like, how do we get out of this trap? Like, what would it, what would it take for you guys to buy arbitrum token? Not just for a trade, but to actually invest in the token.
00:20:49.544 - 00:21:01.148, Speaker A: It has to be cash flow. I mean, I have to see that, like, you know, it's a reasonable growth, p ratio, whatever. Like there's something economical that makes sense there. I don't know about Daryl maybe?
00:21:01.276 - 00:21:25.482, Speaker D: No, I don't even think it's that. Because if you do that, then you probably need activity to go up by a factor of 1000 to 10,000 times before it makes it attractive. And that's just not realistic. I think for me it's. It comes back once again to the unlocks and inflation. The reason why nobody is going to touch these tokens is because of the increased inflation. And so you need to get rid of that.
00:21:25.482 - 00:22:16.954, Speaker D: And I don't think there's much you can do with tokens that are already live with existing investing schedules. But something that you can experiment with for new launches is you flip the concept on its head. I was actually talking about this structure to one of my friends in crypto. The premise is very simple. Right? When you tge, instead of listing on a centralized exchange at 2 billion FTV with a 10% float, you make it known to everyone that 100% of the tokens are going to be unlocked from day one. But the listing price of those tokens come down dramatically. So let's say instead of TG ing at like 2 billion FTP, you can tge at the valuation of your series a or your c route.
00:22:16.954 - 00:23:12.840, Speaker D: So you go straight to market saying, look, we just launched our token. It's 50 million FTB. Everyone is unlocked from day one. You choose when to sell, and then you have a lot more natural price discovery in terms of people understanding, all right, who is going to dump on me? Is this worth 50 million? Is this worth 100 million? People actually start doing the work again, discovering, okay, what is actually longable here, what is not now, it's like if you see something, no matter how exciting it is, you see something less than 10 billion FTP, you see the cliffs, the unlocked cliffs. You know, it doesn't matter what the fuck it does. You know, three months before the unlock, you're getting the fuck out of this token, you're not touching it. And it will prevail until a point in time where you feel like a narrative can come in to temporarily make people forget about the unlocks.
00:23:12.840 - 00:23:25.024, Speaker D: But it's like this ever rising current. So you need to cut the current from day one and you go to market with 100% of tokens unlocked. And that would be a very interesting capitalistic experiment.
00:23:25.144 - 00:23:38.616, Speaker B: That is interesting because basically it makes it non wise to sell initially, right? There's nothing the investors are waiting for. They could sell on day one, but presumably they. They can't. There's not enough liquidity and so they become like forced holders but without the.
00:23:38.640 - 00:23:48.528, Speaker A: Lock, isn't this just like tradfi? I mean, like when the, when IPO happens, there's no locked shares, is there? Like, isn't everyone unlocked arms?
00:23:48.616 - 00:23:53.084, Speaker B: Yeah. Donald Trump can't sell his 4 billion in truth social for another six months or something.
00:23:54.304 - 00:24:05.934, Speaker D: No, but I think the main distinction here is right now, especially for the bitcoins that are being distributed to retail, the centralized exchanges are the ones setting the price.
00:24:06.474 - 00:24:06.930, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:07.002 - 00:25:07.474, Speaker D: And this is not the way it's supposed to be done, because in tradfi, what happens is there is a price discovery process between the, between the institutions that are anchoring the IPO. So you actually have a public sale that happens in Tradfi, that doesn't happen in crypto. The public sale is like some nonsense $1 million allocation at 50 mil ftb, and then it pumps 20 x on the listing. That's not how it's done in treadfire. I think that the challenge here is that the probability of rugging becomes a lot higher, because then all of a sudden you have to care about the quality of the team, the quality of the investors. Because if you get shitty investors or a shitty team and you go out with this structure, it could be week two and you're already down 80% because everybody just said Kumbaya and they took the money and rent. Right.
00:25:07.474 - 00:25:14.370, Speaker D: But it's just basically more natural price discovery, which I think it will be interesting.
00:25:14.522 - 00:25:35.006, Speaker C: I actually like that. I guess the problem is if this happens on chain, then there's gonna be bots that snipe. But maybe the first week can be like some liquidity bootstrapping pool where it's designed to go down, but anyone can buy into it. And then maybe that can create natural price discovery. And then there's the meme. It's like, jeets out, Chad's in. That can actually be a thing.
00:25:35.006 - 00:25:58.326, Speaker C: I remember last year when I was a maker, Maxi, I was tracking Andreessen Horowitz dumping their maker, and I'm like, yes, that's bullish. They're getting the fuck out. It's good. So if you can front run that upfront, then, and like maybe 90% of things go to zero, but they're going to go to zero anyways. So maybe like the few coins that are actually worth buying is like, you know, you can do analysis on it and there's like edge to be had there, maybe.
00:25:58.470 - 00:26:19.204, Speaker D: And you can really get like the 20 5100 access again because you can find like really high quality coins going at pretty low FTPs before anyone else. And, like, it gives, I think it provides all the right incentives back into the market for people to go out there and do the work and try and run it up again with 100 xs.
00:26:19.624 - 00:26:25.684, Speaker B: Jordy, you're very much in the weeds on this stuff. Do you think something like that is a viable strategy?
00:26:26.064 - 00:27:12.804, Speaker A: Look, there's elements of it. I do see that the VC model in crypto is a little bit broken. You do get these very quick TGE's so that you don't get in traditional. You look at traditional companies, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, series E, and then maybe the IPO in crypto, it's like I did my seed round and then I'm launching a token next week. So if you do what Daryl was saying and you just give everybody unlocked tokens, I invested in a seed round and then a week later everything's unlocked. At that point I think it can work. But why are you getting investors if you can just go to market? Maybe because you need them to help you.
00:27:12.804 - 00:27:53.302, Speaker A: And then it becomes like a branding reputation game for the investors where they kind of prove their value and that they're holding their tokens and it becomes much more of a brand building game. But I agree, the current VC game feels you lock everybody up for a year. Every team is going through the same stuff. Honestly, I have so many calls with founders where it's like the one year unlock is coming up and the way the tokenomics are designed, there's a huge cliff coming and they're like, what do I do? And the answer is usually nothing. Just let them try to sell.
00:27:53.398 - 00:27:54.246, Speaker D: You can do.
00:27:54.350 - 00:28:23.364, Speaker A: You can't let them get it out, just sell. And then at some point you can try to bottom it out. But yeah, these cliffs. Not to show Mantle, but I was looking at mantle, is way above arbitrum now. And the reason is mantle unlocked all the tokens, like 100% of the tokens a year ago when they launched the chain. So there were no unlocks. There's like zero unlocks and it's performing well, which is mainly because it all comes down to supply and demand.
00:28:23.364 - 00:29:31.902, Speaker A: And if you can just sort of make it balance out early on, then you're in a better spot. I am curious about Solana unlocks because my one criticism of Solana compared to Ethereum has always been that they went the VC route and there's coins unlocking until 2028 and we're in this weird waterfall cycle where the coins that are locked are getting sold in tranches to medium term investors. That are buying them at $70, $100 and then there's like this big clip in 2025. But you try to. But I don't know, like, I'm not sure if Solana is going to have this overhang for years where there's always going to be people with cheaper tokens. And unfortunately, even though I like a lot of what tawn is doing, I don't know if there's going to be a similar dynamic there because there have been a ton of OTC rounds on ton at pretty cheap prices, you know, like a dollar or like that kind of prices. I think probably because, you know, they're just like raising money and.
00:29:31.902 - 00:29:41.902, Speaker A: But that creates a lot of people that are up like 510 x on like large size that want to take profit, right? At some point.
00:29:42.078 - 00:30:00.314, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Like the incentives are definitely, like, flawed, right, with like, the one year cliff. I feel like what traders do is that if there's a new token and it has a decent narrative, they'll pump it in the first three months, and then at that point it's like, well, in six months people might sell, so there's less reasons to own it.
00:30:00.354 - 00:30:03.290, Speaker D: And then you move on to the next token.
00:30:03.482 - 00:30:19.198, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Even Jito. If you can pull up my chart, Justin, I have the Jito to Lido ratio. Pretty crazy. I think Jido is trading at 450 and Lido is at 150. I think market cap of Jito is 600 million ftB, 4.5 billion.
00:30:19.198 - 00:30:37.678, Speaker C: Lido is like 1.3 billion circulating 1.5 billion ftb. I understand that Jito has the whole mev narrative where there's more mev on Solana right now, according to some analytics dashboards. And maybe that is more interesting. And Jito can pivot to launching ethereum lsts. Maybe.
00:30:37.678 - 00:31:01.412, Speaker C: Maybe that's the narrative. But it's really crazy how some of these tokens have traded and it's really hard to, I guess, extract value from the public markets when you have to worry about unlocks in six months. It's not fun. I feel like people went to a crypto to have fun, but it's no longer fun anymore and everyone's becoming jaded, which creates more anger on Twitter.
00:31:01.548 - 00:31:34.288, Speaker A: Then you get these breath of fresh air, hyper liquid, where the guy's just taking zero VCU money, he's just building it. He's like, I don't care, just going to build this. And then like, I mean, I'm not, I'm not sure how, how the end game goes on that, but you can see that there's organic alignment because the focus is there, the product is good and it doesn't feel like someone's just trying to like wait out the clock until they get tokens.
00:31:34.456 - 00:31:45.256, Speaker B: What's interesting though is like Friendtech tried the opposite approach. They gave 100% away to the community. VC's got nothing and friendtech token has done pretty poorly. Usage is quite down.
00:31:45.400 - 00:31:47.720, Speaker A: When you bring up the chart. I haven't looked at the chart.
00:31:47.832 - 00:31:52.896, Speaker C: I feel like it's. You can't just look at the tokenomics too because if the product was good, maybe it actually does pump.
00:31:53.040 - 00:31:58.352, Speaker B: But you know, so it's $130 million FTV.
00:31:58.448 - 00:32:23.722, Speaker D: It just forces you to become a lot more honest, right. Because once that's out of the way then you actually have to care, does the product work? And then if the product works and you have a story of increasing Daus, increasing network effects, then I see a pathway for threaten to like ten or 20 x from here. But right now the problem is that the product is pretty shitty and they haven't done much to fix that.
00:32:23.898 - 00:32:42.554, Speaker C: Yeah, and there's also this argument that because the team and the VC's don't have the tokens, there's no incentivize, there's no incentive to pump the token. Like they're just incentivized to charge high fees and just pocket that. And why would they share revenue to friend? There's no path for that. I mean there could be, but it's.
00:32:42.594 - 00:32:59.594, Speaker A: PvP between the equity holders, the tokens and the management. The management is paying themselves first class airfare type of money and then the equity holders are sort of trying to get some scraps.
00:33:01.134 - 00:33:05.514, Speaker B: Well the equity holders raised 60 million in fees or something like that initially, right?
00:33:05.934 - 00:33:12.554, Speaker C: Yeah, they're up a lot. It's like a tax farm, right? Like everything gets taxed on the platform and they keep it.
00:33:12.854 - 00:34:08.354, Speaker A: It's a little bit like uniswap though, right? Like the front end fee that they're getting something, it's just much higher. But I mean, let's bring up this Travis Klingon, just a reminder of the super liked comment that he wrote where he wrote his thesis for the next one or two years earlier this year. A lack of pretense that any of this shit does anything or will ever do anything. And if you scroll down, I mean he goes through all the different social fi and AI some of these things. And I know Daryl, you've been taking a look at these as well. Ultimately it does seem that online gambling is the segment that's actually staggering and going up, that's the real up, only a lot more gambling going on. He does sort of like makes make some good points.
00:34:08.354 - 00:34:29.709, Speaker A: That is like frontech is maybe not going to be necessarily the long term play, but it gives you some airdrop money. What do you think of these medium, Daryl, do you think that any of this AI or social fire gaming, are you seeing anything that's like in the next year? Makes sense?
00:34:29.861 - 00:35:24.320, Speaker D: So I think conceptually, I think gaming and social fi are the most interesting, mainly because it has the potential to change the existing business models. In web two, I think social fi, you have. I don't see anything yet that I'm particularly very interested in. But there are elements, or you can envision as a situation in which you can change how the creator economies work. And with the use of a token and with the use of these decentralized networks, you can actually produce a better service or product to the people. Right. And that's, I think if you break it down to really first principles, I think social fire has that element and Gamefi has the element as well.
00:35:24.432 - 00:35:24.704, Speaker A: Right?
00:35:24.744 - 00:35:54.084, Speaker D: Because on Gamefi side, you can unlock virtual economies that are much, much smaller in real life today. And you know, I think web3 gaming economies can. I said this last cycle, I still believe it at some point can rival certain countries in its fully flashed out form. We have not seen any progress on the gaming side so far. There's also noticeable to be in the last two to three years, which is very, very sad.
00:35:55.064 - 00:36:14.482, Speaker A: You're forgetting not coin, not coin, which just launched on binance, launch pool, everything else, apparently it's like the 35 million user game that we've been waiting for. Like this is the mass, mass user game, as I understand it. This is the one where you just tap, tap, tap, tap, tap on Telegram and just get points for tapping and you just keep tapping.
00:36:14.658 - 00:36:17.094, Speaker B: Oh, I use that app. I should have some coins.
00:36:19.154 - 00:36:22.402, Speaker A: Why am I not surprised? Out of all of us, Justin is the one that's used this app.
00:36:22.458 - 00:37:05.242, Speaker B: You've got to try everything. You know, Darryl, it was interesting to hear, like, I want to talk about the social fi piece for a little Peter Thiel in his book zero to one talks about how like, if you want to supplant a current technology, you have to be like roughly ten x better to get people to switch over. And I've noticed this with my own behavior with Warpcast and other social fi apps that we've seen and played with. It's like they're fundamentally not offering anything new for the user. I don't know how important it is for your average user. They control their own data or control their own social graph. To me, that doesn't really seem like that much of a compelling use case to get everyone to migrate over, and it's like this massive mobilization effort to get people to do it.
00:37:05.242 - 00:37:16.974, Speaker B: And I am. I am hopeful that social fi becomes something, but I just don't see, like, a compelling product that they're offering that's really differentiated themselves or is like, drastically better than anything we have today.
00:37:17.554 - 00:38:21.872, Speaker D: I agree with you on that point. I would say that I think the way that tokens and web3 social fi can innovate and improve on is basically continuing that trend of transferring more power to the creators and the influencers versus the underlying stack. I think right now, for example, YouTube influencers, Instagram influencers, for the reach that they have and for, I guess, the revenue that they contribute to the things that they're marketing, they're still getting paid a fraction of that. I think web3 has the opportunity to maybe shift a lot of that ratio into the hands of the creators and influencers versus the hands of the, the brands or even the underlying network. So it's similar to what Onlyfans did, which was, I guess, a paradigm shift in that sense. I think web3 can sort of push more of that along those lines. But, yeah, based on what you said earlier, I fully agree.
00:38:21.872 - 00:38:37.404, Speaker D: Today, we don't see a massive zero to one or order of magnitude improvement in anything right now. I mean, you look at, like, yeah, you look at more stuff out there. I mean, you look at fronttech and, like, I want to vomit blood when I try and use that.
00:38:38.864 - 00:38:50.024, Speaker C: So I guess, like, from a trading perspective, I guess you look for these things, but I guess, you know, there's, like, nothing to look into. So, like, now you've resorted to longing, Eid, PTC, and I guess selling Solana.
00:38:50.064 - 00:38:50.804, Speaker B: Let's go.
00:38:51.384 - 00:39:06.214, Speaker C: Yeah. So, like, what's your view on Solana? Like, do you think that ETH has the better risk award? So he's like, just buying EPTC? Because I know you were like, omega bullish Solana, like a month ago. So what happened? Are you just like, are you just trading it or.
00:39:06.754 - 00:39:59.240, Speaker D: Yeah, no, this one is more so of sort of the way that we're managing the book. So Solana is still our preferred beta over longer term, longer time horizons. This BDC trade that we put on is, I think, for a much shorter term. I think it's sort of like a two to three week trade where we're really looking to see how the market reacts post rejection. But I think on the longer term, whenever we want to risk on, we will probably buy either BTC or Sol and then trim it down where we want to risk off. So the reason why I'm actually risking on Sol here is because I think until BDC breaks above 74, everything in between is just chopped. And in a chop framework, what we've resorted to is you buy low and you sell high.
00:39:59.240 - 00:40:31.038, Speaker D: So our, our rangers are, call it fifty six k to like 72. So the higher BDC goes to 72, more we sell and then the lower it goes to, more we buy back. That's the very brain dead simple way of doing things. And then if it breaks past 74, then we just, whatever that we sold, we just buy it back anyway. Because there would need to have been a very good reason for this market to break the post 74. And for what it's worth, I don't think I see it yet.
00:40:31.166 - 00:40:42.610, Speaker C: What do you think those reasons can be? Because your market view is chopped for the next couple of months? What do you think actually gets us to higher levels? Because I think we all believe in, you know, eventual all time highs.
00:40:42.642 - 00:40:42.786, Speaker D: Right.
00:40:42.810 - 00:40:47.874, Speaker C: For even. Either. Right. So what it, like, what is the catalyst and how long will it take that?
00:40:47.954 - 00:41:39.464, Speaker D: So I have no idea. We've tried brainstorming about potential things that could do this. It will have to be huge buyers from tradfi just deciding to take up their net of BDC. And like one day, like, you know, you're seeing some of the s one reports come out. Sorry, the Q one filings come out of like a couple guys owning a couple hundred million BTC, it will need to be in like in the order of like billions, I think, for that to happen. Either that or it's possible if like something as curveball as I roaring Quiddy's Warren, Katie starts tweeting about crypto that I, you. I mean, the guy put on a lot of market cap for GameStop and AMC, so it's not impossible to believe that he can try and do that for crypto as well.
00:41:39.464 - 00:41:42.400, Speaker D: Although probably it's a bit too much for one man.
00:41:42.592 - 00:41:46.884, Speaker A: Hasn't the Jimmy thing kind of like reverted, though? I mean, it has, yeah.
00:41:47.744 - 00:42:18.684, Speaker D: So, but it has, I think. I don't know what it is, but I think that when it comes, it will be very clear. I think one thing can also be potentially the eFt ETF. But that is, you know, call it, I think base case is like probably six months down the road, if not later. So I don't see anything to bring us out of this chart. And until. Until I see it or until I'm proven wrong by the numbers, I just stick to my frail.
00:42:18.844 - 00:42:20.828, Speaker B: Do you think the election could be.
00:42:20.836 - 00:42:26.308, Speaker D: A catalyst if the Republicans win? Yes, that could be one as well.
00:42:26.436 - 00:42:26.724, Speaker B: If.
00:42:26.764 - 00:42:32.794, Speaker D: If the Democrats win, then it's going to be a very quick cycle because.
00:42:32.914 - 00:42:58.000, Speaker C: The devs have been so hostile against crypto. I can definitely see a case where if Democrats lose, maybe defi coins or these valueless governance tokens start pumping because people start to price in. Okay, maybe uniswap can actually do revenue share or something. Maybe I'm just coping as a DeFi bull, but I can definitely see those type scenarios. Crypto can be like a prediction market for the election, right?
00:42:58.192 - 00:42:58.924, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:42:59.984 - 00:43:45.264, Speaker A: I did bring up Betfair, and I saw that Trump is at 194, at least that's on european odds, which basically makes him a very, very slight favorite. It does feel like in my circles, it's sort of assumed that he's going to win, but it does seem to be that the smart money or the betting money is calling it a coin toss. So I think you're right, Justin. If the election starts to go Trump's way, we will see a pump, probably mainly in ethereum for your sake, because that will mean that ETF is near. So let's change the topic a little bit. I saw San trabuco. Little rat seems to be back.
00:43:45.264 - 00:44:18.004, Speaker A: Kind of shocking reappearance. I thought he was gonna reappear in some, you know, hole, kind of like Saddam Hussein appeared with, like, the hair, and, you know, they're dragging him out of the hole. But actually, he wrote a pretty funny letter here saying that Ryan Salami is his best friend and the judge should basically, you know, take it easy on him. What is going on here? Like, how is this real life? All my telegram chats were, like, wondering if this is real.
00:44:18.344 - 00:44:26.124, Speaker B: I think this just has to mean that Sam was a whistleblower. He departed early, he blew the whistle, or perhaps was considering doing it. Right?
00:44:27.344 - 00:44:55.276, Speaker A: Yeah. And then why was he tweeting, like, in September, 2 months before this whole thing went down, that for no reason, he just started tweeting that FTX is fine. The reason he left was nothing related to anything going wrong. And, you know, he kind of just threw everybody back into the fire. Because if he was a whistleblower, theoretically, it would be insane. Insane for him to then tweet about this.
00:44:55.380 - 00:45:02.756, Speaker C: I feel like he has to end up in jail at some point, right? Like, even on, like, a short sentence. I don't know if he's writing letters.
00:45:02.780 - 00:45:11.038, Speaker D: To try and bail other people out. I don't know how. I mean, you probably should feel pretty comfortable before you start doing those kind of things.
00:45:11.166 - 00:45:38.258, Speaker A: Look at this, November 6. This is. This is literally like the day before everything went down. And he's basically saying it's all fud. This is November 6. What is wrong with this guy? I mean, if he's actually whistleblowing, why is he going on Twitter and saying it's all fudge and everything is fine? I don't understand. And now he's, like, saying who his best friend is.
00:45:38.386 - 00:45:45.714, Speaker D: I mean, there's a chance that when he left early, he hadn't whistleblown yet, and then only after the collapse that he was the first one to.
00:45:45.834 - 00:45:50.394, Speaker B: Well, he hasn't even been charged, though, right? I mean, they charged Caroline. She was allegedly the first.
00:45:50.474 - 00:46:01.354, Speaker A: Yeah, we have this. This awesome meme here. Friendship ended with SPF. Now, Ryan Salome is my best friend.
00:46:02.774 - 00:46:05.594, Speaker C: He's my best friend. He has also committed crimes.
00:46:06.014 - 00:46:07.074, Speaker D: That's a good line.
00:46:09.374 - 00:46:44.160, Speaker A: Otherwise, we've had a few launches, so Drift launched, and we have seen generally that the Solana airdrop coins don't start very strong. It does seem that most of the Solana community is dumping airdrops. And does that mean they're more sophisticated, Daryl? Like, you know, they're kind of just aware of the meta and they just want to get dollars out or. I'm not quite sure what to make of why. Because we've seen a few now, we had, was it Camino? We had and a few other ones recently.
00:46:44.352 - 00:46:56.292, Speaker D: No, I'm not going to lie. I have no idea what's going on there. I don't know how these things are trading. I don't know why they're trading this way. I don't know why drift is at 400 mil. Or rather, I don't know why everything else is higher than where drift is at.
00:46:56.428 - 00:47:04.300, Speaker A: And some of these, like, drift, I think, has done private rounds, you know, in the 300 plus range. I believe that's actually, like, a good.
00:47:04.332 - 00:47:09.144, Speaker C: Time to get in then, or, I mean, I guess if you put any weight into, like, the series a or something.
00:47:10.164 - 00:47:39.252, Speaker A: Should we be putting weight into series as and stuff like that in general? Like, how do we think about a private round backstopping a public valuation? We saw Messa network. They said they did a billion dollar round. It's a DPN project. That launched an OKX a couple of weeks ago, and then the public value went down to like 150 million. So it was down 80% on the private round. So it starts to feel like the private rounds are not necessarily.
00:47:39.388 - 00:47:42.882, Speaker B: It's just a psychological boost. Right. It shouldn't actually have any impact.
00:47:43.028 - 00:48:01.486, Speaker C: Yeah. And I guess if you expect investors to dump their multiples, then if it's trading at whatever they've invested at, maybe they were less inclined to sell. But obviously it depends on the coin, right. If the token is trash, then, like, get the fuck out. But, yeah, I think what it actually.
00:48:01.550 - 00:48:30.254, Speaker D: Represents is that these are just, like, lagging indicators of risk to me. Right. Like, when newer coins launch and most of them fare pretty poorly, which I believe has been going on. I can't. I think the latest that the last coin that did well post this thing was Ina. And even that has more or less retraced all the run up that it's had already. I think after that, everything else has been an absolute shit show.
00:48:30.254 - 00:48:43.246, Speaker D: So it just basically tells me people are not interested in trying to construe narratives for the fresh coins. That's a pretty bad side.
00:48:43.430 - 00:49:03.010, Speaker C: Yeah. We have new coins not doing well. We have old coins not doing well unless it's like memes or very select narratives, like AI, you know, certain coins in AI, like, I guess, tongcoin doing okay with, like, tether onboarding and whatnot. So. So I guess it's like asset, like dispersion in performance.
00:49:03.082 - 00:49:03.242, Speaker A: Right.
00:49:03.258 - 00:49:07.162, Speaker C: It's like very select coins do well. Most just get nuked.
00:49:07.298 - 00:50:03.416, Speaker D: Yeah. There's actually one longer standing, I think, trend that we probably want to do a bit more work on, which is looking at all the old coins with 100% of supply already circulating and seeing whether they have any signs of life in terms of being able to hop on a new narrative or release a product that people can get excited about. Because I think those are actually very, very healthy setups for you to pull, like five to ten x's on a liquid basis. You're probably not going to get like 100 x. But, like, I think a perfect example of this was. Okay, maybe not perfect example, but something like Pendle in the bear market lows was generally old coin from the last cycle. They rebranded, they caught a market fit, and they pulled 100 x in front of your face in this cycle.
00:50:03.416 - 00:50:12.884, Speaker D: So I think that is probably where most of the work will have to be done. And then you just stay away from all the new coins.
00:50:13.704 - 00:50:19.364, Speaker A: Stay away from all the new coins. Wow, that'll be quite a change for a lot of people.
00:50:19.864 - 00:50:22.104, Speaker B: New coin. Good. No longer true.
00:50:22.224 - 00:50:23.864, Speaker D: Sign of the times. Cool.
00:50:23.904 - 00:50:30.824, Speaker A: All right, well, let's. Let's finish with pasta of the week. Maybe let's let our guest go first this time. So, Darryl, let's see your pasta.
00:50:30.984 - 00:50:52.754, Speaker D: So I thought this was. This was insanely funny, because this basically, accurately depicts what a day in the life of all us mentally unsound people doing in our lives, watching how ducks are talking and who's a black GCR? White GCR, gay gcrs?
00:50:53.774 - 00:50:59.638, Speaker A: Who's the asian GCR? Do we have a. Is there a consensus on who the asian GCR is?
00:50:59.766 - 00:51:01.958, Speaker D: I don't think that's an asian GCR yet.
00:51:02.126 - 00:51:08.314, Speaker C: No. We have hope, Daryl. We have hope. We still have an opportunity to be asian GCR.
00:51:08.654 - 00:51:11.554, Speaker A: Is it thicke? Is thicci asian GCR?
00:51:12.654 - 00:51:14.954, Speaker D: It can be thicker, man. Let's make it tiki.
00:51:15.744 - 00:51:55.488, Speaker A: So, just because, like, about, you know, a good chunk of our audience is audio only on Spotify, the quote, the tweet says, what do you do? I'm a professional crypto trader. What do you think of the market? And he says, well, a crypto duck is bearish memes and flips his profile pic upside down, which he famously did in 2018. But Ansem, future mayor of New York City, is disagreeing. We're running out of GCR permutations based on ethnicity. So now we've called the cartoon dog gay GCR, and it just goes on and on. It talks about Raoul pal coming up with a banana zone and. Yeah, Ansem, the banana zone.
00:51:55.488 - 00:51:56.724, Speaker A: I mean, this is.
00:51:57.344 - 00:51:59.324, Speaker B: This is a funny industry, man.
00:52:00.024 - 00:52:00.400, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:00.432 - 00:52:18.694, Speaker C: Just. Just like, all the meme point holders are just, like, angrily, you know, tweeting under him. And then, like, all the Maxis dad don't like mucoins or, like. Yeah, like, it's a tough, you know, it's kind of like this PvP mentality now that we've kind of been repeating past couple of months.
00:52:19.194 - 00:52:23.442, Speaker A: Justin, you've been on a pretty decent role lately on the pastas. Do you have a good one again?
00:52:23.578 - 00:52:37.694, Speaker B: I have a very good one. Yeah. I think you guys are going to like this one. And I think it's very timely. We've talked about crypto gaming. I know, Darryl, you're bullish on it. And I think we have a little sneak peek of the future of on chain gaming here, which is pretty exciting.
00:52:37.694 - 00:53:05.394, Speaker B: So in the future, every shot that you take with your gun when you're gaming is a transaction or signature on chain. And so you can see here how cool this is. Like, you're owning. You own your gear, you own every shot, and before every action, you get to sign a message here to get to the next part of the game. So, super exciting. I think, on chain gaming really is the future. And, I mean, look at this user experience, right? Does it really get much better than this? Like, you're going to own the bullets.
00:53:05.394 - 00:53:07.754, Speaker B: Each bullet is a signature. It's pretty cool.
00:53:08.734 - 00:53:09.934, Speaker D: This is real, by the way.
00:53:09.974 - 00:53:10.886, Speaker A: No, it can't be real.
00:53:10.950 - 00:53:12.074, Speaker B: No, I don't think so.
00:53:15.014 - 00:53:16.934, Speaker C: Dude. I wouldn't be surprised if that was real.
00:53:16.974 - 00:53:26.914, Speaker B: Like, honestly, when people say on chain gaming, though, this is what I've always thought. And so when I saw this pasta come out yesterday, I was like, this is perfect. This is amazing.
00:53:27.214 - 00:53:36.854, Speaker A: I mean, thankfully, you know, at least you can give a single approval, and then the whole. The whole action that's within that bucket just happens.
00:53:36.934 - 00:53:42.394, Speaker B: Yeah. It's only one approval per gun, so if you're playing Call of Duty, you only have to approve, like, a few times each match.
00:53:44.334 - 00:53:52.834, Speaker A: Approved. Grenade thrower. All right, that's. That's very strong contender, Taigi, how about you?
00:53:53.694 - 00:54:18.614, Speaker C: Yeah. So, I don't know. Going after that is pretty dangerous. But, you know, going back to this guy, the average reply guy, tweeting the lido chart, just basically approaching the lows. And then in the comments section, there's a screenshot of this telegram chat, which I think is real, called the Lido Holders support group. And then Andrew T. Is saying, I am literally going to kill myself.
00:54:18.614 - 00:54:30.868, Speaker C: It's just like the e community holding old bags, stale bags, which I'm a part of, obviously. But, you know, like, sometimes I wake up, I scroll Twitter, everyone's debating meme coins, and I'm like, dude, like, what.
00:54:30.876 - 00:54:31.524, Speaker A: Am I doing here?
00:54:31.564 - 00:54:35.916, Speaker C: You know? Like, I feel like I don't belong. But I just thought it was funny.
00:54:36.020 - 00:55:07.652, Speaker A: I mean, there. The funny thing is, like, there are these recent stories about Lido and paradigm. Not lido, necessarily, but I guess, like, you know, the Lido people and paradigm, the fund working together on an Eigen layer competitor. But I'm guessing that's just going to be a new token. And this one, I don't know if the old token gets an airdrop of a little bit of the new one or how that's going to work. I'm not quite sure. So we'll have to wait and see if there's any hope for LDo.
00:55:07.828 - 00:55:15.716, Speaker C: That's interesting. Is that confirmed? I know. Like, Korok is also, like, some quote unquote competitor. But is that true? Like, a lido theme?
00:55:15.820 - 00:55:16.920, Speaker D: Yeah, it's true.
00:55:17.092 - 00:55:25.840, Speaker C: Oh, wow. And it's. And it's dumping like this. What the heck? I feel like that would be bullish. People, like, with insider info, can, like, just, like, buy it up.
00:55:25.872 - 00:55:30.924, Speaker B: But I guess, I mean, if you're up a thousand x, you gotta sell for 10,000 x. What are you gonna do?
00:55:31.864 - 00:55:45.464, Speaker C: I feel like they've already sold, haven't they? I don't. I don't know. Like, I remember, like, last. Last year, like, ruhn, like, the founder maker was, like, dumping his vested lido bags, like, every single week, and he was, like, buying a maker. And I'm like, yes, that's my guy.
00:55:45.924 - 00:56:12.864, Speaker A: All right, I'll finish the pastas. We had a knower of markets pasta. He's saying, I think we really need a CT native podcast. I know there are some very high quality ones out there, but none have tapped into an audience that wants a relaxed, unstructured conversation between a couple of friends with nothing to sell you but a good time. So, guys, we need this product. Maybe that's awesome. Maybe one day.
00:56:12.864 - 00:56:25.940, Speaker A: One day we'll make the product. I mean, I pinged him after, and he's like, oh, okay, I'll listen to steady lads. He'll give it a shot. So, hopefully, Noah is one of our audience this week.
00:56:25.972 - 00:56:49.494, Speaker B: So I'm a little concerned, Jordy. Cause I did just see that up. Only their twitter has been revived after six or seven months of inactivity. And we've got a little meme here that they've posted. And I'm wondering, you know, if uponly comes back on the air, our viewership's just gonna tank, right? I mean, we've been called the Costco version of uponly before, and I think if they come back, we could be in trouble.
00:56:49.874 - 00:56:54.490, Speaker C: Toby said he's no longer doing podcasts, but I don't know, maybe it comes back.
00:56:54.522 - 00:57:19.964, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe ledger brings it back. But, you know, hopefully our small audience, as ran called it when he came on the show, our tiny. Our tiny audience of 10,000 crypto natives is still enjoying it. And thank you, Darrell, for coming. You had a great pasta, but I think Justin got the giggles. He's on a roll.
00:57:20.544 - 00:57:21.160, Speaker B: Thank you, guys.
00:57:21.192 - 00:57:25.064, Speaker A: Two and a half out of three. I think last time we split it, but two and a half out of three, Justin.
00:57:25.104 - 00:57:26.608, Speaker C: So I'm coming back.
00:57:26.776 - 00:57:28.080, Speaker A: He's coming back a lot.
00:57:28.112 - 00:57:37.114, Speaker B: I'm rebranding myself. I'm rebranding myself. No longer the east guy, more agreeable, friendly to the chat, Solana focused, funny pasta.
00:57:37.454 - 00:57:41.790, Speaker A: He's the not coin ton coin guy. Now he's gonna start chilling.
00:57:41.942 - 00:57:44.554, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:57:45.294 - 00:57:48.686, Speaker A: Cool. Well, thank you for joining us, Daryl, and see everybody next week.
00:57:48.710 - 00:57:51.054, Speaker D: Appreciate it. All right, ciao. Bye.
