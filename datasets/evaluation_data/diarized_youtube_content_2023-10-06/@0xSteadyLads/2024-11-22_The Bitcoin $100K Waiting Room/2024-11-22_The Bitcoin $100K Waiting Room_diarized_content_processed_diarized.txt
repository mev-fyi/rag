00:00:20.360 - 00:01:08.945, Speaker A: Gm lads, let's. Let's go live. I think we're so close to 100k, we don't want to miss it. Hit the intro. All right, everybody, hopefully it happens on stream. We got a little bit of a chance, but bitcoin is edging, as the kids call it, and hopefully it will soon be gooning. I don't know if you guys use these terms, but they're in all my telegram chats.
00:01:10.245 - 00:01:13.625, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely. We're. I think we're all in the trenches now.
00:01:14.005 - 00:01:26.065, Speaker A: We're all in the trenches so we're going to get into that. And I'm excited to give everybody an update on Justin switching from eth Maxi to meme Coin maxi.
00:01:27.765 - 00:01:32.545, Speaker C: We've converted him. We did it, boys. No, dump it all.
00:01:33.485 - 00:01:34.465, Speaker B: Dump it.
00:01:36.125 - 00:02:04.095, Speaker A: Let's just bring up the charts quickly. So bitcoin obviously run up after run up. We are at 99k right now, up 12% for the week. And Ethereum, not too bad. I mean, comparatively to what we're used to. 9%, Solana doing great, 22%. We'll kind of like give a quick rundown of each coin because I think everything has a little bit of news going on.
00:02:04.095 - 00:02:17.625, Speaker A: Bitcoin, obviously, like Michael Saylor keeps just buying all the bitcoin in the world and leveraging it to infinity. I don't know, like, is he a chad? What do you guys think?
00:02:19.085 - 00:02:32.745, Speaker C: I think he's a chad. I think he's a chad. I like, at some point it's going to end poorly or I feel like at some point it will end poorly. But in the meantime we're all enjoying it, right? He's pumping our bags, everyone's happy.
00:02:33.525 - 00:02:50.265, Speaker B: So if I recall the premium, the bitcoin premium, the premium the micro strategy had relative to their underlying holdings is down massively. Right. Like yesterday I think it went down 20 something percent. I would expect that to eventually go down and converge to zero. Do you think that's the right way to think about it, Jordy?
00:02:51.685 - 00:03:25.715, Speaker A: Potentially, yeah. But there's a bigger question. I think Eric Wall has nailed the bigger question, which is what all of us in the trenches are trying to figure out. This is the ultimate question of the universe, the age old question. If we can bring up his tweet here, he says the only question you should be asking is does the BTC pump level off at one point and roll into monstrous, disgusting altcoin pump or is the market structure actually different this time because of ETFs? And he says your entire bloodline depends on you getting this answer right?
00:03:26.095 - 00:03:28.115, Speaker B: And the crazy thing is that's true.
00:03:30.415 - 00:03:31.195, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:32.935 - 00:03:55.723, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, of course. He says it's possible that a billion things pop and you don't see them or hear about them because you're not on tick tock, trading Obama, shiba inu, schizo, cringe, coke, rock tarts, you know, coin. But, Justin, you are. You are. Are you in the. I don't know if you're in the TikTok trenches, but you are somehow saying that you.
00:03:55.723 - 00:04:00.335, Speaker A: You're acquiring many valuable assets. Can you tell us what's going on?
00:04:00.915 - 00:04:24.525, Speaker B: Yeah, I am. Have definitely found myself in the trenches. So last week, Tygi onboarded me into this meme coin craze. I started off dipping my toe in the water with Pepe, and now I'm completely out on the risk curve with these TikTok meme coins. So I think chill guy is sort of like the canonical. The first TikTok meme coin that's popping off, that's a holding of mine now. And I actually, you know, like, I realized I'm not.
00:04:24.525 - 00:04:47.195, Speaker B: I can't be this terminally online person. So I gave a very close friend of mine a big bag of Solana to sort of trade these meme coins, and he's a master of online culture, master of memes. So I'm excited to update you guys on where that lands us, but I have a ton of learnings from the trenches. It's hard and it is stressful. I don't know if you guys have been feeling it too, but I almost kind of wish I was back in the eth maxi days. It was a simpler life.
00:04:47.535 - 00:04:51.519, Speaker A: Justin, just be a chill guy, man. Just be a chill guy. Don't worry about any of this stuff.
00:04:51.567 - 00:04:55.835, Speaker C: Just. Justin, what's your average entry for chill guy? Just curious.
00:04:56.625 - 00:05:23.205, Speaker B: Uh, I think I found it in the 20 cent range, and it went up to 50 cents. I don't know what it said now. Maybe 35, 37. So it is interesting. You can find these things early, but it's really, really hard to, like, you know, have the conviction to hold them during the drawdowns because, you know, in your head, like, all of these things end up at zero. So it's really hard. But, yeah, I'm not sure how possible it is to outperform the market on these meme coins.
00:05:23.205 - 00:05:35.939, Speaker B: You lose a lot of sleep. Your dopamine receptors get fried. At, like, one point. I was just done, like, doing this after, like, just two days of, like, being terminally online. It was too much. I wrote down some thoughts, though, if you guys want to hear my. Hear my learnings.
00:05:35.939 - 00:05:38.375, Speaker B: I'm sure maybe you guys will push back on some of them.
00:05:39.475 - 00:05:44.059, Speaker A: Sure. You've been taking notes. Okay. Meanwhile, he's learning.
00:05:44.147 - 00:05:45.815, Speaker C: He's actually learning, guys.
00:05:46.475 - 00:05:53.121, Speaker A: He's learning. I see. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is continuing to edge. It's edging at 99.3 now.
00:05:53.233 - 00:05:55.925, Speaker B: So we'll be following this closely.
00:05:56.705 - 00:06:29.495, Speaker A: Yes. But tell us, Justin, what are your learnings? And by the way, like, I've talked to very serious VCs, multiple of them, and liquid funds. I have heard from about seven serious VCs that everybody knows that they have hired a kid 20 to 25 years old and given them each. They've all independently come up with the same idea. They hired somebody, give them a million bucks, and then told them to just like start punting memes and they're all like, oh, my guy's up 3x up to 3 million. I don't know, do I give him more? This. This is what's happening right now.
00:06:30.395 - 00:06:56.965, Speaker B: I mean, that's what I did at a slightly smaller scale, but that was. That's exactly what I did. Like, I realized I'm not going to be this TikTok guy, but I know people that will. In any case, the first and most important finding I had is like, I was on Twitter a lot and I was holding Ethan sad. And you see all these tweets of like, people putting 200 in and getting, you know, million dollar returns. But, like, the first and foremost thing I earned is meme coins are not at all easy mode. I think it's actually like, much harder than even holding eth.
00:06:56.965 - 00:07:13.699, Speaker B: Right. Like, if you hold eth, you're sad. You underperformed, but it's still gone up and it's a safe hold. Meme coins are not at all easy mode. It's much harder. Like, the one tricky thing is you really only have one out and that's a listing. Like, the benefit of these tech alts, the majors, etc, is there's.
00:07:13.699 - 00:07:24.655, Speaker B: They can have catalysts, there's announcements, news, performance on the project, etc. The only thing these meme coins have for an out is listings. And so it makes it very scary to hold these things.
00:07:26.755 - 00:07:38.885, Speaker A: There's like a poly market for, you know, what's going to be the next coinbase listing. And you have like popcat, top of the list. And, you know, people are speculating what's going to be after.
00:07:38.925 - 00:07:42.825, Speaker B: Floki, how's it work for you, Jordy, with Your popcat.
00:07:43.645 - 00:07:52.905, Speaker A: So I, you know, I saw that tweet and I bought some popcat and I am down, you know, a good percentage unfortunately. So it's okay.
00:07:53.765 - 00:07:56.229, Speaker C: The cat's still popping. Don't worry. It's still popping.
00:07:56.277 - 00:07:59.745, Speaker A: Still popping. And I'm a chill guy now, so it's all good.
00:08:00.805 - 00:08:18.573, Speaker B: Being a chill guy is the most important. But like, it is crazy how quick, like neck breakingly quick these things move and like you really can't. Are not safe in any of the these things. Like I talked about it before, but like, first we had. It was a dog with a hat on it. Then we had like some other meme coins. Then we had mudang.
00:08:18.573 - 00:08:36.581, Speaker B: Then we had AI coins SPX6900. Now we're on chill guy. Like, what's the next thing? It's so quick. You have to be so on stop on top of this stuff, which makes it really hard and stressful. It is really fun though. Like, I don't know, I've had a lot of fun, you know, quote unquote in the trenches. Um, it is like a hyper casino, right?
00:08:36.693 - 00:09:12.431, Speaker A: It's a hyper casino and you have to. I think the fun part is you have to imagine what everybody else is going to do. So you have to make a bet on like not what you think is good, but what you think other people will think other people think is good. You just have to go down the levels and so obviously visibility matters and listings matter. And we've seen listings still be effective. There's update listings, there's coinbase listings, there's Binance Futures, Binance Spot, and then there's Robinhood listings. Those are the big ones.
00:09:12.431 - 00:09:23.795, Speaker A: And everyone's following and taking off the list. Which one's next? I think once you get all of them, maybe that's the final exit pump and something like, I think Bonk has almost all of them. Maybe it's like one left.
00:09:25.825 - 00:09:26.561, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:26.713 - 00:09:52.535, Speaker B: So you know what? My, my big takeaway from all this though, which, like, I'm happy I came to this realization if you don't want to be perpetually online trying to time these rotations perfectly, like, the better thing is to just own soul. And so that's what I'm graduating to now. Like Seoul I think is sort of this like barometer for how meme coins are doing. I mean, that's what it's for right now. And so that's, that's sort of where I'm at. I'm not trying to hold any of these things long term except for know, trying to be a chill guy.
00:09:54.835 - 00:10:12.695, Speaker C: I have a question for Jordy, actually, because I think yesterday Salana hit an all time high in USD price and I think one of your predictions was, you know, with all the unlocks that wouldn't happen. So has your views changed on like a soleUSD and you know, it probably goes into price discovery at some point, right? Like what are your views on the asset now?
00:10:13.395 - 00:10:45.569, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the decentralized NASDAQ thing, as I've said in the past, is just a complete wash. This is like nowhere near reality. However, it is backdoored into decentralized Macau, which is worth infinitely more than decentralized Nasdaq and it is the greatest casino on earth right now. There's no question about it. If you're launching a coin, the liquidity is on Solana. So you will be most likely choosing that, which is a sad state of affairs for Eth because theoretically there is a ton of TVL there. But those guys are not gonna.
00:10:45.569 - 00:11:16.215, Speaker A: The velocity of money is very different. So you might have 10 times as much stables on Ethereum, but they're not moving. They're just sitting there. And you know, in Treasuries and in safe wallets, meanwhile, there's 10 times less money on Solana. But you know, people are paying 2% photon fees and you know, just punting around. It's moving, the velocity is huge. And you have to be, you know, seriously considering launching anything on Solana on the token side right now.
00:11:16.215 - 00:11:46.419, Speaker A: But on the price of Solana we've talked about in the past, it is a meme coin. There is no specific, you know, huge value accrual right now. And I love that. You know, I respect the chain, I respect the builders. I saw this tweet. I don't fully agree that, you know, I wouldn't say that nobody scammed retail more than Solana, as duo9 has, has said here. But this was my point on my prediction and I think, you know, obviously got this prediction wrong.
00:11:46.419 - 00:12:08.627, Speaker A: We have hit an all time high, which is very surprising to me. But he's saying Saul's market cap has doubled, yet its price is still, you know, it's the same price. This is the definition of inflation. It hidden tax. Every Solana fanboy pays. So this is what I realized, you know, two years ago. We're back at the same high, but actually the market cap is massive and this will continue to happen.
00:12:08.627 - 00:12:40.261, Speaker A: This is kind of what we saw with Lido where the price is always 1:1 to $2. Meanwhile, the market cap of this thing is like just getting massive because there's, there's unlocks. Congrats to Solana holders. I mean, just a huge win. You know, I stand corrected. I think the March unlocks are still in the horizon and I, I just personally don't want to own something that's going to unlock a huge chunk, you know, in three months. But for everybody who caught that trade, congrats.
00:12:40.261 - 00:12:41.385, Speaker A: It's a huge one.
00:12:42.165 - 00:13:08.393, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess. Going back to the Eric Wall tweet, we talked about this market cap going up, the overproduction of tokens, and I think I'm reading the chat right now. Everyone's just saying, my green dildo, I'm not going to pull it up, at least not yet, unless Hibiko hits 100k. But I just don't think we see this crazy alt season. There's too many tokens, there's too many memes. Right. I feel like most of the Alton Tech coins are.
00:13:08.449 - 00:13:26.445, Speaker B: But we are, but we are. Like, I think there's some confusion here. Like we are seeing an alt season as we speak right now. Like, yes, it has not come to certain tech alts and eth. But just look at these coins that everyone accepts are dead, right? Like XRP up 70% on the week. Cardano up 50. Avalanche 26%.
00:13:26.445 - 00:13:40.901, Speaker B: Polka dot, 28%. Stellar lumens. I don't even think anyone here knows what that does. Up 120%. 100 for Hedera. Like, I think it actually is an alt season happening right now. Mantra up 122%.
00:13:40.901 - 00:13:43.749, Speaker B: It's 44%. It's an alt season.
00:13:43.917 - 00:14:30.445, Speaker A: These are all the old, old coins. And this is a segment I like to call Revenge of the Dinos. So I don't, I don't think that they can keep pumping personally because generally like their market caps are super high. But it is indicative of something. It's indicative of the type of user that is coming in the market right now. And I think these are last, last cycle people who lost money checked out and now they're seeing the headlines, they're coming back in and they just remember these are the familiar tickers that they remember. Plus if you add a little bit of spice, which is that I think Charles Hoskinson and some of the xrp, you know, people might be as part of this.
00:14:30.445 - 00:14:42.903, Speaker A: Not the cabinet, but you know, on the advice Advisory Council. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gives another reason by as they say.
00:14:43.079 - 00:15:00.395, Speaker B: But Turkey, if this isn't, if this isn't an alt season, like I mean, it is, in my opinion, it's just not hitting like the alts we would expect, right? Like we would have probably expected even some major tech alts like TIA, etc, etc to do well. But it is an all season. I mean, all the junk is going up like crazy.
00:15:00.925 - 00:15:30.031, Speaker C: Yeah, I think you're right. I think there's an alt season in the sex coins, like decentralized exchange coins that has good listings and then the question is. Or that has a good distribution. And the question is, will it trickle down to even? Or is this like coins that everyone else owns, at least on crypto Twitter? Maybe it's not an alt season for crypto Twitter, but it's an alt season for retail. And the left curves. Well, yeah, I have no idea. I have a feeling that it's going to continue being that way.
00:15:30.031 - 00:15:52.155, Speaker C: I think most of the tech coins might have headwinds on the horizon. And these older meme coins, right, like xrp, ada, they're all meme coins, right? I think they're. They're going to just do well. I just can't, for the goodness of my heart buy these things. I just don't believe enough. So I'm just going to do like a barbell of majors and memes and just navigate the cycle that way.
00:15:53.235 - 00:16:07.175, Speaker A: That is the. That is the Warren Buffett way. I. I saw a tweet here and can you click this tweet? I'm gonna tell my kids. I'm gonna tell my kids this was Warren Buffett. Let's put the clip on. Justin, let's put the clip on.
00:16:07.755 - 00:16:22.555, Speaker C: Oh, hi. It's pumping. Meme coin super cycle. AI super cycle. Combine that AI meme coin omega cycle. It's omega cycle. This is the AI meme coin omega cycle.
00:16:22.635 - 00:16:23.655, Speaker A: Omega.
00:16:24.015 - 00:16:34.647, Speaker C: Think about it. It kind of makes sense, you know. Hi. It's the Omega cycle, guys. You know, the. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You know, one plus one equals three.
00:16:34.647 - 00:16:39.623, Speaker C: AI super cycle. Meme coin super cycle. Bam, boom, turkey.
00:16:39.639 - 00:16:58.415, Speaker B: I want to. So I want to ask you on this. So Murad, like, I think you've even shared, like, Murad was maybe too early in finalizing his list. Like he. His list finalized in the SPX era. Like, he never added the AI memes. Is there a chance you're doing that with the AI meme sector? I mean, we've now seen the meta shift to these TikTok memes.
00:16:58.415 - 00:16:59.995, Speaker B: Like, what are your thoughts there?
00:17:00.375 - 00:17:03.995, Speaker C: Are you saying that. Am I topping the AI memes? Is that the question?
00:17:04.335 - 00:17:17.155, Speaker B: I'M not necessarily saying you're topping it. I'm just saying, like, do you think you finalized your thesis when my thesis is that these things rotate at breakneck speed. Every two weeks there's a new meta and yours is that the AI Meme coin super cycle is real.
00:17:18.695 - 00:17:28.359, Speaker C: I mean, I mean, I haven't really finalized my AI Meme list for one. I also own like tick tock memes. I also own like, you know, Elon related memes.
00:17:28.407 - 00:17:30.135, Speaker B: Are you a chill guy, Ty?
00:17:30.295 - 00:17:41.035, Speaker C: I. I am. I'm not a chill guy, unfortunately. How am I the only. Like, last week I. I was the only one buying memes and now both of you own show guy. This is, this is ridiculous.
00:17:41.035 - 00:17:45.715, Speaker C: Do I need to buy. Do I need to accelerate accelerated?
00:17:46.725 - 00:18:15.033, Speaker A: Okay, so let's, let's, let's add some structure maybe. So we do have these AI Meme coins. I was at a event with a lot of big wigs like Ansem and these guys a few days ago, and I will, I will say that the AI meme coin or just the AI web 3 space is top of mind for a lot of people. The top ones, you know, obviously we had goat. It's having a little bit of a dip. Taiki. I saw the.
00:18:15.033 - 00:18:45.207, Speaker A: I think there's like two reasons. Maybe one is the creator just tweeted out. I mean, we have this tweet if you guys can bring up. But he just said, cool. Goatsi was a success. What should I do next? Which kind of implies like, you know, this is not the end all be all, you know, of his priority. Like, maybe he just like launches something else and it sort of becomes this abandoned project.
00:18:45.207 - 00:19:08.487, Speaker A: And don't forget we had Baron Trump, who is the, the son of the president, the Lisan Al Gabe. He is like the future potential president. He made a coin as girly, like kind of, you know, proved. And that coin is trading at like, like cents. Like I think djt they restore the.
00:19:08.511 - 00:19:10.671, Speaker B: Republic token or djt.
00:19:10.863 - 00:19:34.591, Speaker A: No, this is the, the one that there was a big bet going on between Shkreli and he was trying to bet GCR on, on whether this coin is real. Let me, let me find this deck screener for you. But, you know, once a coin gets abandoned, doesn't matter what the provenance is, it's not going to do particularly well. Yeah.
00:19:34.623 - 00:19:39.207, Speaker C: So is the question, like, am I worried that the AI meme is like a fad and it's going to go to zero?
00:19:39.271 - 00:19:48.359, Speaker A: No. No, I'm not. I'm not like mid curve enough to ask that. I'm just saying, like, go to specifically, like, is go, like, not if you.
00:19:48.367 - 00:19:52.675, Speaker C: Want to share it. This one, right? You're referring to Jordy?
00:19:54.575 - 00:20:11.145, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, yeah. You see, like, immediately, like, thread guy says, no, bro. Like, all the traders understand that this is super bearish. You never tweet this. You never tweet this. There's nothing next you got to stick to.
00:20:11.145 - 00:20:22.065, Speaker A: It's like a founder starting a new protocol, and you still have the coin from the old protocol. You want at least an airdrop of the new one to the old one. You need something.
00:20:22.645 - 00:20:34.755, Speaker B: But it's not just that. It's like, we've also Observed there's this $1 billion cap that these things, the popular trends, you know, hit that one billion dollar cap and then they sort of like, fizzle out. I don't know. Is that part of it as well?
00:20:36.615 - 00:20:49.775, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess. People want a 10x. So to buy goat at 1, you have to expect to hit 10, which is kind of like a tough stretch. So it's like, hard to get marginal buyers, especially when show guys pumping the other.
00:20:49.815 - 00:21:05.735, Speaker A: The other thing that happened is there's been some soundtrack releases by these AIs. Have any of you guys listened to the soundtrack releases? There's been, obviously, Cerebro and even Truth Terminal has put out a soundtrack. Have you guys listened?
00:21:06.475 - 00:21:32.125, Speaker C: I've listened to it. Yeah. It's pretty good. But anyone can make a soundtrack like that. I forget what the AI music website was, but it doesn't take a genius to create a good soundtrack. I guess, like, the bearish part of the AI memes is that there's like, too many agents launching every single day and the tech is getting better, so it kind of dilutes. Dilutes the tech aspect.
00:21:32.125 - 00:21:36.409, Speaker C: So on the provenance, it sounds like.
00:21:36.417 - 00:21:38.165, Speaker B: A mariachi band.
00:21:40.745 - 00:21:41.257, Speaker C: Or something.
00:21:41.321 - 00:22:12.385, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll share it. So this is the amazing song the Goats See Singularity is Near by by Truth Terminal. So if you play like the last maybe like, you know, 20 seconds towards the end. Cool.
00:22:12.765 - 00:22:14.745, Speaker C: He doesn't know what it is, but it's near.
00:22:15.775 - 00:22:37.635, Speaker A: Yeah, it's ridiculous. Yeah, you know, it was a bit catchy. I was like, singing it, you know, I don't know what the singularity is, but it's near. Maybe it's because I'm sleep deprived. Somebody in the chat noted I have a new ring. This is an URA ring. And if you guys are curious to see my sleep score, you know, during this week, it's pretty.
00:22:37.635 - 00:22:55.495, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not Brian Johnson level, I'll assure you. But, yeah, you know, these soundtracks are interesting. I think the whole concept of AI generated output is going to keep getting crazier and crazier.
00:22:56.635 - 00:23:22.151, Speaker B: I saw Chopping Blocks take on this, and Haseeb basically said, it's like these AI meme coins are like watching an elephant paint. Meaning, like, truth Terminal. Truth Terminal is like watching an elephant paint where the first time you see it, it's super interesting. You're like, oh, my God, an AI agent is tweeting. But then after a while you realize, like, it's just not that good. It's not that interesting. And, like, how many elephants painting are you interested in watching? I think that's also playing a part too.
00:23:22.151 - 00:23:28.195, Speaker B: Like, I'm just not sure, like, how engaging these. These feeds are going to be. Right.
00:23:28.655 - 00:23:50.875, Speaker A: Yeah. So actually, I was with Haseeb as well, with Ansem, and we were discussing this. He used the same analogy. I think it's wrong for a couple reasons. One, so Haseeb is like, oh, you know, maybe human meme coins are going to be treated better. Because when you look at the World Championship of chess, we watch two people play. We don't want to watch two AIs, like, play against each other.
00:23:50.875 - 00:24:38.797, Speaker A: I think it's the wrong analogy, though, because first of all, if it's people, like, you know, you can check them and you can see that they're human, but if it's online, you have no way to check if it's actually like a human using an AI or just an AI. Like, these things are unknown. So it's more like online poker, where people can cheat and they can use computer assistance without knowing it. So you can never prove it's actually a human at some point. So I don't think it stands. And I'm a firm believer that we will see a lot more innovation in this agent space. I'm talking to several teams that are doing some really interesting stuff, and I think we're going to get the cults.
00:24:38.797 - 00:24:52.865, Speaker A: We're going to get the cults. Eventually we will see the culmination of tokenization, which is cult private money. Private money is the end goal.
00:24:53.845 - 00:24:56.927, Speaker C: Omega cycle. Omega cycle.
00:24:57.071 - 00:25:00.075, Speaker B: So just be chill. It's all good.
00:25:01.375 - 00:25:08.395, Speaker C: You mentioned earlier, like, all these funds, they're giving these, like, zoomers a million dollars. Like, have you. Have you considered doing that for Cellini or.
00:25:08.975 - 00:25:09.431, Speaker B: No?
00:25:09.503 - 00:25:10.983, Speaker C: Is it a work in progress?
00:25:11.119 - 00:25:15.755, Speaker B: That's Jordy's doing that, right? I mean, you said you're sleep drift prived. You've Been in the trenches yourself.
00:25:17.735 - 00:25:50.187, Speaker A: So you know, we're starting to, we're going to market make. Chill guy. We're going to market make some of the big meme coins and, and, and maybe have some upside there, but in terms of just like giving, giving a kid money to do it, I don't know. It is a different world. I agree with you guys and I've seen it. You have all these terminals and the tools. It's stuff like it's checking fresh wallets, being funded by sexes and whether those wallets are buying coins.
00:25:50.187 - 00:26:13.595, Speaker A: You know, this is a very bullish thing. It means like someone insiders are doing this. There's like obviously like the execution tools like the bonk bots and the photons and these things as well. I think it's a great casino. But yeah, I'm not ready to give a kid a million bucks and see what happens yet.
00:26:14.015 - 00:26:36.203, Speaker B: Yeah, I've spent like hours looking at this screen, like possibly even days. This is meme Scope on photon. So you can see like the newly created pump fun coins, the ones about to graduate the bottom curve and the graduated ones. And this thing will just fry your brain if you stare at this thing too long. It's absolutely insane. Like trying to, to figure out what, like what could work, what won't work. I, I don't know.
00:26:36.203 - 00:27:04.047, Speaker B: The one takeaway I have is like I was listening to the Good Game podcast and it's a great podcast. I love it. The alliance guys are obviously brilliant, but they were saying like it's still possible to turn $10,000 to 10 million in memes. I think that was, that was the number they were saying or 10,000 to 1 million. And I think you really just, that's really just a luck game more than a skill game. Like they, they were kind of coming at this like if you're just pay attention enough, follow the culture, you can get there. But I, I think it's much, much more luck driven.
00:27:04.047 - 00:27:05.515, Speaker B: I don't know about you guys.
00:27:07.135 - 00:27:37.545, Speaker A: Yeah, of course it is, but it doesn't really matter. I mean it's a dream. Exactly. That's exactly what I was going to say. That's, that's kind of what seems fold. I was, I was meeting with very successful crypto person for lunch and they said that, you know, Bitcoin 100k at this point if you're very rich, you like bitcoin and if you're not very rich, you don't like bitcoin. And it's true, like if you're very wealthy you love the concept because you know you can afford it, you can put a ton of money in it.
00:27:37.545 - 00:28:11.845, Speaker A: You can, you know, you can just store it there. If you're not very wealthy then. Can you hold these relevant, man? I mean, let's put this tweet up. This is the FUBAR Tweet here on ETH Plus BTC. We're still waiting for 100k Bitcoin. We're at 99, but if you add Ethan BTC together then it's 100k and you got Lebron James as bitcoin and brawny as Ethan. So this is the state of affairs right now.
00:28:14.145 - 00:28:53.145, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I just expect this to continue because obviously bitcoin is going to hit 100k, right? And people see that, they want to make money. People come to crypto to make money. I feel like most of things like defi, I'm bullish to tech. But the token side is kind of like mostly solved and the meme coin meta is unsolved because we don't really know what the fuck's happening here. So people will just naturally look for gains in the meme coin sector. Most will get hosed and rinsed, but there's going to be more capital coming to the space, whether you or I like it or not. I'm not even sure if my AI omega cycle is going to come into effect, but that's kind of where I'm betting on.
00:28:53.145 - 00:29:15.985, Speaker C: That's where I have delusional conviction in. And if I expect dog money to rotate to AI money, then hopefully the AI tech gets better, agents become funnier or like just better in general. And yeah, just like chilling bitcoin, right? Just chill. Bitcoin eats, Lana. It's going to benefit from PvE and then look for the convexity in the memes. I think that's mostly how people in retail will position that probably.
00:29:18.125 - 00:29:47.615, Speaker A: I mean we're. An interesting point right now. It's been a few weeks in the election and there's been no break in the bullish market charts. Like everything just hasn't even had a 10 correction. I think it's been non stop. What happens in this case is that the leverage bull tards, let's call them, just like go wild and they just keep, keep leveraging. We can bring up the funding rates and we can see some of the, the cost.
00:29:47.615 - 00:30:01.917, Speaker A: This is the cost of money. This is the cost of leverage. This is what people are paying. If you click on the one year here, Justin, click on one year, you can, you can look at the annualized there, you know, go to Bybit. I mean, look at that. Like Doge. 90% annualized.
00:30:01.917 - 00:30:02.885, Speaker A: Like, even Bitcoin.
00:30:02.965 - 00:30:03.461, Speaker B: Wow.
00:30:03.573 - 00:30:20.549, Speaker A: You know, 70, basically, like, if. If you have stable coins right now, you can just get 50%, like, no problem. Like, you, you know, there's. It's just sitting there. You know, you. You buy this, you buy. Ethan, in short, the perp, or Doge short, the perp.
00:30:20.549 - 00:30:33.485, Speaker A: You're getting, you know, 90% annualized. This is how desperate people are to just jump onto the train because there hasn't been a single flush out. So we kind of forgot what it's like to feel desperate.
00:30:34.945 - 00:30:44.925, Speaker C: Yeah, but there's a lot of my. Right, because, like, more dollars flow into the system to capture this, and then if some of that stick around, maybe that's bullish, but. Sorry, Justin, go for it.
00:30:45.665 - 00:31:14.865, Speaker B: No, I was gonna say, like, in a lot of my group chats, people are saying, well, like, if the strategic reserve is passed or, you know, once Trump's actually in office and we have actual bullish catalysts happening. I've noticed people are raising their price targets. Have you guys seen that as well? And is that a possible top signal or a sign of froth? Like, Before, I thought 150k was like a great target for this cycle, but now everyone's saying 200, 300, 400k, which seems astronomical. Have you guys been raising your price targets as well, or. With all the news.
00:31:17.285 - 00:31:49.197, Speaker A: I have, I think, I think you have to. I. I thought that my target for this cycle for bitcoin was like, you know, in like the 125 kind of range, given the speed of, you know, volatility and the movements. Yeah, I mean, I can see, you know, 190, something like that. I think, like, the three four hundreds are a little bit out of. Out of, out of pocket. Just the amount of trillions of dollars is significant.
00:31:49.197 - 00:31:59.345, Speaker A: We would have to see something like a new bitcoin reserve that's a real one where they're buying. They're not just, you know, moving around the DOJ tokens.
00:32:00.965 - 00:32:30.561, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's really hard, right? I guess, like all the normies that's texted me in the past couple weeks, they're asking me if they should sell. I think the real top happens when they start buying and then they make like 3x, they feel super confident, then they deposit more money, and that's usually like, when the top is right. So I think, I think there's still time. There's still time. I have no idea how long it'll be. But you want like a humble but djen portfolio. I think just resist.
00:32:30.561 - 00:32:37.605, Speaker C: Like, you can weather volatility, but you still get upside. I'm still trying to figure out what that is, but yeah, I'll be much more.
00:32:38.145 - 00:33:02.033, Speaker A: Let's get some questions in the chat if you guys want to do a quick QA in the meantime while we're waiting for the questions like. And subscribe everybody, we will. We'll keep grinding through this bear market. And even though my sleep score is a is a solid 62, five hours of sleep, I'm still here grinding with you guys.
00:33:02.089 - 00:33:42.701, Speaker B: So I'll kick us off with a question near and dear to my heart. So, P.S. asks, is Eth really dead? I've obviously been thinking about this a lot, especially with the beam chain roadmap. There's like a lot of interesting takes out there, but the one thing that I think is the most convincing to me that ETH will perform well or catch up somewhat in this cycle is that we're seeing these dinos outperform. In my opinion, if xrp, Cardano, Hedera, Hashgraph, all of these tokens we're not even familiar with can have these crazy gains. I think ETH will as well. And it sort of reminds me of a couple days ago, I watched this YouTube video of a non crypto person talking about how to get into crypto for the bull cycle.
00:33:42.701 - 00:33:57.785, Speaker B: And he was basically saying, think of the coin. The worst coin you can think of is probably going to pump the most. And that's sort of actually what's happening. And so like, with that logic alone, I don't think ETH ever really, quote, unquote, dies. I actually do think it will catch up this cycle. I don't know if you guys are on the same page.
00:33:59.805 - 00:34:26.399, Speaker A: It'Ll have sudden moments of catch up. And I think it's still the most obvious trade in crypto. Always been, always has been. You know, bitcoin pumps, people will rotate into eth. It's just the natural, you know, gold, silver thing and it's always going to happen. And now you can play it on tradfi as well. You don't need to even play it on crypto because there is a chart which is the ETH BTC chart in TradFi.
00:34:26.399 - 00:34:54.799, Speaker A: Can you, can you bring up this Nani Nanny tweet? Yes, shout out to nanny. So he says my ass off. They admitted a real thing in tradfi. And if you, if you look at the chart, this is the coinbase yeah. So, so this is Coinbase micro strategy. So Coinbase, you know, it has base, which is an ETH L2. So it's kind of like ETH and MicroStrategy obviously just like leverage Bitcoin.
00:34:54.799 - 00:34:57.695, Speaker A: So and this chart is down only.
00:34:58.115 - 00:35:05.895, Speaker B: And Coinbase is like the ETH aligned company, right? Like for whatever reason, they do feel very much ETH aligned. So that's interesting.
00:35:06.715 - 00:35:50.205, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Coinbase obviously has done tremendously well, but MicroStrategy went banana zone a couple days ago. There's people buying calls on it. The premium over the underlying bitcoin they hold just grew massively until Citron Research, I think, shorted some and kind of popped a bubble, at least for now. But it's a very interesting setup and I've seen the Michael Saylor discussion on why it trades at a premium. So basically, like, if you add up all the bitcoin to hold, the market cap of the stock is still a lot higher. And he's saying this because they're, you know, they're creating value by leveraging like they're, it's worth more than the underlying bitcoin. Like as a vehicle they create value and that's a premium.
00:35:50.205 - 00:35:52.805, Speaker A: And I think maybe, maybe that makes sense.
00:35:53.505 - 00:36:00.605, Speaker B: Taiki, I guess this question is mostly for you, but what would cause you to switch back to utility from memes, if anything?
00:36:03.665 - 00:36:58.795, Speaker C: Oh, I see, I see. It's hard because I've been mid curving for 730 days, right? And in that period I've just come to the conclusion that most of these utility coins are pretty fairly valued. I'm still looking at them, right? Like, I'm not completely abandoning them, but I've just internalized that most of these, like, you know, there isn't much juice. So for me to pivot to like a utility coin, it has to I guess fit the current zeitgeist of the meta. So for example, like on Solana Radium, the defi coin, the dexcoin has been pumping because it's meme coin infra on base chain like virtuals is doing well because it's like, you know, the AI agent Launchpad. So whatever meta that exists that's hot, maybe you can like buy the infra because it's like utility and you don't have to pick a meme coin, individual meme coin. You can just buy like the infra that supports it.
00:36:58.795 - 00:37:24.745, Speaker C: And you could have done the same thing for Pendle as well when the points metal was starting. So I think most defi or utility coins are solved for now. So the valuations are fair, but if there's like a new game in town, then you can kind of identify, like, a utility coin that fits that and then just like, buy that. So I would have to see, like, a new meta form. I don't know what that is, you know, but that's probably what I would have to see.
00:37:27.485 - 00:37:37.711, Speaker A: Fair enough. We're getting a lot of, like, GCR promised us 10K. Where is the 10K from GCR? Like, COVI said 10K. Yeah. Sorry, guys.
00:37:37.823 - 00:37:48.115, Speaker B: And don't forget, when Trump was looking unlikely, GCR said Trump is going to win. Bitcoin's going to pump. I forgot the other predictions, but he's been pretty spot on. Right?
00:37:48.575 - 00:38:20.285, Speaker A: Absolutely. Let's. Let's get somebody else who crushed it this week. There was a toddler, a infant that has rugged his pump fund coin to his great excitement. Can we bring up this tweet here? So a literal child spilled $30,000 dumping a meme coin. I mean, I'm sure most of our audience has seen this because this is, like, insane. And this has probably gone viral on Tick Tock and I don't know where else, but can you.
00:38:20.285 - 00:38:33.167, Speaker A: Can you open this? Let's listen to this young corporate raider. Oh, yeah.
00:38:33.311 - 00:38:35.515, Speaker C: No, he's saying no way he's getting comfy.
00:38:39.455 - 00:38:41.035, Speaker B: He just lived with 30k.
00:38:43.935 - 00:38:51.367, Speaker C: He's twerking over that, yo. He's twerking over rugging. He just rocked everyone who's working, yo.
00:38:51.391 - 00:38:52.287, Speaker B: Honestly, respect.
00:38:52.391 - 00:39:13.325, Speaker A: Honestly, Honestly, honestly, respect. I mean, he made a second coin called Sorry right after, and then he rugged it for like, another 2K. So this is the state of the market, guys. This is what's going on right now. We got infants robbing us, and we're kind of paying them for the entertainment, I guess.
00:39:13.825 - 00:39:28.805, Speaker C: Yeah, actually, we are paying them for that entertainment. And I think the people are trying to pump the old coin. Right, the quant coin. There was also, like, the funny Blockmates tweet that you shared in the chat. The new treasury manager.
00:39:29.745 - 00:39:30.193, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:30.249 - 00:39:32.753, Speaker C: Is that kid. Yeah.
00:39:32.889 - 00:39:54.125, Speaker A: Gen Z quant joins the Ethereum foundation to help with treasury management. It does seem like every freaking time, like, even when Justin Drake's on stage talking about the road map, like some stupid EF person is like, just selling ethics. Like, just. I understand some of it's programmatic or who knows what, but.
00:39:55.825 - 00:40:11.005, Speaker B: Do you guys think that could be. Is that why, for the past six months, Ethereum Classic has outperformed Eth? I don't know if you guys have been tracking that, but I think Ethereum Classic is up like 30% plus against eth, which is crazy over the last six months.
00:40:13.945 - 00:40:56.225, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, I think there's coins today that have outperformed ETH for the whole year. So I don't think like etc is somebody's asking what are VCS doing seeing their whole model evaporate because of memes since no one buys our high FTV coins. This is interesting. I have been talking to the VCS and I've been hearing some debates about, you know, what are VCS doing. So like I said one, they're like buying meme coins with some Gen Z kid that they hire. That's, that's one thing they're doing. Yeah, there's, there's a good amount of cope.
00:40:56.225 - 00:41:24.263, Speaker A: There's, there's not a lot of belief that this will last necessarily. Yeah, I don't think they have a strategy. I mean they're still raising quite, quite good amounts of money. The management performance fees are high and even like their VC coins are still doing okay. I mean you look at a lot of stuff pumping in RBC coins, so there's enough money for everything right now. The market is not differentiating very hard. We did see grass revert a little bit.
00:41:24.263 - 00:41:58.185, Speaker A: I was talking a little bit about this maybe last time that there were some people just like pyramid longing grass or somebody on Hyper Liquid that had put on like an over over 10 million position long. Yeah. So somebody was asking me like what, what has happened with this so headed 9. You are correct. He has deceased. We, we have lost them. I think the two dollar liquidation point got hit and indeed, you know there are some victims already of over leveraging and I think we'll get more.
00:42:01.365 - 00:42:18.213, Speaker C: Yeah, well so the natch natch soul Allen in the chat says you guys have been so bearish the last few few months. It's obvious. Bottom I mean we all hold eat, you know, that's. We kind of like just poke fun at it because it's.
00:42:18.269 - 00:42:37.361, Speaker B: No, I actually still stand by what I said on when the When Shift Happens podcast. I do think it's more likely than not that ETH outperforms Solana next year. And that's partly just like a mean reversion thing. I mean Solana has outperformed so massively everything else that it can't keep doing that forever. Right. So like another 3x and it, it flips eth. Right.
00:42:37.361 - 00:42:46.765, Speaker B: Like I put that as like somewhat of a cap this cycle. I think if, if we start getting the talks of the flipping. That's probably like a good indicator that Sol eth is getting a little overextended.
00:42:48.585 - 00:43:21.115, Speaker A: So we have Barry Silbert Amar is saying that the CEO of DCG decks, you know, master of the universe last cycle, telling us it's going to be a big week. It's going to be a big week. Every freaking time he said that the market was like nuking. Okay, so Barry now is like seeking redemption and he's doing it as a AI shit coiner. So he's trying to do a bunch of bit tensor sub subnets. That's, that's like the new play. So Bittensor has been like massively underperforming despite, you know, some of the strong shilling.
00:43:21.115 - 00:43:51.365, Speaker A: I think it was like the only coin that was red on the week a couple days ago when I checked. So, you know, we'll see if that emissions model, I think Eric Wall came on and was like pretty bearish on, you know, this emissions model. But if Barry is seeking redemption, maybe there's a chance, I mean maybe there is enough of a mind share there that some, some good stuff gets built. But for now it feels like the virtuals and the spectral and some of these things are, are more where things are happening right now.
00:43:52.545 - 00:44:03.745, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like when the AI memes start pumping, it's bearish. Tao, because TAO was the original AI meme. But you know, there's more upside in the pump fund. AI memes.
00:44:04.045 - 00:44:41.075, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's explain why. Because if you talk to any liquid funds, if they want access to a category, they just buy the category leader. And when it was like tao, they don't think about it twice like, oh, you want AI crypto exposure, you buy this coin and you know, you go do other stuff. And I think losing that number one slot, not that they've lost it yet, but you know, just sort of like having other things interfere with it being a no brainer. You know, it can affect the flows quite a lot and maybe cause some rotations. So yeah, it's down on the week, which is kind of insane to see.
00:44:41.075 - 00:44:45.995, Speaker A: So I'm not, I'm not quite sure what's going on.
00:44:46.335 - 00:45:19.195, Speaker C: Sorry, this isn't related, but I was reading the chat and I had this question, but last cycle it was like the Alta one trade, right? Like eth killers, they pumped bigly and things like sui. I never thought that it would get to 37 bill ftv and whatnot. And I guess the narrative is Salana killers. Do you think that these new SUI after, do you think they can actually sustainably pump 200 billion. I've been coping from the sidelines and I think you know Jody has like a funny tweet that he wants to share.
00:45:19.235 - 00:45:47.365, Speaker A: But I mean Sui like yeah, we'll show the tweet. They've been doing the whole playbook. You know you have a very performant chain. It's very quick to act and occasionally goes down for 51 minutes as it just did. So this guy fishy catfish says Sui dink doing everything it can to be the next Solana. And of course we all remember Solana going down you know frequently last cycle and now Sui is going down for no, no blocks for an hour.
00:45:47.705 - 00:46:33.865, Speaker B: Ty, you guys both said it yourself, right? It's a dream. And I think if you're coming in this cycle now you see all of like the crypto OGs, the people that have been through the bear market the last couple years have made all their money on Seoul and so like what's the ketchup trade? It's things like Sui, it's going to be monad, it's going to be be chain. It's going to be those new chains that are launching and the ones that are just getting started now. I, I think that personally outperform. I think we see the same alt L1 rotation as we did last time. Yeah because even actually, even ansem has said like his goal for his target and I think Kobe corroborated this for Seoul is like a thousand dollar soul which obviously that would be like extremely impressive but that's a 4x from here. Like is that, is that dream really alive for people that are coming in now? They're like you said they're looking for a TedX.
00:46:35.445 - 00:46:57.743, Speaker A: Once you get close the targets always go up. You know it's moving goalposts, they'll just start saying it's 10k, you know like whatever. So potato my boy potato here is asking on hyperliquid. We've talked about hyperlipid in the past. I know you guys have used hyperlipid but is the. It's an interesting question. We're still waiting to see the tokenomics.
00:46:57.743 - 00:47:27.921, Speaker A: It's hard to say. I think FTV wise at this point the pre markets are you know, 4 or 5 billion. I'm a little bit conflicted on how the launch is going to go. Initially people were thinking there was going to be a lot of selling and then you know you, you could catch this sort of reversion. Everyone seems to think it's non consensus to be bullish Hyperlink. It's actually like extremely consensus. Literally everyone is bullish.
00:47:27.921 - 00:47:52.735, Speaker A: Hyper liquid. There's funds that are just preparing to buy exposure on the launch. So I think it's one of those things that people think that they're not mid cribbing, but it's just so consensus. I don't know what that means. Like, does that mean that it just goes straight to 10 billion or it's already priced in because there's no other buy? I'm not quite sure, but it's very consensus. It's a very consensus. I mean, no one's not bullish.
00:47:54.635 - 00:48:17.329, Speaker C: I guess. So. I, I, no, I, I think not every fund can buy initially because I don't think it has like Fireblocks integration. So maybe some funds will be forced to just wait a few months or something. So maybe it'll allow retail to buy in, you know, cheap. But I mean, yeah, like, if everyone's bullish, then it'll launch by anyways. Right? I'm not playing this on my.
00:48:17.377 - 00:48:39.291, Speaker A: They're otcing already. They're just, they're, they don't need Firebucks. They're, they're gonna otc. They can OTC limit orders. Like we've had, We've had people ask us to just buy for them at a certain price level and we can just limit order, put it in and just sell it to them. So they're gonna buy. They're not going to wait for Firebucks.
00:48:39.291 - 00:48:40.815, Speaker A: No one's waiting for Fireblocks.
00:48:41.435 - 00:48:43.627, Speaker C: Got it? Yeah. Yeah.
00:48:43.771 - 00:48:57.475, Speaker A: I think the big question, are they gonna get finance? Like, are they going to get centralized exchanges? And if without centralized exchanges, is there a cap literally just on the amount of dollars that can go in without a Binance, can you get to, you know, over 5 billion?
00:48:57.815 - 00:49:03.271, Speaker B: Well, is the thinking that Binance wouldn't list them because they're competitive or No.
00:49:03.343 - 00:49:27.185, Speaker A: I think because they will not engage with them and like, do all the listing fee and like all the other stuff. I think that's more the reason centralized exchanges don't take Dex as seriously. Even one as hyped as hyper Liquid. There's no one at Binance saying like, oh, these guys are going to compete with our business model. They just literally don't believe it. They've heard it so many times. Dydx.
00:49:27.185 - 00:49:34.225, Speaker A: It just never happens. And I think they, they've, maybe to their detriment, maybe they're gonna be wrong. It's gonna be the boy who cried wolf.
00:49:34.725 - 00:49:35.465, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:36.285 - 00:49:45.475, Speaker A: Nobody I talked to at centralized exchanges tries to Avoid the competition of a dax. They don't see it that way. Maybe they should, but they don't.
00:49:47.175 - 00:49:56.875, Speaker C: Yeah, it is like a cult forming though. The community is super strong. I wouldn't bet against it. Maybe.
00:49:58.615 - 00:50:08.635, Speaker B: Cracked me up. Sorry I'm late, lads. The episode literally dropped at the same time as a new Kendrick Lamar album had to run through real quick. No worries. Thanks for joining.
00:50:11.085 - 00:50:27.693, Speaker A: Cool, guys. So we were hoping to get a Bitcoin 100k run up. I think we're stuck at 99. Like, we're still edging. No gooning yet. I'm not sure if it's gonna happen today. We can do some pastas maybe and.
00:50:27.693 - 00:50:30.145, Speaker A: And see if we get like a sudden God candle.
00:50:31.205 - 00:50:42.823, Speaker C: Yeah, if everyone watching you all buy, we can pump it. Come on, guys. You have to collectively do this. Do it.
00:50:42.839 - 00:50:46.595, Speaker A: For the deed, I think we need Michael Sailor.
00:50:47.375 - 00:50:55.755, Speaker B: I have so many pastas, I don't even know where to start. You guys, can I submit like five pastas? Since we're live and we're celebrating? These things are bangers.
00:50:57.375 - 00:51:01.667, Speaker A: I don't know, Chad. How many pastas do we let Justin have? I think two. I think I get two.
00:51:01.791 - 00:51:07.051, Speaker B: Oh, geez. Okay, who wants to go first then? I gotta. I gotta figure my life out over here.
00:51:07.243 - 00:51:23.443, Speaker C: Okay, I can go first. You have mine, Justin. Yes, Just me. Just me poking fun at the eth Maxis. I saw this. I thought it was hilarious. So, like, this guy's underwater and he's like, dude, I need you to pull me up.
00:51:23.443 - 00:51:29.895, Speaker C: He just ties this thing around his neck. He's like, pull me. Pull me up, bro. So this is eat holders. When someone tries to help them with their underwater logs.
00:51:31.595 - 00:51:33.775, Speaker B: We don't want to be saved anymore. We're done.
00:51:35.235 - 00:51:39.295, Speaker C: We're just stuck. We're just chilling in the water. We're. We're chill guys in the water, right?
00:51:40.315 - 00:51:43.015, Speaker B: Yeah. Someone needs to remix this with the chill guy.
00:51:47.635 - 00:51:48.855, Speaker C: That's my pasta.
00:51:50.715 - 00:52:07.581, Speaker A: All right, I'll do. I'll do my pasta. I have a Michael Sailor interview. And this guy, I mean, he's such a good speaker. Some of the stuff he says is insane. Let's play this clip. I think.
00:52:07.581 - 00:52:10.265, Speaker A: I think we have a timestamp here. If we can get the clip up.
00:52:13.965 - 00:52:19.093, Speaker B: If you could actually send me that. I think I lost the tab here. I'll hit my pastas first.
00:52:19.269 - 00:52:20.749, Speaker A: Okay, go ahead. You go first.
00:52:20.797 - 00:52:41.055, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, here we go. So this was from Gainesy, and I'm coming around to the sentiment here. So Gainesy says spf is in prison, but Solana's at all time highs. And somehow Vitalik is free with Ethan Purgatory. They got the wrong guy, man. And this reply cracked me up even more from Shane Funk.
00:52:41.055 - 00:53:07.137, Speaker B: Look, bro, in the long run, I'll make more in here than Vitalik. So who knows, you know, as Solana has 25 years to run before SPF gets out and is able to cash in on all his. It's a lot of profits. And then in. In lieu of BTC hitting 100k, I want to share my favorite Trump video of all time. Just a fun little clip here. And I think this is true.
00:53:07.137 - 00:53:08.721, Speaker B: I think we're all getting tired of winning.
00:53:08.833 - 00:53:10.161, Speaker A: We're gonna win so much.
00:53:10.273 - 00:53:12.473, Speaker C: You may even get tired of winning.
00:53:12.569 - 00:53:26.587, Speaker A: And you'll say, please, please, it's too much winning. We can't take it anymore, Mr. President, it's too much. And I'll say, no, it isn't. We have to keep winning. We're gonna win more.
00:53:26.731 - 00:53:28.299, Speaker C: We're gonna win so much.
00:53:28.427 - 00:53:39.775, Speaker A: I love you all. Yeah. Nobody expected seven years ago that he would be talking to the crypto industry.
00:53:43.155 - 00:53:43.715, Speaker C: Welcome.
00:53:43.795 - 00:53:44.655, Speaker B: I'm very.
00:53:46.965 - 00:53:56.957, Speaker A: I think this is the Michael. Let's get the Michael Sailor. I'll get my, my pasta. And I think it's such a good pasta. Let's. Let's get Sailor on.
00:53:57.021 - 00:53:58.625, Speaker B: So is it 920?
00:53:59.525 - 00:54:02.077, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like 925 maybe. Yeah.
00:54:02.181 - 00:54:10.083, Speaker B: I think the right way to think of it is it's always going to be the stronger capital asset versus a conventional S P index.
00:54:10.229 - 00:54:12.655, Speaker A: So what's your. What's that get us to it with?
00:54:12.695 - 00:54:13.255, Speaker C: What you say?
00:54:13.295 - 00:54:16.079, Speaker B: 29 ARR. Or what's.
00:54:16.127 - 00:54:17.915, Speaker A: What's the target? What's the target?
00:54:18.255 - 00:54:30.115, Speaker B: My forecast is 13 million a coin by the year 2045. And what I tell everybody is every bitcoin you don't buy today is going to cost you $13 million in the future.
00:54:30.655 - 00:54:35.515, Speaker A: Every bitcoin you don't buy today is going to cost you 13 million in the future.
00:54:36.585 - 00:54:38.645, Speaker C: The chad. What a chad.
00:54:39.185 - 00:54:45.465, Speaker B: Well, the denominator is changing. I mean, but that is on fire.
00:54:45.545 - 00:55:02.685, Speaker A: He's on fire. Unstoppable. I mean, he's just printing, printing endless fiat, you know, poor people's money by holding his chad money. Let's get the poll up. Everybody choose. We'll, we'll have some voting going on.
00:55:03.375 - 00:55:25.395, Speaker C: Jordy, I have a. I have a question for you. Like, do you think this will end poorly? Like, like, I mean, the bears are saying this will end poorly. At some point. Right, but do you think he can continue to like financial engineer this way to Valhalla or do you think that it'll like, at some point he's gonna be like a 4 seller and it's going to create like mass FUD.
00:55:28.625 - 00:56:10.523, Speaker A: I think when Bitcoin was at 16k, he was probably like, you know, not, not too far off. If, if a couple years passed and nothing happened, he would be in trouble. But you know, he survived, he took a risk and I don't think it necessarily ends badly. My, you know, I'm, I'm glad that I didn't mid curve myself. I, I've been a bit bitcoin maxi last cycle. I don't know those of you who remember like my content, I've done all these debates, you know, taking the bitcoin side and explaining why it is a unique asset and it's different than all the other ones. When I got like really deep into the rabbit hole, I realized that bitcoin is flawed in fundamental ways.
00:56:10.523 - 00:56:56.295, Speaker A: And I don't think it's gonna, in 50 years, you know, be something that works or it's going to be like the hyperbaricanization. But here's how I matured as a person. I knew that I could mit curve myself by looking at the future and saying like, well, this has got fatal flaws, so I'm not going to buy it now. No, no, no, no, no. Like we're so far ahead of the game. You just buy now, write it for a few years while everybody like reaches the level of understanding that bitcoin maxis have and then eventually like the world will catch up to the flaws. But that, that won't take like, you know, that might take a decade once issuance goes down.
00:56:56.295 - 00:58:01.875, Speaker A: So I, I disagree unfortunately with the belief that you can buy bitcoin and then like not think about anything ever again. Because there will come a day where the reckoning happens. But I think it's maybe 10 years away and in the meantime I'm not going to mid curve it. Like, I think what other people are realizing is that this is a, an incredible example of a shelling point asset that is reflexive, that has a game theory component where, you know, China now has to start wondering, well, if Trump is going to build a national reserve, are we going to get left behind? Like, what's our strategy? And you know, we're starting to hear that they're decriminalizing crypto and stuff like this and maybe they, they don't want to fall behind. It's like that movie how I learned to Stop Worrying and love the Bomb, where, you know, in a Cold War situation, you don't want to have any. You don't want to fall behind the other superpower on anything. Doesn't matter what it is.
00:58:01.875 - 00:58:28.705, Speaker A: Like, you could just say ridiculous things and like, yeah, it's a space, space gap, but it could be like, you know, a bitcoin gap. Like they don't want to fall behind on a bitcoin gap. Like if, if countries start accumulating bitcoin and they start like, you know, measuring contest, who's got more? It becomes like this whole memetic other thing. Like, how much fiat can you print to buy this thing? So, yeah, I'm still bullish. I think it's going higher and I'm not going to mid curve it yet.
00:58:29.285 - 00:58:43.185, Speaker B: It looks like we have the results of the poll. And then also a hilarious comment from Nick. So congrats, Jordy, it looks like you dominated pasta. But Nick here, remember Jordy on Bankless and the Luna debate? Just farming until it blows up.
00:58:45.805 - 00:58:51.065, Speaker C: That's crypto. So, Jody, you're saying there's 10 years left at least of this?
00:58:52.045 - 00:59:18.985, Speaker A: I think we have maybe like two more halvings before. So there's multiple issues with bitcoin, unfortunately. I love the space and I'm a purist. I would love bitcoin to work. I think it has three or four huge flaws. Most of them are related to the fact that the halvening is going to be a huge problem after like one or two more halvings, when no one's going to want to mine this thing. There's still no fees.
00:59:18.985 - 01:00:03.437, Speaker A: There's no, you know, apart from some hyper speculation on, you know, NFT runes and etc, there's just like no sustainable fees. And the other problem is, even if there was, you don't want a deflationary asset. What I'm imagining is that a deflationary asset creates all kinds of economic problems that we're not thinking about or used to because we're living in this money printing world. And you don't realize that the other extreme also has problems. You have really bad mobility of capital and mobility of classes, social classes, monetary classes, people can't make it up. And like, look at the Gen Z's. Like, they're not going to own any fucking bitcoin.
01:00:03.437 - 01:00:16.637, Speaker A: It's. They're too late. Okay? My generation, you know, millennials, we're going to own a fuck ton of bitcoin because we inherited our boomer assets. And we were digital native. We're Internet natives. We're the first ones. We got bitcoin.
01:00:16.637 - 01:00:45.609, Speaker A: We all have bitcoin. There's going to be the haves and have nots of bitcoin. And with no new bitcoin being printed or being created. Sounds like a good thing. Yeah, like, it's a good thing because we're so far away from sound money that, like, the concept of, like, 21 million hard cap sounds good. Sounds good. What happens when, like, there's no more coins and the people who have them don't give them to anybody? And, like, you're a fucking, you know, Gen Z kid, you're just gonna start rugging people on stream, like, what are you gonna do? You're not gonna.
01:00:45.609 - 01:00:54.127, Speaker A: You're not gonna get any bitcoin. So this is gonna be a social problem. And people are like, so it's a party time. It's a party time. It's 100k.
01:00:54.191 - 01:01:00.967, Speaker B: So do you think it'll get there? Like, it'll be so prevalent? It is, like, a huge social problem we're going to have to address in, say, 20 years, I think.
01:01:00.991 - 01:01:45.175, Speaker A: No, a lot sooner, A lot sooner. It could be, like, as little as, like, five years. Imagine next cycle, we have all the richest people in the world are crypto guys. If Bitcoin 5X's from here, there's going to be people much more money than Elon Musk, I assure you. So all these guys with, like, 100k Bitcoin, at some point there's going to be a social backlash. And despite this current loop of the game theory where it looks amazing and we kind of get everything working, you can imagine the Elizabeth Warren bullshit of these crypto people. We need to take back their money.
01:01:45.175 - 01:01:48.287, Speaker A: It's coming back, right? It's coming back.
01:01:48.431 - 01:01:52.575, Speaker C: Yeah. Keep. Keep flooding, Jordy. Bitcoin's pumping.
01:01:52.735 - 01:01:57.711, Speaker B: Yeah. I think you started this little rant five minutes ago in the last five minutes.
01:01:57.863 - 01:01:58.391, Speaker A: We did it.
01:01:58.423 - 01:01:59.207, Speaker C: We're doing it.
01:01:59.311 - 01:02:01.319, Speaker B: Not today, Jordi. Not today.
01:02:01.487 - 01:02:05.167, Speaker C: Not today. It's not today. In the long run, I am shocked.
01:02:05.191 - 01:02:12.115, Speaker B: You think it could happen in as little as five years. I mean, that would really be astonishing if we reach that level of bitcoinization.
01:02:13.315 - 01:02:37.691, Speaker A: I mean, just look how quickly it's moving. Like in the last, like, month, like, just having a US President, I think, you know, we had our viewers maybe. Listen, remember that? We had this. We had this bitcoin maxi. We did a live stream. It was. It was like, maybe not our best episode ever, because he, he was, you know, a little bit rambling, but I think it was Paul Stork.
01:02:37.691 - 01:02:44.805, Speaker A: So the thing that Paul. You guys remember this episode? It was a tough episode.
01:02:46.705 - 01:02:47.885, Speaker C: We all remember.
01:02:50.025 - 01:03:08.065, Speaker A: So in this episode there were still some interesting pieces of the things discussed. And in terms of. Sorry, what was the question?
01:03:13.285 - 01:03:16.669, Speaker C: I don't know if in five years all that matters is we're pumping in.
01:03:16.677 - 01:03:20.705, Speaker B: The short term, we have the reverse up only course curse.
01:03:23.205 - 01:03:33.863, Speaker A: Yeah. So you were saying if in five years already. Yeah, yeah.
01:03:33.879 - 01:03:59.745, Speaker B: I'm just surprised to hear you like say that. Such an accelerated timeline. Like I could see a world where there in like, you know, 20 years, this like dystopian future where all the wealthiest people were early people to bitcoin. No young people can get bitcoin. And we have this massive wealth imbalance, much greater than we have today. Because like if you look at the, the equality imbalance on chain of like, who holds the most bitcoin. I'm forgetting the name of that term for the inequality ratio.
01:03:59.745 - 01:04:18.925, Speaker B: Jordan, you might be familiar with Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient, the genie coefficient of Bitcoin is insane relative to like normal economies, especially the U.S. ethereum is much more exaggerated. Solana is much more exaggerated. It does distribute over time. But if bitcoin is like the world's reserve currency, it is going to get crazy quick.
01:04:19.345 - 01:04:36.079, Speaker A: Yeah, but in the meantime, like I said, I'm not mood probing. Everybody listening should just forget everything I ranted about for the last 10 minutes. We'll talk about it in four years. Don't worry about any of that stuff for now. It's completely irrelevant. We're not at that stage. Like the world consciousness is not at that stage.
01:04:36.079 - 01:05:04.289, Speaker A: So at this point all you need to know is like, you know, it's a reflexive asset. We are in the banana zone. I've been saying this for years. There will come a point and the point has come in which we realize that there are not enough coins. Michael Saylor has said this as well. Right now that the amount of demand compared to the amount of supply being created by mining is like exponentially imbalanced. What that means is that the amount of coins available for sale are quickly evaporating and get into a banana zone because there's just no supply.
01:05:04.289 - 01:05:20.467, Speaker A: There's no supply. Nobody wants to sell until obviously the price is kind of retarded. We can use that word again now, right? Because like Trump won. Then we'll stop using it in four years or I'm not sure.
01:05:20.491 - 01:05:21.675, Speaker B: I think that's how it works. Yeah.
01:05:21.755 - 01:05:59.733, Speaker A: Okay. One less. One last thing, though, because this is, this is the. I have to say, like, philosophically, everything, blah, blah, blah. But ET FaceTime home says. But AGI is two years away. What do I do? So this is the wrench in the whole thing because this can change the fabric of society, reality, whatever you want to call it, like AGI, if you're not thinking about it, you might suddenly, like, you know, find your world change in ways that you don't expect.
01:05:59.733 - 01:06:21.601, Speaker A: I spend a lot of time thinking about it. The. The reason I have been investing in the AI category quite heavily and I talk to a lot of the AI guys is because I want to get, you know, a lot of the latest information and thinking to be able to, you know, start digesting and processing where we're going. And to hedge.
01:06:21.633 - 01:06:22.885, Speaker C: You just buy goat.
01:06:23.465 - 01:06:34.281, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think you buy goat, buddy. So sorry. I mean, we'll just, we'll agree to disagree there. I just, you know, Truth Terminal is moving on to the next coin already, so you don't. You don't want to get stuck in the. In the old one.
01:06:34.473 - 01:06:36.405, Speaker C: Oh, no, my bags.
01:06:37.665 - 01:06:41.645, Speaker A: There's going to be new bags. Just be ready to buy the new one.
01:06:42.545 - 01:06:43.565, Speaker C: Oh, God.
01:06:44.105 - 01:06:46.765, Speaker B: We all know you're a good person, Jordy. Don't worry about it.
01:06:49.025 - 01:06:58.865, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. All right. I mean, we're hitting an hour. Maybe. Maybe we should call it. I think next week.
01:06:58.865 - 01:07:01.551, Speaker A: Maybe we'll be about 100k. It's kind of 50.
01:07:01.594 - 01:07:01.785, Speaker C: 50.
01:07:01.825 - 01:07:16.627, Speaker A: I mean, it's not 50. It's quite. It's quite decent. Decent chance. I pray that we're not at 5$Cardano and like 8$XRP by then. Otherwise we are in 3.
01:07:16.726 - 01:07:17.175, Speaker B: 300.
01:07:20.435 - 01:07:24.855, Speaker C: It's possible. Oh, man.
01:07:26.595 - 01:07:29.705, Speaker A: Cool. All right, boys, any last thoughts?
01:07:30.485 - 01:07:45.013, Speaker B: Just make sure to hit subscribe. We're trying. Our goal is to hit 10, 000 subscribers by the end of the year, and we're getting pretty close. We've had a lot of banger episodes. We're getting some big guests coming, and the more subscribers we have, the easier it is to get great guests. So we would really appreciate it. Thank you, guys.
01:07:45.149 - 01:07:46.101, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you.
01:07:46.133 - 01:07:46.317, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:07:46.341 - 01:08:01.667, Speaker A: And we. We will try. I still see, like, Thicky in the comments, people asking about Thicky. Like, we all love Thicky. We miss the key. I miss the key. You know, he said he might come back for an episode, so as soon as he's able to step away from the PC, we'll get him on.
01:08:01.771 - 01:08:13.787, Speaker C: Actually, I. I asked him. I. I asked him, and he said that he's. He'll come on once the markets start dumping. He's waiting for that. He can't come on when the market's pumping, has to be done.
01:08:13.851 - 01:08:38.824, Speaker A: You know, I understand that, like, people are. People are taking advantage of each minute that they have at the trading screen. Like, if you have an edge on the market right now, the amount of, you know, monetization that you can do is very high. Just, you know, the amount of volatility that you can capture and everything. So I understand it. We have a question. Where is Vitalik? So I think that might happen next week.
01:08:38.824 - 01:08:44.924, Speaker A: I have. I. I think we have 60% of you.
01:08:45.084 - 01:08:45.676, Speaker C: By end of year.
01:08:45.700 - 01:08:48.264, Speaker A: No, I think end of year. You think? Okay. All right.
01:08:48.604 - 01:08:54.725, Speaker C: By end of year. Right. If there's a poly market for it, it'll be price. I'll price it at 90 by end of year.
01:08:54.765 - 01:09:10.101, Speaker A: You know, I'll say this. If italic does come on, which I expect he will, bold prediction. Eth BTC that week, the week after Green dildo.
01:09:10.173 - 01:09:10.905, Speaker B: Jesus.
01:09:11.565 - 01:09:16.605, Speaker A: Okay, you got it. All right, guys, we'll see you there. Hopefully see you soon.
