00:00:00.320 - 00:00:09.390, Speaker A: Especially as we approach the halving. And then on the flip side of that, you had Saylor, who was buying, you know, $20 million of spot bitcoin every, every business day for several months. And that's also.
00:00:09.422 - 00:00:10.190, Speaker B: Yo, government.
00:00:10.262 - 00:00:16.902, Speaker A: Government's selling bitcoin. I'm gonna run, guys. See ya.
00:00:16.998 - 00:00:19.274, Speaker C: Okay. What happened?
00:00:20.534 - 00:00:22.354, Speaker D: The government selling bitcoin.
00:00:23.414 - 00:00:26.154, Speaker C: Oh, shit. No way.
00:00:46.154 - 00:01:10.044, Speaker E: Hey, everybody. Welcome to episode 27 of steady lads. I'm Jordy, the CIO of Salina capital. We have, as usual, with us, Taiki, a full time researcher and humble farmer. We have thikki with us as well, the sunburnt trader today. And we have Justin. Justin looks different.
00:01:10.044 - 00:01:13.724, Speaker E: That's not you, Justin. Hal, how are you doing, buddy?
00:01:14.184 - 00:01:15.564, Speaker A: I'm good. How you doing?
00:01:15.944 - 00:01:39.962, Speaker E: So Hal Press is one of the more exciting, like, vibrant characters on crypto Twitter. He's always got some, like, big feces and sometimes they play out, sometimes not. But it's always like very cool to follow him. It's definitely entertaining. So Justin, unfortunately is off today. He is launching astaria V two, I think is intense based money market.
00:01:40.018 - 00:01:41.210, Speaker C: So he'll tell us about that next.
00:01:41.242 - 00:01:46.914, Speaker E: Week and how that went. But we're excited to have Hal and talk a little bit about the different.
00:01:46.994 - 00:01:48.654, Speaker C: Narratives going on in the market.
00:01:49.814 - 00:01:55.994, Speaker E: Have you been sleeping much, Hal, or are you just sort of just grinding it out these days? It's a lot going on.
00:01:56.694 - 00:02:11.354, Speaker A: Yeah, no, the last, last few months really since October have been detrimental to the sleep, but we push through and hopefully at some point things will fire down.
00:02:12.574 - 00:02:18.094, Speaker E: Is it, is it just sort of like bull market? You go hard and then bear market, take it a little bit easier?
00:02:18.914 - 00:02:52.684, Speaker A: Typically, yeah, I mean, I think obviously things, there's a lot more activity, a lot more things to keep track of and really just, you get information much more rapidly in times like these. And so I think that the part for me that's kind of more stressful, that creates more of that time sink is you're always trying to synthesize new data points into whatever you're ongoing view of the situation doing is. And you get those new data points a lot more frequently in a bull. And so it just requires a lot more constant updating of those sort of mental frameworks.
00:02:52.804 - 00:03:15.140, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, I definitely feel a lot more anxiety during the bull market in terms of like, you know, you, you take 3 hours off to go hang out and you check your phone and it's just insane. Vicky, how are you managing? Are you, you seem like you spent a little bit too much time in the sun, but are you doing okay in this sort of bull market situation right now?
00:03:15.332 - 00:03:16.344, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:03:17.404 - 00:03:27.348, Speaker B: Got a little overzealous in the sun this weekend, but yeah, the book's been doing well. Big fan of your work, Hal. Nice to meet you. I've been following your Twitter for a.
00:03:27.356 - 00:03:30.524, Speaker C: Long time, doing well, so thank you.
00:03:30.564 - 00:03:55.408, Speaker E: Like you, you have infamously been calling the absolute top of the year in the first week. So far that has not been invalidated. You are not incorrect so far. How are you seeing things? Are you still expecting further and further down? It seems like most of the GBTC outflows are still getting sold without re entering the new ETF's.
00:03:55.536 - 00:04:15.868, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we've seen like three outflows in a row on the total ETF flows. I think volumes have started to trail off across the board, so we're still monitoring it to see where it'll settle, but definitely looks like potentially peak attention has already passed by. Curious if you have any views on this too, Hal.
00:04:16.036 - 00:05:15.408, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, largely the same view. I think kind of what's interesting is we had obviously a tremendous sort of buildup to the ETF, and I think probably it's hard to estimate with exact accuracy, but if I had to guess, on the order of tens of billions flows into bitcoin, came to sort of front run the ETF, and then to date, we actually have seen really no net inflows. It's mostly been sellers of GBTC offset by some entrants into the new ETF's. And it's very difficult to parse how much of all those flows is really just rotation. Like, if you're a long term holder of GBTC, it's quite logical to rotate to one of the other lower fee alternatives. If you know you're going to have to do that at some point anyway, you may as well just bite the bullet and stop paying the fee on GBTC now. And so it's very difficult to parse how much of the sort of inflows into these other ETF's are rotational versus incremental.
00:05:15.408 - 00:05:44.520, Speaker A: My initial sort of sense is that a lot of it indeed rotational. And there's not a lot of net flow changing hands, which in my opinion, sets things up a little bit cautiously, because you did have these tens of billions expecting this large inflow that they were front running. And if that inflow doesn't materialize, it's not clear who is going to keep buying to keep things at these levels which require more and more inflows to sustain.
00:05:44.672 - 00:06:28.538, Speaker E: Yeah, obviously, we've had quite a volatile month so far with touching 50, and now we're kind of below 40. This is generally what happens when you have price agnostic flows. So someone is just going to buy or someone's just going to sell and they don't really care what the price is. When that type of thing happens, you have people front running them and that sort of exacerbates the move because it's like a sandwich attack, you know, on chain. Like somebody will know that you're about to buy, they'll buy first. And same thing with these outflows. I mean, if you kind of expect that these GBTC sales will continue, might as well force them to sell it, you know, sub 40 instead of 45 where we were before, and then just run it back turbo as soon as it.
00:06:28.538 - 00:06:49.574, Speaker E: As soon as that ends. And I do expect that we will very quickly rebound as soon as it looks like things are done. But in the meantime, market's taking a breather. Taiki, are you taking a breather as well or are you kind of hoping that maker is gonna. Maker and Kanto are gonna save your bags?
00:06:50.534 - 00:07:24.106, Speaker F: I mean, maker is up only and Maker eat is about to hit parity, so I'm very happy about that. Yeah, I mean, in these types of choppy environment or in this type of choppy environment, I think these maker buybacks will have an effect, like a positive effect on the markets. I think narrative wise, maker just tends to outperform when bitcoin is going sideways. It's very anticyclical in that nature. So I think anything that's more in like the cash flow type of token or like that sector will outperform. If bitcoin did see like an interim.
00:07:24.130 - 00:07:32.042, Speaker E: Top, it's like a defensive stock. You know, market shit will rotate. That's crazy that we have that in crypto.
00:07:32.218 - 00:07:36.322, Speaker B: Yeah, this is the view that's a sign of mature market.
00:07:36.378 - 00:07:39.294, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the crypto equivalent of a us treasury.
00:07:40.594 - 00:07:42.746, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Taiki's right.
00:07:42.770 - 00:07:45.202, Speaker A: Like, when things are going bad, like.
00:07:45.378 - 00:08:02.574, Speaker B: Things with cash flows, things like my maker or these smaller casinos, maybe a rollbit, those things will generally outperform, I think, in growth cycles, things that don't necessarily generate a revenue but have good narratives like Solana or Tia, might tend to outperform in those cycles.
00:08:03.194 - 00:08:24.632, Speaker E: Yeah. When we have these quiet situations in the majors and both bitcoin and ETH, unfortunately, both of them are quite subdued at the moment. The only exciting stuff sometimes is new launches or expected launches. So that sort of keeps the casino going. We have had a few, and, you.
00:08:24.648 - 00:08:25.800, Speaker C: Know, they're not doing bad.
00:08:25.832 - 00:08:48.897, Speaker E: I mean, all of them in that 3 billion range. I don't know how many times a new coin will keep listing at 3 billion ftv. Now, obviously, not all of them have a huge float, but, you know, we did have manta. We had ault lair sort of just come out very. Just a while ago. I think another 3 billion.
00:08:49.065 - 00:08:50.825, Speaker B: Ondo. Can't forget Ondo.
00:08:50.969 - 00:08:54.573, Speaker E: Ondo. Another one that's sort of, like, in that. In that two to 3 billion range.
00:08:54.913 - 00:08:58.289, Speaker A: And Jup is coming in just about a week.
00:08:58.361 - 00:08:58.545, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:08:58.569 - 00:09:02.413, Speaker F: There's gonna be, like, a big airdrop every single week, I think, for the next couple of months.
00:09:02.793 - 00:09:03.513, Speaker D: Oh, hey, guys.
00:09:03.553 - 00:09:03.945, Speaker C: What's up?
00:09:03.969 - 00:09:04.621, Speaker D: I'm back.
00:09:04.737 - 00:09:08.422, Speaker C: Justin making his alley like return to the rink.
00:09:08.598 - 00:09:17.914, Speaker D: I'm sorry for being late, everybody. I'm excited that we have Hal here. It was actually a surprise to me. I just popped on and saw him here. So hopefully we'll get some good takes. Hopefully I didn't miss too much.
00:09:18.214 - 00:09:20.374, Speaker E: You know, whenever, like, thick he's gone, we.
00:09:20.494 - 00:09:35.316, Speaker C: Whenever thick he's away, we have, like, a, like, a sticky lookalike and a, you know, Jamo or something else. So when you were gone, Justin, we needed how to kind of step in. I don't know if Al's is quite as, like, you know, strong on the. On the pull ups and stuff as.
00:09:35.340 - 00:09:37.772, Speaker D: You are much more handsome, though.
00:09:37.868 - 00:10:05.014, Speaker C: Definitely. So just, Justin, before. Before we cut off and I suddenly changed my background, we were talking about how these, like, never ending $3 billion launches keep happening. Have we saved world poverty? Like, have we solved the debt of the US government? Have we solved global hunger? Like, did we just launch a new coin every day? Like, what's going on?
00:10:05.174 - 00:10:36.416, Speaker D: Well, so speaking specifically about the alt airdrop today, I think I got a few thousand dollars of it. I claimed it and will probably sell it soon. But, you know, I used to make this mistake a while for my, like, first year or two in crypto of trying to compare crypto market caps and, like, thinking about the same way as equity market caps. But that is, like, very much not the case. This market is extremely irrational. And just to put even more emphasis on that, anyone, even myself, could set the starting price for the alt airdrop. Right? Like, I could literally have been the first one to open up the pool.
00:10:36.416 - 00:11:02.664, Speaker D: I could have set what price to start the market at, and then I could have supplied liquidity and just sort of maintained that price. And, of course, this thing will eventually get arbitrage down, presumably, or up to the fair value. But, like, in the short term, we see these, like, completely, completely irrational moves when the circulating supply is so low and it's just so easily, it's so easy to control the narrative in price. So I don't think we've solved world poverty yet, but we might be getting there.
00:11:03.924 - 00:11:22.204, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, definitely part of it is exactly what you said. Like, the price discovery hasn't happened yet. So a lot of traders find a lot of edge betting against, like, you know, like, less professional traders in these launches. So they get a lot of volume, a lot of activity out. Do you look at these? You launch this very actively?
00:11:22.984 - 00:12:13.844, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I generally try to, because I agree with you, there tends to be some decent edge in them from time to time. I think the way that I approach it is you have to have sort of strict parameters before you get there about ranges and things that you want to participate, and you generally have to wait for extremes. Like, this is one of those situations where, if it's not a fat pitch, you shouldn't swing at it, because, like, there's a lot of them. And eventually you do get those fat pitches. It's not something where, like, you try to take marginal trades. And the other thing is, like, so, you know, if I look at five of these, generally I'll end up transacting on one of them. And then the other thing I'd say is just that you, I typically go very slowly and small because they're much more volatile than sort of already equilibrium.
00:12:13.844 - 00:12:17.024, Speaker A: And so I tend to just take it quite a lot slower.
00:12:18.044 - 00:12:50.634, Speaker C: What you're describing reminds me a lot of, uh, like, the world's huge of poker main event. There's so many fish that the professionals are like, I don't want to play every hand. I don't want to, like, get these big pots and, like, risk everything because there's gonna be some really nice, juicy spots, and I can kind of wait for them. Uh, instead of, you know, taking a 55 45 all in, like, you can find better spots in the. That. Vicky, are you also kind of, do you have, like, a calendar? You just kind of make sure that, you know when all the new launches are coming, because is that a big part of your trading?
00:12:51.574 - 00:13:07.456, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. I think we, like, notice that effect where, like, it definitely tends to suck the attention, liquidity out, like that sort of launch for that day. So there are some plays you can make on adjacent sort of tokens based on that. But, yeah, it's something that I track closely as well.
00:13:07.550 - 00:13:32.908, Speaker C: So here's one of the things I've noticed, like, when it's an airdrop related event, like there's a large airdrop, it seems like every single time it's the same chart. Like, you, you launch, you know, you start selling off. People are just dumping the airdrop. They don't care about what, whatever this thing that just ended up in their wallet is. You just want to dump it. Sometimes there's like a launch pool. So people have been, like, farming the token.
00:13:32.908 - 00:13:56.490, Speaker C: They don't care about it. But then there's always quite an okay rally. So even during this, like, pretty bad market, we've seen that Manta has had like a 30, 40% rally post airdrop rally. Is this like alpha? Any of you guys kind of notice this?
00:13:56.682 - 00:14:23.080, Speaker F: So I feel like one of the main use cases of crypto is speculation. And whenever there's a new token that launches, people just love to buy. And there's like this airdrop fractal that everyone talks about. I'm in a bunch of group chats with traders, and they're all just like, longing. All these new altcoin like airdrops. From my perspective, I'm more like the farmer, right? Where I have farm Manta, I farm dot layer, eigen layer. I have a Celestia staking operation.
00:14:23.080 - 00:14:51.694, Speaker F: So I'm just getting all these tokens. I sometimes wonder who's buying these things. It's kind of like what we talked about with Vicky, where with altcoins, there's this infinite supply, and at some point, how can there be enough dollars in the system to support all these high valuations? So I kind of wonder how long these things can last. But I guess if the flow is so low, then it's not that hard to control the narrative and the price in the short term. And that's kind of how I viewed it.
00:14:52.234 - 00:14:52.570, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:52.602 - 00:15:23.176, Speaker D: One thing I was going to say, and I'm sure you guys have all seen this tweet. I was looking to see if I could pull it up, so hopefully we can add it later. But, um, someone ran, you know, a few months ago. They did a little analysis on all historical airdrops that had, you know, any significant value to date, and they actually looked at the price performance over the first, I think, almost even six months, and they noticed that the price did dump and peak, generally about five to seven days or so after the airdrop. And that kind of fits in line with my own psychology. Like that I noticed with myself. So I got the alt airdrop.
00:15:23.176 - 00:15:36.844, Speaker D: I wanted to sell it immediately. I was like, oh, a few free ethnic, great. But I held back because, you know, having this knowledge, like, usually these things do, do peak a few days after the airdrop, even though your instinct is just to sell it right away. But hopefully we can get that data.
00:15:38.464 - 00:16:12.064, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, some people are like, looking at the chart and it starts to look like Celestia where, you know, you had the dump at $2 and then it just rips the 20 eventually. So there's always that chance. And I guess that that's people in, into, like buying the post airdrop down. But I mean, what you're saying tightly, like, it just makes sense. Like there's, there's a casino, there's money in it. Like, you know, you look at these exchanges, binance, et cetera, there's a fixed amount of, you know, x billion dollars that's in at some point. New token, new token, new token.
00:16:12.064 - 00:16:35.134, Speaker C: It has to rotate from somewhere, unless like, there's external money coming in just to buy that token. Like, I don't know if it's VC money. Like the VC's come in and they like liquid funds that deposit specifically, but otherwise it feels like it should be like a net zero situation. Maybe I'm looking at it wrong. Al, how do you think about this and what specifically?
00:16:35.174 - 00:16:39.966, Speaker A: Like, the total market cap of the whole universe of new coins?
00:16:40.110 - 00:17:08.954, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, there have to be like new inflows of some sort. Like either VC's are raising capital or like, you know, I'm in Dubai right now and I have been asking around. I'm like, are the Qataris and the Saudis buying a billion dollars of bitcoin or not? Like, what's that? What's going on? I've been told that there is some buying going on. I don't know. I don't know. True, but I haven't told that there is something. So some amount of buying, but yeah, like, just inflows work.
00:17:08.954 - 00:17:10.094, Speaker C: Like, do we need them?
00:17:10.974 - 00:17:57.790, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we definitely do. And I think, yeah, all the new token launching and airdrop stuff, I think the intuitive belief is that it's bullish because it's this wealth effect where people feel rich because they're getting this free money and they start this activity picks up. But counterintuitively, there is an offset to that which you kind of mentioned, which I've certainly noticed in the past, which is for every one of these new launches, there's certainly a number of farmers that just are farming the airdrops for fiat. And then when they launch, you know, they convert that to fiat and there needs to be some capital allocated to buy them out. And generally it comes from other altcoins. Like, I think we, I think about these universes in, like, pretty separate terms. And I think about the altcoin universe is really like its own sort of separate ecosystem.
00:17:57.790 - 00:18:39.898, Speaker A: And so typically what you find is actually around these launches, it's actually quite bad for the pre existing alts because a lot of money has to come from them, sort of buy out these farmers of the new tokens. And so I think this is a common phenomenon you see across other cycles, which is as all of these coins have held back from launching in the bear because they didn't want to have worse valuations. They all rushed to come launch in the bull. And eventually that just dilutes all the flows and creates too much sort of steady state emission that eventually kind of creates the end of the bull. And so, yeah, I think, I think it's not as clear as just saying, like, all these airdrops are bullish because it creates this wealth effect and everyone makes money. I mean, to your point, the money has to come from somewhere.
00:18:39.986 - 00:19:09.396, Speaker D: Yeah. And on the note we were talking about, I did want to just highlight this graph that I think plays also into what you were saying, Hal. This is what I had been referencing earlier. I just pulled it up here, and you can see it looks like about, on the fourth day you have like an initial peak of price on average. And then also about two weeks later, you have an initial peak or a secondary peak as well. But it does look like, you know, to your point, how all of these things basically just tend, trend down over time. And I think this was a sample of, you know, dozens and dozens of airdrops.
00:19:09.396 - 00:19:12.492, Speaker D: So it's pretty interesting to look at it when you see it, you know, this plainly.
00:19:12.588 - 00:19:29.724, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, what was this saying? Like, new coin good. I'm sure thiki has seen this, this thing about new coin good. And maybe it's like a, it's like a premium. It's like a attention premium because you get the launch and yet this, like, casino attention premium effect.
00:19:30.464 - 00:20:23.144, Speaker A: The one, the one thing that I would say that I think is really like that I think is a big part of this is typically what happens is these coins have extremely low cirque at the initial launch. And what it means is, like, once the people that want to sell have sold and the market maker deals have been filled and whatever else has been filled, and sometimes it's you know, there's a market maker deal is benign and it takes a day and sometimes it's not and it takes a week or a month. But once you get through that initial period and it actually turns over to all the people that kind of know the game and are waiting and they're not going to sell and they're just accumulating, there's very, very, very little actual supply available on the market. And that's why I think they tend to have those runs. And that actual lack of supply eventually creates the top. Right. Because you get to a price that's dislocated to the upside too, because of that dynamic.
00:20:23.144 - 00:20:34.304, Speaker A: And then typically from that price, it's down only. And I think that's why that chart looks like that is because you really like, the same reason that new coin is good is why you overshoot to the upside and you have both.
00:20:34.424 - 00:20:34.680, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:34.712 - 00:20:55.536, Speaker D: To your point, Jordy, about new coin good. I think it's really interesting. I'm also looking at, I'm going to link this article in the description below so people can read it. But in this article you saw the best time to sell. There's also indicated the best time to buy. And it looks like it's about 170 days after launch. So it's like new coin good that fades down.
00:20:55.536 - 00:21:06.080, Speaker D: That hype is all sort of gone. And then like, you know, let's say about six months after launch, no one remembers this project. It's forgotten about. And that's generally when these things bottom. It looks like on average, and not.
00:21:06.112 - 00:21:33.404, Speaker C: Only like new coin good, but there's even people speculating on launches that haven't even happened. Even if they're just getting points right. There's points market starting to peel. So we have like whales market and friend tech who even like talk to remembers friendtech. I know you guys were into it at the beginning, but apparently there's friendtech points trading. I don't know. Is it like a dollar a point? It seems like it's around a dollar a point.
00:21:33.404 - 00:21:39.798, Speaker C: You guys have a lot of points. Are you like pre rich, pre girlfriend? Like what's going on? Who's got the points?
00:21:39.966 - 00:21:56.054, Speaker B: I heard rumors that, I heard rumors that people were selling their points at OTC for a dollar each. And now that market stressed down, I do think frontex an example of like another defensive sort of mini casino that does well in the bear and does really bad in the bull.
00:21:56.214 - 00:22:12.080, Speaker F: Yeah, it's kind of like nfts, right? I think NFTs do really poorly when ETH is going up only and then NFTs start to run when ETH is flat to down just because you, you know, people want to hold eat on the upside and then if ETH isn't moving, then they want to stack more ETH and they speculate on these jpegs.
00:22:12.272 - 00:22:29.084, Speaker D: Hal, I'm curious, like when you're, you know, you're hearing us talk about the most fringe, like long tail tokens and you run and operate a fund, as far as I understand it. Do you have a mandate not to, you know, ape into shitcoins? Like what are you allowed to do here? Can you just buy whatever you want?
00:22:30.674 - 00:23:04.708, Speaker A: Yeah, we have a pretty loose mandate. I can pretty much do whatever I think is within the best interests of the fund. There's no limits on sort of the tokens that we can trade. So we do, we do trade in a lot of lower cap stuff from time to time when we think that there's alpha in it. Certainly liquidity constraints are a concern and like if you have more slippage, then you must have greater edge for the EV to exist. So we definitely factor that in. But yeah, we trade the full spectrum of tokens.
00:23:04.836 - 00:23:10.196, Speaker D: And are you benchmarked to dollars, Hal, or bitcoin or ethereum dollars?
00:23:10.380 - 00:23:16.304, Speaker C: I mean, how far, how far the spectrum do your lp's allow you to go? Like, are you allowed to take some math as well?
00:23:18.284 - 00:23:20.220, Speaker A: You already know the answer to that, Jordy.
00:23:20.292 - 00:23:30.214, Speaker C: I do know the answer. How does ping me? So if we can get the method staking update here, we can bring, bring the link up.
00:23:30.254 - 00:23:38.994, Speaker A: Yeah, NRD is a NRD, the large holder, a large holder of meth, partially thanks to Jordan, who has meth pill with us.
00:23:40.414 - 00:24:27.514, Speaker C: So everybody watching, hopefully you have got some math because we have reached the cap and it's not going to be like last time where we're just going to raise the cap the next time. So at least for some substantial period now we are at the 333,333 e fully reach the cap very quickly. Pretty cool. It should be, you know, 800 or so million dollars. I think it's going to reach a billion if we, if we get a bit of a bull market. So this is something that shows that there's still interest in ETH, but the ETH performance has not been amazing. Hal, are you, are you worried? Like how are you seeing ETH right now? I saw you tweeting about it.
00:24:28.014 - 00:25:06.626, Speaker A: I like ETH on a relative basis for sure. I think that for a long time ETH was sort of shunned as like the worst major. And all the attention and focus was on bitcoin into the ETF. And then we saw that really let up after the ETF for a bit, and you had a large, pretty sharp rally. Any BTC following? As kind of people kind of tried to move to the next shiny thing. But then ETH BTC largely retraced again. And I think there was some residual selling from a few sort of liquidator type accounts and that contributed.
00:25:06.626 - 00:25:57.664, Speaker A: And then I think also we've just seen activity wane, and that usually is a negative for ETHC. But I think as these liquidations end and the ETF attention fades, ETH really does have the best tokenomics in the space of any kind of large token. It's really the only one that it has no supply of any sort. And the value proposition is also quite strong. I think in these run ups you see a lot of attention around Alt l ones and their greater sort of performance metrics, but at the end of the day, they're all fighting for the same sort of pie. And I've articulated, and I've kind of said this before, you know, it's a little bit like Apple competes for the high end of smartphone market, and then a lot of these other smaller phone companies compete for the low end, but Apple ends up with all the market share. And I think that's a little bit true with block space as well.
00:25:57.664 - 00:26:57.368, Speaker A: And especially as we enter a potential Eigen layer launch in the next, probably some point in the second quarter, I think there can be more attention given to the value of ETH decentralization, where Eigen layer sort of allows ETH to monetize that decentralization for the first time. And so I do think things set up pretty favorably for ETH on a relative basis. And I also think bitcoin dominance was a bit overdone, given that the ETF really hasn't attracted it nearly as much incremental flows as people expected. And the fact that bitcoins run up so much, it does create a tremendous amount of structural supply. Like the miner supply becomes much more significant. And miners really had been stockpiling their supply and issuing equities in the run up, which I think is set to reverse soon, especially as we approach the halving. And then on the flip side of that, you had Saylor, who was buying $20 million of spot bitcoin every business day for several months.
00:26:57.368 - 00:26:58.964, Speaker A: And that's all government.
00:26:58.964 - 00:27:00.304, Speaker B: Government selling bitcoin.
00:27:03.364 - 00:27:04.716, Speaker A: I gotta run, guys.
00:27:04.860 - 00:27:07.904, Speaker C: See ya. Okay, what happened?
00:27:09.164 - 00:27:10.984, Speaker D: The government selling bitcoin.
00:27:12.044 - 00:27:38.086, Speaker C: Oh, shit. No, way. Okay. So, as we were recording, there seem to have been a headline about the government selling, like, $100 million of bitcoin are announcing it. So our active trader friends had to jump off. We then get to interrogate them a little bit more as to what they think of the markets. But we can continue an episode for you guys.
00:27:38.086 - 00:28:00.854, Speaker C: This has been the most cursed episode number 27 has been the most challenging one. I've had multiple disconnections. We've had people run off in the middle. Hank, he's had issues, but we are dedicated to issuing an episode for our hardcore fans every single week. So we're gonna. We're gonna do this. We're gonna see this through to the end, definitely.
00:28:00.854 - 00:28:13.734, Speaker C: Let's have some fun. I mean, Justin, you were showing me before you had some, like, bitcoin notes. Like, are those, like, actual bitcoin behind them, or, like, what are those? Exactly.
00:28:14.314 - 00:28:43.616, Speaker D: They are, yeah. So these are paper bitcoin. Actually, find me in Denver. I'll probably have a bunch of these that I just want to hand out to people. I was thinking of giving them to friends and family because it's fun seeing a physical manifestation of bitcoin. The way it essentially works is there is an NFC chip right there, and to actually withdraw the bitcoin, you have to cut it in half, permanently releasing the private key. I'm still learning how it works and whatnot, but it's super interesting.
00:28:43.616 - 00:29:00.954, Speaker D: These are fun little things you can just give to friends. You can give as a tip, as a gag gift, or for people that aren't necessarily into crypto, and they can just throw it in their wallet, throw it in a drawer, and forget about it. And for me, I just think these things are super fun, and it, like, shows you that crypto can actually have, like, something going on in the real world. Right.
00:29:02.134 - 00:29:05.350, Speaker C: I mean, I think that's a really good idea. Sorry.
00:29:05.382 - 00:29:05.670, Speaker A: False.
00:29:05.702 - 00:29:11.630, Speaker C: Oh, false alarm. Oh, what happened?
00:29:11.662 - 00:29:18.904, Speaker A: How he's trying to fud everyone into thinking the government selling all their coins, but there's just separate, unrelated case.
00:29:19.024 - 00:29:24.760, Speaker C: So that 130 million, it's like dust, right? Like, it's not.
00:29:24.832 - 00:29:43.496, Speaker A: Well, I wouldn't say it's dust, but it's not the. It's not that the 100,000 stash that they. That they. That they have now. Is there. Is there some connection that if they're gonna sell this, that maybe they start selling that? I don't know. I haven't.
00:29:43.496 - 00:29:51.624, Speaker A: I have not enough time to think about it all, to be honest. But they didn't move the coins that. That everyone's monitoring.
00:29:52.444 - 00:29:57.864, Speaker C: And how about the Celsius Ethereum? Is that. Is that ended? Are they still holding a bunch of ETH that they're dumping?
00:29:58.604 - 00:30:34.120, Speaker A: My understanding, and I don't have specifics on it, but my understanding is they're pretty much done with the actual, like. Okay, so they had a lot of ETH, and they had to sell some of it for, um, covering expenses related to the. To the legal expenses that they'd accrued, and then they had a bunch else that they needed to distribute in kind. My understanding is that they've finished selling that which they had to sell for the expense portion, but they still have to make their in kind distribution.
00:30:34.312 - 00:30:35.944, Speaker C: Got it? Got it. Okay.
00:30:35.984 - 00:30:59.024, Speaker A: But their in kind distribution will be both bitcoin and ETH. It's about $3 billion in aggregate, 50 part, like 50% bitcoin, 50% ETH that will be distributed in kind to Celsius creditors at some point, likely in the next month. So that is going to be some sort of spot supply of majors in the market. I mean, obviously not all those people will sell, but some portion of them.
00:30:59.184 - 00:31:29.328, Speaker D: Hal, help me understand what's going on here. Like, a month ago, we were all singing kryptos praises. Maybe even three weeks ago, we were all bullish. We saw the ETF's coming, where, like, these inflows are coming, and then, of course, like, price has gone down a bit, nothing crazy. And now it seems like the whole mood has shifted. It's like, we've got the Celsius unlocks, we have the mount docs unlocks, the ETF's are useless. The ETH ETF is going to get approved, but it's only going to lead to more outflows from the GBT or the ETH e grayscale fund.
00:31:29.328 - 00:31:35.124, Speaker D: Like, is this all just price driving the narrative, or what are your thoughts there? Or is things changed?
00:31:35.614 - 00:32:30.152, Speaker A: So I wrote an annual letter at the end of the year when prices were all still at the highs, and I said I could find the quote in the letter, but I said time and time again, we've seen in crypto that pretty much every event is sell the news. And for every event, people always try to come up with reasons why this one will be different, but it seldom is. And I think it's easy for me to. To say that now, but when we were at, everyone was bullish, it wasn't so easy to have that view. But I think that's really the reality. If I take a step back, my bias coming into it. And what continues to be my bias is we front ran crypto was pretty much left for dead in September and August, and then Travis started front running the CTF.
00:32:30.152 - 00:33:26.588, Speaker A: And in my opinion, this is only my view now, but in my opinion, everyone tried to convince themselves that, like, we're back and everything's great again, and, you know, everyone should go buy altcoins and everything goes up 400%, when in reality it was mostly just an ETF front run. Like, we didn't actually create any new tech between now and four months ago. Like, we didn't actually accrue any new users between now and four months ago. In my opinion, all we had was a bunch of trad five flows front running this ETF, which hasn't actually proven to yield any results. So in terms of net inflows into the space following it, it's basically been paired off. So in my opinion, we kind of just took it too far and we created all these future emissions that I don't really know who's going to fill. The consequence of running altcoins up 300% as a group is that all the structural outflows from them is quite large.
00:33:26.588 - 00:34:15.296, Speaker A: And so I think we've reached a point where like, attention has peaked. And it's not obvious to me who's going to keep filling the demand of all these ongoing structural emissions. Like, I think a friend of mine did an analysis where the new coins this cycle are 30 billion market cap, but like 180 billion fdv, and they're going to unlock something like another 40 billion at current prices over the next year. Like, that's greater than the entire aum of all crypto funds in the world. So just to me, like, I don't really have a strong view on majors, but I think that like, the high emission altcoins, it's unclear the path, but in six to twelve months, they'll largely be lower. And that's, that's kind of just my baseline view.
00:34:15.440 - 00:34:31.682, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with you broadly. I know we called it out on this show. I think we all went around and said like, every single event we have ever witnessed in crypto has always been sell the news. But I can only speak about me personally. I didn't sell the news. Right. I just ended up holding and it was hard for me to act on it.
00:34:31.682 - 00:34:56.796, Speaker D: But I agree broadly with everything you're saying. But the one caveat I'd want to ask you about is like, it seems like the worst thing you can do in crypto's history is fade cycle theory. I personally don't believe it because I don't think I have the having has any impact right now going from two to 1%. And I don't believe that markets operate in this like, four year program cycle. It just doesn't intuitively make sense. But, like, fading, that is the worst thing you could have done over the past decade. Right.
00:34:56.796 - 00:34:59.264, Speaker D: So, like, what are your thoughts on cycle theory?
00:34:59.684 - 00:35:32.944, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really good question. And the reality is I haven't traded any cycles, frankly. Like, I'm relatively new to this market, so I probably don't have a very, very well informed view. So, like, I would defer to others and I would avoid kind of making a high conviction view on that. Like, for me, the easier bet is to play sort of like pair trades with a lot of these kind of like, overvalued, low flow coins versus others that I have a stronger view, can sustain better.
00:35:34.324 - 00:36:05.674, Speaker C: It's a sign of a good gambler. You know what your game is, you know which one's not your game and you kind of stick to where you have the edge. I mean, we talked a little bit about the new launches. One of the large ones that's about to come out, that's been hyped for a long time is Jupiter on Solana. So Evo, I think, is showing it around five to 6 billion right now. I think at some point it was showing even higher. But this is supposed to be a very large event in the Solana space.
00:36:05.674 - 00:36:16.824, Speaker C: Have you been tracking this one? Do we expect a similar sort of chart pattern? Is the one we saw before? Or what do we think about this specific project?
00:36:17.604 - 00:36:49.082, Speaker A: It depends where it launches. So I think, I think on a lot of these, like, you know, these like sort of pre toad skin markets that, that have a market on them, it's showing at about 5 billion FTV. I'm a seller at that valuation. Like, I think if it launches at that price, I think it might even be six, actually. I think it's six. I think if it comes at that price, to me, it's probably not going to sustain. I actually don't think that this is a better protocol than either Jup or pith.
00:36:49.082 - 00:37:34.316, Speaker A: So for it to launch above those two and then obviously like one inch on the east side does the exact same volumes as Jupiter, and I think it's like a 600 million FTV. So personally, if it launches at that level, like, I'm going to be looking to do sort of a pear trade between one inch and Jupe and kind of hold that for a longer timeframe, like you could have done when Jito was four and Lido was two, something that fair trade made a lot of sense as well. I think there's going to be something similar with Jupiter. Now. If it comes at a lower valuation, like if it comes at two or three, then I think probably we'll follow that similar airdrop fractal where it digests sort of the selling of the airdrop at that two to three range and then eventually does rally and then probably leads out from there. So I think it all depends on where it launches.
00:37:34.460 - 00:37:34.788, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:34.836 - 00:38:13.160, Speaker F: Also, like, one thing I realized is that all these airdrops, it's typically more bullish the ecosystem tokens, like the other tokens when Jito launched Solana, two x right after and bonk. Also, I think four x'ed right after the launch. So. And if you go on Twitter, there's like no real discussion of people that's wanting to buy the Jupiter Airdrop. Everyone's talking about, like, when you sell your Jupyter, like, what are you going to buy next? So I feel like that's kind of the sentiment around CT. And even today whiff is up 10% or something because people think that people will sell Jupiter to buy whiff as the speculative meme coin. So I think that's kind of how the Solana ecosystem is.
00:38:13.160 - 00:38:19.408, Speaker F: It's a place for people to farm airdrops and take those airdrops to speculate on other stuff rather than to actually hold onto these things.
00:38:19.576 - 00:38:38.864, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it'll be quite interesting to see if even in this semi bear market, I mean, Solana has kind of followed the rest of the market and is back in the eighties right now. Jupiter being such a blue chip, does that break the trend?
00:38:39.364 - 00:38:56.328, Speaker D: Help. Can I ask you a question on pair trading? Because it's interesting. I'm not a trader, but I did put on a pair trade somewhat recently, actually. I don't have this on anymore. I longed mantle and shorted Ethan. I ended up reversing that and just logging mental against USD.
00:38:56.496 - 00:39:01.248, Speaker A: But I'm curious, really, Jordy's really having an impact here.
00:39:01.416 - 00:39:04.816, Speaker D: Well, you got to bet on your friends. That's all I'll say. No matter what.
00:39:04.920 - 00:39:08.552, Speaker A: I think it was. I think it was a good bet. I think it was Jordy. Jordy tends to deliver.
00:39:08.728 - 00:39:24.064, Speaker D: He always delivers. But what I was going to ask is, like, for a non trader, is it, is it actually safer to put on a pear trade, even though it's a little counterintuitive, like longing an ecosystem token shorting ETH? Or would you just recommend people stick to the basics?
00:39:25.404 - 00:39:46.580, Speaker A: Look, it's a good question. I think. I think there's a lot of nuance to it. It's certainly a different, a different type of thing. It can be a lower variance thing than just outright positions. It also can be higher. It depends what you're pairing.
00:39:46.580 - 00:40:35.410, Speaker A: I think one interesting pear trade that I've done recently is I've put on an optimism arbitrum pair trade where we're short arbitrum long optimism, basically, because arbitrum has a $2 billion cliff in a bit under two months. And I think that there's going to be some impact of that. And arbitrum trades at quite a large premium dogma right now. I think for something like that, those two tokens are extremely correlated with each other, and that actually does reduce your variance versus either outright longing optimism, or outright shorting. Arbitrary. But if it's something, like you said, where it's mantle ETH, I'm not sure it does reduce your risk all that much because mantle is an alt and ETH is a major and they typically have a different profile. So I think you can sort of sort out some of the market noise with that.
00:40:35.410 - 00:41:13.964, Speaker A: But I think if you really want to reduce the variance, you need to find something that has a lot of other sort of factor exposure. So for me, I do think there is a place for pair trading. We do do it quite frequently, and we have done it profitably in the past, but it requires a lot of nuance. And typically, I think the best way these pear trades, you typically need to hold them over a very long period of time and place them, structural thing. And so typically what I've found is sizing them smaller and kind of putting them somewhere where you don't think about them, you don't look at it day to day, and you just come back at a predefined period in the future, like six or twelve months. Like you set a date. A lot of times you have events around these things.
00:41:13.964 - 00:41:31.018, Speaker A: So like for optimism, arbitram I'm just, you know, I'll come back after the cliff, and then you just don't look at them and you come back and you're just disciplined about it and you take it off at that time period. And if it's down, it's down. If it's up, it's up and you just move on. But I think if you do them like that, you can have some success with that.
00:41:31.036 - 00:41:40.754, Speaker C: Them. Do you do any like, correlations or any, like, you know, number crunching to see which coins are historically correlated, or you just.
00:41:42.054 - 00:42:08.724, Speaker A: For me, it's more of a field thing. For me, it's more of a feel thing. And it's just like, you know, I stare at the screen every day watching everything trade. So you end up, like, with an intuitive sense of it, but you certainly could get more quantitative with it. I mean, typically, the way I run the fund these days is pretty much like an equity long short fund. Like, we typically have both longs and shorts. And what we really like sort of seek to offer investors is sort of an uncorrelated market return.
00:42:08.724 - 00:42:39.004, Speaker A: Not to just, like, shill our fund, but we. I'm pretty sure I can talk about this in this forum, but I think we were up a bit over 115% last year, and we didn't have a single month with more than a 1% drawdown. So that's kind of what we're trying to shoot for, is, like, consistent returns without basically any drawdowns. And so that pair trading and sort of long short style does. Does have a place nice.
00:42:39.044 - 00:42:46.044, Speaker C: And hopefully, like, this year will be quite as good. And you'll keep running it up, turbo. Yeah.
00:42:46.084 - 00:42:51.864, Speaker A: Prior. Prior results are no indication of future results, so we'll just try to do our best, and we'll see where the chips fall.
00:42:53.044 - 00:43:12.746, Speaker C: Definitely an NFA. Cool. Let's move to our final segment. So we have our pasta of the week segment, and I've seen some of the pastas are quite strong. I think. Justin, I might have stolen your pasta. I didn't think you were going to be here.
00:43:12.850 - 00:43:17.374, Speaker D: I can't allow that. I pre reserved two pastas this week. I'm not letting it happen.
00:43:18.114 - 00:43:22.614, Speaker C: I took one. I don't know if Peggy took the other one, but we might have taken your pasta.
00:43:24.434 - 00:43:42.374, Speaker D: I'm about to present my two pastas, so you guys are gonna have to improvise on the fly. I need this win from Hal. So, Hal, for context, we do a pasta of the week where we share, like, our favorite tweet. And I notoriously lose every single week, except for the lads gave me a win on my birthday just to be nice.
00:43:43.914 - 00:43:44.418, Speaker B: That was.
00:43:44.466 - 00:43:45.826, Speaker A: That was sweet of them.
00:43:46.010 - 00:43:52.472, Speaker C: All right, well, Justin, you have to pick one at least. So out of the two, choose one, and let's go with one.
00:43:52.528 - 00:43:53.844, Speaker D: I can only pick one?
00:43:54.224 - 00:43:56.084, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm going to choose the other one.
00:43:56.664 - 00:44:37.988, Speaker D: All right, if that. If I'm only picking one, I'm going with Ansem because I said something inappropriate about Solana last week. And so I'm looking for a little redemption. So Hayden tweeted out, basically, why do so many people hate crypto? And the tweet was basically like, they hate crypto because all we do is talk about the price and, like, rub it in people's faces when the price goes up and then get embarrassed and go back into a hole when the prices go down. And then Ansem, quote, tweeted and said, wait, your product's entire use cases to allow anybody to speculate on the price of coins, question mark. And it was just absolutely hilarious seeing, seeing this reply to Hayden, because it's just so true. Hayden was the one that enabled this flurry of new tokens.
00:44:37.988 - 00:44:46.064, Speaker D: Anyone can launch a coin. Anyone can launch a pool. Anyone can speculate permissionlessly. And he didn't, you know, catch that. So I thought this was great. Ansem's hilarious.
00:44:46.144 - 00:44:50.964, Speaker A: And my job is to. Is to say which one of these is the funniest.
00:44:51.544 - 00:45:28.934, Speaker C: Funniest and most enjoyable. Yeah. So, I mean, and this is, this is beautiful, right? Ansem is the king of retail, the king of the djen, the king of the left curve. Just going against this, like, you know, guy up in the clouds. We don't see him. He just, he, you know, he's a very successful founder OG, but a little disconnected from the people, you know, the bourgeoisie. And I think an some, he made this point that we've made on the podcast before when we talked to Jeff from say that, you know, that conversation with him was around.
00:45:28.934 - 00:45:57.738, Speaker C: Like, is all of crypto just speculation? Is that what it is? He's just betting on coins? And, you know, I think Hayden could potentially say that, you know, uniswap is. Is a spot. It's not a perp deck. So it's more, you know, people are acquiring maybe longer term investments rather than speculating. But it was a very good pasta. And actually, that was the one I was hoping to use. So I will scramble to find.
00:45:57.786 - 00:45:59.890, Speaker A: Jordy's out. Jordy's out. Jordy's out.
00:45:59.922 - 00:46:14.552, Speaker C: No, no, no. I'm going to steal. I'm going to steal figgies. So Figgy is gone, and he actually gave me. He gave the pasta that he was going to use. So I will use sticky spots while takey. You go.
00:46:14.552 - 00:46:15.992, Speaker C: I'll get Picky's pasta.
00:46:16.168 - 00:46:51.154, Speaker F: All right, so this is my pasta. So this is conditioning like Pavlov's dog experiment. But think about it with air drops and points. So before conditioning, right, we have the unconditioned stimulus, which is like dogs salivate or crypto degens salivate when they receive an airdrop. But if you give dgens a point system and then an airdrop, then they're going to start salivating, and they're going to associate the same, like, those two things together. So now we have djens just, you know, Degenc, like a point system. Uh, and then they just, like, start a bing into a bunch of things.
00:46:51.154 - 00:47:13.024, Speaker F: And then we see this situation where the farmers are being farmed, uh, where, you know, for example, hyper liquid, literally, the market's been up only for the past six months, but traders on hyper liquid, they're down like $5 million. So it's like this, I guess, psychological experiment of DJN's just getting destroyed with these point systems and the farmers being farmed.
00:47:14.084 - 00:47:28.010, Speaker C: I've been following your tweets, taking. It feels like you're getting very emotional about Celestia. You're like, oh, my God, I'm stuck. I need to sell, and it's dumping, and, oh, no, there's an airdrop. Let me back in. Like, I wanna, I wanna restate playlist. Let me back in the house.
00:47:28.010 - 00:47:35.322, Speaker C: Are you, are you putting on an act or are you actually getting, like, that, like, emotionally involved in the Airdrop game? Oh, no.
00:47:35.338 - 00:47:55.822, Speaker F: I mean, it's all a meme, right? Like, I mean, I staked Celestia and, like, all my airdrops, like, it's already covered for, like, my initial capital, like, whatever I put in. So now it's just, like, all memeing and just, like, joking about, you know, like this, like, oh, my God, price down. It's over versus price up. Oh, everything. It's like, we're back, right? It's like the virtual cycle.
00:47:55.918 - 00:48:27.974, Speaker A: Last year, Celestia was a great celestial, was a great call, by the way. In hindsight, it was quite like, I think it was. It was definitely, like, an achievable catch that we didn't participate in at all. So I think it was a miss for us. But it was great, great call by you and anyone else that participated. Like, I think I like this story of just being able to stake this token and get a share of all, or like, many future potential l one s for the whole cycle is just so sellable. Like, it really, it really was an achievable sort of, like, catch.
00:48:27.974 - 00:48:30.194, Speaker A: So congrats to those that caught it.
00:48:30.274 - 00:48:37.306, Speaker D: You don't have to boost his ego too much. Every week I'm getting a DM from Tyke saying that I missed, missed Tia. So I'm feeling it.
00:48:37.330 - 00:48:40.866, Speaker A: But you gotta. You gotta. You gotta. You gotta give credit.
00:48:40.890 - 00:48:41.002, Speaker C: Where.
00:48:41.018 - 00:48:41.646, Speaker A: Credit?
00:48:41.810 - 00:48:46.438, Speaker D: Hell, yeah. So we have thickie back. Jordy, you have to get scrambling. You're.
00:48:46.486 - 00:48:52.750, Speaker C: I was just about to. I was about to steal your pasta, thickie, but. But now you're back, so, uh. All right, Jordy's out.
00:48:52.862 - 00:48:53.486, Speaker A: Jordy wins.
00:48:53.510 - 00:48:53.790, Speaker D: Enough.
00:48:53.862 - 00:48:55.314, Speaker A: He doesn't need to win this one.
00:48:56.494 - 00:48:59.006, Speaker C: Vicki, let us. Let us see your pasta.
00:48:59.150 - 00:48:59.510, Speaker B: All right.
00:48:59.542 - 00:49:00.118, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah.
00:49:00.206 - 00:49:16.250, Speaker B: This one's from my friend Awad. Um, I thought it was pretty hilarious. The cartel continues to find creative ways to send us signals. One of the days. Capitulate. You know, when some of the price action we've been seeing for the past week or two. The ACF launch.
00:49:16.402 - 00:49:19.314, Speaker A: I'm gonna have to go with Justin. I like handsome.
00:49:19.434 - 00:49:24.794, Speaker C: No, no, let me. Let me, like. Let me, like. Let me get an entry in, at least. I want to get an entry in.
00:49:24.954 - 00:49:28.250, Speaker A: But, uh, you can put your entry in, but I've already ruled.
00:49:28.362 - 00:49:28.874, Speaker D: Hell, yeah.
00:49:28.914 - 00:49:29.130, Speaker C: Thanks.
00:49:29.162 - 00:49:37.674, Speaker D: Hell, I really like you, man. We got to have you on more often. What do you. What are you doing next week? Yeah, actually, we'll talk offline.
00:49:38.414 - 00:50:00.852, Speaker C: So just in second. Pasta. It's got the Uniswap airdrop, the OG airdrop. And people were actually getting excited about these things. And it says, my father in law is a token builder. We were looking at the Uniswap airdrop last night, and I asked him what it would cost to do this today instead of points. I will never forget its answer.
00:50:00.852 - 00:50:15.016, Speaker C: We can't. We don't know how to do it. We are so deep in points and points on points that, you know, these. Just giving people tokens instead is the long forgotten art.
00:50:15.160 - 00:50:15.904, Speaker A: Fair enough.
00:50:16.024 - 00:50:33.634, Speaker C: Cool. Thank you for all. Thank you for joining us, Hal. It's been a remarkably eventful episode. All kinds of bombs have been falling during it. I'm sure Justin is happy that you're joining as well. So thanks to our audience as well, for bearing with us, and see you guys next week.
00:50:33.974 - 00:50:34.494, Speaker D: Bye, Brun.
