00:00:00.400 - 00:00:06.622, Speaker A: You're starting to sound like Michael Saylor. Justin, did you guys see that on Yahoo. News? He said, if you don't own bitcoin, we call you poor.
00:00:06.798 - 00:00:23.354, Speaker B: I was like, dude, no, no. He said, there's a name for people that denominate their net worth and fiat. We call them poor and they made, like, a house remix. We should try to find and play it. We call them we pour poor, poor. We call them we pour poor, poor.
00:00:44.054 - 00:01:00.714, Speaker C: Episode 34 of steady lads. Welcome, everybody. We are clearly in quite an exciting bull market. I think it's undeniable at this point. So we're gonna do a cool episode for you guys today. But as usual, some quick intros. I'm Jordi, the founder of Celini Capital.
00:01:00.714 - 00:01:32.334, Speaker C: We have with us Justin, the CEO, co founder of Astaria. We have Taiki, humble farmer, full time researcher. And we have thiki here, the real thickie in person, not sunburnt. Thiki, how's it looking out there? We want to bring up the markets a little bit. I know we're recording a day before release, but I think the markets are so exciting that we should look at what's going on out there. Thiky, are you expecting this dip to keep dipping?
00:01:33.194 - 00:01:37.214, Speaker B: I think it should go a little bit deeper, but then I expect it to bounce back.
00:01:37.754 - 00:01:47.482, Speaker C: The ETF flows have remained strong. Right. So ultimately, that's the backbone of this current rally. If that continues and it's hard to dip too much, is that the right way to read this?
00:01:47.538 - 00:02:02.128, Speaker B: That's what I agree with you. That's what I think. We're getting, like 500 to a billion inflows in our day. Plus Saylor still has a few billion of ammo left. That is life supply of bitcoin from the MSTR premium. So there still is a lot of inflows that need to come, I think.
00:02:02.256 - 00:02:10.680, Speaker D: And do you think the ETF inflows are just extremely reflexive? If price goes down, do you think inflows go down as well? Is it just going to work hand in hand like that?
00:02:10.832 - 00:02:28.490, Speaker B: I think so, but I think it needs to convincingly break those trend lines that people look at for that to happen. I think it'll be hard to do that given how quickly we've risen up. There's a bunch of people sidelined, waiting to get in, so I just find it hard to have it break the trend.
00:02:28.642 - 00:03:25.614, Speaker C: Apart from the general beta, which I think we all agree that it's quite positive because of the inflows, we should be not in late stages of the innings yet. We do have some differences between the coins performances we can see off the top. Solana had a nice little jump after being very sidelined because of the private sales that were going on of the estate lock tokens from galaxy. We had BNB just explode at certain points, so they're also doing a launch pool next week with Etherfi so you can farm a bunch of tokens. I think it's like 2% of the supply going to BNB holders there. On the other hand, ETH a little bit underperforming despite the very successful upgrades. Have you guys tried to use an l two taiki? Have you checked out the zero cent l two fees?
00:03:26.034 - 00:04:26.878, Speaker A: Yeah, I think yesterday when Dengkun shipped on the 13th, fees were sub one penny. But if you check right now as there's more demand, I think to swap on base it costs like $0.30 or something. So I was coming into Denkun, I was under the impression that EIP 4844 isn't really going to change much like the on chain landscape because the demand for low fee chains and all those users are going to Solana and l two s are still not competitive with, I guess, all the hyper speculative activity that's going over there. So I think that l two tokens not going to catch a bid. I was really interested to see like BNB just chatting your all time highs as well because I think, you know, when CC stepped down, people just thought that, yeah, Coinbase is going to take over market share, but I guess, you know, you never fade finance. Have you guys like used l two s? I know, like I was like looking to blast, but it costs like a bridge, so the user experience is still not that great there.
00:04:27.046 - 00:04:34.324, Speaker C: Hundred, when did you get 100? I did it when the gas was low and it cost me like 300 400. When did you get 100?
00:04:34.984 - 00:04:43.164, Speaker A: It was a couple days ago. I was trying to bridge from the multi, maybe because I'm trying to bridge from the multisig to the bridge, it's like a little bit different.
00:04:43.864 - 00:04:55.604, Speaker C: Yeah, I need to do the. I need to do the full because I didn't actually use the Ponzi multisig thing. I just waited for the actual launch and it cost like dollar 400 to bridge.
00:04:55.944 - 00:04:58.456, Speaker D: Was that a deterrent for your Jordy or did you just ape in?
00:04:58.480 - 00:05:35.970, Speaker C: Regardless, I didn't really like the setup of doing this multi seg thing, but now that there's projects launched, obviously there has been a lot of controversy around the tech side. It hasn't been performing very well. Also there were a ton of rugs going on, not surprisingly. I've always keep saying this. What Pac man is doing, I find very interesting, and I'm very curious to follow the journey and see how that goes. But the reason I bridged was just to support certain projects that we were invested in. We've done munchables.
00:05:35.970 - 00:06:04.344, Speaker C: It's a pretty cool NFT collection that people can get in a free NFT for depositing ETH that they get back. So very cool art, very cool project. There's blitz, so this is like the vertex perps with the local flavor. So there's some cool stuff. We're checking it out. And Justin, we were talking before the show that it's pretty cool that the dollar rates have gone up as well. You're getting 15% now.
00:06:04.344 - 00:06:07.988, Speaker C: Have you been tracking the reason for that?
00:06:08.076 - 00:06:30.914, Speaker D: Yeah, I know Tyche's done a little research on maker upping the DAI savings rate to 15% as a response to Athena. It's very interesting. I don't know where. Where the steady state is or the end state is for this market and where rates should be. Clearly, they're high. I mean, you guys have. You and Vicki Jordy have talked a lot about why Athena can actually be safe and how it's actually, like a real yield.
00:06:30.914 - 00:06:50.634, Speaker D: But at the same time, like, if the risk really is that low, the returns just don't make sense. And I'm sort of wondering how long the returns can stay that elevated before larger players come in, bring the rates down. Um, yeah. So I'm curious what your guys thoughts there, but clearly, like, it just doesn't make sense to have safe 75% yields on the dollar, right?
00:06:51.254 - 00:07:26.530, Speaker A: That's like a bull case for crypto, right? Because that just means that more capital has to come on chain and more stable coins have to be minted. And I remember in 2022, the Fed raised rates to 5%, and then all of Defi just died. You know, like, all the products were just like, vaporware. And then, like, now bitcoin is pumping, Athena launched, and now you can lend stable coins on Aave for 1015 percent. It's pretty incredible how far we've come. I think sometimes it's good to look back in the past couple of years and be like, wow, we really did suffer through a lot, and now we're finally back, baby. Bull market.
00:07:26.530 - 00:07:27.774, Speaker A: It's really exciting.
00:07:28.114 - 00:08:10.092, Speaker C: I mean, to your question, Justin, I think there will be an inflow of dollars, like you said, more coins minted. I don't think it's actually bullish, I think it's not bullish. It's just market neutral money just looking for a home and that there are some large funds that are raising capital and going out trying to get a billion dollars in quickly to short perps, basically collect that funding. The funding on the perps is unsustainable, that's for sure. It's like well over 100%. So it's a point that will catch up. The question is, how long does it last? And it can last longer if retail is coming in faster than the tradfi money.
00:08:10.092 - 00:08:28.844, Speaker C: Now, I don't understand why tradfi money is like, not coming into to farm the basis. I think they're just a little bit scared. They don't understand the counterparty risk, and it looks too good to be true. So they're just like not touching it. They would rather put their money into real estate bonds or something. Get like, you know, seven, 8%.
00:08:29.304 - 00:08:51.216, Speaker D: Can you help me understand this journey of why it's. You don't think it's bullish in your mind? So, like, as far as I understand, how this trade would work is you'd have to buy spot and then hedge out by shorting the perp and you'd be collecting that funding, but you're buying spot, right? Which theoretically the price is going up, and shorting the perp does not impact the price nearly as much as buying spot does. Is that correct or is that not the right way to think about this?
00:08:51.400 - 00:09:51.164, Speaker C: Yeah, that's not the right way to think about it. It would affect the price equally. It would sort of compress them a little bit, ultimately. Okay, so longing the perp, like we talked about Tiki last time, he's longing like dog coins and he's paying like 200% interest APY to long the dog coins. And as long as the width keeps going up a billion dollars a week, then it's worth it. But at some point, even in the bonk guy, the bonk guy, he's just paying millions of dollars in funding rates, and at some point, even if the thing doesn't go down, he'll get tapped on it. We saw when GMX was having crazy fees, I remember last market, Andrew Kang was just yoloing big positions, but the funding was just so high that even if he got it right, it would eat into it.
00:09:51.464 - 00:10:10.540, Speaker D: I was going to say, on one hand, I don't think Thicci and traders are so short term. Does a 200% APR make much of a difference? If you're paying that and you're only in for three days. I do think the rates can stay that high intuitively, but I also think large money has to come in and bring the rates down just because they want to collect that fee.
00:10:10.712 - 00:10:45.444, Speaker C: Yeah, the question is, like, what happens after those three days? Like then you have to close your position, which means you're, you know, is everybody closing out at the same time? Let's, let's bring up a little coingecko. Maybe we can look at some of the other categories because there's so many interesting things happening in the market. We're seeing large coins just rip, which is very unusual because there's a lot of market cap that needs to happen for that. But we see on the week, you know, Cardano, your favorite coin, Justin, not really doing much. It's not down a lot today. You know, it just sort of seems to be nice and steady.
00:10:45.564 - 00:10:49.984, Speaker D: Slow and steady wins the race. We're just focusing on the academic side.
00:10:50.364 - 00:10:56.116, Speaker C: Has Charles Hoskinson been Youtubing? Has he done his usual?
00:10:56.220 - 00:11:04.330, Speaker D: I'm still waiting for. I've actually reached out a couple times. If anyone that listens is connected with him, we'd love to have him on the show, but haven't heard back from him personally.
00:11:04.452 - 00:11:20.318, Speaker C: Okay, well, hopefully the dream comes true at some point. We have avalanche doing pretty well on the week. Quite a controversial one. So we were seeing that they're buying their own meme coins with a fund. This is like a official thing.
00:11:20.406 - 00:11:56.912, Speaker A: I think last year, like December or something, they raised some money or they created this new community fund where they're gonna allocate some money to pump their own meme coins. And I think the project has to be, there's some criteria, like the LP has to be locked, the token has to be live for 30 days. It has to have at least like a $1 million market cap or something. And then if those criteria are met, then the Eva labs can't buy their own meme coin. So, you know, so this coin called tech, it's complete vaporware, right? And the meme is. Oh, it's good tech. Like technology is improving and stuff.
00:11:56.912 - 00:12:04.464, Speaker A: I bought this thing like at launch and then I sold it when Emin tweeted about it. I just used Eminex and liquidity.
00:12:04.884 - 00:12:48.778, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, this is obviously super controversial. And I've seen other podcasts try to talk about meme coins. It's a touchy subject. I think some of the more like sober people have pointed out that the reason why meme coins are not all funny games is because retail is the one that loses money with meme points, right? So, like, potentially, like, a retail pressure, which nobody really wants. We all want to be good with the masses that are coming in from outside of crypto and joining in. How do we feel about a founder tweeting about a meme coin? Is it mainstream enough that this is okay now?
00:12:48.866 - 00:13:07.514, Speaker D: It strikes me, honestly, as a little. Well, two things. One, it's a little desperate. The avalanche is doing well enough that I don't think you have to be, like, getting that desperate tweeting these meme coins. And we were talking about this a little before the show. I think it's actually a bad thing when, like, the larger projects get involved with the meme coins. It just seems sterile.
00:13:07.514 - 00:13:32.010, Speaker D: It's kind of like the meme of, you know, like, the guy with the skateboard, like, hey, kids, like, how are you doing it? It's like, clearly a guy that's too old to be hanging out with high schoolers. Just seems like you're trying a little hard to be cool and to fit in and to try to force something to work when all of the successful memes that we've seen have been, like, happy accidents, right? They haven't been this, like, completely planned, programmed thing that, you know, the establishment, quote, unquote, has been endorsing.
00:13:32.202 - 00:13:56.774, Speaker C: So I wouldn't say they're all accidents. There are accidents, and then there's the ones that are a little bit extractive. Like, there's been a plan in place to. This is not done by the foundations and the blockchain. This is done by, like, very savvy. Oh, geez. Like, the origin of Pepe, I'm not quite sure, is fully organic, for example.
00:13:56.774 - 00:14:13.242, Speaker C: And you could say that about certain other coins as well. But from a trader's perspective, I guess it's a completely different thing. And thickie's looking at it tactically. Are you still putting dog spreads, thicky? Is there a Wif bonk spread still going on?
00:14:13.298 - 00:14:49.268, Speaker B: No, I got out of all of that two days after we talked about it in steady labs. I believe, like, three. But, I mean, I think it's, like, analogous to a foundation incentivizing protocols to build on them by giving out grants, their native token. There's some sort of it that's kind of like that, but they don't usually do it by just conducting open market operations and just buying all their defi tokens, for example, they usually give grants to the builders and they build stuff, as opposed to, like, oh, we're just going to buy all these meme coins and get them to pump. So, like, people come and buy them and speculate on them. But in that aspect, I agree with Justin. It's a little cringe.
00:14:49.268 - 00:14:55.556, Speaker B: But, like, I see where they're coming from. It's, like, not too different than, like, incentivizing protocols to build on them or something.
00:14:55.700 - 00:15:35.474, Speaker C: I think we're at this stage where meme coins are not well understood. The attributes of them that make them fair game and, like, fun and, like, community versus extractive haven't been analyzed enough in terms of, you know, the launch or, like, who's benefiting, who's pumping it. Like, it's something that I find to be more analogous to, like, casino slots. Everywhere I go and I'm meeting people, they're trading meme coins right now. Like, it is a. It is like a use case. People are trading Joe Bowdens and, like, all this, like, random stuff.
00:15:35.474 - 00:15:46.664, Speaker C: And actually, especially girls, like, the girls that are in crypto, buying crypto, they like the meme coins more than trading other stuff.
00:15:47.564 - 00:16:31.884, Speaker A: I think Justin and I sometimes talk about how jaded we get sometimes from this industry because of the lack of actual apps. And we've had, let's say, a two year bear market, let's say, but we still don't really have good, good apps. It may be the result of the incentives to build infrastructure over apps is forcing people to say, okay, like, all these. All this stuff is vaporware. Like, if I'm going to buy something, I might as well buy some dog coin where I don't have to deal with insider allocations or whatnot. And I think that kind of makes sense, actually. I think over time, the longer you are in the space, you become more cynical, and then maybe you are led down this path of, okay, let's have this Barbell strategy of the majors and just dog money.
00:16:31.884 - 00:16:42.136, Speaker A: I wouldn't, like, I've heard cases of, like, a meme coin super cycle, which I'm not sure if I agree with, but it's definitely becoming a narrative now, and I'm still trying to get my head around it.
00:16:42.240 - 00:17:13.436, Speaker C: I think ultimately what people want is to be early. That's the whole game in crypto, is having someone come in later than you. And if the narrative for some time was bitcoin, the institutions are going to buy her bags. That works really, really well. Now, the narrative after that is meme coins, retails coming in, they're going to buy our bags, and, like, this is the stuff that they're going to like. You know, it's like the dog with the hats and stuff. So that seems to have worked again.
00:17:13.436 - 00:17:16.876, Speaker C: Well, I can't argue with the results of this stuff.
00:17:16.980 - 00:17:51.184, Speaker D: One thing I was going to ask is like, do you guys see the majors having like capped upside in the long term? Because you can't really make the case that you're early right now if you're buying bitcoin and ETH. Like, I'm not sure who the marginal buyer is right now. That's not just trading right? Like the time to buy was the last two years, but who really sees bitcoin above seventy k and thinks there's really a ton of upside here that makes the risk and return worth it versus buying the S and P 500 or going into longer tail assets. Have we hit the scale where these things just have extremely capped upsides and become less attractive?
00:17:51.764 - 00:18:00.904, Speaker C: I don't think so. I think it's extremely upside. Attractive might be seeking nodding as well, shaking his head.
00:18:01.284 - 00:18:13.228, Speaker B: I think there's a lot of money in this world that has just come around to bitcoin gold's like 10 trillion bitcoins. At 1.5, it could easily triple, triple in a decade.
00:18:13.356 - 00:18:48.544, Speaker D: On that note, I was talking to someone in a various chat group, pretty well known fund manager, and he was just talking about, think about the value of just the real estate in Miami and how much that's worth. You almost can't put a value on it, it's so priceless. And if you think of crypto as a way to get exposure to digital real estate, to hedge out risk from your government, your government's currency, property rights, et cetera, just think about how much higher and more valuable these assets can become. And I think when you think about how much value there is in the world, and if crypto captures a small percentage of that, it still has many multiples to go, is pretty much the bullish case you could make for it.
00:18:48.664 - 00:18:57.192, Speaker A: You're starting to sound like Michael Saylor. Justin, did you guys see that on Yahoo. News? He went on Yahoo. News and he said, if you don't own bitcoin, we call you poor.
00:18:57.368 - 00:19:15.694, Speaker B: I was like, dude, no. He said, there's a name for people that denominate their net worth and fiat. We call them poor. And they made like a house remix. We should try to find and play it. Maybe that should be my pasta. But like, it was a really good house remix of him saying that.
00:19:15.864 - 00:19:39.954, Speaker C: I mean, imagine like the testosterone, like going through his, you know, his dopamine testosterone combo when he has just been buying throughout and then now he's just all time highs up billions of endless dollars. Keeps buying the top. Does what he said that he was going to do for the last four years of just, like, keep buying the top. The guy must just be jacked right now. Like, he.
00:19:40.074 - 00:19:48.846, Speaker D: I mean, you see him on the interviews, he cannot hold his smile in. Like, he's literally just grinning ear to ear. The whole conversation just finally being proven right after two years.
00:19:48.950 - 00:19:54.766, Speaker C: Pretty amazing. Do you want to bring up the sailor remix, Justin? We can give it a few seconds.
00:19:54.950 - 00:19:56.902, Speaker A: But, like, most of the people who.
00:19:56.918 - 00:19:59.158, Speaker B: Are buying assets at some point want.
00:19:59.206 - 00:20:01.342, Speaker A: To sell the assets out of profit.
00:20:01.518 - 00:20:01.998, Speaker C: People.
00:20:02.086 - 00:20:11.914, Speaker D: People that use fiat. Fiat. Fiat currency as a store of store of store of value.
00:20:12.414 - 00:20:15.614, Speaker B: We call them. We pour poor. We call them poor.
00:20:15.694 - 00:20:19.674, Speaker D: Or people that use.
00:20:22.774 - 00:20:23.594, Speaker B: Currency.
00:20:27.814 - 00:20:29.514, Speaker D: Unreal. Crazy.
00:20:31.054 - 00:20:32.114, Speaker A: So funny.
00:20:32.454 - 00:20:56.222, Speaker C: I still have to say, though, like, it does feel a bit more wholesome than. Than the stuff last cycle. At this point, I actually prefer sailor to, like, whatever the hell, you know, Elon Musk was doing last cycle, where he was first pumping bitcoin, then he was fudding bitcoin, and then he was just, like, trying to do this. Dogecoin is going to be money and all this random stuff.
00:20:56.398 - 00:21:12.616, Speaker D: It's funny you mentioned that, Jordy. Just on the Elon note, actually, last night, part of the reason for the doge pump, allegedly, was that Elon Musk is once again chilling doge publicly, which is very fascinating. I don't know why he does this to himself, but, yeah, I know the doge community was very happy to see that one.
00:21:12.720 - 00:21:34.680, Speaker C: They were. And I've been seeing some of the big accounts, the influential pushers on Twitter have tried to pump dogecoin. I'm sure Thiki, you've seen this as well. Started with trading axe kind of guaranteeing $0.30, which never materialized. And then some of the other very big accounts have been talking up doge, trying to run it back. Turbo on Doge.
00:21:34.680 - 00:21:51.818, Speaker C: I don't know. I mean, it's really to tell. We might get a little jump to 30, but I don't think that the market cap allows it to go back to 84 when there's so many alternatives. I don't think it's possible. Am I mid curving thicky?
00:21:51.906 - 00:22:10.052, Speaker B: I don't think so. I think my 22 million, it's like, it's a tough one to send. Too high. And it's about, like a mission. So, like, 4% emissions a day, and then the funding is, like, 1020 bips every 8 hours. It's yeah, these things, it's very hard to sustain a pump. It's very much just like it.
00:22:10.052 - 00:22:17.428, Speaker B: Maybe it looks like, you know, big pump and bleed and then, like, big pump and then bleed and eventually get some wire, but it's definitely hard to hold.
00:22:17.556 - 00:22:41.696, Speaker D: One thing I wanted to ask you guys about doge is, like, I'm very surprised there's not a consortium of folks. Maybe there are, but they don't seem to be too active building on doge and improving it. Like, for you guys that don't know, Doge has no havings. So their last having was like, 2014. It was a long time ago, and now it's just a capped inflation amount. But theoretically, like, they could, you know, they could lower that. They could reinstate halvings.
00:22:41.696 - 00:22:48.912, Speaker D: Like, they could do things to sort of pump the price up more and make doge more scarce. But it doesn't seem like there's been much drive from their community there.
00:22:49.008 - 00:23:13.048, Speaker B: Well, they also use, they also use litecoin miners as their proof of work. So, like, they'd have to get the litecoin miners to agree to hard fork it to have a new emission schedule. And right now, given that litecoin is having and dogecoin isn't, a big percentage of the litecoin mining revenue comes from Doge. So I think they're not incentivized to reduce the emissions from Doge because Jackson.
00:23:13.096 - 00:23:28.722, Speaker A: Palmer, the founder of Doge, he thinks crypto is a scam. So I don't really think there's a developer community. I know there's doge chain and there's dogenols, but I don't really think it's getting that much traction. I think those should just be, you know, just the meme itself.
00:23:28.818 - 00:23:44.218, Speaker D: I think there's a huge opportunity here. I mean, I partially agree building is bearish, but I also think, like, for someone that's well known in the crypto space, you could basically, like, take one of these legacy chains over and just become, like, the voice of that legacy chain and drive, you know, development or adoption wherever you'd like.
00:23:44.306 - 00:24:05.086, Speaker C: What's the, what's the incentive? Like, what? Like, why would anyone serious was actually effective do that when, you know, to buy 1% of the supply, which is, you know, the incentive that a real builder needs at least, like, 1%. You know, they would have to spend, like, $200 million to get enough coins to do that. Like, why would they spend their time on that?
00:24:05.190 - 00:24:26.154, Speaker D: It's kind of like the sailor analogy, right? Like Elon, for one period of time it seemed like Elon was willing to do that with doge. Like, he talked about how doge could actually be the currency that scales to meet the world's needs and talked about how they could drive adoption there. And it's rumored he owns a ton of doge, but I think it has to come from, like, a very wealthy, eccentric person that just wants to that as, like, a fun pet project.
00:24:26.534 - 00:24:28.550, Speaker B: I think he's, like, fucking around partially.
00:24:28.622 - 00:24:44.974, Speaker A: Too, because, I mean, obviously Elon is looking at Doge again because he talked about it, but I think if doge gets to a certain price, I think he's going to, like, just go hard. I think right now it's too low for him to care, but once it gets over, like 30, $0.40, he's going to send it. I think he'll try at least once.
00:24:45.094 - 00:25:03.724, Speaker C: I've always been skeptical of this doge thing. I've been proven right 100 times so far when I. I'm, like, against the doge bullishness. And first of all, Tesla is down the toilet. I don't know if anyone's seen their growth is zero. The stock is bleeding. It's still at overpriced multiples.
00:25:03.724 - 00:25:23.904, Speaker C: He's not in a position of power. He's going through all kinds of restructuring lawsuits, different stuff. Now, does he try to go onto it? I don't know. I saw he was tweeting Pepe's the other day, and Pepe was pumping. There's always a shinier thing for people, right? I don't know if.
00:25:24.324 - 00:25:52.812, Speaker B: One interesting thing I noticed was that whenever these meme coins pump, these AI coins go down and vice versa. They're very anti correlated sectors. And then I realized, wow, dogecoin is Elon Musk's coin and world coin is Sam Altman's coin, and they're completely anti correlated, and they're also embroiled in a lawsuit about OpenAI. Like, is this going to be like, you know, the PvP coin of this cycle is world coin versus dogecoin.
00:25:52.948 - 00:26:04.104, Speaker C: This is like when bit boy was, like, fighting the Harry Potter. Sorry, Obama inu. And then, like, whoever wins is going to, like, his coin is going to pump, the other one's going to go down.
00:26:04.444 - 00:26:07.344, Speaker B: Exactly. Exactly. Everyone wins that trial.
00:26:10.004 - 00:26:23.242, Speaker C: Let's talk a little bit about AI coins. I mean, AI is like, obviously one of the key narratives, and AI and meme coins seem to be the flavor right now. Have any of you guys been buying any AI coins yet?
00:26:23.418 - 00:26:49.102, Speaker A: No, I'm looking into them. I am pretty bullish AI. Because one thing about AI agents is that if you expect, let's say, five years from now that half of the transactions on blockchains is done by AI agents, then they're not going to care about user experience. So we don't really have to fix these, I guess, Uiux issues if most of blockchain transactions are done by agents. So I've been looking into.
00:26:49.238 - 00:26:51.670, Speaker C: Are you bullish, Algorand? Is that what you're saying, Taiki?
00:26:51.742 - 00:26:52.846, Speaker A: No, no, no.
00:26:52.990 - 00:26:54.150, Speaker D: Definitely not.
00:26:54.342 - 00:27:19.404, Speaker A: Definitely not. Algorand. I think bittensor is interesting. I'm still looking into it. There's autonomous, I feel like every crypto project, their incentive is to become an AI token. So that incentive alone should just bring more attention to the space and just inflate the pie or bubble. And I think it's kind of risky to not own any I coins, I think.
00:27:19.404 - 00:27:28.528, Speaker A: I don't own any, I just own like Nvidia and stuff. But I don't know, I think AI is going to be like this perpetual bubble for the next couple of years.
00:27:28.696 - 00:28:09.204, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the narrative is definitely, you know, last week my pasta was a joke about crypto's not AI money. Like, what does it have to do with AI? But I've been thinking about it more and trying to like take a different approach to how I think about it. And one fact that I think is really interesting is that I'll see if I can find the dune dashboard or where the data comes from. But the majority of volume on uniswap does not come from the UI. Of course, some goes through aggregators, like one inch cow swap, etcetera, but the vast majority of volume, and intuitively, you just know this is from like mev bots. And in some ways, like that is like an AI system, right? Like people are programming bots to react to price based on like certain parameters they've set. And presumably those get more advanced.
00:28:09.204 - 00:28:32.664, Speaker D: Those start to incorporate AI, like build training models, start learning and adapting and growing off of each other. And so I wonder if, like, is uni the AI coin, right? When the fee switch goes on, are they going to just be harvesting some of this profit from all of these folks swapping that are just AI agents? And are most blockchain transactions going to be represented by AI, like Taiki mentioned?
00:28:33.134 - 00:29:22.430, Speaker C: I'm not sure about that. So the reason why that's the case is just because the price discovery is happening on centralized exchanges and somebody has to arb all these pools back in line, the LP's might still win out because the amount of fees that they're getting overtakes the amount of real volatility. It's something that I've talked about on my twitter in the past. I've found that there are opportunities like harvest volatility, and these LP's might be harvesting the volatility where the price sort of ends up in the same spot, but these MEV bots are just paying them 30 bps or 100 bps each time, constantly. So they make money, and then the people losing are the centralized exchange traders that seem to be getting liquidated up and down. And that sort of carries through to the MEV bots, which then hedge to the LP's. So everybody else makes money except for the retail.
00:29:22.430 - 00:30:02.132, Speaker C: But on this AI narrative, I agree with you guys, this is just going to keep going. The very few, like, legit teams are getting a lot of attention, which shows to me that there is demand from the space. The market is saying, like, take my money, like, take my money, just like build AI stuff. And there's like projects like Netmind, you know, if you have some like, legit founders that at least like, have the pedigree to conceivably, like, be doing something, everybody seems to know about them and everyone's like trying to like, throw money at this stuff, even though it's like super early. So it goes to show that we're very early innings on the Aix crypto narrative.
00:30:02.268 - 00:30:07.304, Speaker D: Do you think it's more than a narrative, that it is real? Jordy? I guess that's the bigger question.
00:30:07.644 - 00:30:23.404, Speaker C: There will be real ones. They're not all going to be real. There's going to be a ton of vapor and a lot of opportunistic people just trying to get the tag you want to get tagged on Coingecko, whatever. As an AI coins, you get the beta of the sector.
00:30:24.144 - 00:30:58.030, Speaker B: Yeah, in my mind, like, the most obvious bullish use case of AI and crypto comes from, like, running, like, what they call deep in, or like, decentralized, like, physical infrastructure networks. The thesis being, like, if model, like, running models, like certain models, like, running certain, like, ways of inference get regulated. So let's say, like, you know, if the government tries to ban AI girlfriends, but like, obviously it's a very in demand sort of thing than, like, running it through a crypto network that's decentralized and hard to regulate. Makes a lot of sense.
00:30:58.222 - 00:31:06.314, Speaker D: Yeah, it's interesting. Crypto's, like, original use case was regulatory arbitrage and still is to some extent, and that'll be interesting to see if it carries over to AI.
00:31:06.654 - 00:31:49.176, Speaker C: Let's talk a little bit about the eft ETF. So we are starting to see the odds going down. There's like the, the prediction markets about the ECTF, and I've started to see that there is quite a repricing. We're down at 29%. So I guess the market is expecting at this point a delay, which is maybe why the ETH BTC ratio has kind of stalled out again. Do we think that this is priced in right now? I mean, it looks like the prediction markets are pricing in. Will the market be shocked if it takes longer than expected or at this point are.
00:31:49.176 - 00:31:53.484, Speaker C: People kind of think it's a matter of time, but it's not going to be May?
00:31:54.104 - 00:32:21.250, Speaker D: Yeah. My base case is because ETH BTC has broadly been flat. And also most altcoins are either flat or up on bitcoin. I don't think the ETH ETF has been priced in yet. I think the market's sort of expecting a rejection on Blackrock or, excuse me, a rejection in May. I'm personally still of the mindset that unless Blackrock polls like this thing, is 90% going to happen, I don't think Blackrock just woke up on a whim one day and said, well, we're trying the bitcoin ETF. Let's just try an ETH one.
00:32:21.250 - 00:32:43.430, Speaker D: There's coordination. That happens. It's not like there's no conversations like, this is the biggest fund manager and the biggest regulator. They have open channels of communication, presumably a pretty good relationship, a healthy relationship. A lot of people from the SEC end up working at Blackrock, vice versa, et cetera. There's a lot of you scratch buyback, I scratch yours. And so I think the SEC is really going to approve this thing, as I've stated.
00:32:43.430 - 00:33:19.344, Speaker D: I think if Blackrock's still in, this thing is going to happen. I also was listening to another podcast that brought up an interesting point, that it's an election year, so there's uncertainty who will be leading the SEC after that election year, depending on who wins. And if Gary Gensler wants, thinks there's a chance Trump wins and he wants a good position, right. Like it's in his interest to reward Wall street with something they clearly want, right. The Blackrock product is the most successful ETF of all time, or all of the bitcoin ETF's are. Most of them are the most successful ETF's of all time. Wall street is printing Wall street, to some extent, is their biggest customer.
00:33:19.344 - 00:33:33.820, Speaker D: Like, do they really want to complicate things and reject an ETF that would also be very successful? I don't think they want to do it in an election year. I think the incentives are aligned to approve the ETHTF. There's really no downside for the SEC approving it. So that's my two cent.
00:33:33.972 - 00:33:38.276, Speaker C: Well, I mean, on the bitcoin, when we saw it was a three two decision and, like, gensler was the.
00:33:38.420 - 00:33:50.636, Speaker D: That's. That's the wrong way to think about it, though, Jordy. It's. It's not like these are, like, blind votes where they never had discussed it before, and one day they decide to, like, share their opinions. It's a coordinated situation. Right. Like, they literally.
00:33:50.636 - 00:33:53.666, Speaker D: It's not like they just. Just randomly left it up to a vote.
00:33:53.770 - 00:34:04.922, Speaker C: I think that's even more bearish, though. It kind of, like, says that, like, they wanted to say that it was close. They wanted to be like, don't just assume that these are going to go through. Like, I want to.
00:34:04.978 - 00:34:11.934, Speaker B: I want to offer Justin a one to one bet live on air that UTF will not get approved by May.
00:34:12.474 - 00:34:20.926, Speaker D: But are you going to match the polymarket odds? Because why would. It just doesn't make sense to take the bet when the polymarket odds are. I don't know how liquid this is. We could see, but.
00:34:20.990 - 00:34:30.406, Speaker B: Oh, you should be. I mean, if you're so confident, you should be, like, max sizing this thing. Justin, you can get a few hundred k off on this and then make three to one on your money.
00:34:30.550 - 00:34:33.046, Speaker D: What better are you offering me, Vicki?
00:34:33.230 - 00:34:50.064, Speaker B: I'm offering 55th. Back when. Back when this thing was at 45, I really wanted to just. My internal odds were, like, 20, and I really wanted to just, like, be the biggest no on this market. Just to flex. Not because I thought it was a good risk reward, but my partner vetoed it because he didn't think it was a good use of capital.
00:34:50.144 - 00:35:01.560, Speaker D: So I have an idea. Let's just. We'll do 50 50. Let's just each say one ETH for the sake of, like, fun with the show. Whoever is right, if I'm right in, it's approved. You give me one ETH. If I'm wrong and it's rejected, I give you one ETH.
00:35:01.632 - 00:35:18.144, Speaker B: All right. Sounds good. Sounds good, Preston. I want to give my personal take on this, though. I feel like. Feel like after, you know, the ETF crew, balcunis, Tourette, safar, they all mentioned. It was kind of weird that there were no comments getting pulled for ETH, given that it's like, you know, two months away.
00:35:18.144 - 00:35:58.834, Speaker B: I think even though that, like, it seems that, like, most people don't think it's going to come, like, the fallacy that people commonly have in markets is that, like, it's not what most people think, it's what the dollar weighted average person thinks. And I think, like, you know, this ETH run has been galvanized by, like, a few really rich whales. Like, we saw Justin sun by half the yard of ETH on chain. We saw Richard Hart by 4 million. I think maybe, like, 1020 people can account for two $3 billion of flows in ETH. And given that it's a smaller market cap, if the bitcoin ETF is getting 10 billion and ETH gets, like, three, then it should roughly keep up the same line. So, yeah, I feel comfortable betting against Richard heart on this.
00:35:58.834 - 00:36:07.898, Speaker B: I think it's getting a pull, and I think BTC will fall maybe seven, 8% when the applications get withdrawn for me.
00:36:07.986 - 00:36:08.282, Speaker C: So.
00:36:08.338 - 00:36:15.162, Speaker D: So do you think the poly market odds are correct in your view, like, 30%, one in three chance that this thing is approved?
00:36:15.298 - 00:36:22.874, Speaker B: Uh, my internal odds are closer to, like, 20, maybe 15, but it's not, like, large enough for me to. Yeah, it's, like, roughly accurate.
00:36:22.914 - 00:36:35.520, Speaker D: And is that, are these, is that based on, like, no offense, but is that based on anything other than a hunch? Like, of course, we've all read the tweets from the ETF experts we've looked at. We've all seen the same information, but, like, how are you actually coming up with that number?
00:36:35.642 - 00:37:02.812, Speaker B: I, like, talked to a few lawyers about this, and I think their conclusion is that Gary really ultimately comes down to what Gary wants. You can just come with some B's excuse for why the correlation argument is not as sound for ETH, as well as bitcoin. And worst case, they take it to court and he loses the court battle. But at the end of the day, the SEC is a dictator in this situation. It's just trying to predict what he wants to do.
00:37:02.948 - 00:37:29.240, Speaker D: Can I ask you, though, are the, where are the incentives aligned? Are the incentives not aligned for Gary Gensler and the SEC to approve this? Like, I don't see any reason to reject it other than, like, I don't think Gary actually has, like, a fundamental, angsty position against crypto. I think it's been a political choice. I mean, he clearly likes crypto. He taught a class on blockchain and sees the value. And I think he was an Algorand. Bull like Tyche. So it's not incredible.
00:37:29.240 - 00:37:32.084, Speaker D: I'm just kidding. I think it's mostly been posturing.
00:37:32.704 - 00:37:34.324, Speaker B: Like, you just caught a stray.
00:37:35.144 - 00:37:40.364, Speaker D: Posturing is important. But, like, where are the incentives? Vicki, where are the incentives?
00:37:40.744 - 00:37:55.124, Speaker B: I don't know. I think, like, I don't think it's crazy to believe that, like, you know, Gary was enamored by the tech, and he loved it a lot when you taught it at MIT. And then, like, after regulating and seeing all these scams, like, he sort of, you know, turned against it, like, after seeing retail get hurt in the last cycle.
00:37:55.564 - 00:38:02.228, Speaker D: But ETH is not that, right? Like, ETH is a lot of things. You can love it or hate it, but it's not a scam. I mean, that's pretty well established.
00:38:02.356 - 00:38:08.844, Speaker B: I mean, a lot of, you know, a lot of uniswap rogues on ETH and ETH forks and Ethel two, a lot of money lost.
00:38:09.004 - 00:38:20.352, Speaker A: So if that's your view, thickey, are you just, do you think ETH BTC is going to break down below 0.05? Or how would you play that as, like, a trader investor?
00:38:20.468 - 00:38:47.212, Speaker B: I don't think it's great risk reward to just short ETH, especially since it's like, it is a good asset. It's deflating. A lot of people like it. I think they're willing to defend 0.05. So for me, I'm just like, not very long ETH, and I'm just long bitcoin and sol with the idea, like, when it does get withdrawn, there will be flows into those assets, and then I eventually want to buy ETH again, because deep down, I do think ETF will get approved and it'll go to ten k, but it's just the path.
00:38:47.328 - 00:38:54.224, Speaker D: Jordy, you've been pretty quiet on this for this show and also the last one. Like, do you, what are your thoughts on the odds for the ETF approval?
00:38:55.164 - 00:39:35.024, Speaker C: Yeah, like I said, I expect that it'll eventually happen, but it might not happen right now. And we saw Trump going on tv talking about people buying his sneakers and all this stuff. So he seems to be, you know, very likely the next president, as GCR, the wise bird told us years ago. And I would not be surprised if he ends up being more pro crypto this time around than he was previously. It's all about incentives. If you have a little bit of a bag, you get a bigger bag, then your crypto doesn't look so bad anymore. Maybe it's okay if all this stuff starts to get government approval I just.
00:39:35.064 - 00:39:41.284, Speaker D: Realized I gave thicke free money with that bet because he can just hedge out the bet on polymarket and win either way.
00:39:41.774 - 00:39:48.038, Speaker B: I'm not gonna do that. Justin. It's not even about the money. It's about the moral. It's about the moral victory on the show, dude.
00:39:48.166 - 00:39:51.438, Speaker A: Think he was thinking about just being the biggest. Better for the clout.
00:39:51.566 - 00:39:54.718, Speaker D: So we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens.
00:39:54.886 - 00:39:57.394, Speaker C: We have the iconic GCR tweet here.
00:39:58.334 - 00:40:00.074, Speaker B: I know. This is so funny.
00:40:00.694 - 00:40:15.796, Speaker C: Dumbest and smartest people know Trump is going to steamroll middle, grasping at justifications to convince themselves otherwise. 2024, bitcoin memes having Trump appoints dovish fed. We're going to have the biggest stocks ever.
00:40:15.940 - 00:40:17.384, Speaker D: This was a year ago.
00:40:17.964 - 00:40:19.268, Speaker C: Over a year ago. Yeah.
00:40:19.356 - 00:40:20.836, Speaker D: That is a classic tweet.
00:40:20.980 - 00:40:35.548, Speaker C: Yes. By GCR. Classic. All right, let's finish up with a pasta of the week. I think there's been quite a few pastas now that everyone's active on socials everywhere. So let's see what everybody got. Taiki, do you wanna kick off first for pasta of the week?
00:40:35.636 - 00:40:59.624, Speaker A: Yes. Yes, Justin, if you can pull it up. So this is the. This is the famous Jimmy McGill from Breaking Bad and better call Saul. But it's like, have you ever purchased Lido op or Arv as eat beta? Well, you may be entitled to financial compensation just because all these eat beta plays has just been omega cucked. And I just love these Jimmy McGill memes. It's just so relatable.
00:40:59.624 - 00:41:07.662, Speaker A: Like, all the financial damages of longing. Lida. I mean, Lido's up a lot, but, you know, it's kind of a funny meme.
00:41:07.798 - 00:41:27.558, Speaker C: Yeah. The Lido ETH spread has kind of gone down to, like, 0.008. I think that's probably around fairly priced. But people that were trying to ride the beta, I've always been saying this. The Lido is not beta to ETH. It's one to one. And probably was being overpriced.
00:41:27.558 - 00:41:38.730, Speaker C: So one for the mid curvers like me. I think we got this one right. I thought Op was doing pretty well. Wasn't op doing good? I thought, I've seen it pump pretty well.
00:41:38.882 - 00:41:39.146, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:41:39.170 - 00:41:43.454, Speaker A: Op has actually been the top performer of the three mentioned there.
00:41:44.034 - 00:41:58.374, Speaker B: I think people say it's cooked because it doesn't go up into the EIP 44, but these things just rally months ahead of time. It had a pretty massive rally in December. I just think these get priced in a lot earlier. When it does come to the event. It moves that much.
00:41:58.474 - 00:42:12.782, Speaker A: Yeah. I just realized that for Lido. Right. With Schappella. Chappella was April, and then it topped in February. And then op and arbitrum, they both topped in January. So it's like two months before the actual event.
00:42:12.782 - 00:42:16.022, Speaker A: So the markets are pretty efficient, if you think about it that way.
00:42:16.118 - 00:42:32.434, Speaker C: Can we bring up the Arb ETH chart as well, Justin? I'm a little bit scared to see what it looks like. I'm scared to see what it looks like. We're at support, Vicki. We're at support. Look at this multi year support.
00:42:32.554 - 00:42:34.890, Speaker B: I don't hate it. I think the unlocks are right up price.
00:42:35.042 - 00:42:56.032, Speaker D: It is interesting. Like, we're in, like, the only industry where we compare, like, these pseudo equities against each other. Like, we're comparing the pseudo arbitrum equity to the pseudo ETH equity. Right. Like, what other industry does that? I guess it's because, like, we all just truly want to be increasing our ETH and BTC stacks. Like, no one actually wants to hold these things. They all just want to hold them to increase, like, their base currency, which is ETH.
00:42:56.032 - 00:43:06.832, Speaker D: But it's interesting. Like, comparison really is the thief of joy. Like, if you held Arb, you're up over two x, but you know, you're only looking at it relative to ETH, where you're down only. Right?
00:43:06.968 - 00:43:33.856, Speaker C: Yeah. The charts just look completely, like, different. Like, this one looks kind of, like, bullish. Like it's consolidating for another breakout. And then you got the Arb ETH chart, which just looks like absolute death. Like, oh, my God, look like I've called this multiple times. There is no reason why these things that have unlocks will over perform over tokens that have limited supply with no unlocks coming.
00:43:33.856 - 00:43:55.416, Speaker C: That said, once we get through, I think it's March 16. March 17, we're having this arbitrary unlock. It might rip a little bit just based on the boogeyman being out the way. And given what Saul has done, I wouldn't be surprised if we do end up getting a bullish unlock. So, let's see. I'm curious to revisit this next week.
00:43:55.560 - 00:44:01.504, Speaker A: I'm curious, like, what do you guys think is ETH beta? Does it even exist? Is it just like bitcoin l two s or something?
00:44:01.544 - 00:44:02.964, Speaker D: Or staked ETH?
00:44:03.304 - 00:44:04.824, Speaker C: It's. It's Pepe, right?
00:44:04.864 - 00:44:07.512, Speaker A: Right. Yeah. I agree. Pepe and Doge, maybe.
00:44:07.608 - 00:44:14.456, Speaker C: I don't think Doge is ETH bait at all. It's not even on ETH. Or related to ETH, but Pepe's sort of like the de facto, but there.
00:44:14.480 - 00:44:26.428, Speaker D: Really isn't one over. Like, if we're talking about the long run, it doesn't exist. Like, every token seemingly bleeds against its superior token over the long run. Like, everything bleeds to ETH and ETH has been bleeding to BTC. It's very interesting.
00:44:26.556 - 00:44:59.854, Speaker C: I don't know. I mean, Suzu, last time when he had him on, he was kind of pointing out that BNB is the one token that over performs every single cycle. And it didn't seem like it was going to be the case until this recent week. Just exploding. And it's just like, once again, like, is it going to do it again? It's insane to me. You know, I had a bunch of BNB, but we've just burnt it in gas, because you use it for gas, and the volumes have been so high. Like, when you're trading 1020 billion a day, the amount of BNB that you have just gets burnt to zero.
00:44:59.854 - 00:45:05.114, Speaker C: And I check with you, like, got to get some more BNB now, and I need to buy it at $600.
00:45:06.014 - 00:45:24.592, Speaker B: That was a huge miss. I thought it was. I had this realization that was a great asset, like, in January, and I thought it was too late because I already ripped, like 20%. I was like, ah, whatever. It kept going. If you factor the bmp price with all the launch pads that launch pools and launch pads that you get, it's actually up, like, even more. Each one gives you, like, 2% return.
00:45:24.592 - 00:45:26.264, Speaker B: And there's been, like, ten of them already.
00:45:26.424 - 00:45:47.022, Speaker C: It really does give you that extra return. I. I wasn't farming the launch pools before. And then the most recent one, I think it was like, uh, one of these pixel things. I was like, whatever, I'll farm some pixel, and I check. And I got, like, a pretty chunky amount of pixel. So I think ether five is going to be similar next week.
00:45:47.158 - 00:45:52.886, Speaker D: Man, look at BNB compared to ETH. Pretty astonishing. Maybe BNB is the long term ETH beta.
00:45:53.030 - 00:45:55.790, Speaker C: Maybe it is the original fork.
00:45:55.822 - 00:46:07.776, Speaker A: I guess binance smart chain was insane last cycle. VMB, like 30 x or something. Binance marching was the Solana of last cycle. Or, like, you know, retail onboarding.
00:46:07.880 - 00:46:08.184, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:08.224 - 00:46:41.444, Speaker B: So my past of the week saw this meme called the prophetic perfect tense, which is a literary technique using the Bible, describes future events that are so certain to happen, they refer to in the past tense as if they already happen. I do feel like there's a lot of this going on with, like, oh, yeah, bitcoin is going to be 100k, under 20k, stuff like that. It's just. It's just like, it's funny because, like, I agree with them, but also as a top signal because everyone just thinks it's, like, destined to happen. So it's making a little uneasy, but, yeah, it's just something that I've been noticing a lot in the timeline.
00:46:41.524 - 00:46:43.204, Speaker A: Yeah. Ever. Everyone has a muscle memory.
00:46:43.284 - 00:46:52.064, Speaker D: How are we ever getting above 100k BTC and ten k ETH when that's like, it? That's everyone in the world and their mother's target. Like, that's literally top of mind for everybody.
00:46:53.444 - 00:46:55.108, Speaker A: Yeah, I really like that one.
00:46:55.236 - 00:46:58.444, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Strong. Justin, what do you have?
00:46:58.604 - 00:47:31.790, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. I am bringing it back with Nick Carter, friend of the show. Nick said, the fact that there's an entire cottage industry of professional haters, critics and skeptics of what has been the literal best trade in history will never not be funny to me. And this one, I think is absolutely hilarious. Like, what other industry breeds so much hate from quote unquote outsiders? Right? Like, imagine hating, like, the tech industry or the oil and gas industry, or just some other industry that has performed really well. It's completely illogical. I don't know why everyone always wants to fade crypto, but here we are again.
00:47:31.790 - 00:47:37.158, Speaker D: This is our time to sort of gloat and tell all our friends that we were right. So enjoy it.
00:47:37.246 - 00:48:01.048, Speaker C: I don't know. I mean, I'm going to be boomer here, but I feel like everyone is in the same camp as, like, the bitcoin haters, just, like, further down the road. So, like, the bitcoin people feel the same way about ETH, you know, like, oh, don't let the ETH ETF. It's just bitcoin. You know, the gold guys are about that, about bitcoin, and now the ETH guys are about that, about Solana. And pretty soon the Solana guy is going to beat that by, like, Sui or whatever.
00:48:01.176 - 00:48:08.440, Speaker D: You're so right, because no one likes being late. There's nothing worse than missing it.
00:48:08.632 - 00:48:18.448, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. We're gonna have, like, the meme coin guys be like, oh, no, like the original meme coin. Not like the hat is the original. Not like the cat with.
00:48:18.576 - 00:48:32.254, Speaker D: You know, if I remember ETH last cycle, we were like, if there weren't all these other alt l one s, like, ETH will be two x higher now because it would have all the mind share and gas would be high. Whatever. Now, like, if you're in doge. You're like, God, if there wasn't with, you know, Doge would be two x higher.
00:48:33.834 - 00:48:35.674, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah.
00:48:35.834 - 00:48:54.044, Speaker C: I think. I think the mind share argument is ultimately what the market will realize when it becomes efficient. That it's all about mind share. That's. You know, I've realized this. It's one of my deepest realizations in crypto and the value of mind share. So we'll talk about this more in future episodes.
00:48:54.044 - 00:49:12.904, Speaker C: But that's. That's a very valid point. Let me wrap up with a special pasta. So we like to read your guys comments. We like to go through. There's a few fun comments from last time. So there's a few comments about me asking you, Vicki, about your market reads.
00:49:12.904 - 00:49:42.704, Speaker C: This one says that I look up to you like a son to a father. And then there's another one that has a different side. Now you're the son and I'm the father, and they're asking if you're my adopted Quan son. So, you know, it's a duality. It's our duality of man. But actually, my favorite pasta, which is the one I'm submitting, is this one. This was a recent comment a couple days ago.
00:49:42.704 - 00:50:09.348, Speaker C: It says, the steady lads podcast has become an icon. It represents an era, a zeitgeist. It is the symbol of this cycle. World War two had Hitler, Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill. In 2020, 2022, we had do Kwan, Suzu, and Spf. Now we have Jordi, Justin, Taiki, and Thiki. In a few years, from the jacuzzi on the rooftop of your mansion with two busty blondes whisper how smart and handsome you are.
00:50:09.348 - 00:50:21.044, Speaker C: You'll sip from your 30 year triple distilled whiskey, stare at the sunset, and it is then, only then, filled with nostalgia, that you'll truly realize what an incredible time this was.
00:50:21.204 - 00:50:22.068, Speaker B: Amen.
00:50:22.236 - 00:50:22.892, Speaker C: Wow.
00:50:23.028 - 00:50:23.772, Speaker D: I love it.
00:50:23.868 - 00:50:34.724, Speaker A: I love how his profile pic is a beat. His profile picture is like a literal beat. And his username is beat coin. Oh, beat coin. Oh, bitcoin. Bitcoin. Okay, okay.
00:50:34.844 - 00:50:35.704, Speaker C: Bitcoin.
00:50:38.204 - 00:50:41.064, Speaker A: It's like a literal beat. Go back to the food farms.
00:50:41.444 - 00:50:45.500, Speaker C: I think. I think. What do you guys think? I think this deserves it this week.
00:50:45.612 - 00:50:48.500, Speaker D: How can we not give it to Jordy and beat coin 869?
00:50:48.612 - 00:50:54.364, Speaker A: And it's the YouTube comments. It's not like some random Twitter post, right? It's like our grassroots.
00:50:54.524 - 00:51:08.400, Speaker C: It's organic. It's organic. Yes. Love you guys. We like seeing how passionate everybody is. The show and it keeps us doing it every single week. And there was a guy saying he gets upset if he doesn't have his airpods with him on Friday.
00:51:08.400 - 00:51:14.920, Speaker C: So shout out to you guys out there and we'll keep doing this. So we'll see you next week. Take care.
00:51:15.072 - 00:51:15.504, Speaker D: Bye guys.
