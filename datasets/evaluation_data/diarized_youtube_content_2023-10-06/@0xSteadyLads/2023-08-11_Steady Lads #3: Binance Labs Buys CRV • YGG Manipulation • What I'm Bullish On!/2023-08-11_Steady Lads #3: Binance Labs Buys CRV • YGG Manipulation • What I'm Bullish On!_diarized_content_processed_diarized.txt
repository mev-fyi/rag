00:00:20.520 - 00:00:34.208, Speaker A: Welcome to episode three of steady lads. We have a good one this week. We have market manipulation. We have casino coins. We have a new segment. So I'm pretty excited. And, you know, we just got some market news as well, so no quiet time in crypto.
00:00:34.296 - 00:00:53.764, Speaker B: Yeah. So I guess there's. There's two big things happening. The first is this news out of binance that ties into what we discussed last week. So, as you can see here, binance actually finance labs bought $5 million of the CRV token, which is just wild. Right? Congrats to curve. I suppose I didn't see this coming.
00:00:53.764 - 00:01:32.198, Speaker B: I also didn't see all of the sort of OTC purchases happening over the last week. I did not predict that would happen, but it looks like wealthy people in the crypto space stepped up and bought these CRV tokens. I'm surprised by it, but it happened. And this is just, this is just more curve by pressure and deleveraging of Mitch's position. So great for the curve ecosystem, good for broader defi as a whole. I still don't think the core issue has been solved. Mitch's position is still too large to liquidate and too large to sell, but this definitely solves the issue in the short term.
00:01:32.198 - 00:01:33.574, Speaker B: I'm curious what you guys think.
00:01:33.654 - 00:02:10.894, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, we've looked at the cold curve situation last week. I think ultimately it's come down to individual actors having the incentive just for themselves and for their own profit, or maybe for their optics, because it starts to look, you know, that you're good for the ecosystem if you're supporting curve. And we've seen multiple people step in. I think Wintermute bought a chunk. We saw cream finance, so Machi big brother, who had invested a couple million, now some of the loan has moved from Aave to cream. So he's been willing to take it as a collateral, even though Aave is not willing to take any more Kravis collateral. So it looks like it's going to survive.
00:02:10.894 - 00:02:26.778, Speaker A: It's going to live to fight another day. And I think we have to not thank people. I think everyone's acting for their own selfish interests, and it's just kind of worked out that this has saved curve. Vicki, I know you've been looking at this very closely. What do you make of the latest developments?
00:02:26.906 - 00:03:02.494, Speaker C: Yeah, curve price just popped like 8% on the news. Finance is definitely a nice signal. I think probably one of the most legitimate buyers out of people that have announced so far. I believe right now he's taken down his loan balance on Aave from around 45 million to around 25. So definitely a lot more manageable for the Aave lenders to manage the risk. And yeah, I think this, I guess, alleviation of FUD should be good for ecosystem as a whole. And just like, more risk on behavior.
00:03:03.194 - 00:03:15.862, Speaker B: Just to be clear, thicke, he hasn't lowered his collateral, he's lowered his borrow amount, right? So the, he still has the same amount of curve tokens deposited. He's just paid back a lot of that USDT, right?
00:03:15.958 - 00:03:20.814, Speaker C: Yes, exactly. He has pulled out some curve as well. But yeah, he's definitely paid back more than he's pulled out.
00:03:20.894 - 00:03:31.790, Speaker B: I did see he was using, I forget, like a long tail niche lending platform. He added and took out a new loan, I think on cream, I saw for like 10 million stable coin dollars of stable coins.
00:03:31.942 - 00:04:02.228, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm pretty surprised at how, like, how many buyers stepped in. It seems like initially it's like these colorful characters, like Machi, big brother, cream finance, et cetera. And then we know the head of winter mute was like, okay, we're not associating with these people, but as more and more of the debt got covered, even wintermute stepped in more. I guess reputable characters stepped in. And like you said, justin, the core issue is not resolved. Right. Like, all these lending markets, they have to squeeze Mitch over time, but it gives Michael time.
00:04:02.228 - 00:04:18.110, Speaker D: And all the bad debt fears, I think is mostly alleviated. And, you know, like, crypto, like, people have small attention spans, like, in a few weeks or so, like, I don't think people will be talking about it and people will be, you know, trying to ape into, like, the next narrative that's going to be hot at this.
00:04:18.142 - 00:04:45.426, Speaker B: You know, like, yeah, there's, we definitely have a goldfish mindset in crypto. Everyone forgets and moves on within a week or two at most. The other thing, before we get into the main topics that I know we wanted to cover, and I know you have some thoughts on Jordy, are the new CPI numbers came out. So CPI was 3.2%, which is slightly up, but core came in at, I believe, about 4.7%, which seems to be a modest improvement. The S and P is up 1.2%.
00:04:45.426 - 00:04:56.832, Speaker B: Nasdaq's up one and a half percent. BTC and ETH are up a little bit, but mostly flat. So these numbers are a little bit better than I guess the market was hoping for. What are your thoughts, Jordyn?
00:04:56.832 - 00:05:16.194, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, there's been a lot of fear that we're going to get back into inflation, part two. We've already had part one, and we do have a bottom at this point. You know, markets are pretty happy that it's not happening as aggressively as feared. I do think next month could be pretty bad. We could. We could see quite a. Quite a big increase once again.
00:05:16.194 - 00:06:01.910, Speaker A: But in the meantime, we are seeing that, you know, S and P is potentially getting out of this choppy range we're seeing since the beginning of August, and we're seeing it potentially start to poke up back over the 45 50 cap that it's had recently. And that would be great for bitcoin. Absolutely. So keeping an eye on that. There is ETF announcements coming soon, and I don't think we want to get into it, because every day these things can change. When it comes to the announcement, is it going to be postponed? And probably, I guess, we might have a postponement. But in the meantime, this week, I think we saw one of the most brazen acts of market manipulation I want to get into.
00:06:01.910 - 00:07:02.252, Speaker A: And we have a nice chart that basically, I guess, to give the background, there was a listing on binance of YGG perpetual futures. This led to a ramp up and then initially, a huge spike in price. We can see that the liquidations kicked in, and we really got to a dollar, which was a five or six x from the listing price a few days ago. And then one of the most quick and sudden and ruthless collapses I've witnessed of a major coin, you know, major in the sense of the amount of trading activity that was happening on YgG was in the tens of billions. I mean, it was capturing more than 10% of the global volume on this day. So this really got the attention. There are things I've never seen in my life before.
00:07:02.252 - 00:07:40.884, Speaker A: We were getting pinged by the exchanges, by certain exchanges I won't mention. Just telling us, hey, have you seen the action on Ygg? You guys need to get in on this. Like, this was a very coordinated grab for attention on this token. And a lot of people have messaged me on Twitter, DM's, saying that they got liquidated either on the long or short side. Both sides, people got hurt. I think on the long side, people wanted to catch this momentum and they got caught, I guess, on the reversion. I guess this tweet is what we want to dig into here.
00:07:40.884 - 00:08:12.086, Speaker A: So right before this really kicked off, we have one of the, I guess, founders or CEO of DWF Labs, which is a notorious now market maker, saying publicly that this token is going to be bringing let's see, sustainability and power. And we definitely saw some power. I don't know about sustainable sustainability. Vicki, what was your impression trading this? I know you were kind of looking through throughout this period on this coin.
00:08:12.230 - 00:08:37.564, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I think for me, it was Saturday morning. For you, I think it was Saturday afternoon. Woke up everyone just talked about YGG in the group chats. You know, it's like the OI. The open interest on this, like, derivatives contract is like two x the size of the market cap. There's obviously a lot of leverage built up in the system and it just seemed obvious that it was just going to explode up.
00:08:37.564 - 00:09:16.046, Speaker C: So me and Jordy, I think, both set some limits on the short side on that first wick to the left of the tweet to just, basically just catch the unwinding of the leverage and then just make some profits. Mean reverting it down. So wicked the first time to 0.6, it drew down down to like 0.4 ish. I remember we were both discussing like, should we cover here? Should we keep going? I think you covered at like, I did four and I unfortunately kept letting it ride a little bit. I ended up covering like 0.44.
00:09:16.046 - 00:09:38.982, Speaker C: So like 10% higher. But then as soon as, like, somebody posted the fact that this DWF guy tweeted about YGGD and this guy's, like, very notorious for market manipulation and pump and dumping coins. So as soon as that happened, the market started ripping and it just went all the way up to one. It's kind of crazy. I missed the last end.
00:09:39.078 - 00:09:55.166, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I was short. I was personally short as a round two. I had a successful round one. And then I expected there would be a second pump and I did try to shorten it. I do not suggest anybody do this. I have a thread on Twitter.
00:09:55.166 - 00:10:36.378, Speaker A: I wrote it back a while back ago about how shorting is a dark art and talking about some of the things to watch out. But if you are at risk of getting liquidated, you will lose this game because they will just wick it both ways. The degree to which it was publicly announced surprised me because usually we have this binance cartel, conspiracy theories, people talking about illuminati, moving the markets, but in this case, we have a visible market maker telling us that we actually have their backing and pumping this. And it got me thinking of this scene from the big short. I don't know if Justin, if you can pull it out quickly, write a.
00:10:36.386 - 00:10:40.654, Speaker D: Loan on Friday afternoon. Big bank is going to buy by Monday lunch.
00:10:41.074 - 00:10:42.254, Speaker C: Yeah, same here.
00:10:44.154 - 00:10:49.390, Speaker A: Could you hold on a second? I don't get it. Why are they confessing?
00:10:49.582 - 00:10:52.674, Speaker C: They're not confessing. They're bragging.
00:10:53.134 - 00:10:56.994, Speaker D: Do people have any idea what they are buying?
00:10:58.894 - 00:11:01.486, Speaker C: I focus on the immigrants. You know, once they find out they're.
00:11:01.510 - 00:11:23.358, Speaker A: Getting home, they sign where you tell me. The bragging part is surprising to me. And, you know, we can, we can talk about traditional markets and why this stuff doesn't happen. But that last line is also interesting. He says, do people even know what they're buying? And I think they don't really know what they're buying. And it's just a token. It's a YGG.
00:11:23.358 - 00:11:29.462, Speaker A: People don't know what it even is. And ultimately they're just trying to trade a chart, right?
00:11:29.558 - 00:11:55.116, Speaker B: Yeah. Jordy and Thikki, I want to ask you guys, like, who's doing this? Why is it happening? And what's like, why are these people doing it? What's the motive here? Like, is it is just pure manipulation. They just pick a random token and it has nothing to do with the token itself, the project. They're just picking something that's easily pumpable. They're positioning themselves ahead of time and trying to profit. Like what? What's actually happening here and how are they doing it?
00:11:55.180 - 00:12:49.004, Speaker A: So I think they choose a certain segment of tokens that can really achieve what they want it to achieve. And, you know, we can see that if there's some announcement, you know, I don't want to comment about this token or the CEO of this specific project. And maybe she does believe that, you know, her announcement of a super quest or whatever is going on at YGG is representative of why this thing, you know, goes out by like a five x in a day. But the fact that she's, quote, tweeting DWF, who presumably is, is somebody that she's done business with on this token, shows me that maybe they understand what's actually happening. So this is a situation where it's plain and simple. It's Wild west. You have somebody who corners the market.
00:12:49.004 - 00:13:44.154, Speaker A: And I don't want to get into it too much this time, but the fact that perpetuals are this new concept, it doesn't exist in traditional finance, is very relevant to the story and why this stuff works. Perpetuals are very much a crypto concept, right? Like this kind of started with Bitmax and Arthur, and they kind of created this. Traditional finance has calendar futures, and with calendar futures, the difference is at the end there's an expiry date and somebody has to deliver something to somebody else, and things get settled. So you kind of have this market manipulation antidote, because people ultimately have to settle at this price. At the end of the day, what happens with perpetuals is that you have a funding rate which is used to link to spot the spot market. And here's where it gets tricky. If the spot market is tiny, as in YGg, you can move the market with a little bit of the supply.
00:13:44.154 - 00:14:19.146, Speaker A: These markets are very illiquid right now. Meanwhile, you have a perpetual market that trades at like hundreds, the size of what the spot market is doing. Then you can have these opportunities for, like, a crazy amount of market manipulation, because people can move the spot price by cornering a segment of the supply, especially if they're working with a project directly and getting a chunk of the supply. And then at some point just crash down the perpetual price. And that's kind of what we saw, and it was very brazen. What were you thinking, thicky, when things started crashing down?
00:14:19.250 - 00:14:48.944, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought it was. I guess I think we all kind of expected it. It's really interesting how similar this is to what they used to do back in the day with cornering the silver market or cornering whatever market. The CEO is an ex. He used to be the CEO of Huobi, Russia, and he started this year, DWF. He just started slinging money to projects left and right, like hundreds of millions of dollars in the middle of the bear market. So definitely caught eyes.
00:14:48.944 - 00:15:25.884, Speaker C: There's been a lot of, like, rumors or just talks about the fact that he was maybe, well, maybe I shouldn't get into it. Maybe just like, I don't know, Sketchy. Sketchy upbringings is basically the gist behind it. So essentially his strategy is to partner with projects that are pretty much dead that have a very small supply of spots. He gets a significant supply, and basically, just out of the blue, one day, he'll just bonk up the price. And I think the meta with crypto participants is they'll see that, oh, the price is up. This is free money if I go sell it, because usually the average participants, kind of dumb, and this works a lot more.
00:15:25.884 - 00:15:58.008, Speaker C: But what happens is you just keep sponking the price up, people keep betting that it'll go down, and eventually there's so much leverage built up that the price will go down, that when the price does eventually go up, two x or something, then everyone basically runs out of collateral and has to close their position, which is why we see these weird little patterns in the chart. Is he bonks it up, bonks it up, bonks it up to a point where pretty much everyone has to close and it just goes parabolic. And then that's when he goes and sells his supply and supposedly, or hopefully, I don't know. Hopefully, but, you know, pockets a large sum of money for doing this.
00:15:58.136 - 00:16:53.468, Speaker D: And I was looking at, like, dwflabs, their twitter page, and their first line in the bio is building the future of web3 together. They're definitely building some, a different type of future. But I guess, like, you know, if you're. If market participants are shorting this, then maybe they have their stop losses at a dollar and, like, that's a really easy target, right? And even after YGG started going up, I mean, I was looking at YGG like, I think one or two years ago. I think it's literally like a gamefi token of, like, they have a bunch of, I don't know, like people that play Axie Infinity or something, and, like, the token gets some revenue or like, whatever. Obviously, like, you know, I mean, obviously the fundamentals don't matter in the case, but I also saw people, like, trying to, like, bid up other gamefi tokens and definitely slim pickings in the crypto markets right now. And people are chasing narratives looking for things to just even feel dopamine and even get some sliver of P and.
00:16:53.476 - 00:17:17.663, Speaker B: L. What's interesting to me is that because crypto is such an international market and anyone has access to these, everyone has access to these products wherever they're based. It seems to me like something you can't really regulate or protect for, because there's always going to be a jurisdiction where people can, can get away with this. So I do wonder what the solution is, if there is any, or if this is just something we live with for these long tail or liquid assets.
00:17:18.243 - 00:18:03.210, Speaker A: That's a great point. So my personal journey in trading started from a poker background. And playing poker, you'd always tike you're thinking about GTO and what's the optimal, what's the exact perfect response to everyone's move, and you kind of reach this game theory, optimal strategy, which takes into account everything that the other person can do. So I get into trading, and I was working for one of the largest hfts in the world, and I realized that in trading, it doesn't work with GTO, you can't just try to manipulate prices in your favor. There's all these rules, insider trading laws and spoofing laws and all kinds of market manipulation. You have CFTC and CME and these guys will come after you for anything. They'll give you millions of fines.
00:18:03.210 - 00:18:41.684, Speaker A: They'll ban you. There's all these things happening, and why are they doing it? Because they want to have healthy markets. Healthy markets means the prices are kind of not getting manipulated. It means no one's like spoofing the exchanges with a bunch of junk where the matching engine gets clogged up and you can't actually properly process trades because they want the healthy functioning. They stop the GTO play from happening. Now, what we're seeing in crypto ten years later, I'm going back to the poker days because there's no CFTC CME right now that's on top of binance. Now, you know, Coinbase, some of these other ones could be a different story.
00:18:41.684 - 00:19:24.830, Speaker A: But when it comes to some of these offshore exchanges, right now at least, you know, bit get. And some of these other ones that are not really under CFTC, you're seeing the potential for GTO strategies. And GTO means we're not friends. If you're retail and I can wick you up and wick you down and you're trading perpetuals with like, the wrong leverage settings, I will come after you. And the thing that surprises me is that they're publicly, like, taking credit for this because it, it's ethically, you know, questionable. You can kind of say, you know, to wild west anywhere, anyone can do what they want, but usually you would, you would keep quiet and kind of do it behind the scenes. And it is surprising to me that we're seeing this behavior front and center and bragging.
00:19:24.830 - 00:20:03.834, Speaker A: Like they're confessing, but they're bragging about it to kind of show how important they are and how much they can move markets. And my feeling is they're trying to create something that we saw with Hasaka last bull market where they want to have this reputation that if they tell you a token, you better buy it because it's going up, which is what we saw with some of the influencers last cycle. And maybe it'll work. I mean, I was surprised. This Grachev guy, you know, he might become a meme. There's, there's a meme already going around in trading circles that we can put up. But he's trying to be a main character.
00:20:03.834 - 00:20:14.450, Speaker A: He has main character vibes all about him. He only has like 5000 followers right now. But, you know, if these pump and dumps continue, I think, I think we could see a new main character.
00:20:14.562 - 00:20:28.162, Speaker B: So you think the end game is, you know, he can just tweet, like, at some point, he doesn't even have to, like, actually move the market himself. He has enough social expectation that he's going to do that, that he can just tweet it and the market will move in the way he wants it.
00:20:28.178 - 00:20:43.648, Speaker A: To, potentially, you know, but a lot of people try to avoid becoming the main character because we usually see what happens to. It's a Game of Thrones type of situation, usually. So, you know, good luck to the new one, and. And we'll see how it plays out.
00:20:43.736 - 00:21:09.094, Speaker C: All hail gratu. Yeah, all hail gratuit. I think a lot of people have been saying that there's some regulatory arp here. They're all based in Russia. So what is anyone going to do about it? I think, I guess the solution ultimately has to lie with binance. They should be the ones to control any mark manipulation on their platform. Just like how, let's say, CME patrols any marketplace.
00:21:09.094 - 00:21:50.090, Speaker C: And, like, the test for market manipulation is very, like, subjective. It's just like, is this order bona fide? Like, if are you buying because you want to buy this, or are you buying just to manipulate someone else? And, you know, like, that sort of test needs to be there, I think, for the future, in order for, like, healthier markets, per se. That is, like, one of the main issues the SEC has with bitcoin ETF. It's like, oh, coinbase only trades like, three or single digit percentages of the spot volume, so, like, in most of its own binance. And if there's clear, like, brazen market manipulation going on and there's no oversight, then, like, they're kind of worried for, you know, investor money going into this bitcoin ETF. So definitely, like an ongoing, I guess, like, existential issue for the crypto markets.
00:21:50.242 - 00:22:15.706, Speaker A: Absolutely. I agree that the exchanges are the ones that have to be careful with this. And all the manipulators need is the listing. Once they have the listing on the exchange, you know, they need the exchange. It's an essential ingredient of being able to play these games. And the only people who could stop it is if there's vc's that have coins of that specific project and they're ready to dump in the manipulator as soon as he spikes it up. That's one way to do it.
00:22:15.706 - 00:22:53.160, Speaker A: They'll cause losses. But if there are no whales that are able to prevent the movement, then the exchanges ultimately have to step in, maybe lock accounts, give warnings. I think that's what the future holds. But this gets to the next question. DeFi is supposed to be permissionless. And if you have this thing on a DeFi platform or a very unregulated platform, we can get into rolebit and open exchange and some of these other ones. But if you had this on somewhere like that, it's just up to the user to learn not to do it, otherwise they're going to get liquidated.
00:22:53.160 - 00:23:04.100, Speaker A: Maybe it is a personal responsibility, ayn random fountainhead type of situation. Tykee, what do you see it going? If they can go anywhere, they can go to DeFi, right?
00:23:04.252 - 00:23:52.084, Speaker D: Yeah. And of course, with all these decentralized perp exchanges, as long as there's a chainlink, Oracle, any market can list whatever token. And with these decentralized perip platforms, if you go to the UI UX, it's kind of predatory. Most of these platforms, they do 100 to 150 x Max leverage, and that's sometimes the default. And I also think that other centralized, maybe purpose platforms like Rollbit and OpenXGen, Open exchange, they're leaning harder into the meme aspect. Like open exchange, the exchange with Suzu and Kyle Davies, they're listing the bitcoin token, the Harry Potter Obama Sonic Teninu, and rollbit doing 50 x leverage. And I think you can use both of those tokens is collateral.
00:23:52.084 - 00:24:01.684, Speaker D: So they're really going super hard into the current zeitgeist of meme coins going crazy. These micro communities forming with tokens that pump crazy hard.
00:24:01.844 - 00:24:30.340, Speaker A: Yeah. So speaking of rollbit, we see open exchange, which is also taking a road less traveled, and they are using rollbit tokens as collateral, which is something very new. And as well as the bitcoin number two, the Harry Potter Sonic Inu bitcoin, they're saying that they're giving demand to these tokens, and that is a unique position. Do you think it's good or bad? Taiki?
00:24:30.452 - 00:25:08.848, Speaker D: I mean, like you said, it's like targeting different users, right? Like the Harry Potter Obama sonic ten inu. Their community is insane. I don't know if you saw those memes of that guy full naked, just painting his body with the sonic colors and writing a go kart going round and round, but, you know, it's become like this entire new community. And of course, like, robot has also a strong community that comes natural after a token. Pumps really, really hard. And I think when they first launched, right, open exchange, I think the first day, 24 hours volume was like $14. And that was like this meme of like, oh my God, like, okay, like, Suzuki is like a failed product.
00:25:08.848 - 00:25:42.484, Speaker D: But now, given they keep listing these new meme coins, they also listed, like, milady futures. I think their last 24 hours volume update was like $100 million, and that's exceeding that of, I guess, decentralized perps. And it's a pretty respectable number. And I actually looked into open exchange. I tried to make an account. They take the KYC part really seriously. So on the surface, it seems like they're listing the shit coins, or whatever you want to call it, but I think the exchange itself, they're going very by the book.
00:25:42.484 - 00:26:31.604, Speaker D: And I think that whole FTX claim thing where if you lost money on FTX, you can gain immediate liquidity for whatever your claims are, instead of waiting, like, having to wait ten years to hope that you get money back, I think that's also useful. And I think this also ties into our previous conversation. But ox, it's trading at a 300 million circuit market cap. Like 700 million FTV. Of course, some people in the industry, they don't want to support Kyle, Davies and Suzu, their project, but I think if you think about the coin itself in the vacuum and the risk reward, I mean, three ac, like, they're very incentivized. Pump this token, they own a significant chunk of the supply. I doubt they're going to sell at even a billion, 2 billion, $3 billion FTB.
00:26:31.604 - 00:27:08.420, Speaker D: And if you kind of view this ox token as a social token for three ac, I can definitely see this thing coming up with a vengeance. And if you go through their docs as well, they're trying to be a more transparent and the people's version of FTX and FTX, they raised a $32 billion valuation. So what do you guys think about the open exchange token? It's been live for a few months. Right now, it's $300 million in volume. I'm sure that's going to grow over time. Are you guys okay buying this token? Do you have moral problems against that? Or are you just. Or is that like.
00:27:08.420 - 00:27:14.148, Speaker D: Or am I like, is this overthinking this entire thing around, trying to profit off of some of these crypto tokens?
00:27:14.316 - 00:27:34.816, Speaker C: I can answer this one. So I have, like, a tiny bit of aux, not like, nearly enough to shill it. So I think I can remain objective on this. Yeah, I'm not sure. Like, I don't know if any real legal charges have been brought up against sue and Kyle yet. So I guess the verdict is still out yet whether they actually did anything wrong or not, at least for now. Like, there hasn't been anything brought up.
00:27:34.816 - 00:28:21.038, Speaker C: And, like, one would imagine that, like, if there was something that, like, they could be sued for, then they should have already and it should be public. But I guess just in terms of the exchange, I know they partnered up with Coinflex, which was like, also another bankrupt exchange from the last cycle. I think what they're trying to do is kind of interesting in that, like, they're trying to provide liquidity and leverage to these long tail assets. I think we noticed that with Uniswap and Defi summer in 2018 that providing liquidity for these long tail assets is very, I guess, important. There's a lot of societal utility for doing that. So pushing the curve on that. I think it does have a lot of product market fit amongst the gens right now.
00:28:21.038 - 00:29:11.494, Speaker C: People just want liquidity on their meme coins, especially those longer tail ones, and they want leverage on them. I looked into the way they're doing that. They're kind of like doing a cross margin system, kind of like FTX try to do, where obviously their liquidation engine is responsible for managing the risk for if these tokens cascade. But I believe the OUSD and aux holders carry the risk. So I think their philosophy is that we're going to let the market price this risk instead of trying to do it ourselves. One of the biggest failures of FTX was that they offered this amazing product, but at the end of the day, the liquidation engine wasn't strong enough to handle the cascading liquidations of Luna, which left a giant hole in their books. We'll see if that ends up being a limiting factor or a helpful factor in their growth for Aux.
00:29:11.494 - 00:29:14.986, Speaker C: But I think it's an interesting experiment.
00:29:15.130 - 00:30:16.946, Speaker A: My main conclusion through both rollbit and Aux is that the value in crypto is really attention. And if you manage to grab attention, whether it's, you know, through having large Twitter account or having this, you know, notoriety, or being, you know, very brazen with, like, you know, attracting a lot of influencers like rollbit did. You can win the game through that method because there are so many exchanges, there are so many people doing similar things, that the one that wins out is sometimes just the one that gets the air time, and we're seeing both of those do extremely well. I am a bit surprised that we were seeing already a 700 million FTV on Aux, and I think even higher for rollbit at this point. Keep an eye on it. These things can blow hot and cold, but right now, it's been surprising to me at least, how well some of these projects have done. Yeah, but with that, let's go to our last segment, which is a new one that we're trying out.
00:30:16.946 - 00:30:29.698, Speaker A: It's called what I'm bullish on. And I think everybody kind of brought one thing that they're feeling bullish on right now. Justin, do you want to kick off with your, what are you bullish on this week?
00:30:29.866 - 00:30:59.074, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I think this is an exciting one, and one most people probably haven't heard about. So you guys are all probably familiar with Eigen Lair. It's this concept of restaking. Basically, you can deposit a staked ETH token, whether it's death, Coinbase, staked ETH, rocket pool, ETH, et cetera, into Eigen layer. And then eventually you'll be able to basically agree to validate other maybe app chains, other conditions, et cetera. And you can get paid an additional yield on top of your LSD for doing that.
00:30:59.074 - 00:31:34.522, Speaker B: So this is called restaking. It's sort of taking the crypto community by storm. There's only one project that's doing that right now, and it's called Eigen layer. They just raised a monster around at a very high valuation, and they have, I believe, something like 45,000 ETH locked in their early beta test contract. So quite a big platform. Now, Stator, which is a liquid staking project, just announced that they're doing liquid restaked tokens, which is another layer on top of the Eigen layer token. So now you're your receipt token for the Eigen layer token will effectively be liquid.
00:31:34.522 - 00:31:59.342, Speaker B: And now you can use that in other places in Defi, whether it's a curve pool providing liquidity on uniswap. And this is another way to sort of get your yield on top of ETH. So you have your. Your LSD yield from staked ETH. So that's about 4%. Then you have another few percent from eigen layer, presumably maybe 3%, 4% for validating, let's say, another chain. And then on top of that, now that that token, that whole basket is liquid.
00:31:59.342 - 00:32:28.052, Speaker B: You can now use that in any defi protocol. Right. It's extremely composable. So there is, of course, some pushback here that this is too much rehypothecation. And that very well may be true, but at the same time, this is certainly going to be a narrative that happens in the next cycle or when this really comes to fruition. I mean, people are always looking for more yield on ETH, and people are going to be using this. So I'm surprised it took this long for a project to announce that they're going to be supporting this.
00:32:28.052 - 00:32:37.964, Speaker B: And I think it's a big story and a little undiscovered. And I think stator is probably going to get some traction because of this. So for me, that's what I'm bullish on.
00:32:38.824 - 00:32:39.392, Speaker C: Cool.
00:32:39.488 - 00:33:36.904, Speaker A: That's quite an interesting one. I'm very curious to see how it plays out. Obviously, I've been hearing about the Eigen layer and the restaking, and my understanding is that the technology is probably going to be launched maybe early next year. In reality, there hasn't really been that much demand from apps yet in terms of requesting the security level of ETH stakers. The one thing that I've seen it being used is potentially for data availability for L2s. So I think Mantle and Celo are two that have decided that they will use the Eigen layer kind of technology for that. But yeah, right now, in terms of the yield fight between all the ETH staking components and the liquidity wrappers, I've talked to a lot of projects that are trying to become a dominant version of like you called it like a receipt token or like a token that will be able to have liquidity and fungibility while also having the yield.
00:33:36.904 - 00:34:00.554, Speaker A: And I don't know how it's going to play out, to be honest. I think Lido has the initial advantage right now where they can just say that they're the only ones that really have tens of billions of TVL. But we might see Stadder and some of these other ones create something that starts to catch up to it at some point. So that's interesting one to watch out for. Taiki, how about you? What are you bullish on right now?
00:34:00.674 - 00:34:00.906, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:34:00.930 - 00:34:56.839, Speaker D: So similarly to how stator with liquid restaking, it should boost the baseline rate for ETH, right? Because if you can earn four to 5% in ETH, then there's no reason for people to deploy ETH in other smart contracts to risk getting rugged. And what I'm bullish on, I guess, broader term, I'm super bullish defi. Now, I think I talked about this in the first episode, but I think in order for more TVL to flow on chain, I think on chain stable yields has to exceed that of the risk free rate in a safe and sustainable manner. And today there was a proposal from Aave that is trying to list SdAi stakedai s collateral makerdao. If you stake dai in the die savings rate, you can earn 5%. So you can use SDAI, which is like a liquid derivative of that as collateral, borrow the go stablecoin. And right now, the fixed borrow rate for go is 1.5%.
00:34:56.839 - 00:35:39.740, Speaker D: So now you can kind of clearly see the path for Defi stable yields to approach 10%, 12% without even having to take on too much risk. Of course there's risk, because, yeah, like, if you're doing this, you're levering up your SDI, you're looping these strategies and whatnot. But if your collateral is in this tokenized t bill, you know, that's not going to be that volatile. I think that's going to be a way for DeFi to slowly gain more TDL and for stablecoin inflows to exceed that of outflows. And if more stable coins are coming into the space and less stable coins are leaving the ecosystem, then naturally that just means there's more money within the crypto ecosystem to eventually pump and buy our bags. And I think this is the beginning of the defi bull market. This is how reflexivity starts.
00:35:39.740 - 00:36:23.208, Speaker D: Where. And if you also think about it, I have this mental model where maker is the on chain Federal Reserve, because they get to set the stable coin rate. If other DeFi protocols can't offer a yield of 5%, then there's no reason for people to deploy stable coins on there. You know, like, I think maker and rune, like, he has, like, this whole endgame scenario in his head, and I'm still not sure how that's going to pan out. But I think this is really good for the overall defi space. It should also increase on chain stable coin yields, right? Because if you can borrow USDC for 4%, stake it and die, then, you know, like, people should do that, right? And arbitrage that rate, and I think it's going to increase the amount of stablecoin velocity.
00:36:23.376 - 00:36:33.972, Speaker A: So this is interesting. I just want to understand. Take you. So. So we know treasury yields are 5%. And I can see here we're talking about 5.8. And I've seen online that there's like an 8%.
00:36:33.972 - 00:36:53.922, Speaker A: And my understanding is possibly because not everyone is staking the DAi, and so the people that are having DAi, but they're not staking it, are getting diluted by the people that are taking their yield. Or how does that work exactly? And where do you see the yield on this product? Kind of coming down to once everybody is using it properly, kind of relies.
00:36:53.938 - 00:37:36.360, Speaker D: On, like, the utilization rate of, I guess, the total amount of Dai that's staked. And if not all Dai is being staked, then, you know, it's similarly to how if you're not staking USDC at Coinbase, you're effectively being diluted. And the yield does come from like the on chain t, sorry, tokenized t bills that this off chain entity that maker works with is buying. And that's where the yield comes from. And I think, you know, over time there's been this trend of tokenized Tbl projects just popping up here and there. And this competition where like Ondo finance has their inner stable coin called USdy also paying 5%. And I think that's going to be good for the entire crypto space.
00:37:36.360 - 00:38:23.442, Speaker D: Because if you can earn like 5% on Dai, then if you're lp'ing on unisoftware or something, then why would you lp for eat USDC when you can lp for staked Eat stake Dai? And that's naturally going to improve DeFi products moving forward. So hopefully that answered your question. But I kind of see this trend shift with DeFi where we came from Djen yields with printing tokens to now, okay, we actually have a sustainable source of yield from Eigen layer restaking or just pure stake deed from Lido. And also treasury yields and additional defi money legos. Financial engineering on top of that should attract more and more capital from maybe like lower risk appetite firms like Tradfi. Like from Tradfi.
00:38:23.538 - 00:39:04.274, Speaker A: And to be clear, so the extra yield, like there's people holding Dai that are not getting the 5%, they're not getting any income. And what maker is doing is kind of saying we're going to take all the dai and there's people that are using Dai without staking it. Because potentially, you know, that's. It's easier for them. They just want to hold it as it is. I'm not quite sure exactly who these people are. I'm going to understand who are these holders of Dai that are not getting the yield, that are allowing other people to get it on their behalf? Is it just legacy people? Because I guess with uniswap v two, we see a bunch of people that just get a LP and they just leave it and they don't touch it for a long time.
00:39:04.274 - 00:39:05.514, Speaker A: Who are these people, do you know?
00:39:05.594 - 00:39:51.622, Speaker D: Well, yeah, I guess it's like lazy people. And also Dai is integrated to other like projects where you can, you know, you can use diets, collateral to farm some things. It's like the similar question of if you can stake eat for five, like four or 5%, then like why isn't all ETH being staked I think people have different risk tolerances and I think over time, like, you know, more and more ETH is going to be staked. More and more stable coins have to pass on yield to their token holders. And it's kind of like the slow transition phase where, you know, people on chain, like, they should demand high yield for their assets, right? Otherwise being they're being diluted. And I think this slow trend is what ultimately leads to, I guess, phase two of a Defi renaissance, which hopefully happens because I spend so much time in this space and defi and whatnot.
00:39:51.758 - 00:39:56.118, Speaker C: Why did they decide to only give it to stake die holders instead of.
00:39:56.126 - 00:39:57.158, Speaker D: Just all die holders?
00:39:57.246 - 00:40:10.010, Speaker C: I feel like by staking in a contract, I think Hasu brought it up in a tweet that it removes liquidity and I guess it kind of fragments. It requires least DeFi builders to support, let's say, a stake die and all their contracts. Why do you think they made that decision?
00:40:10.122 - 00:40:44.420, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess there's two parts I can answer. First of all, they're trying to gain adoption for SDAI and Aave is listing in this collateral. Some people are starting to LP SDAI with other stable coins. But part two of that, to answer your question, is this is how rune, the founder of Maker, is trying to prepare for Endgame. And Endgame is going to be this thing where Maker and Dai, they're going to just rebrand those tokens. There's gonna be a token split, and within Makerdao there's like six subdivs, and they're all gonna have tokens. And in order for you to farm those tokens, you need to stake Dai.
00:40:44.420 - 00:41:17.494, Speaker D: So it's ruin. In his forum post and whatnot, has mentioned that he's just trying to prime the market to like, hey, no stake die here. And over time we'll give you more yield. And I think that's kind of like the slow process that he's trying to go for. I'm not sure if I agree with the whole die rebrand and make a rebrand. I think there's some Lindy there having to introduce a new token contract. I'm not sure really what he's going for, but who am I to judge him because he's spending his entire life trying to grow this thing.
00:41:17.494 - 00:41:21.098, Speaker D: That's where the entire protocol is at.
00:41:21.226 - 00:41:32.536, Speaker A: It's very interesting, and I agree. It's something to look out for. Um, thiki, I think you might have an interesting one for us as well. Do you want to tell us what you're bullish about right now.
00:41:32.640 - 00:42:02.098, Speaker C: So I have to caveat. I just nuked all my long positions right before the podcast started, so I'm not long this yet. I might not even go long it, but I think it's really fascinating. So Shiba inu has, they're launching like Shibarium in, I believe, five days in a conference, which is supposed to be like their l two. So this meme coin is attempting to actually gain some utility. It's up like 20% over the past month. So there's obviously some clear retail interest.
00:42:02.098 - 00:42:42.614, Speaker C: If you go on YouTube and watch some of the videos and shorts being made. There's a ton of hype about shibarium. I guess I just thought it was really interesting reading about Shiba culture as someone who I guess was kind of late to Shiba. Initially, they put 50% liquidity in the Uniswap pool and they gave 50% to Vitalik. And very famously, Vitalik decided to donate some of it and then burn the rest. Then after he burned it, the price went up a ton because 40% of all circulating supply left the market. But this created some culture of burning shib in order to reduce supply to get to $0.01.
00:42:42.614 - 00:43:18.432, Speaker C: People, like, a bunch of people were asking like, is shibarium gonna increase the burn rate? And I did a bunch of research and like, what? Like, are they gonna, like burn shib for gas? Like, where are they getting these projections from? It turns out they are gonna burn half of a cent for Shib for every transaction. But their burn rate projections are purely based on people like, basically just sending their shib into a dead address. Like it's part of their culture just to send the shib into a wallet. And before every significant event, they will burn a bunch of shib. So if you go to the Coingecko link and hover over that question mark.
00:43:18.528 - 00:44:11.974, Speaker A: Like all of these events, just like I was asking Taiki, who are these people that have dive, but they're not getting the yield on it. The people that are involved in this thing that are just burning their tokens. It reminds me, I was watching some interview of this OnlyFans girl. I think she was on Jake Paul and she was describing how people, you know, some of her fans are sending her pictures of themselves, like on all fours with their credit card in their mouths. And you know, there's this weird, like, people that want to get like financially dominated. I don't know. You know, I'm sure some of you, some of our viewers might be into the Finn domination as it's called, you know, I don't know exactly, like, where it comes from, but are we seeing, like, with shibarium and shiba, is this just a global fndom, you know, appearance? Is that what's going on?
00:44:12.274 - 00:44:30.440, Speaker C: I think so. I think as Taki mentioned about the social tokens, like, I think especially in sort of, like, a post religious world where everyone is pretty agnostic. Like, you know, we look to these kind of cultish things to, like, get that sense of community, even though they may be kind of, like, absurd looking in. I don't know if you guys have any thoughts on that.
00:44:30.552 - 00:45:11.408, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, also, like, if they launch, like, shibarium, like, isn't that kind of bearish token? Isn't the whole point of a token to have no utility and have that be a meme and, like, as soon as you, like, have some utility for a token, I feel like, you know, I mean. Yeah. What do you think about, like, that, right? As, like, a shiva holder? Like, do you want shiv to launch its own chain? The whole burn thing is pretty funny. And fandom as a sector, like, I'm pretty bullish on that, right? I feel like that's gonna become, like, a bigger sector over time. Yeah. Elon always says, like, the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. So maybe the next derivative of onlyfans is, like, findom characters.
00:45:11.408 - 00:45:11.984, Speaker D: Who knows?
00:45:12.064 - 00:45:12.368, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:12.416 - 00:45:33.670, Speaker C: Oh, they have bone already. They have treat, they have leash, and they have shi. So they're launching four more tokens, which should be, like, kind of diverting capital from shib. It could very well be sell the news. I mean, there's a bunch of, like, games and metaverse stuff that they're. There's stuff to hope for in the future, but, yeah, who knows? Very interesting to watch. Cool.
00:45:33.742 - 00:45:43.714, Speaker A: Well, you know, I can't say I'm too bullish seeing the FTV is still 9.9 billion, but maybe it's all burned bombs.
00:45:46.934 - 00:45:47.794, Speaker C: Okay.
00:45:48.934 - 00:46:20.264, Speaker A: I remember seeing, like, crypto, you know, once all the exchanges put out their financial reserves because they wanted to show that they're liquid. I remember crypto.com, there was, like, some absurdly high percentage of Shiba Inu was in the reserve. Like, 910 figures of Shiba Inu, basically. So it's out there, people are holding it, and we'll see what happens to it. But, yeah, as a short term narrative, it's an interesting one to look out for. Cool.
00:46:20.264 - 00:47:23.750, Speaker A: And I'll tell you guys what, you know, the boomer is bullish on, and I don't know if you can guess, but I am bullish on Microsoft Azure. So Microsoft Azure, guys, AI tools and cloud blockchain. So I think we saw a very interesting pump in the last couple of days which was Aptos coming back from the dead. And I think you put it very well with your tweet thicky that there are no safe shorts. This thing was looking dead. We can bring up the chart, but this was one of the most sideways after the initial Korea upbeat related pump that we had when Aptos first launched, it had become a dead coin up until they announced that they are using Microsoft AI technology. When we saw this, this headline from Tree of Alpha, it just touches all the keywords.
00:47:23.750 - 00:48:09.576, Speaker A: All the bots are trading on AI and partnership Microsoft, it just has all the plethora. And then you look at the fine print and all that's happening is Aptos is using Microsoft products. But the way that they describe it is as if we're going to see this AI gods appear from the Aptos blockchain. So if Microsoft has the ability to create such hype with one click of purchasing a cloud program, I'm bullish aptos, but not as bullish as I am Microsoft. I think that's the real story here.
00:48:09.670 - 00:48:10.820, Speaker B: The real winner.
00:48:11.012 - 00:48:12.384, Speaker A: It's the real winner.
00:48:13.804 - 00:48:20.984, Speaker C: And yeah, this is the top comment on that tweet says FTT would not have blown up if San had known that. Simple trick.
00:48:22.284 - 00:48:25.012, Speaker A: Yeah, you have to time it right. Just, just when you need it.
00:48:25.108 - 00:48:35.370, Speaker C: Just when you need it. Yeah. So Avax ran this similar playbook back in January. They announced an AWS partnership and it like went up two X and it's just like, oh yeah, we're using, we're using the cloud.
00:48:35.532 - 00:48:47.074, Speaker A: Guys, I have an announcement to make. So Celini Capital is partnering with Apple. We have bought. So everybody has a MacBook now let's pump that price.
00:48:47.854 - 00:48:49.302, Speaker C: Wait, where's the token?
00:48:49.478 - 00:49:09.930, Speaker A: You know, we're raising around? So hopefully this news will increase our valuation that we're about to announce. Cool. All right, well, it's been a nice first segment of what I'm bullish on. I think next week we'll go back to looking at some Djen plays, but we'll make these recurring segments as well. So thanks, everybody for joining and see you next week.
00:49:10.042 - 00:49:10.394, Speaker B: Bye, everyone.
