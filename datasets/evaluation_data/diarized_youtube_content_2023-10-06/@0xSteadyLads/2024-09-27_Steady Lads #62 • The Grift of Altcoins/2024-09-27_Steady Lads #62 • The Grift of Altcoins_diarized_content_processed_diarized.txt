00:00:00.280 - 00:00:15.481, Speaker A: But don't you think at the very least disclosures are important like to what taiki's talking about Ko, what KOLs are doing, how they're, I wouldn't say tricking people, but how people are sort of being deceived and not seeing like the core premise behind what they're buying.
00:00:15.633 - 00:00:19.521, Speaker B: We have to self regulate, right? That's why Zach XVT is really important.
00:00:19.673 - 00:01:02.761, Speaker C: Zach is just like, you know, he's tracking down North Koreans which thank you Zach, I love you. But you know, he's not, he's not stopping the game, he's just sort of stopping some of the North Korean hackers which is great. There's a bigger game and the reality is the money is too big. There's too much at stake. Welcome everybody. We have episode 62 of Steady Lads. It is an exciting week.
00:01:02.761 - 00:01:06.009, Speaker C: Markets back. Are we so back guys?
00:01:06.097 - 00:01:08.609, Speaker A: Feels that way. Yeah, everything's going well. It's exciting.
00:01:08.657 - 00:01:17.073, Speaker B: Yeah. The markets bottomed token 2049 last year and now it seems like it's repeating. Maybe the bullish conference is finally a thing.
00:01:17.209 - 00:01:58.901, Speaker C: It seems like mid September every year is just sort of when, except for the FTX year, that's like the only one. But for the other times, look, it's random but it does seem to be a confluence. And this year, what I've been saying for the last weeks for anyone following my Twitter, it's just basically like macro is such a big factor and we've had a bit of a perfect storm of macro. Right now obviously stocks are printing all time highs every day. Gold is printing all time highs every day. It's only reasonable that we get at least like a bit of a push on crypto markets. Even though bitcoin and ETH are way, way, especially eth, you know, way below all time highs.
00:01:58.901 - 00:02:22.271, Speaker C: Let's get a couple charts up guys. But it is the first time in a while, in six months that we're having a lot of altcoins pump quite a lot like the weeklies on some of these. Starts to be pretty significant. Oh boy. Shiba Inu, our old friend. 28%. Yeah, Cardano coins are fun.
00:02:22.271 - 00:02:25.951, Speaker C: More than everything else on the list, Cardano is up more than all of the top 10.
00:02:26.023 - 00:02:48.513, Speaker A: My bull prediction, I, I, I actually, I can't even say it. I was going to say it's ETH season but I just can't, I can't say that with a straight face, but I think it feels that way. Right. Solana was so consensus at token 2049 that it was Scary. Like it was genuinely, very genuinely very scary. Everyone we met was bullish on the Solana ecosystem. Solana had their own conference.
00:02:48.513 - 00:02:58.393, Speaker A: It went very well, but it was so consensus. I mean Token is more of like a Solana themed event, I would say. But no one was talking about Ethereum. It was fascinating.
00:02:58.529 - 00:03:22.937, Speaker C: Well, let's look at a chart that someone posted which was the non top three chart. So it's the market cap of all the coins except the top three coins. Cool. So here we have it. So this is basically shitcoin. We don't have the top four coins or stablecoins. So it looks like we had a huge doubling around March.
00:03:22.937 - 00:03:51.923, Speaker C: Just a very sudden one month doubling from $270 billion of altcoins to 470 and the summer has been pretty choppy in the 200s and now we're at 315 guys. So I think that's why the sentiment is getting better on crypto Twitter. A lot of people are holding, you know, the dog coins and the frogs and some of the things going up here.
00:03:52.019 - 00:04:14.415, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems like there's like a lot of confluence, I guess you could say in the market there's. You've got rate cuts just hit. I know, Jordan, you think that might not be as effective as the rest of the market thinks. We've got the election coming up. Gold is ripping. Stocks are basically at all time highs. It's just a really fascinating space for the market because it also feels like, I mean we've talked about this before, but the economy is a little shaky.
00:04:14.415 - 00:04:32.105, Speaker A: Right. Unemployment's going up pretty quickly. So we'll see. But I mean at Token it was exciting. I mean everyone's so bullish on this space and it really does feel like the end of this year going into next year is really going to be a bull market on the likes that we saw in 2021 and 2022.
00:04:32.605 - 00:05:09.291, Speaker B: And don't you guys think that. I mean, I had this general thesis that the election is bullish no matter what because it removes uncertainty. We have like Kamala or Kamala saying, oh, you know, we're trying to innovate on digital assets and blockchains and you know, Mark Cuban is even trying to be the SEC chair and whatnot. So I feel like there's a lot of fear around the outcome of the election, but I don't really think the outcome is matters. Of course it matters. But you know, I think either way the removal of uncertainty I think is bullish all around. And I think as we get closer there's like less reasons to be afraid, especially with risk assets like ripping.
00:05:09.443 - 00:05:34.101, Speaker C: So guys like one of the top, top crypto traders asked me this morning if I'm bullish. He said he was kind of not sure. And he, he wasn't bullish or bearish. He was staying out of the market. I told him I'm very positive over the next month. And the reasons are one, China is easing. And this was like a headline that when I saw it, I just knew it was going to change the entire fabric of the macro.
00:05:34.101 - 00:06:21.091, Speaker C: I mean, China, for everyone who hasn't been following, has not been in a good economic situation for the entire year. They had the housing crisis where they were way over leveraged. This was the equivalent of 2008 housing crisis in the US they were going through that and for some reason the government refused to bail out. Like they were not printing money, they were not reducing rates. They had a bit of an austerity. And a couple days ago, for the first time, China has aggressively signaled that they will now start to ease financial conditions. Not exactly sure what was the difference that made them do that, but for markets it's a very clear bull signal.
00:06:21.091 - 00:07:12.017, Speaker C: So we have that, we have Kamala kind of at least showing that she's not going to nuke everything if she wins. So there's a lot of people fighting. I don't know how much those words mean anything, but it's not a bad thing that, you know, she's being more positive. And the other thing is like I've been tracking this Binance whale for a while that's been short 15,000 bitcoin, about a billion dollars bitcoin. And that whale, you know, had a chance to take a good amount of profit, around 55k, which is where we were, you know, a couple weeks ago, did not take profit. Now macro has caught up and as we speak right now, I can see them on the Binance books chasing with 500 bitcoin clips like their signature. They're just chasing to get out.
00:07:12.017 - 00:07:34.641, Speaker C: So I think they've gotten out of one third so far. There's still some to go. But this is obviously like a bullish catalyst that there is this forced buying going on. So quite a lot of forced demand. And then on the supply side, the government doesn't seem to have any immediate clips going on.
00:07:34.753 - 00:08:15.451, Speaker B: Also, one insight from Token is I had the pleasure of talking to a lot of fund managers, liquid and vc, and I think the complaint amongst the crypto native crowd is that there's a lot of money Pouring into the private markets, but not the liquid markets. But I think the consensus for the next, let's say one to two years is that liquid will outperform venture. So even a lot of VC funds, they're also spinning up liquid funds. And all those dollars will eventually hit the altcoin market, right, because people aren't LPs aren't paying 2 and 20 for people to buy Bitcoin and ETH. So I also think that that could also be bullish, like, like a good, good, good tailwind for the altcoin market as more capital flows to like investable altcoins.
00:08:15.643 - 00:08:47.021, Speaker C: It has gotten dangerous for the shorters of altcoins right now. So we talked about Coles Kohl's world last week, I think or a couple weeks ago we had Zorin Cole. Seems like he's deleted all his tweets and he's taking some time off stuff. I think even Thicky is kind of, you know, treading pretty lightly in this market. It's kind of dangerous. You start getting into redacted season when things start popping off. I like Miles Deutscher, he called it.
00:08:47.021 - 00:09:27.537, Speaker C: It's a popcorn market because you just have these random pops of random corns at different times. And those are the different altcoins. I have to say I feel mixed about all of this because on the one hand I'm happy that coins are going up and sentiment's improving and bitcoin is sort of like racing back up to all time highs. On the other hand, as we just showed, like the, the top performing coins are Cardano Shiba. You know, we can go through the list, you know, they might not be sending our best and it's a sign that we're in unsustainable kind of territory again. Once again. Yeah.
00:09:27.561 - 00:09:30.217, Speaker A: Have you guys heard about this Mudang meme coin?
00:09:30.361 - 00:09:31.045, Speaker B: Yes.
00:09:31.585 - 00:09:32.857, Speaker C: Can you share some of that?
00:09:32.921 - 00:09:54.685, Speaker A: Mudang is, I think one of the best performers of the last few days. It's sort of taken crypto Twitter by storm. I mean, just look at this thing. It, I've, you know, it's, it's one of those meme coins where you're seeing the tweets go out that like, if you had $2,000 of this meme coin a week ago or two weeks ago, you'd now have $2 million and people are posting their fumbles about it. But this thing has just gone to the banana zone. It's pretty nuts.
00:09:55.065 - 00:10:18.187, Speaker B: I think what we'd be telling is, Justin, if you share my screen literally up only because the coin Gecko chart doesn't really show previous price history, but it literally started from zero. Now it's 150. So animal spirits, I feel like two weeks ago everyone was like, oh my God, literally animal spirits, death of memes. And now it's like, oh yeah, Mudang is the future of finance.
00:10:18.361 - 00:10:35.515, Speaker C: Yeah, FTV 142, liquidity 2.4. So it's one of those like standard pump fun coins I guess, where the liquidity is about 1.5%. And so if everybody sells this a hundred million dollar asset, they, they will end up with like $2 million or 1, 1. 1 point, 1.2 to be exact.
00:10:36.495 - 00:10:49.795, Speaker A: So we've gone from dog season to hippo season. So this is for those that don't know. This is Mudang. I think Mudang's in Thailand. So there's some chatter that we might get this, this hippo to make an appearance at devcon in Bangkok. We'll have to see.
00:10:50.235 - 00:11:20.711, Speaker C: Let's get into like a bit of a serious topic which is very related and also related to the fact that as we were saying last week at Token, the place was full of booths of companies we haven't heard of. The stage that we were on is like this massive company we haven't heard of. Zebu. The Zebu stage, by the way. Good advertising, Zebu. Clearly we're doing a lot of spreading your name out. What I kind of feel like is that there's a game.
00:11:20.711 - 00:11:57.545, Speaker C: The game is worth about 10 to 20 billion dollars a year, which is more than most criminal organizations make in, you know, drugs or other things. So it's a big game. And the game is get the retail to buy your shitcoin. Okay? This is the game. There's a lot of money in this game. It's worth investing and like doing all kinds of stuff, even like quasi criminal stuff because ultimately how many people get assassinated for less than 10 to 20 billion dollars? So where does this number come from? I think every year the crypto market attracts participants in this casino that we've created. And some of it goes to exchanges in terms of fees because they're the picks and shovels.
00:11:57.545 - 00:12:29.301, Speaker C: And I think, you know, Bybit's going to make about 3 billion this year. Binance probably going to make, you know, 8 billion. And then maybe like all the other exchanges maybe make like another 5 or 6. So there's 20 billion just for the exchanges. This is just like fees. This is like for the exchanges that have made it easy money, then you have the, you know, the tethers of the world that what are they making, like 5 billion or something? 5,6 billion from treasury yields just from being the stable coin on which this casino is running. So let's call it another 5 billion.
00:12:29.301 - 00:12:55.513, Speaker C: So you have 25 there and then you have the last bucket. So the last bucket is the people who actually own the coins and they're selling the coins. This bucket I've estimated to be in a good year, 20 billion in like, you know, crappy year. Like last year, maybe like 10 billion. A lot of it is coming through Korea. I would say like close to a third, maybe a quarter, like 25 to 30%, which is a lot. It's a lot for one country that it's not like a massive country.
00:12:55.513 - 00:13:33.543, Speaker C: And then the rest of it is sort of like distributed obviously. Like there's a lot in the US and then Europe and, and you know, your, your BRICS countries, China pretty big. Even though, you know, technically they're, they're not allowed to access stuff. Who gets this money? There seems to be a chance factor to it and a, and a sort of pre planning factor to it. And when I say chance, it just means that, you know, without like really planning to, your coin got associated somewhere at the right time with a certain group. You know, it kind of picked up fire and it became like the mood mudang kind of scenario. I mean teams like yours, Justin, like you're trying to be one of those.
00:13:33.543 - 00:13:53.127, Speaker C: I mean you haven't launched a point. You've been trying to be like a legit building team to find product market fit. I know you've been building for a long time and you've been talking to me about how, you know, you're looking for that product market fit as we've talked about in crypto. Like there's the, there's the DAP and there's a token and you've been trying to find DAP product market fit without trying to get a token, right?
00:13:53.231 - 00:14:39.489, Speaker A: Yeah, that's correct. It's been really hard. I mean, because part of me wonders if that like you were talking about if the token market fit, how much of that is luck based? I mean, of course we, there's like this selection bias where all of the tokens we hear about and talk about are the ones that do well. But there is such a long graveyard of projects that launch tokens that were big in their day and have just literally gone to zero and are not getting picked up in this wave. One notable one, our project we started building in the NFT space and pivoted to ERC 20s and now pivoting to social. And when we launched our first version of the app, our biggest competitor was this project called nftfi. And they've done, I think, hundreds of millions of dollars of NFT loans, product, market fit, but their token has effectively just gone to zero.
00:14:39.489 - 00:15:08.419, Speaker A: It's a $782,000 market cap, 7.3 million. And it. This is, like, very confusing for me because a lot of the advice we get from people is like, no one's going to care about you until you launch your token. And I think that is true to some extent, but then you have this, like, other outcome, which is probably like the most likely outcome when you launch your token is it actually just goes to zero like this and it doesn't become one of the tokens we're talking about and are getting hyped. So it is tough for us to navigate. And honestly, I'm not really sure where we go from here.
00:15:08.507 - 00:15:13.501, Speaker C: I mean, you've seen a ton of companies make it make nine figures plus, you know.
00:15:13.573 - 00:15:14.265, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:15.525 - 00:15:53.873, Speaker C: Volumarket, Open Sea Pump Fund without having a token. So, you know, it is possible to get the speculation game right. And not have a token. What I want to discuss is that if you're building and you're in this game of the token game, you can accept and know what game you're playing and just try to play it and just say, fuck it, I'm playing this game. We're going to try to get part of this $20 billion that is entering the market over a year. You can do it as a grift and just do it openly. I talked to some founders and they just tell me, look, I'm just trying to get a piece of this pie like this, a fucking.
00:15:53.873 - 00:16:11.439, Speaker C: This whole space is one big grift and I'm going to retire after I do it and I'm going to make my millions and leave. Sounds really bad, right? But actually it's not the worst. I kind of respect the honesty. I respect the directness and I respect.
00:16:11.487 - 00:16:16.519, Speaker A: But they're honest to you, Jordy? Are they honest to the space in general when they're launching these tokens?
00:16:16.647 - 00:16:48.219, Speaker C: No, but at least they know they're consciously aware of the game they're playing. And that's more than I can say about the worst group for me, which is the pretenders who act as if, you know, they're playing this, like, beautiful try to save the world. You know, I'm doing good and I'm. I'm just, like, going to decentralize the future and give freedom to the masses. But then like this is still the game that they're playing. They're, they're still trying to like extract.
00:16:48.347 - 00:17:40.165, Speaker A: So I think this is like a journey that every builder goes on you, I think if you don't have like immediate success and you're not one of the like 1% of projects that have an immediate hit on their hands, there's this cynicism where you start like very idealistic and I know me and my co founder went through that where it is like you're sort of like this decentralization maxi and you're like trying to build new financial primitives and you really believe that like in 10 years all of our financial system's going to run on defi rails and then over time as like you have failures and hiccups and mistakes. I think a healthy cynicism develops where you sort of understand where the market's at right now in crypto, what product you're actually trying to build for users and what users want. And most users that are like on chain native users just want speculative money games at this point. And I think like most builders sort of arrive at that conclusion just based on who we've had on the show and talked to and whatnot.
00:17:40.245 - 00:18:12.555, Speaker C: Yeah, there's a range. You know, I think we'll get into like some of the VC games and how their role sometimes is like the worst because they're not even building like they're just literally trying to, you know, get their bags pumped at the right time. But Taiki, I want to kind of get some of your thoughts because you are the exact opposite. I mean, you've like turned down, we talked about before, all the viewers know that you've turned down all kinds of seed deals in the past and you've tried to play straight arrow and you're not nearly as rich as these guys that have gone the other route.
00:18:13.535 - 00:18:14.955, Speaker B: You just call me poor.
00:18:16.575 - 00:18:35.871, Speaker C: I'm just using your own words. I mean, you know what you say. So I know you're young and you know you're. Yeah, you have a long career ahead of you and your credibility is going to be an asset and you're building that. So I respect that a lot. But surely when you see some of this stuff or when you hear about it, how do you feel from my.
00:18:35.903 - 00:19:14.023, Speaker B: Point of view, I've operated with no ads, no sponsors, that type of mentality. I'm trying to be uncorruptible, but sometimes I see how much bankless and all These media companies make per episode. And it's like people still watch them, right? And like, they're printing money. It's like, do people really care if I start running ads? And I, like, made a million or $2 million off of, like, sponsorship fees. For me, I think that the reason why people like me, right, is like, one, I'm a mid curve, right. I'm relatable. And two, I do have, like a North Star of having some values and morals and ultimately selflessly.
00:19:14.079 - 00:19:14.391, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:14.463 - 00:19:36.535, Speaker B: It's like in the short term, I make way less money than everyone else in terms, like from content. But I think over the longer term, I think it'll give me more opportunities because, like, I went to school studying, like, marketing and branding, and that's why I take branding really seriously. And I also have, like, my personal ambitions. Like, I want to, like, write like my own Netflix show one day, right? And maybe, you know, this type of Brandy dose will get me there.
00:19:36.655 - 00:19:41.255, Speaker C: I mean, I love the goals, but let me. Let me, like, try to, like, touch on your, like, heartstrings a little bit because.
00:19:41.375 - 00:19:42.315, Speaker B: Okay, Okay.
00:19:42.905 - 00:20:03.969, Speaker C: I think I've seen things over the last, like, four years in the space I've been in rooms that no one else has been in. And I've probably. In the whole space, I would say I'm one of like, the top 10 people that has seen. I've seen some shit. You know, there are certain things that start to get to me. One is the Korea thing specifically. I bring it up a lot.
00:20:03.969 - 00:20:42.885, Speaker C: I'm seeing a clear evidence that we're dealing with a country with a birth rate of 0.68. Okay, why is the birth rate 0.68 in Korea? Because, like, young people don't feel like they have, like, financial comfort to raise kids and, and that, like, prevents them from wanting to start a family. So they're kind of resorting to a lot of speculation, right? Like, it's just like a hugely gambling culture. You go there, you know, you see it in the streets, you see it everywhere. They got burned by Luna. And so I'm trying to ask around when I'm there, like, how are they deciding to buy a certain coin? And part of it is calculation.
00:20:42.885 - 00:21:20.719, Speaker C: So if you see like aptos, for example, or, you know, Sui, like some of these companies, they spent a lot of effort, a lot of their chips of like, time and effort on building a community there. You know, they. They run all these hackathons and they, they try to get, like, the media there. Obviously it's worked. And I Think part of the reason why it's worked is because they have association with Western brands that are very big. So there seems to be an obsession in Asia, especially certain parts of Asia, with American premier brands like Meta, like Facebook. Right.
00:21:20.719 - 00:21:57.497, Speaker C: So Aptos, who came out of Facebook, you have world coin. So Worldcoin, OpenAI. Everyone's talking about OpenAI. You know, there's more that I can mention, obviously. Like, there's obsession with some of the big financial companies and stuff as well. So what ends up happening is that the gamble culture combines with, like, a belief that, like, there's a safety in betting on a Silicon Valley or like a Wall street brand. And literally hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, are funneled from a nation into the treasury of one of these projects, which might just be like a, you know, a couple guys.
00:21:57.497 - 00:22:03.257, Speaker C: Basically, it's. It's kind of undeniable that this is happening right now. It's both fascinating and terrifying.
00:22:03.321 - 00:22:13.433, Speaker A: So do. Do you see this as just like a massive wealth transfer where it just doesn't end well for these Korean buyers, but the teams in the US Mostly are making off like kings.
00:22:13.569 - 00:22:16.337, Speaker C: Yes. That is well put.
00:22:16.441 - 00:22:50.639, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think what I've seen as ball is after Singapore, it's like I get like a random, like a bunch of marketing firms, like, coming out. To me, it's like, oh, yeah, like, I can offer you this package where we'll give you these many tokens, this many tokens, and for the next month, just blow post, and then you'll make free money. So it's kind of this wealth transfer from, like, less educated retail degens to KOLs, and also, I guess, big teams with treasuries where they can eventually sell OTC or something. Uh, so, yeah, like, you know, I've seen some. Some shit too, you know, Jody, you definitely see more shit.
00:22:50.687 - 00:22:59.575, Speaker A: But what are those allocations you're seeing, tyche, like, for KOLs? Like, 0.10 bips, 20 bips, 50 bps. Like, what are the offers that you see?
00:22:59.735 - 00:23:30.281, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's like not. It's not like that much. It's usually like five to six figures of tokens in exchange of, like, bullet posting, essentially. And none of these KOLs disclose, right? Maybe they slightly disclose. They're like, I'm sponsored or whatever. But because if you're a kol, you don't want to be transparent, right? Because then you're basically telling your audience that, hey, I'm getting 100k from this project. So it's kind of like this adverse incentives, misaligned incentives, let's say.
00:23:30.393 - 00:23:48.319, Speaker A: But Taiki, to pull on your decision making and heartstrings a little more, what's better to be bankless, where you're publicly very transparent about what you're supposed to shill and who's paying your budget? Or like these KOLs that don't disclose that and have these private deals but don't have the public sponsorships.
00:23:48.447 - 00:24:18.035, Speaker B: I guess this is why a bunch of KOLs are well liked in crypto on Twitter. Like they don't disclose and then they get free tokens, they blow post, it goes up because they bullpost and then they're like, oh my God, like if you followed me, you guys would have made so much money. Whereas Bankless, it's like, oh, they make like X dollars per episode. And then it's really easy for everyone else to hate on them. It's really easy to hate on Bankless. I think that that's one of their problems. I have nothing against bankless, honestly.
00:24:18.035 - 00:24:35.523, Speaker B: But I guess it's also like pulling on the hard swings of traders. Because traders want to make money, they flock to people that make right calls. But sometimes these right calls are. It's like a direct result of people, people showing, coordinated showing. So I think that's part of the problem too.
00:24:35.659 - 00:24:50.615, Speaker A: I feel like what we're getting at is this is all leading towards a conversation about regulation. But I don't know if that solves it because we're in a global market. I mean, yes, in the US we can regulate, but where everyone has access to these assets. I just don't see that being a good solution.
00:24:51.115 - 00:25:03.609, Speaker C: Regulation is the exact opposite of the solution because it just leads to things we've had in the past, right? Like the, the one coin, right? Like the bitconnect, like all this kind of stuff.
00:25:03.697 - 00:25:19.145, Speaker A: But don't you think at the very least disclosures are important? Like to what taiki's talking about Ko, what KOLs are doing, how they're, I wouldn't say tricking people, but how people are sort of being deceived and not seeing like the core premise behind what they're buying.
00:25:19.305 - 00:25:23.161, Speaker B: We have to self regulate, right? That's why Zach XVT is really important.
00:25:23.313 - 00:25:59.347, Speaker C: Zach is just like, you know, he's tracking down North Koreans, which, thank you, Zach, I love you. But you know, he's not, he's not, he's not stopping the game. He's just sort of stopping some of the North Korean hackers, which is great. There's a bigger game and the reality is the money is too big. There's too much at stake. One of the telling things that there's something wrong is that I frequently meet marketing people in this space. Their whole job is, you know, getting micro kols for projects or maybe some big, big kol sometimes, you know, they'll have like people in Turkey and China and different countries and they'll get results for projects.
00:25:59.347 - 00:26:39.657, Speaker C: They're in this industry, they're doing very well and they don't even know who anybody is. Like, you know, like Haseeb is next to them and they're like, who's this guy? I don't know, like the founders of all. Yeah, they are like, I don't know who these people are, but they're in the industry for years and like, you know, they have a business and this business is obviously like sought out and has results. So there's a game going on. And look, it's not, I'm not here to like fully moralize. I think it's more of a reflection because when you look at casinos, they're offering what's clearly a negative sum game. You play roulette, you play blackjack, baccarat, you're going to lose money most of the time or over the long haul all the time.
00:26:39.657 - 00:27:14.699, Speaker C: Right. And I think with these meme coin roulettes and all this stuff, the sophisticated version, you know, sophisticated ignorance, as Jay Z says, is like trying to bet on these like non top two, top three points and trying to get the narrative before it shifts and then jump to the next narrative. So what we've seen the last week is that you just get this like, oh, sui. Okay. Then it's going to be like say, because it sounds like sui. And then it's going to be like the next. So like this stuff just, it gives you a bit of a chance to win and people play this game.
00:27:14.699 - 00:27:15.171, Speaker C: But.
00:27:15.283 - 00:27:25.515, Speaker A: So this is jordy. You think this is going to get even crazier over the next year, Right. Assuming we have this massive bull market that kicks off, I assume you think this is only going to increase, right?
00:27:25.675 - 00:27:54.855, Speaker C: Yeah. And my goal, I guess is to make it a bit more sustainable. And when I say sustainable, you know, idiots are going to lose money. That's the way. It's the way the world. You, you have a poker game economy where like the fish are going to lose money to the sharks, right? But if you design it in a way where they're getting some rake back and maybe like, you know, there's a cap on how much they can Buy in at any time. Maybe the game can last forever because you're not like fleecing them and then they just, you know, never come back.
00:27:54.855 - 00:28:46.777, Speaker C: You're sort of keeping the rate of attrition healthy where it's sustainable. You know, my fear is that we get these deep winters because, like FTX is one example where so many legitimate institutions got burnt that it just created like a year long, just completely cold. Like in Singapore, Temasek was involved, they invested, and then the government just stopped approving any activity, any licenses, anything in the space. Same with in the us, obviously, you have Millennium, a lot of companies that were invested and then just like froze all activity, all investment in the space. I would have preferred that not to happen. Part of the equation is who owns the bags, who's selling, who's selling these coins, these $20 billion coins. We have, you know, founders which, you know, fair enough.
00:28:46.777 - 00:29:22.059, Speaker C: They, they've created something. You have all these, like, people around them, employees that got tokens. You have all these foundation heads that they have to set up. And then of course, you also have either investors or like liquid funds that bought in. And it seems to be that around the time of these massive unlocks, there's a lot of planning to try to create good sentiment for the price. And one of the main examples going on right now, of course everybody knows, is Celestia. So Chris Berniski has been kind of getting a lot of crossfire for.
00:29:22.059 - 00:30:13.281, Speaker C: On September 14, which is a couple weeks before the first unlock, just put out a thread saying that he is longing TIA while haters spinelessly pile on downside momentum. Okay. And then he goes on, you know, you will be haunted by the thought that instead of cheating, I could have been buying TIA under $5. One thing that's triggered a lot of people here is that he has, quote, tweeted his, his Solana correct thesis from December 2022, which was almost two years ago when FTX collapsed. And when he said that they should buy under $10, which gave him a lot of credibility. And he seems to be using it two years later to cash in on trying to equate Solana $10 with Celestia at $5. What you.
00:30:13.281 - 00:30:15.985, Speaker C: You laugh Justin, I, I'm curious what you, what you make of this.
00:30:16.145 - 00:31:01.173, Speaker A: So this tweet happened September 14th, and then we fast forward to this week. So like around the 24th, 23rd, Celestia announced a hundred million dollars fundraising round, bringing the total raise to 155 million, which sounds incredibly bullish, but these teams are getting so good at sort of obfuscating what's happening behind the scenes. So, like, normally you think, oh, a hundred million dollars from investors, like, people believe in the vision, they want this token, et cetera. But then Sisyphus quote tweeted here with some like, inside information that this was an OTC deal done at a $3.5 billion valuation directly with the foundation. So this means the foundation is just basically selling TIA tokens at a discount with some sort of a lockup. It's just interesting that.
00:31:01.173 - 00:31:32.871, Speaker A: So Chris is basically shilling before the unlock, then Celestia is going around. They're actually just basically cashing out. And in some ways this is reasonable treasury management. It makes sense. But they're pitching this on Twitter and trying to like tell basically their audience that we have $100 million of VC funding coming in, when really this is just like a very simple OTC sale that, you know, like many market makers would be excited about. They're able to hedge out their risk, they're able to short exposure and deal with the unlocks. But they're basically trying to pitch this as like a bullish thing when actually it's.
00:31:32.871 - 00:31:34.775, Speaker A: It's actually kind of bearish. Right.
00:31:35.235 - 00:31:42.603, Speaker B: It depends like, what your view on Celestia is. Right. Like, if you think it's going to go to zero, then you think it's unethical behavior. But there is a chance that he is right.
00:31:42.699 - 00:32:00.505, Speaker A: I don't think the path is what matters here. I don't think Celestia is going to zero or anything like that. I think it's more just like shilling an OTC sale at a discount to like sophisticated financial actors that can hedge out exposure. And that's exactly what they're doing is like a bullish thing that we should be excited about going into the unlock.
00:32:00.675 - 00:32:48.975, Speaker B: Yeah. Also, even if you're a Celestia bowl, the unethical part here is that all the people. So there's been a lot of shilling for Celestia by liquid funds or just funds in general, by people that participated in the sale knowing that this was going to be announced around this time. So there's also this liquid game that people can play where, oh, if I know, if I invested in this OTC deal and I notice it's, it's going to be announced and funding rate is negative, then let's just buy a fuck ton of these tokens via Perss, push funding, like super negative, squeeze them, and then claim that we were right. So it's kind of like this some form of insider trading as well. It's kind of similar to what happened to CRV where all these CRV people that bought the token OTC just longed it on purps. Most likely squeezed people claimed they were right.
00:32:48.975 - 00:32:55.485, Speaker B: But it's kind of like this insider trading in a sense. I'm not sure if that's totally.
00:32:55.645 - 00:33:22.255, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, Jordy, you're, I mean you're just saying you're in the room where it happens. We can cut this part out if you don't want to talk about it. But like what were the conversations like surrounding this a hundred million dollar Celestia OTC sale? Like can you talk a little bit about the profile of the buyer? Like is it someone that's investing for the long term or is it like a sophisticated actor that is going to hedge out their exposure by shorting and isn't like a true investor in the sense that they're like long term bullish?
00:33:22.755 - 00:33:58.887, Speaker C: I mean these are kind of sophisticated long term holders, let's say like Bain Capital I think did 40% of it. So Bain obviously is sophisticated institution but they're not just like a trading firm. They're going to try to play out their thesis a bit. Generally when you see more tokens being sold, it's very unsophisticated of the market to take it as like a bullish or bearish signal. Ultimately it's increasing the supply because those two tokens did not exist as part of the market cap. Now they are kind of predestined to join the market cap. Ultimately that's more selling pressure coming at some point.
00:33:58.887 - 00:35:03.774, Speaker C: I think the perps are part of the problem. We've talked about it before that they're a very imperfect instrument and that calendar futures would've been cleaner like if people instead of betting on squeezing each other on funding rates. And you know, even, even Chris Berniski's, his second tweet is like talking about the funding rate and like he's just so excited that you can squeeze people and the people you're squeezing are basically from what I hear, some big companies like Falcon X or Galaxy will offer hedging services for people who are waiting for their unlocks. So they'll charge like 20% something 30% I'm hearing for putting the hedge on for a month and taking the risk of the funding rate. See what happens. If there was a Delivery future on November 1st after the unlocks happened, there wouldn't be any funding rates and people can just sort of bet on that delivery of that exact date. I Think that would be a lot cleaner from like a financial sense, but we don't really have those things popular for altcoins.
00:35:03.774 - 00:35:18.795, Speaker C: I think FTX was the only exchange that actually had those things and maybe they were kind of providing liquidity in them, I don't know. But I remember that FTX had all kinds of altcoin quarterly expiries that at least avoid the funding rate.
00:35:18.875 - 00:35:30.615, Speaker A: Jordy, when like someone sees this on Twitter, I mean, would you. Basically the, the advice you would give is don't, don't take these messages to be bullish or bearish.
00:35:31.195 - 00:36:22.647, Speaker C: It. It kind of like makes you think like, which part of the, which part of the puzzle can be most fixed from what is clearly a bit of a broken system? I'm not sure if it's just education of retail because, you know, that's such a difficult thing that happens over many, many mistakes and over a long time. Regulation doesn't seem to be the golden bullet. Like, it's, it's not the silver bullet either. I would say, like the thing that's disappointed me the most is one the exchanges, even like the, the major exchanges are not really doing their part to prevent much of what's going on. Either the market manipulation or the listings, you know, that they choose to do. There seems to be kind of a willingness to run it as a casino rather than, you know, a financial exchange.
00:36:22.647 - 00:36:25.927, Speaker C: To a certain extent, I think for, for me it's.
00:36:26.071 - 00:36:37.935, Speaker B: I, I think CH also mentioned this, but like the, the externality of all these games is that people are just going to meme coins because instead of PvPing against TM and investors, they can just PvP each other. And then it's like a.
00:36:38.275 - 00:36:40.371, Speaker A: Isn't it the same? I mean, we've talked about this.
00:36:40.403 - 00:36:44.067, Speaker B: There's no perception. It's the perception. No, no, it's that, right?
00:36:44.131 - 00:36:54.819, Speaker C: Yeah, the perception. Is that correct. But it's actually worse because the. I've also seen insider games on, on the meme Coin land. You know, it's. It's worse, it's worse. It's worse.
00:36:54.819 - 00:37:03.425, Speaker C: Like something like Popcat, some of these new ones, 80% of it is centrally owned.
00:37:03.845 - 00:37:29.485, Speaker A: I think this is why everyone graduates to Bitcoin. Over enough time. The more you see, the more it's just easier to just simplify your life and just hold Bitcoin. Right. Ethereum to some extent is dependent on this casino and these money games continuing. Same with Solana. And then like buying and holding things like tia, you just really don't know what you're Going to get sure it could become the next soul and perform really well.
00:37:29.485 - 00:37:39.165, Speaker A: But you're also probably going to get dumped on by VCs. And for me, this has been sort of like my transition to like. I think I'm slowly graduating towards just being a bitcoin only person at some.
00:37:39.205 - 00:37:51.085, Speaker B: Point I know that after talking to Justin, this happened. He started eth maxi and now he's like, you know, like after the cycle I'm only going to buy bitcoin. He literally switched in like a year.
00:37:51.865 - 00:38:00.489, Speaker C: Have you seen this song? You can play this song. And this is going to be Justin. Justin very soon. For one, you're going to be singing.
00:38:00.577 - 00:38:37.717, Speaker A: Evening everybody and thanks for coming out tonight. We're the Maxis, the number one bitcoin only band in the world. And this little number is very special to us. Take it away boys Take me to the moon to the bank in cyberspace I love that you're the only one no central wanker can debase. In other words, scarce and true in.
00:38:37.741 - 00:38:40.785, Speaker C: Other words Justin is so happy.
00:38:43.805 - 00:38:47.411, Speaker A: Oh my gosh, that's amazing, Jordy. I love that it's going to be.
00:38:47.443 - 00:38:59.739, Speaker C: You look like for financial investment, clearly low stress, right. For dopamine seekers and people trying to have PvP and play games and like.
00:38:59.827 - 00:39:04.495, Speaker A: And also if you want to make it, you can't make it to the same degree with bitcoin at this point.
00:39:05.035 - 00:39:10.171, Speaker C: Right. If you want a hundred x thousand x, it's not going to be bitcoin even.
00:39:10.243 - 00:39:14.015, Speaker A: I mean a shorter 10x. Right. That's literally impossible. This cycle.
00:39:14.365 - 00:39:27.301, Speaker C: Correct. So if you're kind of like going after the moon in the literal sense, you actually want to massively multiply, play this scratch off lottery ticket, then you need to enter the shitcoin casino.
00:39:27.413 - 00:40:05.869, Speaker A: The elder statesmen of crypto all say this, which is really interesting. Your first cycle, you got to learn by you're gambling on shitcoins, you're really trying to make it and you have some. If you get in at the right time and you're being really speculative, you're going to have some success. I had that story too. And then you sort of graduate to more, let's say long term sustainable bags. For me, my second cycle was an Ethereum thing. And then your third cycle, you've built up your crypto assets over the last four to eight years and at that point you just graduate to bitcoin, which I think is the ultimate bitcoin bull case.
00:40:05.869 - 00:40:09.757, Speaker A: It's like eventually everyone graduates to bitcoin.
00:40:09.901 - 00:40:21.333, Speaker C: I don't know, I just think there's different. People have different outcomes they're trying to achieve and different ways that they might achieve it. So the casino will always grow.
00:40:21.429 - 00:40:25.133, Speaker A: Stays open. The casino stays open, yeah, because the.
00:40:25.149 - 00:40:53.893, Speaker B: Majority of the market is ruled by people that want to make it right, speculating on stuff. And you kind of need to speculate on a bunch of garbage or not garbage. But I think we all have to understand that the game has gotten harder. I think people have this conception that, oh like one day retail will come and all our shit's going to a hundred x. But I think it's a lot harder than that. So in order to make it, I think you have to like really work hard. You have to understand the game, figure out like what you're good at, what your edges and just push it.
00:40:53.893 - 00:41:09.623, Speaker B: Don't be a jack of all trades, master of none. Just hone in on your skills, whether it be trading or developing things or investing. And I think that's, that's ultimately how you make it. Not by just like hopelessly like waiting for retail to come back and hoping your random coins go up like a.
00:41:09.639 - 00:41:11.695, Speaker C: Million percent, but, but that's what's happening.
00:41:11.775 - 00:41:13.075, Speaker A: Have you seen Mudang?
00:41:15.855 - 00:42:07.935, Speaker C: Yes. You know, like there's the poker player in us, right, that is just sort of like wanting to get away from the moralizing of taking grandma's money and just, just wanting to play the game as, as well as possible. And we just want to get the right strategy that's going to maximize ev Taiki and you know, previously Fiki, I think were really understanding what that mindset at least is, you know, for us as podcast hosts that are trying to give some alpha. I think part of our role is to discuss the good strategies, but I think at the same time a bit of self reflection and like collective understanding. I think ultimately what I would want to achieve is the game is not going to go away. It's going to be there, PvP, all these things going to like play out, evolve, become more sophisticated. I think the thing I want to change is the.
00:42:07.935 - 00:42:35.939, Speaker C: What is the. What is that like the lack of pretense that any of this matters? I think we should just understand that we're playing a game. It's not poker, but it's like it's the shitcoin game. This is how the game works and we're all in it. Even, even, even Ethereum and Bitcoin to a certain extent are, are part of that game. Because if you look at those things, they're not without whales. Right.
00:42:35.939 - 00:42:55.495, Speaker C: Like, even bitcoin has people that own 100, 200,000 bitcoin. If bitcoin goes up too much, then they're the ones sort of able to dump and win the ultimate game. So let's go to pass of the week and remember that it's all a game. Taiki, you want to kick off?
00:42:56.405 - 00:43:15.773, Speaker B: Yeah. So last week, for whatever reason, I was able to hang out with Vitalik and other Defi Chad founders building things. I was the only one that was not a dev that happened to be there. And I posted this picture on Twitter. Justin, if you can pull up the wholesome post. Yeah, it's just me. Defi will be great again.
00:43:15.773 - 00:43:28.597, Speaker B: And then Jaz, my friend here, the post, it's like this seems like one person doesn't belong in that photo. I literally felt like this when I was like sitting in that table. I was like, well, how am I here?
00:43:28.741 - 00:43:31.625, Speaker A: You're basically the head of the table there too, with game.
00:43:32.005 - 00:43:38.197, Speaker B: Exactly. I was telling Vitalik what to do. Just kidding. It was a wholesome discussion, wholesome breakfast.
00:43:38.261 - 00:43:45.069, Speaker C: But did they go around the table each saying how many billions are in their protocol? And then it came to you and.
00:43:45.077 - 00:43:58.685, Speaker B: You'Re like, actually it was like 90 degrees out and it was really hot and we were buying water and stuff and then we were having discussion, who pays for this? And then, you know, whose ever project has the biggest market has to pay? And then Vitalik was like, all right, I got you guys.
00:43:59.425 - 00:44:02.017, Speaker A: So Vitalik covered everybody. That's. That's sweet.
00:44:02.161 - 00:44:05.485, Speaker B: Vitalik covered for the water lunch. We paid for ourselves.
00:44:05.865 - 00:44:09.245, Speaker A: I'm sure, like austerity measures. Eth isn't doing too hot.
00:44:10.985 - 00:44:15.601, Speaker B: I know. I had to pay for my breakfast. I was so. I was like, what? I thought they're going to pay for it.
00:44:15.673 - 00:44:22.673, Speaker A: So there any big takeaways? Like, are you more bullish? The Ethereum ecosystem less bullish. Do you think Vitalik's listening?
00:44:22.809 - 00:44:42.825, Speaker B: Oh, Vitalik's definitely not listening, but I did shill him study, lads. So at some point he will come. But I think the one main takeaway was that Kane was kind of complaining. Vitalik, we're not really talking to us. You're not engaging with the Defi founders and Vitalik is kind of focusing on all these niche use cases. And I think Vitalik's mindset is that Defi doesn't need me.
00:44:42.865 - 00:44:42.993, Speaker C: Right.
00:44:43.009 - 00:44:58.135, Speaker B: It's going to thrive, like, whatever. Right. But I think the developers, they do want Vitalik's attention. They do want Vitalik to talk Positively. So I think that's kind of what we talked about. I think Vitalik kind of got that. We'll see if he actually takes it to heart.
00:44:58.135 - 00:45:19.265, Speaker B: But I think the Steadylads episode with Kane kind of spurred this entire discussion. And that's why Vitalik. The social layer worked, right? The social layer worked. And think that's also the takeaway. It's like, no. If we are vocal about change we want to happen, then it does happen. We just have to try hard enough.
00:45:19.565 - 00:45:58.315, Speaker A: My one last message for Vitalik, I think, on this topic is we've talked about how there are these, let's say, bad actors in the space and there's the cynicism in the space. I get why Vitalik isn't too excited and doesn't want to talk about Defi too much or invest in it. Help build and the future of Defi. The problem is, I think that creates a vacuum where, like, if there's not interest in what Vitalik is pitching and Vitalik's not supporting the space, that interest will shift to the next best thing. And in some ways, the next best thing is, are these, let's say, money games and wealth transfers from Korea to very successful developers in the US hopefully.
00:45:58.355 - 00:46:07.195, Speaker C: He didn't pay for. For everyone's lattes by selling ETH again. Was there like a uniswap transaction at the same time when the credit card was being used?
00:46:07.615 - 00:46:12.515, Speaker B: Yeah, so I paid for my own meal. So that's bullish Eth. There's less sell pressure.
00:46:13.015 - 00:46:29.637, Speaker C: What was. I'm curious, like, Jeff. I saw Jeff from Hyperliquid there and Hyperliquid is not an ETH project. Even though there's the bridge to Arbitrum for deposits. It is clearly an Ethereum competitor at this point. Not really ethical. Defi was.
00:46:29.637 - 00:46:35.365, Speaker C: Was there any sort of tension or was he just chilling and just. Just listening? Literally?
00:46:35.405 - 00:46:37.701, Speaker B: I don't think Jeff really said a word. He was the kind of.
00:46:37.733 - 00:46:41.853, Speaker A: I mean, do you think Vitalik's even heard of Hyper Liquid? Like, there's probably a good chance he hasn't.
00:46:41.989 - 00:47:04.685, Speaker B: Probably. Yeah, probably not. The. There was a discussion around, like, I guess, whether airdrops are good or bad. Jeff was in the camp that airdrops are good, but then everyone else was like, yeah, it's not the best way. And one thing Vitalik did say is that he wishes there was a better way to launch tokens. He wants to bring back ICOS in a compliant way somehow, like better token launch mechanisms.
00:47:04.685 - 00:47:28.625, Speaker B: Obviously, we're kind of restricted by what's legal and what's not legal, given the current regime. But I think one potential game that could bring more speculative money back to Ethereum is new ways to bootstrap speculative games. So hopefully that does come to fruition at some point.
00:47:28.785 - 00:47:38.385, Speaker A: Did Vitalik comment on the Infinix sale? I mean, to me that seems like the prime example of letting everyone get in at the same price and choose what valuation they buy in at or don't buy in at.
00:47:38.545 - 00:47:51.565, Speaker B: Well, yeah, I mean, Vitalik did not know about Infinex. Apparently he doesn't even follow Kane on Twitter. So, yeah, I guess that kind of answers the question of like, you know, does he know what's happening within, like, the Defi ecosystem?
00:47:51.645 - 00:47:54.265, Speaker A: Well, it feels good. We have a man on the inside, Ty.
00:47:54.925 - 00:48:02.565, Speaker C: Yeah, and we have it that Jeff from Hyperliquid likes airdrops, everybody. So that's some alpha. That probably.
00:48:02.605 - 00:48:03.665, Speaker B: Airdrops good.
00:48:04.165 - 00:48:34.115, Speaker C: Airdrops good for hyperliquid. That's, that's very interesting. And yeah, I think we've kind of known that, you know, Vitalik is not really like on the ground when it comes to the sort of hardcore users and what's going on out there. He doesn't know about Hyperliquid or Infinix or what these guys are doing necessarily. But that's, that's fine. That's like, I don't think that's a big deal ultimately. Like his, his role is at this point just sort of nudging things and places that he wants to nudge them and just let the code speak for itself.
00:48:34.115 - 00:48:43.745, Speaker C: Justin, I know we're going to have Kyle Somani on next episode and we'll get into that stuff. Do you have a good pasta for us in the meantime?
00:48:44.205 - 00:49:04.101, Speaker A: I do, yeah. So this, it's a two part pasta here. So Tom Schmidt was at Token. He gave a talk or two. I think he did a live podcast as well, similar to us. And he says, my top takeaways from token 2049, number one, my bags are very good. Everyone is building on my bags and the community is super strong.
00:49:04.101 - 00:49:32.509, Speaker A: Your bags are struggling to find PMF in a crisp narrative. People are leaving your bags to build on my bags. And there was truly like, I don't know if you guys felt this way, but there was like truly this feeling in the air. Like Arthur Hayes did like a big keynote presentation on why, why like Pendle and Athena are going to rip and Ando isn't because he's an investor in Pendle and Athena and wasn't in Ondo. It turned out a week later he ended up selling, I think all of his. His pendle. Right.
00:49:32.509 - 00:50:06.545, Speaker A: I think that blew up on Twitter. But this was just like a hilarious feeling I got coming out of Token. And that culminated with like sui's hot narrative boom that week. So Sui was, I would say, like the star of token 2049. And SUI performance over the course of the conference was incredible. Like I think up like 50% plus. And so iceberg, he has this tweet here of the sole guy in the cock chair, let's say, and his girlfriend here is with Sui.
00:50:06.545 - 00:50:23.829, Speaker A: Are you sure I can be with Sui and the Solana guys? Like, yes. And that's a quote tweet of Mike Ippolito's tweet of Sui. Looks like a catch up trade for everyone that missed Seoul and it really did feel like that way. But first time I heard about Sui, I should have bought it. But here we are and I still don't hold any.
00:50:23.997 - 00:50:54.971, Speaker C: It's obviously going to happen. Like Solana is going to be the next Ethereum, which was the next Bitcoin. Like Bitcoin was like having its issues and then Ethereum kind of stepped into those same issues and then Solana is just going to stay. It's just not going to be the cool new hot kid that is going to give you the big return and you're going to be lagging as people are starting to take profit after Sui. It's going to be the next one. And as we said, it's a game and we accept the game. We want to know what game we're playing and we want to play it well.
00:50:54.971 - 00:50:56.997, Speaker C: So that's it. We're gonna play a good game.
00:50:57.141 - 00:50:57.853, Speaker B: Gg.
00:50:57.989 - 00:51:15.185, Speaker C: Gg, I got a pasta here. It's by Built by Mom. It's basically like after spending all day on CT and you go to sleep and you start dreaming and this is what it looks like. So it's an AI video of what your dream looks.
00:51:48.105 - 00:51:55.615, Speaker A: Oh my gosh. We have so many characters in this space. The Curve Mansion, I think that was. That was the highlight for me. I lost it there.
00:51:55.745 - 00:51:58.535, Speaker B: And the Bankless guys were recording a podcast inside.
00:52:01.075 - 00:52:03.027, Speaker C: How good are these AI videos becoming?
00:52:03.091 - 00:52:03.835, Speaker A: So good.
00:52:03.995 - 00:52:06.235, Speaker C: I know so fast how this has happened.
00:52:06.395 - 00:52:10.899, Speaker A: The transitions are flawless and they're hilarious. The videos just morph perfectly.
00:52:11.027 - 00:52:31.067, Speaker C: So it used to be like Will Smith with spaghetti, but now we literally just have all of Crypto Twitter forming together into. So that's amazing video there. Hopefully we'll get more and More of this as AI gets better. All right everybody, well enjoy the bull market that's coming.
00:52:31.131 - 00:52:38.443, Speaker A: Part 2 Happy Eigenlayer Week. Eigenlayer stimulus checks are coming out this week which should be a nice little boost to the markets. It's exciting.
00:52:38.579 - 00:53:02.773, Speaker C: Yes. So we're seeing a pre market. It was at 5 billion. Now it's around, it's getting towards 7 billion. So I think the market improving has helped Eigen Larry could potentially be launching into what is quite a healthy little push up. I'm expecting the usual airdrop thing where we get a lot of selling and then once the sellers run out after like the first few days, it kind.
00:53:02.789 - 00:53:14.185, Speaker B: Of runs up, people will dump and then the narrative will be, well, Celestia is at like 7 billion FTB. This should be like 10 billion at least. And then I'll probably dump at like 8 or 9. That's probably going to be the game I play.
00:53:15.245 - 00:53:25.555, Speaker C: I might see if I can sell and then rebuy. I think if I can sell around 8 and then buy back around 5, that might be a good trade.
00:53:25.935 - 00:54:03.659, Speaker A: All right, so everyone get your sell orders in for 7.99 and your buy orders for 501. I the way I'm playing this is before the show, Ty and I were actually looking at this. I looked at the Celestia max, the highest FTV Celestia got to which I think was 20 billion. Obviously we're in a different market regime, but I don't see why Eigenlayer's best comp isn't celestial or even a premium to Celestia just because it has more mind share, a little bit more signs of adoption right now, but you never know how these things are going to go. But that's my bullish rant. So I'm pretty bullish on this thing.
00:54:03.659 - 00:54:12.125, Speaker A: I don't think it's a disaster if you end up holding your airdrop and it goes down 30% in the first week. I think it's probably fine to hold this throughout the next few months of the cycle.
00:54:12.205 - 00:54:18.125, Speaker C: Yeah, makes sense. Cool. All right, well, happy, happy Eigen day everybody and we'll see you next week. Take care.
