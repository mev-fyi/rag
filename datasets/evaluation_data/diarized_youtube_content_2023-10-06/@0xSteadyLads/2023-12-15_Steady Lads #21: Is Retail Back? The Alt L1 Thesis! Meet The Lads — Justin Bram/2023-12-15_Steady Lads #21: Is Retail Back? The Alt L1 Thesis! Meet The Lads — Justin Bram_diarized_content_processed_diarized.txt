00:00:00.200 - 00:00:01.674, Speaker A: Think he is retail back.
00:00:02.934 - 00:00:12.326, Speaker B: I think. I think we've definitely seen like, many indicators that it is, I don't know, like Ada Doge. So, yeah, I mean, I think ever.
00:00:12.350 - 00:00:14.594, Speaker C: Since Ada pumped, everything else is pumped.
00:00:15.094 - 00:00:25.234, Speaker D: I believe last week I said Cardano is going to outperform this cycle. I'm gonna be very sad because I didn't hold any, but I know it's going to outperform ETH. So, like, what am I doing holding ETH?
00:00:45.174 - 00:01:16.100, Speaker A: What is up, everybody? This is episode 21 of Steady Lads, and we have a good lineup today, as usual. I'm Jordy CIO of Selena Capital. We have Justin, CEO of Astaria. We have Taiki, the humble farmer, and now amazing YouTube subscribe increaser as opposed to the last two years. So we can get into that. And we welcome back our man thicky. He's with us once again.
00:01:16.100 - 00:01:29.078, Speaker A: So I really want to get to thicki first, given that we haven't had you in a while. I think probably my fault. I think last time we got the timing mixed up, but yeah, thank you. Like, how are you doing, man?
00:01:29.246 - 00:01:33.590, Speaker B: Doing well, doing well. Been traveling a bit, but glad I can make it this week.
00:01:33.662 - 00:01:37.806, Speaker A: Have you been, have you been trading the volatility pretty actively?
00:01:37.910 - 00:01:40.422, Speaker B: Yeah, I say so, yeah. Long and strong.
00:01:40.558 - 00:02:17.758, Speaker A: Long and strong. So you have some wife changing money incoming, possibly, or I hope, man. So obviously, like, long has been good. You know, very lately, I think the Fed, the Fed pivot that we saw this week was the main news, not just for crypto markets, but also for traditional markets as well. I wouldn't really call this a pivot. I think, you know, I don't know what impressions everybody's had reading the news. You know, Powell has always been a dove at heart, and I've watched his press conferences for many, many years now.
00:02:17.758 - 00:03:07.270, Speaker A: And, you know, if the economic activity and the inflation numbers allow him to be dovish, this is his nature. He is a dove at heart. So all this, like, you know, we're going to be hawkish and the ghost of Christmas past when it comes to inflation, I think that was never his true self. So market seemed to be happy. Obviously, crypto has joined in on some of that fun. I don't know, like for you guys, or maybe you don't spend all your time on macro as much, but has it been something that is, you know, crossed the boundary and kind of come into your beliefs around the market right now?
00:03:07.382 - 00:03:55.080, Speaker D: I think I said this a couple episodes ago, but I sort of proposed the hypothesis that a recession is fundamentally a policy choice, something that was really reinforced with us when we saw everything that happened with COVID and all of the stimulus. And I do fundamentally agree that's the case right now. Still, I think a recession would be a policy choice and I don't see the government basically electing to have or let us enter a recession this year. And I see them wanting to do anything they can to avoid that for election purposes. That just makes sense. That's where the incentives are aligned. But I will say like now, and we were talking a little bit about this before the show, it is so consensus that everything is bullish now that you have to sort of be a little bearish and think a little, you know, there's a little cause for concern because, and Tyke said this earlier, I don't want to steal your quote.
00:03:55.080 - 00:04:12.488, Speaker D: At the end of last year it was so hard to buy, everyone was bearish and at the end of this year it's so hard to sell. Everyone is bullish and you know, the answer is probably somewhere in the middle like it usually is. So maybe things won't be as good as we were hoping for next year, but it's hard to imagine a very poor outlook.
00:04:12.576 - 00:04:18.272, Speaker A: Thank you. Are you also in the camp of if everyone is on the same side of the boat, I want to go to the other side or what's your take?
00:04:18.368 - 00:04:48.122, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean I don't want to fight the tape. I mean if you look at core inflation and CPI as a whole, most of the inflation is in housing and housing lags. So the narrative around Powell actually creating a soft landing. The narrative is very strong, especially with just election year. We have the bitcoin halving, the bitcoin ETF. It just seems like, like Justin said, it's really hard to sell right now. So I think it's, you know, being a little cautious makes sense.
00:04:48.122 - 00:05:07.626, Speaker C: But you know, with, I think it's really, really hard to be bearish stocks hitting all time highs, I think you typically don't want to fade all time high breakouts in the indices. And I don't really consider myself to be a macro expert. So if the market tells me to be bullish, then I just think you have to have a bullish lean for the next twelve months.
00:05:07.730 - 00:05:32.374, Speaker A: Yeah, I am on the side of I guess the more bearish take. I think that we will get a double dip in inflation. I don't think that was the single time that inflation spikes. And the reason I say this is first of all having stocks at all time high. It's not sort of outside the system. It's part of the system. It's part of the inflation system.
00:05:32.374 - 00:06:15.544, Speaker A: It ties in. There is a feedback mechanism, and having this wealth effect of stocks and all assets going up will actually lead to inflation again, and we'll be stuck here. And they may or may not be able to do the rate cuts that the market is predicting that they will be able to do. I think right now the market is saying we'll get one to 2% in relatively short order in 2024. I think that we might get one or two, but if we do make a run for 5000, inflation will spike three months later with a small lag. And that makes me a little bit more cautious on the macro side. Meanwhile, crypto, maybe you could outperform for sure.
00:06:15.544 - 00:06:19.760, Speaker A: It doesn't mean that stocks crashing would annihilate crypto as well.
00:06:19.792 - 00:06:54.832, Speaker D: But Jordy, a question on that to clarify. So let's say there is a double peak or we get inflation coming back. With the Fed's slight easing here, do you not think it's possible that we could see inflation start to come back a little? But because of the political pressure, rates don't respond in the same way. And in fact, that would actually be quite bullish asset prices, because obviously, if inflation is high, that's actually pretty good assets, right? It's like bad for the dollar, but good for your assets. So is there a world where what you're saying happens, but the outcome is actually different? And it's actually quite a bullish scenario for assets?
00:06:54.968 - 00:07:43.032, Speaker A: The bullish scenario for assets, basically like currency, the basement. You know, there is no scenario where we just have free lunch and everything is just good, but there's no inflation and assets going up. It'll be because of the basement. I do think eventually, because of the debt trap that we're in, that the least bad option will be to engineer a recession, just like let a recession happen? I do think that that will be the way out ultimately from the inflation kind of debt spiral that we're in. So we get these Goldilocks periods for a few months where the market thinks maybe we're going to get a perfect soft landing, and we've just entered one again recently. But I'm a bit pragmatic, and I don't expect this to be smooth sailing and inflation will rear its head again. So that's my take.
00:07:43.032 - 00:07:49.290, Speaker A: NFA, Dyor and roller coaster emoji, applying that to crypto.
00:07:49.322 - 00:08:04.378, Speaker D: Do you think crypto is different and not part of the equity universe and crypto will decorrelate? Or does this mean now your position has changed a little bit from, I think, what it's been over the last few months where you're perhaps a little more bearish. 2024 for crypto?
00:08:04.466 - 00:08:39.653, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'm curious to hear what thiki thinks about this. I do think that we've had a bit of a decoration. I do see that, first of all, bitcoin could do quite well in a narrative of this, like, debasement and even like, a recession, inflationary sort of environment. And because of the wealth effect in crypto and bitcoin spreading out, we could have, you know, a sustained cycle even without macro being amazing because of that. Like, it just seems like the. There's enough inflows coming in specifically to the crypto space.
00:08:39.813 - 00:09:12.356, Speaker B: Yeah, it definitely seems like throughout history, there's always, like, two or three waves of this before finally something happens that we can't control. And it's kind of like forces austerity, just trying to draw patterns out of nothing. But we kind of saw the same thing with COVID and the waves and how the force austerity was forcing people to get locked in. And then people just question, why are they forcing people to stay in when, you know, COVID's down so much and then people out again, and then it starts spreading again, and then, you know, there's like. I think it's part of human nature, this kind of fractal.
00:09:12.460 - 00:09:50.056, Speaker A: Yeah, it's this, it's these, like, feedback mechanisms, right? Like, people go out and then it starts spreading again and they have to go back in. And it's the same thing. Like, as soon as the fed releases the brakes, you start getting the same behavior. And the only, the only positive thing, really, is that there is this, like, institutional institutionalization of digital assets that can overshadow a potential dip. I think s p could have, like a 20% dip coming. I think that's, that's definitely within the cards. Would not, would not shock me to see, to see that, that kind of dip, you know, we'll see.
00:09:50.056 - 00:10:21.104, Speaker A: In the meantime, it looks like end of 2020 behavior right now. Like, every dip is getting bought. There is money on the sidelines looking for dips. There's people that missed the train during this run up, and they are waiting for, like, you know, these, like, 1015 percent drops so that they can buy back in. And that's, that's pretty bullish. So, um, I do see prices being supported and, you know, it does feel like retail is kind of back. Like, thinky is retail back.
00:10:23.464 - 00:10:56.940, Speaker B: I think we've definitely seen, like, many indicators that it is not just from, like, social media standpoint, but also just, like, the type of coins that are pumping. I have a buddy who measures a lot of, I guess, like, click through rates on certain coins. He runs, like, ads on coins, and he just sees which ones have, like, the most activity. And he's definitely noticed, like, a pickup in a lot of popular retail names, like, I don't know, ada Doge. So, yeah, I mean, I think ever.
00:10:56.972 - 00:10:59.224, Speaker C: Since Ada pumped, everything else is pumped.
00:10:59.724 - 00:11:22.924, Speaker D: Yeah, I was Jordy that. I appreciate you calling that out. I believe last week I said, cardano is going to outperform this cycle. I'm going to be very sad because I didn't hold any, but I know it's going to outperform ETH. So, like, what am I doing holding ETH? And I still don't know the answer to that question other than I just don't have the conviction to hold Cardano through a downturn. I can hold e through a downturn, but I can't hold Cardano. And it's sad to see.
00:11:22.924 - 00:11:23.564, Speaker D: I mean, this.
00:11:23.644 - 00:11:24.052, Speaker B: It's.
00:11:24.108 - 00:11:32.740, Speaker D: This makes our industry a little less interesting or exciting for me. It's like, we know these assets that are vaporware will outperform. It is what it is.
00:11:32.852 - 00:11:50.260, Speaker A: Well, at least if you start to figure out these patterns, you can put a trade around it. Are these ads that are being run? Is he trying to just use the normal ads that those projects use, or is he actually trying to make his own ads for them?
00:11:50.412 - 00:12:22.994, Speaker B: I think you mentioned to me, uses AI to generate ads and just cycles through which one works the best. I haven't seen an example of them, and I'm not quite sure how the process works, but I thought it was kind of an ingenious way because measuring retail flows has always been a difficult part of crypto. You can see these flows on exchange, but you can't really see, oh, you know, can't really delineate if it's coming from Robinhood or we will, of those retail apps. And, you know, it's just typically very difficult. So using these, like, sort of alternative data indicators has been something that's, like, you know, quite interesting to me.
00:12:23.074 - 00:12:28.826, Speaker A: And, Taiki, have you been seeing a lot of retail back? What's your feeling on this?
00:12:28.930 - 00:12:57.570, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, Justin, if you can share my screen here, I mean, these are my subscriber counts for the past 18 months, from July 2022 to today. And, you know, if it's under the zero line. It's that every time I upload a video, I lose subscribers. But in the past couple of days, I mean, we're still back. I've made more subscribers in the past, let's say, five days, and I have in the past 18 months. I don't really know how to read this. I don't.
00:12:57.570 - 00:13:24.160, Speaker C: I don't think this can be used as, like, a short term, bullish like signal. But I think over, like, the next six to twelve months, I think all the weekends have capitulated. All the people that wanted to leave crypto has already left. And now we're starting to see a pickup in retail activity. And even, you know, I recorded a podcast with Ansem yesterday, and, like, people love this guy. I mean, I think Ansem is really cool. I think he's.
00:13:24.160 - 00:13:52.438, Speaker C: He's been right. And, you know, every time he goes on the podcast, people just rush to, you know, go in. And if you look at my latest comments, it's like Ryan says hex is king, J Riz says bittenster is the AI play you're looking for. I mean, it just seems like animal spirits are back. And I'm not really sure how to read into this, but I think a long and strong. This one took a screenshot. A long and strong lane over for 2024, I think makes sense.
00:13:52.566 - 00:14:33.804, Speaker A: Interesting. I mean, definitely Ansem has crushed the soul and soul ecosystem trade. I think he's been getting a lot of attention on that specific one. And we have seen quite a wealth effect there because it's not just the native token, but also we saw Jitto have a crazy airdrop, I think wasn't many wallets, so very few people actually were part of it. Jitto is one of several liquid staking protocols on Solana. I think marinade is a large one, if I'm not mistaken. And the airdrop was worth in the end, I think, minimum ten k plus.
00:14:33.804 - 00:14:49.924, Speaker A: I think at some point 20k, that's come back down. And that kind of wealth effect spreads into stuff like bonk, apparently, because people are like, oh, I have Solana money. What am I going to do with Solana money? Let's put it in dog money.
00:14:50.384 - 00:15:09.152, Speaker D: I have a funny little anecdote about that, actually. My Solana phone has finally paid off. So Solana phone enjoyers received the bonk airdrop. Didn't know this until like three days ago. Randomly on Twitter, I saw someone said, like, I just cleaned bonk with my Solana phone. Like this. Things paid for itself.
00:15:09.152 - 00:15:19.784, Speaker D: Sure enough, you download the bonk app on your Solana phone. Claim the tokens. I sold them for Solana, and now I'm a Solana holder. So this thing was worth it. I told you guys, you got to try everything.
00:15:19.904 - 00:15:41.480, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw, like, the 10 million bonk that you get or something is 30 million bonk. I think it's 30 million bunk, maybe, that you get. And now that's apparently worth, like, $450. So, yeah, if you can you just walk into a shop and get one and then just get $450 worth of bonk right now. Is that actually, like, still active or not?
00:15:41.632 - 00:15:58.758, Speaker D: They did cut the price of these things down to, like, $500, coincidentally, so there might be something to that. I don't know if they're still selling these things because we interviewed that our friend from Solana, and he told us that the Solana fail was phone was a failed experiment. So I don't know if they're still selling this thing.
00:15:58.806 - 00:16:19.174, Speaker A: But, yeah, I mean, there's probably some boxes in a third world country where they made them. And those firm, those people are going to be going in and trying to get. Get the bonk airdrop off the phones now and try to farm it. Thank you. How are you seeing this, like, Solana wealth effect? Is this something that you're trying to play or are you observing it?
00:16:19.254 - 00:16:58.086, Speaker B: I've been dabbling in it, but I do think, like, you know, these kind of stories and, like, the wealth effect, you can definitely see a trick, like you said, to, like, bonk and, like, these random new meme coins on Solana. It's nice that, like, there is no gas to be paid. It's very little gas to be paid on Solana for transactions. So it's just very easy for that retail segment to come in and have fun. And I think, like, this sort of increased activity starts accruing to, like, the network price when, like, funds start looking at where the new marginal user is coming in, and you can see that manifest in the Solana price. Like, the. The bitcoin pair is, like, close to all time highs.
00:16:58.086 - 00:17:23.494, Speaker B: Again, it's up maybe, like, 1020 percent just in the past week alone. Yeah, it definitely, like, it sort of revived the Alt L1 trade, which I thought was at least, like, four or five months ago. I thought was completely dead in my mind. I was like, why should all ones even have this much evaluation if, like, their network effects are so unlindy compared to ETH? But I guess here we are with the sole ETH ratio close to all time highs.
00:17:24.274 - 00:17:56.912, Speaker D: It's interesting the thesis you had there actually is proven to be true, I would say, but that's not reflected in the price. For instance, Solana, it is actually true that no one really uses it. I know TVL is not the best metric, but TVL is under a billion dollars. Of course, TVL is not incredibly important for things like liquidity. I get that side of the argument. But it's not like people are using Solana bridging in and then sending their funds back to Coinbase and taking it off the chain. Like, the fact of the matter is, there just aren't people using Solana that could change in the future.
00:17:56.912 - 00:18:05.998, Speaker D: But that's not where we're at today. So I think you were right in your thesis, but it almost doesn't matter to the market. Like we were saying before, like, the vaporware will still do well.
00:18:06.166 - 00:18:34.334, Speaker A: And for all the attention that, I mean, Solana has gotten so much attention. But ultimately I was looking at like Avax and some of these ones, and they're up even more. Like, you think Solana is like have like a nice three x. Avax was at $8 and then, you know, look at, it's above 40. And this is not a small coin. I mean, this is like another, you know, top, top 15 coin. So just like billions being created in short order there.
00:18:34.334 - 00:18:39.562, Speaker A: Taiki, are you surprised by this alt l one is a trade back?
00:18:39.658 - 00:19:30.612, Speaker C: Yeah, I am surprised. I mean, in 2021, I was beating these, being this alt l one rotator. And when the bear market hit last year and this year, like you said, I thought it was mostly dead. But I think because sentiment has shifted from doomer to just crazy bullishness, I think people are looking like people are willing to bet on growth now and they don't really care about what it is right now. It's more the story and the narrative. And if, you know, like, because when I thought the alto one rotation was dead, I thought it was because, well, in the past two years, since the top happened, ethereum and l two should establish a bigger lead relative to the alto one s. But if you look at where arbitrum optimism is right now, I mean, it really hasn't changed since two years ago.
00:19:30.612 - 00:20:01.854, Speaker C: Zksync the top tv all project is sync swap. It's somewhat embarrassing to this point. And I'm starting to be more open minded to this idea that maybe the next cycle looks exactly the same as a lifecycle where people just want to bet on infrastructure, like layer ones. And it just like, you know, like we talked about, it does become community money. Maybe Ada becomes community money again. Celestia injective all these all ones. What do you guys think about, do you think the altar one trade comes back? Or am I just being bullish at the picotop?
00:20:02.474 - 00:20:39.932, Speaker D: I wanted to show something because, Tyche, I've actually heard your thesis here of, like, ETH should have a bigger lead. Totally agree. But actually. So I was looking at defi llama when I heard you say that first. And while it looks like ETH in the blue here for TVL has been flat, I don't think this is the most fair way to judge it because Tron is at 15%, which I do not count as, like, a legitimate sustainable contender. And if you were to. Maybe this isn't the right way to think about it, but if you were to remove Tron from the equation, Ethereum really has outperformed as far as TVL, attracting liquidity, attracting new applications, attracting developers.
00:20:39.932 - 00:20:47.760, Speaker D: We're just not seeing it reflected in my view, because of this. Like, the Tron Ponzi that's going on, right? Maybe that's the wrong way to think about it.
00:20:47.872 - 00:20:53.168, Speaker A: Oh, Tron Ponzi, like, his excellency, you're out there.
00:20:53.336 - 00:20:55.284, Speaker D: We can cut that out if we need to.
00:20:56.624 - 00:21:03.296, Speaker C: No, no. Justin, did you know that Tron is deflationary every transaction?
00:21:03.360 - 00:21:04.240, Speaker D: Yeah, I take it back.
00:21:04.312 - 00:21:05.724, Speaker C: Turns a little bit of Tron.
00:21:06.584 - 00:21:25.580, Speaker D: I'm sorry, but yeah. What do you guys think about this? Like that? Is this. Are these metrics invalid because of the Tron Ponzi? Like, has Ethereum actually outperformed and really gained more market share? If we take Tron out of the equation, like, I would argue that's the right way to think about it. Of course, price isn't reflecting that, but, yeah, I mean, what do you guys think about this?
00:21:25.692 - 00:21:58.408, Speaker A: Well, for, like, you know, like, serious economic activity with. With large amounts of money, Ethereum is still clearly winning, but during these cycles of speculation. Exactly like what Taiki said, you know, community money starts to become a great casino coin to speculate on. We talked about this with Austin. I think that for Solana, like, the. The meme coin of Solana is not bonk, it is Sol. Like, that is the meme coin, the community coin, which doesn't make any sense financially because there's no cash flows and ever coming.
00:21:58.408 - 00:22:34.694, Speaker A: We don't know, like for the next years. But Anatoly himself says the gas is so cheap, so even if you burn it, it's not going to do anything for the token price. It's a community money, and that's fine. This is an interesting new primitive that we are discovering in crypto, and it is a very interesting thing to go down that rabbit hole Solana community is very strong. The meme coin Sol does very well. And we're seeing that with some of the other ecosystems as well, where these coins are detached from a cash flow standpoint.
00:22:34.994 - 00:23:52.556, Speaker B: My take on this is I sort of echo there's this factor in tradfi, which has been studied for a few decades called betting against beta, where high beta stocks typically will have a really large premium relative to lower beta stocks, partly because there's a distortion where you get access, certain funds get access to higher leverage through these high beta stocks. So actually looking like they have more leverage because they're not, like, if you can go like 50% long, this weird esoteric stock versus 200% long s and p, the 200% long s and P might violate some mandates or something. So it creates a distortion in that there's a premium for these sort of lottery ticket stocks. And a strategy that has worked persistently is just shorting the high beta stocks and then going long the lower beta ones. I think Aqr famously wrote a paper on this, and I think this is very echoey of the sentiment in altcoins, where a lot of these altcoins, because they have a higher potential of three, four x rather than ETH, they're higher beta, and they get a premium during times like this, where there's a lot of froth and there's a lot of inflows into the capital markets. But, yeah, that's my take on it. You can see this sort of relic also.
00:23:52.556 - 00:24:10.908, Speaker B: And if you, if you plot iwm versus spy, but, like, the plot here, like, almost perfectly mirrors what the altcoin versus BTC charts look like. So I think that's an interesting artifact of, like, human behavior in markets that, like, is reflected here, why all these alta ones are getting a huge bid relative to ETH.
00:24:11.036 - 00:25:01.802, Speaker C: I also feel like, I mean, this might be like an east versus westing, where people just say Tron is a scam, or like, maybe this is from the ethereum community as well. But if you actually think about the use case of Tron, it's moving stable coins around, right? And if you ever worked a job and you're getting paid from a crypto company, chances are you're being paid tether on the tron network. And Tron is actually deflationary, which is kind of crazy because they burn part of the transaction fees, and you know, like, most of the tron is already circulating. I'm not long Tron. Okay. Like, I'm not saying that, like, this is a good buy or something, but I feel like the sentiment around anything that's not ethereum, like l one s with little users, is a scam. I feel like that's also kind of this echo chamber that people often fall into the trap to on crypto, Twitter.
00:25:01.802 - 00:25:11.590, Speaker C: And sometimes what you see on social media is not actually reality. And I think that's also something that people should consider when thinking about Eid versus Elwyn's and whatnot.
00:25:11.742 - 00:25:34.078, Speaker A: Cool. Well, I mean, I think overall, I don't. I don't. I don't mean to be like the, you know, the bear in the room, although it is a little bit my de facto role. I do see elements of what we were seeing during, like, the NFT mania with some of this, like, wealth effect stuff. Right now, there's a lot of new coins, and I think that can only go so far. It's like, first principles.
00:25:34.078 - 00:26:27.354, Speaker A: You can't just keep having new coins sustain environments and wealth effects because all you're doing is, like, looping leverage and just like, the leverage is getting stacked, leverage is very high right now. So because there is an inflow of users that's sustainable for the time being, but I'm not sure for how many weeks that will continue to be the case. Hopefully it's going to be quite a bit longer. But, you know, I'm a little bit worried because it's so hard to short things when they can rip so hard. And the thing to keep in mind is the harder it is to short something, the less attached to its fair price. It's going to be sort of, by definition, because there's just people buying and then no one's willing to take the other side of it because they don't want to get blown up, blown out and get liquidated. So there's nobody kind of keeping any kind of check on prices.
00:26:27.354 - 00:26:38.694, Speaker A: And that's really the most dangerous time to participate on some of these, let's call them questionable investment tokens.
00:26:39.594 - 00:26:45.814, Speaker C: Yeah. I'm curious, though, Jordy and Justin and Thiki, what do you guys think about the alto one thesis?
00:26:47.514 - 00:27:14.314, Speaker B: I think there hasn't been much innovation in the last two years, since 21. There's just too much capital looking for somewhere to put it on the sidelines. So it just makes sense to run back the old stuff. But I don't think. I don't know. I mean, I think I'm really excited to short next year or maybe 2025. I'm actually really looking forward to that because I think it'll be.
00:27:14.314 - 00:27:22.098, Speaker B: I'm longing right now. It's been good, but I'm really looking forward to shorting stuff because it just can't sustain here, I don't think.
00:27:22.226 - 00:27:52.800, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm curious, like, where do you, where do you see the FTV ceiling? This is FTD ceiling. So the last cycle it was pretty obvious that like nothing could hit 100 billion. Like Dogecoin go to like 80 and like Ada went to 80 and like, but everything, like, as soon as you start to reach that, I think some people were just like, okay, this is, this is getting out of hand. And like, nothing could break that. It was like, it was a comfortable short at 100 billion. And then during the bear market, I think that number was like 1010 billion. Like nothing could really kind of like arbitrarium.
00:27:52.800 - 00:28:13.344, Speaker A: Like nothing could really crack, crack that 10 billion. But now we're seeing like the celestias and the world coins, you know, they're, they're kind of cracking through that 10 billion. It's hard for me to imagine we go back to the 100 billion sort of limit. But is there a number of thinking that you have in mind for where you see something, you're like, okay, like, this just, it's not going to sustain.
00:28:13.924 - 00:28:42.394, Speaker B: I think. I mean, I think using round numbers for, like, market cap and FTV is probably going to be like a lot higher signal in the bull than in the bear. And same with, like ta and chart patterns and trend lines. Like, all these things come back when, you know, we're so debased from fundamentals. So I do think, like, I don't know, my world coins at 25 billion right now, so I don't think anything's breached 50 yet. So we'll see if 50 is it and if not 50, then maybe 100. Yeah, we'll see.
00:28:42.514 - 00:28:58.134, Speaker A: Yeah, I would say, like, the larger ones, like XRP and BNB have been relatively mild. So, yeah, nothing, nothing has really started to go back towards that. How many digits is that? Like the twelve digit mark? Nothing. Nothing's.
00:28:59.954 - 00:29:00.426, Speaker D: It's.
00:29:00.490 - 00:29:12.296, Speaker B: I mean, it's harder now because back then, like, the circulating supply of all these bigger coins was like, much, much lower. It's like maybe half of what it is now. So it'll be a lot difficult to send it up to 100 B FTV now, at least for the older stuff.
00:29:12.440 - 00:29:52.564, Speaker A: Correct, I agree. And I think that's why a lot of the alto one, promoters that think that they will break all time highs might have a harder time than they think because the circulating supply is a lot higher. So the per coin, like, just think about something like this. Some of these coins have 10% staking rewards. So the price of the coin now compared to three years ago is already also, like, reflecting, you know, like a 30% additional kind of dilution that's been happening just from staking rewards. Yeah, I'm less bullish that we'll. We'll be seeing a lot of all time highs on things like avalanche and Solana anytime soon.
00:29:52.904 - 00:30:19.194, Speaker D: Jordy, on the Solana note, I mean, you famously convinced me not to go all in on Solana at the exact bottom because of foundation selling. I'm just teasing you. But, I mean, there is, like, what, what about all that sell pressure that you hypothesized would be coming from this? A lot of foundation have. Has retail just, like, eclipsed all of that sell pressure? Have they not started selling yet? Like, what's your thought process there?
00:30:19.734 - 00:30:51.450, Speaker A: Obviously, the. The timing of how things have been sold worked out really well for. For. For the FTX tokens and everything else. It has been an amazing amount of kind of perfect timing for Sol as a token. I think, one, there's been a need for an altcoin, and it is still the de facto kind of showing point of what is another coin that's not ethereum and bitcoin. And it just has that number three role.
00:30:51.450 - 00:31:30.950, Speaker A: The market really has been demanding for an altcoin and kind of, like, perfectly tied in there. I think they had a very good Solana conference with fire dancer being released and some of the kind of fundamental improvements there. Then you have all these tokens come on live like, pith did an incredible job. I'm more bullish the ecosystem stuff than anything else. I mean, it's really incredible on the SPL side. What a change, right? Like, from rollbit six months ago, where rollbit went from SPL to ERC 20, and then, like, you know, ten x in price, and people were like, okay, you just don't do spls. Like, that's not.
00:31:30.950 - 00:31:47.864, Speaker A: That's not the way to go. And now it's the exact opposite. Everyone's, like, trying to do an SPL, so they're going to switch back. Yeah. And, you know, when it comes to community money, they also have another thing going for them, which is there's a. There's like, a narrative, there's a story. Like, they've been through a lot.
00:31:47.864 - 00:32:28.436, Speaker A: Like that community has been through a lot. They're resilient, and the resilience brings together the community money, and that's something that is really important. Like, people underestimate stories, but the reason why bitcoin is so sustainable through the years is literally just the story of the creation of, like, Satoshi and, like, you know, that the fair launch and everything else. So incredible stuff, you know, happy for everybody in the Solana builder community. They're getting finally, like, you know, what they deserve, which is like, a good look and a good attention and even some TVL bridging over. But, yeah, we'll see. I mean, ultimately, I think there is some clouds.
00:32:28.436 - 00:32:55.904, Speaker A: At some point there will be. You know, my, my only criticism of Solana has never been about the community or the technology is literally the, the tokenomics and the VC holding. And I think if you look at it, it's not good. Like, March 2025, there is like a gigantic amount being released, and that's only like a year and a bit away from now. So, yeah, these, these unlocks hopefully don't crush the community. I'm hoping for the best.
00:32:56.484 - 00:33:32.060, Speaker B: If I were to, if I were to steal. Man, my, my short thesis on alts, at least in 2024, it's just like the stablecoin market cap. It's been up like 5 billion since, I guess, the Pico bottom. And we peaked at around 170 at the peak of the bull market. So there still is a lot of room to go on the stable coin side. And liquidity is so thin that not much can move these prices. On the Solana front, I'm so impressed that they managed to chew through rents.
00:33:32.060 - 00:34:01.374, Speaker B: They FTX estate has sold like $800 million of Solana. They're like three fourths done with their unlocked tokens, which is kind of insane. I think we could see maybe a brief pump after they finish selling their unlocked tokens, maybe up to 100 or something, and then we'll see from there. But if I were to steal, man, it would be that there's, there's still a lot more room to go.
00:34:02.474 - 00:34:37.744, Speaker D: I also think, I mean, this is just a great outcome for the overall industry that FTX creditors. I mean, this is going to be a big piece of making them whole, from what I understand, which I think is, is just great for everybody. I did have a question about this, though, thicky. This includes UsT, I assume. Yes, so it is. I feel like in some ways, it'd be more helpful to remove that because all of that UST about, was it 20 to 40 billion, 25 billion or something like that couldn't be used to buy anything because you could never like get that the UST out but so like maybe we really are higher than we think here regarding stable coin market cap.
00:34:37.904 - 00:34:41.164, Speaker B: Wait, why is 2020 5 billion frozen?
00:34:41.904 - 00:34:44.084, Speaker D: Well ust went to zero, so.
00:34:44.904 - 00:34:47.768, Speaker B: Oh, us. No, Terra. Got it, got it.
00:34:47.896 - 00:34:48.184, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:48.224 - 00:34:53.424, Speaker B: Oh, actually I don't know if it includes terror or not. Um, I'll have to figure this out.
00:34:53.464 - 00:34:57.856, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, maybe like from June 14.
00:34:57.880 - 00:35:00.120, Speaker B: To June 21 it went down like ten.
00:35:00.312 - 00:35:33.522, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah maybe it does. Yeah, it was like 18 I think it wasn't 20, it was like 1718. That could be it. So yeah, it looks, it looks like we, we still have some way to go on the stable coin side. I do want to fit in one segment before we go to our pause of the week segment. So we want to do another meet the lads segment and we had a really nice one with Thicky. I think this time we will do Justin.
00:35:33.522 - 00:35:36.894, Speaker A: So Justin, if you're up for it, we will meet you today.
00:35:37.554 - 00:35:39.814, Speaker D: Let's do it. Grill me. I'm here.
00:35:40.794 - 00:35:49.324, Speaker B: Yeah. So how did you get started in crypto, Justin? Because like, as far as I'm aware, like, you had sort of like a non traditional background.
00:35:49.944 - 00:36:19.146, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, sure. I'll give my, my speech here. So I was a film major in undergrad, so, very untraditional. I went to Boston University and moved out to Los Angeles as soon as I graduated. Started working in the entertainment industry. I worked on the cooking show Hell's Kitchen with Gordon Ramsay and then worked on Family Guide, that animated show with Seth Macfarlane and the entertainment industry. For anyone listening that works in it or is that thinking about it, you have to put a lot of time in fetching coffee.
00:36:19.146 - 00:36:55.884, Speaker D: I mean, that's sort of the stereotype, but it's just crappy work and I have, I'm just not a good employee, I don't think, generally. So I was just very bad at doing this and I realized, like, I wasn't going to be able to sustain myself. Family guy, spend ten years there, like picking up lunch until I, like, finally got a position I wanted or anywhere in the industry. And so I wanted to find a way to fast track that. So I decided to get my mba from the University of Southern California here in Los Angeles. And for me, this sort of, like, changed me pretty deeply as a person. And I'd recommend an MBA for folks that are sort of like lost or don't know what they want to do with their life.
00:36:55.884 - 00:37:27.724, Speaker D: I was always sort of a slacker. And this sort of corrected that. So while I was there, I worked at par Paramount Pictures and strategy and Biz Dev, which was amazing. Like, we were looking at some stuff in blockchain, a lot of AR VR stuff. It was very cool, very experimental, and ended up moving over to Snapchat, which is also based here in Los Angeles. And this was sort of my first exploration to the tech scene. And I was very lucky because when COVID was breaking out, I became close with someone that was starting a business in the crypto space in Defi.
00:37:27.724 - 00:37:58.516, Speaker D: At the time, I never purchased a coin, didn't think it was all a scam, but had no interest in learning more. And this person was an amazing figure and onboarding me into crypto, showing me what metamask is, what you can do with ethereum, etcetera, etcetera, fell in love with the space, started making YouTube videos, found myself as head of growth at Ondo, and then I met my co founder, Joe DeLong, and we had the opportunity to fundraise, to build Astaria. And so that's how I got brought here.
00:37:58.660 - 00:38:23.984, Speaker C: So, Justin, I think it's pretty clear that you love ETH and you hold the majority of your portfolio. Neet, what's it going to take for you to, I guess, buy more app tokens or other lt o ones with a longer term time horizon? What will be the checkboxes that you need to see in order for you to just not be all in need with your crypto portfolio?
00:38:24.574 - 00:38:45.350, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, I want to cap, like, I'm happy to criticize ETH. I don't like the Ethereum scaling roadmap. I'm like, very impressed with some of the other tech that's being built that's not on Ethereum. For me, it just seems like the perfect asset for a few reasons. On the risk curve. One, I think BTC, like, the returns are just too muted.
00:38:45.350 - 00:39:36.654, Speaker D: Now, there's this theory that bitcoin's one cycle ahead of ETH. And so I think, like, if you want to be conservative and hold an asset that, you know, with pretty good confidence, will be here in ten years, but won't sort of like underperform the broader market and any innovation and development that we see, like, the answer is pretty clear to hold ETH. Like, it's possible Solana is not around in five years. I don't think you could say the same about ETH. And then as far as like holding defi coins, other alt l ones, like, for me, the risky stuff is usually like angel checks that I like to write to support other founders. Like, one of the nice things about being in this space and like having a podcast or having a project or just like living and breathing this space is you meet amazing people. Some of the smartest people I've ever met are in crypto and, like, having the opportunity to invest with them and like, see if you can help them in any way is super rewarding.
00:39:36.654 - 00:40:04.336, Speaker D: So I sort of, I guess maybe I have my own barbell. I have ETH is like the conservative investment and then I have the angel investments on the far end of the spectrum. I definitely will play around. Like, if we get another bull market like we saw with DeFi Summer in 2021, I will be farming stuff, I will be speculating here and there. But I don't think my core position is going to change materially from ETH, like, for the foreseeable future, unless something pretty significant changes.
00:40:04.520 - 00:40:27.294, Speaker A: Justin, you went from getting coffee in the entertainment industry to being a CEO. Do you feel like you have an easy time being a CEO? Like, I know CEO's have to do people management and strategy and external and internal and operations. Is there something that you find harder out of all of those tasks?
00:40:27.794 - 00:41:09.150, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of harder things about it and there's a lot of easier things about it. So it's a lot harder emotionally, because if you're as an employee at a startup that is successful or unsuccessful, it's still an amazing thing on your resume. And so you're always still progressing your career. But if you're the founder of a startup or a very early employee, you're actually betting a lot of your future on that. If you have a founder that fails, it's a much worse look, in my opinion, than being an employee at a company that goes under. That's just how it is. Having that responsibility and sort of like feeling you're bearing the burden of the company's success or failure is like very challenging.
00:41:09.150 - 00:41:48.284, Speaker D: And it means that this is basically all you're going to think about 24/7 like, while you're doing it, there's really nothing else you're going to think about or focus on mentally. Like, you go to bed at night and all you're thinking about is like, things that went right or things that went wrong and how you can improve it. But there's some easy things, too, or easier things, especially in the crypto space. If you're working with engineers in the crypto space, they live and breathe and love this industry as much as we do. And they are, like, so personally motivated that everyone here is here for passion. And obviously those are going to be the best people to have on your team. And they're really smart, too, so you learn a lot from them.
00:41:48.284 - 00:41:54.324, Speaker D: There's some hard things, some easy things, but I'm really grateful, and it's an awesome opportunity.
00:41:56.384 - 00:41:59.644, Speaker B: Favorite and your least favorite thing about the crypto industry?
00:42:00.024 - 00:42:16.736, Speaker D: So my favorite thing is, I guess, twofold. One is it's super international, and the people are very. They're different thinkers. Like, going to a conference, you meet some wacky people. You meet people from all over the world. I mean, we're all spread out. Like Jordyn Thicke.
00:42:16.736 - 00:43:06.146, Speaker D: You guys are always traveling, always in a new city, and it just feels cool that, like, wherever you go as a crypto person, there's someone you can meet, like, whatever city internationally you're going to. And the people here are, like, very wacky and out there, but also really smart, so they think untraditionally, which is really cool. So that's the best thing and the worst thing, I think we all probably feel this, is that it's just a lot of vaporware. I mean, we've been talking about this for, like, the past hour, right? It's like the. Because the token can launch before product market fit is achieved, we have this, like, really weird incentive that we don't have with equities because there's a lot of regulation there that, like, a founder founders can exit before anything is actually done. Cardano is a perfect example here. Like, everyone that was early made millions or billions of dollars even in some.
00:43:06.146 - 00:43:21.328, Speaker D: In some cases, and they've never actually delivered anything. And that's, like, pretty demoralizing. And I think it's also, like, a really bad look for our industry in that the incentives are just so misaligned. So I would say, like, the misaligned incentives and ability for scammers to thrive.
00:43:21.506 - 00:43:42.424, Speaker A: And do you have, like, a plan to try to hit a certain, like, number and then you're gonna retire? Or, like, you know, a lot of people in the crypto space have. Have that approach, you know, I'm gonna get here and then. And then I'm done. Or are you kind of, like, the compulsive, you know, we're just gonna keep working forever and just keep. Keep building?
00:43:43.124 - 00:44:04.902, Speaker D: I. There's no number, and I would never, like, fully retire because I couldn't imagine, like, what you would even do after the first day. Like, imagine. Imagine you made a billion dollars and you're like, okay, I'm never working or doing anything again. What the heck are you going to do tomorrow? Like, you're going to maybe spend time on a boat. I would get bored of that after a few hours. You're going to travel? Okay, like, I've done that.
00:44:04.902 - 00:44:47.174, Speaker D: How long are you going to travel for? Are you just going to then pay your friends and family to not do anything and spend time with you, and then are you guys just going to be sitting around? So I think I always want to be doing something, but I think the scope of that could change, like, in ten years if crypto goes to zero, like, I'm still going to be doing something else. If crypto is doing really well, I'd love to stay and build in this industry, but I think if you love what you're doing and you have some decent skill sets, like, you never want to retire fully. You always want to be working and trying to achieve something, whether that's philanthropic, you're running a charity, something as simple as, like, owning a bookstore, owning a coffee shop. I think there's a lot of fulfillment with that.
00:44:47.514 - 00:44:58.214, Speaker B: Do you think there's, like, a particular thing in your childhood or something about the way you are that, like, drew you to the degeneracy of the crypto world?
00:45:00.234 - 00:45:30.676, Speaker D: I think that. I think I've just always had, I think there's, like, people in crypto maybe are, like, more predisposed to ADHD. I don't know if I actually have ADhd or not. But, like, there's this. It's really nice that, like, the, like, the response windows for, like, bill actually, thickie, you talked about this, and it was really insightful. Many podcasts ago, you were saying, like, it's really cool being a trader. You love doing that because you get confirmation on if you're right within like a day or a week or something like that.
00:45:30.676 - 00:45:54.790, Speaker D: It's very fast paced. Obviously, as a builder, it's slower, but, like, still in the cryptocurrency industry, you're going to get the fastest, basically response from the market on if your thesis is right, whether it's from an investment standpoint or from a building standpoint. And I think that is really attractive to me. And that, like, we're not in a legacy industry. We are in the cutting edge. And, like, we don't know if crypto will work. It's possible in 20 years.
00:45:54.790 - 00:46:12.382, Speaker D: It's not a thing. But, like, if you want to be successful, I feel like, and if you want to have, like, a leveraged bet on your life, you have to do something that's not fully priced in. Like, it's not priced in that crypto succeeds, there's uncertainty. And that's where I think like all of the alpha is. Isn't that like we're in a risky industry?
00:46:12.558 - 00:46:36.378, Speaker A: That's true. I mean, I will just point out that not only does crypto attract people with ADHD, if you don't have ADHD and you go into crypto, that was me, I don't think I ever had it. Definitely developed it so much to keep up with that, you know, it's like an immune response. You become an ADHD person so you can even cope.
00:46:36.506 - 00:46:51.618, Speaker D: Well, it's like the narrative switch could switch on in two weeks, right. Like the narrative for the past two weeks is Solana. Right. But the next two weeks it's probably going to be something different. And if you can't like pivot and move quickly, you're, you're just not going to make it. If you're an active trader or builder.
00:46:51.786 - 00:47:04.574, Speaker B: You should have seen. So when I visited Jordy a couple weeks ago in Singapore, like, we were having a conversation every like five minutes, he would like turn, pull up his training turbo. Click, click, click, click, click. And come back and continue the conversation.
00:47:06.354 - 00:47:29.466, Speaker A: Yeah, it's ruined me, man. Like, I used to be like this like chess player, you know, I could sit for an hour and just think about a move. And now, like, I need, like, I need the podcast at two X. I gotta like multitask with charge app. Oh, man, it's beautiful. Bad. I've seen even worse than me, I think I did a Twitter spaces with Primo from Layer Zero.
00:47:29.466 - 00:47:43.962, Speaker A: And at the same time as like he was actually like talking and going into conversation. I could see him like in all these chats. I'm with him on Telegram. He was just like responding to all these other people and text while he's talking. It's like, oh, man, primo is next level.
00:47:44.058 - 00:47:55.762, Speaker D: So you, it's going to be a top signal when we're all basically like playing a video game or like typing in Telegram on the podcast and like all talking to each other and typing just like SPF was like right before his downfall.
00:47:55.858 - 00:48:00.458, Speaker A: Yeah. At least hopefully we'll be better at League of Legends if we're even if we're multitasking than he was.
00:48:00.506 - 00:48:18.874, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I mean, I spent so much of my time nowadays, I'm literally just like in bed trading all day, just like really degenerate. But I could see a future where it's just like, you know, you have, like, an iv hooked up. You have, like, something, and, like, you're just there all the time, constantly processing.
00:48:18.914 - 00:48:31.304, Speaker A: Information, just getting, like, adrenaline dripping through, like, oh, man, that's funny. This is. This is the world that we are. We're marching towards.
00:48:31.804 - 00:48:52.220, Speaker B: I can see Tyche, like, laughing in the background. There's muted Mike, but, yeah. Justin, if you had one message, I guess, for anyone that is in the crypto industry and trying to, like, build their own project, but, like, hasn't yet, what would you tell them if they're.
00:48:52.372 - 00:49:15.314, Speaker D: So. They're trying to fundraise, they're trying to build something. Start from something from scratch, I would say one you need. And this is advice for a non technical person, because I'm not an engineer, and I think being a founder, as a not engineer, you. You obviously need to have, like, an amazing technical co founder that you vibe with. And you should really think of it like a marriage because. Or even more strict than a marriage because it's much harder.
00:49:15.314 - 00:49:45.626, Speaker D: I think it might be much harder to separate. So work with someone that you work really well with, be willing to try everything. And I think doing something zero to one is more interesting. In our industry, there's a lot of iteration forks, slap a new UI on it, launch a new token, and let's give it a go. And one, you're not really doing anything useful. You might make money, but it's not that useful or probably fulfilling. So try to do something new, and if you don't have an idea right now, that's fine.
00:49:45.626 - 00:50:07.774, Speaker D: Play around, try everything in the crypto space, and surely you'll think of something, because there's so many inefficiencies and not just, like, from a financial perspective, from a security perspective, from a wallet perspective, all of those things. Bug bounties, audits, like, all of these things need a ton of work. And it really is like the first inning as far as this stuff goes. And there's a lot of opportunity out there.
00:50:08.454 - 00:50:12.670, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. Well, thank you for letting us meet you, Justin.
00:50:12.862 - 00:50:14.874, Speaker D: Thanks for meeting me.
00:50:16.334 - 00:50:42.894, Speaker A: Yeah, Justin, maybe thanks for letting us meet. Meet the lad Justin, today. And let's see if you can actually win pasta of the week as well. Do, like, a back to back and maybe break that macaroni ceiling. I will say that I'm starting to see more people on Twitter tag either me or the lads in general for pass of the week. So please keep doing this. We love this, and we're actually, like, my choice of the week is something that I got tagged into.
00:50:42.894 - 00:51:10.890, Speaker A: So we can bring this up and thank you to our listener, Baz. So this is a great pasta. You know, the context, obviously, is, you know, blast and all these, like, blur all these things with points where you're. You're farm, dropping points, you're not even getting a token. You're just getting points. And this is an epic pasta. So the guy says, my girls mean giving me sex points instead of actually having sex with me.
00:51:10.890 - 00:51:28.366, Speaker A: Recently, I have to do things like wash the dishes and give her foot massages to earn extra points. She keeps promising that real sex is going to get airdropped soon. I can't wait. So this is. This is the stuff that I love to see, you know, how are you.
00:51:28.390 - 00:51:34.154, Speaker D: Going to tell me I have a chance of winning pasta of the week and you pull this beauty out? Jordy, I don't know if I can top that.
00:51:35.654 - 00:51:41.430, Speaker A: I mean, I have to thank mister old school here for bringing this up.
00:51:41.462 - 00:51:47.434, Speaker D: But mister old school, tag me directly next, I will feature you because I never have a good pasta.
00:51:47.974 - 00:51:56.644, Speaker A: Yeah, give Justin a chance. Next night, you might have. You might have. Come on, get my way. We'll see. Taiki, how about you? Do you have a good one this week?
00:51:56.764 - 00:52:19.448, Speaker C: Yeah. So for my past of the week, I think, you know, we all have bear market PTSD, right? We see markets go up and our first reaction is, oh, my God. Like, it has to come down. But I do want to bring this dj's partner from February 1, 2021, where, you know, it says the normies are coming. Dump on them. Wait, but if you dump on them now, you won't have any coins left. Don't dump on them.
00:52:19.448 - 00:52:47.628, Speaker C: But if you don't dump, how do you profit? Dump on them slowly. I've been farming a bunch of stuff, for example, on base chain, and I have to remind myself, okay, I have to dump on people slowly. And I think that people have to start thinking about, okay, let's be more opportunistic. The markets just. We've endured two years of pain. I think the next two years are probably going to be better. And I think, yeah, just long and strong.
00:52:47.628 - 00:52:53.156, Speaker C: Be bullish. Don't take on too much risk. But, yeah, that's kind of my pasta and some, I guess, general advice.
00:52:53.300 - 00:53:09.304, Speaker A: Yeah, I think TJ and Spartan is always, you know, kind of tongue in cheek, but saying it, saying this, saying the unspoken thing out loud. Thicky. How about you? What's. What's your pasa this week?
00:53:09.904 - 00:53:36.364, Speaker B: This is mine. These are charts, are just like test scores decreasing across the years, which is an interesting phenomenon. I actually don't know why this is happening. If you guys have any theories, but this guy says, how can you look at this chart and be bearish altcoins? Which is very indicative of the sentiment right now because some of the most, some of the dumbest stuff is pumping right now. A lot of AI vapor, a lot of just complete dead coins. Garbage. FTT is up 300% on the year.
00:53:36.364 - 00:53:45.146, Speaker B: But, yeah, I think, I think this is a good thesis for why you should be looking for, like, the most toxic stuff and trying to long end to the end of the year.
00:53:45.290 - 00:53:47.850, Speaker D: That's just grim, though. This is just grim.
00:53:48.002 - 00:53:49.974, Speaker B: For sure. For sure, it is grim.
00:53:51.674 - 00:54:04.214, Speaker A: Do you have a sense of which of these skills matter the most? Is it being bad at math? Is it like not being able to read? Or is it like not having any scientific basis?
00:54:04.674 - 00:54:07.134, Speaker B: I think it's all three, to be honest with you.
00:54:10.674 - 00:54:15.810, Speaker A: All right, so this is the one you've chosen. This is your contender. This is your, your horse in the race.
00:54:15.922 - 00:54:19.370, Speaker B: This is my horse in the race. I won't pick. I'll shave that one for next week or something.
00:54:19.482 - 00:54:28.534, Speaker D: Well, do I get the privilege to do too, as I was featured this week on Meet the lads and I'm like just an underdog here. I feel like I get the right to share two pastas.
00:54:28.984 - 00:54:30.336, Speaker A: All right, let's do two.
00:54:30.480 - 00:54:59.096, Speaker D: So the first one here, I got to shout out my co founder, of course, who's killing it on Twitter always. But Ledger Connect was, there was a compromise this morning. Hopefully all the viewers are Safoo. But Joe says Ledger Connect kit has been compromised. I would recommend never interacting with adapt ever again and honestly, just move on with your life. You're 30 already. Maybe meet a nice woman, settle down, have some kids and start writing enterprise java.
00:54:59.096 - 00:55:16.576, Speaker D: And this really hit home today. I actually just turned 30 as of today. And so for me, this was like, I woke up, Ledger was compromised. And I literally thought this. I was like, what the hell are we doing here? Like, people should not be self custodying. Let's move on. We're going back to the banking system.
00:55:16.576 - 00:55:19.524, Speaker D: So that was my first entry there.
00:55:19.704 - 00:55:22.948, Speaker A: Justin, did you just say you turned 30 today?
00:55:23.076 - 00:55:24.092, Speaker D: That is correct.
00:55:24.228 - 00:55:24.684, Speaker B: Whoa.
00:55:24.764 - 00:55:33.664, Speaker A: Oh, man, oh, man. So I think you're gonna win pasta the week not because of your pastas, but because you slipped that into the, into the conversation.
00:55:34.444 - 00:55:39.624, Speaker D: Just a sympathy vote that I'm spending my birthday on the steady lads pod.
00:55:40.324 - 00:55:44.356, Speaker B: What are the odds that we didn't meet the lads on his 30th birthday. Did you know, Jordan?
00:55:44.380 - 00:55:46.312, Speaker A: That's pretty wild. I did not know.
00:55:46.368 - 00:55:49.224, Speaker B: I did not know stars were aligned.
00:55:49.384 - 00:56:18.234, Speaker D: The second pasta here comes from China. I don't know if you guys have seen this video. It's pretty nuts. But effectively, it looks like there are these seminars happening where chinese grandmas are teaching other, let's say, seniors and elder folks and people that traditionally wouldn't be using crypto, how to onboard onto metamask, how to use finance, how to swap into shitcoins. And this appears to be real. We've seen a few other videos like this go around. You can see a BRC 20 poster on the wall there.
00:56:18.234 - 00:56:30.906, Speaker D: I mean, this is. This is just nuts. Like, this really goes to show, like, maybe what we're seeing in the west is not what's representative of the world, and we should all just be aping in, like, crazy because this is. This is nuts.
00:56:31.090 - 00:56:44.496, Speaker B: I got to give my vote to Justin, not because it's his birthday, but it's because I actually saw that Jonah long tweet, and I just, like. I, like, chuckled to myself in bed before it was featured on the show. So, yeah, I really like that. Hilarious.
00:56:44.560 - 00:56:46.744, Speaker D: Thank you, Vicky. I've got one vote.
00:56:46.864 - 00:57:22.274, Speaker A: Yeah. I think my combination of chinese grandmas and double pasta and 30th birthday, you know, it was slid in very right time during pasta of the week, I think. Justin, congratulations. You're the master chef of the the week. If our listeners, if you guys want Justin to win next time, I think maybe help him out with tagging him on Twitter on some nice pastas and maybe he can go back to back. So hope everyone is doing well, and we'll catch you guys next week.
