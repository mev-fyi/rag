00:00:00.240 - 00:00:29.534, Speaker A: Move on to our closing segment. We're going back to one of the, one of the early favorites, which is pasta of the week. You know, I've been doing pretty good because, you know, I can push it up, I can push it down. I can liquidate you or I can bless you, I can force you to go long and go short. I can select random coins, guys, and I can let them skyrocket, but your portfolio will be bleeding. I am the master of this game, guys. Where'd you get that one, Jordy? Well, you guys probably guess.
00:00:29.534 - 00:00:36.126, Speaker A: The audience can guess. This is my fave. This is Mr. Grachev. Once again, another pasta of the week goes to Mr. Grachev. I think.
00:00:36.126 - 00:00:43.494, Speaker A: I think he's piling on the wins. He's the chef. Done it very well. So, Mr. Grachev, you might be one of our future guests. Hopefully.
