00:00:00.160 - 00:00:03.154, Speaker A: Justin, you've been saying that we don't deserve this bull run.
00:00:03.494 - 00:00:10.902, Speaker B: I feel like we've somewhat deserved it. I feel like we've endured two years of pain. We endured FTX, and now.
00:00:10.998 - 00:00:13.994, Speaker A: But have you learned the lessons? Have we learned the lessons?
00:00:14.934 - 00:00:20.714, Speaker C: It's like the saying, like, every day you stray further from God. That's a bit of that.
00:00:41.854 - 00:01:05.102, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody. We're keeping it extra steady this week. We just saw that our benevolent dictator do Kwon is unfortunately getting extra United States, so we're being extra steady just for his sake. I'm Jordy, the CIO of Salina capital. As usual, we have with us Justin, CEO of Astaria. We have Taiki, the humble farmer and full time researcher now. And we have thiky.
00:01:05.102 - 00:01:13.070, Speaker A: Oh, okay, Thiki looks a little bit different again. I think it's the haircut this time. Did you do something to the hair thickie?
00:01:13.102 - 00:01:13.318, Speaker C: What?
00:01:13.366 - 00:01:14.326, Speaker A: What's going on here?
00:01:14.390 - 00:01:18.474, Speaker D: To celebrate do's extradition, we're going korean style.
00:01:20.814 - 00:01:45.514, Speaker A: So this is Jeff, one of the co founders of SE Network, which we'll get into, and also one of the people who has some very contrarian takes that I think will be pretty exciting to discuss on our show today. Jeff, maybe just give us a quick 60 seconds. What have you built with say, and I know it's a cosmos chain. What can you tell us?
00:01:45.814 - 00:02:01.844, Speaker D: Thank you, guys, for having me on. I've watched both Justin and Taiki's videos. Videos on YouTube. So this is kind of like the Avengers of YouTube. I think fitimatics is maybe the one that at least I'm missing.
00:02:02.744 - 00:02:03.152, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:03.208 - 00:02:54.408, Speaker D: The quick background about myself and our team. My co founder and I were both from San Francisco, born and raised, spent our entire lives there. We met well over a decade ago, worked on a lot of different things together. The impetus for save first came because my co founder, Jay, he had spent almost four years, led a big part of the crypto engineering effort at Robinhood. He was particularly personally impacted with the whole Robinhood GameStop situation. I think it led to a lot of loss of trust in the company, and naturally ended up leading us to diving down the whole Dex rabbit hole. It's like, how can you rebuild a lot of the magic that Robinhood had, but maintain that kind of trust with users? So, at the time we were building a Dex, we looked at all the different places you could build a Dex.
00:02:54.408 - 00:03:35.716, Speaker D: It became pretty clear you can't build a competitive Dex. The problem is far, far more, far deeper than that. You can try, but it will never be as competitive as coinbase, binance, all the household names that we already know. So that's what led us down the whole, the say path. The simple way to think about say is say is only focused on solving one problem. If, say, it's successful, you can build a Dex on chain, fully decentralized, and it will operate nearly exactly the same as any sort of centralized exchange or application. We believe that's the most important problem to solve in crypto.
00:03:35.716 - 00:03:59.972, Speaker D: And I can talk a bit about sort of why that is. In order to solve that, say, it takes the entire layer, one stack, every single part of it, and optimizes every single piece for just that use case. The sort of simple thesis we have is we believe that the core value prop of blockchains is the exchange of digital assets.
00:04:00.068 - 00:04:36.854, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a spicy take that I think we definitely want to dig into as one of the segments, one of the main segments on the show. But first of all, I mean, I guess, like, let's just kind of quickly recap what's been a wild bullish week. I mean, the last seven days, I would say, you know, if you're on left, left curve or right curve, you're doing extremely well. You know, you got, you got your like bitcoin doing really good and you got your Luna classic and bonk and whatever else doing well. Taiki, have you mid curved it with maker and stuff this week? How are you doing?
00:04:37.234 - 00:05:01.444, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm very mid curve, actually. I guess. Fortunately, I don't own any cash, so I'm very exposed. But I am very mid curve with my PE ratios, my buybacks. Market doesn't care. They just want to buy memes. I'm coping, you know, like I have to, I guess, adapt to ever changing environment.
00:05:01.444 - 00:05:18.804, Speaker B: Bitcoin is working on its eight straight green weekly candle, which is insane. The last time that happened was 2017. So like, yeah, the markets are insanely strong and I'm kind of just sitting on my hands hoping that better opportunities will come. And I am right on my thesis.
00:05:19.824 - 00:05:23.600, Speaker E: What came after those eight weeks? Those eight green weeks in 2017?
00:05:23.672 - 00:05:50.422, Speaker B: You said in 2017 there was a run up from $1000 to $3,000. So it's like three x'ed. And then there was a 40% correction. But obviously bitcoin went to other instances of HTTP green weekly candle was 2015 Q four. So historically, it's a good sign for things to come. Of course, things look a little overheated, but I am bullish for 2024. I think it's really hard not to be.
00:05:50.528 - 00:06:00.506, Speaker A: Justin, have you been getting any airdrops? I know you kind of play around different chains. I'm praying for your sake that you somehow got some Jito airdrop on Solana or.
00:06:00.530 - 00:06:29.114, Speaker E: No, no, I don't want to talk about it. You know, I like to say I'm a recovering mid curver, but I don't think I've left to either side yet. I don't think they're going to accept me at the highest iq bands, and it's hard for me to sort of play at the bottom with the meme coin. So right now I just have some ethereum exposure, which I've had, you know, I've been accumulating over the past couple of years, but I'm not buying anymore right now. And then my mantle coins, which we're going, we're going to a dollar with mantle. So excited about that. But yeah, it's been a crazy week.
00:06:29.114 - 00:06:52.320, Speaker E: I agree with Tyke. It feels a little spooky. You know, I've started to hear chatter about crypto in, in person. Now, I was at dinner last night or the night before, and I heard someone saying, like, I can't believe I sold my bitcoin. I had three bitcoin when it was only $3,000 or something like that. So we're starting to hear this. People are, like, more willing to talk about crypto and sort of thinking about it more, which on one hand, it's.
00:06:52.320 - 00:07:05.544, Speaker E: It's refreshing after two years of just no one wanting to talk to you about crypto or blockchain and thinking the industry was dead. But on the other hand, like, silly stuff is going crazy right now. So it's a little concerning that that's.
00:07:05.584 - 00:07:27.532, Speaker D: Actually the, almost the physical manifestation of. There's this meme on Twitter recently that of these millions of airdrop farmers on Zksync trying every Dex for maybe cents on the dollar, and then you have like, maybe three or four, like, manlets on Solana playing around with judo just to get this.
00:07:27.668 - 00:07:34.356, Speaker E: Yeah, I saw if you, like, staked ten soul for just a week, you would now have like a $6,000 airdrop or something like that. Some crazy stats.
00:07:34.460 - 00:07:37.108, Speaker B: Justin bought the phone, but he got no airdrops.
00:07:37.276 - 00:08:10.646, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the judo thing, I would say, like, it's kind of just for the sake of our viewers, you know, it's launched just a while ago as we're recording. It's around 2 billion FTV, which is very close to Lido. So, yeah, that's interesting. And we'll loop back to this at the pass of the week at the end, I'm sure. But Jeff, are you seeing any parallels with Jito and any of the previous launches, or how are you seeing this Jito launch?
00:08:10.710 - 00:09:07.004, Speaker D: Jeff, I've never met the judo team, although I have heard kind of their founder. I think Buffalo on Twitter is excellent. Yeah, I mean, I think from a sort of layman's 30,000 foot view, judo has potential to capture the flashbots sort of a narrative that was very much left on the table because the flashbots still hasn't or may not have plans to create a token. So all of that sort of pent up hype around Mev, there's not really a way for both traders, speculators and users to really express that kind of interest. So I think they have some of those tailwinds. I think there's some similarities to blur launching a token and opensea kind of continuing to refuse to do so. So that's sort of my two cent.
00:09:07.084 - 00:09:10.940, Speaker A: So this is sort of like a vampire attack through token play.
00:09:11.132 - 00:09:12.020, Speaker C: Yeah, more on the.
00:09:12.052 - 00:09:17.412, Speaker D: Maybe more on the narrative side. It's a different chain, so perhaps less user overlap, but. Yeah, that's right.
00:09:17.508 - 00:09:57.204, Speaker A: Yeah. And I mean, we know with Opensea, the reason they weren't doing a token was they were kind of worried about all the regulation, all these things. They were very slow. I think with flashbots, it's probably more idealistic. I know that, you know, we're talking about the wing of, you know, the very hardcore believers of ethereal, you know, fairness and neutrality and these types of things that, you know, they, I heard rumors about the round. I think they did like a billion dollar round with paradigm and some other investors. And they, you know, they were just like, yeah, we might not even make any money, whatever, you know, it's a billion dollars.
00:09:57.204 - 00:10:40.578, Speaker A: And they were also just being very tight and giving allocation. So it was like everybody was getting capped at like a very small amount because they wanted to keep this sort of decentralization thesis even within their own round. So it's an interesting comparison. Do you think. I mean, here's a spicy one. Like, do you think that these sort of like 2 billion ftvs and so bonk is like overtaking Pepe? So that's getting towards 1 billion of a, of an absolute meme vapor coin as well. Do you see these things kind of like, lasting, or are we in this like kind of 2021 is just starting, or do you think it's going to come back?
00:10:40.706 - 00:11:48.044, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's a very common question I get from a lot of our investors, a lot of my friends. I'd say by and large, the bet I'm currently sitting on is that this isn't, we're not seeing the early innings of a bull market, which I think might be a little bit more controversial. The main reason why I don't think this is a real bull market is we haven't seen a real catalyst yet. If you just look at the last cycle, what were the meaningful catalysts was by and large, nfts finally being usable, opening up like a brand new way to get involved. And for a lot of people to speculate, Defi also started to really, really work. And then people were starting to get a lot more involved in 2021, early 2020 to 2020. And then that, coupled with COVID kind of the stimulus, people sitting at home with nothing to do, I think that was like the stars aligning.
00:11:48.044 - 00:12:01.414, Speaker C: What I want to see, to think that this is a real bull market is a meaningful catalyst. So this could be gaming the whole black rock.
00:12:02.354 - 00:12:08.922, Speaker A: Yeah, but you don't think it's like Larry Fink going on CNBC is like the catalyst. You don't think that's sort of like the sign?
00:12:09.058 - 00:12:48.714, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's a. I'd say maybe there's like a 1020 percent chance that the Ethereum ETF is a real catalyst. I think there's the most likely chance is that funds trickle in way slower than people expect into the ETF will happen over the course of a year or two years. But understand, there's also a small chance that this ETF gets announced, gets launched, and every retirement fund kind of opens the gates. So we see that move in a lot faster. But I do think that it's overreacted.
00:12:48.794 - 00:13:06.214, Speaker E: I noticed you skipped over from. We're even past talking about the BTC ETF now. We're now into the ETH ETF. Does that mean more, you think, like, this BTC ETF catalyst has already been priced in for the most part, and we need something else now to kick things off or, you know, what's your thought process for jumping right to ETH now?
00:13:06.714 - 00:13:32.514, Speaker C: I'm using the Ethereum ETF just as more of an example. I think by and large, people tend to overreact, and in traditional finance, things always move slower than we'd expect. I think there's certainly excitement, but it won't be just a sort of waterfall, perhaps, as people expect. But I think there's a chance that I'm completely proven wrong.
00:13:32.554 - 00:14:03.914, Speaker A: There's 1015 percent chance I'll take the other side of that bet. I mean, I'm feeling like this is, this is really kicking off. I know it's eight straight candles. Taiki was telling us green candles in a row now. First time since 2017. And we just saw in Congress yesterday, like, all the Senate hearings and Jamie Dimon, this is a hated rally. And hated rallies can last a lot longer than normal rallies because there's a lot of other people that kind of are sidelined and have to deal with.
00:14:03.914 - 00:14:12.522, Speaker A: There was a lot of crypto hate. So I don't know, that makes me feel like this can kick off a proper cycle.
00:14:12.658 - 00:14:31.924, Speaker C: Yeah. It's almost like the more anti consensus the rally is, the more folks are sidelined, the more opportunity there is to eventually have that capital flow in.
00:14:32.034 - 00:15:20.684, Speaker A: Yeah, I think capital in like pretty strongly. I saw, like over the weekend as we're recording, like on Sunday night with like, you know, the infamous, like CME gaps and stuff, there was a massive gold, but like, just like a huge spike and everybody's like, oh, man, here we go. Like, you know, gold bugs are back and Peter Schiff is gonna start, like, you know, goal posting on Twitter and the thing just got like fully Dalai Lamad, but then, like, it came all the way back. I mean, the reversion was brutal and it just contrasts so heavily with bitcoin that just keeps going that I think that the thesis that this is the better version and the boomers got to update, otherwise it's not going to work out for them. I think that can get traction as well.
00:15:20.844 - 00:15:45.638, Speaker E: I was listening to this great Blockworks podcast last night and they had a very interesting point of like, well, why would you hold gold when you can hold bitcoin? If you want something stable, hold dollars or like, t bills, right. And if you want to take on risk or like, hedge out dollar currency risk, wouldn't you rather hold bitcoin? And of course you're going to have more volatility. But the upsides there with gold, you know, the moves are minuscule. Doesn't really make much sense to me.
00:15:45.686 - 00:16:23.142, Speaker A: Yeah. Although you can take that argument and, like, push it further. And curious to get Jeff's take on this because there was another empire podcast. So thiago infamously, like this week, he's getting a lot of hate on for like, you know, going against the Ethereum religion, but he made a very similar argument saying, like, you know, he took it a step further. He said bitcoin's not going to go up ten x easily. So why would I hold bitcoin? Maybe, like, I should just, like, go into, like, Solana at this point, just kind of, you know, keep going down that risk curve. Maybe that's a vc mindset, just kind of always looking for that ten x.
00:16:23.142 - 00:16:59.864, Speaker A: I think normal people don't necessarily need a ten x. I saw the chart of bitcoin in try, like, turkish lira. I posted this on my twitter and it's been at an all time high for a while now, which is crazy because for us, we're thinking about $69,000 and we're only at like, 45. But a lot of other currencies just get so devalued that if you're in a lot of these countries around the world, everything's fine. You've been at an all time high. But yeah. Jeff, what do you think of Santiago's take of just like, I'm not getting a ten x in bitcoin? Do I just go down the risk curve?
00:17:00.884 - 00:17:49.412, Speaker C: I have my own thoughts on both points that you just said. So first, on Santiago's take, this has actually consistently been discussed in traditional kind of capital markets as well. Like, for all the folks that, like, go on to Bloomberg and talk about sort of what direction the S and P is heading, the interesting psychological sort of effect at play here is if a person goes on air and says, I think Solana has a 20% chance of eclipsing Ethereum, something crazy. If that person is wrong, by and large, everyone forgets. If that person's right, that person is almost credited with kind of taking that generational call. So if you always play the ev. Yeah.
00:17:49.412 - 00:18:05.684, Speaker C: If you actually kind of measure the ev of a statement like that on air, it is so massively weighted to the positive. So that's at least been some of the psychological explanation for this has happened time and time again in normal markets.
00:18:05.844 - 00:18:30.428, Speaker A: I remember Arthur Hayes. There's a somehow ran into this clip of Arthur Hayes on CNBC, like in 2018 or something, and he was talking about how he was very sure that bitcoin is about. Was about to go to presenter is like, are you, you really believe that? You really believe fifty k? And Arthur is like, eh, I don't know. Like, who knows? I just want people to trade. Like, I have a trading platform. I just want people to trade.
00:18:30.476 - 00:18:31.812, Speaker C: I don't actually know.
00:18:31.948 - 00:19:06.816, Speaker A: He couldn't keep the straight face. He couldn't, like, stick to it. I think Santiago is a little bit more like, you know, believes it. I don't think he's just trying to, like, make make a crazy statement for the sake of it. But, you know, on the other hand, if you, if you look at, like, this way of thinking, you always just keep going down the risk curve because you're always like, well, Solana's not going to go to 600 because that would be like, you know, hundreds of billions and didn't even manage to get to that when it was being manipulated last cycle. So, like, maybe I need to go to say the next thing down.
00:19:07.000 - 00:20:04.884, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, your point earlier on sort of bitcoin's value prop increasing relative to currencies devaluing and the lira having some instability. There's a sort of interesting thesis I think a few folks were discussing that I think is at least interesting to think about. It's clear that the value prop of one of the big value props of bitcoin is the store of value. You could argue that the more unstable, different global currencies get, the greater the value prop of bitcoin becomes, relatively. And I think we're very clearly in this broader trend of de globalization. And more and more countries are now starting to take the stance of, you know, what, our people first, our citizens first. Let's close off a bit more.
00:20:04.884 - 00:20:33.062, Speaker C: The sort of pessimistic way to think about it is a lot of managing countries incredibly difficult. It's proven to be really, really hard. By and large, more and more countries, as they de globalize, will find themselves facing a lot more instability in their currency. And thus, bitcoin's value prop increases over time as this continues to be more of a global trend.
00:20:33.158 - 00:21:05.248, Speaker B: Yeah, Mike McDonald had this tweet out where, if you remember El Salvador, they started buying bitcoin and they were instantly underwater. And people kind of thought of, you know, I guess El Salvador is a joke, but now they're in the green, right? Like, so imagine if El Salvador starts to just improve their entire economy through their bitcoin purchases. You can see a nationwide, like a worldwide FOMo of maybe other third world countries with weak currencies. Just adopt the bitcoin standard. And that alone can, you know, be a really strong narrative.
00:21:05.376 - 00:21:45.396, Speaker E: Even if that does happen, do we not still agree that, like, Solana, Cardano, Ethereum, like, all of these smaller cap assets will outperform? Like, it's sort of hard for me to imagine that BTC ends up just leaving the rest of the market behind in perpetuity and these other assets don't catch up. And so I definitely resonate with this statement of, like, I feel this holding ETH. Like, why am I holding ETH? I could have bought Solana between ten to $20. I had, like, a six month year long period to do it. We sort of knew that it would outperform ETH if we ever get a bull market again. And so, like, I've definitely been feeling a lot of that fomo or sort of like, wishing I was on the other side of things. Like, Cardano has not broken out yet.
00:21:45.396 - 00:21:46.692, Speaker E: It should outperform.
00:21:46.868 - 00:22:19.136, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know that those things will outperform. It looks like the market loves the new coins and it really likes the new coins. I mean, we're looking at, like, Celestia just saying, right? Like, it's in the tens of billions of FTV now across that 10 billion mark. And we're talking about a data availability layer. It's not like you're on Celestia doing stuff. It's being used by other chains, maybe, and it's also very cheap, so it's not costing that much, people.
00:22:19.136 - 00:22:30.332, Speaker A: Just like the new coins, it looks like. And we saw that as we talked about with Jitto. Yeah. I don't know if the Cardanos are going to be the winners this time.
00:22:30.448 - 00:22:36.892, Speaker E: You would agree that from, like, cycle low to top, Cardano should outperform ETH, right? Or you would expect that or.
00:22:36.908 - 00:23:00.636, Speaker A: No, I mean, those things already have tens of billions of market cap, right? So I don't think it can get to hundreds of billions. I mean, didn't get there last cycle. I can't see it, you know, getting there. It's. It concentrates too much wealth in a couple people's hands in this case, you know, your favorite hash consent. We're still waiting for hash consent to. To respond to.
00:23:00.700 - 00:23:00.876, Speaker C: To.
00:23:00.900 - 00:23:13.396, Speaker A: Come on, steady, lads. But, yeah, I mean, at that point, he would just be, you know, dumping billions to. To buy new farmland, to plant some stuff.
00:23:13.500 - 00:23:45.614, Speaker E: This is actually, like, one of the worst things I think about our space is, like, if you really think about it, like, Cardano is a great example. Everyone on the founding team, like, they've already had their liquidity event, and it's almost sort of, like, bearish for them to try to execute because they could fail, right? So, like, if you guys remember, Cardano was going, like, crazy up until they launched smart contracts. But then the smart contracts, from what I understand, sort of like, pseudo failed. No one was using them. They didn't really work. They were running on this old standard, and the price just tanked from there. So it's actually, like, bad for carbon holders.
00:23:45.614 - 00:24:04.356, Speaker E: And for the team, I think if they actually start trying to execute and stumble and, you know, most people fail, that's normal. So there's this weird misaligned incentive where in crypto you have your liquidity event immediately, the token can trade really well just on memetics alone. And so there's no incentive to deliver, which is really weird, I think, about our space.
00:24:04.460 - 00:24:53.790, Speaker B: I think as our industry grows more, I think that should change, right? I mean, maybe Cardano just becomes a relic of the past cycle, and in 2024, 2025, it's like the new coins that get people excited, it's the new applications. And I know Jeff said that there's not anything new that's been built right now. And that's one of the reasons that he doesn't believe that we're going to see a sustainable bull market. But you can also argue that most of the primitives have already been made because in 2020 we didn't have Defi. In 2021, we don't really have nfts. And it was this new thing, and now there can be products that build on top of it, whether it be gaming or better types of Defi products. And maybe the ETF legitimizes the majors, bitcoin and ether.
00:24:53.790 - 00:25:09.438, Speaker B: And then we see a trickle down of capital that go into DeFi assets that tradfi can kind of get their heads around. Isn't that enough to create a new bull market? What do you guys think about that type of more institutional adoption?
00:25:09.566 - 00:25:52.350, Speaker A: I think it's enough, but I understand what Jeff is saying. And we saw last cycle there was this huge problem with like the teams that were doing nfts because you get the mint, you get all the money upfront. Like the vast majority of, you know, is just, you just get it immediately and then they just don't do anything. You know, they're not motivated. They try. Some of them tried, you know, they made some game, whatever, and then they just, you know, they're not motivated, they give up. So it's, it's kind of interesting that, you know, you want to keep people motivated and, and fighting and fighting for attention, right? Like, how do you guys say, like, manage to fight for attention with, you know, Suya? Like there's so many blockchains, so many even cosmos.
00:25:52.350 - 00:26:04.054, Speaker A: L1 s, there's, there's so many l two s. How do you, like, fight that war? Have you just decided, like, you're gonna focus on a couple things and get really, really good at them?
00:26:04.214 - 00:26:39.564, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, no, I think that's a that's a really important question. Like, there's a lot of really brilliant, very, very well researched sort of teams that struggle to stay relevant. I would distill it down to two key points. The first is keeping things simple. I think consistently, really good teams get this one wrong. You may have this level of excitement for what you're building. The sort of technical innovation that you're working on.
00:26:39.564 - 00:27:11.008, Speaker C: The average person most certainly does not. You have to put yourself in their shoes sometimes with, say, our team very much tries to keep it as simple as possible. We have a very straightforward thesis. All blockchains come down to the core value prop of the exchange of digital assets. How do you build the best possible infrastructure for exchanging assets? These assets can include tokens, can be nfts, can be risk, can be state changes, anything across the board.
00:27:11.096 - 00:27:35.228, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to underline that. I think it's such a huge statement that you're making. And when you first told me this in our personal conversations months ago, I was like, I don't know. There's a lot of other stuff. It's not just about trading tokens. Crypto has all this other stuff. But when you keep focusing and distilling it down, I'm kind of, like, leaning more towards your thesis, which is.
00:27:35.228 - 00:27:58.132, Speaker A: Yeah, like, you know, ZK. Because I'm talking to teams, like, amazing teams, super cryptographic. They're doing, you know, the next level of ZK cryptography, all this stuff. And. And then we go through and we're like, okay, what's actually gonna happen? And it's just like, oh, the tokens are gonna be exchanged without people knowing, like, who's trading and what the balances are. And it'll be like dark pool and stuff. So just, it still comes down to that.
00:27:58.132 - 00:28:08.338, Speaker A: Despite how, like, fancy the packages. Does that mean, like, everything is just a casino? Like, most of it's a casino?
00:28:08.506 - 00:28:40.134, Speaker C: Yeah. I think, like, an important thing to highlight is trading does not always mean speculation. It's very, very much. Speculation is definitely part of crypto in the market today. But the exchange of assets can be used for day to day activities, can be used for transactions, payments. So it expands, I think, far greater than people probably expect. The best example you can look at is just the most well adopted apps today.
00:28:40.134 - 00:29:24.702, Speaker C: Nearly all the most adopted applications in web3 and crypto end up revolving around exchanging assets. So you can look at either direct exchanges, you can look at the games like Axie and Stepn, the ones that are a bit more well known. Fundamentally, the user experience comes down to exchanging the shoe nfts, the sort of in game assets. If you look at Metamask tether, even the non exchanges, you'll find that tethers core use case today is as a trading pair metamask. Majority of users on metamask end up in the same destinations. It's like Uniswap OpenSea, roughly the same place as we expect.
00:29:24.838 - 00:30:00.686, Speaker E: I also want to highlight, and this has been my thesis, or our thesis for a while, is that transferring tokens is not a very. It's not simple, right? Like, if you think about it, a loan, an Aave loan is literally just a swap. All loans in the world are swaps. You exchange a for b and then you have some sort of settlement at the end where you exchange back or you liquidate, which is also just a transfer. So it is really interesting. I never thought about it that way. But it is true that, like, everything on chain is just a swap when you think about it, and there's some structure that gets tied to that or added on top, but at its core, it's all just a swap, which is pretty interesting to think about.
00:30:00.750 - 00:30:23.076, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess blockchains are just very transparent accounting systems for, say, you're designing a blockchain that's just trying to be really good at that thing. Do you think it can create new markets that currently don't exist? And do you see anything that's being built on, say, that isn't being built elsewhere, or is it still too early?
00:30:23.180 - 00:31:16.924, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. This is where blockchain gets, and crypto gets such a bad rep sometimes is people view it as very speculation first, where I think we'll start to see more and more of that magic and that value prop take hold is exactly in markets that didn't previously exist. So one example recently we've been thinking about is carbon credits. Carbon credits rule a lot more of the kind of corporate decision making than people probably expect. Like Disney gets involved with hundreds of millions of dollars of carbon credits a year right now, there's no market. Creating a market absolutely creates genuine value and that trickles down. So that's at least one of many examples we could probably think of that, where the exchange of assets isn't just speculation.
00:31:16.924 - 00:31:20.184, Speaker C: I think it drives a lot of real value.
00:31:20.344 - 00:31:50.054, Speaker B: Another question I have is, do you guys ever think other commodities will be traded on blockchains, such as corn or those types of commodities? Is that too early because you can have to have a settlement or someone to custody these assets and whatnot? Do you think that can also be a thing. And then maybe, like, things like that is like, what gets tradfi, like, you know, all that money on board, right? Things we don't expect that get adoption, that create actual value.
00:31:50.914 - 00:32:04.614, Speaker E: Maybe we could splice it in here, but it didn't mean to cut you off there. But when Blackrock, when Larry Fink was going on his tour talking about the BTC ETF, he actually said, we envision a world where all of our products, all of our ETF's could be tokenized in the future.
00:32:04.734 - 00:32:19.622, Speaker C: I think it's just an example of the pent up interest in crypto. And we are hearing from clients around the world about the need for crypto. And I believe crypto will play that type of role as a flight to quality.
00:32:19.718 - 00:32:29.706, Speaker E: And so I do think it's early, but I think, like, in the five to ten year time period, I wouldn't be surprised at all if we saw more financial products from the traditional world brought on chain and tokenized.
00:32:29.830 - 00:33:09.342, Speaker A: I mean, they are, I think, backed, which is Switzerland based, and they're tokenizing all these ETF's. They're already trying to be one of the kind of leaders on this. And, yeah, it should grow. I don't think it's easy to do what you're talking about, tyke, in terms of commodities just directly on chain, because there is physical settlement and, you know, in the real world, like, there's a huge amount, you know, like once I took, like by mistake a gold future to settlement back when I was a gold bug. And, you know, they just like, delivered some fucking physical gold. And, you know, someone has to do that and it's hard to do it when you're just in the digital, like, land as we are.
00:33:09.398 - 00:33:15.514, Speaker E: Can you tell us about that, Jordy? Did you have to pay a delivery fee? Did it come with like, brinks home security? Like, what happened?
00:33:15.894 - 00:33:56.812, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you basically, you know, in this case, we just like, ask the CME to store it in their vault and then you pay some fee and eventually kind of return it back. So, yeah, I think it costs like 50k or something just to handle it. I've had other people that I've worked with inadvertently take, like, natural gas to expiry, and that's really, really bad. You do not want to take natural gas to expiry. You will be like calling Citadel, begging them to get you out of it, and they will destroy you on the spread there. So careful if you're trading some of the energy stuff, that's pretty crazy. And there's no perps in tradfi.
00:33:56.812 - 00:34:17.006, Speaker A: So everyone's on calendar futures for now. Maybe they'll pick up the perps. Jeff, another question is we have Ethereum, where the value capture. We're looking at what's the revenue Ethereum. And it's the gas. It's a lot of gas. It's expensive, but it kind of gets burnt.
00:34:17.006 - 00:35:01.863, Speaker A: And then it helps the narrative of money for ETH, right? Because it creates buying pressure, scarcity and Justin Drake and all this jazz. Then you have Solana, which is thousandth of a cent. You don't need a lot to use it for forever. And it seems to be what I call community money. And I asked our guests this, I want to get their take on, like, you know, is community money like real? Is it sustainable? Do you kind of see just or do you think that. I think Anatoly is not averse to this, where the things built on Solana might be worth more than, you know, the token, because, you know, the token doesn't need to accrue all the value.
00:35:02.763 - 00:35:45.374, Speaker C: The framework that Anatoly talks about is the very fundamental definition of a platform. The word platform typically gets heavily misused because a lot of projects and apps across the board do it to try to spin a greater vision than there is. The definition of a platform is the stuff built on top of this thing is worth more than that thing. So a classic example is like Windows. Windows is the purest definition of a platform. All of the apps and stuff that you use on Windows, add them together, is worth more than Windows. Facebook is usually a great example of the opposite.
00:35:45.374 - 00:36:24.914, Speaker C: It's viewed as a platform. Facebook eats most of the value. If you look at the news sites like BuzzFeed and all those things actually build on Facebook, pay for the ad revenue, use that to get users, they by and large get squeezed. The big opportunity with Solana, with say as well, is the applications absolutely will one day become far, far more valuable, magnitudes more than the underlying chain. And it gets back to kind of the question we were talking about earlier. Simplicity is important as part of that journey. The second is shipping.
00:36:24.914 - 00:36:38.662, Speaker C: How do you stay relevant? You continue to ship, and that's where our team kind of defaults. And I think V two and some of the things that we've been announcing and working on is probably the best example of that.
00:36:38.798 - 00:37:09.538, Speaker A: Yeah, I do have a couple questions about it. I mean, we've seen, especially during the bear market, that we were just in any chain, not ethereum has a really hard time getting TVL. People just don't have an easy way to bridge. They just want to stick to Ethereum. That's it. We have aptos and Sui and all these massively funded projects trading at really high valuations, but there's really not much TVL. I think even Cosmos changed.
00:37:09.538 - 00:37:46.654, Speaker A: Say it's hard to get. I think maybe now with DyDX, it'll get easier once USDC becomes native. But instead, you're kind of, like, fighting for attention. You say, like, okay, how do we still stay relevant? Like you said, I noticed that you guys are frequently number one on the upbit volume, so clearly there's a lot of fans in Korea, maybe other parts of Asia. I know you've been living out in Asia as well. What do you see as. As being kind of like the asian community and how did you find success there?
00:37:46.814 - 00:38:33.154, Speaker C: I can't speak as much in terms of the specifics on the trading volume piece. I think that's almost like a different world where we play in the ecosystem. I can talk a lot more about our efforts so far and the foundation's efforts in terms of growing presence in Asia, in terms of growing ecosystem in countries like Korea and others. The focus on Asia for the foundation very much started, I'd say, beginning of 2023. That's when the foundation started hiring a lot more folks out there. So now a very healthy chunk of the broader team is based out of Asia. The reason is pretty clear.
00:38:33.154 - 00:39:18.928, Speaker C: A lot of the users in Asia are, aren't encumbered by regulatory sort of uncertainty. It's just so much more active and a lot of times under appreciated. So something as simple as translating the documents, making it easy for people to understand, to start getting involved, having people on the ground, meeting key folks in person, I think a lot of that helps. So I know the foundation is doing kind of the first big event in Korea, kind of going into q one and q two. So it's something that they're starting to pay a lot more attention to. But just the early innings.
00:39:19.056 - 00:39:52.616, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think most people have started to realize that just some of these really active countries are driving so much of the adoption and the momentum for crypto. So it's very well done there that you guys managed to get local knowledge and local talent to help spread into that region. You want to tell us a little bit about b two? I saw the announcement. Sei is changing some of the architecture. Maybe tell us a little bit about that before we go to pasta of the week.
00:39:52.720 - 00:40:47.510, Speaker C: Yeah. So the simple way to think about CB two, it's the biggest announcement and sort of proposal that has been made around, say, since mainnet launch. It's the first paralyzed EVM. The very simple way to think about it is it takes a lot of the big advantages and the advancement that Solana has made, which mostly revolve around taking the latest improvements in computer and using that just to make a simply better, more performant chain. People always refer to the trilemma. Trilemma is more of a sort of a convenient mental framework than it is reality, in our opinion. As computing improves, you absolutely can make and cut a lot of errors from the tralama.
00:40:47.510 - 00:41:26.994, Speaker C: So it takes all of the advantages of Solana, combines it with a lot of just the Lindy, the developer attraction, the ease of use of EVM and solidity. So almost the best of both worlds. The way we sort of think about v two is harks back to a bit of what you had mentioned earlier. Like when you talk to ZK projects, they're focused on making this big Zk advancement. Okay, cool. So what's the, what is it? How does it change the user experience? What does it do for users? Oh, yeah. So now users can exchange an asset privately.
00:41:26.994 - 00:42:08.064, Speaker C: Okay, cool. It comes down to exchanging assets, say, in our team will always be focused on solving the user problem. The users are now able to exchange assets a lot easier, just like they would be if they were trading on Coinbase or using Venmo or PayPal. What that user problem and what solving that user problem requires is a lot of different technical changes. It includes an EVM and parallelization. It's not just that the project is focused on paralyzing the EVM. The project is focused on the user problem.
00:42:08.064 - 00:42:15.532, Speaker C: EVM parallelization is one of many things that needs to be done. That's it. That's at least a bit of context.
00:42:15.668 - 00:42:44.998, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a quick question. So, obviously there's this thing that if you build it, they will come, but in practice, it doesn't really work like that. And you mentioned that for, say, you want it to be a platform where all the apps, if you combine the market cap or like the value, it'll be worth more than the platform itself. So how do you get those developers to build on, say, do you just give out grants? Or is there like a better way that you think is. Yeah, that's available?
00:42:45.126 - 00:43:19.638, Speaker C: I mean, that's the quintessential question. The framework that I've thought about kind of what is important to a layer one ecosystem is there's a lot of similarities between crypto and other industries. A lot more than people probably expect, I think folks. And web3. Web three, people tend to view crypto as a brand new paradigm. Everything changes, things work differently here. No, it was completely created by human beings.
00:43:19.638 - 00:44:00.020, Speaker C: It's still subject to a lot of the same, same effects of a system that was created by human beings. If you look at other industries, at biotech, like gaming, publishers play like a primary role in those industries. So let's just say the four of us created a brand new medicine. We still need to go to a lot of the big pharma companies like Pfizer and others who will help distribute that medicine to a lot of different hospitals. You can build a good vaccine, but you need someone to take those to all the hospitals and all the countries. Same with the game. If the four of us created a brand new game like GTA six, you can build an incredible game.
00:44:00.020 - 00:44:29.784, Speaker C: That doesn't mean people are going to play it. You need to get it to steam, you need to distribute, you need Activision to help put you in all the game stocks. The same goes for crypto. The four of us can create a brand new protocol, but you need a publisher partner. So the question is, who are the publishers? In crypto, there's usually two types. It's either a centralized exchange or a layer one or l, two or bridge. You can bucket all those together.
00:44:29.784 - 00:44:57.606, Speaker C: Today, Ethereum is by far the biggest publisher. If you want to build an app, you build on Ethereum. That gives you perhaps one of the best chances to get a user base, because that's where so many users still sitting. In order for Sait to be competitive for that ecosystem to one day overtake Solana, Ethereum, it needs to be a better publisher partner than Ethereum.
00:44:57.790 - 00:45:10.344, Speaker A: That's like a different thesis, right? It's kind of refreshingly, you combine the partnership both on the bd level and not just ATT and CK. Others just focus on one or the other. You kind of have like a holistic approach, I guess.
00:45:10.464 - 00:45:29.924, Speaker C: Yeah. At the end of the day, apps care about users. They care about finding users. Those users can hold the token, those users can get involved with and use the application. It can bring them revenue potentially down the line. So focus on helping them get users. It's really difficult to compete against Ethereum.
00:45:29.924 - 00:46:13.722, Speaker C: That's why Solana had an incredible advantage in partnering with an exchange at the time. BNB has an advantage because it has this big exchange partner. So you almost have like these two publishers working together to help applications built on top find more and more users. So that's the big focus, per se, what that entails, grants help, but so is every other kind of ecosystem is very much doing the same thing. I think I'd say a lesson and something the foundation team really keeps in mind is if everyone's going that way, just try the other direction.
00:46:13.818 - 00:46:36.694, Speaker A: It's been a great show, and I think the final segment will also be pretty epic. I've seen the scene, some of the pastas. So let's just, like, without further ado, head to pasta of the week. Jeff, if you don't have one, feel free to be our judge this week because I've seen some of the other ones. Do you have a pasta, or are you going to kind of choose the chef hat where it goes?
00:46:37.034 - 00:46:41.494, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll tip up my chin and I'll be the judge.
00:46:42.034 - 00:46:45.894, Speaker A: Okay. Taiki, do you want to. Do you want to kick off with yours?
00:46:46.914 - 00:47:07.506, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm definitely the mid curve team, you know, where Sherlock Holdalls has amazing memes and, you know, has this jiff or this video of trying to catch these altcoin pumps like this. This dog just so happy to catch a disc, but he just fails epically. I feel like this is my life right now.
00:47:07.530 - 00:47:07.786, Speaker A: You know?
00:47:07.810 - 00:47:08.722, Speaker B: Like, I just.
00:47:08.898 - 00:47:09.162, Speaker C: I.
00:47:09.178 - 00:47:25.532, Speaker B: Like, I buy coins, but they're boomer coins. You know, I need to buy stuff that the DJ's like. You know, like, we don't have the boomer money yet. You know, like, the boomers are gonna buy my bags, but I have to. I have to stop being so mid curve. I have to think left curve, probably left curve. Maybe right curve.
00:47:25.708 - 00:47:30.664, Speaker E: Is this in reference to maker and Kantor? I mean, those coins are doing well, though, right? Just to be clear.
00:47:31.004 - 00:47:31.500, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:47:31.572 - 00:47:42.684, Speaker B: No, no, no. But I feel like I. I'm kind of very rigid in my thesis around real world assets. I think I need to diversify a little more. I don't want to trade my opinion. I need a trade where.
00:47:42.724 - 00:47:59.452, Speaker A: Yeah, Luna classic, you know, USD classic. Like this. This is the stuff that's going up 50% percent a day. So, Justin, you've been saying that we don't deserve this bull run. That probably intensifies your belief in that statement right now.
00:47:59.628 - 00:48:01.028, Speaker E: Exactly. Exactly.
00:48:01.076 - 00:48:12.428, Speaker B: Do you guys think we've. I want to talk about that, too. Like, I feel like we've somewhat deserved it. I feel like we've endured two years of pain. We endured FTX, and now, you know.
00:48:12.516 - 00:48:15.384, Speaker A: Have we learned the lessons? Have we learned the lessons?
00:48:17.534 - 00:48:35.274, Speaker C: It's like the same every day. Every day you stray further from God that's. That's a bit of that. Somebody. Somebody should launch, like a mid. A mid meme. Meme coin and dedicated to Taiki.
00:48:36.654 - 00:48:37.870, Speaker B: The logo is my face.
00:48:37.982 - 00:48:44.014, Speaker C: Yeah, it's finally a meme coin that the mids can get. Can really value midpoint.
00:48:44.594 - 00:48:53.282, Speaker B: Yo, that's community money, isn't it, Jody? Like, the middle of the bet corp. Has the most amount of people. So if you think about community money, maybe the mid token.
00:48:53.418 - 00:49:04.346, Speaker A: If one of our steady lads listeners wants to do that, I will commit to eating the Uniswap pool a little bit. Justin, do you want to show us what you've got?
00:49:04.530 - 00:49:33.200, Speaker E: I don't even know why I try anymore, because I never win these things. But Jeff, maybe he'll come through for me. But, you know, I think this goes into that sort of mid curve theme that we've been talking about, that Tyche just mentioned we've. We've been chatting over. So Andrew said, how the fuck did Jito open in a higher FTV than light? Oh, I've been holding that bag from the stone cold bottom for over a fucking year. Piece of canave, CEO of Jump Crypto. I'm going to flip the got a goddamn table.
00:49:33.200 - 00:49:49.534, Speaker E: And, I mean, this just resonates so well. It's like you can pick the assets that make sense, that have sustainable revenue, that are like leaders on the main chain. But to Jerdy's point, when a shiny new coin comes along, people are going to sure as hell pick that one up. So that's my pasta for the week.
00:49:49.694 - 00:50:47.198, Speaker C: That resonates a lot. I think that's something. One of the things I appreciate the most about crypto is especially coming from traditional finance, and you're effectively told you have to do all these things to be successful. So there's almost like a preordained definition of success. You go to grade school, you go to Harvard, you go work at this top firm, maybe you go to b school, you go to work at this next top firm, and you continue to out compete your peers. The beautiful irony is someone who doesn't get that doesn't get into the college you got into, who doesn't get the job that you got, ends up in, honestly, a much better spot. And I think that creates so much anger for a lot of the people that I've been surrounded by a big chunk of my life that it's almost like a poetic justice.
00:50:47.366 - 00:50:51.598, Speaker E: Well, I feel like I might have you picking me because we feel pretty aligned here, Jeff.
00:50:51.646 - 00:51:22.324, Speaker A: So let's see what Jordy has let's see. Let's see what Jordy has indeed. So I have been cracking up this week, week seeing this dude, and, you know, maybe this guy is one of our fans. Maybe he's a steady lad listener. So if he is, you know, we would love a $60,000 tip as well. We gotta pay some editing costs and everything here. But, yeah, this dude with, like, the, you know, the spectacle glasses and everything seems to be a crypto whale looking for a queen.
00:51:22.324 - 00:52:16.992, Speaker A: Spent $62,000 for this fine lady's pictures, I guess, and found her in real life. Yo, shout out to my boy here. So that is not the pasta. This is the prelude to the pasta. So Zach XBT has been doing some investigative work, and he said that he's been monitoring somebody who has been laundering cash through magic, the gathering coins, sorry, cards, because apparently, like, this is something that you can actually buy with crypto, and then you can get, like, an ear, like, in real life, kind of fiat off ramp, because you get a broker, and, yeah, you lose 10% because you gotta, you know, take. Pay a premium to get the money out. But apparently someone's done this with, like, $25,000.
00:52:16.992 - 00:52:30.914, Speaker A: He's been buying, like, the. The rarest magic, the gathering cards. So Zach is, like, you know, following the on chain, and, like, this. This dude is doing this, and somebody responds. Found him.
00:52:33.374 - 00:52:45.052, Speaker E: It is pretty solid. And I have to say, too, I think those are shout out to Snapchat, my former employer. I think those are snap spectacles he's wearing, too. So he's got the right fit on. He's a good guy.
00:52:45.158 - 00:52:52.800, Speaker B: His shirt says, if I die, delete my browser history. So that's also a pasta that I didn't catch until now.
00:52:52.912 - 00:53:14.368, Speaker A: You can see, like, under Zack, somebody says, like, I'm never deleting this app. I mean, this is, like, the pure stuff that Twitter just sometimes, you know, you deal with a lot of junk, but occasionally you get a gem like this on Twitter. So I agree. I will continue using Twitter, even with whatever Elon does with it. This is just too epic. Wait, wait, wait.
00:53:14.416 - 00:53:20.920, Speaker B: Justin, can you show the other. He's also a number one spender for this other fine lady.
00:53:21.072 - 00:53:21.832, Speaker C: I saw this.
00:53:21.928 - 00:53:29.136, Speaker A: This is, like, a little bit of a flex. Like, she shows hers, and it's even more than the 60,000. It's, like 100,000 that this guy spent.
00:53:29.160 - 00:53:34.456, Speaker E: On this $107,000 for a year.
00:53:34.600 - 00:53:37.574, Speaker C: I think we need to see who else comes out of the woodwork.
00:53:37.744 - 00:53:46.002, Speaker E: Well, Lamar, if you're a listener, drop a comment. We'll have you for, like, a two minute special on the show, and we'll make it happen.
00:53:46.138 - 00:53:47.498, Speaker B: We have to find him a queen.
00:53:47.586 - 00:53:53.214, Speaker C: If you come on, Lamar. Jordy. Jordy will consider getting an onlyfans.
00:53:55.514 - 00:54:03.952, Speaker A: I'll go to, like, I'll go to Irene, Zhao and Marin and all the. All the prime crypto girls. I'll get one of them to join the show.
00:54:04.048 - 00:54:11.992, Speaker B: No, like, I mean, this man spent $170,000 on two accounts. Like, if he finds a queen, then all that money can go towards buying crypto coins.
00:54:12.048 - 00:54:12.312, Speaker A: Right?
00:54:12.368 - 00:54:15.844, Speaker B: Like, you have to. We have to. We have to help. We have to three three ourselves.
00:54:17.104 - 00:54:25.736, Speaker C: Yeah, you could. You could argue that that was a better use of money than buying. Buying Kanto. Yeah.
00:54:25.800 - 00:54:27.896, Speaker B: Actually, though, yeah. If he finds his queen.
00:54:28.080 - 00:54:33.046, Speaker A: All right, Jeff, so who gets the chef hat this week? You have. You have think. I think three very solid options.
00:54:33.190 - 00:54:45.514, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say. No question. The Onlyfans piece, there's, like, lore behind it. There's. There's. There's lore around the. The magic, the gathering.
00:54:45.514 - 00:54:51.234, Speaker C: It's like, the full kind of the three parts of the movie, the kind of three acts.
00:54:51.854 - 00:54:57.554, Speaker A: You get the full coin web. Awesome. All right, I'm sorry, Justin. You'll have to wait next week.
00:54:58.514 - 00:54:59.254, Speaker C: Cool.
