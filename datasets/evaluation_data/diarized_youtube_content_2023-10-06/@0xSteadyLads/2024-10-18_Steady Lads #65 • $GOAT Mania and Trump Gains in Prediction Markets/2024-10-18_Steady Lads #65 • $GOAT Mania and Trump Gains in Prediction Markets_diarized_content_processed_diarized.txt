00:00:19.000 - 00:00:34.173, Speaker A: GM everybody, we are live. It's been a while since we had a live one. We've had a lot of guests recently. This time it'll just be the three of us. So I'm Jordy. We have Justin and Taiki. I think we have a lot of new subscribers after the Blow Up Murad episode.
00:00:34.173 - 00:00:42.145, Speaker A: Everyone loves Murad. So whenever we get a main character, we get some new listeners to. Hello to those guys. Yeah, please, please like and subscribe.
00:00:43.845 - 00:00:46.941, Speaker B: We'll be talking about the thesis, the meme Coin supersede.
00:00:46.973 - 00:01:14.665, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll get into it. I think take you just like itching at the bit to get into Goat. I think is, is what he's been dreaming about every day since that came out. So we'll, we'll chat about that. I mean part of the reason we're having a live episode. So I'm in San Francisco right now. I told myself I would not be traveling much for the rest of the year, but there was an interesting opportunity to attend yesterday.
00:01:14.665 - 00:01:50.351, Speaker A: So I told the guys, you know, I'm flying in for basically like two days. So it's a 18 hour flight from Sam from Singapore each way. And you know, I wouldn't do this for many reasons, but let's, let's, let's kind of bring up what was going on yesterday. So basically our most loyal and old listeners probably know that one of our first episodes we talked about worldcoin and time is a flat circle because yesterday I was at the Worldcoin conference, like their annual or whatever.
00:01:50.423 - 00:01:53.475, Speaker C: The first episode, by the way, was about worldcoin.
00:01:54.255 - 00:02:35.595, Speaker A: Yeah, so they had one of those traditional San Francisco tech kind of keynote addresses that we're so used to seeing. You know, the Apple, the, the Google, this kind of stuff. It was downtown San Francisco and you know, some obviously sketchy area because everywhere sketchy in the mission with you know, some people kind of shooting up outside. But then on the inside, honestly guys, I was very impressed. They're, they're doing it for real. It wasn't, it wasn't a low quality production. It was very well put.
00:02:35.595 - 00:03:14.135, Speaker A: Let's, let's check out some of the, the stuff they've been posting because they first of all rebranded guys. So it's no longer World Coin, it's world. So whenever they feel like they can, they can just take a word like that. It's a big deal. So they announced several things yesterday. It does look like world id, which is the next step because initially all the, I mean, Justin, you did the orb as well, right? So you've scanned.
00:03:14.175 - 00:03:17.727, Speaker C: I did. Did you ever manage tokens, though?
00:03:17.871 - 00:03:19.155, Speaker A: You haven't? You haven't?
00:03:19.895 - 00:03:33.625, Speaker C: No. When we were in Singapore together, remember we were talking about worldcoin, the three of us before going on stage and I pulled up the World Coin app and I, I don't think I'm eligible for tokens because I registered in the US I'm still trying to work through that, but I haven't seen a single World Coin.
00:03:34.085 - 00:03:36.869, Speaker B: Oh no, you couldn't jump at the top.
00:03:37.037 - 00:03:45.425, Speaker C: If you have a chance to meet with Sam Jordy, maybe you could mention my account. Justin Graham. I've registered my eyes. I'm ready. Ready for my coins.
00:03:46.725 - 00:04:02.719, Speaker A: Yeah. So I did have some time with, with Sam Altman yesterday. I was able to ask him some questions. Unfortunately, I did not choose to ask about your specific wallet, Justin. So I had limited time. I had to get into steady lads.
00:04:02.807 - 00:04:03.715, Speaker C: We can ask.
00:04:04.855 - 00:04:27.531, Speaker A: Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it happens someday. So let's talk about. I mean, there's just a lot to unpack from my day yesterday. I'm sorry everybody. If I'm, if I'm like a bit jet lag, I'm still processing what happened. I had a, I think like a 45 hour without sleeping. So I didn't sleep on the plane at all.
00:04:27.531 - 00:04:58.163, Speaker A: Landed, it was midnight and then I just kind of went through the whole 24 hours. Pretty intense. I think I had, I would estimate I ate yesterday about 9,000 calories. They had like a smoothie bar where they just make all these really like, you know, coconut milk dense smoothies. And I must have ordered like eight or nine of those. And they put all this like, this is why I love California. They put all this like nootropics everywhere.
00:04:58.163 - 00:05:18.667, Speaker A: Like there's electrolytes and ashkawanda and all this stuff. So I made it through the day. Guys, let's start with the chart because we're all kind of a little bit degens here. We don't, we want to always bring up the chart. Since we talked about Worldcoin a year ago, it's had a very interesting trajectory. Maybe we can. Yeah, this is everything.
00:05:18.667 - 00:06:08.365, Speaker A: So when we first talked about it, it was, it was like two bucks. They had gotten market makers to sell a bunch of tokens above $2 and sort of keep the stability. And I think I had said at the time that this was the coin most likely to have a luna like run up that I'd seen before. And the reason, if you guys remember was that the way they presented it is that it's trying to be a, like a base currency, like a money, like a gold, like a bitcoin. It's trying to be base money and whenever you do that you might run into issues but you might also have a period in which things run up a lot. So it was obviously bear market. Yeah, go ahead.
00:06:09.025 - 00:06:37.155, Speaker C: I was curious Jordy, like how have your thoughts changed? I mean when we first talked about worldcoin, the float, meaning the market cap to FTV ratio, how much was circulating was under 5%, maybe about 2%. I know now every week a lot of tokens are hitting the market and it looks like here the market cap to FTV ratio is about 5% circulating. What are your thoughts on that? I know that you know, caused you to push back a little on the project when we first talked about it. Has your view changed there?
00:06:38.775 - 00:07:14.715, Speaker A: I'm not. The market cap to FDD is probably one of the most interesting of any project because it's very small and there's a reason why it's small in this case. And also the unlocks are very, very long. I mean you look at some of the FTX estate coins, I, I was looking at some of the bidding for those and like these vestings go out for like you know, seven years, eight years. It's very long vesting period. And it kind of makes sense with the project because they're trying to distribute globally and it's going to take many years to get to everybody. So they don't want to unlock the vc, the VC coin so much.
00:07:14.715 - 00:07:44.745, Speaker A: But if we look at the chart obviously around the altcoin bull market period, I think some people flipped bullish on it because they realized how small the market cap is and they pushed it to the peak, it looks like 11.7, which is $117 billion FDB. Pretty, pretty chunky. Yeah. This was pre unlocks I guess. Pre. Any unlocks.
00:07:45.365 - 00:07:59.425, Speaker B: Yeah. But I mean we spent like seven minutes on this. Like are you bullish now, Jordy? Like WorldCoin after talking to Sam and going to this event, clearly like right now we have Nvidia hitting all time highs. Taiwan semi hit all time highs.
00:07:59.885 - 00:08:00.309, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:00.357 - 00:08:03.335, Speaker B: So maybe that you guys made this back on.
00:08:04.075 - 00:08:35.147, Speaker A: I think it's, I'm, I'm bullish. Unfortunately I am bullish after witnessing what I witnessed yesterday. It's, it's hard not to be bullish for the medium term. Let's say first of all like being in San Francisco and going to like a more like of a tech tech event. This was not a crypto event. I think the crowd was international. There was a Q and A session and there was clearly people from India, Norway, everywhere.
00:08:35.147 - 00:09:18.055, Speaker A: The bottom line is this is a different category than what we're used to. And it was so juxtaposed because right after meeting Sam Altman, I had a meeting with Sriram from Eigenlayer. And the contrast between like a crypto founder and a tech San Francisco bro founder, and these are both, you know, incredibly gifted, both of them, but the, the contrast is just so massive. Shiram is much more likable and friendly and, you know, you kind of feel like you want this guy to win. Like he's, you want him on your side. He, he's so charming as. He's kind of boyish.
00:09:18.055 - 00:09:29.045, Speaker A: He's very boyish. Stamp Altman is a freaking killer. I mean, it's obviously he's remarkably intelligent, but.
00:09:30.825 - 00:09:32.377, Speaker C: Well, let me ask you this, Jordy.
00:09:32.481 - 00:09:32.857, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:32.921 - 00:09:48.485, Speaker C: Like, after going there, did you come across saying this is not a cash grab or a low effort project. Like, they're actually putting a lot of time and resource into making this work. And it's not like a side project for Sam Altman to get liquidity, he actually cares or like, what are your thoughts there?
00:09:49.965 - 00:10:10.541, Speaker A: So those are very different things. You mentioned on the first one. 100%. This is not a quick cash grab. They've been building for five years already, right? So that's one thing. Their vision of when this is going to materialize is also like many years. So this is a like, you know, decade, multi decade project.
00:10:10.541 - 00:10:29.331, Speaker A: This is not a world. I don't know what this Trump thing is. Maybe it's good. But anyway, like, this is, this is very different. So let's talk about what, just briefly, what they presented. They have, like everybody else in crypto decided to do their own chain. Like, you know, Uniswap is doing their own chain, worldcoin.
00:10:29.331 - 00:10:55.885, Speaker A: Now, OP stack, this seems to be the standard now. I don't know if OP is winning. Like, there's some signs that, you know, op stack is becoming the de facto world chain is doing their own chain. Here's what's unique that nothing else in crypto has. And here's, you know, they talked about crypto in such an interesting way. Maybe this is kind of the most interesting thing for everybody in the space that's listening. All the crypto people.
00:10:55.885 - 00:11:27.855, Speaker A: Crypto is a key part of their strategy and of Sam Altman's strategy and of maybe like even his grander strategy. Crypto is a very Key component. So good news is like, we matter, okay? Our industry matters. Like, the tech we're building matters. This is like a key part of it. The downside is they don't care at all about all the current crypto natives. They think like, there's no, there's no people even like centralized exchanges, you know, whatever.
00:11:27.855 - 00:12:10.297, Speaker A: There's some people, but like, not, not that many. They are going after the iPhone user globally and they have built an app store within the app store. There were some questions around, like, would Apple allow this? Because, you know, normally Apple would not allow such a thing. It's their app store. You can't have an app store within their app store. This is the magic of being in San Francisco and being connected because obviously Sam Altman, you know, knows these guys extremely well, calls, you know, calls Apple, his buddies there. They were telling us on stage that he's like talking with John Ives all the time and all this kind of stuff.
00:12:10.297 - 00:12:51.799, Speaker A: Clearly, like there, there's some good relationship and they're allowing them to basically allow an app store within the worldcoin app. So if you reopen it, Justin, your newest version, there's all kinds of apps going on. There's games, there's like, you know, it's basically. This is what makes me very bullish. You know how Telegram became very popular now because it has users and people want to tap into like this ton mini app kind of thesis. They're doing the same thing and they have a lot of users and they're getting a lot more users because obviously they're paying people to scan them and get them on. And you also know that they're real users, they're not bots.
00:12:51.799 - 00:13:37.815, Speaker A: So, you know, like there's X number of eyeballs that have been scanned and on the chain. So if you as an app developer or a builder want access to like real people with, with a process that's allowed in the app Store, this, this could be like scary. That it could actually. So that, that was, I would say, like the most bullish part. There were some scary things though. Like they, they think crypto is clearly like a very powerful tool. But I wouldn't say that they care about, you know, crypto Twitter culture or like, you know, this kind of stuff.
00:13:37.815 - 00:13:51.305, Speaker A: It's more that they realize that this is the quickest way to create incentives to make people align with your vision to pay them coins. And it's very powerful tool.
00:13:51.845 - 00:14:12.385, Speaker C: I mean, I do think that is bullish, right? Like instead of focusing on the 20,000 crypto Twitter people, they're thinking about, you know, that's not a big enough market to play in. Right. For anyone. And we're all sort of competing for the same users. But it sounds like you're saying they're trying to expand the pie, which to me is, is more bullish than them going after crypto, Twitter and trying to make this thing, you know, the narrative of the week.
00:14:12.935 - 00:14:13.647, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:14:13.671 - 00:14:19.639, Speaker B: And doesn't this kind of tie in with like goat? I mean, sorry, I. I've been in the Goat.
00:14:19.687 - 00:14:20.471, Speaker A: Okay, thank you.
00:14:20.543 - 00:14:21.223, Speaker B: For like a week.
00:14:21.279 - 00:14:21.759, Speaker A: All right.
00:14:21.847 - 00:14:27.671, Speaker B: I like my, my headspace has been. It's filled with goat, so.
00:14:27.783 - 00:14:46.485, Speaker A: All right, okay, so we'll, we'll leave like the real stuff that's going on and the stuff that matters and let's go to Goat. Everybody, let's go. Thank you. Kick us off on what Goat is.
00:14:47.065 - 00:15:21.891, Speaker B: Yeah, so go. Actually here, Justin, if you can share my. Share my tab. So this was deployed like roughly a week ago. And the lore is insane. All right, so there's this account called Terminal, which got funded $50,000 by Mark Andreessen and it just picked a coin called Goat and it just like made it its coin. And this account, true Terminal, has been trained on like, like 4chan, weird Reddit cultures and it's completely unhinged.
00:15:21.891 - 00:15:54.821, Speaker B: If you just go to the account, it has 82,000 followers on Sunday. This thing had 20,000 followers on Thursday, has 82,000. So clearly this thing, I mean, this is like tangible data that says like this thing is spreading like wildfire. And it's so, it's so weird. I feel like the lore is so interesting and I feel like this is one of those things that's only possible in crypto. And this is what makes me bullish. Because if you think about the super cycle thesis, right, the meme coin super cycle thesis by Murad, he's bullish.
00:15:54.821 - 00:16:08.239, Speaker B: These cold coins, right? I don't really believe that SPX 6900 is a cult. I think Murad is a cult and he owns SPX 1600, therefore it's pumping. But I think the next possible main.
00:16:08.287 - 00:16:10.815, Speaker A: Character in crypto is not a human.
00:16:10.975 - 00:16:45.723, Speaker B: What if it's an AI and we're not even considering what this actually means. Look at these posts. It's so weird. It's so off putting and this thing is spreading like wildfire and the virality of this is insane and I probably sound like a madman right now, but the last time I felt this interested in a crypto related phenomenon was Q2 2021. With Polygon yield farming. So the past week I've just been studying this LLM, what is Terminal of Truth, the lore behind it. And I'm just so interested in it.
00:16:45.723 - 00:16:59.845, Speaker B: And for me to be disinterested in something, I feel like there's something there. So I actually think that this AI Cold coin thing has legs. And I think AI Cold coins is going to vampire tech, like, AI Tech coins. It's like the whole, you know, Murat.
00:16:59.885 - 00:17:00.837, Speaker A: Thing that he talked about, right?
00:17:00.861 - 00:17:16.625, Speaker B: Meme coins will vampire attack tech tokens. So I don't want to spend too much time on this because I can keep going. But what do you guys think of Goat? I'm like, it was really, really so infatuated. I'm so interested in this thing. There's like a new meta. I think it's a new meta.
00:17:17.515 - 00:17:48.125, Speaker A: Yeah. If I seem less than enthused, it's. First of all, if everybody listened to our last episode, funnily enough, right after it aired is when Go came out. So I specifically pre called Goat before it happened. I would say. Is that fair to say, like, the AI being the meme coin? The AI Meme coin is. Is a thesis that was very obvious to me, and I kind of called out just before Go Go got released.
00:17:48.125 - 00:18:15.515, Speaker A: I'll tell you why I'm less bullish. And even though, you know, obviously, like, I understand the category I've called it, I don't think that it is the end boss. This is not. It's gonna get a lot worse. Like, the level of AI Meme Coin religion, this is. This is nothing. This is like a random.
00:18:15.515 - 00:18:42.241, Speaker A: It's interesting. And it has like, that, like, slurf component where you. You get like a few weeks of everybody saying that, you know, obviously, like, this is a incredible lore and getting, like, really excited. It's not. It's not religious enough because I don't. I don't think the LLM is strong enough, and I don't think that the. The concept is religious enough.
00:18:42.393 - 00:19:17.819, Speaker C: I want to ask you about, both of you guys, about that. So Murad was very convincing on our podcast, and I came away for like a day or two very bullish on meme coins. And the thesis made sense. I did spend a lot of time reflecting since then, though. And the one thing I really don't agree with or would push back on is this idea that, okay, religions on the decline, Church subscriptions are down, so people need to find meaning elsewhere, and they're going to find it in these meme coin cults. I Don't think that's actually true. I think people are only like in these communities and part of these projects because numbers going up and the second number goes down, like there is no community.
00:19:17.819 - 00:19:49.209, Speaker C: I don't think it's fair to say that like the decrease of religion means the increase of meme coins. I don't really see the connection there and I don't think anyone's actually there for the community. Like I don't think Barad is getting his sense of community as a person from some like crappy meme corn discord Meme coin discord where people are like sharing half baked memes. People are just spamming the chat all the time with gm. Like I don't actually think that's true. I think people just believe that that could be true in the future. But obviously like today we're just hyper gambling gambling and speculating on price.
00:19:49.209 - 00:19:57.205, Speaker C: Like the second price goes down. There are no communities around these tokens. I mean we've seen that time and time again. I just, I don't know why that would be different.
00:19:58.415 - 00:20:20.687, Speaker B: Yeah, if I can, if I can comment first. I don't disagree. Right. Like people only like goat because it's going up and because goat is going up, there's more attention on this account and this attention is feeding on itself. And it understands that goat is going up. It understands that it's getting more engagement. So it's kind of like leaning on that and you know, like we don't really know where this ends.
00:20:20.687 - 00:20:40.065, Speaker B: But I feel like we had Moodang hit like 330mil and just go to zero, right? Yeah, like mood and good. Like, you know. But I feel like this one is actually like it actually creates a new meta. Like this is. This is only possible in crypto. Like I looked at AI coins. Yeah, it's a new meta, right.
00:20:40.065 - 00:21:09.553, Speaker B: I looked at AI coins and the reason thing bittensor goes up is because it's like the only viable AI coin. But the economics don't really make any sense. But for this I feel like, I don't know, it's just so interesting about this. It's a VC backed AI coin. Technically that's fully. That's 100% float and it's kind of like a fair launch technically. And I don't know, I feel like this thing has captured the imaginations of so many people and it's going to spawn out new metas that we're not even considering.
00:21:09.553 - 00:21:11.801, Speaker B: And that's kind of why I'm so interested in this.
00:21:11.873 - 00:21:25.917, Speaker C: Taiki, can you just Explain how the tech works, maybe, or what's happening here. Because Potato says, isn't it just a guy curating chat GPT prompts. That's sort of my understanding. But can you actually speak? Is there an actual AI agent actually doing everything or what's happening here?
00:21:26.061 - 00:21:41.381, Speaker B: Yeah, so. So the LLM is trained by, you know, this guy who's. His name's Andy A. I think. I think he's somewhere in Europe. And the LLM was trained reading, like very like specific niche, like unhinged. It's like, you know, Internet subcultures.
00:21:41.381 - 00:22:06.599, Speaker B: And right now it's not fully automated. The. And like, Andy the dev mentioned that he doesn't want this AI bot to say anything racist. So right now the AI technically generates these tweets and then the human is posting it for it. And that I think it filters out really racist. I mean, I'm not sure what's going on behind there, but it is a human that's kind of acting as the arms of the AI right now.
00:22:06.687 - 00:22:19.485, Speaker A: And Taiki, the human is also the one who deployed it on pump Fun. Right? Like a human went and filled in the. The pieces. Let's make that clear.
00:22:19.905 - 00:22:41.493, Speaker B: Yeah, the AI didn't do anything. Some random dude deployed it and people were kind of saying, which one's the right goat? And then the AI said, this one's the right goat. And then that became the right goat. So it's kind of like similar to the whole Nero or whatever that dog meta was, where it's like, oh, this is the right one. And then the community adopted it as the right one.
00:22:41.689 - 00:22:54.385, Speaker C: Someone needs to create one of those memes, like the dominoes, where someone's pushing the little domino, like religion. Religion subscriptions are down 10%. And then the last domino to fall is like someone deploys a cult AI goat token on Solana.
00:22:56.285 - 00:23:29.751, Speaker A: So here's my take, guys. I mean, this is the warning shot and this is the. What I was talking about last week. This is the proof that this is going to happen and that this is possible and that this can pick up and there is a world coming where these, like, AI meme coin two narratives collide very strongly. And this is the first warning shot. It's interesting seeing Arthur Hayes and like all crypto Twitter pushing this thing. It's good.
00:23:29.751 - 00:23:48.437, Speaker A: On the one hand, I'm kind of happy to see it. It means if people don't just show like their free cabal bags that they. Because this one they couldn't have had before. This was. They're buying on Open market like everybody else, and they're seeing like there's some pump potential. So I respect that. I think Ansem's talking about it.
00:23:48.437 - 00:24:12.371, Speaker A: I think, like, you know, different people have. Have been shilling this and it's because they're like taiki. They just really see this as a potential new meta. So I get it. And maybe it can go to like a billion because there might be like mainstream media attention. I think, you know, there's some chance of exit liquidity there. This is not going to be any different than slurf.
00:24:12.371 - 00:24:36.555, Speaker A: If you want to bring up the Slurf chart, you can go higher, but this is not anything different. Ultimately, it's. It's a fascinating experiment. There's some lore behind it. Goatse, like, for people who are my age, like, this was the OG like crazy meme back in the day, like the 4chan kind of. So it kind of ties into different. Different things.
00:24:36.555 - 00:24:45.975, Speaker A: It's great. I just, I'm mid curving it, so, you know, I'm not gonna like, ride it up, but at least I'm not gonna like, hold it on the way down.
00:24:48.955 - 00:25:03.017, Speaker C: But yeah, no, Jordy, hold on. Let me just say it's not fair to say that one can mid curve this. Or not. There's no. I mean, it's literally just a hot music, a game of musical chairs. We're just tossing a hot potato around. Like, of.
00:25:03.017 - 00:25:15.825, Speaker C: You know, of course, if you had made money by buying this five days ago, right, you would think you were smart. But, like, it's really just random chance. There's a thousand. A million other meme coins launched that didn't do well. I mean, I don't know. I don't think that's the right framework to think about it.
00:25:15.905 - 00:25:27.957, Speaker B: I actually think this, this has staying power. Like, I don't disagree that at some point it's going to go down 90%. But like, I actually feel like this is a new meta, but you're just.
00:25:27.981 - 00:25:56.025, Speaker C: Trying to get in and out before everyone else does. I mean, I think it's so important to say, like, what Arthur is saying here and what everyone else is saying on crypto Twitter couldn't be further from the truth. Like, goat doing well has nothing to do with, you know, as Arthur says, a bunch of dudes hundreds of thousands of years ago wrote a book and million. A few billion people follow it. Like, I don't know how we got that narrative attached to meme coins. There's literally no evidence to suggest that any of that is grounded in anything in Reality. It's purely just a narrative.
00:25:58.445 - 00:26:00.105, Speaker B: It is a narrative. Yeah.
00:26:02.405 - 00:26:25.677, Speaker A: I mean Justin, just here on your previous point about the religion stuff, I think the truth is in the middle and you're missing. There's a group of people that are religious about this stuff. Already I'm hearing about SXP 6900 tattoos going on and like this kind of stuff. So this is, this is like not like just the, you know.
00:26:25.741 - 00:26:37.357, Speaker C: Have you been to any of these discords? Jordy, when they say you're going to get your sense of community from these communities, they're talking about a discord chat. Have you ever spent more than 30 seconds in these discords? It's terrible, Justin.
00:26:37.381 - 00:26:42.805, Speaker B: It's, it's not the discord. It's. It's posting about it on Twitter and getting engagement. That is the sense of community.
00:26:42.925 - 00:26:48.233, Speaker C: It's trying to shield to other. The discord is, I guess religion is partly that.
00:26:48.289 - 00:27:10.937, Speaker A: But I mean let's, let's look at Dogecoin because that's one that is very og. It's been through the cycles. It has quote unquote staying power. I guess it's still in the top 20, whatever, at least. But you know, market cap and stuff hasn't done this cycle. Right. Like the, the pumps, this cycle have been reverted and.
00:27:10.937 - 00:27:57.413, Speaker A: Pretty pathetic. Elon. Yeah, despite Elon, you know, even posting with Trump and all this stuff, it's, it's finally having like another little election time pump here. But you know, when you're at 20 billion market cap, I guess it's hard to, you know, it's like the old grandma just trying to like walk down the street. Yeah, you're not gonna get that far. So for these ones, I mean, look, Goat I think can go to 1 to 2 billion and I think people who have that target might get an exit if they, if they time it. But what I was talking about last week is a much, much, much smarter AI.
00:27:57.413 - 00:28:10.503, Speaker A: Like a super intelligent AI. This is not a super intelligent AI. This is like a really funny, interesting AI. It's a good experiment. It's not going to create this feeling of awe of like I need to follow this AI. It's smarter than me. I need to do what it says.
00:28:10.503 - 00:28:19.675, Speaker A: Like that's what we're going to get to and that's going to be like the real religious stuff that I see. So we're going to get there, but it'll be something else.
00:28:20.295 - 00:28:46.255, Speaker B: So you think that the actual AI cult will look similar to this, but it'll just be holier than thou type of feeling where it's like altruistic or, you know, it's like, I don't know, it's like, oh my God, like, this AI is so smart. We need to follow what this person or what this AI is saying. Like, if this AI says meet in San Francisco in two weeks, we're going to go there and party or like, whatever. Is that kind of the world you're envisioning?
00:28:46.955 - 00:29:24.527, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So when I was saying about this coin that I saw last week that might be, you know, coming out next, next year one, the strength is a lot higher because it literally is getting trained on its own. Like the next version of chips, like, not the H1 hundreds, like the next generation. There's like nine, like hundreds of millions being spent on developing this specific AI and it's being done in like international waters. So it doesn't have sovereignty. Like, there is so much more power than this, like, goatsy stuff we're talking about here that like, people. And it actually gives people tasks, tells them what to do and like, pays them do it.
00:29:24.527 - 00:29:34.703, Speaker A: So, like, we're talking about, like, much further. So I think there's a little game and it's. And it's interesting that people are getting excited, but what's coming is like much, much bigger, I think.
00:29:34.759 - 00:29:35.095, Speaker B: I see.
00:29:35.135 - 00:29:51.645, Speaker C: I, I actually just had a, A live telegram submission come in, shout out to Clayton. This meme was generated in the last 30 seconds. The first domino rem, the amazing song Losing My Religion, and somehow we've gotten to a meme coin about a goat's anus becomes the world's reserve currency.
00:29:51.985 - 00:29:57.241, Speaker B: I don't think it's a goat's anus. Right. I thought it was a man's. But we don't need. I mean, the point.
00:29:57.273 - 00:29:58.525, Speaker A: Let's not get into it.
00:30:03.185 - 00:30:23.185, Speaker C: Like, narratives come about and like, yes, to your point, people are looking for a sense of meaning. And you do get this cult, like, feeling being in a community. I felt it, like, it feels great. Right. But like, these, these narratives are fleeting and I, I find it hard to believe that on a balance of probabilities, this narrative will be around in a couple years. That's just me, though. I don't know.
00:30:23.185 - 00:30:32.745, Speaker C: I do think it can do well in the short term. Like, I believe, like Jordy says, like, sure, goat could go to 2 billion, which is a 4x from here. I wouldn't be surprised at all.
00:30:33.765 - 00:30:41.851, Speaker B: Yeah, but by similar thought, can't you say, like, Ethereum is a cult and that religion is fleeting in A sense. Like you can make that argument for a lot of coins, right?
00:30:42.013 - 00:30:43.151, Speaker A: Yeah, you can.
00:30:43.183 - 00:31:01.591, Speaker C: But there's a there, there. There is a there there, right? Like there's actually something being built. And like something like there's a goal of delivering value. Obviously it can fail and most likely it does fail. Like, who knows, right? In 20 years, who knows if Ethereum is around? But like, at least you're speculating on something with a, you know, a vision.
00:31:01.783 - 00:31:07.633, Speaker B: Yeah, I, I feel like I'm being brainwashed by Murad after. In the, in the past week. I'm just.
00:31:07.719 - 00:31:24.585, Speaker C: But I think you're totally right, Ty. Like if you want to make money, like the edge right now is finding these things early, getting in like early, which. And we're all. We live and breathe the space, so we do see things early and then getting out before they crash. And like that is the, that is the meta to play right now. I'm just not good at it personally.
00:31:25.525 - 00:31:36.835, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. So, yeah, we can move to the next topic. Sorry. No, I mean, yeah, go for it. Sorry, I'm just so interested.
00:31:38.135 - 00:31:44.383, Speaker A: We'll, we'll, we'll touch base on this next week because it'll be interesting once it has a bit more breathing time and, and then we can evaluate what's going on.
00:31:44.519 - 00:31:48.751, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe this is top signal. I'm so sorry to the. I don't think, you know, gold holders.
00:31:48.823 - 00:32:06.655, Speaker A: I, I think there could still be like a mainstream media arc because this is the kind of story that would get picked up, right? I don't know. Okay. It wasn't Bloomberg already. Okay, so maybe, maybe we're late in the game. Maybe there's not as much exit liquidity coming.
00:32:06.995 - 00:32:07.935, Speaker B: Oh, no.
00:32:09.315 - 00:32:35.189, Speaker A: So, guys, we're close to the election. Let's look at two things. One is the, the markets, the crypto markets, the maybe like a little bit of overall markets. And then we can look at prediction markets as well. Maybe. Let's start with prediction markets. So there has been stir that Trump is accelerating at least on Poly Market.
00:32:35.189 - 00:32:48.985, Speaker A: And we'll talk about maybe this is manipulated or not because some people are telling me it's manipulated. Bottom line, right now it's 60 40, so pretty, pretty big move. Justin, you're the Pennsylvania GCR. What are you seeing?
00:32:49.845 - 00:33:08.651, Speaker C: Yeah, so I've been following this like really closely as I'm sure a lot of people have over the last week. And it's been introduced. Interesting to see what's happened. So if you guys recall, like there was this couple month period where the election was about 50 50. There was consensus on Poly Market. There was consensus on other prediction markets. Nate Silver was bought into 50:50, as were the polls.
00:33:08.651 - 00:33:43.965, Speaker C: And then over the last week, Trump has started to do decently well in the polls and he's now, I will show some polling in, in a little bit, but now he's a favorite by a very little bit, like 50.2% relative to like 49.8% in most swing states or all swing states. Poly Market sort of front ran this. It was the first to start, really going up to 60%. A lot of people, to your point, Jordy, have done some sleuthing here and they've seen who's been the, the large buyers here. And there's this one large buyer called Freddy who's connected to several other accounts that has spent millions of dollars buying Trump.
00:33:43.965 - 00:34:11.639, Speaker C: There's been some controversy over whether that means polymarket is still accurate. We can see here we've got the betting odds on other platforms. The average across all of these other platforms trumps at 58. So poly markets only a little bit ahead of the average there. And then this is actually in contrast to the poll. So the prediction markets are about 10% ahead of the polls as far as Trump goes for his probability of winning the electoral College. This is the Nate Silver model.
00:34:11.639 - 00:34:31.009, Speaker C: You can see it's about 50, 50, a slight edge to Trump. Just this just flipped in the last day or two. But it's interesting to see that the prediction markets are now ahead of all of the polling, which is 50 50. And Nate Silver who is seen as sort of like the canonical truth of where the election actually stands. And yeah, there's a lot of questions.
00:34:31.057 - 00:34:34.953, Speaker A: Prediction markets. Do you have the non poly market prediction markets? Because.
00:34:35.009 - 00:34:48.745, Speaker C: Yeah, so you can see here the averages across all of the others. I think this is probably, yeah, slightly delayed because you can see poly markets at 58 here, but it's actually at 60. But this is probably a snapshot from say yesterday.
00:34:50.365 - 00:35:27.879, Speaker A: Okay. You know. Yeah. So it looks like there's a single buyer putting in millions and millions into betting on Trump. And there's some talk, you know, when I was talking to people around here in San Francisco, they think one, you know, a couple things could be going on. Somebody is obviously just trying to make things look good for Trump and wants to make it look like he's winning and kind of just make it happen, I guess. And then the other one is there could be something with Poly Market specifically where the Oracle can get attacked.
00:35:27.879 - 00:36:22.703, Speaker A: So Eigen Lair said that they're, you know, working on the version 2 of the UMA Oracle, which is kind of what's going to determine who wins. It looks like the version one might have some potential attack vector where you just accumulate a lot of the tokens and maybe make the decision what you want it to be. I think that there's a probabilistic element to whether that succeeds or not. But theoretically, if the value securing the Oracle is less than the, the betting market value, then somebody can interfere. Bottom line, it does look like someone is very convicted on this or making it look like they're very convicted. And we are close to the election. I think everyone's hoping that Gensler is going to be out.
00:36:22.703 - 00:36:31.255, Speaker A: So maybe it's just like a lot of Hopium for us that we're seeing that odds move this way and hopefully it's not just somebody burning $5 million to try to make a point.
00:36:31.295 - 00:37:04.769, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Justin, I know that you are our prediction markets guy and you said you thought a lot about this, but you know, we often heard this argument that, you know, Poly Market leans conservative, so it's always going to favor Trump. But you know, technically, if, if Poly Market is mispriced, then there should be people to like, even it out. Right, because there's money to be made. So do you think that Poly Market is actually efficient and it's ahead of Nate Silver by like a month or like, what's your read on this? Like, what's your actual opinion on, like, what's happening here?
00:37:04.937 - 00:37:33.309, Speaker C: Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on that. The first I'd addressed to Jordy about the resolution market provided by uma. I hadn't heard that before, so it's news to me. I was under the impression that Poly Market as a company has a dispute resolution tool. I don't think it always resort resolves to the UMA Oracle just because the UMA token really isn't worth much. And to your point, like, you could rig outcomes and with $2 billion on this market, it would clearly be profitable to do so. As far as like, if the market's accurate or not, I do think it is.
00:37:33.309 - 00:38:16.563, Speaker C: I thought a lot about it. Even though one person is contributing to a massive run up in Trump odds, you can effectively think that all this other capital, which is the vast majority of it, call it $1.97 billion, is effectively consenting to the valuation that has increased. Because if you bought trumpet, say 40% when he was 40, you could now sell him at 60. And if you're not buying Kamala at 40? Well, you could buy her now at 40 or 38, whatever she is. And to me, the financial incentive here is much more powerful than the bias that we might be seeing towards crypto users. You know, I know a lot of people care a lot about this election, but in my opinion, there's no greater way to show you care and to actually care than putting something behind it.
00:38:16.563 - 00:38:37.319, Speaker C: And to me, I think people would rather be right and make money than be wrong by betting on the candidate they like. So for me, I don't think the bias is really a problem here. I don't think people are voting on who they want to win or buying who they want to win. I think they're buying who they think will win. And I think, to me, the prediction market is probably more accurate than the polls. And we've also seen it lead the polls. Right.
00:38:37.319 - 00:38:39.807, Speaker C: The polling is now trailing behind Poly Market.
00:38:39.871 - 00:38:46.665, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think anyone. I think, like, that's very abc. Yeah, no, no one, no serious person ever thinks that the polls are.
00:38:46.745 - 00:38:49.045, Speaker C: I always see it a lot on Twitter.
00:38:49.825 - 00:38:54.321, Speaker A: None of our listeners are dumb enough to, like, think that the polls are the probability.
00:38:54.393 - 00:38:56.125, Speaker B: We think highly of our listeners.
00:38:56.665 - 00:39:20.253, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, even just if the polls are accurate, the, I think the line for Trump to win is like, he just needs to lose by, like, less than four points, I think, given the, the state breakdown. So he can still lose by four and be, like, the favorite. So, you know, the, the polling, national averages are kind of just, just like, irrelevant and not that important.
00:39:20.389 - 00:39:23.189, Speaker C: So not the national average. We're talking the states.
00:39:23.357 - 00:40:02.535, Speaker A: Even the states. Like, ultimately, if Nate Silver is saying 50, 50, and the polls are saying, you know, even lower, and prediction markets are a little bit higher, of course they're a little bit smarter. I, I, I, I would say that it's not entirely accurate what you're saying. Again, this, this is my space. And one thing that we've seen time and time again is that you need very large financial opportunity to put things back in line. It can't be like, okay, there's a 3% edge for me to make. If I wait one month with my money and tie it to some liquid that that's not going to create, like, an arbitrage that people want to take.
00:40:02.535 - 00:40:11.798, Speaker A: I remember the, There was this big fight between Mayweather and what's the UFC guy? McGregor.
00:40:11.943 - 00:40:12.599, Speaker C: McGregor?
00:40:12.687 - 00:40:13.071, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:13.143 - 00:40:38.835, Speaker A: Where the odds were way off from reality, and it was just because so much money was coming in on McGregor. You can see situations where there's, there's literally just not enough money willing to bet the, the easy. The easy kind of mispricing. So it might, it might be correct. I mean, I think the truth is in the middle. Like, you're right, it's not going to be fully off. It's not going to be 50.
00:40:38.835 - 00:40:51.527, Speaker A: 50, probably Trump is, is like somewhere in the middle. I would guess he's like a 55 favorite. And, you know, it's not worth it for people to pick up a few pennies. So don't you think there is a.
00:40:51.591 - 00:41:02.741, Speaker C: Massive signal here and that, like the polling over the last several weeks has actually trailed the prediction market? And obviously that could be a coincidence, but if that's because the prediction markets are more predictive, then there is huge signal here.
00:41:02.933 - 00:41:21.345, Speaker A: Of course they're more predictive. Of course that's true. Of course, the prediction markets. The prediction markets already take all the polling information and then they add what is like the smart way to add it, you know, the latest kind of on the ground information. So 100%. It's, it's leading. 100%.
00:41:21.345 - 00:41:23.183, Speaker A: That's, that's definitely true.
00:41:23.279 - 00:41:52.225, Speaker B: Yeah. One question I have for you guys is, I've, I've gotten this question too, but let's say, you know, Trump is leading and people want to bet on him winning. Like, what is the correct coin to bet? Like, what sector do you think is, like, the best way to bet on a Trump coin? Is it just bitcoin? Is it like Salana for the etf, things like Doge, bitcoin, cash? Like, do you guys have a thought on what's, like, the best way to express it, or is it like, do we not know?
00:41:56.325 - 00:42:24.263, Speaker A: Obviously, like, we've, we've said that Trump is going to be good for altcoins, while Kamala could still be good for bitcoin. It's not, it's not going to change bitcoin because she's going to keep printing money and so, like, bitcoin will still do well regardless. You guys saw the World Financial ico, whatever, going live. I think the amount they raised was quite a bit below the expectation. Can we, can we maybe bring up some of the numbers there?
00:42:24.439 - 00:42:30.995, Speaker B: I think they raised 10 million out of the 300 that they were looking for, or something along those lines.
00:42:31.575 - 00:42:32.111, Speaker A: Is it.
00:42:32.183 - 00:42:50.225, Speaker C: Let me pull it up. I have it here. It, it is ongoing. They've sold 882 million tokens at a 1.5 cent price and they were hoping to. Or they're still hoping to sell a full 20 billion tokens. So they've sold, you know, a little under 5% of the supply that they wanted to sell.
00:42:51.245 - 00:43:20.943, Speaker A: Are they leaving this live through the election or how many days? Because if he wins, then maybe suddenly, suddenly it fills up. I don't know what the timing on is. We need to check. But anyway, bottom line, it could fill up. It could still do very well. For now. It's lagged the demand that was expected, which is in my opinion just the prevalent thing we're seeing in crypto, that there's not that much money coming in compared to what we're used to.
00:43:20.943 - 00:43:45.925, Speaker A: And it's easy to overestimate how, how much like actual dollars might, might bid something right now. Yeah, there was a n. Your, your comment here wants to want to comment that the FTV of uma is still 345 million lower than Goat.
00:43:47.745 - 00:43:48.617, Speaker C: Wild.
00:43:48.801 - 00:44:03.205, Speaker A: That's a signal. I just signal, Justin, like if you, if you wake up on November 5th and Trump is one or six, I don't know, whenever the election is, is there a, is there a single coin that, what's like the first coin you bring up, is it Ethereum or is it, is it anything else?
00:44:03.795 - 00:44:35.825, Speaker C: For me, it's Ethereum. You know, I, I can't even, I'm just too known as the ETH guy that I can't even say it, but I unironically think Trump winning is most bullish for Ethereum in the Ethereum ecosystem. Trump has launched NFTs on the Ethereum ecosystem. He's launching a D5 project on Ethereum. And then most of the governance tokens that people are not excited about are on Ethereum. And for me, I think Ethereum stands to gain the most. Probably Ethereum and Solana Bitcoin, I think has a little less to gain just because it's so accepted already.
00:44:36.685 - 00:44:40.985, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe it's just bitcoin dominance tops or something. Right. Like as a broad.
00:44:41.965 - 00:45:20.423, Speaker A: I think that's fair. I think that's fair. Trump can bring in a bit of an altcoin season, a little bit of a excesses of the, of the masses, period. So that is, that is possible. I have seen some interesting stalling in other coins, not just eth, and I think, Justin, you, you might, you might start feeling less alone. I, I think that some of the other major coins are reaching a similar thing to eth. If we look at Solana chart, it's kind of been stalling out for weeks and weeks and weeks now.
00:45:20.423 - 00:45:32.731, Speaker A: It's same as ETH has for all year. And I was telling Anselm like this is, this is what Justin, like, you know, this is the Eth holder is feeling. So what you're feeling now is the same thing. And this is, I think this is.
00:45:32.803 - 00:45:49.015, Speaker C: A two part thing. I think it's. Solana has sort of like Solana's actually down from its all time high. It is a similar percentage as Ethereum was. It just went down a lot more and had a lot more room to catch up. But it's still down from its all time high, the same amount. So they're basically like neck and neck there.
00:45:49.015 - 00:46:03.647, Speaker C: And then like the sad thing for Salana, I think the big uphill battle they're going to face is just like there's always going to be a new, shinier, faster chain. Like Sui has obviously been the story of the last, you know, several months and Sui has caught up to Solana, or not caught up, but it's getting there.
00:46:03.711 - 00:46:04.855, Speaker A: Yeah, let's zoom out.
00:46:04.895 - 00:46:07.287, Speaker C: 21 billion. Yeah.
00:46:07.471 - 00:46:08.255, Speaker B: All time highs.
00:46:08.295 - 00:46:37.253, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's an all time high. I, I mean what we're seeing with Solana is what happened to Eth. And then I think what we're going to see to Sui is going to be what, you know, what happened to Solana. There's just an accumulation period and there's a distribution period. And the distribution period basically means that there's all kinds of like big, big holders, big whales that have marked up a lot. And at this point they're kind of starting to lose patience or belief that this thing is going to keep going up forever. And so they start taking profit.
00:46:37.253 - 00:47:01.627, Speaker A: And this is sort of the natural market cycle. And we're seeing this again and again. We're seeing it with bitcoin. I think bitcoin's about to break out for the first time. I think, I do think that we are likely to get an all time high very soon. And it's just because it's earlier. It's like, you know, it's being more distributed, it's, it's front running.
00:47:01.627 - 00:47:35.829, Speaker A: The rest of the, the coins, the rest of the coins will reach a period where, you know, people are distributing and then more people distributed because the more people start to take profit, the less the chart can break out and then people get impatient. So let's say like Taiki has a one month patience. So if like his, if his coin hasn't like managed to break out for a month, he starts selling, which creates more cell pressure. Let's say I have two months, two month patience. So at that point I'm like, well, it's been two months now. So then I start te whapping for a month and by the time I'm done, Justin, who's like been holding out.
00:47:35.917 - 00:47:39.105, Speaker C: You know, two or three months, patient, two or three year patience.
00:47:41.165 - 00:47:49.173, Speaker A: @ some point you. You capitulate. So it's nothing about a specific coin. This is just like the normal market cycle. And I think we are front running it. There's. We're speedrunning it.
00:47:49.173 - 00:47:57.505, Speaker A: Like, I think Sui is going to go through it faster and I think the next one, you know, we'll go through it faster and hopefully more of them break out. Like Bitcoin's about to do.
00:47:58.085 - 00:48:01.421, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Shall we do pasta?
00:48:01.613 - 00:48:02.527, Speaker C: Pasta.
00:48:02.701 - 00:48:13.335, Speaker A: Do pasta. So, Justin, maybe you can kick us off.
00:48:13.795 - 00:48:26.695, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll. I gotta give a little bit of a disclaimer. I'm a big Kyle fan. He was great on the show. I learned a ton. I loved having him. There's this interaction that sort of blew up on crypto Twitter here.
00:48:26.695 - 00:48:47.189, Speaker C: Kyle and the Arbitrum founder have a little dialogue here. And apparently Kyle or multicoin wasn't able to get into the Arbitrum round. So Kyle's, you know, saying here, we've never spoken. And then Stephen post the receipts, hey, guys. And Kyle says, hey, guys, just checking in. We want to roll up our sleeves and help, basically. We want to invest, we'll add value.
00:48:47.189 - 00:48:55.345, Speaker C: We really want to help. And Kyle's like, ah, you got me. Doesn't really change anything about it. I'm lucky. I'm happy. We did get in the round and it's best for you. We didn't either.
00:48:55.345 - 00:49:16.653, Speaker C: And then someone here said they were able to hack into Kyle's phone here and they found his Tinder bio here, his Tinder profile. So Kyle's profile, he's 27, he's got a great AI and generated photo. He looks fantastic here. Selena messages him. Hey, cutie. Hey, what's up? On stage right now, thinking about our future kids. And it's a picture of Kyle on stage.
00:49:16.653 - 00:49:33.343, Speaker C: And Selena says, you're not 27 and you don't like any look anything like your profile picture. And he says, I guess you got me. But it doesn't really change anything. In my message above. And for your sake, and my sake, it's obviously best we didn't meet. A huge chuckle here. You know, it is interesting.
00:49:33.343 - 00:49:48.085, Speaker C: Like, I do wonder how the narrative. Narrative would be different if Kyle was a large investor in Arbitrum. Right? Multicoin has a lot of power with what they say so does Kyle. And we're all just incentive driven. Right? And, you know, it's interesting.
00:49:49.065 - 00:49:59.885, Speaker A: I mean, that was a very creative pasta. You know, making like a Tinder profile. I love it. So it's always, it's always very amusing. Very good one. Thank you. What do you got?
00:50:00.665 - 00:50:25.617, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is after my obsession with goat. I want to have this tweet from Gord and Gordy Ward. I would just like to point out that an artificial intelligence funded by Mark Andreessen was given access to a blockchain and decided the best use case was to launch a token representing a gaping asshole. So maybe we humans actually are using these things correctly. You know, AI thinks this was a.
00:50:25.641 - 00:50:32.225, Speaker A: 10 out of 10. Like, like this is one of the tweets of the year. I just thought, like, this was amazing when I saw this as well.
00:50:32.385 - 00:50:33.977, Speaker B: But it makes so good.
00:50:34.081 - 00:50:38.241, Speaker C: It's not fair to use Gort pasta. We need a, like a temporary ban on Gort pasta, I think.
00:50:38.273 - 00:50:44.649, Speaker A: So I've been using Gort. That's how I've been doing it every week. I've been using Gort coins.
00:50:44.697 - 00:51:03.525, Speaker B: Go up, creates attention. And if an AI wants to create attention for itself and gain more power, then it's a self reinforcing loop, right? So maybe it goes to zero at some point and then we have like 20, 25 pump with Jordy's thesis. But this is a test pump. At least a test pump.
00:51:03.825 - 00:51:25.829, Speaker A: All right, you guys got your goat. Your goat bull here. So I'm going to use my other go to. Since you took ward, I have bodleianitis. And there was a tweet by OpenSea. Somebody said, NFTs are dead and OpenSea said zoom out. I don't know if it's like an intern there or.
00:51:25.829 - 00:51:28.305, Speaker A: Who wrote this. NFPs are dead.
00:51:29.685 - 00:51:31.861, Speaker B: This got community noted. What the heck?
00:51:32.013 - 00:51:35.465, Speaker C: Yeah, they're down 95% and many consider them dead.
00:51:36.635 - 00:51:38.455, Speaker B: Oh, my God, that's brutal.
00:51:38.835 - 00:51:55.775, Speaker A: Holy. Yeah, so I don't know. I don't know what the intern meant. Like, did he mean like, zoom out? Look into the future. Let's look at the 10 years into the future where NFTs are going to pick back up. But somebody just brought up the chart of the last, you know, three years and it doesn't look good.
00:51:56.835 - 00:51:59.095, Speaker C: Zooming out only hurts. Zoom in.
00:52:01.435 - 00:52:17.803, Speaker A: Yeah. So I love these cartoons. Everybody should follow boldly and itis for a daily cartoon. They're always very native and very good. Cool. We'll let you guys vote. And thanks for hopping on for a live one.
00:52:17.803 - 00:52:25.451, Speaker A: Hope you guys enjoyed it. Bit of a quick one since Justin's running off to a flight, but we will catch you guys next week. Take care.
00:52:25.643 - 00:52:26.155, Speaker B: Thanks, guys.
