00:00:20.360 - 00:00:28.078, Speaker A: Welcome to another episode of Steadylads. That intro does not get old, so we're pretty pumped up right now. Justin, I know you've been traveling as well. What have you been doing?
00:00:28.166 - 00:00:52.936, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm actually fortunate enough to stay local. So the all in summit for all in podcast listeners, which was a little bit of an inspiration for this show, held a summit here in Los Angeles. Brian Armstrong gave an amazing talk yesterday. We had some other notable speakers. Elon Musk spoke, Ray Dalio spoke. It was just a great experience. I was fortunate enough to run into some steady lads listeners.
00:00:52.936 - 00:01:17.548, Speaker B: I actually met a Jordy Thicke and Tyche Maxi, respectively. I didn't meet a Justin brand Maxi. But for those that said, hi, if you're watching this, it was a pleasure meeting you. It was great meeting folks in the blockchain and crypto space. Unfortunately, the crypto sector was overly represented by scammers, so I didn't run into a hex scammer. Called him out in person at a party, which I'm proud of.
00:01:17.636 - 00:01:22.308, Speaker A: Did he respond that he's in the arena, so, like, you should back off, or what did he say?
00:01:22.436 - 00:01:46.836, Speaker B: His response was interesting. He basically of said, well, isn't everything a Ponzi when you think about it? And, you know, the way he legitimized. So he has a business card that's like a poker chip. I'll try to bring it later and show everyone. But, yeah, he was like. I was like, so why do you think Hicks is legitimate? And his whole thing was like, I just. I just pitched Brad Gerstner on Hex, and I was like, oh, my God.
00:01:46.836 - 00:01:50.942, Speaker B: You're just totally misrepresenting our industry, just making us look like fools.
00:01:51.028 - 00:02:01.574, Speaker A: Yeah, he's like, using the Richard Heart playbook, you know, comparing things to bitcoin. Well, you know, what's the difference with bitcoin? If you're okay with bitcoin, then you should be okay with this thing. It's the same thing. Good luck to him.
00:02:02.074 - 00:02:13.522, Speaker B: I did. Did want to run a little trivia. I'm curious, does any of you on this right now know who this is that I have a picture with? It's kind of a nerdy question. I can start giving hints.
00:02:13.698 - 00:02:16.694, Speaker A: It looks like no real Rubini in, like, ten years.
00:02:18.134 - 00:02:22.782, Speaker C: That's neuro. That's Rubini. When bitcoin hits 100k, once bitcoin hits.
00:02:22.798 - 00:02:27.038, Speaker A: 100K, this is what new real Rubini is gonna look like now.
00:02:27.086 - 00:02:38.398, Speaker B: I guess no one knows. Okay, so this is Stephen Wolfram. So if you've ever used Wolfram Alpha. This is the guy. He gave a talk as well. Pretty nice fellow, always at the parties, having a good time.
00:02:38.446 - 00:02:41.006, Speaker D: So you recognize him immediately? Justin?
00:02:41.110 - 00:02:49.092, Speaker B: I didn't know who he was. Well, I knew who he was. I didn't recognize him. He gave a talk, and then I was. I know the name Wolfram. Right. So I wanted to say hi.
00:02:49.188 - 00:03:13.954, Speaker A: So I have a little conference picture selfie as well. But I'll leave that for the end of the show so our viewers can hold on for that one. Meanwhile, obviously, it's been a bit more volatility in the market, I think a bit more downside, but maybe we're steadying. I'm definitely concerned, and I know you're concerned. Thiki, I wanna look at this issue of the overhang supply and what's going on with the FTX estate. I know you've been looking at it closely.
00:03:14.074 - 00:03:48.680, Speaker D: Yeah, I've been looking very closely at like, the amount of supply hitting the market over the next one or two quarters. And like, my. My takeaway is that, like, things, you know, aren't looking so good just in terms of the supply side, obviously. Like the FTX estate on the 24 August announced that they were going to start liquidating all their assets at around $100 million a week. And they had roughly, you know, $600 million of BDC and ethanol. They have around 400, $500 million of grayscale trusts, and they have a billion dollars of soul and like, three to $500 million of associated alts.
00:03:48.792 - 00:04:09.444, Speaker A: Let's talk about that billion dollars of flow quickly, because, like, that seems to be such a huge number compared to the liquidity for altcoins in a billion dollars is. I don't know what price somebody would get if they tried to execute that know, in a week or in a couple of weeks.
00:04:09.984 - 00:04:26.432, Speaker C: Do you think it's possible for. I also heard discussions on Twitter around, like, creating like, a governance proposal to just burn FTX soul holdings. Like, do you think that has legs? Like, do you think that's acceptable by crypto standards? Or do you think it's like, what do you guys think about that?
00:04:26.528 - 00:05:05.488, Speaker A: Super interesting. Yeah, there is a lot of examples, actually, not just them, of companies that lost tokens to FTX and that could just get super dumped on, especially the ones that had certain agreements with FTX as to how, you know, when those tokens would get sold or what were their, you know, specs around, around the purchase that FTX made. And those ones maybe have a bit more of a say. But these people in charge of the estate have a lot of firepower behind them illegally, and they will be, like, blasting lawsuits to anybody who tries to prevent them from. From their access to selling.
00:05:05.616 - 00:05:24.256, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree. And also, like, I think from, like, an ethical standpoint, it would be fine if it, like, belonged to just FTX and SPF, but I mean, at the end of the day, this money belongs to the creditors, which is like, you know, just like people like you and me. So cutting them out of something like this might not be, you know, the most reasonable thing to do, but, yeah.
00:05:24.280 - 00:05:54.046, Speaker A: Going back to my question, like, a billion dollars of Solana seems like. I don't want to be pessimistic, but I can see it, depending on how it's executed, being a single digit check coin, I mean, it could get there. You know, I love to Solana family, but, you know, they put a lot of the tokens in the wrong hands. And if someone's going to liquidate it in any period of time, that's less than a year, I'm not sure where the selling pressure is going to go.
00:05:54.150 - 00:06:31.508, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like it's similar to, like, the curve situation where we all know that Mitch has a big supply of CRV. And no matter what you think the fair value of CRV is going to be, CRV is not catching a bid, and it's back to the 40 cent OTC price. And I feel like it's more of a supply demand question, where if you know that there's this much supply that's going to hit the markets eventually, then why would I buy? That's kind of because crypto is so based on sentiment psychology that I have no inclination to even touch Sol, aside from a short term trade.
00:06:31.596 - 00:06:47.156, Speaker A: I mean, let's look at, I mean, think you compare it to CRV. So CRV, he managed to raise, I don't know, 45, 50 million on a token that was also worth, I don't know what the market cap was at time, but it's like, in the billion single digit billions, right?
00:06:47.300 - 00:06:53.668, Speaker D: It was like five to 8 million. So around, like a five to, like, 12% of the supply was sold OTC.
00:06:53.796 - 00:06:59.224, Speaker A: Okay, so with Solana, like, what's, what's your expected impact on that?
00:06:59.724 - 00:07:18.014, Speaker D: Yeah, so there are estimates on, like, most of it's actually locked until 2027 or 2028. So there's actually only maybe 200 million of, like, free circulating supply that can be sold into the markets today, which makes it a little bit better. But, yeah, 200 million is quite a bit of money, and it might have like a, you know, like a nonlinear effect on how it affects markets.
00:07:18.124 - 00:07:24.586, Speaker A: So you think the locked tokens do not get sold, or you think they get sold OTC to VC's or what do you expect?
00:07:24.730 - 00:07:47.616, Speaker D: So the Solana foundation actually has to, like, they've done this before where they actually have to manually, like, unlock the tokens so they can be transferred for locked tokens. I think they did it with jump before. So it seems like Solana foundation has to agree to, like, you know, allow the sale for it to happen. It's unclear whether they'll allow it or not because they could just say, like, no, you got to keep it. And, you know, when it unlocks, that's when you can sell it and transfer it.
00:07:47.720 - 00:08:16.588, Speaker B: So do you actually think we're going to possibly see the opposite reaction that the market might be expecting? Because I do feel like these pre telegraphed moves in some ways get priced in, or, like, the pessimism has already, you know, like, everyone that knows that this is, everyone knows this is going to happen. It's not news. Right. Of course, there's some, like, debate over whether it actually happens, and to your point, if Solana lets it happen. But are you possibly, like, taking the other side of the trade and swimming upstream here?
00:08:16.716 - 00:08:30.924, Speaker D: I think in trad markets, like, you know, it's a bit more efficient, the price is in better, but I think in crypto, especially this year, time and time again, like, it's just so dumb. I just feel like, you know, these things actually just get sold and people get dumped on and the price goes down, like, pretty much as you'd expect them to.
00:08:31.044 - 00:09:09.586, Speaker C: Yeah, there's, like, no capital, right? Like, there's so much limited capital, so little, like, capital left in the markets that if there's even, like, $50 million with the salt pressure for a particular token, there's no way for the markets to absorb that. So I do think it's going to go down, but there might be squeezes here and there, but I just expect tokens like CRB and just slowly grind down until there's some huge catalyst. Maybe Solana, their phone takes off, or there's some mass consumer app that launches on some gaming app. Until that happens, I just don't really see, like, a sustainable bid for, like, these types of, like, heavily inflation, inflationary tokens.
00:09:09.690 - 00:09:29.218, Speaker B: So. So, Jordan, Thicke, can you guys walk us through what you think would happen? Um, let's assume the creditors receive these tokens and they do want to sell. Would they find an OTC buyer, sell it, like, a very significant discount and then that OTC buyer would slowly sell over the course of let's say 30 days. Like what do you guys expect would happen here?
00:09:29.306 - 00:10:10.814, Speaker A: We've had multiple instances of OTC purchases happening. We saw the sui thing that happened which was in my opinion one of the most absurd OTC sales because it literally launched the next day at ten x the price that they had done the deal at. But these creditors don't really seem to be very sophisticated. We talked about the three AC creditors who just let the starkware warrants expire, even though if they spent 50k they would have gotten 50 million worth of warrant value. So the sophistication is very low. They're very aggressive legally. We saw what happened to layer zero, which was shocking to me.
00:10:10.814 - 00:10:41.294, Speaker A: They are going after them in all kinds of ways because they tried to rebuy their equity from FTX as it was collapsing. So it's hard to predict. Sad reality is they're trying to maximize their fees and make things as complicated as possible. It's sad. You know, it's ultimately, it's not PvP. It's like Pvl. You got, you got the lawyers crushing the players and it's very one sided.
00:10:41.594 - 00:11:03.224, Speaker B: So Jordy or Thikki, would either of you guys be like, would it be in your interest to like be reaching out to the creditors? And I'm curious, Jordy, if like Salini Capital is looking into this at all like trying to reach them, saying, I don't know, maybe it's true, like you're willing to buy sol at a very large discount and swap out over the next x amount of time. Is that something you're looking into?
00:11:04.084 - 00:11:27.808, Speaker A: So there's a few tokens that I could be interested in, like DyDX. There's some locked DYDX tokens that some of the creditors have that's potentially interesting at the right price. I think for tokens that already have a price, it's harder for, for things that are equity, for things that haven't like fully listed and that are fully liquid, you can potentially get a steal. But yeah, it's not a space that I'm looking at too actively.
00:11:27.936 - 00:11:58.968, Speaker D: Yeah, I think with regard to the OTC. So galaxy is going to be the one that's going to be like acting as an agent for these sales. And I'm sure they have like an extensive network of people that are willing to buy this OTC. But I do think that like these OTC buyers will, you know, when you're buying OTC, you always want to buy the last tranche and not the first one. Because if you buy the first one, then they're just going to sell it in open market and you'll instantly just eat a lot. So I think we will see markets selling before we see the OTC side. Take the last bit of the clip.
00:11:58.968 - 00:12:35.536, Speaker D: And as I was saying earlier, you're still taking on a trade when you buy these things OTC. So you still have to have some reasonable sort of estimation that the path going forward is going to be good. And there's so much alt supply. It's not just Sol with a billion dollars. There's apdos with like a 200 5300 million dollars unlock. There's DyDx with a huge cliff in December, and then there's dots with like a foreign $50 million amount unlocking soon. And when those things happen, people have to sell alts and they have to sell their ETH and BTC in order to buy these tokens that are like having a massive supply come onto the market.
00:12:35.536 - 00:12:41.848, Speaker D: So I think it'll drag the entire thing down. It just makes it kind of tough to buy alts right now until all these overhangs have cleared.
00:12:41.976 - 00:13:21.668, Speaker B: Can I ask you both a question on this note? So I see a lot of sentiment in this space, that insider is basically short perps and that's how they exit their holdings or pseudo exit their holdings without actually being unlocked and able to sell. And I've all sort of like adopted the position now that you can't really quote unquote beat the market in that way. Right? Like you're still, when you short the perp, you're still making a trade and make like having an opinion on where things will go and you're paying the funding rate. Do you think there's even potentially a way to buy this sole OTC and hedge your position adequately through perps? Or is it just not feasible due to funding rates, volatility, etcetera?
00:13:21.796 - 00:13:55.920, Speaker A: It's definitely not feasible right now. Maybe in the bull market you could do a large. I know for a fact that some of the large VC's were doing that in the bull market. But right now, with the liquidity and the funding rates, good luck. I personally had an option to reach out and buy a bunch of curve and buy it at wait for six months or to a handshake agreement like these guys did. The reason I didn't do it, I just don't really have confidence that you can put on this trade even if you hedge it on perps. And we're paying negative funding rate.
00:13:55.920 - 00:14:08.732, Speaker A: I guess I've been proven correct. I just didn't want to touch it. I think trying to play that game without having full awareness of how exactly you will hedge and how much it's going to cost is a pretty bad idea.
00:14:08.888 - 00:14:47.296, Speaker B: I just pulled this tweet up. I thought it was very interesting. You know, we talked about this on the pod as soon as the deal was struck, and I think we were all a little skeptical that this would work out for the purchasers. I do think a lot of the people that bought Curve OTC were doing it as sort of, sort of like a marketing effort for their brand in the space, like his Excellency Justin sun, and not necessarily trying to profit here. But you can see here, based on this chart, as Taiki mentioned earlier, Curve is now at about $0.40, maybe just slightly below what I haven't checked recently in the last few days, but now everyone is underwater. Presumably they could have hedged a little bit with the perps, but I doubt it.
00:14:47.296 - 00:14:53.856, Speaker B: Right. That must have been an extremely crowded trade. So really interesting. And it sounds like, jordy, you had the right intuition.
00:14:54.000 - 00:15:25.252, Speaker D: I was going to say, like, I mean, as Jordy said, like, when liquidity was much better, like, even in 2022, you know, funding was persistently negative because people were, you know, hedging unlocks, especially VC's. But nowadays, like, if you look at Apdos, for example, there's like $70 million of OI, but there's a $200 million, you know, unlock coming in three months. Like, there's just no feasible way someone could actually hedge that amount with perps without, like. And funding is already, like, negative 40% a year. So if you wanted to hedge that full amount, it'd probably be, like, max funding negative, and it'd just be totally infeasible.
00:15:25.388 - 00:15:36.320, Speaker A: Definitely. I mean, I'm curious what will turn this around when we feel like there's going to be another bull market, probably next year. Is the earliest right bitcoin happening? Maybe, yeah.
00:15:36.352 - 00:16:05.092, Speaker C: This is like a question that I wanted to ask everybody. Like, there's this meta, or, like, there's like, this understanding that, you know, every four years, crypto just pumps because of the having. But I think as there are more havings, the effect of this, like, the disinflationary supply becomes less and less. And do you actually think that the next halving can catalyze a bull market, or do you think it's going to be something else? And what, like, what do you think is, like, the probability that, like, bitcoin sees all time highs in 2024 and 2025, like, you know, coinciding with that four year cycle.
00:16:05.188 - 00:16:36.614, Speaker B: So I traditionally don't believe. I don't believe that the halving can have that big of an impact, going from 2% to 1% inflation. I think everyone's sort of on the same page there that's following this, that it's more narrative driven. And we can kind of see this with ETH, right? ETH over the last two years has drastically changed the supply dynamics with 1559 and the merge. And, you know, you could, you never know what the other outcome would have been. If that didn't happen. Maybe ETH would be massively down BTC, but we've already seen it hasn't really outperformed BTC.
00:16:36.614 - 00:17:18.376, Speaker B: And there's something going on that's much more than just supply dynamics and tokenomics. So I think we're all here probably on the same page, that the actual supply increase, change, or supply decrease is not really that relevant. It's just a narrative. And for me, like, fundamentally, it's very hard for me to get excited about the idea that the narrative will stick when the fundamentals aren't there. And so I don't think the having is really relevant. But I think some of the other things happening in our space, like the ETF that we've sort of talked to, talked about to death now, as well as, you know, regulatory clarity coming in the next couple of years, as well as, like, other innovations, I think that's what will trigger it. I think the halving is just sort of, like, coincidentally there.
00:17:18.480 - 00:17:44.712, Speaker D: I think from the pure flows perspective, like, at 2% a year, inflation, bitcoin is around, I don't know, five to $7 billion of emissions a year. So if you have it, that's like another three. You can view it as like $3 billion of inflows. And it really depends on how much you model. Like, the ETF inflows will be like. If you think that's going to be like 10 billion or 15 billion, then you can estimate that from a pure flows perspective, like a halving is worth maybe a third or a fifth of an ETF approval.
00:17:44.848 - 00:18:26.102, Speaker A: I do think it's still significant from two to percent to 1%. I would disagree that we're already there. I agree that by the next one, going from one to half, and then after that, going to half to quarter becomes less important. But the other thing, I would note that I had an interesting conversation with Ola from polychain. And he has seen a lot of cycles very closely for many years. And he just said it so calmly that crypto is just so reflexive, that it's very natural that we get these four year cycles just purely based on people all exiting together and all entering together. And this sort of wave taking around.
00:18:26.102 - 00:19:02.196, Speaker A: Four years is quite a normal amount of time. Even if there was no bitcoin happening, I think we would still see a similar amount of time between people getting excited and overdoing it and then kind of getting completely wiped out and starting from scratch and rebuilding that hype. So I do think next year will be a big year. Once the overhang comes out and there's a free supply opportunity, I think we can have a pretty big halvening period, which isn't say that the halving will be all of the reason behind it, but it will help actually, right now.
00:19:02.300 - 00:19:48.906, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think one thing to keep in mind is that I think the traditional media, like Bloomberg, CNBC, they're all conditioned to cover bitcoin havings every four years. And they all have these pundits talk about, oh, yeah, I'll buy bitcoin at the bottom at the four year cycle and I'll sell it when it gets high. And I think it's something that people expect and it is narrative driven. But I do think that if it is reflexive and everyone's entering, everyone's going out at the same time, maybe it does have an effect. Do you guys think it's possible for bitcoin to peak out before the halving and then just kind of wither away? Or do you think it's going to be like, Jordan, you said it's going to be a big year. Do you think the havings meets all the news? It wasn't 2020, and then we're going to see a massive run up in q three, Q four into 2025.
00:19:48.906 - 00:19:52.324, Speaker C: Is that the shape of the cycle that you think will happen?
00:19:52.474 - 00:20:36.660, Speaker D: So, yeah, and this is going back to what Justin was saying where, like, the ETH upgrades this year would cause ETH to turn deflationary and, like, you know, reduce a lot of supply coming in the markets. And this was a huge narrative going into 2023 that, like, ETH BTC would do really well. And we saw like, a big pump of 10% that instantly got faded, you know, after a month and then into the, you know, upgrade, we also saw another, that's the second blue box. We saw another 10% pump that got faded. And then the month after we saw another 10% pump that got faded again. I mean, the day, like, with, with the ETH upgrade, it was just like, people who are crypto native that really care about this, but maybe there wasn't enough money to sustain a pump. And the big question for this bitcoin happening is, like, it does seem like a more of a compelling story to, like, new money as opposed to just crypto native money.
00:20:36.660 - 00:20:39.964, Speaker D: But the biggest question is, like, you know, will it sustain? Will it continue?
00:20:40.124 - 00:21:13.946, Speaker A: I just realized that I haven't seen anybody talk about the ETH BTC chart in like a year or two. It was all I was seeing, like, in all my telegram chats everywhere on Twitter, ETH BTC charts and people kane, everybody talking about it's going to break out or it's going to do this, and no one's talking about it right now. Which makes me think it's more interesting, because Ethereum, for me has always been not money. It's a community money. It's a new form of money that we haven't really seen before. Well, Bitcoin maybe is a little bit more of gold and hard money. Ethereum, I've coined this, this phrase a while ago.
00:21:13.946 - 00:21:36.414, Speaker A: It's like community money. And in a sense, if the community's poorer, people are having to sell coins just to maintain their project and get Runway for all the things that they're building, and they have their. Their personal wealth and their treasuries, everything in ETH. So maybe that's part of the reason why the chart has been going down despite the disinflationary advantage.
00:21:37.314 - 00:22:09.334, Speaker B: I just want to point out, I mean, it's so tough to say, right? Because in 2018 and 19 ETH, BTC went down to, I think, point between 0.01 and 0.02. It's four to five x higher than that. Now it's about at 0.06. So it's so tough to say if, you know, the tokenomics change and the supply change could have had a huge impact, and ETH would have been down so much worse relative to BTC if that didn't happen. Or the flip side is like, it was a nothing burger. The moderate differences in supply, one to 3% here and there, doesn't actually matter, and the narrative matters more.
00:22:09.334 - 00:22:18.710, Speaker B: So I'm still on the fence of if the supply chain for youth actually did anything. Obviously, you will never know, but, yeah, super interesting.
00:22:18.822 - 00:23:02.440, Speaker C: Like, what you said, jordy, was really interesting to me. It's like, maybe EBTC as like, the barometer of, like, the net worth of, like, the average crypto individual, that kind of makes sense, to be honest. I think a lot of people in crypto, I feel like if you enter, when you first enter crypto, you get in because of bitcoin, and then you discover ETH, and then you kind of like can't get out of that rabbit hole. And a lot of people denominate their portfolio or their net worth in Eid. So if people are making money, then they will rotate profits not into USDC or tether, but into ETH. So if everyone's losing money, then it makes sense for eid BTC to just go down only. And if we're going to see mass unlocks for alts, maybe EBTC is going to just keep grinding down and it's going to take some huge catalysts to take us out.
00:23:02.592 - 00:23:22.114, Speaker D: This is something that we've modeled quantitatively. If you regress the returns of altcoins versus bitcoin and ETH, like, the amount of returns that ETH explains over bitcoin is like two to three x higher altcoins are mostly have a correlation to ETH as opposed to bitcoin. So this community money thesis makes sense.
00:23:23.174 - 00:23:51.738, Speaker A: I'm ultimately very bullish, both of those. I think the demand will eventually, hugely outstrip the supply. We're not quite there yet. I think it's going to take some time for, you know, as we've talked about the absorption of the supply first and eventually the new demand to come out. And for the demand, we just need people to start by being comfortable with holding their wealth digitally. And even that basic thing hasn't fully happened. All the hacks that we're still seeing are scaring off people.
00:23:51.738 - 00:24:31.396, Speaker A: I think we need, first of all, you know, very simple account abstraction for seed phrases, wallets, custody. These things need to get a lot more safe and a lot simpler. And secondly, we need the kind of products that will bring people in and make it sustainable, but also worthwhile for them to keep their money online. Obviously, RWAs are a hot topic, and I think getting good products and good yield online is something that will make people more comfortable holding their financial lives on chain. And once they do that, there's a lot more liquidity, a lot more accessibility to buy ETH, to buy bitcoin, to buy another token.
00:24:31.500 - 00:25:31.988, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I was listening to a podcast with Tushar Jain from multicoin, and he said that he doesn't think that DeFi or NFTs can enter the next sustainable bull market until people are being paid on chain. And I think this trend towards consumer apps with Frontech, and maybe having other creators onboard things like Frontech denominating some of their income in either. Maybe that's going to compel them to create digital wallets, maybe save some money into Aave or buy RWA stablecoin like tokenized treasuries. And, yeah, it's something that I'm really closely tracking. I think the 2017 and the 2021 cycle was led by mass hyper speculation. And I think the average retail participant is just tired of ponzonomic elements. And I think if we're going to see like the next bull market, we have to see like a couple dozen consumer apps that people actually use on a daily basis that actually affect like, the livelihood of people in the real world.
00:25:32.076 - 00:26:06.938, Speaker A: Another thing we're hoping to see for another bull market is a little steadier regulation. Right now. We're seeing all kinds of lawsuits all over the place. I mean, the SEC has been losing a bunch, which is good. You know, they've definitely, in my opinion, been, you know, crossing the boundary of what's reasonable. But we're still seeing crazy lawsuits and sometimes against what we've talked about as being not necessarily like evil players. And one more NFT lawsuit after the, the one we talked about last time, there's stoner cats, which I remember was Ashton Kutcher and Vitalik doing some, some cartoons.
00:26:06.938 - 00:26:14.430, Speaker A: So apparently this is something that we have to make sure that we enforce. What do you think, Justin?
00:26:14.542 - 00:26:33.118, Speaker B: Yeah, I missed, I just shared the tweet here. I missed that Vitalik was sort of affiliated with this. Pretty interesting to see. I mean, I think the headlines we're seeing on Twitter are a little bit dramatic relative to what happened. So it's not great. But they got fined $1 million. As far as I could tell, they raised eight.
00:26:33.118 - 00:26:40.322, Speaker B: So theoretically there's still capital here if they want to continue to build or pay out ecosystem participants. Oh, I thought they had to return.
00:26:40.378 - 00:26:42.786, Speaker D: The eight and then 1 million top.
00:26:42.930 - 00:26:57.730, Speaker B: I guess my source could be wrong. But if you look here, they say correction. Apparently the below means it's a $1 million fine. So 8 million not being returned. So yeah, here's the official press release from the SEC. I definitely recommend folks, folks, take a read. It's very interesting.
00:26:57.730 - 00:27:39.126, Speaker B: I mean, I definitely think there's something there, right? Like you are having celebrities, influencers, etcetera, promote these assets as pseudo investments. So I don't think this is at the same level of egregiousness as the SEC saying, going after GBTC, right, like that's. Much more legitimate. GBTC definitely should be an ETF. It's better for everyone here. I actually think, like, you can steal man the case and say the SEC is actually trying to protect consumers. I don't think they're necessarily going after the right collection, but I do think there are certainly some projects that are basically just pump and dumps, and they're sort of like, promoting themselves as an investment vehicle.
00:27:39.126 - 00:28:10.056, Speaker B: I think we need consistent rules. I don't think enforcement by litigation and action is the way to do it. I think we need clear guidelines so we know what's right and what's not right. But I also do think, like, if I'm steel Manning, the SEC's case here, and I think we have to be reasonable and look at their side. If there are people promoting something as a pseudo investment, there probably needs to be some clarity and regulation there, or at least I understand their position, whether I agree with it or not. So I don't think this is as egregious as what we've seen before, but I would be curious to hear what you guys think.
00:28:10.160 - 00:28:46.548, Speaker A: I mean, I think this is showing that the regulation is wrong. Like, they might be following the rules and looking at Howie and looking at the three criteria. And yes, the people behind stoner cats were trying to get hype and talk about why it's going to be a good project, and, you know, there's important backing behind it, and that's great. But ultimately, we're talking about, you know, an $800 purchase that's letting you watch some cartoons. No one is being protected or harmed. This is all bullshit. Ultimately, yes, they do potentially have to enforce it because that's the way their law is written.
00:28:46.548 - 00:29:21.824, Speaker A: And I'm not saying they're doing a mistake in terms of legally how they're going about it, but they could have focused on 100 other things. There's much worse things happening. And this is showing to me that the people who are going against the securities laws by just trying to be very careful around the language they use, but ultimately, they are trying to, like, you know, show something to retail. They're just being very careful around how they do it. Those are worse actors than the ones that are maybe being a little bit careless with a few things, but there's clearly, like, no bad intention.
00:29:22.124 - 00:30:00.450, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I would like to actually refine my answer more aligned with yours. Like, I. I think they're not necessarily doing the wrong thing because they're actually following their mandate here, but it shows that the regulation is wrong to your point, Jordy? Because, like, I just fundamentally agree with you and agree with the premise that, like, if you've earned your money in a legitimate way and you're not doing anything sort of nefarious, like, you should be able to spend it how you want, right? Like if, if you're on you chain and sophisticated enough to know like how to buy a cool cat, you generally like, have an understanding, like, okay, this could be a rug. This is just pure speculation. This is just fun. Like, I'm just looking for another buyer after this. Right, to sell to.
00:30:00.450 - 00:30:16.514, Speaker B: So I agree. People should entirely be allowed to speculate on whatever they want to speculate on provided that it's moderately legitimate, which I think this was. So I agree with you. I think the regulations are wrong, but I think this is less egregious from the SEC's point of view than some of the other cases.
00:30:17.214 - 00:30:45.882, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, you're saying earlier you think. I think they chose the wrong project to do this on because there's been plenty of cases where like, you know, they kind of sell you the world. They're going to say, like are they part of some celebrity? They said they're going to do like giveaways or buybacks and they just completely rug the protocol, delete the discord. And like, Zach XBT has done a very good job just like tracking these guys down and like finding out where the money's gone. And like, this wasn't like a clear rug. I think, like, in terms of how bad things go, this wasn't near like the worst one they could have done.
00:30:45.978 - 00:31:10.566, Speaker A: We talked about hex before and talked about this guy giggle around and Hex is exactly what I'm talking about. You have something that is clearly predatory, an awful product. And they can say, well, no, it doesn't abide by security's law because it's just code and it's out there, therefore it's not a security. And to me, that is 100 times worse than somebody trying to make a cartoon and, you know, sell like a pass to it.
00:31:10.670 - 00:31:36.714, Speaker B: So is it in the marketing more so than the fundamentals, right? Because like the fundamentals of hex and basically, like any NFT collection that's just a collection of pictures, right. Is basically the same. Right. So to you, it comes down to the marketing then if hex is promoting it as this sort of world class investment that's going to make you rich and earn you a high yield, whereas these NFT collections presumably aren't, at least not that degree.
00:31:36.834 - 00:32:14.874, Speaker A: Definitely the marketing matters and even sort of the intention, and it's hard to be very objective about someone's intent. But at least when you prioritize suing one project over many others, it's good to take it into account a little bit. I think the SEC has tried to do, like, meme viralness. We saw Gensler suing Kim Kardashian and then going on video and telling us how Kim Kardashian is, did something wrong, and he's going after her sort of pr, which is very strange for a government agency to be trying to do.
00:32:15.034 - 00:32:39.322, Speaker C: We also saw, like, the CFTC go after Defi. Like what? Like, reasonably. Like, when do you think all these regulatory clarity, like, when do you think we'll actually see, like, regulatory clarity, like, for crypto, like, whether it be Defi NFTs or like, other crypto assets, is it reasonable to expect in 2024, like, us businesses and us devs can create products that we'll use? Or do you think it's going to be, or do you think it's going to take longer than that?
00:32:39.458 - 00:32:41.122, Speaker A: It's definitely going to take longer.
00:32:41.258 - 00:33:23.652, Speaker B: I think it could be quicker than we expect if the election goes all towards the right side, which I think is pretty unlikely, but I think it's very disagree is actually pretty important as far as regulation goes. I think if the Democrats, and this is like an apolitical statement, but if the Democrats sweep, I think that we're just going to see continued enforcement and pressure and that we'll basically head down the path or even go further down it. I think if there was a republican sweep, I think we would see a lot more innovation regarding crypto, for better or worse. And something like a split outcome, like, where we're at, I think, is just the status quo continues on and we have this sort of, like, uncertainty overhang for the next several years.
00:33:23.738 - 00:34:04.528, Speaker D: I mean, it definitely seems kind of like a geopolitical strategy in the sense that, like, you know, defi projects and, like, an alternative financial system, these things, like, as, like, at least like a citizen of the western world with, like, a very advanced sort of, you know, infrastructure built out for that. It doesn't really move the needle much in terms of adding efficiency, but it does add a layer of, like, oh, like, my citizens, like, retail savings can be extracted by pretty much anyone in the world with an Internet connection. So from the US perspective, it kind of makes sense that, like, okay, fine, we'll sacrifice some innovation on this front, and we'll protect our retail from getting fleeced by these potentially malicious sort of schemes that are going on. What do you guys think about that?
00:34:04.616 - 00:34:44.454, Speaker B: I think you're probably right in your assessment, but I think the government is wrong in its assessment if what you're saying is true, because I think like the power of the stable coin and US dollar denominated yields, whether it's like on chain treasure treasuries, on chain equities, on chain real estate, like these are all very bullish things that would benefit the US's economy drastically more than anyone else's and provide more power to the dollar and the systems we've built. So I think you're right in that. That's their assumption. But I actually think the right framework here and taking a responsible approach would be extremely good for the US and our economy and our systems. But yeah, I'd be curious to hear the counterpoint as well.
00:34:44.574 - 00:35:26.084, Speaker A: I think they're aware of what you said, Justin. There's no lack of understanding from the core power of, you know, the United States. They're very well of the role of dollar and how this potentially can help them in certain ways. But Vicky, I have been feeling this so strongly that there is this geopolitical game going on, especially with how they're choosing to go after certain protocols and tactically playing it. I was on a panel today, you know, I'm in Asia and people are talking on a defi. It was a huge defi panel with like Roon and Cain, all these people. And the talk was about how let's just wait until the US collapses and the next empire comes down and maybe the next empire will be better.
00:35:26.084 - 00:36:11.622, Speaker A: People are looking at like the Roman Empire analogies and it's telling. I think ultimately the thing that will hopefully bring lighter regulation in the US is going to be demand from actual citizens. And the demand will come when there's good products, prices are doing well and they feel like they're not allowed to participate properly in an ecosystem that the rest of the world has embraced. So that's why I say, like, I don't think, you know, next one, two years, we're going to see something dramatic. But if there's a great improvement in sentiment around Defi, around some of these products, then eventually they will have to go where the voters are wanting them.
00:36:11.638 - 00:37:06.538, Speaker B: To go just because it's so topical and related to what we're chatting about now, I'm curious if you guys have any thoughts on Adam Cochran's thread on this sort of inside information that CZ has done something very egregious and criminal, possibly related to Russia and that the US is preparing those charges and it could be very significant for finance. I'm curious if you guys have anything you want to share there, if you've heard of anything or if you think this is just sort of that meme of, I'm hearing things in the crypto space and people are always sort of like tweeting these headlines sort of as bottom signals. But yeah, I'm curious, like, also to the regulatory question. Jordy, like, do you think going after CZ and going after binance is more because there's something really there? There's a they or there, there's fraud, there's crime, something like that, or it's just political finances in a us company, they don't have a clear headquarters or jurisdiction that they operate in. What are your thoughts?
00:37:06.626 - 00:37:43.594, Speaker A: Definitely feel that there is a very close tracking of what money is going to Russia, what money is going to North Korea, and how to stop those flows happening. And indeed, for North Korea, it's a significant amount of money for their GDP. It is a big deal. We don't want Lazarus to keep topping up their yearly budget with, you know, hackingstake.com or whatever they're able to do. These things are serious in that way. I mean, we've seen any time that North Korea comes up, people end up in jail for, you know, even going to talk to them or it's a sensitive topic.
00:37:43.594 - 00:38:00.548, Speaker A: And I get it. You know, I was just in Korea last week and seeing how close we are to nukes, being able to just go and attack Seoul. You know, people got used to it. They live there and it's part of the part of life. But when you look at it from a fresh eyes, it's a big deal.
00:38:00.676 - 00:38:39.460, Speaker B: I agree. It scares me significantly because the more software is deployed on chain, the more bugs there will be. All software has bugs. It's just sort of like an inevitability. Hopefully, we have some new innovations around security that can help. But in my mind, I could see this continuing, unfortunately, and it's sucks, but this continuing to be a greater and greater revenue source for bad actors like North Korea. Just because if we think more TVL is coming on chain, if we think more applications are being built, certainly they're going to invest heavily in their hacking infrastructure, right? I mean, they're seeing, they can make a lot of money here.
00:38:39.460 - 00:38:51.846, Speaker B: They don't have to worry about dealing with any other countries. They could just sort of like run this Lazarus group internally. And so I think, I think it's going to continue an increase, unfortunately. I mean, I hope we can stop it, but I don't, I don't know what we can do.
00:38:51.910 - 00:39:15.550, Speaker A: I mean, the best thing we can do is try to get them to spend their hacked money on Friendtech shares. You know, get them. Get them excited about some products so that they, instead of using it on nukes, they spend it on e girl shares and keys. So with that smooth transition, guys, let's move to our next topic.
00:39:15.742 - 00:39:16.806, Speaker D: That was amazing.
00:39:16.910 - 00:39:54.656, Speaker C: So I guess I can talk about this because I think I've been one of the most active people, at least amongst the four of us, on Friendtech. And there's a really interesting dynamic going on where, you know, I mean, you see erasers, keys. Who's the founder of Friendtech? If you go to the chart, Justin, and you kind of zoom out, you can kind of see, like, the entire picture of how his keys have performed. Yeah, it's literally up only. And there's, like, this meta where in the next six months, Friendtech is going to distribute 100 million points, which will lead to some type of an airdrop. And we just started months, too. And the way to get more points is to just hold a bigger portfolio value of keys.
00:39:54.656 - 00:40:21.838, Speaker C: So there's, like, right now, people think it's plus ev or have a positive expected value to just buy expensive keys and hold. And racer, like, his keys are up only. Other influencers, like Kobe. Justin, not Justin. Kobe and Ansem, like, their keys are up only. And, like, literally, because everyone's buying and not selling. Like, I think it's pretty much impossible for someone to not be up money, at least in terms of paper wealth.
00:40:21.838 - 00:40:29.926, Speaker C: Of course, this has to change at some point. And it's kind of similar to, like, the three three meme when it kind of, like, ohm happened.
00:40:30.030 - 00:40:41.750, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw that there's a friend friend score at the bottom. Friend, comma, friend. So it's. It's trying to say how much people are holding each other's keys, or what is this friend friend score over here?
00:40:41.822 - 00:41:03.240, Speaker C: Oh, it has 4%. I'm actually not sure what that means, but I think there's this new Twitter account that came out of nowhere, and he was able to grow his audience to 20, 30,000 followers by just buying everyone else's keys. And that way he basically purchased popularity that way. There's a pretty interesting element happening with Friendtech.
00:41:03.342 - 00:41:11.300, Speaker A: So how are you guys doing? I still haven't signed up. I guess I'm the odd one out. I'm curious, you guys who are in the arena are experiencing.
00:41:11.412 - 00:41:27.304, Speaker B: Here's sticky here. A market cap of 65k, which I think is pretty good, and a key price of 781. So quite expensive to see what you have to deliver. Thicke, are you providing a lot of value for your chat, or is this just people sort of buying and selling and speculating?
00:41:27.604 - 00:41:36.226, Speaker D: I'm not really talking that much. I don't know. The app actually stopped working for me, like, a week ago, so I haven't actually been able to log in.
00:41:36.290 - 00:41:45.374, Speaker C: Yeah, I can confirm as a tickie holder that he has provided zero value to me, but I'll still continue to hold just so I can farm the airdrop.
00:41:45.754 - 00:41:48.834, Speaker A: It's still a bullish part. We have, like, a bull flag going on here.
00:41:48.914 - 00:42:02.150, Speaker D: It's a bull flag for sure. I think the friend friends score is, like, of the people that hold you, how many know of them do you hold? So I think that means, like, 3% of people that hold me, I hold, which is basically, I think, just one person. There's 33 holders.
00:42:02.302 - 00:42:03.150, Speaker C: Interesting.
00:42:03.302 - 00:42:13.902, Speaker B: And it looks like your diamond tier, so you have 9422 points, which is pretty good. I think I'm just under 2000. We'll see in a second. But you must have been buying a lot of keys, right?
00:42:13.998 - 00:42:20.154, Speaker D: I've only been buying my own keys at the very beginning. If you see that big, big run up, that's. That's me.
00:42:21.894 - 00:42:22.766, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:42:22.950 - 00:42:24.510, Speaker A: Dustin, let's see where you're at.
00:42:24.622 - 00:42:56.974, Speaker B: I'm a little embarrassed, honestly. I was thinking of having Brad edit this one out or alter the key price, possibly. Yeah. I'm in a $7,000 market cap and a key price of 177, and that's all due to me doing buybacks. So you can see here that over the weekend, I just did a little bit of a buyback, and I told everyone, if you want to sell, you can dump on me, but I'm just doing this for fun. And people listened and they dumped on me. So peaked at about 250 down to 152.
00:42:56.974 - 00:43:06.358, Speaker B: I think I'm going to continue the buybacks, potentially, because it was fun and people seemed to like them, but I'm not doing well, and this is pretty, pretty embarrassing.
00:43:06.486 - 00:43:11.874, Speaker A: This is an awful price. This is a Burj Khalifa kind of situation here.
00:43:12.174 - 00:43:17.474, Speaker B: There's no ta we have that makes this look bullish. There's no, like, bull flag or reverse headed.
00:43:19.144 - 00:43:25.080, Speaker A: This is awful. Are you. Are you talking in the chat? Are you interacting moderately?
00:43:25.152 - 00:43:49.318, Speaker B: I mean, I'm saying I'm responding when people write messages. I'm not doing the sort of three three thing that, that everyone's been talking about. Although, you know, I buy shares of friends and people I like, but, yeah, and you can see, I mean, my points sort of reflect that. I'm sadly just gold with only 1700 points. So I don't think I'm going to make out either on my keys doing well or on getting a big airdrop. So I might be the only person Tykee that is losing on Friendtech.
00:43:49.446 - 00:43:59.270, Speaker C: But your friend friend score is 34%. Like, that's, that's something to be proud of. Like, you're very loyal, you know, like thick. He's not that loyal. You know, like Justin. Justin's very loyal.
00:43:59.382 - 00:44:16.278, Speaker B: Yeah. You guys sell your thickie keys and buy Justin Keys. Thick, he's not talking the chat. He can't even get the app to work. His friend friends score is low. He's literally just farming you for airdrops. If you sell his coins and buy my Justin brand keys, that's the way to have real value, not financial advice.
00:44:16.278 - 00:44:17.754, Speaker B: Don't actually do that.
00:44:18.174 - 00:44:38.504, Speaker A: I'm sorry to say this to you, but you're that kid in class who is like, doing his homework for 10 hours, coming in class prepared, and, like, getting like a 75 on the test and think he's that kid who doesn't even study the night before. He's like, you know, playing video games all day, doesn't pay attention, and just like, gets a 95. So that's the reality.
00:44:39.004 - 00:44:40.156, Speaker B: It's killing me.
00:44:40.260 - 00:44:41.484, Speaker A: Taiki, how about you?
00:44:41.604 - 00:44:41.956, Speaker C: Okay.
00:44:41.980 - 00:44:45.544, Speaker A: This is, this is respectable. This is healthy. This is.
00:44:47.564 - 00:44:49.264, Speaker C: Oh, there you go.
00:44:49.644 - 00:45:10.232, Speaker A: This is a great, great pattern going on here. So your price is $600. So for any listeners out there that want to grab a taiki key for $600, and I'm probably going to get sued by the CFTC for even mentioning that. Now, are you providing value tyche?
00:45:10.328 - 00:46:03.184, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm actually posting there every day. I don't really know how to create value. I don't really promise anything, but I'm just giving my takes on how I'm planning friend tech because I downloaded the app day one or day two, I deposit 0.1 ETH, and now my portfolio is like 13 ETH or something, which is pretty insane. And I've been playing around with app a lot, and I think there's this meta where you're being rewarded for just buying keys early and just holding just because there's little reasons to bridge out of the application because of the airdrop feature. And every day new people are entering and I think manifold trading is going to implement like the anti bot features that like, or the anti sniping bot features that you're afraid of. And I think that can onboard, like bigger profile people.
00:46:03.184 - 00:46:20.300, Speaker C: And I think that like once that happens, that can be like reach, like a, like the first top, maybe like when Machu Big brother, like onboards and like sweeps everyone. Maybe like that's like the end of like the first peak cycle or hype cycle. But I think any dip that happens for keys like should be bought. I think leading up to the airdrop.
00:46:20.332 - 00:46:57.754, Speaker A: Is, I mean, I have seen some big guys. I thought high six cap was saying that he's made keys now and that, and then the next bull market, he's going to be sharing charts and sharing some stuff there. But I'm curious, Tyky, I mean, out of all of us, I would say you have the most experience with this type of stuff because I remember you were very close on some of the games that were going on the jewel and some of those early similar games, right. We were kind of like farming points and play to earn stuff. Do you see some similarities with that? And is that experience helping you with getting this kind of return?
00:46:57.874 - 00:47:25.824, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I just try to be on chain all the time and try to experiment with new things like jewel. I just bridged the harmony when no one did and I just randomly farmed two dexes and one of them just happened to be Defi kingdoms. And the game didn't really end up working. But, you know, it was like crazy. It had like a crazy run of like $20 or something. And I think you just have to understand like this for what it is like. Yes, it has a lot of potential.
00:47:25.824 - 00:48:09.310, Speaker C: Social tokens kind of make sense. Creators are making a bunch of money. Like, if you just like, look at it from like a rational perspective, it is technically like a negative sum game where, you know, you have to pay 10% fees to go in and out. Right now, things are only going up because of the aerodrop farming program. And I think the way I view it is I think in the first couple of months, the first one to three months of the airdrop campaign, people are just going to be buying and holding keys to maximize their airdrop points. But as more TVL enters the system, as we near the end of the airdrop program, month four, five, six, I think there's going to be less incentive to hold these keys and I think we're going to start to see boom bust cycles. But I think anyone that's still paying attention to crypto like, I think it makes sense.
00:48:09.310 - 00:48:24.166, Speaker C: Like, just at least try it out. I think it's definitely, like something with potential. And like, my mental model is like, just farm this as much as possible. And when the token comes out, I'll probably just dump, like, dump it into ether or something. Like into the hype.
00:48:24.270 - 00:48:56.124, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, at this point you've gone through enough market cycles that you're probably thinking, okay, at some point I do need to exit. It's not going to be up only forever. So I'm sure you have it in your mind and I'm sure our audience will be curious when that happens in the future. But let's move to our last segment. Pasta of the week is the one we'd be doing last week, but some of our viewers have specifically requested that we do another degen of the week that was an early favorite that we might need to bring back. So with that, Justin, have you done anything djing lately?
00:48:56.984 - 00:49:22.252, Speaker B: I think you already saw it in the chat. So I did. Over the weekend, I announced to my friend tech share, or key holders, excuse me, that I was doing a one ETH buyback of my keys at the time. This was a, and still kind of is a huge buyback. I think my keys were like 0.03, embarrassingly enough, 0.02. So I don't know how many shares of myself I have now, but, or keys, but I think something like 30, 35.
00:49:22.252 - 00:49:37.284, Speaker B: Unfortunately, the previous holders all dumped on me. And that's totally cool. That's sort of why I wanted to give them that option. But that was my dj play of the week. So I like Tyche's line of, you know, you always get a bet on yourself and that that's what I'm doing here.
00:49:37.404 - 00:49:40.104, Speaker A: Thank you. Have you, have you degenmed lately?
00:49:40.444 - 00:50:15.308, Speaker D: One could call this DJ and another could call it schizo, but yeah, I've been going through like hundreds of documents of FTX bankruptcy case proceedings. As soon as a new entry pops up, I get like, alerts in the middle of the night that wake me up and I just, you know, go to my phone and then just read through all these documents to make sure that I'm not missing any important details. But yeah, like, important stuff, like, you know, how much they can sell, in what manner they're going to sell, when they have to provide notice to the courts to sell that kind of stuff. Just so I can, you know, properly risk manage my short positions that I've taken on.
00:50:15.476 - 00:50:20.704, Speaker A: That's pretty DJ. I mean, having phone alerts for FDX doxxed.
00:50:21.084 - 00:50:39.526, Speaker B: It's absolutely brilliant, right? Like, Vicki's in there making the market efficient, right? He's fulfilling the efficient market hypothesis because who else is doing this? You know? You know, there's so many. The delays in crypto are insane from when news breaks to when the price is impacted, and that's because of people like Vickie. So I think it's brilliant.
00:50:39.670 - 00:50:40.754, Speaker D: Doing my duty.
00:50:41.654 - 00:50:47.406, Speaker A: This is a very solid, very solid play takey. Are you going to be able to match up to that?
00:50:47.510 - 00:51:22.116, Speaker C: No, I don't think I can compete with the asian quant here. But what I've been doing is I've just been reinvesting everything into my friend tech key. Not buying my own keys, but, like, I've just been, like, grinding. Like, I've been, like, tracking, like, new launches, as in when it comes to, like, new accounts, making keys, trying to buy keys early without using, like, sniping bots. Like, one time, like, I just, like, swept, like, this, like, new alt account that I thought was, like, someone's alt account. And, you know, I'm like, just buying and holding these keys. Like, I'm like, everything I make on friendtech, I'm just gonna reinvest.
00:51:22.220 - 00:51:29.284, Speaker A: So there's actual speculation now on alt accounts, joining and trying to buy the keys of somebody because they might be somebody else.
00:51:29.404 - 00:51:54.756, Speaker C: Yeah. So, like, I found this account. It was called. I'm not gonna share what it's called, but people started buying it, and I was like, why are people buying this? And then I went to, like, the person's twitter, and the mutual followers were like, osaka Cl, zach, XBT, like, all these, like, big names. I'm like, okay, like, this is for sure someone's off the account. So I bought these keys, like, 0.01 and now, like, six of them, and now it's like, 0.4,
00:51:54.756 - 00:52:21.630, Speaker C: and now I'm the top holder. So I have to figure out, how am I going to sell this thing? It's kind of cool because with friendtech, you know exactly who owns what supply. So there's, everything's very transparent, right? When it comes to shitcoining and altcoining, you never really know who holds what and where and how much and when they're going to dump. But at least with friendtech, it's like, oh, yeah, Tyche holds six keys of this person. Like, if he sells, then the price will dump, like 20% or something. So I think that's kind of, like.
00:52:21.662 - 00:52:38.014, Speaker B: Wholesome for the audience. I think Tyke and thickie's keys that all of this bullishness has already been priced in by the market. I think the move here is to convert those keys to Justin Brown. Keys, not financial advice. But I have no bullishness priced in right now.
00:52:38.134 - 00:52:40.502, Speaker D: Never buy the laggard, only double down on winners.
00:52:40.558 - 00:52:43.874, Speaker C: That's winners. Average winners, right?
00:52:46.114 - 00:53:45.274, Speaker A: All right, well, Justin, I mean, key buybacks, I think is a solid two out of ten, I'm sorry to say. Taiki okay, buying alt account, you know, based off potential followers, it's like a four out of ten. And Thiki, I think you're far and away winning Djen of the week, although I have to say, I have met one dj this week who possibly surpasses you. So I had an amazing encounter here in Singapore at the conference. My favorite person of the moment, Mister Grachev, has hinted that he may indeed in the next week or two appear on steady lads, his debut. So if you in the chat can hound him on Twitter and make sure you encourage him, I think we have a very healthy shot now of getting him on very soon. That'll be a very exciting episode.
00:53:45.274 - 00:53:53.654, Speaker A: That should bring a lot of new attention to our podcast. So looking forward to that.
00:53:54.234 - 00:53:58.506, Speaker D: How is he in person? Is he as intimidating in real life as he is in his online Persona?
00:53:58.610 - 00:54:24.364, Speaker A: He has this goofy movement, he has a very casual demeanor, clearly is not scared of anything and anyone, and looking forward to sharing it with our audience hopefully soon. So if you guys are excited by that, make sure that you show some support on Twitter and I think we can get them on. So we'll leave it we'll leave it there for this week. Keep steady, lads, and talk to you soon.
