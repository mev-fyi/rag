00:00:20.400 - 00:00:41.554, Speaker A: Welcome to another special episode of Steady Lads. I'm Jordy, CIO of Felini Capital. Today we have with us Justin, the CEO of Astaria. We have Aiki, the humble farmer. And now he's a full time researcher as well. And unfortunately, thiky was with us. I'll take the blame for him missing.
00:00:41.554 - 00:01:12.318, Speaker A: This time I slept through the alarm. So we had to choose Jordy or Thiki, and this time we chose Jordi because I have a special guest with us. So I've invited Alvin from Vertex protocol. Alvin is usually spending his time locked up in the basement coding, so this was a rare occasion to get him out in the world and actually interact with the man behind the. What I consider to be one of the best code bases in the centralized exchange space. So, Alvin, thanks for joining us.
00:01:12.486 - 00:01:19.588, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks. I'm very happy to be on. This isn't a curtain, by the way. It's just wall painted over. This is a basement.
00:01:19.766 - 00:01:20.056, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:20.080 - 00:01:35.224, Speaker A: Like, when you spend too much time in the basement, like, you're. You're. You have to kind of trick yourself that you have access, your freedom. You know, like, oh, there's a window behind me, but you're saying there's actually no window. This is just like, your mom put something down to. To make you feel like, you know, you're, like, a real boy.
00:01:35.344 - 00:01:46.444, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So it's, like, very important to just stay in the basement or to be motivated to write better code, you know? Darius tries his best, so keep me locked up, and it does wonders.
00:01:46.564 - 00:02:11.588, Speaker A: So, for those of you who don't follow alwyn on Twitter, and I think, unfortunately, there's many people, you're, like, under followed account. And I remember when we met some months ago, you asked me to follow you, and you're like, okay, now I made it. Jordy's following me. So I think I have enjoyed following you. So you have this quote in your bio. You say that. Were you the youngest employee at jump? Is that something that you.
00:02:11.588 - 00:02:12.220, Speaker A: Right.
00:02:12.332 - 00:02:24.264, Speaker B: Yeah. So I joined jump crypto full time when. Yeah, I was 18, so I dropped out of college quite early, and then I spent some time working, and then I ended up working at jump as a software engineer.
00:02:25.124 - 00:02:30.420, Speaker A: You dropped out of college after, like, a month or, like, how when you're 18 or.
00:02:30.452 - 00:02:56.598, Speaker B: Okay, after a month. So when I was. Yeah, when I was in high school, I was, like, very conservative, so I was very pro Trump. So I actually ended up going to the United States Military Academy at West Point for college. So I spent a month at military school. It was like boot camp. So, yeah, I ended up dropping out after that, and, yeah, ended up just working in tech, and then there was.
00:02:56.598 - 00:03:08.138, Speaker B: Ended up going to jump. And then, like, one fateful day, someone by the name of SJ convinced me to quit my awesome career in trading to ruin my life and live in a basement. So here I am today.
00:03:08.266 - 00:03:09.234, Speaker A: How long were you at jump?
00:03:09.274 - 00:03:17.498, Speaker B: You said so. About six months. So between April of 2021, just like September of 2021.
00:03:17.626 - 00:03:24.974, Speaker A: And you started coding when you were, like, three years old? Or how did you manage to have the skills for joining jump at that point?
00:03:25.314 - 00:03:54.458, Speaker B: I think I started coding when I was, like, 15. So I went to a pretty nice high school in New York City, and they had, like, this mandatory programming course. So I remember taking that, like, second semester of my sophomore year in college. Sorry, sophomore year in high school. And, yeah, I really liked it. And then I ended up teaching myself some, like, random bullshit over the summer, and it's, like, sort of snowballed because I was, like, just really bad at school. And this is, like, a cool hobby that, like, you know, my parents wouldn't like, you know, like, look at me, I'm, like, asian.
00:03:54.458 - 00:04:03.504, Speaker B: So it's like, if they see you coding on the computer, they're not gonna, like, beat you with, like, a belt, but, like, if you're, like, playing video games, they will. So that's how I got better at coding.
00:04:04.044 - 00:04:11.340, Speaker A: You're. You're a good replacement for thicky. He's usually our asian quant here, so to have you here instead.
00:04:11.532 - 00:04:20.524, Speaker C: Were you at a wormhole during the exploit? When. Wormhole, I think it was a few hundred million dollars, but jump ended up paying that out of pocket.
00:04:20.684 - 00:04:37.934, Speaker B: No, I had left wormhole, like, a couple. Sorry, I left jump, like, a couple months before that. But I did write some code for wormhole. Like, you can see, like, my commits in the repo. It was not my code that got exploited. I remember reading about the exploit and going like, please don't be my code. Please don't be my code.
00:04:37.934 - 00:04:39.414, Speaker B: It wasn't.
00:04:39.954 - 00:04:54.908, Speaker D: What was it like? Just dropping out of college, joining jump, and then just. I mean, it seems like you're not really afraid of risk. You're taking this unconventional path. Tell me how. Tell us, like, how does your brain work, like, when it comes to, like, jumping through these opportunities?
00:04:55.066 - 00:05:19.576, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm, like, incredibly retarded. Like, I just, like, it's just like. Like, I try to do, like, what's. Like. It's just sort of, like, the most fun path, honestly. And then like, I do, like, run the expected value calculation or whatever, but, like, yeah, I think, like, since I've left college, it's all been, like, I'm, you know, try to have the most experience.
00:05:19.576 - 00:05:39.748, Speaker B: Like, put yourself in situations where, like, you learn the most, and it's, like, gradually over time, like, you sort of just accumulate more responsibilities and, like, there's, like, pros and cons to that. Right. So, like, the pros is, like, you get to, like, be popular on Twitter and have, like, jordy follow you. The con is that, like, you live in a basement, so it's like, you have to wait.
00:05:39.916 - 00:05:45.384, Speaker D: What did your parents think about you living in the basement and just coding for this obscure crypto project?
00:05:45.764 - 00:05:53.564, Speaker B: Dude, my parents don't care. Like, they just, like, they saw that I wasn't, like, a doctor or a lawyer, and they're like, you're dead to me.
00:05:55.344 - 00:05:56.724, Speaker D: You get no sunlight.
00:05:57.104 - 00:05:58.444, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:05:58.824 - 00:06:00.864, Speaker C: I mean, and you're 21, right?
00:06:00.984 - 00:06:02.624, Speaker B: Yeah. Wow.
00:06:02.744 - 00:06:22.832, Speaker A: Do you have. I mean, we've talked a little bit about, you know, your code in the past, and, you know, I know you love to ship stuff, and I'm quite impressed with how quickly you shipped you. Do you manage the other engineers? Do you just let somebody else manage them and you just do your code? How do you actually. Because you're the CTO, right?
00:06:23.008 - 00:06:56.520, Speaker B: Yeah. So I've managed engineers before, so I've managed teams from zero all the way up to 30. I don't really like management that much. I prefer to spend a lot of time coding. And at Vertex, we sort of adopted this hiring stance where we just hire, like, pretty smart, like, self motivated people and just, like, try and, like, piece together, like, okay, what does the company need, and what will these people find interesting? And, like, sort of just try and match it up. So I haven't had to do, like, a lot of management. Like.
00:06:56.520 - 00:07:19.216, Speaker B: Like, our engineers will literally go up to me and be like, hey, these are the things that I think we should do. I'm gonna start working on them. Let me know if, like, we should. I should do something else. So it's like, we just, like, hired pretty well, or. I wouldn't say pretty well. We've made a bunch of bad hiring decisions, but we've made great firing decisions, and we've kept the good ones, so.
00:07:19.216 - 00:07:31.204, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, overall, don't really like management that much. Still do it a bit. Spend a lot of time coding a lot of time, like, writing out specs and designing stuff, like, architecturally. So it's like a Mix.
00:07:31.624 - 00:07:33.844, Speaker C: How big is the team at Vertex now.
00:07:34.164 - 00:07:53.104, Speaker B: So I think it's around, like, I think, like 16 people. Okay. Like, the team that I primarily work on, which is just like, all of, like, our Back End infrastructure, like the matching engine, stuff like that. Right now it's LIke four people and then, like, maybe like eight people or something. It's quite small.
00:07:53.524 - 00:08:11.172, Speaker A: I would have to say it's probably the equivalent of, like, 103 people, because I'll win it, as far as I can tell, you know, and I have experience with these things. Alwyn is like 100 x engineer, so you get like three people plus Alwyn, 103. It's not too bad. You can ship quite a lot of stuff. You guys are one.
00:08:11.228 - 00:08:11.596, Speaker B: I mean, let's.
00:08:11.620 - 00:08:36.542, Speaker A: Let's talk a little bit about the competitive landscape. So I was looking at the Masari report. They put a report a FeW days ago, and it's impressively, like, you know, in some WAys up to date. So whoever out there doing the Masari research, you know, kudos to you. They're even referring to the $1.5 billion day that you guys had a few days ago. So it's definitely up to speed, obviously.
00:08:36.542 - 00:09:20.872, Speaker A: Any derivatives report, usually in the last few years. We'll start with DyDX, and I think that might change over the next months as you guys have been doing incredibly well. So we see it starts with what's been the market leader, I would say until recently, this has been DYDX. And then we look at this perpmac purpex. Here you guys are in that middle kind of hybrid column. I think this is like, a decently comprehensive piece here. And one of the cool things about you guys shipping from the beginning was you really went for the FTX style portfolio margin.
00:09:20.872 - 00:09:46.040, Speaker A: I don't think many of these, maybe Avo has some of that. Maybe a few of these have elements of that. But was that technologically something that you had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to do this kind of portfolio margin? And I think the centralized exchange experience, competing with that experience potentially is quite important to have that.
00:09:46.192 - 00:10:04.464, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, it wasn't that tricky. There's a lot of great products out there that we were able to half copy, half, like, take inspiration from. So, like, one really good product on Solana that has. That is mango markets. So they have, like, cross margin across. Yeah. Across, like, spot and features.
00:10:04.464 - 00:10:22.676, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they're, like, fantastic product. It's like, pretty sad what happened to them and how, like, a lot of things wind it down, but they were like a pretty big. Yeah, pretty big inspiration. And, like, a lot of the elements of ARD risk engine come from stuff that they've worked on.
00:10:22.860 - 00:10:46.248, Speaker C: Could we talk a little bit about incentives? Because something Massari sort of calls out here is that vertex is volume, and to open interest ratio correlates with incentives. Can you just talk through your thinking about incentives and, like, where you think you guys will be heading with that? And if incentives are like one of the largest drivers for perp adoption, or if you think there's something else going on there that people, like, are actually craving these products.
00:10:46.396 - 00:11:16.756, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, like, incentives are just like a really expensive marketing strategy. The thing is that, like, everyone in crypto, like, sort of uses them. So, like, it's. It's kind of hard to be trading on an exchange that has, like, plus ev trading. Yeah, I mean, like, we have incentives. A huge part of our, like, if we did not have incentives, yeah, our volumes would not be nearly as high. But, like, at the same time, like, you know, it gets a lot of people to use our product and it's just a great marketing strategy.
00:11:16.940 - 00:12:23.856, Speaker A: I'm happy to, like, talk about this because something I've gone through the first version of DyDX all the way through, and I've probably spent more time than any in human alive on going through an incentive of Dex programs. I would say, like, we've seen this with, I remember when DyDX came out some years ago, and once the token's live and the token gets priced and people see that, okay, the monthly token emissions are worth this much, you're fighting over this pool, and the amount of volume will start to at least as a floor, kind of like the trading fees will start to at least match the emissions. And then usually you kind of go above that. And what you see was like a very successful token launch, like Vertex just had last week, their TG. After seven months, the market has to catch up to the dollar value of the emissions because it's suddenly like, oh, shit, they're releasing, let's say, 1% of the supply. That's like $5 million. So everyone just kind of jumps in.
00:12:23.856 - 00:13:12.034, Speaker A: And with DyDX, we saw this growth hack be quite successful. And this is quite different than what we see some exchanges occasionally do, even centralized exchanges, which is fake volume. So, like, fake volume will be like when the exchange itself is sort of like sort of self matching on the inside and doing this kind of stuff just to make the numbers look big. So this is very different than that. This is like actual independent firms paying fees and just trading really competitively. And the good thing about what that does is it creates, like, a frenzy to be, like, super tight and super thick when you're quoting on the inside. And that actually in turn creates the best trading experience for users and funds because it gives the most competitive pricing.
00:13:12.034 - 00:13:35.922, Speaker A: So, yeah, I saw this open interest stuff as well. And open interest is the sign of potentially large funds that just put on basis trades the buy spot and the short perps, but not necessarily having to be representative of actual daily trading volume.
00:13:36.058 - 00:14:33.700, Speaker B: I think that the open interest will gradually creep up over time as we onboard more retail users and onboard bigger funds. One thing I do want to address, you mentioned exchanges, printing trades and stuff like that. We actually have a pretty sophisticated set up to, like, just monitor stuff like wash trading and like, that type of manipulation. So, like, you know, I think, like, every single day or something, we, like, run a script that, like, creates a graph of all the trades and, like, finds the strongly connected components. And, like, we very actively, like, blacklist watch traders from rewards. Yeah, it's just that, like, farming trading is like, a different activity from watch trading, but, like, you know, obviously, like, you'll see a lot of, like, accusations and stuff like that get thrown around based around Oi and stuff and, yeah, it's like, pretty good advertising for us, to be honest.
00:14:33.892 - 00:15:00.112, Speaker D: Do you think, like, you're trying to in a way, like, vampire attack DyDX through, like, having a new token, having these incentives and, like, this is a question for Jordy too. Like, what do you think about, you know, the, like, dodx V for my hero day? It's kind of clunky at least. I mean, they just launched, but, like, how do you expect, or, like, what's, what's your plan for vertex to compete with DoidX and just slowly siphon away, like, a bunch of volume and liquidity?
00:15:00.248 - 00:15:37.076, Speaker A: So, like, DyDx V four is sort of like a different type of product at this point. So fully on chain. You know, it's this, like, wild experiment of trying to do what serum did but, you know, do it properly and not just have, like, Alameda. Like, I think Alameda was losing like, fifty k a day or one hundred k a day trying to trade on serum and just dumping money. Meanwhile, this token has a FTV in the 50 billion or something. I remember when my FTT account was giving me these locked serum rewards and I was checking the FTV on it. It was something insane.
00:15:37.076 - 00:16:24.664, Speaker A: But DyDX has taken the brave route of saying, okay, we're just going to go in that direction. So you have a centralized matching engine. And I'm sure Alvin can describe this a little bit, which is traditional exchange, and it's very efficient, super fast, very fair. That's the most important thing. Like, it's a fully fifo, you can, to the microsecond, just get people fairly in line versus DyDXv four and the serum style where you're relying on the order book from the validators. And there's no objective order book, like, who was there first? They can just kind of like, obviously there's a lot of mev that comes into play. So you're exchanging, like, neutrality in the sense of, like, there's no matching engine that decides it's decentralized.
00:16:24.664 - 00:16:51.304, Speaker A: You have that, but then you're giving up the ability for, you know, bad actors to take MeV. And DyDX is in this, like, style of let's just go and try it, and hopefully we can social slash people and kind of force them in line to not take advantage. But it's quite a double handed sort of double edged sword. How do you think about it, Alwyn?
00:16:52.884 - 00:17:37.812, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, I frankly, like, I just don't think that, like, raid aid and l one's like, work. It's just like, if you look at it from the perspective of someone that wants to trade, right, you'll have just worse. Market makers will have a much harder time making thin markets. Sorry, thin spreads on Dy DX. And then as someone who's trying to trade on it, you're just going to get a lot worse execution. And then, like, what they get from decentralization is like, maybe the probability that you get rogged is slightly less. Like, it's just from, like, a product perspective, it's just not that great.
00:17:37.988 - 00:18:22.960, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I would agree. Like, you have, you have the ethos of crypto, of, like, trust nobody you can do. You can verify everything on chain. The matching engine can't do anything fuzzy, and you're fighting against a product that works. I mean, DyDx V three has been working great. They haven't been even been working on it, you know, for a year because they've been just trying to ship v four, and it's just been plugging away, you know, doing a ton of volume, working perfectly. And it's so weird to, like, see, you know, a company, like, let's say it was Apple or something, just have, like, you know, the iPhone, and they're like, okay, we're just gonna, like, do a completely, like, different, like, redesign and just like leave our blockbuster successful product to go.
00:18:22.960 - 00:18:50.358, Speaker A: And kudos to those guys. I know a lot of things come into play with having this permissionless thing as well, and all the dow and legal and all this kind of stuff that comes into these decisions as well. Let's see how it goes. I agree with you that it makes it a little bit challenging for quoting aggressively and tightly and having tight spreads. Hopefully this social slashing thing will work.
00:18:50.446 - 00:18:57.874, Speaker C: Jordy, can you explain why that would be the case? Why them being on their own chain makes it harder for you as a market maker to provide tighter spreads?
00:18:58.454 - 00:19:49.334, Speaker A: So their own chain part is totally fine. I think it's required just purely for the amount of tps and cheap fees. Otherwise, I think anyone that's trying to do this not on their own chain is losing their mind because you're competing so much for gas every single order. And Alvin maybe can explain the technical side of this as well. But when you have the full spectrum of on chain versus centralized matching, and sometimes you can just match on chain just the trades, you can batch the trades, or you can actually have every single cancellation. And if I just spam the book and I cancel at the back of the queue and it just keep placing and replacing, you can have that on chain as well. But the amount of gas if you're not on your own chain is incredibly expensive.
00:19:49.334 - 00:20:27.246, Speaker A: DydX is fully on chain. You have to do it on your own chain. That's fine. Their design and going cosmos was probably quite smart. The issue is just simply mev. If a validator stakes a bunch of DyDX wins, the blocks can start proposing blocks. Let's say there's like a juicy trade that comes, they can potentially insert themselves and sort of sandwich attack that trade or take advantage of that trade in front of market makers that obviously can be monitored, potentially not perfectly.
00:20:27.246 - 00:21:01.894, Speaker A: You can't perfectly understand if someone's being fair and it's all about latency. Think about it from like, like a FIFo perspective. First in, first out. With a centralized matching engine, it's pretty clear. Like whoever arrives and hits like the gateway, you kind of put them in order. When you have nodes across the world, you never really know who sent their order first because it's a question of which node geographically, where did they reach first and who relayed that first. So that brings in this like the referee can't be objective fully.
00:21:02.014 - 00:21:17.270, Speaker C: This would be a big bull case for their token potentially, right? So like, the more dydx you own, the more likely it is you win a block, which means you can extract more value. And I assume that's part of the value proposition they're offering here, right? Like this is a product, correct?
00:21:17.342 - 00:22:12.380, Speaker A: I don't think it's part of their value proposition, I think it's a side effect and they're probably against it. They would prefer their value proposition to be simply like, you know, people are spending gas. That kind of like burns the token. We can put staking rewards now, like officially as part of this process, you can get some of the trading fees and that can somehow get passed through. I think the MEV extraction is something that even though the Ethereum community and the theorem ethos is kind of like, oh, that's fine, let's give that to the validators and they'll distribute it to Lido and everybody else. Flashbots, all this stuff with a trading. What Alvin is referring to, and you can elaborate, is that as a market maker, it completely changes how tightly I'm willing to quote and it ruins the trading experience if the MeV is too much, because I will start losing money if I'm being taken advantage of.
00:22:12.380 - 00:22:25.964, Speaker A: And so I'll go wider and wider to have this extra safety net and at some point that affects the quality of execution. That's what you're fighting on when you're fully on chain. Do you want to explain a bit, Alwyn, how you think about it?
00:22:26.384 - 00:22:54.344, Speaker B: It's going to be more difficult to trade on if you're placing order. You don't know what happened to that order within a second or something like that. It makes it very difficult for market makers to correctly price assets. And then that's going to impact retail users. They're just going to get worse execution. And even from a UI perspective, just waiting for shit to confirm. It's just not that fun of an experience.
00:22:54.344 - 00:23:14.234, Speaker B: If you want to be an exchange, you're offering two things. One, make it so that people can speculate on what they want to keep your assets safe. I honestly don't think that a new blockchain does either well or better than alternatives.
00:23:14.404 - 00:23:34.954, Speaker C: Yeah, Jordy, I'm curious, like maybe you guys are looking into this or other market making firms that you're connected with, but are any of you guys thinking like, this is your chance to acquire the Dy DX token so you can sort of like own some of the block space on the chain and be a better market maker and make more money that way? Or is that not something you're looking into?
00:23:36.054 - 00:24:24.994, Speaker A: I would say like here's, here's the insight scoop, right, you have this pot of gold that is there, this meV, right, it's on chain now you can start extracting now they're telling you, look, whoever goes and picks up that pot of gold, we're tracking you. They've created a skip protocol, was very familiar with tracking these things, built a dashboard, and they're like, we're going to be watching and comparing your p and l until what we think a fair p and l would be. And if you pick up this pot of gold, we will smack you and we will take all your DyDX tokens that you've used for your validator. So you're going to get slashed. So right now, no one, it's just been launched two days. The rewards and Dydx before have just launched. No one's picking it up.
00:24:24.994 - 00:25:12.394, Speaker A: And from my perspective, I would prefer if it's fair and nobody, I would love to live in a world where this mev stuff just didn't exist and there's no pot of gold. So as a firm, you know, we are like one of the large participants in Dydx. I would say that my hope is like, nobody goes for it and we don't have to play that game. It's a different game. You're kind of getting into the uniswap sandwiching game, which is why I do say Dydx before is just a different product than things like Vertex and Rapidx and all these other exchanges, because it's like uniswap. It's like you're willing to give up the quality of executing up some stuff in order to be like using the fully on chain, decentralized uniswap type of thing. And that's why you're not using something like binance.
00:25:12.394 - 00:25:49.132, Speaker A: You just kind of, obviously, finance will give you better execution than uniswap. The fees are lower, everything else. So, yeah, from our perspective, hopefully nobody goes for it. If they find ways to not get detected and we start detecting it, even though the, the official dashboard that's supposed to be tracking it does not track it, we have to maybe look at competing and staying competitive and doing that kind of stuff. But for now, we're hoping it's not necessary. And the only reason to hold the DyDX token will just purely be for the economics of it.
00:25:49.308 - 00:26:01.450, Speaker C: Well, you are mister game theorizing, and it seems to me that this is just prisoner's dilemma, right? And we're going to see how it plays out. But, like, theoretically someone's going to defect, right? And then it'll be very interesting to see how people respond.
00:26:01.602 - 00:26:35.156, Speaker A: So. Not necessarily. I think if the punishment, if the referee is doing a good job and the punishment is sufficient, I joke sometimes with some of the other market making participants. I'm like, we should stage this like false flag attack to cause like, we don't want anybody to go for this gold. And I'm like, we should just have somebody do something stupid and then socially slash them in a very public way. And we just kind of put in all the news sites that somebody got super slashed just to discourage this from happening.
00:26:35.340 - 00:27:08.744, Speaker C: It's sort of a really tough issue for. I don't know if this is managed by a DaO, it seems like it is, but if you socially slash, you're handicapping the value of the token significantly, right? A very interesting thing. If you take too heavy handed approach, it's sort of like making this like a socialism ish friendly chain, then the token's not worth much, presumably, and then there's going to be less volume, less traders, less activity, less stakers, etcetera. So yeah, it seems like an interesting dilemma, but it's a really fun problem to think about. I hadn't really thought about it that way, so thank you.
00:27:09.204 - 00:28:06.498, Speaker A: I mean, socially slashing can even be bullish. Token. You can take those tokens from somebody, from like a validator and just burn them. And when you slash them and then like, who's going to compete for the coin? Then it's like, you know, the people that are just looking for the economics ultimately, like, I don't know how you see it, Alwyn. The economics of the token come into play, and if there's people trading and there's fees generated and that somehow gets passed on to the token, that is ultimately going to make people buy the token. I think right now vertex has an 80 plus percent apy on staking tokens. So that is very compelling from purely why should I buy this token? Standpoint synthetix, I think, has had this same program for a long time, and their APIs are in the low double digits usually.
00:28:06.498 - 00:28:37.184, Speaker A: I mean, the only other way we've seen tokens be used is something like BNB, where you're sort of forced to hold a token in a certain amount of size in order to get trading fees discounts. That's like a centralized exchange model, obviously. I think even Dydx had something like that in their v three where you had to hold certain number of tokens for extra discounts. Do you think about something like that? Or volume tiers or trying to differentiate the fees, or do you just. So far, you've just taken, like, a flat fee approach.
00:28:37.484 - 00:28:59.064, Speaker B: I mean, like, in practice, like, redistributing some of the staking yield is, like, a fee discount. So, like, if you own, like, I don't know, 10% of the staking pool, that's effectively, like, a 5% discount on your fees. So it's pretty similar. Like, we can experiment with, like, different fee structures, but, like, we're quite happy with the way it currently is right now.
00:28:59.524 - 00:29:17.374, Speaker D: Like, to my knowledge, like, vertex was originally on terra, right? So, like, what was it, like, pivoting from this. Being part of this ecosystem that kind of blew up and then just pivoting to, like, some, you know, some application on arbitrum? What was that process like? I mean, how do you persevere as a builder? Maybe it's a question for Justin, too.
00:29:18.674 - 00:29:59.080, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, it was a lot of work. Ultimately, I think what happened was, like, we went to a lot of our investors and, like, first things first. Like, we totally could have just, like, kept our fundraiser and just said, fuck you. Like, that was totally legal, but we ended up going to a bunch of investors and going like, oh, okay, this thing blew up. If you want your money back, just let us know. And basically everyone went like, yeah, we don't want our money back. And at that point, we had already built just a lot of stuff relating to the risk engine, and we just spent some time thinking about it, and we were like, okay, it's probably not that hard to just pivot to a general perp Dex.
00:29:59.080 - 00:30:32.864, Speaker B: And we think that there's an opportunity here, so we just decided to take it. Obviously, it's really demoralizing when you've been working on this thing for a while and everything instantaneously became useless. We had to fire the vast majority of our team, and we ended up rebuilding a new one from scratch. That one actually ended up being both much cheaper and much stronger. So I'm actually, like, very happy with the way things turned out. And it was just like, a wild ride where, like, I learned a lot. My co founder learned a lot.
00:30:32.864 - 00:30:38.464, Speaker B: Yeah. In terms of resilience, I would just say that we're just, like, as a team, we're just, like, pretty hungry. Like, we want to get things done.
00:30:39.244 - 00:30:49.604, Speaker A: Can you, like, tell. Can you tell people exactly what were you building on Terra? It was kind of different stuff. Like, how did you kind of, like, transpire along that path at the time?
00:30:49.644 - 00:31:36.808, Speaker B: Like, so Terra's l one, and it was like a very special l one because it had, like, built into the l one. There was like the ability to swap between, like, different stable coins. So it wasn't just ust. They also had like, eut krw and stuff like that. So like a stable coin for like, every currency that you could hold, like, without going to jail. So what we wanted to do is we wanted to bring, like, more utility to, like, a lot of these different stable coins because, like, in practice, like, there's probably demand for like, a euro denominated stable coin and like, to have things in euros because Europeans, like, they use crypto, but, like, there just wasn't any liquidity. So what we wanted to start out with was just like set up like a forex perpetuals on terra.
00:31:36.808 - 00:32:23.790, Speaker B: And that would sort of allow people to, like, hedge out currency risk and stuff like that, which would actually make these stable coins useful. So one example of how you could use that is, like, at the time on terra, there was this lending protocol called anchor, which was the most popular protocol on Terra. And effectively it let you deposit ust inside for a 20% APY and with a liquid perpetuous exchange, what you could do is you could allow people to deposit euros into anchor. And what we would end up doing is we would swap those euros into UST, deposit the USD into anchor, and then hedge out that currency risk. So, like, we thought that there is just like a pretty big, like, yeah, vertical for growth there.
00:32:23.982 - 00:32:41.794, Speaker A: Do you still think that there is like, any interest in, like, sort of on chain effects perps or effects things? Or do you think that they're just not that much product fit and the people who are looking for FX hedging just do it with, you know, the traditional FXCM type of brokers.
00:32:41.954 - 00:33:00.730, Speaker B: Like, I think that there's still opportunity. It's just a lot. It's just a lot harder to exploit. Like, terra was really special because you could, like, swap Ust into eut with unlimited liquidity because it was just built into the chain itself and that's not a thing that you get, like, anywhere else.
00:33:00.922 - 00:33:05.186, Speaker A: Was there, like, just to understand the mechanism, like, the way you could swap it?
00:33:05.210 - 00:33:05.514, Speaker B: Was.
00:33:05.594 - 00:33:11.264, Speaker A: Was there like an oracle kind of like, referencing? Was it using mirror or like using some real world price?
00:33:11.604 - 00:33:15.708, Speaker B: Yeah. So you know that, like, mint burn mechanism between Luna and UST, right?
00:33:15.836 - 00:33:17.740, Speaker A: Like that also. We know it. We know it well.
00:33:17.812 - 00:33:18.780, Speaker B: We know it well.
00:33:18.932 - 00:33:20.264, Speaker D: I know it very well.
00:33:22.164 - 00:33:38.872, Speaker B: So that also applied to, like, just a lot of other, like, less known stables. Like, I actually think that, like, their first stable was like Terra KRW or something, but like, Ust became like what they ended up like running with, but everything else was still there.
00:33:39.008 - 00:34:07.374, Speaker C: We have a really interesting panel here because Jordy Market makes on these platforms. Alwyn, you're building them. And then I know Tykee has historically been a big LP in GMX and also just a user of these products. So I'm curious, like Tyche, when you're looking at these products, what's the differentiator for you when you're trying to decide where you want to LP, which you're comfortable using? Like in your mind, are all of these platforms sort of the same, or are there different features that you're looking for that are differentiating them?
00:34:08.274 - 00:34:40.057, Speaker D: From my perspective, it's, I just look at the risk and how much I'm being paid for that risk. And GLP was a simple product because, I mean, it was, I kind of viewed it at the time as a crypto savings account where I don't want to hold cash, I'd rather hold GLP or even try crypto on curve where I'm earning ten to 30% Apr on 50% stable coins, 50% crypto exposure. I purely viewed it as a savings account with not that much downside risk.
00:34:40.225 - 00:34:55.794, Speaker A: How about the basket of it? Do you view the basket of specific products in GLP as something that you wanted to hold or something that you should hedge out because it tells you specifically how much bitcoin, ETH, et cetera, in that basket? Maybe that's not the same as what you would normally hold.
00:34:55.954 - 00:35:26.282, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, for example, on avalanche GLP, it contains Avax. And I don't want exposure to Avax. But like, one thing I could, one thing I did do during like last year, and like, also this year was I would use ether as collateral. I would borrow avax on Aave and use that avax to buy GLP. So if the value of Avax goes down relative to GLP, then I profit off that trade. And you also, and I also earned like the fees. So it was kind of a way to hedge up my portfolio.
00:35:26.282 - 00:35:59.786, Speaker D: And it was a, yeah, it was like a, I call it like the farmer's hedge because you short Avax and then you long GLP, and then you're being like, whatever borrower rate I'm paying for Avax, I'm being compensated for by like GLP fees. So I would kind of view it as like a portfolio construction, like a way to construct a portfolio. And I guess it's like a trade. I know something like that. It's not possible on vertex. I just like GOP because as a retail investor, I don't have the knowledge that Jordy has. I can just say, hey, I can just buy GLP.
00:35:59.786 - 00:36:05.914, Speaker D: I understand it. And GLP was a simple product because. Yeah, it's simple to understand.
00:36:06.074 - 00:36:40.856, Speaker A: Yeah. But there is no free launcher. It's like, when you look at these yield bearing GLP type of assets, the only way that they can get enough yield to pay you your 25% or whatever you're looking for is ultimately through having really high fees, both trading fees. And I think with GMX is like the v one case, there was a massive borrow fee. You didn't realize, but if you went long and then you went on holiday and you came back, you might have gotten in the position directionally. Right. But you still get liquidated because just the amount of borrow fee that you're paying on the leverage would be more than anything you could potentially make in profit.
00:36:40.856 - 00:37:12.300, Speaker A: So it was very much like a DJ exchange, and they have this kind of, like, decision to make between, like, a good trading experience and a good staker experience. And, you know, you have to move money from one to the other. That's sort of like a tough decision. I think with. With V two, they've gone more towards creating a better trading experience, which I think is more sustainable in the long run because really having these, like, you know, crazy fees will not work. So kudos to them for. For at least trying to think about the traders more, because ultimately, that's your customer and you have to be competitive there.
00:37:12.300 - 00:37:20.864, Speaker A: I mean, Alvin, I did see that you guys do have some collaboration with. We're seeing these vaults sort of like market making on the chain. How does that work?
00:37:21.364 - 00:38:14.616, Speaker B: Yeah, so, like, yeah, I think we also realized that retail users just really, like, sort of like a static yield product that you can park your money into and have them work on the exchange. So the way we've sort of done that is using elixir, which is like this decentralized market making protocol. So I think right now they're responsible for maybe like $9 million of tv on Vertex. And what they do is they just place fairly wide markets on vertex and just market make using people who deposit into them, and they act like backstop liquidity. And even though, like, I don't know if, like, these pools in particular are profitable, but, like, they're definitely profitable, like, post rewards, which is what their. What their business model is doing.
00:38:14.800 - 00:38:41.780, Speaker A: So from a farmer perspective, you can get the yield, you can just kind of do this GLP experience. You can try to figure out which pool you get the most value in, but yeah, like ultimately in a competitive landscape of an order book elixir themselves and maybe we can talk to them at some point, but they're going to have to make the actual orders that they're sending be profitable because they can't just finance with tokens indefinitely.
00:38:41.972 - 00:38:51.878, Speaker B: Yeah, it's quite hard to be profitable trade on an order book, especially when you want to be decentralized. So they're solving pretty hard problems over there.
00:38:52.036 - 00:39:17.094, Speaker C: Journey, I'm curious about this. So elixir is sort of, I don't want to talk badly about them, but it's sort of like an unwinnable product, right. If it's decentralized and the strategy is public, and if the strategy is public, they can't profit from it. And if, you know, I suppose they could do it in a non decentralized manner, but it's. I don't think that's the product they're offering. And I mean, they're doing everything on chain, right? So it will be visible eventually. Is that the right way to think about it?
00:39:17.734 - 00:39:40.326, Speaker A: I think it's okay. Ultimately, there is a segment of trades that the cost of capital can be different. For a trading firm like us, our internal cost of capital might be really high. We don't want to pick up a 20% APY. We would just put it somewhere else. Our return on capital is, let's say minimum 40%. There's these opportunities.
00:39:40.326 - 00:40:20.002, Speaker A: Maybe what they're doing is waiting for blow throughs. Like somebody just like puts like really big trades and their backstop liquidity, they get like a really juicy fill. But maybe it only happens like once every like two months or like once every like four weeks. And so, like, the apy on it is not going to be that high because, yeah, they're making like 3% every time it happens, but it happens like once a month. We're not going to be willing to just sit there like super wide waiting, waiting for those trades. So there is potentially a niche that they can play. It's quite different than, I think, on hyper liquid, there's a very competitive, I think that quality of that bot, like the market making bot there, is very high.
00:40:20.002 - 00:40:42.288, Speaker A: It's probably something that could compete with market makers. Given what I know about that team and Jeff and his background in HFT and the quality of something like that might be higher than elixir. But yeah, I think maybe there is a 20% APY, possibly that market makers are not willing to sit around and wait for.
00:40:42.416 - 00:40:55.360, Speaker B: Yeah. And to, like, give you an example of, like, like, you know, all the source code of, like, Uniswap is public. Right. But, like, Uniswap LP's do, like, decently well. GLP also does decently well. And, like, that's also public.
00:40:55.512 - 00:41:16.024, Speaker A: Yeah. I think if thiki was here, he would. He would argue a little bit about how well the Uniswap LP's are doing. He's. He's been doing some analysis that's been not too bullish. But, I mean, let's close the segment off. So, Alwyn, is there some features, I know devs in your basement, you're always just looking to ship stuff.
00:41:16.024 - 00:41:24.704, Speaker A: Are there next features that you're just trying to get out? What is the next product roadmap look like for you?
00:41:25.644 - 00:41:43.884, Speaker B: Yeah. So what we want to do is just scale to a lot more products better. So, like, right now, a downside of the cross margin system. Like, right now, everything's like, cross margin. Right. But that means that we can't really list, like, long tail assets that well. So a big push upcoming is to just overhaul our risk engine.
00:41:43.884 - 00:42:29.972, Speaker B: One is like, simplify the code of that because, you know, we made a lot of mistakes on the way and then, yeah, make it able to process long tail assets. Make it a lot more, like, more able to take on, like, the risk of long sale assets. Just like, figuring out how to do that. And the other thing on our side is just, like, on my side especially, is to try and mitigate existential risk stuff like making sure keys don't get hacked and taking a really heavy security mindset around everything. Ultimately, the job of we just need to do two things decently well, which is to make traders have a nice experience and not make traders lose everything. So just pushing on both of those fronts, basically.
00:42:30.148 - 00:43:16.472, Speaker A: That's actually a great segue into our pasta of the week segment because a certain exploiter has been starting to give us some demand. So now that you mentioned about avoiding getting taken advantage of by exploiters, I think we're about to see some interesting pastas. I stole it from Justin. So sorry, Justin. I think everyone's been clamoring for this pasta, but, yeah, let's go to pasta of the week, and we'll start off with my pasta that I stole from Justin's pot as he was cooking it. So we have the Kyber swap exploiter giving his list of demands. And first of all, I think even his previous message was even more memeable.
00:43:16.472 - 00:43:55.054, Speaker A: Where he says, guys, like, I'm pretty tired. I'm just going to take a nap and you guys behave and I'll come back in a few days and we can negotiate and discuss. So he's had his nap, he's had his beauty sleep, and he feels rested because, oh, boy. His demands. He is basically asking for complete executive control and he wants to insert himself as the Kyber director. So if anybody wants to discuss with him, he has given his telegram name. He is Kyber director and he wants you to give the control of the company to him.
00:43:55.054 - 00:44:09.334, Speaker A: Buy out people. And this is his, as you can see there, he says, this is my best offer. This is my final offer. I require my demands to be met by December 10, otherwise the treaty falls through.
00:44:09.934 - 00:44:11.794, Speaker D: I love how he calls it a treaty.
00:44:13.214 - 00:44:40.352, Speaker C: It's amazing. But if I was a token holder of this Kybera network token, which I don't know who's still holding this thing, I would be like, fuck it, let's go with this. Let's give it a try. Token holders and investors, under this treaty, your tokens will no longer be worthless. I mean, this is gold. Like, this is who you want running the show, right? So I think it's a win win win, right? He said, employees, your salary will be doubled. Executives, we're going to buy out your coins at a fair valuation.
00:44:40.352 - 00:44:53.564, Speaker C: I mean, this guy really seems like he could turn the ship around, at least better than what's going on over there now. So if I had a big bag of cabo, I'd probably just say, fuck it, what do I have to lose? Let's give it a try. So I thought it was a brilliant post.
00:44:54.184 - 00:45:16.100, Speaker A: Isn't it a bit crazy? Like, he's negotiating usually, like, when these guys negotiate, it's because they don't want the legal risk, they just want the 10%. Give me my 10%. You know, give me like this, like legal whitewashing and I'll go away. In this case, this guy's negotiating just, just to like, take over. I mean, it's as if Martin Shkareli and Napoleon had a baby and like, this guy just like, was really good at hacking.
00:45:16.252 - 00:45:41.298, Speaker C: And he also says if anyone, if I get contacted by any agency from any of the 206 sovereignties, or I guess that would be 206 countries, I'm going to give you a zero dollar rebate or zero rebate on your coins, which I think is hilarious as well. So it's hard, it's hard to be mad at this guy. Obviously, I'd you know, feel a little bit different if I lost funds, but this was really just a phenomenal post and hilarious.
00:45:41.466 - 00:45:44.334, Speaker A: Yeah. What are they going to do, arrest him?
00:45:48.474 - 00:45:51.534, Speaker C: Then your carburetor gets burnt. It's all going to zero.
00:45:52.954 - 00:46:05.314, Speaker D: Flashbacks to Avi here. I love how in the LP section, the rebate will be 50% of the losses you've incurred. I know this is probably less than what you wanted. However, it's also more than you deserve.
00:46:06.854 - 00:46:14.634, Speaker B: I mean, he needs the other 50% to, like, buy up the executives and, like, double the employee salary. So it's quite reasonable.
00:46:14.974 - 00:46:29.882, Speaker C: So if you're looking for a job, you can get two x the market rate on your salary by going to work for the new Kyber director. But this is going to be a fun story to track. I mean, I'm very curious. Like this. This guy's probably going to jail. I think they probably will find him. It's pretty significant amount of money.
00:46:29.882 - 00:46:34.186, Speaker C: But if not, I mean, just imagine if this is the thing that turns the Kyber ship around.
00:46:34.330 - 00:47:04.914, Speaker A: I'm still not sure if he's trolling or if he actually wants to take over this company. And he imagines that he can, in a decentralized manner, actually deal with things like salaries and employees and bank accounts and all this stuff and remain completely untraceable. But maybe he's just larping. I have no idea. This is popcorn worthy pasta of the week. Hopefully things get resolved well for all the Kyber LP's. And maybe the fat cat executives need to go.
00:47:04.914 - 00:47:06.974, Speaker A: I don't know. I'm not sure.
00:47:07.554 - 00:47:10.454, Speaker C: The fat cat Kyber swapping executives.
00:47:14.394 - 00:47:21.970, Speaker A: Okay, we'll keep an eye on how those negotiations go, but Justin, I stole your pasta. Do you have a backup one?
00:47:22.002 - 00:47:35.870, Speaker C: Hopefully I do. It's pretty good. But again, I don't know if it can compete. Like, I think I'm still gonna have to vote for Euros Jordy, just because that was so brilliant. But mine is. This video of Elon Musk has been going around. Honestly, the whole talk is amazing.
00:47:35.870 - 00:47:54.042, Speaker C: It's about an hour and 20 minutes. It's on YouTube as of today, so I recommend you listen to it if you're interested in tech, Elon, etc. He's pretty unhinged in it, but I'm just gonna play this video because it's. It's so hilarious and it's truly right out of the Silicon Valley series. So let's give it a listen here. So I will certainly not Pander and.
00:47:54.058 - 00:48:00.974, Speaker B: Jonathan, like, the only reason I'm here is because you were a friend. Like, what was my speaking fee?
00:48:01.434 - 00:48:06.082, Speaker C: You're not making any. But, yeah, sorry.
00:48:06.138 - 00:48:07.054, Speaker B: It's okay.
00:48:07.514 - 00:48:27.834, Speaker C: Second of all, we want to do it for a very long time. So in this clip, Elon's saying, I'm only here because I'm your friend. And he doesn't even know the guy's name, which is hilarious. They've known each other for over a decade, I think 16 years, and he gets his name wrong, which is absolutely hilarious. And it truly is out of a silicon valley sketch. But, yeah, I thought, I thought it was absolutely hilarious.
00:48:28.334 - 00:48:31.334, Speaker B: Do you know if he was trolling or if he was actually just like.
00:48:31.454 - 00:48:48.080, Speaker C: I would recommend if you watch the full, there's a full couple minutes about this, and it does not seem like he's trolling. He sort of says, oh, like, I'm not running on a lot of sleep. I'm busy. But, yeah, I knew, I knew your name was, was Andrew. So I don't think it was a troll. I think it was genuine. But he's very unhinged.
00:48:48.080 - 00:49:05.152, Speaker C: He's dropping f bombs in the interview, telling Disney executives, specifically saying, fuck off to Bob Iger. It's a very fascinating, fascinating interview. So I might lose DJ in the week, but I'm definitely giving the audience something to spend the time, the weekend listening to. So I love how he's like, he's.
00:49:05.168 - 00:49:23.244, Speaker A: Like, the only reason I'm here, Jonathan, is for you because I care about you so much and I forgot your name. But, you know, I really, you know, it's like, you know when in these, like, series, like, in these movies where the guy's, like, dating the girl and he's like, oh, I love you, Kimberly. And, like, her name something else.
00:49:23.784 - 00:49:34.404, Speaker C: Jordy. I could see this being used someday when, when you guys are crushing it in ten years, crypto's well mainstream. You're the largest market maker. I could, I could see this. So I'm calling that prediction now. When you're on deal book.
00:49:36.904 - 00:49:42.700, Speaker A: I think that's a very solid replacement. Alan, did you, did you come with a pasta? I don't know if you, if you're prepared.
00:49:42.812 - 00:50:01.344, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. So they prepared me at the start of this call. They were like, find something on Twitter that you thought was funny. So I, like, barely use Twitter, but one of my team members sent me this thing. I guess we should play the video. Otherwise it's, like, less dramatic. I want to see the washing machine, like, lily skate across the floor.
00:50:01.344 - 00:50:19.040, Speaker B: But, yeah, so I think it's about someone, like, asking about why are volume so high? And he's got this, like, washing machine spinning around. So my. Yeah, one of my, like, one of our community members sent it to me. I was, like, quite funny. Yeah.
00:50:19.152 - 00:50:23.872, Speaker D: What do you think about this when you see it? Do you see, like, do you just find it funny, or it's like, oh, free marketing. Are you offended?
00:50:23.928 - 00:50:42.100, Speaker B: Or. I mean, yeah, I mean, it's, like, pretty funny. I mean, yeah, it's like, free marketing. We were pretty thoughtful when we. When we, like, think about, like, bad actors on our exchange and, like, we have, like, all the mitigations in place and, yeah, I just see it as, like, people, like, advertising us to our target audience.
00:50:42.252 - 00:50:53.052, Speaker C: Alwyn, I feel like you're, like, 90% of the way there for being, like, fully media trained. Like, you've got the right answers. Sometimes you go a little unhinged, but other times you've got, like, the perfect answer for things. It's great.
00:50:53.228 - 00:51:02.312, Speaker B: Oh, dude. It was like, dude, every, like, second of this, I was, like, just pushing back my desire to just drop the r word over and over and over again. That's, like, the remaining 10%.
00:51:02.408 - 00:51:14.056, Speaker A: So, I mean, Elon is not holding himself back, so why should you? Maybe. Maybe once you guys, like, you know, make billions of dollars, you can. You can, you can. You don't have to hold back and go on stage and, oh, dude, once.
00:51:14.080 - 00:51:22.664, Speaker B: I make billions of dollars, that. That our word dropping will be automated. Like, I'm gonna have, like, an entire system set up. It's gonna be fantastic.
00:51:22.824 - 00:51:30.896, Speaker C: Just a quick note. Steadilads does not endorse anyone we bring on. You know, we're not endorsing the words they use or the comments they make. We're just providing a platform.
00:51:31.040 - 00:51:38.160, Speaker B: Actually, in. In the text that you guys sent to invite me on, you explicitly said that this comes with an endorsement of everything that I say, so.
00:51:38.192 - 00:51:39.444, Speaker C: God damn it, Jordy.
00:51:39.784 - 00:51:47.048, Speaker A: Oops. I think. I think our steady lads lawyers might have dropped the ball on that one. So sorry.
00:51:47.096 - 00:51:47.544, Speaker B: We.
00:51:47.664 - 00:51:49.832, Speaker A: I guess we have to endorse, so.
00:51:49.888 - 00:51:54.884, Speaker B: You know, that's a shame. This podcast probably was making billions of dollars, so.
00:51:56.824 - 00:51:57.920, Speaker D: Makes $0.
00:51:57.992 - 00:51:58.924, Speaker B: Must be hard.
00:51:59.744 - 00:52:07.324, Speaker A: Well, no, we have negative, we have negative revenue because you have to pay all the costs, and we're pre revenue, Jody. We're pre revenue.
00:52:08.584 - 00:52:11.880, Speaker D: But if you have no revenue, you can say you're pre revenue.
00:52:12.072 - 00:52:14.048, Speaker A: We have not turned on the fee switch yet.
00:52:14.216 - 00:52:16.604, Speaker D: No, no, we haven't voted yet.
00:52:18.504 - 00:52:43.534, Speaker A: No sponsors. No, no ref links, and, unfortunately, no ads either. So we have no revenue, but we eat the comments. We wake up every day. We look at our fans comments, and usually they're either about thicky, very positive or very negative. So that's why we do this. We just do it for the thicky comments.
00:52:44.274 - 00:52:49.124, Speaker B: Thicky looks like a K pop idol. It's crazy. I didn't expect that.
00:52:49.864 - 00:52:54.484, Speaker A: Yeah, Alvin, you gotta get the hair thing. You gotta, like, follow the.
00:52:55.024 - 00:52:56.524, Speaker C: Keep them in the basement.
00:52:58.224 - 00:53:07.760, Speaker B: Like, I went to a bar yesterday. I got sexually assaulted by a dude at that bar. I have to cut the hair, man. I have to cut my hair. Wait, wait.
00:53:07.792 - 00:53:09.568, Speaker D: You were outside? That's so bearish.
00:53:09.696 - 00:53:22.408, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, dude, the one time cell vertex. But if you think about it, maybe. Maybe that guy, by molesting me, he scared me into going back inside forever. So maybe it's not actually a bear signal. Who knows?
00:53:22.496 - 00:53:28.644, Speaker A: Bye bye. Goodbye. Yes. The devs will never go out again.
00:53:29.264 - 00:53:37.204, Speaker B: That is a true story. Like, look, I did. I took it groped at a bar, and I think it was because of the long hair. So I will have to cut it.
00:53:37.544 - 00:53:43.838, Speaker A: We have to ask, thinking next time, if he gets groped sometimes or if. If he's able to manage that. So, uh, thank you, dude.
00:53:43.886 - 00:53:47.994, Speaker B: I would. I would grope him myself. So it's probably a yes.
00:53:48.654 - 00:53:52.314, Speaker D: The CTO of vertex gropes.
00:53:54.294 - 00:53:55.030, Speaker B: Coin desk.
00:53:55.102 - 00:53:56.914, Speaker C: Coindesk doesn't listen to this.
00:53:57.654 - 00:54:00.830, Speaker A: Uh, taiki, finish us off. What's your. What's your pasta this week?
00:54:00.902 - 00:54:26.090, Speaker D: Okay. I feel like that that entire conversation was a pasta, but, uh, there's this new upcoming documentary called the highest of stakes featuring Richard Heart, and you can pre order it for $15. Coming. I mean, I don't even know, like, what. What even this thing is, but I. Justin, I think the IMDb reviews for this documentary and the ratings are very, very high. I think it's like 8.6
00:54:26.090 - 00:54:32.590, Speaker D: out of ten. I wonder if it's, like, a bunch of, like, hex holders just, like, voting to pump their bag.
00:54:32.782 - 00:54:38.474, Speaker A: 700. What is it? 788 votes? So, like, I mean, there's more hexagons on Twitter than that, for sure.
00:54:40.334 - 00:54:52.374, Speaker D: I mean, I just. I just, like, find this hilarious. I think the SEC tried to charge him, but they couldn't find him. And then he's, like, dropping documentaries, and I don't know, I feel like this. This guy is.
00:54:52.534 - 00:55:13.216, Speaker A: I have been aware of this because I'm friends with Eric Wall, who, you know, has taken part in this documentary. And my understanding this is an independent and documentary, and I don't think it's like, super. It might not be as effusive about, you know, praising Richard Heart. I think it's kind of showing different sides. And Eric Wall is obviously, like a master troller, and he's been trolling Richard Hart for. For a long time. And he's.
00:55:13.216 - 00:55:49.844, Speaker A: He's in the documentary. I haven't watched it, but I am actually looking forward to, I don't know if I want to go through the process of AWS, Amazon, you know, prime and whatever. Hopefully somebody just puts it on YouTube and I can degenerate with my morning coffee. But I don't think it's going to be a propaganda. It might actually be a fun, legit documentary, and I'm actually excited to watch it. I don't know if we're going to actually get a tera one. Do you think I'll win that? The Netflix guys are going to do Terra one, or did they just skip over Terra and go straight to the FTX stuff?
00:55:50.244 - 00:56:03.984, Speaker B: I think there was, like, a pretty nice one on YouTube. But the thing is, like, tara was like, a very, like, asian phenomenon, right? I'm like, hollywood just does not fuck with Asia. So, yeah, I hope there's a tarot one. It would be a lot of fun.
00:56:04.324 - 00:56:06.184, Speaker C: Have you seen crazy rich Asians?
00:56:06.644 - 00:56:13.428, Speaker B: I have. It's like, the one exception. They throw us a bone, like once, like every, like 510 years.
00:56:13.596 - 00:56:14.292, Speaker C: Fair enough.
00:56:14.388 - 00:57:01.234, Speaker A: We could get a three. Three Arrows movie because you have, like, the, you know, you have the west, west and east kind of coming together for that one. I'm curious, like, all this memeable things that happened during, like, the crypto bear market and then the bull market. What kind of dramas you want to get out? I'm pretty sure that Netflix documentaries are going to start coming in pretty fast and furious. There is a lot of demand, I think, even for things like, obviously, FTX has, like, a book and multiple books, right? Like, there's the Michael Lewis one, there's the Bloomberg one. So I'm looking forward to some of those reenactments. And, yeah, like with Terra, I mean, unfortunately, the best that that community has managed to recover is, like, this, like, Luna classic stuff, which has managed to get relisted.
00:57:01.234 - 00:57:29.640, Speaker A: Someone is, like, trying to repeg. I don't know if it's fat man terra or someone's, like, trying to repeg Ust back to a dollar and trying to do some burn mechanisms to make that happen. I don't know. Like, we'll see if that ends well. I think the Solana ecosystem has managed to bounce back from FTX, but I don't know if trying to repeg Ust is going to work out as well either way.
00:57:29.672 - 00:57:50.374, Speaker B: Like, dude, USTC is still worth, like, ten times more than vertex, so it really. I don't know. I just keep that in perspective at all times. You know, anytime, like, any bit of ego gets to my head, it's like, yeah, no, that's good. I'm, like, not. I'm not very bullish. Like, a repeg.
00:57:50.374 - 00:58:00.846, Speaker B: It's, like, kind of hard to, like, unless, like, they do something where, like, they just delete a bunch of people's Ust or, like, they make it like 100 to one or something. Yeah, and, like, they have to change the mechanism, too.
00:58:01.030 - 00:58:24.940, Speaker A: And there is no, like, I guess, like, is the chain active anymore? Like, is. I haven't used my terra wallet, whatever it was called. Terra Explorer. Yeah, I haven't used that ever since I kind of panic exited ust as things were collapsing. Is that still being used? Is that chain active or do you have any idea?
00:58:25.092 - 00:58:35.704, Speaker B: I don't know. I would guess probably not. I don't think there's meaningful economic activity on that chain. At the same time. Like, is there meaningful economic activity on any chain? Who knows?
00:58:35.824 - 00:58:49.176, Speaker A: That's pretty meta. That's pretty meta and cool. So, like, we have, we have four, like, very solid pastas. I would say, like, this week. It's a tough competition, Alwyn, since, since you're the guest, like, which one is your. Your favorite pasta? Out of these four, which one?
00:58:49.240 - 00:58:54.880, Speaker B: The Khyber swap exploiter one was a pasta, right? Yeah, stolen from my hands. It was fantastic.
00:58:54.912 - 00:59:17.620, Speaker A: You know, I exploited Justin's bookmarks to get that pasta. So it's epic, it's poetic, and thank you. I'll take this victory that I snatched from defeat. Anyway, thanks for joining us, Alvin. Looking forward to you guys. Just keep shipping in that basement. You've done incredibly well.
00:59:17.620 - 00:59:27.264, Speaker A: I think people that have used the product know it's one of the, one of the best ones and, yeah. Looking forward to seeing how you guys do in 2024. Thanks, everybody, and see you next time.
