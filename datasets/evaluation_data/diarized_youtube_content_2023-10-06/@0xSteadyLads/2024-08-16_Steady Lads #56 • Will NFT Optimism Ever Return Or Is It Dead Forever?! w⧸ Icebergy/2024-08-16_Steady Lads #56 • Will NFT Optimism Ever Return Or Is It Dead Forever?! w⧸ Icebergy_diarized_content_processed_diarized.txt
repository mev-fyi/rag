00:00:00.280 - 00:00:06.542, Speaker A: About mother. I've seen Iggy just keeps pushing. We've talked about this coin before. Like, good for her. She is dedicated.
00:00:06.726 - 00:00:09.678, Speaker B: I am really surprised she stuck around.
00:00:09.854 - 00:00:11.718, Speaker C: She's one of us. She's a builder.
00:00:11.854 - 00:00:18.438, Speaker B: I think she's going, do you see that tweet where she said she's going insane, you guys? One day to the moon, next day it's all over.
00:00:18.574 - 00:00:20.558, Speaker D: Yeah, we shared that, I think, last week.
00:00:20.654 - 00:00:36.790, Speaker A: I don't, I just don't know who the target audience is because, like, if she had a cooler name for it, but mother is like, you know, you know, everyone's like, mom, my mom is lame. You know, you got this, like, teenager boys trying to gamble on this, like, what is exactly. I don't get it. What is the mommy?
00:00:36.830 - 00:00:36.934, Speaker B: Want?
00:00:36.942 - 00:00:39.158, Speaker C: A mommy. People want a mommy. That's what they want.
00:00:39.174 - 00:01:10.538, Speaker A: But he could be called mommy. Mommy would be better than motherhood. Welcome to steady lads. Tikey's pumped up. Yo, yo, yo. We have icebergy with us. Icebergy.
00:01:10.538 - 00:01:11.650, Speaker A: Good to have you on.
00:01:11.810 - 00:01:13.186, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me.
00:01:13.298 - 00:01:52.480, Speaker A: Absolutely. I mean, you know, it's summer. It's supposed to be quiet, but after last week's panic, this week we also have a bunch of drama, it looks like, and some people are losing their minds. Trade or just watch these markets. The weird thing is, we were just commenting, stocks are doing really well. It's been a bit of a shape recovery for stocks, back to all time high. Maybe we can look at Nasdaq here, but macro is looking in that possible goldilocks situation for a little bit where it's not bad enough to be a recession, but it's kind of cooling off enough that they'll be able to cut rates.
00:01:52.480 - 00:02:03.076, Speaker A: And that's exactly what stocks are looking for and gold is looking for. So I think that's what we're seeing right now with Nasdaq kind of starting to have a very good day again.
00:02:03.228 - 00:02:27.058, Speaker B: I think stocks are in a pretty good place where inflation's come down enough. And the only thing that worries me is the spread between where inflation is right now and where the Fed is. It's starting to get pretty tight. Historically, the spread between inflation and the short term fed rate. So they have, like, a lot of room to, like, come down. I just don't know when or like how fast they do it.
00:02:27.114 - 00:02:46.858, Speaker A: Well, it looks like we're going to get a cut in September. I think if nothing crazy happens until then, it'll be 25 bits. And if we have another panic crash, then they'll probably just do 50. So it's a start. We'll see how many rate cuts we get. But generally, like I said, macro is kind of in a good spot. Unfortunately, crypto's had an up and down choppy week.
00:02:47.034 - 00:03:06.540, Speaker B: Why do you think crypto has, like, such a. Like, all summer has been lagging? What's, like. And we've seen so many, like, inflows to the ETF. Like, where's, like, the disconnect or, like, I feel like with all the inflows, price should be higher. Um, I checked the carry trade there. There is some open interest, but it's not like as much money has flown into the ETF's.
00:03:06.620 - 00:03:49.096, Speaker D: I'd like to add on that, too. I'm curious if you guys think in some ways, crypto is either is more responsive to things that are happening in the news cycle and also, like, more forward looking than the markets just because it's more receptive to liquidity changes. Because one thing I'm wondering is it's not as though bitcoin has performed poorly. Right? Like, if you look at where it bottomed, it's obviously, you know, bottoming at 15k, going all the way up to 70k, clearly outperforms the Nasdaq, and now it's sort of cooling off a bit. And I'm wondering if there's possibly some signal there where, like, bitcoin is, like, a very viable indicator for what we should expect to happen in the near term. If the market is seeing a slowing down coming, maybe the Harris administration is getting priced in and as a potential winner. Now, if you guys think that could be playing a part, too.
00:03:49.208 - 00:04:25.160, Speaker C: I think part of the reason why the vibes, at least on crypto, has been so bad is that it's not that bitcoin isn't doing poorly. It's just that everything else is not performing to par. I think everyone in crypto longs, or everyone has that nostalgia for the alt season we saw in 2020 and 2021. And we keep thinking it's going to happen at some point because bitcoin keeps going higher, but it's just not happening. And then we have all these desperation, I guess, attempts by kols to pump meme coins and have pvP, I guess, narratives like Sui, I guess. Yeah. Total three.
00:04:25.160 - 00:04:34.164, Speaker C: I guess this chart is total three divided by bitcoin. It's that all the flows are going to bitcoin and there's not enough retail, there's not enough new inflows to pump anything else.
00:04:34.252 - 00:05:09.504, Speaker A: That's quite a chart there. We've finally had a bit of a reckoning with altcoins, where there's finally too many options, too dispersed. The cliques and the gangs are not that many people, because everyone's choosing different things. And there's. There's not, like, new retail compared to the amount of onboarding we had last cycle, where, like, you know, finance was onboarding 30,000 accounts a day. I think it's like single digit thousands. But as to, like, bitcoin specifically, it does seem that there's some signal, but I wouldn't say it's what Justin Hines at, which is that I.
00:05:09.504 - 00:05:49.820, Speaker A: Bitcoin is smarter than the market and is already trying to show what direction it's going. There are, unfortunately, still too many sellers, and the market is too small. And when I say too many sellers, I mean, like these massive, idiosyncratic sells that we've been waiting for to happen, that finally started all happening at the same time. It's crazy that an asset that we talk about every day, and it's so important for the future, can get so influenced by single entities. But unfortunately, it doesn't be the case that he wants to sell a billion dollars of bitcoin because they're $2 billion. Either the german government or we talked about jump last time, or now it looks like it's the us government.
00:05:49.940 - 00:05:59.564, Speaker D: That must make you more bullish than ever, right? In some ways. I mean, that selling is finite. We're still doing quite well, given all that selling. And at some point, that sell pressure is gone, right?
00:05:59.652 - 00:06:29.622, Speaker A: Yeah, it's gone. I mean, the coins get dispersed to new holders who will eventually sell, but they'll be looking to sell higher because their price point of entry is higher versus, you know, a government that just took them for free from some criminals. Right now, it's a waiting game. Like you said, you have to get through this. There have been some trading games back and forth. I think there's a finance whale that is now being followed by the entire market. Their execution style, let's say, is not very subtle.
00:06:29.622 - 00:07:17.584, Speaker A: So they're doing big limit orders and just showing the book how much they want to execute, which is unusual. There is a trading philosophy that espouses this type of execution where you just, like, you know, layer the book with 500 bitcoin at a time. Sometimes he's doing a thousand bitcoin, showing the market that you are going to fill, you know, 10,000 bitcoin. Kind of pushing it away from you, maybe like reducing your entry average price, making it worse. There's two options. Right. Like, either this binance whale is just really bad at execution and they don't know how to do a t wap, or they are purposely trying to be notorious and scare people and be like, oh, no, the binance whale who always wins is going short.
00:07:17.584 - 00:07:24.112, Speaker A: Therefore, you know, we should follow. Follow the smart whale. And that might be a little bit of what's happening.
00:07:24.176 - 00:07:25.576, Speaker C: The terminology is called spoofing.
00:07:25.608 - 00:07:25.800, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:25.840 - 00:07:30.344, Speaker C: And you're not saying that they are spoofing, but that's one potential. Oh, not spoofing.
00:07:30.392 - 00:07:57.012, Speaker A: No, they get filled. So spoofing is when you're not trying to get filled and you just, like, show the order and you cancel it. You don't want, you don't want, you don't intend to get filled. This guy leaves it, gets filled, fills 10,000 bitcoin in the most non subtle way. There seems to be a lot of inside information, possibly because the latest tranche of 10,000 bitcoin was sold just as, like, everything was fine. We were at. He sold it quickly off to.
00:07:57.012 - 00:08:04.772, Speaker A: Then, like, you know, right after he finishes, like, ten minutes later, we get this on chain transfer from Coinbase custody. That can't be a coincidence.
00:08:04.956 - 00:08:11.108, Speaker D: And this is hundreds of millions of dollars of cell pressures. So 10,000 bitcoin, $600 million. That's wild.
00:08:11.204 - 00:08:36.630, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, it is interesting. It's not enough to destroy the market, and, you know, it moves it down two k quickly. I'm not sure how this guy is going to execute out of it. If the market is doing well on the macro side, as it continues to do, as soon as these two apps on Coinbase end, he's going to have to cover 10,000 bitcoin. And now everyone's on to him. Like, people know that he has to cover 10,000 bitcoin.
00:08:36.630 - 00:08:53.790, Speaker A: So there's a forced buyer of 10,000 bitcoin. This is kind of bullish, actually. You have to be very careful with your timing, because if you go too soon while the government's still executing twaps, then you're going to have a drawdown. But at some point, he has to cover back, and I'm a bit surprised that.
00:08:53.870 - 00:08:55.886, Speaker D: So these are all leverage trades. It's not spot.
00:08:55.998 - 00:08:58.090, Speaker A: Yeah, this is on the perp, this is on the buy.
00:08:58.470 - 00:09:01.166, Speaker B: Do you think Sailor started his twap yet?
00:09:01.278 - 00:09:03.570, Speaker A: Obviously. Obviously not. There's no way.
00:09:03.870 - 00:09:19.084, Speaker B: Well, people thought that push up, like, earlier last week or something was him. But I don't know. I think everyone just defaults to it's sailor every time. Yeah, I forgot that he was going to buy, like, 2 billion more. Hopefully times a little bit better.
00:09:19.172 - 00:09:22.588, Speaker A: Has he secured the funding for that yet? I think it might take some time.
00:09:22.684 - 00:09:29.188, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. I haven't seen. I don't know. He put that announcement out and people just assumed it was going to start, like, tomorrow.
00:09:29.324 - 00:09:39.600, Speaker A: Bottom line, I think with gold doing well and stocks doing well, these idiosyncratic sellers have to run out at some point, and then there will be some short covering that has to happen.
00:09:39.950 - 00:09:47.974, Speaker C: It's like that meme. It's like sellers are almost out of coins, but there's always sellers in crypto. It feels like there's always new sellers that come out of nowhere.
00:09:48.022 - 00:09:49.998, Speaker A: It's always just a couple more liquidations.
00:09:50.174 - 00:09:52.902, Speaker C: A couple more liquidations, then up only.
00:09:53.046 - 00:09:55.206, Speaker D: What's this photo here, Jordy?
00:09:55.278 - 00:10:03.790, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, this is how people are feeling right now. They're watching s and P 500 and Nasdaq crushing and. Yeah, it's can pump, can pump right here.
00:10:03.830 - 00:10:16.750, Speaker C: So do you want to pull up the iceberg of the, I guess, the binance coins and I guess Bergey's theses around, I guess, never fully recovering from FTX. Can you just talk about that, Bergie?
00:10:16.870 - 00:10:45.296, Speaker B: I saw this get posted, like, Kobe put out that thing where he said, like, 2019 Echo bubble. I've seen a bunch of people talk about that throughout the year, because in 2019, bitcoin was the only thing that kind of went up besides the Binance ieos, but this time the cycle has been sold. Bitcoin. That's kind of it. I don't know. It's the whole theory that we, like, haven't really recovered from FTX. Is the market kind of, like, recovered pretty fast, like, post FTX.
00:10:45.296 - 00:11:26.332, Speaker B: And I don't remember everyone saying, like, twelve k, twelve k, twelve k. And, like, everyone thought we were going to go lower, so. And then we had, like, that banking crisis where people were like, yeah, it's over for bitcoin. This was the echo bubble top. I just don't know if people, like, really ever allocated until, like, it was too late. And I think that's, like, part of, like, the desperation you've seen, like, with the meme coins and, like, people, like, fighting for their lives in, like, the trenches. I think you saw a lot of, like, valuations blow up in, like, q one of this year because I don't think a lot of, like, the, the venture funds VC's were, like, really funding deals and, like, post FTX, I think it took a really long time.
00:11:26.332 - 00:11:49.190, Speaker B: So they, like, slammed all. They blew out valuations and stuff and just kind of, like, no one ended up winning except for, like, team founders. Like, there were just, there wasn't enough money in the ecosystem post FTX to, like, support, like, multi billion dollar valuations for all this stuff. And just like, everyone decided to launch at the same time and money was thin. Yeah, everyone just went with the safe bets of, like, bitcoin soul.
00:11:49.270 - 00:12:13.864, Speaker C: Yeah. And I guess speaking of project founders winning, we had the Eigen layer news. Or maybe this wasn't really news. People might have known about this in the past, but I think Coindesk, someone came up with this article around how Eigenlayer made all their team wallet addresses public so that LRT's and other projects that want to be Eigen layer aligned would airdrop more tokens to, you know, Eigen layer team members.
00:12:13.912 - 00:12:14.456, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:14.608 - 00:12:22.752, Speaker C: And you receive Sriram here looking very happy. What do you guys think about stuff like this?
00:12:22.896 - 00:12:56.960, Speaker D: The way you explain it, it's at least good that these addresses are public, right? I mean, you can only imagine how much happens behind the scenes when all of these addresses aren't public, right? I don't know. I'm pretty mixed on it. I mean, we also see a lot of large projects donating to the protocol guild supporting, like, Ethan core developers, which in some ways is similar, right? Like, if you think Eigen layer is going to be a core layer of infrastructure in the future, supporting those developers and having them aligned with your project makes sense. But everything I've seen suggests this is a little bit shady. But I think this is probably just the tip of the iceberg. Or the tip of the icebergy.
00:12:58.460 - 00:13:15.510, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe this is, like, one example of people just wanting to be angry, so they just. It's really easy to pick Eigen Lair as, you know, like, blame Eigen lair for not launching or whatever. People are just angry, and they just want a reason to be angry. And I think that's kind of what's happening on Twitter.
00:13:15.670 - 00:13:33.374, Speaker B: I just don't know why someone didn't say, like, maybe this isn't a great idea. Things leak in crypto. I just don't know why someone didn't say, like, maybe we shouldn't do this. Maybe they did. I don't. We don't really have a full story, but after everything, like, he's been through the past, like, year, it just, like, it's just, like, tiring.
00:13:33.502 - 00:14:09.924, Speaker D: Have you guys seen Eigen layer the perp on, avoid predicting, you know, getting a pre market price for this thing went all the way up to almost $13 and is now basically down like 75% to $3.80. It is pretty striking to see this sort of. I'm not going to say fall from grace because Eigen Lair is still worth, I believe, at this price, $5 billion fdv. So still, like incredible value creation. But I certainly a fall from grace from the standpoint of being like Eigen lair was eth savior, the future of Eve. Everyone was deposited, everyone was farming to now sort of trickling down. And I think there is like, a common pattern here.
00:14:09.924 - 00:14:21.164, Speaker D: Projects that delay their token or keep it locked for a while, they sometimes miss the moment for good. Right? Like, we've seen a lot of projects that have sort of, like, not launched the token till too late and just faded out because of that.
00:14:21.292 - 00:14:34.002, Speaker B: It might be better than a bunch of people just losing. It's like, up and out. Like, it's not real money to them yet. So it's probably better than. I mean, I'm sure it probably would have launched at a crazy valuation if they did it in May and then just would have went down only.
00:14:34.106 - 00:14:37.058, Speaker D: And the path is the same, you're saying?
00:14:37.194 - 00:14:38.510, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty much.
00:14:39.170 - 00:14:54.890, Speaker A: You guys are talking about the same thing, but from like, different angles. Like, one talking about the founder. Justin's the founder here, is like, trying to cash out money. He's like, they missed their chance, man. They could have, like, done it at the top. They got like, iceberg. He's like, you know, retail would have like, bag held down.
00:14:55.550 - 00:14:56.142, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:56.246 - 00:14:58.782, Speaker D: So they were forced to bag hold down.
00:14:58.966 - 00:15:06.918, Speaker B: I still think people don't really understand Eigen Lair yet, too. So I don't know. I think it's probably good that it's not out yet.
00:15:07.014 - 00:15:35.908, Speaker A: It is good. The other thing that they don't understand is how difficult it is to replicate. And usually what I've always said is, over time, the difficulty of doing something will show in the price. So if someone is doing something relatively simple and you can just copy it, it will get diluted because other people are going to do it. And if it's got a 5 billion valuation, everyone's going to rush to do it. So Eigen layer is one where it looks complicated and probably is like, the way they've designed it, but people have learned from the mistakes. Right.
00:15:35.908 - 00:15:39.828, Speaker A: And they've started to implement something which is quite similar.
00:15:40.004 - 00:16:13.896, Speaker C: Yeah. But I guess in terms of one application that has been successful, maybe we can talk about polymarket. Um, and a lot of, you know, betting that's been going on. I think there was like a, the Twitter spaces between Elon and Trump, and people were betting on what they're going to talk about. I think a lot of people think that, you know, polymarket's just an election phenomenon and volumes are going to taper off after the election. But what do you guys think? Like, do you think people will still, you know, continue betting on, like, random things that's going to happen in, in the world? Do you think they can maintain its their volume? Do you have thoughts on that, virgie?
00:16:13.968 - 00:16:45.020, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, I don't know if you guys watched the Elon Trump Twitter space, but I was just reading the Twitter feed and everyone's like, please say Tesla. Please say Tesla. And Trump just kept saying like, electric car. And then it was like an hour in and tampon was like a 7% chance of hitting. And then he just said Tampon out of nowhere. And like, all of my Twitter feed was like, he said it, he said it, he said it. And everyone was like, super excited.
00:16:45.020 - 00:17:03.248, Speaker B: I think that kind of changed my mind. I was kind of like, I think post the election, the TVL and interests are going to slow down, but I think if you have fun events that people just want to bet on. Betting on Tampon being said at a conference, it's kind of fun. Yeah.
00:17:03.264 - 00:17:24.910, Speaker D: I mean, to date, the majority of their volume has been political north of a billion dollars on the election here. Kamala Harris is now 10% ahead of Trump. And polymarket has tried a lot of other things with sports. I do think now they've grown to the point that like, when football season in the US comes back around, that's a very, like, high activity gambling season.
00:17:25.290 - 00:17:39.242, Speaker B: Yeah, it didn't work before, is just, they just didn't have, like, the books weren't thick enough for like, actually taking like, bets on some of the stuff. Like, now you can actually have all these markets and people are like, paying attention.
00:17:39.426 - 00:18:11.444, Speaker D: Super bowl champion for next year already has $7 million bet on it. I think they can kind of move this election gambling aspect more towards sports and ride that wave. During us football season, there's a lot of activity there and then go from there. They certainly have product market fit, though, to your guys point earlier. And like the crypto speculation game, whether it's crypto people speculating on what Trump's going to say during the spaces or literally just like all time high bets on betting, when ethereum is going to have the next all time high, you can see a million dollars bet here alone. Which is pretty interesting. So I think they'll make it.
00:18:11.444 - 00:18:15.164, Speaker D: I do think the election is obviously going to be the biggest use case for this thing, though, for a while.
00:18:15.252 - 00:18:26.628, Speaker C: Just imagine if they. I'm not sure if they'll ever do it again, but if they did do a token and they do liquidity money incentives for betting on things, I feel like that would maybe revitalize some form of on chain summer.
00:18:26.684 - 00:18:26.876, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:26.908 - 00:18:29.400, Speaker C: That people have been longing for for the past couple of years.
00:18:30.360 - 00:18:44.940, Speaker D: Yeah. What's interesting is they do have liquidity mining with USDC, but the incentives are effectively like peanuts relative to the betting size. So they'll have $500 of USDC incentives around the spot price. But it's pretty trivial the incentives are doing now.
00:18:45.600 - 00:19:18.980, Speaker A: So one other update we have is the trading competition. So as we said in the first week, we had Suzu liquidate thiki on a world coin trade, which thiki was correct, worldcoin. Now, it just looked is at the short was he put it on at like $2.20 or something and it ran up to $3. He was right in the end. So just unfortunately, you know, these competitions, when you have this many aggressive traders, you got to swing for the fences. And a lot of us along the way were getting liquidated, or almost liquidated, these like, crazy moves.
00:19:18.980 - 00:19:29.470, Speaker A: So this was kind of going into the last week. This was week three. There were four weeks, and it's a grand Prix style. So I had a little bit of a lead, but nothing. Not many chips left at this point.
00:19:30.210 - 00:19:33.350, Speaker C: I love that you're -93% in your first place.
00:19:34.690 - 00:19:52.770, Speaker A: Yeah. So the way that this worked was you get points for every week. You know, the first week I was up from ten to next one, from 14 to 18. So I was doing really well. And then the third week, you know, just kind of went minus on the drawdown to like one k. Yeah.
00:19:52.810 - 00:19:57.456, Speaker C: What was the trade, if you don't mind me asking? That took you up and also down.
00:19:57.568 - 00:20:22.586, Speaker A: Yeah. So everybody was. The right way to do these competitions is not to, like, trade, to try to make P and L. That's like, completely the wrong way. And I think Cl did that and didn't get any prize, even though he was, like, green. The right way to trade is to look at, like, the people that are winning and try to just get on top of them, get more points in them. So Suzu was winning the first week and he was long, so you have to kind of keep up with him.
00:20:22.586 - 00:20:40.346, Speaker A: But if he's going to get liquidated, you need to jump off the ship before him, like this kind of, like, tactic. So he got liquidated. Week two, actually, I think week three and defi squared. Week two and thicki. Week one. So every week you just kind of have to beat the top guy and survive. So that was my strategy.
00:20:40.346 - 00:21:19.800, Speaker A: And coming into the last week, I needed a third place. And coming into, like, the last day and last hour, a lot of people were kind of sitting on their hands and waiting for the last minute to trade. And we see here, like, I was third, so I was okay, I was going to get enough points to secure a victory. And in the last hour, people just, like, went 50 x leverage and it was just crazy. And unfortunately for me, like, I ended up getting fourth. Like, there was a rhino who came out of nowhere and snatched it by, I guess, like, he fixed 50 x eth or something during, during an upswing. It was interesting.
00:21:19.800 - 00:21:43.184, Speaker A: It came down to last minute, it was probabilistic at the end. Like, you know, every minute it was changing who was, was doing it. But congrats to rhino for squeaking it out. And, you know, I have to say, like, it was super fun. But the one annoying thing is, like, the comments just think that everyone's a bad fighter because they're negative. They don't understand, like, the dynamic of trying to get more points than other people and, like, the relative rankings.
00:21:43.232 - 00:21:45.336, Speaker D: So if you look down, flies are hilarious.
00:21:45.408 - 00:22:11.790, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's like, oh, everyone's down. Like, influencers suck. Let me in. You know, like, I can show these larps how to trade. What's the price? So first was one hundred k and second was fifty k, and then it was 25k. So compared to the chips that we got, because you're trading with $10,000, that's how much they give you to start with. The prize is like ten times bigger.
00:22:11.790 - 00:22:21.582, Speaker A: So you should not really, like, trade your chips as real money. You should trade them as a way to get points and try to get the 100k.
00:22:21.726 - 00:22:31.694, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Rhino took his 100k, went to Vegas, and I think he was just gambling with it. What are you either going to do with your 50k, Jordy? Are you going to buy our bags or what you going to do there?
00:22:31.862 - 00:22:35.734, Speaker B: I've got a great token for you to buy.
00:22:35.902 - 00:22:38.050, Speaker D: Yeah, I got an 100 x meme coin.
00:22:39.230 - 00:22:55.170, Speaker A: It feels like those tweets where someone's like, I got some cash burn in my pocket. Show me a meme coin, I'm gonna buy it. And then engagement farming. All right, what's your what's engage my farming? What do you got?
00:22:55.910 - 00:23:25.110, Speaker B: I don't know. I put out a tweet thinking like, you get like there's got to be something out there that's cheap, you know, like everyone's so jaded as like written off the space. There's got to be something out there that like is like a screaming buy. I put out a tweet like someone said like you could buy punks at like $30 in like 2019. And I was like, all right, what themes or like tickers could you get? And all my replies were just meme coins. I was like, well that didn't work out.
00:23:25.770 - 00:23:41.246, Speaker C: Justin, can you pull up my screen? I think berg you talked about, you know, what's value now that's like akin to buying punks, you know, in 2019. But look at this NFT chart. Like this is insane. It's crazy how everyone thought this is like the future of finance and now there's, can you zoom in on the.
00:23:41.278 - 00:23:43.210, Speaker D: Picture so we can see the values?
00:23:43.590 - 00:23:53.050, Speaker B: Dude, if you pull up the punk chart now and like eth it looks like it like fully round, like retraced like the entire move, it's pretty wild.
00:23:53.590 - 00:24:03.856, Speaker C: Even if you zoom in, it's, it's basically zero. Like this is, they need to put this in log chart, I think. But it's, it's really crazy how things fall off. Like really.
00:24:03.888 - 00:24:10.960, Speaker B: You don't even see people like trying to launch new NFT projects, which I think is kind of interesting. It's just like everyone gave up.
00:24:11.120 - 00:24:13.420, Speaker C: Yeah, very good. Like you were big into nfcs, right?
00:24:13.960 - 00:24:41.876, Speaker B: Yeah, I really liked them because like that summer, like NFC summer, you could just like buy a bunch of stuff for like a couple eth and you like hit some like massive like bangers. But it was always like fun, like discovering like the hot contracts people were minting from what it was. Who's like built it. It was like a fun game of like cat and mouse of like trying to find like the new NFT launches. I think it kind of went all to meme coins just because it's more liquid, easier to trade.
00:24:41.948 - 00:24:46.124, Speaker D: But, um, there have been some NFT launches. Isn't that right?
00:24:46.252 - 00:24:48.308, Speaker B: There's someone based that are interesting.
00:24:48.484 - 00:24:49.240, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:49.620 - 00:24:54.070, Speaker B: And Mansell, I think of at least one.
00:24:54.410 - 00:25:18.796, Speaker A: So this is cool. Now you can take a 3d image and with AI you can have it move around. So we have these puff nfts now that are pretty cool. Like they're 3d images and people have been, if you look at the account, there's a few other ones as well. It makes it much more, like, personal and real. Like, the guy is giving you a little bit of personality.
00:25:18.988 - 00:25:25.280, Speaker D: Did you end up acquiring the puff? That was made in my honor and in my image and likeness.
00:25:26.060 - 00:25:51.516, Speaker A: I haven't found the one with the glasses, but yeah, I mean, it is interesting. Like launching nfvs, like we talked about a couple of weeks ago when we did the initial mint, there is like, fervor. Like, so many, like hundreds of people just showed up in the discord that were like, nowhere to be seen on the day of the mint. And just like spamming. Where is it? Let's go. Like, it's five minutes late. Oh, my God.
00:25:51.516 - 00:26:06.828, Speaker A: That, like, the legendaries are sold out. Like, they're so angry. I want to get a legendary it. Like, it still has, like, traces of potential and with the puff specific ones because there is, like a token ingrained in it. Like it will. That's a token. There is a utility to it.
00:26:06.828 - 00:26:46.464, Speaker A: Like, you're actually buying a pre market token in essence. Plus you get, like, the NFT. So I don't think NFTs as a concept are dead. And I think having a personalized one that you can trade or choose is much better than just a meme coin, despite the liquidity, especially if you just have floors and legendary floors where people trade them around the same price. So we have had decent volume on these and definitely a lot of, at least during the minting excitement. So maybe NFT is not totally dead. We've seen, like, some of the existing projects obviously try to do stuff.
00:26:46.464 - 00:27:12.682, Speaker A: We have like, pudgies. Who is going retail real life toys. They're going like, l two. They're going potentially gonna make a pudgy coin. I don't know if that's true or not, but I heard some rumors that there might be a meme coin after the collection which kind of combines, combines the two worlds. Have you had anything like that? I guess like Milady's had some associated meme coins.
00:27:12.786 - 00:27:30.330, Speaker B: Yeah, that cult coin that they launched. And then they had those inflatable thing they had on a bonding curve. Not inflatable, but stuffed animal thing. I think the pudgy thing is interesting because they're launching a L2 when it's super out of favor. So just.
00:27:30.370 - 00:27:31.698, Speaker D: They're actually doing that.
00:27:31.874 - 00:27:38.586, Speaker A: Yeah, I invested. They better do it abstract. It's called abstract. Yeah.
00:27:38.658 - 00:27:54.890, Speaker B: Just takes a lot of conviction to, like, take that bet, especially when you already have like a, like a decent brand. Pretty curious how that all plays out. And, like, Lucas, pretty good builder. So curious what, like, approach that he, like, takes to, like, drive people there.
00:27:54.970 - 00:28:22.480, Speaker A: The l two game is still ongoing. I think people are still trying world coins going to make an l two, I think, just for their token, basically, because optimism mainnet is basically just their token right now, so they might as well do their own chain. You know, base has shown that if you have a good number of clients, it can be a good idea. So I heard Robin Hood might do an l two as well, is the rumor.
00:28:22.660 - 00:28:23.420, Speaker B: Wow.
00:28:23.960 - 00:28:24.700, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:25.000 - 00:28:31.220, Speaker C: There's rumors like, blackrock's gonna do an l two as well, which I don't know how real that is, but I wouldn't be that surprised.
00:28:32.520 - 00:28:42.740, Speaker A: Yeah, that might be a bit further out, but the Robin Hood stuff is pretty. He went on bankless the other day and he got asked about it and he didn't deny it. He's kind of just.
00:28:43.240 - 00:28:51.174, Speaker D: So do you think these larger institutions are, like, believing in the l two thesis more than maybe us crypto natives are or what the sentiment is on twitter, at least?
00:28:51.312 - 00:29:10.234, Speaker A: I don't know that they're believing in the thesis. I think they just want to chain. And then when you look at the options, you make some, like, random Cosmos, l one thing, whatever. Or you do an l two and you're kind of tied into the infrastructure. It's a lot easier and cheaper to run nowadays. Makes sense, I think. You know, we'll talk about this next week when we have k nine.
00:29:10.234 - 00:29:55.258, Speaker A: And I think it's one of the main topics because he's been so critical of ETH after being such a big supporter of the. So maybe we'll bring the topic up there, but something has to be done with the user experience and hopefully we get there. But nfts wise, just to wrap up there, I saw Doodles is still kicking and going, and they're releasing some locked up content that you need the NFT to unlock. And they're doing movies and I guess, like, pharrell is doing some music as well. So that's quite interesting. I think that relationship of having a community around content and having an NFT around it makes a lot of sense. So we'll see how that goes.
00:29:55.354 - 00:30:08.426, Speaker B: I think they're just fun to collect over the years. You have a wallet with a bunch of just random pictures you have. It kind of is fun. I just don't know. I always wonder what's the most you've.
00:30:08.458 - 00:30:09.630, Speaker A: Lost on an NFT?
00:30:10.530 - 00:30:18.970, Speaker B: Uh, I bought a bunch of the sea hams for, like, ten eth and, uh, yeah, those didn't do too great.
00:30:19.090 - 00:30:21.778, Speaker A: Uh, what are they at now? Is it like one or. What is it at?
00:30:21.794 - 00:30:23.270, Speaker B: What's probably under one?
00:30:24.490 - 00:30:26.282, Speaker A: How did it go down so much?
00:30:26.466 - 00:30:57.774, Speaker B: Uh, it was like the art blocks, um, they're like an art blocks, um, like cult kind of thing. And they were just funny ugly. And, uh, I bought the top. I like taking, like, I like to buy, like, nfts under, like, one eat because, like, the upside is really high or downsides, whatever you spent on it. So I didn't really. Most of the time when I, like, minted something rare, I just sell it because it's like, I don't really think this picture should be worth like 80k. It doesn't really make sense to me.
00:30:57.774 - 00:31:06.760, Speaker B: Like, the art block stuff was really fun. Like, oh, wow, seahams are. Maybe that's a difference. He .05 e maybe.
00:31:06.840 - 00:31:13.540, Speaker A: Bring, bring the chart back up, Justin. It was interesting to look at some of these collections. Yes. I haven't seen these in the trenches.
00:31:14.040 - 00:31:33.470, Speaker D: Interested in how, like, these things all become super cringe after enough, long enough time. Right. Like, all of your collections, they start out as, like, undiscovered. Then they get a little bit of hype. Then they become, like, the hot new thing, then they become mainstream and they become cringe. They all sort of seem to follow that pattern. The one that really hasn't is cryptopunks, in my opinion.
00:31:33.590 - 00:31:35.422, Speaker A: Can you sort these by market cap?
00:31:35.566 - 00:31:39.130, Speaker B: I haven't even, like, looked at NFT sites in a really long time.
00:31:39.470 - 00:31:40.502, Speaker C: Me neither.
00:31:40.686 - 00:31:41.530, Speaker D: Me neither.
00:31:41.910 - 00:31:57.000, Speaker A: Comparing this to meme coins, like, these are small. Like the number one, number one collection, like, iconic, everybody knows it. Crypto punks, which is, you know, the dogecoin of NFTs at 500 million, you know, much below the billions of, of.
00:31:57.340 - 00:32:14.076, Speaker D: But I think that this, for reference, this treats everything as a floor. I think. I think they're just multiplied in the floor price by the total supply. So 21.8 times 10,000 is 217. Because remember, there's those aliens that go for 20 mil, but it's still pretty close, right? It's within an order of magnitude.
00:32:14.188 - 00:32:54.894, Speaker A: Yeah, you're absolutely right. And that's a good point because I saw recently people discussing about where the market is moving towards in punks, and there's the concept of a clean punk. The clean punks are the ones that, you know, you're kind of, like, proud to have as a profile picture because there's nothing weird on them and they can actually, like, represent a real person. There's no, like, weird blotches or whatever. And apparently, like, clean punks are going for double the floor. Plus, we used to think that it was going to be based on, I think v one was rarity. People looked at the rarity of certain traits and they thought that the more rare it would be, more expensive.
00:32:54.894 - 00:33:26.558, Speaker A: That has mostly turned out to be false. Apart from, you know, a couple of extremely rare, you know, like aliens, for example. For most things, it's less about the rarity. It's ended up being like, how cool does this look? Is it 3d glasses? Is it a hoodie? Like, these are cool things that we want to associate with some of the more, like, minority ones. Like, women have not had as high of a floor. Probably just because, you know, if somebody wants to make it their identity, they want their own one. Unless we can talk to Kane about this.
00:33:26.558 - 00:33:32.850, Speaker A: I think some of them, there was a period where the, like, was it like the white haired girls were like.
00:33:33.190 - 00:33:35.462, Speaker B: Super, like the defi founders?
00:33:35.526 - 00:33:40.174, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. Hayden had that. Leshner, I think had one is pretty Santiago, I think.
00:33:40.262 - 00:33:48.824, Speaker B: Yeah, I missed that. I missed that, like, optimistic, like, delusion around, like, nfts. It just was fun. It was really fun.
00:33:48.992 - 00:34:04.740, Speaker C: But yeah, Justin, like, you two were pretty involved in the NFT scene. Like, at some, like, is there a price at which you would scoop some of these NFTs? I mean, I feel like there has to be some value here, right? Like somewhere.
00:34:05.120 - 00:34:23.878, Speaker B: I think you have a lot of time before, I mean, before, like, the market. Like, you'll. It'll be pretty obvious if it does, or else you're kind of just like stepping in front of a train of, like, dying interest. But if it does come back, it'll be like, it'll be fast. I think.
00:34:23.974 - 00:34:53.730, Speaker A: Let's quickly go through here. So we have crypto punks, you know, oh, gee, we have bored apes. I would say that that was the, you know, the hot girl during high school. It's not high school anymore, but, like, people still put some, you know, like, you want to show off that you could still go out with the hot girl from prom. It feels that way. It's not as popular with celebrities, obviously, anymore. We have pudgies, which has a leadership now that is doing some, you know, novel stuff.
00:34:53.730 - 00:35:28.440, Speaker A: And probably it's one of my favorite projects that I have a pudgy Azuki. Surprised it's doing okay compared to, you know, given all the fud they had with a remint collection, which ended up disastrous surprise. It's like, still, you know, under 10 million and milady's which is a cult coin, I think. No surprise there. Cults will generally have like, a core that just always going to hold mutant apes, which is the. I guess it's always been like a, you know, 10% of a bored ape. And then we have some of these.
00:35:28.440 - 00:35:41.072, Speaker A: This is where it gets interesting. So we have a couple of the bitcoin ones, right? Like node monkeys and bitcoin puppets, which I have a feeling like they're down a lot from their highs because I feel like these have been a lot higher. Quantum point.
00:35:41.176 - 00:35:44.060, Speaker C: Like quantum cat should be worth more, I feel.
00:35:44.440 - 00:36:09.760, Speaker B: I think it was. I went to one of the conferences, maybe it was ETh Denver and everyone could not stop talking about ordinals. And then, yeah, just like, since the runes came out, like, people just kind of stopped talking about. I think the puppets are funny. Um, but, yeah, I don't know. Like, I don't really even know. Outside of like, the top three collections of nfTs, I don't even know what I would buy.
00:36:10.220 - 00:36:12.760, Speaker A: I think you buy a crypto punk, maybe.
00:36:13.380 - 00:36:28.818, Speaker D: Yeah. Pudgy, if you're going to buy one, you should get the punk. Right? Like, I would abort ape is cringe. I mean, I don't think they can ever recover from that, pudgy. It's sort of played out, right? Well, I don't know. Depends who you ask, I guess. Azuki dead.
00:36:28.964 - 00:36:44.398, Speaker A: So mad lads is around six and a half k. That's one that is leading Solana. There is not much else nft culture in Solana right now. So. Surprised that's not higher, given that the chain itself is doing better. So that one is kind of interesting.
00:36:44.534 - 00:36:50.326, Speaker B: That was always weird to me that the NFT trading on Solana never came back to just the meme coins.
00:36:50.438 - 00:36:58.700, Speaker A: Right. Because it really started there. Like, that's where you could just do all these flipping cheap and minting cheap and everything.
00:36:58.780 - 00:37:11.240, Speaker B: Yeah, that's how they created, like, the Solana cult. Like, everyone was, like, minting all those nfts. Do you remember that fund that bought the Solana crypto punks for like half a million dollars?
00:37:12.340 - 00:37:13.532, Speaker C: Yeah, I remember that.
00:37:13.716 - 00:37:14.960, Speaker B: So funny.
00:37:16.300 - 00:37:26.110, Speaker D: Do you guys remember these, like, high brow art collections? Art blocks dropped like, ringers was one of them. And then there was. There was another one too.
00:37:26.810 - 00:37:27.186, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:37:27.218 - 00:37:31.590, Speaker D: The by Tyler Hobbs was the collection.
00:37:32.570 - 00:37:34.002, Speaker A: Yeah. The twisty ones.
00:37:34.146 - 00:37:39.434, Speaker D: Yeah. Fidenza squiggles. Well, squiggles, yes. But Fidenza Denzas.
00:37:39.562 - 00:37:46.194, Speaker A: I mean, these still must be expensive. I never seen it. Yeah, look at this. Like they're still like worth a lot.
00:37:46.322 - 00:37:47.674, Speaker C: They are 108.
00:37:47.722 - 00:37:48.114, Speaker A: What they.
00:37:48.162 - 00:37:49.230, Speaker C: Couple hundred, 80?
00:37:49.640 - 00:37:51.664, Speaker B: They went to like 200 or something.
00:37:51.832 - 00:37:54.968, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, generator arts, really cool. I generally like it.
00:37:54.984 - 00:38:12.736, Speaker A: I think FiDenzas is what cost people a lot of money last cycle because they do look amazing and they kind of convinced a lot of normal people that this is like normal art. Like, this is real art. You just buy the picture. And it did convince them I don't own a Fidenza. It is the one NFT that just.
00:38:12.768 - 00:38:16.720, Speaker D: For you could hang this up, right? I mean, I would. I would just be beautiful.
00:38:16.760 - 00:38:18.646, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:38:18.758 - 00:38:41.934, Speaker D: I want to. I want to get your guys's take on. If you guys remember. For me, this was the craziest top signal ever. I missed it. So it's a little, you know, I felt bad when I missed it, but now of course, like the price is zero. Do you guys remember loot? When everyone thought loot could be like the base layer for an rpg game on chain and like if you had a loot bag, you would have your quarter staff, your leather armor of power.
00:38:41.934 - 00:38:44.788, Speaker D: I mean, these things were going like crazy back in the day.
00:38:44.884 - 00:38:46.636, Speaker A: The VC's were buying these bags.
00:38:46.708 - 00:38:47.284, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:38:47.372 - 00:39:04.972, Speaker B: I have PTSD for missing this. A lot of my. I know a couple people made like eight figures on it and uh. Yeah, I just didn't read the group chat at the right time and totally missed it. I missed that. That optimism though, you know, it was fun. Even though it was like completely delusional.
00:39:04.972 - 00:39:06.040, Speaker B: I felt like.
00:39:08.340 - 00:39:43.932, Speaker A: Yeah, it's representative of crypto overall, that to have things that are just completely raw, there's a lot of theoretical potential. Like, yes, if everybody in the world decides to start making games and stacking things on top and making experiences on top of this completely nothing product, then yes, it could be everything we're dreaming of in the sky and the clouds and the castles are getting built. But it's just such a great representation of all of crypto because you could say that about so many things in the space that just get so hyped based on equivalent to a list of words.
00:39:44.116 - 00:40:34.496, Speaker D: But, like, now that we are all sober and like, are far away from this, like, just think about the level of like misapplied thinking. You have to get to from like, we have this list of texts to. It's worth millions of dollars, right? Like, you have to assume that someone's going to build AAAA game that actually has a real life product market fit on the scale of like a World of Warcraft or like modern warfare. Like Call of Duty games, they're going to use this, and then somehow, like, you're going to drive value to these items. Like, it is the craziest jump of logic if you think about it, and it's like a five year thesis at the very least. So, like, you, you're buying this thing in the hopes that, like, five years from now, there's going to be AAAA game on the level of, like, a World of Warcraft success or better, where people are actually valuing these items and these things are rare. And this collection is like the common collection for video games.
00:40:34.568 - 00:40:36.416, Speaker A: It's just you're not left curving up, man.
00:40:36.448 - 00:40:38.848, Speaker B: You got to imagine, though, that's why I missed it.
00:40:38.944 - 00:40:40.150, Speaker D: That's why I missed it.
00:40:40.280 - 00:40:44.350, Speaker B: Imagine it did happen, and you don't have a divine robe. How foolish would you feel.
00:40:48.010 - 00:40:53.274, Speaker C: In a parallel universe? Somewhere out there, you know, this is the future of finance, you know, future gaming.
00:40:53.442 - 00:41:03.338, Speaker B: Yeah, I just, I miss that optimism and, like, hopefulness of, like, crypto, even though, I don't know, it just gets, like, tiring when you see all this over and over and over again.
00:41:03.434 - 00:41:27.038, Speaker D: But the thing is, we need a new. A new game or a new meta or new narrative or a new belief system to get there again. Because, like, just think about the four, how the four of us are talking and analyzing these nfts and looking at this in retrospect. Like, that same playbook is certainly not going to work with us, and I don't think it's going to work with anyone else in this space that's been around. And so that's why we really do need, like, a new meta, a new game, a new innovation, something like that.
00:41:27.174 - 00:41:42.278, Speaker A: I mean, you sound like the guy entering a casino. It's like, the guy, like, oh, like, you know, I've already played this slot machine. I didn't win in this one. Like, I need, like, a new fancy kind of coins falling, and, like, we need a new one. So I can believe, so I can believe that I can win the jackpot.
00:41:42.374 - 00:41:57.906, Speaker D: The slot machine isn't enough because the slot machine is, like, clearly negative ev, and most people lose. And the upside isn't that great. The reason why all this stuff worked is because it seemed positive ev at the time, and it seemed like everyone was winning, and, like, we're just never going to get there without new innovation and new tech.
00:41:58.058 - 00:42:07.274, Speaker B: That was meme coins. Meme coins are like, the new. The meme coins just basically represent, like, everything you just said. I think we're, it was so short.
00:42:07.322 - 00:42:29.778, Speaker D: Lived because everyone intuitively knows most people are going to lose money on that. The upside is capped. These things don't actually do anything. Like, there's no grand vision there. There was like, as silly as it was, there was a grand vision behind the loot. Right. And these other NFts like that, you were creating long lasting ip and it's hard to imagine we get to the next leg up in the cycle of optimism without a new thing.
00:42:29.914 - 00:42:45.342, Speaker B: I've seen some crazy threads on Twitter talking about meme coins being cult coins and the future of online loneliness, blah, blah, blah. And maybe just the same idea shifted to the meme coins now.
00:42:45.526 - 00:42:46.606, Speaker D: Yeah, maybe.
00:42:46.758 - 00:43:05.220, Speaker A: What do you guys think about mother? I've seen iggy just keeps pushing. We've talked about this coin before. Like, good for her. She is dedicated. I went to Twitter and I didn't realize how much, like, she is posting constantly. She got like, you know, her, her ass cheeks and, like, a bybit, like, little shorts. I don't know if you can bring this up.
00:43:05.220 - 00:43:12.060, Speaker A: I was like, she is dedicated to get a listing. She is. She's. I mean, I don't.
00:43:12.920 - 00:43:16.940, Speaker B: But I am really surprised she stuck around.
00:43:17.800 - 00:43:19.820, Speaker C: She's one of us. She's a builder.
00:43:20.480 - 00:43:27.128, Speaker B: I think she's going, do you see that tweet where she said she's going insane, you guys? One day to the moon, next day it's all over.
00:43:27.264 - 00:43:29.488, Speaker D: Yeah, we shared that, I think, last week.
00:43:29.664 - 00:43:59.938, Speaker A: Yeah, look at this one. Look at this. She gave them, like, you know, a million impressions. I don't, I just don't know who the target audience is because, like, if she had a cooler name for it, but mother is like, you know, you know, everyone's like, mom. My mom is lame. You know, you got this, like, teenager boys trying to gamble on this. Is she tapping into, like, the, the lonely men on her onlyfans that want the mother? Like, exactly.
00:43:59.938 - 00:44:01.298, Speaker A: I don't get it. What is the mommy?
00:44:01.314 - 00:44:03.748, Speaker C: They want a mommy. People want a mommy. That's what they want.
00:44:03.764 - 00:44:30.148, Speaker A: But he could be called mommy. Mommy would be better than mother. He was like, mommy. But I'm not the target market, clearly, but, like, who? I'm not sure. And the coin is a little bit underperforming compared to her level of, you know, notoriety and, like, how much she's putting into it. It's, and, you know, you got BWF behind it, but it hasn't, hasn't done that well.
00:44:30.324 - 00:44:35.828, Speaker C: It is worth $40 million. I mean, $40 million is something, you know, maybe she's.
00:44:35.884 - 00:44:50.396, Speaker B: But most people just trade that first. That first parabola, and then they're. They never touch. They delete it from their watch list and never look at it again. So you gotta figure out a way to, like, drive that attention back. And I don't really know how you do it with meme coins.
00:44:50.548 - 00:45:05.190, Speaker A: I mean, she is getting engagement on her tweets, so there seems to be some attention, unless it's a fake accounts, but by all means, like, there's tension still there. It's just. It's worth, you know, 100th of a pepe or something.
00:45:06.170 - 00:45:07.790, Speaker D: Still a hundred x potential.
00:45:08.290 - 00:45:13.650, Speaker B: Yeah, she just doesn't have the cabal around her. That's what it is, maybe.
00:45:13.730 - 00:45:23.726, Speaker A: Yes, that's probably true. Let's do some pastas. So pasta the week time. Let's start with Justin. Let's put you on the spot.
00:45:23.918 - 00:45:41.606, Speaker D: Perfect. You know, this one hit close to home. I get to give a shout out to Ansem. I felt personally attacked with this one. Dot eth's calling the bottom on eth BTC, and it's this quote tweet of this tweet from some random account. Life happens. You got your picture of your girlfriend on your stomach, Carla.
00:45:41.606 - 00:45:56.088, Speaker D: Shout out to her and then didn't work out. Got to get rid of her. But let's try it again. You know, this is a. This girl is really special. She means a lot to me. Didn't work out again, and then had to get the tattoo put on on the third breakup in the third rebound.
00:45:56.088 - 00:46:09.032, Speaker D: So I felt this. Like, how many times on this podcast have we talked about the EBTC bottom? How many times have I said, like, if there's any time it's bottoming, it's now, and the bottom never bottoms. So I don't know.
00:46:09.216 - 00:46:11.460, Speaker B: I think you need therapy at this point.
00:46:12.400 - 00:46:13.780, Speaker C: We all need therapy.
00:46:14.240 - 00:46:15.020, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:16.410 - 00:46:18.150, Speaker A: Bergy. Let's see what you got.
00:46:18.810 - 00:46:30.950, Speaker B: I got this old tweet from the sister time with NFTs. They bought two of these. $250,000 for the Solana punk. So 18.
00:46:33.610 - 00:46:36.470, Speaker D: With, like, the Solana blue purple in the background.
00:46:37.010 - 00:46:40.270, Speaker B: The worst part is they bought two of these. This is.
00:46:41.050 - 00:46:47.962, Speaker C: Look at the date. It's 911 2021. Geez, the market timing is uncanny.
00:46:47.986 - 00:46:55.150, Speaker D: So are these guys still active? Are they still tweeting? Wow. They just invested in open social protocol.
00:46:55.610 - 00:46:56.630, Speaker C: Good for them.
00:46:57.610 - 00:46:58.738, Speaker A: Block Lords.
00:46:58.914 - 00:47:04.450, Speaker B: They survived, and they got the rarest punk on Salama 18th.
00:47:04.490 - 00:47:05.950, Speaker A: Rarest punk.
00:47:06.540 - 00:47:13.600, Speaker C: Mean, they're very skilled. They spent half a mil on that, and they're still around. They're one of us. No, props to them.
00:47:13.900 - 00:47:24.900, Speaker A: I did find it super lame that Solana was just copying the apes. They had, like, the Solana apes and then Solana punks. I mean, it's just like, come up with something new.
00:47:25.060 - 00:47:34.530, Speaker D: At least in fairness to them, though, like, do you, do you remember there was like a six month period where, like, every day a new 10,000 PFP collection launched and it was just like, basically a copy past of the last one?
00:47:34.690 - 00:47:38.778, Speaker A: Yeah. And I know. Well, it was like. Yeah. Like open sea kind of stuff.
00:47:38.794 - 00:47:39.350, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:47:40.650 - 00:47:56.370, Speaker A: I do remember normies that I know that are not in crypto telling me that they were staying up all night trying to get the mint of, like, those things back then. So it. It did get the attention. Like you said, it got the dopamine going back then.
00:47:56.450 - 00:48:00.870, Speaker C: Yeah. And one question. Do you guys remember the goblins Nft during the bear?
00:48:01.050 - 00:48:01.770, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:48:02.270 - 00:48:08.222, Speaker C: Twitter spaces with, like, the oil, they went, like ten e. I made an.
00:48:08.246 - 00:48:10.094, Speaker D: Eth off those things. I was very happy.
00:48:10.182 - 00:48:12.734, Speaker C: Oh, really? What the heck? You're better.
00:48:12.782 - 00:48:18.630, Speaker A: I think that one kind of was like collective therapy. Like, they were paying to just join therapy sessions with each other.
00:48:18.790 - 00:48:25.134, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember everyone was, like, spreading rumors that it was like the board eight team and stuff like that.
00:48:25.142 - 00:48:26.738, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, I remember that.
00:48:26.814 - 00:48:37.074, Speaker B: Yeah. People just love to, like, speculate on, like, the theories of, like, who actually did it and all this. It was. It was a little cringe, but it was fun at least.
00:48:37.202 - 00:48:39.630, Speaker A: Cool. Taiki, what do you got?
00:48:40.010 - 00:49:09.100, Speaker C: Yeah, so I found this tweet, which I thought was funny, and I guess, you know, kind of how not to write an investor update, if you can click on that. After our previous fundraising round, I suffered a wrist injury due to the extensive work on the pitch deck. This, combined with recurring back pain, severely impacted my ability to sleep in work. I restarted a disciplined regimen of yoga and other therapies to help manage them. But it's like, this guy claims to have a wrist injury because he was, like, pitching too hard and now he can't work. Boundaries. They winning.
00:49:09.180 - 00:49:10.080, Speaker D: Oh, man.
00:49:10.620 - 00:49:14.480, Speaker A: Everyone. Everyone doesn't believe it's real. And which probably makes it real.
00:49:15.140 - 00:49:18.120, Speaker C: Yeah, it says comfy cap says real gets works, actually.
00:49:18.540 - 00:49:34.514, Speaker A: All right, so for my pasta, I was inspired by the Olympics. We had some amazing athletes. And, Justin, I think this is. This is one that if you ever dream of going to the Olympics, this. This might be the sport for you. I don't know if you saw this australian break breakdancer. This is worse than anthem boxing.
00:49:34.514 - 00:49:35.630, Speaker A: WTF?
00:49:37.770 - 00:49:56.410, Speaker D: The thing is, it's just not that complex like we should. You know, we've got our steady lads fan base. It's only growing. We could get some sponsorships, and we could have, like, a steady leds break dancing team at the Olympics. Like, if we spent four years doing this instead of talking about stupid pfps and pictures and meme coins. This could be us.
00:49:57.630 - 00:50:05.862, Speaker A: Absolutely. I see the. The Millie comment there is that razzle can. I mean, this is very crypto Twitter. Like, this is. We understand this. This is how we feel after.
00:50:05.966 - 00:50:17.438, Speaker D: And we have a dancer in the mist. I don't know if you know this, Jordy, but Tikey actually was a bigwig high school dancer in the K pop space. Do we. Do we have that clip we can pull up?
00:50:17.574 - 00:50:19.150, Speaker A: Let's get the clip up. We need to see.
00:50:19.190 - 00:50:28.266, Speaker D: I think your dancing was more impressive tyche thandejdeze than anything we saw out of the breakdancers. Taiki. From high school or from middle school in 2011. You're in the orange here, Taiki.
00:50:28.378 - 00:50:29.550, Speaker C: Yes, that's me.
00:50:42.170 - 00:50:45.754, Speaker A: You remember the choreography? Can you do it now, Taiki? No, I know.
00:50:45.802 - 00:50:55.496, Speaker C: I'm not gonna do it now. I actually remember most of it. It's like, most of my. Like, I worked on this, so I worked so hard on this. I have zero shame. Like, I don't give a fuck.
00:50:55.528 - 00:51:00.260, Speaker D: You know, honestly, was this good for your dating career in middle school, or how did. How did it all play out?
00:51:00.680 - 00:51:04.620, Speaker C: Well, I'm engaged now, so I'd say it turned out fine.
00:51:05.040 - 00:51:25.120, Speaker A: Prepared him well for a, you know, a career as a crypto personality. You know, having no shame is good. Cool. All right, well, we'll let the. Let the chat choose in the poll. We'll put up the Twitter poll as usual. Thank you, iceberg, for joining us on another challenging week in the crypto markets.
00:51:25.120 - 00:51:40.180, Speaker A: But we are optimistic. We are. We're heading west. Right? That's the thing. So it's not for everybody. It's for Djen. So if you're a djen, we're going east, actually.
00:51:40.180 - 00:51:44.732, Speaker A: All right, see you guys. Take care.
00:51:44.796 - 00:51:46.020, Speaker B: See ya. Thanks for having me.
