00:00:20.240 - 00:00:20.552, Speaker A: Jordy.
00:00:20.552 - 00:00:20.944, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:00:20.974 - 00:00:21.334, Speaker A: We're live.
00:00:21.374 - 00:00:45.084, Speaker C: We're live. All right. We've been having a good time in the, in the preparation here, so please, everybody, like and subscribe. We're going to have a fun episode. Make sure you click every time. We always get more views than we actually have subscribers. So, I mean, someone hasn't clicked yet.
00:00:46.184 - 00:00:47.524, Speaker A: Yeah, we're e beggars.
00:00:48.064 - 00:01:30.814, Speaker C: Cool. Let's roll. All right, everybody, welcome to episode 42 of Steady Lads. We have a great guest with us, someone that I've been following for quite a while and has a lot of hot takes. So we're going to have fun. So I'm Jody, as usual. I'm the founder of Selena Capital, and, uh, we have a full, full house today.
00:01:30.814 - 00:01:46.158, Speaker C: So we have thicky back as well. Vicki, welcome. His hair is back as well. Um, uh, Justin is, uh, as always, with us.
00:01:46.326 - 00:01:51.914, Speaker B: I see, uh, some comments. Don't look at the ethereum price action. Don't look at Eth BTC.
00:01:52.534 - 00:01:53.118, Speaker C: Oh, God.
00:01:53.166 - 00:01:54.274, Speaker A: Never look at it.
00:01:54.834 - 00:01:55.642, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:55.818 - 00:02:00.202, Speaker C: You know, Justin, I'm glad that I jumped off the ETH BTC train for a while. I left it.
00:02:00.258 - 00:02:05.414, Speaker B: Never forget in January, you said, didn't you say ETH BTC is going to zero eight 0.09.
00:02:06.074 - 00:02:24.580, Speaker C: It was an ETF thesis once. You told me that one. We're not. We don't bring that one up. So Taiki is with us, full time researcher and podcaster extraordinaire. How many podcasts are you doing, Taiki? Are you doing, like, eight different podcasts, or how many?
00:02:24.652 - 00:02:27.744, Speaker A: I'm just doing two. I'm just doing this and, like, my own channel.
00:02:28.124 - 00:02:30.964, Speaker C: But your channel has, like, different series and stuff.
00:02:31.004 - 00:02:38.980, Speaker A: You're doing, like, the wizards, and it's only the wizards. Yeah, I'm kind of taking a chill right now. Yeah. Try not to burn out.
00:02:39.012 - 00:02:46.580, Speaker C: Okay. And we have the co host of Good Game podcast. We have chow with us. How are you doing?
00:02:46.732 - 00:02:46.996, Speaker B: Good.
00:02:47.020 - 00:02:48.144, Speaker D: Good. Good to hear.
00:02:49.204 - 00:03:13.102, Speaker C: You've been, you've been posting some really interesting tweets, and I have to say, I've been following you for a long time. I don't always agree what you're saying, but always makes me think, and that's really valuable. So excited to get into some of the hot takes you have. Maybe some of them are not so hot, but we'll go through. But let's kick off with the brutal price action. And maybe, Justin, don't put the ETH BTC chart. Put, like.
00:03:13.102 - 00:03:16.654, Speaker C: But just put the overall beta chart. Maybe.
00:03:17.194 - 00:03:20.694, Speaker B: What is the overall beta chart. Like, you want to see total?
00:03:21.074 - 00:03:25.570, Speaker C: Just bit? Yeah, I don't know, whatever. Bitcoin or something. Okay, here we go.
00:03:25.682 - 00:03:26.614, Speaker B: This is total.
00:03:27.994 - 00:03:29.410, Speaker C: Yeah, let's.
00:03:29.442 - 00:03:31.094, Speaker B: Let's pull up BTC. Yeah.
00:03:36.314 - 00:03:36.890, Speaker A: Looks the same.
00:03:36.922 - 00:03:59.214, Speaker C: Oh, wow. Okay. You know abawat from Abawat paid group infamously. He's been tweeting every week that, like, you know, there's all this drama. We're up and down and we're always at 63k. It just seems like every week we're like, bang on 63 no matter what. So maybe, like, I'll be happy with 63.
00:03:59.214 - 00:04:01.634, Speaker C: I don't know. Thank you. How are you seeing the current market?
00:04:02.174 - 00:04:37.114, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm actually supposed to, like, do some debate with Owa tonight on some podcast, but it looks like we're just chopping lower, like, kind of lower highs, lower lows. The inflows of, like, kind of stops consistently, and they're like, you know, like one time, two time things on just, like, market narratives. But, you know, it looks like unless someone big, like the pension funds or the bigger allocators step in and buy the ETF, then, like, we're just going to continue this, like, slow bleed into the summer.
00:04:38.574 - 00:04:43.794, Speaker C: Are you. Are you shorting or you just staying up? Are you just, like, chilling? It seems like you're chilling.
00:04:45.814 - 00:04:51.674, Speaker E: I have some small shorts on alts and long bitcoin versus, but, like, net flat.
00:04:52.854 - 00:05:01.874, Speaker A: We've been doing this podcast for 42 weeks, and I feel like Dickey's always long bitcoin, short alts every single week. This is like shorting the vaporware.
00:05:02.824 - 00:05:08.384, Speaker C: Xiao, do you, do you trade actively or do you just kind of do longer term?
00:05:08.504 - 00:05:21.964, Speaker D: I do longer term. Like, my liquid portfolio is around one cycle. One cycle time horizon. I don't do short term trading unless there's some new super interesting meta, like meme coins and stuff like that.
00:05:23.224 - 00:05:38.304, Speaker C: Yeah, you've been one of the people that has been rather early on. Some of the majority things, I guess, like meme coins and Solana, which, in fact, I would say that those two kind of go together, right? Like, they're sort of the same meta in a way. Would you agree?
00:05:38.464 - 00:05:39.204, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:05:40.544 - 00:05:41.284, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:41.704 - 00:05:46.272, Speaker B: What are your thoughts on Eth BTC, though? I think that's probably whatever. What's on everyone's mind, right?
00:05:46.448 - 00:05:48.324, Speaker A: It's only on your mind, Justin.
00:05:49.624 - 00:06:12.884, Speaker D: I don't understand why everyone's so obsessed with ETH. Because it's like we're in, like, an asset class that has the potential to grow 100 x. Why would you do, like, you know, delta neutral trading on our standard. Just. Just long both. I mean, I can tell you I'm bearish eth BTC, but doesn't mean I'm shorting eTh and long BTC. I'm just long both.
00:06:14.424 - 00:06:35.344, Speaker B: I think people are less doing the paratrade and more. So we're in a comparison based industry, right? Like, if ETH is underperforming BTC, everyone in the BTC camp and the sole camp is dug on ETH and vice versa. So I think that's where the angst on my part comes from, is just perpetually getting dunked on from the live chat on Twitter everywhere. I need. I need a break.
00:06:35.884 - 00:07:15.600, Speaker D: So the barricades for ETH BTC is very clear to me. It's just that ETH is over owned by crypto natives and it just doesn't have. It doesn't have two things. It doesn't have the real inflow that BTC has from the ETF because ETH doesn't have the ETF yet. And it doesn't have the, you know, the latest shiny thing of Solana where all the. All the retail is, all the retail activity is happening. So just comparatively, most of the mind share and flow goes to BTC and Solana as opposed to ETH this cycle.
00:07:15.600 - 00:07:26.274, Speaker D: It's just that simple. But I'm still bullish, eve. It's just relative speaking. If BTC is kind of. Yeah, it's kind of dead.
00:07:26.614 - 00:08:18.190, Speaker C: Do you think about, like, the different categories of, you know, money that comes into space and how big they are? Because, you know, there's the tradfi money, there's the casual gambling money, there's like the sort of VC money that I find that the most interesting. And nobody, like, really talks about how the VC money goes through these, like, waterfalls because it funds all the infrastructure stuff. And we'll get to, like, you know, whether that's starting to get overdone, but it funds it up. And so, you know, that ends up being a lot of what retail buys. Maybe not anymore, but that's historically been a lot of what's been bought or the alto ones and stuff, like, out of these categories of money. And maybe there's a crypto native money, which is like, all us dj's that are here right now. Like, you know, the hundreds of people watching and, you know, we buy fantasy top and friend tech and nobody else like this.
00:08:18.190 - 00:08:30.614, Speaker C: So niche, I feel like it's kind of niche. Like, this is like for the. For the. For the full degens. I don't know. How much money we have. It seems to be, like, every time something successful launches in our category, it's like around eight figures of how much money it makes.
00:08:30.614 - 00:08:32.794, Speaker C: Is that. That sound about accurate?
00:08:37.574 - 00:08:40.634, Speaker A: Is that a lot? Is there, like, value?
00:08:41.963 - 00:08:50.539, Speaker C: How many fees they make? Like, how much fees they make, or how much revenue? Like, you know, frontech, I think, made like 60, 70 million. Or how much did they make?
00:08:50.691 - 00:09:10.524, Speaker D: Friendtech made, like, what, 50, I think. Yeah, same. The ballpark, as you said, fantasy is, what, close to ten? Just in a few days. And then Pompe is just crushing it, like. Like annualized. If you analyze the number, it's like 100 million, and there's no sign of slowing down.
00:09:12.424 - 00:09:17.124, Speaker C: It hasn't tapered off yet. People haven't, like, given up on trying to.
00:09:18.184 - 00:09:22.524, Speaker D: Since BTC stalled? Like, since the overall market stalled.
00:09:24.384 - 00:09:34.964, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, what do you think about that specific narrative? Are people going to keep thinking that they can make the next big meme coin and keep trying to do it themselves, or at some point they'll just give up?
00:09:36.924 - 00:10:19.164, Speaker D: I think that the meme coin super cycle thing is probably here to stay. Like, it's actually super cycle. I don't have any reason to believe otherwise, because there's a fundamental demand for meme coins, which is the aha moment was recently when I talked to sports betting. An executive from a sports betting web, two sports betting website, a very popular one, and he told me that they're losing a lot of market share to meme coins. I don't know how exactly they figured that out. Probably by talking to their users, like, who left the sports betting website to trade meme coins. But if you think about it, if you think about sports betting and meme coins, it's fundamentally the same thing.
00:10:19.164 - 00:10:48.614, Speaker D: The primary value proposition is gambling is making some money, and the secondary valid proposition is entertainment. Right? Like, people love talking about the latest, funniest memes. And on top of that, meme coins are actually strictly better than sports betting, in a sense that the upside is unlimited, whereas sports betting, the outcome is binary. You lose or you win.
00:10:48.994 - 00:10:58.820, Speaker C: Oh, you haven't, like, you haven't done these, like, you know, you can do a parlay, like a 18 parlay. I've seen some of these things hit where you put, like, a dollar and you get, like, eight of them, right?
00:10:58.892 - 00:11:28.256, Speaker B: Yeah. But one thing I'll say, charles, like, the customer is very different here, right? Like, the person buying meme coins. This is just my idea of their Persona is more like nerdy, geeky, like, online native into memes into Internet culture, whereas the sports better is someone totally different, right? Like, it's someone that's into sports. Like, maybe doing it socially. They're watching the games. Like, I think there's very little overlap of, like, dGen, meme coin speculators, and sports bettors, but could just be my impressions.
00:11:28.360 - 00:12:07.714, Speaker D: I think the current users are probably quite different, but fundamentally, they solve the same problem of, number one, making the upside, and number two, the entertainment, and also just push back a little bit on the current user Persona of meme coins. So we incubated pump, and I talk to the pump founders all the time, and I asked them, like, what time, what type of users use pump. And one time they told me that there's like, this truck driver in Alabama that get some meme coin and trade them. So, like, these are not DJ, these are not crypto native degens. These are like normies.
00:12:09.334 - 00:12:50.790, Speaker C: Let's. You saw the sisyphus tweet where he just, where he talked about trying to use it and make a meme coin. And I thought, like, I don't know, Sisyphus, it feels like he, you know, he had, he had a bad rep, but he's been on a comeback arc. I feel like, you know, he was one of the few people that shared the friendtech airdrop, and then he's been, like, having some pretty, like, pretty reasonable takes. Can we. You saw his tweet where he said that he, he went through the cycle of trying to, trying to find it, but he said that, you know, it's still about trying to find influencers ultimately to, to kind of like, pump the. And make it fun.
00:12:50.790 - 00:12:53.094, Speaker C: Is that, is that fair that it's still around?
00:12:53.134 - 00:13:28.314, Speaker D: Like, influencers 100%, like, width did not succeed by itself. Like, it's like the growth, the early growth of every successful meme point is not organic. Whiff succeeded large part due to Anzim, a very large part. And with, actually has a marketing department, in case you don't, you're not aware, like, wif has this telegram group. They call it the marketing department of wif. I'm not part of it, but I know that exists and something's part of it. And then there's a few others, and that group is the group that put the huge hat on.
00:13:28.314 - 00:13:34.430, Speaker D: So people are actually doing stuff to meme, this thing into existence.
00:13:34.622 - 00:14:12.382, Speaker C: The thing with marketing groups for meme coins. I feel like from a game theory perspective, you quickly run into, like, a free rider problem because everyone's gonna get the benefit. And so, like, you don't really wanna be the one to pay for it. Like, if someone's gonna pay 600k for Vegas fear, why should you put the money when you're gonna just equally benefit? And so you kind of, like, run into this problem. It seems to work well when you have a small telegram group, like you said, when it's early, but when it's, like, late stage, it just feels hard to, like, why should I put the 600k? Like, somebody else should do it.
00:14:12.478 - 00:14:22.514, Speaker D: Yeah, but then your market, the marketing in the later stage is you telling your friends to buy it. Like, at the later stage, it becomes more organic.
00:14:22.974 - 00:14:33.554, Speaker C: Yeah. So we have. We have this tweet. I mean, we can gonna go through. This was a banger tweet. 3.4 million views, where he talks about making a Catholic.
00:14:33.554 - 00:15:01.790, Speaker C: This cat is Catholic. I don't know how funny that is. He seems to think it's funny. He burned his side of it and then he again, you know, very unlike Sisyphus, but he just burnt his side of the allocation, didn't dump on anybody. And maybe let's kind of scroll down a little bit and see, like, what he said. He's like, 123456. Is that everyone at this point just expects it's a rug.
00:15:01.790 - 00:15:29.888, Speaker C: Because there's so many rugs. Like, it's like 99 for. I guess. So he says you need to get coordinated, chilling, just to get critical mass. And transparency is bad. This is like some of the kind of, like, really upside down stuff that you would expect, where everyone has, like, common side wallets. You need a massive support.
00:15:29.888 - 00:15:48.894, Speaker C: This is what you said. You need a massive support staff to make meme coin. Go up moderators 24/7 manage Twitter, do raids and kols. And this is maybe his hottest take. He says vibe coins are at risk of dying below 100 million. Above 100 million, it becomes more real. What do you think of that?
00:15:50.434 - 00:16:04.664, Speaker D: I said this exact sentence to my friends when with first started, like, 100 mil is the mark where meme coins start becoming more organic. Before that, you need this group to constantly pump it, basically.
00:16:05.284 - 00:16:43.494, Speaker B: Let me ask you guys a fun little hypothetical. So we were talking about this at Astaria. We're like, we've been spending years and putting a lot of funding into building this real tech, and we're super proud of that. But then it got me thinking, like, hmm, what if we put all this time and money into just launching meme coins? Like, you could try to launch one a day, one a week, and give, like, an earnest effort with a full on marketing team, like, I'm very curious if there's going to be teams and, like, professional influencers just raising to make meme coins and just raising, you know, millions of dollars just to sort of pump these out over weeks and months and just see what sticks. Do you think that's going to be a viable thing that that happens in the future? Is that already happening?
00:16:44.674 - 00:16:50.574, Speaker D: I mean, I'm not surprised if it's already happening. I don't know of any, but I'm not. I wouldn't be surprised.
00:16:50.954 - 00:17:15.980, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we, we already have. I think there's, like, a poly market that where, like, before a certain date, like, will Trump say the word bowdoin? And I think there was, like, a Trump conference and someone, like, went there and asked Trump if he knows bowdoin. And I don't think he. I mean, obviously Trump has no idea what's fuck's going on, but I mean, like, people. People are. People are literally, like, working for their bags, you know?
00:17:16.132 - 00:17:16.436, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:17:16.460 - 00:17:34.393, Speaker A: Like, I mean, people can, like, spy this and just, like, go to all the Trump conferences and just keep saying a word about him and then eventually maybe he'll say it. So this is like alpha generation, I guess, in this type of market, you just. Just harass Trump to say bowdoin. This is ridiculous. Yeah, I thought it's super funny, though.
00:17:35.053 - 00:17:36.993, Speaker E: 9% seems very low.
00:17:39.453 - 00:17:53.462, Speaker B: Are you buying sticky if you think 9% is low. Boy, do I have a poly market you should bet on? I've got 10% for June 30.
00:17:53.598 - 00:17:54.794, Speaker E: That one should be zero.
00:17:55.294 - 00:17:56.834, Speaker A: That one should be zero.
00:17:59.174 - 00:18:26.428, Speaker C: But, chow, do you, like, do you feel like there's a category of users that wants more skill based kind of gambling in the category that just wants. A lot of us are ex poker players here. We kind of got attracted to the game. And crypto can have similar games where you're trying to, like, outsmart other people and try to learn and level up, and then you have, like, gambling where it's like roulette, you know, you're just kind of randomly doing stuff and hoping for the best.
00:18:26.556 - 00:18:27.264, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:28.844 - 00:18:44.570, Speaker C: Which. Which category do you. Do you kind of feel is. Is bigger? And has crypto done enough on the skill based category, or is that just trading? I guess the OG crypto product is trading. And maybe, you know, you could say, like, leverage trading is kind of that equivalent.
00:18:44.682 - 00:18:56.134, Speaker D: I feel like in any market, the skill base is in the minority. It's like, less than 5% and 95% is the zero sum. Pure gambling. Do you agree or no?
00:18:56.474 - 00:19:02.178, Speaker C: I mean, they're both zero sum theoretically. Like, the PvP stuff is also zero sum.
00:19:02.306 - 00:19:22.394, Speaker D: As you said, zero ev. There's the people who have no idea what they're doing and purity in for the upside, but with zero ev, and then there's the 5% who know what they're doing, or at least think they know what they're doing and have a positive ev. I think that's the case in any market. Right.
00:19:23.334 - 00:19:52.346, Speaker C: Well, I would say that with trading the liquid markets like bitcoin eth, you just randomly take a position. Yeah, it's like zero ev. Once you get out to the smaller coins, there's just so much manipulation and insider information happening that the more liquid you get, you can have a lot of ev if you, you know, if you're manipulating the market versus if you're just being the person that's trying to short TRB because TRB went up too much and then, you know, wake up and it gets liquidated.
00:19:52.490 - 00:20:25.324, Speaker D: Yeah. I mean, that's like, related to this. I haven't touched meme coins for a very long time because in December, December, January, December last year and January this year, meme coins felt organic. But today it just feels a lot of it is just very tacky. And I don't want to touch the market when everyone is launching meme coins. Like, it doesn't feel fun anymore, at least for me personally.
00:20:26.304 - 00:20:45.304, Speaker C: Let's go through some of Chao's other takes because they're generally negative. You feel like a lot of stuff is maybe overdone. Talking about just getting listed on Binance and that's it. That was working for quite a while. Do you think that's not working anymore?
00:20:46.764 - 00:21:03.284, Speaker D: I think right now there's just an oversupply of projects and tokens applying to get listed on Binance and Coinbase and others. And there's no way exchanges can list everything because they're bombarded with hundreds, if not thousands of listing applications.
00:21:04.504 - 00:21:10.872, Speaker C: Yeah, it's probably the most stressful job in an exchange is dealing with listings.
00:21:11.048 - 00:21:39.474, Speaker D: Yeah. And in fact, the exchange listing teams now act more like VC's in a sense that they have to do a lot of due diligence. If they list a bad project, they get a lot of reputational damage, potentially legal damage as well. And they are actually incentivized to listen projects with real traction because the users of the product itself can bring volume and trading to the exchange.
00:21:40.494 - 00:22:07.364, Speaker B: I mean, don't you think this playbook is very much still working? I mean, yes, there's like an oversupply of projects listing but at the same time, they're listing at very high valuations. And yes, of course they're going down a little bit as supply unlocks and whatnot, but there's still so much money to be made here. I'd be surprised if the playbook changes. Right. I mean, we're seeing project, you know, a few hundred million dollar to a few billion dollar valuation is standard for launch now with good listings.
00:22:08.064 - 00:22:20.884, Speaker D: If you end up getting listed, yeah, of course you're gonna make a lot of money. But if you, if you look at the EV of playing this, this playbook, I think it's a lot worse than it was a few years ago.
00:22:21.594 - 00:22:23.018, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:22:23.146 - 00:22:37.974, Speaker C: I mean, there was a point in the cycle that I was commenting, I don't know, around episode 20 or 25, where we were in that alt layer dimension period, where it just felt like anything that was getting listed was like, you know, instantly, five to 10 billion.
00:22:41.554 - 00:23:12.032, Speaker B: Oh, it looks like we might have lost Jordy mid conversation too. While we wait for him to come back, chow. I did have another tweet wanted to ask you about, which I think is something I've talked about here as well, a few times. Basically, the TL doctor of this tweet, as I understand it, is there's so many l two s and so few projects. Can you go into that a little bit? Like where does, where does the steady state end up? Where does this resolve? Because these projects and l two s that are launching, are launching at hundred million dollar valuations plus multiple hundred or billions.
00:23:12.128 - 00:23:39.400, Speaker D: Yeah. So this l two problem is actually related to the other problem of oversupply of products. Right. By definition, there's too many l two s. I'm actually not surprised by the total number of l two s. I actually saw this coming a year or two ago. But what I didn't see a year ago was that all these hundreds of l two s that are, that are launching, they are generic l two s.
00:23:39.400 - 00:24:07.214, Speaker D: A year ago, I thought that was going to happen was the app chain fuses where there's going to be hundreds, if not thousands of apps launching their own chains. And the chain serves that one app only and no other apps. But what's actually happening today is there's dozens, if not hundreds of generic L2s trying to become platforms right off the bat, rather than starting off as an app. So that's the current status.
00:24:07.874 - 00:24:27.928, Speaker B: I think you're right. But I do think app chains are going to be a thing, because actually, when we talk to investors about Astaria or talk to other teams, like, and it's on our mind too. It's on literally everyone's mind. Like when are you going to deploy your own l two? Right. Because that's what the market is rewarding. And so I do think we'll, we'll see a lot of that in the future, too. I just think it's still early for that.
00:24:28.056 - 00:24:31.448, Speaker D: Yeah, and I agree with you. Go ahead.
00:24:31.616 - 00:24:40.174, Speaker A: Yeah, and like the recent l two launch was mode. And Justin, if you can share my screen. Like, this thing got just dumped to oblivion. I was about to bring this up too.
00:24:40.214 - 00:24:40.894, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:24:41.014 - 00:25:08.004, Speaker A: Yeah, like I'm in a few discords and you know, some discords are like just dedicated or they were dedicated to farming this thing and they have, I mean, they made a bunch of money even at this price. And like there is no differentiator, right? I mean, like no one's on build, like no one's like doing stuff on mode. And I mean, I guess this maybe 400 million FDB is like a pretty fair valuation at this point. Where is invested can click on Bybit.
00:25:08.984 - 00:25:10.684, Speaker E: Yeah, I think I want some bybit.
00:25:11.384 - 00:25:12.200, Speaker C: Okay.
00:25:12.352 - 00:25:26.284, Speaker E: I honestly expect this one to be like one to two, Bill. It didn't get binance or. Ok. But you know, I think mode might be a sign that like the l two sort of premium might just be like severely compressing now.
00:25:27.504 - 00:25:49.996, Speaker D: Yeah. So I mean, back to my original tweet. The problem here is there's a huge supply of L2s, but not enough supply of actual apps. Like if you think about what, how many apps you guys are using today, like, or in the last month, maybe not more than ten. Like fantasy pump Jupiter, maybe a Dex uniswap, an aave.
00:25:50.100 - 00:25:50.984, Speaker B: That's it.
00:25:51.524 - 00:25:52.504, Speaker D: Like five.
00:25:53.244 - 00:25:56.304, Speaker A: I think you restake with Eigen layer and just dump the airdrop.
00:25:56.684 - 00:26:13.994, Speaker B: Vicki, I want to ask you this with like, so if we're seeing like most l two s are fading out, if that's true, we'll see. Does that mean more valuable? Concentrate in the optimism token and ecosystem in arbitram. Like do you short these other l two s, long op amp arb or it's just all of them go down together?
00:26:15.574 - 00:26:37.550, Speaker E: I think you could. Yeah, I think like Op and Arb just bleed the least simply just because they're the biggest. So like you'd have to like, you know, long more op just because these smaller ones just have higher beta. But I mean, arb and op are also like heavily emitting every month. So it's hard to say. They might just trade in line yeah.
00:26:37.702 - 00:27:12.112, Speaker A: There'S like a round two of arbitrum long term incentives pilot program where I think they're allocating like 45, $50 million worth of ARB. And I went, I literally went through all the lists, like, all the projects receiving ARB and, like, half of them, like, you know, like, they're never going to find a market fit. You know, it's like one of those projects, they're all like, GMX forks and, like, things building on top of GMX. And, I mean, from a farming perspective, it's great because I guess they'll boost yields by 20% or something, but I'm going to dump it. You know, there's, like, no reason for me to invest.
00:27:12.288 - 00:27:55.860, Speaker C: So this is exactly what I was mentioning before with the VC money, because there is this, like, waterfall where, you know, Arb and op, let's say, are the ones that are considered, like, VC investable products because, you know, they can't just buy etH, so they have to invest. And these are the big L2s. So you get a 16 z and just dumping hundreds of millions because that's where they can deploy all the money that they've raised. And then those chains have to show activity and they have to give out incentives to GMX and all the way down, like you said, all these apps. And then that's where Taiki's farmer army comes in because they're just like, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go. We'll give you users. So it kind of, like, you know, it kind of makes that circle.
00:27:55.860 - 00:28:36.690, Speaker C: And we're at the stage where we need that next level of either, like, real usage to come or something to happen, because it's probably not going to keep getting farmed down unless the ETF kind of restarts the whole thing and then they start funding. But at some point, something has to happen. And I independently had the same conclusion as, as chao. I feel like apps and specifically, like, I'm very bullish on brands. Like, who can build a brand in crypto. Like, uniswap is a great brand, right? Like, that's. That's a good brand.
00:28:36.690 - 00:28:47.134, Speaker C: Like, puff, we're trying to build a brand here. Like, I feel like brands are much more powerful than, like, chains, even because you can move across different chains.
00:28:48.034 - 00:28:51.294, Speaker B: Jordy, is this what you're saying? I don't think so.
00:28:52.114 - 00:29:15.576, Speaker C: It is what I mean, listen, I said that last time. I said it's all about being early. So this is, this is similar to that. But if you look at the real world, right, like, you know, you have the fashion brands like Dolce Gabbana, like, who's the richest man in the world? It's the guy who's like, you know, managing all these, like, what's that french guy? You know, he's got all the big brands, right? So it seems to be where things might go.
00:29:15.720 - 00:29:54.854, Speaker D: I mean, if you really think about it, the L2s or any token, any of the infrared tokens, there are meme coins. I'm not saying this to dunk on them or anything, but the fact of the matter is, the vast majority of them do not accrue any value. There's no cash flow or whatever. The leader two s don't make much money at all. And the fact that they're commanding tens of billions of dollars of valuation is unjustified just from fundamentals point of view. And therefore, where does the value come from is the memability. And another way to say that the memability is the brand.
00:29:57.474 - 00:30:12.374, Speaker B: But just to push back on it, there is an expectation of future value. It would be the same as a stock that is choosing not to be profitable. There is still a distinction, but I totally hear your point. It's something we've talked about a couple episodes ago as well.
00:30:13.994 - 00:31:09.812, Speaker D: The other great thing about building a good brand is once you have a good brand, you can launch any other products. And this, by the way, we're really bullish. At least I'm personally very bullish on supporting apps. The infra where we are today is because if you build an app that a lot of people use, and building a great brand as a result of that, you can actually launch a chain eventually. And launching on Chican today is actually a lot easier than it was a few years ago. After all these years of R and D, with the optimism super chain and the arbitrum orbit, and then a bunch of roll ups as a service like conduit and Caldera, it's not very easy to launch a new chain. So the idea of starting off as an app, get to product market fit, and then transition into a L2, that makes a lot of sense to me compared to the other way around.
00:31:09.948 - 00:31:14.544, Speaker C: I could not agree more, and I think the market will eventually catch up to us.
00:31:15.844 - 00:31:35.674, Speaker B: One little thing I'll say, though, it's very hard to build a product that has product market fit. We were just talking about there's five apps you used in the last week. That's being generous if you really think about it. There's almost only two apps in crypto that have product market fit on chain, like Uniswap and Aave. Obviously there's other stuff like GMX and like, some, like, longer tail stuff.
00:31:35.754 - 00:31:38.134, Speaker D: But such a theorem, Maxi.
00:31:39.194 - 00:31:52.454, Speaker B: What I mean, there is Solana, there is no new app. Right? Like, yeah, there's like another swap product. There's another lending product. But I'm saying there's no, like, zero to one s that brought new categories anywhere. That's just a fact.
00:31:52.794 - 00:31:56.974, Speaker D: I think. I think fantasy is a zero to one pump is a zero to one.
00:31:59.174 - 00:32:01.958, Speaker C: Social fi is kind of definitely friendtech.
00:32:02.006 - 00:32:04.206, Speaker D: Friendtech is zero to one. Yeah.
00:32:04.230 - 00:32:07.726, Speaker A: And that's us thinking about this. Like, friendtech.
00:32:07.790 - 00:32:07.990, Speaker C: Right?
00:32:08.022 - 00:32:31.184, Speaker A: Like, I mean, you know, I think the hype has died down and now fantasy has all the attention because there's points and sars and blast gold and blast points. And if they wanted to, they can vampire attack Frentech. You know, they can introduce chat rooms if you own a card, you know, and it's like a friend tech with, like a trading card game on top. I mean, I think that's more interesting than gated chat rooms.
00:32:31.484 - 00:32:53.624, Speaker B: They've had success, but it is a little premature to say, like, lasting product market fit, right? Like, we've seen how the hype cycle goes. I'm very bullish on all of the things you said, but we don't know if Frontech will be here in a year. We don't know if fantasy top will. I hope they will be. But, like, we still don't know if there's lasting demand for that product because, like, we've fallen to these traps before in crypto, where we thought an app had lasting pmf and it just didn't.
00:32:55.444 - 00:33:01.064, Speaker C: I think it's good to get experiments going, though, right? Like, we should try all this stuff and see.
00:33:01.484 - 00:33:02.436, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:33:02.580 - 00:33:23.408, Speaker C: And this is my, like, two minute chill. I haven't chilled in a while. Let's. Can you get, can you get the puff penthouse up? Justin. Talking about experiments. So we've been doing some interesting experiment on chapter three. So chapter three, I think most of the chat probably is partaking because we do have about 10,000 wallets that are partaking.
00:33:23.408 - 00:34:24.070, Speaker C: So I'm sure a lot of it is our listeners. But chapter three with the blue potion staking, we just decided let's just try something. We gave everybody these blue magic tokens, which are these free casino chips we just gave people to play with. Then we just started doing these gambling games where the prize is almost a million dollars each time. So it's like, serious amount of puff being given out to winners if you click on the Goldilocks bag at the top, Justin, we can talk about the first game that we had because that ended last week. And this was like a game theory game that I came up with without a stable Nash equilibrium, which makes it more interesting where basically the three characters each had a bag and you had to choose which one was going to end up being the middle bag. And you can see in the end that the wolf bag, which is Shaka shaka the wolf, had a little bit of a knockoff of Sokka, but he had a potency.
00:34:24.070 - 00:34:36.686, Speaker C: 6.3 billion, basically, like 6.3 billion tokens got put into that bag and ended up being the middle bag. So everybody shared a big prize there and people had to kind of figure out which one to put in.
00:34:36.870 - 00:34:39.954, Speaker B: I went all in Puff and just got destroyed.
00:34:40.694 - 00:34:43.918, Speaker C: Yeah, Puff. Puff was not close, unfortunately.
00:34:44.086 - 00:34:45.314, Speaker B: A little dragon.
00:34:46.174 - 00:34:47.994, Speaker C: What did you think about the game, Justin?
00:34:49.094 - 00:35:11.566, Speaker B: Look, I mean, it's, it's fun to actually be able to do things right. Like, so this was, you know, these tokens. You got them for staking. You weren't risking your underlying puff bag and you could just have fun with it and not put too much pressure on it. Like, it's just, I mean, the market's been a little bearish in the past couple months, so it's just nice to have something to do. Like, I've been less active in other stuff, like memetrading fantasy top pump fun. Like, I haven't really played around with that.
00:35:11.566 - 00:35:22.714, Speaker B: So just for me, getting to do something on chain is nice. And I think this the new whack a gecko game, which I'm sure you'll talk about, I'm probably going to lose on that too. But also an interesting one.
00:35:23.574 - 00:35:25.230, Speaker C: What bucket did you choose?
00:35:25.422 - 00:35:37.834, Speaker B: So I picked the 500 to 534 bucket. And I think I picked, like, I forget the exact one, but I think I picked like a rank of 516 is what I'm predicting for the coingecko rank, which seems a little far off now.
00:35:38.594 - 00:36:20.338, Speaker C: Yeah. So this game, basically you have to try to pick which bucket at the end, which is going to be like, the end is a random time on Sunday. What's going to be the coin gecko rank of puff? And there's like a meta because you can try to affect the, you know, if you bet a certain bucket and it's close, you can try to buy it at the end and try to make it happen. So I'm going to expect that you do have a chance, even if it's off now, because when the time comes, there will be people trying to move it into their bag and maybe some people selling into them. So we'll see what happens. It's an experiment. The thing I've been trying to accomplish with the rules of these games is make something that nobody can just solve.
00:36:20.338 - 00:36:40.770, Speaker C: There's no GTO strategy, and you can have a plus Ev outcome if you think about your strategy a little bit. Some people can make better decisions than others. Yeah. You know, I think experimentation is something good, and people seem to be enjoying the ride.
00:36:40.962 - 00:36:51.014, Speaker B: Jordy, earlier in the show, we were talking about how, like, meme coins now have an army. There's, like, a whole team of marketers, et cetera, et cetera. Is that the approach you guys are taking for puff, or what are you guys doing there?
00:36:51.834 - 00:37:27.068, Speaker C: So with puff, two things. Like, one, I don't know if you've noticed the videos, but we've been kind of, like, pretty heavy on trying to get really high quality, like, either, like, AI dubbed famous, famous scenes kind of videos. We also have, like, 3d animation that's being done with. With, like, the characters and, like, a proper story. So trying to create, like, an emotional connection with. With the community around, like, the shared, like, memes and shared, like, vibes. So go viral with videos.
00:37:27.068 - 00:37:44.944, Speaker C: And then the other thing is just that the discord chat is, like, so active. There's a great community there. And so, like, less kind of, like, outright, you know, shilling in telegram groups and more, let's just say, like, wholesome kind of shilling.
00:37:45.964 - 00:38:14.858, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I just saw that Eigen layer claims live today. I think the minimum was, like, 110 tokens, which is like $1,000. So Sybils always win, right? Sybils win again. What do you guys think about the points meta? I know chow has some hot takes with points and stuff. Do you think it's donezo? Are people getting rugged, or where do you think we go from here in terms of farming and points?
00:38:14.946 - 00:39:02.702, Speaker D: Chao, the points meta is definitely here to stay. And the biggest reason for that is not what people actually expect. It's actually legal and regulatory. So if the regulatory environment was very friendly, then there's actually almost no reason why founders would do points. But right now, what's happening is the moment you start designing as a founder, the moment you start designing your token program, you start to realize within a few weeks that this is a huge black hole. Like, the whole regulatory and legal environment is a huge black hole. And so almost every week, you talk to your legal counsel.
00:39:02.702 - 00:39:22.834, Speaker D: They give you a new piece of advice and every month or so there is a new change in a broader regulatory environment. There's a new law or some like, I don't know, like who knows what's going to happen in November depending on who gets elected, right? So everyone is trying to delay the token, the actual token, as much as possible.
00:39:23.734 - 00:40:02.698, Speaker B: I, I think what you're saying is a factor, but I don't think it paints the whole story. I have an active points program live now and like I can tell you, we use it because we live in a interesting work, in an interesting space where there's this meta that you have to reward your users and you have to sort of like kick off that flywheel of usage just to get anyone interested. And I think using points gives you some optionality to test product market fit without committing to your token. Because once you launch your token, there's no going back. Right? Like you, it makes it nearly impossible to raise or much harder. You're very much committed to the product. Of course it's not a piece of equity, but like you do feel a responsibility to token holders and there is that commitment there.
00:40:02.698 - 00:40:46.094, Speaker B: So for me I think it provides that benefit and it also obfuscates the valuation of the points. Right? So like if you, if you launch a new app today and you start emitting your real token, your FDV or, excuse me, your tokens, FTV is presumably going to be pretty low and you have to give out a crap ton of it just to get usage. Whereas if you give points then you can adjust sort of the amount that you airdrop based on what you think the valuation will be based on the usage today. So I think it's not just regulatory, I also think it gives all of this optionality to the founders and takes it back away from community and users for better or worse. I'm not saying that's right or wrong, but I think it's just much more advantageous. And I think like we're going to see more and more points regardless of the regulatory climate.
00:40:47.074 - 00:40:50.054, Speaker E: I think Chow adjusted have been disagreeing on every point.
00:40:53.194 - 00:40:57.294, Speaker D: I absolutely agree. But you caught me off in the middle.
00:41:00.834 - 00:41:02.734, Speaker B: My apologies. I'll let you finish.
00:41:04.434 - 00:41:08.334, Speaker D: What you said is exactly what I was going to say. Cool. To your point?
00:41:08.994 - 00:41:15.466, Speaker B: Yeah, it just provides so many benefits. Like I don't see points going away. Like I think, I think it's literally better for.
00:41:15.650 - 00:41:51.984, Speaker C: Let me rephrase, you know, when, when we say like the points meta is, is dead, it's more like, you know, the first, people farming Etherfi and Athena and all this stuff, just, like, minted. Like, all the white teas printed all this stuff. And then you had people farming some of the recent stuff, and they're like, oh, I got, like, $42. And so it's more. It's probably what we talked about at the beginning. Like, the tokens themselves are launching lower, and that means that the points end up being worth less, and you're the one getting farmed. Like, Taiki's famous saying, like, the farmers start to get farmed, and that's maybe, like the, you know, there's a bit of exhaustion.
00:41:51.984 - 00:42:19.894, Speaker C: But let's talk about, like, what layer zero did. I don't know where you guys take is. I thought, you know, I mean, Brian is a very smart poker player, so I'm sure he's thought about the game theory, but he said that he wants sibyls to confess and get 15%. This is a new. This is a new kind of stroke in the battle between. Between human and Sybil. What was your take on this chao?
00:42:20.894 - 00:42:23.394, Speaker D: I love it. I love it.
00:42:23.934 - 00:42:33.474, Speaker C: Do you think that, like, Sybils will just make six times as many wallets and then just say, okay, well, I'm still gonna get 15%. That's not bad. Like, what. What ends up happening?
00:42:34.854 - 00:42:41.214, Speaker D: Um, I don't know. So I'm not. A.
00:42:41.254 - 00:42:46.034, Speaker C: 15% is still pretty good, right? Like, it's not. It's not zero. Like five?
00:42:46.614 - 00:42:47.294, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly.
00:42:47.334 - 00:42:50.704, Speaker D: I would just spin up six. Six times as many wallets.
00:42:53.204 - 00:42:59.704, Speaker B: There's a hilarious tweet from Brian. I guess we've got a protesters outside of his office, which is amazing.
00:43:01.484 - 00:43:03.500, Speaker A: Apparently. This is real. Yeah, it's crazy.
00:43:03.692 - 00:43:31.974, Speaker C: Yeah. That tweet there is like, you know, primo, basically. At some point, he said that he was going to split up his pudgies because they were getting limited on the airdrops. Like, when you had more than one pudgy, the projects would only give you as if you had one pudgy. So if you, like, Sybil, them into multiple wallets, you get more airdrops. So he said publicly that he was going to break them up out of the huddle, and then he's like, witch hunting. It's so funny.
00:43:32.394 - 00:44:03.844, Speaker A: Yeah. And I also think there's like a. I think he also introduced, like, a snitching program where if you snitch, like, a cluster of wallets, and you're right, then you get, like, 10% of the. The airdrop, I think. And it's funny because there's a lot of outrage on the timeline, right, with layer zero, and everyone that's mad is like basically self reporting that they're like a sybil. So it's really easy to target those people, right. So I feel like if you're a civil, the GTO decision is like, to not say anything and just pray to God that you're not part of a cluster.
00:44:03.844 - 00:44:17.500, Speaker A: I think it's in best interest for layer zero to try to give wider distribution. And this is more so like a, more of like a, I don't know, like a tactic, you know, just to say that they're addressing sybils.
00:44:17.612 - 00:44:52.344, Speaker B: So, yeah, yeah, I invested in layer zero, so I've sort of been following the story, like, since they launched, and I feel like no team has been attacked more from a symbol perspective than them, just because you don't have to basically lock up value or take risk when using layer zero to send messages, right? Like with eigen layer, it's much easier to construct a linear airdrop. But like, how can you possibly do that with layer zero when a lot of this bridge activity, like a massive percentage, is just wash bridging, right, and wash messaging? So I think, like, for them, there's literally no other option because they've just been attacked for, I think it's been two years of just being attacked by sybils.
00:44:53.204 - 00:45:13.432, Speaker D: I have a question for you guys. Why are projects even doing airdrops in the first place? Because that's the norm. Now. It used to be the case that, like, airdrops wasn't a thing until maybe uniswap defy summer. So why are people, why are products doing airdrops?
00:45:13.608 - 00:45:52.756, Speaker B: So my cynical take is that, and this, I think is probably what you're thinking too, from a regulatory perspective, it just makes sense, right? Like the token has to be decentralized to the community where what are you going to sell into if there's no, like community trading and like healthy markets on chain, et cetera? And we can't do projects, can't do token sales, right? I mean, you can if you exclude us persons. But for the vast majority of projects, this is like your way to basically give up five to 10% of your supply at the absolute most, get this thing pseudo decentralized, or at least give yourself a legal case to do it and fight it over many years and, you know, figure it out from there. I think I used to think airdrops.
00:45:52.940 - 00:46:19.464, Speaker C: I feel like that's definitely not the main reason then. I mean, the regulatory stuff, at the end of the day, you know, you can have a float. You can figure out. It seems to be really important for getting, like, the vibes, right? Like, you want, like, the. The vibes to be good when things launch and the early users to make some money, and then they'll. They're gonna be like your. I see Justin disagrees, but I strongly, strongly, like, believe that this is the main reason.
00:46:19.804 - 00:46:33.398, Speaker B: But the vibes are off. No matter how you distribute the tokens. The vibes were off with Eigen, Laira, they did their airdrop. Hundreds of millions of dollars of tokens given away for free. For free. And people are upset. Look at all of the past airdrops, even ether.
00:46:33.398 - 00:46:34.234, Speaker B: Five people.
00:46:35.174 - 00:46:37.874, Speaker C: I don't think either five. They were not that upset.
00:46:38.854 - 00:46:51.394, Speaker B: Maybe it's just a vocal minority, but look at projects like Ondo, right? No, airdrop, like, very successful, vibrant community. They did a coinless sale, but so maybe that was their way to distribute it.
00:46:52.114 - 00:47:02.494, Speaker D: But let's reason from first principles. Like, if you didn't do an airdrop, how would you create a liquid market from day one? How do you create a community of bag holders from day one?
00:47:04.634 - 00:47:26.434, Speaker C: I mean, what Justin said, like, you can potentially do some coinless type of thing where it has to be Kyc so people don't sibilate and you give them tokens at a cheap price. And something like this. I mean, how did chain link do it? Well, I don't remember. Like, what, what was the initial chainlink army? How did they come about?
00:47:27.134 - 00:47:27.470, Speaker B: So.
00:47:27.502 - 00:48:14.894, Speaker D: So basically you're saying the alternative is to do an ICO, a crowd sale, regulated, compliant, either compliant or semi compliant, but geofencing in the US. And that comes with a cost of, you know, if you do compliant us based ICO, then it's probably very expensive. And then you're like, you have to KYC the users and therefore your initial set of back orders will be limited. So that's the downside of that. And then if you do semi compliant, non compliant, you might get into trouble with the us government. So again, like, in both cases, that goes back to the legal and regulatory constraint, like airdrop is actually the legal and the more legally safer route between the two.
00:48:15.914 - 00:48:42.946, Speaker C: He had an interesting in between where he mentioned what he thinks is a good airdrop strategy is airdrop. People like a warrant, so they don't actually get free tokens, but they get the right to buy. It's kind of the combination of the two where you're giving it to everybody. Like, you're giving it widely. So it's not Kyc. But you're just getting the option to convert dollars into the token at some, like, you know, pretty cheap price, at least. Like, people have to put some skin in the game.
00:48:42.946 - 00:48:44.414, Speaker C: That was quite interesting.
00:48:46.434 - 00:49:05.266, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a comment here, chow. How do you recreate bag holders? Chow, asking the real questions. And there's people speculating that Dickey's a dicky, has some diarrhea. That's how he's gone. Where is this guy? Dude, what the fuck?
00:49:05.370 - 00:49:53.478, Speaker B: The chat never fails to disappoint. Also, one other thing about, like, the token sale, like, doing an ICO, it, like, drastically limits your participants, right? Like, you can't get a wide audience of bag holders, and you have to, like, very much limit sizing. And so, like, when we did the ondo coinless sale, right, there was a cap of maybe a tokens you could buy. And you have to basically get so many thousands and thousands of users interested and excited that you kind of hit your scale of, like, what you can achieve with regulated. A regulated token sale pretty quickly. And so I used to think airdrops were dead, but now I just think that all the incentives are there and the cost is pretty low that the teams are going to continue running them for these benefits we discussed. It's also, like, it's also a factor of not having product market fit.
00:49:53.478 - 00:50:01.674, Speaker B: Right? Like, people could just build projects that make money and not have a token, right. But that's not what people decide to do.
00:50:03.514 - 00:50:04.890, Speaker A: Token is how to make money.
00:50:04.922 - 00:50:24.626, Speaker C: Justin, I think ultimately, like, getting. Getting the. Getting the vibes right is by far the most important. And trying to give people some free stuff is a good way to do it. And you mentioned Londo. It's just another kind of thing about getting the vibes right. And yeah, I think someone is questioning whether thick, he's maybe trading in the.
00:50:24.626 - 00:50:26.218, Speaker C: In the bathroom now, so maybe.
00:50:26.306 - 00:50:27.334, Speaker A: Oh, he's back.
00:50:27.684 - 00:50:29.104, Speaker B: Did you wash your hands?
00:50:29.764 - 00:50:33.144, Speaker A: Did you wash your hands? Dude, is the toilet okay?
00:50:33.524 - 00:50:34.464, Speaker E: What's up?
00:50:34.964 - 00:50:36.344, Speaker B: Where. Where'd you go?
00:50:36.684 - 00:50:53.860, Speaker C: The chat is launching diarrhea. Like, diarrhea meme coin. There's a hashtag diarrhea coming. It looks like we're taking turns now. Okay. All right, guys, I also see some.
00:50:53.932 - 00:50:58.874, Speaker B: Some people are saying Justin's finally right for once and then still wrong.
00:51:02.414 - 00:51:03.514, Speaker A: Thick poop.
00:51:04.294 - 00:51:25.296, Speaker C: Let's make it spicy before Chow comes back. So we had a little bit of PvP this week. Chow, have you been following the PvP between the VC's? And did you do diligence and did you and all this stuff, which PvP.
00:51:25.440 - 00:51:27.604, Speaker D: The BC versus retail or the.
00:51:29.344 - 00:51:39.616, Speaker C: Steve tried to post about some of the eclipse investors, and then Dudas was like, oh, you're coming after the fact. It's talking about.
00:51:39.720 - 00:51:46.884, Speaker D: That was the dragonfly versus six man ventures.
00:51:47.464 - 00:52:13.694, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, as a VC, do you think it's, how deep should VC's go on? Character references versus, like, tech dives versus. I mean, we saw with, like, FTX that all these, like, famous VC's didn't even do, you know, basic financial due diligence, let alone anything else. So what is, like, really to be expected from a VC?
00:52:14.034 - 00:52:51.272, Speaker D: I think a lot of that has to depend on the stage. So the eclipse investors are relatively later stage. Like, I operate on a pre seed, like, first check in, and it's impossible for me to do like 10 hours of due diligence on every founder because by definition, when you precede, you invest in a lot and very early, you have not much information to dig into. Right. So, like, for us, we spend like an hour with the founder. That's it. We make a decision, and we make a decision very quickly.
00:52:51.272 - 00:53:25.104, Speaker D: But for, you know, those products raising at like $100 million valuation, those later stage ones, I would expect VC's to do a lot of due diligence because those VC's, they don't make a lot of investments. They make fewer than we do because they do later stage, and therefore, they can afford to do a lot of due diligence on each one. And they also have much more information to work with because there's, you know, hopefully the product that the team has been working on the product for a while. So there's more information, more history to look at.
00:53:26.284 - 00:53:35.708, Speaker B: So you think it is their responsibility is not a service to the community, but they have, like, a duty to the community to do extensive due diligence.
00:53:35.836 - 00:53:42.904, Speaker D: Duty to their, to their LP's. It's the fiduciary duty to their LP's, not the community.
00:53:44.604 - 00:53:56.348, Speaker B: Yeah. It's an interesting case here because there's nothing wrong with the product, right? Like, the product could be like the best thing since sliced bread, right? Like, you know, you can buy bitcoin and recognize, like, Satoshi could have been a murderer for all we know.
00:53:56.476 - 00:53:59.092, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:53:59.108 - 00:54:02.102, Speaker C: I mean, the. Go ahead. Thank you.
00:54:02.268 - 00:54:23.770, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think this is like what Geordi said with, like, the past couple months have been like, more PvP where if the market's pumping, then, like, no one really gives a shit. But as soon as everyone starts losing money, it's like, oh, my God. Like, I'm really angry. You know, people want to be angry and they just, like, find ways to be angry. I know. Like, even, like, David Hoffman got called out. There's, like, Neil Samani.
00:54:23.882 - 00:54:24.322, Speaker C: I don't.
00:54:24.378 - 00:54:43.114, Speaker A: I don't really know what happened, but I don't know. I mean, it just seems like people are trying to, like, cancel each other and, like, this little witch hunt of, like, this guy's bad. And I don't know, I feel like it's only because the markets are going down, because people, people are down. It's like, fuck, like, I hate this guy.
00:54:44.214 - 00:54:49.914, Speaker B: Well, the steady lads are notoriously very clean actors, and there's really no benefit to looking into any of us.
00:54:54.404 - 00:55:28.954, Speaker E: It's, like, annoying to see just like, because obviously, you know, there's, like, wealth PvP games and then there's, like, status PvP games that you see on Twitter and it comes out, especially when, you know, there's not much wealth to be made. Like, it's time just to PvP for status. And, you know, my strategy typically when I see people just get, like, witch hunted is just to put my Twitter on private and just, like, wait for everything to blow over and then, like, when things are pumping again, just go tweet. But, like, I think while things are just kind of very PvP socially, it's just better just to, like, lay low and stay out of the. Stay out of the spotlight.
00:55:30.854 - 00:55:53.882, Speaker C: Well, I know some of our pastas are. I've seen. I've seen a few of them, and some of them are going to be related to some of the drama going on. So maybe let's move there and we can dive into some of the tweets with pasta of the week. Let's kick off with Justin. As usual, you get to go first.
00:55:54.058 - 00:56:28.174, Speaker B: Oh, geez. I was kind of going to see how pasta went to see which pasta to go with. I guess I'll stick on the topic here, though. Echo. Kobe's project said, if I say GM and you say it back, that's an echo. And we have Kat, our guest from last week, saying, if you say GM and she says no, that's an eclipse, maybe making light of a bad situation. We don't have all the facts here, but I thought this was hilarious and poking fun at the situation a little bit and trying to take things a little more lightheartedly.
00:56:30.954 - 00:56:38.194, Speaker C: I'm proud of you, Justin. You. You went for the win this week. Got, like, everybody in the chat, this is. Justin really went for it.
00:56:38.234 - 00:56:38.530, Speaker D: He.
00:56:38.602 - 00:56:44.212, Speaker C: He went controversial to try to get the win. So give Justin some votes at the end.
00:56:44.228 - 00:56:49.864, Speaker B: Yeah, we're running polls now, right? So we'll have a poll at the end and you can vote for your, your favorite lad.
00:56:51.404 - 00:57:19.932, Speaker C: You already have one guy saying, Justin one in the chat. So we have another guy saying, when, when does Jordy get a Cellini Lambo? So let me go second because it is actually relevant to Lambos. You know, the story came out that DWF was investigated by Binance and found to have manipulated multiple coins. Shocker for all of us. I know, after we've been pointing our first guest charts. No, that was cred. But maybe it was.
00:57:19.932 - 00:57:56.256, Speaker C: Our second guest was Andre, and we were very polite and didn't, didn't kind of like, you know, put it. Put his feet to the fire. But it was obvious that things were happening that binance was allowing. And I was saying it at the time, I mean, you know, we have a good relationship with the binance. We're a very big trader on Binance. So, you know, dear overlord Binance, you know, I'm not saying anything bad, but it was quite obvious at the time that shady shit was happening. Whose fault is it? And, like, who should do something about it? I've talked about this many times.
00:57:56.256 - 00:58:26.120, Speaker C: Ultimately, in traditional markets, there's the CFTC sec. Like, people are going to crack down. Like, it's called market ignition. It's called, you know, all this manipulation stuff. In crypto markets, there is no agency that has coverage of these offshore, weird commodity like things. And the GTO strategy is to do some of these ignition and, like, whatever you want to call them. So someone's gonna do it.
00:58:26.120 - 00:58:57.954, Speaker C: Like, if no one's, there's not gonna be any, any police and there's money to be made. Like, someone will do these things. And eventually we saw that that was the case. I've had the opinion that since the agencies can't step in, it really has to come down to the exchanges. And I think the exchanges are starting to take it more seriously, which is great to see. And I think they will, going forward, step in and shut down accounts. And we saw that binance has done that.
00:58:57.954 - 00:59:17.734, Speaker C: They did shut down, at least Tron. They said that Tron was, was doing a lot of watch trading with their token or something. I don't know exactly what the internal investigation found, but we'll come up to my pasta, which is, you know, what the investigators were. This is not my pasta.
00:59:18.834 - 00:59:23.134, Speaker B: I was trying to tee you up. I thought you were gonna say, what are you gonna do arrest me.
00:59:23.824 - 00:59:26.024, Speaker C: Is this. Vicki, is this your pasta?
00:59:26.104 - 00:59:30.120, Speaker B: This is not Vicky's pasta. No, it is my pasta.
00:59:30.272 - 00:59:31.404, Speaker C: It is his past.
00:59:31.824 - 00:59:35.824, Speaker B: No, you've got the Brian Johnson pasta. We lined this up at the pre show.
00:59:35.944 - 00:59:37.524, Speaker E: Well, then whose pasta is this?
00:59:38.384 - 00:59:38.936, Speaker B: Jordan's?
00:59:38.960 - 00:59:39.764, Speaker C: Costa.
00:59:40.184 - 00:59:43.504, Speaker B: No, I thought Jordy just had a pasta.
00:59:43.664 - 00:59:46.524, Speaker E: No, that was Jordy's pasta.
00:59:48.304 - 00:59:53.426, Speaker B: I thought this was a two part pasta, to be fair. Okay, okay, give me a break.
00:59:53.490 - 00:59:58.378, Speaker C: Pasta is the video. There's the video pasta. Can you bring up the video pasta, please?
00:59:58.426 - 01:00:01.050, Speaker B: Justin, video pasta.
01:00:01.242 - 01:00:07.474, Speaker C: The video. The guy. Okay, this is the one. I just gave it to you.
01:00:07.514 - 01:00:08.594, Speaker A: Wait, there's way too much.
01:00:08.674 - 01:00:09.378, Speaker D: This is.
01:00:09.426 - 01:00:13.082, Speaker C: No, no, ignore a chat. My pasta hasn't come yet.
01:00:13.138 - 01:00:14.394, Speaker B: I got it, I got it, I got it.
01:00:14.434 - 01:00:19.900, Speaker C: Here we go. Can you put the volume up, please? And then scroll up so people can see that? Scroll up. No, no, no.
01:00:19.932 - 01:00:21.024, Speaker A: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
01:00:21.924 - 01:00:32.304, Speaker C: Scroll up, scroll up. Okay, so this is. So binance fired the head of surveillance after he flat. After he flagged the manipulation. They fired it. So just. Okay, put it on now.
01:00:32.304 - 01:00:39.492, Speaker C: Did you witness anything strange in the area? What? Witness?
01:00:39.588 - 01:00:40.980, Speaker D: Yes. Is this camera over?
01:00:41.052 - 01:00:41.904, Speaker A: Yeah, we're live.
01:00:42.044 - 01:00:42.632, Speaker C: Oh.
01:00:42.768 - 01:00:46.008, Speaker D: Oh, no. I ain't seen nothing. I ain't seen nothing.
01:00:46.136 - 01:00:48.520, Speaker C: Matter of fact, I'm blind in my.
01:00:48.552 - 01:00:53.544, Speaker D: Left eye and 43% blind in my right eye. I don't see much of nothing.
01:00:53.664 - 01:00:56.484, Speaker C: Matter of fact, I can't even see you, sir. Did you.
01:00:57.424 - 01:00:58.724, Speaker B: That was pretty good.
01:01:02.544 - 01:01:03.724, Speaker A: That's really good.
01:01:04.544 - 01:01:07.216, Speaker B: And you used three pastas up in one, and I don't know.
01:01:07.240 - 01:01:08.484, Speaker C: No, it's last one.
01:01:10.564 - 01:01:11.028, Speaker A: He was.
01:01:11.076 - 01:01:11.744, Speaker C: Okay.
01:01:12.484 - 01:01:15.108, Speaker A: Storytelling. Okay.
01:01:15.156 - 01:01:15.824, Speaker D: You got.
01:01:16.884 - 01:01:26.468, Speaker A: Literally, my pasta was the layer zero one, but Justin just fucking snatched it off me, so I have to go with this. All right, share my screen. Share my screen.
01:01:26.596 - 01:01:27.604, Speaker C: All right, all right.
01:01:27.724 - 01:01:44.870, Speaker A: So Machi, big brother, you know, he's been buying, like, millions of dollars worth of friend, and apparently, you know, he's making additional friends. Uh, apparently, he's dating this 19 year old ukrainian model. So, you know, he's. Machi's always winning. He's always family.
01:01:44.942 - 01:01:47.434, Speaker B: Strong emotional connection, though. Very strong.
01:01:48.694 - 01:01:52.870, Speaker D: Wait, is this the guy called, like, uh, cream or something back in the day?
01:01:52.942 - 01:01:53.934, Speaker C: Yes. Correct.
01:01:53.974 - 01:01:56.086, Speaker A: Yeah, it's. It's all the same as.
01:01:56.110 - 01:01:56.674, Speaker D: Well.
01:01:58.894 - 01:02:15.222, Speaker A: There'S a bunch. Yeah, he got Zach xpt. There's a bunch. There's a lot going on there. And now he's. He always, like, farms things and, like, loses money because Pac man farmed him. But I'm sure he's, like, a very wealthy man with lots of ukrainian models by his side.
01:02:15.318 - 01:02:30.774, Speaker C: So, I mean, happy to match you. Is the 50 year old being able to date, like, a hot 19 year old model? Is that. Is that. Is that fud, or is that, like, you know, in crypto Twitter? He's like, the hero. Or, like, where does it end up?
01:02:31.634 - 01:02:48.114, Speaker A: Everyone aspires to be Machi. Like, the anon accounts on CT. You know, they secretly all want to be like him. You know, just swing. Millions, get trolled, lose money, but, you know, he's always at the top at the end. Good old Machi entertainer.
01:02:48.154 - 01:02:52.414, Speaker B: Sorry I blew your real pasta. I had no idea I had so many taps open. Taiki.
01:02:53.314 - 01:03:01.334, Speaker C: Vicky, are you gonna get, like, a side pasta now, or are you sticking to the Gratchev one? Because I feel like it ruined the build up to it.
01:03:02.714 - 01:03:05.614, Speaker B: Athletic greens. That was the canonical pasta.
01:03:06.434 - 01:03:07.058, Speaker D: I'll do that.
01:03:07.106 - 01:03:13.850, Speaker E: A greens one. That was like, it's on topic. I'm crypto related. I just like, what am I, like, tweets?
01:03:13.882 - 01:03:15.334, Speaker D: That was the only one this week.
01:03:16.554 - 01:03:52.024, Speaker E: The story here is that, like, Brian Johnson just went on a huge fud campaign against Atlanta greens. It seems like Andrew Huberman's had a pretty, pretty rough week, just given all the back to. Back to back fuds. Yeah, this is just, like, exposing how people that were shilling ag one get, like, 20% of commissions of whatever they shield. Just, like, kind of a shocker, because it, like, you know, with that kind of incentive, it kind of incentivizes people just to show. It could just be, like, complete vaporware, and they can show it. And I think he's going to lead into shilling his own green's formula or something.
01:03:52.024 - 01:03:54.440, Speaker E: So, you know, we'll have to wait and see what he comes out with.
01:03:54.472 - 01:03:58.644, Speaker D: But already he already started shilling his own on TikTok. I see it all.
01:03:59.224 - 01:04:00.240, Speaker B: He did.
01:04:00.432 - 01:04:06.608, Speaker E: That's funny. I probably trust Brian Johnson more than Andrew Huberman, though. There seems to be, like, a passing of the torch going on.
01:04:06.696 - 01:04:10.832, Speaker D: Huberman is behind ag one as well? Like, one of those influencers behind you.
01:04:10.928 - 01:04:13.684, Speaker E: Yeah, he was, like, the big one behind it. Him and Joe Rogan, I think.
01:04:14.424 - 01:04:18.174, Speaker B: This is not dissimilar from crypto. I actually think it's kind of on topic, but.
01:04:20.234 - 01:04:39.094, Speaker C: Somebody actually, like, somebody in the comments said, like, this is, like, the eigen layer, airdrop. I'm not sure, like, which part. Who's getting the big amount? Is that the project or who's getting the big. Is it. Is it Justin sun, like, drinking all that. I don't know.
01:04:40.154 - 01:04:45.614, Speaker A: It could be. Yeah. Yeah. They take a page out of the crypto playbook.
01:04:46.334 - 01:04:58.274, Speaker C: Let's get. Let's get the guest pasta. Guest pastas usually do. Well, we had cl one last time. Can you put the volume on, Justin?
01:04:59.574 - 01:05:36.374, Speaker F: To make this very simple, all we need to know is that for women 30 years old get louder, because the probability of getting pregnant on any one attempt to conceive is 20%. Well, then if that doesn't occur the first time, then she should simply repeat that at least five and probably six times before deciding to go to an Ob GYN and conclude that there's something going on either with the egg or, of course, it could be with the sperm. Okay. Because 20 times five is 100, so we're talking about cumulative percent. So 2040, 60, 8100, and the six month there would take you to 120%.
01:05:37.494 - 01:05:39.554, Speaker B: It's just terrible statistics.
01:05:41.614 - 01:05:50.354, Speaker D: Yeah. This one is a. Is a nerdy. Kind of a nerdy pasta. It's not. It's like he just doesn't know how to do basic statistics.
01:05:52.374 - 01:05:59.662, Speaker B: Yeah. Walk us through how the probability changes after each occurrence. Because I remember having to do something like that for the GMAT. I've since lost the knowledge.
01:05:59.718 - 01:06:23.654, Speaker D: But 20%, the way you do the math, is. So the probability of getting pregnant in the first month is 20%. What you should do to calculate the probability after six months is you should look at the probability of not getting pregnant in the first month, and then you do exponents to the six.
01:06:24.474 - 01:06:26.522, Speaker C: It's like 0.8 to the 6th.
01:06:26.578 - 01:06:45.918, Speaker D: Yeah, 28 to the 6th. And so 26% is the probability of not getting pregnant even after six months. So the probability of getting pregnant at least once over the period of six months is 75%. Anyway, this is super nerdy. Like, I just couldn't stop laughing at it when I saw this. But it's a very nerdy one.
01:06:45.926 - 01:06:51.270, Speaker C: It's good. It's a combination of laughing and also teaching our audience some statistics.
01:06:51.422 - 01:07:12.600, Speaker D: But my problem with. Is even before the thing came out, like, he dated the 6th grade, like, at the same time thing. Right. Even before that time came out, I just never trusted him. Like, he doesn't know how. Like, he makes everything look so black and white, and he's like, has. Has very strong opinions on things that don't matter.
01:07:12.600 - 01:07:28.684, Speaker D: Like, to live a very long and healthy life, what you need to do is eat mostly healthy, exercise every day, and sleep well. But what human does all the time is he gives you a bunch of tips on things that don't matter. Like, you can't drink coffee in the first 45 minutes of waking up. Like, that kind of shit doesn't matter.
01:07:29.064 - 01:07:34.496, Speaker B: Like, looking at the sunrise with your eyeball, like, getting sunlight podcast on.
01:07:34.520 - 01:07:41.604, Speaker D: That kind of shit. I just. I just can't. I can't stand him. And that was before the dating six women thing came out.
01:07:42.264 - 01:07:44.564, Speaker C: Are you a Brian Johnson, Maxi Chow?
01:07:44.904 - 01:08:02.846, Speaker D: I don't. I don't. I don't like Brian. Okay? I respect Brian Johnson for. I don't like. I don't like for becoming a huge role model. Right? But Brian Johnson's approach, I also disagree with it.
01:08:02.846 - 01:08:24.506, Speaker D: Like, he. Like, he takes, like, 100 supplements. All that stuff, like, the 150 supplements that he takes is pure micro optimization. It's like it moves. It doesn't move the needle. Like, it might extend your life or your happiness or your health by maybe one or 2%. But again, the most important thing, which he never really touches on is exercise, sleep, and eating, mostly.
01:08:24.506 - 01:08:31.654, Speaker D: Mostly diet. Well, he touched on all those things, but he does, like, all these micro optimizations that I think, for most people is a huge distraction.
01:08:33.434 - 01:08:51.600, Speaker B: It looks like we have. The poll is live, and results are streaming in, so make sure to get your last minute votes. I think our producer excluded Thicke from the poll. We could only fit four people in the poll, and he had to go to the best, so we had to kick him off there. But it looks like I'm shaping up to be another winner. I think I won last week.
01:08:51.632 - 01:08:52.440, Speaker C: Oh, no.
01:08:52.632 - 01:08:58.164, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll put up here. Little inception here. But you can see the polls, right?
01:09:00.584 - 01:09:04.800, Speaker C: Oh, no. Chad, get me over to the line. I'm gonna have to.
01:09:04.992 - 01:09:08.200, Speaker A: I'm always last. Goddamn.
01:09:08.232 - 01:09:11.232, Speaker B: All right, this is creating, like, a doom loop, but it's like.
01:09:11.288 - 01:09:19.072, Speaker C: It's like inception. Um, all right, we'll. We'll give it, like, another minute just in case I can flip Justin.
01:09:19.208 - 01:09:35.684, Speaker B: Uh, I feel bad because I accidentally. You know what? To have a good quote on the show. I didn't know that. I fumbled Jordy's pasta three times. I stole thicky's pasta chow. I left, you know, but it was, like, pretty unrelated and a little nerdy.
01:09:37.623 - 01:09:44.083, Speaker C: Okay. Somebody in the chat says maybe eth will stop underperforming if Justin wins, so give it.
01:09:47.343 - 01:09:49.055, Speaker A: For the sake of our bags.
01:09:49.119 - 01:09:59.199, Speaker B: Oh, no. We're tied, jordy. It's tied up. Tied with 70 votes. 34% to me, 34% to you.
01:09:59.391 - 01:10:27.188, Speaker C: All right, well, we'll take the first tie ever. This will be the first ever tie. We need to we need to, we need to get it. We used to have the hats, brad, we used to have the little chef hats for the, for the winners, but we'll get those next time. All right. Any, any final thoughts or comments? I mean, it's, it's probably going to be a choppy, choppy summer. What do you think? Ciao.
01:10:27.188 - 01:10:33.392, Speaker C: Are we just going to have a, have one of those summers where a.
01:10:33.408 - 01:10:35.804, Speaker D: Couple more months of consolidation, then up only?
01:10:36.344 - 01:10:37.284, Speaker C: Let's go.
01:10:38.384 - 01:10:44.496, Speaker B: We can last a couple months. That's nothing. That's only eight episodes of steady lads. We'll be at steady lads number 50 by then.
01:10:44.640 - 01:10:46.404, Speaker A: It will hit our one year anniversary.
01:10:47.224 - 01:11:03.554, Speaker D: To risk a little bit. Maybe a month before the election. Like, I think a month before the election, crypto market will basically become a prediction market for who wins the election. Biden wins. If Trump wins, it's up only.
01:11:04.254 - 01:11:13.534, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, you guys saw Trump's comments this week. Holy shit. Like, the guy is just explicitly going after the. I think it's smart of him. We already have it up.
01:11:13.574 - 01:11:13.814, Speaker A: Wow.
01:11:13.854 - 01:11:15.150, Speaker C: It's pretty impressive skills.
01:11:15.182 - 01:11:21.594, Speaker B: I was thinking about it being my pasta, if I wanted to tame my thing, my pasta down a little, but then I realized this wasn't that funny.
01:11:23.194 - 01:11:40.938, Speaker C: It's not, it's not funny, but it is fascinating how much he shifted. I think it's because he's a bag holder. So that's what happens with crypto when you don't have any crypto. Like, he didn't have any last time. He's like, oh, no, it's all about the us dollar. The dollar needs to be strong because that's what I got in my bank account. I got dollars.
01:11:40.938 - 01:11:47.854, Speaker C: So we gotta. And then now he's like, ah, you know, Trump, you know, this crypto stuff is pretty cool.
01:11:48.314 - 01:11:53.574, Speaker A: Yeah. He made a few million on Polygon NFTs and now he's, now he's, now he's all for it.
01:11:54.584 - 01:11:56.816, Speaker D: Oh, the NFC was actually real. Was actually.
01:11:56.920 - 01:11:58.920, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:11:59.032 - 01:12:00.976, Speaker A: You can like get dinner with them or something if you buy.
01:12:01.000 - 01:12:14.984, Speaker B: Like, if the dinner happened, this was at that dinner. So they, if you had a certain number of nfTs, this was the event he held for the NFT holders. You only needed to hold like ten and they were only priced at a few hundred dollars. It was like actually kind of a no brainer if you wanted to go to this thing.
01:12:15.104 - 01:12:15.400, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:12:15.432 - 01:12:15.632, Speaker C: Okay.
01:12:15.648 - 01:12:32.214, Speaker A: So like, the, the bowdoin holder bought the NFTs, went there and asked him a question to pump his bags. That's pretty smart. That guy. That guy, you know, that guy's got, I want to bet on that guy, whoever that guy was. Good trade. Very good trade.
01:12:32.914 - 01:13:01.696, Speaker C: I can't say I missed the days. Like, I was training tratfi during Trump's last four years. And, you know, you had to just put him on announcements and just, every time he would tweet, you had to, like, be on top of his tweets because he, he moved markets so much like China, this and that. It was like, you had to follow it. I'm not sure I'm looking forward to that part of, of him coming back and having to keep him on, on notifications.
01:13:01.880 - 01:13:05.564, Speaker B: I mean, he's an ETH bull, so we got that going for us.
01:13:06.384 - 01:13:23.410, Speaker C: That's true. That's true. Cool. All right, well, let's wrap up. I mean, it's pretty been a great episode. Please like and subscribe. And if you enjoyed the chat with Chow, I mean, I think he's, he's definitely, like one of the most, like, first principles thinkers in the space.
01:13:23.410 - 01:13:33.114, Speaker C: So I follow him. I suggest you guys follow him. And their good game podcast is great to listen to as well. So check that out as well. Thanks, everybody, and catch you next week.
