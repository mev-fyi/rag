00:00:00.330 - 00:00:01.182, Speaker UNK: Do you have any.
00:00:01.236 - 00:00:06.014, Speaker A: Thoughts around, like, what you think a better solution for the like, long.
00:00:06.052 - 00:00:07.130, Speaker B: Term for royalties?
00:00:07.210 - 00:00:08.890, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Not necessarily.
00:00:08.970 - 00:00:13.166, Speaker B: For collections. I have a good sense for one of ones. I honestly have no idea that.
00:00:13.188 - 00:00:13.822, Speaker A: That'S fine.
00:00:13.876 - 00:00:24.634, Speaker B: But for collections, I think having the initial creators retain some percentage of the supply is a much more incentive aligned way to participate in the upside.
00:00:24.682 - 00:00:25.846, Speaker A: And I.
00:00:25.868 - 00:00:37.634, Speaker B: Would say probably most famously larva labs did that with crypto punks. The nounders do that with nouns. Paradigm is actually going that route with art gobblers as well.
00:00:37.692 - 00:00:38.202, Speaker A: Oh really?
00:00:38.256 - 00:00:38.762, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:38.896 - 00:00:39.674, Speaker A: I didn't know that.
00:00:39.712 - 00:00:40.362, Speaker UNK: That makes sense.
00:00:40.416 - 00:01:11.806, Speaker A: Yeah. I think I had proposed to yesterday the idea of potentially not necessarily having a noun style distribution, but assuming possible with the set of art. Basically like having a continual drip to the creator where you say you start with 500 and every however many days a new one is minted and goes to the creator. In kind of a similar vein of you slowly dilute everyone over time, but the creator kind of has this long term incentive to want to see things do well.
00:01:11.908 - 00:01:12.634, Speaker B: Totally.
00:01:12.762 - 00:01:15.620, Speaker A: Yeah. You open.
