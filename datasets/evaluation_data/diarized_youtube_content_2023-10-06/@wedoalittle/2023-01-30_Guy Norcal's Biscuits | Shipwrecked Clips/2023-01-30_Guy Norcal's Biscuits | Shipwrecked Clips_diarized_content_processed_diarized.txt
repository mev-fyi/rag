00:00:35.250 - 00:00:46.438, Speaker C: No, they're all biscuits. These are dropped because the recipe didn't. Well, the butter. Initial butter I got. The initial butter I got was with olive oil. It wasn't real butter.
00:00:46.534 - 00:00:47.514, Speaker A: I'm just going to pick this one up.
00:00:47.552 - 00:00:53.406, Speaker C: They're drop and then these are layered. They're makeshift because didn't have tools, had to make do.
00:00:53.508 - 00:00:57.594, Speaker B: Hey, you were looking for the biscuit cutter. Those don't look biscuit cut. Those look handcut.
00:00:57.642 - 00:00:58.298, Speaker A: Handcut.
00:00:58.394 - 00:01:00.138, Speaker B: Am I right? You killed.
00:01:00.154 - 00:01:06.578, Speaker A: It is true that you are the best biscuit maker in North America. I can't say where you live.
00:01:06.664 - 00:01:10.450, Speaker C: Yeah, of course you know it. That's why I'm here.
00:01:10.520 - 00:01:11.186, Speaker D: Right.
00:01:11.368 - 00:01:24.630, Speaker A: So, on Twitter, Deez, I don't know if you've ever noticed, but norcal constantly makes it a thing that he is the best at making biscuits. And who do you go against for? You say they're better than scones. Who do you fight?
00:01:24.700 - 00:01:27.074, Speaker C: Like Matt dug and then like Ayla.
00:01:27.122 - 00:01:37.130, Speaker A: Ayla, can you explain to us how your process and your love of biscuit making has started and is it connected to your love of NFTs?
00:01:39.950 - 00:02:06.166, Speaker C: Pandemic happens. My mom, like, I'm going to make biscuits. She made drop biscuits and my sister made some layered biscuits and I was like, I'll do some layered biscuits, I like them better. And then just kept on working on it, changing the recipe here and there, doing this, doing that, and then got to a spot where I love them and now it's part of the NFT space as well.
00:02:06.268 - 00:02:10.082, Speaker A: What did you do first? Buy an NFT or start making biscuits?
00:02:10.226 - 00:02:11.350, Speaker C: Probably biscuits.
