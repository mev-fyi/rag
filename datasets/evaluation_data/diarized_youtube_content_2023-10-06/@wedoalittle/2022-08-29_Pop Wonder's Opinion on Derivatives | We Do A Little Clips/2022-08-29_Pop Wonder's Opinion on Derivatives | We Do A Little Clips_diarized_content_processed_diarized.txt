00:00:02.010 - 00:00:27.106, Speaker A: One thing I think is I realized early about you is that you're one of the few artists I thought who was, like, doing additions in a more thoughtful way. Like, I saw a bunch of artists put out additions, but it didn't seem as thoughtful as yours. What I really liked about yours was how you were engaging with the NFTs you owned and then engaging with those communities, like early on, the gutter cat gang as what I think of is one of the first editions I bought.
00:00:27.138 - 00:01:01.054, Speaker B: Ears when I did my first edition, that was another moment where I knew that I was like, okay, this is something that's possible to do, but I made the piece head in the metaverse, and it's way different than almost everything else that I've ever done. Literally. It's not even like the comic book half tones and stuff. It's like the only piece that doesn't have that. And I was like, okay, so this definitely, I really wanted to make it because I thought of the idea and I made it and I loved it, but I was like, it definitely can't just be a one of one in popcorn worlds too different. There's a human in it.
00:01:01.172 - 00:01:07.700, Speaker A: Yeah. There's no poplin dudes on the couch. Five bits heads in the metaverse. Yeah.
00:01:08.870 - 00:01:23.238, Speaker B: So I was like, okay, maybe it's time for an addition. I always knew that if I did additions, I didn't want them to be in the one on one collection because I wanted to keep that with the floor. And even back then, there was an average price field.
00:01:23.404 - 00:01:23.926, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:24.028 - 00:01:42.878, Speaker B: So it was like the average price of all the sales. And so if I started selling for 0.5, it would just tank. And I named it Pop Wonder edition. So you just knew because also I had bought additions early on where I thought it was a one on one, and I was getting a great deal because I wasn't paying attention. I didn't know how to read the thing. And I was like, I want to avoid that for other people too.
00:01:42.878 - 00:01:57.630, Speaker B: And so I want to make it clear that there were additions. And then I minted gutter cat gang on day one, and I didn't even know that they were like, you get the rights to do derivative artwork.
00:01:57.790 - 00:01:59.634, Speaker A: I just was like, you're like, fuck it.
00:01:59.752 - 00:02:25.046, Speaker B: But I was like, okay, well, great. And I saw somebody else made one, and I was know at the time, I didn't know if anybody would like or if people would think that was respectable thing to do a derivative because it's like taking somebody else's art, whatever. But there were some dope artists like Dario was doing ape remixes. I was like, okay, well, he's dope. People like him. He's selling them. Let me try to do this.
00:02:25.046 - 00:02:44.302, Speaker B: And I only made seven of that first one. And I was like, because I didn't know if they would sell out. And I even said it might even be in the description. Like, derivative can be a dirty word in the art scene, because if you. Oh, his work is derivative. But I put those up, and they were gone like that.
00:02:44.436 - 00:02:45.614, Speaker A: It was a no brainer for me.
00:02:45.652 - 00:02:47.580, Speaker B: Yeah. And then I was like, okay, great.
