00:00:00.250 - 00:00:22.638, Speaker A: Going back a little bit to cyberburgers. When we were first talking, before we were recording, you were talking about the planning and all the prep that went into the project and how you were building it before hashmax even came out. When did you get the idea for cyberburgers? It sounds like it's starting to develop around this time. You're in voxels and you're meeting all these people thinking about the metaverse. Like, how did the idea for the cyberburgers come up?
00:00:22.724 - 00:00:30.742, Speaker B: Yeah, so there were two things, like, for sure being in crypto voxels, or. Voxels, sorry, that's the name.
00:00:30.796 - 00:00:33.842, Speaker A: I always think of it as CB. Yeah, like the acronym CB.
00:00:33.906 - 00:01:04.862, Speaker B: Same. And actually we have a logo of, it's the old logo now it's in the cyber brokers collection. We have super rare crypto voxels. We have squiggle, we have fun logos. And now that one is outdated. But anyways, the idea really started. Like I said, once I just started learning about the metaverse and these spaces, and also at the same time, at that actual same conference, I met the guys who did the additional app.
00:01:04.862 - 00:01:05.950, Speaker B: Do you know additional.
00:01:06.110 - 00:01:07.166, Speaker A: Yeah, sounds familiar.
00:01:07.198 - 00:01:51.214, Speaker B: Yeah. People were like, you could just take a picture of something and make an NFT. It was literally just taking pictures of some stuff. And there were nfts and that people started picking up a little bit and people started doing their art on there, and people would bid and buy all of these things for affordable, but it would be a really quick way. It was like an Instagram of just nfts, and that app ended up going down. And so all of the pictures were lost and people were devastated and they didn't back it up in time and all this and that also taught me that in combination of learning about the metaverse, I was like, I need to make something that is going to last forever. It's really important to me.
00:01:51.214 - 00:02:22.242, Speaker B: This space is still so new, and people are so uneducated, and I want to make something that is artistically stunning and technically beautiful and innovative. So the early ideas of cyber brokers, I called Ben Heidorn, who's like the most brilliant dev ever smart contract developer, and I said, I want to make cyber brokers. Also. Wait, I can't forget. Another early inspiration was Jimmy with Avastars.
00:02:22.306 - 00:02:22.920, Speaker A: Yes.
00:02:23.390 - 00:02:42.574, Speaker B: I was chatting with him. I was actually going to do the art of, or he asked me to do the art of Avastars. And at first I said, yes, would love to. We're going to put it all on chain SVGs, all these things. And then my life just got too busy, and I didn't want to hold him back, and I was like, I feel so bad. Don't want to hold this back. You need to move forward.
00:02:42.574 - 00:03:09.746, Speaker B: I'm so happy they did, and it obviously turned out amazing, but that was also a really big inspiration. So talking with Ben, I was like, I want them all on chain. Jimmy's done it. We can do it. They all need to be on chain, which means that normally what you guys are buying with NFTs are pictures that are stored on IPFs, hopefully, or something like that. And the problem with additional, they weren't stored anywhere. So when that app went down, all of the pictures went away.
00:03:09.746 - 00:04:04.180, Speaker B: What you think you had that was valuable is gone, is literally gone. And so I was like, I want to create a project that will last forever. And so by us making it in SVGs, which was a big learning curve, we were able to store the most robust art ever made on chain with SVGs. So we made full, like, obviously full characters, stored them all in code directly in a smart contract, the compressors and decompressors. So the inspiration was from learning about virtual worlds, from learning about how to do things on chain, and the right way from Jimmy. And also, just, like, wanting to create a collection that a lot of people could see themselves in that was larger, that people could collect, that would be the foundation to me, bringing everything to life.
