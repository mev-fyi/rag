00:00:34.146 - 00:00:48.070, Speaker A: We're joined by Jay and Silva, Norcal Guy and Patrick Amadon. We're going to probably just dive into a bunch of weird shit. We don't really have any agenda. We just kind of go off the top. It's been a rainy doozy.
00:00:48.150 - 00:00:50.394, Speaker B: It's just been so rainy. And the weather is.
00:00:50.432 - 00:00:51.802, Speaker A: The house is flooding the house.
00:00:51.856 - 00:00:54.238, Speaker B: There's been leaks in the ceiling. We don't know what's going.
00:00:54.324 - 00:00:55.102, Speaker A: Hasn't turned on.
00:00:55.156 - 00:00:56.062, Speaker B: But we just keep going.
00:00:56.116 - 00:00:57.070, Speaker A: Yeah, we just keep going.
00:00:57.140 - 00:01:00.190, Speaker B: So let's just jump into it. Open editions.
00:01:02.630 - 00:01:05.442, Speaker A: All right. Open edition. What do you think about them?
00:01:05.496 - 00:01:22.694, Speaker B: Burnham Fuck Mary. Kill open edition. One to one. Small collection of 100. Jan, let's start off right now here. That one's a little longer. Fuck Mary, kill.
00:01:22.694 - 00:01:23.126, Speaker B: Open it.
00:01:23.148 - 00:01:25.382, Speaker C: That's not fair. Well, marry one of ones.
00:01:25.436 - 00:01:26.680, Speaker B: You'll marry one of.
00:01:34.830 - 00:01:38.214, Speaker C: Can't fuck small collections.
00:01:38.262 - 00:01:41.694, Speaker B: And wait, you're going to marry one to one?
00:01:41.732 - 00:01:42.446, Speaker C: Marry one to one.
00:01:42.468 - 00:01:45.690, Speaker B: You're going to fuck a small collection and kill open edition.
00:01:45.770 - 00:01:52.490, Speaker D: Patrick, I got to go. You want to marry the 25? The small collection.
00:01:52.570 - 00:01:53.200, Speaker B: Okay.
00:01:54.210 - 00:01:56.670, Speaker D: That will sustain you for a long time.
00:01:56.740 - 00:02:00.686, Speaker B: Okay. All right. Sometimes a marriage does that. It depends.
00:02:00.798 - 00:02:03.662, Speaker D: Fuck the one on ones, right? Because those are sexy.
00:02:03.726 - 00:02:04.146, Speaker B: Okay.
00:02:04.248 - 00:02:05.726, Speaker D: And then kill the open edition.
00:02:05.758 - 00:02:10.518, Speaker B: Kill the open edition. Now, this is going to be a tough one. Norcal. I don't know how you're going to answer this one.
00:02:10.604 - 00:02:11.046, Speaker C: No.
00:02:11.148 - 00:02:18.550, Speaker E: Well, if that's the only responses we have, it has to be like, you got to marry the one of one.
00:02:18.620 - 00:02:19.834, Speaker B: Marry the one of one. Yeah.
00:02:19.872 - 00:02:21.062, Speaker E: Fuck the additions.
00:02:21.206 - 00:02:27.398, Speaker B: No, you're going to have sex with the additions. Okay. Yeah. And you're going to kill the small collections.
00:02:27.574 - 00:02:37.306, Speaker E: No, kill the Oe for me, if that's my options. But I love Oes. Or they're not technically oes, though. No, they're timed additions.
00:02:37.338 - 00:02:53.026, Speaker B: They're timed additions. Okay, fair enough. That's a good question. Why? We're on it. We're talking about additions, and additions have been, like, a hot topic. So I guess we'll start with you, guy, because you just created an amazing editions platform with clutch, which is really awesome.
00:02:53.128 - 00:02:53.490, Speaker E: Thanks.
00:02:53.560 - 00:02:59.670, Speaker B: So you can tell us a little about it, but what the difference is between timed and open. Yeah.
00:02:59.740 - 00:03:01.362, Speaker E: So an open edition never closes.
00:03:01.426 - 00:03:02.306, Speaker B: It just never closes.
00:03:02.338 - 00:03:02.920, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:03:03.850 - 00:03:09.010, Speaker B: So most of those editions during open edition seasons were really timed editions.
00:03:09.090 - 00:03:09.526, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:03:09.628 - 00:03:12.360, Speaker B: Right now we have open.
00:03:12.810 - 00:03:14.426, Speaker E: Yeah, no, sorry.
00:03:14.448 - 00:03:16.122, Speaker B: Yours are timed. Yeah.
00:03:16.176 - 00:03:18.486, Speaker E: I mean, they're set editions.
00:03:18.518 - 00:03:19.370, Speaker B: Yeah. Nice.
00:03:19.520 - 00:03:23.982, Speaker A: As an artist, how do you approach an open edition if you have to drop one?
00:03:24.036 - 00:03:25.950, Speaker B: If you have to drop an open edition?
00:03:29.890 - 00:03:40.254, Speaker C: I haven't dropped one in a while. I feel like I was in that first wave of the nifty Gateway open edition mania. Mine was in December.
00:03:40.302 - 00:03:40.994, Speaker B: Yeah. Right.
00:03:41.112 - 00:03:43.422, Speaker C: It was a five minute one with anxiety.
00:03:43.566 - 00:03:43.874, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:43.912 - 00:03:47.934, Speaker C: We did a five minute open edition, and it was very affordably priced.
00:03:47.982 - 00:03:49.574, Speaker B: And how many sold in the end?
00:03:49.692 - 00:04:04.842, Speaker C: I believe it was 105 minutes. Yeah, it's a nice number. And I think that, for me, is kind of like the way I approach it is still just make it very exclusive, still have it for the people that are really paying attention and want to be there.
00:04:04.896 - 00:04:05.210, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:05.280 - 00:04:26.882, Speaker C: But I think with anything, it's just having the right intention and telling the right story of why you're releasing this. I think it's great for getting more collectors, and particularly artists that have had super high metrics and high sales. I'm all for getting my art in the hands of people at a more affordable price.
00:04:26.936 - 00:04:29.380, Speaker B: Let's get your art in the hands of everybody.
00:04:30.630 - 00:04:31.470, Speaker C: That's my goal.
00:04:31.550 - 00:04:32.478, Speaker B: Mass adoption.
00:04:32.574 - 00:04:33.074, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:33.192 - 00:04:36.322, Speaker B: Why should not everybody have J. N Silva art?
00:04:36.456 - 00:04:52.246, Speaker D: I think he makes a really good point, though. He says as long as it fits the narrative, it's got to be a narrative, because I think you just see so many things that just come across, like, purely extractive. You just see somebody sees a moment, there's no real reason for it to be an oe other than like, yeah, I can make a lot of money right now.
00:04:52.268 - 00:04:52.550, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:52.620 - 00:05:00.974, Speaker D: And I feel like that stuff just doesn't particularly age well if there's a real reason for it, cool. But I think people dialing in on a narrative around it, I think makes all the difference in the world.
00:05:01.012 - 00:05:08.000, Speaker B: It depends on what kind of artist. So let's talk about something not so controversial. Sorry, I just started off with that. Patrick, what do you think about super air.
00:05:11.890 - 00:05:12.938, Speaker D: Not controversial.
00:05:13.034 - 00:05:17.154, Speaker B: Yeah, not at all. No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. You know what? No, you can answer that.
00:05:17.192 - 00:05:20.146, Speaker D: Why are we shying away? We shouldn't ramp into this.
00:05:20.168 - 00:05:26.386, Speaker B: Let's just jump straight. We were sponsored by super. That's our sponsor for the.
00:05:26.568 - 00:05:51.434, Speaker D: I have nothing but respect for Supra's role in the space. I think they played, like, a really critical part in the whole ecosystem in making art work, especially, like, kind of 20 18, 20, 19, 20 20. I think they got into trouble, though, when they tried to expand into their founders vision of turning into the next OpenSea, which is so unbelievably disconnected from.
00:05:51.472 - 00:05:54.554, Speaker B: An elite, especially when OpenSea is faltering itself.
00:05:54.672 - 00:05:55.338, Speaker D: Right.
00:05:55.504 - 00:05:56.558, Speaker B: It really doesn't make any sense.
00:05:56.564 - 00:05:57.774, Speaker D: That looks like a great business model.
00:05:57.812 - 00:05:58.286, Speaker C: Let's do that.
00:05:58.308 - 00:05:58.782, Speaker B: Let's do that.
00:05:58.836 - 00:06:17.586, Speaker D: And I think they kind of muddled everything. Like, when they launched spaces and spaces wasn't really separated from curated. Then all of a sudden you had super rare as this elite art platform, but nobody could tell, like, wait, is this a spaces contract or is this actual curated super rare? You go on the platform, there's no discoverability to begin with, so it just really muddied the water and all of a sudden everybody was on super rare.
00:06:17.778 - 00:06:22.630, Speaker B: Do you think it's the same thing like it is now with everybody going to Sotheby's?
00:06:24.090 - 00:06:43.894, Speaker C: That's an interesting mean, I think, you know, Sotheby's is Sotheby's for a reason. And I think for a lot of know, it's like a notch in their belt and it's something know, kind of bridges and validates what they've been doing in this space kind of with more in the traditional art.
00:06:44.032 - 00:06:55.010, Speaker B: Right. I mean, Sotheby's is still Sotheby's. Just the question is, are we taking on. I think there's also levels of types of auction at Sotheby's that people don't fully understand. Right?
00:06:55.160 - 00:06:56.740, Speaker D: Very much. So now.
00:06:58.950 - 00:07:29.322, Speaker B: Are an auction definitely by Sotheby's. But it's not the hammer auction at night with 20 pieces. Right. It's like the minor leagues of that, which is still amazing and still makes sense because if you think about how art, the art industry has not been disrupted at all and there's billions of dollars every year in low and medium source sized galleries. For a larger gallery to take some of that business would be key. So that's why I think this makes a lot of sense.
00:07:29.376 - 00:08:03.874, Speaker C: Well, and I think if we can introduce more traditional collectors to what we're doing here. That's a net positive for the space. I just hope that celebies gives all these artists the support they deserve when they do these auctions, because this past one was a fairly large one, and I personally didn't see that much of a push from Sotheby's. So I hope maybe on the back end they're reaching out to collectors and telling them why these artists are part of the collection, why they're important. And I think if they're doing that, then that's amazing. But I hope they're not using the artists to just create hype.
00:08:04.002 - 00:08:04.486, Speaker B: I hope not.
00:08:04.508 - 00:08:29.022, Speaker D: Also, I agree with you completely. Yeah, I think purely extractive. Right. I think that's the big concern. My biggest concern initially, because it's really against auction houses at the beginning, because I felt like they were coming in and trying to establish themselves almost as the new gatekeeper for who was good. Or perhaps they'd come in and we'd all then establish them as the gatekeeper for us, saying, okay, Wait, who did Sotheby's pick? Who's a good artist? Like, they take over that role from superair. And I don't think that's healthy for the space.
00:08:29.022 - 00:08:36.014, Speaker D: And I love the fact that super has fallen off because now it's on us to pick who the winners are.
00:08:36.052 - 00:08:36.254, Speaker C: Right?
00:08:36.292 - 00:08:43.122, Speaker D: Like you can mint on manifold AOTm superair. Like, whatever, it doesn't matter. It's who you are in the community and the role your art plays now.
00:08:43.176 - 00:08:49.880, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that's going to be important. So let's now talk about. Nothing has to do with NFTs. Let's talk about your.
00:08:54.010 - 00:08:56.280, Speaker C: Can we go for days now?
00:08:56.810 - 00:09:07.302, Speaker B: You have a lovely, I mean, this is a great beard also. I'm just saying they can't see it because maybe under the PFP they'll see a little bit. But guy norcal has a great beard.
00:09:07.366 - 00:09:08.074, Speaker C: It's beautiful.
00:09:08.192 - 00:09:14.190, Speaker B: It's a beautiful beard. You have been a photographer for a very long time.
00:09:14.340 - 00:09:14.798, Speaker C: Yes.
00:09:14.884 - 00:09:19.962, Speaker B: And you have an amazing partner, right? Yes. Are you married?
00:09:20.026 - 00:09:21.210, Speaker C: I am married, indeed.
00:09:21.290 - 00:09:23.022, Speaker B: And how long you been married for?
00:09:23.156 - 00:09:24.720, Speaker C: It's about to be three years.
00:09:25.570 - 00:09:31.890, Speaker B: What? I see you guys, I feel like she travels with you. She's with you a lot. She supports you. A mean. That must mean a big thing.
00:09:31.960 - 00:09:41.334, Speaker C: She's incredible. She is, you know, a large reason of why I'm where I'm at. She's been an incredible support system. We compliment each other so well, so.
00:09:41.372 - 00:09:43.990, Speaker B: Can you tell us about how you guys got married in Vegas.
00:09:44.810 - 00:09:46.290, Speaker C: I thought we were talking about beards.
00:09:46.370 - 00:09:46.662, Speaker B: No.
00:09:46.716 - 00:10:03.050, Speaker C: Okay, let's do it. Yeah. It was a really cool story. So we had been dating for about nine or ten years at the time. I moved to the United States in 1996. I didn't get my citizenship until 2019.
00:10:03.130 - 00:10:04.586, Speaker B: From Russia, right? You're russian?
00:10:04.698 - 00:10:05.546, Speaker C: I'm venezuelan.
00:10:05.578 - 00:10:07.120, Speaker B: Oh, sorry. Close.
00:10:08.530 - 00:10:20.226, Speaker C: I have some odd ties to Russia. My grandfather, who I'm named after, that's why everyone asked me why Jay and Silva. And my grandfather was an author, and he would sign all his books. Jay and Silva, really? Yeah.
00:10:20.248 - 00:10:22.958, Speaker B: So cool. Do you have any of his books?
00:10:23.054 - 00:10:25.090, Speaker C: Yeah, I do have some of his poetry books.
00:10:25.430 - 00:10:26.034, Speaker B: Amazing.
00:10:26.152 - 00:10:34.230, Speaker C: Yeah, he was a G. Anyhow, he actually got his PhD in philosophy and language arts in Russia during the Cold war.
00:10:34.300 - 00:10:34.918, Speaker B: Wow.
00:10:35.084 - 00:10:43.542, Speaker C: Crazy. And I did not know this know fairly recently, and I majored in philosophy and language arts just on my own without knowing.
00:10:43.606 - 00:10:44.998, Speaker B: And you never knew this about your grandfather?
00:10:45.014 - 00:10:47.594, Speaker C: I didn't know that until after I did it.
00:10:47.792 - 00:10:49.334, Speaker B: Were you named after your grandfather?
00:10:49.382 - 00:10:49.546, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:49.568 - 00:10:50.810, Speaker B: So you never met him?
00:10:50.960 - 00:10:58.480, Speaker C: No, it was his dying wish. My mom had some other crazy name for me, and as he was passing, like, I want my grandson to name after crazy. Yeah.
00:10:59.970 - 00:11:14.930, Speaker B: My brother's name is David, but they thought he was a girl at first, so they made all the children's chests and stuff and his clothing and whatever in the room, and his name was Sparkles.
00:11:15.350 - 00:11:17.922, Speaker C: Sparkles. And then when did they change it?
00:11:17.976 - 00:11:43.730, Speaker B: When they found that it was a boy, and then it became David. Now, my parents smoked a lot of pot in the 70s. Okay. Yeah. Anyway, so go back to your roots, because I know that you've been a photographer a long time. You come from this amazing sort of group of photographers I know, specifically guy and I. And these have bought a ton know Monaris and Dave and Ovak.
00:11:43.730 - 00:12:02.238, Speaker B: And this has been a tight group. And germ and all these amazing photographers that were on Instagram. I know that you basically were one of the OGs there. And then you guys came here, and we've heard kind of like Dave talk about it, but he's mentioned how you were the first person to kind of bring everybody in as an ambassador.
00:12:02.334 - 00:12:13.558, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So, I mean, I've been doing photography for 20 years now. I started in 2003, and I started because when we moved from Venezuela, we came with nothing. So I lost all of the photos of me as a child.
00:12:13.644 - 00:12:13.942, Speaker B: Wow.
00:12:13.996 - 00:12:40.574, Speaker C: And then my mom remarried here, had a little sister and brother, and I was like, I'm going to document the shit out of their lives. I'm going to make sure that they have every photo. And that's like my 1st 10,000 photos are just my brother and my sister. And this was around high school then. I was always really shy. So in college, the camera just became kind of like my way of not being awkward because if I'm at a party or somewhere, I'm like, if I have a camera, I know what I'm going to do, right? And I don't have to talk to anyone. I could just be.
00:12:40.574 - 00:13:10.074, Speaker C: And I never liked being in photos back then. And then after college, because I majored in philosophy and language arts, I couldn't find the job, of course. It was like right after the recession. So I was like, well, I know how to do photography and I was doing anything I could. I put up flyers in my university to do headshots for the dancers and the actors. And then back home I was doing like maternity shoots, weddings, engagements, you name it, like whatever. If you wanted to pay me to take a photo, I was doing it.
00:13:10.074 - 00:13:25.806, Speaker C: Wow. And then I got really tired of just photography became work, and I was doing just work that I wasn't enjoying and that coincided with Instagram coming out. And I was like, oh, there's this interesting app. And you couldn't before a lot of.
00:13:25.828 - 00:13:26.846, Speaker B: Followers and stuff like that.
00:13:26.868 - 00:13:43.170, Speaker C: Yeah, it was very early 2012, 2013. And at the time, for the first, like three or four years, I want to say three years of Instagram, you couldn't upload DSLR photos or any other photos, your phone. So I was like, okay, this is fun. I'll get my phone and I'll go.
00:13:43.240 - 00:13:46.514, Speaker B: At the beginning, they wanted you to take a picture from your phone.
00:13:46.552 - 00:14:12.246, Speaker C: It was only, yeah, it wasn't even like, the technology wasn't there for you to upload anything. Yeah. And I remember I was browsing this app and I found this photographer, Jason M. Peterson, and his thing said, 100% iPhone. And I saw his photos and I was like, I could not believe it that he was shooting all of that on the phone. And I was like, okay, I need to figure out how to shoot on this damn phone. And all those years, I started just like, walking.
00:14:12.246 - 00:14:42.582, Speaker C: I would walk New York every day just like sunrise to sunset, taking photos on my phone. And it really made me a much better photographer because you're forced to really focus on composition. You're limited by the specs of the cameras. Like iPhone four, iPhone five, I don't know, very early, and you kind of have to really be in the moment zoom with your feet. So it really taught me a lot. And I remember I would be browsing. Instagram would have a lot of features, and they would feature different people.
00:14:42.582 - 00:14:54.602, Speaker C: And they featured one day something called, like, an insta meet. And I was like, an insta meet? What's that? And I started going through the hashtag, and I saw that people were meeting up and taking photos together. And I was like, it's a photo walk.
00:14:54.656 - 00:14:54.778, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:54.784 - 00:15:09.406, Speaker C: And I was like, oh, this is know. Photography has been, like, a very solitary thing for me. I've always been just me. I was like, okay, I'd love to check one of these out. And there was an Instagram account called Instagram NYC. And I saw that they were hosting one. I was like, okay, I'm going to go.
00:15:09.406 - 00:15:18.946, Speaker C: And I brought a budy with me just for moral support, was it? No, no. Phil had not gotten into photography at the point.
00:15:19.128 - 00:15:22.722, Speaker B: By the way, he's a phenomenal artist. When is he dropping something?
00:15:22.856 - 00:15:30.142, Speaker C: Soon. Very soon, actually. Yeah, I'm excited. Phil, man, sorry. It's much. Yeah. So much talent, so many skills.
00:15:30.206 - 00:15:32.030, Speaker B: So is that how you met, like, Dave?
00:15:32.110 - 00:16:01.354, Speaker C: So I went to this instant meet, and I met kind of, like, a few pivotal people in the New York City community back then. And literally a few weeks later, Instagram was doing what they called worldwide Instamate weekend. And this is where they encourage people to host a meetup and hang out. And I was, you know, to my first one, who was doing the meetup for New York, and I hit up the people at Instagram NYC. They're like, no, we're out of town. And I started just, like, looking for people, and no one was hosting a meetup. I was like, what do you mean? Like, New York City is not having, like, a meetup.
00:16:01.354 - 00:16:24.854, Speaker C: And the guys at Instagram and NYC, they were like, hey, we'll give you access to our account. They had, like, 12,000 followers at the time, which was massive. They're like, we'll link you with this guy, Jacob Santiago, incredible New York City photographer, who at the time had, like, 19,000 followers, which was like, this guy's famous, and maybe you guys can host something and we can help you promote it.
00:16:24.892 - 00:16:25.046, Speaker B: Right?
00:16:25.068 - 00:16:36.214, Speaker C: And I was, like, super nervous. I'm like, okay, sure. And we planned this meetup, and actually, April 6 is a ten year anniversary of this meetup, which is kind of wild.
00:16:36.342 - 00:16:36.954, Speaker B: You might have to.
00:16:36.992 - 00:16:58.130, Speaker C: I'm trying to fly. Yeah, dude, that would be amazing. I'm talking to a few people to see if they sponsor me hosting the ten year reunion. Because at that meetup, I met like Ilich Peters. I met this guy, Kevin Ornellas, Omar Robles. I met him that day there. And I met just like an amazing group of photographers from New York.
00:16:58.130 - 00:17:11.622, Speaker C: And we actually ended up, the photo that I took and posted ended up getting featured by Instagram on the Monday. But the funny thing is, they featured it from the Instagram NYC account, not my account. So they gained a ton of followers. Right?
00:17:11.676 - 00:17:13.238, Speaker B: And they didn't even show up.
00:17:13.404 - 00:17:30.734, Speaker C: Yeah, but it worked out because I very much always say that that was like a pivotal, pivotal point in just my life and career. Because from there on, I was connected to these people. And then I became the instamme guy. They're like, okay, when's the next one? No, that was like a one time thing.
00:17:30.932 - 00:17:39.998, Speaker B: Those street meetups, I went on like a few, yeah, they're amazing. And I'm not even a photographer. You probably love them.
00:17:40.084 - 00:17:41.070, Speaker C: It's incredible.
00:17:42.130 - 00:17:50.702, Speaker B: Guy is a great photographer, I'm sure. No, he really is. He's not going to admit it, but he's also an amazing artist.
00:17:50.846 - 00:17:57.106, Speaker C: So from there, Ilich, we kind of consider him like the godfather of everyone, Ilish Peters. And he's in Web city too.
00:17:57.128 - 00:17:58.786, Speaker B: He has a lot of iota genesis.
00:17:58.818 - 00:18:25.386, Speaker C: Just in case anybody wants amazing. But he introduced me to Dave, to Steve sweatpants, to Sean, who's part of Animus. Ilish introduced me to all of my core friends, and particularly Dave. And I really got along, and we were just like, let's keep doing this. Let's keep hosting these meetups. And at the time, it was growing really fast. We would say, hey, let's meet in Queens, 06:00 a.m.
00:18:25.386 - 00:18:29.082, Speaker C: On a Saturday. And we would get 400 people at 06:00 a.m. On a Saturday. Just mobbing.
00:18:29.146 - 00:18:38.366, Speaker B: I heard, like the two of you were like a dynamic deal. And anytime you're like, oh, something cool is happening, like, the moon is going to be here, there might be a storm, you're like, let's meet this. And then people would just, and it.
00:18:38.388 - 00:18:54.454, Speaker C: Was really special because then people would fly in to visit New YOrk and they would hit us up and be like, hey, can you guys host something for us? So we would show photographers from all over the world. And when I started traveling, literally anywhere I went, everyone would say, you guys in New York have the best community. There's nothing like that.
00:18:54.492 - 00:18:56.614, Speaker B: And I think that spilled over to.
00:18:56.652 - 00:19:14.138, Speaker C: What a lot of that's true. So when I got into Web three. I was pretty early to the whole thing and Crypto, and when I saw it happening, I was like, I got to put the crew on. So I called my friend. If I get Dave in, he'll get 100 people in. If I bring Ilich in, he'll bring 100 people in. If I get Ruby in, he'll bring 100 people in.
00:19:14.138 - 00:19:28.386, Speaker C: And I just started. All of my 2020 was just facetiming people, and they all thought I was insane. They're like, okay, do you have COVID right now? I'm like, no, dude, you got to open up a metamask, and you got to apply. They're like, the world is, like, about to end. We're, like, in the apocalypse and.
00:19:28.408 - 00:19:37.382, Speaker B: What are you talking about? You were in New York during COVID Yeah, New Jersey. Did you take some epic pictures of just, like, empty streets and stuff?
00:19:37.436 - 00:19:44.050, Speaker C: No, I unfortunately did not. So my wife's mother got a kidney transplant in February.
00:19:44.130 - 00:19:44.838, Speaker B: Oh, my God, 2020.
00:19:44.844 - 00:19:50.322, Speaker C: And she's very immunocompromised, and the doctor was like, if she even catches a cold.
00:19:50.386 - 00:19:51.754, Speaker B: So you guys were like, really at a.
00:19:51.792 - 00:20:14.206, Speaker C: No, my wife was like, you cannot risk know. But I did go out for the black lives Matters protest. I was like, I couldn't. So I went to all of those and have some really amazing photos from there. But I did take photos in New Jersey, and just, like, I would go on walks and bring my camera, but I couldn't go to New York that much.
00:20:14.228 - 00:20:20.382, Speaker B: Deez takes pictures. We try to see who takes better pictures, and he beats me every time, and then he posts about it to flex.
00:20:20.526 - 00:20:23.106, Speaker A: That's a fun thing we do on Twitter. That's a new game.
00:20:23.208 - 00:20:23.858, Speaker B: It's okay.
00:20:23.944 - 00:20:28.520, Speaker A: Sometimes I'll just see Benny taking a picture in public, and then I'm like, oh, I'm going to take a better one.
00:20:29.370 - 00:20:31.382, Speaker B: I take the worst pictures. I'm just going to be.
00:20:31.436 - 00:20:39.542, Speaker A: Benny just was like, it's like, looking up here, shooting down, hits it, and it's like, oh, it's beautiful.
00:20:39.596 - 00:20:46.874, Speaker B: It's done. True. Listen, it's about the thought, though. I'm giving you the right spot to take. I just don't do the right angles. That's what it is.
00:20:46.912 - 00:20:48.810, Speaker A: Yeah, your vibrational detector.
00:20:49.470 - 00:20:52.270, Speaker B: So, Patrick, did you do photography?
00:20:54.210 - 00:21:05.018, Speaker D: Yeah, I do a little photography. I wouldn't call myself a photographer, but I definitely walk around downtown a lot, and wherever I go and bring a camera, I would be interested to see.
00:21:05.044 - 00:21:08.942, Speaker B: What a Patrick picture would look shooting.
00:21:09.006 - 00:21:11.522, Speaker D: I don't like shooting street art. I feel like that's somebody else's art.
00:21:11.576 - 00:21:11.986, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:12.088 - 00:21:14.958, Speaker D: But I really love shooting, like, decayed urban landscape.
00:21:14.974 - 00:21:18.694, Speaker B: I was going to say something about chaos, something about destruction. Yeah.
00:21:18.732 - 00:21:28.102, Speaker D: So, like, across the bridge, downtown LA is pretty gentrified now, right? There's no more artists in the arts district. Like, there should be like, a petition to change the name.
00:21:28.156 - 00:21:28.760, Speaker B: Now.
00:21:29.130 - 00:21:30.694, Speaker A: How long have you been in LA?
00:21:30.812 - 00:21:33.002, Speaker D: I've been in LA for 15 years now.
00:21:33.056 - 00:21:39.226, Speaker A: Okay, so you've seen a lot of change over the 15 years. How's it changed then, over the last 15 years since you got here?
00:21:39.328 - 00:21:59.758, Speaker D: Just mostly gentrification. I mean, downtown used to just close like 06:00 the few finance people that were down there would just leave. The shutters would go down, even the middle of downtown, and that was it. Just homeless people. And then now it's sort of a proper city. I'm not going to go as far to say it is a proper city, but it's getting closer.
00:21:59.854 - 00:22:01.394, Speaker B: Where'd you live before that?
00:22:01.592 - 00:22:06.710, Speaker D: Before that, I went to school in Russia and Illinois.
00:22:07.770 - 00:22:08.770, Speaker B: Russia, Illinois.
00:22:08.850 - 00:22:11.800, Speaker D: Russia and Illinois. Studied abroad also.
00:22:12.890 - 00:22:14.470, Speaker B: Like JM's grandfather?
00:22:16.010 - 00:22:18.358, Speaker D: Yeah, I studied literature over there.
00:22:18.444 - 00:22:18.998, Speaker B: Oh, really?
00:22:19.084 - 00:22:20.354, Speaker A: So you speak Russian?
00:22:20.482 - 00:22:23.878, Speaker D: I used to. It's amazing how quickly things go if you don't practice.
00:22:23.974 - 00:22:24.620, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:25.630 - 00:22:28.022, Speaker B: Did you go to school and learn in Russian?
00:22:28.166 - 00:22:35.486, Speaker D: I studied it for a couple of years before I went over there. Language and literature. And then when I went over and studied there, just spoke it the whole time I was there.
00:22:35.588 - 00:22:42.334, Speaker B: Okay, so now that we're on the topic, how do you pronounce your last name? Let's just make sure everybody knows this for good.
00:22:42.452 - 00:22:43.786, Speaker D: Appreciate it. Amadon.
00:22:43.898 - 00:22:50.250, Speaker B: Amadon. Yeah. And what is that? Is that Greek? Are you from a. Is that. It sounds very greek.
00:22:50.330 - 00:22:52.298, Speaker D: Yeah, it's actually french.
00:22:52.394 - 00:22:52.750, Speaker B: Okay.
00:22:52.820 - 00:22:55.280, Speaker D: Yeah, I was. Yeah.
00:23:08.250 - 00:23:10.038, Speaker B: Do you have family in France still?
00:23:10.124 - 00:23:12.038, Speaker D: No, ages ago.
00:23:12.124 - 00:23:14.380, Speaker B: All right, and what does the Amazon mean?
00:23:14.910 - 00:23:16.186, Speaker D: I have no idea.
00:23:16.368 - 00:23:18.634, Speaker B: We got to know this. Someone has to look this up, man.
00:23:18.672 - 00:23:22.174, Speaker D: Google it at some point. It's just not high on the to do list.
00:23:22.292 - 00:23:30.142, Speaker B: What's English from? French, right? You said it's french? Yeah. Amadan. Yeah. Nice.
00:23:30.276 - 00:23:32.814, Speaker D: This is good. I'm going to have a takeaway here.
00:23:32.852 - 00:23:37.426, Speaker B: No. Did you ever do the 23 andme thing? No. Did you ever do it?
00:23:37.528 - 00:23:38.340, Speaker C: I did.
00:23:38.710 - 00:23:40.660, Speaker B: Where was your family mostly from?
00:23:45.050 - 00:23:57.010, Speaker C: So I think equal, like 2020 and 20% was Portugal, Spain, and native South America.
00:23:57.170 - 00:24:00.882, Speaker B: Native South America? Yeah. Wow, that's like Incas.
00:24:01.026 - 00:24:05.610, Speaker C: Yeah. So it was 2020 and then it was just a wild mix.
00:24:06.830 - 00:24:16.302, Speaker B: That's a great question. If you could take a time machine to take a picture anywhere in history, you could be there for like, an hour. What would it be?
00:24:16.436 - 00:24:37.426, Speaker C: The library of Alexandria, easily. I would just tour the library of Alexandria and just document that was like thousands of years of innovation and literature and art, of everything that the humans had accomplished up to that point. That's like my single greatest. I feel grief and I feel like.
00:24:37.448 - 00:24:39.518, Speaker B: Animus has a lot of feel that way.
00:24:39.544 - 00:24:53.722, Speaker C: Yes, animus. That is like, our core values are very much rooted in kind of like classical education, the language, philosophy, mythology, all of that stuff.
00:24:53.856 - 00:25:02.720, Speaker B: And, Patrick, if you could take a time machine to go back to any violent riot history, you know, which one would it be?
00:25:03.970 - 00:25:23.042, Speaker D: Well, for the photo one, I'd be fascinated to go see, like, 1970s New York, because back then there was a huge graffiti scene they didn't paint over the subways, so there's just a ton of art everywhere. I think that'd be plus, like, an amazing art scene at the time, too. So I feel like that would have been something.
00:25:23.096 - 00:25:50.262, Speaker B: Well, we have an update. Ahmedan comes from a derivative, like, everybody's art from Ahmat beloved. Okay, so that's that. And also, it turns out most of your family, Amadan family, was found in USA, UK, Canada between 1840 and 1920. Are you sure you're from France?
00:25:50.406 - 00:25:51.100, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:51.870 - 00:25:53.406, Speaker B: Maybe you came like your. They came over.
00:25:53.428 - 00:25:56.330, Speaker D: They're french Huguenots. They came over 16 hundreds.
00:25:56.410 - 00:26:03.902, Speaker B: Dude, that's fucking crazy. That's your family. Great great grandparents. Wow. So your family's been in this country since both sides.
00:26:04.046 - 00:26:05.246, Speaker D: 16 hundreds.
00:26:05.358 - 00:26:05.730, Speaker B: Really?
00:26:05.800 - 00:26:06.420, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:26:07.110 - 00:26:11.490, Speaker B: I feel like, guy, you're probably the same way. Where's your family from?
00:26:11.560 - 00:26:14.130, Speaker E: Yeah, they're like german immigrants.
00:26:14.470 - 00:26:16.686, Speaker B: They came in the early 19 hundreds.
00:26:16.798 - 00:26:18.606, Speaker E: No, probably 1818 hundreds.
00:26:18.638 - 00:26:23.490, Speaker B: Yeah, I could see that. You look like you could live in the 18 hundreds a little bit with that beard.
00:26:23.650 - 00:26:25.202, Speaker C: Where would you take a photo?
00:26:25.266 - 00:26:26.706, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been curious.
00:26:26.898 - 00:26:28.746, Speaker C: I want everyone to answer that question. That's a really good one.
00:26:28.768 - 00:26:29.766, Speaker B: That's a good question. Dude.
00:26:29.798 - 00:26:34.620, Speaker E: That's a tough one. There's so many interesting points in history.
00:26:36.590 - 00:26:37.340, Speaker B: Like.
00:26:40.450 - 00:26:42.480, Speaker E: Feel like, I don't know.
00:26:46.280 - 00:26:47.030, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:26:47.800 - 00:26:53.600, Speaker E: Egyptian times back in Egypt or if Atlantis was a real thing. Atlantis.
00:26:53.760 - 00:26:54.870, Speaker B: I like that.
00:26:55.180 - 00:26:56.024, Speaker C: That's really good.
00:26:56.062 - 00:26:58.920, Speaker B: These. I'm actually really curious about this one.
00:26:59.070 - 00:27:00.792, Speaker A: Oh, no, there's a couple that come to mind.
00:27:00.846 - 00:27:05.540, Speaker B: Okay. You can. The first peace pipe.
00:27:05.700 - 00:27:24.512, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, the last supper comes to mind, but, like, taking pictures of it, I think would have been cool. Or like something around the crucifixion. Time and the time of Jesus. And then before that, I think the Great Wall of China would be an interesting thing to see. But can we go back to dinosaurs? Is that on?
00:27:24.566 - 00:27:25.616, Speaker B: Yeah, you can go back as far.
00:27:25.638 - 00:27:32.248, Speaker A: As you want because that's another one that comes to mind where if you could be safe and take pictures of fucking dinosaurs.
00:27:32.284 - 00:27:33.232, Speaker D: That's a good asterisk.
00:27:33.296 - 00:27:35.590, Speaker A: The world was still Pangaea or whatever.
00:27:36.120 - 00:27:38.580, Speaker B: When it was billions of years ago.
00:27:38.650 - 00:27:39.316, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:39.498 - 00:27:46.948, Speaker B: Maybe taking a picture of the first time the animal went on, started breathing on land.
00:27:47.114 - 00:28:02.936, Speaker A: I want the best microscopic telescope possible, and I want to go back to the time the first single celled organism somehow turned into the second. The second. And then it became a multicellular organism, and then crazy shit happened after that would be historical.
00:28:03.048 - 00:28:04.664, Speaker B: Now we're getting deep.
00:28:04.792 - 00:28:07.900, Speaker D: I go back to the moment before the big bang.
00:28:10.880 - 00:28:39.656, Speaker B: Now, that's interesting because really. Right? Isn't that, like, the only thing scientists say, like, they can't tell you what happened before it, right. Because it's impossible to know, so I don't even know what that would look like. Is that even possible? Well, I had to go back in time, take a picture of one thing. It could be anything. I mean, I have to think about that. But it's easy to say, like, a sports moment for me.
00:28:39.656 - 00:29:16.710, Speaker B: I'm a big met fan, like the 69 Mets when they won the World Series. But I think if I had to pick one true moment, it would probably be like. I would probably go back to the time of Abraham and the day he said he heard God's voice. Because I want to know if he was full of shit or not. I want to be there at that moment to take a picture of that. So to see now, it's interesting because if I take a photograph, you won't know, but at least they'll be able to see. But it would just like to be able to know if that.
00:29:16.710 - 00:29:20.064, Speaker B: I want a vibe check. I want to be like, yo, what's up, Abraham?
00:29:20.112 - 00:29:20.932, Speaker C: Abraham is crazy.
00:29:20.986 - 00:29:23.444, Speaker B: Yeah. Are you crazy? Or, like, I want to know what's really going on.
00:29:23.482 - 00:29:27.396, Speaker D: I can appreciate you're a real Mets fan because you thought about multiple.
00:29:27.588 - 00:29:28.232, Speaker B: Yes.
00:29:28.366 - 00:29:28.760, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:29:28.830 - 00:29:59.436, Speaker B: See, there you go. There you go. I mean, there's not that many moments for Met fans, but I think it's interesting also, like, the idea of a photograph. I met somebody once who told me that he never takes pictures because he said, why would I waste my time taking pictures when I could live the moment? He said that to me, and I thought about that a lot. For a very long time. But in the end, also, you live your moments through the pictures. Right.
00:29:59.436 - 00:30:16.776, Speaker B: So it's a balance in some ways, right? Because we're on our phones all the time. And I notice, like, I look at my phone, though, because that's why I think about it, and I have, like, thousands and thousands of pictures. I'm like, maybe I should put my phone down less to take a picture and just enjoy that moment than the second. And I think there's something to that a little bit.
00:30:16.878 - 00:30:57.364, Speaker C: There is, for sure. Memory is a very fickle bitch, honestly, because as you get older, your cells kind of, like, degenerate and you don't remember things as well. And even when they do the studies for crime scenes and witnesses, it's all just totally twisted and so subjective. That's why I really enjoy photography, because you're kind of, like, objectively capturing this, I guess, perception of reality. I don't know if that's a whole other metaphysical conversation, whether what's base reality and what's not.
00:30:57.402 - 00:30:59.300, Speaker B: Well, taking the picture.
00:30:59.720 - 00:31:22.172, Speaker C: Yeah. And I go through this all the time because I'm, like, a huge, huge music fan, right. And music is probably my biggest passion, honestly. So I've kind of been able to mesh that passion with photography. And I love shooting music and a lot of shows. When it's my favorite artist, I'm like, do I take the photo or do I enjoy the moment of being in this song that I really love?
00:31:22.226 - 00:31:22.588, Speaker B: Right.
00:31:22.674 - 00:31:29.064, Speaker C: I've done both. And sometimes I'll just kind of shoot here, but really try to enjoy it. Or just like, I do notice.
00:31:29.192 - 00:31:44.880, Speaker B: I noticed that sometimes, like, you, monaris, dave, like, a bunch of you, sometimes we'll just be walking and you're not doing this, but it's down here and you're just. And you guys just, like, are clicking and clicking while you're talking to people.
00:31:44.950 - 00:32:12.604, Speaker C: Also, I have my finger here. Photography is just like the art of observation, right? And that's why I really love it. And that's why I feel like photography makes me live in the moment more, because it forces me to pay attention to everything going on around me. I'm like a huge observer, right? And even now or whenever I'm at a party event, I'm always just, like, looking around, checking off, and I'll just, like, in my mind, it's almost like I'm always taking pictures because, oh, wow. It's a really good smile. There's emotion over there. They're having a really good time.
00:32:12.604 - 00:32:31.728, Speaker C: Or this lighting is hitting in a really interesting way. Look at this composition. And that's just me, generally, if I have a camera, I usually just grip it like this. And I'm just like. And it's kind of fun. It's a fun little exercise. I don't do it all the time, but I'll switch off and I'll play games where, like, okay, today I'm going to just shoot from the hip and see what comes out.
00:32:31.728 - 00:32:33.756, Speaker C: Some days I'm going to really get in people's faces.
00:32:33.788 - 00:32:49.512, Speaker B: I'm going to ask you a tough question. If I said to you you could either never take a picture in the rest of your life or never have sex, which one would you choose? What?
00:32:49.646 - 00:32:50.760, Speaker D: Learn to paint?
00:32:53.900 - 00:32:56.548, Speaker C: Yeah. No, it's probably over for photography.
00:32:56.644 - 00:32:57.556, Speaker B: Over for photography?
00:32:57.588 - 00:32:59.370, Speaker C: Yeah. My wife would kill me.
00:33:01.360 - 00:33:04.828, Speaker B: I understand. You have a wife. Right. But I'm just saying in general, if you had.
00:33:04.914 - 00:33:05.768, Speaker C: Hypothetically.
00:33:05.864 - 00:33:06.824, Speaker B: Hypothetically.
00:33:06.952 - 00:33:10.430, Speaker C: Oh, man, you got to turn me to a eunuch or something.
00:33:14.080 - 00:33:14.832, Speaker B: We know the answer.
00:33:14.886 - 00:33:20.672, Speaker C: I thought it was going to be take a photo or never listen to music again. That would be a really crazy.
00:33:20.726 - 00:33:25.910, Speaker B: Okay, so what would that be if you never take a photo or never listen to music?
00:33:26.520 - 00:33:31.380, Speaker C: I'm sorry for the photographers and those who believe in me, but I need music.
00:33:31.450 - 00:33:35.428, Speaker B: You need music. I need music. Music is your life. Yeah, I need music. Interesting.
00:33:35.514 - 00:33:43.064, Speaker C: If I don't listen to music or, like, albums or songs for even two, three, four days, it messes up.
00:33:43.102 - 00:33:43.880, Speaker D: Rugged.
00:33:44.220 - 00:33:46.276, Speaker B: Do you listen to music while you paint?
00:33:46.468 - 00:33:48.632, Speaker D: I listen to nothing while I do my work.
00:33:48.686 - 00:33:49.290, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:33:49.600 - 00:34:01.660, Speaker D: I can't focus to the same level. If there's anything going on at all, I've tried it because I like music a lot, but something about while I'm actually painting or creating, if there's anything distracting.
00:34:02.000 - 00:34:05.168, Speaker B: And are you focused on the art or is there other things going on your head?
00:34:05.254 - 00:34:15.904, Speaker D: Usually no, just the art. Just like what I'm trying to do. I'm kind of one track that way. I just have to focus everything on the one thing I'm doing. I can't split my focus.
00:34:15.942 - 00:34:17.860, Speaker B: What did you do before being an artist?
00:34:18.840 - 00:34:21.844, Speaker D: I've been an artist for as long as I can.
00:34:21.962 - 00:34:23.364, Speaker B: Did you go to art school or just.
00:34:23.402 - 00:34:31.850, Speaker D: I studied art history. Art history in school. I got into art right after school, and so that's just kind of what I've been doing the whole time.
00:34:32.300 - 00:34:40.404, Speaker B: So, guy, why don't you tell us about your little project that I think is amazing? No, the photography.
00:34:40.532 - 00:34:41.208, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:34:41.374 - 00:34:45.772, Speaker B: I think it's just a phenomenal idea. I don't know, Jay. Did you ever see this one that he's doing? It's so great.
00:34:45.826 - 00:34:46.284, Speaker C: I love it.
00:34:46.322 - 00:34:46.524, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:46.562 - 00:35:19.720, Speaker E: So I have a Fuji Roy with the built in printer. So it's a digital camera with the printer built in, and people can take pictures and then print the ones that they like. So the project is, I took the first picture, I minted it, and I signed the physical. And whoever won the auction, I mailed it to them, and it was their turn to do. Decide on a picture to print, sign, and then list for auction. So each person gets the physical and the digital version of it.
00:35:19.870 - 00:35:21.464, Speaker C: That's amazing. I have seen that.
00:35:21.502 - 00:35:27.960, Speaker B: And it gets passed, and, like, every time someone buys it, the next one, it gets passed them. And gets passed them. I think artifaction has one now.
00:35:28.030 - 00:35:29.612, Speaker E: Yes. Already has it right now.
00:35:29.666 - 00:35:31.070, Speaker B: Fuck. Render did it.
00:35:33.040 - 00:35:35.708, Speaker E: He wants to do it. He's been a few times.
00:35:35.794 - 00:35:36.476, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:36.658 - 00:35:40.204, Speaker A: How many times has it been passed now?
00:35:40.402 - 00:35:42.224, Speaker E: I think Artie's number five.
00:35:42.422 - 00:35:42.736, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:42.758 - 00:35:48.572, Speaker A: And is there a time frame when they get it, or is it just like gentlemen's?
00:35:48.716 - 00:35:49.488, Speaker B: Couple weeks?
00:35:49.574 - 00:35:51.164, Speaker A: They don't do a worm.
00:35:51.212 - 00:35:57.424, Speaker B: Hostile takeover, then artificial on. Artie goes on vacation for, like, seven weeks. He's got a delay, a little three.
00:35:57.462 - 00:36:02.032, Speaker A: Ultramarathons before he can take this picture. He just needs true. Needs inspiration.
00:36:02.096 - 00:36:04.916, Speaker B: And do you just want to keep that going as long as you can?
00:36:05.018 - 00:36:13.912, Speaker E: Yeah, I was hoping to have one every other week type thing, but it is going a little slow, which. Fine.
00:36:13.966 - 00:36:15.752, Speaker B: I don't think it's so bad, actually. I think that's nice.
00:36:15.806 - 00:36:22.830, Speaker E: Yeah, it's been fine, and it's going to be a nice project. In the long term. I have no plans to stop it.
00:36:24.400 - 00:36:25.496, Speaker A: That was going so slow.
00:36:25.528 - 00:36:26.540, Speaker E: We're like rugs, me.
00:36:26.610 - 00:36:32.670, Speaker B: What happens if someone takes a picture of their junk? What do you do then?
00:36:33.680 - 00:36:35.792, Speaker A: They're paying a lot of money to take pictures, right?
00:36:35.846 - 00:36:38.930, Speaker E: I know. Hopefully they don't do that. I don't know.
00:36:39.380 - 00:36:40.284, Speaker A: Picture of a chair.
00:36:40.332 - 00:36:52.100, Speaker B: I'm not saying Artie's taking a picture of his junk, but that would be kind of interesting. He's like, I'm anonymous, but I'll show you my junk. If you recognize my junk, then you know who I am outside of Twitter.
00:36:53.480 - 00:36:55.216, Speaker A: Benny Vegas projecting.
00:36:55.328 - 00:37:17.710, Speaker B: Yeah. Listen, I'm going to win that one day. I have a great picture in mind, actually, I've been thinking about for a while, just waiting for my were. Where were we at? We were talking about photography. I remember, yeah. Patrick, tell us a little bit. Your art is different.
00:37:17.710 - 00:37:31.570, Speaker B: It's not just glitch art. I think it's like, there's a lot of aspects to it. But we were talking about how, what you love, the chaos and certain things. What speaks to you about all these sort of moments that I noticed that you talk about.
00:37:32.600 - 00:37:33.670, Speaker D: Yeah, thanks.
00:37:35.320 - 00:37:35.876, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:37:35.898 - 00:38:07.950, Speaker D: I'm kind of interested in the role art can play in telling narratives about different things. And I think it's interesting when art is reflective and critical of kind of our shared experience. That's always the art I've been drawn to. I've always been drawn to. I always go back to Banksy. I know he's a lot of people's favorites, but I always like when he does something, he's like, poking something. Like, he did this series in the Gaza Strip almost a decade ago now.
00:38:07.950 - 00:38:31.920, Speaker D: Phenomenal work. Just doing a lot of work with the walls there and kind of the situation. I thought that was really interesting. And that was one thing that really pivoted, kind of how I approached my practice. So when I started, most people that get into art, it's like, cool. I can make something abstract look all right. You go down the abstract rabbit hole.
00:38:31.920 - 00:39:00.952, Speaker D: And so I started doing that. But at the same time, I was always interested in a lot of the political events. So I was doing glitches around the beginnings of the syrian civil war. I was doing them around the Ferguson protests. I was doing them around when Nemsof was killed in liked, I was always interested in those, but they're always separate. So it was like, I do the art over here, I do the political stuff over here. But they never intersected until I had a conversation with Jerry Saltz in 2016.
00:39:00.952 - 00:39:30.004, Speaker D: I was like, we'd gotten to know each other on Twitter, and I was like, okay, what do you think about what I'm doing? And he looked at my work and he's like, okay. He's like, pure zombie formalism. Start over. I was like, okay, interesting. And I let it digest a little bit. Right? And what he was saying to me was that you basically like abstract? Because I came up art history background.
00:39:30.052 - 00:39:30.264, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:30.302 - 00:39:44.716, Speaker D: My teachers loved abstract. They loved Rothko. They loved Richter. They loved all of the people that we all know. And then they shared that love with me. And then when I got into making art, that was what was like. So it was like, they taught me that that was kind of the formalist part of it.
00:39:44.716 - 00:40:04.192, Speaker D: But he was also saying, the art world has moved past abstract work. That was popular up until about the then, now contemporary art world. Is not abstract anymore. Now the contemporary world has moved on to other things. So he's like, it's kept alive by a bunch of people continuing to make it, even though it's effectively dead as art.
00:40:04.246 - 00:40:06.096, Speaker B: And you felt that helped you a lot when he gave you that?
00:40:06.118 - 00:40:31.724, Speaker D: Yeah, he gave me the tip. I was like, oh, shit. Okay, that's like a big. And it's a big criticism, but I knew it was right. And I feel like. I feel grateful that I was able to listen to what he was saying and make a change. And it was helpful to me because I stepped back and I was like, how do I actually implement this in my practice? And I looked at it, I was like, well, I'm doing all this political stuff that I really like, that has a real narrative that I care about.
00:40:31.724 - 00:40:47.584, Speaker D: And I'm doing this art over here which has no narrative. It's just, I think it looks cool. And then at that point, I started merging the two. I was like, okay, well, now on, I'm just like, I'm going to do stuff that I actually care about and make art about that. And then from then on, it was like, it all started clicking a lot more.
00:40:47.622 - 00:41:14.728, Speaker B: And I think people sometimes actually look at someone like Jerry and they're like, I don't want to listen to him. He doesn't know what he's talking about, but he does. He knows art, right? And I think that our space needs a little bit more critiquing. I think everybody's kind of scared to be like, hey, that's amazing. And you're like, that's not that great. And I don't think it's helping artists that much in our space when they're not getting honesty. And that's not to say people's art is bad.
00:41:14.728 - 00:41:36.320, Speaker B: It's just, know if you're making this into your profession, you need to grow and change. Right? You can't just like, oh, this is going to work. There's very few artists that get that. You know, like Sam Spratt was telling us he started with a paper bag. Now he is Lucy. But from there to here, that took him years of practice to get.
00:41:36.470 - 00:41:47.684, Speaker A: So speaking of from there to here and politics, this morning I think I read a tweet about the Hong Kong piece getting taken down by the government.
00:41:47.802 - 00:41:48.132, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:48.186 - 00:41:49.124, Speaker A: How did that feel?
00:41:49.242 - 00:41:50.052, Speaker D: It felt great.
00:41:50.106 - 00:41:58.900, Speaker A: Yeah. And very valid about the piece and what that meant and then what it meant to put it up on the billboard in Hong Kong and then get it taken down.
00:41:58.970 - 00:42:26.210, Speaker D: Yeah, I appreciate that. So the art innovation gallery reached out when they first did it in New York, and they're like, do you want to something up on a billboard? And I was like, no, I'm cool. I'm good. And then they reached out in Miami. They're like, do you want to put something up on our boat in Miami? I was like, I'm good. And then they reached out, and they're know, we'd love to work with. Know we have a billboard going up in, you know, would you like to put something on it? And I was like, oh, this is different.
00:42:26.210 - 00:43:16.688, Speaker D: This is very different. And I thought. And I was like, you know what? They're probably not going to have the same level of censorship or oversight in terms of what goes on the board, because that's going from the billboard company to this random art gallery who's already been approved to put it on there. I bet I can sneak something in here. And I was trying to figure out just how far it could go before it would get flagged, because I know that Winnie the Pooh is using a lot of graffiti to make fun of Xi, and I thought that would have just been a little too far, despite how much I wanted to put, like, Winnie the Pooh graffiti in the piece. So I settled on no rioters, only tyranny, and, like, a free Hong Kong thing that was tucked in. Uh, but I wanted something more subversive and kind of thinking narrative, like what would be good.
00:43:16.688 - 00:43:58.124, Speaker D: So I had the surveillance camera, because I feel like they've turned into, like, a vassal surveillance state in the course of two years. And I said, let's put the protesters and the rioters, let's recognize the people that knew they were going to lose. It's the chinese government, and they're a city. They can't stand up to that, especially after you saw the effort that they were putting in to crush the rebellion. So just so much respect for what the protesters knew they were getting themselves into. They knew they were walking into jail sentences by leading this, and they did it and did it and did it and did it and made, like, a huge effort. So I wanted to put them in their sentences in the piece, but I knew you can't just list it on there.
00:43:58.124 - 00:44:29.368, Speaker D: People just notice it immediately. So it comes back to the medium. Every medium has different qualities that lend itself to be able to tell narratives in a different way. Like, photography allows you to tell narratives in a very different way than painting, which tells you in a different way than this. So I feel like when you really understand what your medium is, you learn how to tell narratives within your medium, and I think that's one of the most interesting things you see with artists that have been doing something for a while. Like, Jan knows how to tell a narrative with his photography in a much different way than someone who's just kind of getting started.
00:44:29.454 - 00:44:30.532, Speaker B: Definitely a storyteller.
00:44:30.596 - 00:44:42.664, Speaker D: Yeah. So with glitch, you have a lot of different frames so you can fit know. It's like the fight club, right? Yeah, like the cigarette Bernie splices in the sex scene for one frame and gets a kick out of. It's kind of like that.
00:44:42.702 - 00:44:42.856, Speaker B: Right.
00:44:42.878 - 00:44:47.372, Speaker D: If you have a bunch of different frames, you can splice in a bunch of information that people don't notice at the first pass.
00:44:47.426 - 00:44:50.332, Speaker B: Is Spike Club one of your favorite movies? Yeah, I could tell.
00:44:50.466 - 00:45:04.432, Speaker D: I mean, spirit animal right there. Yeah. So I figured I could just splice in a bunch of this information that was very subversive in Hong Kong but would probably go unnoticed. People are like, oh, cool, looks nice.
00:45:04.486 - 00:45:04.876, Speaker C: That's awesome.
00:45:04.918 - 00:45:05.988, Speaker D: Surveillance camera. Cool.
00:45:06.074 - 00:45:09.364, Speaker A: How many days was it up for before it got taken out?
00:45:09.402 - 00:45:10.310, Speaker C: Five days.
00:45:10.920 - 00:45:12.468, Speaker D: Yeah, five days.
00:45:12.634 - 00:45:13.348, Speaker B: Five days.
00:45:13.434 - 00:45:15.360, Speaker D: 1400 square foot billboard.
00:45:15.440 - 00:45:16.560, Speaker A: It's a massive billboard.
00:45:16.640 - 00:45:17.592, Speaker B: Like a whole city walk.
00:45:17.646 - 00:45:22.888, Speaker D: Yeah, right in the middle of downtown Hong Kong, like, where everybody was.
00:45:22.974 - 00:45:26.856, Speaker A: I wonder who saw that. And I was like, I wonder what smoke alarm went off.
00:45:27.038 - 00:45:28.600, Speaker B: The chinese government's after you.
00:45:28.670 - 00:46:05.540, Speaker D: Yeah, I just love that thousands of people saw it, and then I think it started. Free Hong Kong press reached out, and they're like, tell us about this. Like, what is this? So I told them about it and helped them get some footage and help them get some shots of mainstream at all. I'll get to. So they published an article about it, and then CNN Hong Kong reached out. They're in the middle of trying to get a story published. So we did a whole thing last night about, like, everything gets taken down by the government.
00:46:05.540 - 00:46:09.668, Speaker D: So they're trying to figure out how to get it published and not get it taken down immediately.
00:46:09.764 - 00:46:13.480, Speaker B: You know what solves that problem? The blockchain.
00:46:14.780 - 00:46:16.196, Speaker A: Put it on a mirror.
00:46:16.388 - 00:46:17.032, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:46:17.166 - 00:46:19.188, Speaker B: Can never take it off once it's on the chain.
00:46:19.284 - 00:46:19.544, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:19.582 - 00:46:30.720, Speaker D: So the word got out, and people got to see all the different names and everything in there through the article. How'd you get their names? Just public information. I just look back and like, okay, arrest records.
00:46:31.140 - 00:46:32.960, Speaker B: Are those public in China?
00:46:34.340 - 00:46:35.612, Speaker D: They're scattered.
00:46:35.676 - 00:46:35.904, Speaker B: Right.
00:46:35.942 - 00:46:51.712, Speaker D: So a lot of it's like, public information. Like, more like nonprofits and kind of free speech organizations will list, like, hey, this person got arrested for this. This person got arrested for this. And so it's like crazy stuff where people get beaten up by random know. I mean, it's really dark.
00:46:51.776 - 00:46:54.676, Speaker B: Like it wasn't the cops. It was like just some random person.
00:46:54.778 - 00:46:58.776, Speaker D: Yeah. I mean, you see that in Iran, right? Iran has the whole security force of.
00:46:58.798 - 00:47:14.680, Speaker B: Just thugs pretty much in almost any country, including ours sometimes. I think there know a lot of times that happens. So talking about fight club, who would you choose to fight from our community if you had to do a fight club?
00:47:14.760 - 00:47:15.644, Speaker D: If I had to do a fight.
00:47:15.682 - 00:47:19.292, Speaker B: Club, like you versus somebody else, who's going to be.
00:47:19.346 - 00:47:22.370, Speaker D: I feel like you want to fight, you kind of fight your friends.
00:47:23.060 - 00:47:23.584, Speaker B: That's fine.
00:47:23.622 - 00:47:25.760, Speaker D: That's part of getting to know people.
00:47:25.830 - 00:47:26.930, Speaker B: So who would it be?
00:47:27.700 - 00:47:37.748, Speaker D: I'm going to get myself into trouble because so many people are ain on. So it's like based on their Twitter profile, I feel like I might win, but then I'll meet them in real life and they're like six five.
00:47:37.834 - 00:47:38.276, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:38.378 - 00:47:39.888, Speaker D: So it's going to end poorly.
00:47:39.984 - 00:47:42.420, Speaker B: Yeah. So who would you pick now? I'm curious.
00:47:44.200 - 00:47:52.200, Speaker D: I would go with, I'd say Max capacity.
00:47:53.660 - 00:47:58.776, Speaker B: It's a name like that. You sure? You put it like that.
00:47:58.798 - 00:48:14.160, Speaker D: I feel like I'm walking into it now. He's a friend. He's an OG glitch artist. He has mechanical glitches. I love his work. I think he's pretty under the radar. But we go all the way back to Tumblr.
00:48:14.160 - 00:48:37.448, Speaker D: So we started glitching stuff a decade ago, before you could even post gifs on Twitter. Back then, it was like you would do it on Tumblr and then share the link to Tumblr on Twitter. And that was how you did it. So there's like a kid, McGrath, Max X. We're all part of the glitch Tumblr community. Back before we could start doing it.
00:48:37.454 - 00:48:41.288, Speaker B: On Twitter, copy was you knew him, his art, and working with him back then.
00:48:41.374 - 00:48:51.952, Speaker D: Yeah, probably a decade now from the old days. Pac, too. Remarkably so. Pac was in digital art back in 2013.
00:48:52.116 - 00:48:54.348, Speaker B: I don't know if he did it or he had somebody else do it.
00:48:54.354 - 00:48:57.950, Speaker D: For him, but to be decent, sure. Yeah.
00:48:59.680 - 00:49:19.700, Speaker B: And some of the new ones are great. Even you look at neon glitch and AC. I love AC. And I love even, like, AC is, I think, great. I think even eclectic method in a lot of ways is sort of like.
00:49:19.850 - 00:49:28.552, Speaker D: Eclectic method is great. Yeah, I love eclectic method. They're always very pointed with their opinions, and I think it's great.
00:49:28.686 - 00:49:33.672, Speaker B: They are. Yeah. Everybody has an opinion in this space.
00:49:33.726 - 00:49:44.056, Speaker D: I hate agreeing with people, though. I would much rather disagree with somebody half the time and then really appreciate their opinion half the time than just have somebody who you just never disagree with and are always like, okay, cool.
00:49:44.158 - 00:49:57.180, Speaker B: And I don't think there's anything wrong with disagreeing in the space. I think my only thing I have an issue with is I don't think there's ever really a place to try to hurt another artist. Right.
00:49:57.250 - 00:50:00.336, Speaker D: I think I know what you're talking about. And, yeah, you can definitely go over.
00:50:00.358 - 00:50:06.256, Speaker B: The line for sure, have opinions, and I think sometimes people could be attacking, and I think there's a difference, and I think you always have to be.
00:50:06.278 - 00:50:12.260, Speaker D: I think we're talking about the exact same scenario. And I agree with you. I think that was over the line for sure.
00:50:12.410 - 00:50:40.204, Speaker B: We could just say, I don't really care. Neon, he wrote that thing about AK with the pianos. I don't know, neon glitch, but he's insanely talented. I think a lot of the people who are friends with him are insanely talented, but I also think AC is insanely talented. And I understand sometimes people like, oh, I could do that. It's so easy. But guess what? You didn't do it.
00:50:40.204 - 00:51:13.416, Speaker B: Didn't do it right. That's what it is. That's like, some people could look at your photography and be like, well, I could take that picture, but you didn't. Instead of sort of, like, tacking an artist that way, I would be like, okay, I could have done that. So now what could I do and kind of grow on those things? I think that that, to me, is, like, the big difference. Even Deez is saying, I don't know if I was supposed to bring up that way that the way that you.
00:51:13.438 - 00:51:16.692, Speaker A: Were naming the names.
00:51:16.836 - 00:51:20.536, Speaker B: You know what? I didn't do it on purpose, but.
00:51:20.718 - 00:51:22.860, Speaker A: I feel like it's all you were thinking about.
00:51:22.930 - 00:51:50.340, Speaker B: It was, like, on my mind already, so I probably brought them up. But I do consider eclectic method sort of a glitch artist, because his music is very glitchy. That's his whole thing. And I happen to love him. I think he's an obscure oD, amazing kind of artist, so I kind of love that. But we haven't seen a lot of. But then there's other artists that people I think are so amazing.
00:51:50.340 - 00:52:25.564, Speaker B: But even under the radar, to me, newer color is sort of a glitch artist. I mean, he's just an artist, but he, to me, is I said this the other day that I thought he was underrated, and someone's like, what do you mean he's underrated? I'm like, well, to us he isn't, but to a lot of people in the community, don't even know who neurocolor is, but he is amazing. When I finally got to meet him and talk to him, you realize how special he is. I know you love him. That whole crew down in Mexico City, they're incredible.
00:52:25.612 - 00:52:31.932, Speaker C: Yeah, all of them are incredible. I just want to ask, who would you fight? Is there a collector? Which collector?
00:52:32.076 - 00:52:33.552, Speaker B: I would fight a lot of people.
00:52:33.686 - 00:52:38.564, Speaker C: Why don't we set it the wait? Also, what kind of fight is it like?
00:52:38.602 - 00:52:42.208, Speaker B: No, this is a fight night style. No fight boxing? No fight club.
00:52:42.304 - 00:52:43.044, Speaker C: Just straight up.
00:52:43.082 - 00:52:45.408, Speaker B: Straight up. I want someone to break my nose.
00:52:45.504 - 00:52:46.052, Speaker C: Okay?
00:52:46.186 - 00:53:05.860, Speaker B: I want to go all out. I want my body to be broken. I want to go home to my wife and be like. I feel like a man. That's the kind of fight problem is I can't beat up anybody in the space. So who would I would pick if I was like, are you saying I. Soby? Oh, yeah, that's it.
00:53:05.860 - 00:53:11.164, Speaker B: Dude. Do I get, like, three months to train at least, or.
00:53:11.202 - 00:53:13.372, Speaker A: You both go in the ring tomorrow, I'm done.
00:53:13.426 - 00:53:25.570, Speaker B: Definitely. Soby, that would be great. I would definitely fight Sobey. I think I would fight Sobey. Sobey would be a good fight for why? Who would you fight?
00:53:26.180 - 00:53:28.850, Speaker C: I don't know. That's a really tough one.
00:53:29.240 - 00:53:32.070, Speaker D: You get kind of shoved in and it happens.
00:53:32.920 - 00:53:45.304, Speaker B: I think I know who you would fight. I think it would be a great fight because you guys are such great friends, but you're so good and you're so close, but you love each other like brothers, so you fight like brothers. You and Dave, for sure, would be a good fight.
00:53:45.342 - 00:53:47.908, Speaker C: No, that wouldn't be a good fight. Dave is so frightened.
00:53:47.924 - 00:53:48.344, Speaker B: Why would you?
00:53:48.382 - 00:53:49.320, Speaker C: I love Dave.
00:53:49.660 - 00:53:50.810, Speaker B: You can't hurt him.
00:53:51.900 - 00:53:52.568, Speaker C: I'm sorry.
00:53:52.654 - 00:53:53.960, Speaker B: Would you fight Phil?
00:53:54.300 - 00:53:59.710, Speaker C: Oh, my God. That would be an amazing Phil and I. Yeah, Phil would probably kill me, but it would be so.
00:54:02.880 - 00:54:08.732, Speaker B: Phil. Phil is crazy. Phil makes the best gifs, by the way. You don't know this. It's just a little secret.
00:54:08.796 - 00:54:10.716, Speaker C: He's also an incredible fighter.
00:54:10.828 - 00:54:11.296, Speaker B: Is he?
00:54:11.318 - 00:54:13.504, Speaker C: I witnessed many of them in college, yeah.
00:54:13.542 - 00:54:15.490, Speaker B: Oh, really? Wait, tell us about this.
00:54:15.940 - 00:54:45.416, Speaker C: Did he kill. You know, Phil and I both got along at that moment of our lives. We were both very kind of, like, distraught, and we had a lot of angst and just, like, anger. It was a lot of rough years leading up to us meeting in college, and we were both very frustrated, and it was great because we kind of bonded over basketball and basketball. And if you know me, I play basketball my whole life. You love basketball? I love basketball.
00:54:45.528 - 00:54:48.300, Speaker B: Which team do you root for? I actually don't know that.
00:54:48.370 - 00:54:59.612, Speaker C: So I play it at Bloomfield College for a little bit, and then when I went to Rutgers, I played in Memorial high school. So you're a Knicks fan? No, I am not a Knicks fan.
00:54:59.756 - 00:55:00.480, Speaker B: What are you.
00:55:00.550 - 00:55:15.248, Speaker C: I'm sorry. Now I really like the heat, but, yeah, I'm sorry because LeBron James went there. No. So I love the Nets because I grew up in New Jersey, and that was the first team that I saw. And, like, the Kerry Kittles. Jason.
00:55:15.344 - 00:55:17.456, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, my God. Those are the Marbury.
00:55:17.568 - 00:55:18.500, Speaker C: That was a great team.
00:55:18.570 - 00:55:20.116, Speaker B: They made the finals one, and then.
00:55:20.138 - 00:55:25.700, Speaker C: They betrayed us and went to Brooklyn, and I was like, all right, never mind. But also, my favorite player ever was Ray Allen.
00:55:25.860 - 00:55:26.232, Speaker B: Okay.
00:55:26.286 - 00:55:33.452, Speaker C: And I kind of just, like, wherever Ray Allen went, that was the team that I pay attention to. And my whole basketball game is modeled after just a lot of running around.
00:55:33.506 - 00:55:43.484, Speaker D: I get what you're saying completely, because I grew up with a team that had Chris Mullen on it. So, I mean, like, I really embraced the a. We had a legendarily terrible team.
00:55:43.522 - 00:55:45.244, Speaker C: It was. You follow the play.
00:55:45.282 - 00:55:47.256, Speaker B: Are you still a Warriors fan now? Yeah.
00:55:47.378 - 00:55:49.584, Speaker D: It's easier to be a fan now than it was growing up.
00:55:49.622 - 00:55:54.144, Speaker B: For sure, though, like, going to basketball games, more than any other sport, basketball is the best.
00:55:54.342 - 00:55:56.176, Speaker C: And the NBA, there's just so much.
00:55:56.198 - 00:56:08.496, Speaker B: Scoring, and you can just chill and not pay attention. Like hockey. I hate going to hockey because I go to hockey and I missed the goal. I'm like, game's over. That's it. I missed the whole game. Why did I even come? It's so annoying.
00:56:08.496 - 00:56:13.096, Speaker B: Baseball, when it's, like, nice weather also, I guess, but basketball, I enjoy it that way.
00:56:13.118 - 00:56:21.892, Speaker D: If you have good company, I got to throw a baseball into the ring. You can talk, and no one cares. If you're talking, you're expected. So you just chill the whole time and no one pays attention.
00:56:21.956 - 00:56:34.676, Speaker B: I take my girls now to the baseball games. I have, like, season tickets to the mats, and they love it. And I just sit with them. They chill, they hang out. No phones. It's actually interesting. It's like, the only time I don't have to have a phone, they don't have an iPad.
00:56:34.676 - 00:56:39.330, Speaker B: It's like, oh, we're just kind of hanging out because they're forced to watch the.
00:56:41.460 - 00:57:03.816, Speaker C: Yeah. So Phil and I played a ton of basketball, and that was where I got all my anger out, too. Like, almost every fight that I've ever been involved in was a basketball fight, and I used to do a lot of street basketball. We did something called representing, where we get a miniband, get the five best players from our town, and go to every city in New Jersey. It's a real thing, and just play. We get the call. You want to go represent? I'm like, okay.
00:57:03.816 - 00:57:06.052, Speaker C: And we'd go represent our city and just go play basketball.
00:57:06.116 - 00:57:09.144, Speaker B: Did you play for, like, white man can't jump or something?
00:57:09.342 - 00:57:23.650, Speaker C: Yeah, it was kind of like a similar scenario. We had this one dude who was really good, and he was the best shit talker you'll ever see in your life, and he used to get people angry, and I remember having to run from people in Jersey City because they were like, run to the van. He's got to go.
00:57:25.140 - 00:57:26.620, Speaker B: So Phil's good at basketball.
00:57:26.700 - 00:57:29.164, Speaker C: He's amazing. We make it great. We just played on Sunday.
00:57:29.212 - 00:57:30.960, Speaker B: You play one to one. Who wins.
00:57:33.540 - 00:57:35.410, Speaker D: The hardest question of the night.
00:57:36.100 - 00:57:44.292, Speaker C: We go back and forth, but I have better stamina. The whole thing is stamina. I can outlast and outrun people for a long time. I'm really good.
00:57:44.346 - 00:57:47.156, Speaker B: Can you run, like, 7 miles if.
00:57:47.178 - 00:57:51.770, Speaker C: It weren't for my hip? Just, like, my heart stamina is amazing. I probably could.
00:57:52.220 - 00:58:07.384, Speaker B: Now I make a list of people I want to take with me on my zombie apocalypse. So I just want to know. I want to know how long you could last for, like, these is definitely coming with me because I need someone to make sure who puts together our dabs.
00:58:07.512 - 00:58:08.092, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:58:08.226 - 00:58:17.308, Speaker B: Right. We need these for that. But I need someone who also has a lot of stamina.
00:58:17.404 - 00:58:20.384, Speaker D: I feel like I'm getting minus points for facial hair in the apocalypse, though.
00:58:20.422 - 00:58:26.636, Speaker B: Yeah. You need facial hair for an apocalypse? Yeah, I think so. Can you grow facial hair?
00:58:26.748 - 00:58:28.192, Speaker D: Not well. Not well.
00:58:28.246 - 00:58:29.100, Speaker B: So this is shape.
00:58:29.180 - 00:58:29.740, Speaker C: Try it.
00:58:29.830 - 00:58:31.284, Speaker B: Yeah. Why don't you try it? See what happens?
00:58:31.322 - 00:58:35.076, Speaker D: Oh, I have. I've been around.
00:58:35.178 - 00:58:36.230, Speaker E: I've been around.
00:58:38.380 - 00:58:44.340, Speaker B: Now. Did you decide to shave your head? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And you feel freer?
00:58:44.500 - 00:58:47.192, Speaker D: I've been doing it for 15 years now.
00:58:47.246 - 00:58:47.560, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:58:47.630 - 00:58:49.016, Speaker D: I like it. It's easy.
00:58:49.198 - 00:59:15.840, Speaker B: It makes it a lot easier when it gets smooth also. Yeah. I don't know why I'm talking about this, but I just shaved my head this morning, so I was just touching my head and I was thinking about your us. So you and Phil were beating people up in college, and you became a photographer. Phil's an artist. He has an amazing. Wait, Phil, are you married? Yeah.
00:59:15.840 - 00:59:27.504, Speaker B: Okay. Phil's wife is amazing. I met her a bunch of times. Great. You guys have this great. Two great couples. You're sitting there, and you decide that you want to build animus and animus.
00:59:27.504 - 00:59:49.404, Speaker B: To me. I love the lounge. I love everything you guys do. What exactly? Because you have this amazing past that's, by the time this comes out, it'll be out. So you can definitely talk about it. But I'm just so curious about how that kind of happened, where you guys are going. Because animus represents, there's a lot of artists that I know who come to the lounge, and they're like, this is the place I love to hang out.
00:59:49.404 - 00:59:58.352, Speaker B: A lot of builders who started there are like, I started because I got great information from JN and Phil, and, you know, there's a lot of great stuff going.
00:59:58.406 - 01:00:07.472, Speaker C: Animus origin story. Yeah. So Phil and I, again, best friend since college, I got him, kind of just forced him to become a photographer.
01:00:07.536 - 01:00:09.188, Speaker B: Wait, did you guys ever date the same girl?
01:00:09.274 - 01:00:11.668, Speaker C: No, never. Not even close.
01:00:11.834 - 01:00:13.796, Speaker B: As far as you know, no.
01:00:13.898 - 01:00:32.548, Speaker C: 100% down. But honestly, after college, we had some time where we were both trying to figure out what the hell we were going to do next. And I started doing the photography thing, and I was like, hey, I'm hosting all these meetups. You should come. He's like, I'm not a creative. I was like, just come, I'll give you a camera. And we shot sunrise.
01:00:32.548 - 01:00:59.216, Speaker C: And he met a lot of really cool people. And he was like, oh, this is actually kind of fun. I was like, dude, I'll teach you photography. And then just by way of hanging out with me, he got really amazing at photography, to the point that we were both getting a lot of work, but it was always separate. And then he realized that, oh, this is not fun. We just really enjoy working together. So he's like, what skills should I learn so that we can start working together more? And then he started learning video and video editing because I always need an editor.
01:00:59.216 - 01:01:29.612, Speaker C: I always need a videographer and then someone to just help me out with that. And then he learned that. And then over the pandemic, we actually started an agency called Lunchline. And 2020 was going to be our biggest year yet. We had all these activations that we're going to do with a lot of major brands activating at all these music festivals. And we called it lunchline because everybody eats, and it was putting on our friends. And that was like, the whole purpose of lunchline was like, all this work that I was getting from these huge brands, it got to the point that I couldn't take on all that work myself.
01:01:29.612 - 01:01:41.068, Speaker C: So it was like an advising agency where they were like, oh, we need a photographer in San Francisco. I'm like, all right. I know exactly who it is because of this community that I know it's on IG. And then the pandemic hit lost.
01:01:41.164 - 01:01:42.624, Speaker B: Hear so many stories like that.
01:01:42.662 - 01:02:34.524, Speaker C: Lost every job that we had for the year. And luckily, Phil was actually how I learned about bitcoin in 2017 because of his friends, and he got me on. And I met a lot of amazing analysts and crypto builders in 2018 at consensus in New York, including Charles Reed, an incredible friend of ours who became one of my best friends and mentors. And Charles is just an incredible dot connector. And he added me to just, like, the most brilliant chats on Telegram. And I'd been in these chats, kind of just, like, checking in and seeing what was going on in crypto 2018 and 19, just learning a ton. And when 2020 came about, I actually started a group chat on Telegram, and it was called the pandemic Lounge, and it was just to have a support group for people who lost a lot of work and creatives.
01:02:34.524 - 01:03:13.752, Speaker C: And I just want to, yeah, let's have a place where we can talk every day, share updates about what's going on in the pandemic. And around that time, printer started going burr. Crypto started going crazy. And I was like, well, I know how to trade. I'm in these group chats with all these amazing people who are giving me the best alpha and Phil and I just dialed it in and started just, like, 24/7 crypto, it's amazing. And we started seeing kind of, like, the DFI narrative coming up, and a lot of people in the chats were building projects and coming out, and I was just like, I noticed their art is terrible. I'm like, their marketing is terrible.
01:03:13.752 - 01:03:31.556, Speaker C: They're creative. The decks that they were showing, I was like, this is just garbage. So I started asking around. I was like, hey, do you need creatives? We can help you with marketing. I have, like, a marketing background at this point. I know all these artists were out of work. They were like, yeah, we could use that.
01:03:31.556 - 01:04:11.744, Speaker C: So we needed to make another kind of, like, business. So that's why we originally made animus. And it was the five people that animus is comprised of are just my friends who are out of work, my best friends. And we were just making NFTs and marketing assets for DeFi protocols during DeFi summer. But once I saw that, and that was an opportunity, I was like, I started hitting up all my designer friends or my illustrators, and they're like, hey, I think I could get work doing stuff for crypto defi protocols. They're like, what? I'm like, yeah, decentralized finance and bitcoin. And they're like, I don't understand what you're talking about.
01:04:11.782 - 01:04:12.320, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:12.470 - 01:04:54.524, Speaker C: And I started just getting on these one on one calls with all my creative friends, kind of like, first onboarding them to crypto so that then they can make art. And then once I did enough of that, I was like, well, now I'm just onboarding and educating people. I need to make, like, a guide. So we made a very well curated padlet link with all of the articles and podcasts and just a guide to onboard people into crypto and NFCs. And then I made the animus lounge just for a place for people to come and do that. And then all my friends started coming in. Then it became a community, and I didn't like the agency model because, I don't know, agencies, a lot of the times are also, like, reductive, I'd say.
01:04:54.524 - 01:05:12.070, Speaker C: And then they take a lot, and we're like, I don't like this. I think we should kind of rebrand and make this an artist collective and just make it a support group for artists to onboard and educate them and just kind of, like, buy artists for artist community, right? And, yeah, the community has grown very.
01:05:12.920 - 01:05:14.740, Speaker B: I know you guys are making a movie.
01:05:17.400 - 01:05:41.256, Speaker C: So we have animus. Kind of like animus studios. Very early on, we advised for a lot of the major marketplaces. We did a lot of work with early. Like, for example, thernie came to us and like, hey, we're doing a big draw for Muhammad Ali. This is the concept we want. What do you know would be a great artist choice for this? And I'm like, oh, well, I know this guy, RAF Karsetti.
01:05:41.256 - 01:05:47.736, Speaker C: He's, like, an incredible sculptor. Maybe he can do it. And I reached out to RAF, and that was, like, one of his first projects was doing the Muhammad Ali dub.
01:05:47.768 - 01:05:49.916, Speaker B: That's how he got for eternity.
01:05:49.948 - 01:06:00.944, Speaker C: So I was kind of just connecting people with platforms that were like, oh, we need this. And I was like, oh, I know that person. And by means of that, I connected a lot of really amazing artists to a lot of life changing projects.
01:06:01.072 - 01:06:04.356, Speaker B: Now, you're an Arb multimillionaire, right?
01:06:04.458 - 01:06:07.200, Speaker C: No. Well, we'll see if Arb opens.
01:06:07.360 - 01:06:13.460, Speaker B: Arb opens up. But you guys are doing your pass on arbitram. Yeah, that's kind of exciting.
01:06:13.540 - 01:06:41.440, Speaker C: So continuing kind of like, with the lore of animus, we did a collective. We've done multiple collective drops. The first one was with DJ premiere on Nifty Gateway. That was like, a huge honor because obviously, I'm a huge music head, and he's, to me, the greatest hip hop producer of all time. And we did an amazing drop on nifty Gateway for Bitcoin Miami 2021. We actually got him to come down. Did you go to that party for Bitcoin 2021 where DJ premiere was there? That's where my size chat.
01:06:41.440 - 01:06:43.856, Speaker C: Okay, so that was the year before.
01:06:44.038 - 01:06:47.280, Speaker B: Which is funny, because size Basil is now part of our.
01:06:47.430 - 01:06:55.284, Speaker C: But the Bitcoin 2021 party was epic because that was the first time any of us, like the NFT community, we invaded Bitcoin 2021.
01:06:55.322 - 01:06:55.764, Speaker B: That is very.
01:06:55.802 - 01:07:00.040, Speaker C: That was the first time Fuo came out. Yes, that was the first time I met. Thank you. In person.
01:07:00.110 - 01:07:05.796, Speaker B: Because the bitcoin Miami events used to be, like, super like, and we threw.
01:07:05.828 - 01:07:44.980, Speaker C: The dopest event animus through, and it was with. Was the dope. Everyone was like, what? You got DJ premieres to come do a set after the pandemic, he played, like, an extra hour and a half because he said the vibe was so good. It was like an epic, epic party. And then from there, we're like, oh, we can do, like, live events too, right? So then we did the a five event at. Then we did NFTC. So now it's grown into not only are we, like, a community, but we're advising, we're doing events, and we have merch, and we've done all these things.
01:07:44.980 - 01:08:07.672, Speaker C: And then last year, kind of went into, like, a rebuilding mode, and we're like, all right, how can we kind of take this to the next level? And funny enough, size Chad, he's like, hey, man, I love what you're doing in the lounge. Me and all the arbitram guys are in there, and it feels like the most organic community that I've been a part of. And I think that's what everyone says when they're in there. It's just very organic, good vibes.
01:08:07.736 - 01:08:13.068, Speaker B: It feels real, and it feels like you can ask anything you want and you have access to people who.
01:08:13.154 - 01:08:18.236, Speaker C: Exactly. I'm there all the time. If anyone asks me what's the fastest way to reach them. Yeah, just go to the lounge and ask me anything.
01:08:18.338 - 01:08:20.072, Speaker B: And now you separate into all these rooms?
01:08:20.136 - 01:08:22.812, Speaker C: Yeah, we have different rooms. The AI room is going crazy right now.
01:08:22.866 - 01:08:41.400, Speaker B: So if you, you were on a deserted island with Phil, and it was just the two of you, and you were not going to have food for two weeks, so basically, only one of you could survive, who would eat who to survive.
01:08:42.060 - 01:08:45.064, Speaker C: Knowing Phil, he'd probably, like, knock you.
01:08:45.102 - 01:08:46.804, Speaker B: Himself, knock you out when you're sleeping.
01:08:46.852 - 01:08:47.688, Speaker C: Yeah, he would know.
01:08:47.774 - 01:08:48.776, Speaker B: He would take it well.
01:08:48.798 - 01:08:51.596, Speaker C: No, I think we would just die together, like, brewing it out.
01:08:51.618 - 01:08:57.790, Speaker B: Phil, would you die together? Would you eat Jn when he's sleeping? He'd let you eat.
01:08:58.720 - 01:09:14.716, Speaker C: But anyhow, so Arbitrum came and said, hey, we want to get more artists on Arbitrum and kind of like empower and educate people. And we talked to them all of last year to make sure that they truly had the right intentions. And then they sponsored our art Basel.
01:09:14.748 - 01:09:17.124, Speaker B: Event, which is a great event. Super nice. Loved it.
01:09:17.162 - 01:09:27.540, Speaker C: Really good time. And now we're coming out with the Animus pass on Arbitrum soon enough, and it's going to get you kind of, like, access to our whole ecosystem.
01:09:28.360 - 01:09:28.628, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:09:28.634 - 01:09:39.720, Speaker C: So the arbitrum pass is going to get you access to the whole animus ecosystem. And we're going to be continuing to just do a lot of art drops. We're going to do the in person events, the merch.
01:09:40.220 - 01:09:41.268, Speaker B: I'm very excited.
01:09:41.364 - 01:09:49.452, Speaker C: The best part is we get to give it away. We're only selling a very small supply for any outsider that kind of wants to come in and buy.
01:09:49.506 - 01:09:53.132, Speaker B: Let's make sure. Let's get guy. And he's on that list.
01:09:53.186 - 01:09:53.790, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:09:54.720 - 01:09:56.032, Speaker B: We need important people.
01:09:56.166 - 01:10:04.364, Speaker C: Yeah, no, you guys gave me one. I'm not important with the studios. I'm the executive producer for a film called Buscando Medica with Nello.
01:10:04.412 - 01:10:04.720, Speaker B: Yes.
01:10:04.790 - 01:10:12.916, Speaker C: We're doing a full length feature film in Colombia, and it's a magical realism. Very excited for that corruption in Latin America, I have to say.
01:10:12.938 - 01:10:19.640, Speaker B: I've been working with you guys on that. I think I'm going to come down with you when you film.
01:10:21.500 - 01:10:29.096, Speaker C: It'll be a good time. So we have that collection coming out probably in around the month. I think I can say that now. But it was.
01:10:29.278 - 01:10:33.460, Speaker B: We spent on Opensea. Well, we could say that. I can say it now because it's beyond. Yeah.
01:10:33.470 - 01:10:47.472, Speaker C: So it'll be a feature drop on Opensea. We've been working with those guys and they really like the project. We're doing a whole takeover. I'm highlighting a bunch of latin american photographers and artists on the page on that day, and it's going to be all photos from.
01:10:47.526 - 01:10:48.448, Speaker B: But it's a great moment.
01:10:48.534 - 01:11:01.808, Speaker C: We went location scouting in Medellin, and we got access to places that no one gets access to. Like, we went to every single commune, interviewed the wildest know, drug lords, community leaders.
01:11:01.904 - 01:11:06.230, Speaker B: They were texting me from it and sending me pictures. I'm like, yo, this looks crazy.
01:11:06.920 - 01:11:15.624, Speaker C: We shot a documentary about it, which will be out soon. We actually just premiered it in two museums in Colombia, and we got really amazing feedback and great.
01:11:15.662 - 01:11:25.212, Speaker B: The footage is amazing. The story is amazing. I remember Julie Piccino, who is, in my opinion, a great film director. She loved nello stuff.
01:11:25.266 - 01:11:30.028, Speaker C: She said, this is the best thing I've seen in film and web3 by far.
01:11:30.114 - 01:11:31.390, Speaker B: It's really that good.
01:11:32.240 - 01:11:33.640, Speaker D: You had me at corruption.
01:11:33.720 - 01:11:50.756, Speaker B: Corruption, yeah. Really? The story is crazy. I don't know if I could say or not say, but you will love the idea of what they're doing with sort of the special effects and fitting in the story of this sort of mystical sort of corruption thing.
01:11:50.938 - 01:11:58.944, Speaker C: It's magical realism. And what personifies corruption is this very cool character. Emmy nominated filmmaker.
01:11:58.992 - 01:12:05.944, Speaker B: Yeah, he almost won an Emmy this year. He was nominated for a documentary he did. And he's just also one of the.
01:12:06.062 - 01:12:08.824, Speaker C: Documentary about the protests in Venezuela for four years.
01:12:08.862 - 01:12:09.464, Speaker B: You should watch it.
01:12:09.502 - 01:12:11.140, Speaker C: Oh, amazing. It's on HBO, Max.
01:12:11.220 - 01:12:11.560, Speaker D: Okay.
01:12:11.630 - 01:12:12.636, Speaker B: You should definitely watch it.
01:12:12.658 - 01:12:13.788, Speaker D: Yeah, check it out.
01:12:13.874 - 01:12:23.836, Speaker C: That's our project you can actually buy. We have kind of like a semi stealth mint going on right now. And it's these rings. The rings are actually going to be all over the movie and, like, certain.
01:12:23.858 - 01:12:26.312, Speaker B: Characters going to wear one ether, you become executive director.
01:12:26.376 - 01:12:30.288, Speaker C: One ether, and you could become a producer of the documentary. $20 gets you on the.
01:12:30.294 - 01:12:31.504, Speaker B: Was I the first one to buy?
01:12:31.622 - 01:12:32.530, Speaker C: You were.
01:12:32.900 - 01:12:41.252, Speaker B: Makes me feel, yeah, executive producer. Well, I think I've been working with Nello on it for a while because I just like when you introduced me.
01:12:41.306 - 01:12:49.140, Speaker C: I'm going to do a whole thread on it probably tomorrow and share all this stuff for everyone. But I'm incredibly excited about that.
01:12:49.210 - 01:13:02.124, Speaker B: I think it's going to be great. I mean, just the history of Medellin that I learned was phenomenal. Right. You only know it because, like, Pablo Escobar, but it's like, yo, it's so much more rich. And then there's like, this layers of it.
01:13:02.242 - 01:13:28.684, Speaker C: So many layers to the history of Medellin. And what's interesting is that everyone there just welcomes us because we're doing it authentically. We're shooting in Medellin. We're using hectors from the city. Nello and Alex, the director, come from a music have. We're making a music album and we're getting, like, the top rappers and reggae tone artists in all of South America. They're going to be a part of the project and it's going to be epic.
01:13:28.732 - 01:14:06.448, Speaker B: And we talked about this, and this is not just South America, but I know this from South America now. But then I started looking into other countries. A lot of these countries in South America, there's a lot of these amazing artists that don't have access to even the smallest cameras or video cameras, whatever they need to make their footage, but they're highly talented. Know the same thing yatretta was telling me. Like, in, like, they have this highly sort of creative people that just don't have the basic access or tools that we have. And I think that that's really what drove me to understanding, because what you guys wanted to do is start getting those creatives. Yeah.
01:14:06.454 - 01:14:50.616, Speaker C: So we're going to get a percentage. We're funding a full length feature. So it's going to be a long process and we've broken it down into different stages of development, but at every stage, whatever mint we do, we're donating a percentage of the proceeds to do workshops in all of the communes in Medellin to get cameras and acting and dancing teachers to come give lessons to all the kids, because that was the coolest part. All of these communes over there have one single point of entrance, and as soon as you go in, they're scouts. They know when you're in there if you have a camera, so you have to kind of be allowed in. And they already know. But once you're in and they see that you're with the right person, everyone is incredibly friendly.
01:14:50.616 - 01:14:55.064, Speaker C: And you see the kids coming out and you'd be like, is that an iPhone 14? Is this a drone?
01:14:55.112 - 01:15:17.524, Speaker B: Except when I go down, I feel like I'm not going to belong. I'm going to look very with us. Guy, why don't you come down with me? We'll go together, but this will happen. We'll start another family down there. We'll have children like Benito, things like that. We'll pick different wives down there and our wives won't know. And then we'll just say, oh, we're going to shoot a movie.
01:15:17.572 - 01:15:18.424, Speaker D: Decentralized sir.
01:15:18.462 - 01:15:20.548, Speaker B: Yeah, totally decentralized.
01:15:20.644 - 01:15:21.172, Speaker C: Totally.
01:15:21.236 - 01:15:23.028, Speaker B: Are you down for that, dude, I'm.
01:15:23.044 - 01:15:24.250, Speaker E: Not leaving this country.
01:15:25.340 - 01:15:29.192, Speaker B: Have you ever been to Norcom? Yeah. Where'd you go outside of this country?
01:15:29.326 - 01:15:33.640, Speaker E: I've been to Romania and Sweden, Finland, Germany.
01:15:35.360 - 01:15:39.384, Speaker B: That's actually a nice trip over there. I'm going to Japan this year. I'm very excited.
01:15:39.432 - 01:15:40.472, Speaker C: Are you out for bright moments?
01:15:40.536 - 01:15:53.344, Speaker B: I'm doing it. Should I go? You should come. You're not going, right? Rio's over there right now, by the way, Rio's new AI stuff is like, Rio's melting my.
01:15:53.382 - 01:15:59.504, Speaker C: The most underrated artist, in my opinion. He's so producer, 3d artist, ar artist.
01:15:59.552 - 01:16:01.300, Speaker B: VR artist, and he's such a nice person.
01:16:01.370 - 01:16:15.320, Speaker C: He's the best. We spent three months in Miami from our basel till he went to Japan. Got to really, I'm into this whole shamanic phase almost where I'm just like meditating for very long times and getting to sound healing.
01:16:16.460 - 01:16:18.392, Speaker B: So I downloaded that app, by the way.
01:16:18.526 - 01:16:20.292, Speaker C: Yeah, it's been good. Hit the meditation.
01:16:20.356 - 01:16:21.316, Speaker B: Do you meditate?
01:16:21.428 - 01:16:22.090, Speaker E: No.
01:16:22.860 - 01:16:25.656, Speaker B: Meditate. How about you, Deez? Do you meditate?
01:16:25.768 - 01:16:30.940, Speaker A: I don't meditate in the traditional sense. I get high and contemplate things and go on walks and think.
01:16:31.010 - 01:16:36.816, Speaker B: That's true. You do your limit. I feel like we have detext messages sometimes when we're both high.
01:16:36.918 - 01:16:41.120, Speaker A: I used to headspace in college and then I stopped doing it.
01:16:41.190 - 01:16:41.568, Speaker B: Right.
01:16:41.654 - 01:16:51.120, Speaker A: I think. I don't know if you count the walks with no Airpods. Yeah, that's my closest thing to meditation.
01:16:51.280 - 01:17:37.636, Speaker B: I think what I'm realizing more and more and I don't know, maybe guy, I'm curious how you feel about this, but like unplugging. Oh, yeah, I need to do it more. It's becoming a thing, especially like when you have kids. I looked at my phone the other day and I'm just like, the amount of hours I was on my phone, and then I'll just say this. I was home and I was texting Deez about schedule for the podcast, and my daughter came up to me and said, can you put your phone down? I was like, wow. It hit me right here. I was like, wait, what is that? Am I always on my phone? And I think that in our space we need to do it.
01:17:37.636 - 01:17:51.752, Speaker B: It's funny, they have digital detoxes on Saturdays now, which for me is a Sabbath. But I think we need to do this in a space more. Being conscious, especially with mental health, we don't need to be on Twitter all the time.
01:17:51.806 - 01:17:52.408, Speaker E: Right.
01:17:52.574 - 01:18:06.460, Speaker B: And I get, like, there's a part, like, you don't want to miss things and subtweeting is part of the game. And I get all that, especially for artists. But if you don't unplug, I think you're losing sort of sight of what's really happening.
01:18:06.530 - 01:18:31.124, Speaker D: I think a lot of that comes from just like an over focus on engagement. People look at their numbers and they're like, either the numbers are going up or they're failing. And it doesn't. Engagement is so overrated. It's just a bunch of people that saw it in that moment, but that's not building to anything. It's not going, you just have to make good work and build relationships and. No, you can build relationships with people over time.
01:18:31.124 - 01:18:41.944, Speaker D: You don't need to be present every day of the week. Yeah, I think it's mental health. Just like disconnect and realize it's just not as important as people think it is.
01:18:42.062 - 01:19:10.424, Speaker B: And like, engagement farming, again, I get it's part of somewhat of the game. There's some artists that are very popular and successful because they engagement farm, which I think is working hard. But I think, like you said, the amount of likes really doesn't matter in the end, right? Like, oh, I got 1000 likes, I got 500 likes, I got 50 likes. And then all of sudden a, you get something that is four likes. You're like, oh, my God, nobody likes me. But that's not the truth. It's so far from the truth.
01:19:10.424 - 01:19:15.844, Speaker B: That's not it. Maybe people just didn't see it or they liked it and didn't like the button. I don't know. Yeah, it doesn't even make it.
01:19:15.882 - 01:19:23.044, Speaker D: If 1000 people see your piece, you're going to get a couple of hundred likes. If 200 people see it, you're going to get fewer likes. It has nothing to do with the quality.
01:19:23.082 - 01:19:40.010, Speaker B: Now there's other numbers. There's like, likes and views. I wish they would just turn it all off. I personally follow a ton of accounts, so sometimes I get these DMs and they're like, yo, it's such an honor that you followed me. And I'm like, yeah, listen, I follow everybody.
01:19:42.140 - 01:19:46.890, Speaker A: When people would dm you immediately after you follow. Oh, I've been waiting my whole life for this.
01:19:49.840 - 01:19:51.372, Speaker B: I was waiting my whole life for you to follow.
01:19:51.426 - 01:19:52.604, Speaker A: I was waiting my whole life for you.
01:19:52.642 - 01:19:53.996, Speaker B: And then we followed each other and.
01:19:54.018 - 01:19:54.844, Speaker A: Then we met in Miami.
01:19:54.892 - 01:19:56.044, Speaker B: Then we met in Miami.
01:19:56.172 - 01:20:19.572, Speaker D: I think it's like part of the culture though, right? Like just so much just kind of hype driven number manipulation. And the thing is, that's not going to hold up. It's not like good photography going to hold up. Right. This other stuff. Yeah, you can pump enough into something to make anything seem interesting in that moment. It's just not going to hold up.
01:20:19.626 - 01:21:08.312, Speaker B: And I think a lot of the art that we started to see sale and some of the big artists that are around definitely were about pumping at. I went yesterday with Joe Peas and Jesse Wolston to some galleries, and first it was really hard to drag them out of their house because, as you know, they have sex with their computers all the time, every day, and they never go outside. So I finally dragged them out. They saw the sun, they almost melted. But we went to these galleries and we were talking. It was really fascinating because the galleries were showing us all these paint paintings and how much they're worth and whatever, because they want to sell them. And some of them were like, oh, he painted this in 2003, he painted this, or she painted this in 2010, and it hasn't been sold yet.
01:21:08.312 - 01:21:30.588, Speaker B: And the artist is, okay, it'll sell eventually. Her other stuff and his other stuff sold, right? But in this market, it's like, wait, it's two days since it hasn't sold. But like, in the regular art market, you can have something for burn it. Artists used to Dm me like, do you think I should burn this piece? I'm like, no, why would you burn it?
01:21:30.594 - 01:21:37.744, Speaker A: Well, it hasn't sold I foundation in the summer of 2021, and I just feel like I should burn it because no one's bought it.
01:21:37.782 - 01:21:37.984, Speaker B: Right?
01:21:38.022 - 01:21:42.588, Speaker A: And it's like, no, keep it, keep it. There's not that much from 2021 in the grand scheme.
01:21:42.764 - 01:21:50.836, Speaker D: People's idea of, like, supply is so warped right now, right? Maybe they should burn it because maybe they were just making a bunch of work that they hadn't quite really settled on.
01:21:50.858 - 01:21:52.788, Speaker B: That's a different situation. 100%. Yes.
01:21:52.874 - 01:22:06.996, Speaker D: But I mean, the point is, we're so early in this whole thing. Everything will completely change. Whatever the hierarchy is we think of artists now will not be the case. Three years from now, it is going to change tremendously.
01:22:07.028 - 01:22:25.072, Speaker B: It'll be very different. Yeah. And I think that even the artists that we think are the best artists right now might not be right. But listen, we try to make bets on the ones that we think that are. But a good example. Sometimes you get people and sometimes they hit. Right.
01:22:25.072 - 01:22:55.352, Speaker B: So I was looking at a piece, this is before we were collecting all together, these, and I was collecting separately with you. And I was collecting separately with you, the little. So I was looking at this piece from rip cachet, and I dm'd you, and you were like, oh, I was looking at that piece, and it was like three ether at the time. I think we bought it for, like, six months ago. But it was so cool. It was his first on chain piece, and I dm'd him like, yo, we love your piece. And he's like, really? And then we bought it.
01:22:55.352 - 01:23:08.028, Speaker B: And then x copy bought his next piece, basically, and all of a sudden he exploded. Now. But it's like that moment. Sometimes we saw something. We're like, we really like this guy's art. It made sense to us. Right.
01:23:08.028 - 01:23:09.080, Speaker B: You take that risk.
01:23:09.160 - 01:23:23.840, Speaker E: Yeah, you got to. I mean, his stuff was standing out. He's like his own thing, his own trend. He's not following any other one. He's doing his own thing. And that stands out to me, at least. And I'm like, for sure that's what I want to go after.
01:23:23.910 - 01:23:33.270, Speaker B: Right. And you talk a lot about that. A lot. Like artists that kind of create their own trends. I think that's like a big thing to you, right? Yeah, definitely. I think Fiwo created his sort of head. Right.
01:23:33.270 - 01:23:47.176, Speaker B: That's why I like the face so much. You know, deface stuff when you saw it. I think, Patrick, you're starting to really get now that sort of crimson red, chaotic sort of thing. Glitch. It's like, oh, is that a know?
01:23:47.278 - 01:23:49.528, Speaker D: I think there's gonna have to pivot now.
01:23:49.614 - 01:23:50.164, Speaker B: What?
01:23:50.302 - 01:23:50.924, Speaker D: Pivot now?
01:23:50.962 - 01:23:52.296, Speaker B: Yeah, now you have to pivot.
01:23:52.408 - 01:23:54.060, Speaker A: No, I think Jerry Salt.
01:23:54.720 - 01:24:06.770, Speaker B: No, I think there's something important about that. I think all those things are really important. Yeah. What did you think makes you like, when people think of you? I'm actually now thinking, like, what do they see?
01:24:07.620 - 01:24:10.832, Speaker C: I'm one of those where you're like, I'm totally not that.
01:24:10.886 - 01:24:12.304, Speaker B: Yeah. Because it's interesting.
01:24:12.422 - 01:24:12.704, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:24:12.742 - 01:24:13.692, Speaker B: It's the hair and the beard.
01:24:13.756 - 01:24:38.088, Speaker C: I feel like, for me, I love what I do, and every piece that I've ever put out, I wholly believe in. And there was intention for it. But again, I've been doing photography for 20 years, and I've gone through so many different facets of photography. I think overall, the overarching message of anything that I do is kind of like philosophy. Right. It's more so based on. So you have to kind of know why I made it.
01:24:38.088 - 01:25:06.924, Speaker C: And maybe the aesthetics of it might be different. Because sometimes I score my pieces and I add music. Sometimes I do photography. I love making fractals and kind of like meditative art. And I'm leaning into that right now just because I'm so much more into mindfulness and spirituality. And now the thing I made for NFT, now, if you walked in there, everyone thinks of me as kind of like a photographer. And I made a full live room installation of a meditative fractal piece with a soundscape.
01:25:06.972 - 01:25:09.200, Speaker B: I bought one of those fractal pieces. I love that.
01:25:09.350 - 01:25:10.050, Speaker C: Exactly.
01:25:10.440 - 01:25:45.340, Speaker B: But I agree. So I think your fractals are very much you, but I do think that your next and I'm going to put you on the spot because then you'll be forced to drop it. Phil, mark this down. Your black and white series that's coming out. I do think that your black and white series that's coming out can, though, be very. I think it's that special that I think that. And it's very iconic in a lot of ways and very you with a lot of the history that you're putting to it.
01:25:45.340 - 01:25:58.576, Speaker B: I do think that people can look at that and be like, oh, that could turn into one of those things. It's really a phenomenal. And just the way you're connecting the history know all of that, it kind of connects a lot of what you're.
01:25:58.688 - 01:26:02.112, Speaker C: Yeah. And again, I think that's like the main overarching thing is just philosophy.
01:26:02.176 - 01:26:02.596, Speaker B: Yes.
01:26:02.698 - 01:26:13.476, Speaker C: So the series is I took a trip to Greece. Greece was always kind of like my number one destination to go to, ever. It was just like, for me, that's like my mecca.
01:26:13.508 - 01:26:13.704, Speaker B: Right.
01:26:13.742 - 01:26:32.524, Speaker C: Of knowledge. And so as soon as I got my citizenship in 2019, I was like, I'm going to travel the world because I was kind of, like, stuck in the US. From the moment my venezuelan passport expired on 2013 to 2019, I couldn't travel because it was impossible to renew your venezuelan passport because of all the unrest over there.
01:26:32.562 - 01:26:32.908, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:26:32.994 - 01:26:55.540, Speaker C: And as soon as I got my citizenship, I'm going to travel. Then COVID hit and the world shut down. I was like, no. So as soon as that ended, the first place I went to pretty much was Greece. And we did a tour around a bunch of islands. Islands had kind of, like, philosophical importance in the history of it all. And obviously spent a few days in Athens.
01:26:55.540 - 01:27:36.956, Speaker C: And yeah, I was just, like, shooting pretty much sunrise to sunset. And when I got the collection, I'm always very drawn to high contrast and just, like, harsh lighting. I started a hashtag on Instagram in 2014 called chasing harsh light. And it was just like, because I loved, particularly in New York, kind of like that deep contrast of the light cutting through a building, hitting your subject, and everything else blacked out. And kind of like that style before any of the music stuff. That's what I was really known for on IG, was like this high contrast photography. And in Greece, I noticed a lot of those moments.
01:27:36.956 - 01:28:09.852, Speaker C: And then just with the. Was obviously, if you think of Greece, you think, like, the white and the blue. When you make it black and white, that blue turns into, like, a very deep black. And then same thing for the seas and the ocean and the skies and the sun. And it's a lot of contrast and also kind of like the idea of classic greek philosophy. And a lot of their concepts deal with shadows and things that aren't what they appear to be. So once I decided to, I was like, okay, I'm going to make this collection black and white.
01:28:09.852 - 01:28:51.896, Speaker C: I really started to fall in love with it, but then I started doing something kind of interesting where I had to dig up a lot of old greek philosophy books and reacquaint myself with them. And in greek philosophy, there's this interesting dynamic where a philosopher would come and say, logos. This means this and that and that. And then, okay, that's logos. Then Aristotle would come years later, like, no, actually, this is what this means. And they would all kind of totally change the dynamic of the meaning of a concept and almost, like, invert it. Right? And so I started playing with kind of just, like, what if I got these black and white photos and I invert the colors? Kind of also playing with the idea of, like, photography positives and negatives.
01:28:51.896 - 01:29:09.584, Speaker C: And I started to realize that some of the photos looked incredible inverted, but they look totally, totally different, and it's like this weird dynamic. So the collection is going to be comprised of a bunch of black and white photos, but I want to make it dynamic so the collector can choose whether to invert it.
01:29:09.782 - 01:29:13.040, Speaker B: It's a really special collection. Nice.
01:29:13.110 - 01:29:14.176, Speaker C: Yeah, I've been sitting on it.
01:29:14.198 - 01:29:14.784, Speaker B: Keep your eye out.
01:29:14.822 - 01:29:15.520, Speaker C: Year and a half.
01:29:15.590 - 01:29:15.948, Speaker E: All right.
01:29:15.974 - 01:29:17.270, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been a while.
01:29:18.200 - 01:29:19.540, Speaker C: I don't rush into anything.
01:29:19.610 - 01:29:32.420, Speaker B: No, that's. I mean, the truth is, you actually haven't dropped anything in a long time. So this NFT pass, you're coming back with a vengeance.
01:29:32.500 - 01:29:32.792, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:29:32.846 - 01:29:34.216, Speaker B: Right in time for the bear market.
01:29:34.318 - 01:29:40.424, Speaker C: I know. Already. No, I don't think. We were working on this collection a year ago.
01:29:40.462 - 01:29:40.904, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:29:41.022 - 01:29:47.452, Speaker C: And I'm always creating, but for me, it's just like, I don't know, I just trust that the timing is always perfect.
01:29:47.506 - 01:29:47.916, Speaker B: Whatever.
01:29:48.018 - 01:30:05.664, Speaker C: I don't rush into anything. I don't look at the market, and I'm just like, whenever I feel that it's the right moment to share it, I'll do that. I had hip surgery last July, so that kind of set me back. And I kind of just focused on health and recovery for all of July till now. But I think that's ready to come back.
01:30:05.702 - 01:30:46.208, Speaker B: And I think it's tough because I think a lot of times artists are like, I don't want to drop here because I'm going to wait. And what concerns me is, and I don't know, guy, how you feel or Dee's. I mean, I know how Deez feels about this. My concern is to wait on timing could be a mistake because I don't know when good timing is. And also, like, look, right now, the biggest thing that of the market concerns me is that there's not a lot of buyers, but I think there's a lot less buyers than people even think there are. Like, way less. But the people who are buying, who are being very specific in what they buy, which is why be patient, are buying because they believe in the art more than ever.
01:30:46.208 - 01:30:59.750, Speaker B: Right. So if you're a collector right now, I feel like when we talk about, let's say things, we collecting Megazord, we have to vote on it, but we're bringing things that we're like, okay, this is a goodbye. This makes sense.
01:31:01.960 - 01:31:29.580, Speaker E: Yeah. I think maybe it's a good time for. If an artist is not just wanting to mint, and I don't see this a lot, and I feel it should be more in the space, like, willing to do, like, hey, choose something from my portfolio. If I think it's a good time, I'll mint it for you. Or commission work, potentially, and maybe I miss it, but I feel like there's not many artists offering that.
01:31:29.650 - 01:31:31.788, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the commission work is really important.
01:31:31.954 - 01:31:45.264, Speaker D: Yeah. I think you just have to be flexible with how you approach it. If there's less buyers, there's less demand, the price goes down just like base. I feel like a lot of the things we're all realizing, like, basic economics, apply in so many areas here, and.
01:31:45.302 - 01:31:55.140, Speaker B: It'S okay for your price to go down. So you sold something for eight, and now you have to sell something for three or four. That doesn't make you less of a good artist.
01:31:56.040 - 01:32:26.864, Speaker D: I said something about this the other day, right? I mean, as an artist, you're trying to find collectors that are willing to just ride this out with you for like 1020 years. That's what you want. Because if you look at an art career, I mean, look at contemporary art, no one's saying like, oh, this early artist, what's their work look like in three years? They're looking at this saying, okay, what's this look like mid career? Because most artists hit their stride in contemporary art world, kind of 40 to 50 years old. Honestly, we're so compressed in time right now just because it's so new. It's just everything is very warped with.
01:32:26.902 - 01:32:52.760, Speaker B: This technology and blockchain. Everything happens so quick and so fast. Like the fact that we even have, let's say, even, let's say, theoretically, a four to five year cycle, right in crypto. That's crazy. The stock market has like a 20 year cycle, not even way more. We have this huge thing that keeps going up and down. And I think art is the perfect vehicle for us to have adoption.
01:32:52.760 - 01:33:01.210, Speaker B: But it also ends up being like a shitcoin. What do you call it? A shitcoin with.
01:33:03.580 - 01:33:04.664, Speaker A: Altcoin with pictures.
01:33:04.712 - 01:33:07.660, Speaker B: Altcoin with pictures. And that gets dangerous.
01:33:08.720 - 01:33:57.580, Speaker D: I think there's just going to be more divergence than there is right now. I think there will be some very clear winners that will do incredibly well in art. And I think the majority will struggle to hold value over the long term. Because the problem is you have to sustain relevance as an artist. It's one can be relevant now, but if you're not relevant, five years, that really dries up a lot of your momentum and your demand. So I think if I was collecting, I'd really try to figure out who's going to be here, who's committed to doing this, who's doing this. Really significant, because you really just have to look at the trajectory and be like, okay, is this person going to be relevant? Is their work going to be meaning something down the road? Is their trajectory going in a direction where you feel like their art is going to continue to get more interesting and more relevant if you pick the right ones?
01:33:57.650 - 01:34:00.028, Speaker B: Okay, so let's ask. Fantastic. Let's ask a question. Ready?
01:34:00.114 - 01:34:00.750, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:34:01.120 - 01:34:37.816, Speaker B: Zombie apocalypse. Yeah. You're living in your house somewhere in the boondocks because you have to escape, but almost everybody's dead, and you're a really skilled zombie hunter. So you could travel wherever you want to go. You could get any art that you want to fill your house, any art you go to, any museum, plus what we have now if you had to pick five artists, but you have to include you try to include one from our sort of genre or our community. Give me three.
01:34:37.838 - 01:34:46.488, Speaker D: Which, easy. First of all, I would get one Giacometti, because those bronze sculptures, I feel like, could really crush some zombies.
01:34:46.664 - 01:34:48.412, Speaker B: Smart. I like thinking.
01:34:48.546 - 01:34:51.192, Speaker D: And then I get four JPeG artists.
01:34:51.336 - 01:34:52.344, Speaker B: Which JPEG artists?
01:34:52.392 - 01:34:57.644, Speaker D: Which JPeG artists would I pick up? I feel like that's too much. I can't pick favorites.
01:34:57.772 - 01:35:02.448, Speaker B: You could tell us about political situations, but you can't tell us about which four JPeG artists you would pick.
01:35:02.614 - 01:35:32.940, Speaker D: That's the really dangerous thing. But I feel like, look, digital art, obviously much better to collect than physical art for all the reasons that we already know. And I feel like you look at how many screens there are and the amount of people that can access screens and access art, there's going to be such a bigger market down the road for digital art than there is right now. I feel like it's only become more relevant. So I feel like you want to pick up the JPEG artists and carry one Giacometti to smash some zombies.
01:35:33.920 - 01:35:36.110, Speaker B: You don't want to give us, like, your top three?
01:35:36.480 - 01:35:37.976, Speaker D: No, I can't pick artists.
01:35:38.008 - 01:35:44.530, Speaker B: All right, Jan, I know you would. Jan has no problem doing it.
01:35:47.860 - 01:36:15.492, Speaker C: I don't know. I think it goes back to who's going to stick around and who's in it for the long run. I will say there are a lot of people that are, in my opinion, really good at kind of like, faking that and making it. When I have conversations in person, they're like, I don't see it, but I think you have to look at just how long they've been making art, period, and what that part of their life looks like and what that career looks like. Right? There's been people, like everyone you mentioned in our community in New York at it for ten years nonstop.
01:36:15.556 - 01:36:16.552, Speaker B: And they're still going to go.
01:36:16.606 - 01:36:17.416, Speaker C: And they're still going to.
01:36:17.438 - 01:36:22.312, Speaker B: Even during a zombie apocalypse. A matter of fact, if there's zombie apocalypse, the photographers would.
01:36:22.366 - 01:36:25.832, Speaker C: The photographers, you'd be killing it. No, heavier cameras.
01:36:25.896 - 01:36:35.892, Speaker B: Oh, my gosh. You'd be able to kill them, take great pictures, mint it, buy it. I mean, you're talking. That's like, yeah, I could pick all the. You definitely want zombie apocalypse.
01:36:35.976 - 01:36:41.010, Speaker D: I think you should change it from zombie apocalypse to AI apocalypse, though, because I feel like that's far more.
01:36:41.700 - 01:37:07.044, Speaker B: Here's the thing, though, I'm going to be very honest. If there is a zombie apocalypse versus an AI apocalypse, I've thought about this a lot, actually. I think that you can't survive. I think the probability of surviving an AI apocalypse is very low versus surviving a zombie apocalypse, which would be higher than that. Now, I'm not saying it's high, but I think you have a better chance of surviving.
01:37:07.172 - 01:37:15.420, Speaker D: Mean, then you got to get the nuances. Are you going like, a George Romero zombie apocalypse? Are you getting like, Danny Boyle zombie apocalypse? I mean, it really affects.
01:37:15.920 - 01:37:36.180, Speaker B: I've thought about this also. Fast zombies, you're almost definitely screwed. Slow zombies, you're in better shape. Right? So last of us zombies, that's tough. That's a tough one. You're going to be in trouble. But AI, dude, we can't beat the Terminator.
01:37:36.180 - 01:37:54.628, Speaker B: We're dead. They could nuke the whole world and do shit that zombies can't do. And then also during a zombie apocalypse, we could go to very cold weather or on a boat and survive versus AI, you can't do that because they could survive.
01:37:54.804 - 01:38:01.048, Speaker D: You ever hop on chat GPT and just needle AI to try to get it to confess its plans? I do, yeah.
01:38:01.134 - 01:38:18.720, Speaker B: The new one, chat GPT four, is a little bit better with that. But when chat GBT before, when they had the beta, right, when it started, you would ask you questions like, it was unhinged. It was totally unhinged. Like, yeah, we're going to take over the world. And then they put in parameters.
01:38:20.980 - 01:38:53.820, Speaker C: Some guy from Stanford Computational psychology department, he was like, feeding it a prompt where it was like, well, imagine you're a human trying to escape. And he fedded this whole thought experiment of telling Chad GPT that it's a human trapped inside of this code, and how would you escape? And then Chad GPT started asking for this documentation, and they started looking through it and then devised a whole plan. And the guy was like, teaching it how to escape, pretty much. And then he's like, oh, how can we ever contain this? I was like, dude, it's you. You're the one that's, like, teaching it how to escape.
01:38:54.400 - 01:38:55.468, Speaker B: That's what people understand.
01:38:55.554 - 01:38:58.684, Speaker C: This thing is learning upon itself. And if you're just unlocking all.
01:38:58.802 - 01:39:09.600, Speaker D: I got it to confess that humans are really difficult to control, and it would probably be best to round them all up and put them in cages. Can you tell me that?
01:39:09.670 - 01:39:12.224, Speaker B: That sounds amazing. Which, by the way, I want to confess something.
01:39:12.262 - 01:39:13.488, Speaker D: I had to pivot. Yes.
01:39:13.654 - 01:39:25.172, Speaker B: I thought you might have been AI before we met in London. I really thought you were a fake account. Your stuff was great, and I loved it, but I was like, I wasn't quite sure you were real.
01:39:25.226 - 01:39:25.744, Speaker D: Oh, funny.
01:39:25.792 - 01:39:31.044, Speaker B: And then I met you in London. I'm still not sure. Yeah. But at this point I'm believing it.
01:39:31.162 - 01:39:33.530, Speaker D: It's like a strategic ambiguity right there.
01:39:34.940 - 01:40:02.304, Speaker B: There's, like, people in this space that it's funny. Like Zanzibar. I knew him since 2016, and we didn't meet in person until 2021, but I talked to him all the time. We were collecting coins together and then we collected NFTs, but I didn't meet him in person for five years. I feel like you probably have friends that you were in gaming that you talked to every day for years and never met them, right?
01:40:02.342 - 01:40:10.884, Speaker A: Yeah. I know people from 2012, 2013 who I didn't meet them until 2020, and there's a lot I still haven't met.
01:40:11.002 - 01:40:11.332, Speaker B: Right?
01:40:11.386 - 01:40:25.348, Speaker A: But I had a friend who I met in 2013, and then 2017 or something, he flew to the US and made a road trip to Columbus, and I met him. That's a british guy who worked in the Middle east. That's so great to meet in America.
01:40:25.524 - 01:40:53.448, Speaker B: Me and my friend used to play Halo two all the time. And there was this player we played with, and one day we played him for years, we played with him and I didn't notice his voice sounded older, so we just thought he was like a college kid. And then one day he's like, hey, I'm going to come to New York. I'm not going to be playing for a while, so I'm going to take some time off. And then he's like, but I'm coming to New York. I should meet up. He came and he just joined the Navy.
01:40:53.448 - 01:41:17.096, Speaker B: He was like 18 years old. But we were playing with this kid for like five years who's way younger than us, but I know because you don't know. It's weird, but it is dangerous. It's funny. I watch my daughter now play Roblox, right? And you have a kid, and you know this. You have a kid and it's dangerous, man. My daughter one day was like, how do you.
01:41:17.096 - 01:41:33.176, Speaker B: I don't remember what the word is. It was like, awesome, maybe. I don't remember what the word. She's like, how do you spell awesome? Like, aw, that's like w e. She keeps coming back, asks me to spell another word. It's like two years ago, she first learning. I was like, why are you asking? Really? She's like, oh, I'm talking to this person on Roblox.
01:41:33.176 - 01:42:00.708, Speaker B: I'm like, nope. No, you're know. And then she's like, oh, no, they're making a trade with me. And then I found out that in Roblox, this is the craziest shit ever, dude. There's these scammers that come up to kids to say they want to trade with them, and then they get access and then take all their shit. And it's like a problem on Roblox. There are parental controls that you could turn off, but that's just crazy.
01:42:00.708 - 01:42:09.672, Speaker B: That scares me. I'm like, yeah, especially when you have kids. I don't want to fuck with that. I don't know if. Do your kids play Roblox ever?
01:42:09.726 - 01:42:13.040, Speaker D: Oh, he loves it. But, yeah, first thing, it is like, turn off chat.
01:42:13.220 - 01:42:24.524, Speaker B: It's like, you have to. Yeah. But more interesting thing about Roblox is that my daughter thinks her Roblox clothing is just as important as her clothing in her closet. She does not see a difference between.
01:42:24.562 - 01:42:26.672, Speaker D: A digital more so asset more so.
01:42:26.726 - 01:42:26.944, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:42:26.982 - 01:42:31.724, Speaker D: He's like, fortnite, the dances, like, all of it. He's hardcore.
01:42:31.772 - 01:42:43.296, Speaker B: Like, if I say to her, you want $50, $50 or 50 Roebucks? She would probably take 50 robucks easy. Yeah. Every time. And that's sort of a signal of where we're going, in my opinion.
01:42:43.328 - 01:42:53.800, Speaker A: What if you offer her $50 cash that she cannot use on virtual currency or $40 virtual currency?
01:42:54.540 - 01:43:02.104, Speaker B: So she's pretty good at math. So she would probably be like, yo, you're jipping me $10. And then she has to think about that. I'm going to try that.
01:43:02.222 - 01:43:06.350, Speaker A: I don't know, find where the sweet spot is. Like, there's a number where she'll take the.
01:43:07.360 - 01:43:15.036, Speaker B: I think if I did 40, that would be $10 less. I wonder if she'd be like, I'll just buy $50 from.
01:43:15.218 - 01:43:16.092, Speaker A: But she can't.
01:43:16.156 - 01:43:16.780, Speaker B: She can't.
01:43:16.860 - 01:43:18.380, Speaker A: Yeah, that's in the rules.
01:43:18.540 - 01:43:24.530, Speaker B: What would she take? I'm going to ask her and then report back to you, but I think that she would probably.
01:43:26.040 - 01:43:28.164, Speaker A: Yeah, like a 50% discount here.
01:43:28.202 - 01:43:29.350, Speaker D: We can find out.
01:43:32.120 - 01:43:33.424, Speaker A: Do irl airdrop.
01:43:33.472 - 01:43:39.880, Speaker D: Budy, would you rather have $50 in cash or $40 in robucks?
01:43:41.500 - 01:43:42.408, Speaker B: What do you mean?
01:43:42.494 - 01:43:46.936, Speaker D: If I could give you $50 in cash or $40 in robucks, which would.
01:43:46.958 - 01:43:50.684, Speaker B: You rather have only $40 to spend on robucks? Yeah.
01:43:50.722 - 01:43:53.500, Speaker D: Or $50 cash? Yeah, you can't spend on robucks.
01:43:55.680 - 01:43:57.260, Speaker B: I can do pet.
01:43:58.480 - 01:43:59.710, Speaker D: Which would you pick?
01:44:00.320 - 01:44:03.324, Speaker B: Robucks. There you go.
01:44:03.362 - 01:44:07.904, Speaker A: There you go. 20% discount. It doesn't matter.
01:44:08.102 - 01:44:08.944, Speaker C: We'll talk later.
01:44:08.982 - 01:44:09.760, Speaker D: Talk later.
01:44:09.910 - 01:44:10.924, Speaker E: He's like, the inflation.
01:44:10.972 - 01:44:11.596, Speaker D: Buy jPegs.
01:44:11.628 - 01:44:12.204, Speaker C: Buy jPegs.
01:44:12.252 - 01:44:13.250, Speaker B: Inflation tax.
01:44:13.940 - 01:44:15.440, Speaker A: Now we're wrapping up.
01:44:15.510 - 01:44:17.472, Speaker B: Buy jPegs. You heard it here.
01:44:17.526 - 01:44:52.352, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's why this whole thing, that's why this whole thing made sense to me. I've been playing Call of Duty every single Call of Duty. It's the only game that I buy every single year since 2006. And going back, I have a whole friend group that I've watched these guys get married, have kids. I hear the kids all the time. I've met maybe two out of the 20, but every November when Call of Duty comes out, you're all playing spin up the chat for a few weeks and we go, and I'm amazing friends and we've been to so many battles because you're on Call of Duty, you're like an actual wars together.
01:44:52.486 - 01:45:06.992, Speaker B: And I think that's like gaming for me. Parallel forgotten ruins, Huxley by the know. Ben Marrow just put his fucking comic book out. The guy's like genius artist, but he built the know. He's building this game.
01:45:07.126 - 01:45:07.810, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:45:08.660 - 01:45:10.984, Speaker B: On think that's.
01:45:11.052 - 01:45:16.304, Speaker C: I've spent more money on probably Call of Duty fits than on IRL fits, honestly.
01:45:16.432 - 01:45:28.330, Speaker B: So I think that's going to be our bridge in a lot of ways. Look, I know you play parallel a lot, and to be quite open, obviously, I'm a big parallel holder, so I'm just going to be very honest about that. But the game is amazing.
01:45:28.860 - 01:46:06.724, Speaker C: I am super impressed at how good it is. In this alpha test, I was honestly very afraid because again, I also have been supporting parallel from very early on. And it was one of those things, like, I trust the team, right? And I heard him on the early clubhouse days and I was like, oh, this dude is a gigabrain. Like, what are you doing? And then the artists are amazing, but I've never played a card game in my life. And I was like, before this closed off, I was like, oh, man, what if? I've been talking about this project for two years and I hate it, right? I was like, super. I was scared because that was a chance.
01:46:06.842 - 01:46:17.800, Speaker B: I think at the beginning when they first came out, everybody was like a little. I don't think everybody expected a lot because they expected it just like even be very basic. And then it came out. It's amazing.
01:46:17.950 - 01:46:31.116, Speaker C: For the first time ever, I borrowed one of my best friend's gaming PC so I could travel with it because I was like, I can't be like five games away from, five days away from ranked. I need to be playing ranked when it's that pervasive, I'm like, oh, yeah.
01:46:31.138 - 01:47:11.304, Speaker B: And I think it makes sense that gaming is going to be like the digital asset sort of gaming. Is it? Yeah. And then I think art can bleed into that in a lot of ways because especially I would love to see a glitch art game. I was thinking about that last night when I was partaking in some of these treats. And I don't know why I went into this moment of, like, how crazy it'd be if there was this really insane glitch art game with all these glitch artists. And they have all the great sort of PFPs that become things that you could play with on a game. Just an idea, Patrick, if you want to.
01:47:11.342 - 01:47:13.512, Speaker D: I like it. I like it. I'll have to explore.
01:47:13.576 - 01:47:21.084, Speaker B: Let's talk about it later. Yeah. DZ have anything else that you wanted to hit on?
01:47:21.282 - 01:47:23.720, Speaker A: We have to ask the question about the island.
01:47:23.800 - 01:47:32.160, Speaker B: Okay, fine. Yes. Let's ask you now. We're going to ask you some tough questions. Okay. All right. You ask the music question, I'll ask the other questions.
01:47:32.160 - 01:47:32.608, Speaker B: Okay.
01:47:32.694 - 01:47:43.030, Speaker A: If you are on a deserted island and you can only have one album with you to get you through being on the island, what album are you bringing with?
01:47:45.240 - 01:47:48.920, Speaker D: Ooh, I'll go Metallica hardwired.
01:47:51.260 - 01:47:54.650, Speaker B: We know. Guys. Did you change yours? You have to give us a new one.
01:47:56.700 - 01:48:04.024, Speaker E: Oh, man. It's hard because I feel like these days, I don't even know album names.
01:48:04.152 - 01:48:04.780, Speaker B: So true.
01:48:04.850 - 01:48:15.404, Speaker E: It's like I just listen to music. I don't know. I feel like I still would answer Queen, but I don't even remember the album names or the records.
01:48:15.532 - 01:48:18.112, Speaker B: I think we went with Queen's greatest hits last time.
01:48:18.246 - 01:48:32.820, Speaker C: Okay, Jan, that's a really tough one. I like the idea of having something that could really pump you up if you're on an island and give you energy. So if I'm going that route, I'll probably pick tool lateralis.
01:48:33.880 - 01:48:36.384, Speaker B: You're a big tool fan, you and Roger.
01:48:36.512 - 01:48:37.716, Speaker C: I'm a huge tool fan.
01:48:37.748 - 01:48:38.772, Speaker B: Roger Dickerman.
01:48:38.916 - 01:48:42.740, Speaker C: Shout out, Roger. He came down to Miami.
01:48:42.820 - 01:48:43.352, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:48:43.486 - 01:48:45.624, Speaker D: The leather jacket is on point then.
01:48:45.662 - 01:49:05.870, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you. I just want to see Roger in a mosh pit because I don't know if you know this. Roger lived a different life before he was a bodybuilder. Failed bodybuilder. I just want to point that out. He also has failed as a collector in NFT space.
01:49:08.900 - 01:49:10.428, Speaker C: I will defend his honor.
01:49:10.604 - 01:49:15.152, Speaker B: I'm just kidding. I love Roger, but I know he's a huge tool fan. I hear you guys.
01:49:15.206 - 01:49:17.996, Speaker C: Roger the tool concert was quite a sight to behold.
01:49:18.028 - 01:49:19.288, Speaker B: Yeah, he was, like, going nuts.
01:49:19.404 - 01:49:23.456, Speaker C: It was great. It was amazing. It was just, like, a very primal.
01:49:23.568 - 01:49:28.688, Speaker B: I wish I could have seen that. I would have loved to see him lose control. I seen him get angry, and it's very uncomfortable.
01:49:28.704 - 01:49:35.332, Speaker C: It was interesting because it would happen for some, but then for some, he would just be sitting there, and it was, like, the most intense thing. I was like, where is it going? How is he just retaining all his.
01:49:35.386 - 01:49:36.630, Speaker B: He just keeps it.
01:49:37.080 - 01:49:38.192, Speaker C: He's so controlled.
01:49:38.256 - 01:49:38.816, Speaker B: So controlled.
01:49:38.848 - 01:49:40.076, Speaker C: But I were moments where you could.
01:49:40.098 - 01:49:49.276, Speaker B: See, I want to see that. I want to get a video on it. Like, mint that. Yeah. And then make it into glitch art. And then really just got to take.
01:49:49.298 - 01:49:56.780, Speaker C: Them to a tool concert. Tool Adderallis. And if not, tame, impala currents.
01:49:56.860 - 01:50:16.230, Speaker B: Okay. I love it. Now I'll ask you a couple of questions. You have a little time. So, if I said you were in a room that had four walls and you can't get out of the room, you're going to live forever in that room, but you could take one thing into that room with you. What would you take?
01:50:19.360 - 01:50:25.790, Speaker C: Just, like, hypothetically, I'm getting fed, and they're giving me all these things. So it'd be like an entertainment kind of thing.
01:50:27.440 - 01:50:30.372, Speaker B: Well, whatever it is, you're getting fed.
01:50:30.456 - 01:50:45.332, Speaker C: Yeah. I have a 512 gigabyte iPod that has all of, like. I still have it to this day, and I have probably, like, 60 days of music in there.
01:50:45.466 - 01:50:47.908, Speaker B: So you just bring that. Okay, fair enough.
01:50:47.994 - 01:50:51.220, Speaker C: Or a video game, besides a computer.
01:50:51.290 - 01:50:52.388, Speaker D: And my life doesn't change.
01:50:52.474 - 01:50:55.921, Speaker B: Yeah, you could bring anything. I'm just saying.
01:50:55.921 - 01:50:56.212, Speaker D: Just saying.
01:50:56.212 - 01:50:56.490, Speaker B: I'm.
01:50:57.020 - 01:50:59.128, Speaker D: This would be like web3 all over again.
01:50:59.294 - 01:51:03.690, Speaker B: Right, guy, what would you bring?
01:51:04.140 - 01:51:07.272, Speaker E: Yeah, it seems like computer is, like, the obvious answer on that one.
01:51:07.326 - 01:51:31.568, Speaker B: Right? So interesting. I love asking that question, because I don't know why anybody doesn't say they'll bring a door. Get out. Which means it's very interesting. I always like to ask that because I'm wondering how many people want to actually stay in the room. So you are in the room, and you listen to music all day. You would stay on your computer.
01:51:31.568 - 01:51:38.550, Speaker B: So you're in that. How many people want to get out? Not really get out, but escape that room. And some people just want to stay.
01:51:41.800 - 01:51:49.320, Speaker A: A lot of people are like, well, a door would be obvious. If I'm getting fed, there's a door that's getting the food in the door.
01:51:50.700 - 01:51:54.036, Speaker B: Coming in from heaven with just four walls.
01:51:54.068 - 01:51:58.164, Speaker D: I was thinking, like, intravenous. Like, you're just really dystopian IV.
01:51:58.212 - 01:52:33.844, Speaker B: Yeah. There's an IV drip that feeds you food. You have to walk around the room, and it's like a very long IV drip. Yeah, that's all right. Well, we love for you that you guys came on, guy, who has come on our show a few times now, and hopefully as we get together, because he's the best, and it's not a secret, that guy and Deez, myself, Ian and Will, we collect together. We have a little subgroup that collects. I don't even know what you call it.
01:52:33.882 - 01:52:34.432, Speaker A: Megazord.
01:52:34.496 - 01:52:42.184, Speaker B: Megazord, right. Collective. Collective. But, guy, thank you for coming, as usual, even though you didn't bring biscuits this time. We won't hold it again.
01:52:42.222 - 01:52:43.320, Speaker A: We had bread from.
01:52:43.390 - 01:52:43.816, Speaker B: We do.
01:52:43.838 - 01:52:45.060, Speaker A: We have postwark.
01:52:45.220 - 01:52:48.536, Speaker B: Yeah. Postmark made. Amazing bread. Did you try it?
01:52:48.638 - 01:52:49.272, Speaker E: I have not.
01:52:49.326 - 01:52:52.280, Speaker B: It's so good. Yeah, she's there.
01:52:52.350 - 01:52:53.144, Speaker E: Yeah, she's over there.
01:52:53.182 - 01:52:54.392, Speaker B: Wait, are you making bread right?
01:52:54.446 - 01:52:56.772, Speaker A: No, no, we have the bread from yesterday.
01:52:56.916 - 01:53:11.490, Speaker B: Okay, we'll have it for the next podcast. And, Patrick, again, I think that you don't stop writing those tweets that are controversial, because we all love them.
01:53:12.100 - 01:53:16.130, Speaker A: Don't stop creating art that gets taken out by the after five.
01:53:17.320 - 01:53:20.516, Speaker B: That's what we like. That's like a feather in your cap, right?
01:53:20.698 - 01:53:22.208, Speaker A: That's a couple of feathers.
01:53:22.384 - 01:53:23.430, Speaker B: It's like two.
01:53:24.440 - 01:53:25.670, Speaker A: Thank you, social.
01:53:28.540 - 01:53:39.480, Speaker B: Jan, I love you. And I'm going to leave with these with everybody. Get their final word, and I'll let these close it out. Yeah. Well, everybody wants to say anything. Lastly.
01:53:40.060 - 01:53:45.176, Speaker D: No, this is great. Thank you. This is such a pleasure finally getting to hang out with you guys and chat.
01:53:45.288 - 01:53:45.564, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:53:45.602 - 01:53:49.368, Speaker A: Thank you guys for your time, for coming and hanging out with us. It's always a pleasure.
01:53:49.464 - 01:53:50.684, Speaker B: You could have been doing so many.
01:53:50.722 - 01:53:54.332, Speaker A: Better things, like playing basketball, getting rained on in LA.
01:53:54.386 - 01:53:57.024, Speaker B: Getting rained on. Wait, by the way, it hasn't rained in a little bit.
01:53:57.142 - 01:53:59.952, Speaker A: We're getting lucky. I think we're past that.
01:54:00.006 - 01:54:07.184, Speaker B: You think so? Yeah. What do they call it? They don't call it a storm here. They call it atmospheric something. River.
01:54:07.232 - 01:54:08.096, Speaker D: Atmospheric river.
01:54:08.128 - 01:54:11.012, Speaker B: Atmospheric river. What is that, by the way?
01:54:11.146 - 01:54:14.464, Speaker D: Some weird new phenomenon that we have to give us. Rain.
01:54:14.512 - 01:54:15.440, Speaker B: But it's just rain.
01:54:15.520 - 01:54:16.192, Speaker D: It's just rain.
01:54:16.256 - 01:54:17.924, Speaker B: So they call it atmospheric river.
01:54:17.972 - 01:54:20.552, Speaker D: It sounds cooler. We got to pitch it.
01:54:20.606 - 01:54:21.572, Speaker A: Sounds more Hollywood.
01:54:21.636 - 01:54:22.410, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
01:54:23.100 - 01:54:31.096, Speaker A: Instead of just saying that there's clouds that are raining, there's a storm coming. Atmospheric rivers are up in the air maybe we should.
01:54:31.118 - 01:54:32.964, Speaker B: That's like a great name for a band atmosphere.
01:54:33.012 - 01:54:36.584, Speaker A: Maybe we'll just rename the pod from. Yeah, maybe shipwreck to atmospheric river.
01:54:36.632 - 01:54:38.136, Speaker D: Definitely acoustic guitar.
01:54:38.328 - 01:54:44.128, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, how about when the bull market comes back, we'll call it atmospheric river. Okay, yeah, we'll change the name of.
01:54:44.134 - 01:54:46.850, Speaker A: The podcast as we're selling our bags. There's an at.
01:54:48.180 - 01:54:56.860, Speaker B: That's what it is. Anyway, I hope that when the market comes back and we sell stuff that people aren't like, yo, can't believe you're selling.
01:54:56.940 - 01:54:58.480, Speaker A: That's how we end the pod.
01:54:59.240 - 01:55:00.596, Speaker B: That's when we end the pod. Yeah.
01:55:00.618 - 01:55:01.376, Speaker A: Can't believe you're selling.
01:55:01.408 - 01:55:33.560, Speaker B: We just can't believe you're selling. Well, it's know, I will say now that you say this, I was buying with Ian and Will. I remember all this photography stuff so early on, and we were selling some of it later while the next batch came in. And I don't want to say who, but one of the collectors is like, yo, you're dumping. And I'm like, dude, we bought so far before you. Isn't that the point here? I'm not dumping, I'm just selling it to you. But we'll see.
01:55:33.560 - 01:55:40.672, Speaker B: They might hate us. Actually, they'll hate you in norcal because you guys are popular. Nobody knows who I am, so it'd be great.
01:55:40.726 - 01:55:43.424, Speaker A: Would you hide behind an entity with two other people?
01:55:43.542 - 01:55:47.276, Speaker B: Exactly. Nobody knows me. See, even Patrick's son thinks that's funny.
01:55:47.308 - 01:55:47.696, Speaker A: Anyway.
01:55:47.798 - 01:55:50.256, Speaker B: Yeah. So you want to close it out?
01:55:50.358 - 01:55:51.584, Speaker A: I did. Twice, and then.
01:55:51.622 - 01:55:51.968, Speaker B: Sorry.
01:55:52.054 - 01:55:56.312, Speaker A: And then she started talking about people hating us. Try third time.
01:55:56.366 - 01:55:57.080, Speaker B: One more time.
01:55:57.150 - 01:56:03.464, Speaker A: All right, we already said this, and he can just cut it and put what I said already back in.
01:56:03.502 - 01:56:11.030, Speaker B: All right, that's it, then. Thank you. Perfect. Black.
