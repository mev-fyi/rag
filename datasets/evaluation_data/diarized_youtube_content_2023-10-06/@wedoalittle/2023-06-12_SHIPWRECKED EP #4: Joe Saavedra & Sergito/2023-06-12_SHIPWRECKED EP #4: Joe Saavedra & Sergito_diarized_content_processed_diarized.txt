00:00:00.570 - 00:00:24.586, Speaker A: In this episode of Shipwrecked, we are joined by two of our good friends, Joe and Sergito. Joe Savedra is the founder and CEO of Infinite objects, and Sergito is the founder of Seize the MEBs. We dive into the founding of infinite objects, Sergito's love of me bits, the importance of personal finance, galleries, selling digital art in a world before NFTs, and so much more. As always, this podcast is for entertainment purposes only. It should not be allowed upon for best decisions, reputies and guests may own NFTs.
00:00:24.618 - 00:00:25.222, Speaker B: Discuss.
00:00:25.396 - 00:00:36.226, Speaker C: I'm just saying. Everybody, welcome to another episode of Shipwrecked. Even though we started this podcast when we were in a bear market, I don't know if we're.
00:00:36.338 - 00:00:41.366, Speaker A: We're not shipwrecked. I don't know. Maybe we're like, finding a lifeboat. Like, maybe there's a helicopter over the.
00:00:41.388 - 00:00:45.302, Speaker C: Wreck, or maybe we like, through a flare and we see like a boat in the distance.
00:00:45.366 - 00:00:47.002, Speaker A: Maybe it's a mirage, right?
00:00:47.136 - 00:00:56.190, Speaker C: It's not. Sure. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So we feel like the bull market's back, but we're back. We're still shipwrecked. Might have to change the name if it becomes a bull market.
00:00:56.190 - 00:01:07.390, Speaker C: Okay, we are here with two amazing people, Sergito and Joe. And we have some great. We were just started talking about Beeple's dick butt.
00:01:07.470 - 00:01:07.810, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:07.880 - 00:01:09.410, Speaker A: We're going to dive right into.
00:01:09.560 - 00:01:10.082, Speaker C: Why not?
00:01:10.136 - 00:01:15.090, Speaker A: Most photorealistic 3D Rendering of a dick butt.
00:01:15.750 - 00:01:16.258, Speaker C: Yes.
00:01:16.344 - 00:01:24.502, Speaker A: And we think it's the most historic piece of art that people's ever created. That's how we're making a stand to start off the podcast. We're not introducing anybody, not saying what.
00:01:24.556 - 00:01:27.026, Speaker C: We don't need to know what you do. We just want to make this dick.
00:01:27.058 - 00:01:30.898, Speaker A: Butt is the most historical piece of art in Beeple's entire collection.
00:01:30.994 - 00:01:54.826, Speaker C: We showed this yesterday to two people who are not into NFT space, but big into the art space. And I made the comment that I believe that this is Beeple's best artwork that he's done. I really do believe that. I think that everything else is fun, entertaining from a standpoint of art. I think the dick butt actually is monumental.
00:01:55.018 - 00:01:58.770, Speaker A: Now that we got that out on the table, we clear the air.
00:01:58.840 - 00:01:59.538, Speaker B: We should tell.
00:01:59.624 - 00:02:06.180, Speaker D: That was not controversial at all. Full agreement, nothing to discuss, really. That is people's most.
00:02:07.590 - 00:02:08.354, Speaker A: Put that out there.
00:02:08.392 - 00:02:14.550, Speaker C: Let's just put it out there. It's in the universe now. Let's do introduction. So let's. Sergita, you want to start with you give us a little.
00:02:14.620 - 00:02:26.070, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, thanks for having me. Exciting to be here. Love that we started with culture and just perfect math. 1D equals one B. That is always just going to be the guiding light for web3, I think. I'm Sergito.
00:02:26.070 - 00:02:47.454, Speaker B: I am a collector of sorts. Almost accidentally became a founder last Sunday. Started a meat car project focused on the mibits, which are dear to my heart. I also have a real job. I work at Fireblocks, which is a large provider of wallet infrastructure for crypto companies. And, yeah, now I'm just really excited for this hour, however long we're going to chat.
00:02:47.502 - 00:02:47.858, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:47.944 - 00:02:49.730, Speaker A: Thank you for joining us. Let's do it.
00:02:49.880 - 00:03:26.442, Speaker D: How's it going, guys? Yeah. Equally thankful to be here. I am a hardware and software developer who became a founder about five years ago, which is crazy. When I started the company infinite objects. We are known for our hardware product, which is a display that is traditionally encased in acrylic and can never be changed by the collector. It is a video print that immutability is really the biggest kind of innovation in our product. But obviously, design wise, we are very much not a gadget.
00:03:26.442 - 00:03:29.710, Speaker D: We're very much a physical body for piece of digital content.
00:03:29.860 - 00:03:41.058, Speaker C: So let's just start there because I think it's the perfect segue. So first of all, I really feel like. So he doesn't have that many followers on Twitter. It's like, it doesn't make sense.
00:03:41.064 - 00:03:52.630, Speaker A: He's building a skills to build products. It makes perfect sense.
00:03:52.700 - 00:04:06.010, Speaker C: But it's just so weird to me because everybody uses and loves infinite objects. And when I met Joe, I was like, oh, my God, dude, you're amazing. And he's like, wait, are you red beard? I was like, yeah, but don't worry about that. You made no, when you saw him.
00:04:06.160 - 00:04:07.898, Speaker D: I didn't put two and two together.
00:04:08.064 - 00:04:44.280, Speaker C: You made infinite objects. And I do think it's funny because I agree the specialness to them that you can't change them. Well, I know some people, oh, I want to change. It's like, no, this is what they're here for. And I know that you have other products that you're building that I don't know if you can or can't talk about. But I do love the fact that the immutability and also the provenance of it and the way you connect them to the NFT is, you know, we just had this conversation yesterday. One of the things that these two people from the art world had said to us, because we're not using trad art anymore art.
00:04:44.280 - 00:05:15.906, Speaker C: They said that one of the issues is being able to see the art, right? So they have to see it really well. And I showed one of them a video of your infinite objects and he's like, oh my God, this is amazing, right? Because it made sense to him all of a sudden, because he could touch it and feel it. We love this idea of digital art, but digital art doesn't have to just mean it's in a cloud. It has to have. Digital has its technology and this is part of the technology that you're building. So I do think that there's something about that that makes it really special.
00:05:16.088 - 00:05:50.074, Speaker D: Yeah. I mean, when we think about art, digital art as a kind of historical category, this is not new, right? The idea of creating a piece of software that renders something beautiful or something emotional or something historical. Galleries have been selling bitforms is not that far from here. Bitforms gallery, they've been selling video games as art. They've been selling video as art, as a traditional gallery. And, sorry, I just touched. And you know how they would do it.
00:05:50.074 - 00:06:10.542, Speaker D: They would be like, yeah, we've got. This. Video is first of all projected on a wall, right? It would always be on a wall or a projection or on a screen, and they would say, this is an edition of Ten. And you as the collector could walk in there and they've been, seriously, I think they're 20 years old gallery. You would walk in there and when you purchased it, they would present you with a USB stick.
00:06:10.606 - 00:06:11.122, Speaker C: No way.
00:06:11.176 - 00:07:13.494, Speaker D: Swear to God. And that USB stick sometimes was gold and it would be like a box and it would be a gold USB stick and have a little certificate of authenticity. But there's no actual digital provenance there, right? It's the same amount of provenance as like a piece of paper that's been printed that says, yeah, this is a piece of digital work. So that idea, I think, is not a new kind of challenge and it's not a new reality that we've been living in. But obviously, blockchain has completely opened the world in terms of authenticity, in terms of scarcity, in terms of how you collect a piece of digital artwork, right? And so, yeah, it's not new what we're doing. I think this application of a display and saying the display itself is additioned and itself becomes a sculpture that represents a digital asset that is completely new and that itself has never been copied. No one's been brave enough to come out with a display that can never be changed, which is great.
00:07:13.494 - 00:07:20.966, Speaker D: We have seen some copycats on the design side, but we've got our IP coverage. We've got our patents filed. You hear that?
00:07:21.148 - 00:07:22.182, Speaker C: Don't mess around.
00:07:22.316 - 00:07:23.206, Speaker D: I mean, go ahead.
00:07:23.228 - 00:07:24.360, Speaker C: Come at fuck around.
00:07:25.610 - 00:07:27.286, Speaker D: I'm not nervous. I'm not nervous at all.
00:07:27.308 - 00:07:28.118, Speaker B: Let's go.
00:07:28.284 - 00:07:40.960, Speaker D: So, yeah, I mean, new. It's an exciting kind of approach. But again, the issue, the problem is not new. The problem has been here since way before NFT was even.
00:07:41.890 - 00:07:51.810, Speaker C: You know, I think while we're here, we should see what they look. So these, we have a present for. We have. We have something that we got you here.
00:07:51.880 - 00:07:52.930, Speaker A: Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
00:07:53.000 - 00:07:57.586, Speaker D: Now, I don't know. I actually don't know which is which. So, you guys, I brought two.
00:07:57.608 - 00:08:00.226, Speaker A: I brought some live unboxing.
00:08:00.258 - 00:08:01.238, Speaker D: Unboxing. Exactly.
00:08:01.324 - 00:08:01.766, Speaker A: Figure it out.
00:08:01.788 - 00:08:05.638, Speaker C: Here we go. We're recording, right? Make sure. Okay. All right.
00:08:05.804 - 00:08:08.310, Speaker D: Here you go, Benny. Let's see. Let's see if you guys are getting.
00:08:08.380 - 00:08:13.186, Speaker C: Let's see which one. Look how beautiful these boxes are.
00:08:13.228 - 00:08:14.602, Speaker B: I'm getting FOMO right now, right?
00:08:14.656 - 00:08:16.522, Speaker D: Yeah, that one's upside down.
00:08:16.656 - 00:08:20.394, Speaker C: I should have gotten Tiger was. You know what? Oh, no, we got. Switch.
00:08:20.442 - 00:08:20.734, Speaker D: We got.
00:08:20.772 - 00:08:22.270, Speaker C: Open yours. Open yours.
00:08:22.690 - 00:08:23.840, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:08:27.010 - 00:08:29.342, Speaker A: So I have a few infinite objects at home.
00:08:29.396 - 00:08:31.054, Speaker D: Oh, you do? I love hearing that.
00:08:31.092 - 00:08:43.938, Speaker A: So one thing I have, like, got a couple from, like, Elo and Ma Topshot, but I got one from a one on one artist that is like an animated piece that I bought from him that hits different. Look at that.
00:08:44.024 - 00:08:44.660, Speaker C: Right?
00:08:46.550 - 00:08:49.974, Speaker A: These look fancier than that. I think I got mine, like, a year or two ago.
00:08:50.012 - 00:08:57.606, Speaker C: This looks different. They look really nice now. Wait, where did you get that thing? This. Is that new? The stand?
00:08:57.708 - 00:09:03.754, Speaker D: The stand is. Yeah, it's not new. It's something that is just for friends and family.
00:09:03.952 - 00:09:04.774, Speaker B: Alpha.
00:09:04.902 - 00:09:07.990, Speaker D: The ten inch actually comes with the stand. These are the seven inch display.
00:09:08.070 - 00:09:08.714, Speaker B: I didn't know we had.
00:09:08.752 - 00:09:10.518, Speaker A: Is the back different? Am I tripping?
00:09:10.614 - 00:09:14.682, Speaker D: So, yeah, this back is the authenticated NFT video print backside.
00:09:14.746 - 00:09:15.070, Speaker A: Wow.
00:09:15.140 - 00:09:23.950, Speaker D: Which is different than the kind of standard, which is like a gray, just as infinite object. These have their own provenance. And we'll talk about what that means in a second.
00:09:24.020 - 00:09:25.054, Speaker A: Let me scan this QR code.
00:09:25.092 - 00:09:25.854, Speaker D: Let me get. Yeah, yeah.
00:09:25.892 - 00:09:38.990, Speaker B: I'll tell you what. I have a few of them in my office. And same thing. People at know we're a crypto firm, but obviously NFTs are a little on the fringe side of that super ray. And our CEO came over, he's like, is that an NFt? Yeah, I'm like, yes, okay, I want one.
00:09:39.000 - 00:09:39.910, Speaker C: It makes a big difference.
00:09:39.980 - 00:09:41.190, Speaker B: Immediately. I want one.
00:09:41.260 - 00:10:10.926, Speaker C: You know, Dave talked about this a million times. I missed it. But he told me the event that he went to at Venus over Manhattan when they did the Squiggles was one of the best events that he's ever been to. And he said that the infinite objects, the way that you guys worked with Venus over Manhattan and how that worked was just brilliant. And I know that Eric absolutely loves, he talks about it because it was a big moment for him also. So it just, to me, I agree. I think it hits different.
00:10:10.926 - 00:10:31.110, Speaker C: I have a bunch also, and what I do is I give them out to people in my offices, and they sit in their desk, and they're, you know, I would talk about doing NFTs at school all the time. One time, they would make a joke. They think I live in the metaverse. They have no idea what it is. But the second I gave these out, they all. That's really nice. Oh, I get it.
00:10:31.110 - 00:10:31.702, Speaker C: It's art.
00:10:31.756 - 00:10:32.454, Speaker B: It makes it real.
00:10:32.492 - 00:10:33.350, Speaker C: Yeah, it makes it real.
00:10:33.420 - 00:11:06.850, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. And I think so two things there. One is this kind of helps explain what an NFT is to a non blockchain person. Right? Someone who doesn't even give a shit about blockchain. You can be like, look, this is a piece of digital content. Whether it's art, whether it's entertainment, whether it's personal content, it's still something that is meaningful and valuable as a piece of content. When it's backed by the blockchain, you can explain, oh, this is representing something on chain that is scarce, that has its own provenance, was minted at this time by this person or this entity.
00:11:06.850 - 00:11:19.234, Speaker D: That kind of onboarding, we feel like, is just. This really helps bring in those people who don't understand and maybe don't even care necessarily, but can get them in.
00:11:19.272 - 00:11:25.880, Speaker C: Well, I think it's going back to what Deez and I always talk about, like, you drive your car, you don't really give a shit how your car works. You just want to drive your car.
00:11:26.810 - 00:11:28.390, Speaker A: I want a bag of camera.
00:11:29.690 - 00:11:44.054, Speaker C: I want warm seats. I want the wheel to warm up. It's the same thing as yard. It's like, I want my art to look amazing. I don't care how or where it is. I just want it to look good. The fact that you could connect it, and you should talk about connecting it to the process.
00:11:44.192 - 00:12:01.806, Speaker D: I'll talk about that in a second. But Venus over Manhattan is a perfect example of a gallery that has only been traditional up until last. Never. They had never really done blockchain. Eric was definitely their first kind of artist. Who they represent and work so closely with that is only a blockchain.
00:12:01.838 - 00:12:03.118, Speaker B: And Eric being snowfrow.
00:12:03.134 - 00:12:04.020, Speaker D: Yes, for those.
00:12:07.930 - 00:12:09.638, Speaker C: I think actually what Adam is doing.
00:12:09.724 - 00:12:12.274, Speaker A: Everybody knows him by his first name, Eric.
00:12:12.322 - 00:12:13.010, Speaker C: Sorry, snowfrow.
00:12:13.010 - 00:12:14.790, Speaker A: It's like we introduced Joe as Joe.
00:12:15.290 - 00:12:16.390, Speaker B: Here's Joe.
00:12:17.050 - 00:12:18.550, Speaker C: Can you pronounce your last name?
00:12:18.620 - 00:12:19.314, Speaker D: Savedra.
00:12:19.362 - 00:12:19.906, Speaker C: Savedra.
00:12:19.938 - 00:12:21.350, Speaker B: Okay, we'll keep it on Joe.
00:12:22.510 - 00:12:48.914, Speaker C: I just call him Joe so it makes it easier. No, I actually love what Adam's doing there. I'm hoping to go visit in a couple of weeks with a couple people. I really think what Venus and over Manhattan's doing is just phenomenal. One of the best galleries, I feel like. And Adam's really collecting phenomenal art. He sees it, he gets it, and it's just going back to the better collectors who are just like, okay, we need to understand how we're going to curate here.
00:12:48.914 - 00:12:52.722, Speaker C: He's one of those guys. Not to take it away, but with what we're talking about. But I just wanted to.
00:12:52.776 - 00:13:06.262, Speaker D: Yeah, no, completely. But being a traditional art gallery with their own mailing list, being traditional art collectors, and then wanting to have an opening night. I brought Sergio. I remember. Yeah, that was great.
00:13:06.316 - 00:13:06.920, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:13:07.370 - 00:13:18.870, Speaker D: That was a long time ago. But telling it physically is really important to them. And so we obviously have a number of different size units. We showed our really large twins.
00:13:18.950 - 00:13:20.010, Speaker C: They have like a 50 square.
00:13:20.080 - 00:13:28.106, Speaker D: They have like a 52 inch, 26 inch diagonal square. It's like this big, but it's a square display. It's real thick.
00:13:28.138 - 00:13:29.402, Speaker B: Yeah, it's insane.
00:13:29.466 - 00:13:34.606, Speaker D: And then we built a sculpture in there, right? That, like, box crazy.
00:13:34.708 - 00:13:35.086, Speaker C: So cool.
00:13:35.108 - 00:14:03.450, Speaker D: It was like 100 units, I think, or 110 units. And so that's important to those people, right, to onboard. Again, whether it's a traditional gallery or traditional collector, telling the story and showing it in a beautiful way that honestly doesn't look like a television. It doesn't just look like a computer monitor that feels elevated and then has this permanent side. Its own provenance aspect as well just makes it so much more kind of sensical, logical, because I saw that. Yeah, right.
00:14:03.600 - 00:14:06.460, Speaker C: Actually use his phone on the back.
00:14:06.990 - 00:14:45.346, Speaker D: So what's important to us when it comes to NFTs is that you do have to own that asset in order to physicalize it. And so we have a number of authentication methods on our website. The first one we launched a year ago with Topshot, where you log in with your dapper wallet. We preview your contents of your wallet in an infinite object, and then you can order an authenticated physical of an NFT that you provably own. We also have the same thing for ethereum layer one with metamask or wall connect. But what's important to recognize is, yes, you just scanned yours, your backside, and every unit has its own unique identifier. It can be a QR code, it could be an NFC tag.
00:14:45.346 - 00:15:30.070, Speaker D: We've done all of it. But when you scan it, yes, it's taking you to that super rare drop page. However, it's actually running through our system, which knows not just that it's pointing to super rare, and it will forward you to super rare, but it also is a record. Right now in a web two database that is recording. What wallet authenticated this object? When did that wallet own it? And when did that wallet make that purchase? Then it has a lot of descriptors around, what is this object made out of? What size is it, what manufacturer, what batch number? All of the things that kind of describe the physical itself. And then critically, what print edition number is this? And that's interesting, because if you sell.
00:15:30.140 - 00:15:31.880, Speaker A: Your token, somebody else would get two.
00:15:32.250 - 00:15:33.574, Speaker D: They would get print number two.
00:15:33.612 - 00:15:34.198, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:15:34.364 - 00:16:12.674, Speaker D: And that is inherently less valuable than the first time. This, especially if you knew it was by Dees. You knew Dees bought that physical first. Print number one was owned by Deez and authenticated by Deez, print number two by whoever else. So it is kind of a new way of thinking about what it means to generate and kind of collect physical manifestations, right? Physical expressions of a singular digital asset, because it's never going to replace that asset, right? That asset will always live on chain. All of that provenance is never going to be changed. This is just one expression of it.
00:16:12.712 - 00:16:36.426, Speaker A: Have you ever had a traditional or older collector be like, I love this, but I want the art to be owned in this. I don't want to do the wallet thing. Can you just give me this and have it owned by. I can imagine there's people who don't want to custody it and they're like, can you make a video print that holds the custody of it? Is that something that's ever been thought about?
00:16:36.448 - 00:16:39.446, Speaker D: It's been thought about, absolutely. I mean, essentially you're describing a hardware wallet.
00:16:39.478 - 00:16:40.058, Speaker C: Yeah. Right.
00:16:40.144 - 00:16:47.630, Speaker D: Can this become a hardware wallet? And yeah, I've talked to ledger about that. Like, what would it take to? And I mean, it's an expensive endeavor.
00:16:49.010 - 00:16:54.586, Speaker C: But if you have a really expensive x copy, could be like I could see people being like, look, yeah, I just want the physical.
00:16:54.618 - 00:16:58.178, Speaker A: I could just see the older. Like, when you're talking about having that nice two foot.
00:16:58.344 - 00:17:01.054, Speaker B: Or like those punks that got sold with paper wallets.
00:17:01.102 - 00:17:02.478, Speaker A: Yes. Remember with the wax?
00:17:02.574 - 00:17:02.882, Speaker D: Right.
00:17:02.936 - 00:17:11.970, Speaker C: By the way, that's my first time I ever bought an NFT. Almost was. I had a funk. Crazy stories.
00:17:12.050 - 00:17:12.678, Speaker B: Almost.
00:17:12.844 - 00:17:18.006, Speaker C: I went to this art gallery. Artix code, right?
00:17:18.188 - 00:17:19.538, Speaker D: Artix code is Sophia.
00:17:19.634 - 00:17:23.658, Speaker C: Yeah. Like a long time ago. Like, I don't know, early 2019, maybe. It was.
00:17:23.744 - 00:17:24.842, Speaker D: Yeah, they've been around.
00:17:24.976 - 00:17:38.590, Speaker C: So I went downstairs and this basement area where they were selling art, and I said to them, to my wife, I was, buy some art. Because it turns out they were taking ether for art. I was like, oh, fuck this.
00:17:38.660 - 00:17:42.240, Speaker B: I got ether money backs over here.
00:17:43.490 - 00:17:52.638, Speaker C: I looked at this side of the room. It was a tiny room. I was like, I want that. My wife's like, I'm not getting that shit. She's like, let's get that. There was two other artists. One was this guy named Tyler Hobbes.
00:17:52.638 - 00:17:54.094, Speaker C: The other guy was Demetri Cherniak.
00:17:54.142 - 00:17:55.060, Speaker D: Never heard of.
00:17:56.150 - 00:18:11.942, Speaker C: Right, exactly. We bought two pieces of fine art from Demetri Cherniak that are not ringers, even though they look like ringers. But they're not ringers. I want to be very clear that I say this. They look, arguably ringers. They will be worth the pre.
00:18:11.996 - 00:18:13.038, Speaker A: They don't look like ringers.
00:18:13.074 - 00:18:15.370, Speaker B: Correct. They're pre ringer, though, right?
00:18:15.520 - 00:18:16.326, Speaker C: They're pre ringer.
00:18:16.358 - 00:18:16.906, Speaker D: That's amazing.
00:18:17.008 - 00:18:18.662, Speaker C: So it's fine art. I can show you a picture.
00:18:18.726 - 00:18:19.786, Speaker D: And they're all one of ones.
00:18:19.888 - 00:18:29.840, Speaker C: Yeah, they're fine art pieces. I bought two of them. One's in my mom's house. She has no idea what it is. I'm like, by the way, it's a little valuable. She tells all her friends, she's like, this is my son. He collects art.
00:18:29.840 - 00:18:43.546, Speaker C: Just no clue. It's up there. And she's like, whatever, it's fine. And then on the other side of the room were these things called crypto punks that were physicals. And behind the frame was a wallet.
00:18:43.658 - 00:18:44.934, Speaker D: Was it a private key?
00:18:45.012 - 00:18:45.414, Speaker B: Private key?
00:18:45.452 - 00:18:46.294, Speaker D: It was just a private key.
00:18:46.332 - 00:18:57.320, Speaker C: Right behind. There was 20 of them. And the lady there, she's like, yeah, there's not that many sold yet. Do you want one? It was like $500. And it was like some crazy number. And my wife's like, I'm not putting that up in my house. I remind her every day of that.
00:18:57.320 - 00:19:06.874, Speaker C: That was, like, $4 million. Now, I probably would have sold it, like, way beforehand, but I'm just like. I would have had one those of physicals. And I remember sitting there and looking at it, like, oh, that kind of looks cool.
00:19:07.072 - 00:19:11.962, Speaker D: So larva labs actually produced it, though, like, the physical. I don't remember that.
00:19:12.016 - 00:19:13.114, Speaker C: I think it was very early on.
00:19:13.152 - 00:19:16.990, Speaker B: Yeah, it was very early on. I think they also resold some of those at Sotheby.
00:19:18.210 - 00:19:20.110, Speaker C: Probably one of those I wanted to buy.
00:19:20.180 - 00:19:22.382, Speaker D: They actually resold to sell because it didn't sell.
00:19:22.516 - 00:19:23.102, Speaker C: It didn't sell?
00:19:23.156 - 00:19:23.760, Speaker D: No.
00:19:24.290 - 00:19:25.946, Speaker C: Right. But it's funny.
00:19:25.978 - 00:19:26.830, Speaker D: But that's amazing.
00:19:26.900 - 00:19:38.966, Speaker C: Going back to sorting the physical, my wife, that was the only time she really liked NFTs. She's like, I want the fine art. I want the physical. It's the same idea. So these in my house, she loves because she always gets the feeling of them.
00:19:39.148 - 00:19:44.454, Speaker D: Right. I'll tell one more element here, and then we should get on to.
00:19:44.652 - 00:19:46.920, Speaker C: We got plenty to talk to Sergito about.
00:19:48.250 - 00:20:00.042, Speaker D: That unique identifier in this case is, again, a representation of your ownership and your purchase of that. Right. I mean, you didn't buy it. I authenticated for you. You're very welcome.
00:20:00.096 - 00:20:00.474, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:20:00.512 - 00:20:24.098, Speaker D: But my point is, I authenticated for you is what I'm getting at. But what we've also done is distribute, use that unique identifier as a distribution method. So we worked with for NftNyc. I forgot which event it was. It was one of the big ones. They purchased 200 units, and they distributed the 200 units to VIPs at the party. And this is like the NFt NYC two.
00:20:24.184 - 00:20:25.778, Speaker A: This was NFT now.
00:20:25.864 - 00:20:26.706, Speaker D: It was Nft now.
00:20:26.728 - 00:20:26.914, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:26.952 - 00:20:30.642, Speaker D: Wait, was it Nft now? We did one with NFT. They had a bunch done this a few ways.
00:20:30.696 - 00:20:31.022, Speaker A: Okay.
00:20:31.096 - 00:20:32.470, Speaker C: There was a bunch in a room.
00:20:32.540 - 00:20:33.960, Speaker A: And, like, you took it.
00:20:34.490 - 00:20:38.710, Speaker C: You might have done it for NFT NYC, but you definitely did do it for NFT now 100 last year.
00:20:38.860 - 00:20:41.334, Speaker D: Okay. And no. Are you talking about the gala?
00:20:41.462 - 00:20:46.460, Speaker C: The NFT 100 gala thing at the Radio city? Yes.
00:20:46.910 - 00:20:51.354, Speaker D: I don't think those were. Well, what I'm about to describe anyway. Sorry.
00:20:51.552 - 00:20:52.986, Speaker C: Those are definitely infinite objects.
00:20:53.018 - 00:21:06.290, Speaker D: 100%. I mean, I was there. It was beautiful. Yeah, of course. That was a great event, too. It was very classy. But no, what we did for this party, and we've done it for a couple of conferences, too.
00:21:06.290 - 00:21:47.902, Speaker D: Was anyone in Lisbon for the Lisbon there? We did it as well. But you would actually scan the backside and land on a claim page, and it would be a claim page for that exact edition number. So there was one to 200 out of 200. And when you scanned it, it would be a claim of the digital that this was representing. So the idea of physical first distribution of digital twins, or NFTs, is something that we think is really powerful. When you talk about onboarding, when you talk about activations, campaigns, events and even just how we think about consumer behavior and kind of onboarding, a standard kind of. I bought this thing.
00:21:47.902 - 00:21:55.594, Speaker D: I waited in line. I showed up. I got my head actually, down the street, there's a collectible store that has a line outside of it right now. Do you know what I'm talking about? On.
00:21:55.652 - 00:21:56.478, Speaker A: I haven't.
00:21:56.654 - 00:21:57.746, Speaker D: Did you see the line?
00:21:57.848 - 00:21:58.498, Speaker C: No.
00:21:58.664 - 00:22:01.790, Speaker D: I think it's like shoes. I think it's shoes.
00:22:01.950 - 00:22:03.326, Speaker C: Should we take a break and go get shoes?
00:22:03.358 - 00:22:03.970, Speaker A: Dee?
00:22:04.310 - 00:22:05.922, Speaker D: It was like a 50 person line.
00:22:05.976 - 00:22:06.242, Speaker B: Wow.
00:22:06.296 - 00:22:10.514, Speaker D: On a Sunday morning, it looked like a shoe or a fashion only line.
00:22:10.552 - 00:22:16.246, Speaker C: I've ever waited on in my life. Because I don't know if you know this, these. I don't wait on lines. If I see a line, I'm like, I'm out.
00:22:16.268 - 00:22:17.318, Speaker B: I'm with you on that.
00:22:17.484 - 00:22:25.242, Speaker C: I went to that people thing in New York. I had tickets. I went, there was a line. They're like, oh, they're only letting certain people in at a time. I looked at, I was like, I.
00:22:25.296 - 00:22:30.938, Speaker A: Literally, that's me at every NFT event. Yeah, every NfT text, somebody to get them to bring me in.
00:22:30.944 - 00:22:31.980, Speaker C: Right, exactly.
00:22:32.530 - 00:22:33.550, Speaker A: Airbnb.
00:22:34.290 - 00:22:40.862, Speaker C: So the only line I ever waited on was to see Star wars movies, like at night. I waited like one time for 18 hours.
00:22:40.916 - 00:22:42.430, Speaker B: To see, like 18 hours.
00:22:42.500 - 00:22:46.186, Speaker C: Yes. To see episode one with my brother. We, like, took turns.
00:22:46.218 - 00:22:47.558, Speaker B: But you're also much younger.
00:22:47.594 - 00:22:48.226, Speaker A: 20 years ago.
00:22:48.248 - 00:22:49.186, Speaker C: Yeah, it was a long time.
00:22:49.208 - 00:22:52.370, Speaker B: Yeah. You went for the Harry Potter books. I waited for the Harry Potter books.
00:22:52.710 - 00:22:53.682, Speaker C: This is actually.
00:22:53.816 - 00:22:54.882, Speaker B: Oh, that's beautiful.
00:22:55.016 - 00:22:56.020, Speaker D: Oh, wow.
00:22:57.030 - 00:22:57.826, Speaker C: Pretty cool.
00:22:57.928 - 00:22:59.250, Speaker D: That's incredible.
00:23:00.310 - 00:23:02.578, Speaker C: Why are you doing this? Can you tell us about your artists?
00:23:02.674 - 00:23:12.618, Speaker A: Yeah. So the piece I picked is once upon a mushroom by an artist I love called Cat Dirty. And he's known for his lowbrow, psychedelic, trippy art.
00:23:12.704 - 00:23:13.402, Speaker D: I mean, it's beautiful.
00:23:13.456 - 00:23:15.338, Speaker A: This is his super rare genesis piece.
00:23:15.424 - 00:23:15.882, Speaker D: Oh, wow.
00:23:15.936 - 00:23:37.730, Speaker A: And it also has music that he makes. He's really big into composing music to go with all of his animations. So that's something I really like about him. He's like this multi talented artist who's not only making really nice animations that I love and vibe with. But the music is like, I want to say, like, arctic monkeys kind of, like, funkier.
00:23:40.150 - 00:23:41.474, Speaker C: One of my favorite pieces you have.
00:23:41.512 - 00:24:06.358, Speaker A: Yeah, I showed it at the NFP NYCC event on the movie theater with the surround sound. So it's like you're getting hit by it. It definitely hits on a different point, but, yeah, I felt like I was looking through my collection. I was like, I got to take a super rare piece. I'm like, what will look nice? Like, rectangularly? What's nice? And animated? And then that being his genesis, and I don't have any physicals of his, so I was like, that'd be like, a perfect way to start collecting.
00:24:06.454 - 00:24:10.106, Speaker B: You're a very big physicals guy, right? I remember you always posting, I don't.
00:24:10.128 - 00:24:12.810, Speaker C: Know, he needs a bigger house.
00:24:12.880 - 00:24:39.700, Speaker A: I have a couple of castamards. Like, really big capsamards. Bigger than that, up on the wall. Like, four jubus J's, all above my fireplace. Two different renditions of my punk. One kind of laser sketched into wood, and then the other one is just a acrylic painting, a bunch of killer acid woodblock prints, Zade kurdzes, and then everything else is still in tubes. Like, I have a pop wonder.
00:24:39.700 - 00:24:55.878, Speaker A: I have two pop wonders. I need to go bring to a framer. Ack. I need to go bring to a framer. I don't have any room in my house to hang more stuff. And I just bought a killer acid, like, acrylic painting on wood that's getting shipped at the end of the month when this gallery is done. And it's going to go right above where I take my GM picks.
00:24:55.878 - 00:25:03.020, Speaker A: But it's like the last spot I have in my house that was open, and now I'm like, all right, I need to buy another house to put art in.
00:25:03.630 - 00:25:05.002, Speaker C: That's why you need to buy another house.
00:25:05.056 - 00:25:06.094, Speaker B: We need a bull market again.
00:25:06.132 - 00:25:07.280, Speaker C: Yeah, we need a bull market.
00:25:08.530 - 00:25:12.720, Speaker B: My wife reminds me all the time, she's like, oh, next bull market. I'm not going to let you not sell.
00:25:14.130 - 00:25:16.042, Speaker A: That's what my wife told me in 2017.
00:25:16.106 - 00:25:20.626, Speaker C: 2018. But it was an order. It was like, orders of magnitude different.
00:25:20.728 - 00:25:22.818, Speaker B: Yeah, this was my first cycle, so I learned a lot.
00:25:22.904 - 00:25:36.018, Speaker C: That was my second cycle. That's why I bought a house in 2017. So my artist, not very well known. His name is not very well known. His name is DK. And this guy here, I think he plays golf.
00:25:36.114 - 00:25:39.414, Speaker A: Why'd you pick Tiger woods? Of all the. Let's walk.
00:25:39.532 - 00:25:54.190, Speaker C: So, to be honest with you, it's my only. Let's walk that I own with a friend. This guy who I'm friends with. He loved it when I showed him nfts at the beginning, so he bought it and he's like, oh, he fell in love with NFTs because of this. Fucking realize what?
00:25:54.260 - 00:26:08.994, Speaker A: Yeah, we should have got clockwork Metropolis put into one of these. That's a fucking massive fail. We could do it. Yeah, we'll get it done. This is one piece we co collect that is like this beautiful animated piece. I just bought it like two months.
00:26:09.032 - 00:26:12.222, Speaker C: Two months. Because I only looked through my vault.
00:26:12.286 - 00:26:13.662, Speaker A: When I was making the decision.
00:26:13.726 - 00:26:14.226, Speaker C: No, it's good.
00:26:14.248 - 00:26:17.090, Speaker A: And then I forget, like, oh, my God, we don't.
00:26:17.690 - 00:26:19.954, Speaker C: I feel like that one on the larger.
00:26:20.002 - 00:26:21.266, Speaker D: Yeah, we can put it on the XL.
00:26:21.298 - 00:26:42.602, Speaker C: This is the myself, obviously, Ian and will like who I collect with, my partners and norcal. I don't know, like four or five months ago, I text, everybody's like, you know what? It's a bear market. Let's try to find some steels. Yeah. And connect know, because that's how we started collecting three years ago. It's like, let's do it again.
00:26:42.736 - 00:26:44.334, Speaker A: That's kind of how I met Sergito, in a way.
00:26:44.372 - 00:26:46.282, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. Metaverse Dow.
00:26:46.346 - 00:26:47.758, Speaker A: We met in metaverse Dow and we.
00:26:47.764 - 00:26:48.494, Speaker C: Were just, all right.
00:26:48.612 - 00:27:28.010, Speaker A: Sets together to put on events in the metaverse and it was like, throw in five e's, whatever, hop in. And then next thing you know, we're doing the 4156, we're doing rare pepes, and then neon Dow all happened and it's like, well, that was like the quickest six months of our life. But you're just coming together because it's like, well, I can't afford hard to buy a bunch of land and do all the work to promote it, but I can come together and help. And I think that's popular in NFTs, but going to get more popular as the gets better because the tools when we started was just gnosis. It was before it was called safe. And wallet Connect really wasn't a thing. Now at least you can wallet connect, have people sign and do something.
00:27:28.010 - 00:27:34.646, Speaker A: Back then, it was like pulling teeth to try to get everyone to use the tools. I think a couple co collecting tools.
00:27:34.678 - 00:27:36.766, Speaker C: Get bigger and I think co collecting is going to be big.
00:27:36.788 - 00:27:41.242, Speaker A: And I know it's all on trust right now. We're going to put it in a multi sig.
00:27:41.306 - 00:27:43.514, Speaker C: By the time you watch this podcast, it's going to be safe.
00:27:43.562 - 00:27:52.206, Speaker A: Yeah. Benny's never set up a multi sig. So I got to walk him through that. But it's like one of those things like coke collecting is really fucking.
00:27:52.238 - 00:28:09.734, Speaker C: I have so many. Honestly, between will, myself and Ian, we have so many wallets now. The other day we were like, on allow list or something. And, okay, he's like, which wallet? So he's like, yeah, Benny, can you get. I was like, sure. And I was like, wait, fuck, which wallet? Which computer? I have like 18 computers. The 52 wallets.
00:28:09.734 - 00:28:11.660, Speaker C: I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing with this.
00:28:12.910 - 00:28:14.822, Speaker A: The benefit to Benny's madness.
00:28:14.966 - 00:28:42.530, Speaker C: Totally. I mean, there's a method to it, I think, but whatever. Talking about collecting. Let's talk about you, Sergio, because you just mentioned this is your first cycle, and we've talked about this before. I mean, your journey into this is kind of interesting and where you're at now and sort of really, like, it must be crazy because let's be honest, from what you started to where you are now in this community is a big leap, right?
00:28:42.680 - 00:28:44.690, Speaker B: You mean I had money now? I don't.
00:28:47.930 - 00:29:11.510, Speaker C: Exactly, but not just money. I mean, you're working fireblocks. You're working with some amazing people, like Raul, Paul. And I think that you have your own podcast. I know you're in a ton of, like, just a lot of things that you're working on. It shows that how fast this space works, but it shows that if you put your effort and time into it, that you can really grow really pretty rapidly.
00:29:11.590 - 00:29:42.966, Speaker B: Oh, thanks for that. Yeah, I think you guys kind of hit it on the head when you mentioned co collecting work with other people. I think the network that you build early on really allows you to, if you want to do this more long term, having the right group of friends, right network, talking to artists early on really changes that trajectory. And honestly, I didn't know what I was doing. I think most of us when we come to web3 have no idea. I remember hitting up Deez and being like, yo, what are we doing? And he'll be like, I don't know either. Let's figure out.
00:29:42.966 - 00:30:00.854, Speaker B: And we got rocked together on some shitcoins. And then I remember you told me to mint Fidenzas. And I was like, the last five times you told me to mint something, it went to zero. So I'm not going to mint that. No. But going back to early punks, discord, I came to NFTs because I was bored at work. I used to work on Wall Street.
00:30:00.854 - 00:30:31.282, Speaker B: I used to write a morning note every single day, sent out a bunch of hedge fund traders and the like. And my notes were always a little bit different than your typical market summary. Like, S P went down this and that. My notes were like talking about Reddit posts, people talking, know, doing random things that had to do with finance, but not really your typical stuff. And that's when I came across Defi first, I had made a connection with Ralph Powell from real Vision because we're both former Goldman Sachs. And he sent me some stuff on Defi. And I was reading it, I was like, this is like weird.
00:30:31.282 - 00:30:44.950, Speaker B: I wanted the curve the site looks like. So, you know, before NFT, we had interacted before. Yes. And then I signed up for the Defiant, I think it was, and they made an article on G Money buying his apunk for like 140 grand.
00:30:45.030 - 00:30:45.322, Speaker C: Right?
00:30:45.376 - 00:30:55.946, Speaker B: And I laughed. I was like, this is ridiculous. And I wrote a note to my client saying, hey, the dollar is going to be so worthless that people are spending six figures on JPEGs.
00:30:55.978 - 00:30:56.560, Speaker C: Wow.
00:30:57.410 - 00:31:13.022, Speaker B: And then, I don't know. I mean, it's curiosity. I downloaded Discord for the first time in my life. I'm not a gamer, which I think is a big disadvantage in the space. And got onto the punks discord and it just fell down a rabbit hole. I think I came out on the other side, like 48 hours later. I had bought my punk.
00:31:13.022 - 00:31:22.150, Speaker B: It was like six ether at the time. My hands were shaking when I was doing it because I'm like, oh, my God, this is ten K. My wife's like, what are you doing? And I'm like, I just bought like a JPeg. It's a community.
00:31:22.220 - 00:31:25.510, Speaker C: It's Ogs, discord, painting.
00:31:28.430 - 00:31:29.926, Speaker B: Sergio, call me Sergito.
00:31:29.958 - 00:31:30.540, Speaker C: Now.
00:31:31.470 - 00:31:33.130, Speaker B: You're Mrs. Sergito now.
00:31:33.200 - 00:31:34.486, Speaker A: You don't have a name anymore.
00:31:34.598 - 00:31:37.034, Speaker B: She's like, it's Valentine's Day. You totally forgot about me.
00:31:37.072 - 00:31:39.980, Speaker C: I'm like, okay.
00:31:40.350 - 00:31:55.918, Speaker B: And really it was just that, right? Like falling down the rabbit hole and kind of just talking to people, reaching out, making friends, doing things, like experimenting. I think a lot of experimentation. Some went really good, others learned a.
00:31:55.924 - 00:32:00.898, Speaker C: Lesson because that's where Snowfrow started. Also. He told me the same thing. He's like, I think he was the mod.
00:32:01.064 - 00:32:02.946, Speaker A: Snowfrow claimed punks and was in the.
00:32:02.968 - 00:32:04.914, Speaker C: Discord right off the bat.
00:32:04.952 - 00:32:06.686, Speaker B: He claimed 32 zombie punks.
00:32:06.718 - 00:32:07.694, Speaker C: 32 zombie punks.
00:32:07.742 - 00:32:15.846, Speaker A: By the time we were in there, he was like one of the most esteemed people. And it was still. He was like accessible. Completely open.
00:32:16.028 - 00:32:16.566, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:32:16.668 - 00:32:23.650, Speaker B: I dm'd him when I was buying my punk because the floor was running and I was like, yo, what I do? He's like, just buy the one you like from this tune. I just grabbed mine.
00:32:23.730 - 00:32:25.174, Speaker A: Buy the one you like.
00:32:25.372 - 00:32:29.682, Speaker B: Because that's how much ether I had. Liquid. My ether was stuck on Coinbase because I'm not a waiting citizen.
00:32:29.746 - 00:32:31.086, Speaker A: Five business days for them.
00:32:31.108 - 00:32:47.458, Speaker B: No, they wanted all this documentation that I didn't have because it was COVID and every government office was closed. So I had ether. It was just stuck, right? So the only liquid ether that I had was like 6.2 and the floor was like 6.1. And then Snowflake was like, go. And I'm like, all right. Okay.
00:32:47.544 - 00:32:48.180, Speaker C: Click.
00:32:48.870 - 00:32:49.620, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:50.070 - 00:32:55.678, Speaker C: So you started there and then, okay, so then from there, I couldn't stop thinking about NFTs.
00:32:55.774 - 00:33:14.938, Speaker B: I'm obsessed. I think it's latino and just me being me. And I couldn't stop talking about them at work. And it was funny to them for a little bit. They're like, oh, look at this idiot talking about JPeG, blah, blah, blah. But then I started catching on and the clients were really excited about hearing about NFTs. And my boss didn't like that for some reason.
00:33:14.938 - 00:33:19.370, Speaker B: So he's like, stop talking about crypto. Stop talking about NFTs. Nobody cares.
00:33:20.030 - 00:33:20.970, Speaker A: But people do care.
00:33:21.040 - 00:33:45.486, Speaker B: Okay, well, I'm out. So I called a friend who's done really well in the space. He's had like four cycles. I was like, yo, I want a job in crypto. I want to do something that kind of has nothing to do with the market because I've been in the market for twelve years and I know crypto is twenty four seven. And I don't want to put myself in that position where I'm like going crazy 24/7 right? Like nine to five is enough. So he showed me fireblocks, pointed me in that direction.
00:33:45.486 - 00:33:50.758, Speaker B: I really liked what they were doing and pretty much just called them up, said, hey, looking for a job.
00:33:50.924 - 00:33:54.994, Speaker C: So let me understand this. When you tell your wife that you're leaving Goldman Sachs.
00:33:55.042 - 00:33:55.974, Speaker B: Barclays at the time.
00:33:56.012 - 00:34:04.538, Speaker C: Barclays. Thank you. And you're going to go to work full time in crypto. Did she think you had brain damage? Was she okay with this?
00:34:04.624 - 00:34:12.154, Speaker B: I actually, to this date, don't know what she thought. She's very supportive and I adore her.
00:34:12.192 - 00:34:22.110, Speaker C: Because, by the way, I've been in crypto for probably like ten years now, and my wife still thinks I'm playing with something that's not real. She's like, okay, you have fun with your monopoly money.
00:34:22.180 - 00:34:23.118, Speaker D: And she's not wrong.
00:34:23.204 - 00:34:43.366, Speaker C: She's probably not wrong. She's not real, my wife. And she's like, look, she just thinks that I'm playing some kind of video game. But then you have like 30 people over your house. She has a great time. She loves it. She's like, she comes out, but she doesn't realize like it's still real yet.
00:34:43.548 - 00:35:05.690, Speaker B: Same with Mrs. Sergito. It's funny because at first she thought I was maybe like talking to other girls, right? Because I was up on discord. My phone to her was just my phone till four in the morning laughing my ass off. She's like, who are you talking to? I'm like, redbeard, zan dot pigeon. And she's like, the fuck?
00:35:05.770 - 00:35:20.610, Speaker C: She once looked at my phone and I think I was writing to Dave, like something like, really know. I really love you. I want to spend some time with you. I don't know, it was like Kai or something and we were just talking nonsense and she just looked at me and she's like, I don't want to know.
00:35:20.760 - 00:35:21.554, Speaker B: I don't get it.
00:35:21.592 - 00:35:32.966, Speaker C: I don't understand. But yeah, I think it's a weird world that we all live in for anybody who's in it because it's so different from the rest of the world.
00:35:33.068 - 00:35:53.914, Speaker B: It is so different. You know, when it clicked to her and similar to conversation earlier about printing the videos of the NFTs, we got her a punk for her birthday and she made it her LinkedIn profile. And she works at a big hedge fund. She's actually got promoted this last week. She's done very well for herself in very a professional.
00:35:53.962 - 00:35:56.270, Speaker C: You haven't met Mrs. Sergito.
00:35:57.330 - 00:35:58.334, Speaker B: Maybe a real quick one.
00:35:58.372 - 00:36:03.694, Speaker C: Yeah, she's really like out of it. Super smart, super nice. Really.
00:36:03.892 - 00:36:33.642, Speaker B: Well, thanks. She's been very supportive. But when we got her her punk and it became now her identity, right? She was like, okay. She's like, well, put me in the punks telegram and this and that and start asking questions. She will also overhear my calls with like when we're discussing different things that we're doing as a group, some of the metaverse Dow calls and she's like, oh, it reminds me of talking to investment committees at work. It sounds like you guys are doing something similar. And then she saw how happy I was and that for her just did it.
00:36:33.696 - 00:37:02.274, Speaker C: Yeah, I think for me, my wife listened. My wife for what clicked for her was definitely obviously we got to go on any vacation we want. She's like, wait, where's this money I paid for plane. Where'd you buy the plane tickets? I was like, I used ether for it. She's like, okay. But also, I think for her, really, what clicked was, I think it was two things. One is, I think when she started coming out and hanging out with the artists, like, when I was in crypto, she could care less.
00:37:02.274 - 00:37:04.226, Speaker C: Right. But also, when it had to be.
00:37:04.408 - 00:37:05.566, Speaker A: She didn't care about the stratus.
00:37:05.598 - 00:37:29.686, Speaker C: She did not care about stratus. When I told her I was going to London to see the Stratus team, she literally thought I was having an affair just because one of my friends was coming with me. She kind of believed I wasn't. But she has a master's in art history, and so she loved that. And I think also, I'm going to be very honest, there was, like, some women involved back in the shitcoin era, but it was very little. It was tiny.
00:37:29.718 - 00:37:31.734, Speaker A: It was like just all meltdown.
00:37:31.862 - 00:37:34.474, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And she is a legend.
00:37:34.602 - 00:37:36.202, Speaker B: High priestess of the dick boats.
00:37:36.266 - 00:37:58.914, Speaker C: Yeah. And she really is super smart. But there wasn't a lot. So if I ever went to anything, it was just, like, 20 guys and, like, two girls. And she's like, I don't want to be here now. It's like she goes and she hangs out with monairs, and she can hang out with your wife or Sam Spratt's wife, and she's like, oh, there's other people like me. And I think that that's sort of like, now she's more involved and stuff like that.
00:37:59.032 - 00:38:15.340, Speaker B: Yeah, no, we did the all ships retreat. Thanks, Dave, for the invite. And my wife, it was the first time where she also didn't think it's all a bunch of random Internet dudes, and she had a blast. How's your wife? How was that? I would love to hear that, actually.
00:38:16.350 - 00:38:17.882, Speaker A: Just like, how is she in the space?
00:38:18.016 - 00:38:21.402, Speaker B: Or how was the process, too, for you? I don't think I've ever heard it.
00:38:21.456 - 00:38:21.914, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:22.032 - 00:38:38.302, Speaker A: For me, it was like, go back to 2017. I just graduated college. We're living in a one bedroom apartment. My office is our living room. We don't have a living room. Her office is in our bedroom, and we have our bed. And she is socking away a couple of month.
00:38:38.302 - 00:39:10.140, Speaker A: We're working on a house down payment. I'm putting away a couple of month for this house, and then I only have an extra couple of $100 after I put that away to put crypto, but I had a little daily fantasy bankroll that I took all out of Draftkings and fandal and put it all in in 2017. So I thought I was a genius for, like, three months, like, we all did. For the next nine months, I realized I'm the dumbest motherfucker who's ever lived. And I lost all my money. And I had to tell her, like, you know, remember how I thought we'd be able to buy a house outright and, like, me, quit our job? It's all gone.
00:39:11.570 - 00:39:15.326, Speaker C: I've been leveraged on my phone from.
00:39:15.348 - 00:39:54.166, Speaker A: The work bathroom, and after consecutive weeks of just going two x three x five x long and the price going down, me getting liquidated, and maybe, like, this is the bottom, and then it wasn't the bottom. After doing that for so long, it was like, it's gone. Then I started taking the free CFA classes that are online, because I was like, I have no finance background. I have communication major. I spent most of my life just playing video games and no finance background outside of, like, I knew how to trade items in video games, but I didn't really know how to apply that to finance. So I started dollar cost averaging into crypto. I was like, all right, I'm going to buy a couple of hundred of ETH.
00:39:54.166 - 00:40:19.570, Speaker A: And then I was actually really into Tezos way back then, because you could bake Tezos and get 6%. And this was in 2018 or 2019, I think, is when I actually. Early 2019 is when I started buying Tezas. But I was like, oh, I was buying it on Kraken because you needed, like, 8000 Tez to bake it yourself. But if you had less than 8000 Tesla. And they call it baking, but staking, whatever.
00:40:19.640 - 00:40:20.110, Speaker B: French.
00:40:20.190 - 00:40:22.786, Speaker A: Yeah, always about baking something.
00:40:22.888 - 00:40:23.314, Speaker C: Yeah, right?
00:40:23.352 - 00:40:58.894, Speaker A: So anyway, you're sitting there baking your Tezzos on Kraken because I didn't have 8000 because it was, like, $4,000 at the time, and doing that slowly every month, I'm staying in discords, but I'm really worried about just learning about finance stuff. I wasn't really worried about keeping up with crypto. I was like, I need to learn about risk management, portfolio management, diversification, all this shit. So I spent a little bit going down the CFA rabbit hole. I found the invest, like, the best podcast at Patrick O'Shaughnessy, and that's been, like, one of my favorite podcasts ever. So many good people go on there. I went down every day at work.
00:40:58.894 - 00:41:16.594, Speaker A: I'm listening to three of those episodes. I'm just like, I'm a bang these out. I think at the time there wasn't even 100 of them. So I was like, all right, if I listen to three a day, I can get through these in a month. So I did that and kind of started looking at the world a different way through taking risk. At the time, I was government and employee. My wife was a government employee.
00:41:16.594 - 00:41:36.374, Speaker A: We're working a job with very little upside, where we can map out the next 30 years of our life until we fucking die. And it was like, wow, this is depressing. We need to take risks. So I'm over here paying attention to all this shit. Uniswap. Pandemic happened. Pandemic was like the biggest unlock for all of us, because instead of having to go to the office every day, wear my suit and tie, all that shit.
00:41:36.422 - 00:41:37.980, Speaker B: You were a swim tack kind of guy.
00:41:40.350 - 00:41:44.800, Speaker C: We'll stop. Can we get a picture with just covering your face?
00:41:45.570 - 00:41:47.918, Speaker A: I can show you. Can we see what you look like?
00:41:48.084 - 00:41:50.298, Speaker C: Wait, do you still own a suit and tie?
00:41:50.394 - 00:41:53.850, Speaker A: Yes, I only own this one. It's the one I bought when I graduated.
00:41:54.010 - 00:41:54.986, Speaker D: He's got the photo.
00:41:55.018 - 00:41:55.386, Speaker B: He knows.
00:41:55.418 - 00:42:00.370, Speaker C: What photo? You had one suit and you wore it every day. The same suit to work.
00:42:00.440 - 00:42:05.230, Speaker A: Well, I wouldn't wear the jacket. When I say suit and tie, I mean, like, button down shirt.
00:42:05.310 - 00:42:08.126, Speaker C: Okay, we have to see this suit.
00:42:08.158 - 00:42:09.678, Speaker A: Jacket, but I'll pull it up while.
00:42:09.704 - 00:42:13.782, Speaker B: You pull it up, though. I think almost inadvertently. That's such a good lesson for people.
00:42:13.836 - 00:42:22.520, Speaker A: I didn't even know how to do this. Button a suit. Yeah, I didn't know I was supposed to not button both buttons. I went to my interview like that.
00:42:23.450 - 00:42:24.050, Speaker C: Wait a minute.
00:42:24.060 - 00:42:49.042, Speaker B: But it's such a good lesson though, right? Because you kind of, like, got wrecked one cycle and then decided to take a much smarter approach at educating yourself. And then when the next cycle you were able to crush it, I think a lot of people come in and see these and where you are now and everything you've done and achieved and all the stuff you own. And it really wasn't just by shitcoin trading JPEg. You had a method, you had educated yourself.
00:42:49.096 - 00:42:54.498, Speaker A: So, like, going to the pandemic, I'm working on from home. Going in one day a week instead of four, actually.
00:42:54.664 - 00:42:56.050, Speaker B: In a certain tie.
00:42:56.630 - 00:43:23.718, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I'm not wearing. When I go in, I'm still wearing it anyway. I start paying attention. I mean, I'm paying attention to my friends group chats throughout this whole time, but I'm not super active and I start seeing people talk about compound and then I start seeing people talk about uniswap. And I'm like, oh, this is new. These people were really excited about this and they haven't been excited about anything since, like, fucking tezzas in my head, at least. So I'm like, I got to check out uniswap.
00:43:23.718 - 00:43:44.450, Speaker A: So I'm like, on Twitter, I'm looking at what some of my friends are doing, I'm in discord looking at what they're doing, and I'm being a little on the sidelines. Like, this is in June of 2020 and July 2020 happens. And I'm like, I just got to take something and put on unitswap and figure it out. So I go to a new wallet and I send two ETH to it, and I'm like, this is my risk capital.
00:43:45.110 - 00:43:46.910, Speaker B: If I lose like $1,000 at a.
00:43:46.920 - 00:43:54.230, Speaker A: Time, it was probably closer to 400. ETH was like $200 after the pandemic.
00:43:54.650 - 00:43:56.982, Speaker B: It was 700 in December of 2020.
00:43:57.116 - 00:44:01.340, Speaker C: Yeah, but at the beginning of 2020, I remember.
00:44:03.550 - 00:44:29.246, Speaker A: Everything was like, over. So this is like me taking like $400 and putting in uniswap. And I'm like, all right, my goal is to treat ETH like Runescape gold and just make more ETH. I'm not going to worry about, like, us dollar prices. So I am in a telegram chat in July, and someone's mentioning this token called Alif. I put my ETH into it and it went up six x in two weeks. And all I did was put in my ETH into Alif.
00:44:29.246 - 00:44:41.522, Speaker A: Watch it go. And I was still learning about Uniswap, so I didn't want to take any other risk. I knew Alif was like semi legit. Like, I followed the founder. He wasn't ain't on. He was definitely legit. It wasn't like I was just going into like a scam.
00:44:41.586 - 00:44:42.438, Speaker B: You did your research.
00:44:42.524 - 00:45:16.622, Speaker A: Yeah, uniswap broke. But after it hit that multiple, I was like, I need to sell all this. And I started really gambling because my friends were just like, watching this bot and telegram called uniswap new listing bot, and you would have it on alerts. And anytime anybody created a liquidity pool on uniswap, you would get a telegram DM. So we are sitting there all day, and at the time, it's not like now where I'm sure there's a lot more pools, but there wouldn't be something new for like five minutes. You had time to dig in and look at it and we're trading shit like the tendies token that came out. There was xampp.
00:45:16.622 - 00:45:46.950, Speaker A: There were some other tokens that came out, like, neat. It was something that was clearly probably a scam. You would buy it, and then within a day or two, trying to sell it and just hoping it went up. And that was the summer. And during that summer, like, yfI came out, sushi came out, and then all these other food derivatives. Yam was one of the first, but then there was, like, sake and kimchi and all this other shit. And I was like, trading all of this, paying 400 Gwe gas transactions.
00:45:46.950 - 00:46:13.470, Speaker A: Gas was insane. I've never seen gas as bad as it was that summer. It didn't feel as bad because ETH was only $400, but we were paying, like, fucking zero point 25 e to harvest sushi rewards. Because you'd be like, oh, I have five ETH in rewards. I'm going to pay zero point 25 e to harvest, and I'm going to pay another zero point 25 e to make the swap. And I'm still up four and a half e. And that's the game we're playing, is we're just overloading the shit out of ETH.
00:46:13.470 - 00:46:41.098, Speaker A: And eventually, toward the end of September, it started to die down. But in September, I found myself with, like, I don't know, maybe a 50 ETH portfolio coming from this two ETH. And I started to think about diversifying because I was like, when I was trading shitcoins, I would put 0.1 to 0.5 in, and if I would double it, I would take out half. I was like, even if I put in 0.1, I was taking out half because I was so scared from what happened last time when I didn't do that.
00:46:41.098 - 00:47:07.666, Speaker A: So I was like, all right, if I make two x, take out half, ride it, take out multiples, whatever. Trill, who has been trading Trill is somebody I met 2017, one of my first friends in the space. We're still in telegrams all these years later, and we're talking about shitcoins. And at some point, he just stopped talking about shitcoins and started talking about punks. And he's like, I'm going to buy a zombie punk with some of the money we made. You should buy a zombie punk. And it was snowfrow selling his punks that found art blocks at the same time.
00:47:07.666 - 00:47:21.382, Speaker A: So they were like, 15 grand. And I was like, dude, risk management, man. That's like, over 30 E. That's like, over half my portfolio. I can't buy a fucking zombie. So I buy a floor. And after that, by the way, which.
00:47:21.436 - 00:47:22.742, Speaker C: Probably was not the wrong move.
00:47:22.796 - 00:47:25.778, Speaker A: No, I mean, I could have made more money if I bought the zombie.
00:47:25.794 - 00:47:26.982, Speaker C: But you might have also not.
00:47:27.036 - 00:47:49.086, Speaker A: I might have flipped it for a two X or something. Yeah. Anyway, way I buy my first punk, I flip it for $400 and I'm like, a light bulb goes off in my head that this is like, I'm playing runescape trading. The most expensive item I used to market make the most expensive item in runescape. So I was like, wow, that feels a lot like punks. We have ETH, which is runescape gold. We have a very rare limited item, and we have people who I think are going.
00:47:49.086 - 00:48:20.586, Speaker A: The people I thought, who are going to buy punks are going to be like natively rich east people. If you made a bunch of money on uniswap, it's like, why would you not show off that you made a bunch of money by buying a punk? That was kind of my very simple thesis. So that's how I got into punks. All the while I'm doing this, my wife is very supportive, just like yours, but not super into it. She's just like, you're clearly doing well or you're doing something, but she wouldn't want to learn about it. And I bought her her punk for like 20 some E. Is that the.
00:48:20.608 - 00:48:21.830, Speaker B: Straight blonde one with the VR?
00:48:21.910 - 00:48:39.454, Speaker A: Yeah. That's a beautiful. That's like my forever. That and my hoodie will be the pair forever. But once I got her that punk, I feel like that was around the time where she started paying a little more attention. And then she got a bit into Azuki and Clonex. When those came out, she picked out one she really liked.
00:48:39.454 - 00:48:54.150, Speaker A: So those are always her avatars on like, we actually sold the Azuki rip. I've regret that. Sold the Azuki, like, at the bottom, we were like trying to lighten the bag. And she's like, I don't really need a $30,000 avatar.
00:48:54.650 - 00:49:07.274, Speaker C: Okay, well, you don't need. Let's be honest, I bought at the top with Ian and Will. We bought some crazy stuff. I think we bought a cat for like $96,000.
00:49:07.472 - 00:49:11.738, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. I bought moonbirds over 100,000.
00:49:11.824 - 00:49:18.110, Speaker C: We bought one parallel card that we actually still own. That one we haven't harvested for around like $110,000.
00:49:18.180 - 00:49:21.166, Speaker A: It was a crazy time because we weren't paying attention to the US dollar value, right?
00:49:21.188 - 00:49:22.510, Speaker C: No, it was so high.
00:49:22.580 - 00:49:30.722, Speaker A: I got in that mindset of this is my runescape gold, but it's going to go up first, the dollar, rather than down, because runescape just gets inflated due to how the game works.
00:49:30.776 - 00:49:41.398, Speaker C: But sometimes you make those bets. I'm not upset about the bet we made like on Fibo and stuff like that. I think it comes down to risk management. I think what you're saying, well, I.
00:49:41.404 - 00:49:43.378, Speaker A: Mean, look at my friends with you statue.
00:49:43.474 - 00:49:43.782, Speaker C: What?
00:49:43.836 - 00:49:45.986, Speaker A: Look at my friends with you statue, like this hoodie I'm wearing.
00:49:46.018 - 00:49:46.214, Speaker C: Correct.
00:49:46.252 - 00:49:48.920, Speaker A: I mean, that was a horrible experience.
00:49:49.370 - 00:49:54.874, Speaker C: Well, yes. Let's not get into too much detail. No, it wasn't a good bet, but.
00:49:54.912 - 00:50:00.150, Speaker A: I managed my risk and the losses were contained to the risk that I managed.
00:50:00.310 - 00:50:10.282, Speaker B: Surviving. Right. I think you guys have been through more than one cycle. What I gather from just looking around the space is just survive, make sure you risk, manage, survive.
00:50:10.426 - 00:50:29.126, Speaker A: And I think you can't let yourself check out too much. If you lose the curiosity or the fascination with what you're doing, you're going to miss those artists who put out an open edition for 0.1. That goes to 0.5 or you're going to miss the next.
00:50:29.308 - 00:50:31.478, Speaker C: But it's hard, you can't keep up with everything.
00:50:31.564 - 00:50:31.814, Speaker B: No.
00:50:31.852 - 00:50:51.366, Speaker C: So it's one of those things also that, this is what I've learned, is that I have no regrets. Right. I probably should have some regrets. And for years I thought I had regrets. More recently I started realizing I can't have regrets.
00:50:51.558 - 00:50:52.794, Speaker B: Just getting old, man.
00:50:52.912 - 00:51:17.620, Speaker C: Probably because I'm getting old. Yeah, but also just because, look, I think what these is saying is so important. I remember in 2015, right, when Mount Gox happened, right? I mean, those people were not doing risk management well enough, right? They had all their shit in Mount Gox. I mean, there was a guy and he had like 15,000 BTC in Mount Gox. It was nuts. Why would you put it all in one space?
00:51:18.150 - 00:51:19.154, Speaker A: Mount Gox time.
00:51:19.192 - 00:51:39.210, Speaker C: Same thing with FTX. And it's like, you think people would learn their lessons. I think what you say about survival is really, also really comes down to what Deez is talking about. It's like, okay, I just tweeted this today. I don't know if you guys saw it. I wrote, it's great to make 5 million, but it's also okay to make three and a half million. You could take profit.
00:51:39.210 - 00:52:07.410, Speaker C: I know you always want to think like, oh, the next thing is going to make me more money, next thing is going to make me more money. But that is like the wrong way to play this game, because you can't play the game that way. Especially when I tell artists all the time, pay your rent. Right? That's the first thing. There's nothing more important than paying rent or buying a house or buying an apartment or property. You have to take certain risks that are smart. And I think that risk management part is really, really important that most people don't get in this space.
00:52:07.480 - 00:52:10.582, Speaker A: Joe, you mentioned you founded Infinite objects five years ago.
00:52:10.636 - 00:52:11.350, Speaker D: Yeah, that's right.
00:52:11.420 - 00:52:15.202, Speaker A: We got to get into, like. So you founded that in 2017. 2018.
00:52:15.346 - 00:52:17.270, Speaker D: It was 2018.
00:52:19.290 - 00:52:38.480, Speaker A: Were you looking at the space at the time? Because at the time, really, all that I think of in 2018 that existed was kitties and punks. What made you realize that early that, holy shit, we need these. You're earlier than I was nfts. So I'm definitely curious to hear the backstory on that.
00:52:39.010 - 00:52:50.830, Speaker D: So I wasn't, when I founded the company, I was not thinking about NFTs. I actually didn't buy a crypto kitty. Cryptokitty was my first NFT until 2019.
00:52:50.910 - 00:52:51.250, Speaker A: Nice.
00:52:51.320 - 00:53:03.014, Speaker D: And my punk was actually gifted to me. I'll tell you that story later in 2020. But when I founded the company, I was working at Giphy, the gif search engine.
00:53:03.132 - 00:53:04.678, Speaker C: Oh, I use that thing all the time.
00:53:04.844 - 00:53:09.846, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, gifs are still. They're kind of dead now, but everything's kind of dead now.
00:53:09.868 - 00:53:10.840, Speaker C: Everything's dead.
00:53:12.030 - 00:53:33.106, Speaker D: But, yeah, the thesis was just today. Video and moving image content is how we tell stories. It's how we make art. It is how we sell shit. Video is so important to this generation. And, like, TikTok was starting to blow up. Instagram Stories were now way more popular than the grid on Instagram, even in 2018.
00:53:33.106 - 00:53:39.134, Speaker D: And so when I started the company, it came out of R and D that I was doing with Giphy.
00:53:39.182 - 00:53:39.442, Speaker A: Nice.
00:53:39.496 - 00:54:28.274, Speaker D: We were doing, like, AR and VR, a lot of software, and we launched several things and apps and stuff. But I started pitching the founder there, who is now on my board, on hardware ideas and thinking about how we experience and consume digitally native content, which all moving images and video are in a physical format. And so a lot of the experiments were really weird, bizarre form factors, some really small, some really big. Some of them were connected to different data streams and automatically do. And then one of the prototypes was just like, what if you are buying this display with that piece of content, whatever that is, and you can never change it? And that was the beginning. That was the moment was like, okay, this is worth exploring because this is not just about art. Right.
00:54:28.274 - 00:55:07.006, Speaker D: Which it makes a lot of sense because you can create scarcity with this idea. You could say this is one of ten, this is one of 100. Then the idea of entertainment in general, whether that is sports or whether that is film and TV, or whether that is really anything that we see or is sold to us. And then the third category is user generated content. And that's still a huge part of our company or of our revenue, is people printing video of, like, personal videos. Personal videos of their kids, of their wife. I got to get some for their vacation, of their dogs, like, oh, my God, so many dog videos or dog videos.
00:55:07.006 - 00:55:21.570, Speaker D: We love dogs. We love dogs. But my point is that video is how we remember things. Video is how we document our lives. Videos. But it's never elevated beyond a double tap in Instagram or a swipe in TikTok. So that was the thesis.
00:55:21.570 - 00:56:04.318, Speaker D: But we launched with art, and we launched with art very specifically because we obviously were manufacturing just a few hundred units at a time, right? This is at the end of 2019 when we launched the company at the new museum. We did a big event at the new museum, had rhizome. Do you know rhizome? That's their digital art arm. At the new museum, they co curated, like, twelve artists, and each artist created a piece that was additioned between twelve or 15 and 50 or something like very small addition sizes. And we told the story of video prints through the lens of art. And I mean, I think that's brilliant because I think all new ideas come from art. I think art is how we innovate things.
00:56:04.318 - 00:56:32.086, Speaker D: I think art is always that kind of. And I think NFTs are a great example of that as well. Art is just the first application of NFTs. We've been talking about art this entire time. But that's the tip of the iceberg of the use case of what the concept of a non fungible token will become in terms of application. But that aside, we launched the user generated content product a few months later. And so NFTs came into our purview when super Rare launched.
00:56:32.086 - 00:56:51.040, Speaker D: I actually know I was talking to a company called digital objects. Do you guys remember digital objects? They died in the 2018 really collapse, but they started in 2017 with ERC 720, or not ERC 721, but a version of it. And it was all art. And there's a couple. Did you kill them?
00:56:53.190 - 00:56:53.940, Speaker B: No.
00:56:55.910 - 00:57:01.954, Speaker D: Yeah. Anyway, I met with them multiple times, but then they transitioned and they left.
00:57:02.072 - 00:57:21.226, Speaker C: So I think for the two of you, ownership is something very important. And I think the crypto space is enticing to both you and this idea of provenance and reaching people who usually don't have opportunities. You're both from South America, and I know that's something really important to the two of you.
00:57:21.248 - 00:57:22.582, Speaker B: That Mexico's in North America.
00:57:22.646 - 00:57:26.330, Speaker C: Sorry, Mexico in North America.
00:57:26.750 - 00:57:28.970, Speaker B: I know south of the border gets confusing.
00:57:31.090 - 00:58:03.922, Speaker C: We'll just go with it. But no, I do know that coming from both Mexico and Latin America, it's something both important to you guys that you've spoken about. Know how blockchain and crypto and all these things could reach sort of masses of people that really never have that opportunity because either their government blocked their bank accounts or they don't have the ability to show their art and different things like that. I think it's something that I would like to hear you guys talk about because I know it's something very close to both your hearts.
00:58:04.066 - 00:58:21.274, Speaker D: Sergio is going to have a lot more to say because he has actually worked in Latin America for most of your career. Right. Has been actually working. So, I mean, I can't speak that much to it all. My family is from Lima. I was in Lima in December. And I obviously now always make it a point to meet with someone from the art and creator community.
00:58:21.274 - 00:58:40.094, Speaker D: This time I met with this incredible graffiti artist named Entes. He's really incredible. He's done a couple drops, actually, but he's going to move to Miami in April because he's like, it's dead down. Like. But it was particularly in a terrible situation at the moment, politically and socioeconomic, economically.
00:58:40.142 - 00:58:41.714, Speaker C: And your family has some history, like.
00:58:41.752 - 00:58:51.826, Speaker D: With being some famous. Yes. Yeah. My family does have some political history down. It is. It's not a good situation there, specifically. Mexico is a little bit like, we're.
00:58:51.858 - 00:59:01.002, Speaker B: Lucky to be so close to the states, right? So we're the second largest land border and we import a lot of the culture, everything in Mexico, even the second.
00:59:01.056 - 00:59:04.474, Speaker D: Out of two land borders, Canada being the only other one.
00:59:04.512 - 00:59:38.082, Speaker B: All right, if you want to get cute. Yeah. You're not wrong, I think, for us. And then we have some great mexican artists in this space who, listen, I always think, right, you don't have to tag yourself as Latino, Mexican, peruvian Internet and the ability to be your own identity. Right. That punk with the 3d glass on the pipe or red beard or Sergito really expands your horizons. But at the same time, being aware that people have different opportunities.
00:59:38.082 - 00:59:50.358, Speaker B: Right. So we have great mexican artists in the space, snowfrow being one of them, neurocolor Mojara. We have had people who lived in Mexico is amazing. Incredible, incredible human being.
00:59:50.444 - 01:00:01.494, Speaker C: And I finally met him in Mexico. We all went to Mexico City together. Sorry you missed. Was. We'll talk about that in a second. But it was an amazing experience. But I got to finally meet Newark color and that whole crew.
01:00:01.494 - 01:00:21.874, Speaker C: And it's just, wow, like, there's so much culture here. Mexico City was like popping, but it made me realize I'm working with Nello and JN on this film that they're doing down in Colombia. And at first I was like, I don't know if I want to go with you guys next time. Then after Mexico City, I'm like, no, I'm in. I didn't understand that. Anyways, go on.
01:00:21.992 - 01:01:00.560, Speaker B: No. So obviously with bitcoin first and then now the cryptocurrencies, that kind of removes the power of central authorities to tell you what to do with your money. Now with Ethereum and smart contract chains removes the government power to tell you what to do with your data. So to me, bitcoin is kind of like the global value settlement layers. Like monetary wise, Ethereum is the global data settlement layer. So pictures, videos, just personal information and everything is going to be built on top. And that opens up so many more new things to artists, collectors, participants who are not given the same protections that maybe the US government does give here.
01:01:00.560 - 01:01:20.046, Speaker B: Obviously, still a lot of differences in access to the Internet, to good computers to procreate, iPads and the like. So that's something where we want to focus on using the space for good and to try to help people get up to speed because it is an incredible, just like playground, wide open, blank.
01:01:20.078 - 01:01:49.982, Speaker C: Canvas, amazing artists that you don't hear from sometimes because they don't have the opportunity. I spoke to some artists who do stuff in, you know, like this guy waxhead. And I met him online and I bought his physical art and then he got into NFTs. So I was trying to push him into NFTs. He's like, I'm not doing ether. I found this shows me, he sends me videos sometimes of stuff that he does down there. I'm just like, wow, there's just an opportunity for us to kind of push in that direction, not just in South America or Mexico and other countries as well that probably don't have a chance.
01:01:49.982 - 01:02:14.486, Speaker C: Like Yatreda from like, you know, she said one day you got to get her on because she talks about how NFTs was a way for her express herself digitally throughout the whole world and actually get to a place where she could be in America and have the opportunities that she has. But she said being there, this was that gateway for her.
01:02:14.588 - 01:02:35.578, Speaker B: Yeah. No, it's amazing because both ways. Right. So I was saying how american pop culture influences Mexico and the rest of Latin America a lot. But we also have a ton of native culture. That is not something that you get in the developed countries, just like states and Europe. Obviously, their history there is more like, call it 1700 till today, but we have a lot of native influences.
01:02:35.578 - 01:02:46.406, Speaker B: A lot of, obviously, like the pyramids, the colors are different, the spices are different, and that can come across in art that can really help complement any collection. So, yeah, I'm pretty excited.
01:02:46.458 - 01:02:53.426, Speaker C: You see that a lot in neuro colors art, for sure. He puts that you weren't there, but you have to come next time.
01:02:53.528 - 01:02:54.770, Speaker A: It was after Marfa, right?
01:02:54.840 - 01:02:56.286, Speaker C: It was right after Marfa. Marfa.
01:02:56.318 - 01:02:57.246, Speaker A: So I didn't go to Marfa.
01:02:57.278 - 01:03:00.210, Speaker C: We woke up at 05:00 a.m. Like 04:35 a.m.
01:03:00.360 - 01:03:00.866, Speaker B: True story.
01:03:00.888 - 01:03:03.250, Speaker A: You had, like, an eight hour uber to get the Marfa or some shit.
01:03:03.330 - 01:03:20.830, Speaker C: Oh, that was another. Benny's full of stuff on the way there. Our driver, I told you he found that he was an NFT artist. We actually minted his stuff in the uber. But, yes, that's a long story. We'll do that when we have Eric on. We got up at 05:00 a.m.
01:03:20.830 - 01:03:31.706, Speaker C: Went on this boat, like, in the middle of the city. There was like, it was us three. Will, Dave, Bobby, Bobby, hundreds.
01:03:31.738 - 01:03:32.320, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:03:32.850 - 01:03:33.642, Speaker D: Gabriella.
01:03:33.706 - 01:03:36.866, Speaker C: Gabriella and Tony's two kids, which I didn't even know.
01:03:36.888 - 01:03:37.774, Speaker B: Tony, Tony Herrera.
01:03:37.822 - 01:03:38.610, Speaker C: I had no idea.
01:03:38.760 - 01:03:45.602, Speaker B: Also shout out to Voyu and Ariana, who arranged everything, showed us some great hospitality in Mexico City.
01:03:45.656 - 01:03:53.110, Speaker C: I just texted them. I was like, yeah, we got to do some more stuff. And basically they took us on this crazy boat ride.
01:03:53.450 - 01:04:06.780, Speaker B: It was dark here, I'll explain. So Mexico City was built kind of like Venice. A lot of manmade canals, because that's what they used for agriculture back in the days of the Aztecs and the.
01:04:08.030 - 01:04:16.794, Speaker C: Most of way before America. It's like, way they explain and how they create agriculture way before everybody. It's like, wow, it's pretty shocking.
01:04:16.922 - 01:04:50.422, Speaker B: Yeah. It was obviously hundreds of years ago, and Mexico City is gigantic, right? 22 million people. Most of it is now just like a regular city. But we still have this piece of central Mexico city where you still have those canals and you still have the families that come from those heritage and they still tend to the land, and it's almost like a sacred place. Now, Mexico City sits in a valley between two volcanoes. So you got here early in the morning, you can see the sunrise, and then you can see the volcanoes at distance, and it's just magical. It's something everybody has to experience.
01:04:50.476 - 01:05:05.774, Speaker C: And these people, these farmers are like their families lived there for hundreds of years. Like the two boat guys who were riding us. There was a father and a son, and I couldn't even tell them apart. And they must have been, like, 100 years old each because they just live on the land. It was the craziest thing.
01:05:05.892 - 01:05:06.174, Speaker B: Okay.
01:05:06.212 - 01:05:07.550, Speaker D: Benny wasn't sober.
01:05:10.290 - 01:05:12.542, Speaker C: I didn't know what was going on. I forgot about that part.
01:05:12.596 - 01:05:14.258, Speaker B: I was like, 06:00 a.m. That I remember.
01:05:14.344 - 01:05:16.802, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. The second the sun came up over.
01:05:16.856 - 01:05:18.510, Speaker D: That horizon, it was magic.
01:05:18.590 - 01:05:23.346, Speaker C: It was like I tried to play.
01:05:23.368 - 01:05:28.062, Speaker D: A conchell, but the shaman basically willed the sun to rise.
01:05:28.126 - 01:05:28.734, Speaker C: He really did.
01:05:28.792 - 01:05:32.242, Speaker D: In front of us, there was, like, cows sleeping. There was, like a horse.
01:05:32.386 - 01:05:36.598, Speaker C: So I'm convinced that every morning that guy does that. And if one day he misses the.
01:05:36.604 - 01:05:38.262, Speaker D: Sun, ain't sun just not going to come up?
01:05:38.316 - 01:05:41.640, Speaker C: It literally sleep all day.
01:05:42.170 - 01:05:43.550, Speaker D: It was really messy.
01:05:43.730 - 01:05:44.026, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:05:44.048 - 01:06:12.740, Speaker D: And then after we had another experience. So then we got back into the boats. And this is called Socimugo, this area in New York, in Mexico City, in the middle of the city, but it doesn't feel like you're in the middle of the city. And we land at their house, at their home, at the home of the kind of shaman that was giving us this tour where they actually live. They have a small farm, and they have what's called a temascal. And I'm going to let Sergio explain what that is culturally, because I know it's a thing. It's a mexican thing.
01:06:13.510 - 01:06:24.994, Speaker B: Yeah. So it predates Mexico. It's toltec culture. So Temascal, it's pretty much just this oven built out of the mud. Right. But you can fit six, eight humans.
01:06:25.042 - 01:06:27.090, Speaker D: It's like a mud igloo, if you imagine.
01:06:27.170 - 01:06:27.366, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:06:27.388 - 01:06:28.322, Speaker B: That's the best description.
01:06:28.386 - 01:06:29.954, Speaker D: Structurally, it's like a mud igloo.
01:06:30.002 - 01:06:34.010, Speaker B: And then you get in there, you darken. There's no light coming.
01:06:34.080 - 01:06:36.138, Speaker C: You can't see your hand in front of your face.
01:06:36.304 - 01:06:59.522, Speaker B: And so you put rocks that have been put to the fire for, like, 12 hours. Yeah. Volcanic rocks have been put to the fire for 12 hours or more. So they're really hot. And then you put water on them and so that creates kind of like a natural steam room. And then there's a whole ceremony about cleansing your mind, your spirit, yourself. Thinking about people that you've wronged, thinking about things that you want to do better.
01:06:59.522 - 01:07:10.694, Speaker B: And you go through four stages. They're called doors. Just because there's a door on the demascal, and every time it closes, that's a new door. It's about an hour and 20 minutes.
01:07:10.812 - 01:07:14.806, Speaker C: I cried. I saw stars. It was crazy.
01:07:14.988 - 01:07:16.534, Speaker A: How many grams of mushrooms were you having?
01:07:16.572 - 01:07:20.540, Speaker B: No, I was pretty sober. And it was.
01:07:22.350 - 01:07:31.670, Speaker C: To be fair, at least an 8th, I would say a quarter stars. It was a little crazy, this wormhole, dude.
01:07:31.750 - 01:07:55.042, Speaker B: And it's not religious or anything like that. It's just kind of like talking about. They call the rocks the grandmothers, because they've been around for thousands of years. And so the son creates the fire. So that's like the God, well, the father. And you're taking the lessons from them, and you're using them to really get into your thoughts and try to just better yourself. Again, nothing religious or anything like that, just more like.
01:07:55.096 - 01:07:56.250, Speaker A: That's very spiritual, by the way.
01:07:56.260 - 01:07:57.470, Speaker C: Very spiritual.
01:07:57.630 - 01:08:04.550, Speaker B: And to your own experience, right? There's no preaching. There's nothing. There's just chanting. That allows you to.
01:08:04.620 - 01:08:18.246, Speaker C: This shaman guy, though, I have to tell you. So we saw him. When he takes it off, he just has like a loincloth on. This guy was built like he was 17 men in one guy. I don't even know how to explain. He was like giant. It wasn't muscles.
01:08:18.246 - 01:08:24.442, Speaker C: It was just like girth, but muscles at the same time. He just was wearing a loincloth, dude.
01:08:24.586 - 01:08:26.030, Speaker A: I wonder what he was looking.
01:08:26.100 - 01:08:33.582, Speaker C: I cannot explain to you. I feel like he could have lifted, like, a giant bulldozer over his head. It was just a great experience.
01:08:33.636 - 01:08:36.266, Speaker A: And after, he might have been holding it once you close.
01:08:36.308 - 01:08:47.266, Speaker C: Correct. He was just holding it above. That's how. Exactly. That's how strong he was, man. It was crazy. That was actually one of my best experiences I had.
01:08:47.368 - 01:09:00.642, Speaker B: I'd love to hear that next time we got to have everybody's welcome to Mexico. Reach out to Ariana at Vo. I think, though, that is actually a great. The fact that you experienced that because of NFTs, right? In a way like that linkage.
01:09:00.706 - 01:09:16.846, Speaker C: No, it was that community. Look, I think that a lot of the. Again, I go back to back in the shitcoin days, I was friends with a lot of people. I had a pretty big account. I changed my account since then, but I haven't kept in touch with a ton of those people.
01:09:16.948 - 01:09:17.262, Speaker B: Right.
01:09:17.316 - 01:09:27.286, Speaker C: Just because they were never really real relationships. I feel like what we're building here and everything, it's just like, no, there's something more tangible to it that you make that connection.
01:09:27.338 - 01:09:28.050, Speaker B: Family almost.
01:09:28.120 - 01:09:28.354, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:09:28.392 - 01:09:40.418, Speaker B: I remember the first time I actually met you at nftNYC, and we said hi to each other, had never seen our faces, and I gave you a hug. And I remember I told my wife, that's the most honest hug I've felt in a long time.
01:09:40.504 - 01:09:41.446, Speaker D: He's a good hugger, though.
01:09:41.468 - 01:09:43.954, Speaker C: He's a good hugger, by the way. He gives me great hugs.
01:09:44.002 - 01:09:44.662, Speaker D: Amazing hug.
01:09:44.716 - 01:09:50.646, Speaker C: Well, the first time we met, we didn't hug because we weren't like. I don't think we realized we were each other until the end. No.
01:09:50.668 - 01:10:03.082, Speaker A: We were at a photography dinner with, like, 25 people, and there was probably only, like, five collectors. But it was like I was sitting here, and then Benny was like, a seat or two to my left. You're right there. I just didn't realize talking, but we didn't really.
01:10:03.136 - 01:10:05.534, Speaker C: I don't think we realized we were who we were each other yet.
01:10:05.572 - 01:10:07.210, Speaker A: I remember, thought he was a photographer.
01:10:07.370 - 01:10:11.434, Speaker C: I could look like a photographer. He must have been on the older photographer.
01:10:11.482 - 01:10:12.810, Speaker B: A bathroom over a kimono.
01:10:12.890 - 01:10:15.594, Speaker C: No, I was actually dressed. Totally.
01:10:15.642 - 01:10:17.434, Speaker A: We were at a cuban restaurant in art Basel.
01:10:17.482 - 01:10:24.658, Speaker C: It was actually really 2021, but, yeah, it's funny. And then after. Oh, yeah. And then we realized it, and then.
01:10:24.824 - 01:10:26.914, Speaker A: We'Ve been pretty good friends ever since.
01:10:26.952 - 01:10:40.486, Speaker C: That's hitter. Now I get hugs all the times. It's very important. No, I do agree. I think it's a lot like family. I met joe, and I tell you, I met you in mexico. We hit it off, right? Just recently.
01:10:40.486 - 01:10:48.780, Speaker C: It's the same thing. Talking about my relationship with eric or Dave. We met people, like, what, a year, two, three years ago?
01:10:49.150 - 01:11:21.046, Speaker B: Everybody that I'm friends with today. It's so funny because you guys talked about being together at the same table and not knowing who the other person was. I was with g money at the christie's punk event, and we had, like, a little private showing with noah at the time and aaron wright from flamingo. Everybody was there. And wilcox was a legend in the punks community for claiming, what, a thousand punks. We walked around for 2 hours like christie's, and I had no idea who they were until the end. And I told g money, I'm like, yo, so again, what was your name? And he's like, oh, give me his name.
01:11:21.046 - 01:11:24.022, Speaker B: And then, okay. And then he goes, I'm g money.
01:11:24.076 - 01:11:27.814, Speaker C: And I'm like, oh, shit, because of you.
01:11:27.852 - 01:11:40.380, Speaker B: And you do look like you're ape. He's lost a lot of weight now he's like a model. Like, damn, I saw that picture with people he posted from Milan. I was like, wow, I didn't know he was a Runway know.
01:11:40.750 - 01:11:48.750, Speaker C: I used to say worked out a lot since I used to say benny. And then people would talk to me and then I would say red beard, like, wait, you're redbeard now?
01:11:48.820 - 01:11:51.120, Speaker A: Do that shit where you introduce yourself as.
01:11:53.090 - 01:11:53.466, Speaker C: Fuck.
01:11:53.498 - 01:11:53.838, Speaker A: That.
01:11:53.924 - 01:11:56.526, Speaker C: I did change, by the way. I changed my name on Twitter.
01:11:56.638 - 01:11:57.202, Speaker D: Oh, really?
01:11:57.256 - 01:11:58.020, Speaker C: You did?
01:12:00.070 - 01:12:01.778, Speaker A: Oh, that means the red beard or.
01:12:01.784 - 01:12:02.340, Speaker C: Whatever.
01:12:05.110 - 01:12:07.700, Speaker B: Ghost of Mexico ones I changed to.
01:12:11.610 - 01:12:14.662, Speaker D: Yeah, that's pretty good.
01:12:14.716 - 01:12:16.358, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought it was just a change.
01:12:16.444 - 01:12:18.870, Speaker A: Betty isn't the best at branding and.
01:12:18.940 - 01:12:37.498, Speaker C: Keeping a brand red beard makes sense now. I just say I'm hi, Betty Redbeard, and like, oh, okay. It makes a lot people know your face now, too. Yeah, I'm not. My last account, when I was shitcoin era, I was totally anon. And this time I'm like, fuck it, I'm not paying that game. It's just too annoying.
01:12:37.498 - 01:12:41.182, Speaker C: I don't really care. The truth is, everybody knows what I do and where I live.
01:12:41.236 - 01:12:56.706, Speaker A: Cannot collect NFTs and be social and not at least dox the wallet that you're doing. Correct. Dox the wallet. Then you start coming to events. You dox. It's like, I'm still not doxed, but I feel like I am because so many people know what I am, right?
01:12:56.728 - 01:12:58.706, Speaker C: I mean, at this point, I feel like everybody knows who you are.
01:12:58.728 - 01:13:01.174, Speaker A: NFTs are so social. It's like, how can you not put.
01:13:01.212 - 01:13:01.954, Speaker B: Yourself in the mix?
01:13:02.002 - 01:13:05.106, Speaker A: You're missing so much of the space if you're not physically.
01:13:05.138 - 01:13:22.380, Speaker C: And I get, like, some collectors that we both know that are really high end collectors, they don't. And I get it because some of them are families. They want to be careful. And I get that. Look, for me, my stuff's almost all off chain in a bank, so I don't care.
01:13:23.070 - 01:13:24.650, Speaker A: His students can look him up.
01:13:24.720 - 01:13:56.546, Speaker C: Yeah, well, no one knows my Twitter account. Really? A few people, but Brian? No, he hasn't leaked it. Brian. He's a pretty big collector. One day I was listening to Farok, was doing a spaces, and this guy Brian was talking, and I'm like, that sounds really familiar. I texted him, do I know you? He's like, do I know you? Is your last name this? He's like, how'd you know that? I was like, yo, it's Benny. He's like, my favorite.
01:13:56.546 - 01:14:07.626, Speaker C: And then I was like. He's like, what are you doing here? He's like, wait, you're redbeard? I was like, yeah. He's like, what? He's like, I had no clue. And then, yes, it's funny, but it's small world sometimes.
01:14:07.728 - 01:14:30.206, Speaker B: It's incredible. I'm really just loving being part of the community. It's wild how you just built this brand new friendship with a bunch of people from my world. Before, when I was on the trading desk, it was just finance guys, right? And it was very tristate area. Everybody went to the same colleges. They all live in Long island or Connecticut or, like Jersey, and that's it. And I'm mexican and I have an accent.
01:14:30.206 - 01:14:42.374, Speaker B: I've been here for 20 years, but I still have a freaking accent. And I think different than they do. And so I always felt like an outsider, even though I have a good job, good position, and like, here we're all a bunch of fucking weirdos, but.
01:14:42.412 - 01:14:43.958, Speaker C: We fit together and it's nice.
01:14:44.044 - 01:14:55.882, Speaker B: We're amazing. And everybody values who you are, your voice, you can really represent who you want to be, and there's no need to put yourself within this box of like, oh, trader at Wall street, whatever.
01:14:55.936 - 01:15:25.166, Speaker C: I agree. I'll go a step further. I know we still have room to grow on this, but there is something nice about web3, specifically in the NFT space, even though we don't like to use the word nfts, the digital art space, that it's more inclusive. And I think that African Americans, women, people from South America, there's an opportunity for North America. North America.
01:15:25.198 - 01:15:25.646, Speaker B: Thanks. Peace.
01:15:25.678 - 01:15:26.690, Speaker C: North America.
01:15:27.210 - 01:15:29.400, Speaker A: People from south of the United States.
01:15:31.530 - 01:16:01.070, Speaker C: South or north? By the way. By the way, Canada. Canada is just as, you know, just like South America to me, Canada is big. Yeah. But also just like, know bring people together. I think there's an opportunity, and I know we have ways to go, and I get it of work to do, but I do think we're a little bit of a step ahead of other people. And it's a good start because I go to dinners and I go to events, and it's a mixed group.
01:16:01.070 - 01:16:26.454, Speaker C: I remember when I used to do the crypto stuff and all it was was white men. Like I said before, all it was was just like, white men, white men, white men. Now it's like, okay, we have this opportunity where there's a lot more people involved. And I think that that's something really nice about what we're building, and I think it'll get better. And again, I'm not saying it's perfect. And I know there's people like, well, this and this. But I talked to Ed Balloon about this and I love Ed.
01:16:26.454 - 01:16:41.994, Speaker C: Ed's like, this is my opportunity because he feels strongly that this is a space where people accept him for who he is and what his music is and his genre. And I think it's really nice that we could give everybody an opportunity rather than just a small, select few people.
01:16:42.032 - 01:16:50.320, Speaker B: I think that's a key word, right? The opportunity. Everybody. You had your opportunity when you came in. You had your opportunity to build your company. I have an opportunity to ship post.
01:16:51.250 - 01:16:51.806, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:16:51.908 - 01:16:54.158, Speaker C: It is all about done more than a shit post.
01:16:54.244 - 01:17:04.210, Speaker B: Giving people the opportunity to be who they want to be and kind of like, run with it. Yeah. If it works great, doesn't mean everybody's going to work out. We're still human.
01:17:04.280 - 01:17:15.718, Speaker C: Right. Listen, unfortunately, there's still cycles and there's correct. There's still situations and it's hard. I keep trying to tell people this is not an easy place to survive. Right.
01:17:15.884 - 01:17:22.098, Speaker A: What percent of NFT traders do you think have, like, people who've bought NFT, do you think have made profit?
01:17:22.194 - 01:17:23.302, Speaker C: Do you really want me to be honest?
01:17:23.356 - 01:17:29.274, Speaker A: Yeah. Percent wise, I think I've seen some data on this. I'll probably botch it, misremember it.
01:17:29.312 - 01:17:32.826, Speaker C: So my guess off, I would ask NFT statistics because he's like, I think.
01:17:32.848 - 01:17:35.098, Speaker A: He might have been pulling my bot statistics.
01:17:35.114 - 01:17:47.610, Speaker C: I feel like I should just text him and ask him right now. But if I had to say offhand profit that they took out, let me ask the question. Did they take out profit to the bank? Or are you talking about still in profit at this moment?
01:17:47.700 - 01:17:49.282, Speaker A: Just still in profit at this moment.
01:17:49.336 - 01:17:53.522, Speaker C: So I would say probably still in profit this moment. Maybe 2020. 5%.
01:17:53.576 - 01:17:54.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the numbers are on 15.
01:17:54.872 - 01:17:57.330, Speaker B: I was going to say 15. Yeah, there's a lot of people came in last.
01:17:57.400 - 01:18:04.050, Speaker A: It's brutal. I want people to know that. That means if there's 100 people in a room, there's only 15 people who've actually made money in this space trade.
01:18:04.130 - 01:18:19.702, Speaker B: If you come in thinking of profit, unless you're really good at that, you're going to not get the profit. And that's why I think complementing it with expanding your horizons, educating yourself in financial stuff. I was a CFA I stopped paying the dues.
01:18:19.766 - 01:18:20.282, Speaker C: Right.
01:18:20.416 - 01:18:21.834, Speaker B: But to hear that you were also.
01:18:21.872 - 01:18:24.190, Speaker A: I'm on their website, go through all the free resources.
01:18:24.770 - 01:18:45.954, Speaker B: So much time with those books. But to think that trading shitcoins and this stuff let you to educate yourself in financial stuff, that kind of helped change your life later on, I think that's really where the value comes because, yeah, most people will probably not make money from trying to trade NFTs, but you can have a very valuable experience by embracing everything else.
01:18:45.992 - 01:18:46.242, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:18:46.296 - 01:19:09.950, Speaker A: And you have to, I think, have an open mindset to it. If you're somebody who thinks that you got unlucky or you were wronged, if you paint yourself as a victim in your head, you're not going to get the same experience as if you look at it as a learning experience. You're like, hey, I have a little bit of money. I made a lot, but I lost it. Okay, well, I can't snap my fingers and go back in time and get the money back. I'm 25 at the time. I got a whole life ahead.
01:19:09.950 - 01:19:11.566, Speaker A: I mean, what can I do going forward?
01:19:11.668 - 01:19:43.394, Speaker D: And I think that's something that I have been turned off so much by in the last two or three years of paying attention to crypto. Twitter is. There's so much toxicity that is completely born from. I'm pissed off about the floor price. I'm pissed off about my personal choices and investments, whatever. And it's just like, this has nothing to do with why this is exciting, why people are making things. People are coming in just thinking about it as investments, and I think 100% biggest.
01:19:43.442 - 01:19:56.070, Speaker A: Yeah, we touched on it yesterday. I was like, I really want people to divorce the tech stack on the price of ETH because the tech is incredible. What we're building in the community, so much new stuff. The price of ETH is volatile. Sometimes price of looks incredible.
01:19:56.150 - 01:19:59.930, Speaker B: It's better today than it was when it was $4,000 for November of two years ago.
01:20:00.000 - 01:20:25.346, Speaker C: Well, that's why, by the way, building is always great during a bear market. And I agree with everything you're all saying. I remember 2016. I want to say, I got a call from somebody who is a friend of mine who's very wealthy and took him years to gain his wealth. And he said to me, called me up one night, he said, you should sell 75% of your crypto right now. It was like, on that rise up. I don't know if you remember in.
01:20:25.368 - 01:20:27.666, Speaker A: 2016, like, late 2016, it was already.
01:20:27.688 - 01:20:28.594, Speaker C: Starting to blow up.
01:20:28.632 - 01:20:28.834, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:20:28.872 - 01:20:31.618, Speaker A: Before the move, 2017, you were really.
01:20:31.704 - 01:20:47.030, Speaker C: 1727 when you went higher. But he was like, sell. Then he calls me again, 2017. He's like, okay, things are really moving. I'm telling you to sell. And I didn't understand it as much, even though I'd been in the space for a while already. And he said something to me that resonated with me that I've never forget.
01:20:47.030 - 01:21:26.086, Speaker C: He said, this is what he said. Sorry. He said, if your first million dollars that you make, if it's very easy to make, you're going to lose it, but the second million that you make will be harder and is always going to be better. And he drove that home to me, and he's like, you have to listen to me on this. He said, trust me. Basically, his thought process was like, it sounds great and it's really exciting, but it's not even what you think it is, right? Because you didn't work for it, you respect it. And I didn't understand, and I didn't respect it, and I didn't contemplate that.
01:21:26.086 - 01:21:55.358, Speaker C: And I was like, oh, no, because I'm going to make $20 million. I'm going to make $50 million, right? And it's so crazy. And he's like, no, you have to trust me. And I finally listened to him and whatever. I didn't sell all of it, but I sold a decent amount at that time. Until the last couple of years, I didn't realize the respect you have when you really actually push to work at it and understand what you're doing and put your effort into it. If things just come easy, it's like winning the lottery.
01:21:55.358 - 01:22:20.298, Speaker C: And statistically, people who win the lottery aren't happier and broke because it was just given to them as a gift, basically from the world. And it never works out because you're never respecting it enough. And I think that that's something really important. Again, I'm not saying, like, we don't all get lucky, obviously, and I'm still very lucky. But there is something to say about the effort and the growth that you put into it, for sure.
01:22:20.384 - 01:22:22.650, Speaker B: This is now a personal finance podcast.
01:22:25.630 - 01:22:27.290, Speaker A: There's a lot of artists in our community.
01:22:27.360 - 01:22:33.754, Speaker B: No, I think it's a very important part of the conversation because we're always talking about, listen, the money piece is a key pillar.
01:22:33.802 - 01:22:37.342, Speaker C: Wait, hold on. I have to get the door quickly. Just cut.
01:22:37.396 - 01:23:07.570, Speaker A: We do a little cut. All right, so we're back. We were talking briefly about how important personal finance is in the space. And I believe Sergito was mentioning, maybe I was mentioning it maybe you weren't mentioning it. I don't remember talking about. Know, the money part gets a lot of attention, but maybe from the wrong aspect of, um, people just see numbers, big flashy numbers, red, green. But I don't feel like they have a great relationship with money or they don't really fully.
01:23:07.570 - 01:23:17.338, Speaker A: Why do you want more money? What are you going to do with it? Like, thinking through more, like, why build wealth? Rather than like, oh, I just want to have wealth. So sorry for maybe.
01:23:17.424 - 01:23:48.098, Speaker B: No, I think that's a great summary. I mean, at the end of the day, it's an important element of the ecosystem. Right. Crypto is 24/7 it's a market. There's dollar value to everything, which can make a lot of fun, can change your life. But I think people should use the opportunity to educate themselves on why, how to keep it, how to make it, how to keep it, how to actually improve their quality of life. And I think a lot of the people in NFTs today went through this first cycle and are kind of understanding why it's important to think about the next 510 years.
01:23:48.184 - 01:24:03.702, Speaker C: Yeah, it's funny, I've said this to the deeds before. I have a conversation sometimes with other, bigger collectors, and I do believe that I'm a better trader. Now, I'm not going to lie because I have children. Right? This is not a plug.
01:24:03.766 - 01:24:04.694, Speaker A: Easier to take profit.
01:24:04.742 - 01:24:26.802, Speaker C: Right, exactly. It's not food, shelter, nannies, houses, trips like vacations. And it's not a plug to have children. Even though I think everybody here at this table would be amazing fathers. I've said that to each one of mean Joe's a little farther away from the two of you, but we'll get him there. But the two of you need to. What?
01:24:26.856 - 01:24:28.162, Speaker B: He's got his dog.
01:24:28.216 - 01:24:30.980, Speaker C: He does have his dog. He's in a relationship with his dog.
01:24:32.230 - 01:24:37.010, Speaker B: As a daughter. I meant as a daughter. We have sneakers and Nike, and they're like art.
01:24:37.080 - 01:24:38.358, Speaker C: They're like your children. Yeah.
01:24:38.444 - 01:24:39.830, Speaker B: And we've met Astrid.
01:24:40.970 - 01:24:49.562, Speaker C: It would be interesting to see what kind of children you would have with Astrid. But I also have a girlfriend. Yeah, you have a very lovely girlfriend. That's right.
01:24:49.616 - 01:24:51.210, Speaker B: Her name is also Astrid.
01:24:53.150 - 01:25:04.574, Speaker C: Astrid. And Astrid, call your girlfriend your dog. When you have children, one of the things you'll notice is that I have a dog and three children. I call my dog my children my.
01:25:04.612 - 01:25:06.394, Speaker A: Children, but my mom calls me my brother.
01:25:06.442 - 01:25:43.802, Speaker C: Yeah, 14 years old. Anyways, what I was saying is that it made me a better trader because I knew my responsibility that I had with the money that I was making, and I never even understood what real estate was right until I started investing in it. I was like, oh, wait a minute. This idea that you have to have your net worth in crypto is crazy. You need to diversify. And I think that's really important that people don't realize diversifying is okay. That's not a bad.
01:25:43.856 - 01:26:10.526, Speaker A: And diversifying within crypto really isn't real diversification. Like, if your idea of a portfolio that is diversified is 50% Eve 25% bitcoin and 25% NFTs, that's a very shitty diversified portfolio. Diversification, they're so fucking highly correlated that when one goes up or down, it's like diversification is like getting money outside of crypto, whether it's putting in index funds, real estate, private equity, whatever, getting it out of crypto.
01:26:10.558 - 01:26:11.026, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure.
01:26:11.048 - 01:26:12.926, Speaker B: Emergency funds, a few months of emergency.
01:26:12.958 - 01:26:15.598, Speaker A: Savings, cash, because I saving diversification meme.
01:26:15.614 - 01:26:35.002, Speaker C: That's why I like 30 shitcoin, by the way, I'm diversified. Correct. And for a bear market, which you always have to be prepared for, having that sort of like Runway for yourself and peace of mind, I promise you. It's really nice that if you sell some ether at a number and then you could buy it back, lower is the best feeling in the world.
01:26:35.056 - 01:26:44.558, Speaker B: The other thing is for people that want to actively trade, having kind of like an emergency fund allows you to take better risk decisions to buy near the bottom.
01:26:44.644 - 01:26:44.942, Speaker C: Yes.
01:26:44.996 - 01:26:47.194, Speaker B: Because you're not like shitting your pants.
01:26:47.242 - 01:26:47.854, Speaker C: Correct that.
01:26:47.892 - 01:26:53.230, Speaker B: Oh, my God, I can't pay rent. Exactly. You're like, oh, okay, things are down 85 and guess what?
01:26:53.300 - 01:27:26.010, Speaker C: And then you're going to sleep at night because I told this story before. I remember 2017 when everything was going up and then down. I had all these bells and whistles going off my phone. I was up like 03:00 in the morning just looking at stuff all day, and I could never sleep or even enjoy what I was doing. I want to move topics here because I think there's a very important topic before we end here that we have to get to. People love certain things in life, right? I love my children. I love my wife.
01:27:26.010 - 01:27:27.340, Speaker C: Right?
01:27:27.870 - 01:27:28.762, Speaker D: I love my dog.
01:27:28.816 - 01:27:35.342, Speaker C: You love your dog. You love digital screens. Deez loves nfts. He loves weed, right?
01:27:35.396 - 01:27:37.614, Speaker A: Yeah. Except for this week, we're on a seven, right?
01:27:37.732 - 01:28:03.398, Speaker C: You're on a break. Sergito loves, obviously his wife and his dogs, but probably something more that he loves more than anything in the world. I think that he can't survive without is me bits. What is this obsession that you have with me bits? Do you feel like you're a me bit in some way? Tell us what's going on here, because we need to understand this. You are the king of me bits. As Joe just said, g money gave.
01:28:03.404 - 01:28:24.602, Speaker B: Me that big name on the punks telegram. You'll be surprised to hear that when the mibits first came out, I fought at them because I thought that 2.5 ether was a mint cost. Punks got free one, so I got like four from my punks. And then I was like, 2.5 ether at the time was like close to ten K. It's a lot.
01:28:24.602 - 01:28:43.886, Speaker B: And we had just gone through the nifty gateway, kind of like high dollar mint bubble and burst. And I was like, okay, well, this is a lot of money. I don't know why they're doing this. And so I just grabbed mine and honestly, I sold them. And my niece was being born. So I actually love my nieces more than I love mibits. And so I gave the money to my sister.
01:28:43.886 - 01:29:00.646, Speaker B: I was like, hey, here, put it away for the girl. And I just kind of, like, looked away for a little bit. I was still hurting from the nifty gateway crash. And it wasn't until the mebiotes kind of died. A couple of months later, the hype went away. And there was a lot of hype around them. Pranks.
01:29:00.646 - 01:29:09.670, Speaker B: He minted a lot. Live on twitch. Beanie had bought pretty much every color of hoodie up Beanie.
01:29:09.750 - 01:29:14.170, Speaker A: He was sniping them from me. Thank you, Beanie, for buying the top, because I would have made some bad decisions.
01:29:14.750 - 01:29:16.818, Speaker C: And he bought, like, the pink.
01:29:16.854 - 01:29:28.238, Speaker A: He bought, like, a really nice three d one I really wanted at the time. I was really pissed off. And then he wouldn't even sell it to me at cost. He wanted to make like a ten e flip on me. And that's when I realized he was a piece of shit. But that's not your story.
01:29:28.324 - 01:29:55.514, Speaker B: Anyway, so, long story short, I kind of just looked away. And then the bear market hit. Remember that bear market in June of that of 2020 on? And I went back and I went back and looked at them because I thought, hey, wait a minute, this is actually a larva labs product. Yeah. And these guys got punks, right? They got glyphs, right? Punks, obviously pretty much everything PFP related is built on the idea of punks. Everything. Ten K trades and whatever.
01:29:55.514 - 01:30:14.014, Speaker B: Glyphs, generative art on chain, same thing. I'm like, this is metaverse. Ready? These are things that were built by these guys that are incredible and can see, like, four years in advance, and nobody's talking about them anymore. So I went back and looked. The discord channel was dead. It was me, von Meises, a couple.
01:30:14.052 - 01:30:17.406, Speaker A: Of, like, channel in the punks discord. Even its own discord.
01:30:17.438 - 01:30:19.938, Speaker C: It was a click away of the.
01:30:19.944 - 01:30:23.218, Speaker A: Punks discord that no one goes in because everyone's just in the main channel.
01:30:23.304 - 01:30:42.786, Speaker B: Correct. And the punks discord was popping, as it always is. I started to go through the traits and accientally did my own research wherever I was, like, oh, my God. So I started learning, for example, that they have tattoos. Some of them have tattoos. And the tattoo design was made with the same algorithm that they used to create the glyphs.
01:30:42.818 - 01:30:43.414, Speaker C: Oh, I didn't know.
01:30:43.452 - 01:30:44.822, Speaker B: So you have a little bit of the glyph.
01:30:44.886 - 01:30:45.830, Speaker C: Do you have tattoos?
01:30:45.910 - 01:30:47.926, Speaker B: I personally don't. On me. I'm going to get addicted.
01:30:47.958 - 01:30:50.010, Speaker C: Are we going to all after this get a tattoo?
01:30:50.750 - 01:30:52.086, Speaker A: I don't have any tattoos.
01:30:52.118 - 01:30:52.858, Speaker D: I have a couple.
01:30:52.944 - 01:30:53.450, Speaker C: You do?
01:30:53.520 - 01:30:54.202, Speaker D: I do.
01:30:54.336 - 01:30:55.338, Speaker B: Where are no glyphs.
01:30:55.354 - 01:30:56.154, Speaker D: Tattoos, no glyphs.
01:30:56.202 - 01:30:59.034, Speaker B: But if you get a Miv with a tattoo, you'll get a glyph tattoo.
01:30:59.082 - 01:31:00.186, Speaker A: And they also have a shirt.
01:31:00.298 - 01:31:09.090, Speaker D: Now I'm in the market. My only sale that I regret is selling my 3.23.2 ether floor.
01:31:09.910 - 01:31:34.282, Speaker B: But there's other stuff. There's other stuff within the collection people don't know. Right? So there's a blue camo and a regular green camo design. None of the mibits that have that on them, on their clothes have the same design, like repeat. It's also generative. So every single camel is different. They had a little kind of like Easter egg, where all the different pigs in their collection had different jersey numbers.
01:31:34.282 - 01:32:06.610, Speaker B: And if you arrange them a certain way, you could get the seed phrase for a wallet that was hiding, like, a really cool pig mibet, that somebody claimed literally last year. And if you remember, larva Labs did something similar with their proof grails drop, where if you crack the code on that piece, there was a wallet that was holding something else for you. And the seven of us in the Mibitz community today believe there's a few more wallets out there that are larva labs wallets that the seed phrase is somewhere hitting in the code. And people are trying.
01:32:06.760 - 01:32:13.270, Speaker A: Do you have the wallet addresses that you think are the lost larvae lab wallets, or is it just like you just.
01:32:13.420 - 01:32:19.798, Speaker B: We've identified a couple that looked Sus directly from the deployer into the wallet or moved. Right.
01:32:19.884 - 01:32:22.074, Speaker C: So you have to find the words essentially, yes.
01:32:22.112 - 01:32:52.674, Speaker B: And so if you look at the, like there's a lot of, again, the tattoos, the metadata have different characters that identify each tattoo. So there's a lot of stuff, you know, apes and doodles and everything else caught the attention of everybody. And mebits forgotten. Matt and John did not intend to develop them at all. Actually, at that squiggle event, we're talking about Venus over Manhattan, I caught up with John and he was telling me, we put them out with. They come with 3D models. Actually, we're using them.
01:32:52.674 - 01:33:11.446, Speaker B: Those 3d models for those Mibit cards that I launched, they're fully ready for you as a creator to take the 3d model and make anything you want out of it. And they like 20 models that are ready for it. No other collection really has that. Everybody's developing, but mibits came ready. They're like, we kind of created four people to take them and run with it.
01:33:11.548 - 01:33:17.414, Speaker C: I really feel like you need to write a book on the history of me bits because this is fascinating. I mean, it's still being written.
01:33:17.462 - 01:33:19.210, Speaker A: I've learned more about me bits in three minutes.
01:33:19.280 - 01:33:23.302, Speaker C: Just right now, I'm fomoing into buying more. I'm just like, wait, now I want a mebit.
01:33:23.446 - 01:33:43.394, Speaker D: That last part is really important. The fact that it's a skeleton ready model, that it's ready to be animated. And when you think about metaverse, I mean, I have my own feelings, reservations on metaverse in general, but there's no question that mebits was designed for that. No one's done anything was me bits sold also to.
01:33:43.512 - 01:33:59.318, Speaker B: Yes. So, by the way, to your point, even the metaverse doesn't happen to be like a video game. The fact that as a creator, you have a ton of assets that are high quality, made by larvae labs ready to deploy. Now that Hugo Labs bought the mibits and the punks IP and gave it to the asset, do you think we.
01:33:59.324 - 01:34:03.086, Speaker C: Might see some me bits with some apes on their metaverse?
01:34:03.218 - 01:34:20.720, Speaker B: No, they're definitely going to be on the other side. You already said that. But also as a creator, you can grab those assets, you own the IP and make a bunch of cool things with it and mint it, sell it, really create your own digital art with me bits on them, even if we never go ready player one in the future.
01:34:21.330 - 01:34:25.370, Speaker C: So that's what drew you to them, and then you decided to make the Mibits cards.
01:34:25.450 - 01:34:36.210, Speaker B: Right. So then fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. And again, I always make fun. There's only seven of us in the discord. It might actually be partly true, but it's a really cool, close community.
01:34:36.280 - 01:34:37.758, Speaker C: I'm joining it tonight. Eight.
01:34:37.864 - 01:35:01.878, Speaker B: Yeah. It reminds me of kind of like our metaverse, Dow, and even punks before they really started running in late February of that year. People are just still discovering things. We have bailita to shout out. This guy's like making really cool blender renders with this mebit every single day and putting them out kind of like every day. They're dope. There's Marcel, who's a photographer who's also making really cool pieces with his mibits.
01:35:01.878 - 01:35:18.610, Speaker B: And so we're like, all right, listen. Mibits deserve relevance, right? They're both bought by Yuga. So, you know, they're going to get developed the way that apes have been developed. They have a great team. They have like five or six people working just on me bits. So, like, Yuga employees focused 100% on me bits. So hello.
01:35:18.610 - 01:35:24.162, Speaker B: That just like, even from like a trading side, investment side, like, okay, there's something coming. It's a $4 billion company.
01:35:24.216 - 01:35:28.914, Speaker A: More than when John and Matt were running the ship way more significantly or.
01:35:28.952 - 01:35:42.778, Speaker B: Maybe even like more than the apes when Garga, emperor, ketchup and Gordon started. Right? Like, they have full team. They have a 16 C backing them. They have the experience of the apes and everything else. And so there's this thing that's there and they're going to run with it.
01:35:42.784 - 01:35:47.146, Speaker C: By the way, Matt Medved's buying one right now. You fomoed him into it. He's on his phone.
01:35:47.248 - 01:35:48.954, Speaker B: Love it, love it.
01:35:49.152 - 01:35:49.894, Speaker C: He just swept.
01:35:49.942 - 01:36:17.880, Speaker B: I'm like, let's take this meme card meta that is playing out right now and use the power of CCO and then throw mibits into the mix. I own the IP to all my. So, you know, luckily again, a lot of artists friends in the network, people are like, hey, that's pretty cool. I didn't know you could do that. So we have like a Hawaii themed piece that's going to be one of the cards that's going to come out. And they're putting the hawaiian mibits in the piece.
01:36:18.410 - 01:36:19.960, Speaker C: Is that your favorite one?
01:36:20.730 - 01:36:23.330, Speaker B: No, my favorite one is my fully suited elephant.
01:36:23.410 - 01:36:23.702, Speaker C: Okay.
01:36:23.756 - 01:36:48.974, Speaker B: There's only 500 fully suited mibits. They're rarer than picks, and I just love the way they look. They remind me of my Wall street suit and tie life, and they just look super sharp. So again, it's just trying to combine. Let's take CCO of the cards. Let's take the fact that people are really starting to appreciate, hey, you can have maybe like really high mint, low cost pieces to bring new people into the ecosystem. Teach them to collect, teach them about the art.
01:36:48.974 - 01:37:02.686, Speaker B: Really cool artists that are saying, hey, listen, that's not really affecting my supply because it's part of a bigger project at CCO, and I want to give people a chance to have fun with it. Combining them all together, and boom, we have seize the meeps.
01:37:02.718 - 01:37:05.214, Speaker C: Yeah. Sees the meme bits.
01:37:05.262 - 01:37:05.886, Speaker B: The meeps.
01:37:05.918 - 01:37:06.814, Speaker C: The meeps.
01:37:06.942 - 01:37:09.322, Speaker B: Seize the meeps. Yeah, it's kind of like a weird manifold.
01:37:09.406 - 01:37:11.734, Speaker C: I think about 500 people are like.
01:37:11.772 - 01:37:39.098, Speaker B: So we dropped Nakamito, which is kind of like the Genesis card. That'll always be the top card in our ecosystem. And then I wrote up the manifesto, which includes kind of like the four values of what we go secret in the manifesto. I don't know, providence, utility, mass appeal, and metaverse ability. So I think those are four pillars of the mebits and also four pillars of the web. Three, collecting community named your me bit your elephant. No, actually, Mrs.
01:37:39.098 - 01:37:41.086, Speaker B: Sergito, named. Wait, it's okay.
01:37:41.108 - 01:37:46.970, Speaker C: You don't have to tell us what you guys do privately. Sounds like you guys get a little funky with these me bits.
01:37:47.050 - 01:37:47.510, Speaker D: Whoa.
01:37:47.610 - 01:37:49.650, Speaker C: Anyways, well, they're fully rigged.
01:37:50.390 - 01:37:52.580, Speaker A: Have you seen common gang? But with.
01:37:55.270 - 01:38:08.342, Speaker B: No. So anyway, so that's kind of like what we're trying to do. I want to showcase that you have your IP for your NFts, and not just me. There's a lot of people that have their NFT IP, right? And they're trying to put it into, I don't know, like a soda ball or whatever.
01:38:08.396 - 01:38:09.606, Speaker C: And that works good. Try it.
01:38:09.628 - 01:38:21.206, Speaker B: But you can do nft native things with your nft IP and really start running that content creation flywheel. Take advantage of CCO. People are putting out really cool stuff. They're like, hey, run with it.
01:38:21.328 - 01:38:43.810, Speaker C: Yeah. So we sold everything, to be honest with you, all our apes. But we had kept one that will had from a long time ago. That's like his baby of the crown one. I don't know if you remember. Yeah, and I should have brought today. I'll send you guys, I don't know if he sent it to you, but we made a gummy brand CBD.
01:38:44.150 - 01:38:45.026, Speaker B: I've not seen that.
01:38:45.048 - 01:39:14.234, Speaker C: Yeah, and if you buy it, they're strong. And the first 5000 of people that buy it they're actually token gated and you're going to get an NFT drop and then it's going to be like a membership thing. But the same conversation we were having about it when somebody came to us from this company, all three of us are like, we're not going to do this unless it has some kind of benefit into the web3 NFT ecosystem. If it's just like, oh, I'm putting it on a bottle of wine, you sell the wine. What have we done differently?
01:39:14.282 - 01:39:39.090, Speaker B: Again, that's cool, but if you can. So for me, people are now like, oh, digital collectibles. Don't call them nfts, right? I'm sorry, but fuck that shit, right? Because digital collectibles just put NFTs into this unidimensional aspect where, oh, yeah, you can collect it digital, that's it, where NFTs are like supercharged tokens that you can use to deliver ideas, you can deliver real physical value.
01:39:39.160 - 01:39:42.934, Speaker C: So I think for the PFPs, I agree with you. This is a conversation how our road.
01:39:42.972 - 01:40:05.150, Speaker B: Is sort of splitting here. And I think for me, nfts broadly, right, just using that technology, being able to make money with it and just taking a step beyond. And so the meep cards will play with all of that. We're very working on a couple of things. We'll be able to redeem kind of like physical things, physical products from, that's alpha from other projects, another IP in the space.
01:40:05.300 - 01:40:10.414, Speaker C: I'm just saying there's a connection here we can make. I'm just throwing that out there.
01:40:10.612 - 01:40:33.078, Speaker B: Just throwing it out. I think, you know, at the end of the day, our goal is just to spread the message that, hey, yeah, you can come in and try to trade whatever Kobe called them, shitcoins with JPegs. Cool, do that. If you're good, you're going to make money. Why not? But you are almost at the big bang of this huge new universe where you can really do a bunch of other things. So start thinking about how to do.
01:40:33.164 - 01:41:10.818, Speaker C: I think you specifically have always felt that way about this community of really sending the message out. I know from madpups when you worked with Will and others, obviously, that we all friends with, that was your message from that group. It was like, okay, how do we bring more artists in? How do we get them to be involved here? I just think that message also very much what infinite objects is trying to do as well. I think that message of spreading the noise out, right, and getting more people involved is going to be the key for 2023, in my opinion. So I think what you're doing is great. I just have to get my meme bib card now.
01:41:10.984 - 01:41:14.242, Speaker A: Yeah. Susan, we are getting close.
01:41:14.296 - 01:41:14.514, Speaker C: Yes.
01:41:14.552 - 01:41:20.114, Speaker A: Top hour, too. We like to wrap things up. How do we want to wrap it up?
01:41:20.152 - 01:41:37.260, Speaker C: If you guys were in on a deserted island, okay. Which we kind of are. That's our whole thing, right? We're sort of shipwrecked together. If you could bring one album with you that you could listen to on replay, what would it be?
01:41:42.850 - 01:41:54.014, Speaker D: Recently I rediscovered two artists who. I was a music major in college. I was a music composition major in college, so music was my whole.
01:41:54.052 - 01:41:55.210, Speaker C: You played what instruments?
01:41:55.290 - 01:41:57.514, Speaker D: I played saxophone starting in third grade.
01:41:57.562 - 01:41:57.870, Speaker C: Wow.
01:41:57.940 - 01:42:04.670, Speaker D: Through undergrad. And then I played guitar starting in middle school. And I lived with my band.
01:42:04.750 - 01:42:07.954, Speaker C: If I knew that, I wish I would have told you. Bring a guitar today. Next time, we're going to have you on.
01:42:07.992 - 01:42:09.374, Speaker A: You still play, you still dabble.
01:42:09.502 - 01:42:38.810, Speaker D: I have a guitar, a couple of guitars in my apartment, but I don't pick them up enough. So music used to be my music, was, like, going to be my life, until I realized I was never going to be in that top. And I was like, well, where is really the future here? And also, studying music kind of ruined music for me. Anyway, the two artists I recently rediscovered, one of them is called Gigi Allen. Are you guys familiar with Gigi Allen?
01:42:38.890 - 01:42:39.086, Speaker C: No.
01:42:39.108 - 01:42:39.760, Speaker A: I think.
01:42:40.290 - 01:42:56.562, Speaker D: No. No. He was a punk rocker. He kind of redefined what he believed rock and roll was, which was very antagonistic. He was like, rock and roll represents everything that is wrong with the world. I love it.
01:42:56.696 - 01:42:57.918, Speaker C: So he was a djen?
01:42:58.014 - 01:43:07.794, Speaker D: He was way worse than a djen. Do you know Gigi Allen? There you go. Yeah. Gigi Allen shows on Spotify.
01:43:07.842 - 01:43:09.414, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Yes. Love it.
01:43:09.532 - 01:43:16.662, Speaker D: He would degenerate. He would get completely naked on stage. Shit himself, cut himself.
01:43:16.806 - 01:43:17.210, Speaker A: Wow.
01:43:17.280 - 01:43:32.122, Speaker D: Throw his feces into the crowd, assault audience members. Usually he would start the show with, like, a packed house, especially at the height of his fame. And then by the end, there would be two people left in the crowd.
01:43:32.186 - 01:43:33.546, Speaker C: And this is your hero?
01:43:33.658 - 01:43:36.206, Speaker D: No, he's not my hero. No, but he is really?
01:43:36.308 - 01:43:37.230, Speaker C: You love his music.
01:43:37.300 - 01:43:38.654, Speaker B: Okay, I don't even think his music.
01:43:38.692 - 01:43:41.086, Speaker D: Is that great to be. At first, it was kind of decent.
01:43:41.118 - 01:43:42.622, Speaker C: So why would you pick his album?
01:43:42.686 - 01:43:45.838, Speaker D: Because he was a maverick.
01:43:45.934 - 01:43:47.506, Speaker C: Okay. He's a maverick, which.
01:43:47.528 - 01:43:48.820, Speaker D: I would never use that word.
01:43:50.550 - 01:43:52.318, Speaker A: His most popular song.
01:43:52.414 - 01:43:52.962, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:43:53.096 - 01:43:55.810, Speaker A: It's called abuse myself, I want to die.
01:43:55.890 - 01:43:56.520, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:43:57.370 - 01:43:58.562, Speaker D: Not a great musician.
01:43:58.626 - 01:44:01.058, Speaker A: Not a great musician. Bite it, you scum.
01:44:01.154 - 01:44:03.260, Speaker C: We're really learning a lot about Joe today.
01:44:04.030 - 01:44:10.598, Speaker D: He's a significant. I think there's something significant. The other one is the Shags. Do you guys know the Shags?
01:44:10.614 - 01:44:11.878, Speaker A: That sounds way more familiar.
01:44:11.974 - 01:44:19.274, Speaker D: Yeah. Shags from 1965 is four sisters. Their dad just bought them instruments and then recorded an album.
01:44:19.402 - 01:44:22.990, Speaker C: I'll tell you, Joe gave us the most outlandish answers, and I love it.
01:44:23.140 - 01:44:28.594, Speaker D: Those are the two things. This is just, like, literally, okay, no, go with the last few days, then.
01:44:28.632 - 01:44:29.522, Speaker C: Just go with it.
01:44:29.576 - 01:44:30.446, Speaker D: I rediscovered.
01:44:30.478 - 01:44:32.210, Speaker C: Yeah, sergito.
01:44:32.630 - 01:44:35.630, Speaker B: Well, I might disappoint you guys because my album's in Spanish.
01:44:35.710 - 01:44:36.482, Speaker C: That's fine.
01:44:36.616 - 01:44:38.718, Speaker B: There's mexican band called Panda.
01:44:38.814 - 01:44:39.266, Speaker C: Okay.
01:44:39.368 - 01:45:05.446, Speaker B: And the album's called amant sumt amantes, which is really not spanish. Well, the last word is this is a alternative rock band that formed in Mexico when I was in high school. And when I went to college, I went to college in this town called Monterey. And very different. I learned English in high school. Didn't know anything about us culture or anything like that. And blink 182 came into the give a concert.
01:45:05.446 - 01:45:30.440, Speaker B: And obviously, you know Blink 182. Blink 182. Never 2003, right. I'm saying back then, being in Mexico and Panda opened for them, we boot them the whole way. We're like, I had never listened to them before, but then I felt bad, actually. So I went back and I looked them up and I listened to their music. And it was during those two years where I decided, like, I'm going to make something out of myself.
01:45:30.440 - 01:46:12.050, Speaker B: Geography is destiny. Having been born mexican side of the border completely gives you a disadvantage versus people who were born on the US side. And I was like, fuck that. I know English now I'm going to make something out of myself. I'm going to go to Wall street and I will play that album over and over in my car as I was driving to school or back to where I was living. And it just really brings me back to those moments where I'm like, all right, listen, I was born like this, but I am going to just fucking go and do what I want to do and achieve my dreams. And so if we were in an island, stuck, where we're like, we might die, but we got to survive and we got to get the fuck out of this.
01:46:12.050 - 01:46:13.618, Speaker B: I would do that.
01:46:13.704 - 01:46:38.762, Speaker C: You're giving me a great idea for another question. Before we get to 2023, I have to ask it. I feel like this is a great. By the way, we could use a sponsor now. By the way, I'm just throwing it out there. Ready? You're going to like this one. If you had to pick a moment in time that you could put on your infinite objects while you were on the deserted island, what would that moment be? Wait.
01:46:38.816 - 01:46:40.038, Speaker A: On the deserted island?
01:46:40.134 - 01:46:43.354, Speaker C: Yeah. You're on the deserted island because you have to have something with you.
01:46:43.392 - 01:46:43.690, Speaker B: Right.
01:46:43.760 - 01:46:44.700, Speaker A: Infinite object.
01:46:45.630 - 01:46:47.898, Speaker B: It's pretty much asking, like, what's the last thing you want to see before you?
01:46:47.904 - 01:46:48.742, Speaker A: What's the last memory?
01:46:48.806 - 01:46:51.834, Speaker C: Yeah. Or you're sitting there. You have to remember something to keep you sane.
01:46:51.882 - 01:46:52.286, Speaker B: Right.
01:46:52.388 - 01:46:57.310, Speaker C: What would that memory be on your infinite objects, which you can't do?
01:46:57.460 - 01:47:11.430, Speaker B: I have one, and that's because I've been thinking a lot about trading cards lately. Because of the MiBU cards, I played in the regional championship in Texas to qualify for the Pokemon trading card game. Oh, my God. Super trainer showdown. Good.
01:47:11.580 - 01:47:12.486, Speaker C: Wow. Really?
01:47:12.588 - 01:47:41.294, Speaker B: Yes. And I was in the final. It was this mall in Texas, in the Woodlands, and it's me against this kid. Pretty much came down to the tiebreaker, and we're, like, in the middle of a foot court that was set up as, like, a little Pokemon stadium. And all these people are watching, right? All the players that already got knocked down. I'm in the final of my age group, and my dad is, like, standing right outside the little. We were playing with the table, and the tiebreaker came down to how many cards were left on your deck, and whoever had the most cards won.
01:47:41.294 - 01:48:02.198, Speaker B: And I remember the judge counted six cards on the other kid's deck, and I don't know how many cards. I couldn't even grab my cards anymore because my hands were so sweaty. And you use plastic sleeves to cover them that they were falling. So I was, like, playing like this. I was so nervous. And the judge picks them up and counts 123456 and has one left and lifts it up. It's like, seven.
01:48:02.198 - 01:48:18.186, Speaker B: Winner. I don't know how I teleported from the chair to my dad's arms to give him a hug. And that hug is just like that feeling. Best hug ever. And I love my mom, I love my sister, love my wife, and everything since. But that hug was just something that. Yeah, we'll love to see that.
01:48:18.208 - 01:48:23.630, Speaker C: You need a partnership with Elon Musk so he could put the. What's it called? And you could download those memories.
01:48:29.090 - 01:48:29.918, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
01:48:30.004 - 01:48:32.990, Speaker C: So now that we know that you're a Pokemon trainer. That's crazy.
01:48:33.140 - 01:48:35.050, Speaker D: That's amazing. No, a champion.
01:48:35.130 - 01:48:40.690, Speaker C: Champion. We're with royalty here. Joe, what would your memory.
01:48:42.870 - 01:48:48.630, Speaker D: Was while you were talking? I was just trying to think of a great one. And there's a lot of personal moments.
01:48:50.330 - 01:48:51.238, Speaker B: Safe for work.
01:48:51.324 - 01:49:14.570, Speaker D: That are safe for work. Yeah, exactly. So I think that. So my dog is really important to me. I think I adopted about four years ago. She was a rescue from Kentucky, and I took it very seriously. I had just raised my first money for the company.
01:49:14.570 - 01:49:36.322, Speaker D: And so that moment in my life was. The person was like, okay, I have a job. I had never had a real job. I was an assistant professor. So I was teaching at the university, but outside of that, and I only did that for three or four years, ten years before that. And anyway, I had always wanted a dog my whole life, so much. My parents never let me get a dog.
01:49:36.322 - 01:50:11.566, Speaker D: They were like, my mom pretended she was allergic. Now my mom is obsessed with my dog and to the point where she calls my dog my sister, my human sister's name by accident because she believes my dog is a human. Anyway, to the point where I actually started walking dogs. My first business venture was I was in middle school, and I wanted a dog so bad, I just started walking my neighbor's dogs. And then I all of a sudden had a book of 40 different neighbors and had all these house keys. And I started hiring my friends to walk the dogs separately. Anyway, this is like a 7th grade story.
01:50:11.566 - 01:50:36.470, Speaker D: Fast forward 20 years. And I had applied to five different. You have to apply to get a dog now, even a rescue dog. And this is, well, pre pandemic. Anyway, she was the first dog that I made an appointment to meet. And the way it worked was you showed up, you gave them a driver's license, and they give you the dog, and they say you have a 30 minutes test drive. Like, go walk your dog around the block.
01:50:36.470 - 01:51:04.206, Speaker D: And it was insane. She was destroyed. She was so traumatized by whatever had happened in her first eight months of life that she could not walk. She would just shake. It took us 1 hour to walk one square block in the east village. They just parked a van in the east, like a truck in the east village. And they called me and like, where's our dog? Steal our fucking dog.
01:51:04.206 - 01:51:32.342, Speaker D: But I sat with her on every stoop for, like, ten minutes, five minutes, every stoop. And she's now just like, you've met her. She's like, totally great. I can take her anywhere. I was going to bring her here, but I know that we sat on so many stoops and people would come up and be like, oh, my God. And I would be like, I don't know this dog. And I feel like having that.
01:51:32.396 - 01:51:33.346, Speaker A: Test driving her.
01:51:33.468 - 01:52:03.138, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm test driving having that. I don't know. There's something about strength. There's something about growth. There's something about compassion and love. And I think those are the things that we all need more of in general and in terms of my life and the way that we're a small company, we're 25 people, but that's certainly something that is really important to kind of our spirit and just who we are. I think that summarizes a lot of it.
01:52:03.304 - 01:52:06.066, Speaker C: That was powerful. We probably should end it.
01:52:06.088 - 01:52:07.380, Speaker A: That's how we end it. Yeah.
01:52:07.910 - 01:52:14.630, Speaker C: That, I think, is so much of the message that we try to get across here. Listen, thank you guys both for coming.
01:52:14.700 - 01:52:15.474, Speaker B: Thanks for the invite.
01:52:15.522 - 01:52:28.262, Speaker C: Thank you. Hope we could do this again. These infinite objects were amazing, and we're looking forward to 2023 and what you guys are going to bring and keep building. Keep building. Yeah.
01:52:28.316 - 01:52:31.462, Speaker B: And with that, I'm following your lead.
01:52:31.516 - 01:52:33.326, Speaker C: No, not my lead.
01:52:33.348 - 01:52:34.846, Speaker B: Deez's lead and your lead, too.
01:52:34.868 - 01:52:35.406, Speaker C: And Joe's lead.
01:52:35.428 - 01:52:36.714, Speaker A: We're just the blindly in the blind.
01:52:36.762 - 01:52:41.006, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. With that, Deez, anything else?
01:52:41.108 - 01:52:44.174, Speaker A: No. I mean, thanks just for coming vibing with us. This is great.
01:52:44.292 - 01:52:45.758, Speaker D: Yeah. Thanks, guys.
01:52:45.844 - 01:52:46.220, Speaker C: Thank you.
