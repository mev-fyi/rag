00:00:16.890 - 00:00:19.278, Speaker A: Everyone's comfortable. Can we go?
00:00:19.444 - 00:00:20.640, Speaker B: Pretty good? All right.
00:00:21.570 - 00:00:45.820, Speaker A: Yeah. After all the spicy takes of John, I don't really know how to follow up with something even more spicy. My name is Togrel. We have Guillermo. Alex and Guillermo's alt here. Or as people call him sometimes, Tarun. Guys, can you introduce yourself, please?
00:00:46.430 - 00:00:55.950, Speaker C: Sure. I'm Jannik. I work on Shutter network, which is a front running protection Mev minimization system that we hope to integrate into rollups.
00:00:56.930 - 00:00:58.282, Speaker D: Hi, I'm Guillermo.
00:00:58.346 - 00:01:05.700, Speaker E: I am a glorified paper editor at Bain Capital Crypto. I guess that usually translates ahead of research, but I don't know what that means.
00:01:07.110 - 00:01:14.340, Speaker F: Hi, I'm Alex. I'm part of flashbots. I'm a researcher steward, working on all kind of Mev related things there.
00:01:15.530 - 00:01:26.806, Speaker D: I'm Tarun. I found a company called Gauntlet, but I also have written a bunch of papers trying to make sure that people realize Mev isn't always good.
00:01:26.828 - 00:01:49.402, Speaker A: Good. All right, first question. Mev has become an established phenomenon amongst the went. Four years ago, it was just one paper, which like ten people in the world knew about. And now it's like protocols are being built around it. So with l two s coming to the scene, what do you see? The future of Mev.
00:01:49.466 - 00:01:50.080, Speaker G: Like.
00:01:52.450 - 00:01:53.920, Speaker A: Who wants to go first?
00:01:54.930 - 00:01:58.242, Speaker F: I'm happy to go, but, Yannick, you also work on l two s. If you want to start.
00:01:58.376 - 00:02:17.590, Speaker C: I can start maybe with very short answer. I think it won't go away. We'll stay there. But it will probably different because there's an l two s. They were very different from produce blocks in different ways. So I see different new phenomena.
00:02:19.070 - 00:02:20.490, Speaker F: I actually disagree.
00:02:21.790 - 00:02:22.582, Speaker A: Shock?
00:02:22.726 - 00:02:24.970, Speaker F: Well, no, I mean, what do you mean looking different?
00:02:25.120 - 00:02:27.580, Speaker G: Because, for example.
00:02:29.310 - 00:02:44.594, Speaker C: Sequencers centralized, and that works very differently. I also think there's space for experimentation. L1s have to be very conservative in how they design their protocol because.
00:02:44.712 - 00:02:48.334, Speaker B: There'S lots of value, or at least on Ethereum.
00:02:48.462 - 00:03:11.338, Speaker C: And roller does not have that problem, so they can just try out lots of different things. For example, different types of mempools, encrypted mempools, public Mempools, maybe. I think you proposed this escalating fear, something like that could be implementing a roll up, like all this kind of stuff. Wait, sorry.
00:03:11.424 - 00:03:14.694, Speaker G: Could you have not heard of this particular proposal?
00:03:14.742 - 00:03:17.786, Speaker B: And maybe Fleshworth's better proposed it ourselves. Right?
00:03:17.808 - 00:03:19.194, Speaker F: Like, the escalator is a concept as.
00:03:19.232 - 00:03:21.946, Speaker B: Old as maybe p 15591 of the.
00:03:21.968 - 00:03:26.974, Speaker F: Design was like an escalator fee concept. Dan Finley from Metamask is like one person that brought this up.
00:03:27.012 - 00:03:28.174, Speaker G: Here's an even number question.
00:03:28.292 - 00:03:29.550, Speaker D: Escalator fee.
00:03:30.530 - 00:03:39.794, Speaker F: You submit a transaction with a negative fee, say, and settle that transaction for you. And if no one settles it under.
00:03:39.832 - 00:03:44.978, Speaker B: A period, the transaction fee escalates to a higher level.
00:03:45.064 - 00:03:52.354, Speaker F: There's also any sender from Patrick who's right here that did something similar, but that was more for resubmitting their transaction to the mempool.
00:03:52.482 - 00:03:54.534, Speaker B: There's a lot of these concepts, none of this is new.
00:03:54.572 - 00:04:00.122, Speaker F: And it's about better ux for users. In that case of what was proposed, and it's not something that we're building.
00:04:00.176 - 00:04:05.610, Speaker B: Actively, was to having some type of order flow auction.
00:04:09.310 - 00:04:11.498, Speaker G: And how auction on.
00:04:11.504 - 00:04:12.970, Speaker E: Chain, it does not suck.
00:04:13.470 - 00:04:15.046, Speaker F: Yeah, well that's the problem with escalator.
00:04:15.078 - 00:04:16.410, Speaker B: Fee, it's extremely central.
00:04:17.150 - 00:04:18.926, Speaker F: The decentralized timestamp that you have is.
00:04:18.948 - 00:04:20.222, Speaker B: Like if you're in block time, which.
00:04:20.276 - 00:04:22.814, Speaker F: We'Re slow, and usually you want this.
00:04:22.852 - 00:04:24.846, Speaker B: Auction to go quite fast because you.
00:04:24.868 - 00:04:26.018, Speaker F: Want to be able to update the.
00:04:26.024 - 00:04:29.346, Speaker B: Escalator quite quickly, but more interesting because.
00:04:29.368 - 00:04:33.298, Speaker F: They have shorter block times and so you're able to have more fun there.
00:04:33.384 - 00:04:35.566, Speaker B: You can also just do more centralized.
00:04:35.598 - 00:04:39.560, Speaker F: Infra and then see what happens. Again, I don't think it's a design we're going to build.
00:04:40.170 - 00:04:46.006, Speaker B: There are reasons why it's not as interesting to us related to leakage of.
00:04:46.188 - 00:04:50.986, Speaker F: Information that auction, and other things related to this.
00:04:51.008 - 00:04:53.450, Speaker B: And I'm sure you guys worked on.
00:04:53.600 - 00:04:56.698, Speaker F: Defi and privacy in the context of amms in particular.
00:04:56.784 - 00:04:58.490, Speaker B: So you're familiar.
00:04:58.830 - 00:05:00.380, Speaker E: I have no idea what you're talking about.
00:05:03.950 - 00:05:11.198, Speaker D: So I think the one thing to remember, and maybe this is just a sign being a boomer, is that if.
00:05:11.204 - 00:05:13.906, Speaker H: I look at the Linux, Linux 2.4.
00:05:13.928 - 00:05:30.646, Speaker D: To 2.6, that was like one of the biggest sort of open source software upgrades in history. Anything in crypto is one 1,000,000th at best of like how big of an upgrade that was. Because every data center in the world to upgrade to this, because a, if.
00:05:30.668 - 00:05:32.758, Speaker H: You wanted to support multicore or you.
00:05:32.764 - 00:05:34.534, Speaker D: Want to support many different processors, different.
00:05:34.572 - 00:05:40.620, Speaker H: Types of heterogeneity in your current, all of this shit, you couldn't do it unless you.
00:05:41.630 - 00:05:45.018, Speaker D: And it was an upgrade that took like ten years.
00:05:45.184 - 00:05:47.114, Speaker H: And most of the was, it was.
00:05:47.152 - 00:05:52.446, Speaker D: Really fucking hard to schedule processes on multiple cores. And to get that right, and to.
00:05:52.468 - 00:05:54.986, Speaker H: Scheduling all the cache misses, to scheduling.
00:05:55.018 - 00:05:57.242, Speaker D: All the cache coherency protocols.
00:05:57.306 - 00:05:59.454, Speaker H: There was a lot of went into.
00:05:59.492 - 00:06:02.910, Speaker D: That from probably hundreds of thousands of engineers.
00:06:03.250 - 00:06:05.826, Speaker H: So Lupzer have the same problem.
00:06:05.928 - 00:06:07.394, Speaker D: The difference is that instead of having.
00:06:07.432 - 00:06:10.594, Speaker H: A scheduler you have this set of.
00:06:10.632 - 00:06:14.802, Speaker D: Many auctions that are interacting with each other that act as a scheduler and.
00:06:14.856 - 00:06:16.386, Speaker H: That'S an even harder problem.
00:06:16.488 - 00:06:18.462, Speaker D: So I think we should at least.
00:06:18.536 - 00:06:20.310, Speaker H: Give some credence to the fact that.
00:06:20.460 - 00:06:37.786, Speaker D: Linux took so long to solve a much easier problem that had to be deployed to 99% of computers. And so I think in general all of the people complain about information leakage. Seen the same thing before where when we moved to the first version of.
00:06:37.808 - 00:06:47.390, Speaker H: Linux I think the efficiency ratio was like 10%, which was horrible. 90% of cores were sitting there spinning doing inspining.
00:06:47.890 - 00:06:50.590, Speaker A: Thanks for the Linux history lesson.
00:06:52.210 - 00:06:53.678, Speaker F: I have an answer to your question though.
00:06:53.764 - 00:06:55.518, Speaker B: Sorry, well, I was just going to.
00:06:55.524 - 00:06:58.386, Speaker G: Say in general, right, centralized is very.
00:06:58.488 - 00:06:59.726, Speaker E: You can have all these nice economic.
00:06:59.758 - 00:07:03.346, Speaker G: Efficiency problems and in particular nice thing.
00:07:03.368 - 00:07:07.810, Speaker E: Where you have or don't have this nice thing where you have a bunch of interacting auctions and congratulations.
00:07:07.890 - 00:07:10.854, Speaker G: The problem with interacting auctions, as if.
00:07:10.892 - 00:07:13.606, Speaker E: You remember Milgram from whatever the 90s.
00:07:13.708 - 00:07:17.846, Speaker G: Auction spectra was meant to solve this.
00:07:17.868 - 00:07:18.838, Speaker E: Thing of like you have a bunch.
00:07:18.844 - 00:07:22.326, Speaker G: Of interacting auctions and want to succeed.
00:07:22.358 - 00:07:28.918, Speaker E: At one and then fail at the other. But you can't guarantee that unless you somehow have additional higher level interaction.
00:07:28.934 - 00:07:30.322, Speaker G: This is like kind of repeating tarune.
00:07:30.406 - 00:07:34.880, Speaker E: Just more generally with auctions. So this is why I had a question.
00:07:35.410 - 00:07:39.774, Speaker G: Even mechanically auctions suck, right?
00:07:39.812 - 00:07:41.486, Speaker E: And they'll suck even more because now.
00:07:41.508 - 00:07:43.646, Speaker G: You have all of themselves don't come.
00:07:43.668 - 00:07:47.342, Speaker E: Into consensus like trying to interact in weird ways.
00:07:47.476 - 00:07:49.906, Speaker G: So do you have auction and how.
00:07:49.928 - 00:07:52.930, Speaker E: Do you do that? But then you have auctions and auctions.
00:07:53.430 - 00:07:56.534, Speaker G: You can get really with it, right?
00:07:56.572 - 00:08:00.418, Speaker E: And be like oh, we continue to deal with meta, meta, meta.
00:08:00.514 - 00:08:02.290, Speaker H: Was that DMT or weed?
00:08:02.450 - 00:08:03.906, Speaker D: What was the implied smoke?
00:08:03.938 - 00:08:04.374, Speaker B: Both.
00:08:04.492 - 00:08:05.382, Speaker E: Yeah, exactly.
00:08:05.436 - 00:08:06.360, Speaker G: Take your pick.
00:08:07.210 - 00:08:12.682, Speaker F: Sorry Alex, I have an answer as well. I think both of you are talking about cross roll up stuff happening, right?
00:08:12.736 - 00:08:13.162, Speaker E: That's right.
00:08:13.216 - 00:08:16.780, Speaker F: Whereas if I'm pronouncing your name right.
00:08:17.550 - 00:08:20.714, Speaker B: Yannick talking about intro roll up, what happens?
00:08:20.752 - 00:08:24.960, Speaker F: And actually I take back what I said before about disagreeing with you.
00:08:25.410 - 00:08:28.046, Speaker B: I agree with, depending on the design.
00:08:28.148 - 00:08:35.234, Speaker F: That people go with for their ordering policy that's going to have, we're going to see different behaviors from people going.
00:08:35.272 - 00:08:38.078, Speaker B: After opportunities in these places.
00:08:38.174 - 00:08:44.018, Speaker F: I don't think these behaviors are going to be novel. There are other chains outside of the.
00:08:44.024 - 00:08:46.470, Speaker B: Ethereum ecosystem that already have different ordering.
00:08:47.130 - 00:09:00.746, Speaker F: Or that don't have a fee market. And we see what happens, right. Solana getting spammed. Polygon getting spammed for different reasons. Co locating with avalanche foundation validators in.
00:09:00.768 - 00:09:05.146, Speaker B: Order to be faster. And you see very similar behaviors today.
00:09:05.248 - 00:09:09.766, Speaker F: With their centralized sequencers. So I think depending on the architectural.
00:09:09.798 - 00:09:11.594, Speaker B: Choice there, you're going to see different.
00:09:11.632 - 00:09:28.446, Speaker F: Behaviors related to MeV. The second thing I will say related to MeV is I think roll ups are going to be much more active with how they decide to harness that value. If you take optimism, for example, I think they're taking a pretty open and public position about like oh, let's redirect.
00:09:28.638 - 00:09:33.726, Speaker B: Public goods funding, right. Other projects, I want to do it differently.
00:09:33.838 - 00:09:39.650, Speaker F: If you look at Cosmos, for example, accrue value to the atom token using.
00:09:39.720 - 00:09:43.720, Speaker B: An interchange scheduler, this is kind of like referring to.
00:09:44.250 - 00:09:49.450, Speaker F: So I think there's like a big design space there, and not only for redistribution, but also for the ordering policy.
00:09:49.520 - 00:09:51.222, Speaker B: That you choose and how that affects.
00:09:51.366 - 00:10:00.566, Speaker F: The activity that the searchers have. However, I don't think there's going to be fundamentals. I'm trying to think is there mev.
00:10:00.598 - 00:10:02.734, Speaker B: That specific to l two s comes.
00:10:02.772 - 00:10:13.294, Speaker F: To mind is like stuff related to exiting the l two or like censoring a commitment. Stuff related to escape hatches or stuff.
00:10:13.332 - 00:10:16.386, Speaker B: Related to the l one path that.
00:10:16.408 - 00:10:19.698, Speaker F: You can take to submit your transaction to an l two, these things are.
00:10:19.864 - 00:10:22.382, Speaker B: Quite specific to layer.
00:10:22.526 - 00:10:25.938, Speaker F: And so maybe there's like new stuff there that we haven't seen before.
00:10:26.024 - 00:10:27.414, Speaker D: There's one thing I think that has.
00:10:27.452 - 00:10:30.934, Speaker H: Not been analyzed, which is thing that.
00:10:30.972 - 00:10:32.866, Speaker D: Everyone who is running a centralized sequencer.
00:10:32.898 - 00:10:34.440, Speaker H: Is trying to avoid, even though.
00:10:35.450 - 00:10:38.646, Speaker D: Which is that if I have two.
00:10:38.748 - 00:10:41.098, Speaker H: Systems which are supposed to synchronize but.
00:10:41.104 - 00:10:47.702, Speaker D: They have two different fork choice rules, and I can't guarantee some bounded latency difference between the two fork choice rules.
00:10:47.766 - 00:10:52.362, Speaker H: What'S the probability that they can reconcile under some fixed number of blocks?
00:10:52.506 - 00:11:00.794, Speaker D: And the multiple fork choice rule reconciliation actually will probably create a huge amount of mev. When you go to decentralized sequencers versus.
00:11:00.842 - 00:11:04.426, Speaker B: Single sequencer by multiple fork choice rules.
00:11:04.458 - 00:11:05.806, Speaker F: You mean like two l two s.
00:11:05.828 - 00:11:10.786, Speaker H: Again, one forks and the l two forks and the l two forks a.
00:11:10.808 - 00:11:13.150, Speaker D: Certain time length and the l one forks for a different time length.
00:11:13.230 - 00:11:15.214, Speaker H: All of the exist guarantees that exist.
00:11:15.262 - 00:11:20.662, Speaker D: Both formally and numerically. Fork choice behavior like ghost or anything.
00:11:20.716 - 00:11:22.518, Speaker H: Like that just go out the.
00:11:22.684 - 00:11:36.140, Speaker D: So this idea of interacting fork choice was basically making mev more almost like giving some leverage to mev between two chains is one of the things I'd be most scared about with a decentralized sequencer and l two.
00:11:37.630 - 00:11:38.380, Speaker B: Next.
00:11:40.690 - 00:11:43.600, Speaker H: Hey, you asked for different than.
00:11:44.210 - 00:12:01.540, Speaker A: I'm not complaining. Since roll ups allow you to design the protocol from the clean. Should we build the protocol from the ground up to mitigate Mav, incorporate it into the incentives of the protocol and embrace it?
00:12:02.310 - 00:12:03.410, Speaker H: The latter.
00:12:04.230 - 00:12:14.066, Speaker D: There's this epistemic fallacy amongst certain people that you actually can come up to consistent ordering across many people with differing.
00:12:14.098 - 00:12:20.438, Speaker H: Utility functions and non trivial differences. That's sort of a pie in the sky.
00:12:20.534 - 00:12:22.918, Speaker D: I don't understand that information theory exists.
00:12:23.014 - 00:12:28.826, Speaker G: Type of team, which is if you build a dex combined with l one.
00:12:28.848 - 00:12:31.102, Speaker E: Or l two, you can do things.
00:12:31.156 - 00:12:33.882, Speaker G: Like market after every transaction.
00:12:33.946 - 00:12:39.546, Speaker E: So there cannot be any back running, right. Because by definition there exists no arbitrage.
00:12:39.578 - 00:12:41.258, Speaker G: If you've already routed.
00:12:41.354 - 00:12:43.918, Speaker E: Right. So like penumbra is one such case.
00:12:44.084 - 00:12:48.370, Speaker G: We have a number of other such projects. I think some of them are sitting somewhere around here.
00:12:48.520 - 00:12:51.746, Speaker E: But the point is there's a whole.
00:12:51.768 - 00:12:54.626, Speaker G: Question of mitigate MeV or something, which.
00:12:54.648 - 00:12:56.066, Speaker E: Is a whole weird other topic that.
00:12:56.088 - 00:13:01.394, Speaker G: I touch but vaguely looking at the outline of things sound like MeV.
00:13:01.442 - 00:13:03.766, Speaker E: You can kind of, there's a lot.
00:13:03.788 - 00:13:06.214, Speaker G: You can because of the knowledge that.
00:13:06.332 - 00:13:08.902, Speaker E: MeV that happens on automated market makers.
00:13:08.966 - 00:13:11.866, Speaker G: Has like this very specific. Right.
00:13:12.048 - 00:13:18.346, Speaker E: And you can exploit that pretty carefully to construct things like mitigate MeV in.
00:13:18.368 - 00:13:20.906, Speaker G: The sense of you have prices for.
00:13:20.928 - 00:13:22.318, Speaker E: All of your automated market makers at.
00:13:22.324 - 00:13:24.480, Speaker G: Every point in time because you correctly route every.
00:13:24.850 - 00:13:27.966, Speaker E: And you do not accept orders that.
00:13:27.988 - 00:13:30.602, Speaker G: Only touch like a specific CFM.
00:13:30.666 - 00:13:32.494, Speaker H: Again, but you are making.
00:13:32.692 - 00:13:34.142, Speaker D: It's application specific.
00:13:34.276 - 00:13:35.314, Speaker E: Of course it's application specific.
00:13:35.352 - 00:13:35.698, Speaker D: Right.
00:13:35.784 - 00:13:38.258, Speaker H: That possibility thing like, oh, I'm going.
00:13:38.264 - 00:13:45.346, Speaker D: To do FIFo ordering for every fucking roll up. Oh no, that's just like ignoring like 50 years of, no, I'm not even.
00:13:45.368 - 00:13:46.578, Speaker G: Talking about FIFo order.
00:13:46.744 - 00:13:51.998, Speaker E: Just generally like the nonexistence. You could do whatever kind of ordering.
00:13:52.014 - 00:13:52.902, Speaker G: You like for this.
00:13:52.956 - 00:13:54.962, Speaker D: What does that say about general purpose roll ups?
00:13:55.026 - 00:13:58.650, Speaker B: Yes. Do you think as like a mechanism?
00:13:59.630 - 00:14:03.366, Speaker G: I think you can generalize it in certain senses construct.
00:14:03.478 - 00:14:04.666, Speaker D: It's a bullshit answer.
00:14:04.768 - 00:14:06.874, Speaker E: Oh no, actually I have a very specific.
00:14:06.992 - 00:14:10.982, Speaker G: It's fair, but there are specific classes.
00:14:11.046 - 00:14:15.674, Speaker E: Of protocols for which you can actually use the same trick in a lot of cases.
00:14:15.722 - 00:14:15.982, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:16.036 - 00:14:19.406, Speaker E: Like what does it mean for things to be consistent? We know what that means in terms.
00:14:19.428 - 00:14:22.846, Speaker G: Of market means in terms of like auctions, right.
00:14:22.948 - 00:14:24.894, Speaker E: There are answers you could make in this case.
00:14:25.012 - 00:14:26.538, Speaker G: I'm not saying you can do this for application.
00:14:26.644 - 00:14:28.782, Speaker E: I'm sure, there's some funny little impossibility.
00:14:28.846 - 00:14:31.106, Speaker G: Result where you construct an application, and.
00:14:31.128 - 00:14:33.058, Speaker E: That'S fine, but, like, 99% of the.
00:14:33.064 - 00:14:34.994, Speaker G: Stuff that we do right now, these.
00:14:35.032 - 00:14:37.222, Speaker E: Two applications, so why not just get.
00:14:37.276 - 00:14:39.382, Speaker G: Good and make them right?
00:14:39.436 - 00:14:40.440, Speaker E: That's my answer.
00:14:40.810 - 00:14:42.902, Speaker D: But then this begs the question of.
00:14:42.956 - 00:14:45.746, Speaker H: All those mitigation mechanisms involve consensus somehow.
00:14:45.778 - 00:14:50.266, Speaker D: Interacting with the application. Throw ups do not do that.
00:14:50.288 - 00:14:51.820, Speaker E: I don't know, and that's fine.
00:14:52.830 - 00:14:54.246, Speaker H: I think that's a philosophical.
00:14:54.358 - 00:14:55.706, Speaker D: That gets back to the debate of.
00:14:55.728 - 00:14:59.386, Speaker H: The last panel, which is, topically, how.
00:14:59.408 - 00:15:08.190, Speaker D: Much do you want your application intertwined with consensus or not? And that's like a religious choice. Yeah, it's like the choice being an atheist or christian.
00:15:13.350 - 00:15:21.026, Speaker A: I didn't think theology on this stage. Janek. You guys are building something different.
00:15:21.128 - 00:15:22.962, Speaker B: So what's your on this?
00:15:23.016 - 00:15:41.400, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess I have to defend it. Yeah, we're building this encrypted mempool thing, which prevents front running, I would say change. And I don't think it has. Of course, it has some disadvantages, so it's not.
00:15:42.510 - 00:15:44.634, Speaker B: But it's definitely one approach we should think.
00:15:44.672 - 00:15:57.374, Speaker C: There's probably lots of other approaches we should try and roll ups give us to do that. So I don't really see why we should give up in mitigating Mev. I don't think we should embrace it. I think we should do both.
00:15:57.412 - 00:15:59.630, Speaker G: We should both embrace.
00:16:00.530 - 00:16:09.778, Speaker A: Interesting. So you're saying that we can do both at the same time. Okay. All right. Anybody has anything to add, maybe comments on.
00:16:09.784 - 00:16:11.474, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree with him.
00:16:11.512 - 00:16:12.100, Speaker F: Right.
00:16:13.190 - 00:16:17.700, Speaker B: Well, I think lacking, like, rigorous taxonomy for me.
00:16:18.730 - 00:16:20.150, Speaker A: Should we just spend the next hour.
00:16:20.220 - 00:16:22.040, Speaker B: Arguing about what MeV means?
00:16:22.650 - 00:16:26.358, Speaker F: But when people say Mev, a lot.
00:16:26.364 - 00:16:29.094, Speaker B: Of the time they think of, which.
00:16:29.132 - 00:16:33.078, Speaker F: Is they think of stuff that's harmful to users, and I think it's evident.
00:16:33.174 - 00:16:38.486, Speaker B: That anything that's better for the user experience should be considered and should be implemented.
00:16:38.598 - 00:16:44.334, Speaker F: Ultimately, you want the system to get to as close to mass adoption as possible and to be as much as.
00:16:44.372 - 00:16:46.958, Speaker B: User friendly as possible, that there's a.
00:16:46.964 - 00:16:56.740, Speaker F: Lot of other types of extractable value that can be harnessed in the protocol. Of course, regulatory friendly, which also means.
00:16:57.110 - 00:16:58.450, Speaker A: No, let's not go there.
00:16:58.520 - 00:16:59.780, Speaker F: Let's not go there.
00:17:01.590 - 00:17:02.974, Speaker B: It means to users.
00:17:03.022 - 00:17:07.240, Speaker F: Right. The regulators are okay.
00:17:10.170 - 00:17:11.160, Speaker B: Of course.
00:17:11.850 - 00:17:21.066, Speaker D: So I guess I would maybe put out one possible. There is the whole, like, if the.
00:17:21.088 - 00:17:23.034, Speaker H: Only thing you have is everything looks.
00:17:23.072 - 00:17:32.074, Speaker D: Like a nail problem, that often happens in crypto. I somehow think the fact that we cannot even decide on even minuscule definition.
00:17:32.122 - 00:17:44.350, Speaker H: Of which types of actions qualify means that any mitigation mechanism you have will actually verify whether it mitigated the correct thing or not, or cause another externality.
00:17:44.770 - 00:17:46.286, Speaker D: The fact that we can't even define.
00:17:46.318 - 00:17:49.138, Speaker H: What an externality to an MEV is.
00:17:49.224 - 00:17:51.966, Speaker D: Formally is a distinct failure of this industry.
00:17:52.078 - 00:17:53.586, Speaker A: I mean, we can't even define what.
00:17:53.608 - 00:17:55.140, Speaker B: A roll up is, right?
00:17:55.770 - 00:17:57.362, Speaker D: But that's a distinct failure.
00:17:57.426 - 00:17:58.726, Speaker G: That means that we have way to.
00:17:58.748 - 00:18:00.790, Speaker D: Go before we can even talk about mitigation.
00:18:02.970 - 00:18:16.758, Speaker A: Next question. Value extraction is a centralizing force. How should we combat the resulting negative? Talking about externalities.
00:18:16.854 - 00:18:18.106, Speaker E: Wait, sorry, what was the question?
00:18:18.208 - 00:18:32.000, Speaker A: So some say that MeV can be a centralizing force. And how do we combat the resultant externalities? Negative, like censorship. Censorship and stuff like that.
00:18:35.350 - 00:18:36.482, Speaker E: Well, I think you have a result.
00:18:36.536 - 00:18:39.202, Speaker G: On some part of this, at least.
00:18:39.256 - 00:18:40.334, Speaker E: Actually recently released.
00:18:40.382 - 00:18:41.700, Speaker D: Still working. Yeah.
00:18:42.950 - 00:18:44.370, Speaker A: Some alpha maybe?
00:18:44.520 - 00:18:47.860, Speaker D: No, that's fine. It'll come out when it comes out.
00:18:49.110 - 00:18:51.140, Speaker A: All right, anybody else?
00:18:52.810 - 00:18:54.360, Speaker F: Sorry, Yannick, go.
00:18:54.970 - 00:18:56.246, Speaker B: Not really answering the question.
00:18:56.268 - 00:19:03.354, Speaker C: But I would also say just because MeV is a central doesn't mean we should give into that force like we.
00:19:03.392 - 00:19:06.714, Speaker B: Could other forces to kind of counteract that.
00:19:06.752 - 00:19:12.698, Speaker C: Like for example, simply social rules that we don't accept certain types of behavior.
00:19:12.794 - 00:19:14.320, Speaker B: If that's possible at all.
00:19:15.730 - 00:19:16.480, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:17.570 - 00:19:19.486, Speaker A: Alex, anything to add?
00:19:19.668 - 00:19:24.274, Speaker F: I agree with Yannick. And generally, I think you kind of made two distinct points.
00:19:24.392 - 00:19:30.578, Speaker B: I think there's like a rich get richer dynamic of MeV, and you want.
00:19:30.744 - 00:19:39.458, Speaker F: That as much as possible. And so this is more about redistribution mechanisms. I think it's relatively underexplored as it's.
00:19:39.474 - 00:19:42.066, Speaker B: Like most welfare maximizing.
00:19:42.098 - 00:19:44.230, Speaker F: And again, I guess optimism's position is.
00:19:44.300 - 00:19:46.310, Speaker B: Well, invest in public goods.
00:19:46.730 - 00:19:49.786, Speaker F: People working on order flow auctions are saying, well, you give a rebate to.
00:19:49.808 - 00:19:52.006, Speaker B: The user welfare maximizing.
00:19:52.038 - 00:19:57.094, Speaker F: I guess the work that these guys did is looking, for example, an instance.
00:19:57.142 - 00:20:00.038, Speaker B: Of saying, well, it can be welfare.
00:20:00.054 - 00:20:03.310, Speaker F: Maximizing for the overall system and maybe not for the particular user.
00:20:04.770 - 00:20:08.442, Speaker D: I think the main idea there is like if you redistribute the MEV, captured.
00:20:08.506 - 00:20:14.350, Speaker H: In some manner, that part is constructing the cryptographic mechanism such that the redistribution.
00:20:14.430 - 00:20:16.654, Speaker D: Has very low cost of corruption.
00:20:16.782 - 00:20:20.834, Speaker H: But if you could do, then you.
00:20:20.872 - 00:20:24.914, Speaker D: Could basically actually rebate users so much that you can lower the inflation rate.
00:20:24.952 - 00:20:36.466, Speaker H: Of the overall protocol, which MEV, as a subsidy to users is more than block rewards, right? And that's sort of a kind of powerful.
00:20:36.658 - 00:20:47.866, Speaker D: You have to bootstrap your network with block rewards until the point at which actually redistributing MEV means that you can have to inflate as high. And I think obviously cosmos sort of.
00:20:47.888 - 00:20:49.350, Speaker H: Is to go in that direction.
00:20:49.430 - 00:20:51.546, Speaker D: Sort of. I mean there are too many conflating.
00:20:51.578 - 00:20:53.406, Speaker H: Factors in Adam toot thing.
00:20:53.428 - 00:21:11.826, Speaker E: But I think I have a new name for your paper which is incentive compatible communism question mark. I think the hard part about a lot of these mechanisms, right, is this notion of incentive compatibility. It's very easy to just have an agreement off chain to be like, all right, cool. Yeah, sure, we could redistribute some of.
00:21:11.848 - 00:21:14.114, Speaker G: The, I could just submit exactly one.
00:21:14.152 - 00:21:17.506, Speaker E: Bid that has zero actual value, but.
00:21:17.528 - 00:21:19.638, Speaker G: We all agree, perform the auction and.
00:21:19.644 - 00:21:21.122, Speaker E: Redistribute the profits ourselves.
00:21:21.266 - 00:21:27.206, Speaker D: Yeah, prefacing it with that. I would say that if we ever.
00:21:27.228 - 00:21:33.594, Speaker H: Get to a world even threshold fhe works on chain. Now obviously that's pipe dream for anyone.
00:21:33.632 - 00:21:35.820, Speaker D: Who'S ever tried to implement these types of things.
00:21:37.550 - 00:21:40.880, Speaker H: There are ways to actually achieve this.
00:21:41.410 - 00:21:44.334, Speaker D: So I would say that we could.
00:21:44.372 - 00:21:47.534, Speaker H: Actually get to a good redistribution, but.
00:21:47.572 - 00:21:50.270, Speaker D: It sort of effectively needs homomorphic encryption.
00:21:51.010 - 00:21:53.378, Speaker A: Could you expand on the ways in.
00:21:53.384 - 00:21:54.638, Speaker G: Which you could achieve.
00:21:54.814 - 00:22:01.282, Speaker D: So basically if we take kind of like the Eigen layer model one step.
00:22:01.336 - 00:22:04.066, Speaker H: Further, right, where restake their stake and.
00:22:04.088 - 00:22:10.102, Speaker D: There'S some slashing rules that are socially agreed upon for certain applications. One level further for that would actually.
00:22:10.156 - 00:22:13.474, Speaker H: Be proving just like as a ZK.
00:22:13.522 - 00:22:15.426, Speaker D: Proof, but proving that on encrypted inputs.
00:22:15.458 - 00:22:20.886, Speaker H: That you the correct output for an auction or for subsets of auctions do that.
00:22:20.908 - 00:22:24.266, Speaker D: Then you can basically show that the person had to have redistributed because they.
00:22:24.288 - 00:22:26.358, Speaker H: Ran the code that does the redistribution.
00:22:26.534 - 00:22:29.162, Speaker D: To all the people who restaked to that particular.
00:22:29.296 - 00:22:30.540, Speaker G: But doesn't this go?
00:22:31.550 - 00:22:36.030, Speaker E: Now you have an app that is like tightly controlled with consensus.
00:22:37.010 - 00:22:39.070, Speaker D: This is why it gets back to religious difference.
00:22:39.140 - 00:22:39.326, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:39.348 - 00:22:40.160, Speaker E: Okay, good.
00:22:40.690 - 00:22:50.500, Speaker A: So basically what you're saying is that we should tightly couple rather than making, I'll use the popular word, right?
00:22:51.350 - 00:22:53.666, Speaker D: I mean the PBS model is sort.
00:22:53.688 - 00:22:55.506, Speaker H: Of in that direction, right?
00:22:55.528 - 00:22:57.126, Speaker D: Like Ethereum is clearly moving in the.
00:22:57.148 - 00:23:00.886, Speaker H: Direction of coupling to consensus. Now the question is what is the.
00:23:00.908 - 00:23:02.786, Speaker D: Correct way of coupling it to consensus.
00:23:02.898 - 00:23:08.418, Speaker H: Such that it's not affecting extra bad latency for the user.
00:23:08.514 - 00:23:16.458, Speaker D: Not that much of an improvement over the off chain auction, right. Both improve in user usability and in.
00:23:16.624 - 00:23:18.666, Speaker H: Sort of censorship resistance same time.
00:23:18.688 - 00:23:25.520, Speaker D: And if you're not doing that, everyone will just go back to the off chain. It doesn't make sense.
00:23:27.490 - 00:23:28.560, Speaker B: Fair enough.
00:23:32.050 - 00:23:35.954, Speaker A: About PBS. What are your opinions on PBS? Should we go that way?
00:23:35.992 - 00:23:37.490, Speaker B: Or different route.
00:23:38.870 - 00:23:42.130, Speaker G: I have no opinions about PBS.
00:23:42.630 - 00:23:44.290, Speaker B: I'm happy to talk about it.
00:23:44.440 - 00:23:48.614, Speaker F: Yeah, it depends what you mean by PBS, right?
00:23:48.732 - 00:23:51.494, Speaker B: If you mean generally the between who.
00:23:51.532 - 00:23:54.006, Speaker F: Constructs a block and who proposes it.
00:23:54.108 - 00:23:58.754, Speaker A: Or more concrete version, the Ethereum has been people in Ethereum.
00:23:58.802 - 00:24:10.210, Speaker B: Okay. So even within Ethereum protocol PBS and protocol PBS, I think it's not clear yet whether it, and I think that's.
00:24:10.310 - 00:24:20.346, Speaker F: At least my personal view. I think there's a lot of more work that needs to be done to understand the market economics.
00:24:20.378 - 00:24:24.242, Speaker B: And also I'll point you post from.
00:24:24.296 - 00:24:31.700, Speaker F: Barnaby that talks about he kind of explains the full block PBS auction as.
00:24:33.990 - 00:24:38.634, Speaker B: Generalizing this to allowing validators to arbitrary preferences on block.
00:24:38.782 - 00:24:45.794, Speaker F: So if you have a credible commitment, a credible mechanism for commitments between builders.
00:24:45.842 - 00:24:48.198, Speaker B: And one commitment can be, I want.
00:24:48.204 - 00:24:51.066, Speaker F: You to give me a full block. Another commitment can be, I want you.
00:24:51.088 - 00:24:52.426, Speaker B: To give me a full block with.
00:24:52.608 - 00:24:54.346, Speaker F: This and this thing, or like a.
00:24:54.368 - 00:24:56.490, Speaker B: Partial block, given some rules.
00:24:56.830 - 00:25:07.802, Speaker F: And that I think is quite interesting. Again, it's relatively underexplored, but it makes a lot of sense. Yeah, there's the trade off of adding.
00:25:07.866 - 00:25:18.946, Speaker B: More overhead on validators. And so that has to be considered. But I think you can have negligible in the kind of templates that they.
00:25:18.968 - 00:25:24.194, Speaker F: Can look at, but giving them a lot more explicitity about what they want.
00:25:24.232 - 00:25:31.654, Speaker B: Which is ultimately, I think my trouble with the current PBS currently like full.
00:25:31.692 - 00:25:34.646, Speaker F: Block, and it has some benefits. There's a lot of features you can.
00:25:34.668 - 00:25:36.470, Speaker B: Build on top of that as builders.
00:25:37.050 - 00:25:43.578, Speaker F: But at the same time it has a lot of drawbacks. Yeah, so I think the jury is.
00:25:43.584 - 00:25:45.542, Speaker G: Still out of protocol.
00:25:45.606 - 00:25:47.226, Speaker F: It's not clear how it's implemented in.
00:25:47.248 - 00:25:49.082, Speaker B: Protocol way that makes sense.
00:25:49.136 - 00:25:50.570, Speaker F: There's like a two slot.
00:25:52.270 - 00:25:52.794, Speaker B: Right now.
00:25:52.832 - 00:25:54.810, Speaker F: That was proposed by Vitalik.
00:25:56.110 - 00:26:00.670, Speaker B: I would evolve in the future if Ethereum moves to something like single slot finality.
00:26:01.090 - 00:26:09.566, Speaker F: And so there's a lot of these questions that have to be considered with protocol PBS and also how it interacts.
00:26:09.598 - 00:26:14.210, Speaker B: With future upgrades of the Ethereum network beyond single slot finality.
00:26:15.450 - 00:26:17.320, Speaker A: Any other opinions on this?
00:26:19.850 - 00:26:42.898, Speaker C: Maybe the general question about PBS, should we do that or not? I would say probably too late for that question. PBS is there and will be very hard to convince, to give up a big fraction of their rewards. So what we have to do now, basically is to improve the as much as possible. And that can be either outside or inside of the protocol.
00:26:43.014 - 00:26:47.546, Speaker A: The question is more should we shrine it or should we keep it separate to the consensus?
00:26:47.738 - 00:26:50.640, Speaker B: I wouldn't shrine it right now. To be clear.
00:26:52.770 - 00:26:55.738, Speaker F: The work that went behind the IP 1559, to include it.
00:26:55.764 - 00:26:57.906, Speaker B: In protocol reasoning, that went into it.
00:26:57.928 - 00:27:01.778, Speaker F: Like the paper from Tim Roth Garden, the many simulations, the work that the.
00:27:01.784 - 00:27:03.970, Speaker B: Robot did, and they compare that to.
00:27:04.040 - 00:27:09.154, Speaker F: The formal reasoning around PV, no comparison. So I think it deserves a lot more scrutiny.
00:27:09.202 - 00:27:11.686, Speaker B: And again, just from that article from.
00:27:11.708 - 00:27:13.606, Speaker F: Barnaby, there's a big design space for.
00:27:13.628 - 00:27:14.502, Speaker B: How that should be.
00:27:14.636 - 00:27:17.670, Speaker F: Generally separating a lot of the heavier.
00:27:18.090 - 00:27:24.506, Speaker B: Computing tasks that to do in the past to more specialized parties makes sense.
00:27:24.688 - 00:27:29.786, Speaker F: It's like a separation of concerns that makes sense. How exactly do you separate this to.
00:27:29.808 - 00:27:31.378, Speaker B: Preserve fees of Ethereum?
00:27:31.494 - 00:27:33.498, Speaker F: It's still something that needs to be understood.
00:27:33.674 - 00:27:36.586, Speaker B: How does this new market that's created.
00:27:36.618 - 00:27:38.778, Speaker F: Interact with the other markets in Ethereum?
00:27:38.874 - 00:27:42.954, Speaker B: Fees on Ethereum also has to be understood better.
00:27:43.092 - 00:27:45.586, Speaker F: So my opinion, personal opinion, is it.
00:27:45.608 - 00:27:50.434, Speaker B: Should definitely include it in protocol right now and requires more.
00:27:50.632 - 00:27:54.260, Speaker A: I mean, knowing ethereum, it's not going to be included anytime soon.
00:27:58.170 - 00:28:16.458, Speaker H: I think the last thing I'd say is people in crypto, for some reason, probably just don't seem to pay literatures. But there's this very famous trilemma in the algorithmic game theory literature from 2000.
00:28:16.624 - 00:28:20.474, Speaker D: May 2000 called the credibility trilemma, which.
00:28:20.512 - 00:28:27.374, Speaker H: Is in some ways the existence of flashbots is proof that ETH has not.
00:28:27.412 - 00:28:36.846, Speaker D: Gone over the credibility trilemma. It's funny when multiple fields love the same word, because I hate the word trilemma.
00:28:36.878 - 00:28:40.126, Speaker H: It's like, wait, the etymology of lemma.
00:28:40.238 - 00:28:43.074, Speaker A: So you're saying scalability trilemma is not a real thing.
00:28:43.112 - 00:28:44.606, Speaker G: No, trilemma.
00:28:44.798 - 00:28:46.178, Speaker D: Right. Like if you think about the etymology.
00:28:46.194 - 00:28:48.854, Speaker H: Of lemma in Latin versus like I.
00:28:48.892 - 00:28:59.538, Speaker D: In front of it doesn't read correctly. But anyway, the credibility trilemma is the following thing. There exists no auction with unbounded computational.
00:28:59.714 - 00:29:06.586, Speaker H: Bid auctioneers such that you have the following three properties. One is credibility that the bidders have.
00:29:06.608 - 00:29:11.158, Speaker D: To trust whether the auctioneer is lying or not. Like they can actually believe.
00:29:11.264 - 00:29:13.774, Speaker H: They don't even need some mechanism by.
00:29:13.812 - 00:29:20.030, Speaker D: Which they can observe the bids, and they never have to actually try to prove that the auctioneer is lying.
00:29:20.930 - 00:29:24.450, Speaker A: The second lying, from the perspective of submitting.
00:29:26.870 - 00:29:31.726, Speaker D: The simplest example of this is suppose you have a second price auction. Second price auction.
00:29:31.838 - 00:29:34.530, Speaker H: The highest bidder pays the bid of the second high.
00:29:34.680 - 00:29:40.006, Speaker D: That bid is really high. Well, the auctioneer can just lie by putting in a bid arbitrarily close to.
00:29:40.028 - 00:29:43.378, Speaker H: The highest bidder and then forcing and force auction.
00:29:43.474 - 00:29:45.154, Speaker D: So that's a sense in which it's not credible.
00:29:45.202 - 00:29:47.638, Speaker H: Like the auctioneer bids, they can be.
00:29:47.644 - 00:29:51.146, Speaker D: Censoring bids, they can be adding bids. So it changes the outcome of the.
00:29:51.168 - 00:29:53.622, Speaker H: Auction property is truthfulness.
00:29:53.686 - 00:29:55.866, Speaker D: Like people report the value that they.
00:29:55.888 - 00:29:59.098, Speaker H: Actually, that the object has, that they're bidding on.
00:29:59.184 - 00:30:02.350, Speaker D: And the third thing is bounded communication.
00:30:02.690 - 00:30:04.958, Speaker H: The trilemma says you only get two, three of those.
00:30:05.044 - 00:30:13.866, Speaker D: So the unique, credible, bounded communication time auction. The unique, truthful, bounded communication auction, auction clock auctions.
00:30:13.898 - 00:30:17.806, Speaker H: The unique, credible, not bounded communication auction.
00:30:17.838 - 00:30:28.070, Speaker D: And somehow understanding the edge cases of all these things should be very well understood far before you ever install PBS into the protocol.
00:30:30.330 - 00:30:52.480, Speaker A: So if not PBS, there's another proposal that is being discussed. It's shutterized blockchain. So using thresholding to basically mitigate Mav, if you allow me to. What are your opinions on that, Yannick? Of course.
00:30:54.210 - 00:31:02.894, Speaker C: Again, that's one of the mitigation minimization. I think the two approaches, they don't really oppose each other.
00:31:02.932 - 00:31:04.260, Speaker B: You could implement both.
00:31:04.630 - 00:31:14.180, Speaker C: And I would guess that even if we, I think it's very, this will be implemented in Ethereum, but if it would be, then there would probably a.
00:31:15.190 - 00:31:17.590, Speaker B: PBS above that as well.
00:31:17.740 - 00:31:19.126, Speaker F: Why is it unlikely that it would.
00:31:19.148 - 00:31:20.630, Speaker G: Be implemented on Ethereum?
00:31:21.930 - 00:31:38.410, Speaker C: Because it adds basically additional security assumptions. You have to trust a fraction of a randomly selected fraction of validators more than others. And it's also just a very somewhat complicated.
00:31:39.150 - 00:31:40.620, Speaker D: Can I ask a quick question?
00:31:40.990 - 00:31:42.602, Speaker H: Do you have to use it separately.
00:31:42.746 - 00:31:47.246, Speaker D: Or can it be shared with the consensus as DKG? If consensus had a DKG, no, the.
00:31:47.268 - 00:31:49.290, Speaker C: DKG would be done out of the consensus.
00:31:49.370 - 00:32:22.460, Speaker A: Okay. Anything else to add on that said? Next question. Okay, ration of l two s. The behavior of the builders who are going to extract MEV change somehow the behavior and the paths to the most optimal are going to be the same going forward.
00:32:24.190 - 00:32:44.414, Speaker F: So builders don't extract MeV, right. MEV is mostly extracted by values who take most of the profits, if not all of it. I think, again, what I mentioned before, right? There's like users on the other side of that equation. And right now some instances of MEV.
00:32:44.542 - 00:32:49.682, Speaker B: Can be exploitative to users. And so thinking about kickback that are.
00:32:49.736 - 00:32:53.650, Speaker F: Welfare maximizing for users of the system is valuable.
00:32:54.390 - 00:32:56.600, Speaker B: So I think we'll see more of that for sure.
00:32:57.370 - 00:33:08.170, Speaker A: I meant more from the perspective of how important is it going to be in the future in terms of over MEV profits?
00:33:09.310 - 00:33:12.566, Speaker H: You're asking what percentage of MeV profit.
00:33:12.598 - 00:33:13.994, Speaker D: Is cross chain, right?
00:33:14.112 - 00:33:18.266, Speaker H: Yeah, 1 January 2030 percentage, I guess.
00:33:18.368 - 00:33:20.778, Speaker F: Only between roll ups doesn't have to.
00:33:20.784 - 00:33:25.478, Speaker B: Be between roll ups, just in including centralized exchanges.
00:33:25.574 - 00:33:26.220, Speaker A: No.
00:33:28.990 - 00:33:29.430, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:33:29.440 - 00:33:32.846, Speaker F: I mean, it's a function of volume. And how adopted are these systems?
00:33:32.878 - 00:33:39.940, Speaker B: It's a function of how many mitigation technologies mitigate against.
00:33:42.630 - 00:33:46.120, Speaker F: The extractable value that is harmful to the user experience.
00:33:47.530 - 00:33:50.902, Speaker B: It's a function of how much value.
00:33:50.956 - 00:33:59.514, Speaker F: Is lost to the molok. So how much extractable value is lost to a lack of coordination. How many coordination mechanisms that are not.
00:33:59.552 - 00:34:07.740, Speaker B: Centralized, coordinated by a centralized coordinator, can exist in ways that unlocks values for the system.
00:34:09.070 - 00:34:10.640, Speaker G: So part of that.
00:34:11.010 - 00:34:13.280, Speaker F: Questions, part of that is understanding better.
00:34:14.210 - 00:34:22.320, Speaker B: How to unlock coordination between parties in the systems. I don't have a number for you.
00:34:23.570 - 00:34:27.950, Speaker A: Yeah, I wasn't expecting.
00:34:28.110 - 00:34:32.660, Speaker H: He wants a distribution supported 100% with no add ins.
00:34:38.310 - 00:34:40.006, Speaker E: I could imagine things, for example, things.
00:34:40.028 - 00:34:42.454, Speaker G: That could become very large or very.
00:34:42.652 - 00:34:44.646, Speaker E: Large in terms of volume, is like.
00:34:44.828 - 00:34:48.390, Speaker G: Routing or arbitrage across chains.
00:34:49.050 - 00:34:50.378, Speaker E: And right now I think players are.
00:34:50.384 - 00:34:52.378, Speaker G: Fairly unsophisticated for that kind of thing.
00:34:52.544 - 00:34:57.414, Speaker E: I don't really know that many players who are truly doing real cross chain shit.
00:34:57.542 - 00:35:02.102, Speaker B: Well, very sophisticated players doing cross centralized.
00:35:02.166 - 00:35:02.566, Speaker G: Centralized.
00:35:02.598 - 00:35:03.326, Speaker D: Oh, no, that's for sure.
00:35:03.348 - 00:35:03.726, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:03.828 - 00:35:05.406, Speaker F: That's the lowest hanging fruit. Right.
00:35:05.428 - 00:35:11.754, Speaker B: Because it's the most against the largest liquidity pools. So if that happens, roll ups gain.
00:35:11.802 - 00:35:17.730, Speaker F: More liquidity and you have more paths to take that are meaningful for these traders, then I think they will do that as well.
00:35:17.800 - 00:35:18.420, Speaker G: Right.
00:35:19.350 - 00:35:23.586, Speaker F: I think it's unsophisticated, partly because the people that know how to do this.
00:35:23.608 - 00:35:27.334, Speaker B: Right now just have other problems, like.
00:35:27.452 - 00:35:29.222, Speaker F: Lower hanging fruits to look at.
00:35:29.276 - 00:35:42.646, Speaker H: I mean, one of the, if you talk to searchers who do this Dexarb across bridge, because with Dexarb you kind of know your net loss before you submit the transaction.
00:35:42.758 - 00:35:44.826, Speaker D: But people who are doing liquidations actually.
00:35:44.848 - 00:35:46.826, Speaker H: Have a ton of problems, because if.
00:35:46.848 - 00:35:49.594, Speaker D: They can't repatriate the liquidation profit from.
00:35:49.632 - 00:35:51.926, Speaker H: The destination chain back to the source.
00:35:51.958 - 00:35:55.454, Speaker D: Chain, they're holding a bag of something that could have gone down 20%.
00:35:55.572 - 00:36:01.214, Speaker H: And so hard to hedge anything that you have to do round first, things.
00:36:01.252 - 00:36:05.460, Speaker D: That you only have to do by unidirectional on bridges. And so that completely changes.
00:36:06.870 - 00:36:08.174, Speaker H: You're hedging on the same exchange.
00:36:08.222 - 00:36:08.482, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:08.536 - 00:36:10.206, Speaker D: It's like my net position on binance.
00:36:10.238 - 00:36:12.642, Speaker H: Or FTX is, I'm shorter per, like.
00:36:12.696 - 00:36:18.434, Speaker D: Long, whatever the collateral I'm selling is. But on bridges, we don't have that.
00:36:18.472 - 00:36:22.066, Speaker H: And so bridges bring services like letting.
00:36:22.098 - 00:36:23.410, Speaker D: You hedge your liquidation.
00:36:23.570 - 00:36:27.910, Speaker H: You may start seeing bridges, look like exchanges.
00:36:30.590 - 00:36:33.974, Speaker F: I was going to say already today some of the largest bridges are centralized exchanges.
00:36:34.022 - 00:36:34.620, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:35.710 - 00:36:36.362, Speaker G: Yeah.
00:36:36.496 - 00:36:39.206, Speaker B: My favorite bridge on Binance and Coinbase.
00:36:39.238 - 00:36:43.600, Speaker H: Yeah, halfway, somewhere in the middle.
00:36:44.370 - 00:36:50.320, Speaker A: Yeah. But it's not really a trust bridges there. It's quite centralized as well.
00:36:52.930 - 00:36:56.686, Speaker B: Guys, unfortunately, I would have loved to.
00:36:56.708 - 00:37:03.440, Speaker A: Continue discussing stuff, but, yeah, thanks, everyone, for listening. Big round of applause to this, guys.
00:37:04.610 - 00:37:05.360, Speaker G: You.
00:37:08.490 - 00:37:08.980, Speaker D: There you go.
