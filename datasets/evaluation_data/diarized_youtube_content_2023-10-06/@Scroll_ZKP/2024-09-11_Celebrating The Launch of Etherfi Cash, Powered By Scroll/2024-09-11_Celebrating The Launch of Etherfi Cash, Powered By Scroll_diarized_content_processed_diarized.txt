00:00:03.680 - 00:00:15.310, Speaker A: Okay. Hello. Hello, everybody. It is. What day is it today? God, Tuesday. I think Tuesday. And we have an amazing group of people to talk today.
00:00:15.310 - 00:00:31.570, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Emily. I'm hosting a stream today with Etherfi and Sandy from scroll, but I'm gonna let them introduce themselves. So I'll start off, I guess. Sandy, I know who you are. Why don't you tell everyone else who you are?
00:00:32.550 - 00:01:05.334, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, I'm Sandy. I'm one of the co founders for scroll. And super happy to be here to introduce one of our key partners, Etherfi. And here to support their latest product launch. So I think the Etherfi team needs no introduction. I think they were super early on the LRT train and was super timely in terms of executing like liquid. The liquid product and the cash product is something that's super exciting and super refreshing.
00:01:05.334 - 00:01:20.690, Speaker B: And I think it's one of the first really ambitious attempts to break out of the crypto bubble and to enable people to live a truly on chain life. So, really excited to welcome Mike to our livestream and over to you, Mike.
00:01:22.950 - 00:01:43.330, Speaker C: Hey, great to be here. Yeah. Excited to have this conversation. Yeah, I mean, etherprise goal ultimately is to make Defi easy for normal people. And I think this card launch in partnership with scroll is a big part of that. So, yeah, really pumped to be having this conversation.
00:01:46.830 - 00:01:54.282, Speaker A: Cool. And then rock, I'll let you, I guess, cap off if anything. Otherwise we can just deep dive into ether phi, right?
00:01:54.306 - 00:02:11.226, Speaker D: Yeah, sounds good. I was telling Emily before I got on, I just rolled out of bed. So I'm crypto anon this morning, but I'm sure everyone will appreciate that. So, yeah, my name is Rock. I'm one of the co founders. I run the growth side of things. And so super excited to be partnering with scroll.
00:02:11.226 - 00:02:21.556, Speaker D: We've been talking to them about a variety of different things and yeah, I think beautify cache is super exciting and they've been really fun to work with on it. So thanks for having us and look forward to chatting.
00:02:21.668 - 00:02:31.400, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, awesome. I think I just want to like set the stage and level set for everybody. Like, what is Etherfi cache for those of the uninitiated out there?
00:02:33.820 - 00:03:20.230, Speaker C: Yeah. So e three cash is. I guess maybe I'll take a step back. So Ethy has three products, which is we look at a sort of like the MVP of giving people a suite of financial tools to be able to live their life on chain. And those three products are Etherfy steak, Etherfried Liquid, and Etherfy Cash. Stake is the liquid staking and restaking product. Liquid is a defi strategy vault product, and cash is a non custodial walleth and credit card that lets users either spend their crypto one to one with no, you know, no extra fees or borrow against their defi positions.
00:03:20.230 - 00:03:31.030, Speaker C: So it's the first and only crypto card that actually lets you spend and borrow against your defi position. So it's really the card for crypto natives.
00:03:31.530 - 00:04:13.564, Speaker A: Yeah. That's pretty insane. When I saw this announcement, I was like, oh, I was getting goosebumps because I was like, number one, wow, this exists. Number two, it's on scroll. So I was like, this is great, but I want to talk a little bit about that. What's the motivation for kind of breaking out? And I feel like credit card seems, at least from my, what do you call it, Normie point of view, really ambitious, especially with the regulatory landscape. I'm curious from the Etherfi team, maybe just like, you know, rationale for there and then, Sandy, feel free to, I guess, chime in wherever you want with like, I don't know, your opinions about credit card general stuff in DeFi.
00:04:13.564 - 00:04:16.280, Speaker A: I didn't form a set question, but I hope that was.
00:04:19.260 - 00:05:29.410, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, for us, it's basically just a way to create this sort of natural progression of, you know, for on chain users, you know, crypto native. So, you know, you want to be able to hold eTh, USD, stables and BTC, you want to be able to stake them so that you earn some, some level of rewards with a relatively low risk. Then you want to be able to, you know, deploy those into DeFi if you want, take a higher risk and hopefully earn a higher rewards. And then finally you want to be able to use those, you know, those assets in real life. So the cash, wallet and card is really just a way to connect, you know, your on chain life to your real life in a really easy, seamless way. And for sure, I mean, it's a lot harder, it's a lot more work than just sort of, you know, doing another Defi protocol smart contract thing. It does require interfacing with kind of reality and a more regulatory landscape.
00:05:29.410 - 00:05:36.370, Speaker C: But I mean, it's, that's what you need to do in order to actually connect this stuff to people's real life.
00:05:37.630 - 00:06:27.180, Speaker B: I think one thing that's really interesting from my perspective, and I have a question for Mike and rock, is that previously, I think we've seen a lot of attempts where the Defi community tries to interface with more of a tradfi setup, and payment is one of the most, like, fundamental and core of traffic fabrics. So the speed at which they move and communicate is super different from the way djens and people on chain interact with each other. So my question is, like, how big is the cash team? How long did it take you guys to put this together? And were there any challenges with the speed at which things move in crypto in terms of expectation and also how like a very traditional kind of payment industry counterparts move and how did you find that process?
00:06:30.200 - 00:07:28.850, Speaker C: So the whole Etherpride team is about 21, 22 people right now. I mean, I guess in one way or another, everybody's kind of supporting the cash product, but the core cash team, I think, is five or six people now that are working on it kind of day to day. You know, we've been talking about and working on this product for the last, like five or six months. I don't know, those are like the rough timelines, which is pretty fast for rolling out a, you know, a card program. And we have a good suite of partners that, you know, that have made that easier rather than kind of doing it 100% ourselves. And that includes, you know, the. Obviously includes you guys, includes folks that are helping on the credit card side, the, you know, AML, KYC, all the fun stuff that we got to do.
00:07:32.390 - 00:07:44.540, Speaker B: So I understand there's obviously restraints on a regulatory perspective, but do you see any path of bringing this to, say, like, an audience in the US in the next few years?
00:07:45.960 - 00:08:28.710, Speaker C: I doubt that we'll be able to do it or we'd want to do it in the US unless something really dramatically changes. So, yeah, so probably not in the US, but we're hoping to expand the jurisdictions that we're able to offer it in. Right now we have Hong Kong and a few good number of countries in the eude that we're aiming to get this out for, but, yeah, no plans in the near term to offer it to the US because the rest of our products are not available for us users, so it wouldn't really make sense for us to offer the card there as well.
00:08:29.810 - 00:08:31.546, Speaker A: Yeah, totally makes sense.
00:08:31.738 - 00:09:10.130, Speaker D: I think it might be helpful too, just going through that. When we got into this, working through it, one of our so reap is the credit card provider. And we've worked with them and they've, you know, they work with visa and they have a list of countries that they can go through, but there's actually a ton of work on our end going through each country individually to kind of get spun up and get up and going. So, you know, we'd love to be in every country possible, you know, but it takes time and the more place we can get, the better the US landscape is, you know, not, not the most friendly to crypto. I guess I'll just say that. So there's too much like risk to take on with that.
00:09:12.390 - 00:09:21.650, Speaker B: But like any one time, there's like a number of product you could go after. Right. How do you guys come up with these like, you know, new product ideas and how do you prioritize?
00:09:24.750 - 00:10:10.200, Speaker C: I mean, with this suite, I guess this first suite of products that we have, I mean, really, it comes from user needs and really, I guess, ourselves as being users, being to some extent drivers of that. It is this kind of natural progression from wanting to hold your assets in a non custodial way, to be able to stake them, to be able to deploy them, to defi and then use them in real life. So it is kind of this natural suite of use cases that serves as this MVP to be able to be, you know, on chain kind of entirely and hopefully over time, you know, off board from trad five.
00:10:12.340 - 00:10:26.428, Speaker A: Yeah. So I kind of want to talk about like the decision making matrix when it comes to launching a credit card. Right. Defi is very expansive. I think we've seen at least some, a few credit cards. I think Coinbase had a credit card. Oh, there's a ton of.
00:10:26.428 - 00:10:50.090, Speaker A: Right, yeah, like, there's a ton of them. Not as many that I'm exposed to, but, you know, what factors made you decide? Well, okay, sorry. Two pieces. Right. For those who don't know the details, like what features is Etherefi? Cash providing? And then kind of the meat and potatoes of like, why choose these features? And what does it mean for a credit card that differentiates itself in those ways?
00:10:51.910 - 00:11:16.916, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. I think that's a good point. Maybe it's helpful to give a quick summary with etherpray cache I mentioned. So it's a. Think of it as just very concretely, it's a mobile app. You can use it on your web browser or at some point in the next few weeks you'll be able to just download it on the app store. It's a mobile app, it'll have a crypto wallet.
00:11:16.916 - 00:12:11.078, Speaker C: So you'll be able to hold your crypto inside the wallet in this app and attached to it will be a credit cardinal, this credit card or the wallet. You'll be able to load your Etherfi assets as well as USD stables. And so you can put stables or your Etherfy stuff in this wallet and then the card lets you either spend your USD stables, so, you know, USDC, DAi, USDT, and it will let you borrow against your defi positions or. Or your Etherfi assets. So if you have some stake deep with Etherfi, you'll be able to borrow against it by using the card. And there's a whole bunch of benefits and perks. There's 8% cashback on the first $1,000.
00:12:11.078 - 00:13:07.894, Speaker C: So it's just a nice perk to kind of get you started. And then there's kind of an ongoing 3% cashback on the card and a host of other crypto benefits, like different tiers. You'll be able to get things like conference passes to token, which is a pretty big deal. And the interest rate that you pay on the crypto card is a lot lower than what you'd be paying on a traditional credit card. The FX rate is much lower than what you'd be paying on traditional card, the higher tiers. I think there is no effects fee, which is pretty unusual for a credit card. I'm probably missing a bunch of benefits, but those are the highlights.
00:13:07.894 - 00:13:46.980, Speaker C: So we're pretty excited about it. Our hope is that this is going to be the best credit card altogether. Not just the best crypto card, but specifically talking about other cards. And there's a lot of them out there. So it's hard for me to say this is true of every single card, but the challenges that most crypto cards have is that, first off, they tend to not be credit cards. They tend to just be prepaid debit cards. So that has a number of disadvantages in that it's.
00:13:46.980 - 00:14:26.844, Speaker C: It means you can't use the card in certain circumstances. For example, in a lot of cases in hotels or car rentals, you need an actual credit card. So this will be a. This is a credit card, unlike many crypto cards. And then the second thing is, most crypto cards don't actually let you use your crypto. You're really just selling your crypto to load this prepaid debit card with fiat and then use it in day to day life, which is, you know, usually there's a whole bunch of fees associated with doing that because you're having to sell your crypto, pay a bunch of fees. And it's just annoying.
00:14:26.844 - 00:15:19.630, Speaker C: I mean, it's just not a good user experience. You have to constantly kind of top up your balance and wonder what, what you, you know, whether you have enough on there and, you know, there's, you know, many crypto people are super bullish on crypto they don't want to sell their crypto. They want to. They're happy to just borrow against their crypto assets to maintain that long exposure. So those are some of the, I guess, the benefits that we're excited about. But as I said, to reiterate, the main benefit of this is you can really just live your life on chain. Once you have a card that you can use for all your expenses, you can just kind of live your life, do your stuff, you know, whatever you want to do on chain, and then spend your crypto directly without having to do the kind of the off ramp dance.
00:15:20.650 - 00:15:39.870, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. Speaking of chains, I think the follow up question, I think, is two parts, right. One is for you guys. Right. Why choose to build with scroll? Right. And I think the second part probably is for Sandy, is like, what does this mean for scroll? And, like, all of our users out there.
00:15:41.210 - 00:16:12.430, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we've been working with the scroll team for. For a while, so this was a natural kind of extension to the conversation. I think scrolls are our second highest TVL chain, which is, you know, pretty awesome. And, of course, scroll has a ton of TVL itself. I think it's, you know, it's the number one ZKD. So, yeah, so the partnership made a ton of sense. There's good philosophical alignment there.
00:16:13.210 - 00:16:13.538, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:16:13.554 - 00:16:16.750, Speaker C: It just honestly made a lot of sense to work on this together.
00:16:17.850 - 00:16:55.390, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think we're really excited to work with this kind of stuff. We'll work with the cash product. And first of all, I think Etherfy's growth on scroll has been phenomenal, super, super fast. I don't think we were one of the earliest integrations, but the speed of which the asset has grown has just been absolutely incredible. You can tell that most of the Etherfi holders on scroll are incredibly degen by where they're going on the ecosystem. I don't think we've given a ton of guidance in terms of where we want the asset to go.
00:16:55.390 - 00:18:12.798, Speaker B: So a lot of that have been organic. And I think there is a growing group of people, kind of community, who are living more and more of their lives on chain and whose behavior is very incentive driven. And so when we launch a product like this that has very clear incentive alignment with the user. And so the hope and the goal is that these users would hopefully be drawn to this kind of product. What is really exciting from our perspective is that with end user facing products like this, we can experiment with a number of potential product market fits for a ZK chain. So, first of all, I think the fact that we're super kind of like probably the most kind of not probably, but the most compatible, the most EVM compatible ZK roll up means the AavE and lending markets on scroll have grown exponentially. I think we're also the largest, if not the second largest or the largest ave market of any l two s as well, having a relatively modest kind of overall TvL size compared to some of the bigger l two s.
00:18:12.798 - 00:18:56.378, Speaker B: This level of defi efficiency, I think, is something that we're super happy about. And so that leads to a ton of people living a very degen and Defi oriented on chain life on scroll. And those are living and breathing human beings who have off ran needs. And so this cash product is a very natural extension to kind of the profile of someone who is constantly balancing their books on chain. And the second thing, the second product that we're hoping to kind of work more closely with the cash product with is our canvas product. So canvas is meant to be. It's launched as an on chain reputation to tracker.
00:18:56.378 - 00:19:48.480, Speaker B: So the idea, and this is a feature that we've built with the Ethereum attestation services, the idea that your on chain footprint from the past kind of, you know, 810 years of Ethereum mainnet footprint should be transferred to your l two footprint and your l two on chain journey so that we have a bunch of people, a bunch of wallets on scroll. Where the wallets come from. 2015, 2016. So one interesting fact, which I don't think I've shared before is that on scroll we have kind of 50 wallets from 2015 and 2016. So those are back then, I don't think many people were super active on chain, on Ethereum. That was the pre Ico boom. So there's a lot of kind of ogs on chain.
00:19:48.480 - 00:20:25.072, Speaker B: And so what does that mean in terms of like differentiation? And, you know, we would love to see new products taking advantage of these reputation tools to give targeted marketing. So for example, if the cash product wants to launch, say like a party in Singapore that involves a pool and a lot of lambos, then, you know, there's a method to leverage these, these things. Yeah, there's a method to leverage these like on chain reputation tools to see like, okay, who typically goes to these parties? And I. How many, like how many eth they have? And you know, I think there's a lot of different ways you could like.
00:20:25.176 - 00:20:29.368, Speaker D: Play this win Lambo. Yeah, that's all you want is lambos.
00:20:29.424 - 00:20:33.540, Speaker B: You know, I think, yes.
00:20:34.120 - 00:21:26.160, Speaker D: The other thing on that, Sandy kind of mentioned it, but so, you know, the l two thing has been an interesting experiment for us and like where people have gone and scrolls, actually our second largest l two behind arbidrum as far as like TVL goes. Yeah. So it's been kind of, you know, there's been several integrations that, you know, have kind of gone through a variety of different things and steps with to get integrations out and whatnot. And so we're super excited about cash product and where that is. And I think that the other thing, like just about products, people often don't know, like the product that they want and so you just kind of got to build the product for them. And so, you know, cash just kind of seems like this natural extension and people we talk to like, you know, Sandy mentioned it but, like people don't realize the pain point that there is there and they're like, oh, my gosh. Yeah, this is exactly what I'm looking for.
00:21:26.160 - 00:21:30.520, Speaker D: Like, payments have tried to be answered before, just not in a good way. So.
00:21:32.380 - 00:21:33.092, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:33.236 - 00:21:48.810, Speaker B: And I think this is a natural leeway to lead to, like on chain insurance, on chain like mortgages and more complex financial products. But this is a fantastic first step and that that's to do with kind of restructuring and rebuilding our financial system.
00:21:50.270 - 00:22:07.560, Speaker A: Yeah, so I mean, like, there's a lot of exciting news. I kind of want to just, you know, ask what's the reception been like? What's it been like on the ether? Five teams. Are things crazy or like, I know launches are always super huge. Right. Has calm happened or it's just, you know.
00:22:10.380 - 00:22:55.770, Speaker C: Super positive. Yeah, we're getting tons and tons of notes. I think people are generally pretty aware of, you know, this product and it being out there. You know, I think really what will really be exciting to see is when there's real user adoption. Right. Right now we're kind of testing the product internally and over the next few weeks we're hoping to roll it out to the first few hundred real users that have signed up and then we'll slowly expand that kind of circle of offerings so that more people can get their hands on it and start using it.
00:22:57.070 - 00:23:03.920, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So I do have a question about logistics. I mean, I'm in the US so I guess I'm not eligible but it's in preorder phase right now.
00:23:04.700 - 00:23:05.628, Speaker C: That's right. Yeah.
00:23:05.724 - 00:23:18.600, Speaker A: Right, right. I'm also curious from like a business point of view I'm sure you're getting a ton of orders coming in. You want to launch those slowly like what's the plan for the upcoming few quarters?
00:23:21.460 - 00:24:12.414, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the first and most important piece is just making sure the product works well and is super polished. It, I mean, it's a very, it's a complicated product. There's a lot of moving parts. You know, there's mobile apps, there's, you know, the web app, there's, you know, signing up for the card Kyc shipping. I mean, there's just, there's a ton of stuff that's, that's involved. So, yeah. Step one, get it in the hands of a few hundred kind of die hard users who have pre ordered and hopefully over a period of a couple of weeks, maybe a month, the product gets polished and we stop getting issues that we need to resolve and we feel it's ready for primetime.
00:24:12.414 - 00:24:36.680, Speaker C: And then we'll start opening it up more and more broadly. And then, of course, there's also specific kind of geographies that we want to roll this out in. We want to make sure that we're compliant and we're only offering this in geographies that we can support. But over time, obviously, we want to expand that to include more and more countries.
00:24:38.860 - 00:24:39.244, Speaker B: Cool.
00:24:39.292 - 00:24:51.850, Speaker A: And then I guess maybe, final question back to you, Sandy, just like maybe taking big picture, what's next for scroll in terms of the Defi landscape.
00:24:53.870 - 00:26:08.802, Speaker B: So I think the DeFi, fundamentally, it's about getting access to more and more stacked yield. And so we'll be continuously keeping an eye on interesting products and innovative products and making sure that we're the preferred destination for them to launch. So we want to be the place where innovative products can find a home and can find a wedge and participate in this new on chain economy. The second part of the big picture of where we're going, we want to also slowly focus a little bit more on onboarding net new users. So one of the key insights from the last couple of months of running on chain incentives is that we think there's a, the number of savvy on chain like smart capital in terms of individuals we think is pretty limited. It's maybe like around half a million at best. And they're super smart and super good at calculating and good at managing personal assets on chain, so on and so forth.
00:26:08.802 - 00:27:30.506, Speaker B: Or they're kind of somewhat professional players. I think there is at least like a ten x, if not 100 x volume of professionals who have jobs not fully on chain, but who are curious and who would like to have access to more of these kind of opportunities. And so part of our mission for the next phase of scrolls growth is to target those users and making sure that the DeFi primitives that we built can be fully leveraged. The profile would be someone who's a lawyer or someone who's an investment banker, but in their spare time, they would like to dabble on chain. I think in terms of user experience, we're almost ready for that kind of onboarding. So whenever I spend time in our community, we have Uber drivers, we have people who are teachers who spends their spare time and whatever money they've saved on chain and playing around hoping for an outsized return because the existing financial services anywhere around the world cannot cater for your average kind of your average Uber driver or Tripoli's kind of cash attendant. And they deserve the same level of kind of access as anybody else.
00:27:30.506 - 00:27:53.680, Speaker B: And so we're. But in terms of kind of the end user onboarding and off ramping experience, I think we're not quite there yet. So any kind of attempt that tries to kind of make this onboarding and offboarding process smoother, kind of like Etherfy cache, we're super keen to support and explore.
00:27:55.300 - 00:28:11.164, Speaker A: Awesome. Cool. So I want to close us off with a few call to actions, I guess. Mike and rock, I'll hand it off to you. Anything I missed, you want to talk about, I guess, what you want to encourage?
00:28:11.252 - 00:29:23.430, Speaker C: I. Yeah, I mean, I guess. I mean, take a look at the site, go to ether phi, and, you know, pre order the card if you're able. So that's probably the easiest call to action if it's something that you think you want to try out and. Yeah, I mean, the last thing I'll say is, I mean, I think this is super important and exciting because with the expectation this is going to be really successful and we'll have millions of customers using this, it will be one of the major, if not the major, tie in of Defi to the real world economy. So, in other words, crypto won't be this kind of insane, kind of up, down, boom, bust cycle that just basically depends on, you know, speculative mania. Instead, it'll be based on people's actual economic activity and real value creation insofar as making payments and, you know, typical financial activities the users engage in easier.
00:29:23.430 - 00:30:12.850, Speaker C: So I think that's great. And I, you know, from the standpoint of scroll, I think it'll position scroll in, you know, in a really great, great place relative to, you know, to other l two s. Because, you know, if the market kind of tanks, I mean, it won't. As I said, it won't be this this up down cycle because people still need to buy stuff, people need to buy groceries, people need to pay rent, people need to live their lives. So even if the crypto market goes up or down, there'll be like the steady level of activity which I think comes from productive assets. So that ultimately is what I think Defi needs in order to make it more sustainable and tied to reality.
00:30:14.350 - 00:30:23.410, Speaker A: Awesome. Cool. Sandy I guess cap us off bringing us, keeping us in reality. Any call to actions for scroll?
00:30:24.750 - 00:31:00.198, Speaker B: Yeah, I think check out our defi ecosystem. We also have a bunch of super fun games coming and some of them are launched on CKwasm ZKL3s, creating a very very competitive on chain gaming experience. And then also obviously go to Etherfi cash and sign up for a card. Would love to see how many kind of yield and points one can stack while still, you know, swiping their favorite grocery or whiskey or whatever it takes.
00:31:00.214 - 00:31:02.430, Speaker A: For fancy or Lambo.
00:31:02.590 - 00:31:03.690, Speaker B: Or Lambo.
00:31:06.110 - 00:31:27.860, Speaker A: Okay cool. So I'm going to close us off with a comment from our audience. Etherfi has been at the top of the game since day one. Glad they are partnering with scroll. This is another project that is really promising. Thank you everyone for joining. I guess those of you who are up really early, go back, take a nap, wake up and ship.
00:31:29.400 - 00:31:29.912, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:31:29.936 - 00:31:30.040, Speaker A: Emily.
