00:00:10.960 - 00:01:25.435, Speaker A: GM everyone, I'll just give it about 30 more seconds in case anyone else joins the stream a little bit late and then we'll get started. Alrighty, let's get going. So, GM everyone, thanks for tuning in with us today. My name is Liam and I'm joining you as the host from Scroll. For anyone who doesn't know, I work on the communications team mostly in the realm of social media and content and community building. So you might see me on Twitter or like hanging out in the discord from time to time. But yeah, we are indeed very much excited to welcome you back to another Community Spotlight party.
00:01:25.435 - 00:01:53.735, Speaker A: This time we'll be joined by four different projects from the scroll ecosystem. So we'll be joined by Kelp Dao, Zappa, Matcha and Hipposwap. So yeah, it's going to be really good for you guys to kind of listen in and get to know these projects a little bit better. So before we kick off with today's agenda, we'll just start with a quick round of intros so that you can get to know our speakers. So we'll start off by. I'll pass over to the Kelp Dao team to give a short introduction.
00:01:55.275 - 00:02:17.565, Speaker B: Sure. Hello everyone. So my name is Gun Multichain and I'm the head of community and governance at Kelp Dao, which is one of the largest risk taking projects not only on Ethereum Mainnet but also across all the L2s. And I'll be very happy to show you what we have built, what our journey has been and what are we doing for the next couple of quarters. Over to the next one.
00:02:24.665 - 00:02:30.805, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. Thank you very much for that intro. Yes. So we'll pass over to the Zapper team now.
00:02:31.945 - 00:02:57.717, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks Liam. So Freddie here, product operations at Zapper, joined the team about six months ago. So quickly, Zapper on Chain Explorer. So super excited to be here with you guys today to share a bit more about Zapper, what we've shipped recently and kind of our vision for the short and longer term. So thanks for the invite to the scroll team and I'll talk to everyone in a couple of minutes.
00:02:57.861 - 00:02:58.545, Speaker D: Thanks.
00:03:00.725 - 00:03:07.185, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Freddy. Yeah, so we'll pass over to Matcha now.
00:03:07.765 - 00:03:40.143, Speaker D: Hello, I'm Anthony, I'm the content manager at Matcha. I've been here over a year and yeah, Matcha itself is a Dex aggregator. So we bring together all the liquidity from various AMMs and private market makers and basically find you the best route that will give you the Best prices on chain. Yeah, we have over 130 DEXs at the moment integrated. And scroll is our latest chain that we support. So we have seven EVM chains plus now scroll as well. Thanks.
00:03:40.199 - 00:03:48.115, Speaker A: Amazing. Amazing. Well, thank you for. Thank you for supporting us. We really appreciate it. But yeah, finally we also have.
00:03:50.455 - 00:04:23.445, Speaker E: Hello everyone. Thanks for having me today. I'm Rio and it's very nice to meet you guys. And my background is marketing. I came to crypto in 2017 as a retail investor and I realized that this is a potential market with a lot of opportunities in the future. Then I went full time with it and founded a marketing agency working with leading ecosystems such as Avalanche, near Arbitrum, Base Sui and Scroll. And we usually choose blockchains with the potential for development and Sucrose is one of them.
00:04:23.445 - 00:04:57.105, Speaker E: And our strengths are growth and communication strategy. So we make more growth opportunity session to build a project on Sucrose. So we established Hipposwap and with four years of experience and supporting over 1,000 projects, I believe we can do something groundbreaking here. Yeah. And we have been on Sucrose since the beginning and we are celebrating our one year anniversary in the ecosystem and we are very proud and happy and I want to spread positivity to all of you.
00:05:02.225 - 00:05:36.565, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you so much, Rio and thank you, thank you to all of you for joining us here today. We very, very much appreciate it. But yeah, I guess let's move on to today's agenda. So as for the structure of today's call, this Spotlight party will run slightly different from our deep dives that we hold on Tuesdays. For today, each project will have up to 15 minutes to kind of take the stage and give a presentation or video, or a video presentation on their project. Or this can even be like an in depth overview or something like that.
00:05:36.565 - 00:06:09.765, Speaker A: Yeah. And we'll leave these presentations entirely up to our speakers so they have a chance to show you guys why you should be checking them out. So yeah, and you can play this back as well so you might learn how to do something that you didn't already know how to do and you can just play back the recording and go from there. But yes, with my introductions out of the way, I'm going to go ahead and hand the mic off to our first project for today. So without further ado, let's start with Kelp Dao.
00:06:11.985 - 00:06:32.937, Speaker B: Sure. Fantastic. Thank you for passing the button. I'll share my screen a little bit so everything makes sense of what I'm sharing. So I'm just going to wait A little bit since the screen is up. Fantastic. So today I'm going to talk about Kelp.
00:06:32.937 - 00:07:38.049, Speaker B: So Kelp Dao is one of the largest liquid risk taking platforms in Ethereum and we currently have a current prices 570 million. This is mostly INI. This is and LSTs like effects, for example from stator or STE from Lido. You can use that to stake it again and you are going to receive a receive. So with rsith you can do very cool things. I mean you can stake receive in Ethereum Magnet, but you can stake it straight away in scroll, for example, right? And so you are going to receive the WRC directly in scroll or you can just have it in another chain and you can use the bridge to bridge it through scroll. Now the cool thing is that we are integrated in more than 60 DeFi platforms and when you come here and select scroll, then you are going to be able to see that we are integrated in pretty much the whole ecosystem, including Nuri, including Layer bank, including pencils.
00:07:38.049 - 00:08:26.173, Speaker B: So you are able to use money markets, liquidity pools and vaults however you want. What's really, really cool and I wanted to bring it to your attention is that you can also take the RS ETH and you can use our latest product which is Gain. So in gain, I'm going to show it here. In gain, you are able to farm six different airdrops just by depositing your WRC straight into the vault. And you can stick it in scroll or in Ethereum, for example. Now the cool thing is that when you deposit your money here, it's like an automated manager for you. You don't need to keep pace of all the airdrops and everything that's happening on Defi.
00:08:26.173 - 00:09:35.107, Speaker B: We do it for you. So you are going to be farming scroll marks. You are going to be farming also five different airdrops which are linear, Kelp, Egan, Layer, Karak and also an infrastructure partner called August. The really, really, really cool thing is that if you have this WRCS in scroll, you are also gaining extra scroll marks for the fact of having your TVL into scroll. So I would come here, I would deposit whatever RSCs have and I would receive Ag Eth. So with this Ag Eth I can also go, as I said before, you can go to Nuri Exchange, you can go to Layer bank, you can go to Pencils and you can put it there and accrue even more scroll marks, right? So you are getting the six airdrops, you are also getting a native yield of around 4% and you are Also qualifying for all the layer points for all the Eagle layer airdrops that are associated to it.
00:09:35.211 - 00:09:35.855, Speaker D: Right.
00:09:36.195 - 00:10:12.265, Speaker B: So what I'm going to do in the chat, I'm just going to drop the link for this, the link for this game Vault which is like an automated airdrop hunter, airdrop farmer for you guys. Right? Oh, I see. I cannot send links in the chat. Well, that's okay. Anyways you can, you can see it here is make sure you are going to the right website is kelp dao.xyz. now I'm going to stop it here and check in the chat if you guys have some questions. Okay.
00:10:12.265 - 00:10:44.939, Speaker B: I'm just checking. Sure. So I've seen one question which is regarding the Kelp airdrop. So Kelp is having three main projects, three main products that accrue revenue to the project. Right. Now two of them are live which is as I said, the restaking into a receipt. The gainvault.
00:10:44.939 - 00:11:24.197, Speaker B: Right, the Gainvault and the third and last project that we are launching. I'm just going to show you so you can see it. It's a BNB risk taking platform, sort of like Egan layer of bnb. So Binance Labs and BNB Chain are very involved into this project. Now I will not talk much about it because this is outside of the whole Ethereum and Scroll ecosystem. But what's important is that for our Kelp tokens you are going to be accruing revenue from those three projects. Meaning the restaking, the game Vault and the kernel BNB risk taking project.
00:11:24.197 - 00:12:07.291, Speaker B: Right. So until the BNB risk taking project doesn't go live end of this month we will not be giving more information about the Kelp tokenomics. I mean about the kelp TG date, but I can assure you it's happening within Q4 of this year. So that's a little bit the presentation I had. Let me check again if there is any questions before passing the button to my colleagues. I'm just checking Scroll. Okay, so I don't see any questions.
00:12:07.291 - 00:12:10.575, Speaker B: I propose I hand over the button to the next speaker.
00:12:29.885 - 00:12:41.075, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. Thank you very much for that. I hope everyone took a lot from that and learned something new. Now let's pass on to Team Zappa.
00:12:44.695 - 00:13:37.903, Speaker C: Beautiful. Thanks for the opportunity to chat with everyone. I'll also do a quick demo of Zapper, highlight what we've built and what's available for everyone in the scroll community to to have fun and to play play around with. But for those who really have never heard of Zapper before, Zapper definitely Like a AOG project in this space. Zapper has been live for over four years now and a lot of people kind of know us for the that portfolio slash wallet tracker, Defi dashboard, a multi tool where you can just like look up any, any app and things like that. But we're also more than that. We're a non chain explorer where you can just see what's happening on Chain.
00:13:37.903 - 00:14:30.111, Speaker C: And we actually kind of revamped very recently our homepage on Zapper. So yeah, we really want to make Exploring on Chain fun, easy and super interesting. We've been working right now on kind of personalizing the trend page to highlight some possible apps, tokens, NFT collection really curated for you based on your own kind of on chain experience. So Zapper is just mentioned quickly available on web but also on mobile. We have very great mobile apps as well. If you're ON Android or iOS, you can get the Zapper app and just like explore on Chain, even on your phone. So let me just share my screen really quickly and I'll be able to kind of show what I've been talking about.
00:14:30.111 - 00:15:12.515, Speaker C: So let's go ahead. So let's try this. So yes, hopefully you can see my screen nicely. So this is the Zapper kind of homepage, the on Chain explorer where you can see what really what's been trending lately on Chain. We now cover over 19 chains with more lined up. We've recently supported scroll, which we're super excited about, but we want this to be as agnostic as possible so you can really see what's happening on Chain across all the ecosystems. But if you're a big, a big fan of a specific chain, of course you can go and select a specific one.
00:15:12.515 - 00:15:35.953, Speaker C: We have the list here on the list on the left here. Example. If I want to see what's happening on Scroll, I can do just that very easily. So that's one way to explore on Zapper. But a lot of people will also like to use our search bar at the top here. And you can see we have our friends from Kelp that just talked. I could see what's happening on Kelp.
00:15:35.953 - 00:16:26.133, Speaker C: Look up any app that I'm currently interested in and see what's happening on that specific app as well. I can see who's been which wallets have been interacted with Kelp's smart contract very recently. See that people have been staking on Kelp as well. I can scroll down, see if I maybe recognize the specific wallet and see, oh, this wallet has staked on Kelp. Let Me see what's happening with that wallet. We really want the experience to be one of discovery. We like to kind of use that rabbit hole kind of metaphor where you can just like click on one thing after the other and kind of discover a new wallet, a new app, a new token and just kind of spend hours discovering on Zapper.
00:16:26.133 - 00:17:01.167, Speaker C: So I think this is a Wal wallet. I didn't know. I see they're active across multiple chains and oh, I even see their app holding on Kelp right here in their app positions. So this is kind of the portfolio view. You can look up any wallet that you're curious about. If you want to see what Vitalik has been doing on Chain, you can look up Vitalik's wallet and yeah, you can even follow different wallets to have that that included in your own activity feed. So there's a lot of things to kind of discover.
00:17:01.167 - 00:17:52.755, Speaker C: We can do the same. We have ippo. We'll talk in a couple minutes. I can look up ippo just like typing IPPO in the search bar and see oh, who's been swapping on IPPO recently, See that it's supported on scroll and really see all the swaps that have been going on on Hippo and who has been kind of using EPO as their, as their decks for, for swaps and trades. So those that have ens, which is always fun, you can even have their their name right here like Nia Maniama here that used EPO a couple minutes ago to do a swap. Another thing at Zapper is that we really, really want to make everything that's happening on chain easy to understand. We use the term human readable for someone that's not super technical.
00:17:52.755 - 00:18:50.801, Speaker C: If to understand what happened in a transaction and you open up scroll scan either scan any like type of on chain Explorer, you'll probably be more kind of confused and you understand the transaction with all those logs and methods and things like that. So we really want to make it easy to understand what's happening on chain. And if you look at the activity feed here of this user, you can see this user swapped USDC usdt Sorry for eth. You can see that this user approved USDT for this transaction. So those transactions are really made human readable so that anyone that connects to Zapper lookups their wallet, they can understand what's happening on Chain. That is a big effort making these transactions human readable. And that's something that anyone can participate in if you want to make the chain readable.
00:18:50.801 - 00:19:37.135, Speaker C: And for everyone that's something that Everyone can participate in by curating. We call it's interpreting unchained transaction. Unchained transactions. Sorry, losing my english. So you can go just to our current tab and you can interpret transactions, but you also interpret positions to make sure that those defi positions surface in your portfolio, but also in the portfolio of thousands and thousands of other wallets as well. So that's something that's super fun to participate in. We even have a leaderboard with our top contributors that I've curated a lot of events and positions for Zapper.
00:19:37.135 - 00:20:21.885, Speaker C: So something that we can also keep track of very, very, very easily. So the search bar is something super fun. So let's go a bit more into that exploration concept. You can see that it keeps a history of your recent searches, but you can really start looking around for anything. So earlier I did kelp, I did epo. So let's do Matcha and now we can see that Matcha seems to have a NFT collection as well on chain that you can discover thanks to the search bar. So with the search bar you can find wallets and ENS names, you can find applications, NFT collections, you can find tokens as well.
00:20:21.885 - 00:20:45.043, Speaker C: We have some a very nice and detailed token page. So let's say, let's try one very easy. Let's go with ETH for today. Let's keep it simple. I can google ETH and see kind of the price history. We know Sally ETH is a bit down lately. You can see Ethan the price history over the last day.
00:20:45.043 - 00:21:18.333, Speaker C: You can go to the full year. So there's a ton of information. We try and surface as much as possible information for you to know. I can even see like who among the people I follow that have ETH in their wallet. I can even see the recent transaction with eth. So really surfacing as much information as possible. Once again, Zapper, with the 19 chains that we currently support, we now track over 2.5
00:21:18.333 - 00:22:11.245, Speaker C: million tokens, which is quite a lot across all chains. So 2.5 million tokens that you can search and if you have them in your wallet that you can have easily accessible and that you can search up as well. So those are really a few different interesting features of Zapper. We're building even more. As I mentioned, we want our on chain explorer here to even showcase the popular apps. So if there's a increase of activity of volume of transactions on ipo, Matcha, Kelp, for example, we want to showcase that something that we're going to ship very soon to show like what are the trending apps on each chain and overall across the the blockchain as well.
00:22:11.245 - 00:22:57.497, Speaker C: So that's something that's coming up very soon. So you'll be able to, yes, look up popular tokens across different chains, different NFT collections as well, across different chains, but also the apps. We know that it's something that people are curious a lot about, that people want to discover as well. There's so many new projects, so many interesting projects in space and it's hard to to discover them without having having it shilled by by someone on Twitter or something like that. So we feel that having that very agnostic, just information based discovery is super important to have as well. So yeah, it's something that is coming up very soon with Zapper and Kelp. Mention it.
00:22:57.497 - 00:23:29.815, Speaker C: So I'll do it my myself as well. Well so I know people want TG. So Zapper protocol will launch a token in Q4 as well. So something super exciting coming up. But for now I invite you really to just go on Zapper xyz, start searching, start, start exploring what's happening on Chain. You'll see it's super exciting to do. Our feed here is live, so it updates itself so there's new NFT collections popping up, new tokens popping up all the time.
00:23:29.815 - 00:24:08.225, Speaker C: So it's really fun to kind of always be on the pulse of what's happening on Chain to have kind of your own feed of new information to track. So yeah, I don't want to take too much time. I don't know if there's any questions in chat about what you can do on Zapper or maybe just to finish. You can also swap in Bridge directly on Zapper. It's a feature that we have here at the top. So across all the chains that we support, you can swap, you can Bridge as well. So something super convenient if you want to use Zapper as your home base for that.
00:24:08.225 - 00:24:19.505, Speaker C: I'll stop here for now. If there's questions, I'll be happy to go into more details, but I'll let the others talk as well about their cool projects. Thanks.
00:24:25.135 - 00:24:53.383, Speaker A: Awesome. Awesome. I don't see any new questions here, but we will leave some more time for questions at the end as well. So there's definitely some more time for that if people would like to ask a little bit later. Thank you very much for that, Freddie. I know I for one have been using Zappa since Probably, I think 2021 and it's crazy you guys have added so many new features since then. So very, very cool to see an update there, but yes, nevertheless, we will jump on to our next project.
00:24:53.383 - 00:24:58.595, Speaker A: So I will leave the stage and let Matcha take it away from here.
00:25:00.295 - 00:25:44.153, Speaker D: Hello everyone, I'm Anthony from Matcha. As I introduced myself earlier, I'm going to share again the website, so you should be able to see in second. Matcha is a dex aggregator. We're built by 0x and 0x already is implemented in things like Metamask, Coinbase and a bunch of other wallets who use them for their swaps. But Match is basically the pure stack, the full stack of 0x APIs built into this trading interface. So as you can see on the website, best prices on over 5 million tokens. And that's not just like a marketing phrase saying that the best prices are actually the best prices.
00:25:44.153 - 00:26:31.355, Speaker D: And this is actually 7 million tokens. Now, just because we tend to index pretty much any token that comes on chain and has liquidity for it. So if you create a pool on Uniswap within about five minutes, you'll find that token is on Matcha as well. So just to kind of give you an overview of the homepage, this is what you encounter when you go to Matcha xyz and you can of course start trading. We have a search bar up here and you'll get an overview of kind of what's happening on the various networks. So these are the most popular tokens, as in the most traded tokens, highest volume. You also have this trending token section where you can basically look at what's new today.
00:26:31.355 - 00:27:20.421, Speaker D: So there's RSE for Kelp and every recent trade that goes through a few seconds ago, you can kind of look at them. And actually if you click on these, it'll take you directly to that trade if you wanted to reproduce it with your own, say, your own inputs. So this is my part of town, this is my blog, and yeah, just some information about it. Again, match up by 0x. So just to give you, give you a feel for what happens when you, when you make a swap and kind of how we could see the best price, I go and connect my Xerion wallet and here just go straight into searching for a token. And you can do it in two ways. You can search for the name or you can search for the contract address.
00:27:20.421 - 00:28:01.425, Speaker D: So I could for example, do RSE spell it correctly. And here you'll find everything across the different chains. One thing to note is like anyone can name their token RSE and therefore you will literally see thousands of tokens for some of these results. But will always surface the most popular, most used ones as kind of a way to filter out those results. So I'll just jump straight into it and go to rse the page. And here, this is the trading page. For some reason we've got some funny figures here for the market cap and volume.
00:28:01.425 - 00:28:39.411, Speaker D: But scroll has just launched last week on, on Matcha and a couple of weeks before that on 0x. And at the moment we're, we're adding new chains a bit more frequently so there will be others to. To come after. At the moment we are on Ethereum, Polygon and so on. So here I've got, I've got the option to buy RS eth. I can of course switch it and I just choose a token I want to pay with. And I've got Ethereum lined up for this demo so I can do like a 50% max where I can just type in exactly how much I want to sell.
00:28:39.411 - 00:29:04.141, Speaker D: So say I wanted to do 10 bucks of RSETH. It's pretty high at high price impact. That might just be because of the, the gas and gas costs associated with it. See what happens when I do massive. So this seems to have funny liquidity with it. I looked at it a minute ago and it was 0.1 impact.
00:29:04.141 - 00:29:36.851, Speaker D: So let's just see what's happening there. I'll go to Smart Contracts just to make sure I've got the right token and let's try WRC, see if that's any better. So I can also search by token contract address and get the exact token that I'm hoping to trade. Let's see what happens when I do say $20 of this. Yeah, that looks a bit more realistic. So maybe there was something funny happening with the liquidity. Maybe there's a sampling error at the time.
00:29:36.851 - 00:30:04.069, Speaker D: But basically what it's doing is finding a route and here it's chosen Zebra as its as the decks they will use to fulfill this trade. And all of your, all of your trade is going through Zebra. So fine, I think if we increase this to say 100 ETH. You see that? There we go, 0.08 in price impact. And this is with a 0% fee. So we're not actually taking any fee on this.
00:30:04.069 - 00:30:30.003, Speaker D: We have monetized flows as well, but actual swaps are completely free. So that's a $230,000 trade for 0.08% price impact. And the way it achieves that is by splitting your trade into. Into these three between three different market makers here. That can actually be much more sophisticated I'll just bring it up so you can see it a bit more clearly. There's 2.5%
00:30:30.003 - 00:30:57.612, Speaker D: going through sync swap, 27 and 70%. And when it splits your trade like that, it's making sure that you're not kind of draining all of the available liquidity that's within a certain pool. So let's just see if we can push the boundaries a little bit more. 0.3% could be better, but that's pretty great. You're swapping $2.35 million for $2.34
00:30:57.612 - 00:31:39.747, Speaker D: million and still it's breaking it up in that same way. There are hundreds of ways to show this. I'll just jump in here and show what's available. This is the liquidity sources, the visual book here. The liquidity sources on Scroll. So far now that we've recently upgraded to a new pricing engine, a new swap engine, this will be much easier to add more and more liquidity sources as soon as they come online, as soon as we deem that they're actually really going to be beneficial for users prices. So there's 12 liquidity sources here on Scroll.
00:31:39.747 - 00:32:39.455, Speaker D: There's a little bit more I think on something like Ethereum. So sorry to hijack this. Yeah, there's another like 70 on Ethereum. And just to demonstrate kind of the power of our new routing engine, our new pricing engine, say if I do again $2 million swap, this is what it could look like. So when we have more available liquidity sources, we can do like interstitial jumps between tokens. So this is going through rfq which is actually private market makers and they're giving a quote for Rept Ethereum into USDT and then that USDT is being swapped for usdc but also going through DODO directly to wrap Bitcoin. So the way it splits up your trade here is into what like 10ish different routes and really packaging it to be as efficient as possible.
00:32:39.455 - 00:33:14.689, Speaker D: And that's why we do have the best price. I think it's 90, 93% of the time we'll win against 1 inch and 95% of the time we'll win against Uniswap. On any given trade above say a few thousand dollars. When it gets below that few thousand dollars, it's kind of free for all because of the implications of gas and having a smaller trade, gas plays a lot more of a role in the price that you get. So still 0% fee, 2.36 million, 2.35 million.
00:33:14.689 - 00:34:19.105, Speaker D: I think if you went to six decimal places, you'd see what's like a few hundred dollars spent for a million dollar trade. So that's really the power of Matcha. Let's just go back to scroll because this is the community goal and if I want to do a swap just to demonstrate, so I'll go back to RSE, I can do say, yeah, okay, $40 and it's going to choose zebra and I can review the order. Now the quote refreshes every 30 seconds once you've logged it in, which also means when you've got that big complex route, that big complex route is refreshing and finding new ways to save you more money. So I place an order now you can't see my wallet in the screen, I don't think, but I'll Click confirm and 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. And it will show me that transaction completed. And this is the exact amount that's landing in your wallet.
00:34:19.105 - 00:34:44.700, Speaker D: So that's done. One nice thing about our scroll integration is that we've actually set up a badge for this. And with each swap that you do on Matcha, this should say one, you'll be closer to getting your badge. So within four trades you'll be able to claim your badge. It will say claim here and then it will show up in your, in your scroll canvas. So we've made this trade. That was 0.168.
00:34:44.700 - 00:35:17.969, Speaker D: I'll just go and double check. 0.168 that was. Yeah, so what you were shown here as a quote of what you will get. It's not like other platforms where they say, oh, this is probably the best price that you're going to get, but they don't factor in slippage and gas costs and other like unknowns that could happen on the way. We actually sample and simulate in a way that will show you exactly the amount that will land in your wallet. So that's one of these things where we're kind of shooting ourselves in the foot because we're being over transparent.
00:35:17.969 - 00:36:06.029, Speaker D: And on meta aggregators you'll see that they are showing you a quote that will beat crx, but if you actually execute that quote, you'll end up with a worse price. So that's something to bear in mind. Maybe I'm being over shilly here, but the thing is that we know how much is going to land in your wallet because we know the state of the blockchain. We're sampling things before things, we're simulating things before you actually execute the trade. And we know how it's going to end up. So you get what we tell you you'll get. Now I have some rep stake eth, some kelpie and yeah, that's, that's, that's a majority of it.
00:36:06.029 - 00:36:33.245, Speaker D: I believe I can go and look in my trade history now and you'll see see what happened there. So earlier today I did a little bit of a bridge to make sure I had enough eth and then I also got my WRS eth in my wallet. So all the details of it are here. I can go look it up on scroll scan and it will show me how it was executed as well.
00:36:33.665 - 00:36:34.405, Speaker A: So.
00:36:36.705 - 00:37:58.785, Speaker D: Yeah, I should also mention that the execute take a few steps back and. Sorry, the reason that we've now got the best prices and before we had great prices is because we've launched this new Zero X V2 API which you'll actually see showing up in other apps like Xerion, Messmask and so on where they've integrated 0x for their swaps. But we were just the first to have it to show it off to the world. And here's some information about the wind percentage, but it's all about this routing. So because we're able to sample all the liquidity sources at once and know how much price impact is going to be given, that's the upgrade between 0xv1 and 0xv2. Is this interstitial tokens? Also the fact that we've combined the private liquidity with automated market makers so we can use both of them in a route and. Yeah, and then what we had previously, which was splitting your trade up into multiple routes.
00:37:58.785 - 00:38:50.215, Speaker D: So 0xv2 is also used as permit 2. So you can see here in the blog section, you can read up on why that's a big thing. We're using Permit two in a way that's you're only allowed. Well, you're only approving a one time allowance, whereas other versions of Permit 2 still have this kind of unlimited or not limited timeframe in which your balance can be spent. Whereas after you're done with one swap on Matcha, you then have to approve it again and it's a couple of clicks or one click. But this way you're protected against things like wallet allowance exploits. So yeah, that's the overview of Matcha.
00:38:50.215 - 00:39:26.253, Speaker D: If you want to kind of keep up with us, you can go and find our newsletter, which is on our website and on our blog and you can also follow us on Twitter, LinkedIn, Warpcast.

00:39:26.253 - 00:39:33.745, Speaker D: I haven't really recovered from Singapore two weeks ago. So thanks for bearing with me.
00:39:42.505 - 00:40:09.785, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you very much. Yeah, I mean, hopefully your throat clears up in time for devcon or you can go and, you know, hopefully not get sick again.
