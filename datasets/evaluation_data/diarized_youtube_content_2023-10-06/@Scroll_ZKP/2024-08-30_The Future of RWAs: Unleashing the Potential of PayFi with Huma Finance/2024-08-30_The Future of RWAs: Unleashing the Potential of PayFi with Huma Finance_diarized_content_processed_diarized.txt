00:00:02.000 - 00:00:05.845, Speaker A: Hi guys. Shall we start now?
00:00:08.425 - 00:00:09.793, Speaker B: We're ready to go.
00:00:09.969 - 00:00:23.433, Speaker A: Yep. All right. All right, let's do it. So. Hi guys. Welcome to the Humor cross grow our live stream sections. We're gonna, we are, we're honored to have Ali from off here and Richard from Humor here with us.
00:00:23.433 - 00:00:57.955, Speaker A: So today we're going to briefly talk about to understand both of the project a little bit more of a vision behind what's the story behind when they find off and humor and we're going to talk about what they feel about integrating on scroll and then we're going to share some of the roadmap they have. And we got Sandy, our Scroll co founders here to share a little bit more about future plans of scroll here. We are honored to have all you guys here. Gm. GM as usual. So yeah, just a quick introduction. So Richard, can you tell me a little bit more about what humor is all about?
00:00:59.615 - 00:01:34.455, Speaker B: Hi Carl, thank you so much for having me here and GM everybody to the entire inner scroll community. We are super excited to be on this call. I'm Richard Liu, co founder and co CEO of Huma Finance. Huma is an RWA platform. We help or all kinds of payment applications to tokenize their asset present on chain connect with all kinds of unchain opportunities. So we believe we focus more on payment side. So we believe PayFi is the new frontier of RWA.
00:01:36.235 - 00:01:42.975, Speaker A: Cool, thank you as usual we are honored to have you Richard. So Ali, can you tell us a little bit more about us?
00:01:44.045 - 00:02:33.685, Speaker C: Hey guys. Very happy to be here and very excited to talk with you guys. And I can talk about ARF in a way that we are you can say sit in between Top Web 3 and ThreadFi. We are a regulated financial institution in Switzerland but we work with stablecoins and we are providing settlement financing to cross border payment companies all around the world. Our clients are only regulated licensed companies and we move volumes around more than a billion now annually. And this is all on Stablecoin in total volume is now exceeding around or nearing around 2 billion.
00:02:36.505 - 00:02:45.865, Speaker A: Cool as usual. We're happy to have Sandy here. Sandy, what's the most exciting and the latest scroll news you can share with us?
00:02:46.765 - 00:03:30.753, Speaker D: Hi Richard. Hi Ali. Welcome on the scroll podcast. Great to have you guys here. Well, as everyone knows that we're in this massive build out phase of welcoming fantastic founders and builders and great assets and welcoming everyone to our ecosystem. A quick update from scroll for those that are following. We're built on Ethereum so we inherit a lot of the security and decentralization features from Ethereum and we started out to build the most EVM compatible ZK rollup with the fastest finality, the shortest finality and also the highest uptime.
00:03:30.753 - 00:04:38.695, Speaker D: So we've managed to provide 10x higher throughput and 10x cheaper fees than Ethereum with a 3 second block time. We are the largest ZK rollup by liquidity, securing over 1 billion in liquidity and also 1 billion in volume. We're the first ZK rollup to have core defi primitives deployed including AAVE compound, uniswap, et cetera. And also we're now pushing the frontier on PayFi and RWA with Huma and Arf and I can't wait to share more about what these fantastic projects will bring to the Ecosys. Another builder centric things that we've done in order to support our ecosystem is that we have the best underlying infra support including Etherscan chainlink, RPC nodes and foundry so that hopefully founders can build and deploy on scroll with very very little friction. And when we have the fastest growing developer ecosystem with about 5 million unique addresses and lots and lots of eth saved for users interacting on chain.
00:04:40.685 - 00:04:52.785, Speaker A: Thank you Sandy. So let's take a deeper dive to two of our guests here. Humor and off so what is humor and what problems is designed to solve in the global payment landscape?
00:04:53.925 - 00:05:52.385, Speaker B: Hey Carl, thank you for the question. Just like I mentioned earlier, humor is a on chain tokenization platform. We enable all kinds of payment applications to tokenize their assets on chain so that we can provide that mechanism for them to connect them with investors. And so what happens is that you know when I came from fintech background and my last company every year they probably have no origination right about 10 billion USD dollars and they highly profitable, generally tons of transaction value. But even those type of creative companies they may not be able to access, you know, credit facility. We witnessed how hard it is and we know a lot of not only fintech company but also a lot of crypto companies like arf. When we first talked to arf, we realized it was so challenging for them to access all kinds of liquidity.
00:05:52.385 - 00:06:48.557, Speaker B: That's why we build the platform to enable innovative fintech companies, crypto companies for them to be able to access liquidity. And in this process we laser focus on payments applications because what payments application really does is in my view is the number one unfair advantage for blockchain is moving money from point A to point B. That's actual business payments. A lot of payments applications doesn't require financing for them to Move money, be able to move money smoothly. For example, a credit card is probably the largest payment financing applications. You and I swap card today but we only pay back the money about 30 days ago. And then in this in between the issuer bank would pay the merchants, you know, two, three days later to set the transaction.
00:06:48.557 - 00:07:06.225, Speaker B: That's probably the largest payment finance application and it's, it's $16 trillion. So that's why we try to enable this type of applications. And Arnie will talk more about the cross border payments which is also another exciting domain.
00:07:08.445 - 00:07:23.955, Speaker A: Cool. So let's take a start back. Can you tell us a little bit more about the story of the motivation or like any inspiration behind creating humor or is there any special opportunities that you identified that led to the creation of humor?
00:07:25.135 - 00:08:23.113, Speaker B: Yeah. So this goes back to my when I work as a CTO for earning one of the largest consumer fintech companies and they provide, they enable, you know, tens of millions of people to access their future paycheck really to serve the underserved people in the United States. And that was super exciting. When you enable those people to be able to access their future payments that's basically you find a way to describe the value of the future money flow. And when I see how excited those users are, when I see because they were able to access their future paycheck, they were able to have the birthday party for their kids, able to do whatever they are able to do, that's just super exciting. But on the other side, as I mentioned earlier, I found companies like that because their business model so new, their concepts are so new. Traditional finance are not designed to support them.
00:08:23.113 - 00:08:55.275, Speaker B: So it was very, very hard for them to get a credit facility. And that company itself I mentioned, the volume is very big, more than $10 billion transaction volume and then highly profitable. But still they are not able to get facilities. They have to go to pe. Whenever you only have one or two funding sources, it becomes so, so difficult for you to get it. On the other side, I know how great the asset is. I as an individual investor I want to invest in their assets because double digit yield and return.
00:08:55.275 - 00:09:40.675, Speaker B: I know the default rate is insanely low and I want to invest but I'm not an LP for the large PE so I want to get a chance to participate. That's why inspired us to say okay for investors, they cannot access this great opportunities for company need. They don't have access to funding sources will. So that's motivated us to build humor to connect them connect this type of company and the funding Sources this one benefit of leveraging blockchain to do this is that you're now instantly you're able to access global asset, global assets for investors. You're able to access global capital for the companies as well. So that's why we are super excited to build and grow in this domain.
00:09:41.615 - 00:09:55.115, Speaker A: And we, and we are excited to have you on scroll as well. Thank you very much for your sharing, Richard. So off, can you tell us a little bit more about what is off and what problems does it decide to solve in the global payment landscape?
00:09:56.015 - 00:10:42.221, Speaker C: Of course. Is it coming from me? Hi, there's an echo. I don't know. Okay, now it's okay. So ARP is a regulated financial institution in Switzerland and we are are providing settlement liquidity or cross border payments liquidity to financial institutions only. So it's very easy to understand if you think it like Today there is $4 trillion locked at any given time in the world to make instant settlements in global payments. They look like same day, but they are not same day.
00:10:42.221 - 00:12:08.309, Speaker C: I mean in reality they are mostly all the treasury, all that money, all that capital is already moved upfront to those countries corridors, partners, whatever the payments destination is. And this $4 trillion is a huge creates a huge friction for cross border payment companies to grow. And ARP is very determined to solve that problem in not only innovative way and very cutting edge technologies, but also in a very fully compliant way. So in that sense you can imagine that even though you can have unlimited money in fiat in some country, if you want to move that money in cross border you need to move that via Swift or some other networks. However, if you have digital assets, stablecoins are the best for mostly as a payment made medium. And if you have some stablecoin treasury then it's very easy to do that independent the country you are in. So you can easily settle with your partners in cross border payments as a financial institution and you are regulated, your partner is regulated.
00:12:08.309 - 00:13:06.025, Speaker C: So you can easily settle between yourselves in stablecoins and digital assets. The idea is very simple but doing it is not really easy because of all the different regulations, regulatory frameworks in the world and different stable coins, different on off ramps. And ARF is very dedicated to solve that problem by solving the biggest problem of the cross border payments ecosystem. It's the liquidity. If you can solve the liquidity problem for financial institutions then it will step by step will improve all that. All the on off ramps, all the regulations, all the use cases will be built and everything on top of that. And the key Is for us doing it very smart and innovative and doing it fully compliant.
00:13:07.365 - 00:13:23.885, Speaker A: And yeah, you are on the road to putting that off and we are very glad to see that. So is there any special motivation that drive you to build this project? Is there any like some key issues that you would like to solve in the global payment landscape?
00:13:24.305 - 00:14:49.289, Speaker C: It's a great question, thank you for that. I mean we started as a crypto payment gateway actually in many years ago and trying to solve the problems in payment gateways, card acquirings in Fiat. And so that there is very, it's very hard to find a way or find players, early adopters, find the right regulator, right regime in regulation to bring Fiat world and also Web3 and digital assessors together. Because it only you can say it's its best shape is if you bring the best of these two worlds together. I mean they both have options and pros and cons you can say or a pleasant next. So in that sense we start the crypto payment gateway and step by step we tried a peer to peer bitcoin sending app, we tried stablecoin settlement networks and at the end of the day we solved, we understand and solve the problem of liquidity. Everything is based on liquidity and stablecoins are really meant to solve the problem, not maybe in domestic payments, not maybe in other place, other use cases.
00:14:49.289 - 00:16:08.775, Speaker C: But cross border payments are the critical and most impactful area for stablecoins and digital assets. In that sense. We were regulated two years ago in Switzerland and now we are in the process of acquiring a fintech license which is called the lightweight banking license in Switzerland. And so it will be all secure so we can provide crypto and fiat custody, crypto and fiat rails and everything to all our clients. And because also by doing that along the journey you can say today we process 1 billion, we originate 1 billion per year, but we have the demand of 1 billion per month. So we are moving to that direction to realize that in the next year. And yeah, as I said, I mean it was like a journey from, from coming from merchants solving problems for merchants, then retail and then now financial institutions and we are expanding from there.
00:16:10.195 - 00:16:31.523, Speaker A: Cool. Thank you very much for your sharing, Alec. So when it comes to global payment we always need to address one key issue which is credit risk. Right. So a very, very simple yet complicated questions book for both of you gentlemen right here. How do you manage credit risk? Maybe Richard, you can take that first.
00:16:31.699 - 00:17:06.081, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah Carl, before we jump into it, I know many of the people on the call may not be familiar why we have you know, we say Human come to scroll. Why do we have a hum scroll Human and RF on the same call. So let's make sure we have that clear. So you know Human is an rw, you know pay five protocol. That way we are bringing all kinds of applications to scroll. When ARF is a shining star on human platform. So ARF is the one they bring the real assets and Human is a platform.
00:17:06.081 - 00:17:42.188, Speaker B: So those two coming together. When you talk about created assets really ARF is the reason I say ARF is a shiny style is the kinder app. I would say anybody in RWA domain would acknowledge ARF is probably the one of the most explosive and high quality assets for two reasons. Arnie already mentioned they process $1.8 billion on chain transaction volume. That's at a very big scale. Number two, there is zero credit default Circle did a very intensive case study about ARF.
00:17:42.188 - 00:18:17.105, Speaker B: Talk about how excited how much new problem to solve for everybody and what's the gross potential. So that's really just need a foundation about why Human, why arf. Let's talk credit risk. Whenever you do this type of RWA assets the most important thing is secure make sure the principle safety. In this case ARF only lend money to licensed financial institutions. And then also in this cross border payments. Most of them is from developed countries to developing countries.
00:18:17.105 - 00:18:50.089, Speaker B: For example from Singapore to Milan to Finland, from the US to Mexico. Those are very big corridors. So in that case we only are only target on those licensed financial institutions. We only do mostly do on the sending side. That means all the all the developer countries because it's so hard to get license in those places. And it's just people take care of that. That's number one by select your right customers.
00:18:50.089 - 00:19:31.761, Speaker B: Number two, the nature of the assets because cross border statement usually is very short duration. So in ARF's case their loan duration is one to six days. So that means you have a lot of earlier read about the financial institutions health needs. And number three is just because those financial license financial institutions and the money already they have to whenever they want to do borrow money from ARF through the ARF and Human. What they have is that they have to collect the money remittance order. First they get this order. Then you use that as the collateral for them to borrow.
00:19:31.761 - 00:20:03.949, Speaker B: That means the money is already in the financial system and there is no other way. Based on S&P 500 stats in the last 20 years when money is in the financial system the default rate is 0.25%. And then in our case it's a short duration. You can imagine that default rate will be further low. That's why there is no surprise right now we have 0% credit default. It's not nearly a major surprise to us. We expect to be very very low in that way.
00:20:03.949 - 00:20:46.737, Speaker B: That's just generally about the credit business. And then later on I will ask Art for talk about their underwriting process, those type of thing. Second part is really how do you make then when you have all those investors money, how do you really separate from the operating company, Human and arf? So we set up special spv, special purpose vehicle. And all the investors money goes to that SPV and all the borrowing the borrow from that spv, all the collaterals send it to that spv. So that SPV is bankruptcy remote from what RF and Human has. So that is very very structured. The last piece is about the structure.
00:20:46.737 - 00:21:35.639, Speaker B: How do you design the structure so that you really give most of protection and you give the right protection to different people. The first one we have put 2% cash reserve so that if even if in the most extreme case, if something goes wrong, our own money just goes out to pay off whatever the bad debt is. But that cash reserve means it's never deployed, it's always there and that's from our own pocket. Then we require every pool to have at least 10% junior tranche. Then only after that you have senior tranches. So that structural finance also give investor more protection. So overall summarize is really about the type of assets, the type of banners you want to identify.
00:21:35.639 - 00:21:58.635, Speaker B: You service them short duration. And then the other one is just set up the structure in such a way that you have most protection to the investors money. Last one you have the right structure even in the worst case is our own money goes out first. With that I'm going to turn over to ani, talk about their underwriting, you know, creating rating about the different borrowers.
00:22:01.185 - 00:22:34.539, Speaker C: Thank you Richard. So I keep it very brief. We start developing our own credit risk model in house. And by doing so we know that there's this cross border payments, very old, very well known industry. But how to do this in a liquidity perspective with stable coins is very new. And this is a very new category opening up in the market. That's why we started our own risk modeling.
00:22:34.539 - 00:23:23.621, Speaker C: And we start very basic and then layer up layer by layer we edit and more and more data points and more models on top of that. But I mean you can see the analogy here. I mean cross border payments is very similar to A decentralized network. So in that sense when you. Because I mean globally, there is no governing body around how you move your money. You can have different preferences, you can work with any partner, all the partners have different ways of working and different credibility or trust or risk score in that sense. So we are starting with very simple models of underwriting.
00:23:23.621 - 00:24:21.235, Speaker C: And step by step with all the transactions and all the underwriting flowing throughout, we start building and upgrading the model to understand a network model in a way that which parties are trusting which and everything. And we are always improving that model. And underwriting is very straightforward in that sense. We require all our clients financials, audited financials and we check them quarterly and we always every day get their transactions and every day we underwrite them again and again. So ARF provides a very short term credit or settlement financing for one to five days. So we always on top of the fitness of the line. So it's not like even a three months or six months time which can consider short in Threadfi.
00:24:21.235 - 00:24:34.655, Speaker C: So it's one to five days only. We always assess the credit risk quarterly. We always assess continuously every day the drawdown request on that credit.
00:24:35.875 - 00:24:50.575, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Now so when it comes to defi protocols everybody's going to ask the same question. How do you ensure on chain security? Richard, how will Hoover ensure on chain security?
00:24:51.315 - 00:25:17.183, Speaker B: Sure, of course. Before I jump to security I want to add one more point that Arnie was mentioning is that they have all those assets this receivable supposed to be paid let's say in three days. We actually have a layer called transparency. All the receivable performance will be put on chain. We said it will be paid in six days. Days or three days. And what's the new payoff date? All those receivable assets will be on chain and totally transparent.
00:25:17.183 - 00:25:50.001, Speaker B: So that's just another layer to make sure people see the underlying assets quantity. Let's throw it back on the security side. Honestly that's probably the number one thing I told my team very often and really focus on it. So we have two things. Number one is we audit by Spirit Business is a top notch in EVM auditing firm and we already live on other EVM chain. And so it's already our contract v2 contract is live for more than half a year on other chance. So that's number one.
00:25:50.001 - 00:26:24.501, Speaker B: Number two we also have bug bounty program and also hosted by Spirit and that bug bounty program we have been there like for quite some time. We did get quite a few people to test it and give Us some small feedback but no real issue identified. So that's really from that perspective. I also want to go a little bit extra to talk about what's our design principle. Design principle. There are two fronts. We really want to make sure even if somebody point a gun should point at me steal my private key.
00:26:24.501 - 00:26:50.495, Speaker B: At the same time point a gun at my co founder Erbo who is not on the call. Basically you get the two out of three the multi sigma private case. You can only get human money from the protocol. You cannot get any users money from the protocol. That is from day one our design principle. I think that will give a lot of protection. Number one, even if people compromise with my priority, they cannot get it also.
00:26:50.495 - 00:27:14.437, Speaker B: That also implies the team cannot access investors money. We can only access the protocols money. That's just guiding principle. We build it building that way. Number two, we minimize unnecessary exposures. I love composability and I think that's really have a lot of really value. But when you don't need it, you don't really go for it.
00:27:14.437 - 00:28:03.435, Speaker B: So a lot of protocols is really looking with relay on Oracles and Oracle manipulation probably is one of the most common attack vector. And right now we don't use Oracle, we don't need to use it. And right now we minimize our interaction with other protocols. So at this moment there is basically a risk exposure layer is very minimal. So from that perspective, strong contract auditing and really minimize the power of the admin users. Business is super protocol owners minimize their power so that even if their access get compromised you can still you can only steal protocol money. Then the last one is be very careful about the interface with other places and minimize unnecessary exposures.
00:28:06.575 - 00:28:24.295, Speaker A: Cool. It's always very very glad to hear humor. Prioritize security and very very dedicated to protect users fund. So moving on to the next section. So what gets you most excited when you decide to launch your project on scroll? Like what is the highlight so far?
00:28:26.675 - 00:28:53.753, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Obviously I came from Silicon Valley and I really value about technology. I believe the future is zk. I just super excited. Then you look at all the ZK projects. You know, obviously from technical perspective finality is a key, right? Compared with optimistic roll up. Then the finality is just the keener feature then other all the, you know, ZK platform.
00:28:53.753 - 00:29:35.615, Speaker B: Which one has the most powerful, you know best performance on finality. That's the case. That's a scroll. That's why very naturally for me to first think about scroll and talk to them. Understand. Okay, what is it? What's the real thing is then in that process I learned, wow, the community spirit and also it's matched with our, for example, you guys building in, you know, Turkish community is very, very active and Ali Invalid is sitting in Istanbul and good portion of our team is based on business based in Turkey. That's very, very natural feat and we feel, I think those are the two things probably new yearly.
00:29:35.615 - 00:30:12.611, Speaker B: Those are the two things really, really excited for us to consider. And of course we have a very exciting news to announce today. So we are coming to scroll and we're going to launch a joint campaign together so that the users would be. When you participate in the pool, in human pool you not only get 10 to 20% USDC stable yield, but you also get human points. And you guys are all familiar with scroll marks and enjoy it. So that's three in one package together. So that's joint effort.
00:30:12.611 - 00:30:16.995, Speaker B: I'm just super excited and very, very excited to be here.
00:30:17.495 - 00:31:46.849, Speaker D: Thank you Richard for giving the alpha. We're super excited to have Huma and our font Scroll. I think Richard touched on the fact that we've always been very invested in building the community in Turkey. So making sure that financial access and global liquidity can be channeled to the most useful and most efficient sources of capital to improve capital efficiency in the developing world is one of our core missions for founding Scroll. So apart from building the best tech stack, we also have this social mission of bringing financial access to the rest of the world and in a way that is not western centric, in a way that is truly decentralized and truly global. And so I think when I first met Richard, this, this mission and also what he's trying to build really resonated with us and we couldn't be happier to welcome them to Scroll. In addition, I think one of the learnings from building out the scroll defi ecosystem is that there is a massive group of global asset allocators that exist within the crypto ecosystem who are very savvy, very agile and they know when a good yield opportunity exists.
00:31:46.849 - 00:32:53.117, Speaker D: And so when we discover a really high value and relatively kind of interesting and differentiated opportunities like arf, we would love to kind of present it to them in a way that resonates hopefully. And obviously at some point when humor token becomes more tokenized, then there are ways to loop it within the Defi ecosystem. For those community members who enjoys a little bit more risk, who are a little bit more risk on, there are lots of ways to yolo more into the Huma leverage. So that's Something for later. But for the time being I think what RF and Humor offers is an incredibly attractive and differentiated source of on chain yield. One thing to think about is that compared to defi yield, this is something that is not correlated and it's counter cyclical. So that whatever your allocation methodologies are on chain, this is probably something you don't have access to right now.
00:32:53.117 - 00:32:59.905, Speaker D: So obviously not financial advice. We're just sharing this really interesting opportunity.
00:33:01.965 - 00:33:14.155, Speaker A: So Chad, this is like the first offer of today, but this is not the last one of the day. So moving on to the next section. So how is the integration experience so far?
00:33:15.895 - 00:33:37.079, Speaker B: So far, yes. Scroll honest. When we deploy on scroll at that moment we saw the change. You know there were a main net last too long. We saw that there might be some hiccups. It was just so easy. I asked the team deploy on scroll then I thought okay, shall we do testing? I asked them, oh yeah, we have done all the testing.
00:33:37.079 - 00:33:42.595, Speaker B: There was no hypothetical, no nothing. Just simply. It just works. That's beautiful.
00:33:43.855 - 00:33:59.235, Speaker A: Thank you very much, Richard. So is there any like future roadmap in the Q3 and Q4 of humor that you can share with us? Is there any like a milestone or like a significant new functions new feature that you would like to share to the crowd?
00:34:00.215 - 00:34:43.983, Speaker B: Yeah, that's very exciting. Especially with the paid fine movement and a lot of. I'm a strong believer of payment financing. Web is new frontier for RWA. You think about in the last two years t bill because it generated real yield 5% thanks to the Fed's help it nearly pick a big momentum. You build the success of companies like Undo and as the Fed as interest started to decline and the company all the investors are looking for new opportunities. They're looking at the more like risk adjustment in return then from that spectrum many people because TBO open the door really paves the way for more RWA assets to be accepted by more and more people.
00:34:43.983 - 00:35:32.839, Speaker B: And we believe payment financing is a natural next phase the new frontier for rwa. And because the yield is double digit yields, that's much better than tbo. And the risk as we already mentioned is insanely low. So from a risk adjusted perspective it's nearly their best asset. We believe PayFi is a new frontier and we are going to New year to push very very aggressive educate everybody about PayFi. So we are going to we are very excited to host PayFi summit right before token 2049 together with other significant payments players like Standard Circle and Scroll will be there as well. And Solana so we really going to push the PFI narrative forward.
00:35:32.839 - 00:36:13.597, Speaker B: That's number one. Number two operationally help arf ARF is their most excited assets RW assets right now. There is no, there is no comparable really from risk perspective, from yield perspective and also from growth potential perspective. Like Arnie said, they have demand for $1 billion transaction, you know origination per month. There is so much, so much more we can do from that perspective. So we are going to work with bring more liquidity to our business. Number three is even most exciting for me is that not only grow supports these cross border payments and human payfare platform can enable a lot more applications.
00:36:13.597 - 00:37:06.997, Speaker B: We would love to bring more and more of them to SKLO as well. Let's talk about the credit card businesses and green card is already live on Kuma and they provide business credit card for Web3 organizations because those organizations don't have banking account but they want to give credit card to their members, DAO members or whatever organizational members and we enable them to do so. And also your human platform can enable trader financing. We have application coming in and we can support a lot of T +0 use cases. Quite some companies are talking to us to launch T plus zero application means you for example today focus on the call. Today you have T bill. If you do redemption you don't get on the same day, you get like three days later or two days later.
00:37:06.997 - 00:37:40.315, Speaker B: A lot of times when we redeem your T bill you probably have something planned to do no matter trading or some other things. What if you can access that capital instantly? That's called T +0. And then we actually super excited to do that because with PFI infrastructure you can do that in traditional business many people wants to do that. It's just so hard to do with blockchain with a stablecoin and pay for infrastructure you can just make it happen. So we're looking to launch more of applications in that domain.
00:37:41.375 - 00:37:56.955, Speaker A: Yeah, that would definitely unlock a lot of capital efficiency on chain. So going back to Sandy, is there any exciting things or any things that we can tease about with Skrull's latest plan on Q3 and Q4?
00:37:59.415 - 00:39:26.033, Speaker D: For us it's about kind of bringing on more exotic assets and exploring the product market fit of instant finality. So the settlement aspect of Huma and ARV is at the beginning of an early exploration about how faster settlement and instant finality can add value to a project in and of itself. So we're very keen to explore use cases like this and also expand on building out our global community and yeah, so there's lots of stuff to do and obviously we have a lot of technical updates coming up. So we are anticipating with another upgrade towards the end of the year, the gas on Chain will become comparable to the cheapest of the L2s with even within the optimistic stacks. So the cost of transaction will become negligible for everybody on chain. So that is super exciting. When we set out to build scroll we didn't anticipate this day would come for maybe five to 10 years but we managed to accelerate the build out execute and get to it within one year after mainnet and we have a bunch of kind of onboarding tools designed in the anticipation.
00:39:26.033 - 00:40:46.203, Speaker D: We're thinking we're at the precipice of mass adoption for crypto usage simply because the on chain yields are so insanely high compared to what's available off chain. So that's on the demand side. I think there will be a lot of user interest coming in. So we're building out a bunch of tools that will improve the onboarding experience that includes kind of a single wallet entry called keystore. We've announced that project in Eath Berlin a few months ago will be continued with that build out and within a year's time I'm expecting a the gas fee to become negligible and we will be gearing towards more and more gasless transactions as the ultimate challenge for improving on Chain ux. Lots and lots of exciting things to come on the infra side but most importantly for our community and we've got cool projects like Huma and ARF and can't wait to kind of build out the defi Lego on top of humor. What is really exciting is that previously on Chain Leverage facilities are already pretty mature but when you add a stable yield source that is very dynamic like this I think there could be really good kind of chemistry happening within the ecosystem.
00:40:46.203 - 00:40:49.415, Speaker D: So I am really excited to see more of that.
00:40:50.555 - 00:41:23.087, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you very much Sandy. And that will be a very very busy September for a lot of scrollers. We'll be attending KBW and Token Singapore as well. If there's any builders out there who want to meet up with a fellow scrollers, I'm pretty sure you'll run into a lot of them in different site event but if you want to have one on one with any of them feel free to share us message or leave message in any tweet. So yeah, that will wrap up the section for today. Thank you very much for coming over Richard, Ali and Sandy, thank you very much for your sharing.
00:41:23.087 - 00:41:44.633, Speaker A: So I think that will be sums up the evening. Thank you very much for the alpha reviews and the exciting roadmap sharing. I'm pretty sure like everyone will have a lot of things that a lot of a lot of the community members would like to try out. Humor and only as well enough for this amazing guild opportunity.
00:41:44.769 - 00:41:47.805, Speaker D: So we'll let Richard wrap up.
00:41:48.185 - 00:41:59.255, Speaker B: Yeah. One last one. As we speak the system is turning on so human and ARP is officially live on scroll. Check it out. Huma Finance.
00:41:59.635 - 00:42:00.495, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:42:00.995 - 00:42:02.595, Speaker C: Perfect. Thank you guys.
