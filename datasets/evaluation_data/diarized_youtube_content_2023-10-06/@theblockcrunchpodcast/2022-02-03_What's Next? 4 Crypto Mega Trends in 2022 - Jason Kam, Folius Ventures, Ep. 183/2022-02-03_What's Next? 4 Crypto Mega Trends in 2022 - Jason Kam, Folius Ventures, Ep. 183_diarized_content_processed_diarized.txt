00:00:02.120 - 00:00:08.754, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto.
00:00:16.934 - 00:00:20.914, Speaker B: This episode is also brought to you by Periswap. Stick around to learn more.
00:00:21.534 - 00:00:48.972, Speaker C: Hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockfront podcast. Now, to kick off 2022, I wanted to do an episode where we kind of think about a framework about how to think about different things within crypto and how they're going to play out. Maybe within next year, maybe beyond that. And I couldn't think of a better person to do this with than my friend Jason from foliage ventures. And he's actually been in the crypto space for quite a while, and in my opinion, very criminally underfollowed. So make sure you follow Maple Leaf Capital on Twitter.
00:00:48.972 - 00:00:50.548, Speaker C: So, Jason, welcome to the show.
00:00:50.676 - 00:00:56.384, Speaker A: Well, thank. Thank you so much for having me. Like we are talking before we got started, it's a long time coming.
00:00:56.724 - 00:01:07.772, Speaker C: Yeah. I've been wanting to bring you on for two years now. And now that you launch your own fund, maybe you can tell us a little bit about how you got into space and what is the thesis behind your fund. Foley's ventures.
00:01:07.908 - 00:02:00.344, Speaker A: Yeah, doc's bad, as I usually say. So I've been on Wall street in the past eight to nine years. I was a Carnegie Mellon grad. Back in 2012, I did investment bank, family office, and then my last job at a hedge fund, I was doing mostly emerging and frontier market small caps, where my specialty was SaaS software, or anything that touches China. Well, I'm kind of glad I left, because those two sectors, that their intersection didn't really exist anymore in 2021 for a whole host of reasons. But I fell down a rabbit hole of crypto in early 18, and I thought that, wouldn't that be a great idea to, you know, really put my thoughts out there and have people criticize it? So I started Maple leaf cat, the Twitter account. Through that, I think during that time, not a lot of people were posting long form threats or even decks about the space.
00:02:00.344 - 00:02:28.654, Speaker A: So through that, I met a lot of investors, founders, anons. Some of them became really good friends, and basically they managed to convince me, as my conviction grew, to come to the space full time. So I left that job in the hedge fund in May of this year, thanks to the support from parafy, from Dragonfly, from the guy's fat framework, and many others, I was able to launch the fund in September, and it's been in operation for a couple months.
00:02:29.234 - 00:02:47.846, Speaker C: Yeah. And what I think is really interesting is that you're one of the very few funds that kind of straddle both east and west. I know a lot of funds claim to want to do that, but you're one of the few funds that actually moved out here and spent a lot of time with Asia based founders. So can you tell us a little bit about, like, the motivation behind that and what made you decide to drop everything in New York and kind of move out here?
00:02:47.950 - 00:03:37.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought for APAC founders, especially chinese ones, my impression then, and it's even more true today, is that they can have access to three types of capital. If they are a grade a Tencent Alibaba guy, they can either try to get money from chinese species, the sequoia Chinas of the world, but those guys are. I wouldn't say they don't get it. They get it, but they move very slowly, and it's a lot harder to get them behind you when 90% of the portfolio has to touch with mainland China and deal with chinese government directly. As we all know, that's not the most friendly environment. So they tend to move very slowly or be extremely selective. The second group of capital is the sort of the lightspeed, the a 16 z, the paradox of the world.
00:03:37.234 - 00:04:48.674, Speaker A: But I think they will be here in the next one to two years, but not today, because they are really busy with their portfolios and all sorts of opportunities in the US and Europe. And the language, cultural and whole host of barriers bar them from going full force into Asia. The third group of capital they can seek is capital from the likes of, say, dragonfly and Spartan, or SNZ Seven X, where crypto native been around for a while, really gets it. But that capital force at the moment is still small, relatively speaking, and there's a large group of funds that made their money historically in the older vintages through a completely different set of feces, where I think if the founder is looking for somebody who's more thesis driven, who's more long term, who's more institutional, they used to not have a lot of good options. Increasingly, they have more and better options, such as your fund, Spartan. But I felt like there's a hole in the market, and I think raising dedicated capital to fulfill that purpose would give me an edge. And it's also providing all those founders what they need.
00:04:49.214 - 00:05:25.320, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I think back in the early days, I think a lot of the venture capital in crypto, in China specifically, were bitcoin whales, not a lot of institutional capital. So it's really interesting to see that change. And Jason before we chatted, you prepared a bunch of predictions for 2022 and beyond for crypto, which we're going to get to that in a bit. But I love to clear something up as well, because a lot of people that I talk to, and I'm sure a lot of people you talk to, too, have this impression that maybe, like China based projects are typically of a lower quality. There are a lot of scams, a lot of noise coming out from there. That's someone who's actually on the ground and who actually spends a lot of time exploring what's out there.
00:05:25.320 - 00:05:30.804, Speaker C: Can you kind of help us understand what's exactly happening in China and within the China founder community?
00:05:31.144 - 00:06:36.088, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the programmer class in China really came to be in the past, call it 15 years. I think it's a little later than the sort of 1990s Bill Gates of the world when they were tinkering with computers. I think they were. It really wasn't a big thing until zero eight, when mobile became a real fix. So that program request inherently is not only slightly smaller, although it's quickly rising, but also they still get treated incredibly well by the Alibaba, the Tencent, and the netizens of the world, and really cushy job, way above average salary, really comfortable where they are. And they might not be as in a position to be as aggressive as the fangs in the west to really explore something like web3 and crypto, especially when the chinese government wasn't exactly friendly. So there is a bit of adverse selection going on, which is if you are, I guess, a senior engineer, as opposed to Google, when that's the cool, hot thing, you probably wouldn't leave.
00:06:36.088 - 00:07:43.492, Speaker A: So when you have adverse selection, I think it's pretty natural to have the impression of lower caliber founders because it's those who can't make it or those who are sort of really just in it to make a quick buck, is a typical projects that people see. But I think that's changing, and I think that's changing for the reason where a lot of these programmers are western educated. They went to MIT, they took graduate school, they went to Google, and then they came back to China, hired, well, for what they're specializing in. And I think a lot of what's happening is they see their friends in Google quitting and joining Opensea or something. And that got those guys thinking. And this is becoming more and more obvious this year, especially when the chinese government is not only cracking down on crypto, but it's also cracking down on anything that's remotely rent seeking. I think a lot of these tech companies got absolutely smashed, and that got people thinking, oh God, all my friends are jumping, and what should I be doing? Especially in the second half, you see a lot of really high caliber talent really thinking about this, especially in the gaming space.
00:07:43.492 - 00:08:12.774, Speaker A: And I used to joke that we're running a little over it, but I used to joke that the zero to one moment happens in the west because it's a lot of the infrastructure, it's a lot of the cryptography. But I think Asia, especially chinese, they're really good at b, two c applications. They are good at being very aggressive and utilizing capital to gain market share and get a critical scale. So that group of founders, I think they're coming to the space, and whether they do it in Shanghai or Singapore, I think it's up to them. Yeah.
00:08:12.814 - 00:08:47.906, Speaker C: And I always say that the products with the most product market fit in crypto right now. The exchanges, the most revenues, they're all basically built by chinese teams, most of them, and even the up and comers have moved here to Hong Kong, well, at least for a while. So I'm very interested to see that play out. I'd love to kind of jump into the predictions that you made, because there are a lot of super interesting ones here. And I'd love to start by diving into the first one, which is the highest level one. You mentioned that you think the ETH dominance level will go down as a consensus layer as users bring their attention and wealth into many different chains. So can you explain what you mean by that?
00:08:48.010 - 00:10:28.316, Speaker A: Yeah, I think ETH layer one itself chose a security trade off that allows for heightened level of safety, but in exchange you have to pay $50 for one transaction. I think in the past couple of years that that's like, fine when the price was a couple hundred bucks, but at $3,000, it becomes very expensive for most, if not all, applications, especially when you're trying to reach millions of people. And if web3 tries to reach millions of people, I think the space is starting to take certain types of trade offs in terms of decentralization and security, in terms of can we jam certain data in different layers to really save on block space, or simply can we reach other types of consensus mechanism that is somewhat unproven in terms of security, but can get us a lot more throughput and become hopefully more adaptive to the demand that some of the web3 apps are having. As that happens, I think the original belief that this has to be extremely safe, extremely decentralized, is, I think I think as more and more people come to the space and as the space become more and more b, two c, the ultimate customers get to decide what they want. And I think until there's like a huge break event where decentralization and sort of security is really tested, I think people are just going to go where this experience is best and where they can still seek massive amount of p and l. And you already see meaningful amount of layers, layer ones that get. Get spun up.
00:10:28.316 - 00:10:54.304, Speaker A: And all of them have their EVM sort of L2s, if not already EVM compatible. And all of them have a war chest akin to 100 million to a billion dollars. And they're going to go really aggressive trying to grab incremental the next ten x of engineers building onto them. So as that kind of happens, as they spend that marketing, engineering spend, it's hard to not envision. When we get the next 10 million users, Yves will get the same sort of 80% plus market share to get a smart contract.
00:10:55.604 - 00:11:21.578, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm always super interested in this view about alternative layer ones because on one hand I'm a huge proponent of building things that people can actually use, not just crypto natives or crypto whales. But at the same time I'm also a little bit concerned about the nihilism of having layer ones that are just scaling at all costs and doesn't matter if they're centralized or completely centralized in the case of some kind of exchange chains. How do you think about the trade off?
00:11:21.716 - 00:11:53.466, Speaker A: I don't know. I still haven't come to a conclusion yet. I think. I think if it's. I think at some point the state of those networks need to be snapshotted, probably back to some consensus layer. It could very well be, but I sort of feel like there are a long tail of lower value use cases that are probably just fine floating on these less secure layer ones, as long as there is a clean and easy way to get back to the main chain. That's kind of my, my framework.
00:11:53.466 - 00:12:30.034, Speaker A: Um, but I don't. I'm still, I'm still deciding whether, you know, this fragmentation will eventually migrate back to this, like one or two chain being the dominant one, eventually. I don't know what that would look like yet, but that's kind of a cop out answer. I think. I think that sort of the quick and simple dirty trick is I really try not to pick that kind of layer one battle. I try to sort of pick the apps on top or anything that's not layer one in the sort of infrared and tools layer and bet on them instead, because I don't think I really have an edge in which layer one is going to win.
00:12:30.454 - 00:13:09.536, Speaker C: That's really interesting, because even in one of our first conversations, I remember you mentioning that your focus is mostly on the application layer and your edge is really there. So one of the app focuses, focused predictions that you made is that it's possible that Uniswap and compound and Opensea will be forked by many top apps and you get a lot of failure, destruction as token and docs. So I'm really interested in what you think will happen because that's kind of already happened in Defi before, with Uniswap being forked by sushiswap and then compound being forked by cream. And Opensea was recently forked by this Opendao. So how do you think those would play out?
00:13:09.720 - 00:13:35.130, Speaker A: Yeah, so it used to be. I sort of. There used to be only Ethan Defi, right. If we dial back to mid 2020, that's like, there's only China before other civilizations. I guess if you're british, you would have thought the same thing. And then all of the other industries start emerging on all the other labels. It's almost like new countries get developed.
00:13:35.130 - 00:14:47.514, Speaker A: So, like, as the leading bank in England. Like the bank of England, yeah, they could set up branches in those other countries, but those other countries want their own stuff because, boy, I want to be on the ground floor of the next Uniswap. And they're going to give me a lot more tokens when I use these, you know, like these, these services. So why should I use Uniswap or sushi? So one thing I was dead wrong on, I mean, there's like, execution issues also, but like, Sushisoft's multi chain expansion was like, was like pretty, pretty vapid. And to that extent, it sort of became clear to me that I think customer mind share and owning the customer is just like in web two, is still pretty important. And whoever owns the customer's mind share, whether it's on a new chain or just generally is in an excellent position to ran seek or just like be in a position to potentially have some tick rates. You see it in Metamask's 200 million annualized revenue, and you also see in something like Axio Infinity in their own ronin chain, they have their own Dex, and immediately, well, there's a farming reason, but they have massive, massive revenue.
00:14:47.514 - 00:15:46.902, Speaker A: So my sense is if, let's say I'm an application, I'm an onlyfans type app, and I was successful in grabbing all the cute girls and all of a sudden I have 15 million users and let's say I'm sitting on my own L2 that is on top of ethereum. I think what I want to probably do is to have because uniswap v two isn't that hard to fork. There are easy forks of compound coming up. If I want to fork a min like stablecoin, I probably can. Opensea is going to take a lot more effort, but if I really want to for my interesting girl jpegs, I can probably spend three months hiring some good engineers to specialize in something like this. And then what I get is I have 15 million of users on one hand that are always on my platform, clicking likes and subscribing. On the other hand they're trading and transacting and interacting in my native app.
00:15:46.902 - 00:16:42.274, Speaker A: They probably won't go on Chrome and download metamask and do all these other things if they're onboarded just through my native apps. All of a sudden I have this massive financial empire infrastructure that I can just grab because they are all pretty well built and the take rate can go back within the ecosystem to support the currency to further growth to market. I think it's pretty natural, and I can tell you that I think it's very natural for axie infinity to have their own compound on your own. And I think it's very natural to well, they should probably use USDC because that's what everybody's used to, but they will probably have their own axie open space opensea, because then you have the best filtering. You have really in depth in game analytics that is tied to it. I think the users would be most used to playing with it there going to OpenSea, switching to network and then going one to two more hops. That's where I'm coming from.
00:16:44.454 - 00:16:56.224, Speaker C: So you're basically saying that any applications with current users can fork the tech of any other project, and that I guess the code itself is never really emote.
00:16:57.324 - 00:17:48.334, Speaker A: I guess not everything, because the composability of these lp tokens and to be able to be plugged in a huge liquidity pool to borrow is hugely advantageous. I think there is a small subset of really major protocols in DeFi are just very natural tick rate generators for some of these major apps, and they are simple enough that they could just be grabbed easily. The more complex defi protocols such as EYDX, such as ribbon, such as urn. I don't think it makes much sense for an application to grab them. I think ultimately it's like where do you want to take the side question and do I really need the composability that is currently existing in Yves?
00:17:49.354 - 00:18:07.454, Speaker C: Then does it make sense to keep investing in, I guess, primitive layer applications like the lending protocols or the trading protocols? If the thesis is that any application with significant users can easily fork these and then just completely steal over the users, or should your attention be spent maybe at the aggregator level?
00:18:09.634 - 00:18:53.064, Speaker A: I think for me I have really shied away from placing bets in the sort of easy copies you can kind of. I mean you see a lot of them, right? I'm not saying they can't make money, but I think the bar for their success I think would be based on their own ecosystems. Is your harmony chain gonna do massive, massive volume in the future? And you as the leading Dex with 50% traffic plus 80% attention will be a clear winner. But I think the application, it's a much harder game to play. But I think owning the customer is where it's at.
00:18:54.044 - 00:19:19.944, Speaker C: And I guess with that note, how do you think about moats in Defi? We've talked about this a lot before on different mediums as well. I think some people think that the team is the mode, but to me that's almost like a cop out answer because the team is always the mode in any type of company. So what do you think is something that can actually give projects a defensive mode over time? Some. Something that's strategic, that's very hard to just fork a steal.
00:19:21.604 - 00:19:47.954, Speaker A: I think it goes back to the good old, you know, I think there are a few things. I think the mental model I use, it goes back to the tardfy days, unfortunately, but it's like. But it's like customer acquisition cost spent. It's like, oh I know, Opensea and that's the first one I go to like oh, I want to interact with web3. What does everybody use? Metamask. Okay, it's everywhere easy. And that's like a cost that was pre spent and customers just.
00:19:47.954 - 00:20:35.234, Speaker A: It's the most convenient, lazy way to get to it. The second thing is the good old network effect. Although that's. I think there are strong forms and there are weak forms for OpenSea in particular. Like I'm actually pretty bearish on if anything that's like a JPEG platform on Ethereum wanted to fork Opensea. I think it will be really hard to bet on all of them because it's a form of highly fragmented, single vertical network effect based business. Because the searching costs and the transactional cost is so high to get the deal done, so you want the platform the most traffic, I think that's still universally applicable except for liquidity in something like Uniswap is much more easy to migrate versus something like, let's say on OpenSea, but network effects certainly withstand.
00:20:35.234 - 00:21:16.554, Speaker A: And the third thing I would almost argue is corporate governance and ethics. I'm almost certain that a project with better ethics and perceived better corporate governance and more transparency pound for pound versus another project would just get a better valuation, and a better valuation allows that protocol to attract hopefully better talent, but also have a better sort of bigger war chest to just compete. I think those three things right now is what I sort of perceive as the more important thing that is sort of almost lastable moat.
00:21:17.974 - 00:22:04.254, Speaker B: Now, before I continue, I'd love to share one of my favorite products in crypto with you. Now, whenever I want to trade a token instead of going to uniswap, sushiswap Bancor one x one to see where I can find the best quote, I just go to Paraswap to scan for the best price anywhere because per swap aggregates all the popular Ethereum dexs and saves me a ton of time and headache in finding where I can trade something for the best price and lets me trade in one place. Now the cool thing is theyve also integrated with ledger live as well, meaning I can now swap at the best prices directly from my ledger wallet. So seriously, if you are a defi trader and you're worried about the security risks of centralized exchanges, but you also don't want to scour dozens of dexs just to find the best price, you have to check out Paraswap. So head on over to Paraswap IO blockcrunch.
00:22:04.554 - 00:22:19.774, Speaker C: And are there projects out there today that look like they should be easily forkable and not really defensible, but have done these few things right, these customer acquisition, cost spend ethics and corp governance, that they have done it right and they've kind of managed to be market leader so far?
00:22:20.074 - 00:22:46.998, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. I think dy DX have a bit of that right. If you look on, it has the four thing, which is like, it's a pretty complex, well, there are two kinks to it. The one kink is nobody can tell you what a token actually does, which kind of goes against cover governance. But you know for sure they won't rug you. They won't just like walk away. And the second thing is, it does have pretty solid tech.
00:22:46.998 - 00:23:27.802, Speaker A: That also makes it a very good experience, but I would consider them ethical. I would consider the liquidity and the sort of market makers that operate on that platform to be somewhat sticky, because you do want to operate on platform that has a lot of traffic and they sort of have that. And when you think about trading perp futures on Ethereum, if you really try to, that's like the first name that pop up, at least for people within the space. So for now, I think it's in a pretty decent position. Not that it can be, not that it can't face competition, but that one stands out to your question. I'm sure there are others, but like, I haven't prepped for that question. So that's the only answer I have that makes sense.
00:23:27.858 - 00:23:47.704, Speaker C: And I think it's also a good time to segue into the tangent that you mentioned, which is projects that own the customer relationship monetizes the best. So are there any examples that you have in mind about how projects are owning the customer relationship? And what does that mean? Like, for founders listening out there, how do they go about owning the relationship?
00:23:48.644 - 00:24:18.094, Speaker A: Yeah, I always go back to Metamask. It's kind of like, I mean, well, I think there are a few interesting misses by metamask. The multi chain experience isn't the best. They miss an opportunity to become the inbox of web3. It's crazy to me that you can't send messages in metamask, for example, because everybody use it, 80%, 90% market share. I want to talk to Jason. Why can I? And I kind of know his address.
00:24:18.094 - 00:24:53.134, Speaker A: He's docs himself to me. Like, why can't I send a message to him? It should be an inbox. The experience integration with hardware wallet is atrocious. And overall, the UI Ux is just not the best. It could be iterated ten times better easily. But, but what does it have? Is that it was built as the first solution to interact with, you know, web3 protocols, and it just became like, hey, just get metamask and interact. And then it, and then that's where I think that is the highest frequency application that every customer use every day.
00:24:53.134 - 00:25:26.104, Speaker A: Like you, it is. You look at every day you interact with every day. So the first thing you think about interacting with three, you think of it, and then because of that convenience, because of that sort of scale, they could try to monetize you in all different ways, similar to how Facebook and WeChat and all these other applications monetizes. And that's a powerful thing. Evident by 75 bits take rate. Now, to be fair part of it could be just farming for metamask tokens. That has to come.
00:25:26.104 - 00:25:32.554, Speaker A: I bet you there are tons of people out there that didn't know metamask charges 75 bits, and they just swap because it's convenient.
00:25:33.814 - 00:25:59.748, Speaker C: And I guess in terms of the aggregators out there for things like one inch or Wifi or Wyrn, these projects basically have a similar thesis where they want to be the one stop shop where everybody goes to do for one inch the trading and for wiren their yield farming, and then they want to upsell their users by offering other services. What are your opinions on those two projects or those two types of projects? Just tokenized aggregators?
00:25:59.916 - 00:26:56.184, Speaker A: Yeah, I think they still need a channel to reach the ultimate customer because there are still customer acquisition costs. It's like, how do users find them? And the users don't find them unless they look for them. And when they become web 3d gen native, you have to kind of like dig a few layers deeper to really discover Wi Fi. It's not immediately obvious when you go and download metamask, like, oh, I need to put some dollars to work, and you'll farm. Wifi doesn't really immediately come to mind. And then the question becomes, what can Wifi do to make that happen? Could it be working very closely with Metamask? Could it be working closely with Brave and the chrome browser? You know, I don't know. And maybe paying a rebate to become the de facto, you know, entryway.
00:26:56.184 - 00:27:16.184, Speaker A: But. But it's not immediately like they will become the layer that aggregates everything below, because for whatever that's below Wi Fi. Let's say they do this well, it's gonna be really, really, really tough. But I don't know. I don't think they're at that stage yet where they just really become the thing that customer interfaces with.
00:27:16.944 - 00:27:30.536, Speaker C: Interesting, because when you said that you're looking at projects that own customer relationship, I kind of assumed that you were talking about aggregators, but it sounds like you're mostly thinking about metamask. Are there other examples out in the public infrastructure space?
00:27:30.680 - 00:28:06.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I think another one could be like, say, coin 98 in Vietnam. Again, it's like a wallet like thing. I think Ledger and Trezor could be customer owning vehicles. I think it's if they have ambition and if they can actually nail this, I mean, they could have a metamask fork. It's the most natural thing, right? 2 million users for ledger, they could at least compete. I think all the games are excellent customer ownership tools. Right? Because it's the first thing you onboard, it's the first thing you recognize.
00:28:06.654 - 00:28:48.440, Speaker A: I think if Axie Infinity, well, they already have a ronin wallet, but that's the app that people use. And through the axie Infinity Ronin thing, people get to understand what web3 is all about. So that's another user customer ownership tool, I think things that people spend a ton of time on could be it. So dbank from China Zapper. I just want to see how my portfolio is doing. If I'm wealth three, yeah, I use web metamask login, but like I will always have the bank open, maybe just to claim my forums or whatnot. And I really high frequency interactions and I don't know how to monetize it yet.
00:28:48.440 - 00:28:53.804, Speaker A: Maybe they have to think about it, but I think it's those kind of things that I'll be most interested.
00:28:54.224 - 00:29:31.114, Speaker C: That's super interesting, because I personally have always been a little bit skeptical of wallets with some expectations, with some exceptions, and also dashboards, also with some exceptions there, because I always considered them to be quite easy to fork. But then in the past year of my experience of using things like Zapper or eight board, once I start using it, it's very hard for me to start another page and just inject all the addresses that I use. So there's actually some stickiness there. And an example you brought up that I rarely hear that any other guest brought up before is coin 98. So for people not familiar with what it is, can you explain what it is and why you're excited about it?
00:29:32.794 - 00:30:20.920, Speaker A: So, Fan Lei, the founder, needs to get me some updated data, but it's basically the largest customer on ramp in Vietnam and maybe Southeast Asia. They are a comprehensive suite of desktop plugin, mobile phone app where it sort of amalgamates the purpose of metamask, Zapper, and even Wootrade and binance all into one application. So if your chances are, if you're in Vietnam and you're trying to like, well, maybe you get access to like Ronin first because you're playing axie, but if you're like trying to do defi stuff, odds are you probably interacting with call 98 because that's where you get your information, that's where that is your plugin versus metamask. So it's like a full comprehensive user onboarding toolset.
00:30:20.992 - 00:30:29.264, Speaker C: So I would say interesting. So Dydx, C 98, Debank, and Zapper. So it sounds like you're very much defi focused. I really like that.
00:30:29.384 - 00:30:32.684, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a part of the portfolio.
00:30:33.384 - 00:30:52.152, Speaker C: Awesome. And I guess speaking of DeFi, another thesis that you had is you think there will be a potential breakthrough of new DeFi primitives. And you specifically mentioned insurance and under collateralized lending. So what gives you the conviction that this thing might take off? Because I think these two are the verticals that really lagged the rest of defi.
00:30:52.328 - 00:31:26.774, Speaker A: Yeah, and by the way, I think conviction is a strong word. I would doubt myself. I think they are. They are interesting enough because it's unsolved problem space and all of these market caps of these protocols are not very good. And it's different reasons. I think for insurance, for instance, the typical holding period for the apes is probably anywhere between eight to 72 hours. The cost of capital in the space, depending on who you are, ranges from between 6% to 45%.
00:31:26.774 - 00:32:03.378, Speaker A: And it will be really hard. And by the way, this is an unknown, unknown question. You either have a bug in your code or you don't. And the best hackers are hacking versus trying to protect. And the cost of protection is really high and many different vectors. So you sort of don't really have a area with product market fit for direct b two c insurance protocol that takes the space as capitalist, its source of funding for a whole host of reasons. I'm intrigued in it because I also think audit today in the space is fundamentally broken.
00:32:03.378 - 00:33:08.760, Speaker A: You know, two to three month lead time, uncertain result, you know, the best auditors might not catch the bug, potential misalignment of incentives. I think it's not the first time you hear the auditor, the auditor code rocks the protocol, you know, I'll tell you, I think there is tremendous room now that we see the breakthroughs of, let's say, ohm and a few other things to have a for example, I'm giving you some alpha. If you're building this, if you after hearing me say this, you're building this, let me know. I think there's room for a all in one audit plus insurance dao model where you can call it insurance Dao, where you have hackers coming together doing b two b insurance for protocols in exchange for either cash upfront or tokens. And all while having your own token in the market as a listed company that continuously issue your tokens in a own fashion to continuous buttress the treasury. And not only for audit, but you also offer protection of TVL through your treasury. So it's almost like a mini birth share in a way.
00:33:08.760 - 00:33:47.048, Speaker A: And why would anybody buy to the token is because they will probably get the best deals in the market. I mean, who wouldn't want paradigm working for you and auditing your code and providing insurance? Whoever builds that protocol and have to buy in, have legitimacy I think would be a very powerful force. And that, I think is what I would call a breakthrough. It's like a b, two b kind of insurance like this. You probably want to talk about it later, but we can. Let me finish on collateral sending first. The second part is, I think everything lending in the space today so far the majority is continuous price collateral, sorry.
00:33:47.048 - 00:34:34.378, Speaker A: It is collateral based lending with a continuous price subject to liquidation. However, I think the space is migrating beyond from ETH and DeFi to multi chain, multi layer, multi industry, where we start to see businesses that actually have real cash flow that is hopefully non speculative. It can be levered and somewhat stable. Prop shops, nodes, miners staking pools, increasingly guilds, daos. And I'm sure there will be other kind of organizations that can generate decent returns and they will have leverage needs, they will have working capital needs, they will have ultimately credit demand. And I think a year ago we don't have credit demand. It's like a soft space.
00:34:34.378 - 00:35:24.334, Speaker A: Maybe prop shops need it, but increasingly we have this emergence of demand for credit that there's no way they will be satisfied by JP Morgan. They will be satisfied to some extent by blockfi and genesis. But I think it's even more interesting if they can be satisfied by web3 native capital through some clever mechanism that allow for off chain recourse, that allows for polling of risk, and that allows for centralized or decentralized underwriting. I think someone needs to satisfy and the most interesting thing is that we'll have this token permissioned thing where historically, like you are a debt holder, you get interest, but now you can have convertible bonds where yeah, you get an interest, that maybe you get tokens, and maybe you'll get some really cool perks that were otherwise not available. So it's this emergence of credit makes me pretty bullish on someone potentially solving that problem.
00:35:25.034 - 00:35:29.494, Speaker C: And have you come across any projects that's launched that's doing either of these things right now?
00:35:31.554 - 00:36:03.944, Speaker A: I think for insurance, not yet. I think there are models that could follow it that could be interesting. I think it's very natural, for example for Wonderland, for ohm, for new order and the likes of these daos to start doing it. But I haven't seen white hat hackers coming together. Maybe Sam one day would run something like this and I would just probably ape in. So insurance? No, on lending side, I'm not sure what the best model is yet. I like the delegated model by Maple.
00:36:03.944 - 00:36:38.924, Speaker A: I think attracting capital longer term for them would be kind of an issue. So they have to do a lot of business development to attract outside of web3 capital and really give them some perk. Right now it's their own token. Eventually they will need to figure out some other way. I think it could be a shoeboxed b two B solution that is a Kyc AML token with some enforcement capacity, a servicer that maybe Violet is building. But it's like an amorphous space that's coming together at the moment.
00:36:41.384 - 00:37:31.790, Speaker C: Since you mentioned this idea of an insurance dow, I think this is also a good segue to another prediction you made, which I was really interested in, which is that some investment Dao really kills it as the preeminent capital allocator. And this was probably the one I was most skeptical about because I guess in most styles we still see some sort of a free rider problem, especially when they scale, you see kind of people undercutting their own dao. So I'm assuming that with an investment Dao, you know, if it really takes off, there's probably more, less incentive for people to really contribute and more incentive for people to front run the Dow, almost in investment, similar for the insurance Dow. So if one individual contributor finds out a big bug, maybe there's more incentive for them to exploit the bug versus contribute to the DAO. So I'm curious how you think about specifically this free rider problem. And I guess in general, what gives you conviction that, you know, some investment DaO would kind of actually work out.
00:37:31.982 - 00:38:12.914, Speaker A: Yeah, that's good. That's a good point. I think I'll share some personal opinions first, which is, I guess the first thing the free rider problem is the cause of the issue is token distribution initially, and that they want to make it an athenian democracy. I don't know why people think that that needs to be athenian democracy. I don't know why that share classes weren't experimented with vote segmentation. I don't know why the sort of modern corporate structure of token holders deciding, council deciding the management, and management having full control hasn't been experimented yet. I mean, this is a war of attrition and a war of scaling and a war of billion dollar market cap we're talking about.
00:38:12.914 - 00:38:55.534, Speaker A: So you kind of want to see certain dictatorship with it. I don't know why people have this crazy notion that it has to be decentralized. It could be run like a company with four people, which a lot of them kind of are, except nobody wants to admit it. So the free rider problem to me seems like an issue of how you want to structure a token distribution and how you want your token holders to contribute. Because if there's no affinity in democracy, if the token holders are limited to their rights, and if there is a pre built consensus that it's really the management that you're relying on and you're actually trusting them to make all the decisions, I think these stats can move a lot quicker. So I think it's almost an.org structure issue.
00:38:55.534 - 00:39:34.534, Speaker A: For example, if you and I were to start a fund and we launched this on chain and we have all the control dual share class, two shares of b shares 100 times to vote and then a bunch of a shares for all the other public LP's and we have complete control, everybody knows where we are. We set the LLC in real life, tethered that LLC to the stao. I think it's perfectly fine. We're two dictators running this organization. Who cares? It's fine. To that end, I think those experimentations will happen. It's already happening when you see all these guilds coming because I really view these guilds as hedge funds.
00:39:34.534 - 00:40:09.064, Speaker A: They are asset and gaming niche hedge funds that happens to have a loss leading arm of having scholars and sharing profits with these scholars to really win deals into the best and most lucrative early stage startups. And that's a beautiful, perfect model. You have hedge funds like Blackpool that is literally just aping into quant NFT trading. That's perfectly fine. It's Dao. And Julian is sort of owning everything. It's really a multisig of a bunch of his friends, but that's totally fine.
00:40:09.064 - 00:40:50.732, Speaker A: What's the third one? I was going to say Paragon style. It's literally a bunch of guys coming together pulling their assets that is dedicated to the parallel ecosystem system. It is a hedge fund, but that's totally fine because who doesn't want to buy a basket of all the alpha generators in this space? Especially when paradigm and the company is involved, right? And Yuan Capital is involved. So and you see these new models emerging like new Order. It's basically a vc listed dow. I mean they're literally outlier guys, sourcing deals, incubating them and jamming their advisor allocation into the listed company, quote unquote, that is in the treasury. So I'm actually very bullish on personal human domain expertise.
00:40:50.732 - 00:41:25.954, Speaker A: The space has gotten so complex that nobody can cover everything. A small group of individuals that is incentive aligned and know each other well and have the trust of the community can literally spin up these kind of organization dao vehicles to gather assets and do what they do best, which is generating alpha in their own niche and maybe get paid for. And I think those guys are going to emerge like if throughout capital launches a Dow tomorrow pulling capital on influencer based advisory token for their treasury. I would totally ape into that. Who wouldn't?
00:41:27.094 - 00:41:40.544, Speaker C: That makes a lot of sense. And I wouldn't be surprised if some of the larger names, like some of the companies that started back in 2018 2017, started to become Dao. It's like I wouldn't be surprised to see a Delphi, Dow or Defi alliance.
00:41:41.044 - 00:41:44.524, Speaker A: Got an ape into all of these.
00:41:44.644 - 00:42:01.384, Speaker C: Well, I'm super glad we got to discuss most of your predictions, but there are a few that we left out. But for the purpose of time, I'd love to understand how you plan to spend your time or allocate your time in this coming year. What are the areas that you're going to spend your most time in? Maybe some areas that you spend less time in.
00:42:01.844 - 00:42:45.312, Speaker A: Yeah, I've identified four areas that I think are most interesting. I think it's what I would call digital entertainment, which includes games, but a bunch of other random social stuff that is directly to c. Second thing is what I would call new financial primitives, which we kind of talked about insurance. And there's a bunch of other things that is not mentioned, like aggregation, like middleware, like a bunch of other stuff. I would say organizations as a form of, quote, fund to fund allocation is very interesting. We kind of touched on that. And then a fourth one, owning the customer relationship, the web3 entryway, which we also touched.
00:42:45.312 - 00:43:51.494, Speaker A: So, like, everything we covered today sort of touched on what I would be most interesting, because I think this is the year where I feel like the infrastructure just gets good enough, the fiat on off ramp just gets smooth enough, and the Defi infrastructure just get robust enough where we can have some really crazy experimentations with smart engineers building actual two CN, two B applications that can bring us 10 million users. So whoever does that first will have a lot of power. What I would probably spend less time on, the last thing, spend more time. Hopefully I'll have people and myself included in these alternative, interesting, burgeoning l one s and l two s, especially in things like Luna and Cosmos and also Solano. And there are a few really interesting new things happening on algorithm. I'm spread super thin. So I guess what I would probably do less of is I don't know, if you're just copying and forking something that's existing or you're sort of, I don't know, just incremental improvements, I'll probably spend less and less time doing it.
00:43:51.494 - 00:44:13.214, Speaker A: I don't know why that is. But a lot of engineers I've talked to who are excellent at what they do in FAAng and finance, they come to the space and they're like, I want to do a uni v three sort of pool. Oh, I want to do like a yield aggregator. I'm like, dude, like, you're really wasting your talent on something that's like, only incremental improvement that you're very used to, in fact. But, like, I think you should think bigger.
00:44:15.114 - 00:44:26.048, Speaker C: I absolutely agree. I think on that note, it's a great note to kind of wrap this up on. And for people who want to reach out to you and follow your insights, what is the best channel for them to do this?
00:44:26.176 - 00:44:36.084, Speaker A: Yes, you can follow me at Cap on Twitter, same handle on Telegram. And you can reach out to me also through Jasonolius Ventures.
00:44:36.984 - 00:44:39.944, Speaker C: Awesome. Well, thanks so much for taking your time, Jason. This is really fun.
00:44:40.064 - 00:44:43.184, Speaker A: Yeah, it was great. Students do this more often, definitely.
