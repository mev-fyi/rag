00:00:02.040 - 00:00:08.714, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, gentlemen, welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto.
00:00:17.214 - 00:00:38.984, Speaker B: And before we get started, just a reminder for you guys out there. The Blockcrunch podcast is intended for informational purposes only. Neither the host nor its guests are licensed financial advisors, and nothing discussed should be construed as financial advice. Views held by Blockcrent's guests are their own, and sponsorship messages do not constitute financial advice or endorsement. With that out of the way, let's jump right in.
00:00:39.324 - 00:00:54.424, Speaker A: Today's episode is brought to you by Protocol Labs, the team behind Filecoin. And with me today is Colin Efrin from protocol Labs, who leads ecosystem there to tell us why people should choose Filecoin over alternatives. So, Colin, why should people be using Filecoin over other competitors?
00:00:55.044 - 00:01:26.320, Speaker C: Filecoin believes that web3 will only win by offering a better product at a better price point. When it comes to storage, Filecoin offers the most scale at the cheapest price, with strong guarantees uniquely enabled by its open market of storage providers and its crypto economic incentives. Now, smart contracts on Filecoin, which launches in q one of 2023, only make this more powerful. It enables users to create perpetual storage deals to store data forever at costs that are a small fraction of centralized storage.
00:01:26.332 - 00:01:58.506, Speaker A: Storage providers like Esther hello there. Now, before I move on, I'd love to thank the hundreds of you who have subscribed to blockchain. Because with your support, I've been able to share my real thoughts on specific projects that I don't usually share, on interviews in a format that I enjoy more, which is bi weekly written posts. We've also been able to offer exclusive AMA's, sharing my investment frameworks, interactable models, and breaking down important trends before they become big. Now, we even had Elon Musk comment on one of our threads recently. So if you haven't already, head on over to theBlockcrench.com VIP and you can.
00:01:58.530 - 00:02:00.426, Speaker B: Access dozens of hours of research for.
00:02:00.450 - 00:02:41.616, Speaker A: What you'd spend on a coffee a day. All right, hey, everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, recently, as of this recording, Crypto has faced quite a bit of a roller coaster ride. We have the SEC going after two of Crypto's largest companies with lawsuits like Coinbase and Binance. But on the back of that, we also have some of the largest asset managers in the world, like Blackrock and Fidelity, applying for ETF's. So amidst all this noise, I thought it would be a great idea to talk to the few surviving investors who are still investing their time and money into what they consider to be secular growth trends. And one of the funds that I've come to know over the years and deeply respect for their originality and conviction, is Maven Eleven.
00:02:41.616 - 00:03:25.418, Speaker A: So give a little bit of context here. Maven Eleven recently raised a 120 million venture fund, and they're constantly early to very big trends in crypto. And I've noticed this over the past few years of knowing the guys there. They were early investors in things like Olympus. Before Stefi became a major thing, there were seed investors in a company called Gensin, which is now a company helping AI models run on decentralized networks, that recently raised a $43 million round in this market, which is no easy feat at all. But I think, most interestingly, Maven was one of the first funds ever to talk about this idea of data availability. And they were one of the first to invest in Celestia, which for the tech savvy among, you know, that it's becoming a major part of the roll up thesis and the entire Ethereum roadmap.
00:03:25.418 - 00:03:37.498, Speaker A: So, to find out what still excited these precise investors in an otherwise very quiet market, I'm really excited to invite my friends Balder and Matthias from Maven eleven onto the show. So, welcome to the show, guys.
00:03:37.666 - 00:03:39.174, Speaker D: Great, great being here.
00:03:39.754 - 00:03:48.134, Speaker A: So why don't we get started by telling our listeners a little bit of the story for Maven Eleven? So how did you guys get started? What is Maven Eleven and what does the name mean?
00:03:49.204 - 00:04:13.396, Speaker D: Perfect. Well, I'll kick off and Matthias, obviously fill in when needed. So, yeah. The backdrop of Maven Eleven is that the two co founders have been investing in the space since 2011. That's where the eleven comes from in Maven. Maven is sort of a marketing slang for experts, so they've been investing in this space for quite some time. Then in 2015, decided to sort of more institutionalize this, set up a fund.
00:04:13.396 - 00:04:40.403, Speaker D: That took a very long time back then. Right. So they wanted to set up a structure here based in the Netherlands. They have been very keen on putting it up in the Netherlands because back then, asking investors to wire money for this industry back in 2015 was a little bit more complicated. If you could come up with a BVI or Cayman like structure. So they were very adamant on setting it up in the Netherlands, which was extremely difficult. Getting a bank account took around 18 months back then.
00:04:40.403 - 00:05:24.534, Speaker D: So essentially it got launched, started 2017. That was the first fund. It was an open ended structure, and that has indeed been investing since and is currently in more of a harvesting motors. And then on the back of that first fund, which has been alive since then, we raised the second fund like you just alluded to at the end of 2021, that's currently still on deployment motors and indeed very big on the modular thesis, but also other verticals like D van NFts. So that's sort of the high over backdrop of the company. My background personally has been in investment banking, so joined the firm in 2017 after about being very excited about what Crypto has to offer for the future. Now, there's a lot of obviously angles towards that.
00:05:24.534 - 00:05:39.074, Speaker D: So been with the company since, and Matthias is always making the running joke if we're getting into a call with founders that he has joined the firm before me, and that's true. So he was four months earlier than I was. So he was definitely a Ted earlier. So go ahead, Mattias.
00:05:39.814 - 00:06:30.964, Speaker E: Yeah, I got into crypto in 2016. I was buying and selling in game items and I got paid via ether, started reading up on it more. Fell down the rabbit hole with Auger, which I think recently, prediction markets have gotten more attention again, right, with polymarket now and consequently joined Maven because I was spending all my free time on this industry anyway, so I figured why not make some money while doing so, was studying part time and part time analyst at the fund. Graduated 2019 at like depths of the bear market. Decided to go in crypto full time, not without some hesitation, because back then it was really like, okay, this industry, is it going to survive for a year or two more? I think you also remember Jason. Yeah. Have been helping build our infrastructure, teasers and venture investments since then.
00:06:32.104 - 00:06:42.844, Speaker A: I guess all of us have been around since the pretty early days. Do you guys feel like this time around for the bear market, is it worse than 2019? 2018, or is it better, or how is it different?
00:06:43.544 - 00:07:03.344, Speaker E: I think it's actually better. There's less fundamental risk of this industry existing in two years, whereas in 2019, I definitely remember that there was more like, okay, is this thing going to be around at all? So I would argue it's not worse. Maybe the regulatory climate is, but yeah.
00:07:03.464 - 00:07:47.528, Speaker D: Yeah, I would fully agree. I think it's maybe even way better, right? I mean, if you see the use cases that have been building over the last couple of years on Ethereum, other chains right around DeFi, open finance and NFT use cases, we have a lot more stuff you can use. You can build upon a lot more users overall, although we're somewhat in a sort of a downtrend for now. But compared to 2018, everything was sort of fake. So it's a completely different time. And the pricing is obviously a result of the phase where we are in the market, but also a result of the fact that there's a lot of players who were over levered over the course of 2022 that's out of the market. So I think overall, we're in a way healthier market than we have been then in 2018.
00:07:47.656 - 00:08:17.804, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I think I agree there as well. And I'd love to dive into the thesis that I think a lot of people know you guys for, which is the modular blockchain thesis, but before that, I guess at a high level, because when you guys first started investing, a lot of these things weren't around. Right. We barely had that many l one s. We didn't really have DeFi, we didn't have nfts. So can you guys walk us through how you approach thesis formation and whether there's been any major changes to your thesis since the beginning of Maven eleven to today?
00:08:18.814 - 00:09:08.394, Speaker E: In general, obviously you have a thesis, but we're also a seed fund, right? So in general, our thesis is also derived by the founders we back and where we see them having their interest in building and they also educate us and we sort of return and align our thesis with what they're doing. So I think especially the modular thesis you mentioned is a good example of that. It's not like we came up with the modular design. It was more like, hey, we saw these three founders, Ismael, John and Mustafa, building something extremely different than the rest of the industry back then. We were like, okay, this is interesting. And then we started to form a thesis around that. So in general, I would still say we back quality founders and then we build a thesis around what they're building and if that sort of fits our worldview.
00:09:08.394 - 00:09:19.354, Speaker E: And in that sense, the modular narrative or teasers with like roll ups, etcetera, definitely fit that sort of domain.
00:09:19.734 - 00:10:13.438, Speaker D: You know, these new ideas and trends are being built by a lot of these amazing, talented founders in this space, obviously. And you read up on these, on these trends, and you start to form a new idea or you see something happening or you have sort of an idea in the backdrop of your head and you go, well, there's something happening here. But it's also, I think a lot of the stuff in terms of thesis is maybe somewhat timing, right? I think open finance, the fact that we can automate transactions via smart contracts, has been a breakthrough development. And that's how open finance and Defi have been built today. But for instance, one of the sub protocols there is obviously real world assets which a lot of people have been chatting about over the last six to eight months. And I think that's because there's a lot more regulatory clarity happening which allows the teasers now to start playing out, right. If you would have done start tokenizing real world assets probably two, three years ago, it would have been way too early.
00:10:13.438 - 00:10:48.230, Speaker D: An investor in this space, you have sort of a base thesis and you also start to look into new subverticals as the industry matures. And I think that's very important that you need to have the flexibility to understand new domains and also start investing in these new domains. Obviously one of these newer verticals I think we have been seeing a lot of investments into is gaming. It's something we're closely looking at. But I wouldn't cause for instance, a very gaming expert fund today. So we say, okay, we think it's interesting, we follow all the trends and there might be in due time that we kind be allocating more capital into.
00:10:48.262 - 00:11:36.634, Speaker A: That subtesis yeah, I think that process is really interesting, right? Because from what Matthias was talking about, I think that type of approach for some VC's who are not as on the ball as you guys, it would tend to lead them to FOMo into things that they don't fully understand. So for instance, if a lot of people are talking about AI, suddenly all the VC's are trying to pile into AI without really fully understanding the unit economics. But for you guys, you seem to have a track record of being consistently early to big trends before they become a big thing. How do you identify things like that? Let's take the example of Jensen, for example. This is way before people even connected crypto and AI. And then you guys backed the seed round for this company that's doing decentralized compute for AI models. So how did you guys kind of come up with that thesis? And how did you guys find that company?
00:11:37.254 - 00:12:16.198, Speaker E: Yeah, I think sort of the thesis is maybe, which also. Yeah, what Balder said, just remind me of that. Like, you look for problems that these companies solve, right? And with the modular thesis, it was like scaling, okay, we saw that scaling was an issue. I think everybody saw. And then, okay, what's the solution to this? For Jensen, the problem is clearly that AWS is just making a lot of bank on selling compute resources, right? And then especially with the rise of AI, compute resources are only going to be in higher demand. That's quite clear. I think the Jensen thesis even, that there won't be enough compute to satisfy training all these models that are going to be out there.
00:12:16.198 - 00:12:46.774, Speaker E: And then on top of that, there's always the angle that crypto offers, right? The permissionless and decentralized angle. So the Jensen founders are very clearly thesis driven on this. Like, hey, training these models is just going to be politicalized almost, right? It's going to be a weapon, they say almost. So it doesn't make sense to make the decentralized and permissionless, we would argue. Yes, because that's, I think, why we're building in crypto. And there are also use cases where maybe that makes no sense. Right.
00:12:46.774 - 00:12:50.434, Speaker E: And then we shy away, typically.
00:12:50.734 - 00:13:28.614, Speaker A: And I think the last thing to touch on the kind of broader thesis part before we dive into modular blockchains is I'm curious what type of verticals you guys are still interested in. Because I think in this bear market, at least personally, we've seen a lot of verticals that were very much driven by hive kind of disproven. So, for instance, I think the idea of like decentralized virtual metaverses are like ten years way too early. So thesis like that, probably I'm not going to be putting a lot of my capital to work there anymore. Are there examples of thesis that you think have been somewhat disproven by the bear market? Or in other words, what are the verticals that you guys are still incredibly bullish on and paying attention to?
00:13:28.954 - 00:13:58.074, Speaker D: Well, incredibly bullishness is obviously a big statement, right. But I would say that DeFi and open finance are going to be here to stay. And I think they are definitely sort of in a somewhat darker place in terms of performance. A lot of these tokens have not done as well as people expected. I think TVL has dropped massively across the board over the last one and a half years. So I think there's a lot of arguments for people to make to maybe not invest in DeFi or shy away for this moment in time for us. I don't think that's really an issue.
00:13:58.074 - 00:14:09.074, Speaker D: Right. We are near time agnostic. We have a long term fund. It's eight years. So we're happy to invest into the space. We still think it's extremely exciting. One angle on the DeFi side, or actually two angles.
00:14:09.074 - 00:14:40.314, Speaker D: Obviously, the real world assets we just chatted about. I think that's definitely going to be an exciting domain for the years to come. Although it will probably move slower than DeFi as we have known it today, because there is sort of a regulatory angle there and you need to educate the more threat find environment on the topic. And secondly, everything around credit I think is extremely exciting. Credit has been completely, well, almost near went to zero over the last one and a half years. A lot of blow ups, especially on the credit side. We are definitely of the opinion that we'll come back.
00:14:40.314 - 00:15:15.774, Speaker D: Is it going to come back in a different and more transparent and more robust form? I hope so, because obviously credit hasn't done particularly well. And we have seen that all the trust assumptions which we have tried to build away from have been baked into our system over the last couple of years. And, well, that came about in 2022. And so, yeah, we hope that a new form of credit underwriting using more transparent and using sort of the blockchain scale, blockchain angle there, I think is going to be extremely. So we continue to invest in Defi and open finance and definitely credit is an angle we're very interested in.
00:15:16.554 - 00:15:43.590, Speaker E: Yeah. For me, I think it would maybe also be privacy tech. And I know this is maybe less popular. Right. It's quite hard to convince people like, hey, privacy matters, but we see a lot of adoption on the stablecoin side and I think that's sort of the original bitcoin use case. Hey, remittance, you can send money to somebody very easily, cut out a middleman, save fees, etcetera. But I do think that you need privacy on like a payment level before that gets widely adopted.
00:15:43.590 - 00:16:02.114, Speaker E: I don't want to send you maybe some USDC and then you being able to see my mortgage payments, my gosh, you know, all my transactions. So I think in that sense, just being able to confiscate a lot of your financial history makes a lot of sense to me for a lot of use cases.
00:16:02.774 - 00:16:22.886, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think a lot of people make it sound more controversial than it is. Right. They're, oh, privacy means money laundering, but if you think about our bank services, it's de facto private already, except to your bank, obviously. But if I wire you money today, bother's not going to know. So that's the default state of finance. And I think it makes a lot of sense for us to see that in DeFi.
00:16:22.886 - 00:16:45.294, Speaker A: But I like to kind of pivot quickly to talk about a big focus for you guys, which is modular blockchains. So I think one of the early big successful bets that you guys made was Celestia, previously known as lazy Ledger. But before we even dive into that, what exactly is a modular blockchain? And what gave you guys a conviction that, hey, this is the way, this is the future paradigm.
00:16:45.794 - 00:17:12.884, Speaker E: So what is a modular blockchain? It's just a blockchain that splits execution from data availability and consensus. You could also say execution and settlement, but there's a little bit of semantics about this. But in general, it's just the roll ups that we see where you move part of the execution off chain or to a sequencer or another blockchain, you could say, and thus scale the underlying base layer.
00:17:13.464 - 00:17:39.714, Speaker A: How does this fit in with the L2 vision? Because it seems a large part of the modular blockchain thesis is to increase scalability. But at the same time, a lot of people seem to think that maybe L2s alone in the current form are sufficient to scale ethereum. Or maybe monolithic chains like Solana, where you increase centralization a little bit, but you spin out a lot of blocks in a short amount of time is sufficient. So how does a modular blockchain advance the dialogue?
00:17:40.214 - 00:18:24.004, Speaker E: Yeah, I think what it allows for is way more scaling than that. And indeed, ethereum scales quite well right now. But if you imagine that there will be ten more rollups, I think the data availability needs for a lot of these rollups are not going to be able to be satisfied. So there is a limit to the users that can get onto these l two s today. In addition, maybe to go a little bit of a step back, when we initially found lazy ledger, we reached out to, I think, mustafa out of the blue. Then you had a lot of these scaling solutions being built, right? State channels or lightning network for bitcoin was one. You had, I think, plasma, and then plasma cash, which eventually turned into like, the optimism group and the optimistic roll ups.
00:18:24.004 - 00:19:21.694, Speaker E: And that was sort of one big trend that we saw. And I think that got sort of cultivated even more when Vitalik posited his roll up centric roadmap for Ethereum. And then at the same time, you had all these more monolithic l one s, which are very interesting in their own right, and have strong engineers behind them, etcetera, like Solana, which was also being pitched back then. What was just noticeable on the lazy ledger side is that they took this very radically different view. Right? Like all these monolithic algorithms want to do as much as they could on one layer. And here you had these three guys who were like, okay, we're going to do as little as we can, which is in the name lazy ledger on one layer and just specialize in that one thing, right? And if you look at, like, a very high level that fits with how we see, like, economics develop, where you specialize in one thing, do it extremely well, and thus be more efficient. And I think that's like very high level, the modular blockchain thesis.
00:19:22.354 - 00:20:00.138, Speaker D: Yeah, I fully agree. And I think to add to that is I think it's also been somewhat. Oh, it's definitely been ingrained in the thesis and as an investor is that we do think decentralization is extremely important. Right. So I think also back then, 2018 to 19, indeed, you saw layers, or layer one, sacrificing decentralization to a certain extent and, you know, improve the, or boost up the hardware requirements and then sort of, yeah. Spitting out blocks, like you just said, and being a little bit more centralized, which I think is fine for a lot of use cases that will work extremely well. And I think at that time, we all said, well, we think that you need to ultimately completely trust and be a first class citizen, as Celestia calls it, so you can verify the blockchain yourself.
00:20:00.138 - 00:20:06.654, Speaker D: So that's definitely very important in the Celestia and I think just generally high over the modular ecosystem.
00:20:07.194 - 00:20:30.464, Speaker A: Yeah. And just for the noobs out there, when they hear about modular blockchains, you can't talk about modular blockchains without talking about data availability. But a lot of folks out there might not be familiar with what this concept is and why it's such a big, big market to solve for. So can you guys walk us through just what exactly is data availability? And how does lazy ledger, or currently known as Celestia, fit into that?
00:20:31.484 - 00:21:14.806, Speaker E: Yeah. So data availability, I think maybe the theorem in hindsight was poorly chosen, but what it means is that you ensure that all the data that's in a blog has been made available, right? So that there's not like a part of a blog that has been kept away from the rest of the network. How you typically solve this is that you let every node in the network download every block in full, and they just verify it entirely. Right. If I download the whole thing, I know it was all available because I can download it. The downside to that is that there's quite a high resource constraint, unlike the nodes, because they do need to download the entire blog, which is also where the whole block size debate in bitcoin originally comes from. Right.
00:21:14.806 - 00:21:54.078, Speaker E: Do we increase the blocks and thus scaling, but at the cost of making it more expensive to run a node for the average user? And I think the bitcoin core developers are very much like, everybody should be able to run a full node, unlike a home laptop, almost and the Ethereum folks are in the same camp, whereas I think maybe Solana makes a trade of like, hey, running a full node, it can be a bit more expensive, right? It's fine to ask for more requirements there. That's like data availability in a nutshell. Just ensuring that the data of a block has been made available to the entire network, not to be confused with will it also be stored forever? Which is more like data retrievability, I.
00:21:54.086 - 00:22:06.406, Speaker A: Guess, for lazy ledger. What exactly celestial, we should probably call them by the current name. But what exactly do they do? How do they make data availability more available? I guess. Yeah.
00:22:06.430 - 00:22:34.014, Speaker E: So they do that by introducing something called data availability sampling. This was introduced by Vitalik Mustve and another guy, which I cant remember his name right now. Sorry for that. But in a paper back in 2018, they use a technique called eraser coding. This has been around for a while. I think they use it on CDs to recover data. But what you do there is you push out more data, but you fragment it in a certain way.
00:22:34.014 - 00:23:18.006, Speaker E: And by sharing these fragments, you allow a group of people to be able to recover the full block of data. So what that means in practice is that no longer does every lite client or node need to download the entire block, but they just download samples of a block. And in doing so, they assure that the entire block was made available. And this sort of surpasses the earlier issue we saw, right. If you increase the block size, everybody needs to download more data because they need to download the entire block. Well, now they can just download a subset of the block, let's say 10%, right, just making up this number. But in downloading just the 10%, you can verify that the whole block was available with like a 99.9%
00:23:18.006 - 00:23:35.414, Speaker E: certainty. I think that's like the unique innovation that's at. Yeah, sort of the base layer or the basis of the whole celestia, or modular thesis. And we're also seeing ethereum move in this direction. Right, with. They also want to implement data availability sampling.
00:23:36.394 - 00:23:48.494, Speaker A: Is it safe to say that I guess the core thesis for Celestia and the modular blockchain thesis is basically making it much, much cheaper for people to create and run their own chains or their own roll ups.
00:23:49.474 - 00:24:18.304, Speaker E: Yeah, and maybe also for end users to verify them? I think that's like the core thesis. And also, if you ask me, like, how do you want to make the bear case for the whole modular blockchain thesis? That would be like, users don't want to verify the chain, but I think that's what they essentially do. They make it easier for end users to verify the blockchain. I mean, I can do it on my mobile phone, right? I can't run a bitcoin. Well maybe I can, but I can't run a bitcoin, fool, not on my mobile phone that easily.
00:24:18.964 - 00:24:55.092, Speaker D: Back to your first one, right? I mean, obviously Ethereum has been moving modular to a certain extent already over the last couple of years. Matthias alluded to the paper written by Vitalik. And today we have a couple of bigger generalized roll ups which can facilitate a lot of use cases. We see open finance, define NFT use cases on these rollups. And I think our view is that slowly we also start to see more app specific roll ups. Where I'm a developer, I want to use my own customized virtual machine, potentially. I want to build my own community, have a token which I can freely trade with, which is less bound to the rules of the underlying layer.
00:24:55.092 - 00:25:00.290, Speaker D: And I think Celestia allows for that a lot more than other current solutions out there.
00:25:00.362 - 00:25:42.464, Speaker A: Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to get to. I think this is the most interesting part of the discussion, because it seems like in order for your thesis around data availability becoming a large enough market to take off, you really need there to be a lot of roll ups. And I know we kind of had this debate before in our group chats back and forth, and we kind of see recently that with DYDX, they're trying to become their own chain. Frax is trying to become their own layer too. So we are already seeing some app chains and kind of roll ups that are app specific starting up. But do you foresee a feature where we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of rollups, where every single application is its own roll up? Or is this going to be thematic roll ups where you have a defi only roll up, gaming only roll up? What does that future look like for you guys?
00:25:43.204 - 00:26:27.204, Speaker D: Yeah, this is obviously a big question when we discuss this a lot internally. And I would say that I think at this stage, not even one answer. Right. I think the first instance, what we're seeing today is that generalized setup, which makes a lot of sense. So yeah, people are looking for higher throughput, lower fees, and moving away to these L2 ecosystems. And I think in due time, when this ecosystem starts to mature, there will be better solutions for developers to build their own roll ups, right? I think, well, already today we see a lot of ropes as a service starting to come to the market. I think these types of solutions will build great SDKs for developers to start deploying their own ropes.
00:26:27.204 - 00:27:04.130, Speaker D: I think deploying rope will be very easy in the future for any developer. So you don't have to be a rop expert. I think that's going to be extremely important. And you can start thinking about, okay, I'm a game developer and I'm just going to focus on in game items, the economy of my own game, so I can move from web two to web3 and I can start building my own ecosystem without being an expert on all these types of different semantic differences in all this in the role space today. So I think that's what we're slowly moving towards to. I think it's going to be very hard to say if it's going to be thousands or ten, thousands or hundreds. I think there will be more and more use cases.
00:27:04.130 - 00:27:18.694, Speaker D: Social media will eventually come on chain, so there's going to be a lot of future use cases will start to tap into that market and a lot more than what we're seeing today. I think we're just at the first innings of more app specific gen thesis and domain.
00:27:19.074 - 00:27:36.254, Speaker A: Is this effectively the anti Solana anti aptos? Actually, I don't know enough about aptos to say that. But is it effectively anti Solana thesis where instead of having all the developers build on the same chain and building interoperable apps, you expect developers to also build their own infrastructure as well in the future?
00:27:36.854 - 00:28:10.926, Speaker E: Yeah, in part it is. I would definitely say so. Right. Solana is definitely on the monolithic side, and I think that's very counter to the modular side, although I think Solana is also making efforts with like their diet clients, I think they're called, which would also be like verifying light clients, etcetera. So they are starting from very different directions. I do see them moving a little bit more into the same area. I think one part that on the previous point is also very interesting is that DyDX is starting an appchain fracs, and we've seen a few more announce it.
00:28:10.926 - 00:28:43.068, Speaker E: Right. Compound did it back in the day. I don't think they followed up with it. The projects we now name have like a large community, a certain economic sort of basis, and they can build an app chain. But what Celestia allows for is that everybody can spin up an app chain or an app roll up very easily. So it will allow for way more experimentation by just a developer who doesn't have like 100 million war chest and a big protocol running with a good product on top of it to just try out new things. And I think that's what's actually interesting, right.
00:28:43.068 - 00:28:54.460, Speaker E: That's what we're also very keen to see happening. So just build whatever you want. You can enter on the same basis as a lot of other rollups and see if you build a good product.
00:28:54.652 - 00:29:25.304, Speaker A: And just to kind of play devil's advocate here, so think of a rush principles. As a developer, if I want to build like a game, for instance, I probably don't want to be thinking about what the roll up infrastructure is, or I don't want to verticalize the stack. I just want to build the game. And especially in web3, I probably want my game to talk to other games as well. So I think those two reasons seem to suggest that I should be building on a layer one or some generalized large L2, instead of trying to build my own roll up. What are you going to think about that?
00:29:25.804 - 00:30:24.604, Speaker E: Yeah, I would say there will probably be a generalized gaming roll up, right? And that can be just as scalable as an l one. So you can either start deploying there and I imagine, but this is still a little bit into the future, that there will be also templates to spin up your own roll up, so you can be like, hey, I know this game, they have a good infrastructure setup. Oh, I'll just deploy using the same op stack or whatnot as they did, and deploy my own chain and don't need to worry about like these infrastructure design choices just yet. The benefit that you get from that is that you can introduce your own monetary or economics of the roll up, etcetera. So that's definitely sort of upside that you instantly enable. But if you were to build a game right now, yeah, I mean, Celestia still needs to launch its mainnet, so right now we'd probably say like, okay, do go and try out maybe arbitrum, optimism and whatnot.
00:30:25.184 - 00:31:08.870, Speaker D: Yeah, and I think also that's for, well, I think sort of the current web3 ecosystem, right, if you will, and I. But I think, you know, there's a lot of bigger companies out there looking at the space in the social media domain, in the gaming domain, they've been building web two. They're potentially looking where are we going to be building? And then I think they could start to spin up their own generalized role upright build their own ecosystem. They could even partner with others in the space to build, to build a more generalized role. So I think we'll start seeing indeed sort of more generalized robots, aim specific at certain use cases. And from there on we probably start to fan out as companies and people and developers start to decide, I want to build my own ecosystem and not be part per se part of this ecosystem, build my own economic monetary units.
00:31:08.902 - 00:32:03.304, Speaker A: Indeed, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, if you are a big company or big gaming studio and you have the resources to bootstrap your own kind of ecosystem, why would you want to give away that value to like another infrastructure company, right? And I think that leads us to another type of company which I know we've talked about before, which is rollup as a service. So I think in the past six months or so I've seen, I've been pitched by five of these companies which are effectively creating platforms for people to launch roll ups, right? So creating a service that lets you deploy a roll up in like three clicks, for instance. So I've been pretty skeptical of that business model because I personally find it hard to imagine there will be enough number of rollups being deployed to make these kind of sustainable businesses, or at least provide like 100 x type of growth potential. I'm curious what you guys take on rollup as a service type of companies are, given that you guys are very bullish on the modular blockchain thesis.
00:32:04.204 - 00:33:08.404, Speaker D: Yeah, no, so I think when we started looking at this domain, we thought it was extremely interesting and obviously fits indeed completely into the modular features. Obviously if we back at the a layer, then if you start to think in layers, then obviously we need to make it sure that it's easy for developers to start deploying their own ecosystem via the role best of service. I think the counter argument you're alluding to is obviously what's the value accrual here? Because I think a lot of the power in the future, that's how we see it, will be with the applications as they have the users, so they are able to subtract fees, and if the role becomes too expensive, they might fork away, go to another ecosystem and they might even go with a couple of applications together to build our own ecosystem. So you could argue that the value accruals is still an unknown, and that's also how we have looked at this space. I think we acknowledge that there's still a lot of experimentation around the value accrual rops as a service. At the same time, we do think it's important. So I think we need these SDKs and ways for developers to start building web free solutions, especially according to our modular thesis.
00:33:08.404 - 00:33:28.814, Speaker D: So we do think that some of these have potential to become quite sizable in size and will deploy a lot of robs over time on different DA layers, it could be Celestia, Avil, or even Ethereum. So I think making that customizable, I think, is going to be extremely important going forward. But you could argue that the use case today are still somewhat limited.
00:33:29.474 - 00:33:31.614, Speaker A: Amethyst, anything you'd add there as well?
00:33:32.554 - 00:34:04.896, Speaker E: No, I do think you also made the bookcase for these companies yourself, right? That as maybe a gaming developer, you don't want to worry about all infrastructure. I think that's exactly the issues that these companies are setting out to solve. At the same time, I'm also not entirely sure how they're going to differentiate. Maybe they're going to focus on one vertical and just build that company specifically for that. That's something I could definitely see happen, but I do think it's good that they're all starting and looking into that domain. Which adds also quite early.
00:34:05.040 - 00:34:28.836, Speaker A: Yeah, I think actually, if anything, I feel like for generalized data availability infrastructure project like Celestia, they should be building a roll up as a service arm as well. And every roll up that's deployed with that uses Celestia as the underlying. So it seemed to me more like a feature for a protocol like Celestia rather than like a standalone company. So that's why I've been kind of skeptical of that business model. But I can also hear the argument for it as well.
00:34:28.960 - 00:35:07.524, Speaker E: I mean, Celestia does have the rolekit team in house, right? They're doing sort of a framework for roll up deployments. I think they got the most attention with their roll ups on bitcoin, which was interesting as sort of a concept, or meme. Maybe at the same time, you could argue Celestia should not focus on doing this because they want to remain incredibly neutral. Right. Sort of the core mission of the project should just be selling valuable block space, and that's what the protocol is all about. And make as little sort of core developer decisions as possible to be used by everybody. So maybe at some point it does make sense.
00:35:07.524 - 00:35:15.224, Speaker E: Yeah, I would probably take the other side of that, that it doesn't make sense for them to build it in house, but more have that all external and be as neutral as possible.
00:35:16.324 - 00:35:38.754, Speaker A: Slight segue here. What do you guys think of development on bitcoin? Have you guys minted any ordinals yet? Because personally, as a quote unquote web3 guy, I've been really skeptical that there will be anything interesting built on bitcoin. And then I think the slight exception is we're seeing something really interesting on stacks. But besides that, it seems like all of the developers we talk to are only interested in Ethereum or roll ups and so on. What do you guys think here?
00:35:39.294 - 00:36:25.524, Speaker D: This is always somewhat of a tricky one, right? But high over, I think if you look at where we are investing and where we are talking to founders is generally definitely in the Ethereum and cosmos ecosystem. We follow the bitcoin ecosystem. We think it's interesting. I haven't personally or on the company level been minting any ordinals. I think there's a lot of speculation in there, which is fine, which is also part of the deal sometimes. I think at this stage, I would say it's early still for any form of development here to really start to mature and for users to come to these markets at larger scale and use these types of nfts or other solutions out there. Stacks is definitely obviously an ecosystem which is starting to aim at a more defined open finance angle.
00:36:25.524 - 00:37:04.084, Speaker D: But also, I think for that ecosystem, it's still really, and there's a lot more applications that need to be developed for, I think, a lot of users to come over and start using it, besides the UI UX problem, which is also still there. So I think that's, if you look at the whole space today, I think our view is that obviously the UI UX problem is one of the biggest problems. Why? Adoption across the board is somewhat slow sometimes. I think there's a lot of great improvement currently in play to make that a lot better. And I hope we're going to be seeing a lot of improvements coming, period. Which will make it a lot easier to start onboarding the next couple million users instead of what we have today in the ecosystem.
00:37:04.784 - 00:37:45.374, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess. Speaking of the next couple million users, I guess we have to zoom out a lot. For investors who are looking out for many years, they want to invest in the future of crypto, it seems like it's getting more and more sophisticated. Whereas before, in 2017, everybody was pitching the world computer vision, just one layer to capture everything, now you have the modular blockchain thesis, which separating every part of the blockchain into its own thing. You have data availability, you have execution, settlement, and so on and so on. So for investors who are looking to capture the most value in the crypto economy in the future, which layer of the stack do you think makes the most sense to focus on? Or is that even a good question to be thinking of?
00:37:45.954 - 00:38:23.714, Speaker E: Yeah, this is, I think, one of the questions we think about a lot internally and also debate heavily. So happy to hear any pushback here. My current thinking is that there are sort of three areas of the stack where the most valuable accrue. And in general I would say it's usually the areas that are the least forkable. The first obvious example, I think almost any investor will agree, is the app layer. People come for the application, not for necessarily the underlying infrastructure. I think applications can generally leverage quite some fees, thus cash flow and be an interesting investment.
00:38:23.714 - 00:39:28.394, Speaker E: The second area is maybe a little bit more boring is the asset controllers. I think two of the most profitable companies in our space right now are tether and circle because they just hold all these dollars that are issued and used on chain and you can't really that easily fork them away from a bank account, right? They're just sitting there in bonds, dollars, etcetera, earning a yield. And then the third layer, which is maybe the most interesting in the modular thesis, is like the layer where the actual nodes are, or the lite lines in the case of any data availability sampling. But I see that as being the most sort of valuable, not as for like one application, one app might pay a small amount for DA, but the sum of all applications living on top of that layer I think will be where most valuable accrue. The obvious boost make that you hear today is obviously, hey, block space is abundant. I would argue that the quality of block space also matters a lot. I can create a lot of block space on my laptop right now, spin up a local blockchain and we will have abundant block space with the two of us.
00:39:28.394 - 00:39:54.542, Speaker E: But I don't think anybody will care or pay to use it because it's not decentralized, it's not verifiable by anybody, and there's not a lot of stuff to do on it. So I think when we talk about abundant block space, it matters how you can verify it, what the liquidity is on top of it, what MeV can you capture with the block space? So there are definitely some trends there, but that's like my general thinking on this topic. But as I said, it does evolve over time.
00:39:54.598 - 00:40:35.024, Speaker D: Right, and that's a very good point by the way, indeed. And I think our backdrop thesis here is definitely by unlocking the block space like we're seeing happening with these data availability layers today, it's going to be extremely cheap to use these data availability layers and that will should allow for a lot more and better use cases going forward. So yeah, we should see a lot more usability and usage at the application layer. I think that's sort of the backdrop feature. So with the current ecosystem, obviously there will be definitely be an abundance of blockchain space, which I think is good for the space overall. But we definitely expect to see a lot more adoption on the back of these technological developments.
00:40:35.404 - 00:41:26.144, Speaker A: Yeah. And I really appreciate that framework. I think, I really enjoy thinking from first principles about, okay, what are the layers that are hardest to fork? What are the values that are hardest to take away? And it's quite interesting that some of this value, some of this moat, sometimes comes from the centralized aspect of these layers in terms of having users that might not necessarily be related to the technology of the blockchain itself. So I think, honestly, now is probably one of the most difficult times to be a vc in crypto just because of so many competing visions of the world that each seem to have their own credible arguments. First, as in 2017, everybody was in the world computer hype dream. So I think this episode will look back on this as one of the most interesting kind of frameworks about how to think about blockchain development. So I really appreciate you guys for coming on.
00:41:26.144 - 00:41:32.536, Speaker A: Now, for people who want to follow you guys follow Maven eleven or see what you guys are up to, what are the best channels for them to do this?
00:41:32.680 - 00:41:55.274, Speaker E: Yeah, Twitter and our research substack, we publish quite a lot of research also with like these thesis on modular blockchains. And then as any crypto VC, we're active on Twitter. Right. It's mandatory.
