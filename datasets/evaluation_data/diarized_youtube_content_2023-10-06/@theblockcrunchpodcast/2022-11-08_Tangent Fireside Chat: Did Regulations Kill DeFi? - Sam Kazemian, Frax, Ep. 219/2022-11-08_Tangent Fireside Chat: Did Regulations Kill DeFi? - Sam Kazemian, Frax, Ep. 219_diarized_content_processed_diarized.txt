00:00:46.286 - 00:01:32.090, Speaker C: That's why I decided to create blockchains vip to share with you all the heavy research that goes on behind the scenes. Now, every week or so, our team prepares an in depth research memo with things like sector analysis, technical concepts made simple, in depth competitor breakdown, and even interactive models so you can learn about the most important projects before they become important. And our team is putting in hours every week, scouring discord, twitter, forums and blogs to help you get an edge in crypto and understand the latest projects and themes at the deepest levels. That goes way beyond just an interview. Now, in addition, we'll also host exclusive AMA's with myself to answer any of your questions. So all of these are only available to blockchain's vip subscribers. And the good news is that while our interviews will always be free, the VIP tier costs less than one coffee a day.

00:01:38.834 - 00:02:12.934, Speaker A: Alright, hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, this week we have a very, very special episode, another episode in the Tangent Fireside series. Now today I have with me my partner at Tangentaro and also one of our mentors, Sam, the legendary Sam from Frax himself. So today we're going to talk a lot about what's happening in DeFi, what's going on with fracs, what's happening with Tangent, and it's just going to be a wide ranging topic on everything we're excited about, maybe things we're concerned about. So really high time for something like this. So Sam, thank you so much for taking the time to join us, man.
00:02:13.594 - 00:02:16.254, Speaker D: Yeah, it's always a pleasure. Thanks for having me on, Jason.
00:02:17.194 - 00:02:55.884, Speaker A: Yeah. So why don't we get started by just getting the elephant in the room because I think before we started recording, we were talking about all these three four letter agencies like ofaccessible and SEC and CFTC sanctioning tornado cash coming after, ethereum going after, and then projects overreacting and maybe not overreacting. There's basically just a lot of FUD from the regulation side for DeFi. I'm curious for you, Sam, how are you thinking about this new landscape for Defi? Obviously, I know Darrow's personally super excited about Defi and stablecoin thesis as well. So I am curious what your thoughts are there, too.
00:02:57.164 - 00:03:43.892, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. So, to be honest, I kind of seen this before with, you know, this isn't my first rodeo or bear market and stuff. So if you. For people that recalled after the ICO mania and ICO stuff in 2017 to 18, there was like a really prolonged bear market, protracted bear market, where there was like a bunch of, you know, SEC settlements or SEC lawsuits and things like that. And it's kind of when the ripple thing got started, which is still playing out in us courts, there's like the huge eos or block one settlement, all of these big things. And it always strikes when people are kind of most disillusioned and things like that. Whenever things are like fine, everyone's making a bunch of money and things like that, they don't seem to really notice.
00:03:43.892 - 00:05:19.530, Speaker D: But in any case, I think it's really just the kind of natural course of events. But we just have to be really active and kind of really self aware about where things are going. So one of the things I always keep track on because my work at Frax is directly involved in stablecoins, is what is going to happen with stablecoin regulation, both in the US and outside? Is there going to be any kind of regulation that changes the landscape for on chain stablecoins itself for Fracs and DAI and things like that? Or is it going to be fine? In fact, I'm personally super pro disclosure based regulation. So regulation that doesn't ban anything outright doesn't say this is not allowed, or things like that, which hurts innovation, but disclosure regulation that says you need to disclose your reserves in x, y and z and do it in this and that way. Because I personally think on chain stable coins like Frax and DAi automatically always basically meet those disclosure requirements. I mean, maybe you have to build a front end to structure the reserves or something in a specific way, or make it like a balance sheet or whatever, but fracs and DAi, there's everything on chain, there's zero things off chain, right? And so every literally 10 seconds or whenever there's a block, there's technically an attestation of the entire reserves of the protocol and you could display it in real time. So I'm personally fine in this bear market.
00:05:19.530 - 00:05:54.936, Speaker D: I'm just keeping an eye regularly on things. Frax is a lot of things that we're shipping. Recently we pushed out Frax lend, our first initial pairs for lending. So that's really awesome. We have fracs ether coming, which is our liquid staking derivative, which is similar to kind of leidos steeth, but it has some fundamental differences and properties there. And it's going to be really good because it finally allows us to back parts of the fracs dollar stablecoin with this kind of liquid staking derivative that basically is backed fully by staked ether. Yeah.
00:05:54.960 - 00:06:15.184, Speaker E: And I guess touching on what jason sit on increased regulation, we're seeing some Defi founders get a bit shaken and a bit scared, especially the younger based ones in the US, not knowing what to do when facing significant career risk. What advice do you have to prospective Defi founders today looking to join the space and for existing Defi founders, wondering if it's worth doubling down on what they're doing?
00:06:16.684 - 00:06:56.244, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, well, it's a good question. I think usually people that are just starting usually get scared by this stuff the most. But I actually think that it's a great time right now to get started. And to be honest, this might sound counterintuitive, but people that are just starting should actually feel the least scared because at least, you know, there's a bunch of other stuff happening and they don't care about you at all. Like, right. If you're starting like a project that's small, it doesn't have a lot of TVL or anything and stuff like that. It's not like a multibillion dollar stablecoin, multibillion dollar Dex or whatever.
00:06:56.244 - 00:08:01.660, Speaker D: Let's be real. They don't care about you, right? So you can actually get started, feel like it's fine because you could see exactly where they're going, like who they're going after and things like that. So I think that it's totally fine. And as weird as that sounds like, I think it's actually a good time to start building and taking decentralization seriously because we're seeing more and more like the stuff with the BZX, CFTC enforcement action, and things like that, where if there's any kind of decentralization, theater is actually the word that this SEC uses in parts of the US. Government, but any type of thing where this decentralization in name but there's a company behind it or there's some kind of active involvement and there's only like five people voting on all the governance and it's like all the core team and stuff. If there's any kind of those kinds of things, that fakeness will be seen and those kinds of actions will come against those protocols. Right.
00:08:01.660 - 00:08:52.250, Speaker D: And so. And maybe it's not even right to call them protocols if that's really how they work. Right? It's just. They're just projects of like a company or something. So I think it's good to take true, you know, decentralization, diffuse ownership and like community owned governed protocols seriously now because the actual enforcement and the knowledge of the regulators are actually pretty high, I think. I'm not hearing other people say this, but to be honest, they do understand a lot more of this stuff. Now if you read the CFTC's action against BZX and the OK DAo or whatever, the DAo that's for the project or whatever it's supposed to be, they bring in their thing.
00:08:52.250 - 00:09:20.964, Speaker D: They say the governor Alpha contract that was supposed to be executing it is just a bunch of team members voting with tokens. They know what that means whether you agree with the action or not. They actually have done a lot of their homework. I think it's good, but it's also requires a lot of us in the industry being vigilant and making sure that the right regulations are being passed and not overzillous regulations.
00:09:21.824 - 00:09:51.496, Speaker A: I think one of the challenging things to piggyback off of Daryl's question is that founders are not sure what they should do. Now on one hand, you see basically any of the big protocols or companies out there face some regulation risk. Even outside of crypto, with Uber launching or Airbnb launching, you face breaking some rules in order to become big. But at the same time, breaking securities regulations is a huge deal. Violating sanctions is a massive deal. So people are just really scared. They don't know what they can do.
00:09:51.496 - 00:10:19.774, Speaker A: And I think one of the advice that Julian from Ribbon provided on a previous episode was that founders just shouldn't do whatever they can take back. So if you issue a token publicly or do an ICO, that's something you can never take back. But short of that, everything they're trying to push forward on. I'm curious what you think about that. Is that the same philosophy you had as well? Like how should, should founders just like listen to everything that lawyers tell them or what kind of advice should they take with a grain of salt?
00:10:21.234 - 00:11:20.642, Speaker D: Well, I think that seems, that seems pretty reasonable. I think there's two distinctions, though, right? Like things like sanctions and OFAC are not something that you break and ask for forgiveness later. Like, that's something that's extremely important. And there's a reason why the industry is so, so much soul searching about how to either comply or where the line is for complying and things like that, for stuff that the SEC and securities related stuff. Again, this is not legal advice in any way, but the other day I was thinking about how Gary Gensler and the SEC essentially have all but came out and said we're only going to do regulation by enforcement. They basically all but said exactly that we're going to do regulation by enforcement that don't know what that is. It means like, there's never any, like, clarity or official policy given because the, you know, there's so much stuff you could clarify.
00:11:20.642 - 00:12:35.328, Speaker D: So the federal government basically says, we're only going to clarify the rules case by case once we go and try to enforce stuff against people. Right. And I was just thinking, and like, it kind of occurred to me that if you have the government actually admitting that that's how they do regulation, like, you know, at least securities regulation by default, they're actually telling you, do not ask for permission, ask for forgiveness later, even though in name they're like, well, come in and talk to us or whatever. But then you have Gary Gensler and all of these people saying that they're going to continue doing regulation by enforcement rather than do things by actually giving the green light and stuff like that. So then what else can you really do, right? So obviously I wish, and I really hope that there's clarity coming in terms of SEC CFTC when it actually applies to the SEC, when it's a commodity and goes to the CFTC, I think it will happen. But until then, it's kind of, it's kind of sucks. And it's in this limbo phase where no one really knows what's going on.
00:12:35.328 - 00:13:02.244, Speaker D: So obviously not legal advice in any way. I think that it's unfortunate, but I'm actually hopeful with some of the stuff that's going on through Congress in terms of the stablecoin regulation seems fairly reasonable and things that I've seen are going to be good once they actually get through and there's clear guidelines on how to behave and things like that. But until then, it's a little bit of a gray area.
00:13:05.044 - 00:13:48.894, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess, you know, it goes back to the mantra of moving fast and breaking things and then, you know, afterwards dealing with the consequences, if there are any, but sort of moving away from that. Now, if we look at DeFi in the last two to three years, Defi was the darling of 2020. Everyone knows of the 2020 Defi bull run. And in 2021, nfts really became popular. And, you know, we really saw a lot of retail mind shift, shift away from Defi to nfts. And in some sense, there was an amalgamation between nfts and DeFi where people were looking at NFT finance to some extent. What do you think needs to happen for focus to re censor back to Defi? And what do you think needs to excite the core Defi users of 2022?
00:13:50.314 - 00:15:12.900, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think, to be honest, everything is just taking a hit. So it's not even just like, defi. Like, when I look at the NFT volumes and stuff, I've seen stats from anywhere between, like, 80 to, like, 97% drops in NFT volume and, like, interest. So it's basically a bear market all around. But one thing I always say is there hasn't been a lot of zero to one innovation in Defi, right? Like, to be honest, like, I think the last, you know, big zero to one innovation was, like, uniswap and compounds lending and, like, yield farming with, like, comp and then with curve crv and things like that, right? Those are what kind of led to the exponential cambrian explosion of innovation, new projects and things like that. So that's why with fracs, the stuff we're trying to build internally in the fracs kind of stablecoin economy that we're slowly nurturing, is we're trying to think about what is the next big innovations in zero to one moments, rather than just incremental improvements of something or just slight betterment of something that's already out, or a quasi fork of something just on a different chain or something like that, trying to not do those kinds of things. And I think the more zero to one moments that people are building, the more likely that there's kind of going to be another cambrian explosion or, like, defi 2.0
00:15:12.900 - 00:15:22.704, Speaker D: or now it's 3.0. I don't even know which one we're on. But in order for there to be, like, a new resurgence, there's got to be some new zero to one moments. That's what I think.
00:15:24.004 - 00:16:11.944, Speaker A: I definitely agree with that. I mean, I think that's one of the initial ideas that we pitched to you when we were discussing tangent as well is like we're trying to find those zero to one things. And as Daryl mentioned, I think a lot of those things happened to occur in NFT land, I think for a period of time, for maybe like 612, when we kept on seeing a lot of new stuff happening in nfts. Like NFT lending, NFT options, new ways to tokenize nfts and trade perpetuals on them. And then at the same time, Defi seemed to be kind of moving slowly at that time. And a lot of the deals we were seeing were like Uniswap but on this new chain, or like Aave but on this new chain, or some moderately improved versions of existing projects, I guess. Like what are some things you want to see in DeFi or like maybe big opportunities or untapped spaces in DeFi that warrants more exploration?
00:16:13.204 - 00:17:13.452, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, they're all things that if we really want to see them, there are things that we're working on them at fracs. Like for example, FrACs is the first stable coin that's pegged to CPI, called the FPI, the FrACS price index, which I think next generation of stable coins that people will use at least more than before, is stuff like the FBI, that it's not a unit of account from a national government or something, not like dollars or euros or pounds, but something that actually keeps consistent purchasing power. So we're working on one of those. I think if that takes shape and continues to grow market share, that will be something that's huge. That'll totally change the game of the stablecoin space. Right now, stable coins are all dollar pegged that have like what, 96 7% of the entire market. There's small new experiments like Ohm with Olympus, Rai and like FPI.
00:17:13.452 - 00:18:36.014, Speaker D: And I think one of these things will hopefully break out. And actually it'll be their time rather than too early for the idea, right, that their time will eventually come. FPI is actually growing pretty well. It's like 60 70 million market cap and other kinds of things. I think basically the trend in DeFi that I see, that I always talk about is the Trinity, which means like all of the large blue chip projects, whether they know it or not, they're trending towards this trifecta of applications, which is stablecoin lending and liquidity. And what I mean by that is if you're a huge stablecoin, then you're going to try to capture a lot of the amm, liquidity and market and then the lending market, right? If you're a lending market, you're going to realize, why am I trying to source my lenders from stablecoin holders? Why don't I issue my own stablecoin? If you're an amm and you're huge, like curve or uniswap or something, you'll think, well, wait a minute, why don't I issue my own stablecoin and then later lending market? And then because I have all the liquidity, the oracles and things like that in my own Dex. And lo and behold, you've seen Aave recently announced their go stablecoin.
00:18:36.014 - 00:19:06.154, Speaker D: So they're lending and now they're issuing their own stablecoin. You've seen curve, the second biggest Dex. Talk about how CRV USD is imminent. It's their dollar pec, stable coin and fracs, which I'd like to think we came up with. The concept of the Trinity in DeFi is that we actually are the first project that has all three. So we have frac swap, and recently we launched Fraxland, which is our own internal lending market. And we've always had frax, the fractional dollar peck stablecoin.
00:19:06.154 - 00:19:41.334, Speaker D: So now we have all three, and the goal is to grow that stack together internally and so continue to expand market share in all three areas, because the more one side of the kind of triangle grows, the easier it is to capture the other side and the more profitable the whole thing becomes. It's all just like very synergistic. It'll be very cool to see CRV USD out, see how curve does it, and then see how aave launches go their stablecoin. So I think that's the trend in defi we're seeing, and it's going to be really interesting in the next three to six months, how that goes.
00:19:43.514 - 00:20:26.194, Speaker E: I think you've touched on a lot of excellent points there, and it really echoes along with my personal broad thesis on how the DeFi user experience can improve. But I do think right now the fragmented liquidity and UX across different protocols is hindering a lot of adoption. But moving on from that, the biggest event of 2022 in crypto was really Luna imploding. If you know, the many comparisons that have been made between fax and Luna, being that both you guys are probably the two most successful algorithmic under collateralized stablecoins, I know that there are quite a bit, quite a number of differences there, but this is a general categorization. So could you share a bit about the main lessons that you learned from seeing Luna unfold the way it did.
00:20:27.534 - 00:21:25.154, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I think there's some correct things about that and some kind of misunderstandings there. Like, Frax is basically named after being kind of a fractional reserve stablecoin. The name comes from fractional currency. And so we named it that exactly, because when we first came up with the idea in late 2019, before we built it and then launched version one in 2020, we thought that algorithmic stablecoins, meaning things that are just backed entirely by their own other token, like the basis design with shares and bonds, or just the signer it shares, pure design of just share token and the stablecoin, which is what Terra was, we thought that wouldn't work, otherwise we would have just launched something like that. Right. There's a reason we totally changed it. And our claim was like, this is never going to work.
00:21:25.154 - 00:22:03.064, Speaker D: It needs to look like fractional reserve banking. Not weird. In fact, one of the main things we said is, this is so weird. An algorithmic stablecoin is just basically like a bank with an empty balance sheet, because that doesn't make any sense. You can't issue a currency with no exogenous assets and a balance sheet, right? And so people mistake the fact that we actually, we're the earliest people to claim that stuff like basis, and Terra doesn't work. That's why we even named our stablecoin after fractional reserve banking. Right.
00:22:03.064 - 00:23:05.280, Speaker D: But the other thing that's important is that I like to highlight is I think Terra was actually trying to become more like frax in the last couple of weeks, the last month, with getting a lot of bitcoin, a lot of the l one assets, they were highlighting that they were starting to buy up and things like that. They were trying to actually be more like a fractional reserve bank, have fractional reserves and things like that, and they just unfortunately did not get there. They had 1015 percent of USD backed, which is just not anywhere that this enough fracs is around 93% backed by exogenous assets. It's backed by over collateralized loans, other stable coins. It's backed by protocol and liquidity on Dex curve, uniswap. It's not even in the same league of comparison to algorithmic stablecoins, to be honest. It's closer to dai or something.
00:23:05.280 - 00:23:41.156, Speaker D: Uh, it's actually closer to them in. In terms of them being over collateralized and us being almost 100% than it is to 1015 percent, uh, collateralized. Like, uh, usT. So, um, I think that's the only thing people usually, like, misunderstimate about, like fracs. And, uh, also, just to be honest, any stable coin. Like, I I remember, um, when, like, during the whole, you know, like, crazy weeks in, like, may and June, like, tether technically went from, like, 90 in a dollar to, like, $0.98 or $0.99
00:23:41.156 - 00:24:05.184, Speaker D: for a day or two or three or something. And people were, like, freaking out because they were like, oh, my God, it's like, it's going to DPEG and stuff. And what people forget is, like, even if there's, like, a genuine DPEG or, like, that, you know, tether has, like, some, like, commercial paper that's default, which would be really bad. Don't. Don't get me wrong. It would be really, really bad. Uh, it's.
00:24:05.184 - 00:24:42.864, Speaker D: It's going to depend to, like, 94, $0.96, right? $0.97. If. If everything goes wrong with fracs and we've never lost our peg, thankfully, we've had a perfect peg and stuff, it's going to depend to $0.93, like, the worst possible thing that there's other collateral that you could see on chain you can actually check. Right? These are not even close to being comparable to something that happened with USD, which was something of, like, cataclysmic, you know, proportion, right? Crazier stuff has happened in defi than, like, losing 4% of, like, your. Your holdings in a token or something, right? So don't get me wrong, those would be really bad.
00:24:42.864 - 00:25:03.334, Speaker D: And there's a reason why Frax says we take the pegs super seriously, and Frax has never de pegged, you know, tether. De pegging even three, $0.04 would be terrible. Right? But it's just not in the same league of even comparing to something going from, like, a dollar to, like, zero or, like, two cent or something in 72 hours. Right?
00:25:08.954 - 00:25:11.650, Speaker A: Hey, guys, I'm really excited to tell you more about one of my favorite.
00:25:11.682 - 00:25:15.130, Speaker B: Products in crypto right now, DyDx. This is a team I've known since.
00:25:15.162 - 00:25:16.826, Speaker A: 2018, and they've built one of the.
00:25:16.850 - 00:25:18.642, Speaker B: Best exchange venues out there that also.
00:25:18.698 - 00:25:21.250, Speaker A: Happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly.
00:25:21.362 - 00:25:56.264, Speaker B: Now, listen until the end, because there's an opportunity for savvy traders out there as well. And here are just a few reasons why I like DyDx over other exchanges. First, it's very liquid. It processes two to $3 billion every day in volume, and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording, which means you can trade things like Ethereum, bitcoin, doge Solana, and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today. Second, it's also extremely cheap. And if you're down bad from the bear market, you don't have to worry about gas fees at all because there is no gas fee fee on starkware L2, where DyDX is built on. Now that brings me to my next point as well.
00:25:56.264 - 00:26:34.944, Speaker B: It's incredibly fast. Unlike other L2 and high speed dexs, you don't actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore. And as an additional point, by using starkware, DYDX also provides users with increased security and privacy. And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature, which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so many different subaccounts. And their iOS mobile app is also live right now. And it's amazing because it's compatible with Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Coin 98, Huawei Wallet, and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there. And it's available for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today.
00:26:34.944 - 00:27:00.004, Speaker B: And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions, the most recent tier in the $10,000 equity tier, have won over $95,000 in rewards. And you can get started with as low as $500 in equity to compete for prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DyDX exchange to learn more. And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:27:01.824 - 00:27:36.936, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I agree with that. And you know, the painful part is that. So just for some context, we've spoken to the Luna team quite a few times before in my previous jobs, and we never really got the conviction invest because of the algorithmic design of the coin. What almost got me over the line was the fact that they started onboarding all these l one and BTC assets and really bolstering the balance sheet and thought, okay, that's more of a model that I can get behind. And then right after that, they kind of just imploded before they could implement that. But I'd like to explore the flip side of the argument.
00:27:37.120 - 00:27:51.494, Speaker D: Yeah, it kind of sucks, right? Like, it sounded good, right? It's like they figured it out, but they just didn't get to it enough time. It was just too far gone. Right, but it sounded good, right. Because that's the right way to do it. That's fractional reserve banking.
00:27:52.234 - 00:28:10.470, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'd love to explore the flip side of the argument, because obviously the algorithmic side, I think it's pretty much proven that it's not going to work. But at the same time, for the fractional side, there is an argument to be made that you could become too dependent on centralized assets. Like for maker, I think 50% of Dais backed by USDC. I don't know what that fraction is for fracs.
00:28:10.562 - 00:28:17.194, Speaker D: Oh, it's way over then. It's like, it's way more than that. It's like 83 84% of Dai that's backed by USDC.
00:28:19.094 - 00:28:31.514, Speaker A: Is that an issue? The fact that USDC is a pretty much decentralized assets issued by circle, is that going to impact, you think, the value proposition of these stable coins? And how do we solve for that?
00:28:33.334 - 00:29:53.414, Speaker D: Yeah, it's the stablecoin trilemma, if you've heard about that. I actually like talking about this because accurately, it explains what the issue is. So, like, the stablecoin trilemma comes from Vitalik's blockchain scaling trilemma, right, where he originally, he described in a blog post of like, there's like three things that every blockchain wants, but it seems like you can only pick two, which is like throughput, like, you know, scalability, decentralization, and basically security, right? And the issue is, if you want to have security, which means there's got to be a lot of. Basically, you know, if a block is actually coming in at the right time and it's finalized, right? And there's a lot of validators, then you can't have really high throughput, because then not everyone can run a node, right? And if you want to have really high throughput, then there's not a lot of nodes, right? There's a similar kind of thing with like stablecoins, which is like the stablecoin trilemma, which is, there's either, you either can have a really tight peg. That's one point of the triangle, like decentralized collateral or capital efficiency. It seems like there's only. You can pick two.
00:29:53.414 - 00:30:37.124, Speaker D: If you have decentralized collateral and basically you want to keep. You have capital efficiency and decentralized cloud, you can't have a tight peg, you suffer like USD does. If you want to have not decentralized collateral, you can have a tight peg and you can basically have some capital efficiency. The idea is no one's figured out how to solve the stablecoin trilemma. The issue is Dai and Frax are the two largest on chain stablecoins that are over a billion in supply fracs is about 1.5 billion. DAi has six or 7 billion, to be honest, they both have reserves of fiat coins.
00:30:37.124 - 00:31:24.050, Speaker D: It's hard. It's really difficult to figure out how to do this because the fully decentralized ones, the ones that basically, like LUsD, it's over collateralized with ETH only. And the issue is, it's not scalable. LUsd's market cap has dropped. It's basically barely 100 million, if that. If you add up all of these small micro cap stable coins that are truly fully decentralized, maybe like Rye, LUSD, these kinds of things, they collectively don't even add up to Frax's market cap, let alone dies. Right? So you can't actually scale this thing and it doesn't actually work as desired.
00:31:24.050 - 00:31:48.684, Speaker D: Right? So it's a problem. Right. No one's really come up with a solution. Maybe that's the next zero to one moment. There's some mechanism that can solve the stablecoin trilem. Who knows? I think we have some solutions to it. We're building basically an internal fracs economy with liquid staking derivatives that are basically interest bearing ETH.
00:31:48.684 - 00:32:03.084, Speaker D: They also help decentralize the validator set of the Ethereum network. They also allow us to do a lot of really interesting things of backing the dollar peg stablecoin with them. We'll see. But so far, no one really has an answer, to be honest.
00:32:04.034 - 00:32:39.526, Speaker A: Yeah, this is a call to teams out there. If you are someone who's figured out how to break this trilemma, you know where to reach us. All of us are on Twitter, so please dm us and we'll help you out. And I want to double click on something you brought on earlier, Sam, which is this point about fertilization. So obviously, Phrax is one of the first projects to build kind of multiple products within its own stack. But at the same time, I think what Darryl and I have seen is that a lot of DeFi projects eventually forego composability and want to build their own stack to capture as much value as possible as well. I think we saw this with one inch trying to build their own moody swap, and I think you mentioned a few examples just now.
00:32:39.526 - 00:32:58.474, Speaker A: I think Alpha finance before trying to do something similar as well. Do you think that is the end game for most DeFi applications? Everyone will just verticalize and become a full stack bank, and every application will eventually consist of the same parts and compete with each other. Or is there still a case for some sort of composability in the long term?
00:32:59.634 - 00:33:42.854, Speaker D: Well, no, I don't think the end result is that everything is going to look the same. I just think that there will be some consolidation. And the reason why I think the Trinity is a good concept is that I think that's where a lot of the consolidation will clearly go. These three things are, in my opinion, clearly the same thing. Stablecoin lending liquidity, even though they might appear to not be. Like, for example, no one says why is binance offering both spot trading and lending? And why do they have their own stablecoin? They just know it's a centralized exchange. So fine, it has its own stablecoin lending leverage and then spot trading.
00:33:42.854 - 00:34:54.186, Speaker D: But it's weird because amms and spot trading and on chain lending and stuff was hard to build using blockchain technology. So they kind of had this specialized first one to two years where they were separate and there difficult to build. And so people are like, why are you working on lending market? You have a stable coin? Or why is Amm issuing their own stable coins? No, they're the same thing. Unless you're going to go ask CZ, why doesn't he focus on only the spot market? Or why is FTX offering futures and lending, but also doing spots trading and stuff which no one does that conceptually. They've all compartmentalized it as a centralized exchange. The same thing is going to happen on chain, but not for everything, just for the Trinity, just for these kinds of applications, because they have strong network effects, they have strong consolidation value. When they actually go under the same protocol or stack or the same DaO, they actually have a lot of value that the entire value is greater than just the sum of all individual parts.
00:34:54.186 - 00:35:49.022, Speaker D: Now there are things that you can do that is, in my opinion, like a waste of time and kind of takes away from stuff. So like for example, we would never work on an NFT marketplace, right? Like that doesn't make sense for Frax, right? Frax is like a stable coin system that's powered by the Trinity. We wouldn't like build or think about doing like an OpenSea competitor or like a looksrare competitor. We wouldn't do like a launchpad thing or something, right? I think sushi tried to do that with like miso or, or whatever, right? Like those kinds of things have no synergy whatsoever. You have to think about what is the end vision that you're building and why you would devote resources and consolidation into a certain set of protocols and services, right? So I don't think everything will look the same. I think there's actually stuff you can do that'll take away from your limited resources. I think the Trinity is the same thing.
00:35:49.022 - 00:36:21.186, Speaker D: Those things, stable coins, lending and liquidity, those are, in my opinion, conceptually the same stack. It's the original defi stack, basically. I think, for example, the longer time goes on, the more and more any defi protocol that's in one of these edges of the triangle will go towards the other two edges. But there's stuff that is not in any way related. One thing that really confused me all the time was, why is Solana working on a phone?
00:36:21.290 - 00:36:21.506, Speaker A: Right.
00:36:21.530 - 00:36:38.934, Speaker D: Like, that was always kind of weird. Maybe it's so gigabrained that I don't even understand it. But like, that's like, clearly I don't get it right. I don't get it at all. But yeah, I think the trendy is 100%. In my opinion, something that's a single thing.
00:36:39.674 - 00:36:51.234, Speaker E: Okay. And, you know, I noticed as well that the collateralization ratio of fracs has been going up for the last couple of months. Do you want to comment on that? Has that been intentional or is that a function of just market forces moving?
00:36:52.014 - 00:37:42.180, Speaker D: Both. So there's obviously been governance discussions around it and changes, but also clearly during times where there's basically a bear market. And one thing I like to say about bear markets that I think has caught on and become a meme is a bear market is just a bull market for stable coins. Another way to say it is if everything's value is dropping against dollars, you need to give less dollars for the same thing. So basically, the purchasing power of the dollar is increasing. In these times, it's really difficult to hold a dollar peg because dollars are becoming more and more valuable. In order to hold a dollar peg and instill confidence and people to hold your stablecoin, you need to have more collateral.
00:37:42.180 - 00:38:28.056, Speaker D: So that just makes perfect sense. And that's part of the reason why frax has kept a perfect peg. If it worked the other way, if there was less collateralization, we would have been in trouble. I actually think the collateral ratio will probably approach around 100%. If there's a year or more of a bear market or in the coming months, I'm pretty sure that fracs will be fully backed in terms of entirely exogenous assets. One thing that's important to point out there is a lot of people say, okay, well then, so you're just basically die. What's, you know, what's the point of fracs if die was first? And, you know, now you're fully backed and they're fully backed.
00:38:28.056 - 00:39:05.236, Speaker D: But the difference is, actually fracs does different stability mechanisms. It would still be 100% collateralized, not 130 or 140. So it would still actually be the most capital efficient, the most elastic and scalable stablecoin. Just maybe not as much from like 92% Cr at 100% cr, but it's still different than DAi entirely from the products that it has the backing, the amos and the stability mechanisms, and also the capital efficiency. Right. Like 130% cr is still less capital efficient and less scalable than 100%. But, you know, 100% is definitely safer, that's for sure.
00:39:05.236 - 00:39:12.234, Speaker D: So that's a huge difference in terms of fracs, even if the collateral ratio goes up to 100%.
00:39:14.294 - 00:39:42.094, Speaker E: Got it, got it. And you know, touching on Dai is the biggest competitor. I mean, Dai has 7 billion in circulating supply and Fracs is 1.5 billion. Collectively, you guys make up about 10% of the decentralized stablecoin market share relative to centralized stablecoins. How do you imagine that's going to change going forward? What needs to happen for that to flip on its head off of fraxisat gaining significant market share against both DAi and centralized counterparties?
00:39:43.594 - 00:41:03.148, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a great question, because one of the things is I try not to really think about direct zero sum competition. One thing that I always say is I would love in the next couple of years for Dai to be at a trillion dollars of market cap and fracs to be at a trillion dollars of market cap rather than fracs. Be at 2 trillion and then die, perhaps like dying out or going to zero. And the reason I say that is the chance of 1 trillion die and 1 trillion fracs is a much better world if you strive for that than all or nothing fighting to get to 2 trillion and then kill off the other competition. Because the chance of something else happening, like both stable coins failing and then getting stable coins banned, or getting the industry disillusioned with, you know, on chain stable coins and stuff, is much higher if you're trying to basically compete zero sum in terms of that. But to the actual question of when I think fracs and Dai will grow faster than fiat coins and things like that, is that I think more economic activity have to come on chain. Right? Right now, the reason fiat coins are so huge is because all the real economic activity is, is off chain.
00:41:03.148 - 00:41:57.924, Speaker D: So sure, you can hold a lot of commercial paper treasuries and cash equivalents and things like that off chain and tokenize those things on the blockchain as fiat coins. If you want to actually have purely decentralized and entirely on chain stablecoins, you need on chain economic activity. If you want to have $1 trillion of issued decentralized stablecoins, you need at least more than 1 trillion of genuine digital economy economic activity. So those things can be tokenized, they can be loans, they can be over collateralized, there can be liquidity. And we don't have that. The entire market cap of the whole industry is like a trillion right now. We need a lot more things on chain in order for the actual on chain stablecoin market cap to grow faster than fiat coins.
00:41:57.924 - 00:42:18.864, Speaker D: And so far, it's still early. So I think in the next six to 18 months, I expect the on chain stable coins like Frax and Dai to grow a little bit faster or at least catch up to them in terms of some kind of market dominance category. But it's still early.
00:42:20.164 - 00:42:46.654, Speaker A: Yeah. And on that note, I think that's a great way to segue to the last question that we have for you today, Sam. So obviously, besides building fracs, you also do a little bit of angel investing to give back to the space and support new innovation in the space, I guess. What type of use cases, since we're on this point about having more on chain use cases, what type of use cases are you most excited by as an angel investor? And what would you want to see people build out that you think could be really beneficial for Defi?
00:42:48.754 - 00:43:32.336, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. And we've seen some really cool projects. Right, like you're saying, come in from tangent. And, you know, we've, we've tried to be as helpful and invest and for me, advise as much as possible. And I think there's actually two things. One is I'm really interested in the l two, and scaling roadmap for just like blockchains in general, and Ethereum, I think, for example, hardware companies that accelerate zero knowledge proofs, trying to actually be able to make those zero knowledge proof circuits, that computation more feasible. Those are something that I'm really interested in trying to find teams that are working on it.
00:43:32.336 - 00:44:04.214, Speaker D: So if that's you or people, I'd love to help in any way I can. And the other thing is, just in terms of defi, new innovative stability mechanisms for stable coins, new ways to do lending, and on chain liquidity, those kinds of things, I don't think it's over. Right. It's like, I don't think the innovation is over. It's really easy for people to be like, okay, uniswap figured it out in curve. Figured those are the only two ways you could automate liquidity, and then you can do range concentrate. I don't think that's it.
00:44:04.214 - 00:44:26.934, Speaker D: Every time someone says okay, the innovation stuff is over, we've all figured everything out. It's not. Someone else comes up with a zero to one moment. So I'm really looking for new stability mechanisms, new lending and liquidity stuff around the trinity, and zk proof acceleration. I think that's a huge area, definitely.
00:44:26.974 - 00:44:41.674, Speaker A: And we'll keep an eye out for those. So again, if you are building any of those things, feel free to reach out to us. You can reach out to Sam, as well as a final shout out to yourself and everything that you're building at fracs. What are the best channels for people to follow you and Frax?
00:44:42.424 - 00:45:07.220, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. I'm always available on Telegram and Twitter and same with the fracs community telegram and Twitter. So it's just amcasmian, just my full name and then racks finance. They're both the exact same on Telegram and Twitter. And I'm literally always on. So, you know, if I'm working, I have telegram open and with the with the community channel and you guys know. So yeah, join us.
