00:00:00.760 - 00:00:47.984, Speaker A: That's also why we have a bias towards the engineering team, because engineers tend to have a really good b's radar. If there's somebody who's bsing you, they can pretty quickly figure it out. And so having Curtis or Ken or Maria or Ren or Adam or any of our team on this call, very quickly, you ask a couple of questions of this person, who sort of may be able to articulate the way the world works, but won't actually be able to build it. And very quickly, in, like, five minutes, you can figure out if this person actually understands how to build it. And that doesn't necessarily mean they need to be the person literally writing the code, but they need to understand the tech stack deeply enough and who they need on the team to be able to build and deliver on this at a sufficient depth that they can convince those people to come join them.
