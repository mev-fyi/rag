00:00:02.040 - 00:00:44.878, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, gentlemen, welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto. And before we get started, just a reminder for you guys out there. The Blockcrunch podcast is intended for informational purposes only. Neither the host nor its guests or licensed financial advisors, and nothing discussed should be construed as financial advice. Views held by Blockcrench's guests are their own, and sponsorship messages do not constitute financial advice or endorsement. With that out of the way, let's jump right in. Today's episode of the Blockcardcast is brought to you by Protocol labs, the guys behind Filecoin.
00:00:44.878 - 00:00:53.114, Speaker A: And with me today is Colin Efren, who leads ecosystem at protocol labs. So, Colin, can you give us a brief state of the Filecoin ecosystem today?
00:00:53.454 - 00:01:31.154, Speaker B: So, Filecoin is almost 15 exabytes of storage capacity and 463 petabytes of real storage data. And if you take all of web3 storage protocols, Filecoin powers 99% of total storage capacity and 95% of storage utilization. In 2000, 270 thousand developers were exposed to filecoin through our various hackathon partnerships, and 500 startups are actively building on Filecoin, ranging from series seed funding to series D funding. In aggregate, they've raised about 500 million in capital and continue to grow into 2000.
00:01:31.534 - 00:02:10.588, Speaker A: Hello there. Now, before I move on, I'd love to thank the hundreds of you who have subscribed to Blockcrunch VIP, because with your support, I've been able to share my real thoughts on specific projects that I don't usually share on interviews in a format that I enjoy more, which is bi weekly written posts. We've also been able to offer exclusive AMA's, sharing my investment frameworks, interactable models, and breaking down important trends before they become big. Now, we even had Elon Musk comment on one of our threads recently. So if you haven't already, head on over to theblockcrench.com VIP and you can access dozens of hours of research for what you'd spend on a coffee a day. Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast.
00:02:10.588 - 00:03:11.790, Speaker A: Now, recently, a new phenomenon has reignited interest in bitcoin. Now, this is called ordinance, and these are effectively individual satoshis, or 100,000,000th of a bitcoin being assigned a number that's trackable on chain, which makes them quite similar to non fungible NFT collectibles. Now, this is done via a method called inscryption, which was not really possible before in bitcoin and we're going to dive into more of that in the episode now. So far, $1.2 million in fees have been spent to create these bitcoin nfts in their early days, which is still a small amount by bitcoin standards, but it's got a lot of people thinking, what else is possible? And is this the start of something bigger? Now, at the center of this discussion is a project called Stacks, which is a layer one blockchain that uses bitcoin for its security and working to expand the functionality of bitcoin so users can build things like nfts and more. So to talk all things ordinals, stacks and everything related to Tutu is once again Munib, the founder of Stacks on the show. So, Muneeb, I'm really, really excited to have you finally back on the show after so many years.
00:03:11.790 - 00:03:12.954, Speaker A: So welcome back.
00:03:13.254 - 00:03:18.194, Speaker B: Yeah, it's awesome to be back. I feel like a lot has changed in the industry since the last time we talked.
00:03:18.754 - 00:03:35.334, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. The last time I saw you in person was 2019. We were talking before we started recording, I think I was helping organize an event for you guys in Hong Kong, and since then, a lot has happened. There has been a slight rebrand from blockstack to stacks, but what else has happened in the past few years?
00:03:36.354 - 00:04:42.156, Speaker B: Yes, I think at the time that we met, we were sort of like doing community events around the world, and that was the time when the first SEC qualified offering was happening, which is kind of like a big deal that our project actually really tried hard doing things the compliant way and actually got a qualification from the SEC, which was like a really big deal. But my focus has mostly been on the technology. I'm a computer scientist by background, and we were sort of like doing the R and D for new, safer programming languages. What does a bitcoin layer looks like? So our thesis is that bitcoin L1 has a lot of really interesting properties, like decentralization, durability, and it's a very simple system, but it's also never really going to change. You don't expect bitcoin to change drastically, which is sort of like a property in a way, but it's hard to build on it. So can there be a separate bitcoin layer where people can move capital easily, they can actually program BTC, they can program different types of applications and so on. And that's what we were doing.
00:04:42.156 - 00:06:20.620, Speaker B: And fast forward to early 2021 is when the mainnet launched happened for the stacks layer. We saw a bunch of interests, a bunch of developers who came in, and I would say, frankly, towards the end of 2021, start of 2022, we sort of reached, in a way, the maximum capacity of the network stacks was really designed in a very decentralized way, that you can run a node on a raspberry PI just like you can run a bitcoin node. So the idea is, if bitcoin is very decentralized, and anyone should be able to run a node on a very minimal hardware anywhere around the planet with even slow network links, then the bitcoin layer that's working with it should also follow that. Looking back, I think what has been happening last year, 2022, is that there are major upgrades that the open source developers are working on, and they're mostly on the dimensions of high speeds. Can we bring much faster speeds to bitcoin layers instead of being limited by bitcoins like ten minute block times and more decentralized way of moving capital in and out of bitcoin L1 and the stacks layer, and I'm very carefully not calling it a bitcoin L two, and we can get into a little bit more that why the definitions matter, but the broader term is sort of like a bitcoin layer. One last thing is that given our focus on kind of like the SEC qualified offering back in the day, the project also focused on decentralization. A lot like, to an extreme extent, I would say that before the mainnet launch, a lot of the early people were working on the project.
00:06:20.620 - 00:06:50.160, Speaker B: They basically went off and did different things. There are like 30 plus entities in the ecosystem. I actually started a new company last year called Trust Machines. We raised $150 million round to build kind of like bitcoin applications, which uses this tax layer. But broadly we are focused on bitcoin applications. So that was also really nice to see that a true decentralization of the ecosystem, very natural, organic sort of growth. And then there is no big center of the project.
00:06:50.160 - 00:07:07.524, Speaker B: It's very organic, very decentralized, very independent entities working on it, which is, in a way, sometimes the overhead, as you can see, because these people need to learn how to work together on an open source project. But I do think long term it's a strength, because the thing is actually truly very, very decentralized.
00:07:08.464 - 00:07:43.644, Speaker A: Yeah, and I remember one of the few things that made us really excited to invest in sex back in the day was just how far thinking you guys were in a lot of these things. So one of those things was, I think, milestone based vesting, for instance. I don't think anyone else was doing that and then the other thing, as you mentioned, was becoming the first SEC approved token offering. Now with regulations top of mind, right? This month, Ganster has been talking a lot about stable coins and so on. Can you talk a little bit about the decision to go through that route when you first launched? Because I remember that was not a popular choice with other layer ones or L2s, because it is a lot of overhead.
00:07:44.184 - 00:08:34.116, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it comes a little bit from the DNA of the team. It's a bunch of computer scientists, mostly from Princeton, some from Stanford. And I think it's a little bit like the entire crypto industry, especially if you're in 2019. 2018 just feels like the Wild wide West. It still does, even today in 2023. I feel like just the DNA of the team was that they were really interested in the technology, but very scared of this wild west aspects of it. And we're researching that, what are the most compliant ways of doing this? Because we do believe if you look at just the SEC qualified offering, putting aside the overhead of the legal fees and everything, we had to figure out, because nobody has really done that before.
00:08:34.116 - 00:09:17.434, Speaker B: At the end of the day, it's really a really big disclosure, like a public disclosure that is very, very thorough. It is almost, I would say, at par at what companies do at an IPo. They have to disclose every single thing about the company. Who are the directors, who are the officers, what is their financial stake? What is any significant thing that people should know about what part is offering? And I think that level of transparency at disclosures is actually a good thing. Anyone in crypto would actually agree with that. Putting aside the overhead and legal fees, I don't think everyone can afford it. But at that time, the hope was really that more projects will be able to do this.
00:09:17.434 - 00:10:06.234, Speaker B: The legal cost and overhead would come down, and these disclosures would be very helpful. And I think a lot of regulators would agree that disclosures are helpful. What happened after that is we sort of really focused on decentralization. And the idea is that, yes, we built the initial technology, but independent miners launched it, and the early folks behind it sort of like, were broken apart and they went off and they're doing other things. It's a little bit like the creation is separate from the creators. Even when people ask me my connection to stacks, I say, I'm a co creator of stacks. I actually don't even use the term co founder because co creator implies that I helped create this thing, but now it has a life of its own.
00:10:06.234 - 00:10:59.918, Speaker B: I think that's actually the right mental model for decentralized protocols because ongoing control on decentralized protocols to me it just doesn't make sense. Then you're not decentralized, then you still have control. And I think like that's, that's the other thing that I do think because of the legal frameworks I would say we were actually more careful about these things. Well usually if you're a developer you're just focused on, you know, building your stuff and maybe you're not spending that much mental cycles on these aspects. But I do think that the qualified offering actually forced us to take a deeper look. There was a public memo by Wilson Sancini, which is a top law firm in the US that literally before the mainnet launch did a full legal analysis that here's what decentralization looks like, here's a legal framework for how to think about it. I think it's just going one step further on all of these things that is helpful.
00:10:59.918 - 00:11:32.474, Speaker B: But I must point out as a developer, sometimes I just want to build, it's a bunch of overhead as well. Imagine Linux, how many open source developers contribute to it. But it's not easy, there's overhead now because these people are employed by different, different companies, they have different motives, they might want to go in different directions. But overall long term I think on a five to ten year time scale I think it's a healthy thing that there is no kind of like single company that is responsible for the open source product.
00:11:33.774 - 00:12:19.534, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think it's crazy to me how expensive and how costly it is from a capital and also human resource perspective just to get all these legal approvals. So hopefully within the next year or few years or so we get some regulation clarity that allows other projects to, you know, go down similar routes. But before we kind of dive more into stacks, I love to talk about ordinals because that's just what a lot of people have been talking now. Now my understanding is ordinals weren't even the first quote unquote nfts on bitcoin because people were using the op return function to do different things just like colored coins and so on. And my knowledge is that stacks itself also has created nfts on top of bitcoin. So can you talk a little about, about why is ordnose making people so excited? Like what makes Ordonos different?
00:12:20.034 - 00:13:04.356, Speaker B: Yeah, happy to get into it and maybe I think going over the history a little bit would just help everybody. So my connection to this is I was doing my PhD back in the day in distributed systems. And in 2013, I discovered bitcoin. And it was an amazing time, right? Like, bitcoin was trading at like $80, but it was actually the technology. Like, how fascinating it was that I just started going, started learning about it, and the rapid hole just became deeper and deeper. And ten years later, literally, I'm still here. So between 2013 to 2017, me and my co founder, Ryan Shea, we were sort of like building on bitcoin L1.
00:13:04.356 - 00:13:29.572, Speaker B: We were building applications, we were building protocols. We built this domain name system type of thing, which is still alive today. It started in 2015 on bitcoin L1. And it is like one of the most. One of the oldest domain name systems that is still functional. You might have seen these dart BTC domain names on Twitter. That's where that comes from.
00:13:29.572 - 00:14:18.460, Speaker B: The stacks project started in 2017, where there was a collective realization in the bitcoin community and in the journal industry. I would say that the l ones are not going to scale, especially the bitcoin l ones, given how decent lies and how simple it is. So 2017 is when lightning started, where they focused on a peer to peer network for payments, and 2017 is when stack started. And the idea is that, hey, can we have full smart contracts, things like Ethereum can do as a bitcoin layer? And I think the protocols that you're mentioning. So the era between 2013 when I started to 2016 is actually very interesting. People who were around back then, the bitcoin community and the culture and the wide, was actually pretty different. A lot of the builders were there, experimentation would happen.
00:14:18.460 - 00:14:52.888, Speaker B: That's why counterparty started the first nfts, which was just amazing. And people sort of rediscovered that. A lot of people who came into nfts, they would initially think, and rightly so, because Ethereum is the dominant player that nfts started on Ethereum. And then people would be like, oh, there's a prehistory. Nfts actually started with counterparty on bitcoin L1, and that's where the rare Pepe's come from, that protocol. It's very hard to program bitcoin. There is a limited sort of a scripting language.
00:14:52.888 - 00:15:39.884, Speaker B: People who are used to building on Ethereum or Solana or other places think of it as you don't have a full vm, you don't have a full execution environment, you have very limited scripts. And counterparty was trying to do interesting things with those limited scripts, and that's how they started. We were actually doing literally similar things back in the day. We were building a domain name system with those limited scripts on bitcoin. Albond, so very familiar with the counterparty. And obviously counterparty never reached the mainstream adoption. And in some ways it could never have either, because on the DNS side, we saw that even getting into 100,000 registrations on bitcoin L1 was getting insanely expensive, insanely slow.
00:15:39.884 - 00:16:02.074, Speaker B: It wasn't scalable. Just to give an example, in 2017, the gas fees actually went up a lot as well at that time. And to register a dollar two domain name, you were paying anywhere between dollar 50 to dollar 100 in gas fees. People were basically like, look, this is not going to work. We are not even talking about doing millions of registrations yet. We're talking about 100,000 registrations. And so this is not going to work.
00:16:02.074 - 00:16:32.966, Speaker B: Layers and l two s and we will get into the technical definitions of that. That's the only way forward. That was the lesson. And then, interestingly, what happened. I think 2017 is a clear marker, because 2017 is when Ethereum really started taking off and people started building these other l one s. Like most of these projects, like Avalanche, Solana, they started around 2018 timeframe, because they could see that Ethereum is not scaling and there's an opportunity to build other stuff. And Ethereum L two started around that time.
00:16:32.966 - 00:17:20.970, Speaker B: But Ethereum gained the attention for a lot of the developer mindset. People who were intellectually curious, who wanted to play around with things, wanted to experiment. They actually started moving to ethereum and bitcoin culture. I noticed a visible shift. Instead of the developers and people who actually use the technology, it became more about this concept of bitcoin. High level discussions around economic aspects of bitcoin, almost like at some point a religious cult, right? And to me, like, as a builder, as an engineer, like, I can see the arguments, right? Like, I like bitcoin because of some of those arguments, but it's like, that's not interesting to me. I can't just keep talking about how the bitcoin supply is like 21 billion, never going to change.
00:17:20.970 - 00:17:58.890, Speaker B: We get it, right? It's about like, it's an open source project. So there is a. I'm not saying everyone became like that, but the crowd that was there for bitcoin, the technology and bitcoin, the tool, who wanted to use it, who wanted to do interesting things with it, became much smaller, relatively, right? And we kind of like, stuck around. I'll share a little instant here that I remember and sort of like, funny. Like, it really became a point where, you know, a lot of my Og friends from. From bitcoin back in the day who are now focused on other ecosystems. I'll go to a conference dinner.
00:17:58.890 - 00:18:22.982, Speaker B: I'll show up, and they will introduce me to the people. Like, hey, look, Muniv is here, the last standing developer. It was sort of funny, right? Like, they're making fun of me. They're like, man, what are like? He's like, they're like, what do you see? Why do you still kind of, like, work here? Like, you know, you could do anything. Like, given your experience, your background, you can go do anything you want. And I'm like, I believe in this. I actually do.
00:18:22.982 - 00:18:54.826, Speaker B: And sometimes you do feel lonely in your beliefs and so on. And it definitely became like a contrarian bet. And I think we sort of, like, we got some amazing investors. Like, the new company I started, trust machines. Like, it got funding. So we had a small group of, like, very motivated people who believed in this thing, which we call the bitcoin thesis, that eventually these successful applications would come to bitcoin and be built on top of bitcoin and be more valuable. It was a very long sort of history.
00:18:54.826 - 00:19:58.844, Speaker B: But now coming to your thing about ordinals, I think ordinals is the first data point, like a real, actual data point that sort of proves the thesis. I don't think it proves, like, all of the thesis, but it's the first real point where people are like, you know what? There's something there and you can see it. You can feel it, right? Like, when people started doing these bitcoin nfts, and we'll get into how they're done, how they're different. Like, instantly there was something that clicked with people, that a image that is stored on the bitcoin l one forever is more valuable, right? Because it is the same reason why BTC capital is valuable, because, you know, it's decentralized, durable, indestructible. It will be the last thing that goes down. That's the lowest risk thing in crypto. The same reason once an artist publishes something and has this feeling that this thing might live on even after I'm dead, because it is as indestructible as bitcoin itself, I think that feeling is magical.
00:19:58.844 - 00:20:22.000, Speaker B: There was a cultural shift that I'm very, very excited about because suddenly the conversations are different. Developers are coming back. A lot of people. I would be on Twitter spaces, and I've heard this story so many times. The general arc of it is, look, I got introduced to the industry through bitcoin. I love, kind of like the money aspect of it. I hold bitcoin.
00:20:22.000 - 00:20:51.160, Speaker B: I don't have anything to do with my bitcoin. They're just sitting in my cold storage. And I spend all of my day in Ethereum or Solana or somewhere else. I'm a builder. And finally I have something to do with bitcoin. So I'm very actually excited to come back and we'll hear this story over and over again. And the same sort of excitement that you might have experienced in other ecosystems where builders are shipping, they're staying up late nights, they can see sort of like market demand that is pulling products out of them.
00:20:51.160 - 00:21:12.830, Speaker B: That wasn't happening in bitcoin before. So once that starts happening, I think the excitement for developers and even investments kind of like start coming into the ecosystem and so on, and I couldn't be happy like this. Ardnals was like, literally the best thing that could have happened to bitcoin in the last, I would say five, six years at least, if not more.
00:21:13.022 - 00:21:37.798, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that's quite the strong statement. Right. The biggest thing to happen on bitcoin in the last five, six years. And what I think is particularly interesting is that my understanding is that ordonnose is almost like an unintended feature of taproot. Like people would not. The people who are behind Tabroot didn't really expect, you know, people to start creating NFT. So can you talk a little bit about how is ordnose and, and the origin story of that?
00:21:37.966 - 00:22:27.334, Speaker B: Yeah, I think maybe I can do a little bit of a technical overview as well that would help, help the people who are tuned in. So think of ordinals as it's sort of like there is this thing called ordinal theory. What is doing is that, as Jason was explaining that the smallest unit of bitcoin is a satoshi. So one bitcoin has like 100 million satoshi. And the ordinal theory is a theory. It's like a lens on look on looking at the same information that's stored on the blockchain to say, can we create certain sequences of satoshis? Are some satoshis more rare than the other ones? For example, the first satoshi that started right after that was minted right after a halving event. We know halving events are sort of important in bitcoin.
00:22:27.334 - 00:23:19.122, Speaker B: Maybe it has more value. It's a very rare satoshi that came out or some satoshi that, let's say, was minted in a particular block and or some numbers like, you know, there's people who are really into mathematics, they like certain numbers, right? They're more rare in occurrence. So ordinal theory is actually very intellectually interesting. If you just read it, it basically starts to sequence the satoshis, and then it basically says that if a satoshi is actually sort of unique because you can give it a number, then you could inscribe something on the blockchain using that satoshi. The inscription is done through a transaction, and it just attaches a large file with it. Then people are playing around with different files. Interestingly, some people are actually.
00:23:19.122 - 00:23:38.094, Speaker B: When they're saying these are ordinals, what they mean is that these are inscriptions. Because what they mean is that, hey, here's my NFT, which is an inscription on the bitcoin l one. But people are calling it ordinals. And I generally don't fight the terms that are taking off.
00:23:38.134 - 00:23:38.334, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:38.374 - 00:23:55.878, Speaker B: Like, if people think of them as ardnals, let them call it ordinals. Right, like that. That's fine. Technically, I think it's the inscription that they're talking about. And the reason why this is possible is because of tap proof. Right? So as you mentioned, so bitcoin hasn't had a lot of upgrades since the 2017. 2017 block size war.
00:23:55.878 - 00:24:27.874, Speaker B: I think when history books will be written, I do think there's a big chapter. There are already books on the block size wars of 2017. I think there would be chapters on how bitcoin culture changed forever. And a lot of these builders and innovators actually went to Ethereum in 2017. Since 2017, bitcoin has basically seen two upgrades, which, in the grand scheme of things, are pretty minor upgrades. They're not the type of stuff that happens on Ethereum or Solana. Maybe it's a good thing.
00:24:27.874 - 00:24:48.024, Speaker B: It takes a while to do upgrades. One was Segwit, which effectively, at a high level, just saves space. So you can actually send a transaction with reduced space, and it's more efficient. So cheaper for you. Great. Taproot is on the same access, same dimension. It saves space.
00:24:48.024 - 00:25:44.144, Speaker B: It basically hides certain complex scripts. You don't have to reveal them, so you put certain information on the chain, but you don't have to reveal the full script until it's needed. So it's more private until you reveal that aspects of the script. So what you can do is effectively get better privacy, more efficient use of the block space, and slightly advanced scripting. When Taproot was coming up, if you look at the marketing that was happening in bitcoin, I was puzzled that steproot was called smart contracts are here on bitcoin. Bitcoin defi is happening. There have been so many false starts to bitcoin defi that I'm sure you might have seen that sort of the rest of the industry might just shrug it off like, hey, I've heard this for the last five years, at least three different times, that bitcoin defi is happening, and it basically never happens.
00:25:44.144 - 00:26:15.364, Speaker B: I think there is some reality to it. Taproot is not fully expressive smart contracts. It's a slightly more advanced scripting language than bitcoin script. That's what it is. If you go to a developer that is used to building with the EVM or Solana or avalanche, they'd be like, what is this? I can't build anything complicated with it. It's too hard, too complicated and so on. But the interesting thing about taproot is it is on bitcoin l one.
00:26:15.364 - 00:26:48.936, Speaker B: I do think there are interesting things that could be done, and that's what the ordinals founder did. It was almost like a byproduct. He was working on ordinal theory and Taproot happened to give him this compressed way of actually storing more data on chain as almost like a byproduct of taproot. And if you look at taproot adoption, it was basically like a flat line, right? It went live with a lot of like fanfare. Nothing happened. And people who were close to it, like, we knew, we knew nothing was going to happen. Who's going to use this thing, right? Like, what's the use case? And then there has been a flat line for, let's say, over a year.
00:26:48.936 - 00:27:28.902, Speaker B: And with ordinals, it's literally like a graph that's going like this. It's exponential growth in taproot actually being used, which makes me so happy. There are literally wallets in the stacks ecosystem. So stacks ecosystem has a lot of real builders, people who are intellectually curious, good developers, have the startup ethic of working hard. They saw the ordinals opportunity and they jumped on it like they, some of the top like marketplaces, like gamma and others, they integrated easily, inscribing things, viewing ordinals. They're, I think, working on trading. Now the wallets jumped in with, here's an easy way to use a web wallet.
00:27:28.902 - 00:28:21.456, Speaker B: And these wallets now have to integrate taproot. These marketplaces have to integrate taproot addresses and so on. And I think seeing these NFTs drive the adoption of actual adoption of taproot. It's just magical that, look, here's a use case that people actually want, and so why are developers jumping on it? Why are they staying up all night? Because there's market demand, there's real demand that they're trying to serve and the users are pulling the products out of them. And that's why the taproot adoption is now actually happening. And I think if you look at bitcoin fees, it used to be one or two satoshis per VB for a while, and now the average, I think is now six, seven and sometimes ten. So Ardnals have resulted already in like a ten x base level, sort of six to ten x increase in bitcoin base fees.
00:28:21.456 - 00:29:06.756, Speaker B: And I think bitcoin long term security budget is probably one of the biggest criticisms that people outside of the bitcoin ecosystem would say that, hey, how are you going to pay for your security budget? I wouldn't be surprised if the fees do another ten x from here, because I think ardnals are just getting started. I don't think even 200,000 nfts have been inscribed. I don't think a lot of the bigger players, like bigger Ethereum marketplaces or artists, have really taken it seriously. They're hearing about it, they're getting curious right now. It's the early, early adopters that are jumping in. And I think if this really gives you a very efficient fee market, I think bitcoin block space is highly undervalued right now. Then suddenly bitcoin layers actually become self evident.
00:29:06.756 - 00:29:34.106, Speaker B: That thesis just writes itself. You don't even have to do anything about it. I think that's why we're seeing a bunch of interest. People are just putting two and two together. We are seeing a bunch of interest in bitcoin layers, like stacks, in applications that are built the way stacks is built, we'll get a little bit more into that. It has a very tight connection to bitcoin. So any transaction that happens on L1, the stacks layer can read it, the contracts can respond to it.
00:29:34.106 - 00:30:36.054, Speaker B: You can do atomic swaps with the BTCL1, and there are also other connections that we can get into. So developers actually see the value that if I have a more programmable layer, I can do interesting things with Ardnals, or I can do interesting things with trying to move BTC capital into the layer and building a real bitcoin defi ecosystem. And I think when that happens, the biggest work that's going on is this thing called SBTC in the stacks ecosystem, which is effectively moving BTC capital in a decentralized way in and out of the stacks layer in a fairly decentralized way. If that happens, I would say maybe that is an actual start to bitcoin defi. We've had a lot of false starts in the past, but that means that you have BTC capital in a fully executable environment. So anything you can do with EVM or Rust based VM, like Solana, you could actually now do it in the bitcoin ecosystem. I think that is something that has been missing for a very long time in bitcoin.
00:30:36.754 - 00:31:06.442, Speaker A: I think this is extremely exciting for bitcoin, but at the same time, I think initially, a lot of bitcoiners seem to be against ordinance or against inscriptions. And I think part of the argument is that, well, the bitcoin blockchain should only be used for sound money, and you guys are jacking up all the block space and hyping up other fees. Is that kind of the main contention with ordinals and inscriptions? And do you see a way to kind of maybe open up their minds to inscriptions, ordinance, or, you know, is there this kind of split in the community now?
00:31:06.618 - 00:31:29.110, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's a very, very interesting concept. Right. So I think some of the concern about block space is sort of real. Like, hey, look, we've always had problems with block space. We fought for smaller blocks. What's going on right now? So I'll revisit the actual block space argument. Why? I think it's actually not an issue, but it's a healthy thing.
00:31:29.110 - 00:32:22.644, Speaker B: But a bigger thing is, again, going back to that important year, 2017, where the block size wars happen and people wanted to change things in bitcoin, this sort of, like, went away. Innovators, folks who wanted to build this, sort of, like, slowly started going away. And the main kind of, like, opinions that are heard in the bitcoin community or that get amplified in podcasts or Twitter spaces or Twitter and so on, they're basically coming from non technical people. Most of these, like, minus, like, a handful who are actually technical. These are non technical people who came into bitcoin, actually, some of them very recently as well. They haven't experienced the early culture of bitcoin, and they view bitcoin as money. They look at everything else happening in the crypto industry as risky things that you should just stay away from.
00:32:22.644 - 00:32:54.514, Speaker B: So things like, quote unquote scam, the word has sort of lost its meaning at this point. Every single thing is a scam that is not bitcoin. That's literally the hard line definition. So what happened is because these things weren't happening on bitcoin for a while. The defi ecosystem, people are building things like Dai, they're taking loans out, they're playing around. And yes, some of the experiments are going to blow up, but some of them are going to be very successful and useful. That's how experimentation works.
00:32:54.514 - 00:33:19.690, Speaker B: That's the culture of tech in Silicon Valley and NFTs and so on. They were sort of like, imagine somebody who's like left out, who's on the other side of the fence, and there's nothing happening there. And they're sort of like just. It's like a bubble. They're just talking to each other and they're reinforcing that. Bitcoin as money is the only thing, important thing, everything happening there, that's dangerous. And they celebrate everything.
00:33:19.690 - 00:33:53.948, Speaker B: Something fails. The net impact, and we all know this, the net impact of experimentation has actually been positive. We have things like well established liquid markets, lending markets, smart contracts where that didn't break even with the FTX collapse and so on. Like, NFTs onboarded more users last cycle than anything else. Like people are discovering decentralized systems, they're discovering hardware wallets, they're discovering private key management through NFTs. And these folks are just left out. They think all of this is not important.
00:33:53.948 - 00:34:35.674, Speaker B: And when someone does it on bitcoin, the natural gut reaction is like, not hair. Because I've been hitting on these use cases for so many years, you can't do this here, right? So that's, I think, regardless of the block size questions, because that becomes like a justification. I think the first gut reaction is, I've been hating these use cases for years, why are you doing it in my house? And here's the beauty of it. These are valid bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin is a decentralized network. It is free for anyone to do whatever they want to do. So it was actually a test of the principles of bitcoin that this is a free network.
00:34:35.674 - 00:35:22.564, Speaker B: Here are the consensus rules. And any transaction that is valid to the consensus rules, you can't stop it with this culture that has developed, which I would argue is actually not ingrained in actual bitcoin ethos, because now you're sort of like against this idea of, here's an open network. People would do whatever that they want to do, and you can't have any say in it. So I think the argument is, when the same argument is presented in money format, basically, if you say that, hey, your enemies can also use bitcoin as money. They would agree, but this is like saying your enemy can publish a monkey picture on the network, and they're like, you can't do that. The answer is no. It is the exact same thing as your enemy using BTC as money.
00:35:22.564 - 00:35:55.048, Speaker B: Your enemy is actually storing a monkey picture on the network, and the rules allow it, and there's nothing you can do about it. So that's the cultural aspect of it. And very quickly, they're losing the arguments, and you see that because they logically can't reason it and so on. And then about the block size debate, it very quickly becomes about the bitcoin blocks have become more efficient. This is no longer 2017. Segwit went live. Taproot went live.
00:35:55.048 - 00:36:37.954, Speaker B: And in general, every couple of years, the bandwidth and disk requirements around the world for running average bitcoin nodes actually goes up. So you have to look at how much data can people actually store? And then it's also like a healthy fee market is just generally a good thing. Bitcoin fees being extremely low and Coinbase rewards going down. There's roughly like a ten year Runway, right? Like before. Even at bitcoin prices of, like, 5500,000 or even a million, the Coinbase rewards in 1315 years would actually start to become pretty relatively small. So that's a healthy thing. And when you argue about these are free markets, the use cases that will be valuable enough that people can't pay the high fees, they will pay it.
00:36:37.954 - 00:36:50.154, Speaker B: These fees are good for the miners. Miners like it. I think you start sort of, like, pushing back on some of those arguments, because I firmly believe that this is a very healthy thing.
00:36:50.854 - 00:37:11.526, Speaker A: And I guess just to kind of close out on the ordinals part before we move on to stacks, I think a lot of people are probably thinking, what's next after these inscriptions? Are these inscriptions, like, the only thing you can do, or is it possible to create the same vibrant NFT community with the same diversity of so many different projects on Ethereum, on bitcoin, with this technology as well?
00:37:11.710 - 00:37:44.990, Speaker B: Yeah, first of all, absolutely right. So think of the inscription as just a way of writing data, and there's very interesting kind of like, you know, ordinal theory behind it. So the first inscriptions are maybe more valuable. That's why there's a little bit of a rush as well. People want to get in before the first 10,000 inscriptions and before the first hundred thousand. Now, I think, I haven't looked recently, but I think we are below 200,000. Right now, but at some point, it will be like, you know, a thing that, look, I was there.
00:37:44.990 - 00:38:26.006, Speaker B: Here's a historic thing that I did on the bitcoin blockchain, and I was the first, like, 100,000 or 200,000 people to ever be able to inscribe something on bitcoin. So I think some of that is going on. So technically, they are a little bit different from nfts because the image is literally on chain, so you don't need things like ipfs. So on the NFT part, I'll share my theory. My theory is that most of the valuable NFTs will sort of find their way or some sort of integration with ordinals. Like, if you. If you're like a beeple and you're creating like, ten artworks, you'd be like, I'm gonna publish it on the most indestructible chain ever.
00:38:26.006 - 00:39:14.836, Speaker B: And I think that's going to be valuable. But because of the fee market, I highly doubt that the long tail of nfts, like, you know, millions of nfts, they just mathematically can't fit the bitcoin algorithm, right? So they would be pushed to bitcoin layers, like stacks, or they would happen elsewhere in other ecosystems that are already dominant in the NFT marketplace. So what's missing right now? I think obviously, trading is missing. There are literally excel sheets in discords that people are using right now. This is when you know that there's product market fit, that the market is pulling the product out, right? They're like, okay, you don't have a marketplace. Let's do it on excel sheets, right? And people are building, like, I know the gamma team is building this. They're trying to build easier ways to trade in a trustless way, the ordinals.
00:39:14.836 - 00:39:50.580, Speaker B: And I think that's where the interest really starts. When people can come in, they can easily trade ordinal based nfts and so on. But there's so many other use cases. I'll give you a unique one. So I mentioned earlier that stacks has this ability that reads every bitcoin transaction, reacts to it. And there's a project that the company hero systems was working on, and they call it, like, chain hooks. And the idea, high level idea, is you have some sort of data that is published on the bitcoin l one, and a smart contract reads it and reacts to it.
00:39:50.580 - 00:40:27.966, Speaker B: So it's almost like, I'll date myself, but I've actually used floppy disks in the nineties. There's data on a floppy disk you insert it in a computer, and the computer does something. So that floppy disk is actually the inscription using ordinals. And a smart computer, a smart contract is actually responding to it. That's a pretty powerful concept. It's like bitcoin is sort of your indestructible hard drive, and people are feeding programs. You could program something it's not going to execute on the l one because l one has no concept of smart contracts, but other layers would execute it.
00:40:27.966 - 00:40:52.344, Speaker B: And those layers. Can I even write back to bitcoin? So I think these are very interesting technical things that with ordinals, they just become more obvious that now I can write so much data because the data limitation has gone drastically up. Before this, people used to only use op returns, and now with the encryption size data, you can actually store a lot more data. So people are playing around with very, very interesting use cases of this.
00:40:53.284 - 00:41:17.140, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think that's a great segue to talk about stacks. Now, we've spent an entire episode talking about stacks architecture before, and you've done a lot of interviews about that. So we're not going make you do a full recap. But for people who might be just discovering stacks for the first time, I think some people have described it as a L2 to bitcoin. Some people have talked about it as a layer one that uses bitcoin as security. So can you explain what all that means and what is the best way to understand what stacks actually is?
00:41:17.292 - 00:41:58.026, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think two background context things. One is the version of stacks that went live in early 2021. It has its own security budget. That's the version that's running today as well. It has its own security budget, meaning that if you want to attack it, let's say you want to reorder some transactions, you will attack the stacks network. And the security budget of the mining power on stacks is basically what you need to overcome to Reorg stacks. The next major release is called the Nakamura release, where a bunch of things like SPDC, the decentralized peg, faster transactions, and a bunch of other things are going live.
00:41:58.026 - 00:42:27.740, Speaker B: One of the biggest changes is that the security budget actually changes to bitcoin hash power, like 100% of bitcoin hash power. Where to attack stacks? Let's say you did a transaction. You were buying a dog BTC name or NFt. Someone is basically attacking and saying that transaction never happened. They want to reorder it or do some nasty things to it, like a deep reorg type of attack. They would literally have to go and attack bitcoin. And Reorg bitcoin, which I think is a very strong security.
00:42:27.740 - 00:43:17.646, Speaker B: So before this proposal and release, like, even I would sometimes call stack as more like a layer, one that sort of like, attaches to bitcoin. Consensus runs there. It was sort of like a complicated way to describe people that it's not like an independent chain, like avalanche or solana, sort of like connected to bitcoin, but has its own security budget. With the shift of like 100% of bitcoin hash power is actually securing the transaction ordering, it starts to look more like a bitcoin layer because it doesn't have its own security budget. It's all about making bitcoin programmable. All of the data on stacks automatically gets hashed on bitcoin, similar to sort of like rollups that they're publishing hashes on the main chain for scalability. And I think lots of other things that have very tight connection to bitcoin the difference.
00:43:17.646 - 00:43:59.374, Speaker B: So this is, I think I would say stacks wouldn't be called an l one moving forward, right? So that's sort of like the early version that launched. That is more clear now that it's not an l one, where it's still a little bit unclear. And that's why I use the more generic term bitcoin layer is. Before, like, even Ethereum was born, the term l two in the bitcoin circles where I sort of, like, grew up, was used very broadly. Even Adam back would call liquid a bitcoin l two. You can go to liquid Twitter today and it says a bitcoin l two. And I think using modern definitions, you would call it a federated side chain.
00:43:59.374 - 00:44:50.434, Speaker B: So with work that happened on Ethereum and the roll ups, people had to have more precise definitions, which I actually agree with. I do think this true. L two has this one very, very important property, that if you move your assets from the l one into l two, you should be able to withdraw them without relying on any aspects of the l two. So in arbitrum or rollups, you can actually get your asset back using only the security budget of the l one. So that's the more precise definition. According to that, the sax version upgrade would not qualify as an l two because it has sort of like everything else, but there is a group of signers, a decentralized group of signers, that they have to sign on the peg out request. When you're withdrawing your BTC out, they have to sign on it.
00:44:50.434 - 00:45:15.806, Speaker B: And to reach the level of like, hey, that's not required. And only l one security can withdraw BTC. We basically need opcode support on bitcoin l one, which I think can be done, but realistically it's a years of work, right. You have to propose it. Bitcoin changes very, very slowly. So I think we need to be very, very clear to people that the system that's going live, we call it a bitcoin layer. It's actually not a side chain.
00:45:15.806 - 00:45:39.570, Speaker B: I don't even want to get into that argument, but because of the way the security, budget and other properties work, it's not a side chain. So the TLDR of the long story is calling it a bitcoin layer makes complete sense. It's a broad term. I do realize a lot of people are, for simplicity, they're just going to call it an l two. A lot of average people, they're like, mentally they have a model that. Here's the l one on top of it. Here's the l two.
00:45:39.570 - 00:45:50.374, Speaker B: I think with the more technical, precise definitions, especially using the ones used in Ethereum, it's not a true l two until you get the opcode support at bitcoin level.
00:45:51.434 - 00:46:10.488, Speaker A: That is a really, really helpful definition. I do think a lot of our listeners, because we spend so much time talking about rollups, they probably think of stacks as a roll up, which I think seems to be the most apt analogy post Nakamoto as well. And when is Nakamoto coming live? Is this something that is in conceptual phase or pretty late in development already?
00:46:10.656 - 00:46:41.224, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there are basically two research papers that came out in December. Maybe even link them in the notes and effectively, basically what happens, especially with the decentralization as well. Imagine that the ecosystem was dispersed. Everybody was doing kind of like their own thing. And they realized that they need to now learn how to work together. So very recently, 2022, summer or so, people forming these working groups, they're public, they're on GitHub. It's run as an open source project.
00:46:41.224 - 00:47:09.474, Speaker B: Anyone can participate. And what I like about it now is that even the latest research papers, they came out as products from the working groups. So it's almost like there are no authors even listed. It's like, how do we even list authors? Like so many people kind of like contributed to these papers. They came out in December. 1 paper is the updated sax design, the Nakamoto release, where it starts using 100% of the hash power, the faster blocks and other changes. I highly recommend people to just read that version.
00:47:09.474 - 00:47:38.294, Speaker B: Forget about the previous ones because they will honestly confuse you. You just want to know about the version that's going to go live now. Then there's a detailed paper on SBDC, the decentralized peg that hasn't really been done in bitcoin before. The closest thing would be something like TBTC that is trying to bring BTC from bitcoin to Ethereum. But over here we are trying to just move it from l one to a layer and then back. So there are a bunch of differences there. So those two papers would give you an overview.
00:47:38.294 - 00:48:04.564, Speaker B: I think even the engineering and implementation is public on GitHub, so a bunch of people are working on it. It's always hard to estimate, like when this thing goes live. What I can say for sure is just from my experience being in this ecosystem that it's not going live in h one of 2023, not in the first six months, in the later half of the year. Hard to pick exactly when, but I know right now I don't think it's happening in the first six months.
00:48:05.264 - 00:48:15.984, Speaker A: And given that post, Nakamoto, a lot of all of stacks will rely on bitcoin. As for its security budget, what is to use for the stacks native token then?
00:48:16.684 - 00:48:56.598, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So I think the way to think about the token is really that it's really for incentives for miners who are producing the blocks and it's incentives for people who are the decentralized group of signers who are signing the peg out transactions. Yes, it's used for gas fees as well, but I actually expect a lot of people would just use BDC. So there can be swaps in the background. Because in your wallet, if you have SBDC and you're a bitcoiner, you can just pay the gas fees. Even in BTC, in the background you're doing a swap to actually pay the gas fee in SDX. But those things you can't replace because let's compare to liquid.
00:48:56.598 - 00:49:33.414, Speaker B: It's a federation and I do think a big motivation there. Originally blockstream wanted to design a decentralized two way peg and I think they ended up with the federation because they absolutely don't want that token. Like, that's the reality of it. I'm not involved with the design decisions. Like from, as an outsider, my guess is that how would you have an open network if there's no incentive, if there's no token? The reason why Ethereum is open and decentralized, or Solana might get a lot of criticism from bitcoiners. That is very centralized. It is open source and it is open.
00:49:33.414 - 00:50:04.994, Speaker B: Anyone can become a validator it's not that there is a pre existing set of companies that you have to trust that only they can be the miners. That's not the case. Anyone can become a validator on Solana or Ethereum. So it's an open network. And similarly for the signer on liquid, there is a pre selected group of entities. They're the signer. When you move your BTC there and convert it to LBTC, you're 100% trusting these people that they will send your BTC back.
00:50:04.994 - 00:50:29.390, Speaker B: When you request 100% trust. There's no economic guarantee. It's not a decentralized group of people. It's a pre selected group, and there's no economic guarantee. They have nothing to lose other than their reputation if they don't give you the BTC back. So on snacks. We are trying to have a decentralized way of doing this with economic guarantees.
00:50:29.390 - 00:50:58.156, Speaker B: So the token is the thing you lock up in consensus. So the SBDC is secured as a consensus level for stacks. And if these people don't sign, they have actual capital locked. Like they have economic incentives to actually sign the peg out transaction. So that's the use case of the token. So whenever the bitcoin community that generally hates tokens, they question that why there is a token, I give them a very simple answer. You can remove the token.
00:50:58.156 - 00:51:12.784, Speaker B: What you will end up with is liquid, like a federation, where you have to trust the people who are running the federation with your bitcoin. That already exists in bitcoin. If you want that, please go and use it. This is a different system. It's open, it's decentralized.
00:51:13.724 - 00:51:40.020, Speaker A: Yeah. I always thought it's quite interesting how almost contradictory some of the hardline bitcoiners believes are. They want open, decentralized systems, but they don't want to do a token. So they decided to do a centralized system instead, which makes absolutely no sense to me. But, yeah, I think that explanation of the stacks, the stacks role in the stacks ecosystem makes a lot of sense there. I'm also curious. Right, so I guess we did discuss this in the beginning.
00:51:40.020 - 00:51:55.932, Speaker A: But why is building on bitcoin so important? Because isn't it much easier to scale a large community in crypto on, like, say, EvM, given just the mind share the solidity has now? And how do you convince people to come and learn clarity, which is a stacks native language. Yeah.
00:51:55.988 - 00:52:36.846, Speaker B: So I think you made a great point. I want to add something to it that it is a contradiction. You like decentralized systems and open systems, and you just would rather go to a federation and a closed system. It is a contradiction, and I think that's actually a big reason why so many people are supporting lightning. Because what lightning did is that it sort of made a compromise. It said it is open, it's a peer to peer network, but because we don't have a token, we're not going to have a chain, we're not going to have a ledger, we're not going to have a full execution environment, but it's open. At least they made a trade off on a different dimension, that you're not going to get the full execution environment because we don't want the token.
00:52:36.846 - 00:53:09.624, Speaker B: Again, I wasn't involved with the design. I'm sure they were just trying to scale payments. But that's the trade off. You either end up with a federation where you can have full execution environments, no token, or you could have a reduced set of features. Let's call it like you don't have full execution environments, but it's a peer to peer network where you can do simple things. The bitcoin script basically allows, or you can have an open system, full execution environment, but there's a token. So it's actually a good thing in a way that stacks Lightning and liquid, all three are there.
00:53:09.624 - 00:54:10.044, Speaker B: You can go to whichever one you choose. And I think that's how free markets work. So the interest from developers would actually decide that which of these design choices are actually interesting. Lightning, I actually believe is very complimentary to what we are doing because it's focused on payments and the work that they're doing, and it can be very complementary to the smart contract stuff that is happening on stacks. With that said, zooming out, why would you want to build on bitcoin with so many other chains out there? I think we've discussed a little bit of this extreme focus on decentralization and durability that I think for bitcoin sort of like stands out. Sometimes I give examples that in bitcoin you can take version of the bitcoin software from 2013, literally like from ten years ago, try to sync it with the existing copy of the chain, and it will still work. It will literally still work because the changes are so contained and so careful.
00:54:10.044 - 00:54:54.100, Speaker B: I think they're optimizing for durability and that in some ways is a low risk asset. There isn't a lot of technical complexity and risk that goes on at the bitcoin l one level, and in some ways it's a good thing. And I do believe that the lack of developer activity in the bitcoin ecosystem, them especially pre ordinals, I think I am very hopeful that with ordinals is actually changing. That was a big risk factor to bitcoin. If people aren't coming to an open source project, they aren't building new things, they aren't doing creative things. Over time you might start getting stale. And then developers are like, the tooling isn't there, the infrastructure isn't there, and at some point it just becomes like, man, it's just too hard to go and build there.
00:54:54.100 - 00:55:24.176, Speaker B: I'm just going to go somewhere else. I think that's a very real risk. We've been playing our role. We've been building good infrastructure, good wallets, good developer libraries, and hopefully with Ardnals, I think there's this sort of like a shift that just happens now. But bitcoin remains. Like, even if you look at the last bull market, a lot of people thought Ethereum might overtake bitcoin as the number one asset and so on, but it still remains the dominant capital base. No one can deny it's $500 billion of capital pretty much sitting there.
00:55:24.176 - 00:56:08.634, Speaker B: And I think there's an opportunity to actually unlock that capital. Like the developers can work with that capital, deploy it, and in some ways it's a bigger opportunity because it's untapped capital. And that opportunity is very, very sort of like in front of us in the coming years. Whereas if you go to a more mature ecosystem, if you look at Ethereum, like 200, $250 billion in capital, put tons of competition for that capital as well. Over here is a very large pool. It's like, sort of like the blue ocean, right? And yes, it might be harder because you will not get the type of dev tools and infrastructure support funding, but again, keep coming back to ordinals. I think with ordinals, all of that is changing.
00:56:08.634 - 00:56:25.124, Speaker B: People are writing more checks. I've seen so many deals happen just in the last weeks. So that stuff is changing. So if you were interested in sort of like being early in a market that can be potentially very large, I think the bitcoin capital market might be that.
00:56:25.904 - 00:57:00.724, Speaker A: Yeah. And I can attest to that. I think in the past month there's been like seven marketplaces for ordinals just pop up and that's been quite exciting to see. And I think on your point about bitcoin becoming stale without ordinals, I think that's very salient as well. I mean, you've been, you speak a lot of university campuses, I'm sure, and every time you ask the students, you know, who's interested in building ethereum, they may be like 80% raise their hands and then the other 30% is like the other l ones and so on. But then virtually 0% is interested in building on bitcoin. But then now, if you ask a question, I think there will be starting to be a material change.
00:57:00.724 - 00:57:13.700, Speaker A: And I think that kind of leads me to my last question here, which is just to tie back all of our discussions so far. How is ordinals relevant for stacks? And how important is ordinals for not bitcoin, but for stacks?
00:57:13.892 - 00:57:56.964, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they're very important. Right, because think of like stacks again, we got into the difference between the l two and generic bitcoin layer difference. But putting that aside, most people, when they think of l two s, the l one has to get enough usage where people feel the pain almost that, hey, I can't pay that high gas fees here. I need something else. And what happened in the bitcoin community with the work we did with stacks is the layer came first and the bitcoin l one wasn't really getting any usage. There weren't any use cases. Our bitcoin layer is getting some attention, but it's not like a medicine for a pain that everyone's feeling right now.
00:57:56.964 - 00:58:44.614, Speaker B: I think that dynamic is starting to change with the fees. I am already, personally, I have some bitcoin that are just spread across Utxos and I am trying to find time to collect them now when fees are, they've already done like a seven to ten x before they do 100 x, and I'll have to pay a lot more money to basically do the same thing because I can see it coming. Like, bitcoin fees are just going to go up, a lot of use cases are going to come to bitcoin and I think to scale them, you would absolutely have to go to bitcoin mathematically, logically. There's no other, other path forward and way. I think that's why the activity happening on L1 is actually very, very complimentary to the work that we've been doing.
00:58:46.794 - 00:59:27.226, Speaker A: So that was it for our episode with Munip. This is such an exciting topic to me personally, because it's bringing a lot of attention back to bitcoin for the first time in a long time. So for people who want to keep up to date with stacks, you can follow them on Twitter, stacks or stacks BTC, and I'm excited to share more in future episodes.
