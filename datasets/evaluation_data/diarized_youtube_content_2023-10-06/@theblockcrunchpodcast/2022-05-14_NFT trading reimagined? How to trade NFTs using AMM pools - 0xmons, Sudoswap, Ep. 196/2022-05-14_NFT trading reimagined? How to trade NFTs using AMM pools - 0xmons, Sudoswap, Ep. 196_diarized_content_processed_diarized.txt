00:01:07.864 - 00:01:49.764, Speaker C: Hey everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. This week I'm super excited to have Owen, the founder of Sudoswap and also Xmon, onto the show today. So for those of you who are not aware, Sudo Swap is a new free OTC P two P trading platform for nfts, and they're also creating their own unique Amm for the trading of nfts. And if you've been following the show for the past few weeks, you know, we've been diving really deep into the topic of NFT investing and also NFT infrastructure, talking to projects like Nifty Fi. So I'm really, really excited to talk to one of the newest and most exciting community backed projects out there called Sudoswap and to have the founder, Owen on the show. So, Owen, thanks for taking the time to chat with us.
00:01:50.064 - 00:01:53.576, Speaker D: Hi. Yeah, thanks for having me here, Jason. Yeah.
00:01:53.600 - 00:02:06.564, Speaker C: So before we get started about pseudoswap, let's hear a little bit about your background. Because I know before Sudo swap you built this really interesting project with a lot of these animal NFT monsters. Can you talk a little bit about that?
00:02:07.664 - 00:03:01.614, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah. So before I started Sudoswap, the community and the reason for building that sort of came out of this project called Zero X bonds, which is this Gan NFT project where there's a mix of some computer generated prompts from GPT-3 with an image model that creates these animations, and we paired them together to create these NFTs. And, you know, people in the community then originally wanted things to, you know, they might want to swap their monster with one another. And that was the motivation for originally building out, like, the OTC part of Sudo swap, you know, just like a tool to let people, you know, swap not just their monsters, but, you know, any sort of tokens.
00:03:02.714 - 00:03:47.324, Speaker C: And what gave you the idea to start Zero X months? Because it, when I first discovered it, I think this was maybe a year, maybe several months ago, time kind of blurs together in crypto, but when I discovered it, I thought that I didn't realize the text was written by AI. And just to give our listeners a sense of what I mean. So if you go on Zeroexmons XYZ, you see these kind of different, almost trading cards of different, I guess, digital Pokemon looking creatures, and each of them have a description. And this is one of the descriptions out there, one of the more ominous and dangerous of the pitch gods. Sarutahiko's name means nightless, so it reads like something that a fantasy writer wrote. But you're telling me that this is all written by GPT-3, right.
00:03:48.744 - 00:04:20.558, Speaker D: It was prompted, though, with some of the descriptions from HP Lovecraft. So, you know, GPT-3 is really great at continuing, you know, existing patterns that you give it in the prompt. So I was taking, you know, like a list of existing, you know, monsters with their descriptions and then getting the continuation and then picking the ones that I liked. So there was still a curation process, but all the original text was sort of from GPT-3 got it.
00:04:20.606 - 00:04:32.554, Speaker C: As a former wannabe english major, hearing kind of lovecraftian references really excites me as well. And what gave you the idea to start that? And what are some of the key kind of takeaways you had from that project?
00:04:34.074 - 00:05:23.134, Speaker D: So before I started working on crypto stuff full time, I was working more on things related to ML. So I'd sort of played around with generative stuff for a while, but I never really thought of a good project that could utilize it. So when I got into the space for real around Defi summer, NFTs were much more nascent than, like, rarible had just started their round of rewards, and people were paying less attention to them. And I wanted to start a project that was maybe a little bit low or stakes. So I thought, okay, well, maybe nfts work a little bit better than trying to start directly in Defi. That was sort of the original motivation.
00:05:24.914 - 00:05:44.734, Speaker C: Got it. And from that I think you seem to have built a following. From that you have a lot of real fans who followed you into your new venture, pseudoswap as well. And before we start talking about how pseudoswap came to be, what do you think is wrong with the way kind of people trade nfts today? What prompted you to build a platform for people to trade nfts?
00:05:46.194 - 00:06:49.674, Speaker D: I think there's more things that buyers and sellers might want. One of them is having better control over how they price their inventory. Then obviously for traders they probably want lower fees, whether that's like gas fees, spreads between bid ask, or just platform fees entirely. So those are sort of just the high level observations of people who do the buying or selling might want more options and they might want things to just be cheaper. As for the community part that you briefly touched upon that I'm really excited by a lot of the people who sort of held and participated in zero x months community able to sort of bring them as we made pseudoswap like the new focus of what we're working on. And it's been really great having their continued support.
00:06:51.174 - 00:07:00.434, Speaker C: Yeah, we're going to dive into that in a little bit as well. But just for those of us who are listening to this right now and not familiar, what is Sudo swap?
00:07:01.694 - 00:07:50.564, Speaker D: Yeah, so as you briefly mentioned before, Sudoswap is as it exists today, if you go to Sudoswap XYz, it's a free OTC platform powered by the Zero X protocol, allowing you to do like any combination of assets, like maybe two ERC twenty s and an ERC 721 swap with another person for, you know, some of their assets, like maybe one of their one thousand, one hundred and fifty five s and one of their 721s. So it's basically like an any, for any OTC tool. That's the main thing that we have out today. But the thing that we've been working on for like the past half year that we're really excited to slowly unveil now that all the pieces are coming together, is this new marketplace like based on an AMM for trading nfts.
00:07:51.804 - 00:08:10.944, Speaker C: And for the people listening out there, they've probably had experience trading on OpenSea before. And also, I guess more or less community driven versions like looksrare as well. What is the difference with Sudoswap and OpenSea and some of these other NFT marketplaces out there?
00:08:11.764 - 00:09:07.359, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that the word amm sort of might put a few people off. So I think that I'll sort of abstract it a bit. The main differences when it comes to using our platform, I think are going to be improvements in handling bulk listings. Right now, if you want to adjust pricing for all of your stuff, it can be quite annoying. Right on Opensea, you have to sign orders for each item, and then if you want to make them more expensive, you have to make transactions to cancel those orders and then re sign orders to make them more expensive. Whereas the ideas in our platform, if you have all of the items under one batch listing, you can more easily, with one click, adjust how you want all the items to be priced. And the same thing for the sell side.
00:09:07.359 - 00:09:43.424, Speaker D: If you wanted to manage a group collection order, not just here's ten ETH to buy, uh, like one NFT, maybe here's like, uh, 30 ETH to buy three nfts at ten ETH, you can also more flexibly manage, um, like those types of orders. For users, the goal is to be the same. You know, you can see the items that are for sale, um, you can purchase them, you see the bids you have for your items, you can sell into them, um, and the goal is to make all of those interactions, like gas wise and fee wise, cheaper than the existing alternatives.
00:09:44.724 - 00:10:22.464, Speaker C: And it's interesting you talk about amms, and I love to take a step back here, because a lot of the listeners on the show, they know about amms. They've been following our Defi series, you know, since 2018, and they follow kind of the rise of uniswap. But when you pair amms and nfts together, I think a lot of people are confused, because their conception of conception of Amm is that you put two assets that are fungible into a pull together and just let the curve in the Amm decide the price. And people can trade. But when it comes to fungible tokens, those two ideas usually don't seem to reconcile. Can you help us understand a little bit about just how are you able to build an amm around non fungible assets?
00:10:23.804 - 00:11:16.914, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. The idea here is the amm refers to an individual LP's position. So a certain depositor might put in some amount of tokens or some amount of nfts and dictate some sort of price transition for how they want it to respond to buy or sell quotes. But in aggregate, you have lots of different LP's, each managing their own pool. So in our protocol, we don't put people together in the way that you normally deposit into an existing pool, like on uniswap v two. So it almost behaves much more if you think about it like a clob. In the worst case, each person just has one NFT and one pool at like some listing price.
00:11:16.914 - 00:12:06.324, Speaker D: Obviously, people who might want to bulk list might have more nfts in a pool, in which case this is where the amm part starts coming into play. They might choose, like, how they want their prices to change as buyers sells come in. But you can imagine, right, like in the worst case, this is just behaving like a clobber. Each person just has one NFT in their pool, and then we just show all the listings and it behaves very much like, you know, an on chain order book. But the idea is you can get a lot more efficiency if you assume that, you know, some people want to bulk list or bulk buy. So I think an analogy is sort of like uniswap v three, where you have many different liquidity positions at different ranges, and the actual swapping just happens across all of the open positions.
00:12:07.744 - 00:12:18.404, Speaker C: Does that mean for each type of NFT, say for like cryptopunks or for bored apes, you have a separate liquidity pool that users can come in and deposit as liquidity providers?
00:12:19.884 - 00:12:37.984, Speaker D: It means that, but it also means that each user is managing their own pool. Like, if I want to sell apes, I'm going to have this pool that I manage specifically for apes that I can control the pricing over. So it's almost like the listing itself is sort of a pool.
00:12:38.804 - 00:12:46.544, Speaker C: And can other people also deposit their bored apes into your board apes pool? Or does every user have to manage their own pool?
00:12:46.904 - 00:13:17.254, Speaker D: Right, so each user manages their own pool. This is what I meant about the listing analogy. Each user deposits, if they want to sell item deposits, one or more nfts into a pool that they control the pricing over. And the actual purchases happen, you know, across all of the pools. So you can set a pool with a higher pricing, but this is the same as just like listing your item at a higher price, right? People are probably just going to be less compelled to see purchase it if there's cheaper items available in the marketplace.
00:13:17.954 - 00:13:38.600, Speaker C: So that's a really interesting design, because from the buyer's perspective, is there a risk of fragmentation where if I want to buy it aboard Aves, I have to look at, like, Owens pool, I have to look at Jason's pool, I have to look at all these different pools? Or is it just kind of one UI where users can just choose what type of NFT they want and then it routes to that person's pool automatically behind the scenes, it's the second one.
00:13:38.682 - 00:13:53.064, Speaker D: So there's really no difference whether if your item is in a different pool in the same way that if you're on OpenSea, it doesn't matter if the item is listed by person a or person b, right? You just see all the items available for sale.
00:13:54.364 - 00:14:17.334, Speaker C: Got it. And I guess using some of our defi logic here, every time we look at some sort of an aggregator with multiple pools where a user's order is routed to different pools or different exchanges, there's always a significant increase in gas costs. But you also mentioned that the cost savings in sudo swap would be quite significant even with this fragmented pool model. How is that possible?
00:14:20.794 - 00:15:41.914, Speaker D: There are two things that make this nicer than you would be, maybe naively thinking about. One is that all of the pools share the same code base. So there are some optimizations we can do, um, where users only have to interact with like a few contracts, um, that actually pull and send the tokens, right, compared to if you're, you know, doing an aggregator across multiple Amm pools, where you might have to swap both on like curb and Uniswap, you know, there's more work you have to do now because there's like different places where you have to send tokens, but in our case, because everything is like under the same infrastructure, there's less work we have to do. Um, secondly, uh, the efficiency comes from like the way that we just handle listings, right? In the worst case, as I mentioned, each NFT is in its own pool. Um, and even in the single transfer case, like gas costs are still lower than opensea or luxury. But if you have more than one NFT in a pool, then you can do, you know, again, batch transfers which are going to be a little bit cheaper and you get efficiencies there. On top of that, we do a few things like we handle native ETH directly and we handle native NFTs, so there's no wrapping of either ETH or the NFT on either side when buys or sells happen.
00:15:43.254 - 00:16:16.640, Speaker C: That makes sense. And now Sudo swap is also not the first project to tackle NFT Amm idea. There is one called NFTx and also one called NFT 20, I think, both of which were launched in June of 2021 and respectively. Now NFTX has about $35 million in deposits and NFT 20 has about 3.5 million in deposits. But my understanding is that they have a slightly different model where they have one specific pool for one specific type of NFT. So for instance, for NFT 20.
00:16:16.640 - 00:16:36.014, Speaker C: There's an art blocks pool, and everybody just puts their art blocks there, and then every trade related to art blocks just occurs in that pool. So can you kind of maybe explain to us the difference between sudo and these projects and why did you guys decide to go with that fragmented kind of individual pool model?
00:16:37.194 - 00:16:44.482, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think for people out there, I think both projects actually launched closer to like January of 2021 and not June.
00:16:44.618 - 00:16:45.482, Speaker C: Oh, wow. Okay.
00:16:45.578 - 00:17:51.056, Speaker D: For people wanting to keep track. Yeah. I recently wrote a blog post about the ways that the AMM design that we have is a little bit different from existing things. So if people want to dive into the weeds of calculating which prices you're providing liquidity at percent of liquidity use, I'll direct us to the blog post, which also has some of the code that I use to run the simulations, generate the graphs, I guess, high level. I'll speak about like, some of the difficulties you might run into if you're just using like a normal uniswap v to, you know, x times y equals k curve to provide liquidity for nfts and how that's a little bit different from the model that we have. So there's a few things that make pricing a little bit more difficult. The first is that, you know, normally when you have an x times y equals k curve, people can buy or sell any amount of tokens.
00:17:51.056 - 00:19:01.824, Speaker D: So even if your pool isn't that deep, if there's some other market, you can still have some amount of arbitrage as long as transaction or pool fees aren't too high to keep your amm pool roughly in line with some other external market. But when you're talking about nfts, usually external markets are trading in whole numbers. You can't try to arb a pool by like 0.1 of an NFT because there's not a lot of other markets that desire that. So this makes arbitrage a little bit more difficult. And then two is that traders often have a good sense of how to size their trades according to the size of the pool when trading. But again, if you have to buy or sell in whole number increments, I think this, like, throw some people off, you know, it makes trading a little bit more counterintuitive because now you're forced to take some amount of slippage, like no matter what sort of, so these are, you know, some of the, in our minds, like, some of the drawbacks that can happen if you just directly use like the x times y equals k curve and then sort of discretize it to handle nfts.
00:19:02.684 - 00:19:04.236, Speaker C: Hey guys, I'm really excited to tell.
00:19:04.260 - 00:19:38.410, Speaker A: You more about one of my favorite products in crypto right now, DyDx. This is a team I've known since 2018 and theyve built one of the best exchange venues out there that also happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly. Now listen until the end because theres an opportunity for savvy traders out there as well. And here are just a few reasons why I like Dydx over other exchanges. First, its very liquid. It processes two to $3 billion every day in volume and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording. Which means you can trade things like Ethereum, bitcoin, Doge Solana and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today.
00:19:38.410 - 00:20:28.684, Speaker A: Second, its also extremely cheap and if youre down bad from the bear market you dont have to worry about gas fees at all because there is no gas fee on starkware L2 where DyDx is built on. Now that brings me to my next point as well. Its incredibly fast, unlike other L2 and high speed dexs, you dont actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore. And as an additional point, by using Starkware, DYDX also provides provides users with increased security and privacy. And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so many different subaccounts. And their IOFS mobile app is also live right now and it's amazing because it's compatible with metamask, Coinbase wallet, Coin 98, Huawei Wallet, and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there. And it's available for for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today.
00:20:28.684 - 00:20:53.744, Speaker A: And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions, the most recent tier in the $10,000 equity tier have won over $95,000 in rewards. And you can get started with as low as $500 in equity to compete for prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DyDX exchange to learn more. And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:20:56.244 - 00:21:11.704, Speaker C: Got it. And my understanding also is that for something like NFT 20, they can only, I guess there's only one price for their nfts listed there, which is the floor price. Whereas for pseudoswap you allow people to list their nfts at whatever price they want. Is that correct?
00:21:12.444 - 00:21:58.874, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think we're using the word amm because, you know, it, it fits in the sense that we have ways to let people specify algorithmically how they want their price to change. But I think the model that I've been trying to think about it more, at least when we have conversations, is sort of like cloud and that. Yeah, you can treat pseudoswap like the central limit order book. You can just list all of your nfts in individual pools at some price and then adjust that price if you want, which makes it behave like an on chain order book. Or, you know, if you have batches of nfts that you want more control over, like if you want more fine grained pricing, you can put them all into one pool. And then this is where the amm stuff starts to become more relevant.
00:22:00.014 - 00:22:30.154, Speaker C: So I guess not to draw too much of a parallel to defi, but it sounds almost like Sudoswap is what Uniswap V three is to something like serum or, or uniswap V two, which is somewhere between an amm but also somewhere between an amm and a central limit order book where you can set disparate prices. But there's also that element of just automated market making to it. Is that kind of a roughly correct way to understand pseudoswap?
00:22:30.854 - 00:22:38.278, Speaker D: I think in terms of intuition, that's probably a helpful analogy, changing the focus.
00:22:38.326 - 00:22:52.594, Speaker C: To users as well, because there's so many different ways for people to list their nfts right now and trade their nfts. What would you say is some of the things that users care about the most, and how does sudo swap cater to those things?
00:22:54.454 - 00:23:59.224, Speaker D: I think that trading experience in terms of fees paid is always going to be really important. Right. When you do something that can help people save money, they're willing to jump through several hoops for that. So in our case, you know, we've been trying to approach this by thinking about one, you know, how can we make just direct buys and sells, like cheaper than existing platforms, gas wise? And then two is, you know, what are ways that we can like, sustainably reduce the platform fee being taken to be competitive with other platforms? So that's on the trading side and then on the side of sellers, right. I sort of alluded to this where the question is how can we give sellers more flexibility over their listings? You know, whether that's like allowing people to just dollar cost average out, you know, by selling each NFT at like, you know, one ETH increment as the floor rises or something, or by allowing them to, you know, better manage their collection orders.
00:24:00.604 - 00:25:03.054, Speaker C: And I think with Dexs, people kind of had this, some people had this thesis that most of the trades will eventually be conducted on aggregators. So increasingly you see exchanges that are designed to be like aggregators as well. So one of which is cowswap, which is a portfolio company of mine, and they basically match your orders kind of to any offsetting orders that might be submitted in real time. But if no offsetting orders are submitted, they will route you to any of the available Dexs out there. So there's always that kind of aggregation element. And in nfts, I think we're starting to see the same thing as well, where we see aggregators like Gem or genie increasingly driving more and more volume. So I guess zooming out, do you foresee most users maybe just going to an aggregator where they don't have to worry about where the nfts are listed or traded and they just go to that one place and that place automatically routes the orders for them? Or do you foresee people still going to specific exchanges they trust, like sudo swap like x two, y two or luxrare to trade individual nfts?
00:25:07.194 - 00:26:14.784, Speaker D: I think that's a good question. I think that aggregation is very powerful and the sort of users that you expect to see. If we just take a look at defi market share, I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head, but I think that aggregator usage has gone up and sort of stayed more constant in recent months. I don't know if you have those off the top of my head, but I think things like matcha and one inch are doing sort of like steady percentages but aren't eating up like the entire share. So I think there's some arguments to be made that it's sort of about product and that if quoting is roughly the same, some people might still just, force of habit, go to whatever they think is providing them the better experience in our case, and hope we think that's like where prices are best.
00:26:16.804 - 00:26:28.784, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess on that point, I know you touched on this a little bit already, but just to clarify, how does Sudoswap guarantee kind of the best execution prices across all the exchanges over time?
00:26:30.284 - 00:27:22.164, Speaker D: So Sudoswap doesn't, in case I was unclear, Sudoswap doesn't aggregate across different marketplaces. It aggregates across like different pseudo swap pools that people create. So the guarantee you have is just that you see all of the items that are available and you see the prices that you're purchasing them at, and then your purchase either goes through or someone buys the item before you in the way that a normal marketplace does. As for how you can guarantee that, unlike Opensea elixir because their protocols are on chain, if you want, you can run your own indexer listening directly to Ethereum, pay attention to when new pools are created, and then just keep track of the inventory and prices yourself without having to ping the OpenSea API or something for their off chain order book.
00:27:23.784 - 00:27:56.504, Speaker C: That makes sense. It sounds like there's going to be a lot of optimization behind the scenes that end users may not even be aware of. And it's super exciting. And I think on the point about users as well, we're seeing a lot of these decentralized NFT marketplaces incentivize usage. So looksrare is rebating people who list nfts and people who generate volume or granted tokens as well. I think similar with x two, y two, and other decentralized NFT marketplace. Do you think these are sustainable solutions and this is something that you guys would explore as well?
00:27:58.094 - 00:28:57.478, Speaker D: I think it's definitely something we're exploring more early stage for us, right. I think the most important thing for us right now is just to get a good marketplace experience out the door first. Then we can start talking about more exciting future plans about incentivization. As for whether or not this is going to work long term, I think that incentivization always means that there's spend on the protocol side. So the question is about whether or not you're offsetting it with enough protocol revenue. I think that medium term there's probably going to be more of a race to the bottom in terms of fees. I think that there's more room in the NFT market specifically for more efficiencies.
00:28:57.478 - 00:29:24.214, Speaker D: So I guess it's probably not sustainable at current levels. I think looks for it just did a happening today or yesterday, for example. Um, so. Right, like rewards that are being emitted, at least for existing platforms, seems to be going down over time.
00:29:25.234 - 00:30:07.894, Speaker C: Yeah, I think as of the recording, I think yesterday maybe, or today looks where I just have the rewards as well. So I guess we'll see by the time that this episode comes out whether volumes have gone down. But personally I'm not hugely in favor of kind of inflationary incentives, but I know a lot of looksrare's incentives are based in their fees generated as well. So I guess, yeah, only time will tell. And I guess on that note about kind of forward looking statements as well. Are there structural advantages that I guess, floor based amms like NFT 20 or NFTX or just pure p two p type of trading models like luxray, are there structural advantages that these designs have over sudo swap?
00:30:09.434 - 00:30:41.830, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Right. It's a series of trade offs that you make each time. In our case, we think that there's certain things that we make more difficult, like fungibility of token positions. We don't tokenize your pools or your listings when you create them, whereas if you're using something like NFTx or NFT 20, you have a much more liquid wrapper or proxy for the LP position. So if you wanted to, you know, do something involving staking, not saying that's impossible. Right.
00:30:41.830 - 00:31:08.684, Speaker D: Like, we're working on things for Sudo, but it's much more straightforward to do that with like NFTx or NFT 20 if you just wanted to acquire like LP tokens. In the case of like existing like off chain order book on chain settlement options, there's lower initial friction because users just have to sign instead of making a transaction when they want to list one item.
00:31:10.544 - 00:31:23.724, Speaker C: Got it. That makes sense. Yeah. Thanks for that very lucid answer. And I guess looking forward in terms of where the project is at today, can you give us a little insight about what stage the project is and when can we expect to be able to use the amm?
00:31:24.504 - 00:31:57.634, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. So the project has been audited by ABDK and speaker two and we recently just got like both reports finalized and put up on GitHub. People want to look at those. The code is deployed onto mainnet and we're doing internal testing right now. We did internal testing on testnet prior. So the last big hurdle for us is getting like a stable UI that everyone can be using. So that's what we're spending all of our dev work on now.
00:31:57.634 - 00:32:22.624, Speaker D: And like slowly, you know, introducing very alpha builds of it to early community members, you know, for bug hunting and feedback. So, like, you know, in terms of, you know, the whole development pipeline, I'm excited to say we're almost at the place where we can, you know, start. But I think like the next few weeks for us are going to be really crucial in terms of like really getting, nailing like the initial product down.
00:32:24.224 - 00:32:47.324, Speaker C: Yeah, and I'm super excited for our listeners to check this out as well, especially because this is one of the very few kind of grassroots driven projects. I don't think you guys have raised any funding before. So this is completely grassroots to this point. So I'm super excited for people to check this out and always open and supporting projects like this. And for people who want to stay up to date with the project, what are the best resources for them to check out?
00:32:47.864 - 00:33:12.644, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Most announcements will go through Twitter. So just Udo swap. And then for people who want to do some of the deeper dives, we have, like, two blog posts up on blog pseudoswap xYz. And as we get closer to launch, you know, we're, we'll be doing, like, more of these deep dives where people want to, like, get more into the technicals. So that's where we'll be putting up more content.
00:33:13.704 - 00:33:28.664, Speaker C: Yeah, most definitely. Well, Owen, thank you so much for taking the time to come on the show and explain to us what you're working on. We can't wait to check out the product and once again, go follow Owen on Twitter. I will include the link in the show notes below. So thank you so much for coming on the show.
00:33:29.044 - 00:33:30.964, Speaker D: No problem. It was a pleasure being on here. Jason.
