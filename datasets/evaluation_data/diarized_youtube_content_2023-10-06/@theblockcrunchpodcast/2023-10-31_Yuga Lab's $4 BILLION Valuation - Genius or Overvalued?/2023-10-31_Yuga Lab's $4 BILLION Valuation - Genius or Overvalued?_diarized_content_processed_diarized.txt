00:00:00.320 - 00:00:42.454, Speaker A: The way they've made money is number one, they sell nfts for bored apes and they sell these lands and they also sold ape tokens. So they created a token which they say is basically the in world virtual currency, right? This ape coin which has just not performed very well since the launch. But they can say that about any token. But it seems to me like the key business model here for metaverse companies is to continue selling certain assets that are expected to have some value in the future. So the entire business model is still very much based on speculation and not quite, quite supported by utility beyond the social status symbol. So I think this is the reason why I thought this is such a crazy example of excess. I'm still quite excited.
00:00:42.454 - 00:00:59.014, Speaker A: I hope something takes off with other side, which is their metaverse. But looking back $450 million and a 4 billion valuation for Yugalabs, it's either going to look like a genius move ten years from now or the most obvious, insanely overvalued thing.
