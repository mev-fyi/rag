00:00:01.520 - 00:00:12.070, Speaker A: Welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the show for crypto natives. Every week we do short but in depth conversations with the most important builders and investors in crypto so you can filter through what's noise and stay ahead of the markets.
00:00:12.182 - 00:00:13.798, Speaker B: I'm your host, Jason Choi.
00:00:13.926 - 00:00:15.286, Speaker C: Nothing on this show should be construed.
00:00:15.310 - 00:00:20.742, Speaker A: As financial advice, and my guests, myself and my employer may hold positions and assets discussed on the show.
00:00:20.878 - 00:00:26.406, Speaker B: Today's episode is brought to you by our sponsors, Nexo, Radix, and Bittrex. Stick around to learn more.
00:00:26.470 - 00:01:16.716, Speaker D: Now, if you're an investor in Ethereum or you're part of the Defi community, you're probably really excited, because this week, or last week, by the time this episode actually comes out, was monumental for all of crypto, especially for Ethereum. While Bloomberg and Wall Street Journal were busy reporting on bitcoin breaking all time high in price, Ethereum 2.0 finally rolled out its phase zero. This is arguably a much more important event as it signals the transition of Ethereum from its current state to a more scalable future that can support more applications and prepare for actual mass adoption. So to join us to explain just what is being upgraded, the implications of this transition, the traction so far, and some of the key challenges coming up for Ethereum are Ryan Watkins and Wilson withium analysts from Asari, a research and data company. But before we get to that, let's hear from our sponsor, Nexo.
00:01:16.820 - 00:01:41.288, Speaker A: Today's episode is brought to you by the good folks from Nexo. In this crisis, many investors aim to keep and grow their digital assets. Others seek to maximize the yield on their cash. Nexo allows you to achieve exactly these two goals. The company offers instant crypto credit lines against all major cryptocurrencies with interest rates starting from only 5.9% APR. Nexo also lets you earn up to 8% annually on your fiat and digital assets.
00:01:41.288 - 00:01:49.280, Speaker A: What's more, interest is paid out daily. That means you can add or withdraw your funds at any time. So get started today at Nexo IO.
00:01:49.352 - 00:02:25.744, Speaker C: And hey everybody, I'm super excited to have Ryan and Wilson from the Masari research team on here to talk about one of the biggest topics in crypto right now. That is Ethereum 2.0. Now, just to give a little bit of context for those of you who don't know, Masari is a data and research company in crypto that I have been following since their very early days as a happy and paying user. And recently, Ryan and Wilson put together a massive report on Ethereum 2.0 that spans, I think, over 60 pages. So incredibly detailed. And I'm very excited to be able to pick Ryan and Wilson's brain on this specific topic.
00:02:25.744 - 00:02:27.204, Speaker C: So guys, welcome to the show.
00:02:27.304 - 00:02:27.980, Speaker E: Thanks, Jason.
00:02:28.092 - 00:02:29.916, Speaker F: Yeah, thanks, Jason. Happy to be here.
00:02:30.060 - 00:02:47.404, Speaker C: Awesome. So just to get us started, guys, you wrote this massive report on ethereum 2.0. So can you give us maybe a little history about just how did this idea of Ethereum 2.0 came to be? Why can't we just stick to the Ethereum that was launched in 2016? And either of you guys feel free to start with this, I guess, high.
00:02:47.444 - 00:03:43.888, Speaker E: Level why does Ethereum 2.0 need to exist? And why is it needed now? So I think there's one major problem with Ethereum today, and is that it doesn't scale. And we've seen the impacts of that and effects of that both in 2017 when we had that massive ICO run and then cryptokitties ended up pushing Ethereum to its limits. And we've also seen that recently with the rise of Defi and just a boom in economic activity that's taking place in Ethereum in the back half of 2020, that Ethereum just simply can't scale today. And it's created a really challenging user experience for many people because transaction times will be slow, transaction fees will be high. So basically what Ethereum 2.0 is, is a way of addressing the scalability issue, one and then two.
00:03:43.888 - 00:04:08.724, Speaker E: It's also a way of increasing Ethereum's security, as well as it's also a major upgrade to ETH the asset by adding this staking component. So that's kind of like high level overview of what Ethereum is or where Ethereum has come from, and kind of like why Ethereum is needed today? And I'll let Wilson kind of explain some more backstory on kind of the road to YouTube put out.
00:04:09.504 - 00:05:22.194, Speaker F: Yeah, so this is, this entire upgrade has been about seven years in the making. Vitalik and all the other Ethereum foundation, Ethereum founders, developers have been talking about this type of upgrade from the beginning, even before Ethereum was launched. So they recognized coming in that there were some serious limitations with blockchain technology obviously surrounding the consensus. Was there an alternative to proof of work that could work better in the long term that could be more sustainable? Their top option was proof of stake. And on the other side, is there a way to make it more scalable, as in, can we create a platform where you don't have to have every node on the network process every transaction, can you make it so they only have to process part of the chain securely so you can have any one run a node on the network. So these were two of crypto's biggest problems from the start. And Ethereum research teams have really spent poured years into developing these mechanisms, solving for problems with proof of stake, because they had some pretty fatal problems early on.
00:05:22.194 - 00:06:08.116, Speaker F: How can they work around those, get to a design where hey, this might actually work, and then not only how can it actually work, now we need to put it into a platform, actually put it into a production ready platform. So that's why you've seen so many years of research, some false starts along the way, finally getting to a point where you can get a real product spec in place and start building some clients around it to actually get to that point. So that's why it's been taken from a theoretical concept into a production ready concept. And doing something like that, that is really, from a sense, groundbreaking. That just takes time. So that's why it's really been a seven year effort to get to this point.
00:06:08.180 - 00:06:39.184, Speaker C: Yeah, it blows my mind that it's been taken so long before we see this first face of Ethereum 2.0, which is just starting to launch right now. And in this report you guys mentioned, there are actually more than a few phases, and there's actually three components, the proof of stake part, the sharding part, and the beacon chain, which will all be built out in the, in these kind of subsequent phases. So can you help us outline what are these phases at a high level, and how long do you think it would take them to all play out for us to have that full Ethereum 2.0 vision?
00:06:39.724 - 00:07:42.474, Speaker F: So, yeah, so e 2.0 is broken down into really four phases as I have it at the moment. So just walking through each of them briefly, phase zero is the most imminent one, and that's the one we're looking very forward to launching, hopefully a week from tomorrow, if not very soon after. And that will introduce the concept of the beacon chain, and that will be a proof of stake network that is actually separate from the existing Ethereum network. And that will be the first introduction that people will have to staking Ethereum on a network in return for some stake rewards or yield. And it's all about building up the validator set of that network. So getting people on board, working through any of the growing pains that there may be, but making sure that the chosen proof of stake algorithm that Ethereum has is up to speed and getting a validator set robust enough to handle some of the other upgrades further down the road.
00:07:42.474 - 00:08:35.900, Speaker F: The second phase, phase one, we're probably looking, I've heard some early estimates saying about a year out. So you could be looking q 420 21, maybe early 2020, sorry, 2022. And that's going to be the introduction of shard chains. So when we're talking about sharding, that's, we're going to introduce 64 individual chains, which essentially be like copies of the network, but they all plug back in and reference each other back to that beacon chain. So the beacon chain is that coordination layer for all the different chains that are out there. So that would enable them to secure, like all the validators on the beacon chain would secure all the other chains. And then on top of that, you would not only would it secure it, it would be a communication layer as well.
00:08:35.900 - 00:09:27.214, Speaker F: So you'd be able to communicate from one shard to the next through that beacon chain. It should be noted in these first two phases, phase zero, phase one, there's not going to be a whole lot of functionality. It's really just coming to consensus on the beacon chain and then on the beacon chain with all the shards together in phase one. So there won't be any application functionality, you won't be able to drop any smart contracts on there, and there won't be any transactions either. It's really just focusing on how you build out this architecture, which is relatively new with this level of activity, with these number of validators on the network, where things start to get interesting is the third phase. Phase 1.5 is where you see this merge of the current network with Ethereum 2.0.
00:09:27.214 - 00:10:15.010, Speaker F: So we're actually going to take the state and account balances from Ethereum now and transition it as a shard within the Ethereum 2.0 network. So it's going to be one of the 64 shards, and it's supposed to. From an application and user standpoint, it's supposed to look pretty seamless. You're really just swapping out the proof of work layer that's building blocks right now for a proof of stake layer, and that's it. So all the work is kind of like underneath, underneath everything that's happening on the execution layer, while the execution layer remains essentially the same, and then the final phase after that. I know some estimates have come out that said, maybe it will come around like 2023, but phase two could come further down the line.
00:10:15.010 - 00:11:00.082, Speaker F: There's no real timeline for this. And that's when each of these shards would get application execution abilities so you would actually be able to deploy smart contracts directly onto the shard chains. That would really unlock the scalability of what Ethereum 2.0 can bring. Because now, instead of living on a single network, now I can live across all these different shards with various applications living on there. And then instead of having a data bottleneck on one chain, you can use whatever chain you want. The one caveat that we should add in there though, is that there's a need for scalability now, and there is an option called rollups that we can get into a little bit later.
00:11:00.082 - 00:11:36.476, Speaker F: But the short point of it is that you could potentially use rollups with shard chains in phase one. You could use them as data availability layers. That would essentially allow you to use the access to scalability of what Ethereum 2.0 has been promising all along. The short change of it is if these roll ups plus shard chains work out, there is a chance that we may not necessarily need phase two. So we can go into that later. But that's pretty much the high level of the phases and the potential timeline around them.
00:11:36.660 - 00:11:58.184, Speaker C: That's fascinating, and we'll definitely go into the roll ups versus sharding type of discussion later on. But for now, it seems like there is a lot of different moving parts for Ethereum, and I know you guys mentioned different clients working on them. So who are the people that's working on Ethereum 2.0 right now, and what are some of the different teams?
00:11:58.684 - 00:12:55.304, Speaker F: Yeah, so it's been pretty fascinating, the effort that Ethereum foundation has put into building out a very broad client base. So right now Ethereum has this standpoint of we want multiple clients running on the network. Why is that? Why don't we just use one client? That's very, very good. Well, if you're running on a network that is a single client, and say that has a bug or an issue, it's a point of centralization, really. So if that goes down, the network can go down, and that's a huge issue. Whereas if you are running multiple clients that make up a good percentage of the network, you can potentially have one go down, but the network can still be operating at the same time because you have this other majority or minority client that can handle the network and continue to make blocks. So for Ethereum 2.0,
00:12:55.304 - 00:13:42.764, Speaker F: Ethereum foundation made a very strong effort to make sure they funded enough client teams going in there so you'd have plenty of viable clients when this beacon chain launches. So right now they have four chance, four clients that are ready so you can run a node on the network using each of these four. One of these four clients, the top teams right now, the top team is prismatic labs, and their client is called prism. Another team is Sigma prime, and their client is lighthouse. There's another team called status. And so that's the same instant messaging application used on Ethereum, but they're building an ETH 2.0 client called Nimbus.
00:13:42.764 - 00:14:30.500, Speaker F: And the last one that's going to be ready for Mainnet is called TecU, and that's built out of consensus. Specifically, I'm forgetting the actual branch that's out of there, but it's being funded by consensys. You have these four different clients that are going to be ready to run at Mainnet. It's going to give you that opportunity to run various clients so you don't have that one majority client. That kind of sets up that potential for centralization in the network. That gives you many different options that you can roll in and validate on the chain. So I guess those are the four main client teams that you see building right now.
00:14:30.500 - 00:14:46.278, Speaker F: There are some others as well that could come further down the line. And then obviously the Ethereum foundation has been one behind a lot of the grants for these teams and behind much of the research involved in all of Ethereum 2.0 phases.
00:14:46.446 - 00:15:26.390, Speaker C: Yeah, it's wild to me how many people are actually working on this. I think most people, looking from the outside, kind of assume that there's one team. Maybe the consensus guys are funding this, but it's obvious that there's actually multiple teams working on different parts. So now, with this introduction out of the way, I'd love to dive into some of the meat of the report itself, because there's so many different implications for Ethereum 2.0, for both other blockchains and for the existing Ethereum 1.0, and for all the developers that are building dapps on it right now. So I love to start with this point around composability, because one of Ethereum's main advantages is composability, or in other words, the ability for different apps to plug into each other.
00:15:26.390 - 00:15:59.478, Speaker C: And this makes innovation happen faster because, say I want to build a margin trading app, I can easily take parts of AavE a landing protocol, and take parts of Uniswap and exchange protocol, and hack together one relatively quickly. Now, the key concern for people seem to be that if you start splitting Ethereum into these many shards, as you would do in Ethereum 2.0, you will be giving up this compensability that powers so many apps today. So is there any research or development Ethereum that maybe addresses this? And either of you feel free to take this?
00:15:59.606 - 00:17:10.048, Speaker F: Yeah, I'll start and I'll let Ryan Chime in. So you're right. As soon as, if you want to go to a different shard, run your application on one of the different shards, or, as we'll talk about later, going into L2 technology and potentially using a roll up, you do break those bonds of composability, which is simply being able to reference another contract pretty much in the same transaction or in the same block. So kind of losing that composability effort is unfortunate. It's probably what has hindered a lot of the adoption around L2 technologies today, because they're available, they're alive, they're there. But it's kind of tough when composability is such an important part of how these Defi applications function today. So there are some potential efforts to help that maybe that could potentially help pool liquidity across different chains to help ease any sort of transaction going between the two.
00:17:10.048 - 00:18:34.374, Speaker F: So I know for one we talked about is the idea of a decentralized liquidity network like Thor chain, where you can actually pool assets between different shards or between different. Between a L2 and a layer one. That won't necessarily fix composability, but that can actually help the transition time going from one network to the next. The other one that I find relatively interesting is, and it came out of the Reddit scaling Bake off that we had over the Summer, which was a competition that pretty much let Layer two projects pitch to Reddit. Oh, here's our ability, here's our Pitch for Scaling Ethereum, and here's why you can run your Reddit community points on our network, and it's a company called Connects Network, and their technology is called Space Folds, and essentially would allow two Layer, two networks talk to each other. So that's potentially one thing in the Works that I don't know if it's going to be able to solve composability between different Shards or Layer twos now. But I know that's something that is being working on, and that's probably one of the top options, as far as, you know, if we can get there, that's probably up there as being one of the top options that could help out.
00:18:34.714 - 00:18:37.454, Speaker C: Got it. And anything to add there, Ryan?
00:18:38.714 - 00:20:06.374, Speaker E: No, I mean, I think Wilson pretty much covered all the main points about different solutions that are coming out, either to alleviate some of the. So I guess one thing that Wilson mentioned is that in this kind of like roll up centric future, where you have most applications running on roll ups and using shards as data availability layers, there will be lengthy withdrawal periods to get from a roll up back to the main chain, usually about like a week as it stands today. And in that scenario, like, you will want to have kind of these like cross chain, like market makers, either decentralized solutions like Thor chain, or centralized market makers that can kind of facilitate, you know, more instant transfers. But in the meantime, if you want to maintain composability, you'll probably have to go to the same shard. So there might be, you know, one DeFi shard that has a couple of applications that really depend on each other for composability, and for ones that you only need to use on an asynchronous basis, those will be, those can be on different roll ups or just the Ethereum main chain.
00:20:08.274 - 00:21:00.718, Speaker C: Got it. So it sounds like there are kind of market based workarounds for this issue around composability and for kind of specific types of dapps, you could also just hang around and wait for that long withdrawal period, which seems to be obviously suboptimal, but it does seem like there's efforts that are being worked on to address those. So that's quite reassuring, especially as I think a lot of the network effects for Ethereum comes from its composability. So to lose that, they need to be offering something else to replace that. And on that note, I also love to kind of touch on the process of transition itself, because it sounds like Ethereum 2.0 is a totally different blockchain. So what would the transition process actually look like for existing applications? If I were building a Defi application right now in Ethereum 1.0
00:21:00.718 - 00:21:06.914, Speaker C: and I have to transition this to 2.0, what are the things I can expect and what are the things that I might have to do right now?
00:21:07.834 - 00:22:10.324, Speaker E: Yeah, so I can start this off and then I guess Wilson can add on. But I guess the main idea is that until phase 1.5, when the ETH one chain merges into the ETH two chain, you don't really have to do anything. The way that Ethereum 2.0 was designed, or particularly that these phases were designed, was to be as minimally disruptive to the current Ethereum chain as possible. It's kind of just out of the recognition that there are hundreds of billions of dollars worth of assets on Ethereum, hundreds of billions of dollars worth of transactions every day there are tens of thousands of applications, and you don't want to make it this disruptive process. So all the, all the stuff happening on Ethereum two pane will be happening in parallel to the theorem one chain until this merger happens.
00:22:10.324 - 00:22:23.884, Speaker E: So I guess, yeah. In the meantime, nothing. And then I think Wilson can touch on what happens during that ETH 1.5, or, I'm sorry, phase 1.5 ETH one z through merger.
00:22:25.164 - 00:23:22.306, Speaker F: Yeah. So actually, from that standpoint of an application, whenever that time does come, whether it's a year and a half to three years from now, it's supposed to look relatively seamless from an application and user standpoint. So you're not going to have to do a big migration of your applications. You're not going to have to change the code in a big way. Or anyway, as far as, from what I've seen, the real main change is that, of course, you're going to have to be running a different client, so you're just going to have to change from an ETH one client to an ETH two client, and make sure you're pointing your application to the ETH two chain when the transition finally does happen. And from the standpoint that we're looking at is when the transition does happen, they would actually have to stop the chain for about an hour or maybe less. They're trying to work that time down to actually facilitate that.
00:23:22.306 - 00:24:28.594, Speaker F: So just kind of recognizing that maybe there might be a little bit of downtime and that you have to change your client and make sure you're pointing it to the right chain. So really trying to minimize the effort from applications and users on that side, that really just to kind of make it seamless. And almost as soon as you get on the other chain, you start maybe it's a little bit more efficient because you're running on this new technology. There might be a little bit of a pickup on the new chain, but the whole point about going through this process of merging into a shard is to eliminate any sort of manual effort that applications or people would have to go through to otherwise migrate from one chain to the next. Because you've seen that happen multiple times where someone launches a token on one chain and then they launch their main chain elsewhere, and then they have to go through this whole token swap process, and then maybe some people don't make it over, and so they have to go back after the deadline and make sure everyone gets through. So that's really trying to eliminate any sort of issues surrounding that.
00:24:28.714 - 00:25:12.494, Speaker A: And this 32nd intermission is brought to you by our sponsor Nexo. Depending on what type of company you're operating, Nexo can help you in different ways. As an exchange, they can be a strategic partner. As a miner, they will offer you OTC credit lines to help cover expenses, and as a crypto fund or any type of institutional counterparties, they can offer you a portfolio of structured financial products and up to 8% annual interest on your idle stablecoins, as well as asset swap agreements or direct borrowing off crypto. Individuals can also park their cash and stablecoins at Nexo's interest earning account to get an annual rate of 8%. And whats more is that you can actually claim this interest every single day and you can add or withdraw funds at any time as well. So if this sounds interesting to you, get started at Nexo IO.
00:25:12.574 - 00:25:37.772, Speaker B: This weeks episode is also brought to you by Radix if youre interested in DeFi Radix is a layer one protocol built specifically to serve DeFi. Radix focuses on speed, security and scalability, and previous iterations have delivered 1 million transactions per second. They recently raised $13 million in their token sale and have launched their liquidity incentive program as well. So head on over to radixdlt.com to.

00:25:40.548 - 00:26:16.894, Speaker B: Id also like to give a shout out to our sponsor, Bittrex Global. As someone based outside of the US, ive always been frustrated about how hard it is to invest in companies like Tesla, Google and Apple. Brokerage accounts have exorbitant fees and have terrible trading experiences. Fortunately, Bittrex Klobu is now offering tokenized stocks, which means you can invest in us stocks 24 hours a day, not just during stock market hours. You can even buy fractions of a share and manage your crypto and stock portfolio on one single exchange. I'm personally really excited about this as a user, and if you are too, sign up today for Bittrex Global using the link in the description.
00:26:17.554 - 00:26:49.906, Speaker C: And as a corollary to that, it sounds like this is maybe the most opportune time for other blockchains to come and compete with Ethereum just because there's this whole transitionary process. So do you guys see any kind of threat from other blockchains currently or as an extension to that? Is there an opportunity that applications that are building Ethereum currently don't want to transition over to Ethereum 2.0? And you maybe even see a fork of this old type of Ethereum 1.0 and Ethereum 2.0, is there a risk for that right now?
00:26:50.020 - 00:28:53.454, Speaker F: So I think you have to consider the fact that you've gone through this past DeFi summer watching transaction fees go up. Pretty high congestion on the network, reaching highs since it's 2017 ICO days, that if you're building a competing network, there has to be a bit of an opportunity there that you should be able to gain some users, there should be some leakage out to some of these other networks, and there probably will be, especially if they start building copycat applications on these other networks, whether it be Cosmos, Polkadot, Solana, and you should maybe also see some applications exploring other options. But I think a lot of what the applications that are built on Ethereum today, they value that composability, they value what Ethereum has brought to their application. And so if they're going to move anywhere, I think their most likely move is going to be up to a roll up chain, and especially ones that really feed off of each other and use each other using those composability standards, that they'll probably go up to the same roll up chain in the meantime, while you're waiting for Ethereum 2.0. So I think the real race that we're talking about is not between other chains and when Ethereum 2.0 becomes functional, it's between when do roll ups start to gain adoption versus other chains. And they're on a very similar timeline right now for when chains like Cosmos, Polkadot, Solana start to reach that level of maturity where they can start allowing applications to really communicate with each other and support a good amount of development, as well as on the other side similar timeline maturities with these roll up contracts, which should be launching within the next four to five months.
00:28:53.454 - 00:29:15.384, Speaker F: So that's how I'm kind of, I'm looking at it from that standpoint now, I don't see too many defi apps potentially moving chains more just moving up a layer. But it will be interesting to see how a lot of these other networks, maybe they ramp up their efforts and incentivization efforts to get people to start building parallel defi ecosystems.
00:29:15.844 - 00:29:34.844, Speaker C: So it sounds like there isn't too big of a threat from other blockchains, given that the timeline for some of the developments you just mentioned is to the magnitude of months and not years, whereas the full vision for Ethereum 2.0, that's the thing that's going to take years. Is that roughly the right way to summarize that?
00:29:35.004 - 00:30:33.404, Speaker F: Yeah, it's going to take a while to get there for Ethereum 2.0, but the roll ups are going to get shorten that timeline, and then it could be even more enticing once you can combine roll ups with those phase one shards and get this level of scalability that Ethereum 2.0 has been trying to achieve for all these years. And I will mention on top of that, I think a lot of these networks that are supposedly competing networks, they can be complementary in a lot of ways. And maybe there's some chains out there that end up accruing users and applications that offer different types of services. So maybe it's not a defi centric network, maybe it's more web3 based or NFT gaming based, and they can kind of plug and play as they go along. So I think there's still opportunity for where these other networks carve out a niche, but maybe it's slightly different than what Ethereum looks like now.
00:30:34.004 - 00:31:55.442, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess one thing I would add is that this is the kind of purpose of Vitalik's kind of roll up centric future post about Ethereum. And the idea is that kind of what Wilson said is the timeline for many of these competing blockchain ecosystems become competitive is very similar to Ethereum with shards and roll ups as far as when they will be able to be ready for applications to start running on them. And part of this, I won't say pivot, but this embracing of stopping potentially Ethereum 2.0 at phase 1.5 is that at that point when the ETH one chain merges into ETH two, and you have of these 64 shards of data availability layers and you have roll ups, at that point you already get probably 100,000 transactions per second, in which case there's a scalability, scalability there. And this is not something that's three years out or four years out, or whoever knows with like phase two, this is something that is potentially maybe twelve to 24 months out, where we can.
00:31:55.458 - 00:32:39.954, Speaker C: Get this scalability that makes a lot of sense. And I'd love to take this opportunity to pivot and talk about the economic model side of things as well, because you guys spent a significant part of the report on this. And I think in the report you guys mentioned that ETH itself will become more than just a fee token because currently it's used to pay for gas and that's pretty much it. But then it will also become a source of security for Ethereum as Ethereum transitions to proof of stake. So as an extension to that, I'm very curious about what you guys take are on what is the impact of this on the value of ETH? Does ETH become more important and more valuable, or is it not the right way to think about that?
00:32:41.294 - 00:33:42.614, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think that the way to think about ETH's role in Ethereum 2.0 is that ETH now becomes the most essential asset in the Ethereum ecosystem. So it's like a major upgrade to ETH as an asset. And one of the reasons why you kind of touched on the idea that now you'll be able to use ETH to stake and participate in the consensus process and as a result be able to receive a yield on that ETH. And it becomes really interesting now, probably about, I want to say three years ago, maybe four at this point. Chris Berniske wrote a paper called like ringing the bell on a new asset class for bitcoin, and he cited some work by an academic named Robert Greer about the three kind of superclasses of assets. And in that they kind of identified that there's most assets, or all assets can be categorized into three classes, stores of value, capital, assets and commodities.
00:33:42.614 - 00:34:10.680, Speaker E: This is all something that the bankless guys have touched on as well with ETH. And in ETH one, ETH is, like you said, primarily used as gas, which is kind of like a commodity, and it's also used as a store of value. People use it as collateral and DeFi applications. You use it to send payments to each other. But that's it. Now, Ethereum 2.0, because of the fact that you can stake ETH and get this native yield on it.
00:34:10.680 - 00:35:17.070, Speaker E: Well, now it has properties of a capital asset, which is kind of like an income producing asset. And it's really interesting because now you have these three properties combined in one asset that each create demand in their own directions for ETH, which is pretty interesting. And I think the analogy, especially on the commodity side, will be even more powerful when you combine ETH 2.0 with EIP 1559, which is a new proposal to restructure how users bid for block space on Ethereum. That will also have the effect of burning the majority of transaction fees extended, quite literally, will be used as fuel for transactions because it's being burned. And I think it gets really interesting at that point, and I think we can dive into this as well. But there's very interesting implications when you start getting into the monetary policy aspects of Ethereum as well, when you do have these transaction burns.
00:35:17.070 - 00:35:18.354, Speaker E: Come on, mistaken.
00:35:20.014 - 00:35:59.274, Speaker C: Yeah, I actually wanted to touch on that because I'd imagine that this is a huge question for a lot of current ETH holders or potential investors in Ethereum, or people who are just introduced to the crypto space because of this bitcoin narrative that's going on. And now they're trying to look at other things that's happening in crypto. So with theorem 2.0, as you said, people will start to earn a yield from the inflation of the Ethereum supply by staking. So it's not just the miners earning new ETH. Now anyone can basically stake their ETH tokens and earn more ETH. So will there be a new monetary policy for Ethereum, and how does it differ from what we have today? And what are the main type of considerations there are?
00:35:59.804 - 00:36:52.384, Speaker E: Yeah. So Ethereum's monetary policy can be defined as minimum necessary issuance. And the idea with this is that Ethereum will always aim to issue enough ETH to ensure that the Ethereum blockchain stays secure. Now this is something that probably to many will sound very kind of abstract and technocratic and kind of hard to define, but in practice, it's actually worked out quite well for Ethereum. I mean, there's only been two times in Ethereum's history where the monetary or issuance has changed. And each time it was to lower the issuance down to what is actually necessary. And kind of like the philosophy underpinning this monetary policy is that what Ethereum is optimizing for is security.
00:36:52.384 - 00:38:13.468, Speaker E: And this is a difference in philosophy from bitcoin, which is not optimizing for security, but it's optimizing for this kind of like monetary idealism of a fixed supply currency with a deterministic and fixed and predictable schedule. So they each have their own trade offs. On one hand, like I said with Ethereum, while you do ensure that it's always secure, the monetary policy is a little bit harder for people to grasp because of the fact that who gets decide what minimum necessary issuance is, and it's hard to quantify. And then the other side with bitcoin's monetary policy is that, yes, you get this ideal money that's fixed supply. As a consequence, you set the security budget arbitrarily because you say, hey, we're just going to issue this amount of bitcoin every year, it's going to halve every four years, and eventually there's going to be a fee market that supports the security of the network. And who knows? That works. That's a difference in philosophy, how that actually translates into Ethereum's monetary policy.
00:38:13.468 - 00:38:59.472, Speaker E: For Ethereum, 2.0. Well, in the beginning of phase zero, which hopefully is December 1, a week from now, it looks like it will be at the current deposit rates, all the issuance on the Ethereum 2.0 chain will be incremental to what's already on the Ethereum 1.0 chain. So to put some numbers behind that, right, currently, Ethereum is, the annual inflation rate is about three point eight, three point nine percent. And then depending on how much ETH is staked on the e two beacon chain, that incremental issuance could be anywhere from 0.10% to 0.80%
00:38:59.472 - 00:39:56.154, Speaker E: in the most aggressive case, where you have 20 million people or 20 million ETH staking. So combined, you're talking about probably like a 4% to a 5% annual issuance rate for Ethereum until the merger happens and ETH one is consumed into ETH two. So for the next maybe one and a half years, until that happens, when we do get the merger, Ethereum's issuance rate will actually increase. Now, where it gets interesting is when that merger does happen in phase 1.5. So, like I said, hopefully a year and a half from now. And where that's interesting is because the once incremental issuance from the beacon chain, which, like I said, could be anywhere from zero point 10% to 0.80%, that now becomes the only issuance.
00:39:56.154 - 00:41:06.272, Speaker E: And so now you're talking about Ethereum's annual inflation rate, you know, being, you know, probably, you know, well, probably, or I would almost say definitely below 1%, probably closer to, like, 0.5%. And that would be sustainable. And then probably, you know, another significant factor that affects this annual issuance rate is also the, you know, existence of EIP 1559, kind of like I talked about before. And the idea with that is that that will actually offset some of the annual issuance with the amount of ETH that's burned on a daily basis. And to put some numbers behind that, well, if you think about it, when there's 20 million ETH staked on the beacon chain, Ethereum will be issuing about 2000 ETH a day over the course of 2020. On an average day for Ethereum, about 2000 ETH transaction fees were paid every day. So if Ethereum 2.0
00:41:06.272 - 00:41:55.322, Speaker E: were to exist right now, and transaction fees were what they were today, Ethereum's net annual issuance would be basically zero. So there's a chance even that, depending on how high transactions fees get in Ethereum 2.0, that you could actually have Ethereum's net issuance actually go negative. Now, of course, the key caveat here with the transaction fees is that, well, one of the major benefits of Ethereum 2.0 is that you get more scalability. And hopefully with more scalability, that means transaction fees are lower. Because one of the key purposes of scalability is not just to keep, it's not just to allow the theorem blockchain to process more transactions for a second, but also to keep it accessible to everyday users and keep transaction fees low.
00:41:55.322 - 00:42:43.274, Speaker E: So there definitely is a chance that transaction fees aren't nearly as high on Ethereum 2.0. And this burn isn't as big as it would be using the transaction fees that Ethereum was potentially burning over the summer. But the long story is that Ethereum's annuitions rate will be probably very low Ethereum 2.0. And this could be happening very soon, within the next maybe one and a half years. And at that point you're talking about, let's say like a 0.5% annual inflation rate, that would be a percent below bitcoin at that point. So bitcoin over the next four years until it's next having its annual issuance rate will be about 1.8%.
00:42:43.274 - 00:42:51.314, Speaker E: So you're talking significantly below bitcoin once the ETH one chain gets merged into ETH two.
00:42:52.974 - 00:43:06.794, Speaker C: Wow, that's fascinating. So it sounds like the usage of Ethereum, which in turn affects the gas fees, will actually affect the monetary policy. And there is a possibility for Ethereum to become a deflationary asset if it's used enough.
00:43:07.924 - 00:43:51.048, Speaker E: Exactly. And I think that's what makes it perhaps most interesting, because it's like, yes, you have this asset that is now deflationary. One, because of the fact that with proof of stake, you can actually lower the amount of issuance that you're providing to people, securing the network. Two, because you have these transaction fees that are being burned. And now three, you know, you add in staking in the ability to earn yield on Ethereum. It's a very interesting asset. You have this really deflationary kind of monetary asset that's also kind of used as a commodity that you can also use to generate some yield on.
00:43:51.048 - 00:44:03.814, Speaker E: And I don't think there's any, I mean, I hesitate to say that it's unprecedented, but I don't think there's been anything quite like, you know, ethanol, at least how it will exist in Ethereum 2.0.
00:44:04.994 - 00:44:51.814, Speaker F: And I'll just adding on to that, I think when Ryan was talking about the way you laid it, out the different narratives and how it's very easy to grok bitcoin as being this fixed asset or has a lower inflation rate, fixed supply. And it might be a little more difficult to really understand bitcoin, ethereum's minimum necessary issuance. But as soon as it turns into either a very low issuance or potentially deflationary asset, that becomes a much stronger narrative. And whether we want to buy into them or not, narratives can be very, very strong. So that just even helps Ethereum story even more when this switch finally happens.
00:44:53.094 - 00:45:24.334, Speaker C: That's definitely a great point. I know firsthand how much people pay attention to narratives within crypto, so that's going to be interesting to see play out. And I know you guys touched on the idea of the amount staked right now, and you guys mentioned that it's very possible that we might see the first phases of Ethereum starting next week. So just as we come to the final parts of the interview, can you give us an update about what is happening? Latest on Ethereum 2.0 currently. What are the things that we can do today to help push this forward?
00:45:25.394 - 00:46:06.382, Speaker F: Yeah, so right now we are in the pre launch phase, I guess you can call it. So this contract, the deposit contract, is live. If you want to send ETH to it and claim it on the new network, you would actually become a staker and a validator on there. Obviously, the downside is you'll be have your funds locked in there until phase 1.5. There are some remedies around that that I'll hand it off to Ryan that he can get into, but that would enable you to stake on the network. So phase zero, all about staking. If you want to send your assets to this deposit contract, you'll be able to be a staker on the network.
00:46:06.382 - 00:46:49.234, Speaker F: And if it's right now, you'll be able to be a staker from Genesis. So what this means is there's a minimum amount of Ethereum that it takes to launch this new chain. So they're requiring 524,288 ETH. That's equal to about 16,300 something validators on the network to launch the chain, and that's to just give it enough validators or enough security at launch that would make them feel comfortable. So right now we're looking at, I believe, the latest. I checked it not too long ago. I think we're about 80% or a little over 80% of the way there.
00:46:49.234 - 00:47:30.850, Speaker F: So there's a remaining 20% of the necessary locked up ETH that would take to launch this chain so that minimum necessary issuance. Minimum, I'm sorry. Minimum necessary state is one parameter. The other one is the minimum genesis date, which is set right now for December 1. So one thing about the reaching that minimum launch or minimum ETH stake to launch, there's a seven day delay from when that's reached to when the chain can launch. So for us, for ETH 2.0 or the beacon chain to launch on December 1, it has to be reached.
00:47:30.850 - 00:48:11.178, Speaker F: That minimum amount of ETH stake needs to be reached by tomorrow. So November 24, that would give us seven days to December 1. I think there is a very strong chance that will happen, seeing how rapidly that amount of staked ETH is going up as of late. But if it doesn't. So if it doesn't get hit by tomorrow, then it will just start rolling over. So if that minimum staked amount gets hit on Wednesday the 25th, then we'll see the beacon chain launched on the second, and that'll just keep rolling over until we finally reach that minimum required amount. And then after that's just a stake at Genesis.
00:48:11.178 - 00:49:05.414, Speaker F: And then afterwards you can obviously be a part of the staker at any point between when the chain launches and from there on out. So if you want to be a staker and you kind of, and you have a long term investment horizon on ETH, so you're looking to hold this thing for the next five to ten years, and you're pretty low risk in your thought process. So you don't want to get involved with the next unaudited Defi application or put your assets in the pickle jar, staking might be an option for you. So you get a pretty. It's going to be variable, but you'll know, you'll get some return if you run, if you use a good validating service, or if you know that you're going to have a good amount of uptime that you. You won't lose money, you'll most likely gain some sort of.
00:49:07.714 - 00:49:08.138, Speaker C: You'll.
00:49:08.186 - 00:49:15.254, Speaker F: You'll be able to make money, some fit instead of holding it. You'll. You'll actually be able to obtain some sort of yield over time.
00:49:17.114 - 00:50:02.854, Speaker E: Yeah, I was going to say. Yeah, kind of. Like Wilson said, the easiest thing people can do to help take this over line would be to, to simply deposit ETH into the contract. But I think one hesitancy we can actually touch on this as well, that people have is. That is the illiquidity. So when you deposit your ETH into deposit contract to stake your ETH will be locked up until the ETH one chain merges into ETH two into e two chain. And while estimates are that that could be anywhere from, let's say, twelve to 36 months, I mean, practically speaking, you're locking up your ETH indefinitely.
00:50:02.854 - 00:51:18.010, Speaker E: So there have been, you know, some solutions that have come out already that allow people to get liquidity on their ETH. So one example would be liquid stakeholder. And basically what they like to do is if you stake through liquid stake, they will allow you to borrow USCC against your ETH so you can get some liquidity and then kind of like another category of, I guess, liquidity solutions that, although are very early right now, but will probably be very fully fleshed out in the coming months, are ETH derivatives. And those could be ETH derivatives issued by exchanges, by staking in the service providers, by decentralized staking protocols. But the main idea is that you'll be able to stake your ETH through one of these providers or protocols. They will issue you an ETH derivative that will be a claim on the underlying ETH, and then you can use that ETH derivative as if it's any other asset on Ethereum. Right.
00:51:18.010 - 00:51:42.604, Speaker E: So doing theory, Makerdao could integrate this derivative ETH and you can borrow against it. Same thing with compound can provide liquidity in uniswap, et cetera. So that's probably the most exciting of the liquidity solutions. But like I said, haven't seen a full blown solution. It's live right now, although they are coming shortly.
00:51:44.104 - 00:52:04.048, Speaker C: Yeah. And I have my theories about just how this e through my trade, I think there might be some sort of a discount or premium, depending on how you think about it. But that's definitely scope for another whole discussion. So I would like to first of all, say thank you so much for you guys for coming onto this show. This has been a true delight to talk to you guys, and obviously, I follow you guys and your work.
00:52:04.096 - 00:52:05.800, Speaker D: But for those of us who haven't.
00:52:05.832 - 00:52:13.334, Speaker C: Started following you yet, I'll give you a chance here to kind of plug your own channels. What are the best ways to keep up to date with what you guys are working on?
00:52:13.754 - 00:52:30.494, Speaker E: Yeah, so I guess both Wilson and I write on a weekly basis for Masari, so you can catch us at Masari IO, and then I'm pretty active on Twitter, so you can catch me at Ryan Watkins on Twitter and tweet every day.
00:52:31.954 - 00:52:57.020, Speaker F: Yeah. So like you said, mosara IO, best place to see my stuff on Twitter. I'm wilsonwithiam I'm not as active working, work my way there, but definitely, definitely tuned in to everything that's going on, every tweet a lot, so. But reach out anytime. I think it's great to connect with a lot of people that are new or have been around a while in this industry.
00:52:57.172 - 00:52:59.892, Speaker C: Absolutely. Well, thanks again, guys, for coming on the show.
00:53:00.028 - 00:53:01.704, Speaker E: Yeah, of course. Thanks for having us on.
00:53:02.084 - 00:53:03.604, Speaker F: Thanks so much, Jason. This is a lot of fun.
