00:00:01.000 - 00:00:32.348, Speaker A: You're now listening to Alpha Leak, a podcast mini series highlighting the most under the radar projects and developments in crypto, and this series is brought to you by the Blockcrunch podcast. I'm your host, Jason Choi. I'm a general partner at Spartan Capital and an active defi angel investor. Nothing on this show should be construed as financial advice, and my guests, myself, and my employer may hold positions and assets discussed on the show. And if you'd like for your project to be featured on this series, reach out to me on Twitter mrjasonchoi. This episode is brought to you by Crypto.com aave and Figment.
00:00:32.348 - 00:01:32.938, Speaker A: Stick around to learn more. And in this week's episode, we're going to be talking to a project called Olympusdao, which is a new algorithmic currency protocol. Now, I know a lot of people are confused about just what Algo stablecoins are or what Algo currencies are, so we actually did a two part series with Ben Simons from mechanism Capital, where we break down the major categories of all of the algorithmic currencies out there, as well as the trade offs between different projects. So if you want that primer before diving into today's episode, you can go back to episodes 128 and 129 where you hear Ben explain all of this. Now, for this specific episode, we're going to be diving into just how Olympusdao works and how it differs from the other algorithmic currency projects out there. And I'm really excited to have the team Zeus and Apollo, the pseudonymous developers behind Olympusdao, to come on to explain why they decided to have the Olympus Dao token not pegged to a dollar, but actually leave it up to the market to decide what to peg it to. And I do grow them hard on what the use cases are for something like this.
00:01:32.938 - 00:01:41.574, Speaker A: Now, if there are other under the radar projects or new projects that you'd like to hear me talk to on Alpha leak, definitely reach out to me on Twitter mrjasonchoi.
00:01:41.954 - 00:01:57.114, Speaker B: All right, hey everybody. I am super excited to once again have two anonymous developers on the show, and you guys are probably the third anonymous developer that we had in the past month on the show. So I'm really excited. But welcome, Apollo and Zeus.
00:01:58.094 - 00:01:59.310, Speaker C: Hey, great to be here.
00:01:59.422 - 00:02:00.994, Speaker D: Great to be here. Thank you.
00:02:01.934 - 00:02:20.558, Speaker B: And this is always a tricky part because I don't want to dox anybody, but just to give the context for who you guys are to listeners, can you maybe share some color about just what you guys were working on before and before starting Olympus style, yeah, I study economics.
00:02:20.646 - 00:02:44.594, Speaker C: I've done some stuff in entrepreneurship, but I'm a trader, I'm an econ guy. I like to think that I'm just as much of a dj as a lot of the people that hang around in our chats. And I'm very crypto native and young, so I don't have too long of a. Yeah, yeah.
00:02:46.294 - 00:03:29.344, Speaker D: I have a little longer background. I'm an engineer by training and have been coding all my life since I was 13. Run all the.com bubble from 95 to whatever, 2004 and launched a quantitative trading algorithmic strategy. Ran a hedge fund for some time and then discovered crypto in 2013 or twelve. Did some mining, did some trading and got fully into blockchain projects like three years ago between trading and investing itself.
00:03:31.164 - 00:03:57.734, Speaker B: Very cool. Now you guys are working on Olympus style, which is a new project that just launched last week. And this is something in the algorithmic stablecoin space which listeners of the show might be familiar with if they had listened to our two part explanation of what algo stablecoins are. But before we dive into the mechanism, can you guys give us a high level overview of just what you guys are trying to achieve with Olympus style and what is the target market that you guys are trying to break into?
00:03:58.554 - 00:04:33.834, Speaker C: Yeah, so we are trying to build a floating algorithmic currency. So a currency that is stable but is not pegged to anything, you know, kind of with the assumption that or idea that, you know, pegging to the dollar is not, it's a pretty short term solution because, you know, you're pegging to something that is floating and you can, you can stay at a dollar, but the dollar is going to change in value and it would be more useful to, and like for longevity to have a currency that serves this. Like can be the actual dollar, you know?
00:04:35.854 - 00:04:46.074, Speaker B: Absolutely. So it sounds like this is not going to be a algorithmic stablecoin, but rather it's going to be a algorithmic rebalancing coin that's pegged to some sort of value.
00:04:46.774 - 00:05:12.214, Speaker C: Yeah, so we don't have a peg. Instead we have multiple supply and kind of like forward guidance incentive structures set up to try and push volume in both the buy and sell side of the market and basically let the market choose what the price is, but then help and facilitate stabilizing at that price.
00:05:13.754 - 00:05:25.934, Speaker B: That's really interesting and there's a lot to unpack there. But before we kind of understand that, I know there's also a collateralization element where there is a pool of Dai. Right. Now that's used to collateralize the token, is that right?
00:05:26.724 - 00:05:29.924, Speaker C: Yeah. So basically you want to go ahead.
00:05:30.084 - 00:05:56.034, Speaker D: Yeah. In a nutshell, it intends to work like a central bank should work, and that collateralization is the reserves that the algorithm have. That is the collateral that's needed to defend peg value if the currency tanks, right?
00:05:56.694 - 00:06:39.106, Speaker C: Yeah. That also provides us with a supply constraint. So, like in the case of bitcoin, the supply constraint is time, where you have a set emission schedule and you know what the supply will be based on, you know, the amount of time that has passed. In our case, it is the amount of reserves that we can raise. So we can't just print money, you know, like, as much as we want. We need to be able to back what we print, which gives that constraint of, you know, you need to be able to back, like, you literally need to be able to back what you print, you know, which is important, you know, especially in the long term, with ensuring that, you know, you're not debasing the currency ever. You're always playing within the rules.
00:06:39.106 - 00:06:46.244, Speaker C: It's just, you know, whatever debasement is, reduction of a premium on the market if there is debasement.
00:06:48.384 - 00:06:48.696, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:06:48.720 - 00:07:01.844, Speaker B: So let's unpack that a little bit. So how does the protocol know how much collateral it needs to back the value of the algorithmic coin? If the algorithmic coin is not back to anything, there's no kind of objective value for how much it should be worth.
00:07:03.064 - 00:07:41.032, Speaker C: Yes. So we have two main mechanisms. The first one will be bonds, although I think it's easier to conceptualize with the sales. So basically, we pull a moving average of the market price of the token, and it uses that to compute how much it should sell during the day, or sell or buy. So if it's on the market and it's overvalued, you know, it's backed by a dollar, but it's trading at greater than a dollar. That will tell it, okay, I should be selling into the market because this is overvalued, and I can raise more money by selling this than I have to use to back the tokens. So it serves two purposes.
00:07:41.032 - 00:08:40.073, Speaker C: One is to produce new supply, and it also produces profits when it does so. Because if it sells it at $10 and it needs to back with $1, it sells one token, it brings in $10, it backs the token, it sold with one, and then it has $9 leftover, and it uses those $9 to make nine more. But then it has the choice of what to do with those ones, um, and bonds will do a similar thing, but they will do it with liquidity provider shares. Um, and that one I think is really cool. We can actually value those liquidity provider shares in DAI in a constant value where the protocol sees the LP share as a single asset pool. So an OhM DAi LP, in its mind, is the exact same asset, and all it cares about is how many of them there are in there. And you can find a minimum value for that, which is actually when the pool is balanced.
00:08:40.073 - 00:08:49.553, Speaker C: But in both cases, it can say with certainty how much money it has brought in to back tokens. That reserve amount never changes.
00:08:51.213 - 00:09:21.644, Speaker D: To add to that, when the protocol is selling above the par value, that profit is then distributed on a 90 ten profit ratio among the community of stakers. So this also creates an incentive for holders of the currency not to be trading it or dumping it, but instead taking liquidity out of the market.
00:09:22.904 - 00:09:25.616, Speaker C: Yeah, what we want to aim, what.
00:09:25.640 - 00:09:30.924, Speaker E: We want to aim for is that the protocol is the only or primary counterparty in the market at all times.
00:09:32.424 - 00:09:59.284, Speaker B: And I think I should have probably brought this up before, but just to take a step back here so our listeners fully grasp what you're explaining here. So, basically, there is an Algol currency that it's not supposed to be pegged to anything, so the market decides its value, but if it trades above $1, the protocol will mint and sell this token. But if, if it trades below a dollar, then it buys back and burns the token. Doesn't that automatically kind of peg it to a dollar?
00:10:01.064 - 00:10:14.784, Speaker E: It depends on the amount at which you do so. So if you're going to, you know, if we were having the protocol, you know, do it at a very high volume, then yes, it would peg it at a dollar, but at a low.
00:10:14.824 - 00:10:58.934, Speaker C: Volume that, you know, there's nothing that actually, like, you know, USDC is not stable at a dollar because everyone knows that there's a dollar in a bank account for it, and so they only traded at a dollar. It's there because people can mint or redeem it. You know, it's on institutional level, but people can mint or redeem it for a dollar at all times. And so anytime it trades for not a dollar, someone can go capture the spread and they can buy it for less than a dollar, they can go to circle and they can get a dollar for it. In our case, we know we constrain the amount that you can do that, and whatever the profit was that would have produced doesn't go to the person that, you know, made that trade, it goes to the protocol, and then the protocol decides what to do with it.
00:11:01.114 - 00:11:05.054, Speaker B: And when you say constraints, can you unpack that a little bit? What do you mean by that?
00:11:08.074 - 00:11:33.834, Speaker C: You know, so basically, our goal is not to bring the price back to a dollar ever. It's to profit off of the difference. So in a normal market, without forces to push it back to a dollar, where you're actually trying to, there's no reason why it ever has to. So, like, you know, as an example, you know, we're. Our tokens are backed by dollar right now. They're not trading for a dollar. You know.
00:11:35.854 - 00:11:36.262, Speaker E: If.
00:11:36.318 - 00:12:30.904, Speaker C: Unless you put actual structures in place to push it back to a dollar, like, there's no reason, you know, this is why algorithmic stable coins don't trade for a dollar, is that unless you have very strong systems in place to keep it there, it won't stay there. So, you know, we take the stance of it's very hard to do, and so why even try? Instead, we can take that dynamic and use it to create a very profitable system that eventually, if you align structures, you can. What we're searching for is a balance on the buy and sell side of the market. And where that balance comes or, like, where that balance ends up might be a dollar, it could be $2, it could be, you know, whatever amount. But, you know, we're not, we're not trying to choose that price. We're just trying to facilitate stabilizing at it, if that makes sense. And I'm sorry that I go into the weeds on these things and I try not to, but, you know, it's.
00:12:30.944 - 00:12:33.440, Speaker E: It's hard because I think it's cool. Yeah.
00:12:33.472 - 00:12:46.764, Speaker B: Doors, I'm just to kind of pull back a little bit. So when you say you, you design a profitable system that profits off the difference between the algo currency and the underlying collateral. Who is profiting here? So who's pocketing the profits?
00:12:48.144 - 00:13:19.852, Speaker C: Primarily the protocol. So if you look at something like ESD or DSD, you had all of these activities that were done by third parties to facilitate the actions that they wanted to be taken. Right. And that was a very, very profitable game. But you, when you offload those things to third parties, you end up with value drain because people will take those profits and then they'll pull them out of the system. In our case, the protocol is the one that gets to do those things. It shares those profits as it likes to.
00:13:19.852 - 00:13:32.714, Speaker C: But at the end of the day, the actual assets that were raised stay with the protocol and so you can leave, you can sell your tokens. It doesn't care. It still has the actual money. You can sell the OHM token. It still has the die.
00:13:34.494 - 00:13:40.194, Speaker B: So can you walk me through the process of how the protocol profits off a trade? Using an example?
00:13:41.454 - 00:13:53.350, Speaker C: Yeah. So if we're trading at, you know, the twap that the protocol is reading on. So if the price that the protocol sees is $10, it will, look, it'll.
00:13:53.382 - 00:13:58.810, Speaker E: Say, these are trading at a 900% premium to what I need to back them with.
00:13:58.882 - 00:13:59.138, Speaker C: Right?
00:13:59.186 - 00:14:36.190, Speaker E: So I need to back them with a dollar. They're 900% above that. I will compute that I need to because it's 900%. Sell half a percent of supply into the market today based on just an algorithm or an equation that tells it how much to sell. It will, on our website, there will be a portal that allows people to buy from the protocol, and it will, you know, basically it works like one inch where either you, you try to.
00:14:36.222 - 00:15:04.674, Speaker C: Buy in the protocol to see, okay, am I selling? If it's not selling, it'll just send you straight to sushiswap. And it's like you just went there, you know, in the first place. If it is selling, it'll sell them to you directly and it'll give you a little bit of a discount for them. And so there's a little incentive to just always use our swaps instead of going straight to the market. But it will sell you those tokens at $10. It backs the tokens it sold, and then it has $9 per token left over. And that is the protocol's profits.
00:15:06.974 - 00:15:13.474, Speaker B: And the buyers of those tokens, those would be users who are buying these tokens at a discount to market or.
00:15:14.394 - 00:15:18.450, Speaker E: Yeah, a slight enough discount that it's worthwhile to, you know, go to us.
00:15:18.482 - 00:15:20.494, Speaker C: Instead of the market, but not more than that.
00:15:20.874 - 00:15:22.946, Speaker E: But yes, you know, like demand that.
00:15:22.970 - 00:15:25.386, Speaker C: Would otherwise be buying from the market.
00:15:25.490 - 00:15:27.650, Speaker E: Or supply that would otherwise be selling.
00:15:27.802 - 00:15:47.874, Speaker D: Yeah, it get can be users that are looking to get a piece of that profit. So they buy either from the market or from the protocol, and then can stake it and then have rights to participate in the Dow plus a share of the profit that is distributed on every epoch.
00:15:48.894 - 00:16:14.944, Speaker B: Got it. So just so we completely understand this, so if the algo currency is trading at a significant premium to the underlying collateral, the protocol will then mint new tokens at a slight discount to market price and then sell those tokens to, to users. So basically like a senior age model. And then the protocol would then pocket those profits and store them in a dow or in a treasury or vault.
00:16:15.524 - 00:16:16.784, Speaker C: Precisely, yeah.
00:16:17.644 - 00:16:51.144, Speaker B: Understood. And what was the decision behind going for a non dollar pack? Because obviously, with something like, with stable coins like Dai and USDC and USDT, it's cognitively very easy for someone to wrap their heads around because everybody's trading against USD. Everybody denominates their net worth or their trades or the transactions in USD. But you guys are creating a fundamentally new currency with its own monetary policy and an undefined value. So how do you build the narrative around that? And how do you build consensus around that?
00:16:52.364 - 00:17:23.220, Speaker E: Yeah, so, I mean, that's what we're trying to find out. You know, the. The motivation behind it is definitely that, you know, especially in crypto, I don't think that most people think that we're going into a dollar denominated world. You know, we have been living in one, but the future seems like it's going to be something else. And, you know, some people believe it's bitcoin. I personally don't think that bitcoin has any characteristics to ever serve as a currency. I think that it's a fantastic money and an asset, and I, you know, I think it would be a great backing for a currency.
00:17:23.220 - 00:17:51.184, Speaker E: But a currency is something completely different. And there's not really anything trying to tackle this, actually, there. We're among a cohort of new. Of new projects that are taking on this issue. But really it comes down to, if we're not going to live in a dollar denominated world and we're not going to live in a government or like, you know, sovereign currency denominated world, what will we be living in? Yeah, hopefully it's nome denominated world.
00:17:52.244 - 00:18:19.040, Speaker D: It's also true that since 1971, when the gold standard was taken off and dollar has been being printed and devalued for 30, 40 plus years, issuing a currency that the underlying is a currency that has no underlying per se, just printing it makes a new currency a little weak.
00:18:19.112 - 00:18:19.320, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:19.352 - 00:18:55.472, Speaker D: So you need something else to back it up. We could use bitcoin. That actually original design was, why don't we try using bitcoin as money and our token as a currency? And then we say, okay, let's start with this current model, and then we can start adding other kinds of reserves to the system to back the token. But dollar would be looking at charts of devaluations since 1971 to date. You would say, this doesn't seem to be a long term currency that can hold value.
00:18:55.648 - 00:19:28.170, Speaker A: Now, before I continue, I'd like to take a moment to share some exciting companies that made this podcast possible. If you're holding crypto but not using crypto.com comma, you're missing out because you could be earning 8.5% more on your bitcoin and 14% per annum on your stablecoins, paid out every week.

00:20:05.874 - 00:20:48.044, Speaker A: Aave is a non custodial liquidity protocol, meaning you can earn interest on your crypto or borrow crypto assets without trusting any centralized counterparty to hold your funds. I personally have been using Aave for a long time to earn up to 12% of my USD holdings like USDC USDT or even decentralized stablecoins like Dai or exchange stablecoins like Binance USD, which totally blows my bank out the water. And if you're new to crypto and worried about security, Aave has been audited by security firms 13 times in 2020 alone and once already this year, which they disclosed fully. So I'm really excited to have a product that I love as a sponsor. So go on over to aave.com aave.com to check out which of the assets you'd like to borrow and lend today.
00:20:48.344 - 00:21:35.414, Speaker B: We've seen projects try to go after the same mission or market before, and one of the earliest ones is ampleforth where their initial pitch was actually to create this sound money that is not pegged to a dollar, but it rebases and it could be maybe pegged to a CPI but it really depends on the market. But what we saw in actuality after Ampleforth launched was that it almost devolved into this Ponzi money game where people were just speculating on the rebasing mechanism to try to make money off of that. And it seems to not have been able to get any major market adoption outside of the speculative crowd yet. So how do you prevent Olympus Tao and its token alm from devolving into some kind of speculative gambling game?
00:21:37.354 - 00:22:28.144, Speaker E: So we don't, you know, I think that anything like this has to start through a speculative craze. I think that that enriching people is the greatest way to make them become, you know, a supporter of it and push adoption of something. So, you know, you've seen in bitcoin and bitcoin is probably the closest thing you'll, you can find today to, you know, what we're trying to take on. The difference between this and someone like Ampleforth is that when, when the bubble pops, there's something left over. You know, so it's taken in all of this money and you know, that money doesn't really leave even when it starts doing the buybacks, it buys back only a small portion of supply over, you know, a day or like over spans of time. And it does so at a discount. So it mathematically can never end up with no money left.
00:22:28.144 - 00:22:58.622, Speaker E: You know, it's kind of designed where we can have boom and bust cycles and we actually like want to have boom and bust cycles at first, but each time we end up at a greater point than we started with. And we have policy tools where right now we have very loose policy which facilitates that in the future we can tighten that policy and it becomes harder and harder to have boom and bus. It becomes less profitable, but it facilitates.
00:22:58.678 - 00:23:00.394, Speaker C: More real world use.
00:23:03.614 - 00:23:21.234, Speaker B: Currently Olympus ohm is trading at about $400. So obviously it's not pegging to a dollar here. Can you guys share maybe some numbers around traction? So how much collateral is there in the system right now? How fast did it grow? Did it surprise you guys?
00:23:23.034 - 00:23:23.386, Speaker C: Yes.
00:23:23.410 - 00:23:50.174, Speaker E: So we, it's a little weird. You know, I did not expect the amount of enthusiasm and demand that we've had so far. So, like, you know, none of my models showed us trading at $400. So I don't have the strongest answer. We do have about $200,000. Our supply is 68,000. And so, you know, only 68,000 is currently in the system.
00:23:50.174 - 00:24:51.650, Speaker E: We are rolling out bonds after our audit completes in hopefully around a week or so. And at that point, we will actually start taking in new funds to grow supply. And so the price right now is basically, it's reflecting a market cap and not really a price. Right. Because if you stake in you, basically it's like a senior age model where you maintain your, roughly your ownership stake in the network. And so supply will grow but your balance will grow at, you know, it depends on how many people are staked, but roughly the same amount as supply. And so, you know, if we were to have reserves grow from 68,000 to 24 million, but between that go from four hundred dollars to one dollar, the net difference is zero in terms of actual value.
00:24:51.650 - 00:24:55.814, Speaker E: It's actually much better because now that thing is trading at par and you have no downside.
00:24:58.634 - 00:25:04.294, Speaker B: So just to clarify, you mentioned there's $200,000 in collateral backing ohm right now.
00:25:05.434 - 00:26:16.014, Speaker E: No. So we have $200,000 in. In 68,000 of it is currently in the treasury vault backing the tokens. The other 130 something, or I think it's 150, is with the DAO and will be over the next. I think it's three months or so, will be phased into the system kind of to kickstart things, especially while we don't have the bonds or sales going right now. So right now is definitely a supply distribution event where we're doing price discovery and allowing supply to distribute itself among people because we did a launch event where it was offered at a very low price to just people, our early community, now that supply is being distributed around who actually wants it. And that kind of facilitates this early increase in supply because, you know, especially right now, you know, going from 68,000 to, you know, even mil, like a million is a very significant increase in supply.
00:26:16.014 - 00:26:52.754, Speaker E: And we're helping to facilitate, you know, introducing how quickly supply can increase because, I don't know. I'm definitely excited to see how it goes because it should be something unlike a lot of things, I guess, if we're part of ESD or ample, you're used to supply increasing by exponentially increasing. Those are sitting on the sidelines to start to kick that off.
00:26:54.384 - 00:27:17.244, Speaker B: So just to piggyback off of that, because how important, really is the collateral backing the system, given that there's $68,000 worth of collateral right now and the market cap of OHM is, I think, close to 27 or 30 million right now. So basically, 99% of it is unbacked by collateral. Is that a right way to think about it?
00:27:19.034 - 00:28:10.126, Speaker E: I mean, yes. So right now, you know, really it's insignificant. You know, I've said this to people in the community. I'm very open about it. You know, it kind of comes with the fact that early on here where it's. This is a speculative phase, you know, I consider it a growth phase and with growth in speculation, but it becomes very, very, very important in the future, you know, so if you, if we realize this long term vision, um, that is the constraint that prevents anyone from debasing this currency because the value of it on the market, the actual like, purchasing power of it, can change, but the underlying value of it is constant, you know, now and forever. Um, I guess when we, if we are to change the reserve assets, it can change, but that is a governance decision.
00:28:10.126 - 00:28:37.254, Speaker E: And um, barring those changes, the intrinsic value remains constant, which, you know, is important because it provides this constraint to producing new supply of. Okay, you can do that, but where are you going to get the money to create the currency? So, you know, if you imagine the, the fed needed to buy gold to mint every dollar, you know, they probably wouldn't have printed $10 trillion this year.
00:28:38.494 - 00:29:04.754, Speaker B: Right, right. I guess that's a funny analogy. And I'm also curious. So this is probably a question that all of the token degens or the defi natives are thinking out there. How does the OHM token itself accrue value over time? Or is this very much meant to be a token where you need to be actively kind of trading the boom and bust cycles? Or can you get exposure to the growth of Olympus by just holding the OhM token?
00:29:06.024 - 00:29:14.644, Speaker E: Stake and forget I'm a bitcoin holder and just stake and forget, just like you would buy bitcoin and hold hodl.
00:29:16.184 - 00:29:20.084, Speaker B: So very much a bet on the growth of the home ecosystem, basically.
00:29:20.544 - 00:29:20.904, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:20.944 - 00:29:59.884, Speaker D: Which actually one could assume that part of the premium that the token is currently trading at is a discount of expected gains people might have on the accrual of value that the token will have when you stake it. It's not currently in yet. We launched it like 6 hours ago or less with some reward system. But as Suzu was saying, stake, forget. And then no matter rallies or no rallies of price, will still be staking and getting a piece of the profit that the protocol is making.
00:30:00.944 - 00:30:02.400, Speaker E: Yeah, pretty much, you know, no matter.
00:30:02.432 - 00:30:03.656, Speaker C: What it does, whether it, you know.
00:30:03.680 - 00:30:49.754, Speaker E: It'S undervalued, it's overvalued your balance, you know, as long as we're not trading perfectly at par, your balance is increasing by some amount, you know, very much designed to correct. What I saw was an issue with senior age models where they just required far too much action and participation, that it's, you know, it's unreasonable to expect that to last for anything longer than a speculative phase. In this case, you know, what I will personally be doing is just locking these things, staking them, locking them up and forgetting about them. It's a bet on if we are successful, I will come back with thousands of times more tokens than I started with. And if not, that's how a moon bag works.
00:30:51.994 - 00:31:13.414, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So I guess on that note, what would success look like to you? Because obviously there is the early speculative phase, as you mentioned, which is required to bootstrap any network with liquidity and adoption, but other kind of use cases beyond the money game. And if so, what are the types of people that you envision using ohm as an actual currency in the future?
00:31:15.074 - 00:31:26.710, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think that we would work, it's interesting with the underlying value, right? Because basically, you know, how I want.
00:31:26.742 - 00:31:28.550, Speaker C: This to work in the future is.
00:31:28.702 - 00:32:31.654, Speaker E: That that intrinsic value becomes like money that you're owed. So it's not money that you own, but you have a claim on it. And so you could, you know, take your own and you hold on to your own, but you can take those underlying assets and go put them somewhere else. So it becomes this, like guaranteed loan for you at any time. You know, that has a lot of use cases in, you know, just kind of like, I guess, facilitation of like, capital efficiency where, you know, you can kind of have your, have your cake and eat it too. You know, I think there's a lot of things with, you know, basically new primitives that can arise from this because, you know, reserve backed. I'll give you an example, which is, you know, if we were to release a token that is redeemable for ohm but doesn't have the backing, and so you can provide that backing and you can mint the token.
00:32:31.654 - 00:33:27.808, Speaker E: That token is now skewed from the price of ohm by whatever the intrinsic value is, but we'll move with the same, you know, dollar amount. I guess that's much more in facilitation of stability and that you create an arbitrage there that drives volume and helps to stabilize price. In terms of use case, I guess it comes down to what do you use dollars for? What do you use a currency for? You use it for everything else. It becomes this base level thing that you don't even think about, you know, why am I using this? It's just what you use. You know, the really important thing that we're trying to solve is like something that you can quote prices in in the future with confidence.
00:33:27.936 - 00:33:28.392, Speaker C: Right?
00:33:28.488 - 00:34:14.854, Speaker E: So can I. Can you make a contract denominated in bitcoin for five years from today? I don't think that there's anyone in their right mind who would do that because you have no idea what you will be paying in our case. You know, you can, you know, once we're at lower premiums, because, you know, it. It definitely will not remain at these high premiums. You know, that should be supplemented by supply growth. That kind of balances things out. But, you know, in the future, you will be able to quote a price in Ohm for years from that day or days from that day, whatever, have relative confidence that it will remain that price, even though people could be holding it and have appreciated in the background.
00:34:14.854 - 00:34:48.544, Speaker E: It's just that their appreciation happened through supply growth and not through price growth, you know? So we defer that to supply instead of price because, you know, it, you can actually facilitate, like, currency use through that other than, you know, something that just goes in a straight line up forever on the long term scale. Like, that doesn't work as a currency. I don't know. It would be disastrous, I think, if we were lived in a bitcoin world right now on a large scale.
00:34:50.044 - 00:35:00.984, Speaker B: So it sounds like the roadmap or the value accrual for the Ohm token is dependent on almost the world, or at least a part of the world, recognizing it as some sort of currency. Right?
00:35:02.384 - 00:35:03.564, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:35:04.624 - 00:35:12.864, Speaker E: That is the goal. And so, you know, if that doesn't happen, you know, we can do other things, but, like, the underlying goal would have, you know, not been successful.
00:35:12.904 - 00:35:14.104, Speaker C: Yes. Yeah.
00:35:14.144 - 00:36:09.728, Speaker D: And I think we have to think of it in stages, right? So the current stage at which it's trading at this very high premium, we cannot imagine this working as a currency. Right? Yeah, because, yeah, it would be like doing a long term contract assuming $430 or $400 a norm, and within three years from now, supply grew, price is closer to par. And that's where this can be taken as a currency. Right now, I would say it's more like a yielding instrument that one can buy. There's profit between the intrinsic value and the t watt value that it's trading, and that profit is generating some yields to the holders. So in the short term, the best strategy is buy and stake, right? Not use it as a currency because price will fluctuate. There's no question about that.
00:36:09.728 - 00:36:15.684, Speaker D: But long term, if we achieve our goal, yes, it should be a very stable currency.
00:36:16.184 - 00:36:16.512, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:16.528 - 00:37:02.854, Speaker E: And a lot of that comes down to social consensus. Right. So the dollar only has value not because that it only comes from the fact that we socially have decided that the dollar has value. Right. You know, that's the same with gold, it's the same with bitcoin, it's the same with whatever, you know, it's just that we, we are like animals who just pick something and say, this is a value, you know? So I do think, you know, it comes down to community. I've tried really hard to like cultivate a good community because, you know, you, you just need to instill belief in people and, you know, if you can do that, you know, you don't really have to do anything else because it's so arbitrary that it just comes down to what people choose to believe in.
00:37:04.674 - 00:37:34.334, Speaker B: Yeah, that's definitely, that's the type of kind of aspiration that really inspires me in crypto is, is the kind of size, the scale of the vision that the founders have. So this is, this is definitely going to be an interesting experiment that I'm really excited to check out. But for the interest of time, for people who want to dive deeper into just how Olympus works and want to stay up to date with the latest, I know that it's just launched, so there's a lot happening. What would you say are the best channels for them to do this?
00:37:35.834 - 00:37:54.204, Speaker E: Yeah. So for like high level information and updates, our Twitter place is a great place for information, our medium. And if you want to get involved, please join our discord. Awesome in there. Our community is amazing and I love them and we would love to have you.
00:37:55.544 - 00:38:09.644, Speaker B: Absolutely. And as one final question, because this is part of the Alpha League series where we shine a light on newer projects and up and coming projects, what would you say is one relatively under the radar project that you're excited about, if any comes to mind for both of you?
00:38:12.384 - 00:38:49.764, Speaker E: I mean, I would say Rari capital, but they're not under the radar anymore. I was there when no one knew about them. So I don't know know if that means anything. Also, one of our, you know, developers on our team started a project called Non Fungible yearn, which I think is awesome what they're doing there, you know, with wrapping yielding assets into nfts that, you know, can facilitate trading of baskets of assets. Cool stuff there. You know, he's a great guy and he has a lot of, a lot of great ideas as well. So I don't know, I will definitely be keeping up to date with what they're doing over there as well.
00:38:51.264 - 00:38:52.604, Speaker B: What about you, Apollo?
00:38:54.984 - 00:39:23.464, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that there's one project that I'm following closely. It's called Crown Sterling that's proposing a new kind of encryption algorithm. So it's more like a low level kind of technology that can be applied across the industry. They are in their early stages, so something to watch.
00:39:24.284 - 00:39:31.224, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Well, thank you for that advice, and once again, thank you so much for taking the time to come on the show. This has been really educational.
00:39:31.844 - 00:39:32.860, Speaker E: Thank you for having us.
00:39:32.892 - 00:39:34.164, Speaker D: Thank you. Thank you for having us.
