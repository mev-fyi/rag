00:00:00.280 - 00:00:55.464, Speaker A: Deepin is effectively creating decentralized networks around physical infrastructure. So, for instance, this is things like filecoin, where you have people providing excess capacity for storage in a decentralized network for people who want to access the storage, or things like a cache where people are providing excess capacity from their h 100 or a 100 gpu's for people to render AI models and so on. So this core concept of using blockchain networks to coordinate decentralized physical resources. So I'll talk about why people think this won't work, and then I'm curious what you think. So the reason why some people think these don't work is because of the cost involved with running these networks. So the reason why Amazon Web Services has all their data centers in one place is because of economies of scale. It gets cheaper for each marginal unit.
