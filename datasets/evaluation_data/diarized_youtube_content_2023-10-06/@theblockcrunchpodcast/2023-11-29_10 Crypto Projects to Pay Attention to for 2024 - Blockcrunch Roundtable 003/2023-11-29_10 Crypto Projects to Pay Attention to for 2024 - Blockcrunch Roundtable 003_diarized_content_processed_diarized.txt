00:00:00.160 - 00:00:20.590, Speaker A: One thing I will say is that, like, I think oracles are a little overvalued. I don't really understand why Chainlink trades at $14 billion. Chainlink has been around for a long time. There are link marines. I don't really understand what the supply and liquidity dynamics are, but Chainlink does not make enough money to be worth $14 billion. Web Three offers a brand new petri dish. Our job is to buy great tech at great prices.
00:00:20.662 - 00:00:24.990, Speaker B: AI is also libertarian right enable use case that people haven't been able to do today.
00:00:25.062 - 00:00:28.670, Speaker A: The next hundreds of millions of players, they will come to the market through mobile.
00:00:28.742 - 00:00:56.662, Speaker B: My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next twelve months is all right. Good morning, everybody. Or evening or afternoon, wherever you are. Welcome back to another episode of the Block Crunch podcast. This is our third roundtable session with my buddy Sanad from Dragonfly Capital. My name is Jason Choi. I am an angel in crypto and I'm also the co founder of Tangent, our angel fund.
00:00:56.662 - 00:01:54.272, Speaker B: So this episode is going to be interesting because we are going to do our most definitive liquid market picks. And I do this with air quotes for those watching this on video because we're not providing any financial advice. No, we're not creating a list of ten tokens you should buy now list. This is more of a these are the ten most interesting or structurally significant projects with some discretion added for interesting ones that may be less discussed across different verticals. And the inspiration for this is actually from my co founder Darrell at Tangent, who put out this tweet and you can look at the screen. For those of you watching this on YouTube, this tweet is basically asking for people to pick one ticker or one public project under each major vertical in crypto from NFTs alternative l one s l two s derivative, DeXs, AI, gambling, Dpin, oracles, and memes. So I thought this was an interesting exercise.
00:01:54.272 - 00:02:37.672, Speaker B: It forces us to really look at where adoption or traction or promises are actually happening across different sides of crypto or not. And I was really interested to see what Sana thinks about one of these verticals as well. So we're going to dive into this in a minute. But before that, something really, really big just happened this week, which is the binance $4 billion fine. And then Santa just shared this tweet with me from saka with a photo of CZ happily skiing away or snowboarding away without a care in the world. So what are your thoughts on this, man? Were you surprised by this news that binance needs to pay a record $4 billion fine. Or was this within your expectations?
00:02:37.848 - 00:03:14.864, Speaker A: I wasn't surprised, because I feel like everyone in crypto has been talking about it for a while now. I feel like, in particular, liquid traders in Singapore, it feels like they're running markets on how big the fine was. And I remember someone first said two, then someone said, it's going to be eight, four fields within the realm of possibility. Binance makes a lot of money. I think the thing I'm more curious about is whether, one, the era of finance like exchanges is over, or whether it's just we're going to get another sort of quasi half KYC exchange that runs a bunch of derivatives perks, or whether we actually move to a more sort of institutional structure. Then I'm also curious. It feels like there's a gap for captain of the industry.
00:03:14.864 - 00:03:25.944, Speaker A: To some degree. CZ has been the face and important person in crypto for a while. I'm curious how you feel whether there's no gap, you think? Can you see any possible contenders?
00:03:26.064 - 00:04:02.396, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's interesting, right? There's this meme on crypto Twitter where you don't want to be the main character. And last cycle, the main characters, we talked about this in the last episode, I think, like SPF, doun, and Suzhou. So FTX, Luna, and three arrows were the main characters, and they're all in jail. And then it could be debated that CZ was one of the main characters as well. And by main characters, I mean like one of the most talked about people on crypto Twitter. So it's interesting to see that the fourth kind of main character has also is also gone. I don't know if we're gonna go towards a more regulated paradigm with new exchanges being completely regulated.
00:04:02.396 - 00:04:48.200, Speaker B: I think there's still a lot of gray area. As long as the SEC is not very clear on crypto regulations, I think there will still be a lot of exchanges that will be in the gray area globally. But I do think a lot of them will stop servicing us users just because of how, you know, how vicious some of these regulatory actions are. Like you, I'm not that surprised. Even back at token 2049, this is back in September, everybody was talking about binance being hit with a 510 billion dollars fine. And that was a good thing, because that would basically put the insolvency rumors of binance at rest. As long as the DOJ is not accusing binance of commingling customer funds, I think there's the structural risks that some people were expecting was likely not going to materialize.
00:04:48.200 - 00:05:30.994, Speaker B: So I see this as a good thing as well, and I hope fully the market can move on from this and whatever comes next. I do think that the new CEO they appointed seems to be a lot more textbook or kind of buttoned up type of person. So I do think this is probably direction that binance wants to go towards, which is just getting local regulatory license for different local branches of their exchange. But all in all, I think I'm glad that this is finally over, that we don't have to keep panicking about it. But with that being said, this is actually a decent segue. Actually, this is a horrible segue, but I tried. But I want to get started with this list of definitive projects.
00:05:30.994 - 00:05:59.192, Speaker B: Another big thing that happened this week was the launch of blast, which is the l two for the NFT exchange blur. I actually want to talk about the first category, which is NFTs here. So with nfTs, I thought the most definitive project that's live right now is probably blur. So the reason why I think it's blur. Let me pull this up here. So this is the market share for NFT exchange volume. So you can see the orange here is blur.
00:05:59.192 - 00:06:46.152, Speaker B: So since actually this doesn't go that far back, but the story for Blur is basically they came to market just like all of the other competing NFT exchanges, like looksrare x two, y two, all these other exchanges that were using tokens to bootstrap trading. So these exchanges are basically printing tokens to incentivize watch trading. But then these guys came around and decided, hey, we're not going to do watch trading. Instead, we're going to provide tokens only to the liquidity makers. So we only got to provide one side of liquidity, and they created one of the most liquid or the most liquid NFT exchange out the gate. And they just completely dominated the volumes across all of the NFT exchanges and became largest exchanges by far right now. So today, blur dominates about 60% of the market volume for nfts.
00:06:46.152 - 00:07:38.824, Speaker B: And what I thought was interesting, however, is that the number of traders wise is actually still lower than the market leader in terms of NFT traders, and that is opensea. So they only have about 40% of the entire market, whereas Opensea has a little bit more. I thought this was an interesting project to highlight because the way that I view it is that blur is the binance to Opensea Coinbase. And what I mean by that is Opensea has always been kind of buttoned up very by the book based in the US as well. And they strike me as very compliant as well. Whereas blur is always pushing the edges a little bit, always thinking of new ways for people to speculate. And with this new kind of L2 they're launching, they also promised to build a perpetual Dex for market makers to long and short nfts.
00:07:38.824 - 00:08:23.226, Speaker B: So I thought this was, this is very similar to how binance took over Coinbase by launching new fangled ways for people to speculate to lever up. In this case, I think with the perp Dex, they allow market makers to finally short their inventory so they can hedge their inventory as they market make without being wrecked. Because for those of you who are not aware, I think of a lot of the market makers definitely lost a lot of money by market making on Blur because it wasn't very clear how you can hedge your inventory. Number one. And number two, the rewards given to market makers is retroactive, so you don't really know how much rewards you're earning until they announce each season of their token airdrop. So that is my pick for the NFT market. I'm curious if you've spent much time looking into blur as well.
00:08:23.226 - 00:08:28.018, Speaker B: I know you have some thoughts on their latest blast, l two. So let's dig into it, man.
00:08:28.106 - 00:09:06.412, Speaker A: I think you covered a lot of what Blur did. I think broadly, they understood that the NFT market needed a structural shift, that liquidity would not look as basic as it looked on OpenSea. And the kind of Blur's airdrop program was actually very similar to what centralized exchanges do with their market maker rebate programs by incentivizing liquidity near the midpoint of the bidar spread. And so I think they deserve their success. Blast has been crazy. I mean, I was pretty surprised that they got $342 million in TVL in like a space of 48 hours. I feel like other EVM and l two launches, you know, something like Linea, which launched recently, have been pretty disappointing.
00:09:06.412 - 00:09:33.234, Speaker A: Like, users seem quite bored. There's a handful of airdrop farmers, but they've struggled really hard to get liquidity. And I know that there's been tons of ideological complaints about blast, some of which probably have some amount of validity. I think in particular, they refer to each staking yield as native yield when there are some other risks. But I feel like the takeaway from here is that you have to figure out what users want. And I feel like that's the one thing that it seems like the blur team is really good at. They did it with blur.
00:09:33.234 - 00:09:59.766, Speaker A: They're doing it with blast, where they've clearly have a pulse on what crypto users want right now. And even though to some degree right now it's just an airdrop farm, it's been pretty crazy to see how much capital has moved there. I think so much capital has moved there that there's a second order effect that this is pretty bullish for both maker and lido in the short to medium term, which is where they are going to be earning the ETH and stablecoin yield from. I'm curious what your thoughts were.
00:09:59.910 - 00:10:25.714, Speaker B: So for those who haven't been following the blast news in the past few days. So this is basically some. The blur team announced they're going to build this l two and they create a multisig. So there's no actual l two yet, they're just a multisig, and they ask everybody to deposit their ethnic. And if you do, they're going to earn some points that maybe entitle you to some sort of an airdrop for the blast token in the future. And what are they doing with this ETH? They're just putting it in Lido and maker, right? Yeah.
00:10:25.834 - 00:10:35.494, Speaker A: And they're passing the yield on to users. I will say I think most users are there for the airdrop. Like, if you just wanted state yield, you can get state teeth yield.
00:10:35.954 - 00:10:56.242, Speaker B: Yeah. I was wondering why they did this, like, state yield thing. Because even if they didn't do this, I'm sure, like, 99% of the reason you would bridge over to blast and endure this three month lockup on this one way bridge is to earn the airdrop. Like, why did they add this complexity with earning yield for you as well?
00:10:56.338 - 00:11:43.320, Speaker A: I have been thinking a lot about how if you look at the universe of ETH that is locked in basically three places, one is kind of lending markets, one is liquidity for trading, and the third is probably l two s. It is interesting that in lending markets like Maker and aave now do more lending against state ETH than they do against ETH. And we've very slowly seen a transition in trading as well. But it did always strike me that there's this massive pool of heat that sits in Arbitrum's bridge and optimism's bridge that has not been staked yet. And I know that. I believe I read somewhere that Lido has some plans to launch a native l two staking product, but I do see the kind of obvious argument for, okay, there's all this ETH. Why is it not earning yield?
00:11:43.512 - 00:12:18.342, Speaker B: I saw this tweet from one of the co founders of Arbitrum saying that they've thought about this, they've thought about using user deposits to stake on ETH, but they decided it's a stupid idea, so they didn't do it. So I guess they must have calculated some of the risks and decided that it's not worth it. It is pretty crazy. They have 340 million. As you said, I'm sharing the dune dashboard here on the screen for our viewers out there. But in general, I guess this is actually a good segue to talk about l two s. So another big, big theme over the past twelve months, 24 months, is L2s.
00:12:18.342 - 00:12:42.932, Speaker B: We have the launch of optimism followed by the launch of Arbitrum. And then you have exchanges like bybit launched their own l two, like mantle Coinbase with their own l two. And then now obviously blast as well. So with all this of l two noise, well, not noise, but all of this l two hype, if you have to pick one definitive name for 2024 to watch out for, or one area, what would that be?
00:12:43.068 - 00:13:32.390, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. So I'm pretty bullish on optimism and arbitrageim, to be clear, but I think one of the more interesting ways to bet on the growth of l two s is actually the alias. And so for those who aren't too familiar, I can very briefly describe how rollups use data availability layer. So basically, one of the ways that both optimistic and ZK rollups scale is that they kind of do execution off chain, but then they post the results of that execution. So a record of all the transactions onto Ethereum, primarily for the moment. And so optimism kind of does all the execution of transactions and then posts what the data for those transactions onto Ethereum, which then allows other parties to kind of view and confirm that those were valid state transitions. And so data availability layers are pretty important in the space of rollups.
00:13:32.390 - 00:14:27.892, Speaker A: And in fact, if you look at Vitalik's Vitalikros post that Jason is bringing up in October 2020 about a roll up centric Ethereum roadmap, where he essentially said that, look, the way Ethereum is going to scale is clearly roll ups, and therefore Ethereum kind of needs to now start working on how it can become the best kind of base layer for rollups. Ethereum's roadmap, if technical roadmap. They've sort of given up on execution sharding, which was this idea that would scale Ethereum like four or five years ago, and now they're really just trying to build the best. So they have kind of two steps. This is kind of a two step process. The first is proto dank sharding, which is coming sometime next year, where they've kind of increased the space available for rollups to post data and created a separate fee market for it. And then eventually they're going to have full dank sharding, which involves data availability sampling that's probably a few years away.
00:14:27.892 - 00:15:07.900, Speaker A: I don't know if you have that dune chart, but it's crazy. I think roll ups are paying basically close to $10 million every month for posting data to Ethereum. So this is a pretty real market. And so when you asked me about l two tokens, the one that I thought was most interesting was actually Celestia celestial token went live, I believe, a couple of weeks ago, and it's had a pretty interesting run up in price. So Celestia is basically a data villain for roll ups to post data, too. And I think Celestia has a pretty interesting both bull and bear case, but I'll maybe make the most bullish one first. I think the most bullish case for Celestia is that if you look at the Ethereum roadmap and how they want to develop as a data availability layer, it looks a lot like Celestia.
00:15:07.900 - 00:15:45.834, Speaker A: And in fact, it looks a lot like what Celestia has already built. So Ethereum's roadmap is like, yep, we'll build Celestia. And of course, Ethereum has tons of distribution power, brand effects, and network effects. So it's not like it's going to be easy to unearth Ethereum. But if you kind of look at what Celestia has built, it has a lot of structural and technical advantages versus Ethereum currently as a dealer. And so if they manage to gain some traction, I think that that Tam is really, really big. It's basically like, you know how all tail ones used to always be called Ethereum killers two, three years ago? I actually think Celestia is probably, like, the strongest contender for that title.
00:15:45.914 - 00:15:46.594, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:15:46.714 - 00:16:32.294, Speaker A: The bare case for Celestia is that it's unclear what DA markets are going to look like. And to some degree, it's very possible that we end up in a world where there's ethereum da, which is kind of enshrined and sparkling, and people respect it, and a bunch of other dealers that start to feel like commodities. So Celestia already has competition from players like eigenvalue, Polygon, avail. Espresso systems just announced a DLA, too. So I think as a next step I'm curious to see whether Celestia can kind of cement its place as the best Da layer, or at least the best alternative DLA, or whether it ends up in a kind of commodity space with a whole bunch of other dlas like eigenvalue and espresso systems. But I do think this is kind of an underrated theme. Like, I feel like lots of users are still confused.
00:16:32.294 - 00:16:49.314, Speaker A: Like they got a celestial token airdrop and the price went up. So they're excited, but they're like, okay, I don't know what to do with this token. I don't know what data availability is. Like, what's going on here, but I do think that if you're generally believe in the l two thesis and think this is the way l two s are going to scale, you should watch data availability layers for sure.
00:16:49.394 - 00:17:40.864, Speaker B: That's exactly what happened. Because when Celestia first launched a token, they were the first. Well, they weren't the first project to talk about DA, because I think Polygon was already started, already started to talk about it, but they were the first token to be associated with a project that only does availability. So the price basically acted like the market had no idea what this is. And then I was getting so many messages from different trading firms who were like, Jason, what do you think of this? Like, what is this? How do you price this? And I was like, I have no fucking clue. And then after, I think after about two weeks, suddenly the price just doubled when the market realized, okay, this is actually pretty big. So it is interesting to see the concept of Da get some mind share, because you and I have known about this since very early on, because our previous fund, Spartan, was a seed investor in Celestia before they were called Celestia.
00:17:40.864 - 00:18:20.180, Speaker B: So we were taught about this concept by the founders of Celestia quite a while ago. But I don't think the mainstream market has really caught on to this until recently. And like you said, man, I'm just pulling up the dune that you mentioned here, the roll up economics. It is a quite significant market in terms of fees actually paid by l two s. But I guess to me, it's not very clear what differentiates one DA layer from the other, because it's not like layer one where it's very easily differentiable. You have very clear trade offs between more monolithic setups and more modular setups. You have faster tps, lower tps, whereas DA.
00:18:20.180 - 00:18:31.130, Speaker B: There's not really any kind of faster da. Right? So what are the things people should think about to compare different DA layers, or is it a relatively commoditized thing, you think?
00:18:31.252 - 00:19:13.964, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there are definitely technical trade offs. So one kind of big thing to pay attention to is data availability sampling. I understand the math well enough, but it's kind of this magic thing where you basically are able to scale the layers to basically be able to handle a lot more data with significantly fewer nodes by just kind of sampling some small portion of the data and confirming that it's correct. It uses this technique called erasure coding that I will not attempt to explain because I'm not smart enough. So I think there's definitely some technical trade offs, but I kind of agree. Dlas don't have the kind of traditional network effects that execution layers do. You're on ethereum, you have composability, you kind of run to where the liquidity is.
00:19:13.964 - 00:19:37.388, Speaker A: None of these structural advantages exist for DLA. So this is something I'm super curious about as well. There will be brand effects. It's kind of different. One you're selling entirely to developers of roll ups. So maybe like users trust the security of a certain DL more. Maybe you kind of have tons of integrations with roll up as a service providers and they kind of help you sell your product for you.
00:19:37.388 - 00:19:59.906, Speaker A: But I do kind of agree that currently it's unclear on what the DA battleground will be like. I suddenly foresee that there will be brand effects. Like I think Celestia already has a pretty strong brand. Like they understand DA and they've built something that Ethereum wants to build in the next five years, but there aren't network effects. And so I am very curious to see whether this turns into a commodity or not. And I don't have all the answers for sure.
00:20:00.010 - 00:20:48.600, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think this is a good tie into the broader debate that people have been having all year and actually last cycle as well, which is the debate between modular infrastructure versus monolithic chains versus like roll up centric vision. So basically these are different philosophies for how people can scale blockchains or scale block space. So the monolithic school of thought is basically like, okay, we just make the blocks bigger, or we just create one chain with full composability so that all the apps live on the exact same kind of base layer without needing to cross domains. So I'm not building. I don't have to deal with the fact that Uniswap is on this roll up and maybe Dydx is on the other roll up. And if I use DydX and I want to send funds and trade on Uniswap, I got across roll ups and use bridges and it's really annoying. Whereas for monolithic chain, everything's on the same chain.
00:20:48.600 - 00:21:25.094, Speaker B: So it's just like using Ethereum L1. So the poster boy for monolithic chain is Solana currently, and they're promising, I think, 5000 tps just on the base layer chain. Whereas on the post you shared just now about the roll up centric roadmap, I think it takes quite a few steps for us to get to 5000. And then and beyond for the Ethereum roadmap, which is more of a kind of modular slash roll up centric construction. So this is a good segue to lead us to alternative l one. S our next category. So you have a very, very interesting pick here, which I don't think a lot of people have talked about.
00:21:25.094 - 00:21:27.018, Speaker B: So what is this one?
00:21:27.106 - 00:22:12.854, Speaker A: Yeah, so the alternative l one that I'm most excited about, or the monolithic chain that I'm most excited about, is definitely Monad. So for those who aren't aware, Monad is essentially a much faster EVM that uses parallel execution, which is one of the key kind of key features that Solana has that enables it to run a lot faster versus other chains. And so the thesis here is relatively straightforward. The world is increasingly EVM denominated, whether we like it or not. So Defi llama has these charts on EVM TVL and non EVM TVL. And the gap is crazy. Like, if you look at non EVM, and I know TVL isn't a perfect metric, but even if you just, like, look at it as a sort of proxy for activity, Solana has like 600 million in TVL.
00:22:12.854 - 00:22:45.770, Speaker A: And after that there's bitcoin and cardano, which no one is using those chains. Whereas basically, when you look at the roll up ecosystem, when you look at something like Tron, when you look at Ethereum, when you look at Polygon, all of these things are EVM. And increasingly, I was someone who's really excited about other vms, but increasingly it feels like we're stuck with the EVM, whether we like it or not. And it's not just current traction. EVM tooling is extremely mature. Like, I remember having a couple of conversations a few months ago with developers who were building on Cairo, which is Starkware's language. And it's a lot harder than Ethereum.
00:22:45.770 - 00:23:13.130, Speaker A: Like, Ethereum has all this tooling foundry hard hat that makes it easy to develop. And for users having access to metamask and Etherscan, is super valuable. Like, one of the reasons I think Cosmos has struggled is just that using Kepler kind of sucks and no one wants a second wallet. Like, people just want to use metamask and Ethereum. And so given how much traction the EVM has, I think Monad is probably the. The team I've seen that is putting in the most effort into figuring out how we can make this EVM go a lot faster. That team is extremely sharp.
00:23:13.130 - 00:23:32.434, Speaker A: They also have, their meme game is totally on point. They just got CMS intern to join their team. And so watch this space is basically what I'm saying. Monad's testnet is in life. So this is like, very much like, there's not a whole lot to do, unfortunately, yet, but I think it's really worth paying attention to how they are super scaling the EVM.
00:23:32.514 - 00:23:38.302, Speaker B: Is there another project that's doing parallel execution that you know of for evms?
00:23:38.458 - 00:23:40.366, Speaker A: Not one that I know of. Do you know?
00:23:40.510 - 00:24:07.574, Speaker B: So this might be a little bit of alpha for our listeners. So by the time this episode comes out, I think the announcement will be out is one of our portfolio companies. So say network, which is already live, is doing this. So say, it's really interesting you mentioned Cosmos because, say started with the Cosmos SDK, because with the Cosmos SDK, it's very easy to spin up a blockchain and then roll your own consensus mechanism as well, which is what they did. But exactly as you predicted. Nobody cares. Nobody wants to use Kepler.
00:24:07.574 - 00:24:42.948, Speaker B: Nobody wants to use cosmos chains. And it's so interesting to see this man, because a few years ago, there was a huge narrative around, okay, rust based chains. Like, developers want to build in rust because everybody's like, the rust community is much bigger. And then obviously, when aptos and Sui came along, everybody's like, everybody wants to build and move because it's easier, it's formerly verifiable. So everybody wants to build in this instead of solidity. But then over the years, it seems like that narrative has shifted to everybody wants to build in solidity and everybody wants to use the EVM. So I forgot who said this, but EVM.
00:24:42.948 - 00:25:08.974, Speaker B: Someone said that the EVM is the greatest export of Ethereum, which I absolutely agree with. And so this is actually on the roadmap for, say, in the beginning already. They always wanted to be EVM compatible. So they are going to announce their parallel execution for EVM. I think probably by the time this episode comes out, probably on the same day. So we're working together on that, actually. So quite excited about this, and I think this is a good pick.
00:25:08.974 - 00:25:15.742, Speaker B: I think this will probably be two of the more interesting projects to monitor for this narrative. Yeah.
00:25:15.798 - 00:25:19.782, Speaker A: I should also quickly disclose that we are investors in Monad and in blur.
00:25:19.878 - 00:25:44.350, Speaker B: Yes, we should. We also have our disclaimers. We always have our disclaimers before and after. So hopefully we have disclaimed enough. So let's move on to the next category, which is probably our shared favorite category. So this is Defi. So, for me, my pick on the project to watch for 2024 for DeFi is a little project that also we both invested in called Athena.
00:25:44.350 - 00:26:39.008, Speaker B: So for people who are not aware, Athena is basically a delta neutral stablecoin providing an Internet native yield. So what I mean by this is to mint the Athena USD, you basically take your ETH, you stake your ETH in Lido, you take that liquid staked ETH and post it as collateral, and then the protocol will then open a corresponding short position for you on a centralized exchange or collection of centralized exchanges that neutralizes your ETH exposure. So you have a delta neutral dollar representation in the form of a stable coin. But the interesting thing is, as you hold that stable coin, the protocol would divert the yield from your staked ETH to you, but also the earnings that you have from shorting ETH perp. Because historically, ETH perp has mostly traded with a positive funding. So for shorts, that means you get paid a funding. So what does that mean? So if you look at where the funding is, let's call it today, for ETH.
00:26:39.008 - 00:27:21.554, Speaker B: Let me actually just pull it up here. So the funding rate for Ethereum, on an annualized basis, on an exchange like binance is like 10%, on Oke is like 18%. So if you add this to the lido yield for staking ETH, which is like three, 4%, you know, you get anywhere from 15% to 20% yield on a stable coin. You know, conceptually, obviously, this is not guaranteed. This would fluctuate quite a lot. So I thought this is such an interesting idea, because unlike other stable coins today, which are, you know, diverting yield to you through some sort of real world assets, right? That's the big narrative right now. Like with Maker, they're earning treasury yields and diverting some of that to you, with USDC, they're earning some treasury yields and diverting some of them to users through Coinbase as well.
00:27:21.554 - 00:28:02.390, Speaker B: This is the only project I've seen that's giving you a fully crypto native yield that only relies on ETH staking and also crypto exchanges without any type of artificial inflation. So they might still slap on some artificial token rewards in the beginning to bootstrap the system. But I thought this was such an interesting construction. But obviously this is very controversial as well, because people are like, okay, one of the funding rate flips negative in a bear market, and you start paying to hold a stable coin. I think that's actually part of the design. If you have to pay to hold a stable coin, you have so many other alternatives. So to me, this is actually just allowing market forces to create a stable coin for you instead of trying to slap on artificial incentives, like with Luna.
00:28:02.390 - 00:29:09.480, Speaker B: And there's a lot of critique around the centralized risk of relying on centralized exchanges as well for the hedge leg of this. So we're going to cover all of that, actually, in an interview with the founder guy, which I think we should be releasing maybe a week from this episode. So we talk about exactly how they're mitigating the custody risk as well. But long story short, there is a new ish tech out there that allows people to post a collateral through a custody provider, like a fireblocks or a copper, and then these guys would then help you open a position on exchanges without posting your collateral, without actually depositing your custody with the exchanges. So this is much more similar to how tradfi actually works, where custody, settlement, execution are all separate venues, instead of like one giant quasi bank, like we have with centralized exchanges as well. So I think this is interesting because this project is also emblematic of where I think DeFi is headed, which is more similar to a tradfi construction versus now. So I know you've spent a lot of time on Athena as well, but you also have other names you're thinking about, because we're both defined nuts here.
00:29:09.480 - 00:29:11.496, Speaker B: So I'll toss the mic over to you.
00:29:11.600 - 00:29:58.528, Speaker A: Yeah, I am also very excited to see how Athena plays out. I'm going to keep this short because we're running short on time, but I do think a team that's been shipping great product all through this bear market and is going a little under the radar is Evo. Evo was started by the team that had previously built ribbon finance, and I think they've taken their learnings about options, markets, and perhaps markets to create a great product that lives on its own as a op stack chain. I've used it. I think the experience is great. The thing that's crazy to me is their volumes are going up, like week on week, and it's the middle of a bear market. And I think the coolest thing is that they're seeing options volume go up, which has been this kind of holy grail of defi for a long time, where people have been wondering how to do decentralized options.
00:29:58.528 - 00:30:26.084, Speaker A: And I think Evo has built probably the only experience that feels like a credible competitor to Derek at the moment. And they've also launched a bunch of really fun markets on the perp side. They've had these pre launch futures, I don't know if you've seen for tokens like say for tokens like Celestia and for tokens like pit. And it's just been awesome to see a team that's been shipping through the bear market see the traders go up, the volume go up, the liquidity go up. Yeah, I also see they also had a friend tech burp, which I thought was so fun.
00:30:26.584 - 00:30:29.084, Speaker B: The friend USD, is that a perp or an option?
00:30:29.424 - 00:30:30.524, Speaker A: It's a perp.
00:30:32.104 - 00:30:35.482, Speaker B: So what is it? Is it like an index of the biggest frontec keys?
00:30:35.578 - 00:30:55.214, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I'll caveat by saying it's pretty low liquidity. And so there's a very widespread, which of course, like market makers who are quoting the friendtech perp need to earn a pretty widespread to make sure that they're compensated for the risk they're taking. But essentially, if I recall correctly, it tracks the market cap off the top ten keys on fintech.
00:30:55.514 - 00:31:18.438, Speaker B: Oh, interesting. Yeah, I think. I think one of my friends was trading this earlier, actually, but this is a good pick. I'm a big fan of the ribbon team of Julian. I think they are one of the more forward thinking teams in crypto as well. I remember talking about the idea of options vaults with them very early on, and it's interesting to see them kind of pivot into this new direction. But like you said, we are running low on time.
00:31:18.438 - 00:31:56.368, Speaker B: So let's speed through to the next one, which is gaming. So for gaming, we went back and forth on this. I was going to talk about Ronin. I think there could be an interesting discussion on this later on because I know you're a little bit of a ronin skeptic, and I'm quite excited about Rodin, but I think that's like way over discussed on so many podcasts already. And then I want to talk about illuvium, but then I think that's also quite well covered. So one that I think is controversial, but important enough to discuss because it's emblematic of such a new trend, is rollbit. So I would categorize robot under gaming, because it's very much a game, right? They provide games, they provide a casino venue.
00:31:56.368 - 00:32:21.398, Speaker B: And why I wanted to discuss this is because of the sheer scale it got to. I don't think we can ignore it anymore. So this is robit. For those of you watching this video, I'm just sharing the interface for robit. It very much looks like your typical centralized gambling casino, like, online casino site. It provides mostly like three different products. So it's crypto futures that's very much targeting towards retailers in a slightly predatory way.
00:32:21.398 - 00:32:42.702, Speaker B: So there's like 1000 x leverage. But like with most of these venues, I don't think people actually use 1000 x leverage because it's. It's quite untenable. But then there's also casino. So a bunch of media games where you can, you know, either gamble your crypto, crypto holdings or your fiat holdings as well. There's also a sportsbook business as well. And I think they're constantly trying to turn out more and more products.
00:32:42.702 - 00:33:10.050, Speaker B: And for me, I'm not too excited about gambling in general. Despite being in crypto. I'm not really a gambler. I don't do any type of gambling. I always thought casinos are, you know, an interesting game, but they're clearly rigged against you, so I never use them. But what caught my eye with this is the sheer number that, the sheer scale of this thing. So within, I think, the past year or so, these guys grew to about $300 million in revenue, or so they claim.
00:33:10.050 - 00:33:47.874, Speaker B: So if these numbers are real, this would put them at a pretty, pretty high level when you compare the revenues from any of the different crypto applications. So, ignoring exchanges, let me see if I can pull up the fees here for different crypto applications. Yeah. So for those of you looking at this. So, for instance, Ethereum, over the year as a chain, earns about $2 billion in fees. And then next one is Tron, which $900 million in fees. So if you want to find an application that earns 300 million a year, there's really only uniswap that earns 500 million a year.
00:33:47.874 - 00:34:27.394, Speaker B: And Lido, which earns $560 million a year. Every single other crypto application has earned lower revenues than 300 million. So I thought, okay, this is clearly one of the bigger applications in crypto, but it's also very controversial, right, because it's basically a centralized venue. But what makes it crypto is that they have a token where it actually has utility. So people who hold this token are given a part of the rake from the casino and given some sort of discount if you use the crypto perpetrating product. And what caught my attention as well is that they started buying back the tokens with part of the revenues. So with the on chain burns, you can actually track how much revenues they're making as a business.
00:34:27.394 - 00:35:06.514, Speaker B: So the caveat is, I looked into on chain burns, they're basically just them sending their own treasury tokens to a burn address so they can, you know, really make up any numbers they want. So maybe they're making 30 million, maybe they're making 500, and underreporting. Nobody knows. So I tried to do some triangulation where I looked at the number of page visits to the robot URL and the purported revenues, and then I compare that to more kind of traditional casino venues. And the ratios kind of make sense. So I do think there is a decent chance numbers are probably real. So I thought this is one of the more interesting ones because we're starting to see more and more casino deals on the venture side.
00:35:06.514 - 00:35:36.474, Speaker B: So ever since robit took off, we've been seeing so many decks from people trying to build these quasi crypto, centralized casino things. And going back to your initial point, when we were first discussing binance, will exchanges all become more regulated, or are people still pushing for the gray area? I think this is the type of project that's like pushing for the gray area. So not necessarily condoning them, but as someone in the space, I think this is quite important to watch. Do you have any thoughts on businesses like this?
00:35:36.634 - 00:35:55.546, Speaker A: I mean, like you said, they may leave a bad taste in your mouth, but they make a lot of money. Like Steak.com, which I think is the most original. It doesn't have a token, so it doesn't feel as crypto native. But basically you deposit and withdraw in crypto. I think they made $2.6 billion in revenue last year, which dwarfs every crypto company you know of, essentially.
00:35:55.546 - 00:36:31.922, Speaker A: So it's obviously like running a casino is an amazing business. And for the reasons you described, that suddenly makes it interesting. I do struggle a little on the venture side. It seems like this is not a generalization, but I do think very often gambling companies tend to attract lower integrity founders, which makes them kind of like a little tricky to do on the venture side. And given the regulatory risk as well, I think they're harder investment to make. But I think it is like a pretty under the radar thing that all of these businesses actually make a ton of revenue, which a lot of crypto projects that we discussed with a lot of excitement don't do.
00:36:32.058 - 00:36:56.618, Speaker B: Honestly, why do you think that is? Why do casino businesses attract low integrity? Would you categorize some of the big exchanges as being founded by low integrity folks? Because it's a similar type of business model. It's semi regulated, kind of unregulated, kind of gray areas, speculation tools, clearly targeting retails. Like, do they attract the same type of people, or is there a clear divide between exchange folks and casino folks?
00:36:56.706 - 00:37:27.980, Speaker A: That's a really good question. I don't think there's a clear divide. It's certainly, like. I think there's also, like, some differences here where I think, in particular, in the US, I think, like, running gambling venues feels like low status in some ways. But in Asia, like, the most interesting exchange founders have generally been asian in crypto as well. And I think there's, like, to your point of whether, like, there's a big distinction, I think the crypto futures on rollback are super interesting because they haven't gaining a lot of volume. And I know you're generally correct that people aren't actually using thousand x leverage, but I don't know if you've seen the TikTok videos.
00:37:27.980 - 00:37:55.558, Speaker A: There's, like, these TikTok videos where users will essentially, like, enter a thousand x leverage trade, and a thousand x leverage trade is just like a coin loss. Either you get liquidated immediately or you make some money. And so they do TikTok videos where they enter the trade, and then they try and click. Like, if it goes up, they try and click as fast to close it, but very often they can't click fast enough before they get liquidated, because, you know, it takes, like, I don't know, 0.01% price move to liquidate them. And that's not trading in. No way is that trading.
00:37:55.558 - 00:37:58.622, Speaker A: So, yeah, it is an interesting distinction. I don't know. What do you think?
00:37:58.758 - 00:38:30.690, Speaker B: I hear you, man. I mean, I do hold some rollbit tokens, just purely as a speculator in the liquid markets, right. I'm not a venture investor in them. I'm just trading this thing because I thought the numbers are interesting. But if rollbit is the biggest application in crypto in a year's time, honestly, I'll be pretty sad, man, if this is the best we can do, obviously, it's really impressive that they've made this much money with this type of business. But you and I both want to see more than just casinos in crypto, which leads us to our next category. I think I'm getting better at these segues, man.
00:38:30.690 - 00:38:55.726, Speaker B: So the next category is deep in. We discussed this in the last episode. So DPIn stands for decentralized physical infrastructure networks. So these are using blockchains to coordinate a network of physical infrastructure. And your pick for this is something we briefly touched on last time. I'd like to dive deeper into this this time, which is hivemapper. So I've pulled it up right here for our listeners or watchers to look at.
00:38:55.726 - 00:38:57.794, Speaker B: So what is this? What is hivemapper?
00:38:58.254 - 00:39:35.050, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to start by saying this is not like a huge endorsement of the honey token, which currently has extremely low float. And so I don't think price discovery is particularly healthy at the moment. And height map is also very early. So I don't know that like whether it's time to invest or not. I mostly think it's a very interesting project because I feel like a lot of deep end projects have actually managed to generate supply of whatever physical infrastructure they want. So even something like helium, I remember two, three years ago, they were actually like selling a ton of helium nodes. And if you kind of are willing to incentivize people with tokens, they're actually quite willing to like do things, whether that's set up a helium node or kind of buy a hive mapper camera.
00:39:35.050 - 00:40:12.716, Speaker A: But I think where they've struggled a lot is actually generating demand for the product they build. And this extends even to something like Filecoin, where Filecoin had a ton of people who were excited to mine filecoin. There were a bunch of people in Asia who even built specialized hardware for it. But I think they always struggle to get people to actually use the storage space and compete with centralized providers like Amazon S three. And so the reason I'm intrigued by Hivemapper is that the founder's actually written a ton of really interesting blog posts, which I recommend people read if they're curious. But essentially Hivemapper is a deep end where people put a hivemapper camera in their car. This camera is always on, and as you drive around, it essentially generates live mapping data.
00:40:12.716 - 00:40:58.964, Speaker A: And so the way to think of the competition here, the competition here is those Google Street View cars that like, go drive every street once every six months. Apparently they cost like high six to low seven figures to run. And so the reason I think Hivemapper is cool is because from first principles, you can kind of see that if I get a Hivemapper camera into a ton of cars, and in particular like fleets, like cabs, which drive a lot of places, or like, I had this story where some person had put it on a garbage truck. But yeah, like, if you can get a whole bunch of people to use these cameras, then you can see how you could defeat like, one Google car. Trying to capture live mapping data every six months. And particularly as like, mapping data becomes more important, both for routing and for self driving cars and stuff like that. Having live mapping data is really powerful.
00:40:58.964 - 00:41:44.056, Speaker A: And then the second is that if you read through the blog post, it's very clear that the founder kind of understands the mapping industry and is very thoughtful about what is the product we're building here and what it takes to sell a map. So he has a really cool master plan that is similar to like Elon had this four step master plan about building a sports car. The heightmapper founder also has his four step master plan, and I think this is one that I'm keeping an eye on because I generally think the idea makes some sense from first principles. It's extremely ambitious. I can't say this will work for sure, just because it's pretty hard to build a decentralized AI powered map network and then sell that data to mapping companies. But it's an ambitious project. I think the founder has thought very deeply about what's a cool way to build this.
00:41:44.160 - 00:42:23.478, Speaker B: So the master plan that they have that I just pulled up is this for our viewers out there. So it's, number one, build a decentralized AI powered map network. And then number two is make money selling that data to improve other companies maps and databases. Number three is use that money to build a full set of builder friendly tools for developers. And then number four is, while doing above, fairly reward the humans who built the map together. So this is quite interesting. And like you said, with most of these deep end networks, it's been no problem to bootstrap the supply side, because if someone's paying you to put up some spare computation, you're going to do it.
00:42:23.478 - 00:42:55.750, Speaker B: Any economically rational actor would do it. It's really the demand side that's been struggling. One of the projects that I've been tracking called a cash network, they're providing GPU's h for people to basically render different AI models. I think they have been seeing some sort of demand. I think the daily spend is like $2,000. So if you put that in perspective, they're making more fees than like Dogecoin as a network. But a lot of that is still incentivized, right? So the users are being incentivized by the token as well.
00:42:55.750 - 00:43:12.966, Speaker B: So it seems like a lot of the deep end networks is still quite reliant on inflationary rewards to bootstrap both the supply and, if they have it, the demand side. So I guess with Hive Mapper specifically, is anyone paying to use hive Mapper right now, or is that still in the bootstrapping supply side phase?
00:43:13.070 - 00:43:19.598, Speaker A: I believe they have some paying clients, but I don't know the details of that. I think it's quite private.
00:43:19.726 - 00:43:47.914, Speaker B: Well, I am quite excited about this. This is one of the more out there ideas, so I hope it works out. This is something that's worth backing. But quickly moving on to the next category, another one we should talk about is oracles. With oracles, it's mostly really been a chain link show. Everybody's been talking about chain link for years and years, so I don't think we need to talk about chain links. But the other entrant that just came to market, that just launched a token, I think, like this week, right, was.
00:43:47.914 - 00:43:56.038, Speaker B: Yes, I think it was. This week was pith. So do you want to talk a little bit about what your thoughts are on Pith network? And what exactly is Pith network? Actually?
00:43:56.166 - 00:44:26.954, Speaker A: Yeah. Pit is an article. It's very similar, actually. It's designed quite differently from Chainlink, but as far as users are concerned, you can think of Pith as an article that provides price feeds. They initially gained a lot of success in the Solana ecosystem and actually have, like, true market dominance on non EVM chains. Like, I think chains like Aptos, Sui and Solana all use it. However, something we pointed out earlier in the show is that, like, EVM chains are really where the show is these days, and they've struggled there, but it's been cool to see that they have some progress.
00:44:26.954 - 00:45:04.494, Speaker A: There's a chain link og defi mafia. An interesting example of this is that Synthetix uses pith oracles for their perps product. And Kane, the founder of Synthetix, actually wrote a wrong blog, a long blog post saying that he really wanted to wait for Chainlink to launch their oracle. That works for perps. But the DaO sort of overruled him, and he kind of thought that was an interesting moment to reflect because he thinks the DaO eventually took the correct decision, but he wouldn't have. So faith has basically been slowly making progress with EVM chains. I believe an aave instance on optimism is going to use them as their backup oracle as well.
00:45:04.494 - 00:45:43.528, Speaker A: Don't quote me on that, or I should research that. But generally, if you look at kind of the space of total value secured for all oracles chainlink is by far and above the leader. And the funny thing is that actually, like number two and three are the Tron oracle with Justin Sun. I think it's called winklink or something because Tron has so much DVL via just lend. And then the third oracle is Chronicle, which is maker's oracle because maker actually like, does not use outside oracles and so they run their own. And then pith only has like, what, 5% market share? And so it's still small, but it's been growing pretty rapidly. I think it's about a 10th of what Chainlink has, and they have a pretty sharp team, good customer references, and are making headwinds into EVM land.
00:45:43.528 - 00:46:09.618, Speaker A: The one thing I'm going to say, I guess the one thing pith doesn't have is pit marines in the way that are link marines. One thing I will say is that I think oracles are a little overvalued. I don't really understand why Chainlink trades at $14 billion. Chainlink has been around for a long time. There are link marines. I don't really understand what the supply and liquidity dynamics are, but Chainlink does not make enough money to be worth $14 billion is a general observation. I don't know if you've dug into link at all.
00:46:09.706 - 00:46:58.818, Speaker B: I haven't dug into link lately. I just know they're doing the CCIP thing with staking as well. But like you said, I think Pith was one of the more hyped up projects, especially during Solana's initial run up. But it's interesting to me that no other Oracle has launched their own token. At least I'm not aware of chronicle Winklink having their own tokens. Maybe it's just there's not really a need for one, but it seems like the market, as you said, is really willing to price these things quite highly. And I don't know if they're overvalued or undervalued, but I think just purely because of the fact that there's not too many shelling points for the market to express a view on oracles, these things are priced at a relative premium to other applications that might have comparable TVL or kind of revenue type of metrics.
00:46:58.818 - 00:47:36.114, Speaker B: But yeah, it's definitely one that I'm keeping an eye on for 2024 as well. Now, since we have about ten minutes left, the last category is memes. So I'm very hesitant to talk about this because we were talking about this before we recorded. I'm never really a meme coin guy. Like, I am philosophically misaligned with things like Bonk. I think these are, like, very clearly pump and dump by influencers to show completely senseless thesis to then dump on their followers, which I just don't find any interest in doing. The only meme coins that I thought were interesting were things like doge, because there might be actual utility with Elon Musk always teasing that he's going to bring it onto x.
00:47:36.114 - 00:48:08.972, Speaker B: But that's the only thing I never traded, never owned Shiba or any other of these kind of meme coins. But the one that I actually made a venture bet in, which I'll share the name in a bit, is kind of what I call an ironic meme coin, right? They claim to be a meme coin, and all of the marketing, they say they're meme coin, but you actually dig into what they're working on. You talk to the team, they're not really, really a meme coin. And when I first shared this name, I got a lot of response on Twitter saying, oh, my God, jason, I can't believe you're shilling this. Well, first of all, I'm not shilling this. I'm literally just sharing my thesis on this. When I shared it, it didn't even have a token yet.
00:48:08.972 - 00:48:28.510, Speaker B: So I'm not condoning this token. Do not buy this token because of me, but I will share my thesis on this. So this is called Memeland. So there's a pretty clear, interesting divide. When I talk to my folks in the west, everybody thinks, oh, this is just another cash grab. This is just another meme coin. When I talk to folks in Asia, people are quite excited, and I'll talk about why in a bit, but just to explain what this is.
00:48:28.510 - 00:48:54.990, Speaker B: So Memeland is, as they claim, a completely useless no use case, no roadmap token. They claim this quite clearly, explicitly in their roadmap, but then they actually have a roadmap. So Memeland is basically a token that is supposed to be a utility token for a network of social products for people to converge around. So they have four products that are announced now. So there's holders.com, comma, GMGm.com, comma, state land, and pets land.
00:48:54.990 - 00:49:21.128, Speaker B: So I only know about stakeland. I've only heard about stake land. So the team actually didn't even want to share the roadmap. When they first pitched us, they were just like, you know, we're this team, we're building Memeland, and, you know, if you want to invest and invest. So it was like one of the most kind of interesting pitches, but I'll talk about why I invested in a bit. But the only product that I really know the details of is stake land. So my understanding is that for stake land, they want to create liquid staking without fees.
00:49:21.128 - 00:50:11.600, Speaker B: So they're not in this to earn revenues from liquid staking. They're just creating a way for people to stake and earn ETH yield for free. So I thought, okay, this is interesting, because if you can get people who are not in crypto already a free way to earn yield on ETH, then you can maybe incentivize some folks to start digging into ETH, to start buying ETH and start digging into crypto. So some of these other social products, they haven't really announced the full details yet, but I think it's along similar routes. It's basically trying to get people to start using crypto in a very, very, very kind of noob friendly and abstracted way. And the way they, the shelling point they've created around this is the meme token, which is targeting kind of non crypto natives. So to me, this is actually one of the projects that is so left field, that is so non crypto native that it could help expand the market size for crypto.
00:50:11.600 - 00:50:43.840, Speaker B: So here's the main part. This is why I'm excited about this, is because the team behind this is the same team behind nine gag. So for those of you who are not aware, nine gag is one of the biggest websites in the entire world. So this is the top 500 website in the world by traffic alone. And they were also incubated by Y Combinator, I think almost like ten years ago now. But if you rank all the YC companies by Alexa ranking, which is the ranking of the popularity of websites, they're top ten. And they actually have more visits than Airbnb.
00:50:43.840 - 00:51:24.436, Speaker B: So this is not a small website. They have 100 million daily visits, pretty sizable websites, I think, mostly popular within Asia. So they were started in Hong Kong. This is why I knew about them, you know, 1010 plus years ago, where I don't think a lot of people in the west really know about this. So this is without a doubt one of the biggest social distribution channels that crypto has ever seen. I think they have more social followers than virtually any crypto project that I've seen, including exchanges, including exchange influencers and founders. So if they can somehow create a fun little, silly little meme coin to get people who are not in crypto to be excited about crypto, to maybe throw a dollar into meme coin just to see what it is.
00:51:24.436 - 00:52:21.962, Speaker B: And through that, if they can then lead people to explore what staking is through stake land and through these other kinds of applications, I think that's actually a really interesting funnel for crypto that no one has really thought about yet. So I have no comment on the value accrual on meme. I don't know if they're going to do anything to accrue value to meme from these products they're building, but just purely based on. Purely based on the fact that this is targeting billions of people, maybe not billions, maybe hundreds of millions of people, just based on the visits on nine gig alone to come into crypto, I thought this is something worthwhile to bet. And I'll end with a quote that the founder told me, which is, we've tried to build all these products and try to bring crypto to people. We're trying to build these defi things and NFT things to try to force people to crypto. So what if we flipped it and we try to create this use listing and bring the people to crypto, basically incentivize them to start exploring crypto in a very kind of not shoving it down your throat kind of way.
00:52:21.962 - 00:52:37.804, Speaker B: So I thought that thesis was really worth backing. I know a lot of people used to disagree with this and think this is a scam meme coin, so we're all free to make our own minds. But I guess in meme coins in general. Have you done much exploring here? Is there anything that's worth looking at from a venture perspective?
00:52:37.994 - 00:52:53.144, Speaker A: It doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I actually. I think someone sent me a dick from Aim land. And I was just like, what is going on here? I have no idea what to make of this. I think it's important for crypto to be fun. Like, it's part of the reason I'm here. And an interesting observation I had, actually.
00:52:53.144 - 00:53:14.704, Speaker A: I was in Turkey for Devconnect, and USDT acceptance in Istanbul is crazy. Like, almost every corner there's like a store saying like, oh, we trade. We trade USDT. You'll see a bunch of stickers saying they accept USDT. Then I saw this sticker. I actually put it in our links. I don't know if you are able to access it, but there was this sticker I saw that was kind of like coin center, the best way to exchange tokens.
00:53:14.704 - 00:53:44.406, Speaker A: And the funny thing about it was that it had four coins. Tether, ethereum, bitcoin, and it looks like a shiba, but it's clearly representing Doge. And I generally thought it was really funny that the four cryptocurrencies as far as these people are concerned, and the ones who are actually using it to pay and save money, stable coins, ethereum, bitcoin and doge. And so, yeah, I will. The power of memes is real, seemingly, but I have no strong opinions about this stuff because I haven't looked into it enough.
00:53:44.510 - 00:54:19.226, Speaker B: Yeah, I think with. I've always had a bias against meme coins. I always thought there were tools for speculation. But if you talk to our friends outside of crypto, what are some of the names they started looking at when they first go into crypto? It's always the meme stuff and cardano for some reason. I think it's because there's a lot of YouTube influencers shilling Cardano for no reason or for some reason, but a lot of them are interested in things like doge and shib. And I really kind of always dismissed it, but, and you have folks like Elon musk, right? The most followed person in the world, the richest person in the world, talking about dogecoin as well. So that's certainly going to garner some attention.
00:54:19.226 - 00:54:43.720, Speaker B: So I think there is some cultural significance and I kind of bucket them in the same bucket as NFTs as well. Right? I don't think NFTs have any utility like profile pictures. Nobody cares. But clearly I was wrong. Like, somebody cares and they become a cultural kind of staple in society. So I think meme coins may have that weird role to pay, but I'm not sure. But this is quite interesting that people actually pay with sheep.
00:54:43.720 - 00:55:14.454, Speaker B: I've never met anybody who holds shib, or at least anybody that I know of. So with that being said, I think that pretty much covers all of the categories we wanted to go through today. So we talked about, we talked about nfts, we talked about l two s, l one s, defi Gaming, Deepin, Oracle's memes. I'm sure we're missing some categories.
