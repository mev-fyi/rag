00:00:02.080 - 00:00:04.366, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Blockcrunch.
00:00:04.390 - 00:00:23.878, Speaker B: Podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto. This episode is also brought to you by Periswap. Stick around to learn more. This episode is also sponsored by the Hbar foundation.
00:00:23.966 - 00:00:38.628, Speaker A: This episode is also brought to you by notional finance. I like to use notional finance to get transparent fixed rate borrowing and lending. On Ethereum, the upgraded and easy to use V two with token and liquidity mining is also live now at Notional Finance blockcrunch.
00:00:38.676 - 00:00:39.844, Speaker B: So stick around to learn more.
00:00:39.924 - 00:01:31.140, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, if you've been following me on Twitter, you know that I've been calling these recent times some of the most uncertain time in crypto because there's a lot of stuff happening in the broader macro markets with tapering, with rate hikes, but there's also an unprecedented amount of sideline capital in crypto ready to deploy into new projects and new founders. So the outlook for the next six to twelve months is not just important for investors and traders, but also really important for founders hoping to manage their Runway so that they can continue building what they're building. And in order to kind of decipher what is going on, I wanted to triangulate my own view with good thinkers in this space. And one of the people that came with high recommendation is Jordy Alexander from Cellini Capital. So I'm really excited to have Jordi on the show to talk to us about his market outlook for 2022.
00:01:31.140 - 00:01:32.636, Speaker A: So, Jordi, welcome to the show.
00:01:32.740 - 00:01:34.036, Speaker C: Thanks for inviting me, Jason.
00:01:34.180 - 00:01:48.884, Speaker A: Definitely. Now, Jordy, I first heard about you on Hasoo's podcast, where you talk a lot about probability and how you think about the space. But I think what you didn't go into was your background and how you started in crypto and what is the leading capital. So can you maybe give us a little bit background there?
00:01:49.004 - 00:02:19.944, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, my background is very much in games, probability, and poker, and I've been in trading for a very long time. So I very much got into crypto as a crypto trader initially, and now Salini capital does everything from venture deals. We design protocols and mechanics and everything else as well. So very much trying to be a very crypto native part of the space as opposed to just doing some algorithmic trading back and forth.
00:02:20.084 - 00:02:24.440, Speaker A: And have you always started with trading crypto, or did you trade other assets before as well?
00:02:24.552 - 00:02:50.162, Speaker C: Yeah, I've traded fixed income for many years, so I'm very familiar with the space. And funnily enough, that's been one of the drivers of the entire crypto market now. So I feel quite comfortable navigating these waters, understanding what's really coming out from the Fed and the global central banks at a time where micro conditions are shifting very much so. My background is fixed income and also commodities also.
00:02:50.298 - 00:03:27.834, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's something that I think is really interesting because obviously as a more kind of fundamentals driven firm, we focus more on researching specific projects, but the macro also impacts a lot about the market. So we're trying to kind of get up to speed on that as well. And obviously in house. We have some people who look at that, but I'd love to kind of get your views on that later on. But I'd love to kind of set the stage here first because there are many different types of traders and investors in crypto with different horizons, risk tolerance and goals. So just so we know the context, what would you say are kind of your time horizon, what would you say are your goals as an investor trader? What are you mostly optimizing for?
00:03:27.914 - 00:03:56.950, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we're very much a multi strat type of firm, so we have strategies that are just providing liquidity into the market or arbitraging some cross exchange opportunities, and those are extremely short term. So it's a matter of seconds or minutes. We have some swing trades that are a bit more discretionary, that go on for days, and then we have investments that we make that are very much long term. We look at the broader picture of crypto and we don't intend to sell them for a long time.
00:03:57.062 - 00:04:29.316, Speaker A: That's really interesting because I guess the follow up question would be about risk. What kinds of risk are you usually okay with? Because for me, intraday 1020 percent moves don't really concern me and even larger moves really don't concern me if they recover. And for me, trying to hedge it all out eats into the returns and takes a lot of time and cost as well. So for me, I'm trying to avoid the 50% to 80% market sell off that takes months or years to recover. What about for you guys? What kind of risks are you actively trying to hedge out or guard against?
00:04:29.460 - 00:05:07.864, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say a little bit different than you guys. So like I said, we have three different kind of buckets and the short term arbitrage, that's pretty much a market structure type of trade. We're trying to make the market more efficient, provide liquidity in places where there's not enough for the people who let's say somebody wants to trade 500 ETH into a book and there's only 300 ETH there. If they put a market order for 500, the market's going to wick through. And you see these crazy wicks sometimes where there's no liquidity. So we're kind of providing backstop liquidity all across dexs and centralized exchanges as well. So that's not really kind of affected too much by the outlook for the swing trade.
00:05:07.864 - 00:05:40.114, Speaker C: We do actually get affected by ten to 20% moves because we're putting on rather large positions for a short time period, where it's either a pair trade like we're expecting something's overvalued compared to something else that's very similar to it, or we're taking directional move. And again, a 20% move would be a huge impact. And then for the very long term stuff, which we hold for many months or years, we're really playing out a thesis. And in that case a bit more similar to you, where a 20% move wouldn't really matter, I guess.
00:05:40.284 - 00:05:44.918, Speaker A: And I guess on a day to day basis, what are some of the things that you typically spend time looking at?
00:05:45.006 - 00:06:40.232, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, since like I said, I have this sort of macro background, I'm always keeping an eye, like the first thing I do in the morning, instead of checking like on chain metrics or sku metrics or anything else, I just check the traditional markets. I've noticed correlation that's been very strong with traditional markets for the last two years. Really. I think checking stocks and bonds are like the two main things. Checking commodities like oil and gold also offer a bit more color and effects sometimes, although I would say like less so now that the market banks are generally like in lockstep. So yeah, like if there's a big equity move and I check bonds, that's the next thing I do. Unfortunately, like some of the warning signs that I've been looking out for for the last year have started to play out recently.
00:06:40.232 - 00:07:26.536, Speaker C: We can get into it, but I have been seeing over the last couple of weeks for the first time, some of these really scary signs in the macro market. The scariest one that you don't want to wake up and see. Unfortunately, you've had many days of this lately, which is bonds down and stocks down. I can get into later why this is extremely terrifying and this generally signals the end of a cycle. But it's the opposite of what we've had for years, which is bonds up and stocks up, which is basically the result of very easy monetary policy, which improves asset prices. And normally there is an inverse correlation between the two. If stocks go down a lot, people go into the safe haven, they go into treasuries.
00:07:26.536 - 00:07:35.594, Speaker C: That's the safe haven. If that safe haven is not working, that's really where markets reset. So we can get into that a little bit later.
00:07:35.754 - 00:08:14.634, Speaker A: Yeah, it's really interesting that you pay attention to macro markets as well, because I think in the previous crypto native cycles, you could kind of get away by just looking at bitcoin and what's happening with ICO markets. Whereas now it seems the correlation has been kind of rising, especially institutions entering the space. And this kind of ties into one of the big things that you talked about, which is bitcoin as a flag bearer for the market. So in the past, bitcoin has basically been the bellwether for the entire crypto market. Is this something that you think will still persist, or can there be kind of increasing decoration over time between different crypto assets as kind of web3 becomes more of its own thing?
00:08:15.014 - 00:09:20.036, Speaker C: I'm not a big believer in the decorrelation thesis for the short term. On the way down, I don't think that, apart from random narratives, we've obviously had a few, even in the last week, where everything is down ten to 20%, but chainlink or near, there's a couple of things that sort of survive. But when you look at the entire market and the weight of all the other coins, I think it's very much going to be a correlation to one type of trade on the way down, and then on the recovery, that's where we might start getting a completely new set of correlation moves. The reason for that is, I think in the bear market, which not really getting into bear market. I'll clarify that later, but let's just say, like, in a sideways market, you have a lot of months for people to reevaluate the thesis of each and every token, each and every coin. So everything gets reevaluated, re risked. The things that get re risked in a positive way will completely outperform the ones that don't really have a strong story behind them once they're really looked at more carefully.
00:09:20.160 - 00:09:31.748, Speaker A: That's interesting. So it sounds like on a down move or in a bear market, you think correlation will still go to one, but in a bull market, it's possible for there to be a significant decoration. Is that correct?
00:09:31.916 - 00:09:58.502, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we saw this in the last cycle reset, where on the way down, everything was down 90%, and then on the way up. We've had a different set of leaders. Like, the top ten coins are not eos. And I mean, XRP is still up there, sadly, although it's not a top three anymore, but we'll have a different set of top coins that will emerge. So I think that's where the decorrelation will happen.
00:09:58.638 - 00:10:09.634, Speaker A: And why do you think this is? Do you think there's any scenario where decoration couldn't happen, where this bitcoin as king phenomenon will not persist? What has to happen for that to no longer be true?
00:10:10.254 - 00:11:05.144, Speaker C: So the bitcoin thesis will get reevaluated. That's one of the thesis that I think people will re examine during this next sort of choppy period of several months that I'm expecting. I don't expect that the conclusion of that reevaluation will be that, oh, bitcoin actually was just a pet rock. Let's move on to the other 50 coins and forget about it. I very much am a believer that the equilibrium will always involve bitcoin keeping a central role as an asset in the space. That doesn't mean it has to be the biggest asset. You could always have one of the blockchain assets that manages to scale very well and build killer apps like ultimately, whichever blockchain has, the next billion users use it for a killer app that's going to be extremely valuable.
00:11:05.144 - 00:12:13.668, Speaker C: But as a store of value, I think, you know, I very much, as a game theorist, look at Nash Equilibria, and my support of bitcoin is very much from a looking at the end result of if we imagine a world where there is a store of value asset, could it be something else? Could it be Ethereum, or could it be Solana? And I can't see a world where there's huge mass consensus around the world that it's Solana now or it's ethereum or anything else, because the argument would always get made, well, why not bitcoin? It's been first, it's most well known, the most distributed, and something like technology is not going to be a good argument for a store of value. I do think bitcoin has issues that eventually will need to get solved. The 21 million cap, for example. But I can't see a world where as a store of value, there's huge consensus that something else is the store of value across billions of people.
00:12:13.836 - 00:12:49.572, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that bitcoin maximalists will definitely be pissed about the comment about the cap, but I'd get pissed about a lot of things. But I'd love to talk about the thing that most people are probably tuning into this episode for, which is the market outlook for this coming year or whatever time horizon you think is kind of appropriate here. So when I first reached out, you mentioned wanting to kind of monitor start of the year flows, and from that you deduce that we might not be in the optimistic scenario. So firstly, what is the start of year flows that you're kind of monitoring, and what is the significance of it?
00:12:49.748 - 00:14:05.824, Speaker C: Yeah. So for people who trade, you know, actively active managers or active traders, they've probably been very aware that for the last, you know, year plus, at the beginning of the month of every single month, we've had a nice like, burst of activity where all crypto goes up for a few days. It's like a five day period where, you know, funds are putting in their like, new capital that they're deploying. And around, around the middle of the month, we'll have a little bit of a lull, and then in anticipation of the next month, we'll have a little bit of burst. That also happens on a yearly basis. And towards the end of last year, we had so much selling off in the last couple of weeks that there seemed to be a lot of tax related selling, a lot of carry related selling, that theoretically those people, once the calendar year is over, especially us based investors that are using calendar year, would dip back very hard in the market and just redeploy, especially given the discount that they would then be getting. Since we had a dip down into the mid forties, I publicly spoke about there being two scenarios.
00:14:05.824 - 00:14:42.284, Speaker C: Either we would get this really nice start of the year inflow surgeon and we could ride that momentum for a few months, or if we were not able to, given how positive the outlook theoretically should have been at the beginning of the month, it's a very clear sign in my mind that the 1516 month bull run is actually over now and we have a different market structure going forward that will instill a bit more discipline, I think, into investors and will ultimately be a positive.
00:14:42.784 - 00:14:55.164, Speaker A: And is there any scenario where the bitcoin literally happens? Maybe not in January. What gave you the conviction that it has to happen in the start of the year or it won't happen?
00:14:55.864 - 00:15:36.764, Speaker C: I'm always evaluating on the left side, what are the headwinds, on the right side, what are the tailwinds. And January, theoretically, on a macro side, is the best month. Historically, there's always inflows. Markets get a little hop on, like beginning of the year deployment, like I said, and specifically this year, we're very much in a rate hiking year. This has been made obvious recently by the Fed that they will be hiking rates this year. So as we go further along the year, you know, tapering is being accelerated. So the quantitative easing that the Fed is doing is going to be already over by March.
00:15:36.764 - 00:15:58.252, Speaker C: So it's a very fast timeline that they're doing. They've doubled the tapering. So the thesis is, with all the headwinds that are going to exist later and all the tailwinds that we have now with deployment, if we can't get a rally at the beginning of the year, it's a very clear sign, in my opinion, that we're going to have some choppy times ahead.
00:15:58.428 - 00:16:32.088, Speaker A: And to what extent do you think that these news around rate hiking and tapering is already priced intense? I think a lot of these discussions have started even middle of last year, and then a lot of them became kind of the headlines end of last year. And I think folks like Arthur Hayes from Bitmex were writing a lot of blog posts about his outlook for the market. So it seems like generally, even within crypto native folks who may not pay a lot of attention to macro markets, this was kind of known knowledge. So how do we decipher whether something is priced in and assign probabilities that way?
00:16:32.176 - 00:16:59.322, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a really nice way to frame it. So there has been a shift in the Fed recently. For months and months they were saying inflation was transitory. I was very much on the other side expecting that inflation would not go away. We were called inflationistas by the tradfi folks who disagreed with. But then inflation started going up three, four, five, 6%. And now tomorrow we're about to see a potential 7.2%
00:16:59.322 - 00:17:25.531, Speaker C: expected print. We haven't had anything like this in our lifetimes. The last time was in the seventies. So I think the Fed has started to acknowledge that they were quite wrong. And in the last few weeks is when there's been a huge pivot, and now they're pricing in three to four rate hikes this year as opposed to like one to two. So that's quite a material change. But I'm glad you brought up Arthur.
00:17:25.531 - 00:17:55.134, Speaker C: I think so. Here's the positive side of things. We are very oversold. I think there's no way that we're going to stay at these low levels even going forward. The correction that we've seen in equities is in the four to 5%, maybe slightly more if you're looking at Nasdaq instead of S and P, it's a little bit higher there. But the correction that we've seen in crypto, which has been like a 40% to 50% drop, is oversold. And I'm very confident that there will be some bounce.
00:17:55.134 - 00:18:52.910, Speaker C: I think, actually, yesterday was the first day that we found a floor. So there seems to be quite a hard floor around 40k for bitcoin and 3000 for Ethereum. The reason I say that there is a floor is because, because we had another very bad day in equities, and actually crypto rallied. So this kind of signifies that a floor has been found. And if you look at it from a risk reward standpoint, which I always do, if the floor is at ceiling, kind of like the resistance that we've seen is at 52, the balance of risk reward is very much in the 46 to 47k range. So I expect that we will start oscillating towards that range and then stay around that range for a while until a new piece of news that is important enough to change the calculus hits the market again.
00:18:53.062 - 00:19:07.314, Speaker A: That's really interesting. So it sounds like the bearish scenario that you mentioned, that these three to four rate hikes, this high inflation print, you think these are materially baked into the price for crypto markets at least, is that correct?
00:19:07.454 - 00:19:44.264, Speaker C: I think it's over baked in at this point. And you mentioned Arthur, obviously. Arthur Hayes, you know, the ex founder of Bitmax, is a very influential thinker. Since he has some macro background and talks about macro. I think a lot of the crypto whales follow him. I have a suspicion that we might have middle iq'd it a little bit on the crypto side and, like, overcorrected. And, you know, you have this, like, curve where the middle guy is overthinking everything and having all these thesis and the guys at the end are just keeping it very simple.
00:19:44.264 - 00:20:20.480, Speaker C: I think it's possible that we front run the tightening, because the reality is tightening has not happened yet. We still have QQQe is still happening. Like you said, there's a lot of money on the sidelines. Just figure out, do I deploy now? They will have to dip back in at some point. Um, and it's only going to be like very much later in the year once the rate hike started and possibly, like, there's quantitative tightening, that we will start to feel the effects of no liquidity around. But in the meantime, the liquidity is out there. We still have QE, and this is quite overdone.
00:20:20.480 - 00:20:58.476, Speaker C: And you can see how equities are doing fine. I think on the equity side they're actually, they're acting quite rationally. They're saying, okay, we're going to come into some headwind, we need to sell off a little bit. But at the end of the day, the money's been printed, it's in the system, it has to go somewhere, and we'll have to reevaluate what the fair value of something like s and p is. Is it 4400, is it 4600, is it 45? We're not sure. So it's being quite careful. And I think on the crypto side we've just already discounted everything, we've already cut everything by half.
00:20:58.660 - 00:21:10.444, Speaker A: So in that case, it almost sounds like the crypto markets have become a bellwether for traditional markets. Is that something that you thought was possible before? Is that something that you've seen before as well?
00:21:10.564 - 00:21:49.434, Speaker C: I have not seen it before. It blows my mind that this is the case, but I think the reason is the degree of sophistication of crypto whales that own the billions of dollars of assets is much higher than the ETF vanilla deployment of pension funds or everybody else that's in the traditional equity markets. And that's the reason for this canary in a code mine where it's possible that equities end up just lagging crypto because the sophistication is behind.
00:21:49.794 - 00:22:23.738, Speaker A: That's super interesting. That's not something I've thought about before, but it's also really good to get some confluence from you because this is some of you that have circulated to some of my friends, and internally as well, where I do think short term, a lot of the names that we love fundamentally are extremely oversold. But I guess on the more important horizon, especially for the founders and builders out there thinking whether they should be raising right now or maybe delaying the races. What do you think the outlook is for the next six to twelve months, given all you've known about what's happening in the macro markets, what's going to happen with the rate hikes and so on?
00:22:23.866 - 00:23:22.074, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, obviously last year, especially towards the end of last year, was a great environment for raising. There's been huge venture funds that have managed to just raise a couple billion dollars and they need to put it somewhere, or there's other ones that have had hundred x's that they need to roll into something. And we've very much seen easy liquidity. For founders, the secondary market has not been as hot, which is creating quite an arbitrage, where if you have a new idea. It's possible that you have a higher valuation and you can raise more for the completely new idea as opposed to the same exact idea a year later. With a team and halfway there might have a harder time getting capital. So I think that's a little bit of an arbitrage that will get worked out over the year, and it's purely based on which funds are looking to deploy.
00:23:22.074 - 00:23:36.834, Speaker C: So a good time to raise would have been late last year and possibly soon again if the market does recover a little bit and at least recapture some of these 45k levels.
00:23:37.214 - 00:24:32.810, Speaker B: Now before I continue, I'd love to share one of my favorite products in crypto with you. Now whenever I want to trade a token instead of going to uniswap sushiswap Bancor one by one to see where I can find the best quote, I just go to Paraswap to scan for the best price anywhere, because Periswap aggregates all the popular Ethereum dexs and saves me a ton of time and headache in finding where I can trade something for the best price and lets me trade in one place. Now the cool thing is they've also integrated with ledger live as well, meaning I can now swap at the best prices directly from my ledger wallet. So seriously, if you are a defi trader and you're worried about the security risks of centralized exchanges, but you also don't want to scour dozens of dexs just to the best price, you have to check out Paraswap. So head on over to Paraswap IO blockcrunch. I'd also love to take a moment to talk about the Hbar foundation. Now, if you approached me one to two years ago, I would tell you I'm really skeptical of layer one systems outside of Ethereum.
00:24:32.810 - 00:25:18.696, Speaker B: But in the past twelve months, I started to notice billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of users flocking to new blockchains left and right. And then I realized there's an actual market gap being filled. And I always love to support projects who support builders, and one of those projects is Hedera Hashgraph. Hedera is an enterprise grade public network with its own crypto asset called HbAr, and the Hbar foundation has launched, with an initial budget of over $2 billion, to provide entrepreneurs with the funding and ecosystem support needed to quickly build and deploy new applications on the Hedera Hashgraph network. The Hbar foundation is eager to find builders in defi nfts, gaming, sustainability, and all sectors. So if you are a builder, a developer, or creator with an idea visit hbarfoundation.org to learn more.
00:25:18.696 - 00:25:57.508, Speaker B: Now, before I continue, if you follow me on Twitter, you know that I've described the recent months as the most uncertain time in crypto. So this is a great time to talk a little bit about notional. Now, notional finance is the leading fixed rate borrowing and lending protocol, and with version two, you can now borrow and lend at fixed rates for up to one year. You can lend a portion of your crypto assets at a fixed rate, and this brings certainty and stability to your portfolio. No matter what happens in the market, especially in a time like this. Stablecoin lend yields currently hover around 10% and returns come from organic yield that borrowers are actually paying on the platform. So there's complete transparency on the platform and zero counterparty risk.
00:25:57.508 - 00:26:10.674, Speaker B: And we've actually talked with the founder of Notional as well, Teddy, on the show recently. And as a happy investor, I've been really impressed with how the team is shipping notional v two. So you can check it out today at Notional Finance blockcrunch.
00:26:10.834 - 00:26:25.538, Speaker A: And I guess on that note, in this environment where things might be oversold in the short term, but there are some maybe macro headwinds and a lot of uncertainty, what would you say are the pockets of opportunities? What are the areas that you would be spending the most time on?
00:26:25.666 - 00:27:27.582, Speaker C: I mean, I think the hot things like the metaverse plays and the gaming plays are interesting. A lot of them have huge ftvs already. So with all the unlocks that are going to be happening over the next twelve months, I'm not extremely interested in some of these very big names. The opportunities that I'm most excited about, I would say, are either on the infrastructure side. So kind of creating that next level of either cross chain technology, something like layer zero, I'm extremely fascinated about to see what they're going to be able to do for really increasing cross chain communication. Something like pocket network that's going to offer decentralized nodes. These type of plays, I think are more interesting than the overvalued, possibly hype plays on the gaming and metaverse side.
00:27:27.758 - 00:27:53.276, Speaker A: Got it. And just to kind of synthesize what we've discussed so far, I think it's really interesting because this is probably the most conflict I've seen between my friends who are CIO's and traders of different funds. Some of them are completely sidelined, some of them are extremely long, some of them are going short. So in terms of how you would kind of position, maybe for the next three to six months, kind of, just roughly. How are you thinking about kind of positioning there?
00:27:53.420 - 00:28:42.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, you know, we're getting into a barbell approach where, you know, a positioning with bitcoin and Ethereum makes sense on the one side because like I said, they are oversold. We should see a bounce and the bear market or. Okay, I'll stop using the word bear market because I think we're not necessarily going to enter a bear market, but the bull market's over. So it's not going to be like last year where at the beginning of the year you could choose any coin in the top hundred, and at the end of the year you would be up like an average of, you know, three to six x. That's not really on the cards this year. So when I say the end of the bull market, I mean, you very much have to be more disciplined in how you're investing and when you're deploying. So it gets into a little bit of a PvP situation.
00:28:42.194 - 00:29:35.578, Speaker C: I think a lot of the mid tier coins will have to prove themselves as opposed to just like joining the liquidity wave that they did last year. So in terms of positioning, I think EBTC, I'm looking for them to regain their narratives. So the bitcoin narrative as the sort of safe store value will get rebuilt. I believe in a sideways market because the shelling point starts to matter again. People are looking for something to follow, especially if a lot of things are bleeding. I think the bitcoin narrative will go up. The other reason I think bitcoin might have a resurgence later in the year is if we do end up in a stagflationary environment, which means inflation will not go away, it will persist in the three, four, 5% range, and at the same time, growth will go down.
00:29:35.578 - 00:30:06.636, Speaker C: So GDP will suffer in that stagflationary environment. I think it's perfectly suited for bitcoin. That's where it's going to shine, and I think that's where the next wave of both retail institutions might come in. On the Ethereum side, obviously we have the merge at some point going on, and then we'll have to see kind of how sharding progresses. But Ethereum has also lost its narrative. It's very much gone into alternative l one s. They're each having their moment in the sun.
00:30:06.636 - 00:30:54.048, Speaker C: I think it's quite healthy in a way, because we're giving a chance to every single potentially strong technology to be tested. We're giving it an ecosystem. There is this rotation which is memed around you've gone from Solana and then it's Luna and obviously avalanche, and then you have the next tier. Now, the harmonies and mirrors. I think that's quite healthy because we're very much in the experimental phase of giving every technology a chance to show us why it's better than the other ones. And I think later in the year, the rotation will stop and the entire market will sort of look at the results and choose winners amongst everybody.
00:30:54.216 - 00:31:04.110, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot to unpack there. And first, I'd love to kind of get your thoughts on what you meant by a PvP situation. Has it happened before and what can people expect from that?
00:31:04.182 - 00:31:51.414, Speaker C: Yeah, PvP basically. I mean, in the sense that the market cap of crypto as a whole is going to grow slower than it did last year. Obviously, it really exploded. And in that situation, it's more around putting pair trades on and one thing's going to go down, another thing's going to go up. So within a sector like l one's, Cardano will have to prove its smart contract capabilities versus, you know, Avalanche will have to show its thesis and it becomes, it could be a little bit toxic in, you know, Twitter, crypto, Twitter forums and stuff because not everybody's going to be winning and it's going to be very much like certain teams are going to be able to push through. It's going to be a little bit messy in that sense. That's why I call it like a peak, like a player versus player situation.
00:31:51.414 - 00:32:00.140, Speaker C: But I think in the long run, it's going to be healthy because we're really going to be testing the assumptions of which narratives and which technology is superior.
00:32:00.292 - 00:32:24.184, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great to hear because our first fund at Spartan is structured as a long, short fund. So that's kind of our bread and butter to kind of find these opportunities. So it's good to hear that the market seems to be converging towards more efficiency and towards that situation. And when you mentioned that a stagflation environment is good for bitcoin, does that extend to crypto as well, or is that mostly just a bitcoin argument?
00:32:25.044 - 00:33:29.864, Speaker C: It's a bitcoin only argument because the rest of crypto trades a little bit more like tech stocks. In many ways, they are tech stocks, and tech stocks suffer quite a bit in this type of environment because rates are going up, liquidity is decreasing, and PE ratios go down, which are very much the lifeblood of tech stocks because everything is in the future, all the potential revenue is years away. As you increase rates. Those have to get discounted to the present. The stagflation environment is more of a desperation play where people's purchasing power just keeps dwindling, prices keep going up, and we were very much seeing this already, like with basic food all the way up to real estate, as that doesn't go away and the growth is not there to back it up. People are not getting a 40% return on their 401 ks to make up for the 40% increase in real estate prices. So people start getting a bit more desperate.
00:33:29.864 - 00:33:46.688, Speaker C: That's where the shelling point starts coming in, and people are looking for answers, and they start educating themselves and figuring out, is gold an answer? Maybe not anymore. It could be bitcoin. So I think maybe that's where the bitcoin only narrative towards the end of the year might pick up again.
00:33:46.836 - 00:34:06.096, Speaker A: And just to wrap up this part of the conversation around market outlook, I really enjoy the way that you think about things kind of in a probabilistic way. So can you maybe lay out for the listeners just to kind of synthesize what we've discussed? What are the different scenarios you foresee playing out in the market, and what are the probabilities that you will assign to each of them?
00:34:06.240 - 00:35:04.844, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, in terms of big picture scenarios, the one tail risk is the Fed completely changes direction and decides that they're not able to raise rates. This could end up being a positive or negative, depending on how much inflation is out of control. I think the things that would make them change direction and not tighten as they're planning to are not likely at all. A lot of people are used to them pivoting. I think we saw in 2018, we had a ten to 15% equity correction over Christmas, and Powell did a famous pivot where he just kind of backed off the tightening. I would say that the environment is completely different now with six 7% inflation, and the Fed is very much going to continue on this path of tightening. I see very low chances, maybe like 5% chance that by the end of the year they haven't raised rates at least once or twice.
00:35:04.844 - 00:36:05.416, Speaker C: From a crypto side, what I'm looking at is what's the probability that we enter a proper bear market like we did in 2018 2019, where, you know, bitcoin goes back to in the twenties and, you know, ETH is back to, like, the one to two k range again, that's maybe like another tail risk that I would say is about 10%. I think it's quite unlikely because the liquidity is out there. Everything is inflated. And at the end of the day, 20k bitcoin is worth 500 billion or less. It's at that point such a small market cap that it would be very easy for a few institutions to pick it up. So I can't put more than 10% chance of really entering a proper bear market. We will stay at least sideways with at least like an 80% chance.
00:36:05.416 - 00:36:36.630, Speaker C: And then maybe there's like a 10% right tail of getting some very positive news, which is going to be the sort of news like Apple is putting bitcoin and ethereum on their balance sheet, or a major country is following El Salvador's lead and really putting bitcoin or cryptocurrency as a core center of their economy. If we get that type of news, I think regardless of macro, we will still see a huge growth in the space for this year.
00:36:36.782 - 00:37:09.798, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you for laying out that distribution. So 10% chance of a full blown 2018 bear market, I guess 80% chance of a sideways market, and perhaps a 10% tail chance of positive news. That's super clear. I really appreciate you laying that out. And Jordy, for the final part of the discussion, for the remaining time that we have, I'd love to learn more about the actual process that you use as well, because it's always good to kind of spoon feed listeners information, but I think it's more useful to kind of teach them how to think as well. So there are a few things that I prepared that I'd love to ask you on.
00:37:09.798 - 00:37:42.214, Speaker A: I guess the first one is about bet sizing. So how do you kind of size your bets? Right? Do you kind of put in teaser position sizes? And I think this applies to both traders, investors, and also founders, because a lot of founders may want to kind of tease out an idea when they're working a full time job before they go all in, which is not dissimilar to how traders maybe put on 1% position and then size in their whole portfolio or portion of a portfolio. So is there a science to kind of how you think about sizing bets in both investing and in kind of your life decisions?
00:37:42.674 - 00:38:26.222, Speaker C: There's two general approaches to it. One is a very systematic approach where you, you know, like you said, you have a 1% for every bet and you just keep making 1% bets. And, you know, it really depends on your style and personality, I would say if you want to go very structured, and I think for a lot of people, not having to think about bet sizing is the best option. So, you know, just setting rules, you know, I'm going to have 35% allocation to this thing, and I'm just going to automatically rebalance it and that's it. I think that works for a lot of people and reduces their stress level. For me personally, I'm trying to maximize ev. So my bet sizing very much depends on the level of conviction.
00:38:26.222 - 00:39:25.454, Speaker C: And the level of conviction comes from. Can I see a very clear path for something playing out? Can I really see from the beginning to the end, these are the things that need to happen? I think they're all likely, they're sort of lined up as dominoes. And in those sort of situations, the question in my head is not really, should I put 1% or 2%? It's more what is the maximum bet that will not potentially create a tail risk? So it's sort of like a Kelly criterion. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the Kelly criterion, but it basically says, how can I maximize my return without having a chance of going broke? Because you do want to stay in the game. You never want to, whether you're investing or just building something, the worst situation is if you're liquidated or if you're forced out. So you think about the worst case scenario that can possibly happen, and you say, okay, even if that happens, I need to be okay. I need to survive it.
00:39:25.454 - 00:39:39.164, Speaker C: What's the maximum, if I have a lot of conviction, what's the maximum size that I could take that will keep me okay even if things go wrong and let me do the maximum. So that's pretty much my approach.
00:39:39.314 - 00:40:04.856, Speaker A: Got it. That's super interesting because this is something that I do, at least for my personal investments as well, kind of a modified type of Kelly. I think my issue with it is it always suggests sizes that seem so big that I need to maybe either refine my, the probability that I assign to it being correct, or I need to kind of just tough it up a little bit. But, yeah, I always find it to be a bit aggressive for my taste. Yeah. And I guess another question that I have was about table selection. Right.
00:40:04.856 - 00:40:36.060, Speaker A: So many traders look at VC returns in a bull market, and they started VC funds, and then many venture funds look at trading funds returns in kind of sideways or bear markets, and they started liquid arms. And similarly, a lot of founders, they look at, hey, these guys are starting gaming projects, maybe we should pivot over. And it started to incorporate gaming elements into their defi projects and vice versa. So in terms of how do you pick the right game to play as someone who is well versed in game theory. What is your framework for thinking about table selection?
00:40:36.212 - 00:41:27.234, Speaker C: I think different opportunities arise in different environments. That's kind of why built Cellini to be a multi strat is the thing that's going to make you money in Q one, might not be the same thing that makes you money in Q two. So we very much want to have the opportunity to be in yield farming. If there's amazing yield farming opportunities, we want to be able to deploy a lot of capital there quickly. If there's very large basis positions to be put on, if there's a lot of cross exchange opportunities, we want to be there for that. And if the venture environment presents opportunities like it has for the last couple of years, then we want to be able to add value for founders and be a part of it as well. So if you're able to do that, I think obviously that's great and you can take advantage of all the environments.
00:41:27.234 - 00:42:06.978, Speaker C: For a founder, pivoting is totally fine. We've seen a lot of successful pivots, but just kind of tacking on the flavor of the month and adding an NFT to your sports betting operation or kind of trying to ride a wave of ve voting rights for your token where it doesn't make sense or whatever the buzzword is of the day. I would very much discourage people to try to follow that game and maybe kind of focus on what's going to actually be around and create value for the next few years.
00:42:07.106 - 00:42:22.030, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you for that. And as the final question, Jordy, any parting thoughts for the investors listening out there? If you have to look at, say like three things that are most important for you to keep track of in this uncertain time, what would those things be?
00:42:22.202 - 00:43:00.530, Speaker C: You know, one thing that I do quite differently to a lot of other short term traders is I look for value. I'm not really trying to buy breakouts. You know, a lot of people will say, yeah, I'm out of the market completely. Once we recapture 55, then I'm going to be back in. And that's like my sign that like, you know, we're back in business. I very much look at it from a value standpoint and I think it's undervalued right now to just say, okay, well, I'm not going to wait for 55 because maybe 55 is the fair value. So I'm going to buy in at 40 and just wait as long as it takes for 55 to come.
00:43:00.530 - 00:43:41.034, Speaker C: And that's okay, I can be patient. So I think one piece of advice is to be a bit more value oriented rather than trying to just ride a momentum wave when it's already being created. I think that worked well last year because you had so many 1020 xs that you could miss the first two x and still capture the large size of the move. But that might not be the case going forward. So that's one thing. The next piece of advice, I would say, is keep your mental health and your focus as strong as possible. If you're experiencing a lot of volatility in your portfolio and it's starting to affect how you think.
00:43:41.034 - 00:44:23.394, Speaker C: It's kind of what we see in poker where, you know, a player has a few bad beats and they start playing really badly. Like, they go on tilt and they're not playing their A game anymore. It's their C game. And that C game might not be good enough to win. So I would say prioritize, you know, keeping even in tough periods, a very good mindset where you can still make clear decisions and not get into kind of like a negative spiral there. And lastly, yeah, I would say balance the belief that we have in crypto, because we all obviously are in this space. We see the long term potential, and we really think it's the future.
00:44:23.394 - 00:45:01.222, Speaker C: Balance the endgame, which is eventually everything will be huge and everything will be amazing to reality. I think sometimes we get a little bit stuck in our bubbles on Twitter and elsewhere with the people around us who are all believers. We're all converts, and we forget that, you know, for normal people, they're very much scared to have custody. For example, you know, there's been a survey recently that showed that that's the. Even for institutions, worry about custody is such a huge thing. They're not entering the space until, like, that thing gets resolved. So keep in mind that, you know, some things still need to get built out from an infrastructure standpoint.
00:45:01.222 - 00:45:06.094, Speaker C: And even though it's the future, we have to be a little bit patient on the path.
00:45:06.434 - 00:45:14.618, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think that's a great note to end this on. So thank you so much, Rorty, for taking the time. And just to pluck your socials, what's the best way for anyone to kind of follow your insights?
00:45:14.786 - 00:45:21.466, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm only active on Twitter, but I'm quite active there so they can follow me at game theorizing.
00:45:21.610 - 00:45:24.186, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks so much for taking the time, Jordy. This has been fun.
00:45:24.290 - 00:45:24.914, Speaker C: Thank you so much.
