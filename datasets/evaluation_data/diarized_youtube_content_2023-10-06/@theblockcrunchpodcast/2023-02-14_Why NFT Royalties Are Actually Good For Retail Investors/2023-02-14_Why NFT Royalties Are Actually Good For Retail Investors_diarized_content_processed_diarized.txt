00:00:00.240 - 00:00:37.166, Speaker A: A lot of creators like they, like I said, they do not have a lot of social consensus around them when they started off and it's actually very unhealthy from my perspective. A lot of these collections, they're just starting off as a very high primary sale price because it means there might not be as much turnover after their first initial sales and then maybe that collection just died down in one week. It's very similar to a lot of these secondary market trading. You have very high market cap launch and then like it hurts all the retail who participated because yeah, I don't have to explain. You understand what I'm talking about. So same idea. Like look at Yuga Labs.
00:00:37.166 - 00:00:56.054, Speaker A: Like they launched at a, it's freeman at the beginning and it took a very long time for them to build their social consensus. So like having royalty, having a low primary sales initial starting point, it's actually good for the community because it will enable a very slow and organic community growth.
