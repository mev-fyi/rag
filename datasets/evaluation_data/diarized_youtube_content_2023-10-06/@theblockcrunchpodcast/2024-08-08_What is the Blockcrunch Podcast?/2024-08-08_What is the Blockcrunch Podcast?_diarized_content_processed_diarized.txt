00:00:00.360 - 00:00:40.866, Speaker A: Here's 60 seconds about Blockcrunch, the only podcast in web3 hosted by a full time investor since 2018. I'm your host, Jason Choi. I was the general partner at one of Asia's first crypto hedge funds, where we ranked number one in returns for consecutive years. Now I invest my own capital alongside my partner at Tangent, where we back web3 founders from Seed stage two liquid markets in crypto and adjacent technologies. On Blockcrunch, my podcast and passion project, I interview the most influential founders and investors in the space, breaking down their thesis, approach and thought processes. On our roundtable series, we cover the lay of the land of the latest long term trends that VC's are looking at. And on our on a Tangent series, I'm joined by my co founder Daryl to share our latest thoughts on what's happening in the market right now.
00:00:40.866 - 00:00:59.590, Speaker A: If they listen to like a block crunch, I think it's better. So you really just gotta double down on your intuition. So if you're an investor, trader, founder, or anyone with some skin in the game, in a crypto space, or simply want to get started, make sure to subscribe on YouTube or any of your favorite podcasting apps and I'll see you on the show.
