00:00:00.240 - 00:00:13.598, Speaker A: Looking back $450 million at a $4 billion valuation for Yugalabs, it's either going to look like a genius move ten years from now, or the most obvious, insanely overvalued thing.
00:00:13.726 - 00:00:21.046, Speaker B: Web three offers a brand new petri dish. Our job is to buy great tech at great prices. AI is also libertarian enable use case.
00:00:21.070 - 00:00:22.606, Speaker A: That people haven't been able to do today.
00:00:22.670 - 00:00:26.270, Speaker B: The next hundreds of millions of players, they will come to the market through mobile.
00:00:26.342 - 00:01:16.466, Speaker A: My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next twelve months is hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrench podcast. My name is Jason Choi. I am an angel investor and co founder of my angel investing vehicle Tangent, where we back both founders building zero to one ideas in crypto. Now, some of you have been asking what's with the hiatus? How come we haven't uploaded an episode for the past few weeks? I haven't been on holiday. The reason is because we're trying to do a soft reboot of the show and test out a new format, which we're going to show you today. And the reason for that is a lot of folks over the past few years have been asking for my personal view on projects, which I don't really get to share much through a one on one interview. It's usually mostly the founder telling us about the project, which is all great and fun.
00:01:16.466 - 00:02:24.054, Speaker A: But a lot of you have also been asking for more input about the projects we bring on from our side. So we decided to experiment with this new format where it's more of a roundtable fireside discussion between me and a very special co host that I'm going to introduce very soon. And this new format I think will be quite interesting for investors or founders looking to get an insider's take of projects, trends and important topics in crypto rather than scripted PR mouthpieces. So hopefully this will be very interesting. And for the very, very first episode of this new iteration of the show, we're going to start with something a little bit more timeless. Instead of picking one or two projects that's hot right now and commenting on what we think about them, we're going to go down a trip to memory lane and talk about the five most wildly ambitious and outlandish ideas that we've ever seen funded by VC's in the last cycle. And what I thought was interesting as we went through this list as well, is that each of these companies in themselves are emblematic of one phase of the bull market that we had since 20 21 type of product that tend to raise a lot of capital and get a lot of interest.
00:02:24.054 - 00:02:55.106, Speaker A: This one will be quite interesting. Hope you enjoy this. If you have any thoughts about this new format or this new experiment, let me know in the comments on YouTube or tag me on Twitter. Or if you follow me on Friendtech, message me there as well. So without further ado, I'd love to introduce our co host. So, Sanat is my former colleague from Spartan when I was still working there, and he has since left to join one of the largest funds in crypto, which I have a ton of respect for as. As well as one of the few funds that we actually co invest well with quite a bit.
00:02:55.106 - 00:02:59.530, Speaker A: So, Sana, welcome to the show, and why don't you give yourself a little bit of an introduction, man. Yeah.
00:02:59.562 - 00:03:29.740, Speaker B: Hey, excited to be here. Jason is my mentor and one of the people who got me into crypto. So this is like a really fun way to bring all of our collective knowledge together, hopefully. I've been crypto investor professionally for the last more than two and a half years. Spend a lot of my time, spend my time exclusively on the venture investing side now. And prior to that, I was a data scientist at Uber, but fell very, very deep down the DeFi rabbit hole and never quite came back up.
00:03:29.932 - 00:04:03.200, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think the interesting story here is when we were looking for analysts back at Spartan, we did this ridiculously difficult test that had no reason to be so granular. We were asking very specific things like, okay, what is the exact TVL of this project at this date? And there's only two people out of a pool of 50 that actually got most of the questions correct. And I think you are one of them. The other person who got it correct, I think you know who it is. But unfortunately, he couldn't get legal clearance from his fund to get on the show. So unfortunately, he's not able to co host with us. But otherwise we would have three people.
00:04:03.200 - 00:04:52.812, Speaker A: But just as a disclaimer, everything we discussed is just our personal views. Nothing is financial advice and is not reflective of the official opinions of our respective firms, Tangent and Dragonfly. So, to kick us off today, we're going to talk about four or five ridiculous ideas. I think over the past two weeks, Sanad, you and I went through like hundreds of companies, probably in our minds, that got funded over the past few years and found maybe four or five of these that we think are pretty crazy. So just to clarify, when I say crazy, this is not based on size of the race. Obviously there are some crazily large raises. But it's not just based on the size of the race, it's not based on spectacular fraud, because we all know who that would be, but it's purely just based on how wacky and weird the idea is, and I think how emblematic it is of one aspect of crypto.
00:04:52.812 - 00:05:33.822, Speaker A: So I'll start us off here. The first one that I want to talk about is Yugalabs. So just to kind of give our audience a little bit of a context about what the hell Yuga labs is, I'm sure if you haven't heard of Yuga Labs, you've heard of bored apes. So these were the NFTs that I think really had a cultural moment, because I don't know if you remember, but Steph Curry and all these celebrities were all rocking bored ape NFTs on their twitter. And I think Jimmy Fallon had one. And obviously, I think subsequently the PR teams probably told him to take it off because NFTs are total scam now, apparently. But Yugalabs is the company that issued these bored apes NFTs.
00:05:33.822 - 00:06:03.414, Speaker A: And I actually found their pitch deck that is publicly available right now. It got leaked right before they announced that they raised $450 million at a $4 billion valuation. I think this was back in like 2021. So this is a 90 page pitch deck. I'm not going to go through all of it here. For those of you who are watching this on video, I'm just pulling up the deck on the screen to give you a sense of what the deck looks like. But it is a pretty interesting story.
00:06:03.414 - 00:06:45.904, Speaker A: What Yugalabs is doing is effectively issuing different nfts. So there's the main board ape ones, but there's also a different series of nfts with different characters and also this virtual plots of land for a virtual world that they promised to create called otherside. And they allegedly made $320 million selling these virtual plots of land for a world that doesn't exist just yet. So if you look at the revenues they made in 2022. Sorry, this deck is from 2022, not 2021. So 66% of the revenues came from these land sales. And they were basically just selling different variations of virtual goods.
00:06:45.904 - 00:07:36.824, Speaker A: So if you look at the breakdown, they sold some things called goblins. There's like basies, which is the board apes. There's like mechanical dogs, mecca apes, just different flavors of nfts. So when I was thinking about how to describe this company, I was thinking, okay, is this like a consumer brands company? Are they just selling toys? But they're all just happen to be virtual. And then I realized that the best proxy is probably a gaming company, something like Fortnite, where you have all these gamers that are buying skins that are not necessary for the gameplay. They're just buying it for almost like a social status, like a social symbol. And just for context, I think Fortnite, I was looking this up before we started recording Fortnite made about how much did it make? Something to the tune of like $3 billion.
00:07:36.824 - 00:08:32.714, Speaker A: Sorry, $6 billion in revenue in 2022, just selling skins, and they're valued at $32 billion. So five extra revenue. So I thought that was probably the best proxy for what Yugalabs is. And the reason why I think it's so crazy is just because of the sheer amount of these virtual, some would say useless, digital assets that they were able to sell just based on a promise and the fact that they seem to have really accentuated a cultural moment in crypto history. But I'm actually very curious what you think about this, Ana, because you and I were both part of the same metaverse based fund in a previous employer, and we looked at hundreds of metaverses together. Do you think this is actually like a sustainable business model to center an entire business around just selling virtual goods? And how many pots of virtual land can you possibly sell 2510 years from now? Right?
00:08:33.494 - 00:09:15.566, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a couple of things. One is that I do think virtual goods will be big. You described the Fortnite thing, and so if the question is, like, is there a sustainable model around selling virtual goods? I totally think there is. And I'm, like, a huge believer in this idea that we spend so much of our money on lifestyle and status generally, you buy cars, you buy watches, you buy nice. And increasingly, our life is digital. And if you kind of see Instagram, I feel like is the first instance of this where now you spend money on physical goods, like real world experiences, you travel somewhere just to kind of be able to post an Instagram of what you did to kind of signal status. And that actually feels super kind of stupid at some level.
00:09:15.566 - 00:09:29.334, Speaker B: It's like you are in a digital world, but you're, like, using real world items to display status. And so I'm like someone who thinks that you can expect two to three orders of magnitude more spending on digital goods in the next decade.
00:09:29.914 - 00:10:03.014, Speaker A: Wow. That's because I think I was actually very, very surprised by this. I don't know if you were when the metaverse stuff really started taking off, because even now, I think uglabs was projecting that they're going to make like $539 million in 2022 for revenue. I think the actual number ended up being 137 billion, but still, hundred million dollars worth of just purely virtual stuff being sold for a game that doesn't exist yet. I thought that was like. I just don't know if that's something that you can repeat. It seems like a one off to me.
00:10:03.754 - 00:10:30.726, Speaker B: Yeah, I kind of agree. And I also feel like Yuga, in a weird way, if you compare it to what crypto punks are like, it felt like there was this one moment when everyone was like, are you a crypto punk person or are you an eight person? And you're signaling something. And then Yuga became about much, much more. It was like, okay, there's a metaverse, there's other side, there's land sales. You're going to have a game, and it's a far more ambitious technical project. And I think. I actually don't think that may have been the right path.
00:10:30.726 - 00:10:47.444, Speaker B: If you just think of status signaling, I think punks are great in some fashion because there's nothing else going on. There's just a punk. You own it. It's a small piece of art. It's existed for a long time, and there's no claim that this is going to be worth something more. There's no claim that you'll have a game, you'll have friends in the metaverse. There's none of that.
00:10:47.444 - 00:11:27.974, Speaker B: And so I almost feel a little bit like those paths, dependency with Yuga, where they kind of decided that they're going to build a whole bunch of stuff, and that kind of led them to struggle. I do want to touch a little bit on the idea of virtual land. I remember when we were discussing this stuff previously, there was lots of debates. People used to love having this debate about, okay, in a virtual world, there's no cost of transport, really. And so does that mean, like, land that is near the center of a virtual world or like, a special place in the virtual world is worth more? It's worth less. Like, why does it really matter? Because in theory, I can get from anywhere in a virtual world to anywhere else in a virtual world. All this scarcity is artificial.
00:11:27.974 - 00:11:34.014, Speaker B: So I'm curious, actually, do you feel like digital land makes any sense as a notion?
00:11:34.434 - 00:12:22.174, Speaker A: I had a phase when I was quite bullish on this, and I think the thesis was pretty clear, right? If you create an economy in a virtual world, it makes sense that the real estate will be worth something, because the analogy I drew was basically, ad space. It's very similar to ad space you have on any website you visit. But it just so happens that this ad space is represented as real estate. Does it make sense for different plots of land to be worth different things? I think so. In a similar way that the top banner on a website is probably going to get higher cost per click than a bottom banner. I think in that sense it might make sense, but I think this thesis really has not been validated. I think the market has gone way ahead of what reality actually is.
00:12:22.174 - 00:12:55.434, Speaker A: I remember when we were back at Spartan, we were testing out sandbox, for instance, and there's four dudes in the entire world that's online at the same time. For a multi billion dollar metaverse, I think this idea of virtual worlds is still very, very early. Would I invest in virtual worlds? Maybe at a company level, but in terms of plots of land, I still find it quite hard to see a very compelling case for them before we had actual traffic in these worlds, because the ad space is not going to be worth anything if they're still want to click on the ads.
00:12:56.814 - 00:13:37.018, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that makes a ton of sense. And one of the challenges with some of this metaverse stuff was that I feel like the trajectory was that we've been talking about the metaverse outside of crypto for a long time, and we have companies that are building VR stuff, AR stuff. Some of it has worked out. For the most part it hasn't. And it feels like the tech experience isn't quite there yet. And I think the best we've got is something like Fortnite, where kids love hanging out in Fortnite and just spending time with each other. And then one of the things I noticed is that when crypto games started taking off with Axie and people were getting excited about virtual worlds, it felt like a ton of crypto projects would promise things that were just not technically feasible.
00:13:37.018 - 00:14:23.560, Speaker B: They would promise these metaverse experiences that were just outstanding, these VR based things. I remember seeing a bunch of VR and AR crypto startups when we were looking at them, and none of that stuff was people had been working on that stuff outside of crypto, and I feel like people just got swept up in this mania. And I think one of the things that happens is it felt so real. One of the other things I was thinking about with the other projects is that it felt very real, the metaverse stuff, the axie stuff. And I think sometimes it's worth just paying attention to the fact that a lot of this tech doesn't work. Metaverse experiences kind of suck. Whether you hang out in virtual worlds, using oculus, trying to coordinate with friends, all of this stuff is just kind of shitty right now.
00:14:23.560 - 00:14:28.284, Speaker B: And so it's not like crypto is going to bring a huge unlock when the tech just kind of doesn't exist.
00:14:28.704 - 00:15:19.624, Speaker A: Yeah, I think crypto always has this way of creeping into what is the latest growing tech and kind of try to spin a narrative that crypto can somehow improve this tech. But I think a huge validation moment for yuga Labs was probably meta renaming the company when Mark Zuckerberg went all in into virtual reality and metaverse. That really convinced people that, hey, maybe there is a commercial use case for this, maybe this is not just games. But so far, in terms of, if you dig into the actual financials for Yuga labs, the way they've made money is, number one, they sell nfts for bored apes and they sell these lands, and they also sold ape tokens. So they created a token which they say is basically the in world virtual currency, right, this, this apecoin, which has just not performed very well since the. Since the launch. But, you know, they can say that about any token.
00:15:19.624 - 00:16:06.900, Speaker A: But it seems to me like the key business model here for metaverse companies is to continue selling certain assets that are expected to have some value in the future. So the entire business model is still very much based on speculation and not quite supported by utility beyond the social status symbol. So I think this is the reason why I thought this is such a crazy example of excess. I'm still quite excited. I hope something takes off with other side, which is their metaverse. But looking back, $450 million at a 4 billion valuation for Yugalabs, it's either going to look like a genius move ten years from now, or the most obvious, insanely overvalued thing. And I think just one last note on Yugalabs as well.
00:16:06.900 - 00:16:38.126, Speaker A: I was trying to look up the founders yesterday, and surprisingly, neither of the founders have gaming backgrounds. When I looked into this, I thought, okay, both of them are probably gaming devs. They're trying to create a virtual world business model was extremely similar to gaming companies. But Wiley Arono and Greg Solano, I think Greg actually follows me on Twitter. I don't think either of them have gaming backgrounds. And Greg actually grew up wanting to be a writer. So I thought that was really interesting because there is an element of crafting a narrative around the lore inside the metaverse as well.
00:16:38.126 - 00:16:52.518, Speaker A: That's quite important. I thought this was a really interesting example. But I think, for the time being, we should move on to the next juicy company that we thought was crazy. I know you have a few in your pocket that you want to talk about.
00:16:52.686 - 00:17:25.474, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like one of the most interesting ones is definitely worldcoin. And I feel like it's fun to discuss, mostly because it's controversial, and a ton of people in crypto hate it. And I'm probably in a minority who's at least to some degree, a world coin. Stan. I think it's, like, one of the coolest ideas, and I just start by level setting, which is that I think one of the things that happens is that I really do feel like, just as upleveling people's ambition in crypto is super important. And I actually feel like, in the bear market, that you kind of lose that vibe a little bit.
00:17:26.174 - 00:17:32.310, Speaker A: William, wait, you want to explain the idea of worldcoin a little bit for those who have not seen the orb, who have not looked into the orb yet?
00:17:32.502 - 00:18:14.494, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And so worldcoin is basically privacy preserving, proof of person protocol, which is a lot of words. And so what that means is that basically, one of the challenges that has happened with civil resistance is a huge challenge, both within crypto and outside of crypto. And the only way that we have feasibly solved these problems for the time being is really government identification systems, which both aren't really usable within crypto, but also kind of suffer from a ton of privacy and power risks. And so Worldcoin was basically founded on this idea that, okay, we. Proof of personhood and civil resistance is super important. And there's kind of an underlying theme here, which is that they.
00:18:14.494 - 00:18:58.184, Speaker B: This was funded by the OpenAI CEO, and they obviously believe that as AI comes and takes more and more jobs, ubi experimentation, which is just the idea of giving everyone in the world a certain amount of money, is super important. And so they founded Worldcoin. And the idea here is just that, okay, Worldcoin creates these ops where you go and scan your eyeball. And just for context, I was like, I scanned my eyeball at the first opportunity I got to do so. So I have some skin in the game here. Essentially, you go, you scan your eyeball. The orb kind of creates a hash of the data you've scanned, confirms that no one else in the world has the same eyeball.
00:18:58.184 - 00:19:28.098, Speaker B: And once they've confirmed that you are unique, they essentially give you access to a world id, which is only accessible by you, in theory, and proves that you're a real person. And other people can build upon the system by only giving airdrops to verified worldcoin users, by trying to distribute resources to them. And the UBI aspect is already at play here, where people who, worldcoin users who have a verified or who have verified their eyeballs essentially get access to a small airdrop every week. Every week?
00:19:28.146 - 00:19:30.694, Speaker A: I didn't know it was every week. I thought it was like a one time thing.
00:19:30.994 - 00:19:44.062, Speaker B: No, I think it's like recurring every couple of weeks, maybe. But, yeah, you continually get how they are trying the UBI experimentation. It's really small. It's like, I think it's less than $510. Like, I stopped claiming it, if I'm being honest. It's not like, and this is all.
00:19:44.078 - 00:19:48.102, Speaker A: In the WLD, like the world coin token, right? It's not like USDT or anything.
00:19:48.198 - 00:19:48.834, Speaker B: Yes.
00:19:50.654 - 00:20:00.590, Speaker A: So why. Why do you think this is one of the crazier ones? Like, what was the thing that got you excited? Because I know a lot of people, like you said in crypto, hates this, and we're going to get to that. But what got you excited about this one?
00:20:00.662 - 00:20:37.204, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one, like, it's tackling a very big problem. It's like, okay, civil resistance. And it's like a problem we've thought about in crypto and tried to solve in sideways ways. And, you know, you even see, like, the silliest example of it is I feel like a lot of airdrops recently try and incentivize other users to call out people who are civil resistancing this stuff. And I think if you just think from first principles, a lot of very cool things could be built in crypto and outside of crypto, if you just knew that, like, okay, this identity represents one person, it does not represent more than one person. Governance systems have a natural way of tending towards wealth. And that's also, like, why government voting isn't wealth basis.
00:20:37.204 - 00:21:01.778, Speaker B: Like, one person gets one vote. And so being able to enforce that at a digital level is super cool. And solving that problem in a previously preserving way is super exciting. And I think we really dislike the idea of having your eyeballs scanned. But the truth is that biometrics are unique. They're used in government systems all over the world. And so the reason I think it's so ambitious is it's a really hard problem, and the solution feels kind of gnarly.
00:21:01.778 - 00:21:26.962, Speaker B: It's like, okay, we're going to scan everyone's eyeball. The second you say that, everyone's like, crazy. So I just kind of feel like. And that's kind of why I like, I love people who, like, shoot for very big goals. It's like, okay, I'm going to give everyone in the world a piece of identity that can prove that they're a human. And that's like a far bigger goal than, like, building a new Dex on a new layer one or something. Right? And so I'm, like, always excited about ideas at these scales.
00:21:27.018 - 00:21:41.688, Speaker A: It's spoken like a true VC. I like that. I like that. And they did raise quite a lot of money. A lot of people were very excited about this. Right? They raised like $115 million for their series C from blockchain Capital. So I'm going to go through why I was very skeptical.
00:21:41.688 - 00:22:13.828, Speaker A: So when they first announced this thing, I think in 2021, I wrote a threat about the potential risks of this thing. Basically, it's a bunch of guys sitting in Silicon Valley maybe imposing their ideology and their own currency on emerging markets, which there's a lot of potential risk for exploitation. So I didn't dismiss them right away. I think I was quite fair in my assessment. I said, okay, this is a very important problem to solve. Like you said, the proof of personhood. And if they are able to handle privacy correctly, I think that should be okay.
00:22:13.828 - 00:23:11.200, Speaker A: But then I checked back. I think a year later, in April of 2022, there was this article from Technology Review, which I'm sure you know which one I'm talking about. Basically, it's about some of the expectations that I was kind of predicting would actually happening. So the article, for those of you watching this in video, I shared the link here. It's called deception exploited workers and cash handouts. So just to read some highlights from this thing, I think there was a case where they went to a village in an emerging market, I think it was in Indonesia, and they were accused of, like, bribing village officials to get villagers to scan their eyeballs and sign on to Worldcoin when they didn't really know what they were giving up and didn't really fully understand. What is with this cryptocurrency? And there's allegations that that type of practice broke anti corruption and anti bribery laws.
00:23:11.200 - 00:24:12.726, Speaker A: And obviously the team did respond. I think the team launched, like, an investigation and said that this is a one off thing. But then just the idea of kind of enticing people who are not crypto native, who might not understand what they're giving up with money is a little bit exploitative to me. And they did also have this example that they stated in this article where they were giving away, like, free AirPods to encourage 20,000 signups. So that was another example of, like, okay, this seems a little bit, like, I don't want to say exploitation, but it's definitely a little bit on the, on the shadier side. And I think that the reason why crypto natives seem to be so against this is just because of the, like you said, right? The idea of scanning eyeballs, of giving up something that is, uh, you know, uniquely identifiable and something that's so private, is pretty against kind of the cypherpunk ideology. And I remember when they first launched, even, uh, Edward Snowden was putting out a tweet thread about this project asking people to not catalog their eyeballs.
00:24:12.726 - 00:24:33.114, Speaker A: But it does seem like crypto has warmed up to them over the years, especially as Sam Altman, one of the founders, became a God through chat GBT. But I'm curious, like, when you looked at this, did you think that, hey, maybe the privacy aspect could be pretty gnarly? And what do you think of what happened?
00:24:34.294 - 00:25:23.082, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the article definitely points to some practices that were pretty sketchy. I think some of it can actually just be explained by this article is a little bit of a hijob. It's not necessarily super inaccurate, but they kind of, if you read through, like, world coin, actually took the trouble to write a 25 page response to a lot of these allegations. And I think, like, yes, startups that are very excited about growth sometimes just get a little too excited about growth, and I'll admit that. But at the end of the day, I think most of the way worldcoin thinks about privacy is actually pretty respectable. This is not something that they ignore, and they're not a company that does not care about privacy at a super simple level. The actual hardware device, it stores your iris, calculates a hash of your iris, which is not your iris data, like a number that represents your iris data, but can't kind of be tied back to your iris.
00:25:23.082 - 00:26:25.274, Speaker B: And that's the only thing that's sent to the network, and then they delete your original iris data once that's done. And so I kind of think that, like, you can hate the idea at its core, and then, like, there's not a whole lot of convincing you, but if you kind of go through the workpoint docs and the way they are thinking about this stuff and the way they kind of leverage ZK tech also to ensure that, like, no one can prove that no one can link your iris to your wallet and stuff like that, and so broadly, I think this is actually like a really best effort at trying to create a privacy preserving way of scanning people's eyeballs either. You can hate scanning people's eyeballs, but if you are willing to give them that, that's the only way to reduce the build resistance. I actually think they're pretty thoughtful. If you read through their blog posts, if you read through the team and the way they've kind of worked around this, I wasn't a huge fan of how they launched their token recently, but outside of that, I think they've thought pretty deeply about privacy. And a lot of this stuff remains to be tested. Like the hardware device is still very much closed source and so we don't really know what happens under the hood.
00:26:25.274 - 00:27:01.814, Speaker B: But honestly, a really nice article here to point is Vitalik's whole article on what he thinks about it. And even he said that, look, the Irish has cat. The iris hashing process is probably a pretty good effort at this stuff. I think theyre actually much more thoughtful about privacy than people give them credit for. They did definitely have some aggressive growth tactics to start with. But then this article is also for example, this article talks a lot about how worldcoin gives people ious for world token and keeps claiming theyre worthless. But the token wasnt live, so they said, hey, well give you an airdrop when the token goes live.
00:27:01.814 - 00:27:20.714, Speaker B: Is that so crazy? I dont think so. I dont know. They even gave people an option for some time to choose to receive their money in bitcoin right now, as opposed to like receiving world coin later. And some of this stuff will happen, right? Like if you basically tell people hey, like scan your eyeball and you get some money. Yeah, no, some gnarly stuff is going to happen.
00:27:21.174 - 00:27:50.258, Speaker A: I saw that part in the article and I thought that was pretty funny. That's why I didn't bring it up, because I thought that was a very weak argument. Right. So basically this hit piece, as you put it from Technology review, was saying that this people who are getting airdrop and launch token are basically given an iou from the company and it might not be worth anything. And they made it sound like it's such a bad thing that you're getting an iou from a company. But I thought that it was funny. I think there's certainly an element of a hit piece here.
00:27:50.258 - 00:29:09.206, Speaker A: And especially after going through all the journalist coverage of FTX, I do realize that no one is unbiased, but I think the most credible critique they brought up was actually the fact about 10% of the tokens are allocated to the employees, which it makes sense for a startup got to build for free, but then there's also 10% to investors, like a six z. So if we are trying to create a UBI standard for emerging markets or globally, does it make sense for 10% of this new world currency to be controlled by one firm and their lp's? So that was another thing that I think pushed people the wrong way. I think people were asked that. There were some people that were excited about the idea of scanning eyeballs, but if you distributed bitcoin, but obviously that would be a charity, because you need to raise the bitcoin first to distribute it. But I actually thought an interesting alternative to this is maybe someone can build this as a service and find some way to monetize it. Maybe they take a tax off transactions, but I'm not sure. I can't find an idea that aligns the incentive to build this thing, but also make sure that there's no centralization in the hands of a few for something thats meant to be a fair new kind of economic standard.
00:29:09.390 - 00:29:32.434, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that. I think its not ideal. But like you said, people need to be incentivized to build these things. And if we dont find private ways of funding these things, you just end up with like, the government could clearly build this with our taxes. Thats the kind of thing that happens already. But I do think that token launch could have been better thought out. In particular, they launched with a very small percentage of circulating supply.
00:29:32.434 - 00:29:44.742, Speaker B: I don't know. We've learned a lot about how token launches should be done, and it felt like world coin ignored a lot of that existing knowledge. And so that was definitely a little bit disappointing when you say a small.
00:29:44.798 - 00:29:48.754, Speaker A: Percentage of the circulating supply. So how much did they launch? Actually, let me look this up.
00:29:49.734 - 00:29:52.198, Speaker B: It's like under five or something like that.
00:29:52.366 - 00:30:34.546, Speaker A: So they have 10 billion total tokens, of which 130 million is circulating right now. So, yeah, it's a pretty small percentage. But I think I do. I do concede to the fact that I think this is like one of the very novel, kind of zero to one things. So we were actually approached by the team, I believe, in their, in their race prior to the last round, when we still both at Spartan. And I just remember being having a very strange takeaway, because on the call we didn't talk about the product, didn't talk about the go to market, didn't talk about the token. I think all we talked about was like, who is in the round, how great the fundraising is, how much money they've raised.
00:30:34.546 - 00:30:50.494, Speaker A: And I just left the call feeling very strange. Okay, why does that matter? Why didn't we talk about the product? But I think maybe the person we talked to just woke up on the wrong side of the bed or something. That was a strange conversation. That might feed into some of my biases.
00:30:50.874 - 00:30:56.946, Speaker B: Yeah. It might also reflect what other VC's were looking to hear. One point, I'll use it.
00:30:57.050 - 00:31:15.154, Speaker A: That's true. That's very true. Yeah. That's one thing that I think was very emblematic of the bull market in general, is that everybody's just trying to see who else is investing in this. And, okay, if paradigm's in, I'm in. But thinking about first principles, again, I think the work on idea is very, very cool. Again, it all lies in execution.
00:31:15.154 - 00:31:28.278, Speaker A: I hope they're able to protect privacy of their user data they collected. And it seems like from what you said, they're putting in reasonable effort in there. So I'll continue to keep an eye on this, but for the time being, I think we move on to ideas. Yeah.
00:31:28.286 - 00:31:30.270, Speaker B: You're gonna get your eyeballs scanned is a real question.
00:31:30.382 - 00:31:31.206, Speaker A: Am I? What?
00:31:31.350 - 00:31:33.070, Speaker B: Are you gonna get your eyeballs scanned?
00:31:33.222 - 00:31:35.518, Speaker A: Are they available in Asia yet?
00:31:35.686 - 00:31:40.270, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I think there's one in Singapore. They had one for a while. They were posting all these pictures near mbs.
00:31:40.342 - 00:31:47.794, Speaker A: So is it like, one guy just holding an orb, just standing in public, and you just walk up to him? Or is there like, an installation somewhere you just go in and scan?
00:31:48.334 - 00:32:19.184, Speaker B: I did it at a crypto event in Paris. But, yeah, I think there's also just permanent installations. It's also funny, like, mine took a while. We were in a room where apparently the wifi wasn't working, and so this guy was, like, using his cell phone Internet to tether. It took, like, four times because once my eye blinked, and then, like, two, three other times, like, I think the literal device didn't have enough, like, strong enough mobile networks. So it was like. I think it's not perfect yet, but maybe that was just like.
00:32:19.184 - 00:32:21.528, Speaker B: Because there wasn't good enough Internet in the room I was in.
00:32:21.576 - 00:32:30.768, Speaker A: So it's not like a secure hardware enclave where. So your data is not stored in the orb. It's just like, literally just a scanner. And then it saves to some, like, I don't know, some database.
00:32:30.856 - 00:32:47.792, Speaker B: Yeah. So I believe what happens is, and someone should check me on this, that basically, like, it scans your data and then it hashes it so it produces a number that, like, represents your data, and then that number is kind of sent to the central servers.
00:32:47.888 - 00:33:14.924, Speaker A: I see, I see. That is, yeah, I remember when I first saw the deck on this, I thought, this is like the craziest thing I've seen. So I definitely approve of this choice on the list of four or five craziest ideas. I think you approve of this next one as well. So this next one I want to talk about is Praxis. So I think most people who are listening to the show probably know Yuga Labs, they probably know Worldcoin, but they might not know Praxis because I don't think they have a token. They weren't really that high profile, especially out in Asia.
00:33:14.924 - 00:33:44.984, Speaker A: So to give a little bit of a context of praxis is founded by a few people. So one of them is Charlie Callinan, who is a former investment analyst at a hedge fund. The other is Dryden Brown, who also used to be an investment analyst at a hedge fund. And he claimed to be a surfer for three years as well. So very interesting background for the team. So what exactly is Praxis? So Praxis is building a city. So this is not a metaverse city, not like a virtual world like Yugalabs, but an actual physical city.
00:33:44.984 - 00:34:45.082, Speaker A: And they've decided to build this somewhere in the thousands of acres of mediterranean canvas, as you can see in this beautiful picture here, for those of you watching this on video. And the purpose of this city is they want to promise healthier lifestyles, more purposeful lives. So it's very kind of wework Kambaya, a little bit cultish type of vibes. And they claims to have partnered with award winning architects to build this actual city and do urban planning. And a huge part of this is there's almost like libertarian leanings where they want to create their own society, where they're going to have their own kind of currencies, and maybe it's cryptocurrencies. So they were actually founded back in 2019 to build these cities based on the shared value system. So again, it reminds me a lot of wework in the beginning, I think a lot of the rhetoric on how Wework was like, how do we create communities with shared values instead of just a co working space? So my understanding is they actually don't have employees.
00:34:45.082 - 00:35:30.054, Speaker A: They just have so called members that are volunteers to help. At least this is what they claim in some of the earlier docs. But on LinkedIn, there's 24 employees right now. So I was wondering, okay, how does this thing make money? Are they charging rent? Are they taxing people? And how is this legal? And so far, they've monetized by selling merch. So they are selling merch, such as a $70 praxis ball cap in black, and they're selling a hammer for $91 and hoodies. So I think this is probably just like, similar to the boring company by Elon Musk, where they're just selling merch on the side. So obviously, this is not the main business, but this is the only part of the business that's currently generating revenue, as I understand it.
00:35:30.054 - 00:35:57.314, Speaker A: But this caused a big stir in Silicon Valley. So Peter Thiel is an investor in this paradigm, invested in this. The Winklevie, the Winklevoss twins invested in this. And I thought this was one of the most interesting things. I've never seen a single so called crypto project. And maybe you can explain to me why this is a crypto project and why crypto people are excited about this later. But I've never seen something like this building a physical city.
00:35:57.314 - 00:36:12.404, Speaker A: And we can go into some of the wild anecdotes later as well that I've read about. But I know you are partial to this project. I know you've been following this for a while as well. But how is this related to crypto and what got you interested in this in the first place?
00:36:12.984 - 00:36:41.274, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, actually the relation to crypto is relatively tangential. As much as if you're trying to create a new economic zone, you have the freedom to create and use other currencies as well. I don't think that crypto plans are super specific yet, and it's just one component of how do we build the monetary system of a new city. The reason I like it is pretty straightforward. It's just such a crazy idea. I think we kind of forget. It's funny, we don't explore land anymore.
00:36:41.274 - 00:37:12.044, Speaker B: That's not a thing we do as in our generation. But if you read, go back to the frontier cities in America, this is what happened. People would just kind of move past the frontier, start building stuff. Someone would set up a way stop for people to stop in, and slowly and slowly cities get built. And if you kind of start to think from first principles, it's like, okay, how do cities get built? You just kind of need to create economic activity, things for people to do, and bring people together and kind of wait for the magic to happen. And I think it's so cool. It's hugely ambitious.
00:37:12.044 - 00:37:59.234, Speaker B: We basically live in cities that have been important for hundreds of years, and there have been very few attempts to kind of create new ones outside of government. And governments have kind of tried to do this stuff successfully, at least in places like China and India. And so why not try really hard to build a great place where people would want to live? I think it's cool and super ambitious. I don't know how it plays out. It's so ambitious. It's really hard to envision it kind of like, once you get into the nuts and bolts, how do you get a bunch of people to move there? How do you monetize? I do find this notion of taking digital communities and maybe at some point trying to create physical space for them very interesting. And I actually think real estate monetization is underrated.
00:37:59.234 - 00:38:20.728, Speaker B: If you, I remember attending a talk by Balaji recently where he basically said, the monetization of a network is actually super straightforward. You just buy a ton of real estate and you start creating a city there. And over time, you sell that real estate to people who want to move there. And if you create economic value in that city, it's really hugely valuable to be able to sell real estate in those places.
00:38:20.816 - 00:38:22.224, Speaker A: What is this idea of a network state?
00:38:22.264 - 00:39:24.844, Speaker B: Actually, I think it's pretty warm and unclear. Some networks, they're experts. I think the general idea is just we increasingly have, there's two, three levels of it. Increasingly, digital communities are more and more important to us, and so they all feel a little distanced from our governments and our physical realities. And so what if the next step of, if I spend all my time in hanging out with crypto people on discord, what if I literally just built a city and then all of us were hanging out in the city? And then I also think technology has enabled a lot of this stuff to happen in clean, fast ways that our government doesn't accept. And so I think the general idea is just like, okay, you have a digital network of people. Why can't we create physical representations and countries and cities where we kind of live, live out, like, what our digital communities want us to?
00:39:25.344 - 00:40:05.966, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear you on this. I do think it's a very, very ambitious idea. It's very high capex, for sure. If you're trying to actually buy land and then buy contracts to build buildings in that land, and they've started to issue these kind of residency visas as well, and supposedly offer you tax advantages, and I wasn't sure how that's done, and I'm guessing this is a tax advantage for the future, taxes that they will collect. As a self appointed government, I'm not sure. So when I look through these really ambitious projects, obviously part of me is very, very excited. As an angel investor, I'm always looking for founders that are thinking 1000 x.
00:40:05.966 - 00:40:46.222, Speaker A: How do I build something that did not exist before? Massive ideas. But the cynical part of me, who has been in crypto long enough to see many of these things come and go, always kind of smells a little bit, sniffs things out there a little bit strange. So there's another hit piece, as expected with any tech startup, there's always hit pieces. There's a hit piece put out by the Washington Post. Actually, not the Washington Post, sorry. I'll find out the source for this. But effectively, someone went to a meetup that was held by the praxis guys and kind of described it as almost like a liberal arts philosophy major meetup where you have a bunch of guys just sitting together talking about philosophy.
00:40:46.222 - 00:42:01.344, Speaker A: But if you ask too much questions about the specifics of the execution for Praxis, they're going to ban you and they make you sign an NDA as well. So I think that post, I'll try to link it when I can find it again, it deliberately tries to make them sound like ivory Tower, Silicon Valley elites who are trying to build their own kind of utopia resort town with no concern for the rest of the world and these philosopher kings. So I'm sure there's a huge element of that that is completely biased. But at the same time, I can't help but think that are these people out of touch? Especially when I think you and I both know that in Puerto Rico, for instance, there's a lot of crypto people that move there for tax advantages, and they don't like it when other people talk about it. But there was an attempt to actually, I wouldn't say colonize, but to revitalize Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. And a lot of this was led by, I think, Brock Pierce, and they were proposing things like a system to distribute universal, basic income, decentralized energy grid, lots of promises that were made post Hurricane Katrina in 2017, but all of those promises basically fell apart. And what we ended up having was a gated community in Puerto Rico, where the crypto rich just lives, separated from the rest of the community in their own little tax haven.
00:42:01.344 - 00:42:18.324, Speaker A: So I thought, okay, is this what Praxis will eventually become? Or is praxis? And if not, like, why don't Praxis start in Puerto Rico, actually, where there's already a bunch of crypto people who have wanted to do something like this and have the capital but clearly lack the execution skills.
00:42:19.864 - 00:42:55.570, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that would be super interesting. And as a rule of thumb, I agree that the notion of, like, a whole bunch of Silicon Valley and crypto elites living in a city by themselves is not, like. It's, like, not the world that I would want to live in. It also sounds incredibly boring, for lack of a better one. I would want to hang out with these people all the time. I think one underrated thing about such ambitious ideas is that they get people thinking that this is a thing that could happen. And so that's kind of why, okay, Balaji writes a book on network states, and it's not like, okay, today there's 50 countries built by people, but at least people start thinking in these directions.
00:42:55.570 - 00:43:30.494, Speaker B: And so I don't know if you've seen, there's a whole bunch of very wealthy people in Silicon Valley, including, I think, some of the A 16 Z and Sequoia partners, who are buying up, like, a ton of land in this place that's called Solano county, like, northeast of. It's a little far away from Silicon Valley. I think it's maybe an hour or half an hour away. And they're just buying up a ton, like, a crazy amount of land, and they're just trying to essentially recreate a new city that doesn't suffer from so much of the dysfunction that San Francisco does.
00:43:31.674 - 00:43:47.014, Speaker A: Wow, this is interesting. Yeah, I'm just pulling up the article here. For those of you watching on video. It's our article from New York Times about Silicon Valley elites who are building a city from scratch, and they spent $800 million to buy thousands of acres of San Francisco Bay Area land. Is this a recent phenomenon?
00:43:47.674 - 00:44:04.204, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure it's like. I mean, I don't know how long they've been buying land for, but I think the publicity only came around a few months ago. I don't know that they've built much, but mostly I think, like, if I'm not, like, it's not just about praxis. It's about, like, yeah, people should start trying to build cities, and we'll see what happens.
00:44:04.504 - 00:44:41.264, Speaker A: Yeah. I remember reading the biography on Peter Thiel, which has also been widely criticized as a hit piece book. I don't know if you read that one. It's called the Contrarian. It's basically a guy hating on Peter Thiel for, like, 200 pages. But he did cover an idea that Peter Thiel had, which was to build this a seasteading kind of, you know, some sort of a city or some sort of a large boat in international waters that's, like, outside of the US. What is with tech people's fascination and obsession with, like, creating their own society that's separate from society?
00:44:42.164 - 00:45:10.794, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. I wonder if some part of it is just, like, how dysfunctional San Francisco is. Like, I think you read a lot of stuff, and, like, I don't know. We live in Singapore, and Singapore is a pretty great place, but I kind of empathize with the frustration, having spent a couple of months in San Francisco when I was working at Uber, that it drives you up the wall that you can't just get a city to work. And if you're a person who has made companies work at large scale, you probably just think, okay, I can make this work as well.
00:45:11.214 - 00:45:49.388, Speaker A: I just think it's such an interesting logical leap. When you live in a place that's really shitty, very badly run, your first thought is, probably, okay, let's move to another city, or maybe move to another country if you have the economic means. And then the Silicon Valley guys are basically, no, let's build our own cities. And then I thought, the funniest thing is, Elon Musk basically takes it to its logical extreme, and he's like, nope, I'm not gonna build my own city. I'm gonna go to another planet. So there's always this desire to, like, move on to a better place, which I guess is very emblematic of, you know, the tech utopianism and the optimism, which I think is very, very much captured by Praxis. I have never seen another project that's like this.
00:45:49.388 - 00:46:22.880, Speaker A: So every time you bring up a project, when you forget the name, when you catch up with your vc friends, you're like, hey, you remember that amm project or that defi project? And they list out, like, 24 names, and it's none of them. But every time I talk about, hey, you remember that project where the guys are trying to build a city? Everybody knows immediately that it's praxis. I think that speaks to how unique and ambitious that these guys are, and I hope the best for them. I hope they don't muck it up. I hope this is not another Puerto Rico crypto experiment 2.0. I really hope this takes off. So we'll see, but let's move on to number four.
00:46:22.880 - 00:46:33.736, Speaker A: I know you wanted to talk about this one a little bit, which is a defi favorite back in the day. Pull this up here. Three. Three. What is three. Three, yeah.
00:46:33.760 - 00:47:39.158, Speaker B: So mostly I wanted to chat about Olympus style and Olympus. The initial thesis is pretty wild. I don't know if you have that other picture that I have sent you, but it's basically this idea that, what if we built a reserve currency? I think this always crypto people understand quite deeply that there's a lot of that fiat currency is a little bit of a confidence trick, and we all believe in it, and that's why it's valuable. And that's a simplistic view of it, but there is some level of that going on. And a whole bunch of people have been like, okay, why can't we build something? Why can't we build currencies ourselves, like real currencies? And I think this was built in a time when it was becoming increasingly clear that, like, one way or another, bitcoin and ethereum are probably not reserve currencies, or at least unfunctioning as such today. We also had, this came in the wake of a whole bunch of algorithmic stable coins that tried to do similar stuff with ESD and ZSD and a whole bunch of other games that we play. But Olympus really took off for a minute there.
00:47:39.158 - 00:48:22.882, Speaker B: Like, really, really, really took off. I think it had like a $4 billion market cap at some point. And it was just like, okay, look what we essentially can create a currency. It's backed by a stable coin called Dai. And they had this really weird kind of, I don't know what to call it, a rebalance. They called it a yield mechanic, but it was much more a rebalancing mechanic, where essentially, like, okay, if one like 1 ω is backed by $1, but if 1 ω trades at $10, essentially we can continue giving people a whole bunch more ohm. Like, if you have one Om today, you can have two om tomorrow, and your Om still represents, like, your home is still back.
00:48:22.882 - 00:49:02.694, Speaker B: Because, like, the only thing that Om needs to be his back to a $1 price at some level. It was just fascinating that someone came and said, hey, we're going to create a reserve currency. This is the currency that daos are going to hold. And I remember, I believe we saw a pitch from them once and they were just like, yeah, this is going to be the currency of the future. They were really excited about it. And that idea sounds completely crazy, but the amount of buy in they had at a certain moment, I remember this spread outside of crypto, there was like, they also had this three, three meme where like, if everybody agreed, do not sell their home and just kind of stake it. And more and more people continued kind of adding dye and staking om.
00:49:02.694 - 00:49:24.262, Speaker B: In theory, you could kind of continue growing the protocol. Basically, it was just like, if no one sells, this thing will go up, which is, like, mechanically true for, like, anything in the world, basically. But then they had this table, and this table, like, took over, like the. I remember Chris Sarka, who, like, I've never seen him do anything in crypto outside of this. Maybe he does, which is, like, wild to me. I remember I woke up one morning and he. I don't know if people know.
00:49:24.262 - 00:49:30.734, Speaker B: He's, like, a very prolific angel investor in Silicon Valley who invested in a whole bunch of stuff, including Twitter.
00:49:30.774 - 00:49:32.174, Speaker A: Shark Tank before as well, was on.
00:49:32.254 - 00:50:04.340, Speaker B: Shark Tank as well. And, like, he tweeted three, three. And I was like, what the fuck is going on? And I used to find it fascinating because there's just, like, this moment where you're like, okay, I guess, like, fiat currency is also like, yeah, okay, we all believe this stuff is valuable. So maybe, like, if Chris Saka believes Om is valuable, and the next day some government believes Om is valuable, slowly we can kind of meme our way to glory. That's obviously not what happened, but I thought it was just fascinating that one. I like the idea of replacing money. That's an interesting idea.
00:50:04.340 - 00:50:36.254, Speaker B: That's why I came to crypto. I remember someone who had invested very early into a crypto company said, the reason I invested is someone came and said, my startup competes with the US dollar and Om is similar. That was the ambition. It was not well executed, like, transparently. I don't think Om was like a interesting or particularly intelligently designed currency. But it was crazy also just to see that if you can get buy in from, if the meme can spread and you can get buy in, you can actually create a currency that's worth $4 billion. And random Silicon Valley people are tweeting, three, three.
00:50:36.254 - 00:50:38.622, Speaker B: I don't know. What did you think during all of this whole mania?
00:50:38.718 - 00:51:15.358, Speaker A: Yeah, so I actually tried to find that tweet by Chris Saka. I think he deleted it, man. I think he's ashamed of that part of his past. But it was very insane to see this rebasing token. Like you said, the only mechanism they have is basically, my understanding, if I remember correctly, is if it goes above a dollar, they will give you more units of OHm, but the value of it is the same. It's redenominated into more units, and they represent that as an interest rate. So a yield basically if they issue you ten more units, they put a number around what that means in terms of yield.
00:51:15.358 - 00:51:58.816, Speaker A: So they managed to, I guess, almost promised like a 10,000% yield at one point, which is obviously not a real yield, but people were very excited by that. And you have this entire kind of ponzi run up. For those looking at video, you can see the chart. Kind of started off as a 50 million market cap. They have a project pretty typical in DeFi at that time, in 2021, ran all the way to $4 billion within four months time, and then went all the way back down to currently trading at about 300 million. So I thought this was one of the crazier ideas as well. I remember when we spoke to the team early on, I thought, okay, these guys are very young, but very ambitious, and we've seen this before.
00:51:58.816 - 00:52:31.044, Speaker A: So when I first joined Spartan, I think the last one that we were both at the first project, one of the first ever projects that we invested was this thing called fragments. And it was the exact same idea started by Evan, the founder, whose previous startup was a pizza startup. So very, very interesting background. Nothing to do with. Nothing to do with crypto or cryptography. But then I remember meeting him in San Francisco and he was explaining to me this idea about, oh, you know, fiat currency is all just created by government, is based on trust. Why can't we build our own trust systems? And I thought, you know, this guy's crazy.
00:52:31.044 - 00:53:20.354, Speaker A: We ended up investing, and they have rebranded since then as Ampleforth. They were the first rebasing token. They also had a crazy run up, but I remember they are the first project to ever really experiment with this algorithmic rebasing thing, they did have a run up, I think, all the way up to 300 million in value, but then it died off. As someone who's experimented and played around with a lot of these things, like, what do you think went wrong with Olympus? Like, how was it just, like, inherently? Was it just speculation that drove the value up and, you know, the inevitable unwinding of speculation? Was there something structurally fundamentally broken with this the same way that there was with, like, Luna? What do you think? Is there a chance of this thing ever becoming serious?
00:53:21.094 - 00:53:43.716, Speaker B: I think not. Honestly. I think two things. One, the yield mechanic was really stupid. He described it very well, and it's just idiotic. And honestly, that felt just pretty dishonest to keep saying, you have 6000% yield here. And I think sophisticated investors get it, but unsophisticated investors don't.
00:53:43.716 - 00:54:25.474, Speaker B: And that was just idiotic. A rebasing token is not native yield. But second, I think it's mostly just like, suffers from far too simplistic an understanding of what makes money money at an interesting level. You see, they would do all these defi partnerships and be like, okay, this dow is holding our currency and everybody's like, don't worry, everybody's taking it, so it'll just keep going up. It's just not how gravity is a real thing. You can't have a. Actually, I was looking at the architecture versions of their websites and they said, this thing, believe that you can have a currency where the purchasing part keeps going up forever.
00:54:25.474 - 00:55:00.156, Speaker B: This is not how the world works. Honestly, I think crypto's best attempt at money is clearly ethereum. I still kind of stand by this. Outside of stable coins, which only satisfy part of the goal because they're pegged to the dollar. And if you think we buy our nfts in Ethereum, we have a whole bunch of people who denominate their wealth in Ethereum. We know enough investors who basically just try and maximize the number of ETH they have and ignore us dollars. And you can see how it's a slow, gradual process of all of those things, like store of value, unit of account, purchasing partners only have to go up.
00:55:00.156 - 00:55:25.044, Speaker B: But there's native yield to Ethereum now as well. Yeah, so I think this was just like, for lack of. It was just kind of stupid. It wasn't very well thought out past a certain point. Like, this chart is idiotically. What are the words there for this chart? It's just like. And it's interesting to see how much in the midst of a crazy mania, like really stupid ideas can start feeling real.
00:55:25.044 - 00:55:28.044, Speaker B: Like, you can meme their way. They can meme their way to reality.
00:55:28.164 - 00:56:04.320, Speaker A: Yeah, because there's no way to disprove these ideas when everyone is just in speculative media and just buying things up. And this is like the definition of a Ponzi, and this is like the definition of a Bernie Madoff scheme where the next guy is paid out by the next guy who buys. I think we passed on this thing for the very same reason we just outlined. Honestly, I don't think these sense I got from the founders. I don't think they're scammers or grifters. I think they genuinely believed that, hey, this thing is going to be the next kind of economic standard. I think it was more just naivety, which happens a lot.
00:56:04.320 - 00:56:53.564, Speaker A: But I thought it was really blew me away, was that this led to the birth of many other forks on every single other chain, there's, like, many, many of these different rebasing tokens. At one point, I think we had. At one point, we have, like, 20 or so of these tokens that are trading above a billion dollars, which was absolutely insane to me. But I think the nail in the coffin was probably Luna. So obviously, the design for Luna USD is very different from this one. And we covered this in a previous episode before where we interviewed Kevin from Galois Capital that shorted the shit out of Luna. But I think this idea of algorithmic stablecoins is going to take many, many years to come back, if at all, just because people's confidence is completely shattered about these Ponzi anomics Ponzi esque designs.
00:56:53.564 - 00:57:15.564, Speaker A: But I think this is a great pick for four or five crazy ideas, because a $4 billion Ponzi some people actually thought was, like, could last, was a pretty wild moment in history, I think for the last few minutes, I don't know if we have time to talk about the last one. Did you want to talk about. I know you had two choices for this. I'll just let you decide which one to talk about, and I'll pull it up.
00:57:16.544 - 00:58:02.536, Speaker B: The one I was thinking of was breeder doll, which I think was just more emblematic of this moment when the axie economy was so real to everyone. I think if Preeta Tao was, I can give a quick recap of how Axie works for those who don't. So the way Axie worked was that essentially you played Axie, and to play Axie, you needed three axies, like literal game characters. If you played Axie all day, you would earn some money. You would earn SLP, essentially, which is a currency that could be traded for money. But SLP was also needed to mint new axies. So it's almost like, basically, like, if you're in this club, you earn some money.
00:58:02.536 - 00:58:42.160, Speaker B: You have to use that money to kind of breed more axies if you want to join the club. And then we kind of. And so there was this huge moment, I don't know how familiar people are when, like, the axie con, you were taking off, and we had, like, SLP futures were trading on FTX. I remember, like, people were speculating. Yeah, I remember, okay, we need smooth love portion because people need more axies so that they can earn more money inside the axie economy. And this was also the moment when there were a ton of guilds where basically there were people who were willing to, quote, unquote, play this game, and there was not a whole lot of playing going on. You just have to hang out with the axie environment for 8 hours, but did not have the capital required to finance three axes.
00:58:42.160 - 00:59:03.284, Speaker B: And so we had a whole bunch of institutions that were literally created and venture funded. I feel like there were at least 1015 that were venture funded. They literally did this for a business. They bought up axies and they lent them to people so that they could play the game. And that took like 30% of their earnings. And so that was already like a crazy venture. Like, I thought that was already a crazy venture investment.
00:59:03.284 - 00:59:39.704, Speaker B: And then breeder Tao, I felt like was just the icing on the cake when they came and said, like, you know, these guilds, they, like, aren't able to optimize their axie breeding properly. Like, okay, we need to spend SLP, and we need, like, to make sure that we have the right amount of axes for our scholars so that, like, our 30% of the 30% cut that we're keeping is, like, optimized. And so Breeder Dao was like, I feel like there was this line where, like, we are like, the first specialist economic actors in the metaverse, which is like, we are going to be breeding axies. Like, this is all we do. We, like, know how much SLP it's going to take. We, like, can do it super efficiently. If you need like, ten axies tomorrow or five axies today, and you only have this much SLP, we can help you do that.
00:59:39.704 - 01:00:01.110, Speaker B: And I remember again, it was just like, so crazy how there was a moment when, like, p two e and the axie economy felt like it was like, like people. It's just crazy to me that people, like, believed in it so much that they were like, yeah, breederdao makes perfect sense. It makes perfect sense that there should be a company whose entire job is, like, figuring out what the most efficient way to, like, breed axies is.
01:00:01.222 - 01:00:23.014, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember. I remember this one now. And I think, so at one point, the guild business did seem like it was, you know, an evergreen business. And to their benefit, I think the promise wasn't just axie, right? The promise was always, there will be more games like Axie. And Axie is just a taste of things to come. And we're going to build these infrastructure companies that give you index exposure to all of these games. And vC's love that.
01:00:23.014 - 01:00:56.496, Speaker A: They love it when they don't have to pick a specific game and they can just index bet everything. I think a 16 Z really, really put in a lot of effort into Axie, because they invested in Sky Mavis, the parent company behind Axie, and then they invested in YGG, one of the biggest guilds at that time for Axie. And then they also invested in Breederdao, as you mentioned. Yeah. And I think the difficulty, the bigger point here is that in a bull market, when all the metrics are going up, revenue is going up, user numbers that are real are going up. Axie had like 2 million daily active users at the top. So it seemed like everything is real.
01:00:56.496 - 01:01:34.724, Speaker A: And I think a lot of founders and investors kind of use that to extrapolate an unreasonable rate of growth. So it could still be true that in 510 years, Axie is going to be a thing. Maybe breeding is still a business, but I think people were expecting this to just take off ten x within a year, which just did not happen after 2022. But I think the flip side is also true. People see the decline in users, decline in revenues, declines in activity, and they think, okay, this is over. So I do think sentiment flips both ways. So maybe breeding is still a business, but for now, do you know how they're doing right now, actually? Are they still in business? What are they doing working on now?
01:01:35.384 - 01:02:15.886, Speaker B: I'm not sure, actually. I know that a lot of guilds kind of have pivoted to trying to build essentially community projects, community products, or some kind of product with a network effect. Because at scale, the Gil business model, which was just buying up assets and lending them to users who can't afford to buy them, kind of stopped playing out. And like you said, I think a lot of these teams are very genuine and working super hard. And maybe there is something here, but it's just, it feels a little too. Yeah. Do we need someone who's like a specialized economic actor who breeds like gay like assets in p two e games made a lot of sense in 2021.
01:02:15.886 - 01:02:43.790, Speaker B: It just does not make a lot of sense to me now. One question I'm curious about is we studied the axie conv pretty closely, and one thing that I feel like I remember is that it felt like they control SLP. They get to control how much of it gets minted. They control how much of it you need to burn to have an axie. And I think, too late, they did make a lot of changes to how much SLP was getting minted. But one of the things that I think axie did wrong was like, there was a huge imbalance in the axie. Convenient.
01:02:43.790 - 01:03:18.274, Speaker B: The sentence sounds insane, I know, but it was just like, basically there was way too much SLP being minted and way too little SLP being burned. And for a currency in their control, I felt like they could have maybe done some parameter optimization. So I'm curious whether you think this p two e stuff is just too speculative and it's too much of a ponzi and that's what brought it down. Or there's a middle ground where we kind of create in game economies, they do have currencies that are fake, but we have some way of kind of creating value for them and we're just like far more careful about controlling the economy. Like, do you think there's a world in which Axie could have worked?
01:03:18.434 - 01:03:46.966, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that's a great question. And the cliche VC answer for people who have not really spent much time digging into the numbers as we have before is that, well, it's not about the economy, it's about the game. The game needs to be fun. Like, no shit, the game needs to be fun. But I remember talking to Jiho, one of the founders of Axie, and he was actually saying, the economy needs to come first. They need to design the economic loops correctly first before it can take off. Because otherwise, because the entire thing is dependent on this economy.
01:03:46.966 - 01:04:24.914, Speaker A: So is the world that actually could take off? I think so. Was it too speculative? I think so, but I don't think it was because of the tokenomics. I think if there is a market environment where everybody is buying up the base asset and pushing up the price, you're going to get higher yield on the in game activities that generate that asset for you. So I think the speculative element will always happen. Things will always get out of hand, as is with human sentiment on both ways. But I do think there is a world where Axie can take off. Especially, I think the genius move that Sky Mavis did was raise a ton of capital and launch their own l two as well in order to attract more capital.
01:04:24.914 - 01:05:13.040, Speaker A: And now they're sitting on a war chest. So obviously there was a massive hack with Ronin, their l two, but even after that, I think they still have quite significant Runway left. And if they didn't have that, they would have been sitting on enough money to iterate and create enough games until they hit product market fit for the next 510 years. I hope something takes off here, but I think this is a great choice for p two e. So, just to recap, today we talked about yugalabs, which we think is emblematic of the NFT metaverse maniac world coin, which is very unique idea in proof of personhood. Talk about praxis, which exhibits this idea of network state that more people have been talking about. And obviously Olympusdao, which is a staple in the DeFi summer of 2020, and then Breederdao, which is p two e.
01:05:13.040 - 01:05:21.164, Speaker A: If you were to rank these ideas sanand about, you know, in terms of how crazy they are in whatever way you want to define that word, how would you rank these five?
01:05:22.564 - 01:05:53.184, Speaker B: Interesting. I think praxis has to be the most ambitious, but like, building a city is definitely the wildest, most ambitious idea I was ever pitched. I think I would probably actually put breeder down second because it's really just so insane. Like someone thought like a whole bunch of the people, like so many people believe. Yeah, this makes perfect sense. This is like a totally a vibe. There's totally a viable business here in like optimizing the breeding of axie for guilds.
01:05:53.184 - 01:06:10.628, Speaker B: Trying to think. I think after that, probably worldcoin. And then, and then Olympus. And then, wait, did I cover all this?
01:06:10.676 - 01:06:13.036, Speaker A: And then Ugalapse, I guess you can.
01:06:13.100 - 01:06:22.336, Speaker B: Yes, yes. I think Ugalabs was super fascinating in a moment, but I actually think it's not like the craziest idea. But I also just believe in digital goods, maybe it doesn't seem so wild to me.
01:06:22.480 - 01:06:49.088, Speaker A: Yeah, I roughly agree. I think Praxis is number one for me. I think Olympus is definitely number two that people thought that enough people thought that this could be an actual currency. It was really crazy to me. And then worldcoin breeder, yuga lapse. But I'm curious what you guys out there, the people who are listening to this or watching this, think, like, how would you rank these five projects? Or maybe you have your own list of the craziest projects you've seen in the past few years? Or maybe not. None of these projects are on your list, in which case we need to do a better job of picking them.
01:06:49.088 - 01:07:09.408, Speaker A: But this will wrap up our first episode of our Fireside Roundtable. We haven't really decided what to call this format yet, so if you guys have ideas out there, please tag me on Twitter, let us know. Tag Sanad on Twitter, let him know as well. I include both our profiles in the show notes. And if you enjoy this format, also let us know. Give us a thumbs up on Twitter. Sorry.
01:07:09.408 - 01:07:38.964, Speaker A: On YouTube, rate us five stars on Spotify. Let us know that this format is something that's interesting to you guys. And in the next episode, let us know what projects you want us to talk about as well. So I think for future episodes we'll probably home in on one or two projects that are very fascinating to people or people are curious about our thoughts on instead of going through a list of them. But for this first one, we just wanted to do something a little bit more timeless, a little bit more of a look back. So hopefully you enjoyed this. Well, Sanat, thank you so much for doing this first one with me.
01:07:38.964 - 01:07:39.876, Speaker A: Hopefully many more.
01:07:39.900 - 01:07:40.824, Speaker B: Thank you guys.
