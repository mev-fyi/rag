00:00:00.240 - 00:00:22.005, Speaker A: We shorted Ripple in 2018. Going into their conferences, we were pretty convinced that they had absolutely nothing. They were not going to announce anything of substance. It was just going to be all vaporware. And man, we were right about the substance and we were wrong about the price. And that was our first wake up moment for markets can be irrational longer than you can be solvent.
00:00:25.425 - 00:00:47.981, Speaker B: Hey everybody. Welcome to On a Tangent, a special segment of the blockcrunch podcast. I'm your host, Jason Choi. I'm the co founder of Tangent.

00:00:47.981 - 00:01:32.543, Speaker B: We do founder driven venture bets and thesis driven liquid bets. I'm here with my co founder Daryl to welcome a legend of the space. Now, if you don't know who Kyle Somani is, you're probably dialing into the wrong podcast. So Kyle is the managing partner of Multicoin Capital, one of the earliest and biggest funds in crypto. So I'm really, really excited to have Kyle today because not only are they known for the bets in Solana, they're also known for the contrarian thesis that they share online all the time since as early as 2018-19, which I've been following religiously. So, very, very excited to have Kyle on the show. And before we get started, just as a disclaimer, Kyle Somani is a partner at a registered investment advisor, but nothing in this podcast is an offering of multicoin capital services or investment advisory and should not be construed as financial advice.
00:01:32.543 - 00:01:34.215, Speaker B: So, Kai, welcome to the show, man.
00:01:34.335 - 00:01:38.727, Speaker A: Jason, Darrell, thanks for having me on the show. Pleasure to be here. Longtime listener, first time caller.
00:01:38.831 - 00:01:50.447, Speaker B: Thank you very much. So we're really excited to have you because I don't know if you remember this, but when we first started Tangent two years ago, it was like an angel type of collective. Do you want to explain what the structure is and then I'll talk about why I want to bring that up?
00:01:50.511 - 00:02:24.873, Speaker C: Yeah. So during our origin story we were really focused on trying to create something like a mix of an incubator and accelerator trying to bring on, you know, existing crypto founders at the time as mentors to really provide unique advisory services to founders or to first time founders. And you know, we call, I believe we called you independently really to ask you for your advice and you told us that, you know, it probably didn't really work from first principles and obviously we didn't listen.
00:02:24.929 - 00:02:26.863, Speaker B: Yeah, we're like, no, screw that. We're going to sift through it.
00:02:27.009 - 00:02:32.347, Speaker C: But, you know, over time, we realized the wisdom of your words and so slowly, eventually pivoted away from it.
00:02:32.371 - 00:02:42.935, Speaker B: We saw the light and became a proper prop fund. Because you basically just. You gave me a very long, detailed feedback. You're the only person that actually gave me a detailed feedback. And you were like, this is actually a really silly idea. And we're like, no, screw that. We're going to do this.
00:02:43.595 - 00:02:56.563, Speaker A: Well, I'm glad you all did it. I'm glad you all did not listen. And like, there's something to learning lessons from doing things the wrong way. I like to joke that it doesn't matter how many times you tell me the stove is hot. I'm still going to put my hand on.
00:02:56.619 - 00:02:58.315, Speaker B: Still going to touch it. We're still going to touch it.
00:02:58.355 - 00:03:00.979, Speaker A: Still going to touch the stove. Best way to learn.
00:03:01.067 - 00:03:04.495, Speaker B: Now we're recording this a day the Breakpoint end yesterday.
00:03:04.795 - 00:03:05.251, Speaker C: Saturday.
00:03:05.323 - 00:03:05.699, Speaker A: Saturday.
00:03:05.787 - 00:03:21.999, Speaker B: So we just ended two days ago. A lot of things were announced. I think the biggest thing was probably Frankendancer, which is the testnet version of Fire Dancer. I think they were running on 100 notes and they got like a million transactions per second. So besides that, were there anything that was exciting to you at Breakpoint?
00:03:22.147 - 00:03:45.275, Speaker A: I mean, there was a ton of stuff that was exciting. Fire Dancer was awesome to see and a couple of tweaks to what you said. So Franken Dancer is live on mainnet today. Frankenancer is half new Fire Dancer code base, half old Agave code base. So they call it like Frankenstein. So it's like that's where the name comes from. So Franken Dancer is live on Mainnet today.
00:03:45.275 - 00:04:07.905, Speaker A: It's at like 1.1% of the stake. 2% of the stake. So it's very small percentage of the stake. My guess is it's going to take probably six to 12 months for that to ramp up to become a meaningful portion of the stake, like a third of the stake or more. But really awesome to see. They told us two years ago it's going to take them two years to ship it.
00:04:07.905 - 00:04:46.483, Speaker A: They shipped it. They're obviously more bugs to work through, but pretty awesome to see that. Beyond Fire Dancer, a couple of other things I'd probably flag. One is a new project that I think is going by the name Double Zero. Maybe the name will change but the Jump in the Fire Dancer teams kind of realized, okay, we can make the software that runs on the computer as fast as we can. And if we're going to build decentralized nasdaq, the other kind of obvious component is the Internet itself because like, you got to get the data between all the computers. And no one in crypto has really like tried to like upgrade the Internet.
00:04:46.483 - 00:05:53.275, Speaker A: And that's what Double Zero is. There's on the order of a few hundred companies in the world today that have built global private Internet lines. So Google, Amazon, Facebook, like all the major tech companies have done this, obviously all the major HFT firms on Wall street, so Jump Citadel, Jane Street, Hudson river, all these guys, and they literally have undersea fiber cables running from New York to London and running to South Africa and Australia and all over the place. It's call it like on the order of $1 billion to like build a global private network like this and obviously takes quite, quite a number of years just to like coordinate all the logistics and everything. So jump very famously has one of these, as do a lot of other firms. And the Fire Dancer folks have been testing a lot of the Fire Dancer just code over the jump network, the private network, over the last 12 months. At some point they kind of realized they're like, hey, we just been testing on this just to see what we can make Fire Dancer do, but what if we could open this up to Solana Public blockchain at large.
00:05:53.275 - 00:06:21.015, Speaker A: And so that's what this new Double Zero initiative is. There are a lot of these different private networks out there. They're all, you know, owned privately by various big, big companies, mostly tech and finance. And Double Zero is basically an orchestration layer that lives on top of these private networks to route traffic over them. Obviously, like one of those networks may go down. Turns out, like these cables under seas, like they break all the time. I don't know, sharks eat the cables.
00:06:21.015 - 00:07:02.631, Speaker A: I don't know what the hell happens. I don't know how you repair an undersea cable. But like, the point is you don't want a single like jumps network only to run the global Solana network. You want to be able to have 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 of these things out there. And for any given route, you want to route over the fastest one at that moment in time. And so this Double Zero project is basically an orchestration layer that runs over any private network. And so like this is, this isn't an oxymoron to say, but Double Zero is a global, permissionless private Fiber network and putting permissionless in private back to back is a very strange set of words to put together, but that's what they're aiming to do.
00:07:02.631 - 00:07:27.691, Speaker A: Obviously Jump is going to be the first one to offer their network onto this. We don't know if anyone else is going to opt into it. Obviously not that many companies in the world have this scale of infrastructure and are going to be willing to play ball. But look, if we can get three, four or five of them to play ball over the next few years, that now provides redundancy, provides more access, and obviously for those guys, it's a way for them to make free revenue for an asset that otherwise is just sitting under the water doing nothing, you know?
00:07:27.763 - 00:07:32.563, Speaker B: Yeah, just. Just in time for World War three. Right. If nuclear war breaks out, Solana is still going to be running.
00:07:32.619 - 00:07:58.481, Speaker A: Still going to be running. We got all the undersea cables, power in the network. So Devil's we always in the presentation for Double Zero and I was listening to them and I was just like, holy shit. Like the scale of the technical ambition, you know, it's like everyone in crypto has been like, oh, we're writing software, like, cool. And like, these guys are like, no, no, no, no, no. Like, we're gonna try and make the Internet go faster to like power these blockchains.
00:07:58.593 - 00:08:29.703, Speaker B: Before I get started, I'm grateful for aptos for sponsoring the show and letting us continue to make this free content for all. So here's Jerome from aptos to tell us a little bit more. Now, Jerome. With the growth of the Aptos ecosystem, including significant increase in daily active addresses and tvl, it's pretty evident that the community is doing well. And I hear that builders from around the world are converging in Seoul next month for the APTOS Experience. So can you tell us about what exactly is this APTOS Experience? The Aptos Experience is an unconference. Attendees won't merely hear about the future of Web3.
00:08:29.703 - 00:09:13.222, Speaker B: They'll become an integral part of it, experiencing Web3 innovations firsthand. The event is for innovators in all of us. They'll explore projects from the APTOS ecosystem and engage in dynamic discussions on the future of major verticals such as Defi gaming, entertainment. It's going to be fully experiential, immersive experiences. You'll get insights from renowned industry voices such as Arthur Hayes and Malthem Demiros, plus innovating companies such as Hashed, OkXventures, NBCUniversal, Paxos, LayerZero, BITB, supervillain labs Deutsche Motors, Xangle, Avara, SK Telecom, and the list goes on. Finally, the Aptos experience doesn't end with the last step of the day. Participants will also enjoy post event happy hours and excursions that highlight why Seoul is the hub of innovation.
00:09:13.222 - 00:09:35.639, Speaker B: Thanks, Jerome. Now back to the episode. I'm sure that wasn't as apparent when you first invested in Solana, because I actually want to go back to day one because before you guys invested in Solana, I think the bet that you were known for was EOS and the thesis at that time, I think this is 2019. 18. 2018. So the thesis was kind of similar in that, okay, this is a performant blockchain. At the time it was quite Centralized, I think 21 validators.
00:09:35.639 - 00:09:53.595, Speaker B: And when the proof of history white paper for Solana came out, it almost seemed like a similar thesis in that, okay, these guys are doing some sort of trade off that might make them a little bit more centralized than like the incumbents, but a lot faster. So at that time, like, did you see that as like a better Eos or how did you know it was not going to be the next CEOs?
00:09:54.935 - 00:10:48.711, Speaker A: I mean, we didn't know it wasn't going to be the next eos. We knew what we generally liked was the focus on like performance. And if you looked at all of the other folks from 2018 and if you still look at Ethereum today in 2024, the notion of like, we're going to focus on low level engineering optimizations, we're going to take, you know, we have 50 years of computer science of how to make, you know, operating systems go faster, memory access go faster. Like there's all of these mechanisms that have been developed and let's just apply all of those to a permissionless code base. And that ethos always struck us as like the kind of right thing to do. And Eos certainly, I'd say spoke to that, that ethos, although I think that the practical incarnation of it was not quite that. So that's why we attracted EOS early and this Lana early.
00:10:48.711 - 00:11:42.935, Speaker A: The other thing though that I will say really separated Solana was, you know, Anatoly's first pitch was not I'm here to scale blockchains. His pitch was I'm here to build decentralized nasdaq. And I flagged that because it's very easy to just be like, world computer blockchains are going to solve the world. Decentralization is a solution to like all the world's problems. And like, whether you don't have a defined North Star, it's just easy to talk about scalability in like a kind of a abstract sense. But like as we can see now in this 2024 roll up centric world, like Arbitrum is not fungible with Optimism, is not fungible with starkware, it's not fungible with scroll, is not going to be fungible with Mega Eth, whatever. And those are very different systems than Solana, where with SOLANA There are 3,000 validators today approximately who are synchronizing around the world in real time at the speed of light.
00:11:42.935 - 00:12:11.959, Speaker A: And yeah, you can quabble over TPS metrics and stuff, but there's another element of this which is you want to have the world's most real time global financial market running at the speed of light, where everyone is synchronizing using the same open protocol at the speed of light. And that vision always struck us as like, okay, there's a North Star here. And that was always very, very important to us from day one. And that really stood out in a major way.
00:12:12.127 - 00:12:42.075, Speaker C: Yeah, and it's funny you bring up the North Star point because I recall in the latest token2049 presentation you had a grain, you know, a very con controversial opinion, which is basically that Solana will flip Ethereum. And one of the key points you made was because Ethereum doesn't have North Star. Would you mind expanding on why you think the lack of a North Star is so important? And you know, is that the main reason why you think Solana is going to flip Ethereum?
00:12:43.295 - 00:13:28.903, Speaker A: So to answer your second question first, I think the like, if you keep going deeper and deeper and deeper as to like the first order thing, I think it is the lack of a North Star for Ethereum is its biggest problem. And then there's all these other like ethos values and all these other like decision making criteria and stuff. But like I think the core of it is a lack of a North Star 2015. You know, Ethereum is like world computer and obviously they've stopped using that messaging today as they should have because the world, the term world computer was never defined, still is never defined, doesn't need to be defined. You're allowed to pivot and move on. That's fine. I'm not like holding you to something you said nine years ago, but like, hey man, Ethereum has been on Mainnet in production for nine years, almost nine and a half years.
00:13:28.903 - 00:14:05.955, Speaker A: Like what are you optimizing for? And very definitively they do not have an answer. There's a lot of things they could use as answers. They could say defi, they could say NFTs, they could say Web3, they could say decentralized identity, whatever. There's a whole lot of things you could pick and choose and say. And I'm not even telling you that you should pick a specific one, that that's your call. I'm just saying pick one and then obviously then communicate about given every decision you make technically has some set of trade offs. So then you should be able to congruently explain why the trade offs you're making are aligned with the North Star that you know you're going for.
00:14:05.955 - 00:14:34.825, Speaker A: And that's what I love about Solana is that clarity is there. You know, we want to have 3,000 nodes at least 3,000, hopefully it's maybe 10,000 one day nodes synchronizing this information at the speed of light. And you might say well that's not decentralized enough. You can't run on your laptop. And it's like okay, well there's no world in which your laptop is going to be able to process like tens of thousands of TPS of real time financial transactions. And so like that's not what we're optimizing. We're not optimizing for you to validate the chain at home.
00:14:34.825 - 00:15:18.405, Speaker A: We're optimizing for the world's best financial market. And like that's going to have higher hardware requirements than your laptop on a WI fi connection. And and so you know, it's just that I think that clarity is super important. The core of the Ethereum foundation is fundamentally a research led organization and you obviously want to have leading edge researchers. That's important stuff. But I think that research has led them to not define A and they might say well that's L2's job and that's an answer. And it's plausible that that is like 10 years from now the correct answer or I should say the one that wins.
00:15:18.405 - 00:15:24.753, Speaker A: But certainly today it doesn't feel like it's providing a North Star for the ecosystem as a whole.
00:15:24.929 - 00:15:32.619, Speaker B: That's interesting because I always thought the North Star for Ethereum was to create this universe of roll ups. And I think two years ago we saw like four or five projects.
00:15:32.667 - 00:15:46.443, Speaker A: But universal rollups is not a, is not a that, that's a description of like a system that's not a objective use case. You centralize nasdaq. Like we are saying, you know, synchronize information to people so that you can have the world's best financial Market.
00:15:46.539 - 00:15:47.099, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:47.227 - 00:15:55.987, Speaker A: World War 3 resistance is not a North Star. That is a property of a system. A foundation for roll ups is not a North Star. That, that is an abstract notion of.
00:15:56.011 - 00:15:58.083, Speaker C: Like property solution, looking for problems.
00:15:58.139 - 00:15:59.973, Speaker B: So there's no, not, not a goal basically.
00:16:00.099 - 00:16:02.497, Speaker A: Correct. What is the end user objective?
00:16:02.641 - 00:16:20.833, Speaker B: That's an interesting way to put it. Yeah, I never considered that. Yeah, Solana seems to have a more kind of defined, hey, this is what we're doing, this is what we're trying to build. Whereas Ethereum, I guess for some reason they kind of moved to the ultrasound money thing. But that, I don't think that attracts developers as much as like, hey, let's build the future of like nasdaq.
00:16:20.969 - 00:16:55.299, Speaker A: I mean the ultrasound money thing could be a North Star. The problem is it's like, it's like a step removed. Like if you have enough usage and there's enough burning and stuff, then like you can have the inflation be net negative. So like you can get there. But like if you're an application developer and you're like I'm building for ultrasound, like what is that? Why is my, you know, borrow, lend app or whatever, or my NFT thing, what does that have to do with ultrasound money? But like if you're building a perps exchange on Solana, it's like very clear what that has to do with decentralized nasdaq. Like there's a lot more congruence here.
00:16:55.447 - 00:17:20.179, Speaker B: So I want to kind of double click on the kind of Ethereum versus Solana because one of the biggest debates in infra obviously has been modular versus monolithic. But I know you hate the word monolithic. Yeah, you like integrated. So just to steal man, the arguments, do you see a future where the monolithic, sorry, the modular guys are correct and if so like what would have happened? Like, why would that be correct? Has there been any precedent that the system would look like that?
00:17:20.267 - 00:17:43.703, Speaker A: I mean, look, both models are likely to coexist for the foreseeable future just because of the inertia in both models. And like look, iOS, Android, like one's more open, one's more integrated. Like then there's some 80, 20 split. Ironically they're like inverted on what they're split. Android is 80% market share, but probably 20% of profit capture. IOS is 20% of market share, but probably 80%. Actually I think it might be 90% profit capture.
00:17:43.703 - 00:18:43.521, Speaker A: Anywho. So if you look at every layer of the technology stack, you'll see this with operating systems like Windows versus Linux and Mac, you'll see this in like processor designs if you go back to like Risk and Cisco, now that we have like Risk anyways, like you see this debate happen in technology time and time again over the last 50 years at different layers of the stack. And the general answer is both, both models can exist. I'd say the last 50 years has trended more towards open, not, not modular, but like open, especially like in the modern era of open source with Android kind of being like at this point kind of in Linux being the premier open source projects in the world. So both will coexist. I think there's a question of like, which delivers a better product experience. And the modular people will tell you, well yeah, if you have a centralized L2 on top of, you know, a decentralized L1, a centralized L2 can always be faster than a decentralized L1.
00:18:43.521 - 00:19:31.213, Speaker A: And like that statement is without question true because like doing consensus synchronization has some overhead in terms of CPU cycles and that is overhead in terms of latency. And so that is correct. But also like, I don't think that system is functionally equivalent to Solana saying we're going to have the world's most open permissionless exchange that runs on one server. Like just doesn't. To me that is not a decentralized financial system. You can say you have these guarantees of the verification underneath and like that mitigates it to some extent. But like there's a fundamental difference when the protocol itself is enforcing real time data propagation of all of the financial market data to all of the people all over the world.
00:19:31.213 - 00:20:10.253, Speaker A: And of course anyone in the world can spin up a node and run it and can synchronize in real time with everyone else. So to me it's like they're just different things. You can see this happening now with Hyperliquid, which is effectively a centralized system. You can see a bunch of teams or you know, the Atlas guys are doing it on Solana are doing a centralized svm. You can see this with Zeta, they're doing a centralized perp decks. I think Mega Eth effectively is going in this direction as well. So I think right now we're kind of seeing this barbell basically where you've got like Solana over here and then you've got these basically modular guys who are saying we can centralize the sequencer and we can deliver better performance.
00:20:10.253 - 00:20:42.177, Speaker A: And I expect at some point the centralized people will be able to deliver better performance. Now it's not clear how much that will matter. There will be Certain customers who do care, I don't think many people will care about, you know, a few hundred milliseconds versus two milliseconds again? Yeah, I think 99% of people are not going to perceive that. So I think both models coexist but I'm generally of the view that like the system I want to see built is decentralized. Nasdaq, not one server hosts the whole thing.
00:20:42.321 - 00:21:18.073, Speaker C: And just bringing it into, I guess real time market context. Given that, you know, you are a PM at a liquid fund. When we think probabilistically about statements like Solana will flip Ethereum, obviously, you know, at the depths of the bear Market in 2022 was in your mind was that probability lower? You know, at the times when FTX was going down, you know, a lot of the ecosystem support was leaving or was, you know, you know, missing. Did that probability change from that time till now?
00:21:18.209 - 00:21:46.939, Speaker A: Yes, without question because history is path dependent and because very specifically these are inherently social systems. And like, yeah, let's assume like Jump was never going to change course with Fire Dancer. I don't know if they ever sat down and questioned it or not. But like clearly a lot of people in the ecosystem got cold feet and left and like if 100% of the people got cold feet and left, then like the system would have failed. So absolutely like there was a real moment of panic.
00:21:47.067 - 00:21:58.465, Speaker C: And you know, today after seeing break 2 024, you know, are you. Is the all sudden thing, you know, above 90% that you think this is, this will happen, it's just a matter of time?
00:21:59.365 - 00:22:45.097, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it is. At this point Solana's to lose, right? With one exception which is if the Ethereum foundation transitions from Peace mode to war mode, that references to Ben Horowitz who wrote a book probably about 10 years ago called the Hard Thing about hard things. And my favorite chapter from that, Paul Graham just did his Founder Mode blog, which I thought was actually very silly Tom and didn't make any sense to me. But the it reminded me of Horowitz's Peace versus War Mode, which absolutely is resonates with me and the Ethereum Foundation. I'd say they were probably in War Mode through shipping v1, like the 2015 launch product because like they were running out of money. No one believed them. And people said this thing can't work, it's breaking the laws of physics.
00:22:45.097 - 00:22:57.969, Speaker A: Like it was like a real struggle to get this thing out. And at some point, I don't know, probably like maybe after the Dow Hard Fork, maybe like another six months after that. I feel like they kind of transitioned into Peace Mode after the D. I.
00:22:57.977 - 00:23:01.473, Speaker B: Thought after Denun, maybe after the D. Very early.
00:23:01.529 - 00:23:06.125, Speaker A: I think the Ethereum foundation has been operating in Peace Mode for a very long time.
00:23:06.985 - 00:23:08.329, Speaker B: What makes you say that?
00:23:08.497 - 00:23:34.371, Speaker A: I mean there's been no urgency to like, dude, I Mean Ethereum launched July 2015. That, that statement of fact. They've, they've known since launch they need to have a scaling plan. They knew the V1 system obviously was not going to scale. They committed to the roll up centric roadmap in October of 2020. So it took them five years to commit to a plan. Now they're questioning that plan.
00:23:34.371 - 00:23:58.585, Speaker A: Maybe the planet, some problems like, whatever. But like if it takes you five years to commit to a plan, that is the empirical proof that this is not a war mode organization. This is a peace mode organization. And so, you know, there's this place operates in Peace Mode. And unless they define a North Star and transition to War Mode, I don't see their path to victory.
00:23:59.125 - 00:24:34.145, Speaker B: Before we transition to other L1s, I do want to kind of double click on the integrated approach because it seems like, I don't know if it's kind of controversial because of the way that it's phrased, but there's this discussion around network extensions recently on Twitter, which is basically kind of execution on another layer and settlement to Solana, which a lot of the Ethereum guys, it looks a hell of a lot like L2S, which is kind of strange because Solana's approach was like, we're not going to do any L2s. Everything is like one architecture. What are your general thoughts about that? Like why is it okay to do that on Solana, but it's parasitic when you do it on like Ethereum?
00:24:34.925 - 00:25:14.225, Speaker A: So conflate a few, few different ideas here. So one, anything that, like if you were going to do sequencing and execution on L1 and then you choose to do it on L2 or whatever other place instead, that is explicitly parasitic, no matter what the vocabulary term is, you put on top of it. I've never suggested otherwise. Comment 2. Solana is designed at the L1 protocol level to not need L2s to generally fulfill the vision of decentralized NASDAQ. But obviously it's permissionless and so you can build on top of it whatever you want. And so like it's just natural.
00:25:14.225 - 00:25:40.354, Speaker A: People are going to try L2 looking thingies on top of Solana. They can and they should. I'm generally not in favor of them. But like my opinion doesn't matter, neither does Anatolis. Like go do what you want, it's fun. Then like the market for ideas will win and like we'll see where things net out. But like the fact that people random developers are building those things doesn't mean that like the strategy of the L1 has changed.
00:25:40.354 - 00:26:03.783, Speaker A: Those two things can happen in parallel. Comment 3 the term network extension I think it's important to use a distinct term for the solana ecosystem than L2, which is kind of the term the Ethereum people coined for a few reasons. One, you know, I was talking with Austin Federa about this issue a few months ago.
00:26:03.959 - 00:26:05.863, Speaker B: This is the head of strategy for.
00:26:05.919 - 00:26:55.335, Speaker A: Solana Comms and I think maybe strategy for the Solana Foundation. He's the one who first tweeted about the term a few weeks back. But he and I have been talking about this privately for a while and what I observed was the things that users today call L2s so arbitrary optimism, star ware, scroll, zksync, etc. Are functionally equivalent to Ethereum L1. In fact, all of those, with the exception of starkware literally run the EVM. And so the applications that you see are copy paste applications, copy paste assets, and the functions are the same. And yes, obviously L2s are not required to be that, but like in practice today, that is what they are.
00:26:55.335 - 00:27:39.687, Speaker A: And L2s that do other weird, funny things have somewhere between zero and barely above zero usage. And what I observed in Solana was there's a bunch of teams doing things that are not just like, yeah, there's Eclipse who's like the SVM L2 or Atlas. But then there's also teams like Grass, which they call it a data L2. I don't actually know exactly how the Grass system works, but they're taking all this data they scrape from the Internet and they want to commit some proofs that they scraped it and what the data integrity is, and they want to commit that to Solana L1. And that is not an L2 arbitram or optimism. That is a functionally very different thing. They need to interface with Solana somehow.
00:27:39.687 - 00:28:26.371, Speaker A: They're committing some hashes or Merkle roots or whatever to Solana on some frequency. But like that is a distinct function. I look at Magic Block, which is this gaming thing, and it is, it's a gaming svm and they call themselves an ephemeral roll up and it is the svm. But unlike again, Arbitrum or Optimism, it is ephemeral meaning it is intended to be wound down. And like the defining feature of arbitrary optimism is obviously the state is persistent and state doesn't just go away. And so I look at that and to me, that speaks to me and says, yes, it's the svm, but you're going to use it for functionally different things than you are using Solana L1 for. Because this ephemerality is going to lead you to do new stuff with it.
00:28:26.371 - 00:28:47.857, Speaker A: I look at grass. It's functionally different. And so we came up with the term network extension as a way to try and encapsulate the teams that are doing these things that are still related to Solana in some way, but they're not just like the SVM copied on a centralized sequencer. The SVM copied on a centralized sequencer, sure, go ahead and call it an L2, I don't care.
00:28:48.041 - 00:28:49.697, Speaker B: Those are not things you would fund, basically.
00:28:49.801 - 00:29:50.597, Speaker A: Yeah, we have not invested in any and I don't think we will. But then I think there's all of these other cool things happening and we wanted a term to capture that and, and so we thought, well, these things are extending the functionality of the network because they are doing things that you cannot do on Solana L1. And then the other kind of reason we went with the network extensions term was there's token extensions came out, you know, a little while ago and we wanted to continue on this theme of extending, you know, the network functionality. So that's kind of the basis for it. I'm not really sure why the people care so much. Like I guess they're source of frustration is we're like architecturally doing something that's similar ish, or even like 90% similar, therefore we must use their term. I don't know, like it's just like a weird thing to get frustrated over, you know, and you want to ask.
00:29:50.621 - 00:29:52.133, Speaker B: About other L1s as well?
00:29:52.229 - 00:30:00.703, Speaker C: Yeah, no. So we've seen, you know, Sui Monad, Mega Eth come out as Monad and.
00:30:00.719 - 00:30:07.703, Speaker A: Mega Eth are not out. They are not highly anticipated projects about to launch tbd.
00:30:07.799 - 00:30:41.285, Speaker C: I'm not sure when, but basically almost in response to Solana and you know, potentially being, you know, definitely branding themselves as alternatives to Solana. And we've also seen elements of new other layer ones trying to be quote unquote, Solana killers. At least that's a brewing narrative in the liquid markets. Curious to hear what your take is on what you think a superior alternative to Solana can be and whether there's anything out there right now that even remotely resembles that.
00:30:43.225 - 00:31:22.035, Speaker A: If the North Star is decentralized Nasdaq, I do not believe any of these other teams are even really trying to play ball if you're going to. A centralized sequencer like that, to me, is not decentralized Nasdaq. Now, maybe I'm being like, too ideologically consistent and, like, I should lower my bar and a centralized sequencer is fine. I don't know. My guess is, as you know, if that server is in America, my guess is most people in India or in Singapore or in Europe are going to say that's not decentralized because of the server is in the United States. I may be wrong. I don't know.
00:31:22.035 - 00:31:50.353, Speaker A: We'll see. But I don't think they're really trying to compete. So I think that's one way to answer your question. I think that's not how you wanted me to answer. And so let me also try and answer it in the way that you wanted me to answer it. Solana. Very few people have tried to compete with Ethereum harder than I have, and I have systematically underappreciated the difficulty of competing with Ethereum.
00:31:50.353 - 00:32:28.607, Speaker A: I did not think it was going to be this hard. And the only reason it was even possible was because the gas fees on ethereum spiked in 2020. And if the gas fees didn't spike, I'm 90% confident Solana would be irrelevant today. Wow. And so you needed that to happen. And so far, the only empirical thing we have seen that can really cause an ecosystem to get off the ground after the first one is the gas fees need to spike. Obviously that is no longer really happening today on Solana or on Ethereum or elsewhere.
00:32:28.607 - 00:33:10.541, Speaker A: And so the market is getting more competitive. It's naturally getting harder to launch. The other way to look at this is to say, like, at least Solana very explicitly. Anatoly, from day one, has been saying he wants to operate at the limits of physics. And the Solana network is by no means today at the limits of physics, but is certainly approaching that. Fire Dancer is by far the biggest step since the network launch towards getting to the limits of physics. And the closer you get to the limits of physics, obviously that by definition means there's like, less and less room to the physics limit, and that's less and less room for anyone else to compete on the performance front.
00:33:10.541 - 00:34:05.725, Speaker A: Um, I'm not here to make claims about Mega Ether, Bear or Chain or Aptos or SWE and how they compare to Solana. I don't particularly know those teams will probably squabble over stuff, but, like, it's pretty obvious they're not 10x improvements. Um, they may have certain parameters here or there or certain features here or there that are better. But as a, as a whole, it's pretty obvious for anyone who's used these systems that it's not a 10x improvement. And so they have not been able to. None of these ecosystems have achieved escape velocity, I think because they don't represent a 10x improvement on the performance and gas fees function. So the open question, I think for all of these guys is, is there some other vector that they can identify on which they can be 10x that people care about that can, you know, lead them to achieving escape velocity? I've spoken with most of these people and I can't say that any of them have convinced me that they have a, you know, a good answer to that question.
00:34:05.725 - 00:34:15.865, Speaker A: But, you know, it's possible that there's like another way to think about the problem that can lead to getting to escape velocity.
00:34:15.945 - 00:34:31.165, Speaker B: I think we can probably do a whole episode on like Challenger Elwynns versus Solana. But for the interest of time, I also like to kind of focus on something else because we spent a lot of time talking about Solana, which is obviously a great win. What was your biggest loss in your investing career? Like, what was the most kind of notable lesson?
00:34:32.705 - 00:34:45.725, Speaker A: I mean, in terms of percentage of fund? I mean, if you wanted to say Solana FTX at the end of 22, like, you could say that, but I'm guessing that was not the intent of the question.
00:34:46.825 - 00:34:51.510, Speaker B: Doesn't have to be big, like just something that's the most memorable or taught you something new that you didn't know before.
00:34:51.672 - 00:35:19.135, Speaker A: Um, yeah, we shorted Ripple in 2018. Going into their, their conferences, I forget the name of it, but Bill Clinton spoke at it. I remember that. And we were pretty convinced that they had absolutely nothing. They were not going to announce anything of substance. It was just gonna be all vaporware. And man, we were right about substance and we were wrong about the price.
00:35:19.135 - 00:35:28.455, Speaker A: And that was our first wake up moment. For as a very visceral moment of markets can be irrational longer than you can be solvent.
00:35:29.435 - 00:35:32.535, Speaker B: That's something we come back to when we talk about timeframes as well.
00:35:33.075 - 00:36:12.095, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think given that you've had so many different wins in many different verticals in crypto, I think one thing a lot of the CTD gens remember is loot in 2021. And I just want to bring it up again, mainly because, and for those that don't know, loot was basically an NFT series of nothing except a couple of lines of text and basically being packaged as an nft. And so I just wanted to understand what was the thought process of purchasing those NFTs, what went wrong? What were the lessons learned?
00:36:13.585 - 00:36:44.931, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say we definitely have, we're feeling some fomo. I think that was for sure the core of what drove the decision making. And it felt exciting, like there was that at least for a brief window of time, a lot of developers futzing around with the thing. And so our view was like, okay, well if we want to be on the train, like we got to get on the train. And that was the cost of getting on the train. We thought it was going to go somewhere. I think in hindsight, one, we were definitely feeling fomo.
00:36:44.931 - 00:37:27.049, Speaker A: And I think two, we probably weren't as rigorous as we should have been in looking at how the loot nfts as a standalone thing, how that would skew up, skew the incentives for developers building and basically lead to suboptimal outcomes for developers. Because like, yeah, if all these people buy all these loot NFTs, well, that's great, but then if you're a developer building on it, then how, how are you going to make money? If the loot tokens go up, good for you, but there's anything for the developer. And so, you know, developers need to make money. Is the lesson from that. We knew that lesson before and we just, you know, let it slide, slide through our underwriting because we were just like, this thing seems really cool.
00:37:27.177 - 00:37:49.351, Speaker C: And I guess to, to generalize it a bit more, whenever you're trying to find net new things that you think are going to push the space forward, do you think that this will inevitably happen, whether it's loot, whether it's something else? Is this sort of like a cost of business of exploring? Basically the term fuck around and find out comes from.
00:37:49.383 - 00:38:45.279, Speaker A: Right, yeah, probably the most important blog, the blog post that has most influenced how I think about risk. His blog was written by Fred Wilson quite some time ago, maybe 14, 15, 16. And he basically said if you're in the venture business and if your 0 rate is too low, then you're not taking enough risk. And I remember reading that and my brain kind of like exploded because I was like, what do you mean you don't want to have enough zeros or you want to have more zeros in your portfolio? And you know, now in crypto, that's different because of token dynamics. So, like, ignore the mechanical differences between token and equity. But this notion that as a, as a vc, you need to be taking risk and you need to have zeros in your portfolio, that. That really resonated with me.
00:38:45.279 - 00:39:12.151, Speaker A: And so as a function of risk, I agree strongly with like, gofund. Net new things, because that I think given skew is going to generally be favorable as long as things are sized correctly. And then in terms of, you know, the other part of it is just like, I'm a curious guy, like, I'm not interested in the seventh per decks anymore. And so, like, I want to see like the next frontier of stuff. True, yeah.
00:39:12.183 - 00:39:37.115, Speaker B: So I think in terms of the next frontier of stuff, I'm curious what your thoughts are on kind of making bets in L1s as well, because obviously a lot of chains are trying to get to where Solana is. And I think we probably share our cap table for some of the chains and one of them, like sei, for instance. So what is the thought process behind investing in other L1s? If you already kind of at the view that, hey, Solana is probably the end game, like, how does that fit into your mental model of how L1s play out?
00:39:37.200 - 00:40:00.905, Speaker A: You know, again, all of the L1 teams, they need to find some dimension that they can do that the others can't. And so, like, I'll actually flag sei. So we led the seed round of sei. I think y'all were in that round, if I'm not mistaken. And SEI was not. V1 was not the current SEI product, which is the current product of the parallel EVM. SEI.
00:40:00.905 - 00:40:31.023, Speaker A: V1 was a Cosmos Cosmosm chain, I think, but we didn't invest in it because we wanted to invest in a cosmosm chain. We invested in SEI because Jay and the team were very clear. And they said, look, in a permissionless consensus system, you are bottlenecked on performance in these ways because of consensus overhead and stuff. We're going to limit, limit, limit the validator set. And then moreover, he was even more opinionated. They said, we're going to prioritize Oracle transactions at the top of the block. And there were probably two or three other things.
00:40:31.023 - 00:41:22.335, Speaker A: I don't remember the details off the top of my head, but he basically said, look, Ethereum and Solana are max, permissionless, fairly unopinionated about lots of these things. We are going to be opinionated and we are going to make decisions that like break neutrality because we believe breaking neutrality will lead to a better product and user experience. And we loved that about Jay and the team because it represented first order principles thinking and it represented a thing that in the event he was right. Ethereum and Solana were extremely unlikely to do because the ethos of them was to not make opinionated decisions of that nature. And so like I loved our bet on say because like it represented that kind of thinking. They launched the V1, the adoption wasn't there. And then again, props to the SEI team for, for saying, okay look, people don't seem to want this.
00:41:22.335 - 00:41:36.981, Speaker A: And he said, hey let's we think parallel EVM can work. And they made that pivot and it's working better, certainly better than V1 was. Again, we'll see where, where it goes. But that's the kind of thinking we want to see out of teams building, whether it's an L1 or an L2.
00:41:37.133 - 00:42:09.273, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm seeing definitely a theme with your investments in terms of being very function specific when it comes to projects like this. So for instance, filecoin is another one. Where they started, they pivoted to, well, they expanded to a FVM so they have their own virtual machine. But I'm sure you didn't invest because you want to do another L1. But that's also curious to me because I think a few years ago you guys shared a thesis on Arweave as well, which was probably the only known competitor for something like filecoin. So did your thesis on storage evolve over time and kind of. How do you see these different projects now?
00:42:09.449 - 00:42:30.317, Speaker A: Yeah, things. Things have definitely evolved. We first got excited about Arweave for two reasons. One, filecoin was and still is very complicated. And two, Arweave, most importantly was very simple. And also like the value prop was just different. And so we really liked the simplicity of Arweave both in like the message.
00:42:30.317 - 00:43:11.393, Speaker A: The actual architecture of it was like fairly simple to understand and the use case was distinct and like very crypto native and ethos like censorship resistance stored forever. Like had like a lot of like kind of bitcoin ethos vibes to it. And so for all the reasons we got pretty excited about are we fairly early and put on a pretty meaningful position. We were pretty frustrated there over time because the teams go to market instincts, we're not aligned with ours and you know, like every founder is different and we try and kind of guide them and coach them to help them improve. And that was one where we could not, not get there. So we sold all of our long time ago made, made good money on it. I'm glad we put on the bet.
00:43:11.393 - 00:43:41.875, Speaker A: I think our thesis underwriting was correct. The execution was not there. And you know, that's, that's fine. Good reason to exit with filecoin. We put on a position much, much later and everyone on my team was like, Kyle, you've always hated filecoin forever because it's so complicated. Is it still so complicated? And yes, it's still very complicated. But the reason we got to a yes, ultimately was just like appreciating the sheer technical ambition.
00:43:41.875 - 00:44:12.315, Speaker A: I still think to this day filecoin is probably the most technically ambitious thing in crypto, for better and for worse. And yeah, and like again, thinking about venturesque like people who were thinking really big and like Juan is like, I believe I can re architect how data flows over the Internet and how data is computed on the Internet that spoke to us. And so we ultimately got fairly excited about filecoin and put on a position because of that.
00:44:12.655 - 00:45:02.085, Speaker B: Got it. And for the last part of this, I want to zoom out a bit and actually involve both of you almost as guests for Darryl as well because so for listeners who don't know, I think Daryl is much more of a trader than I am. So he's very, he's an apex predator on the order books. I am more of the venture guy and I know you talk a lot about navigating timeframes as well and always kind of focusing on the very high timeframe. So I'm very curious to get both your thoughts on this because in terms of like market timing, navigating timeframes, I'm always, I always find this fascinating because you know, if I'm long high timeframe, very bullish on Solana, for instance, if the price craters by like 50%, I'd see that as a big opportunity to have, you know, sold the highs and then double my position at the lows. Now for some investors still think that actually that's noise that distracts from the thesis building and the conviction and messes up with execution. So curious like how you guys think about just the topic of navigating timeframes.
00:45:02.085 - 00:45:03.185, Speaker B: As investors.
00:45:07.285 - 00:45:47.729, Speaker A: It'S very hard to develop systematic alpha across many different timeframes. At the most extremes, it's very clear. HFT firms have alpha at the microsecond or nanosecond timescale. And the skill set and human capital and financial capital and software required to do that is distinct but obviously doable. And there's plenty of firms that are very famous for doing all that stuff. And then at the other extreme there's lots of firms that are famous for being able to understand trends and ride those trends over multi year periods. Almost no firms do both of those things.
00:45:47.729 - 00:46:18.871, Speaker A: And there's obviously a bunch of stuff in the middle. Multicoin. I think we are, I feel pretty confident saying we are pretty good at long horizon alpha. What's long is like, I mean minimum 12 months and like ideally 36 plus. We're pretty good at that. We've done that pretty regularly for quite some time. We certainly, we are generally skeptical of our own ability to extract alpha on shorter horizons.
00:46:18.871 - 00:46:56.115, Speaker A: Not to say we don't try. We certainly do, we don't talk about that stuff as much because like, hey, we made whatever $50 million on this trade is just like not our brand. So like we just don't really go there. But obviously doesn't mean we don't try. We do have a liquid fund. We can, we can do those things and we do. I've come to, I think my biggest learning has been traders have to, you know, gauging your own confidence interval of like I'm 52% confident versus 64% confident versus 78% confident, whatever on this trade that has a horizon measured in, you know, days or maybe weeks.
00:46:56.115 - 00:47:47.325, Speaker A: I struggle with my own assessment of my own confidence interval on those things. Whereas I can look at things that I think are going to happen in 36 months and I can assign 95% confidence intervals to those. And I'm much better at that than at the latter than the former. I struggle, given my own challenge with doing the former. Whenever I meet good traders I'm always like, I'm trying to understand like how do you synthesize to get those confidence intervals, you know, correct? How do you do that actually? So it's a very different skill set and one I think it's worth cultivating over time. I mean the absolute best investors in the world can extract alpha at different time horizons. Learning to tune those muscles takes a long time.
00:47:47.325 - 00:48:04.115, Speaker A: And of course whenever you make a decision, you need to be crystal clear with yourself at the time of this decision. What is the time horizon under which you're making the decision? Yeah, and you can choose to change the time horizon later, but you have to then re underwrite it under a new time horizon at the later time. Do not let a trade turn into an investment.
00:48:04.235 - 00:48:09.099, Speaker B: Yeah, that's, I think that's a lesson that you have as well. Don't turn into a community Member or something you don't believe in?
00:48:09.187 - 00:50:15.851, Speaker C: Yes. Well, I think, to answer your question, from my point of view, I think there are two ways to do it. Obviously the first way is Carl's way, which is if you're underwriting it on a three year time horizon, you cannot be having any form of TA price invalidations of any form of any sort. You're basically a die hard holder and you are consistently underwriting it based on a fundamental level, right? Whether your long term thesis is playing out, however, if you choose to approach the market from a shorter term point of view, then it's, I would say it's not prudent to say don't have a price invalidation because then all your trade setups are not congruent with the reason why you're making them, right? So for me, interpreting what Carl is saying, so if, let's say I would accept what he's saying and let's say the thesis is Solana will flip Ethereum for me, I would use that backdrop to skew the selection of what I will be trading as time goes on. So for example, if I am constructive on the market and let's say I have a blank piece of paper with like 50 different names I can pick from, all of a sudden I will wait the ones with Solana influence or Solana itself high on the list, right? So for example, of the 50 names, just hypothetically, if the market had 50 names right there, if TA showed me that, you know, of those 50, 25 were decent, then of the 25 I can pick maybe the five of them that would fit in line with the higher timeframe skew of me wanting to be more oriented with Sonata. So this could be, you know, Jiro Jupiter, it could be Solana itself, for example, where I would just begin to play more around those waters as opposed to trying to long every eth dip, right? I can probably make money. If you are a good trader and you're taking independent good setups, doing both things, but you probably make more trying to long sold it versus an E dip because you know, yada yada, it bounces it stronger, whatever, over time you get market share, you can trade a pair, all this kind of stuff to.
00:50:15.883 - 00:50:19.443, Speaker B: Use the high timeframe thesis to inform the lower time execution, correct?
00:50:19.499 - 00:50:38.171, Speaker C: Yes. But you cannot again make invalidations or if you're longing Solana on a high timeframe, you cannot have price invalidations just because market structure broke. That's a very common term that traders use and means jack shit. If you're thinking about it from a trough month up horizon.
00:50:38.323 - 00:50:56.085, Speaker B: I'm actually curious how you think about pricing because Kyle, you mentioned something about xrp. You were researching the fundamentals. Nothing's happening there. It's a piece of. But then the price was saying that this is the next, you know, the best thing since lifespread. So how do you incorporate price into your decisions given how inefficient a market crypto is?
00:50:57.185 - 00:51:21.315, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean again like time horizon matters. If you have a short open then like you need to be sensitive to that and you need to understand what your risk limits are and be very clear about when you're going to get stopped, stopped out or not. For you know, multi year bets, price is not really an input at all. You should only be using fundamentals to invalidate the thesis.
00:51:22.055 - 00:51:32.871, Speaker B: Even if given the, you know, we've seen drawdowns in markets where the entire market trades down like 90%. Even in those cases, do you try not to just care about that or correct.
00:51:32.903 - 00:51:48.095, Speaker A: I mean, well, the mandate of our hedge fund is to be not fully deployed at all times. So we tell our LPs, that's what we do. And so we're not here to time that we tell our LPs very clearly. We are here to outperform via asset selection across market cycles.
00:51:48.795 - 00:52:05.797, Speaker B: One big thing that I think ties into this is also this concept of hype. Because I always say that as a VC you should run away from hype. And this is something that I think Peter Thiel says as well. But as a trader, actually I think you tend to embrace hype. You try to see, hey what where is attention flowing. But there in some cases maybe hype informs adoption as well. Right.
00:52:05.797 - 00:52:16.785, Speaker B: So sometimes it doesn't like in the case of loot, but sometimes it might for some of the other kind of defi applications, for instance. So how do you incorporate hype into your framework?
00:52:18.085 - 00:53:04.233, Speaker A: If something is getting hyped up, it is probably no longer a good long term fundamental investment. That means you are probably late. I'd say whenever something, you know, becomes a defined category, we are in most cases no longer interested in that category. There are exceptions but like yeah, we generally once, once something's got a term on it, we're probably not super excited. Traders can trade and make money. But you know, for us, if, if there's hype on a category that means a lot of VCs are looking at it and that means their willingness to pay a higher price than us is there. So we're probably not going to get.
00:53:04.249 - 00:53:08.325, Speaker B: Much Alpha, how do you think about hype versus adoption?
00:53:08.825 - 00:53:28.057, Speaker C: So it really depends again on the timeframe that you trade. If you're trading on a one week time horizon, then the more hype there is likely the better it is because the first thing is price often tends to lead adoption. And so the first thing that you see in a lot of these hype trains is obviously price going up.
00:53:28.201 - 00:53:28.601, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:28.673 - 00:54:15.283, Speaker C: And then it's a dicey sort of springboard that you're walking on to see how much you can sort of extract and whether you can re underwrite if the fundamentals that are driving that hype actually live up to expectations. Usually there's a common saying, if you see a fire, you would rush in to pour fuel over the fire so that it becomes large sorrows, it becomes larger. Yes. So I typically like to plea in these waters because I will not recommend it for the average person. But I think over time I've just had a natural skew over when I think. I have sort of an intuition of when I think the hype can continue to increase and when I think it's beginning to fizzle out.
00:54:15.379 - 00:54:38.655, Speaker B: I think that's the main reason why people yell at each other on cts. Because we are trading the same assets but just different timeframes. But we're literally just trading the same thing. So someone could be talking about the technical benefits of Solana and someone can be talking about the setup into a breakpoint. So that kind of confuses a lot of people. Is that ever frustrating for you? Does that happen within your team where some guys are maybe more low timeframe wired? Some guys are like VC timeframe wired.
00:54:39.435 - 00:54:50.787, Speaker A: I mean, I think when people first join multicoin, yes, it takes a while to adjust. But for the members of our team who have been around for a while, their brains get rewired correctly.
00:54:50.891 - 00:55:24.185, Speaker B: Yeah, it's brainwashed. So one thing I also notice is it's harder in crypto to differentiate hype from adoption. So if you look at the social fi stuff, for instance, like Frentech, you look at DAU charts, you look at revenues accrued, you would think that, hey, this is a hockey stick, right? And in a lot of Web2VC frameworks, they say, okay, if you see a hockey stick, that's the time to go in. But encrypted, the hockey sticks often look like this. So you see that in the case of like Axie as well. I'm curious, when you look at consumer applications, I noticed that you guys don't do a lot of them. Is it because it's so hard to differentiate hype and adoption.
00:55:25.125 - 00:57:03.447, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, whenever we look at anything with, through a consumer lens, I think the primary question we are trying to answer is what is the psychological state of the consumer at the time they are engaging in some action? And so like in the case of Friend Tech, for example, you know, I was like, I got on there somewhat early and I didn't understand. Everyone has, you have email, you have Slack, you have Telegram, you have your whatever, maybe you have email newsletters, who knows? You have all of these information sources that you already go to to learn about the world, tick, the TikTok, Instagram, whatever. I think most people generally today feel like they have too many apps that they have they have to open, but that like in practice, they end up opening throughout the course of the day to get various forms of information that they care about, whether it's financial markets related or not. And I think the bar psychologically for consumers to add a new app to their regular repertoire is very high. And so the quality of whatever is there needs to be very high. And so when I first started using Forentech and I probably joined 10 or 15 people, other people's rooms, and I was active in my own room as well, My goal was to understand, am I feeling an organic need to want to open the app to check my room, or am I doing this out of, out of social obligation to the other people. And obviously social obligation can turn into organic, like organic desire.
00:57:03.447 - 00:57:35.725, Speaker A: And so I was, you know, every day when I was opening, I was trying to ask myself, do I feel that, that interest. Obviously at some point, four days went by, I didn't open it, and I was like, oh, that probably tells me something. And then two weeks goes by and I didn't open it. And that probably tells me something. And so, you know, whenever we look at these things, that's what we try and understand is, you know, what is the kind of psychology that is driving user behavior. We're obviously not going to be perfect at making those assessments, but I'd say that's the primary lens that we try and analyze consumer things through.
00:57:36.025 - 00:57:56.765, Speaker B: And for the final part of this, I'm very curious about this because I always like to dive into the processes of investors, especially people with a track record such as yours. So one thing I've heard was that you don't allow for analogies inside multicoin. I forgot who told me this. My little birdie told me this. So can you explain, like, why that is? Like, how did you develop the Policy. And what does it do?
00:57:58.825 - 00:58:59.951, Speaker A: You know, in school they like teach you, I remember like on the, whatever it was, the SATs or the earlier ones that we took, they would like teach you about analogies. And I think actually in a lot of academic contexts they're fairly fine. The problem with academia versus the real world is in academia there's always a correct answer to every question. And in the real world everything is a function of probabilities and you have unknown unknowns. And my observation is people take this skill, they're taught in academia when there are, I mean, it's like a, literally a multiple choice question where there's an incorrect answer and then you apply that same logical reasoning to projecting into the future about unknowns and risk. I find that that, that fails. And for the more specific reason of most things in the world.
00:58:59.951 - 00:59:22.111, Speaker A: Don't cleanly analogize. I'm going to pick on Haseeb here just because like Haseeb and I are kind of friendly. He wrote a blog post a few years ago that got a lot of pickup. It was like blockchains are like cities or something. And he talked about like Ethereum is New York and whatever salon is Chicago. And I don't remember where the analogy went. And I remember I was so angry.
00:59:22.223 - 00:59:25.831, Speaker B: When I read it because triggered because.
00:59:25.863 - 01:00:19.175, Speaker A: I was like, dude, the constraints of cities are based on the fact that there's 24 hours in a day and the fact that you need 16 of those hours approximately you are awake and eight of those you are asleep. And so you have time constraints on your ability to travel, to do whatever it is you need to do over that 16 hour period and get back to a bed. And every single decision in a city is very obviously predicated on that core limitation in biology. Um, obviously we don't talk about that in those contexts. But if you really think about it like that is it and commute times and when the trash people come by and when you go out for lunch and your willingness to walk five blocks versus one block, everything you do is a function of you have 16 hours of awake in a day and you gotta get back to a bed at the end. At the end. And obviously that clearly does not map to software at all.
01:00:19.175 - 01:01:02.525, Speaker A: And I remember reading that, and that was probably four or five years ago. And I was so pissed off. And then I started seeing it just on Twitter. People would just use analogies. And I think the most common one you see in Crypto is like iOS and Android to talk about Ethereum and Solana, which is again Total nonsense. Because like the dynamics of operating systems may being made by two of the most sophisticated large cap companies in the world versus these like decentralized financial systems built by a bunch of like hodgepodge people in all these different countries is like, again, the dynamics are just like so obviously different. And so I found that, you know, just as I like to say, reasoning by analogy actively leads to the wrong conclusion.
01:01:02.525 - 01:01:10.393, Speaker A: Very few of these concepts over time can map directly. In fact, it's almost impossible for them to map directly.
01:01:10.489 - 01:01:12.927, Speaker B: There's more focus on like first principles, I guess.
01:01:13.041 - 01:01:18.615, Speaker A: Yes, reasoning by analogy is explicitly an excuse for not reasoning from first principles.
01:01:19.275 - 01:01:36.291, Speaker B: Something that we try to aspire to as well. And speaking of us, so you don't run multicoin alone, you run this with your co founder, Tushar. So I'm sure you guys have disagreements sometimes in terms of asset selection. Time horizon, this is something that we kind of deal with as well. You want to explain kind of how we deal with it with the veto thing?
01:01:36.443 - 01:02:06.061, Speaker C: Yeah. So for us, whenever. Well, generally Jason and I don't disagree all too often or not. That wouldn't be a very good partnership. But in the time. But we are pretty vocal about our opinions and I think we both have pretty strong opinions from time to time. And obviously because our brains are wired pretty differently, those opinions can clash quite violently, I'd say probably it's happened two, three times in the last two years, so not too frequently.
01:02:06.061 - 01:02:35.593, Speaker C: But, you know, it does happen. And in those situations, what we've learned or how we've learned to deal with it is basically we award each partner one veto, actually two vetoes a year. So basically, if I feel extremely strongly about something and Jason really disagrees, I can choose to pull my veto or use my veto. And basically when I do it, he has to shut up. Like, he has to accept it, he has to trust me. I'm his partner. And he has to take it.
01:02:35.593 - 01:03:04.441, Speaker C: And then we have, basically, it will likely be in some form of a trade or investment and there will be certain time horizon. A time horizon will be discussed. KPIs will be discussed. Pricing targets and pricing validations will be discussed. If I'm wrong, after the set time period, my veto gets, my veto gets taken away. If I'm correct on it, my veto gets replenished. Almost like a challenge in tennis, you know, when, when, when you're, when you're, and when you're, you know, challenging the umpire.
01:03:04.441 - 01:03:19.005, Speaker C: So that's how we do it in Tangent. We, so far we've found that it has. It's worked for now. But I'm curious with you guys. You know, you've, you've let a run multi coin much longer than we have. What are you, how do you usually approach this?
01:03:20.545 - 01:04:04.265, Speaker A: We don't have a formal veto system. Our system is squishier. And it's a function of when I say I believe this to be 8 out of 10, I mean it. And I'm not just I don't believe it 4 out of 10, but like I'm just saying 8 because like I want to do it. And that trust of like not, you know, over overstating your confidence, so that's kind of how we've resolved it in the past is via that, that trust mechanism. We also generally have a bias for inaction. As I like to say the multi coin special is doing nothing.
01:04:04.265 - 01:05:05.271, Speaker A: So we, and we were definitely very happy with our bias for inaction. I think we also both have a recognition of, hey, like, was it one of us vehemently disagrees and the other one, you know, vehemently, you know, wants to do something? If the skew is venture, it's like, okay, well if you're right, you know, we think you can make 100x then like the person who's, you know, disagreeing will say, look like I don't agree but like I understand at least you have to at least believe in the event that your priors are invalidated that you can in fact get to that large the larger outcome and then you generally speaking will bias towards yes in that situation because like, that's how skew works. And we're generally in the business of taking, you know, that's where our max downside is 1 and our max upside is 1050, 100x, whatever. And so I think for us actually just the nature of the decisions we are making lend themselves. It's much easier to resolve, resolve those conflicts.
01:05:05.343 - 01:05:09.262, Speaker C: I guess not. It's not every day that you have conviction scores of 8 or 9 out.
01:05:09.303 - 01:05:23.321, Speaker A: Of 10 and you know, yeah, I think that that's also, I mean again, if you're making things that are, you know, you think if you're right, you're, you know, 30, 40, 50x outcomes, those are usually pretty hard to have high conviction scores on, just by definition.
01:05:23.513 - 01:05:39.165, Speaker B: Yeah. So. Well, Kyle, to close this out, I want to give our listeners something, something that they can take away with in terms of, you know, actionable. So what would you say is a bet or a vertical that you're almost as excited for as solana that people should be doing their research on.
01:05:40.145 - 01:06:11.175, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think the deep end category is kind of the most interesting sector in crypto. We were very fortunate to be early there with our investment in Helium. Today, you know, there's a, there's probably a few hundred, I'd say depend teams that have raised money. Multicoin is an investor and among hardware focused teams, three, Helium, hivemapper and Fuse, which we just announced Fuse a couple of weeks ago. Fuse does not have a token yet. The other two do. Fuse token will come out at some point soonish.
01:06:11.175 - 01:06:37.561, Speaker A: And then among teams that are software oriented, we've probably done at least a dozen, if not more. It lends itself towards crypto native capital formation to solve a problem on the supply side of any given market. And then of course the question with all of these Deepin teams is the demand side. I find a lot of people are like, Deepin doesn't solve demand. And like, well, yes, that's true. By definition, depend is only a reference to supply. So you have to.
01:06:37.561 - 01:07:34.605, Speaker A: The hard part of underwriting these things is to go look at the demand growth factors for each one and you cannot homogenize the growth factors for these. So like Helium's demand drivers or is like consumers signing up for Helium mobile cell phone plans and like offload from various telecoms. That is a completely different go to market motion than hivemapper where hivemappers like we've aggregated all this data, we've done all this AI on top of it and now we're going to go to companies that need maps, whether it's ups, Zillow, BMW, whatever. Those are not high map or customers are just picking those as like examples and those are enterprise sales cycles that you're like going through like legal and contract and like, you know, so just like a completely different sales cycle. And so you can't homogenize the demand driver for Helium to high vapor and vice versa. So that's a sector we're really excited about. We're super pumped about Helium and hivemapper.
01:07:34.605 - 01:07:42.653, Speaker A: We've been invested in both four years. I think both of them are doing really good on the demand side. You should go do your own research. Lots of public data on the dashboards on both.
01:07:42.789 - 01:08:06.827, Speaker B: Yeah, we're actually doing our research right now, so. Well, thank you so much for your time, Kyle. This has been amazing. Hey there Jason here.
