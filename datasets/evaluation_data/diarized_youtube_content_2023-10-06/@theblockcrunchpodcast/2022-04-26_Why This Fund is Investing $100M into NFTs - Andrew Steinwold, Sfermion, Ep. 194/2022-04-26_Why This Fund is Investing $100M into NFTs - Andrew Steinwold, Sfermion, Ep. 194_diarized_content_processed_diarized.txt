00:00:02.120 - 00:00:03.942, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, gentlemen, welcome to the.
00:00:03.958 - 00:00:08.754, Speaker B: Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto.
00:00:16.614 - 00:00:21.486, Speaker C: This episode of the Blockcrunch podcast is brought to you by Coinflex. Stick around to learn more.
00:00:21.590 - 00:00:48.284, Speaker B: And hey, everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockchain podcast. Today I'm super excited to have Andrew Steinwald, managing partner at SFO Permian, which is a fund that is exclusively dedicated towards NFT and metaverse investing, on the show today to talk to us about his framework when it comes to NFT investing, as well as what trends he's excited about. Now, Andrew is an investor in companies that you've heard of before, like Opensea, Artblocks, and Superrare. I'm really excited to dive into all of those. So, Andrew, welcome to the show.
00:00:48.824 - 00:00:54.092, Speaker A: Jason, thank you so much for having me. Been a listener for quite some time. So really excited to chat.
00:00:54.288 - 00:01:02.584, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I appreciate you coming on. So I guess for those who are not already following your amazing twitter profile, what is Fermion and what's the story behind it?
00:01:03.364 - 00:01:51.400, Speaker A: So Fermion is an NFT focused investment firm, and we actually have two different funds. One fund that's focused on direct NFT investing and the other fund is focused on venture. And we felt like we needed to have this multi, multifaceted approach because the empty ecosystem itself is not only very broad and kind of can often be confusing at sometimes, but also if you're just looking at from a venture angle, you're losing out on the returns that can be generated from the asset angle and vice versa. The assets are really important as well. And also the strategies inform one another. They're pretty symbiotic in the sense that what makes a really good, great NFT to invest in, oftentimes it funnels back to the fundamentals of the project itself. So the team, the product, the market, etcetera, kind of those venture fundamentals.
00:01:51.400 - 00:02:00.204, Speaker A: And then, you know, I think that going forward, I think most people involved with NFTs will end up being involved in both the venture level and also the asset level.
00:02:00.784 - 00:02:36.644, Speaker B: That's really interesting. And we're definitely going to talk about that because we've discussed this on the show a few times, like whether you think a basket of nfts outperform a basket of NFT related companies. But before we do that, you know, we took a look at some of your investments, and I think there's about 50 companies so far. I think eleven of them are infrastructure related. There's twelve of them related to games and I think 27 of them related to marketplace. These are studios, DeFi, rails, daos and so on. Would you say that the infrastructure games, and I guess the DaO infrast, additional value add infrastructure, are those the three major buckets that you guys focus on?
00:02:36.984 - 00:03:21.792, Speaker A: Yeah, we purposely put it quite broad. This is through our venture vehicle, our NFT vehicle. We don't actually talk about necessarily what we're investing on the asset side, not because we're trying to be super secretive, but just because the markets are so thinly traded that we want to be more cautious about when we speak about things on the NFT side. Because if we say something, then maybe there's a daily liquidity of two or three items sold per day or something like that, and then that could mess up the markets there. On the venture side, we put a broad scope where let's do NFT infrastructure. I guess the main areas of focus within that infrastructure bucket are really financial infrastructure, social or experiential infrastructure, and also gaming infrastructure. We also participate in direct gaming deals.
00:03:21.792 - 00:04:00.934, Speaker A: The reason being is because we feel like games can actually, you can end up investing in a game that ends up building out its own infrastructure. Like for example, Axie is probably the best example for this. Started with a game, great customer acquisition funnel right there, generating tons of revenue, has a ton of users from day one to use your actual products and infrastructure that you're building out. And they end up building marketplace, a wallet blockchain, a Dex, like all this different stuff that they're productizing and launching that to the broader community to build on top of. And that to us, is super exciting. And we think that Axie was kind of like the spearhead there, but there's going to be a lot more plays similar to that.
00:04:01.434 - 00:04:17.014, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think you guys are probably one of the very few funds out there with this full fledged thesis that only focuses on nfts. So I guess that brings me to my next question, which is, what is your background? What got you interested in nfts? Only I know you've been in crypto for a while, but why specifically nfts?
00:04:17.674 - 00:04:37.134, Speaker A: Yeah, so great question. It's basically because we were underperforming crypto markets. Sorry, we were underperforming our competitors within the crypto markets. If you had the option, essentially. I'll take it back a little bit. 2017, launch a crypto fund. I originally got involved with bitcoin 2013.
00:04:37.134 - 00:05:09.854, Speaker A: 2017 launched a fund, and 2018 we realized, okay, we're out competing the market, but we're underperforming. Our peers. So if you had the option to invest in this shiny crypto fund or Polynexus capital, which is our old crypto fund, you're going to do the shiny, the cool one, just because there's a certain kind of reason. There was a couple reasons for that. Number one, we didn't have a brand. Like, we didn't do podcasts, we didn't do newsletters, we didn't do blog posts. And we thought we were being very security conscious by not being super out there because we were terrified of getting hacked.
00:05:09.854 - 00:05:54.544, Speaker A: And that is true. That's still the case that if you're low key, chances of getting hacked are much slimmer versus if you're out there in public. But with that, your ability to get into great deals and have stellar deal flow is greatly diminished. And so our thought process was we made some mistakes by not being super vocal and by not being getting out there because we were super early. And now we're suffering the consequences of that in the sense that we're kind of a middle of the road crypto fund, unfortunately. And so we were looking at in 2018, okay, what submarket within crypto? Because already by then, it's getting very diverse. What submarket can we enter and become players in? Like, we want to build something impactful.
00:05:54.544 - 00:06:15.296, Speaker A: We don't want to be a middle of the road, fundamentally. So let's dive into different sectors and see what we can build our expertise in early on and become known as those people, so to speak. So dove into Defi 2018. We realized pretty quickly, okay, this is not really a skill set. This is very kind of technical skill set. My partner and I, Dan Patterson, we weren't technical. We're still not technical.
00:06:15.296 - 00:06:32.588, Speaker A: And so for us, we were like, okay, this doesn't really suit us. It's still really interesting. We think we're really excited about it. Doesn't really suit our skillset. So what else is there? Got super lucky. My wife, she's been making crypto themed paintings since 2017. And so she got really into NFTs in 2018, 2019.
00:06:32.588 - 00:06:44.628, Speaker A: And, you know, we both bought cryptokitties in 2017. We, like, bred them and stuff. And we thought it was cool. She thought it was way cooler than I did, to be honest. I was like, it's pretty cool, but I don't really see the bigger picture here. But she's like, no, it's amazing. Blah, blah.
00:06:44.628 - 00:07:17.960, Speaker A: And so anyways, when? So my concept of NFTs back then was cryptokitties and art. I was like, those are cool. But they're not really, like, not amazing, right? And it wasn't until she actually convinced me to go to NFT NYC, which is like the, you know, the big conference in New York all about nfTs. This is in February of 2019. Now, I'm still like, you know, I'm primed to look for these different crypto markets, but even then, I still was like, I'm sure I'll go, but it's not that exciting to me. When I walked in there and there was, like, 200, 250 people there, Max. Right? It wasn't that big when I walked in there.
00:07:17.960 - 00:07:34.500, Speaker A: The energy and, like, the vibes, I know it's very. It's not a quantitative feeling. It's just like, kind of, you know, this. This sense that I got and the energy that was in that room, I was like, oh, my God. Wow, something's going on here. It reminded me so much of early bitcoin. Like when you went to early bitcoin meetups and people were like, listen, like, I don't know what.
00:07:34.500 - 00:07:57.264, Speaker A: What this is or kind of like, how blockchain is going to change the world, but we know it's gonna be huge. And so I was talking to everyone at this conference, and I ended up talking to one individual there for, like, four and a half hours. Like, totally. I didn't even see, like, any speakers. I was like, totally in this conversation. And he explained to me, he essentially gave me my thesis. And the Eureka moment for me, which was that NFTs enable property rights on the Internet.
00:07:57.264 - 00:08:22.402, Speaker A: That was, like, the thing for me where I was like, oh, my gosh. The gears were turning. I was like, okay, so what does that mean? What does that mean? And he's like, property rights on the Internet? There's 4.7 billion Internet users now, so that's your total addressable population. That number is increasing every year. If it were a country, it's one of the fastest growing countries, and these people are connected to a global and sensible 24/7 financial system, which is the crypto financial system. So I was like, wow, that's crazy.
00:08:22.402 - 00:08:39.530, Speaker A: Huge population on these seamless financial rails. You can transact with anyone in the world instantaneously. That's appealing. I don't even know. That's a recipe for a huge mark right there. But then the third factor is just nfts, which are digital property rights. Anyone can now create tradable digital goods instantaneously.
00:08:39.530 - 00:09:02.554, Speaker A: All you need is Internet. And I was like, oh, my God. You've made user generated assets. Anyone in the world can create assets, whether it be a piece of art, whether it be a video game item, whether it be a piece of ip, whatever. I was like, this is without a doubt going to be the world's biggest market. In my mind, it was almost the end state of markets. Because you're communicating on the Internet, the communication is instantaneous.
00:09:02.554 - 00:09:29.864, Speaker A: Essentially being able to transact or pay someone in crypto, that's as easy as sending emails. So also kind of speed of light esque. And then you're able to create and create, trade and buy, sell these digital goods that are unique and can represent all sorts of different things. I was blown away. I remember being at the conference and freaking out. I was like, holy shit, this is insane. Basically, I got home and I started researching investing like crazy.
00:09:29.864 - 00:10:05.130, Speaker A: Totally. Like, I couldn't sleep for like two weeks and I, yeah, it was like, this is it. This is exactly what we've been waiting for. I set up Safirmion in September 2019 and operated that with personal capital up until January of last year. Actually, that's when we launched with outside capital. So I really want to build the track record and build the back office because, you know, launching a fun, I mean, you know this, but launching a fund is like, you can be good at investing, but launching a fund is a whole business that is like a huge pain. We wanted to get that underneath our solid foundation before launching without said capital on top that couldn't raise.
00:10:05.130 - 00:10:39.580, Speaker A: So summer 2020 was trying to raise some capital and NFTs were still not cool within the crypto community. And so I was just getting shot down left and right, and I was pitching a lot of crypto ogs because I thought, okay, these people have been in crypto forever. They'll definitely understand me saying, hey, there's this cool asset class. You know, it's called NFTs, blah blah blah. And you're an early bitcoin guy, you get it, right? And those were the people that were often, like, the most harsh. They're like, this is stupid. Like, why would you invest in World of Warcraft items when you could invest in World of Warcraft, the company? I was like, yeah, but like, it was so logically that makes sense.
00:10:39.580 - 00:11:14.924, Speaker A: You're like, okay, well, World of Warcraft, the company is way bigger than the actual economy, but we've never actually experienced the World of Warcraft economy. We've never had the unlocking of that. And in my opinion, if you give people the ability to engage in commerce and it's really through property rights, you give them to say, hey, you guys have rights to buy and sell your own stuff and you guys can figure it out as you want. That is like historically, let's look at an example of that happening. China in 1982. They said, hey, we're going to try out. This capitalism thing looks pretty hot because before that they're communist.
00:11:14.924 - 00:12:14.294, Speaker A: Fast forward 40 years. From 1982 onward, you can look at charts of growth like hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. GDP per capita is risen by multiple xs, and you've had the fastest, most amazing economic growth in the history of mankind. And I really think for me there's a lot of reasons. Capital markets, there's a lot of debt, and there's other reasons, but really the core component of that was giving people a larger portion of people the optionality and the ability to engage in commerce, and that was through properties. For me, I'm like, oh my gosh, the next 40 years of Internet growth, specifically talking about web3 and nfts, is going to make the past 40 years of even tech growth look stagnant by comparison because you're enabling the World of Warcraft, like the company level, but you're also enabling the economic level, the actual economy within world Warcraft to flourish. So anyhow, that's kind of long winded, but yeah, so that's how safer Mehad started, and that was kind of my thought process.
00:12:14.714 - 00:12:20.082, Speaker B: Do you remember who it was at the conference you talked to that kind of sparked this entire journey?
00:12:20.258 - 00:12:34.976, Speaker A: Yes, of course. His name is Jin, or he goes by Bird and his twitter handle is dankvr. I highly suggest you follow him. He's like a metaverse God. And I still don't know his real name. I've been friends with him for a long time. I respect him so much.
00:12:34.976 - 00:13:00.824, Speaker A: I don't know his real name. I don't need to know his real name because we're all kind of living in this metaverse. So I just know that he's a really good guy and he's super mission oriented. He's someone that could go get hired by Facebook, by Google, by all these different places, and he chooses to work on the open metaverse because he's such a die hard. So anyways, he's amazing. He talks about incredible stuff he's working on and building on right now on Twitter. So I highly suggest a follow.
00:13:01.256 - 00:13:20.804, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely up. We have to talk about the metaphors in a bit. But before that, the question that I always throw at my guests who are in the NFT domain is if you could invest in a basket of, say, the best performing NFTs over the next decade, or the basket of the best performing companies related to the metaverse in the next decade? Which do you think perform better?
00:13:21.384 - 00:13:43.780, Speaker A: So next decade. Yeah, so next. And so it's buy and hold. Yeah, yeah. So I would have to go with companies for the next decade, buy and hold. What's really interesting about NFTs directly is that they have venture like returns in condensed timeframes. And the liquidity profile of NFTs is obviously, like way greater than equity or even locked tokens.
00:13:43.780 - 00:13:56.584, Speaker A: So if it was a shorter time period, my answer would likely be different. But, yeah, for ten years, locked up, couldn't do anything. Definitely venture.
00:13:57.354 - 00:14:28.142, Speaker B: That's really interesting because in one of our earlier conversations on the show with Deez Fi, who is influencer on Twitter, I think when we talked about his framework for investing, it really just comes down to who is going to buy my NFT at a higher price. So that struck me more as kind of a shorter term kind of trading strategy versus the conventional venture like buy and hold type of strategy. So I'm really curious, like, do you have a framework for evaluating which of these NFTs is a good ten year type of hold, or is that not the right way to think about NFT investing at all?
00:14:28.318 - 00:14:52.874, Speaker A: So, yeah, no. So going back to what Dee said, I mean, in essence, it's like most publicly traded assets are like that. Like, you don't buy Apple stock, you buy Apple stock with the idea that someone's going to buy that from you at a future date for a higher price. Right. And so I'd say that most public markets have that kind of mentality to them. And it's not necessarily a bad thing. It's just like how efficient markets function.
00:14:52.874 - 00:15:32.924, Speaker A: But I do think that it kind of comes with a bad rap because it's like, oh, you're not long term. And it's like, no, you could be extremely bullish on nfts or certain assets and not have to hold them for ten plus years. So, want to make that quick note? But, yeah, in terms of NFT direct investing, yeah, it depends on which submarket, because right now there's four main submarkets of nfts. You have collectibles, you have art, you have virtual land, you have gaming. And each one of these submarkets, they have different value drivers to them. And so actually, let's back up. So you start with kind of a funnel, and you're really looking at every project, every NFT project with the lens of a venture investor so you're looking at the fundamentals.
00:15:32.924 - 00:16:11.032, Speaker A: Like what always matters is fundamentals. Let's put on that cap and focus on the actual product. So you look at the team, look at the product, the token economics, the community, the market, the data, and just general high level factors like that. And the decision that we always make is, hey, if we would not invest in this project from a venture standpoint, let's just pretend like there was an option to invest in from a venture standpoint, then we would not invest in it from an NFT standpoint, because our strategy is not, we're not traders within the NFT markets. We're kind of buy and hold, but I mean buy and hold in the sense of not ten years out. Like we're looking for like a year, two years, three years plus. And that can change on market conditions.
00:16:11.032 - 00:16:39.338, Speaker A: And it should, just because these are semi liquid assets. So if you think there's a certain bearish event going to happen in the future, you should probably offload. And then if you're still bullish long term, you can re enter that position after. I'd say that it starts with the funnel. Look at the fundamentals, dive a little bit deeper into what specific submarket does that project exist in? So let's say it's a virtual world. So it's a virtual world. It's pretty cool.
00:16:39.338 - 00:17:28.670, Speaker A: And we actually think of virtual worlds more like social networks versus like land, which we can get into later. But the value drivers for virtual land is location, content parameters. So location, are you in Illinois? Middle of nowhere, are you in Manhattan? The content, are you a single family home or a skyscraper? The parameters is like the zoning laws. What is the height, width, length they actually allowed to build on this piece of land? And so it's really about, okay, those are the rough value drivers for virtually and broadly. But every single project, every single NFT project, no matter if it's two virtual worlds or in a very similar or two Pokemon games, are very similar, you have to dive into that specific project, figure out the game economy or game loop, figure out the investable assets within that universe, and then also develop a specific thesis off that project. So let's give the example. Crypto voxels, soumya space.
00:17:28.670 - 00:17:53.854, Speaker A: Crypto voxels is a virtual world. These are both two virtual world platforms. The objective is go there, have fun, socialize, interact, go to conferences, events, whatever. There's not really a set objective, which makes it so much fun. Crypto Voxels is a Minecraft style world where everything's blocky and not a high fidelity VR experience at all. But it's still very fun. And it's geared towards being able to easily create content in world and also geared towards events.
00:17:53.854 - 00:18:47.294, Speaker A: Our investment thesis for that specific world ended up being that, okay, we want to buy land that is near Spahn, which is called. It's called the center neighborhood because all these different neighborhoods. So we want to be near Spahn because Spawn has the most number of visits per parcel. And our thought process was the ability you have the highest potential to generate revenue from your land based off of the rental income that you could achieve from those visits and also from the advertising income. So if you set a virtual billboard that was based off of number of visits per parcel, really. And that investment thesis went like that on Samyan space, which is another virtual world, similar in a lot of sense, where it's relatively easy to build content harder than crypto boxes because it's a really high end experience and whatnot. But the investment thesis there ended up being that we wanted to acquire land that was near the lake.
00:18:47.294 - 00:19:23.762, Speaker A: So there's a big lake, and because it's high fidelity VR and kind of this cooler, you don't have to do VR. You can also use your web browser, but it's just like a higher graphic experience. We wanted land that was on this lake because people love to. There's assets you could buy with our kayaks, and people love to take the kayaks out on the lake and go experience the sunrise, the sunset, and really have that experience with either their friends or by themselves and just kind of chill out. And that was a different use case that was affected by the different assets and the actual environment of that world. Crypto voxels. Yeah, it has sun, but unless they updated it recently, the sun doesn't set.
00:19:23.762 - 00:19:46.996, Speaker A: So it's always kind of like, you know, kind of sunny there, but sunny in space. You know, there's different environments. And also you have the kayaks, which added in a different element because you could actually go in the ocean and, you know, travel around and whatnot. So. So that was about, you know, lakeside land. So it's like center neighborhood based off of unique visits versus lakeside land, because you want to have that full immersive experience. So it's like these are two virtual worlds.
00:19:46.996 - 00:20:08.852, Speaker A: The value drivers are roughly the same, but the actual, when you dive deeper, the investment thesis is totally different. It's really case by case basis. Like axie infinity, for example, pokemon like game, where you're battling each other and other monsters, and you're earning this reward. So in axie, you have five investable assets. You have, I mean, this is right now. I'm sure in the future it's going to be a lot more. But you have SLP, which is a utility token.
00:20:08.852 - 00:20:46.686, Speaker A: You have axs, which is governance. You have items, you have land, you have axies. So you have to dive into this economy, figure out, okay, what is the core game loop here? Based off of that core game loop, we want to look at these investable assets now and figure out what assets will we invest in and why. And for gaming, the value driver is broadly utility. And so the game loop is roughly like, okay, you're supposed to kill, or, sorry, not kill, but you're supposed to battle monsters and you're supposed to win. Therefore you want more powerful monsters, right? So it's like, okay, well, we're going to acquire mystic axies because they have these mystic parts which have a slight advantage of battle or whatever. It's really case by case basis.
00:20:46.686 - 00:21:34.888, Speaker A: And also with gaming, which is really interesting, the meta constantly updates. You have to stay abreast of what's going on from a high level because maybe Aqua is doing really well. But then it turns out on this new patch or new update, Aqua is doing terrible. You have to revamp that investment thesis broadly. So there's a lot of moving parts here, but really it's almost venture like in its approach that you could have two payment companies, but the actual investment thesis could be, there are points that are going to overlap in that vesting thesis, but broadly, the teams are totally different. The product could be totally different and so on and so forth. So, yeah, it's really about distillation from high level into more granular, more granular, more granular until you get to some sort of semblance of, okay, we feel pretty confident we're going to make this an investment for buy and hold long term.
00:21:34.888 - 00:21:45.344, Speaker A: That being said, it's venture like. Like we're not 100% certain. We're like 60, 70, 80% certain that this will play out in a certain time frame. But, you know, it's really up to the mark.
00:21:45.384 - 00:22:18.470, Speaker C: Before I continue, I'd love to share more about our latest sponsor, Coinflex. Now, Coinflex is an exchange that's been around for a while. They're actually doing $1.5 billion in daily trading volume right now. Recently, their team reached out and walked me through their latest product, the AMM plus. In short, it lets anybody earn fees as market makers on the Coinflex exchange simply by depositing their assets as of this recording, the seven day in range average for ETH AMM pool depositors is 82%. So how does this work? If youre familiar with how other amms out there work, this is very similar.
00:22:18.470 - 00:22:46.770, Speaker C: You can basically select what price range to provide liquidity for and the UI even shows you your risk under different scenarios. I also love that they have this cross collateral system so you can market make in any market you want using pretty much any collateral you have. If you know how to manage your risks, you can even access up to ten x leverage while providing liquidity. So this is one of the most creative ways I've seen a company borrow elements from Defi in a centralized exchange setting. So I highly encourage you to check it out@coinflex.com.
00:22:46.922 - 00:23:17.094, Speaker B: Amm yeah, I think that's the clearest framework anyone has ever given on this show. Kind of breaking it down into collectibles, game assets, virtual land cryptography, crypto art, and then going on from there. But I guess from an investment perspective, how do you decide the valuation for these things? Because in the example of, say, bored apes, there is a company behind the bored apes NFTs as well, which is Yugalabs. So how do you decide that? Hey, Yugalabs at this valuation is a better buy than the actual apes themselves versus the other way around.
00:23:18.114 - 00:23:56.300, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really, really good question. So it's not one that I can easily answer just because there's so much. I mean, we'll look at Yuga labs. The fact that bored apes have achieved the success that they have is a surprise to everyone. I mean, I don't think that they even thought that they would be able to reach the floor prices of what they did and the assets would be so successful, so popular and whatnot. And so it depends on from an NFT asset level, it depends oftentimes for NFT assets, we're looking at comparables. So you're looking at the most closely related collection for that because that's a collectible asset.
00:23:56.300 - 00:24:30.396, Speaker A: So we would look at cryptopunks and we'd say, okay, crypto punks are trading at X. So therefore we could see bored apes trading at Y roughly. And we think that they have X much more potential increase in terms of ROI basically going forward. But on the company level, it's like, okay, well, they've achieved this great success. What are they raising at? I think they end up raising at like a 4 billion, I think it was a 4 billion pre or something like that, which is pretty crazy. I think that they ended up earning, I think, $122 million last year. So I kind of get it.
00:24:30.396 - 00:25:11.694, Speaker A: But yeah, there's no answer. I wish I could tell you some formulaic answer or some response, but it's really about, on the venture level, very, very dependent on the situation, the valuation, actually, what they're actually building long term. And then on the asset level, when we're making investment, we're trying to run through the fundamentals and get more granular there. But also looking at comparables. And I think that's one thing that can get me also in trouble, in the sense of before Azuki's doodles and clone X really jumped up. I didn't think that. I thought it was cryptopunks and apes, and they were 60 plus 100 minimum floor price in ETH terms.
00:25:11.694 - 00:25:51.464, Speaker A: And looking at these other collections, I was like, wow, I think they're around five ether, roughly something like that. And there was a period of time where they all just kind of. Those three moved in quick succession, and they broke to, like, broke it. Broke is in, like, my mental framework of like, okay, these collections are high tier, therefore, you know, they're roughly five ether each and whatnot. But no, they went to ten. And then now Izuki's is trading like 26 and Clonex is like 15 and doodles is like 15 or whatever. So comparables is good because we have no other options right now, but it's not great because we're in a world where these assets are new to 99% of people did not know about nfts 15 months ago.
00:25:51.464 - 00:26:21.640, Speaker A: The models that we're building here can be broken quite easily. You have to always be on your toes about what's shifting, where the flow is going, what's the narrative here? And one thing broadly, if you look at nfts, there's two rough types of nfts. There's nfts with some sort of functionality. There's nfts without functionality. Art and collectibles often run into the non functional use cases. And then gaming and virtual land is the more functional side. And with a non functional asset, you could just.
00:26:21.640 - 00:26:41.556, Speaker A: The sky's the limit. I can't tell you that you're a piece of hackathao. Art is not worth a million dollars. It's just like saying your Picasso is not worth a million dollars. Who knows, really, the promises that people. And the promises and the mental models that people are using for non functional assets, it's so hard. It's so hard to value.
00:26:41.556 - 00:27:01.844, Speaker A: It's like valuing art. What's interesting now is on the collectible side. We're seeing the rise of people getting involved with collectibles on the basis of utility. It's like, okay, well, I bought this moonbird. I've bought this whatever asset. What do I get? I spend my money now, I want something in return. And oftentimes we're seeing these metagames evolve.
00:27:01.844 - 00:27:34.934, Speaker A: That's something I'm super excited about. It's basically game experiences that are evolving. Without a game infrastructure, you're not beholden to a certain console. You're not beholden to Xbox or PC or whatever. You don't need to build up this big game infrastructure and whatnot, really. The game is built on these key pieces of nfts, and it's building upon itself within this whole environment. So I'm very biased here, but cyber brokers is a product that my wife actually launched.
00:27:34.934 - 00:28:18.770, Speaker A: And what's so interesting about that is that they're building this metagame in the sense that you have these assets, and the assets are the cyber brokers. They're like these pfps, and you can go participate in quests with them. And the quests, you can actually get rewarded for participating in the quest through, like, they drop, like, mech arms, which are like parts of this big robot that you're going to do stuff with or whatever. So that, to me, is really, really interesting because you don't have to build out all this infrastructure. You have the built in community from day one, who's funding you to essentially build out the further experience for them, which adds more value going forward. And the actual kind of infrastructure you need to build this out is super minimal. And so you have the game engine, which is kind of a blockchain, and it's verifying that, yes, you did do this action.
00:28:18.770 - 00:28:57.806, Speaker A: Therefore, we can reward you with nfts. So it's like this whole, you have a game loop without actually having to build anything. And that, to me was like, oh my gosh, that is insane. Metagames have the potential to expand into I don't even know how big. As big as the Internet, right? And what's really interesting is that, like, it's a whole nother topic, but people are kind of getting really, really involved with these projects from like a personal and emotional level and becoming like, oh, I have the same values as Azuki, or like, I vibe with doodles because of this and whatnot. And I think that's another psychological effect is also something we haven't spoken about. But I think that that's another huge component about nfTs.
00:28:57.806 - 00:29:14.644, Speaker A: Is like the emotional, the social, the status that's involved in these assets. That's really driving a lot of the behavior. So it's like on top of financial incentives and on top of game like incentives, you have these emotional incentives that are like also all combining into these crazy assets that are NFTs and that make the market just so exciting.
00:29:15.384 - 00:29:52.134, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think what is so crazy is that just because something is an NFT doesn't mean that it has anything in similar with the next NFT. Because as you mentioned, there's these collectibles that have no utility at all. And I was always astounded by just how much people are willing to pay for these individual pieces of paintings. They're almost like vegan goods, where the more expensive it is, the more valuable it is, because the more culturally relevant it is. So it kind of just ends in this kind of recursive loop, which I think is really interesting. I guess if you were to only kind of dedicate your attention to one of the four verticals you mentioned, where do you see the most potential for an investor?
00:29:52.994 - 00:30:10.686, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. So very excited about all of them. But I'd say that if I had to choose today, it would be gaming. And there's a few reasons. Number one, there's 2.7 billion gamers worldwide. They are generally more tech focused compared to art or some sort of physical collectors.
00:30:10.686 - 00:30:33.864, Speaker A: And the gaming market is something like $300 billion per year. A lot of gamers are already primed to purchase digital goods from Fortnite and other video games. And that's a big thing with NFTs. You can't just convince people that NFTs are a thing. They themselves have to make the decision that, okay, these digital goods do have value, and it's a big leap for us. It's a no brainer. We've been in crypto forever.
00:30:33.864 - 00:31:24.842, Speaker A: But for a lot of people, it's a big mental barrier to be wasting. Why would I spend $20 on this digital sword? But for Gen Z and millennials, they've been spending money on digital goods before and not even getting any value out of it. Fortnite completes some costs. I'm not getting any money from that purchase. So with NFTs and that population that's primed to like nfTs, I think that's really exciting. Another factor which kind of funny, but gamers like web two gamers hate NFTs right now, which to me is like the best sign ever, because if you look at, like, every single trend within gaming that's become big. Like, gamers have hated that trend initially, whatever it is, like, free to play, just like, you know, battle royale, like all different, you know, I'm blanking right now, but all these different game types or game styles or whatnot, initially, everyone hates it, right? And that's just like the way gamers are.
00:31:24.842 - 00:31:52.778, Speaker A: I don't really know why, but that's just how it is. And so they hate NFts and web3. Gaming is just super exciting to me because that means we're on something big. And yeah, I think that most people don't care about crypto, which I know is sad and something that I didn't realize until like probably 2019. I was like, damn. I don't know if people care about bitcoin and the dollar and monetary systems and even ethereum, which is so cool, where you can build stuff and programmable, blah, blah, blah. Most people don't care.
00:31:52.778 - 00:32:10.778, Speaker A: Most people are just like, I don't really care. I just want to have fun and enjoy my life. And gaming is designed for all types of people to have fun. My mother could play a Farmville game. My sister could play this game. I could play the shooter game, which I love. Within games, there's a game built for everyone.
00:32:10.778 - 00:33:07.096, Speaker A: And I really do think games are going to be the thing that's going to really onboard the masses to crypto, and they're going to get red pilled by accident into understanding kind of the stakes that are broadly on the table with crypto, because maybe they'll be playing Fortnite or playing some centralized game, and maybe they'll get their assets deleted or something like that, or they'll lose access to them or they'll realize, oh, my gosh, I spent $1,000, I got nothing in return. And with nfTs, they're going to be an equal. Right now, we're not there yet, but there's going to be equal experience in terms of the game experience, that fun factor. It's going to be as fun as this, a web two game, but you can spend $1,000 and maybe that value goes up, maybe it goes down, but the fact is you own that. You own that good and that mental leap that people take or that mental kind of that step that people take towards ownership. I think that's a hugely positive thing for the Internet and metaverse broadly, because people say, wow, I have skin in the game. I feel attached to this.
00:33:07.096 - 00:33:21.194, Speaker A: Maybe I can have some status because I am an actual owner. And yeah, I think that psychology around ownership is going to really propel not only gamers but everyone worldwide to be like, wow, okay, digital goods, specifically NFTs do have value. I'm very excited to participate in this economy.
00:33:21.934 - 00:33:45.504, Speaker B: So if, let's say, let's assume that digital ownership, it does enhance gameplay significantly and most gamers in the world do care about. This is the thesis that eventually every single game in the world, or most games in the world will have some NFT elements. Or do you foresee a defi type of situation where you still have very much the traditional kind of banking ecosystem and then you have a completely separate defi thing going on?
00:33:46.644 - 00:34:17.620, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, that's a super good question. So I want to also make a note that like, you know, twelve months ago, most people didn't know about nfTs. Like, most people did not even know what NFT was. And a lot of the games that are being built out, they recently started. And great games take two, you know, 1234 years to actually create. So in terms of where we are on that trend, we're super, super, super early. And so I wouldn't look at what we have today specifically and say, oh my gosh, the games aren't as fun today, therefore they'll never be as fun.
00:34:17.620 - 00:35:03.460, Speaker A: It's like, no, no, these things are evolving. They're evolving very quickly and they will be up to par quite soon. So that's kind of just purely based off the fun factor. So going to your question about will NFTs eat the gaming market like the web two gaming market and will all games utilize NFTs? I think that if you look at everything else being equal, if you had Fortnite web two and Fortnite web3, so they were exactly the same game. One, you could earn and actually potentially earn some value and buy these assets and trade these assets yourself, or you could just spend money on these assets themselves and you wouldn't be able to cost all this being equal, people would prefer to actually, hey, if I'm spending money on this, I want to at least own it. That's kind of number that's just okay, basic. All us being equal, nfts are better.
00:35:03.460 - 00:35:26.068, Speaker A: Let's pretend like the user experience is better and it's frictionless and whatever. So that's kind of there. And when you zoom out, if you look at like, well, I own this water bottle, I own this computer, I own my chair. And if someone came in and like took it from me, I'd be pissed off. And like that, that'd be illegal. Why does that not exist on the Internet. Like I want to be able to own my stuff on the Internet just because I'm spending a lot of time here anyways.
00:35:26.068 - 00:35:52.788, Speaker A: Like, I mean me, I'm kind of a degenerate. I'm spending like 13 hours per day like on my computer. But most people, like Americans, the status, like 7 hours per day, more than 7 hours per day spent online. So it's like through smart tvs, that's through phones, that's through computers. They're already living in the quasi metaverse like this already virtual environments really, it's just not very immersive. But they don't own their stuff there. And I think that there's going to be a period of time where they're like, wait a second, I can't believe we didn't own our stuff inside the digital world.
00:35:52.788 - 00:36:03.824, Speaker A: It makes absolutely no sense. So long winded way to answer your question that I do think long term, all games and all kind of digital platforms broadly will utilize NFTs in some form.
00:36:04.164 - 00:36:48.352, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. And it's interesting you bring up the point about ownership of physical things like a chair and so on, because I think one of the types of NFTs that you didn't mention but you did write about before is things like domain names or insurance or property titles, which are things that I guess already exist in real life outside of the metaverse. But these are things that can easily be tokenized and have a very immediate use case even for die hard defi people who might not get NFT. I think things like insurance and property titles are things that are very easy to convince them about NFTs on. But I like to take a step back because we've talked about the metaverse a few times now in this conversation, but we've never really defined it. And I think for a lot of people, most people have different definitions. Some people think it's a virtual world and it has to be in VR.
00:36:48.352 - 00:36:58.924, Speaker B: It has to simultaneously host like a billion people, just like ready player one. Some people think it's just a game. Some people think maybe it's a virtual ecommerce environment or what is the metaverse to you?
00:36:59.824 - 00:37:23.518, Speaker A: Yeah, I make it super easy. The metaverse is just the Internet with ownership. Like that's it. And you know, there's a lot of going to be a lot of people that have different definitions, as you mentioned, and people are going to say no, but like, how do you easily define the Internet? Like, the Internet is kind of hard to define. It's like, oh, well, it's this, like, network of computers, and everyone's connected and blah, blah, blah. It's like, for me, the metaverse is similar in the sense of connectivity, but it's just the Internet with. With ownership.
00:37:23.518 - 00:37:50.546, Speaker A: And that's kind of what the metaverse is. It just so happens that nfts and crypto and web3, you know, blockchain. Actually, if we're being specific here, blockchain is the best technology that enables that ownership. So, like, maybe in the future, it's not gonna be blockchain. Maybe it'll be, like, distributed ledger. Like, I know that there's a big period of time where, like, distributed ledger, I forgot what it's called, is, like, dags. So there's, like, a dag wave.
00:37:50.546 - 00:38:06.946, Speaker A: So, like, maybe in the future, dags come back and, like, dags are like, the, you know, the best actual form of ownership on the Internet. And then I'll be like, hey, you know what? You know? You know, dags are actually the best way for ownership. Like, that's what it is. The metaverse still exists. It's still about ownership. It just so happens that technology is different. But, no, we'll take a step back.
00:38:06.946 - 00:38:37.722, Speaker A: Like, it turns out blockchain is the best way to have owner ownership on the Internet. Therefore, the metaverse is just the Internet with ownership. And. And web3 is, like, because of that, web3 is an integral part of the metaverse actually coming to fruition. It's actually, like, a requirement. You can't have a metaverse like the Facebook metaverse or, like, you know, who knows what Google metaverse, whatever big corporation that is not going to be the metaverse, that's like, the dystopian reality dystopian. Kind of every book and movie that we've read about the dystopian, this evil organization, like, that is.
00:38:37.722 - 00:38:54.554, Speaker A: That's what that is. And so for us, like, the only way forward in terms of an actual metaverse forming and, you know, yeah. Being something that people want to spend their time, money, and kind of lives in, money is one that enables true ownership. And it just so happens that blockchain is that tool that enables that.
00:38:54.934 - 00:39:29.948, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know if you saw that news about Facebook. I guess now meta trying to charge, I think it was a 40% tax on all 47.5, almost 50% take rate on all transactions happening within the metaverse, which is insane. I think that that kind of calls for the need for an alternative, which is completely open. And I actually did write a thread about this, so maybe our team can link it in the show notes below. But I feel like the fact that social networks are dedicating billions of dollars into developing this means that an open alternative needs to happen. Otherwise we're going to end up with the same situation that we had with web two social networks.
00:39:29.948 - 00:39:32.744, Speaker B: I'm curious if you share that sentiment as well.
00:39:33.604 - 00:39:59.972, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's not that fee is egregious. That's insane. Uh, that being said, like, I mean, if I'm an artist, you know, and I am an artist, like in web3, I can choose whatever secondary I want. I can say I want to do a 90% secondary fee, you know, like, you can do whatever you want. Like, it's what I love is like, you have the choice. And that to me is like, what, what this kind of the metaverse is about. It's like you have the option to participate or you don't have to.
00:39:59.972 - 00:40:28.220, Speaker A: And with the Facebook metaverse, if we're all in there, like, we're going to be forced to do things and forced Kyc and forced this and forced to blah, blah, blah. And I don't like that. I like having the ability to go move to this free area if I want. Or maybe the economic activity in this kind of communist system is also great. Like the Facebook world, I kind of calls a communist. Maybe I want to go work in there for a little bit. But I think just having the optionality is super important for a healthy metaverse to actually form.
00:40:28.220 - 00:40:59.024, Speaker A: Like, if the metaverse is one platform, then it's not the metaverse. That means we've failed, and it's not here. But, yeah. So I would say that it's not necessarily the fee that's the bad thing. It's just that Facebook broadly has been known to lie. Their dear leader, Mark Zuckerberg, is also known to not be super honest at certain points in time, and they've been caught for doing a lot of sketchy stuff. I don't really want that entity or organization or person leading the quote unquote metaverse.
00:40:59.024 - 00:41:12.524, Speaker A: I want someone more like Jin or Bird, as I mentioned before, someone who's mission oriented, who's really focused on making things open, interoperable, and again, having that optionality for people to enter exit whenever they want, wherever they want.
00:41:13.304 - 00:41:51.802, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. And I guess for the metaverse thesis, because right now it does seem like it requires a confluence of quite a few things. For instance, for VR, we have some semblance of product market fit already with technologies like the quest two which actually just got my hands on one. And it's been really fun to play around with it, but the price point is still pretty high in terms of VR hardware. And then in terms of compute power for mmorpgs today, I don't think we can process more than 10,000 people in the same instance. We still have to split them into different silos. So it's not quite ready player one yet, where we have 7 billion people at the same time in one instance.
00:41:51.802 - 00:42:10.414, Speaker B: So does your metaverse thesis require all those other thesis to also play out as well? Or do you see the metaverse thesis potentially playing out without the need for VR taking off, without the need for some massive supercomputer that's able to compute 7 billion users at the same time taking off?
00:42:11.314 - 00:42:55.360, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a really good question. I'm trying to come up with an analogy on the spot here, but I would say that it's almost like the rise of human civilization. So I would say that right when we had, I don't know, apparently human society started in ancient Sumer, which is in Iraq and modern day Iraq essentially. And apparently, I don't know if this is real, but suddenly everyone started farming. So everyone's like, whoa, farming is the shit. Like we're going to start farming with this xx food. We're going to now specialize and I'm going to work on pottery and you're going to work on Spears and we're going to make this great civilization, right? So like that's in the stage where we are when in terms of the metaverse creation, when blockchain was created, it's like, okay, wow, we now have the ability of real ownership on the Internet.
00:42:55.360 - 00:43:12.920, Speaker A: Boom, okay, we just started. Farming is like the equivalent thing. And therefore people can now kind of work on all this other different aspects of quote unquote civilization within that. Because I'd say like bitcoin was like, okay, that's like the farming. Then ethereum was like, I don't know, being able to like make stuff, you know, pottery and whatnot, who knows what. Like, I need to work on this now, Jim. Just coming up with it now.
00:43:12.920 - 00:43:30.490, Speaker A: But I think that's where we are. It's like the seed was planted and now we have a lot of things spawning from bitcoin. That's the origin. And we're still in early civilization. We're not even in the dark ages yet. We're not even in the renaissance or whatever. We still got a lot more to go in terms of the metaverse's.
00:43:30.490 - 00:44:03.556, Speaker A: Evolution. I really think that it goes back to that CB implanted forever, go through bitcoin with blockchain, and now we're seeing just countless things spawn from that and people specialize and people focus on different areas and people building and building. And so it's going to take, it's going to take a long time. Like, I'm very naive and totally incorrect in all my kind of predictions here. I remember in 2017 when we were doing our crypto fund, I was like, oh, my gosh, 2019, like 2020, everyone's going to be using bitcoin. Like, is everyone's going to be using this because now everyone knows about it. No, it's like not how it works.
00:44:03.556 - 00:44:30.276, Speaker A: Right. And then with nfts, I think it was on, I think I forget what podcast I was on, but I was on a podcast in 2020 and I was talking to, I think, oh, it was bankless. And I was talking and they're like, what do you think NFTs are gonna really take off? And I was like, you know, probably like 2024, like, you know, just like. And like, you know, it turned out 2021 was like the year that everyone like, new nfts and went crazy. So I think that these things take time. They're really narrative driven. They're really driven by capital.
00:44:30.276 - 00:44:59.272, Speaker A: They're really driven by talent. They're really driven by people building new things. And I have no idea what way it's going to evolve or how fast, how slow and whatnot. But I do know this is where we are. We're at the start of this entirely new market that didn't exist before, and it's going to really bring billions of people online and cause billions of new small businesses, entrepreneurs and massive, massive value creation. And I want to be a part of that. So that's kind of broadly how I think about it.
00:44:59.272 - 00:45:05.966, Speaker A: But in terms of timing and how and where and why, it's really tough to actually making solid predictions about that.
00:45:06.150 - 00:45:39.032, Speaker B: Yeah, I appreciate that. I think timing specific thesis has always been super hard. But as long as you're directionally correct and betting on the right founders to kind of carry out that vision, I think it all kind of works out in the end. And I know we focus a lot on nfts and metaverse this time, and we didn't really have time to talk about NFT infrastructure. So I definitely did want to make some time to talk about that. So I think in the past twelve months, I've probably seen maybe two dozen NFT lending protocols. And I think you mentioned that in one of your tweets that NFT lending only has 1% penetration of the trading market for nfts.
00:45:39.032 - 00:45:46.044, Speaker B: So I'm curious, like, why do you think that is and what needs to happen for NFT lending to become, say, as big as defi now?
00:45:46.744 - 00:45:59.692, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, this is a great question. Okay. So for NFT lending specifically, the issue right now is the architecture of these platforms, in my opinion. Right? And like, who knows? I could be totally wrong. Probably am. Right.
00:45:59.692 - 00:46:42.244, Speaker A: But so I think that right now, in order to be an effective participant on a platform like NFT fi, which, by the way, is amazing, and arcade, by the way, is also amazing, like, these are incredible platforms run by exceptional founders. But in order to be an active participant there, I, as a user, I need to know the rough, fair value of this board ape, or of this crypto punk, or of this crypto voxel parcel or whatever. And it's really difficult. It's not many people in the world right now have that specific knowledge. In the future, there's going to be tons of people that have that knowledge. And really, really, oh, I know exactly how much this actually costs, blah, blah, blah. But right now, it's very, very small portion of users, right? We're talking about in terms of total number of people that have interacted with Opensea, which is the largest NFT marketplace, 1.5
00:46:42.244 - 00:47:18.180, Speaker A: million total, right? Which is crazy, right? So if you're taking out of that 1.5 million, how many can go to NFT fi, identify assets that they know specifically how much to cost and be willing to lend out that amount of value, or roughly that amount of value. Like, if I look at bored ape, I'm like, okay, that's worth 100 ether. I'll lend them 90 ether for 30 days. Like, that's, that seems fair to me. And I'm taking, like, then you have to take into the volatility of ethereum and like, you know, oh my gosh, like, in 30 days is they're going to go up or down. And so there's just a lot of hurdles right now, but there's a lot of, you know, everyone is working on models to make that process simplified.
00:47:18.180 - 00:47:57.306, Speaker A: And yeah, that stat that I tweeted out, that was actually from podcast that I did with Conor and David from Meta street. And Meta street is this really cool entity. It's a dao. And what they're doing is they're being the most active participants on these lending platforms and protocols. So basically it's like they're acting as like a, it's almost like a, what's a good defi analogy? It's like, it's like yearn, where like, you give them capital in this Dao and they, with their experts and their expertise, they go out and they kind of do the lending for the DAo itself. And so you're just generating that yield from that process. That, to me, is really exciting.
00:47:57.306 - 00:48:36.028, Speaker A: I don't know if that's gonna be the future of how it's gonna go. I still think there's gonna be a lot of room for individual participants that are experts in certain domains just because the market's gonna be so broad. But I do think one thing that David said that was super interesting, he's like, listen, dalls will end up being utilities. So he's like, we are gonna be a utility that is going to be the lender for all these different platforms and protocols. It's like, oh my gosh, it's a good monopoly. I forget how he phrased it, but if it's doing a good function, but it is a monopoly, it's just a very effective, always offer the best rate and blah, blah, blah. That is great for markets.
00:48:36.028 - 00:48:58.214, Speaker A: It is a very efficient way for markets to evolve. When you have this participant or utility, kind of like electricity or whatever, that just provides, providing that liquidity whenever you need it. So anyhow, yeah, to answer your question, that was long winded. But I think that's how the issue with NFT lending platforms today. That being said, everyone's working on, everyone knows those issues and they're all working towards figuring out solutions.
00:48:58.754 - 00:49:26.644, Speaker B: Interesting. So bootstrapping liquidity through daos like meta street, that seems like one of the big trends that not a lot of people are talking about. So I'm super excited to dive into that, actually. We did have Steven, the founder of NFT Fi, or Nifty Fi on the show, and he did reference that these Daos are increasingly generating more volumes for NFT lending. So I'm really interested to see how that goes as well. I think we're coming up on time here, Andrew, so I want to make sure that we have time to plug your social. So we've shared a lot of interesting insights here.
00:49:26.644 - 00:49:31.864, Speaker B: I'm sure there's a lot more that came from. So for people who want to check you out, what are the best channels to do this?
00:49:32.524 - 00:49:48.938, Speaker A: Yeah, thank you. I would say that best channel is Twitter. My Twitter handle is Andrew Steinwald. It's Andrew and then last name, Steinwold. And yeah, you can just follow me there. Dm me and I try to be responsive, but unfortunately sometimes I'm not. But I try to be awesome.
00:49:48.986 - 00:49:51.866, Speaker B: So we'll drop those in the show notes below. And thank you once again for coming on the show.
00:49:51.890 - 00:49:54.074, Speaker A: Andrew thank you so much man. Appreciate it.
