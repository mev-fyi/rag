00:00:04.342 - 00:00:08.714, Speaker B: Podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto.
00:00:17.254 - 00:00:46.376, Speaker C: And before we get started, just a reminder for you guys out there. The Blockcrunch podcast is intended for informational purposes only. Neither the host nor its guests are licensed financial advisors, and nothing discussed should be construed as financial advice. Views held by Blockcrunch's guests are their own, and sponsorship messages do not constitute financial advice or endorsement. With that out of the way, let's jump right in. Now, before we get started with today's episode, I've got some great news for you. Now, a lot of you have been asking for how I analyze projects that I bring on the show.
00:00:46.376 - 00:01:32.210, Speaker C: That's why I decided to create blockchains vip to share with you all the heavy research that goes on behind the scenes. Now, every week or so, our team prepares an in depth research memo with things like sector analysis, technical concepts made simple, in depth competitor breakdown, and even interactive models so you can learn about the most important projects before they become important. And our team is putting in hours every week, scouring discord, twitter, forums and blogs to help you get an edge in crypto and understand the latest projects and themes at the deepest levels. That goes way beyond just an interview. Now, in addition, we'll also host exclusive AMA's with myself to answer any of your questions. So all of these are only available to blockchain's vip subscribers. And the good news is that while our interviews will always be free, the VIP tier costs less than one coffee a day.
00:01:32.210 - 00:01:38.254, Speaker C: So head on over to theBlockcrunch.com VIP or click the link in the show notes below to sign up.
00:01:39.234 - 00:02:14.142, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the BlockCrunch podcast. Now, this week we have a very, very special episode that's, I think, a few years in the making because I've known the guest for a few years throughout his two previous roles. And this guest is AfI Feldman. He's a veteran trader in crypto. So he recently, well, actually not too recently, left block block Tower capital as the head of trading to join a traditional asset manager, Golden Tree, which is almost a $50 billion asset manager, to help with the crypto efforts. Now, since then, he's disclosed an investment into sushi around the time that Sushi announced they elected a new CEO.
00:02:14.142 - 00:02:33.654, Speaker A: And there's a new a few stories around that that we're going to talk about later as well. But I think this is a huge news and really underappreciated how significant it is for an investor of golden trees, pedigree and caliber to not just be dabbling, but actively investing and participating in crypto. So I'm really, really excited to finally have Avi on the show. So welcome to the show, man.
00:02:34.114 - 00:02:43.310, Speaker D: Jason, thanks for having me. You're right, it has been years in the making. I actually, I remember our first phone call when we first got introduced to each other back in 2019 at this point.
00:02:43.462 - 00:02:47.302, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you were at wave, right? At the time.
00:02:47.478 - 00:02:58.074, Speaker D: Yep. Yeah, I guess it was like mid or early 2019. That was such a long time ago. It's crazy how many things have changed. Back then, people didn't even say the word defi.
00:02:58.454 - 00:03:10.884, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty crazy. People were calling it, like, open fi. I guess that's a pretty good segue for you to kind of maybe give us a little background about how you tumbled into this world of institutional finance. Dabbling into crypto or participating actively in crypto.
00:03:11.544 - 00:04:03.952, Speaker D: Yeah, it's really interesting. So, you know, I've only ever really done crypto, so graduated in 2017 from university and then just went into crypto full time as an investor and trader. And so my most recent role was at Block Tower Capital, where I was a copm of the flagship fund alongside Ari Paul. And we ran that fund together for a while, and obviously it was a great and amazing seat. And during that time, the crypto market changed dramatically. So it went from effectively being a backwater that was made fun of by everybody in traditional finance to being a place that everybody in traditional finance was trying to get into and try to understand. I remember back when I first joined Block tower, there was a, there was a phrase that would get thrown around all the time, which was reputational risk.
00:04:03.952 - 00:04:28.822, Speaker D: You don't really hear that anymore. People used to talk about it all the time in 2019 and even 2020. Well, the reason that crypto is not bigger is because there's a lot of reputational risk for investing in crypto. And you sit there and you nod your head and you go, yeah, there is. Because it's, you know, could go to zero. Maybe it does. You don't really hear that as much anymore, right? People are really dedicating resources, really dedicating build outs.
00:04:28.822 - 00:05:25.396, Speaker D: I mean, you see it across traditional financial institutions now where they look at crypto and they realize that, hey, crypto is the future, and we have to figure out some sort of plan to access the market, to trade the market, to understand the market. And so that seat of Block tower was a great seat. Very crypto native. The block tower guys had traditional backgrounds, but then really came into crypto. 2016, 2017 started a great fund, and it was focused on the crypto native aspects of investing and trading over 2021, near the end, you started to see a lot of these big institutions come into the market. People like Tiger, people like d one, people like CO2, I guess a little bit earlier than end of 2021. But you get the point where there were a lot of traditional institutions that were coming in that were really known more for punting tech stocks.
00:05:25.396 - 00:05:58.084, Speaker D: And they just looked at crypto and they said, hey, this is sort of similar, so let me go start investing in here. The wave before that were all the macro funds that bought bitcoin. And so you really had these two sets of participants that have come in. Youve had these macro guys that came in that view bitcoin as a macro asset. Ethereum is potentially a macro asset. And then the tech guys that came in a little bit later, and then you got Goldentree, which is a little bit of an oddball. So Goldentree is distressed debt, credit value deep.
00:05:58.084 - 00:06:33.280, Speaker D: They look at balance sheets, they restructure companies. We really look to do deep, fundamental research on the companies that we invest in on the traditional side. And a lot of the time, if you look at what our holdings are, it's debt, it's not equity. Obviously, we do both, but that's really been the core of it. And so when they called me up and they said, we're starting a crypto business, I almost laughed. It's like, that makes absolutely no sense. Why would you guys be starting a crypto business? What do you know about crypto? And as it turns out, a lot.
00:06:33.280 - 00:07:30.204, Speaker D: So they had actually added bitcoin to their balance sheet on their management company level in 2021 before it ripped and then announced it at the top, which is pretty funny. But they came in early, and there's really one guy that was leading the effort, this guy named Joe Nager, who's my partner in the subsidiary that we spun out, called Golden Chain, which is just focused on crypto. And he's been in crypto longer than I have. He's been in crypto since 2014, started mining bitcoin in his basement. And the guy is just an extremely passionate about the industry across the board, loves it. And so I got on the phone with him, and he explained to me that golden tree was going to do it right. They weren't going to be afraid of the crypto market in a way that I think a lot of traditional institutions are, that we're trading defi we're on all exchanges that you could possibly think of.
00:07:30.204 - 00:08:02.454, Speaker D: We're leading activists plays in things like sushiswap, which if you know the history, that might shock you. Because guess what? There were no vc's in that. It was a pure grassroots crypto native project. You know, we're out there. We're going to be releasing over the, in the next week a 35 page report, a technical report on ZK Rollups. So we're pretty in the weeds now. You know, I think you can almost think of us as a crypto native shop that exists within a traditional umbrella.
00:08:02.454 - 00:08:33.554, Speaker D: And really it comes from the top. It comes from Steve, who's our CIO, looking at crypto and going, hey, this is here. To stay from a value perspective. I actually remember. It's a fun little anecdote. When I was first talking with Steve in the interview, I asked him one question, which was, how do you feel about crypto that goes down 50% but goes down 70%, goes down 90%? He goes, well, I love it. I'm a distressed investor.
00:08:33.554 - 00:09:06.504, Speaker D: If something of value goes down, I like it better, not worse. It's like, okay, it's a good answer, right? That's pretty cool. You don't hear that a lot from people running $50 billion hedge funds, folks. So it's cool to be in this position. I really feel fortunate to be able to lead golden tree on the digital asset side. Crypto side. God, they've got me saying digital assets on the crypto side, really doing crypto native stuff.
00:09:06.504 - 00:09:19.534, Speaker D: The way that I think about it is dragging, not kicking and screaming, actually walking hand in hand with a traditional financial institution into crypto. And that's been, been pretty fun.
00:09:19.914 - 00:10:06.774, Speaker A: I think that's really incredible. And I remember when you first announced that you were joining Golden Tree, a lot of folks in our circles were like, huh? You're the only person going into back in the traditional finance, right? Everyone else is either doing like, prop or joining crypto native firms. And I think actually, in hindsight, this was such a strategic move as well, because it only makes sense if crypto takes off for more institutions, not fewer institutions to come in. And I guess on that note, right? Do you think that as more funds, as more sophisticated funds like Golden Tree comes in, are we going to see a move away from this very retail driven market cycles where it's all narrative driven, a lot of memes into something more kind of serious, maybe something that resembles more like, actually tech equities? And are we going to get consensus around valuation models and stuff like that, or is that still going to, is it still going to be a retail playground?
00:10:07.234 - 00:10:49.880, Speaker D: Oh, I think 100%. It's going to become less retail and the market's going to become a lot smarter. So that was one of the reasons that I, in my head, sitting there thinking, hey, where do I think the market is going to go? Well, the market's probably going to do what every other market in the history of markets has done and become smarter and more efficient over time. And so it's going to become less of an insider's game. And I think crypto has very much so been if you get crypto, then you get crypto, and there's a massive barrier to entry to get in. There's a lot of knowledge that's locked away that you can only get through experience in crypto. I think that's beginning to change.
00:10:49.880 - 00:11:17.124, Speaker D: And realistically, thanks to people like you, I got your Cosmos 2.0 report. That kind of stuff didn't exist two years ago. How are you going to get everything that you needed to know about NASA two years ago? There's high quality research. Now there are people that are willing to share. So the initial barrier to entries becoming lower, the knowledge based barrier to entry is becoming lower. So what that means is that the competition is going to get harder and harder and harder and harder.
00:11:17.124 - 00:12:45.160, Speaker D: What you're going to see is you're going to see what was a crazy retail driven market, still maintain a lot of aspects of that, but just become a little bit more efficient over time. I think you can actually see this if you look at the crypto market and you look at the best performers of the last year and the worst performers over the last year, what assets have been doing a good job with their bd, with actually advancing tech, with attracting users, with scoring partnerships, which ones haven't? How have their valuations changed? If you look at L1 S as an example of this, in 2021, the game was whatever l one was, paying their customer or paying their users the most to come onboard were the ones that would do the best for that moment of time. Over the last year, basically, since that ecosystem fund thing has stopped working and people have stopped being paid to go, move over to l one s. If you rank the l one s in terms of performance, you're actually going to notice that the ones near the top have the most usage over the last year and the ones near the bottom have some of the least. If you look at. I'll give you an example of this on the long side, which is matic has been actually a pretty decent performer over the last ten months relative to the rest of the l one space. And they've done a good job onboarding people and scoring Starbucks and Facebook and all these other guys.
00:12:45.160 - 00:13:35.384, Speaker D: I think what you're seeing is you're seeing a bit of what I call relative value play out in crypto. And that, to me, tells me that people are actually doing their research. They're actually going in there and they're stock picking. And so the ones that people don't want to pick are doing badly, and the ones that people want to pick are doing well. And I think that dynamic is going to persist. I think, almost tautologically, there have to be retail bubbles in crypto just because of the ease of access, the crazy volatility, the crazy leverage, all of that, the ability to go punt 100 x on something that has 100 volts. I think that's always going to draw retail, but I think over time it becomes a little bit more efficient.
00:13:35.384 - 00:14:15.010, Speaker D: I'm speaking the liquid market specifically right now. It becomes a little bit more efficient. One of the reasons that I think you're going to see traditional funds move in is because the barrier to entry is becoming lower and you can take similar skill sets and apply it to crypto. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. And the reason that's not a bad thing is because these systems are built to be resilient. That's the whole point, is that they're built to not be co opted to have some level of resilience against, you know, against corporations. And I think when people think about institutions coming in, sometimes they have that angle.
00:14:15.010 - 00:14:29.882, Speaker D: And I just don't necessarily think that's, that's true. If it was true, then the system wasn't built particularly well in the first place. So, you know, my view on this is it's just going to make the market smarter, and that's the direction that we're going in.
00:14:30.018 - 00:15:07.134, Speaker A: I think this is. This is music to my ears because I think I'm more of a research guy or analyst rather than a trader. Whereas in the past few cycles, there are times when I felt like an idiot when we were building dcfs and trying to model out the valuations for these tokens, and then some random dot coin would just run 100 x and outperform everyone else with no reason. But I think that probably is going away. So I think on that same note, right, in terms of opportunities now we're in a pretty strange time in the market where we have a ton of VC funds. I think in this year alone, we have like 400 VC funds, raise $120 billion pouring into private markets. So my opinion is that I feel like private markets are kind of crowded out.
00:15:07.134 - 00:15:25.754, Speaker A: But at the same time, on the algo trading side, you have sophisticated guys like Citadel. On the farming side, you have like, Alameda. On the directional side, you have you guys coming in. So where is the opportunity now? Where do you see there being a blue ocean in terms of. In terms of investment strategy?
00:15:26.054 - 00:15:55.434, Speaker D: Oh, man, I got to say, I still love the liquid markets. There's so much opportunity, and that's where I focus. That's where Golden Tree is focused right now, although we've done a lot of VC as well. But I think what you'll find is that there are a lot of structural reasons why people went to VC. Namely, it's hard to do liquid. If you're in VC, you don't have to price things. Every day you're in liquid, you do.
00:15:55.434 - 00:16:45.504, Speaker D: That's a very simple example, but honestly, a huge roadblock because people are like, where do I go? How do I price this thing that I bought on uniswap? Right? Like, do I, like, how do I report a nav on this thing? Right? That sounds very simple to people in crypto. Very difficult for traditional institutions and also difficult for hedge funds in general. Like, if you're just a dude that's starting a hedge fund and you want to do that in a professional way, that actually costs you a decent amount of money. So it's like a lot easier to start. It's a lot easier to start a small VC fund and a big VC fund, right? So that's one reason. The other is there are a lot of regulatory issues still for people interacting with tokens. So everybody that interacts with a token that buys something takes on some level of risk that at some point in the future, that thing is deemed a security or whatnot.
00:16:45.504 - 00:17:30.566, Speaker D: And I think there are just different levels of risk tolerance, and there are a lot of institutions and a lot of just general people don't. They don't want to play in the liquid token game because they're like, okay, I just don't want to deal with that. What I'm going to do is I'm either directly just invest in equity, call it such, or we're going to get these safs and then we'll get the tokens. But we're not going to trade them, right? We're not going to actively be trading these things. They were just issued to us, and we'll mark them here and we'll distribute them to our lp's, or maybe we'll sell them eventually on a plan. It's a little bit easier to manage than actively trading. And so I think what you find is that there are just a lot of structural reasons why money has flowed to VC funds.
00:17:30.566 - 00:18:26.618, Speaker D: It's also because allocators, a lot of people, they don't necessarily want to be looking at marks daily or monthly. They also want to invest in the moonshots. And realistically, VC's where you get the moonshots. A lot of people that invest in crypto, they close their eyes and they say, okay, I'm gonna put one of my hundred dollars in here and hopefully it goes to 100, right? That's genuinely how pension funds, endowments, all these guys are investing in crypto, right? It's their moonshot. And that's not a bad thing. You always want moonshots, but if you're gonna be investing in a moonshot, sometimes you wanna invest in VC. With all of that said, because of all of the capital that has just gone to VC, you're seeing some pretty insane valuations, which I think is going to drive down the returns of VC to make liquid funds actually look pretty attractive relative to VC funds at this point.
00:18:26.618 - 00:19:11.290, Speaker D: Because there are things on the liquid market that are trading effectively do the same thing as things in the private market that were trading at much lower valuations. And then the moment the things that are private go live on the liquid markets, they immediately crater to the valuation of the thing thats on the liquid market. You know, there were a lot of rounds that were closed in May of this year, but by the time the token has come out, it's like, well, now it's trading like 90% down already, right? From, from where that. From where that round. Where that round closed. And, you know, I think one thing to remember about crypto is just like almost everything in crypto becomes liquid in like 18 months. So you're going to get, you're going to need to understand how liquid markets work if you're going to be, if you're going to be investing.
00:19:11.290 - 00:19:42.334, Speaker D: So I think there's just been a flood of capital into VC, which to me has made it a lot less attractive. I think somebody told me a funny anecdote, which is this is a fund that was investing in both fintech and crypto. They're like a first time founder in crypto. That is pre product can currently get done at 15 to 20 million a second time founder that was a successful exit in fintech can get done pre product at five to ten.
00:19:42.674 - 00:19:43.690, Speaker A: It's crazy.
00:19:43.842 - 00:19:46.054, Speaker D: And you're like, what? That doesn't make any sense.
00:19:47.074 - 00:20:20.306, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny as well, because I feel like two, three years ago, VC was like the intellectuals game in crypto, whereas liquid markets were seen as just punting and gambling. And VC, you do a lot of research in the tech side, but now I feel like the smart person's game, or at least the fun game, is the liquid markets. There's a lot more intricate pieces you have to understand. You actually need to understand what you're trading as well. Whereas for VC's, it's a lot, it strikes me as a lot of asset gathering people just trying to raise as big funds as possible and just like spray everywhere, which is, well, I'm not.
00:20:20.330 - 00:20:37.694, Speaker D: Here to disparage anybody or say anything, but that's how the normal financial markets work, too. The hedge funds are the ones doing the complicated stuff and the VC's are the ones shaking hands. It's reverting to the natural state of the world.
00:20:38.424 - 00:21:11.264, Speaker A: I like that. I like that. Let's actually zoom in a little bit now, because I've always wanted to talk to you about this, which is your investment strategy, because you've looked at so many markets, you've been part of so many different setups as well, different shops as well. So when you kind of look at the types of bets you make, it seems like you're thinking both in the very short term in terms of trading, but also you do things like sushi, which we'll talk about later, which seems like a more kind of long term or value, or even like a venture type position, but built in a liquid market. So how do you think about, first of all, how do you categorize the different types of bets you make?
00:21:11.424 - 00:21:59.324, Speaker D: Mike? Yeah, so the one thing that I'll say about the trading is that trading often leaves you too short term focused, and you need long term capital, you need long term thinkers, and you need people who are able to invest for the long term in this market for two reasons. One, it's because those are the people that actually drive the market forward, that find the interesting ideas, that bet on teams, that wait three years and support them through. And then, you know, you have, you have great outcomes. Those are the people that are actually driving forward the space. And two is because, you know, I think if you, if you don't invest from a fundamental perspective, you personally are just going to end up losing out. Right? If you're constantly trading. Basically, everybody that I know that's a pure trader, they get, they get destroyed by people that just buy and hold.
00:21:59.324 - 00:22:42.474, Speaker D: And the stuff that they've, like, really, like, really, really believe in, you know, the best people, the most successful people that I've seen. And this is, you know, the strategy that I try to emulate. And this is what I've thought about for a very long time, are the people who can do both, are the people who can do the deep fundamental research, like really find assets that they believe in and basically work to just accumulate those assets over time through active trading. Right. It's like you have these two, you know, and this is just how I personally, personal market, I just, I have these two buckets. I have my fundamental value. This is all the stuff that I've researched that I really believe in, that I'm just going to try to hold for two to three years.
00:22:42.474 - 00:23:16.480, Speaker D: Maybe it's some vc, maybe it's some liquid market. And then I have my trading capital, and there's so many inefficiencies in the market. There's so much crazy stuff that you can do day over day. I mean, like doge, for example, like the moment that it was reported that Elon was going to close, you had to be longer, and it didn't move for like a day. And then it went up 30%. I mean, you know, it went up, went up with ETH a little bit, but then it outperformed a lot more over, like today and yesterday. And you just look at those things and you go, that's just an inefficiency.
00:23:16.480 - 00:24:09.026, Speaker D: That's like a funny one. There are all sorts of other ones that we look at, but then you basically, you trade actively, you manage your exposure. We also trade on a macro basis because golden Tree has pretty strong background in macro trading. We have macro overlays on our portfolios and we say, okay, we want to be lower risk now and higher risk now. And generally, I wouldn't necessarily suggest that everybody do this, but that is an approach, right? You reduce risk when things are frothy and increase risk when things aren't. So, for example, when something like, you know, when a video game is trading at 40 billion, you might want to take some chips off the table. Just, you know, like what you want to do is really actively trade.
00:24:09.026 - 00:24:15.044, Speaker D: Take that p and L, shovel it to long term fundamental positions. Then over time, I think you end up with a better result kind of on both ends.
00:24:20.264 - 00:24:40.352, Speaker B: Hey, guys, I'm really excited to tell you more about one of my favorite products in crypto right now DyDX. This is a team I've known since 2018 and they've built one of the best exchange venues out there that also happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly. Now listen until the end because there's an opportunity for savvy traders out there as well. And here are just a few reasons why I like DyDX over other exchanges.
00:24:40.488 - 00:24:41.808, Speaker C: First, is very liquid.
00:24:41.896 - 00:25:32.652, Speaker B: It processes two to $3 billion every day in volume and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording, which means you can trade things like ethereum, bitcoin, Doge Solana and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today. Second, its also extremely cheap and if youre down bad from the bear market you dont have to worry about gas fees at all because there is no gas fee on starkware L2 where DyDx is built on. That brings me to my next point as well. It's incredibly fast. Unlike other L2 and high speed dexs, you don't actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore. And as an additional point, by using starkware, DYDX also provides users with increased security and privacy. And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature, which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so much different sub accounts.
00:25:32.652 - 00:26:11.374, Speaker B: And their iOS mobile app is also live right now and it's amazing because it's compatible with Metamask, Coinbase wallet, Coin 98, Huawei wallet, and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there. And it's available for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today. And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions, the most recent tier in the $10,000 equity tier, have won over $95,000 in rewards and you can get started with as low as $500 in equity to compete for prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DyDx exchange to learn more. And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:26:13.074 - 00:26:56.894, Speaker A: I do like that mix and I think in reality it's so hard to achieve because the skill sets required for the two and the temperament required for the two are so different for traders. I know they're always looking at, you know, things like open interest, funding raise and all that. They kind of need to have a very disciplined system to trade for the longer term folks, it's more about what new ideas are there, what gaps are there in the market that we need to build and a lot more research into the actual assets that you have to be buying. So I guess when you kind of straddle between the two, how do you pick what inputs to inform, what type of decisions? And I guess let's start with the shorter term trading first. What kind of stuff do you look at in trading that you wouldn't care about in fundamental kind of long term stuff?
00:26:57.504 - 00:27:44.916, Speaker D: It's a lot of the stuff that you mentioned. I mean, it's the open interests, it's the funding rates, it's futures curve, it's option skew. We look at macro data a lot at Golden Tree specifically to help us inform just because the correlation has been so high over the last eight months. We look at technicals in the s and P as well, which by the way, people say, oh, you can't trade the S and P, you can. You just need to know what you're paying attention to. Obviously, it's super difficult, really, really, really tough market. But I mean, there are guys out there that have been calling this year perfectly the entire time, like Michael Hartnett over at bank of America.
00:27:44.916 - 00:28:17.076, Speaker D: All he does all day is he just goes and he looks at how people are positioned and he goes, well, okay, well, because nobody knows what the hell is going on. It's just flows and there are no fundamentals impacting this market. So I'm just going to go up based off positioning. And he's been nailing it all year. I think the equity markets have become very much so, like the crypto markets. Unfortunately, instead of the other way around, you see Amazon selling off 15% or 20% or whatever it was after hours. Snapchat was down like 25% after hours.
00:28:17.076 - 00:28:58.964, Speaker D: Like constant, constant insanity in these markets. What I look at in the crypto markets, really, there's so many different ways to trade short term. You can trade based off of a narrative. And so then you have to assess, well, what makes a narrative strong and what makes a narrative weak. Okay, well, maybe you can look at the number of mentions that it has on Twitter, the number of mentions that it has on Reddit. How is it growing over time? Right. Like one thing that I looked at, for example, was with Reddit NFTs, there was a headline that was, oh, wow, there are only, there are 2.5
00:28:58.964 - 00:29:47.180, Speaker D: million wallets that were activated. There were three or 3000 wallets that were being used and everybody in the comments was going, wow, that sucks. Guess it has no usage, 3000 wallets. And then you go look and you're like, oh, wow, that all happened within the last two weeks. So 2.5 million wallets were created and then a bunch of stuff started actually happening. And then you look at that and you go, okay, well, now I'm starting to see the spark, right? So maybe I should be doing something here, right? So a lot of the narrative stuff, I think, is more qualitative than quantitative, but you can bring in some quantitative inputs and then there's a lot of opportunity just honestly based off of market positioning in crypto, which you can get mostly from OI funding and skews, like what I was talking about.
00:29:47.180 - 00:30:43.184, Speaker D: And then on the rel valve side, on the trading side, I think that there's a tremendous amount of alpha in understanding supply and demand and where it comes from. So, for example, you look at something like an optimism and an axie, and they just had tremendous amounts of supply that was coming online. And so effectively for optimism for a bit there, you have to make the bet that there was $50 million a month of buy pressure coming into. Actually, when it was at two, it was like $200 million of buy pressure coming in a month to keep this thing at $2. You're like, how the heck is that going to happen? Where's $200 million going to come from? That doesn't make any sense. You start to dig into the actual flows and supply and demand of these assets and you go, look, optimism might be great tech, but our job is not to buy great tech. Our job is to buy great tech at great prices.
00:30:43.184 - 00:31:23.864, Speaker D: So that's something that I always keep in the back of my mind is you need to understand where the supply and demand is coming from and figuring out supply unlock schedules, figuring out who's positioned for something, who isn't. So, for example, you look at something like that. If there were $200 million of shorts, well, guess what? You just found your buyers. But there weren't. So there were no buyers. You know, so, you know, it's, it's stuff like that that you have to pay attention to, that you have to look at. And I think, you know, you always have to be very, you always have to be very careful, I'll say, in crypto, because there are a lot of things that can always get you if you're trading actively.
00:31:23.864 - 00:31:43.224, Speaker D: And so I definitely wouldn't suggest, you know, unless you have a team, it's probably hard, unless you're like, scalping intraday and, you know, you see people on Twitter and there are a bunch of successful people out there on Twitter, and I'm not doubting that they're successful, but it's, you know, it's. You got. You got to be really good to be able to do that alone.
00:31:44.004 - 00:32:00.688, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I agree. I think over time is going to get harder and harder as well. Okay, so we mentioned a few things here. So a way to quantify narratives, like number of Reddit mentions. We talked about market structure data like Oi options skew. We talk about supply and demand. So those are things that move markets for the trading side.
00:32:00.688 - 00:32:08.484, Speaker A: Now, on the long term, what actually moves prices in crypto in the long term? Is it development? Is it narratives? Is it memes?
00:32:10.184 - 00:32:48.366, Speaker D: It's a great question. I think I'm kind of going to say this time is different in a sense. If you look at, like, 2017 and 2018, nothing made sense. Things would just pop off of narrative and memes. What people thought was fun and exciting, drones on the blockchain send it up, and then you fast forward to 2020 and you get Defi. Defi does really well, and it gets a bunch of usage, and everybody gets really excited about it. And usage actually goes up through 2021.
00:32:48.366 - 00:33:37.054, Speaker D: And DeFi is in a bear market against ETH for the whole time. What's going on with the large gaps, at least I think what I'm trying to express is that historically, it's really just been about flows and the flavor of the month, because it's been kind of difficult to assign real valuations to things because a lot of the stuff that existed was fairly interchangeable. What do I mean by that? Well, your experience using an avalanche or a matic or a near was only slightly different. It wasn't radically different. It was slightly different. You know, and your experience using a sushiswap or Uniswap in 2021 wasn't radically different. It was slightly different.
00:33:37.054 - 00:34:36.976, Speaker D: And you fast forward to today. I think that products are actually starting to differentiate themselves, which is going to allow smart investors to come in and pick assets that are actually good on a. You know, you assess the team, how competent is the. How competent is the team that's building it? How competent are the developers? How innovative is the protocol? What is the. What is the user experience look like? What is the customer acquisition cost of this thing? Are they getting users because they're paying them? Are they getting users because it's organic? Right. All of the things that you might go and assess a traditional company by, you're going to assess crypto protocols by a slightly different thing is, okay, well, with l one's, what types of projects can they attract? What is a dev tooling around the environment to come on and actually go build it one? L1 might have really great dev tooling where you can go Google, you know, you can go Google something and there's effectively answers for what you're trying to build. Right.
00:34:36.976 - 00:35:04.764, Speaker D: I think that's actually one reason, by the way, why ethereum does so well. Is there a lot of resources? It's like, oh, I'm trying to solve this problem on ethereum. Like, let me go into stack overflow and like find an answer. And you can do that with Ethereum and you can't do that with a lot of others. So, you know, I think that that's, that's a big aspect to it, but people are going to start to, are going to start to develop these frameworks for how to value l one s. And protocols at this point are effectively just companies with tokenized equity. Like, that's kind of what they are.
00:35:04.764 - 00:36:07.846, Speaker D: I think that daos are a very, very powerful tool and they're a very powerful thing. But in my mind, it's just a better version of our current corporate structure. At the end of, like, you can design a better version of our current corporate structure, which means that you're going to evaluate them in similar ways. They're going to be slightly different ways to evaluate a dow versus a company, but realistically, you're going to evaluate them in very similar ways. And so you start to do all these things and you start to realize that because of the increased amount of education, because of the increased amount of smart capital, it's allocating. Like I just said, retail is likely to follow that smart money in a way that they haven't really before. And what it means is that constructed narratives like what you had in 2021, just they're not going to hit the same because you're actually going to be able to see a discrepancy in usage and uptake of these different platforms.
00:36:07.846 - 00:36:29.944, Speaker D: When everything is starting at the same level, it's very easy to construct narratives for each random thing. When things start to really show their true colors, it's a little bit harder to construct narratives. So I think that's what you're going to see moving forward, is it's always going to exist in a market like this, always. But I think you're just going to see less of it.
00:36:30.964 - 00:37:09.764, Speaker A: It always comes back to the point about, I guess, increasing sophistication in the market. And speaking of institutional participation, I'd love to talk about sushi as well, because that is, I think, the first time in history a fund of golden tree size and caliber is actively participating in an asset with, like, no VC's. Just completely community bootstrapped. But before I dive into that, you know, obviously after you guys announced the investment, there was a little bit of a drama that came out with the CEO for sushi who was accused of, let's say, impropriety with a mammal that is not a human. So what exactly happened there? Can you clear the air on that a little bit?
00:37:10.504 - 00:37:56.794, Speaker D: Okay, well, just so you know, the new CEO of Sushi is. His name is Jared Gray. And unfortunately, he shares a name with somebody who does things like that for a living. And so somebody decided to comment on one of the posts. Hey, is this the same Jared gray? I can categorically say no, it is not the same Jared gray, but the thing went viral. Anyway. I actually happen to think this is probably pretty good for sushi because it's, like, so obviously false, but is so obviously hilarious at the same time that it's probably just not, like, good for the asset, because I think that we're going to be able to do some fun stuff, especially around the stable swap that's being launched.
00:37:57.654 - 00:38:21.214, Speaker A: Yeah. And I know you guys proposed a lot of improvements to the protocol. Pretty recently, you guys wrote two proposals on the forum. But zooming out a little bit, like, why did you guys get involved in the first place? How did you get comfortable with. You're taking part in a completely, I guess, community driven project that has no stamp of approval from the big players in VC land.
00:38:21.714 - 00:38:54.770, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, realistically, that's just not something we care about. What we care about, is the team good? Are the engineers good, are the people good, is the product good? And what we realized very quickly, I've been involved in sushi tangentially, at least for basically since the beginning. You know, I was farming it basically, day one. And, you know, I was part of the whole drama. And I've always had a little bit of a soft spot for sushi. You know, watched it over the years. And when I came.
00:38:54.770 - 00:39:32.474, Speaker D: When I came to Golden Tree, one of the things that I learned is that Golden Tree has been extremely successful at restructuring companies. You know, they're there a lot of success stories, and I think we have some of the best minds on the street when it comes to turning around companies that have what I would call good bones, but the leadership isn't quite there. And so we've kind of seen the story play out. And I looked at sushi. One of our analysts, Mark, who's really, really smart, sharp guy, has been talking to the engineering team at sushi for quite some time. Got to know them very well. I got to know them a bit.
00:39:32.474 - 00:40:32.020, Speaker D: You know, we got to really sit down with them and understand where they're. Where they're coming from. What were the problems? Why were products not being released? Why was it, why did there seem to be a little bit of stagnation, infighting, all of that? And we got comfortable with the idea that it was just a lack of leadership at the time and that they really needed a new CEO, you know, and that they really needed, you know, because engineers are just so talented, and a lot of the, you know, a lot of the guys on the BD side were talented, too. You know, it was just, there was a lack of a clear vision for how Sushiswap could compete. And so what we wanted to do is we wanted to come in there and help them with that, right? Because if you look at, you know, if you look at TVL, I think Uniswap has ten x more TVL and is valued at 30 times sushiswap. No, they do, I think, 25 times the volume. But I think that what that told us is that there was room for not just relative growth, but for capturing some market share for away.
00:40:32.020 - 00:41:39.142, Speaker D: And the engineering talent at Sushiswap, we were really impressed by, and we thought that the breadth of things that they were trying to accomplish could lead to some pretty powerful synergies, especially setting up for the next bull market. Basically, if you look at traditional brokerages, traditional exchanges, or places where you buy and sell crypto, right now, I like to say traditional. It's funny and I say that, but, like places like Coinbase and places like FTX and places like Falcon X and Genesis and what are they always. What are they always doing? Well, at some point, they stop competing on price. They're no longer competing on price. What they're competing on are all the auxiliary services that they provide you. Are they giving you margin? Are they, you know, leverage? Are they giving you research? Are they giving you, like, what, what else are they giving you to get you in the door? And I think that's where sushi has a tremendous amount of edge, is to build out a product suite that isn't just an exchange and to basically be the place that people come to when they need to access the crypto markets in the future.
00:41:39.142 - 00:42:00.294, Speaker D: That's going to take a lot of work. There's a lot of work that goes into this before then. But we're confident that there's dedication here, that there's talent here. And now with the new CEO, there's leadership. And we're here to really, we're just here to cheer them on from the sidelines. One thing that I'll emphasize is that we publicly announced it. We bought a position in Sushiswap.
00:42:00.294 - 00:42:13.238, Speaker D: I like sushiswap. I'm not trying to tell Sushiswap what to do. We're just here to give our ideas. We've been around the block. We think we can be helpful. We have a good relationship with the team. I'm just here to provide ideas.
00:42:13.238 - 00:42:36.444, Speaker D: If you look at our proposal, it wasn't actually our post. It wasn't a proposal. It was just a post. It was, hey, here are all of these things that we could do. Why don't we talk about it? And then we propose so many different things. We've got some ideas of what the highest priority is. But I'm not here to force anything down anybody's throat.
00:42:36.444 - 00:42:55.088, Speaker D: I'm here to hear out what the community has to say and make sure that our ideas are not just us telling people what to do, but are debated, discussed. If they're bad, we're told they're bad. If they're good, we're told they're good. And then as a community, we can move forward and actually figure out what the best path forward is.
00:42:55.256 - 00:43:27.664, Speaker A: I'm actually really curious how this differs from a traditional corporate takeover or restructuring process, because with these decentralized networks, obviously you can't come in and take a majority share because everyone will say, wow, it's VZ owned. It's just owned by one person. So you get to preserve that decentralization. And at the same time, you got to contend with every single one. Every single person who holds $2 of sushi is going to have a say on the forum as well. So how do you filter through all that noise? How do you push things through without compromising on, without some of those tools that you would have at your disposal in a traditional takeover?
00:43:28.244 - 00:44:05.168, Speaker D: Stay tuned. I think it's definitely an exercise in consensus building more than it is anything else. And it's also making sure that you understand where everybody's coming from. It's a lot more fucking difficult. Excuse my french. Then the traditional restructure. Because in a traditional restructure, you can just come in and you can say, guess what? Like, we're firing off of you, and we're just gonna, you know, it's like what it, like, okay, well, how can you fire somebody that is not hired? Right? Like, you know, you can't.
00:44:05.168 - 00:44:21.444, Speaker D: There's no, there's no legal structure to say, we are now the owners of this thing. We're the owners of its assets. We're the owners of its iP. We're the owners of it. You can't do that in crypto as really. So, you know, it's, it's that, you know, I think. Let me, let me, let me, let me put it, let me put it like this.
00:44:21.444 - 00:45:10.012, Speaker D: If you could, it would, it would kind of be chaos because there are a lot of turnarounds with good assets out there. So you probably see a lot of VC's try to do that, but you can't. So, you know, it's actually probably a good thing for crypto, at least for the founders. So it's one of those things where it's really just, we establish this position because we have faith in the community. We're not here to try to force anything out because we can't. So the idea in a restructuring in crypto is really twofold. It's good relationships with the key people on the team that are developed because you're just genuinely helpful and you genuinely care.
00:45:10.012 - 00:45:27.788, Speaker D: Right. I think if you come in and you're just like, hey, I'm just here to extract value. Well, that doesn't make sense. And that's why we're doing this with sushi. We're not doing this with anything else because we all have history with sushi. So it's like we actually want this thing to succeed. If you look at.
00:45:27.788 - 00:45:57.624, Speaker D: So it's good relationships, you need that. And then it's consensus building with, you know, the large holders and the smallholders. Right. And it's really debating and being open and taking the time to go. Taking the time to go do that. I think one difference in crypto than traditional is that crypto is a small world, which means that if you do this, everybody notices, everybody pays attention, and everybody cares. It's the best marketing campaign I ever could have run for this thing.
00:45:57.624 - 00:46:06.944, Speaker D: Right. So, like, on one hand, it's harder. On the other hand, there's actually, you know, there's some benefits, too.
00:46:08.364 - 00:46:51.902, Speaker A: I really like that tag. And I remember there were a few attempts at different activist campaigns before. You know, I think Arco was pushing the gnosis campaign just a few years ago, which I thought was a really interesting case study. And I actually thought of, like, doing something in that arena, maybe starting some sort of an activist dial but I just thought, okay, maybe it's a bit too early for this, for the market, but to see you guys come in and do this in a way that doesn't impose yourself onto the project, but kind of attach yourself to the project as a resource, I think that's probably the right way to do it. And I guess it makes sense why Golden Tree has been one of the kind of best restructurers out there. But I think in terms of time, that's pretty much all the time we have. I'm really glad we got to cover all of this and really glad we got to do this, but I feel like there's a lot more that we could discuss.
00:46:51.902 - 00:47:02.514, Speaker A: So maybe we'll do a part two down the road. But for those who want to follow you and follow what's going on with sushi or what you guys are doing on sushi, what should they do? Like, where should they go?
00:47:02.894 - 00:47:09.154, Speaker D: Yeah, just. You can just follow me on Twitter. I'm avifelman. Pretty simple, straightforward. I tweeted out all of our proposals.
