00:00:00.200 - 00:00:41.698, Speaker A: We had thousands of traders using it and the retention was extremely, extremely high. So that's why we knew when we launched a token. Of course, a token can be extremely explosive from a growth perspective, but it doesn't really matter if you don't have something that people are actually going to use. Everyone will try something once, but it's like, well, they actually keep coming back every day. It's incredibly hard to build something where people are coming back every single day, or maybe not just every single day in the first week, but every single day, 30 days later, 60 days later, 90 days later. So for blur, we knew that would happen just because we knew there was a huge unmet need in the product. And we already had tested that out in our private beta.
00:00:41.698 - 00:00:58.394, Speaker A: So, yeah, the token definitely was helpful from like a growth campaign, but you kind of think of it as the equivalent of spending millions of dollars on Facebook ads. Like, anyone can spend millions of dollars on Facebook ads, but ultimately, if you don't have a product that people want to use, that's solving a need for them. They're not going to stick around and that's just going to be money down the drain.
