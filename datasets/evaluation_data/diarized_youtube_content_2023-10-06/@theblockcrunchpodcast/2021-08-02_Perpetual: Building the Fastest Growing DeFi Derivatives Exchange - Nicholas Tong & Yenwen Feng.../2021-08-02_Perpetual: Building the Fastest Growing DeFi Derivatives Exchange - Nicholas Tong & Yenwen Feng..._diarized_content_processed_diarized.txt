00:00:01.000 - 00:00:45.446, Speaker A: Alright, hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrench podcast. Now, perpetual swaps are the most popular financial instrument in all of crypto, and their trading volumes now have exceeded that of spot markets. And they started with Bitmex back in 2016 and now trade over $100 billion daily across all the exchanges. And in the past year, we began to see decentralized versions of perpetual swaps appear in DeFi as well. And one of those projects is Perpetual protocol. Now, just to give you guys a little background, today, perpetual trades over $100 million in volume in a day, according to Dune analytics, and is currently launching a L2 implementation on Arbitrum, as well as pushing out their largest update to date with a lot of new features and a lot of new inspirations that came from the centralized exchange space.
00:00:45.446 - 00:01:06.634, Speaker A: So I'm very, very excited to have Yun Wen and Nick from Perpetual protocol to tell us more about the basics of Perpetual protocol, as well as the specific updates and the trade offs there and where they think the entire space is heading. So for any, anyone who is a user of DeFi or looking to invest in this growing perpetual swaps vertical, this episode is made just for you. So, Nick, Yemen, welcome to the show.
00:01:07.134 - 00:01:08.354, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
00:01:08.854 - 00:01:10.434, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:01:10.974 - 00:01:18.994, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So before we dive into nitty gritty, why don't you guys give us a background about how perp got started? What was the inspiration behind the project?
00:01:20.454 - 00:01:58.658, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, that's. We actually started falling like 2018. I mean, what brought us into crypto is actually cryptokitty. I mean, I used to build games, so, I mean, when I first see crypto, TKI, I'm so attached to it. I think that is the future. But after we digging for a while, we don't really think that the model work. So we actually kind of like trying to find, but we do want to stay in crypto, so we try to find other topics that we can work with at the time.
00:01:58.658 - 00:03:13.744, Speaker C: I think derivative, actually is the area that we have the most interesting. And so we start working on actually an option protocol in 2018, which actually, before people have this DeFi, I mean, Nam, so. But we actually don't really know what we are doing at that time and fail trying to get funding, so we end up joining Binance. We work on the crypto accounting software for a year. And fast forward to 2019. We see the success, actually, the traction of Uniswap and synthetix. Actually, at the time, we know about AAM, but until Uniswap really show us the power that it has, I mean, to the whole crypto or like blockchain system, we really believe that a and m is kind of like, I mean, the thing that move, I mean, defi forward, so we actually drop the crypto accounting software and then, I mean, pivot again to derivative.
00:03:13.744 - 00:03:44.740, Speaker C: So that's actually 2020. And then we went on and then we picked perpetual swap as the financial product that we want to build, am on top of it, and launched a change last year, 2020. And then, yes, the change has been live for like six to seven months. And I think the result is quite. Well, I mean, we have like around like 20 billion trading volume. I mean, totally. I think that's quite.
00:03:44.740 - 00:03:59.108, Speaker C: Well thought is our expectation when we kind of like, decide the project last year. Yeah. Anyway, that's your story. It has been a while. I mean, we've been in crypto for like three or four years.
00:03:59.276 - 00:04:24.214, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's pretty phenomenal growth to go from zero trading volume to 20 billion total trading volume to date. And I think what was really interesting to me when I first saw perpetual was this unique innovation, this model you call a virtual Amm model. So I think a lot of our listeners are aware of what an Amm is. It's the type of algorithm that's used in exchanges like uniswap. But what is a virtual amm? What is the virtual part?
00:04:25.874 - 00:04:27.386, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, sorry.
00:04:27.410 - 00:05:20.748, Speaker C: You go, oh, so, yeah, so the virtual part is that this is actually our unique design. So if you, I mean, you can think of like the virtual AEM is actually two parts, two components there. So we have the first component that we take a cat row and then we actually mint virtual token. So in our system, everything is virtual. So we tagging us cat row, and then you can pick if you want to mint virtual ETH or virtual USB C. If you want to go long, you burn, for example, you put in 100 USDC, you want to go long, two X, and then we meet 200 virtual USB C and then we put that into syk, I mean, model like uniswap V two. And then we can take the virtual ETH out.
00:05:20.748 - 00:05:42.870, Speaker C: And then that's your own position. So everything is virtualized. That's the first part. And the second part is that we have this. We use Uniswap syk in version one as the Python engine, so it actually pies that derivative. So, yeah, so that's the simple explanation for the virtual nick.
00:05:42.902 - 00:05:44.314, Speaker A: Do you have anything to add there?
00:05:44.814 - 00:05:45.430, Speaker C: No, no, no.
00:05:45.462 - 00:05:47.134, Speaker B: That's beautifully summed up.
00:05:47.294 - 00:06:03.264, Speaker A: And in terms of this virtual yemen you mentioned you can min these virtual ETH. So just to clarify, our listeners, how is this different from something, say synthetix, where you can put down your sNX token as collateral, and then you mint these synthetic ETH or other synthetic assets? Is that a similar concept.
00:06:05.364 - 00:06:54.834, Speaker C: On the synthetic part? I think that's similar, but for the python part, it's very different. So synthetics has this very unique model that everyone can mint. I mean, the things they want, but at the same time, kind of like they have this dead pool idea that everyone is kind of tricking against each other. So try to maintain the balance of the debt pool. And for us, we use uniswap, I mean, Xyk model as a pricing engine. So I think that's the mechanism difference. But from the user point of view, trading on synthetic, the good thing is that they don't have slippage.
00:06:54.834 - 00:07:24.772, Speaker C: But. But if you mean if you're putting like SNS. If you. If you're putting SNX and then you meet like, s USD, actually it's not stable. I mean, it actually depends on how others. I mean, things at the time in the dead pool. So it's a very unique way to, I mean, to design your financial instrument.
00:07:24.772 - 00:07:53.204, Speaker C: But for us, I mean, the polls, I mean, of course the polls aside, you trade on that market. I mean, that's very simple. It's just like if you take long, like two x or three x, that's. I mean, the p and L, it's just like what you think. It's not like really trading against other market. But of course the come is that we have slippage, so depends on the order size. You will get slippage.
00:07:56.304 - 00:08:31.496, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. So this sounds like. So for synthetix, just for listeners benefit, when you mint an asset, your exposure actually depends on what others are minting. So if most people in the system has minted ETH, but you minted S USD, then you're basically short. I think we discussed this in one of our previous episodes about synthetix as well. And for perp, it seems like for perpetual protocol, it seems like that's not a problem. But what kind of trade offs are you making in that design? You don't need to take on the risks that liquidity providers may need to take on if they're in synthetics.
00:08:31.496 - 00:08:33.724, Speaker A: But are there other trade offs that you've made?
00:08:36.864 - 00:09:38.822, Speaker B: Yeah, there's one of the trade offs that we've actually is one of the big reasons, I guess, that we wanted to solve in v two is around kind of the long, short open interest skew. So if you think about how the amm kind of functions, in order to move the price of an asset, you have to basically pace a long or a short order. So when we kind of launched the Ethereum market back then, I think it was like 800. Now it's currently like two k or thereabouts. So based on that, in order to get to that price, you'd have to open a lot of long positions. And so in that case, we now have kind of like a skew between the number of longs versus the number of shorts. And so in instances where kind of the funding payment occurs, the insurance fund that we have has to act as a counterparty in the instances where there's kind of imbalances.
00:09:38.822 - 00:10:09.692, Speaker B: And so the insurance fund that we currently have, it either receives funding payments or it pays out funding payments. And so it's a little bit different to kind of your centralized exchange insurance fund where the balance doesn't like, constantly go up and it only kind of goes down in a black swan event, but it kind of goes up and down and it just depends on the market. So that's probably the, the biggest drawback that we found, and we thankfully have solved that in V two before we.
00:10:09.708 - 00:10:50.894, Speaker A: Dive into v two, which I think there are so many interesting developments there. Just to give our listeners a little bit of context here. Zooming out a little bit now, the perpetual swaps vertical is becoming increasingly saturated. There's DydX, there is McDex, there's future swap. There's few other protocols. If someone wants to look at the entire space, the entire defi perpetual swap space, and they want to understand how different products differ from one another, what are the most meaningful vectors of comparison? Is it looking at how the LP pool is constructed or what are the important things that people should know when they decide which protocol I want to go to, to trade or to provide liquidity?
00:10:52.274 - 00:11:37.858, Speaker C: Well, that's a good question. I think we are in the early days. So, I mean, there's like, there's no, like, what matches? Like fix all? I mean, the protocols you mentioned, like UIDX, Mckess, us, or futureswap, we all took kind of like kicks, very different approach. So, like by gds, they are, you know, limit audiobook style, we have this. So on v two, we actually build on uniswap v three and the McGax, they have like, will be signed that the concentrated three key, kind of like a and M and the future swap. The same as I think. Yeah, it's very similar to McGec.
00:11:37.858 - 00:12:09.554, Speaker C: So everyone takes a different approach. So I would say that understanding the mechanism behind, like I said, so I mean some use an some doesn't use and there's definitely trade off. I mean I will not say that twitch one is the best, I would say it's all about trade off. So we have our own trade off. So understand the mechanics and then learn about the trade off and then pick one that you are more comfortable with. I think that's the key I think.
00:12:10.934 - 00:12:32.024, Speaker A: And what are the major trade offs here? So for a trader, if they're looking at hey, should I be executing this trade on DYDx or should I go to perpetual swap, what are the trade offs that they should be aware of besides the design of the protocol, like the limit order books or pool style. Sure, but then in terms of the user related trade offs, what are the most important things that they should know?
00:12:32.804 - 00:13:05.904, Speaker C: Sure. So yeah, so let me compare with Dygx, not Dyx. So like Vietnam, Algebrook and A and M. So I think gaming older book, most market you need to have market maker first. So just like central change. I think this is, I mean this is actually has a long history that how it works. So good thing is that market maker can provide, I mean very good liquidity.
00:13:05.904 - 00:14:20.290, Speaker C: I mean the price is very sensitive. So I mean like this very, I mean I think it's, if you really chase a lot or like if you care about, I mean the price movement, I think that would be the place you should go. But of course the downside is that not all the market, I mean they can attract market maker to trade on those market. So you know there might be market that, you know the trading bargain is really low because not lots of people want to trade and market maker doesn't really work there. If you look at a and M, so there are different kinds of design, but in general I think a and m, there is always a pool that everyone can provide liquidity. So it actually makes it easier to aggregate liquidity on, on any market. So for am design you don't really need to find a market maker first, you can just like, you know, just use this pool and then have everyone deposit and then maybe like do something quickly mining or not.
00:14:20.290 - 00:14:42.984, Speaker C: And then people see the yields, people want to come in. So I think that's much easier to have liquidity. But of course at the same time it's, I mean the price movement, there must be a trade. So I think the price is not so sensitive to the market. Yep. So that's so Nick, did you have agathin to add?
00:14:44.284 - 00:14:47.984, Speaker B: No, I think I was going to say you've covered the major point.
00:14:49.124 - 00:14:50.036, Speaker C: Cool, cool.
00:14:50.180 - 00:15:06.224, Speaker A: So the major trade off is liquidity. So if a market maker shows up on DyDX and generate a lot of liquidity, then users should just go to DyDx and there's no other major vectors of, there's no other major benefits to using maybe a pool model versus a limit order book model.
00:15:09.084 - 00:15:40.764, Speaker B: There are other differences I guess, like if you look at the. And I guess this is kind of interesting insofar the ecosystem that you can kind of build around it. So composability is a massive piece. We can start building different kinds of instruments or things that you normally don't see in centralized exchanges, which I'm not sure potentially you can do in the future, but currently it's a little bit hard. I'd say that would be another reason.
00:15:41.544 - 00:16:10.362, Speaker C: Yes. I want to add on that we get this question often from the users compared to FKx. FKX is so well designed. I mean like it works so well compared to FGX. Why people want to use perpetual swap, I mean, perpetual protocol, I think actually, I mean, so we actually do a lot survey. You know, some of our users, they use both. I mean, definitely use both because I mean, it depends on the market.
00:16:10.362 - 00:16:59.264, Speaker C: But we found that, you know, one group of users that use us mostly, and the group is actually pumping traders. So they are a group of our user, they are very familiar with smart contract architecture. So they know how to build a smart contract or how to build a system on top of Ethereum. It actually makes them feel like home to actually connect to our system. And then they can also connect to uniswap, autopocal, any poker they want. They can build their strategy just like this. For this group of users, they actually don't really look at limit order book or centralized exchange.
00:16:59.264 - 00:17:39.394, Speaker C: They want to use a. And because it's more predictable. Personally, I think actually these are the group of users that we want and then we want to focus on. Because I believe that there will be more, I mean the whole DeFi is actually accessible on the smart contract level. And I believe there will be more engineers or more people who want to learn smart contract programming and try to build their strategy like this. And then because of a possibility that Nick mentioned, they can actually use everything together. So you actually open up the design space.
00:17:39.394 - 00:17:43.894, Speaker C: So yeah, that's just like for comparison.
00:17:45.714 - 00:18:28.054, Speaker A: So it sounds like the composability part is also a major trade off for users not just the fact that it's a limit order book versus amm book. So that's a huge, huge thing that we should definitely dig into. But in terms of the performance of perpetual swaps, perpetual protocol so far, I didn't notice that it seems to be generating a multiple of two to ten x volumes compared to say DyDx or future swap depending on the day. Attracting volumes has always been a challenge for decentralized derivatives. So what were some of the things that perpetual did differently to get to where it is today? And are these mostly based on incentives or do you have sustainable ways to grow that volume over time and continue to dominate the market share?
00:18:29.234 - 00:19:33.560, Speaker B: I guess ill tackle that in two parts. The first part is around kind of our overall ethos and our overall vision. And what we're really trying to do is a, is to kind of give accessibility to kind of financial products that were usually not accessible to kind of retail investors. And then secondly is how do we then simplify these traditionally quite complex products and kind of make them into more understandable and simplified products that, that anyone can use in this kind of permissionless world. So based on that ethos that's driven a lot of the product decisions and the product design that we've done in how we build it, how the UI is laid out, how the small details have gone through and I think that's been a major plus for us. And then the second piece I guess is around attracting users and acquisition itself. I still think DeFi as a whole is still quite early in this sense.
00:19:33.560 - 00:20:33.470, Speaker B: It's not like a web two where you kind of just pay for a bunch of adwords, route them to a landing page and then optimize the funnel. We don't have the well known channels yet, so we've been experimenting on a lot of different strategies. Some of them work, some of them don't work, and the ones that do work we double down on. But I think community has kind of been one of the biggest ones for us. And just kind of word of mouth users come in, they play around with the platform, they like it, they kind of then share it, and then other people come in and so it's kind of like a flywheel effect in that sense. And then once the kind of these retail traders all kind of refer each other, we've started kind of seeing larger players that automatic larger institutions, kind of market makers, they kind of come on and they'll reach out to us and say, hey, we've connected. How do we do XYZ? And because the onboarding process is so easy for them because it's just smart contracts.
00:20:33.470 - 00:20:40.754, Speaker B: They can port over from ethereum super easily. That's also been really easy to onboard these larger players as well.
00:20:42.454 - 00:21:04.274, Speaker A: It sounds like a lot of this is organic growth just from word of mouth and from early users of the project. In terms of the types of users that you see driving the volume right now, is it mostly arbitrageurs as you see on other decentralized exchanges? Or do you see a kind of healthy amount of organic retail guys? Or is it kind of institutions like what type of people are trading on perpetual protocol today?
00:21:06.334 - 00:21:55.912, Speaker C: So we have, like I said, so we actually kind of break it down to three type of users. So the first is like retail users, they trade like several times a week maybe. Okay. So for those users, I think it took probably like ten to 20% of the trading bargain for those users, most of them, I think they scale trade on Xinhai change or maybe like divide ex or like other venue. So I think they just like have like interest in checking perpetual and then they just, I mean, like go to different venues. The second group of traders is like, we'll call this like super traders. So they trade a lot.
00:21:55.912 - 00:22:27.636, Speaker C: I mean, through our UI, they can trade like more than like, you know, maybe like 20 or 30 or like even like 100 trades per day. So those users, I mean, like, they trade more, much more. So they kind of stick with our UI. And I. I personally think that they do run some strategy, maybe a little bit manual, but they have some strategy in mind. So they trade. And the third group actually took the most, like, volume.
00:22:27.636 - 00:23:02.574, Speaker C: So that's like Jason said, that the RB chargers. So RB chargers proven traders. I mean, it's really hard to know because although it's all blockchain, I mean, we don't really know that which venue they are trading on. But, you know, we can see that maybe around like 70% to 80% of trading volume is from them. And most of them then are just go through the APIs or just go through the smart contracts. So that's basically the breakdown.
00:23:04.514 - 00:23:18.136, Speaker A: Yeah, because I did notice a quite profitable arbitrage on perpetual protocol where the funding was negative a lot of the times, but maybe that's giving away too much alpha. But appreciate the color on the different user types there.
00:23:18.240 - 00:23:27.032, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I mean, like, we have been keeping out this alpha for a long time. So right now, I think funking is kind of like, most of the market is positive right now.
00:23:27.208 - 00:23:55.958, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess that is no longer an alpha leak given that it's already out there. Yeah. So I'd love to dive into Curie or version two, which is a new update to perpetual protocol brings in a lot of innovative designs. And my reaction to it when I first saw it was the same reaction I had when I first saw perpetual protocol, which is, wow, this is really interesting. You guys are building something completely new, just like you did with virtual amm. Now with Curie, which is what you decided to name this update.
00:23:55.958 - 00:24:10.334, Speaker A: There's a few different parts, so I'd like to talk about them one by one. The first is the idea of concentrated liquidity, which I thought was really interesting. And it's popularized by uniswap v three. So can you tell us more about what this is and how it works?
00:24:11.154 - 00:25:16.594, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So when Yanwen was kind of explaining before how it works in v one, we currently use the XYK model as our pricing engine with the concentrated liquidity. We're actually replacing that XyK model with the uni V three as like, the pricing engine. And in addition, we're introducing, I guess, a role of a liquidity provider or a market maker, whichever one you want to call it. And this basically allows them, it opens up the design space quite drastically, so they can now figure out a whole bunch of new strategies on how they can market make and how they can kind of create liquidity. The simplest example that I can think of is if you think of an XyK model from, like, an order book and liquidity perspective, it's as though you kind of place equal amounts of liquidity across the entire order book. And so from an efficiency perspective, it's not great.
00:25:16.594 - 00:25:36.484, Speaker B: Versus in uni v three, for example, you can imagine liquidity almost as like a bell curve. And so by design, you're going to get a lot more trading volume if you kind of run the two models together, or you just require a lot less liquidity to get to achieve the same amount of volume.
00:25:38.384 - 00:26:07.064, Speaker A: Are there any trade offs that you guys made when you decided to pivot over to this concentrated liquidity? Because I know one of the early concerns that people had for Uniswap V three when they first announced this model is that, well, it might increase friction for passive LP's, and that you have to actively adjust where you provide liquidity. It might increase impermanent loss for some LP's. Are those similar considerations here for perpetual protocol as well, or what are some of the major trade offs that you guys were kind of evaluating?
00:26:07.964 - 00:26:37.608, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah, I believe. I think it's the same because we're using uni V three. So if you want to, I mean, really like kind of maximize yield, you have to be active. I think that's the case. But at the same time, they are like other teams, like upward partners. They are building kind of like LP strategy vote, like vice, like charm.
00:26:37.608 - 00:27:47.944, Speaker C: So I believe that maybe like in a couple months, I mean, people can provide liquidity to umeb three is actually just depositing your funds to those vaults and then those vaults will compete and then actually will, I mean, there will be kind of like one or two winners and then you actually aggregate most of the liquidity and then you kind of go back to unib two again. Right. But on that part, I think that, yeah, it definitely has lots of possibility to the system, but at the same time, I mean, like other team or other protocol can have work that actually make it simpler. That's definitely one thing. The second thing, the trade off actually, I mean, is we don't have liquidity provider in V one, but we actually introduce the Qi provider or maker in V two. So you kind of change the tokenomic a little bit. And I think that's actually the part that we want to communicate with the community and.
00:27:47.944 - 00:27:58.824, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the community actually, I mean, we got good feedback, so, yeah, so that's, yeah, I think that's good, but that's actually a big change to our assist code.
00:27:59.804 - 00:28:07.864, Speaker A: So can you tell us more about that change, that token economic design? What has changed about that and what improves the token design?
00:28:09.994 - 00:29:47.846, Speaker B: Yeah, the tokenomics is kind of still, I would still say it's a work in progress just because we're not 100% happy with what it is right now. But effectively in the old model, the idea was that the trading fees would be distributed in, I guess, kind of like a 50 50 fashion between the insurance fund as well as stakers. The problem with that was you can imagine the open interest issue that we had before where the insurance fund balance was kind of fluctuating. And what that meant was that the stakers would never really know when they would get paid because the fees would only flow to the stakers at a point in which the insurance fund balance hit a certain threshold. And so now with the two, what we're doing is we're still having the same kind of distribution, but we're going, it's almost like a waterfall method, where the first distribution goes to the insurance fund and the maker, and then once the insurance fund is filled, then it goes and it flows on to the stakers, the main kind of consideration we had for this design was obviously there's a reduced risk from stakers now because previously, and they still are acting as a backstop. But if the balance fluctuates a lot less, a, their risk is kind of reduced quite drastically and kind of b, then their likelihood of kind of earning income or at least regular income certainty kind of goes up as well. So that's kind of the changes so far.
00:29:47.846 - 00:29:59.554, Speaker B: We haven't really decided on what percentage the splits are or if we kind of want to modify the tokenomics even more. And it's still an open discussion, but that's kind of what we have right now.
00:30:00.214 - 00:30:16.674, Speaker A: Yeah, we should probably take a step back here to talk about the insurance fund as well. Nick, I know you described it a little bit, but some listeners may not be familiar with how that ties into the token value accrual. So can you explain how the insurance fund has worked in v. One and how that kind of relates to the token?
00:30:21.254 - 00:31:22.038, Speaker B: Yeah, so in, so basically the insurance fund acts as kind of like a backstop. So in the case where, because we're dealing with leverage, if someone gets, let's say, liquidated, but we didn't liquidate them fast enough, then you create what's kind of known as bad debt. So someone has to basically pay out the bad debt, and in this case, the insurance fund pays out the bad debt. However, if it gets down to a point where the insurance fund basically runs out of funds, we need to figure out a mechanism to basically make hole for the traders that kind of lost money. Right. So to do that, currently we mint perp and we basically sell on the market to kind of then make whole for those funds. So when stakers kind of stake, they currently act as a backstop because they have a cooldown period of seven days until they can unstake.
00:31:22.038 - 00:31:43.064, Speaker B: And so they basically experience kind of a downward pressure of the price. And because they act as a backstop, we then kind of compensate with a percentage of fees. So that's kind of how it works. And it'll be similar in kind of the new model as well, obviously, but the risk you can imagine is reduced quadratically.
00:31:44.364 - 00:32:25.110, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense, and I want to make sure that we have time to touch on the other features of Curie as well. So another feature that I think was pretty exciting is the cross margin idea. And in defi, usually you see that one loan is collateralized by maybe one type of collateral or one basket of collateral, but in centralized exchanges, it's more efficient. Where I can say send bitcoin and ethereum to my FTX account, and both my bitcoin and ethereum spot holdings can be used as collateral for me to go long or short on dozens of different assets, and they will all use this same collateral. So it's much easier to manage. And this idea is called cross margining. And you guys are implementing this in v two.
00:32:25.110 - 00:32:33.394, Speaker A: So can you talk to us about how this is done and does this affect any of the existing process, maybe the way liquidation is done on v one?
00:32:34.214 - 00:33:32.032, Speaker C: Yes. Yeah, of course we, yeah, so cost merchant, like you said, at this hash, we kind of like follow like FKX how FKX designed the course margin and also the nonusd cat row. So I think the design is actually alike. So it definitely changed the liquidation process, I mean, previously, because it's isolated margin. So I mean, the liquid data actually come in and then take a good each market of each trader independently. But right now they only look at the traders, so they have to go through all the, I mean, all the market that the trader have positions and then try to get kind of like the total p and l and then calculate the margin ratio for that account. We also have partial liquidation.
00:33:32.032 - 00:34:23.374, Speaker C: So once margin ratio is below the threshold, then we actually took like, maybe like one fourth of that, liquidate that first, and then bump the margin ratio up a little bit, if, I mean, the margin ratio goes down, and then we will liquidate the rest. So, yeah, so I think the goal is that, you know, like I said, FKX is actually essentially exchange with a really good user experience. That's actually, I think, most of decentralized product. We don't have that yet, so we definitely want to be there. So close margin on USD collateral is kind of like in the middle of that. So, you know, we just want to have everything that centralized exchange provide to the traders that we can have that as well.
00:34:25.194 - 00:34:41.853, Speaker A: That makes sense. And I think one of the major updates to Curie is the implementation of L2. And you guys have chosen to go with arbitrum. So I'm curious, when you were picking arbitrum, did you guys look into other L2 s as well? And what made you decide to go with arbitrum?
00:34:43.113 - 00:35:19.162, Speaker B: I guess the big thing for us is we have a dependency on, I guess, Univ. Three. So wherever they deploy. So for us, it's either kind of arbitrum or optimism in that case. So either one, and I guess the second piece really is around the composability that we touched on previously. So we're in the process of talking to a whole bunch of different projects around how they can utilize perp as kind of like a base layer or another kind of base layer building block in kind of the defi space. And so just being on a blockchain.
00:35:19.162 - 00:35:25.134, Speaker B: Sorry, being on an l two, where everyone else is going, just kind of made sense for us.
00:35:26.524 - 00:35:39.624, Speaker A: That's really interesting because that suggests that there is massive network effects to whichever l two wins. Is that the view there, that wherever uni deploys, a lot of the other defi stuff will deploy? So that's where you guys got to deploy as well.
00:35:41.364 - 00:35:59.448, Speaker C: Yes. The first thing is that we do have a dependency on uni v three. We are not forking the code. We are not building the same features. We actually are using uni v three. So we are depositing virtual token into uni v three. So that's why we have a dependency on uni v three.
00:35:59.448 - 00:36:31.252, Speaker C: So wherever uni v three goes, we will be there. But to be honest, I think that's actually Uniswap took like maybe 60% of all gaxval. A lot of project actually depends on Uniswap. So once uniswap moving to an, their true solution, I think most of the project will follow. Yeah. And, you know, actually everyone benefit if everyone move to, you know, one two solution. So.
00:36:31.388 - 00:37:01.204, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. And I want to kind of zoom out a little bit here to kind of look in the, say, three to five year horizon. Right. So in the future, do you think that we will only have maybe one or maybe three major exchanges the way that centralized exchanges are right now? We have finance, Huawei, Okex taking up most of the volume today? Or do you think it's more of a one kind of one winner takes all thing because of this composability and the network effects that come with the composability?
00:37:04.344 - 00:37:24.984, Speaker B: Personally, I think it'll be the former rather than the latter. I don't think it's a zero sum game. Just if you kind of look at how the centralized exchanges have played out, you may have like maybe three big players, and even then, there's a whole load of long tail kind of players in this space. And I think it'll be something similar.
00:37:27.244 - 00:37:33.180, Speaker C: I want to add on that I actually agree with later. I think there will be like one winner.
00:37:33.292 - 00:37:33.924, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:37:33.964 - 00:37:44.774, Speaker C: I mean, I mean, just like. So just like uniswap right now. So they took like 60% of the trading model. Do you consider they are kind of like one winner? Tesol?
00:37:45.154 - 00:37:48.402, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess they are the de facto market leader. Yeah.
00:37:48.538 - 00:38:06.586, Speaker C: Cool. So I think. I believe it. It will be the same in the future. There will be, like, one in each category. But there is something I want to add is also that I think it will change much faster than before. So what I mean is that, you know, there might be, like, some other.
00:38:06.586 - 00:38:41.710, Speaker C: I mean, so, like, uniswap is so dominated right now, but nobody knows. Like, there might be, like, some new. I mean, maybe new ogres, new model, and, like, something new that happened next year. And then you actually took ogre wagon because, you know, because, like, last year, sushiswap attacked Uniswap. And then we actually kind of, like, found out that actually the liquidity is not a mold. Right. Liquidity actually can just be redirect to another protocol.
00:38:41.710 - 00:38:49.514, Speaker C: So I believe that the cycle would be faster, even though I do believe there is one. Winger wins out.
00:38:50.534 - 00:38:56.714, Speaker A: That's a really interesting viewpoint. And I'm curious, Nick, do you have a response to that, or what are your thoughts on that?
00:38:57.014 - 00:39:39.554, Speaker B: We've debated this a lot. I personally think that the reason why I think there'll be multiple venues is if you look at the centralized exchange land, it's actually in the interest of the large market makers to have fragmented liquidity because that's how they're going to make their money. I think given those vested interests, we will still see something like that. But whether it's 60% is the first market, and then, sorry, the first leader, and then it's like a 20 2020 or whatever it is, or whether it's more distributed like 30, 30 2020 or whatever it is that I'm not sure.
00:39:40.494 - 00:40:21.474, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah, I think that's one of the key questions that all the investors are trying to answer. Which horse should they be backing, and how much network effects can we really expect from Defi? So, yeah, I don't expect us to have a definite answer here, but it's definitely been an interesting debate. Well, guys, this has been super helpful to understand more about the updates in Curie in V two of perpetual protocol, it sounds like people can expect features that they're used to in Uniswap V three, like concentrated liquidity, and also features they're used to in centralized exchanges like FTX. So are there anything else that you guys think would be important to highlight for end users or for newcomers to the community?
00:40:23.304 - 00:40:25.296, Speaker C: There is probably one other point in.
00:40:25.320 - 00:41:10.866, Speaker B: Curie that I think is quite important, which is the concept of private markets. I think most of what we've talked about is centered around centralized exchanges and feature parity. But I think private markets is something which you can't quite achieve in centralized exchanges. The idea of anyone can spin up a new market similar to Uniswap, and so you can suddenly capture the long tail of assets in terms of markets. I think that's also quite a big change that we're planning on pushing in Curie that you will see, I guess, in the defi space. That can't quite happen in the centralized space, most definitely.
00:41:10.930 - 00:41:19.730, Speaker A: And for people who want to keep up to date with these new features and new launches, what are the best channels for them to do this on?
00:41:19.762 - 00:41:30.054, Speaker B: Discord is the best place, and then more information can be found on the website perp fi. But yeah, Discord's where most of the chat happens.
00:41:30.914 - 00:41:42.002, Speaker A: Sounds great. Well, once again, thank you so much, Yun Wen and Nick, for coming onto the show, for explaining to us what perpetual is and what the new updates are. I'm very excited to test out v two. Thanks. Once again, thank you.
00:41:42.178 - 00:41:43.234, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us.
