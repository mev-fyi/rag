00:00:51.160 - 00:01:29.040, Speaker B: Alright, hey everybody, welcome back to another episode. This week we are discussing blockchain space. Now, Blockchain Space is building a platform for guilds and they recently raised a round from Spartan Animoca and have the founders of both Axie Infinity and Yield guild as their advisors as well. So I'm very excited to understand more about how play to earn guilds differentiate how they're going to develop what they do. And also, since I'm personally massively bullish on Asia based ecosystem, we'll also touch on what's happening in the Asia crypto gaming ecosystem as well. So to talk about all this, I'm really excited to join by blockchain Space's founder, Peter. So welcome to the show, Peter.
00:01:29.152 - 00:01:32.320, Speaker D: Thank you very much for having me. Jason. Awesome to be here.
00:01:32.472 - 00:01:38.884, Speaker B: Definitely. Now, just to kind of get us started, can you explain to the listeners what exactly are you working on with the blockchain space?
00:01:39.184 - 00:02:44.044, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. So I have to say that our sales pitch has kind of evolved quite a bit in the last couple of months, and so even myself, I'm a little bit confused. But I think primarily you can see us as kind of three things. So firstly, we're in guild education hub to kind of get people into the space, like get more guilds. And then secondly, we are a tool provider in terms of helping guilds to scale up using automation through ERP solutions, accounting solutions and performance solutions. And then finally, the last is really financial solutions, which is we want to be able to, based on that data, extend financial services that make sense to the guild so that they can actually scale so well. Our tagline is really all about empowering guilds in the open metaverse, and that's really our advocacy.
00:02:44.344 - 00:02:53.054, Speaker B: That's really interesting. And how did you kind of come up with this idea? What were the pain points that you saw when you surveyed this guild ecosystem?
00:02:53.214 - 00:03:47.414, Speaker D: Yeah, so I'd have to say, I mean, it was all quite grassroots, so I actually came from the space myself. I was one of the first Axie scholarship programs in the world, kind of like watching the other pioneers, how they did it. So I think I was within the top ten, like, first ones. That kind of started up last year, around September in 2020. I've actually been in the Axie ecosystem since 2018, since I met Jiho and Gabby back in the Philippines meetup. So I actually have a co working space where we used to host a lot of meetups, and Gabby actually invited Axie Infinity to our space, where we actually hosted the first ever Axie meetup in the Philippines. So that's one of those proud moments we can reflect on.
00:03:47.414 - 00:04:09.226, Speaker D: And because I was following Axie so intently over the years, and I have to say, like, I'm not a huge gamer myself, so a lot of, like, the game mechanics and, like, the, you know, understanding cards within the game, you know, didn't make a lot of sense to me, or maybe I didn't study it well enough.
00:04:09.370 - 00:04:09.722, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:09.778 - 00:05:12.384, Speaker D: And. But I did kind of followed, like, kind of as soon as there was kind of, like, a business model, and I saw people kind of with their assets, starting to loan those out and actually start to get side income. That's the part that really piqued my interest as a crypto educator in the Philippines for about three years now. So since 2018, I've been extending my co working space for blockchain meetups. And that's how the whole crypto community, um, in the Philippines know each other is, uh, really through kind of networking and having beers and pizza together. And, um, I was basically, uh, always advocating, you know, adoption of this technology to kind of new people, um, and. And we would kind of do road shows and, uh, meet, you know, uh, kind of communities within schools or within other kind of communities, within communities, like, so whether.
00:05:12.384 - 00:06:39.406, Speaker D: Whether they're clubs or societies, you know, we would go and speak and, like, educate people. And when the axie scholarship model came out, you know, it was the first time I actually felt confident that without actually having to persuade them to use the technology, set up wallets, learn how to kind of make exchange trades, right. That they actually wanted to get into the system and learn about the technology through different means. So basically what happened with acne scholarships is people who understood the business model really well. It was something that was really simple that I guess related to your average person, which was if you have ten game accounts, then you can loan those out to your friends, and then at the end of the month, we will cut the earnings into commission splits that are basically agreeable to the owner and the lender. And that was really, really simple for some reason, I guess, in the Philippines, that a lot of this kind of loaning system already exists as well. And then what I saw was basically a proliferation of these axie scholarships within my own social circles.
00:06:39.406 - 00:06:53.302, Speaker D: And then from then, I kind of got really bullish, knew that these axie scholarships are going to be for the non crypto natives and probably for the mass people.
00:06:53.438 - 00:07:23.552, Speaker B: Yeah. And you're based in the Philippines, which is obviously in the epicenter of, or one of the epicenters for this entire new play to earn ecosystem or this phenomenon. So I'm curious, you know, in terms of how big this opportunity is and in terms of how big the opportunity space for guilds is, how do you kind of reason about that? Because my understanding is most of the guilds right now are still mostly servicing axie infinity. You know, a lot of the play to earn ecosystem still revolves around the one game, you know, what other developments are you seeing out there?
00:07:23.688 - 00:08:10.524, Speaker D: Yeah, so, I mean, like, I just for Axie alone, actually, I see so much growth potential already. So if you actually have a look at our guild insights report, which is actually live in our git book right now. So you go to blockchainspace gitbook IO, you can actually see that we, we monitor 2700 guilds around the world right now. And that you can see the average guild is actually very small. So in terms of community members, the average guild in the world has around 380 members in their discord. And then in terms of, like, how many scholar accounts, they have only around eight scholars within their program, meaning that the average guild is actually only a micro scholarship. Right.
00:08:10.524 - 00:08:27.052, Speaker D: It only has eight accounts that they're managing. And so I see this growth basically driven by your average kind of like entrepreneur, someone with, you know, a disposable cash of like between like five to $10,000.
00:08:27.188 - 00:08:27.580, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:27.652 - 00:09:47.324, Speaker D: Which is kind of like within reason, well within reach, I guess, of like a lot of people. And so, yeah, these micro entrepreneurs are just kind of proliferating just because of it. I guess the investment size is actually not too big of a hurdle. And I actually see like within the axie ecosystem itself that, you know, we're starting to see network effects. So if you think about it, you know, if, let's say myself, if I tell three people about Axie scholarships and now today you have around 3000 guilds around the world that are talking about Axie scholarships and they tell three people starting to get these network effects where each one tells three people and then these guilds just stop popping up like all around the place. So actually I see like a lot of growth for Axie just coming from the micro guilds that might be in the space from the other games. It's hard to say right now because I know a lot of guilds are trying out different games, but there is not a single game, I would say, that has kind of like dominated the guild space yet.
00:09:47.324 - 00:10:53.418, Speaker D: I think everyone's trying to in terms of penetration of guilds, but I'm sure no one has that one central database which tells you, oh, here are all the 3000 guilds around the world other than us right now. So, you know, there is, yeah, there is a lot of value in being able to identify who those guilds are. And guilds are basically the best friends of all those NFT games that are coming up. They of course, like, we are pretty much the target market for all of these games. And you can be very specific now and say, like looking at our own reports, you know, you can pick regions where you want to be able to identify guilds. So whether it's in, in the US, Asia, South America, Africa or Southeast Asia, you can actually identify which guilds you want to work with. And so I see that this is going to be an essential part for growth of these new NFT games coming up.
00:10:53.506 - 00:11:13.656, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting that you say that there hasn't been a single game that really penetrated all the guilds because my impression was always that Axie Infinity is kind of the game that every guild is servicing, if not the only game that some guilds are servicing. Is that perspective wrong? Are there like new games that are on the horizon or that are live already that maybe I'm missing?
00:11:13.760 - 00:12:28.372, Speaker D: No, I completely agree with that. I think the whole reason guilds even exist right now is because of Axie and for sure as a wild guess at this stage because we don't have the exact number. But I mean, all the guilds that we monitor, we monitor them because they play Axie, right? So we need that number for all the non Axie guilds out there, there probably are some, we know that some people have contacted us. It's telling us, like, they only focus on Salala based games or they might be only focusing on, like, some kind of other NFT projects. So, but I would say the majority of them are kind of not very mature yet, like, as in, like, very well established, you know, and they're probably very few. Now, the reason for this is quite simply, you know, the axie scholarship business model is kind of tried and proven, you know, and so it's kind of like been battle tested for a while now. So there's, you know, there's proof that you can actually get RoI from, from running an Axie scholarship today.
00:12:28.548 - 00:12:45.892, Speaker B: Yeah. And let's take a step back and talk about guilds as a concept. And for listeners who are interested, you can check out our YGG episode where we talk to Gabby from Yode Guild games. And we're going to go deeper into this. But just to give some context here, where did the idea of guilds come from and what do they actually do?
00:12:46.028 - 00:13:22.314, Speaker D: So my reference that I always like to think about, actually, is I actually go to Wikipedia and I am, I had to look, and I even shared this with my own investors, is I think I basically researched what is a guild, and then it goes back to artisanal days and about how guilds used to get together as informal parties to aggregate feedback and collaborate together to be able to, you know, create change and propose change to governments.
00:13:22.434 - 00:13:22.930, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:23.042 - 00:13:44.034, Speaker D: And so I think that's kind of a part of where these guilds are coming from. Because right now, actually, if you have a look at the axie scholarship model, the fact that so many people came into these axie scholarships, but then at the same time, Axie actually doesn't endorse the scholarship model itself.
00:13:44.194 - 00:13:44.894, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:45.194 - 00:14:01.092, Speaker D: I think for various different reasons. Like, it's not that they don't realize the growth is coming from guilt. It's rather that, you know, if it becomes an official part of their business, then, you know, it's a lot. It's, it's quite a lot for them to handle.
00:14:01.228 - 00:14:01.572, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:01.628 - 00:14:47.870, Speaker D: So what's happening is that a lot of self organization is happening in the guild space where people like, this is a great business model. But you know what? There is a complete lack of kind of, like, feedback that we can actually provide. And so people were kind of collaborating and getting together and discussing, these are my concerns. Like, what about you? And then people would share tools with each other and. Yeah, and every time there is a game mechanic change these guild owners would get together and kind of like, try and of through a community spirit, you know, uh, get together and see, um, how to kind of deal with changes.
00:14:48.022 - 00:14:48.358, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:48.406 - 00:14:57.630, Speaker D: And I think that's because, uh, that, that part of that market is just not catered to in the actual axie platform itself yet.
00:14:57.782 - 00:14:58.238, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:58.326 - 00:15:02.054, Speaker D: Um, on the other side, like, why do these guilds actually exist?
00:15:02.214 - 00:15:02.558, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:02.606 - 00:15:44.104, Speaker D: So, uh, you, you know, what, what we're seeing right now is like, you know, ultimately, I like to define at its simplest form, a guild as a community. And this particular guild is focused on play to earn games. So these are play to earn guilds. And these communities are basically all pretty much gamers. So the way I see it is they are groups. Guilds are groups of gamers that are in a specific community. And that specific community could be anywhere in the world or any locality.
00:15:44.104 - 00:16:04.394, Speaker D: And basically these communities can be mobilized. So you'll have a guild head which basically says, hey, guys, this is the mission of our guild. If you align with this mission, then we can achieve these goals together.
00:16:04.514 - 00:16:04.794, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:04.834 - 00:16:06.974, Speaker D: And that's kind of how you build that community.
00:16:07.274 - 00:16:42.922, Speaker B: Absolutely. And now most guilds revolve around axies play to earn system, the scholarship model, where basically you need to have some upfront cost in order to play the Axie game, where you need to buy the axie nfts. And many people aren't able to afford this. And that's why guilds exists, to kind of lend them these NFT assets so that they can start playing. But this scholarship model, as you mentioned, is not necessarily something that every play to earn game out there adopts. So how do you see guilds evolving to accommodate a wider variety of games? Yeah.
00:16:42.978 - 00:16:56.418, Speaker D: So that's why I always like to talk about guilds as opposed to, you know, just axie scholarships, because Axie scholarships is just one business model that guilds are adopting right now just for Axie, the game.
00:16:56.586 - 00:16:57.294, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:57.834 - 00:17:17.277, Speaker D: It was actually, I guess the, even the term scholarships came from, you know, the ability basically to be able to fund someone else. The idea was like, you know, you like, just like a scholar in education, you could fund someone else and basically pay it forward.
00:17:17.365 - 00:17:17.829, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:17.941 - 00:18:26.500, Speaker D: To allow someone to have another opportunity without having for them to have to put any money down. Now, I think that same ethos is going to happen where, you know, there are basically guild owners or let's say communities where people have their own NFT assets and they want to pay it forward to the larger community, like people, especially in developing countries, which are less fortunate circumstances, and they want to be able to give that opportunity for people they want to put in the time to basically be able to earn using those in game economies. So the way I see it is like, there are going to be many business models popping up, even within Axie itself. So the Axie scholarship program, I think, is very specific to the loaning of axies to people who want to play with those axies to play PvE and PvP. But even when Lan play comes out, it's going to be a different model.
00:18:26.642 - 00:18:26.944, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:26.984 - 00:19:13.174, Speaker D: So you. You've got land. You'll have Axie landowners, and they will basically want to. We don't know the exact mechanics yet, but I assume they will want to rent out their land like a landlord, right, and allow other people basically to build on top of it and to basically collect, like, taxes, you know, from basically anyone that's building on the land, just like in real life. So I can definitely see that as one business model that may evolve out of this space. The same comes with the games, like the sandbox, for instance, where the primary focus right now is on land ownership. There's 300,000 land plots in the sandbox metaverse.
00:19:13.174 - 00:20:00.150, Speaker D: Each of these landowners basically want to be able to monetize their land in the future. And this land is becoming very, very valuable. It's done multiple xs, like, in the last year, and people kind of, like, see the opportunity that just, like in, let's say, in Roblox, right, which is non crypto, you know, you can have basically lots of different game experiences that are built. And they call the. In Roblox, it's like, it's called a different server, but in the sandbox, each land basically will represent a different server. And so you basically go to each land for a different experience. And, of course, some landowners, they probably won't want to monetize at all.
00:20:00.150 - 00:20:22.530, Speaker D: They just want to give a free experience. But some will want to provide entertainment value or will 100% want to monetize. And you see even those big, big name companies, like traditional companies like Adidas, now coming into the sandbox metaverse with, you know, big plans to be able to monetize there, too.
00:20:22.642 - 00:21:18.160, Speaker A: Now, before I continue, I'd love to share one of my favorite products in crypto with you. Now, whenever I want to trade a token, instead of going to uniswap sushiswap Bancorp one by one to see where I can find the best quote, I just go to Paraswap to scan for the best price anywhere, because Paraswap aggregates all the popular Ethereum dexs and saves me a ton of time and headache in finding where I can trade something for the best price and lets me trade in one place. Now the cool thing is theyve also integrated with ledger live as well, meaning I can now swap at the best prices directly from my ledger wallet. So seriously, if you are a defi trader and youre worried about the security risks of centralized exchanges, but you also dont want to scour dozens of dexs just to find the best price, you have to check out Paraswap. So head on over to Paraswap IO blockcrunch. I'd also love to take a moment to talk about the Hbar foundation. Now if you approached me one to two years ago, I would tell you I'm really skeptical of layer one systems outside of Ethereum.
00:21:18.160 - 00:22:04.156, Speaker A: But in the past twelve months I started to notice billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of users flocking to new blockchains left and right. And then I realized there's an actual market gap being filled and I always love to support projects who support builders, and one of those projects is Hedera Hashgraph. Hedera is an enterprise grade public network with its own crypto asset called HBAR, and the HbAR foundation has launched with an initial budget of over $2 billion to provide entrepreneurs with the funding and ecosystem support needed to quickly build and deploy new applications on the Hedera Hashgraph network. The HbAR foundation is eager to find builders in deFi, nfts, gaming, sustainability and all sectors. So if you are a builder, a developer or creator with an idea, visit hbarfoundation.org to learn more.
00:22:04.300 - 00:22:47.914, Speaker C: I'd love to talk a little bit about notional if you've followed the show for long enough, you know I'm pretty excited about fixed rate products. Notional finance is the leading fixed rate borrowing and lending protocol, and they've just released a major upgrade. With notional, you can not only borrow and lend at fixed rates for up to one year now, but liquidity providers also have a pretty good opportunity. Thanks to an integration with compound and a liquidity mining program, LP's can actually earn interest, liquidity fees and token liquidity mining incentives as well. We've talked with Teddy from Notional recently, and as a happy investor as well, I've been pretty impressed with how the team is building this critical infrastructure that will help onboard the next billion users to DeFi. So you can check it out today at Notional Finance blockcrunch.
00:22:48.034 - 00:23:18.820, Speaker B: That's really interesting, and I guess that ties into my other question, which is for the investors out there or even for yourself, right. Before you start a blockchain space, what beliefs do you need to hold in order to think that this guild opportunity is a big one? Do you have to believe that 90% of the games are going to take place in the Metaverse? There's going to be a massive wave of play to earn games or what were the core tenets that you need to abide by in order to really buy into this guild thesis?
00:23:18.962 - 00:23:34.096, Speaker D: Yeah, so, I mean, gosh, that is a great question. So, I mean, I guess there's a lot of people that have kind of started in the NFT space, right. That did very well.
00:23:34.200 - 00:23:34.512, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:34.568 - 00:24:32.284, Speaker D: And, you know, they've accumulated, they're so bullish already in nfts from an early stage that, you know, I guess that might be one of the very first core tenets, right. Is if you believe in nfts, then you'll believe in yield bearing nfts, right. And so this is a chance for you to basically yield bear on, on those NFT assets, right. And so a lot of these axie owners, they got into Axie very, very early on, and what attracted them most was not just, you know, the graphics and the team and so on, but the fact that, you know, these are single, unique digital assets, right. And that, you know, you can trade them, they actually lock in real value. Right, in this economy. And that, you know, they're bullish on the fact that these nfts will retain value or even appreciate in value over time.
00:24:32.284 - 00:25:09.504, Speaker D: Right. And so this is one part that I absolutely love about axie. And I guess, like, not enough people talk about it. So I think Axie only created something like the first 10,000 axies in the whole game. Correct me if I'm wrong, that number might be incorrect, but the principle is correct. So basically they only created the first axes and then they did not print any more of the game characters after that. And then basically all the axes that people are playing with today are actually created by the community.
00:25:09.504 - 00:25:17.864, Speaker D: So this is a very much community driven, community owned game, an ecosystem, an economy.
00:25:18.244 - 00:25:18.652, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:18.708 - 00:25:55.728, Speaker D: It's, I've never seen anything quite like it. That's it. It's really breathtaking and mind blowing. The fact that what they did is they kind of like, turned game ownership on its head and said, so where you had, like, owners of, like, the game, like Fortnite, you know, where the game developer just brings out unlimited assets in the game, but ultimately they own everything and anything inside their game. Economy is owned by them as well. And then all you're doing is basically pouring in money into buying new skins. In this case it's the opposite.
00:25:55.728 - 00:26:58.210, Speaker D: They've said, look guys, we're going to just give you the template for how to create the in game assets, but you guys are going to be the ones to create the assets yourself through a mechanism called breeding. And so, you know, the community got together and basically bred all these axes. So if we have 3 million players today and it's, you know, at least three axies per an account, we've got at least 9 million axies out there that have been created. Now just think about that. If Axie only created the first 10,000, how many were created by the community is just absolutely mind blowing. And so this is where I see kind of like the core value being from is this community ownership, right? That, you know, the community basically is massively bullish in nfts. And then, you know, they not only this, they've seen like game development being spun on its head and then they feel like they own the game.
00:26:58.210 - 00:27:01.930, Speaker D: The community owns the game. It's not axie that owns the game.
00:27:02.002 - 00:27:25.508, Speaker B: Absolutely. That's an incredibly powerful idea. And I know a lot of gamers and investors alike are really captivated by this new paradigm. And I'm curious, Peter, you mentioned that there's 2700 guilds, which is a crazy number, especially given how nascent this space is. So based on what you're seeing so far, what are the main ways that guilds differentiate from one another? What can a guild do to stand out from the crowd?
00:27:25.636 - 00:27:53.440, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a great question as well. Of course you've got your really large, I call them macro guilds. It's a really boring term. And then you've got micro guilds. So macro guilds being the ones like Ygg, merit circle, Unix gaming, avocado guilds. These guys are kind of playing the bigger picture. You know, they are trying to be like absolutely massive.
00:27:53.440 - 00:28:47.796, Speaker D: They have a very different strategy, right, in terms of like a mona, like monetary policy or you know how investment thesis. So a lot of these guys try to get into safs, right? They go into like they'll speak to NFT games and as they're in development and they'll try and get into private sales and try and make money through that. Or they will aggregates nfts into their treasury so that their treasury becomes more valuable over time by accumulating assets. So that's a lot of the primary focus of these macro guilds. And they're not so focused on the revenue that's being driven from the actual scholarship programs themselves. That might be the smaller part of, you know, their revenue it stream. Now, when you look at like micro guilds, it's the opposite.
00:28:47.796 - 00:29:10.068, Speaker D: For micro guilds, it's your, your lifeline is basically your scholars, right. The accounts and their performance. Right. And it's not about, I mean, yes, you invested in the nfts, but you only invested in eight. Eight accounts, right. So it's not a huge number of nfts. And so like, you know, even if it does go up, it doesn't.
00:29:10.068 - 00:30:02.274, Speaker D: It might not be as much as the value that you're getting out from basically farming this yield from the SLP token in Axie, for instance. So for them, the focus is very much on maintaining and managing those accounts. How do they differentiate? So lots of different unique ways, I guess. I've seen celebrities start up guilds where it's just pure fandom for celebrities. So if you want to be a part of the celebrities community, then you would join that guild. I've seen guilds that 100% just focus on empowering local communities. So it's focused on a specific geography.
00:30:02.274 - 00:30:55.494, Speaker D: So because there are so many people trying to get in this space and there's actually, the account creation process is actually too slow. There's a lot of people in the backlog right now. And so a lot of people tend to filter their onboarding process to something that's meaningful to them. And what we're seeing is just like I said earlier, how micro guilds are very individual and personal. You start to see these micro guilds focusing on personal advocacy or local communities, something that's relatable to them. So an idea is like, you know, in the Philippines alone, I think there's probably over a thousand guilds. And some of them just focus literally on their own, what we call like a barangay, which is like a local town or council.
00:30:55.494 - 00:31:09.468, Speaker D: And it might only be like a thousand people, but that's enough because they can't cater to more than 1000 people anyway. So you might see like hyper localization happening right now.
00:31:09.556 - 00:31:26.036, Speaker B: Thank you for that. And I guess in terms of the guilds that you work with, earlier you mentioned that you provide data and also financing for a lot of the guilds through blockchain space. Can you talk a little bit about how you work with guilds and what are the main bottlenecks that you're seeing guilds phase that you're solving?
00:31:26.180 - 00:32:49.846, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So again, I just want to reiterate like, the long tail of the industry is basically micro guilds, right? So I always love this data point, right? So if you look at axie numbers today, so they're coming up to 3 million daily active users right now. And we know that around 30% of them, at least, are coming from the Philippines alone. Now, we know that in the Philippines, the majority of players cannot afford their own accounts because an account is literally $300, which is more than, you know, know, a couple of months, basically income, if that, if they are even earning income. Right? So we know the majority of them are coming through scholarship programs. So if we look at basically all those macro guilds, like the really big ones, all the yggs merit circles and so on, you aggregate, like, kind of all their scholar numbers right now, they basically handle, um, probably in total around 50,000 accounts, right? So 50,000 scholars. Now, that may sound like a big number to people, but actually, if you have a look at it, if we consider that 1 million people in the Philippines, you know, are playing axie, and we know that the majority of them are actually scholars through scholarship programs, let's say 70%.
00:32:49.846 - 00:33:30.406, Speaker D: Right? So then 700,000 of them actually coming through scholarship programs, only 50,000 of them are catered to by macro guilds, meaning that your average guild is actually really the small guild, the micro guilds. They're the ones that are basically controlling the majority of the pie. So 650,000 accounts, basically from the Philippines alone, must be handled by micro guilds. That's where we see basically the opportunity. Now, the question is, how do you service that 650,000? Part of the ecosystem?
00:33:30.590 - 00:33:30.982, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:31.038 - 00:34:48.240, Speaker D: And so we have to kind of look very specifically to their needs. Not to the macro guild needs, but the micro guild needs. Right. And so if the average number of accounts is around eight, then you have to think like, okay, so why are you not beyond eight? Why you not at 50? Why are you not at 100? Do you want to stay at eight? Is that a really good number for you? You know, is that the amount of income that you'd like to stabilize that, or is the level of investment too high beyond that? And so from kind of, like, a lot of surveys that we've done, like, speaking to kind of these guilds, we realized that some of them really just don't have access to capital at all, because you have to remember now, again, like us coming from developing markets, I've been here in the Philippines now for ten years. People in developed markets have never seen people get turned down for bank accounts. But I've seen it, actually. The large majority of people in the Philippines actually get turned down for bank accounts, and that's because they don't have credit history.
00:34:48.240 - 00:34:54.906, Speaker D: There's a lot of, let's save our cash, the cash that you own and then putting it under your bed.
00:34:55.050 - 00:34:55.378, Speaker B: Right.
00:34:55.426 - 00:35:03.274, Speaker D: And that's. And a lot of Filipinos, it's also known that, you know, they. They live day by day and they're not very good at saving.
00:35:03.434 - 00:35:03.778, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:03.826 - 00:35:17.666, Speaker D: So. Meaning that, you know, you basically, it's very hard to get kind of credit history with for the banks. And the banks basically can't take on that risk if you don't have any kind of, like, history of, like, earnings and so on.
00:35:17.810 - 00:35:18.114, Speaker C: Right.
00:35:18.154 - 00:35:30.494, Speaker D: So now what's happened is, like, instead of, like this, like, credit history or earnings history, we basically caught in game data, right, that's appearing.
00:35:30.534 - 00:35:30.734, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:30.774 - 00:36:29.788, Speaker D: So you've got basically these. These gamers that are basically the same people that. The ones that couldn't get those bank accounts before, right. And now what they're doing is that they're playing axie every single day for, like, 3 hours a day, and they'll play for, like, the last two, three months. We can see exactly how much they earn on a daily basis, and that becomes the equivalent of what banks have been looking for, which is that earnings history. And so from that, we can actually spin up kind of like, automated models which do automated credit assessments to see whether this person's based on their performance history, if they're actually credit worthy or not, you know? And then if we can come up with just that assessment, it's very easy to plug in money on the other side, like, basically saying, like, okay, this person has been earning, you know, five to 10,000 SLP per month. And let's say 10,000 slP, right.
00:36:29.788 - 00:37:09.010, Speaker D: This person also has a balance of 10,000 SLP with the guild owner. Now, if that person wanted to take out a loan for 5000 SLP, no problem. They just have to apply through automated means. So right now, we do that through a bot that's native to discord, and the person can speak to and say, hey, am I credit worthy? And it will reply yes or no. If you are, then it will tell you how much you can take out. And then the issuance will actually be automated straight into a wallet. From there, they basically have access to that wallet, that designated wallet that they are the ones that, that designated.
00:37:09.010 - 00:37:48.204, Speaker D: And then there'll be another wallet where they pay back the loans, and there'll be a bot that basically, or a script that basically checks to see whether that loan has actually been paid back or not. And so, yeah, that's basically where we're seeing the real opportunity right now is not only for the gamers, the scholars themselves, that want to be able to take, take up loans and become guild owners, but also the guild owners themselves that are stuck at eight accounts. They can actually now show their performance history to others and actually get access to capital, too.
00:37:48.544 - 00:38:08.522, Speaker B: So it sounds like besides just building a platform for guilds to monitor their data, you're also building this marketplace where investors can come basically survey all of the finances of different guilds. If the guilds decide to review those finances and then decide which one to invest in, is that the correct way to kind of summarize the idea?
00:38:08.618 - 00:38:10.626, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.
00:38:10.730 - 00:38:15.654, Speaker B: And how many guilds are you currently working with and what has been the initial kind of reception?
00:38:16.074 - 00:38:57.686, Speaker D: So, I mean, I'd say guilds are just very, very open. Everyone is looking for solutions. Right. It's a very nascent space that this stage. So there's not a single guild that's approached us that didn't want to kind of openly collaborate, but then also likewise, anyone that we've ever approached as well, there's not a single one that didn't want to work as well and kind of move the space forward. So I'd say it's a very open, collaborative ecosystem right now. It's a very nascent space where people actually do take a lot of risk.
00:38:57.830 - 00:38:58.158, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:58.206 - 00:39:08.806, Speaker D: So, you know, it, it helps if others can share their stories with other people so that they can kind of improve or, you know, mitigate risk.
00:39:08.950 - 00:39:22.824, Speaker B: Absolutely. And as we come to the final part of our discussion, I'd love to kind of learn about what your long term growth plan is. What would you say is the roadmap to bootstrap, say the first thousand guilds for us personally? Yes, that's right.
00:39:22.904 - 00:39:59.974, Speaker D: So, yeah, so I have a very clear mission, actually. So we actually want to be able to reach 20,000 guilds by March of next year. I think that's highly possible. Right now, we reach 2700 guilds. We basically do that by providing automation and tooling. These are just very much needed right now by the guilds. So they actually come to us right now because they need the tooling that we provide, and we will continue to provide that for free.
00:39:59.974 - 00:41:07.514, Speaker D: But ultimately, it's not just about the tooling for us. It's about aggregating the most powerful guild database in the world, being able to basically feed that database as a guild data feed to others to basically innovate off. So our vision is way beyond just providing tooling. We want to be able to help people, help other tool makers, product makers to build innovative services for the guilds as well. I actually spoke with one of those service providers this morning who's looking into NFT loans. So like you'd be able to loan axies between different accounts and in the future, potentially between guilds into guild loans. And that's like a major innovation in the space and that's very much needed.
00:41:07.514 - 00:42:16.484, Speaker D: And that for me is the most compelling way basically to onboard all of these guilds because we're working with all of them. There's not a single guild that we deem to be a competitor or we're very neutral in the space and we just want to get as much data as possible to, for other people to make informed decisions. And that at this stage is the core for us. And I think that's very compelling when we do have this database. If we are able to go to NFT game owners, let's say, for example, a game developer sets up a new play to earn game in the US. They have a very strong presence in the US, but they don't have any contacts in Southeast Asia. And if they were able to access a directory of guilds in Southeast Asia that they could basically engage with or mobilize, that would be very, very, very powerful.
00:42:16.484 - 00:43:06.840, Speaker D: And that could be for that game in particular, they might want to engage with that audience because they might still be an alpha, for instance, so that they need like game testers from the asian region to see what the response is like from an asian player, or they want to test out the region to see like do they play the game well, do they understand it or is there a language barrier? Right. And so, you know, there is a lot of power basically in being able to identify who those guilds are. And so that's where the way we see, like onboarding for, you know, the next 20,000 guilds is. We need to explain clearly why it's important for these guilds to be part of this global database and to be able to access those kind of opportunities.
00:43:06.992 - 00:43:26.646, Speaker B: Definitely 100%. I love that. I love that roadmap. And I'm really excited to see you guys onboard 20,000 guilds by next year. And in terms of socials for people who want to keep up to date with what blockchain space is working on, or for guild owners who want to reach out to you, or investors who want to invest in your circle of guilds. What are the best channels for them to reach out?
00:43:26.750 - 00:43:48.390, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. So I guess Twitter is the most active. So look for us at blockchain SPC. That's the official blockchain space Twitter. You can follow myself individually at Peter Eng. So that's Peter ing. That's also on Twitter.
00:43:48.390 - 00:44:03.590, Speaker D: And then check out our git book. I think that's honestly the most information is there. It's really comprehensive. So look at blockchainspace. Getbook IO. So that's blockchain space getbook IO.
00:44:03.702 - 00:44:06.862, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking your time, Peter. This has been really fun.
00:44:06.958 - 00:44:10.374, Speaker D: Yeah. Thank you very much, Jason. It's been awesome. Great questions.
