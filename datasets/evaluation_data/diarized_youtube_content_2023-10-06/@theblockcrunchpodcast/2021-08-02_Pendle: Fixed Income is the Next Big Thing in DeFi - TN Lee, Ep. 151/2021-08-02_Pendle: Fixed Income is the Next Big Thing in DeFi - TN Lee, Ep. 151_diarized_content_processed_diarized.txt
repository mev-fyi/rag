00:00:00.920 - 00:00:32.792, Speaker A: You're now listening to Alpha Leak, a podcast mini series highlighting the most under the radar projects and developments in crypto, and this series is brought to you by the Blockcrunch podcast. I'm your host, Jason Choi. I'm a general partner at Spartan Capital and an active Defi angel investor. Nothing on this show should be construed as financial advice, and my guests, myself, and my employer may hold positions and assets discussed on the show. And if you'd like for your project to be featured on this series, reach out to me on Twitter mrjasonchoi. This episode is brought to you by perpetual protocol, figment, and Solana.
00:00:32.968 - 00:01:04.144, Speaker B: If you've been following the show for a while, you know that I'm a huge fan of fixed income projects in crypto and Defi. It's because they represent a new vertical that hasn't been explored as much as other verticals in DeFi, we've seen a lot of lending protocols, we've seen a lot of trading protocols, but we haven't seen a lot of fixed income projects just yet. And one of the projects that is building in this vertical is Pendle finance. So I'm very excited for users to check it out and to also talk to the founder of Pendle Finance, Tien. So, Tien, welcome to the show.
00:01:04.764 - 00:01:06.304, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you for having me.
00:01:07.084 - 00:01:37.844, Speaker B: So, Tien, you started as a founding member of Kyber Network, which is one of the OG trading projects in crypto and Defi, and then you got involved with a few layer one communities, and then you were inspired to start exploring the fixed income vertical, which is this trillion dollar industry in legacy finance. And then you finally decided to bring it over to Defi via penal finance. So, before we dive in, can you help us understand just what fixed income actually means in defi? You know, is lending on compound or AAVE considered fixed income today?
00:01:38.744 - 00:02:28.990, Speaker C: Right. So I would explain fixed income as a stable flow of earnings from an investment over a period of time, right. And these investments generally offer a more predictable income for the investors. And in DeFi as we know it, most yield is generated via lending, liquidity provision, or participation in a vault. And, you know, the challenge here is that we usually have to monitor these Apy's because they're usually very volatile. Now, in regards to the compound aAve, I would classify the yield on compound and aave as variable because the rates fluctuate depending on the demand and supply of the assets involved. So, for example, the yield for lending Dai on AavE was 10% just two weeks ago.
00:02:28.990 - 00:02:49.154, Speaker C: And now it's hovering around 3% after the overall market deleveraged. So all things considered, as a lender, specifically on AAVE and compound and other lending platforms, the ability to fix the rate can give a user more certainty for cash flow and planning purposes.
00:02:51.484 - 00:03:41.372, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense, because a lot of the lending protocols, like Aave, compound, as you said, they're kind of floating rate right now. So it'd be interesting to see products that offer an actual fixed rate. Now, even before we, before I brought you on, we actually spoke with a few projects that are working on a similar issue, kind of trying to produce a fixed rate product in DeFi. And some of these projects are Saffron, Barnbridge, and listeners can go back and check out some of these episodes. And there's also new approaches, projects like yield protocol and Apyne, which listeners may not be familiar with. So these products, as I understand it, they haven't seen a lot of usage yet, especially compared to, say, aave and compound, the more simple floating rate lending products. So I'm really curious to kind of understand how you categorize this landscape.
00:03:41.372 - 00:03:50.584, Speaker B: So, for someone who's just looking into the defi fixed income scene, how do you group these different projects, like the Saffron and Barmbridge and yield protocols of the world?
00:03:51.164 - 00:04:43.133, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think that the current fixed income scene can be classified into three broad categories. Right now, the first category is the securitization and tranching, which saffron and Bondbridge fall under. So I think, to put it simply, right, tranches aggregate yield across different protocols and pools, and then pool them together into tranches with different risk profiles. And generally, like, the higher risk tranches generate higher yield, and similarly, lower risk tranches generate lower yield. So, as a user, let's say if you are risk averse, you can choose to deposit your asset into a low risk tranche that offers a lower but guaranteed income. The safety is usually guaranteed by the higher risk tranches, which stand to gain from taking more risks during normal periods.
00:04:43.133 - 00:05:43.614, Speaker C: So the second category would cover fixed rate lending and borrowing protocols, such as yield and oceanol. I think in contrast to arbitrary and compound, these protocols take a different approach and allow users to borrow at a fixed rate instead of floating using zero coupon bonds. And then there's the third category, which would cover the interest rate swaps, in which projects like pandle, element and swivel are involved. So these projects expand the interest market in DeFi. And I would say that this category of products increases the amount of optionality in the ecosystem. And the core features allow users to speculate on and hedge against rate exposure. And I think as this category matures, we will likely see many more interesting yield products that these primitives can enable.
00:05:45.434 - 00:05:51.454, Speaker B: Yeah, most definitely. And in terms of pandle, which of these categories do you think it fits under?
00:05:52.074 - 00:06:09.454, Speaker C: Pandle will fall under the interest rate market, because for Pendle, pendle specializes in the trading of yield to allow for the buyers and sellers to interact without having to hold any underlying.
00:06:12.034 - 00:06:21.014, Speaker B: So, can you give us a sense of maybe how big this market is in legacy finance? What types of people would trade these different yields?
00:06:22.514 - 00:07:06.894, Speaker C: Generally, I think in the legacy finance, the interest rate swaps is easily in the trillions of dollars in terms of value. As for the traders who are trading interest rate swaps, I would say that they are largely institutions. So there are many different forms of interest rate swaps. There are fixed to float, float to fix. So, in a way, I think it really subjects to the needs of institutions and organizations, and then there are brokers in between to help facilitate this kind of traits.
00:07:08.434 - 00:07:16.414, Speaker B: And when you say institutions, you're talking about banks that are trading these rates, or is it mostly kind of hedge funds that are speculating on interest rates?
00:07:16.754 - 00:07:35.634, Speaker C: It could be all of them. It could even be an organization that has an organization that just wants fixed income, but they are subject to some kind of float, and then they engage someone else to trade the position.
00:07:37.454 - 00:07:57.066, Speaker B: So, if we were to bring this to defi. So, obviously, the banks are not using DeFi today. Hedge funds. Most of the traditional hedge funds that are trading interest rate markets, they're not really trading defi interest rates yet. So who do you see are the early users of Pendle? Who are the first people to actually use this?
00:07:57.230 - 00:08:25.442, Speaker C: Right. So, I think, in terms of pandle. Right. The idea is to make pendle permissionless so that anyone can use this. But in the earlier days, I think that yield trading is still a relatively complex topic, and we do foresee more institutions and experienced traders coming into the picture with more complex strategies. So, generally, the institutions that we have in mind as target audience. Right.
00:08:25.442 - 00:08:48.644, Speaker C: Include the ones with exposure in Defi. So, for example, some trading desks we've spoken to are intrigued by the idea of on and off chain yield arbitrage with their OTC customer deal flows. So I think these kind of strategies probably wouldn't be available to most retail participants, but could be very interesting for some of these trading desks.
00:08:49.704 - 00:09:01.570, Speaker B: So this idea about on and off chain yield arbitrage, it sounds really interesting to me. Can you maybe walk us through an example, like a simplified example of how that might work if I were to do something like this? If I were an OTC desk?
00:09:01.682 - 00:09:59.618, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So let's assume, right, the funding cost for trading desk is fixed at, let's say 10% per annum, right? And then they deficit, they, they use the funds and deposit in different yield avenues that generate maybe a floating rate between 50% to 100% APY. So what could potentially happen here with the availability of Pendle is for these funds to lock in their exposure so that they can, they can, they can profit from that spread because the generally, right, because the funding cost is fixed, the potential exposure in DeFi is not fixed. So having that optionality to lock in their rates allow these trading desks to book their revenue.
00:09:59.746 - 00:10:39.294, Speaker A: Now before I continue, I'd like to take a moment to share some exciting companies that made this podcast possible. I'd love to talk about our sponsor Solana, a high throughput layer one blockchain. Now, in the past few months I've probably talked to two dozen teams building exciting new projects on Solana, and this is probably why. First, it's incredibly fast with 50,000 transactions per second. 2nd, it's cheap with average fees less than a cent per transaction. That means developers can deploy contracts cheaply and also not have to worry about their apps not being composable with others, as Solana does not use any type of sharding or fragmented L2 systems. Most importantly, Solana is censorship resistant with over 950 validators today.
00:10:39.294 - 00:11:32.080, Speaker A: So if you're interested in building fast, scalable blockchain applications or want to test out the existing ecosystem of Defi applications and more, go to solana.com blockcrunch. I'd like to talk about our sponsor, perpetual protocol. If you're worried about leaving your funds on an exchange that may be hacked, but you are also tired of paying for hundreds of dollars in gas fees in Defi, you should really check them out, because they have built a fully on chain exchange on Ethereum and Xdai that allows up to ten x leverage. Now, they've also released zero gas deposits in addition to near zero gas fees for trading. And if you are paranoid about smart contract exploits like I am, dont worry, because they have also obtained protocol level insurance via nexus mutual and unslashed finance to provide automatic coverage for all traders on perp exchange. Now today, for users outside the US, if you have an Ethereum address, you can already start using perp exchange with no signups.
00:11:32.080 - 00:12:13.582, Speaker A: So go to perp exchange blockbench to check it out. Thats perp exchange blockchain. I'm also proud to call Figment a sponsor of the show. If you're part of any crypto project or you want to launch your own crypto project, you definitely need to check out Datahub. Datahub is Figment's newest product, and they're the fastest way for developers to launch and scale web3 applications. You can access standard network RPC's submit transactions and build even faster with Datahub's unique enhanced APIs. And that's all because under the hood, Datahub is powered by Figment's best in class blockchain infrastructure and is already offered on networks like Cosmos, Avalanche, near Celo and a lot more.
00:12:13.582 - 00:12:29.382, Speaker A: And if you sign up today, you can also get a special offer of 1 million requests per day for free at datahub figment IO. Trust me, you and your team are going to want to check this out. So head on over to Datahub Figment IO or click the link in the show notes to learn more.
00:12:29.558 - 00:12:55.634, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a good segue to talking about how Pendle actually works, right? Because when you say you're locking in, the rate might not be entirely clear to listeners who is locking in that rate and how is that done? So can you help us understand? So how exactly does pendle work? And I think it would be really helpful if you could maybe walk through the user journey of if I were to want to lock in a rate, what are the steps that I take and how does each step happen?
00:12:56.174 - 00:13:46.440, Speaker C: Yes, so to begin, I think for pendle a user will have to possess yield bearing assets. So yield bearing assets are today, some of the most popular yield bearing assets would be a USDC or C USDC. So just for example, at launch we'll support RB and compound, and users that deposit funds in either RB and compound will own a tokens and c tokens. Now then, the users can deposit the A tokens and C tokens into pendle to mint xYT and Ot. XYT here represents the right to receive the future yield, while OT represents the ownership of the yield bearing token.
00:13:46.632 - 00:13:50.328, Speaker B: So what does xYt and ot stand for?
00:13:50.496 - 00:15:04.470, Speaker C: Yeah, so the XYT stands for future yield token, and then ownership token is denominated in OT. Now, so just to elaborate a bit, a yield generating token essentially has two components, right? The first component is the ownership of the underlying, and then the second component is the right to future yield streams. So basically, by tokenizing these two components into OT, and XYT, it allows us as a protocol to separate these elements and enable these two components to be traded individually. So going back to that user experience, after the deposit of a tokens or C tokens into pendle to min OT and XYT, the XyT, again XYT represents the right to receive the future yield, and then the OT represents the ownership of the yield bearing asset. Right. So after minting, after the minting of these assets, the user effectively has two potential follow up actions. The user can either first sell the XYT on the pendle AmM to immediately collect the payment.
00:15:04.470 - 00:16:07.334, Speaker C: So we refer this as fixing the yield because this action allows the user to receive a payment upfront and thus locking in the yield. So they're selling away their yield exposure. They're giving up the rights to receive any interest payments for a foreseeable future in exchange for something immediate. So this is the first action. The second option for an XYT holder is to use that XYT to provide liquidity onto pendle AMM to earn trading fees and incentives. So I just want to point out that the liquidity provision on pendle AMm is designed such as such, that it is very similar to the entire experience of liquidity provision on either sushiswap or Uniswap, because we want to minimize the learning curve. On the flip side, any user can purchase XYT to gain yield exposure, and this allows them to speculate on interest rates in a very capital efficient manner.
00:16:09.274 - 00:16:23.384, Speaker B: That's really cool, and thanks for that clear explanation. The XYT is the tokenized yield, and this is a time decaying product. So can you explain why is it a time decaying product? Where does this decay come from?
00:16:24.204 - 00:17:27.873, Speaker C: Okay, so XYT is a time decaying product because we have wanted the XYT to be traded in a trustless manner. Right? So because of the time decay, because when we introduce time element to a token, it means that the token has a lifespan, and because of the lifespan, the token will expire at some point in time. So XYT effectively represents the right to receive an interest over a period of time. And beyond that expiry, there's no more interest stream coming in. And that's why the token will be valueless. So when you take a token that decays with time and you trade it on a platform like uniswap or sushiswap that does not account for time, it will generally mean, it will mean that the liquidity providers will be suffering from guaranteed losses, especially towards maturity.
00:17:29.573 - 00:17:48.360, Speaker B: Actually, just to clarify, because my understanding was that the XYT token, which is the tokenized yield, is basically tokenizing a yield for floating rate protocols like AAve and compound. And these protocols don't really have an expiry. Right. So where does that expiry element come from when you mentioned that the token expires?
00:17:48.472 - 00:18:43.100, Speaker C: Yes. So the token expiry is actually introduced on Pendle. And the reason why we do that is because we want to have a way for people to trade these assets trustlessly. So let me give you an example. If I mint the OT and XYT, and if there is no expiry, technically speaking, there is no need for anyone to return or sell the XYT back to the original minter. So in the event that the original mentor wants to redeem the underlying, then the original mentor will have to purchase the XYT or OT from the open market. Right? So yeah, if we were to make it more trustless, it would make sense for us to have an expiry.
00:18:43.100 - 00:19:06.144, Speaker C: That kind of forces these tokens to refresh itself. Also, I think having the time element allows for better pricing of the yield because it's almost always easier to price it with a time frame in mind as compared to doing it over a perpetual period.
00:19:07.484 - 00:19:24.500, Speaker B: I see. So I guess an extension of that is, are these XYT tokens fungible or do you have different experience? So say we have an XYD token for Dai compound loans that expire on April 1, and then we have the June 1 tokens and July 1 tokens. Is that how it works?
00:19:24.652 - 00:20:05.054, Speaker C: Yes. So the expiry, okay, so any tokens that are minted with the same expiry will be fungible. Yeah, so, but, okay, so within, let's say we have a USDT, right? So AUsdt can expire on the 31 March. It can also expire on the 31 May. So tokens that expire, like the XYT AUSDt token that expires on the 31 March will be fungible in the same, because they belong in the same liquidity pool, but they will not be compatible with the ones that expire on the 31 may, even though the underlying is consistent.
00:20:06.154 - 00:20:25.114, Speaker B: That's interesting. And how do you go about deciding what expiries? So I'm assuming pendle is the one that sets these expiries. It's not that users can come in and set whatever expiry, because otherwise there'll be infinite number of pools and way too fragmented of liquidity. How do you go ahead and decide what type of expiries to use?
00:20:25.974 - 00:21:31.514, Speaker C: So, you know, honestly, we don't have sufficient data point to decide what's a good expiry and what's not a good expiry. But to begin with, we will be trying out with a smaller set of assets over a longer period of duration, because we have some considerations here, right? We want to, as much as possible, reduce liquidity fragmentation. So we try not to support that many assets in the beginning, and we try not to have too many liquidity pools covering the same period of time. So, for example, if we want to cover the entire year, we can either have two pools of six months each or twelve pools of one month each. So every time there's a smaller pool, I think it will. It will indirectly result in more liquidity fragmentation. So what we do in the beginning is to have longer periods, less number of assets to support, and on top of that, there will be liquidity incentives to encourage community participation.
00:21:32.854 - 00:22:17.670, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. And just to put this in even more concrete terms, because earlier you mentioned that the Dai lending rate on compound was like 10% a few weeks ago, and then now it's like 3%. So for me, as a user, say I have a bunch of dai, I have a bunch of stable coins, and I want to lend them out and lock in that high 10%. So what I can do is I deposited into compound when it was. When it was 10%. And then I take that c token, the representation of my stake that I put into compound, and I go to Pendle, and I basically split it into the ownership token, which is my stake, and also the xYT, which is the yield token. And then I can sell that yield token, that 10% yield token, at a fixed expiry, into the amm pool.
00:22:17.670 - 00:22:26.398, Speaker B: And then I basically lock in all of my 10% yield up to that point in expiry upfront. Is that the right idea here?
00:22:26.566 - 00:22:27.314, Speaker C: Yes.
00:22:27.974 - 00:22:59.824, Speaker B: Got it. And that's such an interesting idea. And I don't think a lot of users in Defi are, you know, they. A lot of them haven't even thought of locking in rates. The concept of locking in rates, and it seems like the whole idea of fixed income is really just starting to take off. So I'm very interested about, do you see any major competing products with Pendle today? I know you mentioned some of these projects that are in different categories, like Saffron and Barnbridge, that are slightly similar, but do you see any products that are most similar to Pendle and directly competitive with Pendo today?
00:23:00.904 - 00:23:30.056, Speaker C: So I think the yield sector is up and coming, and as it grows, we'll likely see more new entrants. Right. So in such a nascent market, I think it's really hard for us to point out a direct competitor. But that said, many have compared pandle with element. So personally, I think very highly of the element team. They've. They've really good background and they know what they're doing.
00:23:30.056 - 00:24:01.964, Speaker C: And even though there are similarities in some of our scopes, I think we are quite different in terms of design and the approach towards yield. So I guess, like, generally speaking. Right, they focus on the utilization of the principal component of a yield bearing asset, while pandle focuses on the yield component. So we've actually spoken with the element team, and given the differences in areas of focus, there are possible synergies that we could explore in the future.
00:24:03.224 - 00:24:13.524, Speaker B: Actually, could you help us understand the point about the different focuses there? So what exactly does element focus on that's different from Pendle?
00:24:14.824 - 00:24:47.884, Speaker C: If you remember, yield bearing assets can be decoupled into the yield component and principal component. Right. So pendle focuses on the yield component in our roadmap. Also, the development in the future, next few months, or the next few years centers around the yield component as well as the amm. Now, in the case of element, the focus is more on the principal side. So I think, you know, going by that, that account. Right.
00:24:47.884 - 00:24:54.324, Speaker C: We are actually diverging in terms of the approach.
00:24:57.584 - 00:25:47.358, Speaker B: Right. That makes a lot of sense. And, you know, what I think is interesting about both projects, element and pendle, and bringing it back to pendle. You know, I think a lot of people are starting to adopt a view that maybe we're in a bear market just because prices are starting to depress a little bit and volumes are coming down, and a lot of people are looking to maybe park their dry powder and stablecoin to earn a yield. But then the yield, as you mentioned, is also kind of compressing because the demand for leverage is lowering, so there's less people borrowing, so the rates are coming down. So the idea of being able to lock in a yield that's higher as soon as possible to maximize your returns on your delta neutral strategies, that's something that I think makes a lot of sense for crypto traders, be. Be it a whale or fund or kind of just smaller traders.
00:25:47.358 - 00:26:10.594, Speaker B: And on that point, I'm actually curious. So Pendle has been launched for a little bit now, and I'm curious about what type of users are you guys seeing interest from maybe users on the testnet or people who reach out to you on community forums? Are these mostly like crypto whales that are looking to lock in a rate or kind of funds that are trying to trade these interest rate markets.
00:26:13.634 - 00:27:11.384, Speaker C: So as of now, pandle is still on the testnet. Right. And so the numbers have to be taken with a pinch of salt. Generally speaking, I think we are, you know, like from observation, I think the interest comes mainly from more sophisticated traders and funds with exposure and deFi. But that said, we have seen some pretty good interests with, you know, at least from the last I checked, it's about 8000 addresses that have interacted with our testnet contracts. The origins of the contracts, sorry, the origins of the wallet addresses that have interacted with the contract are largely unknown, but I would think that they are. There's a pretty good hybrid of retail and institutional participants.
00:27:11.384 - 00:27:28.184, Speaker C: But, yeah, I think in the shorter term, as I've explained earlier, I think that yield is a relatively complex and new topic, and I think the initial users will likely come from the institution side.
00:27:29.754 - 00:28:00.580, Speaker B: Yeah, I can definitely see that. I think as we expand DeFi to more and more complex products that replicate, or at least are similar to what we see in legacy financial markets, we are going to attract more sophisticated players. And usually those players take a longer time than your typical retail djen to come into the market. They need a bit more time to get comfortable with the risks. But that's where the big opportunity is. That's where the trillion dollar markets are created. So I'm really, really excited to see where Pendo goes.
00:28:00.580 - 00:28:10.264, Speaker B: So for listeners who want to test out the Testnet today or stay up to date to see when the mainnet will be launched, what are some best resources for them to do this?
00:28:10.924 - 00:28:45.816, Speaker C: Right. So the best resources would be the Pendle site. Like Pendle Finance would direct visitors to any of the outlets that we have. So Pendleton finance is a good resource to start off. And then I would say Twitter is also an avenue that we are very active on. And of course, Discord Channel is where we're most active in. Our discord server has about maybe 4000 members by now.
00:28:45.920 - 00:28:46.584, Speaker B: Wow.
00:28:46.744 - 00:29:33.114, Speaker C: There's usually very active discussions around many topics, not just pertaining to Pendle. And in fact, one of our near term focuses is to build a strong community that understands the Pandel protocol, because this is required for future community governance. Right. And yeah, in the near term, I think education is also one of our core focuses, given the complexity of the subject. So we're investing quite a lot of resources in helping people to understand more about yield trading and pendle. So for anyone who's new to yield trading and pendul I would suggest this court to be a starting point.
00:29:34.574 - 00:29:52.650, Speaker B: Yeah, most definitely. And we'll definitely include some of those in the show notes below. While Tien, this has been a really educational episode. I really appreciate how you came on and explained to us what the fixed income landscape looks like as well as what you guys are working on. So I can't wait to share this with the listeners. So thanks again for coming on. Tian thank you.
00:29:52.682 - 00:29:54.154, Speaker C: Thank you, Jason, for having me.
