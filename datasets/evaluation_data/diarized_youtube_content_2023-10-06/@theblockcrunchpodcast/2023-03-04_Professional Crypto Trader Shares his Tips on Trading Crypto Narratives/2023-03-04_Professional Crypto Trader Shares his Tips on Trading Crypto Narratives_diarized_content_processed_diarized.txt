00:00:00.440 - 00:00:39.228, Speaker A: Crypto is a game of positioning for narratives before they exist. That's really, you know, that's the game in a nutshell. And yeah, to your point, what is a narrative that's kind of a very open ended thing. I mean, what I think it is is a reason to expect future price appreciation. That is really the actual narrative itself. So for example, the merge was a very strong narrative and it's in the past now, so we could talk about it objectively. There was a view that once the merge occurred, its tokenomics would drastically change and that would drive future price appreciation.
00:00:39.228 - 00:00:56.964, Speaker A: So in its purest sense, that is the narrative. It's the reason to expect future price appreciation. That really is the narrative because no one will buy or sell something because they think there's really good things happening at this very moment, right? You're buying and selling because you are speculating something is going to happen in the future.
