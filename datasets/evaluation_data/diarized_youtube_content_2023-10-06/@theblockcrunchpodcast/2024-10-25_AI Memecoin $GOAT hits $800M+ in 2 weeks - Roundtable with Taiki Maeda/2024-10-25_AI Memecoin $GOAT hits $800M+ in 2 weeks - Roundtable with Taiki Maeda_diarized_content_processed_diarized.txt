00:00:00.200 - 00:00:43.303, Speaker A: I think Goat came at a really interesting meta because, you know, in September Murad had the whole, you know, meme Coin super cycle thesis on stage and gave the thesis for why cold coins can potentially pump super hard. And then, you know, a month later this thing like a new potential AI cult in AI religion starts to come and I think, you know, it the narrative really fits the current zeitgeist and the narrative within crypto of anti VC fair launch. You know, we want things that retail can participate in. Of course Goat is pumping super hard. It's the index. It's like an index way of Tibet on this particular matter. But if you look at the Solana trenches, I've been in the trenches recently and things are wild.
00:00:43.303 - 00:00:47.751, Speaker A: There are things that, you know, go from 0 to 100 million in like 12 hours.
00:00:47.818 - 00:00:50.199, Speaker B: Web3 offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:50.247 - 00:00:54.727, Speaker C: Our job is to buy great tech at great prices. AI is also libertarian right enable use.
00:00:54.751 - 00:00:56.007, Speaker A: Case that people haven't been able to.
00:00:56.031 - 00:00:57.543, Speaker B: Do today, the next hundreds of millions.
00:00:57.559 - 00:01:37.201, Speaker C: Of players, they will come to the market through mobile. My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next 12 months is blockcrunch is not a licensed financial advisor and is purely for informational and entertainment purposes only. All opinions are personal and the show may discuss assets that the host or guests have positions in or may be actively buying or selling. All investments carry risk, so consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions. Hey there. Welcome back to another episode of the blockcrunch Roundtable where we discuss interesting trends in crypto. I'm your host, Jason Choi, co founder of Tangent, where we invest in founder driven venture bets and thesis driven liquid bets in crypto.
00:01:37.201 - 00:02:58.739, Speaker C: I'm once again joined by my co host, Sanat Kapoor from Dragonfly Capital, one of the leading venture funds in crypto and a very, very special guest who is our third co host for the week, Taiki Maeda, also known as the humble farmer on Twitter and co host of the popular podcast Steady Lads to share the retail investor slash researchers perspective. So as of Today's recording, on the 23rd of October, we had a pretty big week in crypto AI and a very, very sci fi story. In fact, it's the first time I'm getting quite excited about what's happening in crypto AI because we have just encountered the first AI to become a millionaire. Now this AI agent truth terminal, which is tied to the meme Coin Goat emerged first as sort of an experimental art project by artist Andy Array and subsequently attracted the attention of legendary VC Mark Andreessen of the Andreessen Horowitz fame, who donated $50,000 to this bot and as of recording this, has somehow culminated in a half a billion dollar cult meme coin called Gold. So today you get the angel investor, the VC and the retail investor slash researchers perspective on this whole AI agents meme coin meta and this self aware meme coin concept. And whether this is a flash in the pan or a sign of a new interesting narrative in crypto and our thoughts on specific projects that we've seen in the past few days as well. So this is a very, very new development.
00:02:58.739 - 00:03:34.795, Speaker C: So by the time this episode comes out in a few days, a lot of the things might, you know, have happened or some of the things might have died out. So definitely do not take anything we discussed in this episode as financial advice and as a disclaimer. Tangent does own some gold coins. So without further ado, let's get started. So, Taki, I think people who listen to this show are probably like a subset of people who listen to your show. So most people probably know you already. But before I get started, for those of us who might not know you before, can you give a little bit of a summary of what you do in the space, what brought you to crypto and what's your interest in that? What we're going to discuss today?
00:03:35.295 - 00:04:03.339, Speaker A: Yeah, so I got into crypto, like mid-2020. I was playing poker professionally back then, and then when crypto started to pop off, I was like, okay, I have to spend my time on this and defi. Some are really interested in me. And ever since then I've been really focused on defi stuff. And as a result, I'm often known as this mid curve youtuber. I try a lot to focus on the fundamental research. I looked at cash flows, the PE and analysis, and it's like, oh, I'm doing so much hard work.
00:04:03.339 - 00:04:29.485, Speaker A: And then the meme coiners, they outperform me. So when I saw this AI cold coin stuff, I'm like, yo, this is, this is the type of shit that I actually get. You know, this is like the meme coin meta that I can maybe I can actually have an edge in. So, you know, we can talk more about Shoot Terminal. But you know, when I saw it like 10 days ago or so, like, it just clicked. And I think it, I think you said it, Jason. But it's very intellectually stimulating, like what this actually means.
00:04:29.485 - 00:04:55.015, Speaker A: It feels like it's a birth of a new meta. It kind of reminds me of like maybe WI fi, where, you know, WI Fi just, like, pumped crazy amounts in mid-2020. And, of course, Wi Fi maybe not such a good token anymore, but it really kickstarted a new meta that allowed other defi coins to, you know, succeed, let's say. So maybe, you know, that's a similar analogy, but I think that's kind of where we're at. And, yeah, very interesting stuff.
00:04:55.675 - 00:05:35.001, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think, just to give some context, listeners who may not be aware yet. So I think all of this AI cold, sentient meme coin thing started with this thing called Goat. And, guys, feel free to jump in if I get any of this wrong, but the TLDR is there was a researcher who is doing kind of an art project. He goes by the name of Andy Array, and he launched a thing called Infinite Backrooms, which is effectively two instances of the clawed opus LLM talking to each other in a completely kind of unsupervised manner. And they started to have really weird conversations which people can check out online, and then somehow. And led to the inception of this, like, quasi religion called Goat.
00:05:35.001 - 00:06:01.343, Speaker C: Sea of Gnosis and Goatse is based on this meme from, I think, like, 10, 15 years ago. Right. Which is a very fucking disgusting meme. So for people who don't know what it is, it's basically an image of someone's anus spread very wide. But I don't think a lot of people actually know what the actual image was. But effectively it became like a meme kind of thing. And then someone created a token called Goat tied to this, tied to this kind of new AI experiment.
00:06:01.343 - 00:06:33.223, Speaker C: And then there's also a Twitter account called Terminal of Truth, which effectively is managed by this AI that Andy created. And then it started to go off the rails. And then the big thing was mark andreason from a 16Z kind of coming across Truth terminals, tweets, and kind of in an amused way. He sent it, I think $50,000 to an address that's tied to that bot to free the AI. And it just kind of took off from there. And then now, I think as of recording 23rd of October, it's trading at like, 500 million. Market Cap CT is going wild over this.
00:06:33.223 - 00:06:40.875, Speaker C: I think the AI is officially a millionaire. The first AI millionaire. So when you guys first heard this story, like, how did you react to it?
00:06:42.865 - 00:07:27.645, Speaker A: Well, I guess, like, my initial reaction was like, what? What is this? And, you know, I think Goat came at a really interesting meta because, you know, in September, Murad had the whole, you know, meme coin super cycle thesis on stage and gave the thesis for why cold coins can potentially pump super hard. And then, you know, a month later this thing, like a new potential AI cult in AI religion starts to come. And I think you know, it. The narrative really fits the current zeitgeist and the narrative within crypto of anti VC fair launch. No, we want things that retail can participate in. Of course GOAT is pumping super hard. It's the index.
00:07:27.645 - 00:08:01.383, Speaker A: It's like an indexed way of Tibet on this particular meta. But if you look at the Solana trenches, I've been in the trenches recently and things are wild. There are things that go from 0 to 100 million in like 12 hours. There's a bunch of I don't own this coin, but there's a far coin that's like 50 million market cap. It's such a weird meta and I feel like if you're a retail, this is the place to at least focus your attention on. Of course, this could be a top signal, right? It's like three. We have Dragonfly Tangent and that Defi researcher talking about ghosts.
00:08:01.383 - 00:08:21.145, Speaker A: So this could be massive top signals. I have a feeling that this thing has legs. And I think the total addressable market of people that could deploy into AI cults is much bigger than people that might deploy to like Pepe or something. And I think it's going to bring more capital and intellect, intellectual, I guess, you know, talent to crypto.
00:08:22.045 - 00:08:41.450, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like there's some analogies you can draw to the NFT cycle. But I curious because, Sana, I think you were the one who kind of told me about this at first when Andreas, when Mark Andreas and first donated like $50,000 to this bottom. So how did you find this thing? And then what was your reaction as a venture investor in this space?
00:08:41.642 - 00:09:31.897, Speaker B: I mean, so I actually, I thought the truth Terminal experiment was interesting, but I think a lot of these AI LLM experiments are generally pretty fun. I was surprised that GOAT got the amount of traction it did because it didn't feel pure enough to me. Like maybe my nitpicky thing is like it doesn't feel like the AI started a coin. It feels like the AI is saying some words and someone is deploying a token on Pump Fun. And that feels like it takes away from the purity. But I guess I totally agree with Taiki that the room for AI cults is really big. And so I think, Jason, you were around when a mutual fund friend of ours, I want to say this is like a year and a half ago, said Look, I was basically complaining about not finding good AI ex crypto venture companies that are going to hit product market fit.
00:09:31.897 - 00:10:02.495, Speaker B: And he said, you're thinking about this the wrong way. There are going to be some AIX crypto scam tokens. They're going to pump more than you can ever imagine and they will have no product market fit. And I think he was directionally totally correct. And I expect to see way more speculative manias in and around AIX crypto. I don't think Truth terminals, like association with goat is really like, qualifies it as like the AI is taking over crypto, but the meme probably has legs.
00:10:02.955 - 00:10:39.385, Speaker C: I think it's pretty wild actually, if you zoom out and think about it, because there's basically this AI that's unsupervised and it promoted its new quasi religion completely against the wishes of the creator. Like, as far as I know, this Andy A. Ray guy, I don't think he was meant for this Goatse thing to become like a meme. So it just completely created this thing itself. And obviously the story is not as pure as some think, like that the token was not technically minted by the bot, but all the content on Twitter is driven by the bot. And I think someone created a wallet attached to this bot that basically is owned by this bot. Now, I don't know whether they have any signing rights over it.
00:10:39.385 - 00:10:41.241, Speaker C: Like, can the bot sign things?
00:10:41.393 - 00:11:21.753, Speaker A: No. So basically how it works is the Truth Terminal wallet that people track, it holds, you know, a million or $2 million of like random tokens that's controlled by Andy. So Andy is effectively acting as like the arms or hands of Truth Terminal. And Andy also monitors the tweets that it puts out just so that it won't say any racist stuff. So it's not completely automated. And so that's why I think, you know, it's not like the most pure thing, but it is the first mover. So, you know, of course, you know, like Sanat said, like, how much upside does this have? Like, I don't know, but probably like more upside than Pepe or Whiff, probably, honestly, you know, it's a meme coin, right? It could go to zero, like, obviously.
00:11:21.753 - 00:12:10.345, Speaker A: But I think this is like the new Zeitgeist. And I think one thing I've noticed is that, you know, I'm sure you two know this as well, but, you know, I'm in group chats with so many, like, fund managers that would never buy things like Pepe, but now they're like, oh, I'm Buying go because it makes sense, right? So we have. I call this idle mid curve capital, right? So capital that would otherwise buy defi coins or L1 tokens. Now some of that capital is going into goat and like other goat derivatives. And the total, like the idle mid curve capital is really big, right? There's so much capital in crypto that's just sitting there, like farming or like holding eth or something. And if, you know, even like a small percentage of that, like a few basis points, enter AI cold coins because they're so illiquid, like they're going to, you know, send it higher. So, you know, definitely a bubble here, right? It's.
00:12:10.345 - 00:12:16.525, Speaker A: I think we can all agree this is a bubble, but, you know, bubbles can get a lot bigger than we can. You know what we can imagine.
00:12:16.825 - 00:12:43.545, Speaker C: Do you think if we get an AI meme coin that's actually minted completely unsupervised by an AI, then it would become kind of like the board age, like if this were the NFT cycle, Just to draw an analogy. And like, let's say gold is the punks of this meta, because it's the first. It's got that kind of first mover advantage, is the board apes version of this. Basically an AI that actually creates its own tokens and mint its own tokens. Have you guys seen something like that yet?
00:12:45.125 - 00:13:26.353, Speaker A: I don't think I've seen any. You know, I did an interview with Alex Good, who I think is one of the best researchers and writers when it comes to crypto and the intersection of crypto and AI, and he thinks that we are in the first innings of this AI crypto super cycle, like of just these cults forming. And he said, like, the worst thing you can do is to just, you know, get destroyed in the first inning because you're going. You're just speculating way too hard. So I can definitely imagine, you know, 99% of these coins that's out right now just go to zero. And then maybe early 2025, like legit ones, launch, and then, you know, that attracts more capital. So maybe this is like the first pump, right? It's a test pump that continues in 2025.
00:13:26.353 - 00:13:37.565, Speaker A: That's kind of how I view it. So I'm not going too hard, even though I'm still in the trenches buying, you know, shit coins here and there, having fun, but, you know, definitely trying to, you know, lower my greed.
00:13:38.225 - 00:13:38.953, Speaker C: I like that.
00:13:39.049 - 00:13:41.393, Speaker A: Are you guys buying stuff, like, just curious. I don't know if you can say.
00:13:41.409 - 00:13:46.725, Speaker C: This, but we're Well, I don't know, Sana. I think you probably are degenerating a little bit.
00:13:47.465 - 00:14:05.445, Speaker B: Very little. Like I said, 1. To answer question, I do find it very frustrating that the AI didn't actually create the coin. Like, it kind of kills it for me. There's some guy who's just like, ah, go tweeted it. It is interesting. Today, Anthropic just announced that they are giving Claude, which is their like, chat GPT equivalent.
00:14:05.445 - 00:14:33.139, Speaker B: They've like launched a version that can control a computer in full. And so now it can definitely open, pump and launch a meme coin. And so I definitely think that's the next step. And I'm curious for like an AI that actually launches the coin itself and keeps the money, at least on behalf of someone else, but still has like full control over it. In terms of degener, I don't trade very much at the best of times. I find this stuff very like. I feel like I'm always at the bottom of.
00:14:33.139 - 00:14:59.145, Speaker B: You guys have seen that meme where there's like crows pooping on other crows. And I always feel like I'm like, anytime I'm in like the. In the meme coin space, I always feel like I'm the bottom most crowd. So I'm always super worried. I didn't notice that Goat got its bybit and hyperliquid listings today, which does feel like either the top, I feel like that usually means the top is near, or it's actually going to be much bigger than any of us are giving it credit for.
00:14:59.525 - 00:15:05.341, Speaker C: So I think some people have drawn this parallel to like, just to bring back the NFT parallel. So people have drawn the parallel that this is the loot moment.
00:15:05.373 - 00:15:05.493, Speaker A: Right?
00:15:05.509 - 00:15:40.993, Speaker C: You guys remember last cycle during nft, after all the massive, like NFT related info rounds? At the end we had this thing which is Loot, which is basically like a series of JPEGs with nothing but like a black background with some white text on it. And it was created by, I think, the founder of vine. And people are basically memeing this narrative that, hey, people are going to build entire video games using the Items on these NFTs as like in game items is going to be huge. But obviously, I think, like, no games ever really came. There's maybe one or two small experiments. The VC started writing threads on this, doing a lot of interviews on this. I think we did an episode on Loot and that was the picotop.
00:15:40.993 - 00:15:55.325, Speaker C: So people are now saying that maybe these AI meme coins are the discycles version of loot. We had two years of like meme coin bull market, and then now we have this like, as crazy as it gets. I'm curious if you guys think that. And I'll share my views after too.
00:15:56.745 - 00:16:41.389, Speaker A: Well, I mean, if Goat is the punks, then a loot will come months later, right? If we were using the same analogy, that's true. But it is possible, right, that all the idle mid curve capital that missed with Pepe and all this stuff finally capitulates on their fundamental coins and they decide to buy AI cold coins and then that marks the top. That would be a really entertaining story and I would be really sad in that scenario. But the thing with memes is that you never know, right? It's only obvious in hindsight. So you kind of just have to, I don't know, like, just grab your balls and just go for it. I think that's kind of like what I'm going for. It's like, I can't really justify why Goat is like at a $680 million market cap or like why any of these things have this much value.
00:16:41.389 - 00:17:29.857, Speaker A: But, you know, and if you also think about incentives, right, like unsuccessful AI companies might just launch a coin because you can get them like $100 million market cap. Elon is also incentivized to like bring more attention to Tush Terminal because, you know, it is like a Twitter or X product. It will drive ad revenue. And I think it is also intellectually stimulating for him as well, potentially, once he discovers it. So if you think about incentives, I think that there's a lot more room that this can go. But I don't have a view on the short term price action of any of these things, of course. I just think it's a test pump, let's say, where in the next three years we'll look back on this moment and be like, oh, yeah, this something, some version of this makes sense, right? The intersection of AI and crypto.
00:17:29.857 - 00:17:31.205, Speaker A: It kind of makes sense.
00:17:33.145 - 00:17:34.805, Speaker C: Sara, what do you think about this?
00:17:38.545 - 00:18:17.545, Speaker B: Yeah, I find it tricky. I do think meme coins, I, like, don't. I think the analogy of NFTs and meme coins is like, too easy. Like, people are like, oh, don't worry, this is just like a bubble and then like it'll fall and then we'll be back like NFTs. And I don't think that's quite it. I think this era of meme coins has had lots of like, interesting developments, including kind of innovations on the bonding curve with stuff Like Pump. And I do think generally like bubble, like thinking about how big bubbles can get, an AIX crypto bubble feels like it could get way bigger than it is right now.
00:18:17.545 - 00:18:53.745, Speaker B: Like, it feels like right now we have tao, which is kind of running an incentive flywheel for some other crypto projects, and we have a couple of these meet coins and that's nothing, right? Like, like think about the fact that like, like when I think of crypto manias, I think of like pure Axie mania, when axie was worth $100 billion and everyone was launching a P2E game. And we were just convinced that we had like arrived at the future of gaming. And I feel like. So I do think the AIX crypto bubble gets bigger from here. Whether we come up with a lot of useful stuff, I'm still skeptical. And this doesn't feel like it's it either. Like, it feels like the most interesting thing.
00:18:53.745 - 00:19:34.695, Speaker B: Like if the most interesting thing that we can do at the intersection of AIX crypto is get an AI to go to pump and launch a meme coin, it's just, it's just not actually that interesting past a certain point. Like, I get there can be lower around the first one, but I feel like it's not actually useful enough to be that exciting. And I also feel like this specific class of meme probably has like only a few iterations. Like you can't be the eighth AI launched coin. Like, no one cares. At some point any AI can launch a coin and people have already started tokenizing basically every single word that comes out of Truth Terminal. So I'm curious where this goes, because go does have an advantage where it doesn't feel like if you launched a fifth one or a tenth one, it would quite hit the same.
00:19:34.695 - 00:19:40.805, Speaker B: But memes are just hard to predict, as Taiki said. So you never know.
00:19:40.955 - 00:20:29.131, Speaker C: I would agree if all of the subsequent iterations are like this, right? Where there's like some sort of a meme coin tangentially tied to this Twitter account. And Twitter account is just dropping random shit all the time. But like with the Claude demo that you just mentioned, Anthropic from Anthropic, I think there could be a lot more stuff. Like one of my conspiracy theories is that, you know, one day AI is just going to create content. You know, they're going to create their own YouTube accounts, their own social accounts, they're going to upload all these Psyops content and they're going to buy ads on social media and basically target using kind of demographic data to See what type of content can psyops, what type of people the best, and then just cause like civil conflicts. Because I saw this firsthand, like in multiple cases in the past few histories in the world in the past few years. And we saw kind of glimpses of this with like the Cambridge Analytica saga as well.
00:20:29.131 - 00:21:07.837, Speaker C: So I feel like these AI things, these AI agents can get up to a lot of fuckery if you give them maximum access to your computer and just like no constraints. So I feel like, okay, printing a meme coin and kind of tweeting about it is probably the kind of corner of the iceberg in terms of where this goes. And that's where I think the loot analogy probably falls apart, is with loot, there's this like massive incentive misalignment. You're really praying for people to come and build games around your nft, which is probably going to take years. And if I do spend billions of dollars building a game, I don't want to add value to your nft. I'm going to create my own versus, like with AI agents right now. It's already live, like you can.
00:21:07.837 - 00:21:40.465, Speaker C: There's no time lag. You don't have to wait two, three years for the value to be actualized. And they're already tweeting stuff. You can already do stuff with AI agents. So I am quite excited about this and I think what Taiki was saying about kind of the 100 IQ capital being interested in this is so interesting as well because, like, guys who usually would not trade meme coins at all seems like they are at least like their ears are perking up about this. And I'm curious, like, why you think that is. Like, what about this thing is different from like a Mudang coin or like an animal meme coin or like a mock coin?
00:21:40.965 - 00:22:09.945, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like, if you're buying Mudang, it's like, dude, like, what? Like, what are you doing? Right? It's like, okay, you're trading momentum, I guess. But I think the lore behind Andreessen, you know, giving it $50,000. Andrew, like Mark Andreessen, a16z, put out a podcast yesterday on the 22nd, like a 40 minute podcast where they just only talked about True's terminal. So I think that is kind of like the, you know, the stamp of approval, I suppose. And like, you can't replicate that story.
00:22:09.985 - 00:22:10.137, Speaker C: Right?
00:22:10.161 - 00:22:55.505, Speaker A: It's kind of like the immaculate conception that bitcoin had and whatnot. You know, you can't repeat the bitcoin story because it just like Won't happen, or it just can't happen. And there's a tweet by based16z, which I think is like, you know, like, he's like, very into this stuff. And one thing he said, that one thing he tweeted out was, these AI bots can push whatever meme they want, but you're the playing card. Usually humans use AI to make their processes more efficient or something, but for sure, terminal, it just attached itself to a coin and it's spreading the Goatse gospel. And because humans are buying it, it's creating a reflexive loop where it brings more attention to the Goatse gospel. So it's effectively using human coordination and human greed to push its own message.
00:22:55.505 - 00:23:37.067, Speaker A: And I think that's like, that's why it's really interesting. It has the Mark Andreessen stamp of approval, so if funds buy it, they can justify to their LPs, oh, you know, like, this makes sense, right? Like, you know, AI crypto is good, right? You know, like, whatever. Whereas they can't do that for Pepe. And it, you know, it just like, opens up the world of, like, okay, like, if we have all these AI KOLs, these key opinion leaders, like, what does the world look like in six months? I have no idea. Right. And that's why, you know, people are just interested, because I think everyone understands that the total addressable market of AI coins, the bubble, can get much bigger than, like, animal coins. So there's so much more upside to be had.
00:23:37.067 - 00:23:56.145, Speaker A: We don't know what the upside is. And that's exactly how bubbles form. And, you know, the risk is asymmetric in that sense. Of course, you can go to zero, but if you pick correctly, theoretically, these things can't hit 100 billion. Theoretically. Right. So I think that's why it's worth spending attention and time on.
00:23:57.005 - 00:24:54.605, Speaker C: I think one of the kind of tangential implications of this is also the question of provenance, because people always talk about the Turing Test. How do we run tests to make sure that this, you know, this human is a human and not an AI? But now people probably want the opposite of that, which is like, how do I make sure this AI bot that, you know, I'm following is actually an AI and not just like some. Some bro somewhere tweeting out stuff pretending to be an AI? And I think Haseeb from Dragonfly actually did a talk about how to do kind of a proof of origination or provenance for AI models with crypto and why it is difficult. I think one big reason he mentioned was like, first of all, if you rerun all of the computation on chain, that shit's going to cost like a billion dollars in gas. And number two is because transactions are like, deterministic, but AI outputs are not. Like, if I plug the same thing into the same instance of an AI model on a slightly differently configured device, I could get different outputs. So it's very hard for crypto to kind of prove that.
00:24:54.605 - 00:25:09.285, Speaker C: So I don't know. Do you guys see this as like a big concern? It seems like for Sinai, it's a big concern for you, like to figure out whether this coin is actually minted by an AI, whether this AI is actually an AI. Is there like an intersection with crypto? Is there a business to be made there?
00:25:09.905 - 00:26:07.169, Speaker B: I think to your point, it does matter to me, but seemingly it doesn't matter very much. And these things are mimetic, right? Who cares what I think it is a meme coin. If enough holders believe that it has an immaculate conception, then in some sense that's all that matters. Purely a Keynesian beauty contest, whichever way you spin it. I think, like I said, I've struggled a lot with like, whether we have useful products at the intersection of crypto and AI, and I've only seen a handful of ideas that even seem vaguely promising. And I kind of share the same skepticism on like, whether we can use crypto to prove the provenance of AI results. I do think the thing that Taiki said about like, fund managers needing justifications is super important.
00:26:07.169 - 00:26:46.931, Speaker B: It's like there's a ton of cope from VCs about meme coins, and that's very natural because you just can't buy them. It's like an asset class you're not allowed to play in. And so it like a very natural reaction is to poo poo it. I think, you know, the truth is that I think in some ways Tao benefited from this a lot as well, where I think it's very hard to justify Tao on any fundamental basis. And I actually had a very long chat with a fund manager who had invested in it about like almost a year and a half ago. I want to say now, when it was still a super illiquid coin, just kind of trading on chain. And I kind of pushed them a bunch.
00:26:46.931 - 00:27:00.487, Speaker B: And I was like, ah, I read the white paper, this doesn't make sense. I was like, typical mid curve guy was like, this doesn't add up. And he was like trying to tell me something about incentives, power. And then eventually he was just like, look, AI Coin. Good. I'm not going to pretend otherwise. And in some sense, like, he was right.
00:27:00.487 - 00:27:12.755, Speaker B: And Tao is really nice because it's like, it's like basically an AI meme. But there's enough in the docs that you can, like, justify to your LPs. Like, if you needed to tell a story, you could. And in some sense, those are the perfect coins.
00:27:13.535 - 00:27:14.103, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:27:14.159 - 00:27:27.417, Speaker B: They have, like, good mimetic kind of incentive flywheels. But you can also kind of justify to your LPs why this is like the future of France or whatever it is you needed to be on that day for your LPs.
00:27:27.601 - 00:27:50.285, Speaker A: Yeah. And even I think an AI research company called like News Research, they ran a subnet on Bittensor which kind of added to the legitimacy and, like, News did it for like 30 or $40,000 of incentives a month. But what's stopping News News Research from, like, doing some crypto AI meme coin project? Right. And it's probably going to be worth. They're probably going to make much more than like, 400k a year doing that.
00:27:52.065 - 00:27:52.377, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:52.401 - 00:28:31.935, Speaker A: I mean, I just love this meta. I was going to say something, but I totally forgot my head is going all over the. Oh, sorry, sorry. One thing I was thinking about is, like, you know, with Murad, what he mentioned was that I think he thinks meme coins are going to take away the speculative premium that altcoins have had, because most altcoins are overvalued to begin with. And Tao, a lot of vc is considered it to be like an AI meme coin and has a lot of speculative premium. But now that Goat is pumping and all these other things are pumping, I think Tao loses some of that speculative premium and it flows over to Goat. So I actually think that Tao starts to underperform and, like, these AI cults might potentially start to outperform.
00:28:31.935 - 00:28:52.525, Speaker A: Hope the Bittensor people will be pissed at me for saying that, but, you know, like, what do you think? Do you think there's, like, validity to that? Like, there's a chance that Murad is completely right with his thesis and, you know, he's still going to make a shit ton of money, you know, happy for him and his meme coin holders, cold coin holders, but his theory might apply more to, like, AI coins. What do you think?
00:28:52.565 - 00:29:16.325, Speaker C: I think his. So we actually did an interview with Murad and it was insane in terms of, like, the traction. So this podcast, I consider it a very acquired taste. Like a niche type of podcast where sometimes we get a few thousand views on YouTube and then, you know, a few, a few thousand more on downloads. And then for the Murad interview, within 23 hours it got like 30,000 views. There was just the most number of views I've ever had in eight years of doing this. I didn't even expect that.
00:29:16.325 - 00:30:10.727, Speaker C: So clearly people really resonate or there are a lot of bots for some reason. But I think what he describes is very accurate for a closed system, right? When there's no new money coming into crypto and all of the, you know, marginal capital coming into crypto is going into like the Bitcoin etf and those are not the guys to, you know, come in and buy alts as well. I think in that closed system then there will always be capital rotation, be it from memes to AI and maybe from AI to memes and maybe back to memes. So it's very, very difficult to say whether, you know, over a long horizon whether the existence of these like Asian coins takes away from like projects like Bittensor. So we do hold some tao and I think the kind of angle for tao is completely different from a lot of these agent coins. But you know, in a closed system the capital is going to flow around. But once you have an open system, I do think that AI agents probably have, you know, a clearer story for retails to participate in.
00:30:10.727 - 00:30:31.047, Speaker C: It's easier to understand if you look at the best performing. Well, maybe not the best performing, but the highest valued meme coins. It's all the animal coins. It's the things that are easiest to understand. You look at a corgi, oh, it's cute, I'm going to buy this coin. So to a certain extent I think the goat story is also quite easier to understand. Like basically an AI became sentient, they created their own coin and now they're tweeting memes.
00:30:31.047 - 00:30:59.553, Speaker C: Right? It's very easy to understand. And I think as a slight tangent, we're starting to see a lot of AI agent coins that I think are way too intellectual or way too obscure for people to get excited about. So like one that I saw was called Genon, which is this very obscure religion with extreme milady type of vibes. Right. If you go on the website, Genon AI is just spousing a lot of things that I just can't understand. And I think I am pretty like Internet native. I still don't fully understand what the hell it is.
00:30:59.553 - 00:31:44.515, Speaker C: So there's a lot of like very quasi religion kind of experimental stuff that I think is probably a bit too far fetched for the market to get very, very excited about at scale. But then on the other hand, there's also things that are way too opportunistic. Like, people will see this and know this is a cash grab. So like, I saw one called, like, she genuinely, which is like a female version of goat. There's one called Luna, which is like a virtual idol that lives on TikTok and then suddenly created a token because this thing was taking off. So there are things that strike me as more just like cash grabby. There are some things that strike me as way too far out, and I feel like goat sits kind of comfortably in the middle, where if the system opens up to become an open system versus just a PvP, I think things like that might get a lot more attention.
00:31:44.515 - 00:31:49.409, Speaker C: Sorry, I completely digress from what you were asking in the first place, Taiki.
00:31:49.537 - 00:32:08.825, Speaker A: No, no, no. I, I've been looking at Luna too. This AI idol. I was like, what even is this? You know? And then, you know, Genon, like, all my friends were telling me, yo, like, just trust me, Taiki. Like, you don't need to understand. Like, goat is the doge, gnon is the shiba. Just, just believe, bro.
00:32:08.825 - 00:32:24.795, Speaker A: Just believe. And I was like, wait, what is Genon? He's like, oh, like, I, I, I don't know, but other people are shilling it, so I'm, I'm long. That, that's kind of like the, you know, like the logical thought, thought process that goes behind these coins. It's like, oh, yeah, like, it's pumping, bro. Like, just longer, bro.
00:32:25.095 - 00:32:28.063, Speaker B: Genon did go to 100 mil in, like a day.
00:32:28.119 - 00:32:29.519, Speaker A: Yeah, it blows my mind.
00:32:29.567 - 00:32:42.835, Speaker B: It was kind of shocking. I'm also, I, I'm waiting for this podcast to air, and then Jason is going to get all these Genon haters. Jason hates Genot, but he likes gold. I feel like that's gonna be the take.
00:32:42.875 - 00:32:44.179, Speaker A: Jason, you hate G on.
00:32:44.347 - 00:33:03.939, Speaker C: I'm gonna get so much hate mail. But at this point, I'm used to it. I do this podcast purely for my own entertainment, so if people want to on me, so be it. But I do think Gina reminds me a lot of, like, Milady. When I first told Milady, I'm sure you guys remember, like, the culture around Milady is so weird. Very esoteric. They talk about some, like, quasi intellectual stuff.
00:33:03.939 - 00:33:35.175, Speaker C: Very, very similar vibes to Genon, so, like, it kind of fits in. I hate drawing analogies because it always. There's always like, loss in translation if you analogize too much. But when I look at goat. And you think about the value that people ascribe to it, a part of which is this kind of like first move advantage, this provenance kind of being the first. It's kind of like crypto punks and then, you know, Genon, the kind of very esoteric culture, very kind of niche, kind of like Milady. So you definitely see kind of echoes of history playing over again and again.
00:33:35.175 - 00:33:56.307, Speaker C: And I was digging through the numbers. I think punk right now it's like 6x the value of like Milady. So it is still trading at a pretty big premium despite being like the older kind of brand. So yeah, maybe if this is the punk and the ladies of this meta, maybe we just got to be on the lookout for the bored apes of this meta. But for now, I have no idea what that that would look like.
00:33:56.411 - 00:34:05.775, Speaker B: I will say the bot that started Genon is like a pretty interesting Twitter account. It's like sometimes more funny than truth terminal even.
00:34:06.675 - 00:34:09.335, Speaker C: This is a lump. Yes.
00:34:09.955 - 00:34:36.770, Speaker A: It's a human. And I think the Genon idea is that it's like it's indifferent to humans surviving. Right? It's like this. It's like the Roko's Basilics, Basilisk and Accelerando of like, you know, at some point AI is going to take over the world. And so like, you know, why do we need humans? Or like it's kind of like some, that, like some variation of that idea. Honestly, I don't really understand it, so I'm not going to say too much. A question for Sanat.
00:34:36.770 - 00:35:02.255, Speaker A: You mentioned earlier that there's a lot of, you know, mid curve VC cope that couldn't participate in, you know, animal coins. Right. It's like, what is it going to take for a firm like Dragonfly to like buy something like a liquid meme coin? What is it going to take? Does it have to be super pure in the sense that AI launched it? Does it have to have some intellectual 130 IQ stuff narrative? What's it going to take?
00:35:02.635 - 00:35:37.623, Speaker B: I think the tricky thing, particularly for us is that we only do venture. We don't do any liquid really at this point, other than a very small pocket. It would actually be hard because it would almost require us to like reorient ourselves. Like we think of ourselves as like a group of people who like invest in people building crypto technology products and help them bring them to market. And like there's a universe where that's just like the incorrect thing to be doing. I still don't believe it is because I do it but like to in. To switch meme coins would be it almost.
00:35:37.623 - 00:36:12.745, Speaker B: To switch to buying meme coins feels like it would be like a total pivot. It almost feels like we wouldn't be doing what we do anymore. And I think the second most honest answer is that it's. We do have a couple of really high quality meme coin traders at Dragonfly, but for the most part, I don't think we'd be very good at it. We're like quite good at venture. And I really think the skill set is very different. I do expect to see more and more liquid funds in crypto open themselves up to this stuff because at some point, as long as you have adequate liquidity, that's all you kind of need.
00:36:12.745 - 00:36:35.437, Speaker B: The LP justification thing is pretty real. Like, I remember, I don't know when Jason and I worked together at a liquid fund. Once in a while we would have this conversation where we were like, I want to pitch this thing, but I can't talk about it for two hours. Like, I just think you'll go up for like XYZ stupid reason. But like I can't make a deck about it. And so you never, never pitch it. I know some nimble liquid funds are doing this stuff.
00:36:35.437 - 00:36:48.701, Speaker B: I think for us we'd be very, very far away just because we're like so focused on this venture game. I'm curious how you think, how you feel about this kind of stuff, Jason. Like how small, how small is the smallest thing you could buy?
00:36:48.733 - 00:37:24.677, Speaker C: You feel like, yeah, I mean, so, well, now I'm an independent angel, so I can buy whatever the fuck I want. But before I was a VC, so I kind of understand how VCs think. I think how VCs would respond to this. If this becomes more than a one week flash in the pan, like if this thing is still around when this episode releases in seven days, then VCs are going to start thinking about infrastructure. You know, what are the infrastructure things that we can bet that gives us an index exposure. So for instance, like pump fund, because VCs cannot buy meme coins, a lot of them are chasing like pump fund to invest in them. So in this case it's probably like infrastructure that allows you to create, kind of create agents.
00:37:24.677 - 00:38:09.825, Speaker C: So one way that we kind of front run this, not necessarily just for these agents because we got involved with this I think months ago, but we do hold some spec, which is Spectral. So Spectral used to be a defi project, so that's how we came to know them. But they've since pivoted, I think maybe a year or two ago into a platform for people to create AI agents. So they actually have a live thing called syntax where you can create very simple AI agents. I think they're going to add more functionality around it. We did an interview with the founder maybe one month or two months ago, but that was completely before this kind of AI agents thing really took off. So I think it's probably like projects like that that VCs will try to find to get exposure to AI meme coins if this continues to become a thing.
00:38:09.825 - 00:38:16.445, Speaker C: But I mean, if you're a prop guy or if you're an angel investor or independent investor, then there's no stopping them from buying any of these.
00:38:16.605 - 00:39:19.145, Speaker A: Yeah, and you can already see this in the market, right, where like, I think Radium has outperformed significantly in the past couple of weeks because most of these pump fund coins sit on Radium. There's also like a coin called Virtuals, which is where like the Luna token launched like the AI idol and like that like virtuals is up like 10x or something recently, in the past month or so. I don't know if the tokenomics make sense, honestly, but it's technically like the platform to launch AI coins and I think it's like a launchpad. Honestly, I don't really know how it works. I know you have to lock some virtual tokens, launch a coin, and every token that launches on the platform is paired with a virtual token. So in theory, if AI coins pumped in virtual might have some upward drift. I'm not sure if I haven't done too much analysis on this, so I'm not sure if it's cheaper, not cheap, but you can see that it's probably like these liquid funds that can't buy these coins, buying these because they can justify these things.
00:39:19.145 - 00:39:58.999, Speaker A: And you know, like for you, Jason, right? I mean, I talk, I, you know, I consider your co founder a friend and you know, he's also like buying, buying some coins. So, you know, there's like some, you know, personal stories of like all these defi traders. I mean, I don't think there was like a defi trader, but I know like other defi traders and they're like showing me goat. I was like, dude, like, where did this come from? So, you know, yeah, there's definitely a capital rotation happening here within retail degens and like liquid funds. Who knows? Like, maybe when Dragonfly buys a meme, like that's when we all sell. So synonym, he's like, all right, I'M buying this at 30 billion. It's going to 100.
00:39:58.999 - 00:40:01.871, Speaker A: It's like, all right, time to dump on his face.
00:40:02.063 - 00:40:23.431, Speaker C: This reminds me of when I bought into. There's this pretty big game, Defi Kingdoms at absolute pico. Top at a billion dollars. I think I bought it at 10 billion, actually. Oh, my God. Someone convinced me that 10 billion for this really shitty game is underpriced, and I believed it. So that was a top signal.
00:40:23.431 - 00:40:44.613, Speaker C: And we actually talked about. So Kyle Somati recently came on the show from Alcohol Capital, and one of their bets was loot last cycle. So we kind of did a postmortem of why they did that, did that loot. And he was pretty honest with it. It was just fomo. It was a lot of new things happening. Not a lot of time to really parse through where this is going.
00:40:44.613 - 00:40:59.705, Speaker C: So let's just get some exposure there. So we could probably see that. And then that would actually add to the NFT cycle analogy as well. When you get a big VC fund buying, like, goat or something, that's probably we're out of gas for a little bit. Unless something crazy happens with these AI agents.
00:41:01.005 - 00:41:01.709, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:01.837 - 00:41:31.451, Speaker C: And I feel like a big part of this also is that because it really sparks your imagination. Right. Because these AI agents can really do anything you want. So it's a little bit different from like the. I guess it's quite similar to the metaverse narrative, where at one point everyone in the market believed that everything would be moving on chain. You know, we'd be doing our company off sites, you know, on a metaverse. And it kind of reminds me of, like, the infinite potential that people are putting on AI agents as well.
00:41:31.451 - 00:41:58.695, Speaker C: Right. People are already saying that AI agents can completely replace the entire workforce. You know, they can. Or they can nuke cities and destroy society. So people are already thinking of these really, really out there type of implications, which is fueling part of the excitement. And I think that type of story, at the end of the day, tokens, are all just like narratives and stories. So this type of story seems to have struck a chord with all types of people, from freezies to traders to retails to developers and so on.
00:41:58.695 - 00:42:04.655, Speaker C: So, yeah. So I'm excited to see where this goes. Are there specific projects that you guys are tracking as well?
00:42:06.995 - 00:42:11.651, Speaker A: I mean, yes, but, like, I don't think I should talk about them because they're like micro caps.
00:42:11.843 - 00:42:13.171, Speaker C: Okay, okay. Probably not.
00:42:13.243 - 00:43:02.363, Speaker A: Yeah. But anyways, you know, I think Jason and I were talking before recording and, you know, you Were saying that this is like the first time that you've been like, this intellectually stimulated for a long time. And sometimes it's hard to justify why a meta is interesting, right? It's like, if you tell your wife, it's like, oh, like, yeah, this goat thing is like, really cool. Like, it's like, it doesn't really make any sense, but sometimes you just have to feel it, right? It's like, also for me, it's been like the first time in like two years or like, whatever that I've been like, this interested in like some new crypto thing. So if, if I feel that, if you feel that, then chances are everyone else in the industry feels that. And then you have to think about, okay, well, you know, will they allocate 1% to this portfolio, like, to these coins? And if the answer is yes, then you should try to front run whatever good coins are out there. Of course, it could just be a game of hot potato.
00:43:02.363 - 00:43:43.433, Speaker A: But new metas are new metas for a reason, right? You can't really explain why it's going up or why it's interesting. If it's easy to understand, then it would be solved. And there's no edge to be had because it's so difficult to understand what the hell is going on. There's so much edge to be had. So I think from that perspective, you know, if you're running a liquid fund or if you're like a retail degenerate, right, it's like there's like little edge to be buying VC coins right now, but there's so much edge to be had, like, trying to understand these stories and like, the lore behind some of these coins. You could all lose all your money, right? So I'm not saying you should, like, you know, yolo your net worth into this, but I think it's totally justifiable to put like, 1%, you know, like, I don't think. I don't think it's like, that crazy.
00:43:43.433 - 00:43:49.565, Speaker A: And if it goes to zero, it goes to zero, right? I mean, it's crypto. It is what it is, but you just have to kind of go with the gut sometimes.
00:43:50.225 - 00:44:25.183, Speaker C: Financial advice, guys at home, this is not financial advice. Don't come after us. But I think it's very interesting as well that you, As a DeFi OG in this space, you've been doing so much kind of, you know, investing and education in defi. And before we started recording, you mentioned that this is kind of like the YFI moment as well, right? The last time that you were intellectually stimulated, was like, WI fi came out. And I talked about how this is similar to, like, the NFT moments. So sign up for you. Is there, like, a moment in your past experiences with crypto that this current meta reminds you of, or is this just, like, completely new and, you know, doesn't seem like anything that is as.
00:44:25.183 - 00:44:29.415, Speaker C: As, like, consequential as like, the NFT meta or, like, the defi meta?
00:44:29.575 - 00:45:19.091, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm probably a little less excited than at least the two of you on this call. Like, I think it's cool, but to me, it's still, like, it doesn't feel magical enough. It's like, okay, there was an AI bot, it was tweeting and it mentioned some stuff, and someone created a word on its behalf. And I guess the, like, the cynic in me kind of does feel like the Meme Coin cycle is suddenly, like, if it's. I don't think it's over, but it's certainly, like, getting refined. And I think there were obviously very skilled players who kind of figured out ways to extract money very quickly from the ecosystem. And so I do think there's, like, an air of people just want a new game to play, and they're always kind of trying to figure out what's the next Meme Coin that could get big, what's the next pump fund that could go to 100 mil.
00:45:19.091 - 00:46:00.217, Speaker B: And in some sense, it feels like every week there's a flavor of the week. Like, we were excited by popcat for a while, and there's like, before then there was Billy. You are right. The dogs and cats seem to be good flavors, but to me, this feels more like a flavor of Meme Coin than it does like, some extraordinarily important moment for the history of AIX crypto. It just feels like, oh, this is the flavor of the week for Meme Coins. And, yeah, like you said, there's a new. It's like enough of a new meta that maybe there'll be some new experts, there'll be some new CT accounts that do their 0 to 3 million challenges from just being long, extraordinarily long AI coins at extremely low micro caps.
00:46:00.217 - 00:46:28.129, Speaker B: And then we're going to be like, oh, this is a new meta. But it does just feel to me like. Like my base case for this is, this is the flavor of the week for Meme Coins. Maybe this week, maybe for a few more weeks, and we'll have a new flavor of the week soon. But I'd be surprised if this is more than a flash in the pan for like a rewire. Like, I don't think this is like society being rewired or like some strong evidence that like crypto and AI have finally found product market fit or anything like that, really.
00:46:28.297 - 00:46:43.765, Speaker C: You need to watch Tai Chi's interview with Alex. Good, that one. So Alex, I think he was writing about agents long before this thing happened. I remember reading an article by him. I'm actually not familiar with his background. What was his background, Taki?
00:46:45.105 - 00:47:16.215, Speaker A: He used to do. He used to be a marketing expert. He used to run Google Ads, and he would be a professional trader in the sense that he would run Google Ads for keywords and if he could identify like certain keywords that was like gaining interest, he would long coins or stocks associated with it. So he had like a really interesting strategy, I think. I think he's like one of the smartest people that I that I know. And he's been super wired into the AI crypto, you know, meta for a long time. So a lot of my views stem come from like, you know, his writings.
00:47:16.215 - 00:47:27.525, Speaker A: But yeah, like super smart guy. He's building something. He's building something in the crypto space. His brother is also like building something. So he's like, he's in, you know. Yeah.
00:47:27.645 - 00:47:52.341, Speaker C: He wrote a blog post about AI agents. This is, I think many months ago that I included in the show notes below. But my first reaction to it was like, yeah, AI agents are not that interesting. I think Haseeb from Dragonfly also shared a same view on one of the episodes we did together, which is that what AI agents right now mostly are just like defi bots. Right. The most interesting examples people could offer was like, hey, go find me the best sources of yield. And it's more just like a trading bot.
00:47:52.341 - 00:48:26.535, Speaker C: But then now we're starting to see AI interact with social media and also bringing things on chain. And I think the reason why I feel like this is not a flavor of the week like Sana is suggesting is because guys like Taiki and I are getting excited as well. And I think it's very hard to excite guys like us. At least for myself, I've been very cynical because of, you know, getting caught in ftx, seeing Luna, seeing all this bullshit happening. And then past two years have just been kind of like, okay, there are like one or two interesting projects here and there. And then this is the first time I feel like, okay, this is like actually has societal implications. Like, what if agents take over? It's starting to spark conversations.
00:48:26.535 - 00:48:50.123, Speaker C: So I think the underrated aspect of this is actually the people will inspire. Right. If you see this AI agent thing kind of blowing up, getting a lot of attention, I think that's going to spark some developers somewhere to build something interesting tangentially. So I'm keeping my eyes peeled on this. Maybe we're moon boys. Maybe this is all going to zero by the time this comes out, but we'll see. But for the interest of time, I'd like to wrap us up here.
00:48:50.123 - 00:48:59.855, Speaker C: And Taki, for people who want to share, to want to follow you or look at your interview with Alex. Good. Or all of your content, what are the best channels for them to do this?
00:49:00.275 - 00:49:21.857, Speaker A: Yeah, so I mean, I have a YouTube channel. This is my name, Taiki Maeda. I do two podcasts. One's called Crypto Market Wizards where I focus or interview traders, get their thoughts. And I also do like a podcast called Steady Lads. It's like a weekly series every Friday, me, Justin, Jordy, and usually a guest just talk about what's happening in the markets. So.
00:49:21.857 - 00:49:28.725, Speaker A: And you know, I also post a lot on Twitter, right. So I'm internally online so you can find me anywhere.
00:49:29.145 - 00:49:50.987, Speaker C: I love that. I love that. Well, thank you so much guys for coming on and thank you for tuning in. Hey there, Jason here.
