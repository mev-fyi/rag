00:00:01.200 - 00:00:26.034, Speaker A: Yeah. So the exchange is going to have its own separate brand, but it will still definitely be within the ribbon ecosystem. It's still like TBD on token plan. So I don't want to jump the gun there, but, yeah, I mean, we are not launching this as a non side project. This is part of the ribbon product suite. And we think, for example, there can be a lot of very nice synergies. For example.
00:00:26.034 - 00:00:54.904, Speaker A: Yeah. What if we own the Dov and exchange? We can just set our Dov fees to zero forever and just starve all our other competitors, because that is their core business. That's the only thing that generates revenue for them. But now we have so many other sources of revenue from the lending business, from the exchange, we can just set these things to be loss leaders. We think the ribbon suite of products actually work well together in a business setting.
