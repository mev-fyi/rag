00:00:41.544 - 00:00:44.888, Speaker A: Brought to you by Protocol Labs, the guys behind Filecoin.
00:00:44.976 - 00:00:46.616, Speaker B: And with me today is Colin Efrin.
00:00:46.640 - 00:00:53.084, Speaker A: Who leads ecosystem at protocol labs. So, Colin, can you give us a brief state of the Filecoin ecosystem today?
00:00:53.424 - 00:01:31.534, Speaker C: So, Filecoin is almost 15 exabytes of storage capacity and 463 petabytes of real storage storage data. And if you take all of web3 storage protocols, Filecoin powers 99% of total storage capacity and 95% of storage utilization. In 2000, 270 thousand developers were exposed to filecoin through our various hackathon partnerships, and 500 startups are actively building on Filecoin, ranging from series seed funding to series d funding. In aggregate, they've raised about 500 million in capital and continue to grow into 2023.
00:01:31.624 - 00:01:32.138, Speaker A: Hello there.
00:01:32.186 - 00:01:44.178, Speaker B: Now, before I move on, I'd love to thank the hundreds of you who have subscribed to blockchain. Because with your support, I've been able to share my real thoughts on specific projects that I don't usually share on interviews in a format that I enjoy.
00:01:44.226 - 00:01:46.322, Speaker A: More, which is bi weekly written posts.
00:01:46.418 - 00:02:05.704, Speaker B: We've also been able to offer exclusive AMA's, sharing my investment frameworks, interactable models, and breaking down important trends before they become big. Now, we even had Elon Musk comment on one of our threads recently.

00:02:06.524 - 00:02:08.852, Speaker A: Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode.
00:02:08.868 - 00:02:10.052, Speaker B: Of the Blockcrench podcast.
00:02:10.108 - 00:02:44.024, Speaker A: Now, this week I'm really, really excited to talk with the founder behind one of the most anticipated play to earn games in crypto. Or maybe play to earn isn't even the right label anymore, so we're going to talk about that later. But this is one of the few games that I'm genuinely excited to play myself, and if someone asked me to describe what it is, I'd probably say it's kind of Pokemon plus Zelda, plus Decentraland, plus axie. But it's also much more than just that. So to talk about one of the most awaited games in crypto, Illuvium, I'm really excited to have Kieran, the founder of Illuvium, on the show. And as a disclaimer, I am an angel investor in Illuvium as well. So welcome to the show, Kieran.
00:02:44.564 - 00:02:46.824, Speaker D: Thanks, Jason. Always good to be here.
00:02:47.164 - 00:02:55.304, Speaker A: Definitely. So let's kick us off from the beginning. So how did you decide to start Illuvium? Like, did you grow up playing games? What kind of games did you play?
00:02:56.164 - 00:03:46.932, Speaker D: So we grew up, well, I grew up in a household with three brothers, and so we were always super competitive. Our dad was into computers really early on. Unfortunately, we only had Macs to work with, so the games that we had were quite limited. But we always had Atari, Nintendo, and we were essentially just always playing games as we were growing up. And we continued that through our teens and then into our early twenties and stuff like that. It got a little bit when I was, I started my first business, I think, when I was 23. And as a lot of people would know, when you, when you're doing a startup, it takes almost all of your time.
00:03:46.932 - 00:04:47.630, Speaker D: So room for gaming was sort of limited, but I always found some time, you know, during the week to either play League of Legends or like FIFA or just more so just games casually with, with friends. But how I got to starting alluvium was I was in crypto back in 2016, and I went pretty heavily into Ethereum, but I didn't have a very good experience. I ended up losing quite a bit of money. I was trading with leverage and it just a small swing down and it didn't end up well. And then that was at like $8 or something, and then it ended up pumping to like a hundred. And I was just, I was very, very scared. And so I left the ecosystem and I didnt return until about early 2020.
00:04:47.630 - 00:05:45.664, Speaker D: And thats when things really started to kick off. It was what they call the defi summer. And I was investing and I was making quite a bit of money doing yield farming projects, every single food coin in existence. Im getting in early. And, uh, but it wasn't enough, right? Like, I still had that entrepreneurship in me and I really wanted to start something of my own. And so I started pitching my oldest brother, Cain, who runs synthetix. And, uh, it wasn't until I stumbled upon axie infinity that I was like, oh, my God, okay, there's this huge opportunity with nfts inside of gaming and then utilizing the blockchain and introducing things like decentralized governance and stuff like that.
00:05:45.664 - 00:06:08.324, Speaker D: And that's when I went to my two other brothers who just happened to fit the mold of one being an exceptional CGI artist, top of his field, and the other one being an exceptional game designer. And so it sort of just all fell into place from there and we started.
00:06:09.114 - 00:06:21.054, Speaker A: That's awesome. Actually, I totally thought that illuvium started before Axie because I remember seeing the initial fundraising round before I saw the Axie round. But it sounds like that's not the case. It sounds like Axie came first.
00:06:21.674 - 00:06:45.424, Speaker D: Axie definitely came first. Well, Axie was around for a couple of years. It was, it was. I think 2018 is when they actually started. But you're talking like 500 players, like very, very small player base. But it wasn't. And even when I found it, it wasn't like it was pumping.
00:06:45.424 - 00:07:24.834, Speaker D: Like, I bought my mystic land for like $300 or so, much like that. I got in very, very early because I was doing 20, 30 hours of just pure research on projects every single week. And when I found that, I just had this feeling that if people got around this, uh, this, this play to earn model and this ownership inside of games, regardless of the fact that it wasn't the most compelling game to me, it was just the concept was so good that, uh, I, I just had to try and build something in the space.
00:07:25.254 - 00:07:58.404, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And it's funny that you mention your brother Kane as well, because he was on this show three years ago to debate none other than SPF. So we've come time truly, truly has passed. And I love to kind of pivot and talk about illuvium because over the past few years of development, you finally reached a private beta for the 3d open world called Overworld. And I think you guys also successfully raised $72 million from its metaverse land sale. I think I sold 20,000 plots of virtual land, so there's a lot to cover there. But for newcomers first, what exactly is illuvium? And, you know, what can people do with it?
00:07:58.994 - 00:08:49.946, Speaker D: So it's an interoperable blockchain game. And so what that essentially means is a whole set of games that are, in our case, different genres of games that are all interconnected. So your journey first starts in alluvium Zero, which is like a city builder game, similar to like Sim City, sort of like command and conquer without the battles yet. And so you're, you're trying to build up your industrial complex, to be able to extract fuel from your land. And that fuel is what is required inside of the overworld. Now, the overworld, that's your open world. It's got seven different regions, all beautiful, different diverse biomes.
00:08:49.946 - 00:10:09.820, Speaker D: And that's your creature capturer style game, where there's 185 different creatures that we call alluvials that you need to capture. And in order to capture them, you need things like shards, and you need to be able to travel. And all of those functions inside the Overworld requires that fuel that landowners extract from their complex, their industrial complex. Then once you've gathered enough alluvials, and you're happy with the team that you've created, that's when you go and you battle them in PvP arenas, and you try and get to the top of the leaderboards, you try and have one on one battles, and you basically are utilizing the same nfts that you got in the overworld, that is the alluvials inside of the arena. And so it's all seamlessly interconnected. And all of the nfts work throughout the different games. And it's this platform, or universe where we plan to, we first have these three games, but any game that we build on top will live inside of this universe.
00:10:09.820 - 00:10:19.624, Speaker D: And we're trying to create an IP that is similar to the likes of like a Mario or Pokemon or League of Legends and stuff like that.
00:10:20.164 - 00:10:56.814, Speaker A: Got it. I did check out recently the beta for the open world, and it looks incredible. And even if I didn't invest objectively as a console gamer, it looked amazing. So listeners, if you're listening to this on audio format, you can go check it out on YouTube, just search for Illuvium Overworld and you can check out the full gameplay demo. And I'm really curious, because we were talking about this before we started recording as well, how much it takes to ship a AAA title, because I've seen budgets that go from a few million dollars and teams of six developers to hundreds of millions and hundreds of developers. So can you kind of give a rough sense of just like what it took to build this kind of interoperable world?
00:10:57.354 - 00:12:01.296, Speaker D: Yeah. So we in total have raised about 50 million from pre seed to seed to our TGE events, which was through balancer to our land sale. And we've used up about, I would say like 65, 70%, but we're very, very near the finish line of being able to open it up. So a substantial amount of development costs has gone into it around about 30 to 35 million at this point. In terms of what it takes from a resourcing standpoint, usually I would say like a team of 300 to 400 people in a typical studio. Now we've done it with, I think at our peak we had about 220 in total across all the different departments. Now we've optimized our team and we've scaled it back a little bit and we've got around 160.
00:12:01.296 - 00:13:21.608, Speaker D: But the difference that we have is we don't have any junior developers or junior artists in our team. Like we've literally only got seniors and above. And the reason is we don't have the ability to train people up and like a normal studio does. We've literally got a very, very sharp timeline that we need to adhere to and get the game out. And so we've, our recruiting has been really important to get the right people, poach them from studios where they were leads or department heads, or at the very least senior developers that have 1015 years experience in designing games, building games, doing the art for games, doing the tech for games. And so we've been able to build out three AAA games faster and more efficiently than your traditional studio where people come into work, they work nine to five, they've got a boss and a boss and a boss. And there's something to be said as well about what I call a decentralized studio as well.
00:13:21.608 - 00:13:24.604, Speaker D: I think they're much more efficient than typical companies.
00:13:25.354 - 00:14:12.984, Speaker A: That's quite interesting. And before we dive into the actual game and the token economy itself, I'm really curious because as an investor I've always almost shied away from investing in games because of how much capital resources it takes and the fact that it's quite different from startups where you have a team of five developers, you build a very simple product, you ship it, you see if anyone bites and you iterate from that. But then for games, it seems like you really only get one shot to launch a big game. You can't just built on top of the game. And there have been examples of like AAA titles that launch before they're fully finished and that never ended really well. So I'm curious as a founder, how do you navigate that? Like how do you know that, hey, this is the game that we should be shipping, this is ready versus, hey, the traditional startup where you have a more iterative approach.
00:14:13.404 - 00:15:53.458, Speaker D: Look, I actually think that web3, because we're so early in terms of the gaming side of web3, I actually think it's more forgiving than people think. And it probably is one of those things that we could learn from in terms of shipping things a little bit sooner and maybe they're not as polished, maybe they don't have as much balance or whatever, but just getting it in the hands of people because there's this first mover advantage which I still think we have in terms of the AAA category. But at the same time, theres always a part of me that thinks, hey, if we had released things a little bit earlier, would we have caught the upside of the market at the end of last year? But then at the same time I also think, well then what did people received it and theyre like, hey, this is not AAA. You promised this and we lose this. I don't know if there's a right or wrong answer there, but I would definitely say it's not as cutthroat as what a mainstream game is, where you have that one shot, all of the marketing goes into it and if you release that and it's not up to par, it's not up to the standards that you put in your, your gameplay trailers and stuff like that, you just get eaten alive and you know, you turn into the next cyberbug. But yes, you're right. So navigating through that has been a little bit difficult.
00:15:53.458 - 00:16:49.014, Speaker D: And obviously we originally probably naively promised that we would get something out in open beta form on the blockchain where people can play in the first twelve months and it's probably going to end up being 24 months before that actually happens. But the amount of scope that we've added to this project is pretty insane. I would say it's probably doubled since, since we first wrote that white paper. So it's not too bad when you consider that. But at the same time, I do think how many investors have we lost? Because attention spans in web3 seem to be very, very short compared to mainstream, where they're like, well, AAA games do take five, six, seven years, so we're sweet if you delay it by only twelve months, you know?
00:16:49.434 - 00:17:05.134, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely, definitely. And I'd love to dive into the actual game itself because, you know, many web3 games out there, when I look at the actual gameplay, honestly, you know, many of them can exist without blockchain elements. So can alluvium exist as a non crypto game?
00:17:05.854 - 00:17:46.014, Speaker D: Yeah, and, and that's the interesting thing, right? You have the ability to go through and start your journey alluvium. You can play alluvium zero for free, it doesn't cost you anything. You don't have to have land you can go and start playing. Obviously you, you can't generate fuel, which is the, the asset which potentially has value, but you can go in. We're, we're already talking about putting a demo on Steam where people can go and play that game and it has nothing crypto related or attached. Right now it's literally just another city builder. Same thing with the overworld.
00:17:46.014 - 00:18:41.146, Speaker D: You have the ability to go in there and capture these tier zero alluvials that don't cost you anything. They are still NFTs because we, we didn't want people to feel like, hey, I don't have ownership over these assets, but doesn't cost you anything to go to a tier zero region. Doesn't cost you anything for a tier zero shard. You can cure them without any, any money being laid out. And same thing with the arena, right? You can then go and take those tier zeros that you caught for nothing and you can start battling with those tier zeros. So you can try all of our three games right now and this will continue on with every single game that we build in the future. And we think that that's critical in order to have this mainstream adoption that everyone is really gutting for.
00:18:41.146 - 00:19:03.404, Speaker D: You can't have barriers to entry like Axie did where it was like $900 to start playing. And then you get in and you're like, you know what? I don't even know if I want to play this game. What do I do with these creatures? Then you sell them and potentially lose money. That sort of experience is very lackluster for just your typical gamer.
00:19:04.264 - 00:19:21.232, Speaker A: And in terms of the actual activity in the games, it seems like the primary means of monetizing now for illuvium as a company is through land sales and NFT sales. But over the long term, is that the primary means for illuvium to become sustainable or are there other ways to monetize? No.
00:19:21.288 - 00:20:25.564, Speaker D: So the interesting thing is that there are revenue sinks that are built in across the all three games, right? So in Alluvium Zero's case, we've got people who are like, I want to purchase another builder because they want to build things faster. And that's a potential where we say it's going to cost you x amount of ETH in order to do that, in terms of speeding buildings up, that costs energy. And when I first got into illuvium Zero, I was like, God, I can't wait ten minutes for this building. So, so it's, and if you think about it like those mobile games, where it's like, wait ten minutes or spend a dollar to speed it up. That's the, the monetization in alluvium zero. Then in the overworld, if you want to generate, if you want to go and collect tier one, tier two, tier three, the stronger alluvials outside of the free tier zeros, you need to go into regions where it'll cost you a little bit of ETH to travel there. It'll cost you a little bit of ETH to cure shards.
00:20:25.564 - 00:21:10.972, Speaker D: It will cost you a little bit of e to fuse alluvials, which means getting three of the same alluvial at the same stage. You can fuse them together, which burns three nfts in a deflationary mechanism and will give you one stronger stage two of that alluvial. But again, that costs a little bit of eat. So all of these transactions are built into the overworld. And then things like tournaments and leviathan battles where you go up against people. There's fees that are incurred with that as well. And you might think, and maybe the listeners are thinking, whoa, there's just muddy sinks everywhere.
00:21:10.972 - 00:21:52.458, Speaker D: Like, what's the deal with that? That's insane. But this is where the decentralized economy and studio comes into play. Because baked into our tokenomics are revenue distributions. So what that essentially means is all of the monies that go into all of these games, all of the fees that are generated through skins as well, which if you think about like fortnight, that's their main revenue generator. We have skins as well. They cost a little bit of money. All of these different fees go inside of a vault.
00:21:52.458 - 00:22:51.444, Speaker D: And the vault every so often we did, we do it randomly, will then purchase ILB back off the market, and then we'll distribute that IlV proportionally based on how much you have staked in the protocol. So essentially we're distributing all of the revenues that the game makes back to the people, right? The people who invested it, which makes it more. When you think about from an investor's standpoint, it makes it much more palatable when you're thinking about this b generation. Because in a typical video game, Fortnite's making billions of dollars of revenue every single year. That goes straight back to the publisher. It doesn't go back to the people. And so that's why we've introduced this pretty crazy tokenomics.
00:22:51.444 - 00:23:13.514, Speaker D: I'm pretty excited to see what all of that in game stuff does, because the intention is not for us to go and do NFT sales and make our revenue that way. It's to create a very balanced economy that is real world, that is literally sustainable by players wanting to play because they want to have fun.
00:23:14.214 - 00:23:49.804, Speaker A: And I like that you brought up the point about distributing fees generated in the game's users, because my next question was actually about user generated experiences. Because when I look at a lot of these metaverse projects, even in web two, like Minecraft and Roblox, and now in web3 like Decentraland and Sandbox, a lot of the in game experiences and assets are actually user generated versus for Illuvium, it seems like a lot of the initial games and experiences and creatures are going to be developed by the team. So over the long term, is the team going to be developing most of the experiences, or would you encourage users to build stuff as well?
00:23:50.224 - 00:25:15.144, Speaker D: So it's a good question, and the answer right now is we are going to keep it internal. And the reason is the standard that we have from our team in building out these assets and things like regions and maps and battle boards and skins and all of the stuff that you would typically potentially outsource as user generated content. It's at a level where you really need to be an expert studio in order to be able to create the stuff. And what we don't want is a world where a user generated battle board is nowhere near the quality of the ten that we've created. Or there's this new region where you can go into and you're kind of like, whoa, that's like a 2d world instead of our beautiful 3d world. And so I guess we're never ruling it out, right? Like, it's obviously something that speaks to decentralization and it's something that can, if done correctly, can really take some of the load off your internal team and can be monetized, whole bunch of really positive things. But unless it's done correctly, it would just, it would almost seem weird inside of our universe, if that makes sense.
00:25:15.784 - 00:25:43.924, Speaker A: Yeah, because I did notice that some of those discussions have kind of started to happen on the discord, I think a few weeks or a few months ago. There's discussion about should the proceeds from the land sale go to stakers or the team? And that ties into the broader question about should illuvium be considered like a community owned game, or is this a game with a community aspect, but still kind of essentially developed team? Like, what is the long term vision for illuvium in the crypto context?
00:25:44.314 - 00:26:33.844, Speaker D: Definitely community owned. So in our first land sale, that 72 million that got distributed back to the community and that was the first time that we demonstrated revenue distributions and you can literally go into, and that's what I think people are really excited about. Because if you go back to when Axie was at its peak, it's generating like $100 million a month, right? I think there were three months that it did that. Now there's only 10 million potential ILV. We've already burned about two and a half percent, so slightly less than that. But there's only that many ILB tokens in circulation. So if you have an ILB and you have it staked, you're going to earn your portion of distributions.
00:26:33.844 - 00:27:03.414, Speaker D: And if anything, if we're anywhere close to, to what axiom is generating, then it's obviously going to be, I believe, I mean potential fitting, very, very profitable for investors. And when I say investors, I mean community members as well, right? Like our community of 200,000 people, a lot of those, a large portion of those people are invested in ILV.
00:27:03.974 - 00:27:34.874, Speaker A: And speaking of the token, I do want to talk about the token economy because I think when Illuvium first launches token, it was launched with a lot of liquidity incentives for, I think almost a year before the game went live. And even in this market, I think liquidity providers for the ILV ETH pool are still earning like 60% to 70%. So I guess first, what was the decision behind launching a token first? And in hindsight do you think founders that are trying to take lessons from this, should they also launch tokens first and then game second or flip it around?
00:27:35.614 - 00:28:22.394, Speaker D: Look, we used it as a capital raising vehicle and it was the only way that we were able to. I mean if, if you have $50 million lying around, then don't launch a token first. Definitely go and, and, or if you want to do a saft and then a safe and release the token later and you, you have investors that want to buy into that. The problem with that is it's not going to be decentralized. In order to do those sort of agreements you need to have a corporate entity. Whereas how we raised our initial money is we literally said we're a dao and we've got this pre ILV token out there. There's 5000 holders of that.
00:28:22.394 - 00:29:16.974, Speaker D: And if you want, and the pre ILV was eventually converted into ILV. But we basically said without any agreements whatsoever, if you want to purchase some ILB tokens in this sale, you hand over your money and we will send you the tokens. That was, it was one of the largest raises at the time that was done that way without any sort of agreement, and it made sure that before we'd even received capital that we were truly decentralized, which I think has massive, massive advantages. When you're talking about our projects, really a dow, are they decentralized or is it just this guy in front of a corporate entity? We can truly show and demonstrate that we are decentralized.
00:29:17.594 - 00:29:25.174, Speaker A: That makes sense. I guess the high inflationary rewards in the beginning was mostly as a quicker way to distribute the tokens out as soon as possible.
00:29:26.514 - 00:30:15.670, Speaker D: Well, it was a three year program, but what we wanted to do, the reason we had such a large portion, 30%, as liquidity mining, is a we wanted a large amount of liquidity in the protocol, and we achieved that. Weve been the largest liquidity pool on sushi for the last, like 18 months. So we achieved that. But we also wanted to efficiently distribute tokens in the most decentralized way. So we now have like 28,000 ILB holders. And so when youre talking about, like, who owns most of the ILB, its very, very heavily distributed across many, many jurisdictions. So again, speaking to that Dao first.
00:30:15.782 - 00:30:53.864, Speaker A: Model, I really like this discussion because it's such an interesting trade off. The founders have to make either you decentralize as quickly as possible and dedicate a lot to inflationary rewards and get that liquidity, or you retain as many tokens as possible to create a massive war chest. But maybe you don't have any liquidity and people can't even interact with it. I think that's such an interesting decision the founders will have to make, and I'm sure there's a lot of lessons they can learn from this. And speaking of the token side, you guys decided to build on immutable x as well. So I'm curious, you know, what was the rationale behind that? You guys tried building on other chains first, and how did you guys arrive at that?
00:30:54.164 - 00:32:02.804, Speaker D: So we never wanted to, it was never an option to build on any other side. Chain security is paramount for us, and we also wanted to build where a the devs work, but be where the people were and where the money, the main driver of money inside of crypto was. So with that, we obviously looked at Ethereum first, and it just wasn't feasible. The transaction times for a game of the type of game that we were building was just never going to work. We needed sub second transaction times and we needed gasless transactions. And so we went on this search, and it was lucky because it was right when l two started getting a little bit of traction. We went to Kane because he had a lot of the contacts in the space and we said, look, we're thinking about, we're now at a point where we're about to choose which l two we go on.
00:32:02.804 - 00:32:41.722, Speaker D: Can you give us some introductions? We did some research. We looked at like, first, obviously the side chains like Matic at the time, or Polygon now and a bunch of other ones. But we eventually said, no, we're going to go l two on Ethereum. And he introduced us to optimism. What didn't work with optimism was the latency of withdrawing your capital. And at the time, I think it's a bit better now. I think it's down to like five to seven days to withdraw from l two.
00:32:41.722 - 00:33:24.510, Speaker D: But it was that experience. Once again, when you're talking about trying to onboard millions of people that don't care about the blockchain side of it, they're just coming to play a fun game. You can't then say to them, hey, its going to take a day, two days for your assets to reach the l two where you can start playing. And then if you decide to leave, its going to take a week or two weeks, I think at the time. So optimism was out. And then we looked at ZkSync, but they just werent far enough along in their build so we ended up moving away from them. And eventually we found immutable.
00:33:24.510 - 00:34:16.866, Speaker D: And the thing that we really liked was that they had the experience of building gods unchained. Not many people know that thats where they started. And the frustration of building gods unchained on Ethereum led them to start building immutable x which all of the pain points that they had across when, when building gods unchained they decided to fix with starkware. And so they built a system that we worked with them from early 2020 and they were already like 18 months into their build. There are a whole bunch of stuff that we needed that they hadn't actually built yet. And so we were able to work very closely with them. They're actually australian as well.
00:34:16.866 - 00:35:05.186, Speaker D: So when I say close, I mean like in proximity as well, which was a big help. And they really understood what we were trying to build and we understood what they were trying to build. And so it was a partnership where it just, we were always going to do whatever it took to make sure that it works. Because I think immutable new. If we can launch alluvium and have a marquee game that really showcases all of the, the ability of our platform, then a lot of other games are going to come across. And from our standpoint, we knew that if immutable would understand that, then they're going to do whatever's required. And we've asked for some pretty crazy stuff.
00:35:05.186 - 00:35:31.232, Speaker D: They've had to put a whole massive amount of devs onto just purely building our staff. Like with the land sale being minting that on l two very, very prematurely in their build. Well, these were all things where they really dedicated themselves to our project. So yeah, it's just been a really, really good partnership and we're super happy that we worked with them and kind.
00:35:31.248 - 00:35:53.304, Speaker A: Of moving away from the product, from the token, from the infrastructure. And the last part, I'd love to ask a little bit about the growth side of stuff. So you mentioned kind of building an experience that could onboard millions of users. So I'm very curious, like in terms of finding your first, say like 10,000 users, what was that process like and how would that differ for the first, say like 10 million users?
00:35:54.324 - 00:36:55.476, Speaker D: So we took an approach of tapping into, when we first started, gaming was so new inside of crypto that there wasn't a gaming market, right, like you axie at that time had, I think, you know, 30,000 players or something like that. And we were talking, we want numbers of millions. So what we decided to do is tap into DeFi protocols because theres a connection between, I would say, Internet users, crypto users. Most people like gaming as well, right? Its just inherently built into the types of people that we are. And so I knew that if we went after DeFi organizations and protocols a that's where a lot of the money is. But at that time, it was more about seeding our liquidity and getting. Showing that we're a really, really strong game early on.
00:36:55.476 - 00:37:57.924, Speaker D: And so I wanted to capture those, those larger whales, if you will, inside of the DeFi protocols. So we ended up doing a NFT drop where we made some pretty special custom artwork that we partnered up with like one inch and Synthetix Suji. We did one chainlink, we did one and a whole bunch of other protocols that had like 50 to 100,000 people in their discord. And the aim was to get five to 10,000 of their community members to come across into the illuvium discord. And we ran this for about four months and we got to about 80,000 people in our discord in the first four months, which was insane. I would speak to Kate about this and he's like, are you kidding me? Like, we've been here for three years. But so that was our growth hacking strategy in the beginning.
00:37:57.924 - 00:39:10.004, Speaker D: That obviously isn't going to work to get to millions of people. So our plan to reach the masses once we get to open beta is to start tapping into the communities where there are already players playing the types of games that we're building. So we'll go after Clash of Clans players when you talk about Alluvium Zero. We'll go after Pokemon players when you talk about the overworld, and we'll go after League of Legends players when you talk about the auto battle. So we have, it's somewhere in the vicinity of about 150,000,010 in terms of our addressable market inside of the three genres that we're building. And that's going to be, we're going to tap into them through a range of different things, esports, tournaments, influencers, all sorts of like competitions and giveaways and things like that. But fundamentally, having a good game, right, like having a fun game for them to go, for people for word of mouth to actually be able to spread.
00:39:10.004 - 00:40:13.214, Speaker D: Because I say this all the time, there isn't a single FPS, for example, right now where you can go, I love, like we sit here, we're in this bubble inside of crypto and we love it so much and we're like, hey, but owning your gun inside of this first person shooter, imagine if you could do that, that would make it so much better. Or this skin that you bought or whatever. But if you go outside of that bubble, they don't care about any of those things. They care about predominantly fun. Now, if the ancillary benefit are there and owning your skin plus it's just as fun exists, then that's a better experience overall. But there isn't a single game where you can say, hey, put down fortnite or Call of Duty or any of these larger AAA games because your friends will just go, no, like look at the graphics of that or look at the gameplay of that, or look at how janky that is. Like, none of like, I'm, you're living in a crazy world.
00:40:13.214 - 00:40:34.794, Speaker D: I'm not living in that. And were trying to be the first game where people can genuinely say no, like play this game and tell me that it isn't as good as the games that you're used to, except you actually have ownership inside of these. That's what we're trying to do. And I think that's going to spread like wildfire.
00:40:35.214 - 00:40:56.284, Speaker A: And speaking of spread, I'd love to ask about the distribution platforms as well, because I think one thing that was surprising to me for Axie is that it showed that a majority of the users for them were mobile based, which was really surprising because most of the wallet users are totally desktop based. I don't remember the last time I signed something on mobile metamask. So for alluvium, how do you think about mobile versus desktop?
00:40:57.344 - 00:41:24.232, Speaker D: So that was a big eye opener for us as well. Our types of games. You can play auto battlers on mobile, but they're predominantly played on desktop. Overworld, in a creature capture. If you're not playing it on a console, then you're playing it on a PC or a Mac. Right. That's typical, just because of the expansiveness of the entire regions and stuff like that.
00:41:24.232 - 00:42:09.896, Speaker D: It's very hard to condense that onto mobile. Then we had Alludium Zero, which was built using unity and was always planned to be a mobile game. And we launched that and we're seeing higher player numbers on that than any other game. And I've just gone, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh my God. Okay, this is a huge eye opener, and I think it has to do with a lot of players coming from like Philippines and South America and these developing nations that don't have access to a high powered pc or a Mac. And so the only chance that they have to play these games is on mobile and obviously casual games.
00:42:09.896 - 00:42:55.624, Speaker D: And the convenience of being able to just whip out your phone and start playing is obviously very appealing. But that's certainly been one of the big learnings from this alpha and beta release of all of these games is we need to get all of our games to mobile as soon as possible. Right? Like there's this. Just such a significant portion of the market is mobile based, that with Alluvium Zero and with the arena on mobile, I think we'll be okay. It's gotta be a couple of years before we can get the overworld ported over to mobile, but we have to focus on those two games getting to mobile as soon as possible.
00:42:56.374 - 00:43:20.234, Speaker A: That's definitely a really interesting insight. I don't think a few years ago if you said we should build a mobile for crypto products, people will call you crazy. But now it seems so obvious in hindsight. I'd love to wrap up the interview by asking in terms of maybe one or two things that players or prospective players should be excited about. What are some dates that they should mark down on the calendars so that they can check out maybe new drops or new developments, new launches?
00:43:20.934 - 00:43:51.796, Speaker D: Yeah. So a little bit, which is probably going to end up being our fourth game. It'll be. It'll be a card type game that we're currently building right now. Right now, it's only collections that's going to come out, I would say midway through March to be safe there. That's going to be a really exciting launch. Then the entire gaming universe is going to open up.
00:43:51.796 - 00:44:24.838, Speaker D: In open beta, we've got something like 1.8 million people that have registered. When you include all the different types of games. We're opening it up to all of those players all at once midway through this year. So, like, the culmination of two years of like 200 people putting in hundreds of hours a week is all ending up at this point midway through the year. I'm really excited to check that out.
00:44:24.886 - 00:44:32.238, Speaker A: And for users or for listeners who want to follow you or follow illuvium and stay up to date, what are the best channels for them to do this?
00:44:32.406 - 00:44:51.324, Speaker D: So I always say, join the discord. We do lots of. There's obviously lots of education there. Our moderating team, exceptional. There's like 20 of them that are in there. Different language mods if you're not a english native speaker. And that's.
00:44:51.324 - 00:45:18.262, Speaker D: That's really where your journey should start. I would register for the alphas and the betas. We're going to continually expand how many people we've let into those games as we move into the open beta and then follow us on Twitter. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm. I'm pretty active on there. Sometimes I'm trolling people, sometimes I'm giving leaks and stuff like that. But I try and keep it a little bit fun.
00:45:18.262 - 00:45:21.990, Speaker D: But yeah, they're definitely the channels that I would check out.
00:45:22.142 - 00:45:34.534, Speaker A: Definitely. I will include those in the show notes below. Well, Kieran, thank you so much for coming on the show. It's been really exciting to learn more about alluvium and I really encourage people to go check it out as well. I'm really excited for the launch. Thanks for coming on.
