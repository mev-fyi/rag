Now, before we get started with today's episode, I've got some great news for you. Now, a lot of you have been asking for how I analyze projects that I bring on the show.
00:00:46.296 - 00:01:32.090, Speaker C: That's why I decided to create blockchains VIP to share with you all the heavy research that goes on behind the scenes. Now, every week or so, our team prepares an in depth research memo with things like sector analysis, technical concepts made simple, in depth competitor breakdown, and even interactive models so you can learn about the most important projects before they become important. And our team is putting in hours every week, scouring discord, twitter, forums and blogs to help you get an edge in crypto and understand the latest projects and themes at the deepest levels. That goes way beyond just an interview. Now, in addition, we'll also host exclusive AMA's with myself to answer any of your questions. So all of these are only available to blockcrunch VIP subscribers. And the good news is that while our interviews will always be free, the VIP tier costs less than one coffee a day.
00:01:32.090 - 00:01:38.134, Speaker C: So head on over to theblockcrunch.com VIP or click the link in the show notes below to sign up.
00:01:40.274 - 00:02:14.466, Speaker A: Hey everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the podcast. Now, this is a very special episode because this is a cold production between Blockcrunch and Hodlong, which is a podcast you should definitely check out if you haven't already. And today with me, I have my two good friends, Darryl and also Mabel. So all of us are part of the angel fund called Tangent, and we are all at a very interesting point in our career right now, where we all kind of recently stepped down from pretty prominent funds in crypto to pursue our respective ventures. And we're going to talk about that in a bit. So this is very much a free flowing conversation with two of the smartest people I know in this space.
00:02:14.466 - 00:02:20.462, Speaker A: So I'm really, really excited for this, but I'll pass it on to Mabel first in case you want to kind of say anything to your audience as well.
00:02:20.658 - 00:02:41.194, Speaker D: Thank you, Jason. Thank you. Yeah, this is my first time doing co branded production as well. I'll just say a very brief intro. Thank you for coming back to the latest episode hotline. This is Mabel Zhang, your host, and then we have co host Jason Choi here to join us. Shall we run a very quick round of intro for ourselves, or how should we do this?
00:02:41.894 - 00:02:45.114, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it. Why don't you guys go first? Daryl, you want to go first?
00:02:45.454 - 00:03:15.844, Speaker E: Yeah. So my name is Darryl. I'm currently a co founder of Tangent along with Jason. So everybody here is sort of like family. Previously, before this, I was a principal at Defiance Capital, where. Which is one of the largest asian based crypto funds alongside Spartan, so. And really helped build out the team there for the better part of 18 months and left to start Tangent with Jason in sort of March or April of 2022.
00:03:17.204 - 00:03:38.424, Speaker D: Cool. I'll go next. Hi, everyone. I'm Mabel Zhang. I'm currently the chief revenue officer at stepn, and also I'm a mentor at Tangent, which is what Darrell and Jason right now is full time working on. Before stepn, I was a GP at Multicon Capital. Very excited to have some, I guess, chit chat today with two of my friends here.
00:03:39.644 - 00:04:09.374, Speaker A: Yeah. And for listeners of the show, you know me already. My name is Jason. I used to be a general partner at a fund called Spartan Capital and recently stepped down to start Tangent with Darryl. And we're really, really excited to bring on board Mabel as one of our six very experienced mentors as well. So why don't we jump right into it now? I think a lot of people are probably thinking, okay, why did we give up these amazing careers, amazing funds, to go about our separate ways? What was the rationale there? Feel free to jump into it.
00:04:10.154 - 00:04:14.894, Speaker D: Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. Pharaoh, you go first, because you are the first one left.
00:04:15.614 - 00:05:09.306, Speaker E: Yeah. So I guess this is sort of my fault to an extent. Back in sort of end of 2021, realized that I wanted to do a bit more than just the existing crypto investing in a conventional fund. I think after working in the space for 18 months, I realized that there were a couple of pain points that VC's or crypto VC's didn't necessarily address. And things the largest, like one, was that providing adequate portfolio support to the investments that they've made over the course of their life. And so when we're brainstorming this adjacent, we tried to find a way to structure an investing entity which could really address this point. And so in order to do that, you needed to sacrifice the number of bets you made.
00:05:09.306 - 00:05:24.694, Speaker E: So you had to concentrate basically the portfolio to an extent where you could really sit down with each and every port for the company and really help them through the key problems that they're trying to solve at the early stage of their lifespans.
00:05:27.994 - 00:05:29.294, Speaker A: Maybe on the next.
00:05:32.274 - 00:06:21.180, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I think that was quite different from the reason I loved multicoin. For me, for me, I mean, multiclond was very interesting working there. Everyone was very smart. And then I always constantly, I would say, even up till today, I feel like I can still learn a lot from all my colleagues there. What if the major reason that I left was more because I wanted to work on stepn for multicoin? For those who do not know, we actually are very focused on investing in protocol level stuff. And then we actually did not do much related to, like consumer or like anything that's b, two c. And I personally actually believe the next wave of big explosion would actually happen with regards to anything that's b, two c.
00:06:21.180 - 00:07:08.304, Speaker D: And then I actually think any. This is like a long haul. But I would say a lot of the opportunity would actually happen in Asia. If you look back to, you know, the web two kind of wave, a lot of the new innovation at the beginning always happened from North America, especially us. But then later on, without a lot of the application layer stuff, the asian founders are actually very good, and then they are very good at kind of think about the operational models and whatnot. So, yeah, no, at that time was really just like a very interesting period when I constantly questioned myself, what is the next, or what is the killer app that we've been looking for in our five year or four year career life of crypto. And I never found that.
00:07:08.304 - 00:08:00.718, Speaker D: And I realized that maybe, maybe it's not like something fully crypto native or fully on chain. It doesn't have to be like things that we constantly think consider as Web 2.5 may actually be pretty cool to also, you know, get the actual next 10 million or 20 million users into the crypto space. And then I think, like, step in is perfectly like that. And also, obviously, I started to develop a thesis of a super app back in 2020, but then I was more thinking about like completely all on chain and then like, you know, defi super app, one project, work on everything. But I realized obviously, like, you know, all the composability factor and determine that actually it may not be the case. However, I think the real super app, my thesis now has been modified towards that.
00:08:00.718 - 00:08:38.484, Speaker D: If you have a UI or a front end that can attract a lot of people. Then you can actually aggregate all kinds of other protocols regardless, like who is providing that protocol layer. It could be many different teams working on the backend, the protocol layer, but then the front end could still be the super app. So I thought Stepn was a great opportunity for me to kind of find out whether that thesis works out or not. So, yeah, it was a long answer, but I would say it's really because of the opportunity rather than I don't want to work on the investment stuff. I still were very excited about all the things happening in the space.
00:08:39.544 - 00:09:13.478, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's super interesting, because, mabel, I think you of the three of us have been in this space for the longest. And I think in the past few years, the space has kind of fascinated between Asia is the future of crypto, and then back to the US, and then now the US is banning tornado cash and all that. And then now people are like, go back to Asia. But then you've always been pretty consistent and steadfast about your Asia thesis, and obviously it played out with Stepn as well. So I'm really excited to see that, and we're definitely going to dive into that in a bit. But just to give some context around myself as well, I stepped down from Spartan earlier this year as well. We have a great team.
00:09:13.478 - 00:09:50.738, Speaker A: I have a really great relationship with my other GP, who is Kelvin, who's been on the show as well. He's been a great mentor of mine. I've learned a ton from him, and I think I continue to learn from him. But similar to Daryl, I kind of wanted to work closer with founders, and it was increasingly hard to do at larger funds. This is an issue that any big fund will face, any venture fund would face. And the only way I could really get that intimate relationships with founders and really get in kind of the trenches, as Daryl mentioned, is to be a very concentrated venture portfolio, and it's very hard to structure an institutional fund around that. But we thought, okay, maybe a Dao type of structure makes more sense.
00:09:50.738 - 00:10:35.454, Speaker A: But then Darryl and I are both a little bit bearish on daos, on investment daos. So we decided, hey, why don't we take the best parts of a DAo? So we have the flexibility of including the best people we want without the rigidity of a fund, and then also take the best parts of a fund, which is the rigor of the due diligence, having an actual process, having people at the helm to actually drive things full. So we combined the two, and then the tangent idea was born. So now we have very excited to have eight of us as angel investors investing in companies together. So I guess on that note, with regards to companies we're looking for, what are you guys mostly excited about? Maple, I know you're excited about consumer, but are there kind of specific areas in consumer that you're mostly looking towards besides Stepn?
00:10:36.494 - 00:11:25.914, Speaker D: Yeah, I'll answer this question in a little bit of different angle. I would say the way I pitch to other people today about Stepn is really, it's a consumer social entertainment conglomerate that is partially powered by blockchain. That's really how I kind of pitch other people what we are, because a lot of the things that we are producing are not related to crypto. But I think what very important is that we should leverage blockchain to the extent that it actually provides, like, higher efficiency in a sense that, say, all the account wallet or whatever, and also like things, transactions happening on chain. Right. These are the things that are improving the efficiency, not decreasing, not all the decentralization is providing better efficiency. Right.
00:11:25.914 - 00:12:27.134, Speaker D: So I think, you know, what we have done in the first step of building, step in is really to kind of like provide people a way to learn about how you adopt a non custodial wallet, which in the future I actually prefer not to call a wallet. I would actually prefer call web3, login or account, because like, this is like basically the thing that you would use to navigate around different protocols, layer, or applications in the future. And you can use the same one, whichever one that you're interacting with. So I think from my perspective, Stepn is really just leveraging the best of blockchain, which is the simple, the account system. And also you can send transactions to different people without, there's no kind of gap between Tencent and Alipay. You can actually just navigate through the blockchain ledger. So that's like the absolute very kind of primary reason that a lot of us are attracted by how, quote unquote, efficient blockchain is versus some of the other.
00:12:27.134 - 00:13:27.116, Speaker D: Decentralization may not be serving the best purpose for the mass adoption. So I think that's one. I think the other thing is that I remember yesterday, I saw someone was doing a poll on Twitter and then Jason Cam, Maple Leaf, like he was responding to other people. Like, the guy was basically asking, what is the most thing that you think? What is the one idea that you don't think there's any consensus around but you firmly believe. And then he said he believes that DeFi protocols do not need to be existing standalone. Like, they can basically just getting integrated within like a larger, basically the kind of idea that I just pitched you, like, you can basically produce a conglomerate and then you can serve all the other DeFi. I'm not sure whether that is the right way to explain for all of the, the other app because I still think if you're working on a order book, for example, like you would probably still offer it as an exchange product, standalone.
00:13:27.116 - 00:14:14.600, Speaker D: But let's say you're working on a simple lending or if you're working on a amm maybe. Yes. Like, you know, the one that any company that actually owns a lot of traction might actually just work on it themselves because it's very easy to fork. So I think that's another thing that I was very excited to see whether that plays out, which is someone who owns, who were able to bootstrap the traction and then later on use that traction to kind of offer the kind of DeFi product to people who would actually never have interaction with DeFi, but then offering that service through a very day to day kind of experience, I think move to earn. People are kind of cashing out from the game and then trying to swap it into Solana or Ethereum. That was a perfect example. Otherwise no one's going to use that.
00:14:14.600 - 00:14:22.564, Speaker D: Like, a lot of these users are not going to use the Dex anyway. Right. So I would say that is another kind of direction I was kind of looking at as well.
00:14:23.424 - 00:14:29.384, Speaker A: So you're talking about how step in plucks into, I think, was it orca that.
00:14:29.424 - 00:14:55.226, Speaker D: Yes, it was orca. So now we. Yeah, yeah, so now we, we own our own deck. It's called door d o a r. Yeah, that's the kind of thesis I was betting on. I'm sure there will be more than just ourselves, obviously. Like you can, like, not everyone would buy this thesis because, like people would say you can just integrate someone else and then like, you know, integrate it as decay.
00:14:55.226 - 00:15:28.678, Speaker D: But like, for example, if someone owns attraction, I would say in the early days they might want to build it themselves, but it won't happen continuously because there's liquidity fragmentation as well. Right. You always want to make sure that, you know, you're using a Dex to your, offering a Dex to your users, where the Dex has very deep liquidity. So I think maybe the first one or two or three kind of super app, they would work on their own Dex. But I don't think it's going to happen again and again because, yeah, I.
00:15:28.686 - 00:16:26.824, Speaker E: Think you're beginning to see examples of this, I think, in a slight variation in terms of app chains, basically, right, with that chains that are coming on board. I think that is the idea that some of them are trying to pitch, but maybe not so forthcoming with saying, okay, if I'm a Dex, I'm going to introduce a lending protocol, I'm going to introduce derivative trading, for example. But I think that's the direction that most of these larger apps are beginning to take. If you notice, I think for myself, instead of asking, like, instead of answering what I'm bullish on, I think I'll try and reframe it and say what I think needs to happen in order for crypto adoption to appear. And recently, in the last three months, with Luna's implosion, I think now more than ever, we need the importance of a decentralized alternative. Money is extremely important. A decentralized stablecoin, I think, is very, very important.
00:16:26.824 - 00:17:51.212, Speaker E: If you were to imagine a world where crypto adoption has ten or 100 x and you have a billion users using web3, will you still be comfortable with two or three large centralized providers owning the majority of stable coins in circulation in the market? I think that's absolutely crazy. USCC and USDT are great sort of bootstrap mechanisms, in my opinion, of pushing out stable coins and encouraging adoption of stablecoins as a method of payment. But I think if we don't have a decentralized alternative, there will always be a single attack vector that could end up in catastrophic consequences if any of them were to ever go down. And we've seen all the fight before, but I think it's quite relevant. For example, can you imagine USCC holding a trillion dollars of market supply? I think, what kind of centralized risk does that pose to our very industry? I think that's absolutely not. So I do think that we need something like that to happen, and I think the market is sort of ready for it. With Luna's downfall, there is a pretty big gap in the market there, and we have some alternatives right now.
00:17:51.212 - 00:19:01.824, Speaker E: We have dime, we have fracs, but I want to see a stable coin that really has a valid use case that really makes people want to use it. And I would say so far, we haven't really seen that happen yet. So I think that's one thing that I think we definitely need as an industry in order to accelerate adoption. And the second one that really drew me into crypto was the concept of decentralized ownership of assets. So I think this really comes into play, and got me really excited in the form of play to earn and gamefi, where you could basically decentralize, you could create virtual economies and then begin to distribute virtual assets which previously were just, you know, pretty much useless. But now with the concept of like, allowing trading, allowing play to earn, I think, you know, productive virtual assets are very, very interesting to me. And I would like to see this vertical build be built out, you know, in a way that can rival the physical, real counterparts.
00:19:04.404 - 00:19:40.058, Speaker A: I think the stablecoin part is really interesting, right? Because on one hand you could argue that Terra imploded because there was no regulation, there was no one monitoring the risks and making sure that this model works. And then with USDC, it's technically regulated. But I also understand the other side of the argument, which is if USDC penetrates the entire crypto market and it's trillion dollar market cap and regulations suddenly come down and say, hey, we're going to ban this region, then we basically cripple an entire sector of DeFi in one go. So we need some sort of anti fragile decentralized stablecoin, which I absolutely agree with. Maybe you want to say something.
00:19:40.146 - 00:20:36.404, Speaker D: I might have a very different view on this because, you know, tether has a lot of holders in Asia, particularly in China. So we all know there's a lot of intransparency around tether. But then it's still, I think, before this cycle, like, it was actually the most widely used among all the stable coins. But none of us know what is actually behind and actually no one cares what is really supporting it was the social consensus. I would say first USDC, at some point when it gets adopted by a lot of people, the reason that is supporting its existence is not because the reserve back or whatever it is part of it, sure. But I think it's also because everyone recognize it as a quote unquote stablecoin. I think the same kind of rationale behind how I thought tether was going to last for longer and then there's a lending effect.
00:20:36.404 - 00:20:58.094, Speaker D: Well, I mean, obviously tether has something behind it. You can't have nothing behind it, but as long as you have something, and then people are using it, all the DeFi protocols are having the USDC integrated input, whatever. That actually adds to its robustness. So I actually have a little bit different view on, on this one.
00:21:00.514 - 00:21:03.650, Speaker A: We should bring Sam from Fracs on for future episodes.
00:21:03.762 - 00:21:06.134, Speaker D: I was going to say that. Yeah, yeah.
00:21:06.754 - 00:22:11.176, Speaker A: So for the listeners, Sam is the founder of Frax, is a billion dollar algorithmic stablecoin, and he's one of the mentors at Tangent, and he's one of the first people to really talk about this idea of partial collateralization. And I think they have a really genius model for the algo stablecoin, which we can save for another episode. But before I kind of go into what I'm interested in, I want to go back to your point as well, Mabel, about the aggregator thesis, because I remember I thought the same as well back in Defi summer, and then I saw a project starting to verticalize and every project was starting to build out their own Dex arm, a lending arm, even one inch as the aggregator. They built up their own amm Mooney swap, but no one really used it. And I haven't really seen a successful example of vertical integration yet. And to me it kind of contradicts the thesis that composability is one of the best things about crypto. Right? You can just plug into other apps, but it seems like the incentive for founder is to verticalize and build out their own applications layers of the stack, instead of leaking value to someone else.
00:22:11.176 - 00:22:25.294, Speaker A: So I'm curious how you reconcile those. Do you think this is how things are going to go? Are all founders just going to building their own neo banks and you know, just siloed from each other, basically like almost recreating web two? Is that like a concern that you have?
00:22:25.714 - 00:23:12.936, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I think that's exactly what I was saying. Like early on I thought DeFi super app means one team building out everything. But I said I don't think it's the case. I think here for stepn, the way, or like the way I think it would work is that we identify a need where user actually used to, sorry, needs to use the DeFi for the AMM case for the orca case was that they actually need to use orca to cash out GST or maybe like, you know, buy some other things like there to kind of, in order to play. Right. So that's really, it starts from the demand. So at some point if people are saying like, I'm having too many souls in this wallet and I don't want to transfer it out, maybe it's also okay to integrate Soland first and we don't have to build everything ourselves.
00:23:12.936 - 00:23:45.574, Speaker D: I'm just saying that whoever owns the traction could leverage the traction to do a lot of things, including providing these protocols themselves. But I don't think it works the other way around, which is like you kind of start a defi app and then you try to build out everything because maybe you're not really serving the actual need. But then if you're seeing your users from our case, because you're seeing the users have certain needs to kind of use that, and then you build it, I think that's a different kind of logic, if that makes sense.
00:23:47.474 - 00:24:19.054, Speaker A: Yeah. And I don't know if you guys agree with that, but that's kind of the thesis that we had when I was still back at Spartan. We invested in consensus because I thought that metamask is probably the most valuable product in all of crypto today. Because every single person except Solana who uses crypto, uses metamask. So they can literally build out their own lending, they have built out their own swaps, and I think it's pretty profitable as well. So that was like one of the only growth stage deals we've ever done at Spartan. And because we think metamask is just insanely valuable because of that.
00:24:19.054 - 00:24:22.974, Speaker A: And I guess that kind of. Yeah, go ahead.
00:24:24.514 - 00:25:05.212, Speaker D: I was going to say I agree with you, but then also, like, I want to get back to the kind of web3 login and account point a little bit more because I realized I didn't really expand on that. So I think, first of all, people kind of already start to forget about smart contract wallets. But I actually think this is actually extremely important for mass adoption. It has been always failing among a lot of people who tried it before because the gas during DeFi summer is crazy. No one's going to use that. But actually, if you want to help user in a non custodial way to access blockchain wallet in a very simple way, the smart contract wallets almost like the. The only option.
00:25:05.212 - 00:25:45.932, Speaker D: And then now we have all these availability of all the l two s and whatnot. So I thought maybe the next cycle smart contract wallet would be a really interesting kind of play. I don't know who's actually going to play out even just things like, you know, taurus, I mean, sorry, web3 auth, like this, the private key management solution, all of these, I think these are going to play out for sure. Like this is one thing that really kind of related to web3 login. I think the other thing about the account system, like the identity is on chain credential. I think we talked about this many times before, you and I. We both kind of invested in Galaxy at some point.
00:25:45.932 - 00:26:08.764, Speaker D: And then I think not just project Galaxy, but there were a lot of other kind of players were trying to work on something around that. But I do think if you want the user to be able to navigate around the whole ecosystem with some sort of badges, either on chain and off chain. I do think having those infrastructure build out will also be very important. I just want to add these two points.
00:26:15.144 - 00:26:16.672, Speaker A: Hey guys, I'm really excited to tell.
00:26:16.688 - 00:26:27.416, Speaker B: You more about one of my favorite products in crypto right now, DyDx. This is a team I've known since 2018 and they've built one of the best exchange venues out there that also happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly.
00:26:27.520 - 00:26:28.936, Speaker A: Now listen until the end because there's.
00:26:28.960 - 00:27:08.900, Speaker B: An opportunity for savvy traders out there as well. And here are just a few reasons why I like DyDx over other exchanges. First, it's very liquid, it processes two to $3 billion every day in volume and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording. Which means you can trade things like Ethereum, bitcoin, doge Solana and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today. Second, its also extremely cheap and if youre down bad from the bear market you dont have to worry about gas fees at all because there is no gas fee on starkware L2 where DyDx is built on. Now that brings me to my next point as well. Its incredibly fast, unlike other L2 and high speed dexs, you dont actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore.
00:27:08.900 - 00:27:58.180, Speaker B: And as an additional point, by using Starkware, DYDx also provides users with increased security and privacy. And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so many different sub accounts. And their iOS mobile app is also live right now and it's amazing because it's compatible with Metamask, Coinbase wallet, Coin 98, Huawei wallet, and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there. And it's available for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today. And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions, the most recent tier in the $10,000 equity tier, have won over $95,000 in rewards. And you can get started with as low as $500 in equity to compete for prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it.
00:27:58.180 - 00:28:06.184, Speaker B: So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DYDX exchange to learn more. And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:28:09.704 - 00:28:57.424, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And Daryl, I don't know if you remember but we actually looked at quite a few wallets like a few months ago, and I think one of them was pitching this quite interesting thesis that users only care about convenience, so decentralization doesn't matter. So they were actually creating a custodial wallet for games. So I expect to see more interesting wallets with vastly different trade offs come to market. I'm also curious, like why we haven't seen more adoption of smart contract wallets. I don't know if you guys use Argent before, but I thought it was an amazing mobile app and you can access defi applications within the app itself and there's a guardian system as well, so if I lose my seed I can actually recover it. So I thought it was a great product, but I just don't know why people haven't started using smart contract wallets more.
00:28:57.724 - 00:29:00.824, Speaker D: I thought about that. Go ahead, you go first.
00:29:02.264 - 00:30:02.424, Speaker E: Yeah, no, I was just saying I think it's because user behavior for web3 related activities is still very heavily focused on the desktop as opposed to on the phone. Like, I don't know anybody who uses those things on chain by the phone just because you don't have a cold wallet to back things up. But perhaps the circle I work with is the more crypto native sort of guys. But at the moment I think you need to crack getting users onto mobile in a safe and secure way before we really see more of that happening. But I would like to say as well, I think with the amount of new protocols that are starting out, they're focusing on security, focusing onboarding web two participants to web3. I think in the next cycle we will really see a number of solutions that will really help take off, increase adoption.
00:30:02.964 - 00:30:06.384, Speaker A: Yeah. Solana phone baby. We're all going to order one.
00:30:08.204 - 00:30:39.844, Speaker D: I was going to say in this cycle we just didn't have enough number of the mixed web 2.5 app for a lot of those. You would actually need the smart contract wallet to onboard people because like that's the easiest way for. For them to interact with the application. Right. Like even for us, like, because the performance for blockchain is really hard. So you have to have both this, the non custodial side as well as the custodial side, which is the spending account where people just perform things in a centralized way.
00:30:39.844 - 00:30:47.744, Speaker D: And I see there are going to be more and more applications like what will be operating in this mixed kind of manner.
00:30:49.364 - 00:30:57.344, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really good point because I almost forgot, Stepn is completely mobile and I think it's the most used mobile app in crypto. Right.
00:30:58.804 - 00:31:07.260, Speaker D: I don't. I'm not sure. I don't like. You know, it's really tricky for me to answer this because I don't know other people, but it is quite widely used.
00:31:07.372 - 00:31:18.904, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess like besides exchange apps, right? Like not counting like binance app or FTX apps. It's got to be up there. It's got to be like top five for people who want to know more.
00:31:22.804 - 00:31:23.324, Speaker D: Go ahead.
00:31:23.364 - 00:31:44.564, Speaker A: Yes, sorry. Go ahead. I just want to say we were like a memo about Stepn and how it works. So in case you guys are wondering what Mabel meant by the spending account and all that, we did explain it in that memo. So I'll link it in the show notes below. But yeah, it's a great point about kind of mobile, mobile use case as well. And I want to make sure that I'm not copping out of my answer as well.
00:31:44.564 - 00:32:25.984, Speaker A: So in terms of what I'm bullish on, I think a lot of what I'm interested in is I think I share a lot of the commonalities with you guys. I'm looking for identity solutions. I'm looking for interesting games that could bring on board a lot more users than just crypto natives. But I think one thing we didn't touch on so far was NFT finance. So far we actually see quite promising metrics on things like NFT Fi, which is a lending protocol. They recently had the record month in the bear market. And then Darrow and I are both big fans of the guys at Sudo, which is this AmM build specifically for nfTs, which we think is a superior design compared to existing ones like NFTX.
00:32:25.984 - 00:33:10.454, Speaker A: Then there's some interesting stuff happening, I think one called putty finance, which allows you to buy, put options on your NFT basically as an insurance for nfts. And then we talk to so many teams that are building like neo banks for nfts, right? So basically you earn yield through your nfts. And as tangent, we actually, in our previous batch we invested in this dao called Goblin Sachs, which experiments a lot with like NFT finance ideas. So the first product is basically writing loans and underwriting loans on NFT fi. And they're earning a ton of interest just from doing that. And then they're expanding to other verticals. It's still extremely early, but it just combines my interest in defi with my curiosity around nfts.
00:33:10.454 - 00:33:18.334, Speaker A: So we're actively looking at stuff in that vertical. And every other week I think we get a pitch in that vertical yeah.
00:33:18.634 - 00:33:20.634, Speaker E: But that vertical is pretty hot right now.
00:33:20.754 - 00:33:36.844, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. And I think we should jump into kind of talking a little bit about tangent as well. So I think that you're probably the best person to answer this, but why did you start tangent in the first place? Like, what made you come up with the idea?
00:33:37.464 - 00:35:22.604, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think it came up because I felt that right at the moment, despite all the innovation happening on the Defi front of the game 500 and crypto, on the investing front, the process and structure was still quite archaic. A lot of conventional, all the structures basically in web3 investing, which is basically borrowed and copy and pasted from traditional finance, you had conventional vc investing with 220 structures hedge funds. I think the biggest variation we got was open ended hedge funds that had the ability to double dip in the primary market as well as the secondary market. I think that was the biggest difference versus conventional traditional finance firms. But I realized that with crypto, and the most important distinction here with tokens is the time to liquidity, which I think drastically changed the bursary war metrics for primary market investors. And that was, I think people caught on to that in 2021, where a maraud of different crypto seed funds started launching because everybody wanted in on the very lucrative seed, crypto seed deals. But you know what? It, with this in mind, I thought instead of just trying to be extremely pvp and extremely exploitative about it, we could use this and sacrifice to trade off other concepts or other elements in investing to provide the best value proposition for our counterparties.
00:35:22.604 - 00:36:57.674, Speaker E: So I think in terms of thinking about tangent, I wanted to think of it as a service or a product as opposed to. As a fund. Right. So to me, I am a, I was having the philosophy of being an entrepreneur, selling my service to founders and seeing whether they were interested in what I was offering as opposed to saying, I'm a fund, here's my money, do you want it or not? So I think that was the main distinction when I was trying to conceptualize tangent right now, in using the trade off of earlier time to liquidity, what we could do is we could scale down the number of bets that we had to make, make, because in a conventional web two fund, for example, as a seed fund, you wouldn't be able to write, you know, ten to 20 checks as a fund and expect to survive. I think diversification, you know, the law of large numbers just basically indicates that you will need to have, you know, 50 to 100 bets in order to be able to hit, you know, one or two of those home runs because the 90 90% of your bets are just simply going to fail and you're just not going to see any RoI on it. But for tangent, because of the earlier time to liquidity, we could afford to scale down that number, which is why eventually the number we came up with was 15 to 20 bets every year. That's what it works out to, which is 80% to 90% smaller than what your conventional funds are doing.
00:36:57.674 - 00:37:42.664, Speaker E: So the trade off there. So we're using the earlier time to liquidity and what we're giving back to the founders is basically a superior portfolio support level or service level. So that is the service that we're offering. Because now with smaller number of portfolio companies, we can really sit down with each and every one of them, create a bespoke structure to advise them on what they really need help with. And with every protocol, it's different, but we have the time, we have the resources to do so. So I think that was really what I felt most strongly about when starting tension and curious to see whether that was sort of the philosophy for you as well, Jason.
00:37:43.284 - 00:38:21.266, Speaker A: Yeah, I think very similar philosophies. I think just to clarify as well, I think with the earlier time to liquidity, we are also, we kind of brand ourselves a permanent capital because we don't actually have to sell, but it's just the fact that there is liquidity and we are able to at least see some on paper returns on our fund to know that where we stand as a fund, that makes it easier for us to make this kind of concentrated model. And I think that the good thing as well is because we don't have a fun life. We're not forced to sell in five years. When the fund ends, we can hold onto it forever. We want to. I really like the flexibility, but the most important part for me is finding a tribe.
00:38:21.266 - 00:38:57.504, Speaker A: I always noticed that a lot of friends in crypto tend to just congregate in tribes. Like, there's a bunch of people from Singapore very close to each other. There are a bunch of people in Silicon Valley very close to each other. And as someone based in Hong Kong, a lot of people were leaving the Hong Kong ecosystem. So I actually really wanted my own tribe and I didn't want to do a Dao thing because as I mentioned, we're pretty not too confident on daos executing, especially at least in an investment context. So we basically created this group of people who are friends or people we've worked with, or people we trust and respect a lot, and we invest together. That was a simple idea.
00:38:57.504 - 00:39:24.940, Speaker A: And I'm really curious which part of that resonated with you, Mabel, when you decided to join a board? Because multicoin, I think, is known as one of the investors who's truly hands on. Especially, I think Spartan and Solana had a lot of dealings before. And from those dealings, we got, I guess, pretty familiar with how Kyle worked at Multicoin. And we know that you guys were extremely hands on. It seems like that's something that's really important to you, to Mabel, for sure.
00:39:25.132 - 00:40:12.382, Speaker D: I think people in multicoin, I think we. Obviously, it's not like what Dara was mentioning, just giving out checks and then leave it there, because we are not a beta focused fund. By beta focused fund, I meant you just raise a very large aum, and then you kind of expect that whatever thing that you invested average just get three to five or maybe smaller, like two to four kind of times of return, and then you'll be fine, because you have a very large aum that then you can afford to just have a very low, like, not, sorry, not very low. A relatively lower kind of return compared to some of the other smaller venture fund. For us, I think we want to work on. We're very clear. We only want to work on things that we care about.
00:40:12.382 - 00:41:18.236, Speaker D: Like, I think one of the key thing we ask in IC during, like, those period when I still participate in the multicore and IC was that, are you truly excited to work with these people? That was a big factor within all the investment. I think that matters a lot, because if you're not excited to work with these people, and then you then, like, you probably shouldn't, should not be leading, and then later on, even if we were at, you know, just 100 million size, where everyone else was actually 200 or whatever, like, the venture fund two was 100, and then the venture fund three was 430. I think both are not very large compared to our peers at the same aum. But we intentionally chose that because we wanted to make sure that we can lead every single deal most. Most of the deal that we like, and then try to be sure that we are very hands on, and then we are very concentrated with whatever time that we are spending with each of the portfolio. But I think, to answer your question about why am I interested in tangent, I think there's a few other observations also, I think, come into my mind. One thing is that I would say not just paradigm or multicolin.
00:41:18.236 - 00:41:59.224, Speaker D: I think there's a trend. Basically, all these funds in this space have to strive for deals. The age of you just sit there and then give out checks has already passed. It's very hard to do that anymore, even if after interest rate has hiked and then there's not as much liquidity today. But still, you'll have to kind of prove to the founder, especially to the good founders, that you are worthwhile for the allocation. So I think this just like becoming more of a trend and then, so like, everyone are almost like forced to really pick their rabbit hole and then be very good at certain things. For example, multiclomb is known fairly good at investing in protocol level stuff, infrastructure level stuff.
00:41:59.224 - 00:42:52.104, Speaker D: And we can tell people that, oh, we have this other portfolio that can also have like huge synergy with you. So then that's like the rabbit hole that, you know, bolting was really good at, right? Versus maybe some other investor like Jason Cam, like he's very good at application layer stuff and then he has a lot of insight from his past investment experience as well. So like, those are also like the specialty, but you'll, everyone will have to find some of their own rabbit hole or like the kind of the quote unquote brand name so that they can get, you know, a lot of other good exposure. Like, it's really, really hard to become a very, very generalized fund these days. That's one kind of observation. The other thing is that I realized over the past 24 months or so, a lot of the deals are basically done in a way that one of the mega fund lead or one of the large whale lead, and then the rest of it is just angels. And then most of the angels are all founders.
00:42:52.104 - 00:43:30.792, Speaker D: The reason that these deals were raising from the founders is because these founders can actually provide some sort of synergy to their own startup versus like, maybe giving the allocations to a smaller fund may not even get a beta case. So I feel like that's another kind of observation that I've seen and I think tangent exactly, kind of shows this, which is like, you know, all of us have different sort of expertise or resources. All of ours are actually founders, right. Like, you know, Sue Mackey or the guy state. Right. And then also like Sam and also myself as well as Natasha. Exactly.
00:43:30.792 - 00:43:57.314, Speaker D: So all of us worked on different projects that have different experiences and resources, can bring different kind of skill sets to the table. And I think that's really the kind of way you can help, really help out the project to grow. So I thought it was a very interesting model for everyone because it's not forced that you have to participate in a certain thing. You only invest when you feel like you can truly help. So I really like the model.
00:43:58.654 - 00:44:10.394, Speaker A: Yeah. And we really kind of thought about this from the ground up, and I think I forgot who said this, but someone was joking to me that this is, like, the Avengers model, where we find, like, the best superhero from, like, the respective franchises.
00:44:12.174 - 00:44:15.686, Speaker E: I've never heard that. That's good. That's a good one.
00:44:15.790 - 00:44:36.360, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think it's. Yeah. I'm really excited about the model, and it's interesting to hear you talk about the investment process in multicoin as well, because I don't know if you noticed, but we actually borrowed some lessons from how you guys do it. I really like the fact that I think you mentioned before that you guys are very writing driven. So someone writes out the memo, and then everyone comments in. So that's kind of what we carried over to Tangent.
00:44:36.360 - 00:45:00.234, Speaker A: We basically just share a memo after Darrow and I have done the work, the DD, the reference check, and all that, and then we write the memo and share it with all the mentors, and then everyone chimes in with their questions and try to poke holes. And that's something that I really like, and I'm really interested in. Darryl, when you were at Defiance as well, what was the investment process like? And were there elements that you brought over when we were looking at, like, the 300 or so deals that we've looked at so far?
00:45:01.294 - 00:45:47.308, Speaker E: Yeah, no, I think. I think I really got my trial by fire at Defiance, because prior to defiance, I had almost no vc investing experience. And one of the very good things about my previous boss, Arthur, was that he was. He really let us take the reins when we were there, so that we had the highest opportunity, the most opportunity to learn as fast as possible. And so over basically there. I think, one, I think Arthur was very good at identifying certain narratives and being disciplined about allocating capital. So I think even, you know, as.
00:45:47.308 - 00:46:51.424, Speaker E: Even as the portfolio expanded in defiance, Arthur was always very conscious of not spraying and praying. And I think valuation was one thing that he always was very hesitant to sacrifice. So we would always be looking at valuation as providing that reasonable margin of safety for the deals that we did, which is why I think tonight, I still respect and really admire him as an investor. So I think that was the biggest takeaway for me in terms of process. I learned to develop a lot of things on my own, actually, outside of defiance, previously when I was working for a university fund, back when I was still studying. But I think I learned a lot, actually, from you, Jason, from the way that you operated, given that you learned, you were in the space a lot earlier than me, and you had a lot more deeper vc experience. So up to today, I'm still learning.
00:46:51.424 - 00:46:55.224, Speaker E: So it's a pretty unique experience, I feel.
00:46:56.004 - 00:46:59.104, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think it's. Yeah.
00:46:59.604 - 00:47:27.174, Speaker D: I was gonna just ask you guys, other than the writing process, was there, like, you told me that you have, what, 300 in total for the applicant. Right. So then where there's something, I'm sure, like, you're just creating them in a relatively fast manner, but at the same time, maybe be looking out for some important stuff out of a team, what would be some of the things that you look out for? I was just curious about that in the screening process.
00:47:29.094 - 00:48:00.132, Speaker A: Yeah, I can take a step first. So just go to the very beginning of the process in terms of filtering. So we do have a cold application form that people refer to us, that people use to apply, but we strongly prefer people who come with referrals. So I think between Dara and myself, we probably have connections with, like, hundreds of founders. And if you add Mabel as well, we have hundreds and hundreds of connections in this space. So whenever someone we know or we've worked with or respect or investors that we co invested with refer a deal to us, that's usually a very, very high signal. So we put it to the top of the list.
00:48:00.132 - 00:48:35.362, Speaker A: So that's how we kind of filter out the best kind of companies first and then the second. So Darren and I came up with this way to codify our heuristics. So I realize it's very, very easy to fall to biases when we invest. So when we look at founders, if it's someone that's young and talks fast, usually from the west coast, we're like, okay, this guy knows what he's doing. And then we realize, okay, they have no clue what they're doing. So in order to remove that kind of subjectivity, we actually have a scoring system with different weights that we've back tested with a lot of the deals that we've done at both Defiance and Spartan. So across two portfolios, and we weight founders across several metrics.
00:48:35.362 - 00:49:00.656, Speaker A: So, like, founder, market fit, whether this founder is actually, you know, fit for this market, the size of the market. So the tam, the serviceable market today. So, for instance, just because Defi's total addressable market is finance is massive, doesn't mean the defi market is massive. So we take that into consideration as well. Obviously, valuation vesting. So we rate all of those projects on the same metrics. And I think we've done probably like 100 now just to back test it.
00:49:00.656 - 00:49:33.542, Speaker A: So that's our sanity check to make sure we don't succumb to subjectivity. And then finally, we're really looking for founders that we can work with. So a lot of the founders that we talk to, we even met up in person over several meetings. And sometimes they don't work out right. Sometimes they don't lead to deals. But we really prefer to get to know the founders before we pull the trigger. And I think the good thing we've learned from our first deal for batch one, which announced soon, is that because founders understand our value add, we are able to come in very late in the process and actually have all the other funds committed already.
00:49:33.542 - 00:49:54.764, Speaker A: And the founders are still willing to fit us into the round because they understand, wow. Every dollar we take from tangent is much more impactful on a per dollar basis than a really large fund. So that has been an advantage. We are able to have a pretty drawn out DD process if we want to, but typically, because we're so small, we also move pretty fast. But, yeah. Curious if you have anything to add there, Daryl?
00:49:55.384 - 00:51:02.764, Speaker E: Yeah, I would say that I'm pretty satisfied with our due diligence process at the moment. I think it is quite a bit, I would guess that it's quite a bit better than majority of funds out there at the moment in terms of foreigners. And also, to answer your question, Mabel, about what we, what I want to see in founders, I think I, I really like it when we can identify founders that are uniquely positioned to solve a particular problem. Like what? When we look at founders, we talk to them, we see their experience and their background. We see their motivation. So if everything comes down to, everything comes down to answering the question, are you, like, really perfectly suited to solve this particular problem? Like, why you, why this problem? And, you know, do you have the energy and that motivation that we don't really see anywhere else? And it's very rare to actually get a yes on that. So I, which is sort of why the, you know, of the 3400 different applications, we're only really cutting it down to three or five different bets.
00:51:02.764 - 00:51:52.954, Speaker E: But I think if we can get consensus behind a yes on that question, most of the time it's pretty smooth sailing because I think that is the most important thing. But I also like the caveat that I think in terms of our investing process, the thing that we look at the two concepts that we look at the most, and we have the highest weighting on our scoring metric is really the team alluded at the first question. Are you uniquely positioned to solve this problem? So if that's a yes, that ticks one box, then the second box is actually valuation investing. Because for us, as a fund with the concentrated model that we have, we cannot afford to get too many things wrong. We need that margin of safety, and that really is priority to us.
00:51:53.814 - 00:52:14.006, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I think all of us care about the valuation very much. I'm. I'm extremely strict about valuation. I even have noticed I have a. I have a playbook in my mind. I think you're not. I think I know which one you're referring to, but I do have a number range in my mind.
00:52:14.006 - 00:53:10.114, Speaker D: Like what? Like, say, pre traction should be whatever, and then maybe if it's an extremely good founder, I can add maybe five y'all into that. Something like that. I know it's, it's not supposed to work like that, but I always use it as a reference check and I think it's good. I would actually, for this question I asked, I think I only have one thing to ask from my own perspective, which is, I like to back, back to founders who are able to grind, but also know how to talk about a grind. Because I realized that in crypto, I think I mentioned this in many places, but attention is the only scarce commodity, so that if someone is willing to keep grinding, it's a very big factor in the success. But that's not enough, in my opinion. You also have to let other people know that you're also grinding, otherwise it would be very hard.
00:53:10.114 - 00:53:34.974, Speaker D: I think Solana was a great example back in the days. They've been trying to do a lot of other things, a lot of, you know, the hard work in the early stage, but I think only after they started to know how to talk, like, due to marketing and stuff, they really started to take off. So, I mean, there are a lot of other kind of cases for this I don't have to mention. But I think that's really, like, one rule of thumb that I been summarized.
00:53:35.014 - 00:54:05.436, Speaker A: Over the years that's really interesting, because I don't think I've heard anyone bring that out yet, kind of talking about the grind. And I think it makes sense, right. Because especially for you, focusing a lot of consumer products. Consumers want to know that the products they're using will have new features, that their team is there to answer the questions if they need support. And this reminds me, a lot of SPF in the early days. He's personally answering help requests. You could dm him on Twitter and be like, hey, I can't execute this order in FTX and he will personally resolve it for you.
00:54:05.436 - 00:54:23.394, Speaker A: Obviously now they're much bigger company, they can't do that. But I think founders that do that in the early days versus founders that are just kind of laid back or maybe founders that are way too product focused, kind of engineers that build up a product and don't want to do any of the bd. I think founders like that tend to have a much higher hit rate. So I absolutely agree with that.
00:54:24.734 - 00:54:36.874, Speaker D: Yeah, for most of the consumer stuff, you have to stay on top of everyone's mind. There's just too many things happening at the same time. You can't afford to lose people's attention.
00:54:38.414 - 00:55:14.854, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely, definitely. And as we're closing out right now, and feel free to jump in with additional questions if you have them as well, Mabel. But I really want to get your respective thoughts on the bear market just because it's been a pretty brutal bear market so far, and it seems like everybody's just watching the macro and trying to see when it turns around. But then with the ETH merge coming up as well, seems like there's some optimism coming back to the space. So it's a very confusing time for investors and for founders who are trying to, you know, plan out their next round of fundraising. So how do you guys think, like the next 1224 months play out? What are some of the major things you're monitoring?
00:55:17.274 - 00:55:18.374, Speaker D: Do you want to go?
00:55:22.674 - 00:56:19.286, Speaker E: I can go first. So, I mean, like, so. So, you know, that's a tangent. Even though we focus, you know, 90% to 95% of our day to day on primary markets, we still are actively looking at the secondary markets as well. And so with that definitely paying attention to broader macro in terms of the next twelve to 24 months, I would say that it's a pretty challenging period where I think what the price action over the last six months has caught almost every institutional fund off guard. And either on the way down or on the way up, I think a lot of funds were caught back holding too many positions as ETH went ready for my four k and crashed all the way to one k. And on the consequent move up as well on this ETH merge narrative, a lot of funds were sidelined just waiting for broader macro fund to subside before putting on positions.
00:56:19.286 - 00:57:01.496, Speaker E: So it's really a challenging time. At the moment, I'm inclined to believe the most important thing to me, I think, is to be data dependent. And right now it's pretty clear from a crypto specific standpoint, mindshare has not returned for the better part of retail, for the better part of the world. So we're still within this microcosm of people who have not left the space. And I, I think you need to look at when that mind share starts returning. So that will drive crypto focus or crypto focused flows from the rest of the world into crypto. Right.
00:57:01.496 - 00:57:45.234, Speaker E: And the second thing is obviously, watching inflation prints, watching GDP prints as well, to see whether the broader world is going into a recession or not or whether we can navigate a soft landing for the Fed. Obviously, I'm not a crypto. I'm not a macro expert. So the views that I have there will not really be relevant to the viewers probably. But I think right now, if you're looking to say if, the question is when is the next bull market going to begin, it will be an amalgamation of both these two factors. When is mind share returning and how do we sort of play out in terms of macro in the next 24 months?
00:57:46.454 - 00:58:42.904, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I haven't really been spending a lot of time on investing, but here's a few, I guess here's some two sons of mine. First of all, I think ETH merge, right? Everyone was focusing on this right now because I feel like this is probably the only kind of very hot topic these days. And people don't, who've been like chasing the ETH growth probably haven't noticed that all of these NFT, like small NFT project, we call it JPEG or whatever, and some of the other ones that only launched for not a long time, but then has been on the secondary market. All of those has been very brutal, at least, I don't know, 60, 70% down. That's for the best. I think GMT was a good example like that. It actually didn't go down that much, but still was already like 70% or whatever, like down from the top.
00:58:42.904 - 00:59:21.236, Speaker D: So what does that mean? It means, like, there were a lot of capital. So, sorry, let me, let me rephrase it. It means like whatever capital that was going into the ETH merge was actually just existing capital within the market. There's no new influx of the market. And then if you couple that with all of these, you know, increase the rate hikes and whatever, there's no way that there's new money coming in. So I think surely it looks like it's doing very well, but I think it's just like whatever does exist and it's already like gone quite a bit compared to like the bottom. That's one observation.
00:59:21.236 - 01:00:17.928, Speaker D: The other thing was that I would say a lot of the very large projects, including, I don't want to name them, but you know, like in the past few months there were quite a few announcements saying like, oh it was closed at 2 billion valuation or maybe like 5 billion valuation or whatever. And those are not even mainnet launch and then they are launching their main net soon. At least one or two very smart hatch fund that I was talking very closely. They were actually waiting to buy a lot of those on the liquid market or maybe they just buy it on OTC, right, with a lot of those. And basically that process has not happened yet. Meaning like people who bought, you know, or maybe it started to happen but I don't think it played out completely. So I would say, you know, we might want to watch out and the OTC desk and see like if there's a huge rat that sell off, it's a high valuation vc deal of the saft.
01:00:17.928 - 01:00:55.778, Speaker D: And then if that happened, I think that might be a good consolidation point where we could start to kind of think about the next run again. And then I think the third part of this is just that, you know, think about the valuation. The reason I really care about valuation was because I think it's a very good temperature check and it's usually slower than the secondary market. Like primary market could still, you can still see a lot of the pre traction 30 million deal all the way around. But then like, you know, secondary market isn't the case. But it usually, I would say take at least a few, quite a few months to reflect that. Particularly because in the last cycle a lot of these mega funds, they raised a lot of money.
01:00:55.778 - 01:01:17.344, Speaker D: There's no way that they are running out of money anytime soon. So you probably see a delay of six months or even one year. I would say the real kind of bottom would likely to happen when we are seeing a lot of these deals. The pre traction deal goes back to the level where we were used to. I'm just gonna pause here.
01:01:18.164 - 01:01:41.020, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I absolutely agree with that. You know, that's one of the reasons that, you know, we're very deliberate and slow in deploying as well, right. We don't have to maintain the illusion of being quote unquote an active fund. I actually never understood why that's like a good thing. When people say that, oh, we're the most active investor in crypto, it just means you've sprayed and prayed into the most things. So it doesn't really mean anything. So we're very deliberate.
01:01:41.020 - 01:02:11.654, Speaker A: We look at a lot of stuff. We talked to ton of teams. We invest very slowly because we like to diversify across vintage, right? Because who's to say in 24 months, seed stage valuations are not going to reset to like 1 million FTV. So I'm very careful about that. So I think we share the philosophy there. And I think in terms of the bear market, I agree with everything that you guys said. I think it's going to be a very challenging two years for founders that are trying to raise, especially if you are not coming from an extremely, you know, experienced background, it will be hard to raise.
01:02:11.654 - 01:02:36.774, Speaker A: And for, you know, founders who have already launched a token and the treasury depends on the secondary price of the tokens, maybe try to find ways to extend that Runway. Right. Try to get 24 months Runway. I know some projects that have, you know, gone way overboard to like 70, 80 months Runway. But, you know, who, who's to say that that's not the prudent thing to say, that's a prudent thing to do. So I am personally exercising a lot of caution. I think founders should as well.
01:02:36.774 - 01:02:40.734, Speaker A: But, you know, regardless of what happens, I'm pretty sure we're still going to stick around here.
01:02:42.034 - 01:02:52.334, Speaker D: Yep, I agree. Do you want to maybe just talk about one prediction that you have for the next cycle or maybe just like, you know, the next 24 month?
01:02:53.194 - 01:03:27.694, Speaker A: 24 months is hard, but I will talk about next cycle. So the interesting thing is I did this, I think back in 2019, I was trying to predict DeFi TVL and I think I was like, oh, it's going to get to $1 billion. And then I thought I was being way too exuberant. But then at the top, if you look back at the past few years, I think the top was like 180 billion. So I was way off. So if I have to make another prediction, I'm calling for a trillion dollar in TVL, like within the next five years in all the applications combined. So we'll see how that pans out.
01:03:29.284 - 01:03:35.628, Speaker E: Interesting. I haven't really given many predictions. I don't think they usually, it's just a finger in the air.
01:03:35.796 - 01:03:36.704, Speaker A: They are.
01:03:37.084 - 01:03:48.412, Speaker E: I think for me, if I had one thing, I think the next bull market, we will see a game five related project reach 100 billion in market cap or FDB.
01:03:48.508 - 01:03:49.036, Speaker A: Oh, wow.
01:03:49.100 - 01:04:01.774, Speaker E: I think that is within reason. And I think, I think, I think Axio is really the forerunner for what can be. And you know, obviously this has to be at the height of the bull market, but I think it's possible.
01:04:02.954 - 01:04:54.834, Speaker D: I actually wanted to echo you on that one, but I wouldn't call it Gamefi because, like, these days, people just keep using gamefi social file, everything with a five. So that confuses me. I don't even know what those are, but I would say just the next 50 million users. I was gonna say ten or 20 million, but now I'm gonna exaggerate a little bit. The next 50 million users are probably going to come in with some sort of social entertainment applications, and then they're definitely going to interact with blockchain, with the quote unquote web3 accounts. It's basically going back to my thesis at the beginning I said, and I think I'm very bullish on those. And I would believe that the next wave of entrepreneurs may not be extremely, quote unquote cryptonative or, well, not crypto native is wrong word.
01:04:54.834 - 01:05:15.390, Speaker D: It's probably like people who care a lot about the political correctness, about decentralization or a lot of those ethos, like, we used to care so much because they would actually care more about the UI Ux. And I think that's really where we will get the large amount of users. Cool. I think this is a good one.
01:05:15.422 - 01:05:28.274, Speaker A: Absolutely. Absolutely. And this has been a really fun one. So before we go, let's do some shout outs. I think people should absolutely subscribe to your podcast, Mabel. What are some ways they can follow you or follow your podcast?
