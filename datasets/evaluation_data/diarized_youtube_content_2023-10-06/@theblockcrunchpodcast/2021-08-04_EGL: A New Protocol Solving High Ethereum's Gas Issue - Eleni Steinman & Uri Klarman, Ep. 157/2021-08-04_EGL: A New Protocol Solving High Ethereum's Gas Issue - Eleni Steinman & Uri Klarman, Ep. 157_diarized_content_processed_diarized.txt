00:00:01.280 - 00:00:27.184, Speaker A: Welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the show for crypto natives. Every week we do short but in depth conversations with the most important builders and investors in crypto, so you can filter through what's noise and stay ahead of the markets. I'm your host, Jason Choi. Nothing on this show should be construed as financial advice, and my guests, myself and my employer may hold positions and assets discussed on the show. This episode is also brought to you by Periswap and Solana, two of my favorite projects in crypto. Stick around to learn more.
00:00:27.484 - 00:01:13.354, Speaker B: Now, today we have a very exciting episode, and just to give listeners a little bit of context, recently we've been talking a lot about a project called flashbots. They've been the talk of the town, and they're focused on tackling mev. And what was really interesting to me is that it's not just an application like we usually discuss on the show, but it's a project that tackles protocol level attributes without needing to fork the Ethereum network. Now, recently, there is another project coming around that will be very important to Ethereum that's also aiming to tackling protocol level challenges, and one that is near to dear to many people and stakeholders hearts, which is the issue of gas fees. So, to talk about the Eagle project or EGL Ethereum gas limit, I have my friends Eleni and Uri, the co creators of Eagle, come on the show to chat. So welcome, guys.
00:01:13.854 - 00:01:15.398, Speaker C: Hi. Happy to be here.
00:01:15.526 - 00:01:17.234, Speaker D: Hi. Thank you for having us.
00:01:17.934 - 00:01:35.114, Speaker B: Absolutely. So before we dive into Eagle, I thought that we should level with everybody and make sure that everybody understands the concept of gas limits and all the challenges there. So without going to the logistics of how a gas limit is set today, or even what eagle is for the noobs out there, what is a gas limit?
00:01:35.854 - 00:02:22.270, Speaker D: Okay, so you know how in bitcoin there is something called the block size that everybody had debated strongly about between 2014 and 2017? That's kind of depending on how big blocks are, it means how many transactions can be there. This is like how much usage you can get from the chain. If blocks are bigger, you have more for more transactions, and you could use more of it. In Ethereum, it's very similar, but instead of counting it in bytes, so in bitcoin, it's 1 mb, it's counted in gas. So transactions and all sorts of smart contracts have these operations. They cost gas. And the gas limit really says, like, how many operations or which type of operation can fit within a single block.
00:02:22.270 - 00:02:57.520, Speaker D: So how many simple transactions, or how many simple transactions and very convoluted transactions. So the gas limit is just how big blocks are. But unlike bitcoin, which kind of like has the block size set in protocol, it's 1. That just that. In Ethereum, the gas limit is constantly being adjusted by the miners and the mining pools specifically. So every time a new block is mined, it could be up to 0.1% bigger or 0.1%
00:02:57.520 - 00:03:12.644, Speaker D: smaller than the previous one. So miners have this control over how big blocks are, and the idea is for them to try to decide the best gas limit, which is to the best of ease and the success of the ecosystem.
00:03:14.804 - 00:03:29.184, Speaker B: Got it. And I know that it's usually having gas limits too high. There's certain effects and having it too low, there are other effects as well. So can you guys help us understand, you know, what are the effects if gas limit gets too high and too low? And feel free to either of you, feel free to take it.
00:03:29.644 - 00:04:03.850, Speaker D: So I'll take it. Fun being three people in the conversation. So a lot of people think sometimes, well, the gas limit is super technical, right? It's kind of like, I don't know what it should be. It's actually not that technical. It's almost a question of values. If you put a really high, or if you put high gas limit, then blocks can be bigger and the nodes need to be stronger in order to process it. You'll have larger state, you'll have more storage, you'll have more processing.
00:04:03.850 - 00:04:47.296, Speaker D: So it means that nodes need better hardware in order to run them. So the higher you increase the gas limit, the stronger nodes need to be. And there's an open question, like, do you need to run it? Should you be able to run it on your mobile phone? Probably not. Should you be able to run it on a raspberry PI? Probably not, but some would argue that. So do you need to run it on a dollar, 400 pc or 800? What's reasonable? And so there's a question there, but the higher the gas limit, the costly or the hardware you need in order to run a note at the same time. Hold on. At the same time, if you reduce the gas limit, the lower it is.
00:04:47.296 - 00:05:37.674, Speaker D: That means there is less room for people to participate, right? Smaller blocks mean less transactions there, so people try to outbid one another, and only the highest paying transactions will be mined, the most valuable ones. And that means that you're throwing out users, right? Like if higher gas limit, reduce decentralization of nodes, lower gas limit, reduce decentralization of users, you're throwing the regular users out keeping only those, you know, giant whales who move millions of dollars. Of course, they can pay $100 fees. And so the idea is to balance between the two. And it's. It's not really technical. It's a values question, like, where do we want to be on the spectrum between these two ends? And what's the right place for Ethereum as a community?
00:05:39.054 - 00:06:23.374, Speaker C: And if I could add one more thing to that, from the miners perspective, they also have a trade off they can make in deciding the size of the block, and that is earning more fees from including more transactions and the probability that their block gets uncle, which means it's not the first one to be heard by the rest of the community. And so if miners build larger blocks, that means they have the opportunity to earn more fees from transactions. But that block may increase slightly its chance that it gets uncle. And so again, that's not a technical question. That's a question of economics and trade offs. Do the fees compensate the miner enough to be included in the block, given this additional risk?
00:06:24.274 - 00:06:57.014, Speaker B: That's a really interesting point, because I think a lot of listeners who may be active Defi users, they get this idea that a gas limit is a parameter that you set in your metamask before you send a transaction through. But behind the scenes, it seems like the miners, or rather the mining pool admins, are also involved in setting the gas limit as well. And they actually have been raising it as well. Just so everybody understands. Can you explain what goes into setting the gas limit currently? Who are the stakeholders that actually sets the gas limit today? Is it the users? Is it the miners? Is it mindful edmonds?
00:06:57.354 - 00:07:39.918, Speaker C: So I think before that question, I just want to clarify one point. The term gas limit is actually used for to mean two different things. There's the block gas limit, which is the sum of all of the individual transactions, gas limits. So when you open up your metamask and you're on balancer and you're trying to submit a transaction, you're saying how much gas you're willing to pay for that specific transaction. And then when a miner puts all the transactions together and builds the block, there's the total number, amount of gas that can be included in that block. And honestly, the way that this is set is exactly what Ori said. It can be plus or -0.1%
00:07:39.918 - 00:07:52.128, Speaker C: from the prior block. And it's really set not by miners, but mining pool admins. Most miners mine with a pool. You may have heard of them. Ether mine. F two pool. Spark pool.
00:07:52.128 - 00:08:21.264, Speaker C: Pool. B pool. And they are the ones that actually built the block. And so at the end of the day, it ends up being four mining pools that control, effectively control the gas limit because they control over 60% of the hash power. So if, you know, if you control the 100%, then every single block, you could make 0.1% bigger and bigger and bigger if there are other participants who are pushing it down and up. And that's how you get some volatility in what the gas limit is.
00:08:22.314 - 00:08:34.614, Speaker B: That's really interesting. I didn't realize that there's only four pools that are setting this parameter. And I guess, on that note, what is the pain point in the current way that this gas limit is set? What are some of the things that people have been complaining about?
00:08:35.594 - 00:09:19.676, Speaker D: So let's start by maybe outlining why is it important? Well, okay, so we set the gas, but so what? Why are we even talking about it? Well, turns out that this parameter is super important. Okay. Like, in terms of economic activity, this literally means how much usage goes through Ethereum. Okay. To throw a few numbers out there, Uniswap LP's made in fees like $175 million last year, in 2020, and the average, like, it changed slightly to them. But most of last year, the gas limit was 10 million gas. So block the size of each block was up to 10 million gas.
00:09:19.676 - 00:09:59.094, Speaker D: Nowadays, we're at $15 million gas. So everybody decided it's okay to increase it. So increasing the gas limit from 10 million of last year to 15 million this year means that LP's could make some, like, just uniswap LP's, like, not ignore, not the entire ecosystem, just them could make another, what, somewhere between 50 and $100 million. Just them, arguably, like the traders doing the trade over there, capture something similar. So we're talking $100 to $200 million of revenues just from. Increase in graphic for Uniswap. Now, uniswap is big.
00:09:59.094 - 00:10:31.434, Speaker D: So if that's for Uniswap, all of Defi is probably double that. So anywhere between 200 million and $400 million per year in revenues. Okay, decided by if we're doing 10 million, like last year, or 15 million this year. So adjusting the gas limit has significant, like, like, economic, like, ramifications even. I'm not even talking about the gas. Sorry about the gas fees. Everybody thinks that the gas limit is just about whether fees are high or low and how much it costs them.
00:10:31.434 - 00:11:10.432, Speaker D: And it is, and it's not that important that that's likely. Another few, like 100, $200 million per year that people have to pay that could be saved, but the usability, that's the real thing. So the gas limit is like the single most important parameter in the system, deciding how much throughput, how much usability is coming out. And we're trying to find a level which is maximizing, trying to increase how much value while remaining decentralized. And everybody could run a node. And that's kind of like the thing that we're trying to balance. So this is why it's all we're touching this.
00:11:10.432 - 00:11:31.352, Speaker D: Why is this important? Because this thing is worth hundreds of millions of dollars per year. It's very much worth everybody's time to try and maximize. Not maximize, but to optimize it. Now, going back to your question, I got so excited about it that I lost my train of thought. The original question was, why are people.
00:11:31.408 - 00:11:34.084, Speaker B: Like, what are people complaining about in the current way?
00:11:35.174 - 00:12:22.392, Speaker D: Right? Okay, so, and then we were talking about the percent, what percent of mining pools. Like, that's what. So we have our own background, like as people who work both with users and with mining pools, and kind of at the network layer, which kind of put us at a position to even see that. Turns out that most mining pools don't even participate in setting the gas limit. So mining pools, when they mine a new block, they can either push it upwards or push it downwards to whatever they think is the best number. And the result is that it hover kind of like on what all the mining pools think, but something like 40% of the hash power don't even participate. I like to laugh about it.
00:12:22.392 - 00:13:17.366, Speaker D: It's kind of like the american voter, they're saying, like, well, my vote doesn't really count. Like I'm so small, it doesn't matter what I do, it's going to be set by other people anyway. They just don't play the game. And the result of that is that you have four pools deciding what the gas limit is going to be, and a that's anything but decentralized. Okay, so if we have this essence that it should be decentralized, then this ain't it. But more importantly than that, their incentives are not necessarily aligned to make it whatever is best for the ETH ecosystem. Their incentives are aligned to increase their profits, right? So maybe if there's a lot of congestion and people try to outbid one another, they might ask themselves, should I increase the gas limit right now and make the fees go down? It might be good long term, but in the short term I'll make less money.
00:13:17.366 - 00:13:51.166, Speaker D: So should I. So we have the problem of incentives right there. And so that's kind of like half of the problem, and the other half of the problem is that even, like, most schools are actually good actors, they're trying to do what's good for ETH. They're not incentivized to do it, but they are good actors, but they don't know what the ETH community wants. Like, some core devs want it to be lower. They're like, they're rejecting and opposing any increase to the gas limit. Others are in favor of increasing it, like, we should increase it.
00:13:51.166 - 00:14:13.006, Speaker D: And if you're a mining pool, well, you see these two teams, you have a lot of core devs. You have no idea what you're thinking. And it's just very, very hard to gauge, like, what does the community want? Nobody knows. I've spent, like, a year working on this. I still don't know what most core devs think should be the gas limit. Nobody knows. There is no insight to see how should we set it.
00:14:13.006 - 00:14:19.404, Speaker D: So even with the best intentions, fools have a really hard time setting the gas limit how they think it should be.
00:14:20.264 - 00:14:35.404, Speaker B: That's really interesting. And so, I guess on that note, and I swear we'll talk about eagle very soon, but on that note, what are the people that should be involved in setting the gas limit? Is it the devs, the miners, the users, or the holders? Stakers?
00:14:37.664 - 00:15:41.178, Speaker C: Yeah, I think you named them all. So, the premise of ETH, from a philosophical perspective is it is an open protocol that anyone can join and incentives roll the day. And because this protocol level attribute, this parameter is so important, it really ought to be, anyone should have the opportunity to have a say in it. And it doesn't actually mean your say should be the loudest or that yours should be the only one. And that's why we have this concept of what we call signals. So with Eagle, we are seeding any core dev that wants to participate, with eagles that are locked for a year so they can vote and signal to the community what they think the right answer should be. And my personal opinion is I anticipate large stakeholders in the ethereum ecosystem, like, you know, centralized exchanges, like coinbases of the world coin list, to also stake ETH and signal what they think.
00:15:41.178 - 00:16:14.780, Speaker C: I mean, another great example is venture capitalists. If you are invested in all of these protocols that are built on top of Ethereum, and as Ori explained, the value of this parameter is how they affect all of these daos and dapps, then perhaps you want to do the research and sort of lobby, you know, try to convince the rest of the community why your number is right and, you know, put your money where your mouth is type of thing. Actually stake eagles to have the best outcome for the community. So our answer is everyone, that's really awesome.
00:16:14.812 - 00:16:30.384, Speaker B: And we're going to dive into how it works exactly, because this is where eagle comes in, kind of resolving this signaling issue and resolving this incentive alignment. And I think it's such an interesting project, but for people who haven't come across the project before, what exactly is eagle and how does it work?
00:16:31.224 - 00:17:12.860, Speaker D: So the idea eagle is actually a very simple system. We said, or we looked at the system and we said, listen, nobody knows what the gas image should be, and we need to provide insight and we need to incentivize pools in order to do whatever is good for the good of Eve. And so we created this very simple token that has three components. Eagle standing for ethereum gas limit is a token which anybody during the genocide, you could stake your ETH and get eagles. Okay, so if you have, like, there's no token sale or anything like that. If you have ETH, you can stake it and in return you can claim free eagles. So you get eagles.
00:17:12.860 - 00:17:42.624, Speaker D: Eagles can vote on the desired gas limit. Okay, so every week there is a tally vote. You can vote just once every eight weeks, right? So you don't actually have to be very active. But anybody with eagle can vote and say, I think the desired gas limit should be x. Maybe it's 1 million more than we are today, maybe it's 2 million more, maybe it's 3 million down, I don't know. But anybody can say, this is what I think the gas limit should be. And every week there is a tally vote kind of thing.
00:17:42.624 - 00:18:23.200, Speaker D: And this is kind of like proof of stake style. There is an average weight of all the voters and how much stake they have, and it reaches like a collective decision what the community wants the gas limit to be. So first component, it's kind of, okay, it's a token. People get it and they vote on the gas limit they want. Now, pools don't actually have to follow it. This is like a smart contract, which count votes and say, here's what we want, but it doesn't force anybody to do anything. However, pools can sweep free eagles from the smart contract if they follow the gas limit.
00:18:23.200 - 00:18:59.920, Speaker D: And the more closely they follow the desired gas limit, the desire of the community, the more eagles they can get. So if they're like a million gas off or something, they're nowhere close to what the community wants. They can't get any eagles. If they do exactly what the community wants, they get the whole potential reward. And so this incentivizes pools to follow what the community wants. So that's kind of like, first piece, people stay Keith, get eagles. Second piece, people vote with eagles and kind of, like, reach a desired gas limit.
00:18:59.920 - 00:19:59.518, Speaker D: Third piece, mining pools are incentivized to follow that now or the desire of the community now. The last and maybe most, I don't know if most important, but definitely very interesting piece is that we're awarding eagles free eagles to any interested core dev to provide signal for the community. So core devs might not have the most capital out there, but their stake in Ethereum is, like, unquestionable, right? These people should have a very loud vote, and the idea is that we give them eagles, we lock them for a year. So, like, they can't just immediately sell it or anything, but they have some effect, just like you and me. Anybody with eagle can vote, but we're actually providing insight into what this Courtev think and what that guy thinks. So this allows anybody could go, and you have kind of like a lead board or a dashboard, and you can say, well, these guys think it should be lower. These guys think it should be higher.
00:19:59.518 - 00:20:18.138, Speaker D: Maybe everybody think it should be as it is right now. All of a sudden they say, well, you know, we think we should increase it. So this provides insight and guidance to the community. It's not the core devs who decide, but they provide the needed guidance for the community to decide. And that's kind of like how ego works.
00:20:18.266 - 00:21:04.372, Speaker A: Now, before I continue, I'd love to share one of my favorite products in crypto with you. Now, whenever I want to trade a token, instead of going to uniswap sushiswap Bancor one by one to see where I can find the best quote, I just go to Paraswap to scan for the best price anywhere because per swap aggregates all the popular Ethereum dexs and saves me a ton of time and headache in finding where I can trade something for the best price and lets me trade in one place. Now, the cool thing is theyve also integrated with Ledger live as well, meaning I can now swap at the best prices directly from my ledger wallet. So, seriously, if youre a Defi trader and youre worried about the security risks of centralized exchanges, but you also dont want to scour dozens of dexs just to find the best price, you have to check out Periswap. So head on over to Paraswap IO blockcrunch.
00:21:04.508 - 00:21:48.202, Speaker E: I'd love to also talk about our sponsor, Solana, a high throughput layer one blockchain. Now, in the past few months, I've probably talked to two dozen teams building exciting new projects on Solana, and this is probably why. First, it's incredibly fast with 50,000 transactions per second. 2nd, it's cheap with average fees less than a cent per transaction. That means developers can deploy contracts cheaply and also not have to worry about their apps to not being composable with others, as Solana does not use any type of sharding or fragmented L2 systems. Most importantly, Solana is censorship resistant with over 950 validators today. So if you're interested in building fast, scalable blockchain applications, or want to test out the existing ecosystem of defi applications and more, go to solana.com
00:21:48.202 - 00:21:49.266, Speaker E: blockcrunch.
00:21:49.370 - 00:22:14.104, Speaker B: It's very clear to me what the incentive for mining pools is, because if they follow the gas limit that's signaled by the community, they get the token rewards. But what is the incentive for the people who are signaling? Right, is there an issue of a tragedy of commons here? Because I think, Eleni, you mentioned that a lot of the stakeholders currently, they don't really engage in the discussion about gas limit at all. So what is the incentive for them to change that behavior?
00:22:14.644 - 00:22:58.118, Speaker C: Yeah, so a few things. First, obviously, once we can talk about how we're launching Genesis, which I think is sort of unique, and how eagle starts with value to begin with. So part of your incentive, honestly, if you're an eagle holder, which is the only way that you can vote, you should want a functioning system, right? You don't want to vote for something that's going to break the system because now the thing that you own could become worthless. So that's 1st. 2nd, you know, Ori was sparing you some details about how the vote works, which is you can't actually just vote on any number you want. If you call the contract directly, you can vote plus or -4 million from the current gas limit. And if you use our UI, it's actually 3 million.
00:22:58.118 - 00:24:06.508, Speaker C: So that, you know, there's some safeguards in terms of making sure your transaction doesn't fail. And once the desired gas limit is calculated, it can only be plus or -1 million from the current gas limit. So even if the collective wanted, let's say the current gas limit is 10 million, the collective wanted 12 million, it will end up being set at eleven. And this is so that there's gradual change you know, it gives the, the entire Ethereum network the opportunity to see how a change in the gas limit affects things like the uncle rate or the ability of nodes to process transactions. And it gives miners the opportunity to gradually earn eagles, since they can't just change the gas limit immediately from ten to eleven. Right, they have to do this plus 1% change. And so in terms of incentives, I think something that's sort of quite unique about eagle is if you're a holder, you don't want to break for some, vote for something that breaks the system because it makes the thing you own now worthless.
00:24:06.508 - 00:24:14.804, Speaker C: And you don't want to vote for something that perhaps miners may not want to follow, because, again, you're the one that gets hurt from this.
00:24:15.264 - 00:25:17.824, Speaker D: So I want to add two things to what Eleni said, like, specifically regarding the incentives of people participating in ego. The first is the question of why would anybody, or the two pieces are bootstrapping right at the beginning. Why would anybody want to have eagles and to participate at all? And the second is like, okay, long term, who are the people or organizations or groups that would like to affect the gas limit? So, in terms of the bootstrapping, as Eleni mentioned, the idea we're not selling the tokens. Anybody could stake ETH. All the ETH that being staked is going to be deployed to balancer with 750 million eagles, our bonuses and whatnot. The numbers are less important, but basically it creates a giant pool ETH and eagles and the LP tokens, right in balance, it's called BPT's. Like those are gradually being released back over time, over a period of a year, back to all the participants.
00:25:17.824 - 00:25:48.534, Speaker D: So you're not buying eagles, right. The idea is like you're getting all of that back while the eagles you got for free, right, by putting your e to the other side, that you're getting eagles from the smart contract. So in terms of bootstrapping, what's the incentive of people to participate? Maybe they want to affect the gas limit. Maybe they want to be part of the system. But there's also a very, like, economic incentive. We want to reward all those who help bootstrap eagle in order to have it value. So there is a place and kind of like to help spin the flywheel.
00:25:48.534 - 00:26:24.100, Speaker D: Eagle starts with value on balancer. So pools are incentivized to follow the, the desired gas limit and the vote. If pools follow it, then the system works. So eagle has value and it kind of feeds itself. So that's kind of just regarding the bootstrapping. But maybe the more interesting piece of your question was long term, okay, in the long term, who are the actors? Who are the people who want to hold Eagle and participate? And the answer is anybody and any group, centralized or decentralized. That has a lot at stake here.
00:26:24.100 - 00:26:55.368, Speaker D: So I mentioned Uniswap Lp's earlier. Uniswap Lp's are not a single person. That's a group. And yes, you have like Uniswap treasuries and whatnot, but this is a decentralized group that would earn more money if the gas limit is optimized to whatever the highest safe level. However, these people also don't want to push it beyond what safe. Because if it breaks Ethereum, that's bad for them. Okay? They have a vested interest in seeing Ethereum and stuff built on Ethereum succeeding.
00:26:55.368 - 00:27:53.830, Speaker D: So Uniswap LP's should want to park some of their capital in ego and vote on what they think is a desired gas limit. If you're coinbase, okay, or any of the other like large actors in this space, and a big chunk of your business is about the success of ethanol and tokens on top of ETH, then you want, if you have the opportunity to have like a seat at the table or a hand on the wheel and drive it in the direction you actually think is best for the ecosystem, then it is very much worth your time, effort and money to participate. And maybe the last thing to say about that is that me and Eleni had a super interesting conversation with the team at a 16 z. Like, I love Ali from a 16 z. I love the team there, and we've been friendly since forever. And we were kind of like asking them, well, what do you guys think should be the gas limit? And they're like, I don't know. It's technical, right? Nobody knows the answer.
00:27:53.830 - 00:28:56.484, Speaker D: Nobody spent any time studying it because it's a moot point. You'll study it and what, you have no way to affect the gas limit. Like, it doesn't help anybody if you'll study it, but if all of a sudden a 16 Z has a way, and these guys are betting billions of dollars on the success of ETH and tokens on top of ETH, if you have a way to try and affect it and increase its success, you bet your ETH that they're going to come and study the topic and pick up the phone and ask Vitalik and talk with their internal experts and talk with all their portfolio companies and anybody that they think has like an important and valuable opinion that are going to take the time, study it deeply and say, well, we think the best value is x. Now, I don't know what x is, but they definitely want to have like the ability and try and affect to help each succeed as much as they can because they're betting really a lot of money on it. And that's kind of like the incentive of participants in the ecosystem.
00:28:58.104 - 00:29:19.224, Speaker B: Actually, on that point, is there a concern of, I guess, cartelization where you have massive holders, right, like the massive vc's in the world, or maybe even miners or mining pools, kind of acquiring a lot of eagles so that they can get to vote on what gas limits that they were going to set anyway to get as many rewards. What are the concerns around cartelization or centralization there?
00:29:21.044 - 00:29:59.424, Speaker C: I mean, I guess personally I don't think it's too much of a concern because it's a market, right. The person who values it most will buy it and be able to affect the, the gas limit. And miners never have to listen. So they still always hold the veto power of falling or not falling eagle. And I mean, a note on that, I'm sure later we'll talk about ETH 2.0. But the economics are still the same in the future, if validators don't want to listen to eagle, they never have to. And so it should be held by those who value it the most that you're willing to pay to own it and vote.
00:30:00.284 - 00:30:08.852, Speaker B: So I guess regardless of who votes, it is still a step function improvement on what the current status quo, which is like four pools controlling everything, right?
00:30:08.908 - 00:30:37.986, Speaker C: Yeah. The improvement is now you have a clear answer of what the eagle holders want, which represent the community. And minors don't have to listen, but they can listen and they themselves have a coordination mechanism where perhaps the smaller 40% now can signal to each other, hey, we're going to follow Eagle and they don't fall subject to this issue of, well, I'm too small, like, who cares what I do anyways, right? They have a mechanism to coordinate with.
00:30:38.010 - 00:30:41.474, Speaker D: Each other and also.
00:30:41.594 - 00:30:43.374, Speaker B: And, uh. Were you going to say something?
00:30:44.114 - 00:31:26.422, Speaker D: Yeah. To the point of the cartel that you brought up. Well, what happens if, you know, put on your tinfoil hat on you? Well, the CIA and the fed are going to come here and they're trying to destroy Ethereum and to do something like malicious there. So first people, or let's say this, if you're trying to do something obviously malicious, right. People come or the eagle gradually adjust, like by up to 1 million per week or something like that. So you can't really just break the system with the wave of your hand. But as Olenny said, if it's being pushed to a point where every, like, the ecosystem feels it's offensive, then pools can just stop following it.
00:31:26.422 - 00:31:55.040, Speaker D: And more than that, if the ecosystem decides, you know what, this is being malicious, this is being abused. We're stopping, we're not like, we're not going to use eagle anymore. Then anybody could say like, well, we're not following, we're not buying it, we're not voting with it. It's not like forcing it on ego. And now it shackles the big sorry on the ETH ecosystem that they can't take it off. They can always say, well, we're stopped using it if it's not valuable. So this is about, like, malicious cartel.
00:31:55.040 - 00:33:01.716, Speaker D: A more interesting question, though, is not malicious cartel, but what if this falls down to the hands of, or as you mentioned, like a cartel, like small actors with very focused, laser focused, like, interest in trying to affect it. Whenever I get this kind of question, I think the general answer is people underestimate who has a lot of stake in ease. Okay, like, who has, yeah, you have like scammers and whatnot, who might want to try and push it to reduce fees or something, even if it's not safe because they have like some shortterm gain they're trying to achieve or something like that. But this is nothing. And the amount of capital they have is nothing compared to stuff like the uniswap LP's out there, like, as a group. Then the amount of capital that they hold. Think about, and again, think about centralized entities like Coinbase or Kraken or Gemini or whatnot, and how much money they have invested in Ethereum and tokens on top of it.
00:33:01.716 - 00:33:41.842, Speaker D: Think about, like, polychain, think about consensus. Think about Pantera. Think about acknowledging you have much heavier bags and much heavier pockets, wanting to see the success of ETH long term. And they're betting, and they have long time horizons and they have the capital, a lot more than your average. I don't know, like fast moving scammer who wants to try to affect it, and I don't know what to gain from it. So that's to say regarding the cartel, regarding the mining, the mining pools getting a lot. The miners and the mining pools actually don't get most of the eagles.
00:33:41.842 - 00:34:09.884, Speaker D: Most of the eagles go to the participants and the ecosystem. So, like the community in Ethereum, but if they keep their eagle and they're not selling them, then they're actually not making money. Right. So it's kind of like, it's kind of like saying, well, what if miners just keep all the ETH? And now they could, or stake it or value. They just keep all the ETH. It would be great if they won't sell your ETH, like, you would love them not to sell their ETH because. Right.
00:34:09.884 - 00:34:42.304, Speaker D: There's the strongest selling pressure out there for Ethan, for any chain, really. So if you're worried about them keeping it, you might as well be worried about anybody else keeping and buying eagles. Like miners. And pools are not unique in that. If they're selling it, like, the alternative cost is the money they could have gotten for the eagles. They're equivalent to a billionaire coming and say, oh, I want to buy eagles and affect it. I don't think there's anything special about mining pools affecting versus any other group.
00:34:44.164 - 00:35:17.024, Speaker B: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And I think Elena also mentioned EIP 1559. So I'd love to kind of pivot the conversation there as well, because that's obviously coming up very, very soon. I think by the time this episode is released next week, we're probably a few days away from the proposed date, but we never know when it's actually launched. Given that AIP 1559 is coming up very soon and it affects gas fees on Ethereum as well. With the change in base fee and whatnot, how does eagle interact with EIP 1559? What are the interactions there or implications there?
00:35:17.364 - 00:35:42.412, Speaker C: Yeah. So we actually think eagle is the perfect complement to E 1559. So first, a quick overview of what 1559 does. It changes the fee auction. It changes how gas fees get determined. It does not change how the block size gets determined. So in 1559, there's this concept of a base fee that gets burned and now does not go to the miner.
00:35:42.412 - 00:36:39.666, Speaker C: And the only time a miner gets paid for including a transaction is when it gets a tip. And tips only exist when there's congestion. That is, the block size is smaller than the amount of transactions that are trying to fit inside of it. So you could see a world in which miners are actually incentivized to create congestion because they can actually earn fees for including more transactions in their block. And so what eagle does is it says, hey, miners, you still get to decide of how big the block should be. Here's another way to earn money to produce a block that its size matches the desire of the community. And so it's almost like the needed key to the puzzle of you get all the benefits of, of a better fee auction with less volatility in what fees should be, which is what e 5059 provides you.
00:36:39.666 - 00:36:53.774, Speaker C: It provides you more certainty about the fee that you're going to pay. And now you also get this lever to affect how much congestion that a miner may be willing to cause on the ecosystem.
00:36:55.954 - 00:37:47.580, Speaker D: I would, I would even add to Eleni here, and I keep doing it. So I'm a terrible person, but something that a lot of people miss regarding E 1559, as Eleni mentioned, like, people pay fee and most of it gets burned. And now just a tiny tip, go to the mining pool or the miner. That means that mining pools no longer have an incentive to increase blocks. Right prior to e 1559, it makes sense to try and increase blocks to include more transactions and get more fees to try to make it to capture as much as they can. Under e 1559, they start to get a lot less money from the transaction. So all of a sudden, even if it's perfectly safe to increase the gas limit, a miner might say, well, if I increase it, it increases the chance of a fork to happen and the block to get uncle.
00:37:47.580 - 00:38:00.054, Speaker D: Then I make less fees or less. Like, my reward is smaller. Why should I increase it? I'm not making more money. I'm like, the tips are really, really small. That's the entire point. We're burning most of the fee. We give them just a tiny bit.
00:38:00.054 - 00:38:30.598, Speaker D: So now my nipples don't have an incentive to try and increase the gas limit. And so this is where eagle comes in and says, okay, here's the incentive for you to try and put the gas limit that the community wants. So it's actually a good compliment. And while I criticize, like, this is a criticism of E 1559, I'm a great supporter of 15. I think it's awesome. It's just that specific point is something that I think most people have missed in the design that makes a lot of sense.
00:38:30.646 - 00:38:46.354, Speaker B: And it's really interesting how complimentary it is. And I think the timing couldn't be better. And speaking of the timing, as we come to the close of the conversation, I love to kind of learn about what's next for eagle. When is it launching? Where can people go and learn more about the Genesis event?
00:38:47.014 - 00:39:38.910, Speaker C: Yeah, so the genesis is scheduled for August 7, around 01:00 p.m. Eastern time. You can call the eagle contract directly, and we have documentation at Docs Eagle vote. Or you can use our Ui, which is just eagle vote, and use metamask to participate in the Genesis. And so the genesis is what Ori explained of you stake your ethan and all the ETH that is staked will get matched with 750 million eagles and sent to a balancer pool. And then anyone that participated in Genesis also gets a share of 500 million eagles that they can immediately use to go vote and be users of eagle. And so Genesis closes at the earlier of 25,000 ETH staked or August 13.
00:39:38.910 - 00:39:52.154, Speaker C: So there is somewhat of an incentive to want to be first so that you can make sure you participate. But also those that participate earlier have their pool tokens and their bonus eagles that they use for voting unlocked earlier.
00:39:53.494 - 00:40:05.434, Speaker B: Got it. So, yeah, you heard it, guys. You got to go check it out as soon as possible before the limit gets filled. So I'm super excited for this and this is such an important project. So thank you so much, Eleni Uri, for coming on the show and explaining to us.
00:40:05.904 - 00:40:07.264, Speaker C: Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
00:40:07.424 - 00:40:08.824, Speaker D: Thank you, Jason. It's been amazing.
