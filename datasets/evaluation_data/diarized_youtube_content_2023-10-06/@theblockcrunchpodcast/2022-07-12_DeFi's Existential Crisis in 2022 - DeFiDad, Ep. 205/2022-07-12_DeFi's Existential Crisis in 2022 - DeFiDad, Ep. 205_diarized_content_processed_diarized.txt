00:00:02.080 - 00:00:07.006, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors.
00:00:07.070 - 00:00:08.754, Speaker B: And builders in crypto.
00:00:17.254 - 00:00:46.336, Speaker C: And before we get started, just a reminder for you guys out there. The Blockcrunch podcast is intended for informational purposes only. Neither the host nor its guests are licensed financial advisors, and nothing discussed should be construed as financial advice. Views held by Blockcrunch's guests are their own, and sponsorship messages do not constitute financial advice or endorsement. With that out of the way, let's jump right in. Now, before we get started with today's episode, I've got some great news for you. Now, a lot of you have been asking for how I analyze projects that I bring on the show.
00:00:46.336 - 00:01:32.120, Speaker C: That's why I decided to create blockchain VIP to share with you all the heavy research that goes on behind the scenes. Now, every week or so, our team prepares an in depth research memo while with things like sector analysis, technical concepts made simple, in depth competitor breakdown, and even interactive models so you can learn about the most important projects before they become important. And our team is putting in hours every week scouring discord, twitter, forums and blogs to help you get an edge in crypto and understand the latest projects and themes at the deepest levels. That goes way beyond just an interview. Now, in addition, we'll also host exclusive AMA's with myself to answer any of your questions. So all of these are only available to blockchain's VIP subscribers. And the good news is that while our interviews will always be free, the VIP tier costs less than one coffee a day.
00:01:32.120 - 00:01:38.124, Speaker C: So head on over to theBlockcrunch.com VIP or click the link in the show notes below to sign up.
00:01:38.984 - 00:02:36.744, Speaker B: Alright, hey everybody, welcome back to another episode this week. Now, if you followed me for long enough, you know that DeFi is my biggest interest in crypto because to me it represents not just one of the more noble pursuits in crypto, but also represents the largest opportunity for me as an investor. But somewhere along the way in the past year or so, it seems like Defi innovation has somewhat stalled, at least to outsiders, and this space has seemingly failed to scale to a mainstream audience the way that nfts or games in crypto seem to have. So, to talk about where Defi is heading now, I'm really excited to bring on one of its most vocal proponents of my friend Defi dad. Defi dad is an investor partner at Fourth Revolution Capital who is raising a new fund currently and an advisor to projects that you've probably used before, like Zapper and Defiant news and so on. And he's one of the most prolific content creators out there, constantly sharing his tutorials on how to use Defi protocols on his very popular Twitter handle and YouTube channel as well. So without further ado, thank you so much for joining us, Defi dad.
00:02:37.684 - 00:03:16.256, Speaker D: Hey Jason. Thanks for having me. Yeah, that means a lot coming from you because you are one of the early content creators that I, I was learning from. And I think part of the value that you've brought along with, let's say, Tom Shaughnessy, is you were investors that were really sharing those early insights in a really nascent industry that was crypto. So anyways, total privilege for me to join you, and I would be lying if I didn't say I was definitely nervous to be in the spotlight versus asking you questions. Hopefully I can live up to the standard here.
00:03:16.360 - 00:03:53.644, Speaker B: No, likewise, man, I've appreciated content over the years. I think everyone who wants to know how to use DeFi, not just learn about the concepts and the thesis, but actually know how to use actual protocols, should definitely follow DeFi that on Twitter. But I want to kind of start with a really big question, which is so, taking a look at the past few years, we've seen kind of nfts just going into mainstream and taking on a lot of popularity and seemingly dimming the spotlight on DeFi. And then DeFi seems to have pivoted to like defined 2.0 with some ponzonomic stuff that didn't work out. So I'm curious, do you think Defi is having an existential crisis now? Have we forgotten what we're trying to build?
00:03:55.184 - 00:04:45.248, Speaker D: So, funny enough, I feel like most of the longtime Defi builders and investors, including myself, I am more comfortable now in this down market than I've probably been for the last two years. So prior to the Defi summer in 2020, which I think was kicked off by compound launching their comp token and having a liquidity mining campaign prior to that, Defi was just weird. Very few people were paying attention to it. At one point there was, I want to say there was like 500 million in total value locked in the summer of 2019. It was mostly about compound. Synthetix maker pulled together, actually was pretty early in getting started then.
00:04:45.296 - 00:04:45.480, Speaker B: Really?
00:04:45.512 - 00:05:40.926, Speaker D: I think Zerion, yeah, pulled together I think launched in the fall and fall 2019, the prizes were worth like 50 or 100 dai per week. I mean, they were really teeny tiny, but this was following a pretty tumultuous bear market. You know, we lived through a very frothy 2017 Ico boom. And then 2018 was like the reckoning. Realizing that a lot of these projects that had vaporware products and had promised everything under the sun, we realized none of it was real. And they were selling their ether that they had raised and basically crashing the price of ethereum. That tends to eliminate a lot of the frothy market participants, and it leaves you with these long term true believers.
00:05:40.926 - 00:06:44.404, Speaker D: There's some radical stories if you go back and you talk to a Robert Leshner about them building compound between 20 17 20 18 20 19, before it becomes basically a household name within Defi. And so anyways, my point is these bull to bear cycles. As much as I think no one wants to admit that the bear markets are a better time for new ideas to be born and to be built out, it's the truth. And so I'm finding that, again, aside from myself, it feels more comfortable now that there's less noise, there's less absurdity, there's less of an assumption that every idea will work and hence pressure to implement whatever is the latest, shiniest object. And so, yeah, those DeFi 1.0 builders, I think, are thriving. We've lived through a pretty tumultuous few weeks, actually.
00:06:44.404 - 00:07:33.954, Speaker D: We're recording this on June 28, 2022, and we've seen three arrows capital basically go insolvent. And we're seeing all these central Luna. Yeah. So this is after the terra Luna collapse, which also then led to a number of crypto banks, centralized lenders, who happened to cater to crypto native assets. Many of those folks are either insolvent or rumored to be insolvent. And so what's been remarkable is that DeFi, despite the fact that if you look at token prices, if that's your measure of success lately, everything's down. Everything is correlated to ether and bitcoin, and ether and bitcoin have dumped while stocks and everything else across the world is dumping.
00:07:33.954 - 00:09:21.096, Speaker D: But if you look at what is the purpose of AAVE and compound as lending and borrowing platforms, and the purpose of maker offering some similar utility, but offering a stable coin that has not de pegged despite all of the selling pressure on the market, if you look at curve as a, like, asset, automated market maker, if you look at Uniswap, these protocols are thriving. So I have been, I think, more quiet about it because I'm trying to be empathetic to the fact that there's just a lot of people who have felt a lot of pain, lost a lot of money just in token prices going down. Also, like the UST collapse, it is fair to say that DeFi truly decentralized finance, not the copy paste version of these DeFi protocols that ultimately lives on a less secure and less decentralized chain. These protocols are thriving. So, yeah, I would say I guess I'm feeling the opposite, that we were in a crisis six months ago. I think that a lot of attention had turned to how can I make the slightest tweak to what are well understood DeFi use cases, and how can I focus on the tokenomics to make the tokenomics very appealing to those who are looking for tokens with value accrual? And anyways, it's funny, we've sort of done this loop, and now here we are in a place where risk adjusted returns are being valued again, and long term focused builders are being valued as well.
00:09:21.280 - 00:09:47.284, Speaker B: No, I absolutely agree. That's such a great point, man, because I was a little bit disillusioned by the number of crypto projects that I was seeing out there, like six, five, six months ago, that are just slight tweaks of uniswap or slight improvements of AAVE. And I guess that leads me very well to my next question, which is, if you really were to zoom out as a Defi proponent 510 years, what is Defi actually trying to achieve? Do you think? We're well on our way to achieving that?
00:09:48.824 - 00:10:58.174, Speaker D: So there are a few different Personas that I tend to think of. The one story that everyone likes to tell, and I think we've been focused on it since probably the start of Ethereum, is how can we help those that are unbanked? And I think the unfortunate truth, of course, has been that those users probably won't benefit still from many, many years. Now. Some are, we have some that there's thriving communities of users that use dai in, let's say, Argentina. And I know Nigeria has a thriving stablecoin community. But in the end, the fact that there are still barriers to being able to convert your fiat into crypto, obviously, network fees, just being able to transact on Ethereum during the bull run was very difficult, which I give credit to the alternative l one s and to the emerging ethereum l two s. They helped to alleviate some of that pressure.
00:10:58.174 - 00:12:24.140, Speaker D: I mean, we were definitely on track to be living with 100 to 500 Gui transactions in the fall and the spring. Well, I guess fall 2020, and then winter, spring 2021. And so regardless of whatever criticisms one might have of alternative l one s, at times, I think downplaying some of their risks and not being able to solve the trilemma scalability type issues. At the end of the day, it opened the door to so many more people discovering defi. And that has been, I think, a net positive, I guess, like nowadays, though, I am most focused on how can we ultimately build for the long term vision of an alternative, censorship resistant finance infrastructure that is permissionless and is trustless? And all those buzzwords together just mean how can we allow people who urgently need access to, you know, new financial tools, how can we enable them to be able to access that? That's one group. Right now, though, we have a thriving community of, I would call them tinkerers, you know, those who are like the early adopters. Sometimes these are simply just the founders of other protocols.
00:12:24.140 - 00:13:12.164, Speaker D: And it's a, it's a very small group. Then, you know, it's. At one point, I thought of DeFi as less than 10,000 users in 2019 and probably early 2020. At this point, though, now we've got, we have those who were exposed to it and figured out how to lend, how to borrow, how to stake, how to be able to trade on something like uniswap. My thinking around this is that most of those folks who have enjoyed using that utility, it will be very difficult to cut off that access. It'll be very difficult for them to turn away from that sort of value. And so anyways, we're talking about two very different Personas.
00:13:12.164 - 00:13:55.664, Speaker D: Those who have, I think, the privilege to tinker with and play with this stuff. Some of them already are wealthy. Some of them, like myself, were just early adopters that were, you know, software nerds and wanted to try something new and, you know, just happened to be, I want to say, fortunate to try in those new applications. The, the third Persona, though, that really sticks out in my head is gamers. So, interesting gamers, yeah, the game. So this became, this is a narrative that I think is reality now. You know, we've, we heard Andrew Steinwald from S.
00:13:55.664 - 00:14:47.864, Speaker D: Fermion. I always mispronounce the name. I think that's how you pronounce it. Andrew Steinwald, and I want to say 2020, put out an essay that basically said, like, there's x billion number of gamers, and these are digital natives. These are folks who, like, enjoy a life of watching Twitch and playing video games and having all this value and social gathering in a digital world. And what that sounds like, of course, is what eventually became an understanding of what's the metaverse. And so I love the idea of building for those that are already here, that already want to be here, that we don't have to force someone who has a high interest savings account at some traditional bank.
00:14:47.864 - 00:15:29.314, Speaker D: We don't have to force that person to start adopting high interest opportunities in defi and teaching them everything that's required for them to get their money into, let's say, stable coins. I think with gamers you can easily imagine some very subtle tweaks to games like NFTs in some cases can act as skins. This is already a use case. It's sort of like taking off. And to me it doesn't take away from the game. It doesn't change the fact that you still have to create a very fun game. You need talented game designers, you need to be a great storyteller.
00:15:29.314 - 00:16:14.960, Speaker D: But it adds this bonus of if I'm holding, let's pretend. And by the way, here's an example of a project that I'm personally invested in. So it's called fives and it's basically like NBA jam, but a web3 version of it. And it's very simple. You will play a game eventually that looks like something like what I would have said NBA jam looked like. Very similar sort of fun and purpose to it. But what if you can own, you know, the players, the skins, and what if those players are skins? What if they have a secondary market value to them? It's just giving me the added bonus of the freedom to be able to possibly trade these.
00:16:14.960 - 00:16:51.724, Speaker D: It's not a guarantee of any sort of financial return. It doesn't mean that I have to play a game that sucks. It's to me, it's just icing on the cake. And so that's that Persona that I'm really excited to see catered to over the next few years. And I think we've both obviously had a chance to invest in certain teams that are building early on in this space. I think one of the most obvious names that comes to mind is alluvium. I'm not an investor in alluvium, but I've admired alluvium from afar because they.
00:16:51.724 - 00:17:40.484, Speaker D: It's just a cool looking game, you know, they're building a cool looking story and, you know, it plays to, you know, the theatrical types of trailers that you expect from AAAA gaming studio. Now, will it be successful? I mean, I have no idea. I mean, it could, it could be all hype, but. But I can. I can attest that I think that they are focused on building a great game. And so if they can pull that off with the added benefits of being able to stake a token and being able to own your avatar, your skins, that's exciting and that's really promising. So anyways, those are three very different Personas I'm thinking of.
00:17:40.604 - 00:17:55.404, Speaker B: That's really, really interesting. And just to clarify here, it sounds like. So do you consider these NfT skins that you can own and trade? Do you consider that part of Defi? Or is it the rails that allow you to trade these things, or like lend or borrow these things? Is that defi?
00:17:56.344 - 00:18:26.128, Speaker D: Good point. So I tend to think of. So there's crypto, and then within crypto, of course, there's some centralized finance opportunities. This is like the coinbases of the world. They've really helped to usher in a certain amount of adoption. Then there's decentralized finance. Decentralized finance is still the plumbing that powers web3 gaming, but at the end of the day, it's a machine.
00:18:26.128 - 00:19:27.544, Speaker D: And so they're piecing together those different components. And so, yeah, maybe I'm off on my own island, but I tend to think of if I'm thinking of the different verticals, it's Defi, web3 gaming. And now I'm starting to be more confident in what I would call web3 media, which could be like an alternative to Twitter or an alternative to any form of media. This is where I could see a bored ape yacht club living inside of that vertical of web3 media, but they still benefit from one another. You would potentially use leading DeFi protocols to allow those who hold, let's say you own a skin in some new web3 game. What if that skin accrues value and becomes very valuable? I think it makes sense that you should be able to borrow against that on something like NFTFi.com. So, yeah, it's interesting.
00:19:27.544 - 00:19:57.134, Speaker D: Now they feel like separate communities, but I think that whatever that next major global rally where we see millions or hundreds of millions, hopefully pour into the space, I think that gaming helps to drive that. But the subtleties of how you interact with your community, how people can ultimately make use of new crypto assets, including nfts, is going to be enabled. Bye.
00:19:59.354 - 00:19:59.874, Speaker B: Hey, guys.
00:19:59.914 - 00:20:35.030, Speaker A: I'm really excited to tell you more about one of my favorite products in crypto right now, DyDX. This is a team I've known since 2018, and they've built one of the best exchange venues out there that also happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly. Now listen until the end, because there's an opportunity for savvy traders out there as well. And here are just a few reasons why I like DyDx over other exchanges. First, it's very liquid. It processes two to 3 billion every day in volume and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording. Which means you can trade things like ethereum, bitcoin, doge Solana and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today.
00:20:35.030 - 00:21:14.382, Speaker A: Second, it's also extremely cheap, and if you're down bad from the bear market, you don't have to worry about gas fees at all because there is no gas fee on starkware L2 where DyDX is built on. Now that brings me to my next point as well. It's incredibly fast. Unlike other L2 and high speed dexs, you don't actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore. And as an additional point, by using Starkware, DYDX also provides users with increased security and privacy. And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature, which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so many different sub accounts. And their iOS mobile app is also live right now.
00:21:14.382 - 00:21:50.394, Speaker A: And it's amazing because it's compatible with Metamask, Coinbase wallet, Coin 98, Huawei Wallet, and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there. And it's available for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today. And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions, the most recent tier in the $10,000 equity tier, have won over $95,000 in rewards. And you can get started with as low as $500 in equity to compete for prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DYDX exchange to learn more. And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:21:54.494 - 00:22:42.746, Speaker B: That's a really, really great way to put it, because at least when I first started noticing nfts and gaming popping off, I was initially a little bit dismissive because the rhetoric that you see in is always like very noble. We're all trying to unbank or trying to bank the unbanked, trying to create these kind of financial rails. And then there are these kids here who are just playing video games. It felt like it was less important and less noble, whatever that kind of implies. But over time, it does seem like this is actually has been the greatest way to onboard new people who are not just like the crypto natives, but like digital natives who are not into crypto at all. Suddenly they're exploring crypto and defi because of this. And the example that you brought up with NFT Fi, which I'm an investor in, I think they're a great example of just defi combining with nfts, and their volumes have been growing every month.
00:22:42.746 - 00:22:49.854, Speaker B: And we actually wrote a memo for our vip subscribers about their specific business model as well. So you guys can check it out in the links below.
00:22:50.274 - 00:23:54.654, Speaker D: Jason so that's another example of a team that I believe deserves OG status as builders. And it's funny too. I just met so this is all really fresh. I just met Steven, who's the founder at of NfTNYC, and the criticism that I had heard because we got to review lots of decks at four rc over the last few years around new NFT lending platforms. And like every bull run, every idea you look at seems suddenly like it might be able to work. You give it more of a shot during the bull run, like mentally than you would during the bear market. I remember looking at Dex and thinking, first off, if you can allow for peer to pool lending, which I'm still very bullish on, that of course will beat out this need to be able to match one lender with one borrower.
00:23:54.654 - 00:25:04.304, Speaker D: But the truth is, I think that nftfi.com is a good example of long term builders hyper focused at building a secure, reliable platform. It's still not governed by a decentralized governance token, but it's a team that's been building for so long, and the smart contracts are so battle tested that those who are lending to those who are borrowing against nfts and those that are putting up their nfts as collateral at this point, there's a greater trust in what is supposed to be this trustless application. And so again, it feels like you're in this bear market now, but we've returned to rational thinking where you value the fact that they've done. God, the numbers are staggering too. It's something like, I think it's like 68,000 ETH or something in loans and however much in Dai. And so that is refreshing.
00:25:04.304 - 00:25:42.358, Speaker D: That's what I mean is that it feels like a builder like Steven and NFTFI can build in peace. And you've got others that are coming along within this space. And this is full disclosure. We invested in a team called Defrag Finance. The co founder is actually the co founder of Zapper Nodar, so long time og Defi builder and they are trying to enable peer to pool lending. So basically the experience that we all enjoy on Aave and compound being able to instantly borrow. They're trying to enable that.
00:25:42.358 - 00:26:13.414, Speaker D: I think these are complementary types of value that are being built by, you know, again, folks who have a track record of building for the long term. And that is something that we really, if you live through a bear to bull to bear cycle in crypto, you learn to not devalue that focus and that long term dedication to building for like a truly decentralized future.
00:26:14.494 - 00:26:19.510, Speaker B: Yeah. And I mean, that's a vertical that I'm paying a lot of attention to, which is Defi rails for nfts.
00:26:19.542 - 00:26:19.710, Speaker A: Right.
00:26:19.742 - 00:26:50.164, Speaker B: So I did participate in some nfts, but I wouldn't say, you know, I was extremely bullish on all the nfts, the way that some of our guests before on the show were. And they're incredibly savvy at it. But the way that I've been playing the NFT, the growth of the NFT vertical is to bet on these rails. Right. So one of the projects we brought on a show recently, which I'm not an investor in, but it's a project called Sudo Amm. They're building an automated market maker for, for nfts, which I think is pretty cool. This is like a great combination of NFTs and defi.
00:26:50.164 - 00:27:23.924, Speaker B: But before I dive into that tangent, you brought up a point just now that I thought was really interesting, this point about finding builders who are ogs and built to the bears. And I always thought that was something that's really interesting with DeFi because given that it's a decentralized movement, people still look to specific voices or specific people in this space as people they trust. So people like Robert Leshner, people like Kane from Synthetix, these guys are seen as, quote unquote, leaders of Defi. So if you have to name, say, like, you know, a handful of leaders in Defi today, who are those people?
00:27:25.424 - 00:28:09.590, Speaker D: Yeah. So it's felt good to see some of these names like, return to the spotlight and sort of, you know, receive the respect, I think, that, that they earned over many years. Yeah, I think a few of them are who you just named, Robert Leshner. He's not only a builder, but he's been investing in all sorts of different Defi projects. One of the things about Robert that makes him a real leader is he's also speaking, as far as I know, I believe he speaks often with regulators. He definitely has tweeted about that. So none of this is, this isn't sort of some speculation or inside knowledge I have.
00:28:09.590 - 00:28:55.230, Speaker D: I'm just going off the fact that, like he mentions pretty often, like, presentations that he's given to us regulators and that matters, you need someone like Robert who can speak their language. Someone else who actually falls into that category is Rebecca Redig at. I think she is their, like, lead counsel at Ave. Probably, probably got her title wrong there. But anyways, Rebecca's another one who I think behind the scenes is instrumental in communicating. This is what DeFi is about. This is what actually is DeFi versus something that portrays itself as DeFi, but it's really just centralized finance reimagined, which, by the way, isn't a bad thing.
00:28:55.230 - 00:29:12.802, Speaker D: I think it's important to distinguish the two because you can see, especially where the counterparty risk has come into play more recently with the likes of Blockfi and Celsius. And so I would say Hayden, I think, still deserves and commands a lot of respect.
00:29:12.898 - 00:29:14.414, Speaker B: Hayden from unitswap.
00:29:15.314 - 00:30:03.464, Speaker D: They will always be one of the darlings of Defi. I mean, one of the voices who, like, he lives across all verticals is Vitalik. This is someone who continues to operate with, you know, I want to say, like an ethical backbone that very few do. I think we're just very lucky and fortunate to have a leader like that who leads by example and, you know, isn't out to flaunt wealth and riches the way I think we've seen, you know, some folks in other communities thinking of some. Yeah, some. Some of the wealth flaunting is probably that. That's some of the most grotesque behavior we've seen over the last few years.
00:30:03.464 - 00:30:54.084, Speaker D: I'm forgetting a few here, though. I want to say, actually, here's someone who's not in the spotlight, but I think he leads as a builder, is the. I don't know if it's founder or co founder of Curve. Michael mispronounce his last name, but he is just a remarkable leader by example. They just continue to build and deploy. First off, they built and deployed on every EVM chain during the bull run, which was very important, I think, to the growth of, call it DeFi or open finance on other chains, but they've also been aggressive to build on new Ethereum L two s. I just have a lot of respect for folks like that.
00:30:54.084 - 00:31:40.764, Speaker D: And then there's the unsung heroes of the space, Fernando from balancer, you know, as a giga genius. And I think they've always worked very hard to be supportive of others building, of course, with balancer. But he's one of those folks who, I want to say, you can sense his belief in, like, building towards a greater net sum, you know, as a community. Not just. Not just, hey, we're balancer and we're going to wipe out every other ammo. I think it's important to have those, like, those, I don't know, Kumbaya types of builders in this space. But anyways, those are a few of the names that are top of mind for me.
00:31:40.924 - 00:32:17.288, Speaker B: Yeah. And if I have to add one name, I think one that has recently come back into the limelight is rune from maker. He's obviously an Og, creating one of the most, I think, well, hands down the most stable, stable coin, decentralized stablecoin. And he's been coming back in the spotlight to kind of work on maker governance. I think there's a lot of drama there happening that I haven't been following as closely as I should. But I think he did set the example for what building a defi should be like. You should have a multi decade type of outlook and not trying to just build for the next six months on kind of what's going to be hype.
00:32:17.288 - 00:32:19.164, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's.
00:32:20.464 - 00:33:00.444, Speaker D: So that's another one. And then, oh, my gosh, Stani is a radical person for the fact that he built aave. And then I thought it was insane that he was wanting to start a decentralized social graph protocol, which is lens protocol. And that's something more we can talk about here today. But that tends to be a foundational building block to web3 media. Once you have that decentralized social graph through lens, you know, you can recreate the likes of Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and so on. And so, you know, again, I give him all the credit in the world.
00:33:00.444 - 00:33:20.974, Speaker D: I thought it was almost like a lack of focus at the time when he started to embark on that mission of building lens. But now he's just one of those, you know, he's one of those people who can, you know, be more effective working on multiple protocols then some people can be at working on one.
00:33:21.394 - 00:34:11.034, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I absolutely agree with that. And what I think is really interesting is that all the names you mentioned are kind of what we'd call DeFi 1.0 ogs, right? People who build protocols back in 2018, protocols that are in the first batch of DeFi. I guess with the exception of Michael from Kerf, who is kind of, I guess, in the newer wave, in that they came after maker. I did realize that a lot of the newer stuff that's been happening in DeFi tends to be a little bit more fragile, and they don't seem to have as much lasting power. So I'm just curious, when you look at the remnants of this bear market, are there newer projects that stand out to you as probably having succeeded the same test that these DeFi 1.0 protocols have gone through? And you think that these newer, newfangled things, they have a good shot of being around in 510 years time?
00:34:12.324 - 00:35:17.908, Speaker D: Boy, yeah, this is a tough one. Six months ago, I think we would have all been able to name at least a few. And I think as the market has continued to correct and we see again people returning to understanding the risk of using different protocols, the fact that there were so many new protocols that were trying to launch new stablecoins, and I just can't believe how many of those are probably going to die off in this bear market. I think, actually, a bigger problem with those has been the inability to reliably liquidate in a down market. So that was something with Solend on Solana, obviously, there was concern, like, it would be probably not possible to liquidate such a large position. But that scenario, it got all the spotlight, and it could have played out on other l one s. So, yeah, going back to DeFi 2.0,
00:35:17.908 - 00:35:48.340, Speaker D: like, what's really thriving, I think a few come to mind. One is convex. Convex finance. And by the way, as we name these different protocols, I'll try to call out if I have any exposure. I don't have any exposure to convex, but I have held CVX in the past. Convex being a platform, that is very simple. All it does is helps you to boost your returns as a curve LP.
00:35:48.340 - 00:36:34.984, Speaker D: And really, Convex, in my opinion, could have been a protocol that could have been cannibalized by curve curve, could have taken the utility that they were enabling and built it themselves, and for whatever reason, they didn't. And I think that Convex throw aside the token price. I know it's down like 90 something percent, like everything else in the market. Convex, for me, has a community who understands how the sausage is made. It's a thriving community of curve LP's, the DeFi users, that I think will survive this bear market. So I'd say Convex was one that came to mind. There's one other one here.
00:36:34.984 - 00:37:14.096, Speaker D: I'm biased because I used to work on the team, but I would give credit to the likes of. I almost want to say these deserve to be defi like 1.0. But I think my friends at Zapper and I think Zerion and even d bank, I'm not as not close with the D bank team, but still an advisor to Zapper and very close with the Zerion team. I think these are teams that actually Zerion was building back in the summer 2019. So that should be even like a DeFi 1.0. These are folks that are long term builders now. They haven't decentralized yet.
00:37:14.096 - 00:38:07.294, Speaker D: I'm not sure what the future holds there. But due credit to them surviving a, you know, a very volatile last few years and continuing to build for, I think, you know, what went from like maybe a few hundred thousand users to many millions of users coming on board. In terms of tokens, though, I'm looking to see if there's anything else here. Top of mind, Convex really stands out. It's one of the few that, like, I thought really it showed up late and it proved itself, whereas many other protocols, I think that they optimized for tokenomics. And at the end of the day, it might not even be their fault. It might be more of attracting the wrong types of holders.
00:38:07.294 - 00:39:19.668, Speaker D: For me, having been into, let's say, uniswap or curve for the last few years, I think I have a different mindset than someone who came into Rari capital later. I've had a lot of admiration for them as builders. I thought they just kept pushing to build new and interesting ideas, not the Ponzi esque type stuff that we've seen with some other protocols. At the same time, Rari was late to the game in terms of launching. Question is, is it Rari more to blame? Or do we just acknowledge the fact that when they launched, they attracted users who I want to say were a little more mercenary versus those who, if you're into Uniswap early on, especially those who earned that airdrop, those were longtime LP's who had felt so much impermanent loss. And it was just a surprise that no one, I don't think anyone ever expected a token out of uniswap. So anyways, yeah, I'd say I'd give.
00:39:19.668 - 00:39:57.974, Speaker D: Convex definitely deserves the trophy for a battle tested DeFi 2.0 token and a token that they did optimize the tokenomics to accrue value. Now they did that, and the token still down 90 something percent. So what does that tell you about optimizing for tokenomics? Shouldn't be the end game. It's all about product market fit. And I believe regardless of wherever the CVX price goes, convex is going to thrive in this bear market. It's one of the few places that you can still optimize stablecoin and like asset LP returns.
00:39:58.594 - 00:40:33.128, Speaker B: And speaking of stablecoin, I'm not an investor here, but I really admire the work that they do at Fracs. I think it's been one of the few decentralized stable coins that has a very sensible design. And we spent like two episodes just dissecting all of the stablecoin designs out there. And then I think the verdict from those two episodes with Ben, who's previously from Mechanism Capital, was that the Frax design made a lot of sense. And I think we kind of saw that play out during the kind of Luna event. All the stable coins were under stress. Even USDT was deep pegging for a few hours.
00:40:33.128 - 00:40:46.500, Speaker B: But, you know, Frax was relatively stable and I really admire what they're doing there. So, and I think they relatively new compared to like the likes of ETH, lend and maker. So maybe Defi 1.5, I don't know.
00:40:46.692 - 00:41:32.550, Speaker D: No, no, you're right. That's another one. And I nothing to add there. I've always been, I think, a little bit behind the ball on how the sausage is made with fracks, but I can keep it really simple. I look at how long it survived, I look at how strong that peg has been, and that is an accomplishment. So much has come and gone, obviously, ust being the most epic collapse of all. You look at Frax and you say, wow, Frax was even at the time, once USt collapsed, I think there was a contagion, not just from the systemic risk involved in DeFi, but it was fear.
00:41:32.550 - 00:42:16.156, Speaker D: Fear of like, what else should collapse. And there was false information. I remember being passed around tether that, like, tether, I think its website was like, was was being attacked, which has nothing to do with the token. But then people started to fear that. And then youve got Frax, which was supposed to be in this four pool through curve. And so thinking back, Fracs definitely crossed my mind as like, oh, boy, like, is this something that could unfairly feel the pain of a totally irrational, fear driven, mega apocalyptic drawdown? And so, yeah, no credit to them.
00:42:16.300 - 00:43:02.924, Speaker B: Yeah. And I always say that there are a lot of things that seem like they work in a bull market, right, business models or algorithmic stable coins in a bear market, you really start to see what might not work. But I think that the best opportunity to really test if something could work is during crisis, when everyone is irrational, when assumptions that are based on efficient markets no longer hold, when those things are out the window and these things still don't break, then that means they probably are going to be here to stay. So, yeah, definitely keeping attention on giving my eyes and fracks. And I think on that note, I'm really curious what you think is still missing from Defi. It seems like a lot of the low hanging fruits with the massive markets, the lending protocols, the trading protocols, the part protocols, they're all built already. So what else do we need to build for DeFi?
00:43:05.784 - 00:44:17.076, Speaker D: One component missing from web3 in general, I think is still a reliable way to establish reputation, or a reliable way to discern who has a reputation that you can lend to. Before this whole three arrows collapse, I was actually very bullish that under collateralized lending in DeFi, which I would say was probably most like, my attention was mostly focused on maple finance. I've always admired them as builders from afar. Biggest regret not buying that token for me personally, during the bull run, just because I knew them as builders and I knew they were aggressively going to grow that protocol. And it made a lot of sense to me. Go after more established crypto, let's call them crypto institutional lenders. With what happened, though, with, okay, so terra collapses, let's just not knowing all the details yet.
00:44:17.076 - 00:45:19.002, Speaker D: We know three arrows becomes basically insolvent at that point. And then there's all these other lenders, centralized lenders, that become exposed to their own failure. And so you have Celsius too, which I've never been invested in or had any sort of conviction that they would survive, but they had an established name. They were definitely, I would say, one of the household brand names, along with a blockfi. And so as far as I know, I thought that, and I should go confirm this, I thought that Maple was either doing lending with them or had done lending with them. And my point is this. I think despite the fact that there's parts of the bull run that I personally was able to not succumb to, I think, some of the ridiculous herd thinking.
00:45:19.002 - 00:46:32.746, Speaker D: I also recognize, like everyone, you do get swept up in the bullishness of it. And so under collateralized lending and defi, whether it's maple finance, I want to say Trufi is another one. There's goldfinch, which I think they're lending more to, like small businesses there's just launched on Polygon. This is exciting to me, that people can lend stable coins to what should be vetted borrowers, which hopefully that whole process is incentivized through, I think, some token incentives. Maple actually does it through a token incentive. But now, after seeing what's happened, I've gone back to that baseline of distrusting absolutely everything unless I can verify it myself, whether it's at the protocol level or whether it's having a very long term relationship, which everything I just said still would have left someone wrecked, I think trusting three arrows. So anyways, under collateralized lending was one I'm excited about.
00:46:32.746 - 00:47:47.004, Speaker D: A shorter answer to add on to that is, I think web3 communications has been long incoming. Every app, whether centralized or decentralized, seems to be missing this component of being able to communicate wallet to wallet. So the Ethereum push notification service, among other protocols too, that are building for this use case. They have been mainly focused on how do we allow you to receive instant, real time notifications based on your wallet address? If you are using an application like Aave, or if, let's say, in the future, yearn wanted to announce to all of the wallets that are in a certain vault that they're going to migrate from that vault to another. This is the sort of platform I think we need to be able to go directly to that wallet address. Because in the web3 world, your identity, if you dumb it down and strip away all the bullshit buzzwords that come up, it's really just your wallet address. Your identity is that zero x whatever hexadecimal thing.
00:47:47.004 - 00:48:38.984, Speaker D: You can have really expensive nfts, whatever. But if I see that you have an NFT that I want to buy, it kind of seems ridiculous that I can't just reach out through your wallet address and message you. So anyways, there's endless possibilities there that we're used to living with in the legacy world. I can tell you my phone since we started is blown up with all these notifications, and I actually use notifications more than email at this point. I rely on it more than anything. So we've got under collateralized lending, we've got web3 communications. I think another use case that's actually, it's very well understood, but it's nascent is liquid staking.
00:48:38.984 - 00:49:37.164, Speaker D: I've been very happy for the Lido team. I think it's remarkable, their success. I think they're almost a victim of their own. Well, okay, not to like having that success has given them, like, I think, the backing and funds to be able to continue to grow, but I'm not sure if any of them ever anticipated growing as quickly as they did. And so I look to folks like rocket pool that are focused on ETH staking, and then I look at multi chain staking, liquid staking, like stator labs, which, by the way, full disclosure, that is one team we invested in through four rc. This is a really simple use case that allows someone who's already long whatever token, so you're already exposed to it. So we're not requiring you to make a trade to get involved.
00:49:37.164 - 00:51:05.098, Speaker D: And if you're going to hold that, in my case, if I hold ETH, barring whether I would be borrowing against that staked ETH and potentially seeing the stef trade at a bigger discount getting liquidated, I would normally want to be able to maximize my passive income on that. I think it probably feels super obvious to a lot of folks, but I think that at this point, the amount of value that was locked up in liquid staking was, it's got to be less than 10 billion as of today. It was definitely around that for some time. And yeah, I'm thinking to myself, that's a multi trillion dollar industry, especially if there are going to be alternatives, EVM compatible or non EVM compatible l one s that will thrive in the future, which I think it's next to impossible that some of these chains won't be revived and will continue to build through this bear market. Those chains that operate on a proof of stake consensus, there's no reason that folks wouldn't want to take advantage of a liquid staking derivative. So as I was saying, liquid staking derivatives, that's a no brainer. Another one is, we covered this earlier.
00:51:05.098 - 00:51:58.024, Speaker D: Being able to borrow against your nfts. If you are a long term collector or you're a gamer who's accruing value through whatever game you enjoy playing, you should be able to borrow against that. I think the future is being able to access liquidity against whatever it is you want. Maybe eventually we do see real world assets represented as nfts. My focus right now is strictly what is digitally native. And I think we've seen there's a thriving community of NFT collectors who would love to be able to borrow against their nfts. I'd say one last one that started to gain Steam during the bull run, but unfortunately the yields were just never competitive enough to really hold anyone's attention.
00:51:58.024 - 00:52:41.870, Speaker D: Fixed income protocols. So being able to. Yeah, just being able to earn, you know, whatever rate it is till x date for those that are newbies to fixed income, that plus being able to borrow against it. There is one protocol we invested in at fourth Revolution Capital. It's called Fiat Dao, and they would allow you to. Let's pretend that I'm lending ether and earning a fixed rate of 4% through the end of this year. One thing that I could end up doing is I could actually borrow against that through Fiat Dao.
00:52:41.870 - 00:53:37.524, Speaker D: So now I've got a fixed income position that I'm reliably going to earn interest on through whatever date, and I'm able to lever up against that. I think ideally the stablecoin positions, though, are what's most appealing there because the chance of liquidation is, barring some other issues, is nearly zero. So that's a really exciting sort of use case. That was something during the bull run we recognized missing. And so yeah, Fiat Dao is one to check out there. If you use element, if you use sense in the future, if you use Barnbridge, these are all protocols that should benefit from that. But Jason, I think that's, I mean, there's so many other things missing, but those are the ones that are really top of mind for me that as a user, those are things that I'm seeking out.
00:53:37.524 - 00:54:08.204, Speaker D: Like I am dying to be able to put together a basket of nfts and borrow however much against it. Nftfi.com, it's still one NFT that you can borrow against, but I know there's an EIP in the works that would allow you to nest multiple nfts. And if they add that, then I'm pretty certain that nftfi.com will support it and I'm pretty sure everyone else, like a deFi, will be able to benefit from it.
00:54:08.664 - 00:55:01.264, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I love that your perspective is completely driven by your own identity as a power user of all of these things, and it makes a lot of sense. You're thinking from very first principles what you want to use. And I feel like these are, this is exactly how investors find businesses that actually have product market fit versus just thinking pie in the sky type of ideas, which happen to be a lot of the ideas we saw back in the bull market. Well, this has been really, really fun to finally bring you on the show, and we learned a ton about how you think. And it's really reassuring to hear from long term supporters of Defi like yourself, to talk about your excitement for the future of defi and reassure us that Defi is not just a scam, it's not just a fad, it's here to stay. So I'm really excited for people to follow you and to follow your videos and podcasts as well. For people who want to follow all your content, what are the best channels for them to do this?
00:55:01.904 - 00:55:49.278, Speaker D: Yeah. Best place to go. So first off, if you're a builder, please reach out to me and my team at fourthrevolution capital and that's like f o u r t h. But then if you want to learn about Defi, web3, gaming, nfts, whatever, you can go to defiedad.com. And also there's lots of videos there. Another thing I just failed to cover here today, l two s there's so much to learn about ethereum l two s if you felt boxed out by transaction fees at any point during the last market, or if you've ever been frustrated to not be able to transact for cheaper and faster ethereum, l two is like optimism.
