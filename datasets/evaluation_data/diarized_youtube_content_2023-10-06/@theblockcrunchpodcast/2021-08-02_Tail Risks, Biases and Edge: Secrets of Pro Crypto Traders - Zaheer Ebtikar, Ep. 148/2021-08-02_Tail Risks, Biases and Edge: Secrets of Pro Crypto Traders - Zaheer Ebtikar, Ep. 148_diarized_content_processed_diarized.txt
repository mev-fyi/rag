00:00:01.120 - 00:00:25.482, Speaker A: Welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the show for crypto natives. Every week we do short but in depth conversations with the most important builders and investors in crypto so you can filter through what's noise and stay ahead of the markets. I'm your host, Jason Choi. Nothing on this show should be construed as financial advice, and my guests, myself and my employer may hold positions and assets discussed on the show. Today's episode is brought to you by perpetual protocol, figment, and Ave.
00:00:25.598 - 00:01:12.596, Speaker B: Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, bitcoin and wider crypto markets just saw a week long sell off of 50% and more in some coins. So what happened? Half the fundamentals changed. Are regulators going to end crypto? Is China going to kill Crypto? How are professional traders thinking and hedging against these risks? Now this is not a markets podcast, but these are the questions that Im sure everybody has in their mind right now given the situation. And more importantly, I want to make sure that our listeners know how to think and not just what to think. And maybe about some of the market insights that we get to discuss on this episode will be helpful to not just traders, but also founders and builders that are trying to make sense of where this market is going and how their teams might be impacted. So with that being said, I'm really, really excited to invite my friend Sahir, or Z, better known as Twitter, on Twitter as split Capital.
00:01:12.596 - 00:01:23.032, Speaker B: He's a professional full time crypto trader for the past three and a half years on the show to share his insights on what is happening in the market. So, Z, excited to have you on and thanks for hopping on.
00:01:23.228 - 00:01:29.776, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks again, Jason. Very glad to finally do this episode. We've been talking about this for a while.
00:01:29.920 - 00:01:52.614, Speaker B: Yeah, we have been talking about this for months and I think there's no better time to bring you on given the crazy stuff that's happening in the markets right now. But before we dive into that, I want to skip the whole walk me through your resume thing because everyone does that. Instead, I'm curious about what was the first time you bought a token outside of bitcoin and ethereum? What was the first time you bought yourself first, quote unquote, shitcoin? And what drove that decision?
00:01:53.194 - 00:02:30.050, Speaker C: Oh man, it's so embarrassing. So, I mean, in 2017, I don't feel that much shame for this, but in 2017 I was actually a big blocker and this is like before bitcoin cash actually flipped or like got close to flipping bitcoin and it just made so much logical sense. I was like, okay, if throughput is the problem, let's just increase the size. Right? Like, this was the. I think they did the bitcoin cash transaction highway where they would show, like, hey, look. Look at how many of these transactions would go through these massive blocks. So I guess bitcoin cash is my first thing that I bought outside of BTC and ETH.
00:02:30.050 - 00:02:37.414, Speaker C: Obviously very embarrassed of that fact. But it was 2017. It was a different time. I quickly realized what makes bitcoin bitcoin.
00:02:38.234 - 00:03:02.644, Speaker B: That's really interesting. I didn't know that about you. I'm also curious about how you got into trading, because, you know, a lot of people got into this space through trading in 2017. A lot of retail traders, they started learning things like technical analysis, but you're approaching trading from a much more sophisticated and professional perspective. So I'm curious, you know, how did you get your start in that? And what was the. What was your kind of foray into this space?
00:03:03.064 - 00:03:34.132, Speaker C: Yeah, I think similar to you, Jason. You know, my background comes from the world of finance, so I've always been interested in markets, things like that, probably more so on the fundamental side than anything else. But being in crypto, it was very unique. I think in 2017, everyone was making money. And I joined the space in late or actually middle of 2017. And basically after everyone got rugged, when bitcoin topped out and all, it's kind of just puked out. I was just determined.
00:03:34.132 - 00:04:17.404, Speaker C: I was like, look, I don't care about this market. I just want to win. And I just kept going deeper and deeper into the trading side of the space. The beautiful thing about crypto that, like, 99% of people don't understand or don't fully appreciate is the fact that data is free. I've seen Corey Hofstein, I've seen even Joe Wiesenthal talk about this, like, time and time again, just, like, how amazing it is for crypto data to be, like, this readily available, right? Like, in equity markets, if you don't have a terminal, if you don't have, like, quandal packages, all these things, you're going to lose. And these things are very, very expensive. That was a really big thing for me early on, too, is just like, okay, there's a bunch of free information out there.
00:04:17.404 - 00:04:19.024, Speaker C: How do I use this to my advantage?
00:04:19.804 - 00:04:43.764, Speaker B: That's really interesting. And I think starting this year, we start to see some of that go away with all these gatekeeped services that are charging high fees for data. But for the most part, if you have a little bit of technical background, then you can parse some data from, you know, these open source blockchains, and you can see money flow in real time. And that's something that I didn't fully appreciate until you brought it up just now. So that's a really interesting point.
00:04:44.664 - 00:05:22.080, Speaker C: Yeah. You know, it's, it's really sick that like, I'm happy that these models ended up working out. Right, like for, for skewing specific, right? Like, they offered the product for free for such a long time that I was almost thinking, I was like, man, when are they gonna start charging? Like, this product's too good. Um, so, you know, I appreciate the fact that they've gone the monetization route, I think, and I'm really tight with the team there. I think going forward, especially if the product is worth it, people are willing to pay. Like you said, if you aren't, you can go recreate it. Every exchange has an API, every Dex has an API, or more or less, and you can just gather a lot of information.
00:05:22.080 - 00:05:25.776, Speaker C: I think that's the beauty of it anyway. If you just want to visualize, that's.
00:05:25.800 - 00:05:49.404, Speaker B: Up to you, most definitely. And speaking of this information, we have to talk about what's happening in the markets right now because we just had a crazy drawdown in all prices. And by the time I think this episode comes out, it will probably be two weeks since the market crash. So can you help us understand just what exactly happened in the market the past week? And is this the end of the bull cycle?
00:05:50.624 - 00:06:54.610, Speaker C: Okay, so I think the second part is a lot harder to navigate than the first part. I can kind of just go through what I saw throughout the, you know, throughout the whole experience from top to bottom. I think you had bitcoin hit a pretty hard resistance at around 60k, right? Like there wasn't any new money coming in that was going to push this thing higher. Every time we got close to range high of 58 to 63, you saw spreads get super wide derivatives just extending way past spot. People kept offloading spot. And you have this classic problem of just imbalance, right? And now people are arguing that it's the other way, right, that things are oversold. So at 58k, like when everyone is feeling euphoric and happy and all these things, like a lot of people, there's a reality check with that, right? You need to think about what are people essentially paying to remain long bitcoin here, and how much is it annualized? And so a lot of people, they're like, oh my God, the bull cycle is over.
00:06:54.610 - 00:07:46.992, Speaker C: It's like, okay, I mean, was it really a bull cycle if you were paying such a high premium to remain long on bitcoin, on leverage, right? And then it's the same thing with all these other alts, right? Like for ether, ether, we just completely ripped through from two k to literally had no resistance, right? Like, even on ETH BTC, which I really hate, but went from 0.03 to like 0.07.08, right. Really quickly. And those kinds of things tend to have a lot of opportunistic people, right? Like, there's a lot of people, like, even if there's not leverage built into the system, there's still a lot of people who just made a lot of money and want to pile in because, oh, my God, it's only going to go higher. And then there's the, you know, the dog money meme. So overall, I think you had before this entire thing just cratered, you had such a big period of time where things were remaining frothy.
00:07:46.992 - 00:08:25.480, Speaker C: And I think what happened in the back of a lot of traders and investors mind was that, hey, like, because we've consolidated at 55, 56, 57k, we're like, totally okay. We don't need to worry about getting dislodged here. And that's a trap, right? Because as we saw, like, any amount of material, bad news can really push price down and much further than people can. Much further than people think. So I think that that's a culmination of what we saw before the crash. Right. During the crash, we saw a series of really, really bad news headlines, right? Like, um, I was talking to one of my good friends, Max, um, about this.
00:08:25.480 - 00:09:14.706, Speaker C: But basically, you know, in the past week or past two weeks, we've had probably the worst news cycle in like, bitcoin history in the mass. In the past three, four years, right? So, uh, I think that coupled with a structurally not so great market, um, you know, the, the potential that, you know, Elon Musk could sell and all these things, it really just drives prices a lot lower than people are willing to anticipate. And that's kind of what you see in the last ten days, get digested. Almost anytime we had any sort of meaningful relief, we just got hit with another piece of information. So that was a lot of what these past two weeks were. And it's not the most sexy thing to hear either. It's not some technical sell off, it's not some, hey, we needed to cool down all this stuff more than anything.
00:09:14.706 - 00:09:29.324, Speaker C: It was just bad news. And people didn't want to hold bitcoin and ETH and the rest of these coins. So that's at a high level what really happened. And then I can go into more detail on what mechanics ended up working, not working in favors of traders.
00:09:29.744 - 00:09:54.032, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely appreciate that. And just to kind of echo that point, it seemed like bitcoin was stuck in a range for a few months. But at the same time, on the back of that, you also see ethereum rallying and defi prices rallying, all these altcoins rallying. So it almost seemed to me like there's two separate markets. Was that kind of your sense as well? Do you think there's maybe two types of participants in bitcoin versus everything else?
00:09:54.208 - 00:10:45.024, Speaker C: So, yes, but the problem is, right, like, so this is, this is a much bigger problem when. When the average person thinks about leverage in crypto, there's two factors of leverage in crypto, right? There's like the perp swap leverage that exists, you know, that you can see every single day. It's like, okay, you know, an interest is mooning or funding, funding rates are going up, and this is like the flavor of the month thing for the majority of crypto. But then there's the other side of leverage, too, which is a lot of borrows. People don't realize this part of it either. Everyone wants to get yield on their crypto. Now, this is a big problem because even if someone is an ether maxi or thinks that ether is going to rip or whatever, and this happens to a lot of people, you forget how quickly liquidity just vanishes.
00:10:45.024 - 00:11:20.334, Speaker C: Even if someone is an ether maxi or they go around in Defi, the number one thing people borrow against is always going to be bitcoin. So if you're borrowing against your bitcoin, it creates a huge structural problem when prices on assets just generally nuke across the board. This is a very systematic thing. As bitcoin price drops, ether remains relatively steady. And it's like, okay, things aren't really nuking. And then you see it just all crumble at once. You see Aave get smacked down like 50% in a day.
00:11:20.334 - 00:12:10.294, Speaker C: And this isn't random, right? These are forced liquidations where people need to top up collateral or go repay loans, that kind of thing. And that's the type of leverage that's embedded in this system that people don't really recognize, especially when things go further south. This is a very new phenomenon. I think Genesis capital, or actually they renamed Genesis trading, but Genesis trading puts out a quarterly memo for what they've done in the market. And since last year, this time their borrow lend desk has ballooned in size. This thing's just gotten absolutely massive. I think you're seeing a lot more of that leverage that might be more opaque to the general market that ended up hitting in these last ten days.
00:12:10.794 - 00:12:24.134, Speaker B: So how do you actually go about monitoring the size and froth of this lending markets? Because to the general founder or even the retail trader at home, there's no way to really get color on just how much borrowing there is happening. Or is there?
00:12:24.994 - 00:13:18.176, Speaker C: It's hard. I think it has more to do with just how much on chain you can see health factors for loans. If, you know, a big funds wallet or something like that, that's generally a pretty decent way to be able to tell how likely someone is to go and purge the books in order to top up collateral or whatever. But more on the borrow lend side, the problem is you're not going to be able to get that information as readily as you might like, but you need to think about it more as levels. It's like, okay, if I think bitcoin is going to dump from here another 510 percent, that's not really problematic. Past liquidations only on purpose swaps, that sort of thing. But if I think that, hey, every single day we keep getting hit with bad news, or every single day, you know, this bad news is only getting worse and worse, right? And we have no sign of relief.
00:13:18.176 - 00:13:58.714, Speaker C: That's when you need to start worrying about topping up on collateral, or, you know, that other people need to start topping up on collateral. So that's a bit of the distinction, right? It's like you can't really tell exactly, like, just like we can't really tell exactly where the liquidation levels are for other people. We make an educated guess saying that, hey, there's probably a lot of pain if we drop another 5% and there's a lot of Oi built up or whatever. But the, at the end of the day, we really don't know exactly where the, you know, the leverage is built up in the same way we don't really know exactly where people are going to hurt the most. It's just, you can estimate almost, you know, a 30% drawdown is going to have a lot of people running for the doors in Defi.
00:13:59.614 - 00:14:38.638, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. And I think this past week was, well, at least the past two weeks, when this episode comes out, was especially consequential for traders and founders who maybe saw the treasuries. If the treasuries are denominated in their native tokens, draw down by 80%, essentially cutting the Runway by, like, 80%. So a lot of founders are asking me, you know, could we have foreseen a crash like this? Like, what are some signs that maybe they should be looking out for? So, besides the size and the froth of this borrowing and lightning market, what were some of the other things that you were kind of noticing or things that you think you should be tracking in order for you to preempt these massive market sell offs?
00:14:38.806 - 00:15:56.534, Speaker C: Well, I think it depends on what your goal is. If you're a token founder and you're worried about your treasury, you should always be worried about your treasury, not just when the price is going south. You should always be thinking about, how do I retain a maximum value so I can make sure that the project lives long term? Because you're not trading the treasury. Okay. It's great that you have ether or whatever, and ether is ripping, but it's like, at the end of the day, you should be actively thinking about how to retain as much capital as possible and deploy. And that takes cash more than anything else. I think, for the broader market, in order to think about how to think about these kinds of sell offs, you got to kind of ask yourself the question, right? This is still the wild west, right? Did anyone foresee Elon Musk going out and fighting his own bags? Probably not, right? But it happened, and that's the crazy thing, right? And so we need to be able to think about these things a lot more clearly of, hey, what if this guy just goes out there and says something really dumb? Or what if, you know, this is the 7th, 17th fucking time that I've heard China Fud, right? At the end of the day, it's like you really don't know what will get picked up and what won't and what can really happen.
00:15:56.534 - 00:16:46.354, Speaker C: And that's why you got to just think about, how do I take value off the table? How do I take. How do I say enough is enough at some point? And that part comes down to everyone's risk management system. Jeff Dorman from Arca always makes this really great point, which is you always got to have some cash on hand to be able to buy these kinds of events, because you could have missed the last three months of price, and this one event could make it all back for you. So it's not only just being, you know, protecting against your downside, but it's also a great way for people to make gains on the upside. So, you know, a lot of my friends have been able to just completely crush it from the bottom till now. So that was from, you know, 32k up to now, almost 39. That, you know, that's a massive trade, 25%.
00:16:46.354 - 00:17:19.706, Speaker C: And in the same way, you can, you know, you get that on Ava, you get that on maker, you get on whatever else. So I think that is the really important thing that people need to think about, is just not only about how do I protect my downside, but also how do I. How do I. How do I make money if this. If the event that everyone's uncomfortable with ends up, you know, actually occurring? A few signs to be able to kind of get deeper into that. One of the most classic ones is always coins getting sent to exchange, right? So if coins are sent to exchange, it's a pretty decent tell that, like, okay, these coins are not getting sent just for people to, you know, you know, just for the coins to look pretty. Right.
00:17:19.706 - 00:17:59.794, Speaker C: Like, people are most likely going to end up selling them. It would be great if someone can do a study on this, on what percent of coins sent to exchange end up actually getting sold in addition to this. It's also just, you know, this is why range breakdowns or breakouts are so important. Because if you've been consolidating for three months and unable to break a level that more or less tells you, you know, that, how much supply is willing to come into the market and how little demand there is, that's kind of bidding up against it. And then on top of that, there's also funding levels, general euphoria, sentiment, that kind of thing. There's always just a valuable time to take things off the table. The worst thing you could possibly do is become a forced seller.
00:17:59.794 - 00:18:19.156, Speaker C: And unfortunately, we saw that en masse, one of the largest liquidation events in a week that we've ever seen, certainly the most in terms of dollar price. So I think that's a very unfortunate thing, but the only way to get out of that is to preempt these things and take size off the table.
00:18:19.260 - 00:18:59.632, Speaker A: Now, before we continue, I'd like to take a moment to share some exciting companies that made this podcast possible. One of my absolute favorite products in crypto is Aave. Aave is a non custodial liquidity protocol, meaning you can earn interest on your crypto or borrow crypto assets without trusting any centralized counterparty to hold your funds. I personally have been using Aave for a long time to earn up to 12% of my USD holdings, like USDC, USDT, or even decentralized stablecoins like Dai or exchange stablecoins like Binance USD which totally blows my bank out the water. And if youre new to crypto and worried about security, Aave has been audited by security firms 13 times in 2020 alone and once already this year which they disclosed fully.
00:18:59.728 - 00:19:01.200, Speaker B: So im really excited to have a.
00:19:01.232 - 00:19:45.076, Speaker A: Product that I love as a sponsor. So go on over to aave.com aave.com to check out which of the assets you'd like to borrow and lend today I'd like to talk about our sponsor perpetual protocol. If you're worried about leaving your funds on an exchange that may be hacked, but you are also tired of paying for hundreds of dollars in gas fees in defi, you should really check them out because they have built a fully on chain exchange on Ethereum and Xdai that allows up to ten x leverage. Now they've also released zero gas deposits in addition to near zero gas fees for trading. And if you are paranoid about smart contract exploits like I am, dont worry because they have also obtained protocol level insurance via nexus mutual and unslashed finance to provide automatic coverage for all traders on perp exchange.
00:19:45.076 - 00:20:20.112, Speaker A: Now today for users outside the US, if you have an Ethereum address, you can already start using perp exchange with no signups. So go to perp exchange blockchain to check it out. Thats perp exchange blockchain. I'm also proud to call Figmin a sponsor of the show. If you are an investor wanting to manage all your proof of stake assets in a single place, you definitely don't want to miss this. Figmin makes it simple for you to generate returns on your digital assets by managing all your proof of stake investments in one place. Their fully managed staking infrastructure and detailed user dashboards give investors the edge they need to stay ahead of the curve.
00:20:20.112 - 00:20:38.810, Speaker A: Figment has some of the widest coverage in the proof of stake market, supporting over 30 mainnet blockchains like Pulse, Polkadot, Cosmos near the graph and celo. So it doesn't matter if you're an individual investor or you manage a fund, Figment is easily the go to solution for everything related to proof of stake in your portfolio. So check them out in the show notes below.
00:20:38.962 - 00:21:16.664, Speaker B: I think a lot of people were conditioned to buy dips throughout the entire bull market and every time there's a dip they lever up and then they immediately win when it recovers. And it seemed like a lot of people were caught in that mindset, but because we were keep on selling off for the whole week. A lot of these people seem to have gotten blown up. So I'm very curious about what types of framework you use to determine how do I navigate these dips? Because a lot of people, after the first 30% dip, they bought, and then there's another 50% down. So how do you prevent that situation from happening? And how do you think about market crashes and kind of entering into assets after market crashes?
00:21:17.104 - 00:21:29.888, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think, you know, you hit it kind of on the head at the end of it, for one. It's like there should never be a time where you're getting levered, you know, 150%, 200% at the. At what you think is the bottom.
00:21:29.936 - 00:21:30.144, Speaker A: Right.
00:21:30.184 - 00:21:51.610, Speaker C: Because that's a great way to get blown out. There's a lot of people. I mean, you know, this, this really comes out of the March playbook more than anything else. Like, if you're a trader and you were not around trading full time back in March 2020, actually, even if you're a token founder, go look at what happened back in March 2020. Go read it. Go. You know, find some articles, find some threads.
00:21:51.610 - 00:22:41.864, Speaker C: You can talk to me about this even, but please, it's such an important time to look at what happened in the market, especially when you think that, you know, things can't get any worse than this. This is, you know, this is more or less the bottom. Like, that was just a system wide failure of all assets, right? Maker just completely stopped working, had to get back, stopped. Bitmex was 80% of the market at the time, had to get backstopped. So these things have happened before, and the best way to learn about them is just looking at what happened historically. I think in terms of being able to figure out how much to size, more than anything, you don't know where the bottom is. If you thought that, hey, Elon, calling for less bitcoin consumption of energy and all these things is the bottom.
00:22:41.864 - 00:23:36.558, Speaker C: You had, like, back to back to back to back to back. Just horrible events that happened in the market, right? Like, you had the, the US, you know, I think it was the IR's was, you know, talking about bitcoin payments over 9000, and then you had China Fud and all this stuff happen more or less. Like, you just have to have ample room in order to, you know, continue playing the bigger picture. And I think that's, like, what gets missed a lot of times, right? So if you're buying on the way down, that's great. You want to be a person who's buying when other people are forced to sell. But you also need to get out of that trade as soon as you're in the profit, as soon as you're in the money, and you're at a level where price is more or less a point of breakdown, a point of strong volume or something like that. If price goes from fifty k to forty k and it bounces to 45k, but it's not really breaking, get out of your position.
00:23:36.558 - 00:24:10.850, Speaker C: If you bought at 40k, you don't need to be a hero and hold it all the way past next time. That's a really important framework for people to remember. It's like you should always be thinking about getting back to some level of cash that is comfortable for you and some level of just keeping profits. The best funds that outperformed in March were not the ones that held levered longs from 4k up to ten k. That's just not an efficient use of capital. The best funds are just the ones who are able to buy the spot and, you know, trade in and out of ranges where people are forced buyers and forced sellers. Right.
00:24:10.850 - 00:24:13.850, Speaker C: That's, that's exactly where you want to position yourself as much as possible.
00:24:13.922 - 00:24:14.154, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:14.194 - 00:24:40.634, Speaker C: So I think there was even a time when we were at 60k, there was a lot of people who were just like, oh my God, like, you know, I can't believe anyone's shorting this. This is so dumb. We're going to 100 all these things. And there's a lot of really sharp traders out there who are just like, I'm very comfy sitting in cash, I just don't care. I can't be bothered. And that's the position you always want to be in. And if you can find the resolve to be able to be in those positions more and more frequently, you will make a lot of money.
00:24:41.614 - 00:25:14.554, Speaker B: That's really interesting advice, and I'd love to take that opportunity to pivot to talking more about your personal strategy and approach to trading as well. And obviously, this is not financial advice, not advising people on how to trade, but giving them a sense of common blind spots and tactics that professional traders like you would use when you're trading. I think most people's first entry, as I mentioned just now, is just looking at charts. They learn about technical analysis, they draw lines in these charts. But I know you're not really a big fan of that. What do pro traders actually look at when they trade and what sort of timeframes are they trading?
00:25:15.014 - 00:26:02.770, Speaker C: Yeah. So this is something that I think more than anything really comes from equity markets. And it's something that this industry will have to learn sooner rather than later. The only thing that matters in crypto are flows, right? And we saw this after March where every single derivatives trader wanted to just keep shorting and wanted the pain to end after we hit three k and we're rallying back up to six, seven, that sort of thing. But if cash buyers are there, it just does not matter what derivatives traders think, even if the market's larger, because at the end of the day, the spot markets, what drives price. So I think with regards to Ta, I don't have beef with TA. It's just everything under the sun gets labeled as Ta and people think it's in some way, shape or form indicative of future events.
00:26:02.770 - 00:26:38.704, Speaker C: Like did I think that Elon or the IR's news or any of that stuff was baked into the chart? Of course not. But Ta generally gives you a decent framework to think like, hey, we've been stalling out for three months, price hasn't gone up, what's going on? That's when you can think about, hey, there's probably going to be a lot of people in pain, should we break 50k? On the downside, should we break 45k again? Right, so this is where the standard Sr thing comes in, right? Like where support and resistance just, just matter so much. Because there's probably a lot of people waiting on either side of that trade.
00:26:38.744 - 00:26:38.920, Speaker A: Right.
00:26:38.952 - 00:27:31.154, Speaker C: So that's the part of Ta that makes a lot of sense to me. The part that doesn't make a whole lot of sense is the people who are like, you know, constantly trading chart patterns that don't always play out or like, you know, they're like, oh, this plays out 60% of the time. It's like, in what market? You know, that kind of thing. I think that's, that's more of the noise and there's a lot of people that I respect a lot that are ta traders and they print and that happens more because they built a system around what they're doing and they've tried it and they've tested it and they're able to use some factors in Ta, using volume, that sort of thing, really high areas of importance. So it's like if there's a lot of volume in an area, that's generally better information to get. Um, but going back to the main point here, I think it flows more than anything. So it just depends like how much more money can come in to any asset.
00:27:31.154 - 00:27:59.958, Speaker C: Right? So, and this is where, you know, the big books really are able to trade the most. And this is where I think a lot of people should be thinking about. Right. Um, so this advice will fall differently for different people. If you're a derivatives trader that's trading, you know, at a prop trading firm, that sort of thing, uh, the outlook will be different. If you're an investor in crypto and you kind of play like weekly monthly timelines, you should think about weekly monthly timelines, not next day. Hey, we're down 3%.
00:27:59.958 - 00:29:13.700, Speaker C: I need to buy the dip, quote unquote. It's not a dip if you're thinking about a monthly timeline. And then if you're a token founder, if you're someone who needs to think about how do I navigate token price and how do I make sure that my platform is doing well, it's like, okay, you need to just think about building, stop thinking about token price, because that's just irrelevant to what you're building. But going back to the bigger picture here, all that really matters are flow. So you need to position yourself as much as possible to just figure out and interpret as much corporate information as possible. This is where it really matters. To find out, hey, why is no one else buying bitcoin on their corporate balance sheet in the last couple of months? How do I interpret this? How do I think about this going forward? Or the GBTC trade? If GBTC is severely discounted and no one's really stepping into to bid this thing up and people are just auto dumping on market, what is that really sending to the rest of the world as a signal? These kinds of things become more and more problematic if you're not paying attention to them and if you're just looking at a chart, because derivatives can paint the chart within a 510 percent band and it can look great, and then it just gets completely destroyed.
00:29:13.700 - 00:30:08.144, Speaker C: So that's the part where it really just matters to look at flows and really matters where the volume really is going, right. I tweeted this, I think, a day or two ago, but we had a record amount of ETH being bought up on market a day or two ago in a one or two year time spent in ETH. So things like that are very important to understand. Obviously, there's some mega buyers coming in to basically collect cheaper coins. So that kind of information sends me a great signal saying, hey, this isn't just another low, droopy point in price. This is a much bigger deal than people want to give credit for. And that's when you can start firing in more size or think about, okay, is this just a dead cat balance or is this going to continue going up?
00:30:09.174 - 00:30:27.926, Speaker B: That's really interesting. And this idea of flow, I don't think most non professional traders are even aware of it. So what are some resources that you use to track flows and what are the most important aspects of flow that you must understand? Is it kind of what institutions are buying, or is it more granular than that?
00:30:28.110 - 00:30:58.884, Speaker C: So I think there's a number of factors here, without getting into the details on this. Number one is obviously, you know, trying to find how, how much spot flow is going on. Right. In the weeks leading up to, actually, in the weeks leading up to the Coinbase IPO, we saw a cash buy and really kind of just cease. This was like middle late March, and that was kind of telling, right. This was a time when not a lot of people were that interested in buying bitcoin. Coinbase wasn't doing that much volume.
00:30:58.884 - 00:31:40.904, Speaker C: So it. It really just depends on finding those kinds of points and data or regime changes. If you see an exchange or if you see any specific asset just constantly getting bid, and no matter the market circumstance, no matter what's going on in the background, that's really important information that people need to find out. That kind of thing is just the base level. On top of that, you need to find things that have flows. Am I going to go participate in shiba or doge or that kind of thing? Not really that much, because I'm kind of blind to that market. I don't really have a great sense of how much are people going to buy, sell that kind of thing.
00:31:40.904 - 00:31:59.914, Speaker C: Whereas bitcoin and ETH, they have massive portfolio placements in the traditional world, more so than any other asset. So you can see institutional adoption of ETH when CME launched their futures. And then a few weeks after that, you just saw CME open, interest just balloon.
00:31:59.954 - 00:32:00.130, Speaker A: Right?
00:32:00.162 - 00:33:01.344, Speaker C: So now you have a lot of people willing to buy ETH. And then there's also relative, there's also a relativity between these, between these assets, too, right? So if I have uni and sushi, right, like this is just an example, this actually didn't end up working out. But the general idea is there, which is if an asset like uni has been on Coinbase for a much longer period of time than an asset like sushi, then I have to imagine that sushi will do a lot better once these flows end up working in its favor. Obviously, if it's front rand, that's a big problem, but more so, meaning that in the bigger picture, you need to be thinking about which assets don't have big on ramps of capital. And once they do get those on ramps, what happens to the price? So thats another way to just think about general flows. Now ETH is becoming a more institutional asset at some value. Itll be, quote unquote, overvalued.
00:33:01.344 - 00:33:23.724, Speaker C: But I think were not at that point yet where ETH is considered fully adopted as an institutional asset, like bitcoin. So bitcoin really obviously has benefited from that a lot from the run of that's just the beginning part of flows. And then there's obviously other stuff that you can look into that it's a little bit more granular.
00:33:24.224 - 00:33:32.564, Speaker B: And are these most relevant on an hourly timeframe? On a weekly timeframe, monthly timeframe, probably daily to weekly.
00:33:32.864 - 00:33:56.698, Speaker C: You really just need to be looking for trends that aren't noisy. I forgot, this is kind of a funny point. I remember, I think it was one of the uniswap members was just like, oh, my God, today we did 7 billion in volume and then like sushi did 500 million or something like that. Well, that sounds great. It's like, I think three and a half billion was from delta, just washroot, wash trading a ton of volume.
00:33:56.746 - 00:33:56.930, Speaker A: Right.
00:33:56.962 - 00:34:31.274, Speaker C: So you really need to make sure that the trend is sustained. Right. So for anyone that was looking for confirmation that there was institutional adoption of bitcoin, you can go back and look at, oh my God, coinbase volumes are just going parabolic. Right. So it needs to be enough of a trend to where you can convince yourself that, hey, this is real, this is real cash buying. And then you can also just use some common sense and figure out, okay, obviously funding is negative here. There's cash buyers, cash buyers willing to buy over the derivative price.
00:34:31.274 - 00:34:33.274, Speaker C: And that should send you a signal.
00:34:34.174 - 00:35:00.054, Speaker B: That's really interesting. And you mentioned this point about table selection as well. You talked about how you're not going to be trading these Shiba coins because that's not a market, you understand. And I think tying into that, I'm curious about what your process is. Right. So when you take a trade on like sushi or when you take a trade on bitcoin, how do you decide that? First, that's the asset that you're going to trade. And second, what are the few things on your checklist that you have to kind of take before you, you take that trade?
00:35:01.114 - 00:35:28.564, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good point. Honestly, it really depends. And a bull market can make you sloppy. So this process has gotten a lot more cumbersome in the last couple of months, especially because of the proliferation of Defi and all of these assets having perp swaps. Hasaka has done a great job on this. Shout out Hasaka. He really focuses on a few names and really tries to find them when they're dislodged completely.
00:35:28.564 - 00:36:19.742, Speaker C: I think, generally speaking, when it comes to these assets, you need to really think about, you know, how much size can I get into? How much size can I get into each one? How much room is there for each one to grow? How much idiosyncratic risk is there built in, in each one? And also, you know, basically where it. Where it's at in the cycle, right. So it becomes a lot more scary buying something that's, like, just absolutely ripping and has, like, high funding rates and everyone wants to get in, and it's the talk of the town. That's generally stuff that I stay away from. If it's a trade on some sort of big catalyst or big event happening, that's a different trait. A lot of people like to front run uni v three or whatever else that ends up happening in the market. That kind of stuff is hairy if you don't have the information.
00:36:19.742 - 00:37:07.876, Speaker C: Obviously, it's also according to the law and maybe not so legal. But in addition to that, it's also just like, you know, finding the right sizing and figuring out a plan of when to exit. A lot of people really need to learn this lesson, especially if they weren't around in March, right, when a trade starts going against you, how do I think about getting out of this? Or, you know, what happens if my conviction is tested? And, you know, all this outcome that I thought was so guaranteed is not actually the outcome. So that's where you need to just draw a line in the sand and think about, okay, I need to get out of this trade, or this thing is no longer working, or my thesis is just incorrect. So just giving an example of this sushi. Actually, I was a big sushi shill for a while. Not shill.
00:37:07.876 - 00:37:32.414, Speaker C: I don't shill assets. But I really like sushi for a while. And a big part of it was generally just because sushi is just undervalued. But the problem becomes, it's like, what is a fair valuation? It's like, is $23 sushi a fair value? Is $13 sushi fair value? It could be. And it's, you know, we're also comparing PE to other defi assets that are. That have gone parabolic.
00:37:32.454 - 00:37:32.630, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:32.662 - 00:38:44.224, Speaker C: So I think a lot of times, you also need to think about, you know, does the market care? Right. You know, is there any room for a fundamental step in matter in a raging bull market if dog money is ripping? So all in, you need to think about, what is my niche? You know, what am I good at? What information can I digest better than other people? And then in addition to that, figure out how much size, how much edge can I get in this? Is it tradable? There's a lot of things that people want it long on, swaps and things like that, but you really need to look at how big you are compared to the rest of the market and how much things can really move. And also, just think about, this happens quite often, actually. A lot of my friends will talk about some asset, and then they'll see the price rip, and it's like, oh, my God, it's ripping. Actually, there's like five of us buying the same thing, right? And it's like we're all just. We're all just market buying ahead of each other. And you need to be really cognizant of that because it is a scary thing, right? Like, the market is really thin on a lot of defi assets, so you need to determine whether it's, like a real catalyst, whether it's real value, or if it's just ten of the biggest vc funds just bagging the same thing.
00:38:44.964 - 00:39:31.424, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a great point. You know, here at spartan, our fund is fundamentals driven. So I kind of get a sense of where we're in the cycle, by how well we're doing in terms of, you know, early on in the bull cycle, it's easy to get kind of size big on fundamentals because everything is cheap, and you're. You can outperform quite easily. Well, I wouldn't say easily, but you can outperform by doing the research, by putting in the work and understanding how these assets should be valued. But then when it gets to the point in the cycle when these dotcoins start rallying and you may start to perform in line or even lag the index a little bit, that's when I know, okay, this is a market where fundamentals may be matter or less right now, where it seems to all have to do with momentum and whatnot. So that's kind of something that I definitely echo a lot.
00:39:31.424 - 00:39:56.384, Speaker B: And you also mentioned this risk about Elon Musk funding his own backs that no one really expected. And this reminds me of one of my favorite books, fooled by randomness, which is just how markets move and how no one can really expect what's happening. So how do you think about these tail risks? Would you hedge against Elon Musk deciding to nuke his own balance sheet for no reason other than maybe his own entertainment?
00:39:56.844 - 00:41:05.944, Speaker C: Yeah. I'm very fortunate to be able to constantly be around people who will, you know, push, you know, push against narratives withstanding the test of time, of saying, like, oh, my God, you know, the next time China Fud happens, it's not going to matter, right? This was the last time everyone talked about China FuD, and then this time it's like, okay, we just, you know, shaved off 25% of crypto market cap. I think, more than anything, it's just like in this market, more than any other market, just insane shit can constantly happen. And you always need to just think about, what is the biggest risk to my portfolio overnight? What can possibly happen? A big thing, especially in Defi. A lot of my friends hold a massive amount of their bags in Defi. How are you going to feel if the thing that you own gets exploited or flash loaned or whatever, and you're now just completely destroyed in terms of net worth? These are real problems, and I think people need to start thinking through a lot more. I think with regards to the Elon stuff, there was still ample time for people to find some liquidity to get out or hedge or do anything like that.
00:41:05.944 - 00:41:36.154, Speaker C: There was a really big options put buyer who bought, I think, $150 million in notional value at 40K strike, who just minted money. I think even people like that, actually, they didn't mint money. They probably just hedged a decent amount of their book. I think those kinds of things are a good way to think about it. My friend Flood said it best, especially when the Elon thing happened. It was totally. I think in that moment, a 100.
00:41:36.154 - 00:42:08.020, Speaker C: You know, this was actually like a, like a 100 IQ thing where you. You know, you're just like, oh, my God. Like, it's not gonna matter. This isn't a big deal or whatever. It's like, no, it is a big deal because institutions will look at this and think, oh, my God, we can't touch this coin, and we need to get out, and, you know, or whatever plans we have are gonna be kind of put on hold. So I think more than anything, it's just like, you really need to be able to digest information better in these spots. And this is a point where I've seen a lot of guys just get completely blown out in the last year.
00:42:08.020 - 00:42:49.680, Speaker C: Right? Like, great quote unquote, traders of the chart get completely blown out because they can't interpret financial information or broader market things or how these events end up working in the traditional market. A lot of people think that the spot buying of Tesla is, you know, the most impressive thing. And it's like, yeah, for sure, a billion dollars is a lot of money, and it's a lot of bitcoin that they ended up buying off market. But at the same time, it's not the billion dollars that mattered. I guarantee that more than a billion dollars worth of spot buying happened because Elon Musk bought. So it's more about the narrative than it is about just the sheer amount of volume that these people do.
00:42:49.712 - 00:42:49.880, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:49.912 - 00:43:02.264, Speaker C: So it's not even about Elon selling his billion dollars. It's more about, can he still sell his billion dollars on top of us? Or, you know, does this just kill the narrative? Does anyone else want to follow up on this? That kind of thing?
00:43:03.204 - 00:43:41.130, Speaker B: Yeah. And it surprises me how powerful Elon actually is, because I think I sometimes overestimate the rationality of the crowds. When Elon said that bitcoin is, you know, horrible for ESG, it's terrible for the environment. Every single Twitter threat that I go on, that's outside of crypto. Twitter has maybe dozens and dozens of retails just commenting on how bitcoin is, you know, bad for the environment. And I distinctly recall this post where there's this guy that bought bitcoin back in maybe 2013, and he's made enough to support his family, and it's supposed to be this wholesome post. And in any other point in the market, you probably would have seen comments from Twitter where people are congratulating him.
00:43:41.130 - 00:44:20.370, Speaker B: But then this time around, everyone saying, well, his wealth is undeserved because he did it on the back of the environment. Right. It was bad for the environment. So I think those are kind of anecdotes to me that shows me how powerful Elon was in terms of driving the narrative home, that bitcoin is bad for the environment and something that obviously manifested in markets as well. So I think that's a great point about narratives that you just brought up. And I'm also curious, in terms of understanding these narratives, how did you get around to getting that type of intuition? Was it just experience, or are there other markets that you maybe studied before or other case studies in different points in time in bitcoin history that influence your thinking?
00:44:20.562 - 00:45:01.650, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm very fortunate to be surrounded by a lot of friends. You're among them, obviously. Jason, I constantly learn from you and other guys that are more of the traditional background in this market. But a lot of it just comes from reading history about this stuff. I think a point of focus for us generally was reading a lot of macro and not saying that, hey, this is what I think is going to happen, or this is where things are going. We're not macro traders, of course, but more so just understanding the implications of actions. I remember when inflation numbers went up, everyone in crypto is like, why is this bad for bitcoin? Bitcoin is an inflation hedge.
00:45:01.650 - 00:45:25.870, Speaker C: It's like, no, you idiot, this means that they're going to taper. So I think it's like just understanding baseline stuff like that. It's like if you don't understand what a bond is, if you don't understand what everyone loves to show the Jerome princer memes and they're great. But it's also like these people don't do this stuff in a vacuum. They're not dumb. These are PhD economists. They have a lot of resources.
00:45:25.870 - 00:46:00.532, Speaker C: They're not going to think about these things in a poor manner. So I think more than anything, it's like making sure you're getting credible information is really a big thing. Making sure that the size of a lot of this stuff is meaningful. There's a lot of people who like to post like, hey, this big group bought some bitcoin. And then you look into the size and it's like, yeah, it's cool that this big group bought, but they also bought like 500k. It's like, what kind of signal is that sending? So that's also something that people need to think about. And it's also just like now.
00:46:00.532 - 00:46:47.048, Speaker C: And this is something I mentioned a year ago, but now we're just so intertwined with global risk markets. Like a trillion dollar, a multi trillion dollar asset class cannot remain unaffected by other risk markets. Because even, and this is the, the biggest point that I want to drive home, and I apologize for having this at the tail end. Hopefully we can give some disclaimers in the beginning saying please listen to the end. But in the same way that people needed to sell down their ETH to make up for their bitcoin losses this past time around, people will sell down their bitcoin. Big funds will sell down their 5%, 6%, 7% bitcoin allocation to make cash if s and P gets rocked. And this is what happened in March, it was not because, you know, people just, you know, thought bitcoin was going to fail.
00:46:47.048 - 00:46:56.104, Speaker C: It's because they needed the cash. What's the kill, you know, what's, what's one of the quickest things they can do? Just liquidate bitcoin. I need to, you know, I need cash more than anything. I don't care about what bitcoin's doing.
00:46:56.144 - 00:46:56.724, Speaker B: Right.
00:46:57.064 - 00:47:39.888, Speaker C: And this is a point where people really need to think about, you know, portfolio concentration. Right. So this is, this is a big theme going forward, and it's only going to get larger as, as crypto native people matter less and less in the future. It's only going to matter more and more what happens in the global environment. If s and P nukes 10% next week, I'm very confident that bitcoin will get demolished as well. So it's thinking about these things not in a vacuum and really being open to other pieces of information. But at the same time, it's also thinking about this market separately and not just as a derivative of SPX.
00:47:39.888 - 00:48:01.884, Speaker C: Right. Because we are a separate market. So it's a careful balancing act between those two. I know a lot of guys who are actively shorting because SPX is down like 20 bps or something like that. One cash buyer on our side could just push it up a couple hundred bucks so that part gets a little bit more hairy. But again, it's time frame preference, that sort of thing.
00:48:02.904 - 00:48:47.920, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. As we come to a close in this, I usually hate to ask questions like this because, you know, no one really knows. But I'm curious about where you think the cycle is handed, because there's a lot of, there's an unprecedented amount of people calling for the end of the bull cycle, which would really cut this cycle a lot shorter than how all of the previous post having cycles have played out. But at the same time, as you mentioned, because now we're so much more intertwined with macro markets versus, you know, the cycle back in 2013 or maybe even 2017. So these cycles might not play out exactly the same or even remotely similar. So I'm curious about what your thoughts are here in terms of bitcoin, ethereum, altcoins and how you personally would be positioned.
00:48:48.112 - 00:49:46.420, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, I really hate the term cycle because in an emerging market asset class like bitcoin, there was some cyclicality in the past, but I don't think it can possibly be cyclical in the future where you have a multi trillion dollar asset class. Just follow what happened five years ago because of some sort of the having or whatever. That just doesn't happen. You know what I mean? People are not going to bid up your assets 20 x because, hey, the chart says we're due for another cycle of sorts. But more generally speaking, I think in terms of, and I really follow adhere to the idea that sue mentions, I think we've escaped cycles more than anything. And this is kind of the idea of a super cycle, but I think of a supercycle as basically just breaking cycles where the asset class is here to stay. There's no more career risk.
00:49:46.420 - 00:50:19.434, Speaker C: There's no more risk of, hey, is bitcoin going to work? Is ether going to work? It works point blank. There's going to be people bidding it. There's going to be people using defi. There's going to be different l one s. This stuff works. And if you want proof of this, if you want proof of a quote unquote super cycle or, you know, the breaking of cycles, just go look at how many stable coins there are out there, right? Like there's, I think almost 90 billion in stable, actually probably more even 90 billion or so in stable coins. That's a massive amount of money.
00:50:19.434 - 00:50:46.908, Speaker C: That's more money. You know, that's a, that's a. I think that's more money than China has in dollars. So that's a lot of money that exists in the crypto ecosystem now, and that money is here to stay. If they wanted to liquidate to USD, they always have the chance to. But these, and these stable coins have only grown in size in the past couple of weeks. So it's sending a very clear message to say that this industry is here to stay.
00:50:46.908 - 00:51:42.724, Speaker C: Asset values can fluctuate, prices can go down, whatever, but net, it's not, it's not the same thing that it was a year or two ago when, hey, there was still a chance that this stuff may take a much longer time to end up working out. I think for now, you know, there's going to be a lot of committed players, a lot of committed actors, a lot of committed, you know, institutions that want this stuff to work out and are willing to, you know, put real size and volume and expertise behind this stuff. And if you want, you know, another great way to look into this is just the sheer amount of talent that's coming into crypto as opposed to any other space. Right. I'm seeing the, you know, the smartest young people come into the space that, you know, that aren't going into traditional roles anymore. And I think that's a really big part for a brighter future. There's, you know, there's a lot of talent from top universities that, you know, they're, they're taking summer internships or learning solidity or that, that sort of thing within Defi and crypto.
00:51:42.724 - 00:52:10.746, Speaker C: So, you know, that's generally what my feel is. I think there's. There's going to be more and more gambling, for sure, and asset speculation, but in the long run, Defi is here to stay, ETH is here to stay, bitcoin is here to stay. And I think that's what matters. And I think the more people, if you're not a trader, don't be. And if you don't want to be a trader, just don't be, because it'll make this entire space sour for you. Just opt to have a much higher time preference.
00:52:10.746 - 00:52:45.306, Speaker C: This is something I've learned from Arthur, from defiance. You really just got to not worry about short term things if there's real value being created, because the price today just doesn't matter. These projects are still so young. These are startups that are in one sushi hasn't even had a year of existence yet, and people are here saying, oh, it's a bearish project, or whatever. It's like these people are iterating at such a fast rate, we can't. To say it's done right now is just so naive and short sighted. So I think more than anything, it's just like we broke cycles.
00:52:45.306 - 00:53:23.874, Speaker C: I don't think we're going to have some sort of big, massive leg up again where we go down to ten k and then go up to 200k or something like that. I think people are here to stay. I think institutions are only going to grow in size. I think the SEC will move to make more guidance and framework clear on crypto, and thus enabling a lot of actors to be able to. To get into the space. People still don't understand how limiting it is because there's no framework or guidance from regulatory bodies. This is one of the major inhibiting factors of why people can't get into crypto and bitcoin.
00:53:23.874 - 00:53:52.766, Speaker C: Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are dying to get in, but they just need a clear way of doing so. Every single large asset manager wants to issue an ETF. This is just a fact, right? Because of how much volume it'll do. So I think so long as these narratives stick, and I think they will stick, we're here to stay. The cycle is not going to break down. More than anything, I'm really looking forward to the development of ether. It's something that I think is just the most interesting part of the space.
00:53:52.766 - 00:54:09.104, Speaker C: And hopefully, as more l two s come live and arbitrary and that sort of thing end up working out. Hopefully gas fees come down, people will really understand the use case of Defi and continue to build better and better apps, not just speculation for making more money.
00:54:10.324 - 00:54:16.344, Speaker B: Yeah, and that's a great note to end this on. But before I let you go, are you more bullish Ethereum or bitcoin?
00:54:17.724 - 00:55:01.876, Speaker C: It's funny, it's like when I got into for anyone who used to trade on Bitmex, you were forced to become a bitcoin maxi because you were using coin margin the whole time. So for all of my friends, weve always been bitcoin maximalist. But I think the advent of DeFi and just how amazing its been to see the NFT space grow, just the usage of crypto just proliferate, stable coins, that sort of thing. I think its just really hard to bet against ether going forward. I think for institutions, not just for the rich aristocrats, for institutions. What makes the most sense is Defi. Just anecdotally speaking and reading research and that sort of thing.
00:55:01.876 - 00:55:46.322, Speaker C: Institutions are much more worried about DeFi than they are about anything else. And people will really have to make a large claim in the area. I think even with this most recent sell off, this is something that I have a really strong conviction on. But I think a lot of funds that saw what paradigm did in 2018 2019 are just still so bitter. A lot of traditional VC's, because there was this $300 million small little VC fund that came onto the block and just bit up Defi and was just so mega long crypto. And I think Andreessen Horowitz is a six $7 billion fund now across all their funds, whereas paradigm is probably around 10 billion.
00:55:46.378 - 00:55:46.546, Speaker A: Right.
00:55:46.570 - 00:56:29.824, Speaker C: So I think you're going to see a lot more just action come in from VC's. And as building in the regular world moves more and more on chain, there's just going to be more and more institutional capital backing this stuff in the VC landscape. I think for borrow lend stuff, it's just really hard to look away from Aave if you have 15. I don't know how much TVL is on Aave anymore, but I think it was over 15 billion at one point that people are just willing to borrow and lend. That's a massive amount of money. I think going forward it's really hard to bet against Ethereum, it's really hard to bet against DeFi. And I think ether will continue to eat up a lot of market cap.
00:56:29.824 - 00:56:54.114, Speaker C: I really hate thinking about it in terms of ETH, BTC I like thinking about it in terms of market cap. I think you'll probably see ETH at some point in the future if ETH two and L two s end up working out, surpass bitcoins market cap, and then I think Dapps collectively will surpass bitcoins market cap in a very near future, uh, should, you know, should things continue to blossom.
00:56:54.894 - 00:57:00.598, Speaker B: Wow, that's definitely a bold claim to make. So I'm really excited to share share this episode out with the community.
00:57:00.726 - 00:57:05.274, Speaker C: Yeah, we're really excited to, you know, hopefully. Hopefully have our bags pumped. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
00:57:06.214 - 00:57:14.206, Speaker B: Well, thank you so much for taking time to do this. I know we've been meaning to do this for a while, so this is incredibly fun and can't wait to bring you on for future episodes.
00:57:14.390 - 00:57:15.734, Speaker C: Yeah. Thanks so much for having me on, Jason.
