00:00:00.160 - 00:00:30.766, Speaker A: The four factors to have a standalone ecosystem is users. 50% of all crypto holders actually already have bitcoin. This is why you have a very good user base to actually start off with. And developers of course, it's been the past 1015 years. Some of course migrated to ETH or Solana, but you still have a very good base of developers as well. And culture loyalty. I don't have to be the dead horse there.
00:00:30.766 - 00:00:46.646, Speaker A: And liquidity, of course, the math goes even just 5% liquidity out of the BTC holding heart wallet basically double today's defi TVL. So that's just to say bitcoin should be an ecosystem of its own.
00:00:46.710 - 00:00:49.054, Speaker B: Three offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:49.094 - 00:00:50.886, Speaker C: Our jobs to buy great tech at great prices.
00:00:50.950 - 00:00:54.822, Speaker A: AI is also libertarian right enable use case that people haven't been able to.
00:00:54.838 - 00:00:58.990, Speaker B: Do today, the next hundreds of millions of players they will come to the market mobile.
00:00:59.062 - 00:02:01.330, Speaker C: My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next twelve months is hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockchain Roundtable. My name is Jason Choi. I'm founder of the angel Fund Tangent, and as a disclaimer before we get started, everything we discuss on the show is not financial advice and is not reflective of our respective firms opinions. Now, the context for this episode is that bitcoin just broke past 50,000 as we record this. And while that is happening, something has happened that was not around the last time that bitcoin did this, in 2021, which is the BRC phenomenon. Now, bitcoin has historically been seen as a digital petrock by many, and while some projects have attempted to give people the ability to build apps on top of bitcoin just like they can on Ethereum, none of them really took off until this year with the introduction of inscriptions, BRCs and their rekindled interest in bitcoin l two s like stacks. So today BRC's are at a $3 billion market cap with projects like Ordi Sats and track out there.
00:02:01.330 - 00:02:20.428, Speaker C: But as a skeptic of this direction, initially I wanted to have an open discussion in this week's roundtable with my trustee co host Sanat, and also a special guest, our friend Katrina from Portal, who has written one of the most comprehensive breakdowns of the bitcoin and BRCA thesis to date. So welcome to the show guys. Good morning or good evening.
00:02:20.506 - 00:02:23.056, Speaker A: Thanks for having me. It's fun to do with friends.
00:02:23.160 - 00:02:33.952, Speaker C: Katrina, let's kick us off. I know that you are a big fan of this bitcoin thesis and you've spent a lot of time digging into this. Can you give us the big picture of why is this exciting to you?
00:02:34.088 - 00:03:00.692, Speaker A: For sure. Let me start off with an introduction of course. I'm Katrina. I'm a partner at Portal Ventures. We're thesis driven crypto investment firm focused on pre seed startup mainly. Our approach is we research the sector, know what we're looking for and back founders with conviction by either leading or co leading their first institutional round. And by no means we're a BTC firm, but it is a thesis we've been looking into since May of last year.
00:03:00.692 - 00:03:53.086, Speaker A: We published our thesis actually on Blockcrunch back in November and just been quite active in this space, so can go to the next one. I prepare some slides as recovering consultant is kind of my habit to have something to guide the conversation, but with big picture question of why BTC? There is a left curve answer and right curve answer. Let's start with the right curve. In short, I think the stars is just aligned for a revival of the BTC ecosystem we have. If you go to the next one, we essentially have three types of catalysts. There's technological catalyst, institutional and macro. When you talk about the technological catalyst, really what made wordmall possible, as in the next slide, what really made worn all possible are the combination of three things.
00:03:53.086 - 00:04:32.136, Speaker A: It's the Segway upgrade, essentially, which essentially creates more space within the block by separating out the witness data to the actual transaction data. And that happened in 2017. Then it's coupled by the taproot upgrade in 2021. Essentially it's relaxing the block structure so you can essentially fill the entire block with one transaction. And in 2022, there's also the ordinal theory, which really gave birth to ordinal. Essentially what it does is give the token id to each satoshi. And the satoshi is the smallest unit within BTC.
00:04:32.136 - 00:04:57.318, Speaker A: There are 100 million Satoshi per bitcoin. And essentially. Casey, read more. Just number all of them. And you can inscribe arbitrary data into each satoshi. So that's really the entirety of the technological catalyst. And this ordinal really has been the trojan wars into just the crypto community to pay attention to BTC again.
00:04:57.318 - 00:05:50.096, Speaker A: And this is kind of compounded by the institutional catalyst. As we know, the ETF has launched and it's one of the most, if not the most successful ETF launch in history. Actually, I think some stats goes over the past month, it accounts for more than 80% of the net new ETF inflow into the US. And also that net bitcoin ETF, I think I saw this morning as 1400% daily increase in terms of trading volume, which no one can really make sense of. So this market condition is additional, you add additional dimension to it is 80% of bitcoin has not been moved for more than six months. So what you find yourself in is a low float condition with lots of unmet ETF order. And what that means is you expect some sort of price action.
00:05:50.096 - 00:06:43.128, Speaker A: Then if I'm a retailer or just an average bitcoin holder, I think to myself, hmm, it's really expensive to acquire more bitcoin now. And what are the ways I can lever up and get more BTC exposure, directly or indirectly? I think that is wonderful propellant for ordinals. Because ordinal essentially, it doesn't really change anything on the base layer, it's extension of bitcoin. And I can buy ordinals directly using my bitcoin without having to bridge my bitcoin to Ethereum. And which was the wrapped BPC approach that didn't really work out in the past. So that's more on the institutional side and related to price action. And if you go to the next one, and again, we have the macro catalyst kind of how do I lever up my BTC? Is the rationale I just described.
00:06:43.128 - 00:07:07.464, Speaker A: But also we have bitcoin halving happen. And usually you expect a lot of volatility around every halving event, then around six months after kind of mark the start of the next bull. Of course, I'm not an economist, cannot predict that, but it's just all of the macro, technological and institutional catalyst compounding and make everyone super keen on BTC again.
00:07:07.544 - 00:07:33.824, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a really succinct summary. Thanks for giving that three pronged approach. And I think I speak for Sana and myself to say that we're probably more like ETH, ethereum guys, or even Solana guys after the last cycle. So we're actually quite surprised to see people interested in building on bitcoin, which I'd love to dive into there. But Sana, I don't know, what was your initial reaction when you kind of saw these brcs taking off, like earlier last year?
00:07:34.204 - 00:08:06.104, Speaker B: Yeah, I was, as you pointed out, surprised. I think a couple of thoughts from me generally on this ecosystem are that I like ordinals a lot. I think they make sense. And bitcoin being this kind of magical og chain building nfts in a technically elegant way on it, is super cool. I really don't like BRC twenties, I think they're super inelegant. And if you look at the interfaces to trade them, like, I don't know if you have that Okex page. It's just like a ridiculous way where you're like, it feels like you're bidding on individual nfts when you're trying to buy tokens.
00:08:06.104 - 00:08:46.064, Speaker B: And so I think there is a lot of energy in the ecosystem. I think where I still remain a little skeptical is two points. One is I'm willing to believe that ordinals and BRC 20 matter a lot. I don't know if it's easy to extrapolate from there to people wanting smart contracts on bitcoin and really wanting a large programmability environment. I'm not sure that follows. And second, I guess I think the ETF is a huge catalyst. But again, I don't know if the same party, the kind of institutions that are buying the ETF are also trying to bridge bitcoin to something like RSK.
00:08:46.064 - 00:09:06.194, Speaker B: I think this ecosystem will take off. But I have always been disappointed by the amount of TVL that platforms like RSK and stacks actually have. Stacks trades at an excellent valuation and it's made a lot of returns for investors. As you guys have pointed out, it's kind of like bitcoin beta these days. So people like buying it, but there's no one using it pretty much.
00:09:06.274 - 00:09:15.130, Speaker C: I mean, Katrina might be about to explain why we are actually this image here on the left side, this little. You want to dive into that a bit, Katrina?
00:09:15.202 - 00:09:57.998, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. Before that, I actually wanted to respond to Senate's comment real quick. So the ornal actually in my mind, is directly related to demand for some more programmability on BTC given. So I have been a native world trader since March. $1,000 inscription fee that I paid to Minsun BRC and it was steep for sure. And even if you just recall back in May, I think it jacked up the gas price to 50 to 100. And there are real people out of whether it's like, if you look at the most adopted, like the most adoption where like BTC payments happening is actually Nigeria, Vietnam, Pakistan.
00:09:57.998 - 00:10:46.616, Speaker A: Those people are price sensitive to the $50 to $100 gas fee. And this is why scaling solutions is actually a necessity that's closely coupled with wardles. And there's a reason we haven't really seen a blur of ward nols happening, because like, very different. And I was going to dive into this kind of characteristic that differs between BTC and Ethereum is for you to be a ordinal trading platform, you also have to be a scaling solution. And necessarily you need more smart contract capability. Just because bitcoin, think of it as the world's dumbest data storage layer, it doesn't really make sense of what's being stored there and what. So for BRC, you actually rely on indexer to make sense of these.
00:10:46.616 - 00:11:24.732, Speaker A: And whether it's on l two, you actually rely on smart contract to make sense of this. So point being, when there is demand, it necessitates scaling, and scaling necessitate programmability. Just a lot of innovation happening on the second layer. There's actually two schools thought a lot of innovation's actually happening on the base layer. And another, I guess, sector with a lot of the 30 l two s popping up. But going back to the left curve, whether you like or not, bitcoin is happening. So if you flip to the next slide, I basically pulled some stats of 2.7
00:11:24.732 - 00:12:08.534, Speaker A: billion market cap creation, 700 million volume. And miners have a lot of say in bitcoin ecosystem and they've earned 300 million of mining fee. Everyone just love it. And truthfully, bitcoin as a chain also need this with every halving, essentially you reduce the security budget. Basically the cost to hack BTC gets happened because you only need to bribe these miners and pay them half the reward they used to get in order to change the transaction block. So there are two ways essentially to counter this. One is obviously the block rewards as their rewards.
00:12:08.534 - 00:12:24.438, Speaker A: And the second part is they earn money from this gas fee. So as the transaction volume on chain actually increase, this helps the longevity of bitcoin to just be sustainable. Otherwise we really don't know who's going to be there to secure the chain in 20 years.
00:12:24.566 - 00:13:15.776, Speaker C: I was confused about who the target market BRC's was for. Because if you think about the bitcoin maxis, or like the stereotypical bitcoin maxi, these guys are very, very distrustful of any type of, I wouldn't say they're distrustful of programmability, but they have been very kind of anti Ethereum vision. They think that bitcoin should be just sound money. You shouldn't try to clog up the block space with programmability, with spam transactions. And then you look at the web, three guys. These guys are obviously mostly bullish on either the modular vision, they're very bullish on Ethereum, or bullish on the monolithic missions like Solana, and they've never really thought about building on bitcoin so it seems like the two big camps that people see in crypto, neither of whom would be natural fans for this. So what has been driving this? Like, I think you mentioned $300 million in fees.
00:13:15.776 - 00:13:21.104, Speaker C: Like what is the average type of person doing these type of BRC activity?
00:13:21.264 - 00:14:15.308, Speaker A: The movement definitely originated more from Asia as we have Asia, BTC Wales and retail, I think over the past year, over the past ten years actually. And those who just want to bury their BTC in the back of their backyard, that market has been saturated. Now what people want is, okay, I have these BTC in my cold wallet. It's not really interoperable with anything else. But how can I just take a small percentage of that and gamble, right? So if we look at the market sizing of market cap of BTC is about a trillion and ethereum is about 300, let's just say 5%. Like people want to gamble 5% of their BTC, that's 50 billion of liquidity injected into DeFi. And if you look at DeFi llama today, I think the ETH TVL today is right around there like 50 billion.
00:14:15.308 - 00:15:10.182, Speaker A: So essentially just double the amount of DeFi activity on chain just by taking 5% of your BTC out to play with it. So I think retail users holistically is driving a lot of these traffic. And developer go where liquidity is and go where they think there's users. And this is actually one of this idiosyncratic trait I really like about BTC. All of the investment and all of the infrastructure setup is actually driven by retail interest and user interest. Right? Like retail users, I think at the state today is quite synonymous given institution are not really playing around with their BTC holding. But yeah, I would say the logic goes, developer goes where users goes and users like it, miners like it because they make money and bitcoin itself need it.
00:15:10.278 - 00:15:29.126, Speaker C: So I guess, Sana, you're not quite it a retail, but you are Asia based and you do try out a lot of crypto stuff. So what do you think needs to happen for you to kind of change your mind in brcs? Is it just like better wallets, better experiences, or is like ideologically, it's just not something that you're interested in as like a, you know, crypto native or kind of defi native?
00:15:29.310 - 00:15:44.932, Speaker B: I mean, I think, I don't disagree with Katrina. Like the numbers talk here. Like BRC twenties are listed on binance. Clearly they're going to be a thing. They're going to be around, people are going to trade them, people around me are trading them. People around me are trading ordinals. So I'm not actually super bearish on BRC twenties and ordinals.
00:15:44.932 - 00:16:25.304, Speaker B: And I think the infrastructure is coming. I'm still a little skeptical that all these people really want to go on chain. Like. I think it's interesting that, for example, Okex Wallet and Okex marketplace are like some of the biggest trading venues for these things. And it makes me think that this is a set of users who are very comfortable around centralized exchanges. Like, I was chatting with another investor yesterday who was chatting with one of the biggest bitcoin founders, and he said in a bunch of his onboarding calls, a bunch of the users they're looking at were like, what's a wallet like? They've never used a wallet before. They've only used like a centralized exchange or like a bitcoin hardware wallet.
00:16:25.304 - 00:16:53.554, Speaker B: I think the user experience around ordinals and BRC twenties has gone fixed to a large degree. Like if you look at the two biggest ordinals and BRC 20 cycles. Like, I remember looking at it when late last to last when early last year, it kind of took off in a big way. And at that time the experiences were honestly terrible. But now if you. I don't know if you've bought an ordinal, but if you buy an ordinal on Magic Eden, it's fine. Honestly, it takes a little while to confirm, but it feels like you're buying an NFT on another chain.
00:16:53.554 - 00:17:29.414, Speaker B: Like, I actually think that has come to a pretty great point. My skepticism is still a little more around the programmability layers and the smart contract platforms. I think I'm still a little confused by why, if there is such huge demand for these things, stacks and RSK just have such little traction and volume and liquidity. But having said that, I also know that Merlin has attracted a ton of TVL recently, so maybe that latent demand is just waiting for the right platform. I'm willing to be convinced.
00:17:29.494 - 00:17:54.124, Speaker A: I think a couple of things. Number one, before BTC was definitely not topical as it is now. And warn all is the Trojan horse into this resurgence of interest. That's number one. And historically, I mean, stacks had, I guess, much slower block time. It was ten minutes before and experience quite painful. But there is an upcoming Nakamoto upgrade at dawn.
00:17:54.124 - 00:18:31.748, Speaker A: Change it to a five minute block time and essentially introduce SBTC where before the friction is still quite steep. There's no way for me to essentially buy stacks using my BTC. I have to bridge it over to I think it's s USDT. And then essentially bridge onto stacks. And that will all change with the catalyst. Another barrier of rootstock. At least I can speak four stacks as the clarity language, and looked into it not too deeply, but enough to kind of understand why there is a new language.
00:18:31.748 - 00:19:15.158, Speaker A: So for example, EVM solidity, there's reentrance attack. And essentially how it's structured is you give permission for third party to withdraw your fund. This is why when a ammunition, for example, Uniswap get hacked, user lose their fund. Whereas clarity language eradicate the possibility of such attack. Essentially when the chain of that. When attack happened to amm written in clarity language, the worst thing that can happen is your trading pair will be halted. So there are actually benefit to using clarity new language or something that's non solidity.
00:19:15.158 - 00:19:46.028, Speaker A: And this is actually part of a different approach that we observed into approaching this programmability. There's the side chain, there's also the meta protocol. Technically BRC 20 or rune or track, those are meta protocol. They're more of an extension on top of BTC versus l two. And how I define l two is they introduce a off chain computation layer. You take some stuff off chain and then put back on chain. So those are kind of just a different design trade offs and choices.
00:19:46.028 - 00:19:58.684, Speaker A: But going back to the question, I think it's a timing thing, it's an ecosystem maturity thing. But it seems to be, again, like stars being aligned for stacks and for a lot of these BTC founders.
00:19:58.764 - 00:20:40.564, Speaker B: I guess one question there is, as you look at investments and you look at, like you mentioned clarity being a lot safer. And what I'm reminded of is that move which powers Aptos and Sui came with a lot of the same advantages, but quite frankly, traction there has also been limited. And EVM continues to rule smart contract platforms broadly. There are green shoots in other places. And so I'm curious, you kind of described the fact that some of these solutions aren't as secure. One kind of observation for me is actually that there's this impression that there's a lot of founders in the space who are like, oh, I'm going to try and build the most secure bridge to bitcoin possible, which also is a little bit of an oxymoron. All the designs I've seen are pretty meh.
00:20:40.564 - 00:21:30.712, Speaker B: And then there are other founders who are just like, yeah, look, I'm going to build a platform that sort of works. It doesn't really inherit bitcoin security in any fashion, but it's a playground for people to play with their bitcoin. And I'm going to do the best job of attracting billions of dollars of TVL. And so I'm curious as you, do you think the mean or median bitcoin user cares a lot about security or are they also just going to ape all their money into whatever platform looks like it's going to give them the biggest airdrop? Because Ethereum users pretty clearly like they ape their money into blast with no problem. And if I think about like as I look at founders, one who is like I'm building this ZK secured solution and another who's like I'm going to get all the bitcoin wheels in Asia to deposit money into my bitcoin multisig. I'm sometimes a little more excited by the latter.
00:21:30.818 - 00:21:52.796, Speaker C: Another way to phrase that question is like how much of the BRC or bitcoin market is already addressed by the existence of WBTC? Like if I can just, if I don't care about, you know, trust assumptions, I trust this company to like do rap bitcoin for me, I can finally put my bitcoin to work on defi already on ethereum. So how much of the market is not already addressed by that?
00:21:52.900 - 00:23:10.714, Speaker A: You know what, that's actually a really good question because the design approach of WBDC is actually quite similar to a lot of the new l two s we're seeing. They're basically sidechain pos on top of BTC. And what does it take to hack something like that is to essentially attack the entire market cap of the validator notes. So to send us question which design approach? You don't care about security until you are actually hacked. And I do think with the EVM approach I have my hot take of EVM approach because wholeheartedly think BTC has all the quality to be a standalone ecosystem of its own, deserve its own VM, deserve its own developer community language security parameters. With the EVM approach, essentially your native token will be ERC 20. Does it make sense to have your bitcoin essentially a bitcoin l two token showing up on uniswap and in order to tap into the liquidity you have to bridge over to bitcoin? Is, isn't that a little antithetical to why we want to do BTC? It's essentially to unlock native liquidity versus to essentially steal more from other ecosystems.
00:23:10.714 - 00:23:24.994, Speaker A: So I have my hot takes there, but I don't know, I don't have a good answer there. Could be argued both ways until something goes wrong with the bridging solution. It's always the trade off between speed and security.
00:23:25.774 - 00:23:31.142, Speaker B: So I guess maybe just to steal. Man, that question. Why do you think stacks has 100 million in TVL and Merlin has a.
00:23:31.158 - 00:23:54.078, Speaker A: Billion and a half stocks I believe have 600 million tvL, if I remember correctly now. But I think it's a lot of the EVM liquidity with Merlin, I would say the interoperability still helps with attracting, whether it's developer onboarding or bridging over from EVM chain.
00:23:54.166 - 00:24:24.080, Speaker C: You mentioned just now that the trust assumptions made by WBTC is quite similar to a lot of the l two s that are building on bitcoin. And I'm also quite. I've noticed recently that there's like two main approaches that seem to be coming from these bitcoin startups that are raising in the past few months. One seems to be like the l two approach, one seems to be like the BitVm approach. Can you kind of walk us through for those not familiar, you know, what the tradeoffs of these approaches are? Why are there kind of these two schools of thoughts?
00:24:24.192 - 00:25:07.304, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So the difference on a high level is the trust assumption. And how much does it take to hack a chain? That's the basic question. So, with the EVM approach, or basically pos on top of bitcoin, what it takes is once you have decentralized nodes of validators, you bribe all of these validators, and that's essentially your security budgets or market cap of your future token, in a sense. And until you decentralize your notes, it will be relatively centralized. Whereas for BiTVM, it's still very early on. A lot of people are very excited, excited by it.
00:25:07.304 - 00:25:48.164, Speaker A: But there's a design trade off. In a way, it's similar to a optimistic roll up, and there are a lot of logic gate in order for you to basically prove the transactions on the base layer. And every logic gate gets very expensive because every logic gate essentially counts as one transaction. And when you map out all of those, it just has a cost trade off you essentially have to do. And now, last time I heard Robin Linus on podcast, there are two functions, very simple functions available. I think you can do some sort of chess on chain using BitVM. But of course, that was during the early inning of the technology.
00:25:48.164 - 00:25:58.262, Speaker A: There's a whole research institute behind BitVM. I think it's a really exciting technology is just. It might take time to come to fruition. That's my understanding.
00:25:58.398 - 00:26:05.310, Speaker C: Would you like to go through the third part of your I don't know if there's a I think we went through the right curve and the left curve, was there a mid curve take as well?
00:26:05.422 - 00:26:12.398, Speaker A: Mid curve would be overthinking of should I do this, should I not do this? And watching Wardy go from $1 to.
00:26:12.446 - 00:26:19.550, Speaker C: 60, that's a good show. I like that. And you mentioned like know to lift and shift mindset. What do you, what did you mean by that exactly?
00:26:19.622 - 00:27:29.596, Speaker A: One thing I hear pretty often from portfolio company in the BTC ecosystem is they talk to investors, talk to community members, everyone's off the Ethereum mindset and kind of do a lift and shift, including the EVM approach, including oh, how come there hasn't been an NFT marketplace? And what's stopping you from having ten other competitors popping up? So this slide, I kind of want to point out very distinct characteristics on BTC and the left side kind of argues what makes an ecosystem successful and why should BTC be its own ecosystem? Number one, the four factors to have a standalone ecosystem is users. 50% of all crypto holders actually already have bitcoin. This is why you have a very good user base to actually start off with. And developers of course, it's been the past 1015 years. Some of course migrated to ETH or Solana, but you still have a very good base of developers as well. And culture loyalty. I don't have to be the dead horse there.
00:27:29.596 - 00:28:47.926, Speaker A: And liquidity, of course, the math goes even just 5% liquidity out of the BTC holding heart wallet basically doubled today's defi TVL. So that's just to say bitcoin should be an ecosystem of its own, and there's no consensus of besides the VM approach using solidity, what is the preferred language? Clarity has its benefit, but it's more of a esoteric language for sure. And would it be rust? Would it be something else? I think the winner is still up for grab. But I am the advocate that BTC deserve its own, its own ecosystem with some distinct characteristic from Ethereum today. And I want to give some example of how projects, for example, differ from BTC, BTC from ETH, amm the example of unclarity if there's attack, and on clarity if there's attack, essentially you won't lose your fund, you will just have your trading pair halted. That's number one. And the hack risk associated with that is just a little different from if it's solidity based.
00:28:47.926 - 00:29:33.264, Speaker A: And indexer is actually a really interesting concept discussed by many in the BRC world especially. So think of BTC as a data, as a notary service. Actually, I was talking to the founder of best in slot about this. Think of it as a notary service that doesn't care what is on paper, but only give you the stamp and make sure this paper is safe. So what you need to do is for additional layer or, you know, some outsider to verify, oh, like what you're putting on paper is actually accurate. And that is what indexer does. And that is completely separate from the concept of indexer in the Ethereum land and which, which also just means you kind of query data off chain and put them in a structured way for easy retrieval.
00:29:33.264 - 00:29:51.136, Speaker A: Right? So the concept there is quite different, and even just from the NFT example, which I already alluded to, for every NFT trading platform on ordinals, you have to be an infrastructure provider as well, or become your own roll up. So those are just examples to make the previous point that bitcoin should be different.
00:29:51.240 - 00:30:39.964, Speaker B: I also haven't dug in, so honestly, Katrina may know more. My understanding is that it's an EVM platform, but aimed at bitcoin. And I think the key differentiator here is just strategy. They have made it very clear that they are going to bitcoin whales, trying to attract liquidity as quickly as possible, leveraging the EVM so that they can essentially get developers to port over EVM applications. Which means if you launch an EVM platform anywhere today, it's super easy to get a bunch of applications launched. And I've just been super impressed by the fact that they have as much TVL as something like blast, and no one is really talking about it. And I think it goes to illustrate in some way the point that Katrina made earlier, which is that a billion dollars of bitcoin is not that much bitcoin relative to other assets.
00:30:39.964 - 00:31:33.204, Speaker B: And I don't know, I'm just more impressed by the fact that I think between Merlin and B squared, they're doing a great job of attracting a ton of TVL and talking to the right bitcoin whales in Asia. And that's why I'm becoming a little more skeptical of a lot of these kind of stacks, like very pure bitcoin platforms. Because to me I just think like, you know, if again, I'm probably using Ethereum mindset here, but it's like, let's say you attract five to $7 billion of bitcoin TVL before your chain launches. Your chain launches, you do a massive airdrop. Suddenly the entire universe of bitcoin holders is like, wow, those people got a big airdrop on bitcoin. You can earn money on bitcoin and you just cement yourselves as the place where people go to earn, yield or play around with their bitcoin. And I do agree with Katrina, there's a lot of security risks here, and it's definitely weird to be using bitcoin with EVM.
00:31:33.204 - 00:32:06.142, Speaker B: But I also think that market dynamics may just dictate that whoever in this bitcoin l two space gives the biggest airdrop eventually wins, because that's how a lot of these things play out. And I think blast on Ethereum is a good example of this, where there's a whole bunch of academic critiques about, oh my God, it's just a multisig, but clearly there's tons of Tvl there, there's tons of very sharp teams building there. They're going to launch, they're going to have a great airdrop, they're going to have a bunch of things to do on the chain, and eventually it won't be a multisig. But I think that just doesn't matter as much as some of the other market factors.
00:32:06.238 - 00:32:47.112, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess bitcoin is kind of missing that moment. I think it just needs that one moment where people realize, wow, you can make a lot of money by depositing some of these things and getting a massive airdrop. So what you need is an actual airdrop to happen for one of these projects and for one of these projects to be valid at a very, very high valuation. So the notion on amount of your airdrop becomes very big. And because those are the type of things that get people to be excited. And we see this all the time in like defi as well, where people see, wow, my friend just got like an x figure airdrop, so I got to start doing defi stuff. I think that will actually push people to be willing to go past the UX friction of using like, non evm stuff or going through the pain of doing inscriptions and so on.
00:32:47.112 - 00:33:44.996, Speaker C: And that itself, I think is probably going to improve as well as there's more wallet startups coming on. So if I have to construct like a bull case for this, it will probably be, we just need that one wealth creation moment, which is crazy to talk about because bitcoin is already way larger than any other asset in the crypto space. It's like 50% of all the market cap, but it does need that kind of degen moment to, to, I guess, introduce almost a new crowd into bitcoin. But it kind of brings me back to the question if people are comfortable with trusting a relatively centralized layer too, just to maybe get an airdrop or get a yield. I wonder what is actually the market for that 5% of bitcoin that Katrina mentioned? Is it going to be mostly people like this who are. I don't care what their security assumptions are, just sign me up if there's an airdrop, or will most of this 5% be people who are very, very security conscious? We only trust kind of. We don't even trust l two s with their own validator set.
00:33:44.996 - 00:34:14.198, Speaker C: We just want to do things on l one. That's like a question that I've been trying to answer, but I just can't seem to find out who exactly this kind of big market would be. Or maybe bitcoiners are just kind of normies who also hold other assets as well. I'm not sure, but I'm sure you guys have probably come across some of the whales that have interacted with these protocols. If you can share some color on what kind of profile these guys are. I think Katrina mentioned earlier that a lot of these are like Asia based kind of bitcoiners. Are these like miners or are these like traders or family offices or.
00:34:14.246 - 00:35:03.454, Speaker A: I think a lot of miners and traders probably, I would say, also differ by use cases. If I hold 100 bitcoin, I'm sure comfortable gambling with five of those. If I lose, it's fine. But then for the 95%, either I want to sit in the cold wallet and that's when security is the absolute most important and they'll probably want to do a sustainable yield on it, then I really do care about the security. If I'm locking it as Tbl somewhere and I don't care about the airdrop because the potential opportunity cost is too hard for a hack to happen. So that's when I really need to choose a chain that has real security with the least trust assumption. But if I'm just gambling and want to do a lever up on word knows, then sure, I don't really care as much.
00:35:03.454 - 00:35:10.094, Speaker A: That would be. I think my answer is very dependent on the use case. And what's the volume you're looking at?
00:35:10.474 - 00:35:41.794, Speaker C: What do you think needs to happen to catalyze that? Like 5% of wealth to really go into these protocols? Because I think when I speak to some of the founders, many of whom you introduced, actually, Katrina, so thanks for that. I think for them the moment has already happened. Like ordinals was the moment to tell them that hey, there's actually stuff to do on bitcoin besides just holding it. But do you foresee we needing some additional catalyst or some sort of project to launch or some sort of airdrop to happen or some sort of event to get people to actually be excited about this at scale?
00:35:42.734 - 00:36:09.762, Speaker A: Absolutely. I think UX still need to improve quite a bit. The friction to transfer BTC from exverse to even OKX to start buying all the warmth brcs that still take an hour. None of that is ideal for average users. None of that is actually tolerable for any average user that's familiar with Solana land or the Ethereum land. So there's a lot more improvement I will flag. It's actually quite impressive.
00:36:09.762 - 00:36:50.934, Speaker A: With the 700 million trading volume of ordinals, I think around 150 happened in the first three months when ornos are not even listed on OKX or Magic Eden. Right. I was part of that wave of traders and I will tell you, each transaction took an hour to come back because I need to wait for all of my UtXo to come back. And also the gas fee was in the range of dollar 50 to dollar 200. And even with that, the volume was triple digit million. So that just speak to the hunger of, okay, I really want to do something with my bitcoin. And I actually think that applies to BRC 20 as well.
00:36:50.934 - 00:37:09.350, Speaker A: I remember when BRC was first introduced again, wasn't listed anywhere, and it's just another digital asset on bitcoin chain where I don't need to bridge my bitcoin to anywhere else and I can just use it. So I think a lot of that propelled just the demand into using BTC.
00:37:09.422 - 00:37:49.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I agree with all of that, though I will say my general view of capital, including bitcoin Capital, that it's more degenerate than you expect. Like capital that is already in crypto. Always if you look at the TVL of things like blast, you see Eigen layer growing to, I want to say, five to 6 billion, just running a giant point farm. You look at even some chains like Manta that are essentially running native TVL programs growing to a billion dollars in TVL. I think a lot of it is actually whatever platform gives some massive airdrop, people will just put their money there. And that's kind of like the wealth creation effect is very real. People will see people making money on these things and they'll be like, I want to make money too.
00:37:49.620 - 00:37:58.100, Speaker B: And I think that's why. And liquidity helps drive those outcomes and that's why I'm still very focused on kind of tracking where the liquidity is actually going.
00:37:58.252 - 00:38:09.754, Speaker A: There was a duration of those liquidity. How many times can airdrop happen? So does that mean when we have 30 different l two that will airdrop and just liquidity rotate into each l two s points?
00:38:10.174 - 00:38:11.234, Speaker B: Seasons?
00:38:12.814 - 00:38:21.534, Speaker A: Yeah. I still think it will land on some chain that has the most security after all, the airdrop. Or we'll just have infinite Airdrop, which will be defi summer again.
00:38:21.614 - 00:39:02.662, Speaker B: I mean, I don't know, actually, I think a lot of chains, like optimism, still hasn't quite launched rod proofs. I think my view is that liquidity gives you a good platform on which to both build like one. You can backfill tech like Polygon is a great example of essentially you can backfill tech, you can launch a chain, get a bunch of TVL, that chain is insecure, and then three years later, you actually have like a state of the art ZK roll up. And second, I think liquidity attracting a bunch of TVL to your chain gives you all these fundraising advantages that essentially lets you solve a lot of the other problems. Problems like in crypto. I think if your platform has a ton of liquidity, you actually get to solve a lot of problems. And there are, of course, very, very short lived problems, short lived platforms.
00:39:02.662 - 00:39:28.770, Speaker B: So it's not always true. But I think, weirdly enough, I actually am someone who thinks that, like, having a few billion dollars in TVL when you launch solves a lot of future problems. And it's rare. Like, I know there are farms like big data protocol three years ago, which had a billion dollars in TVL for six days, but there's a lot of other platforms that just kind of launched. As with ok tech. Like, I'm very bullish on blast. I actually don't think that it matters that it's a multi seg.
00:39:28.770 - 00:39:59.184, Speaker B: I'm sure they'll be able to get to the right stage of l two roll up eventually. The point is more that I see a bunch of founders who are really excited to build on blast, and they're really excited to tap into that billion dollars of liquidity, and they'd rather launch there than on even a ZK roll up like scroll, which hasn't showed the ability to attract so much TVL. So I actually really do think that liquidity can create pretty sustainable advantages over time. And I actually also think, like, there are ways to keep people in their points. That's like the big.
00:39:59.884 - 00:40:31.284, Speaker C: I guess that goes back to Katrina's point about developers going where liquidity is. I guess if we follow that logic then does it make sense? Does it make more sense if you're building some sort of programmability layer for bitcoin to build directly on their one? Like I think the two projects that we've come across is BitVM arch network. They're both kind of focusing on just the L2, sorry, layer one versus like the stacks or Merlin, which are like building fragmented L2 is maybe with their own standards of bitcoin and so on. Is the former approach making more sense from that liquidity perspective?
00:40:31.364 - 00:40:59.728, Speaker A: I think that TAM is big enough to support both use cases and it really differ by what you're trying to do there. There are design trade offs on BiTBM or arch protocol. You just won't have the Solana like blazing speed and for example, word no trading will be impossible on impossible or extremely expensive on the base layer. So it really differ of the trade off and what you're trying to achieve there. So Asa, I do think there's space.
00:40:59.776 - 00:41:29.318, Speaker C: For both and I guess it's a good way to kind of wrap us up here by focusing on the panda renaissance, because I think Sana mentioned this to me as well. Every time there is someone who's interested in BRC's or bitcoin, inevitably refer to this blog post that you've written, Katrina, which is the panda renaissance. So can you kind of walk us through what the thesis is there? You know, how it ties together everything we've discussed today? And I'll pull up the slide here as well for you guys watching on YouTube. You can see the slide up on the screen now.
00:41:29.366 - 00:42:11.778, Speaker A: The inspiration for a piece like this, actually we were looking for the next sector to research into and the mental model we always use is what's growing the pie versus slicing the piece. And PI in this case actually referred to either user or liquidity. So what you kind of always want to look for is what unlocks new liquidity and what grows new user and bitcoin. Just such an elephant in the room for the former and hence really started this research. And also I heard about ordinals, I think it was ETH Denver of last year and it just instantly clicked with the NFT use cases where I don't have to worry about my NFT storage anymore. This is sick. So that's kind of the genesis of looking into bitcoin in the first place.
00:42:11.778 - 00:42:59.954, Speaker A: And the why question I sort of explained earlier on the technological, institutional and macro catalyst. So don't need to double click again here. So three things to outline in the article. One is the why question. Second is kind of analysis of various approach which we covered some in the middle of the podcast. But the couple of buckets we can put into is the side chains which is the POS network on top of bitcoin security budget being the market cap of their token that increase rootstock threshold, liquid network drive chain examples like that and l two. So the DWF actually had a report that listed more than, I guess 30 27 l two s.
00:42:59.954 - 00:43:53.244, Speaker A: A part of the approach is EVM focused, which we briefly touched on, but that's focused on interoperability with Ethereum like platonics and ZK focused. So sovereign roll up like bison Labs that has minimal trust assumption with client set verification where Alpen Labs. I think they have two steps. One require a bit change, which obstacles change, one without and chain away is also a ZK rollups and just more mature l two s that's been there for quite a while like stacks were a lightning network. And to quickly the stacks point earlier of clarity language being quite painful for developers. They're actually introducing these subnet, as you can call them, l three. Those can support rust or can support liquidity solidity.
00:43:53.244 - 00:44:36.536, Speaker A: So there is the interoperability angle coming out on the l three level on stacks. So that's l two and metaprotocol. Those are just token standards. And it's the BRC 20 of the world. Roon recently have a lot of rally built around it because it's created by Casey Retemore, who's the creator of worn all protocol actually, and that you have atomical. So essentially these meta protocols are extension directly on base layer. So if you use a decentralized wallet, you can just directly buy them using your bitcoin natively without bridging to any l two to transact these new digital asset issuance on bitcoin.
00:44:36.536 - 00:45:10.344, Speaker A: One thing I was proven wrong after interviewing some developers. These metaprotocols are not automatically interoperable. They actually operate sort of like separate chains almost. And some of them rely on indexer, some of them don't. But yeah, do not assume they're interoperable, which I actually think in design space. And what to look for making these l two and metaprotocol can talk to each other, can sometimes sort of swap will be a. It'll be an interesting space to explore.
00:45:10.344 - 00:45:23.974, Speaker A: And you have the more frontier innovation like BITBM and the arch network will be happening on the base layer. So yeah, so these are kind of the four buckets of seeing the design approach.
00:45:24.094 - 00:46:00.256, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm always really surprised by how fast many of these things have spun out. I think a lot of these came out over the past twelve months, right? It's pretty insane to see this. And whenever I remember telling Sana that I kind of dismissed the whole BRc thing the first time it took off as a fad, and then when the volumes finally dwindled, I was like, yep, I was right. And then I think five months later, in November of last year, it just skyrocketed to like five times before. And that was like my signal to actually pay attention that there are users here. They might not be similar to myself, but there are pretty sizable users here. So yeah, thank you so much for this breakdown, Katrina.
00:46:00.256 - 00:46:12.220, Speaker C: So for those of you who are listening and watching at home, if you are building any of these things, or even things in this universe that are not mentioned here, feel free to reach out to Katrina. And what is the best way to reach out to you, Katrina?
