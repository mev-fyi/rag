00:00:00.320 - 00:00:52.344, Speaker A: So we upgraded the system in July of this year to not just support private payments, but now for users who have funds inside Aztec, you can call any smart contract on Ethereum from within side Aztec, retain privacy of your balances on Aztec, but also get gas savings when you interact with that smart contract through a process called batching. So we can batch together Bu and John into one batch, and we'll pay a third of the cost of the L1 transaction if we're doing a uniswap trademark. So Aztec connect is kind of this scalable plus private l two. And the combination of all those tools is our development toolkit we call the Aztec Connect SDKs. So that's kind of the current state of the system. Where we're going is a fully programmable private smart contract system. And this is where our programming language, noir, fits into the mix.
