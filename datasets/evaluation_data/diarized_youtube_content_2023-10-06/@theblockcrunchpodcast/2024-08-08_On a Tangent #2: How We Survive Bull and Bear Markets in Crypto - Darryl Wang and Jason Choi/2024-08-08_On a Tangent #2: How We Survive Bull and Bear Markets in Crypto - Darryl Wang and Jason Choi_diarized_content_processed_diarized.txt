00:00:00.200 - 00:00:47.722, Speaker A: My bar is if I think there is a risk that our entire book value can draw down 30% to 40%, not just one position, but the entire book, and I don't know if we can recover immediately. I consider that something that we should protect for. And around mid June I had very credible reasons to think that the market is going to half in value. And there were four reasons I outlined, and number one was hey everybody. Welcome back to on a Tangent, a special segment of the Blockcrunch podcast, where I'm joined by my co founder Daryl from Tangent to talk about our views on the market. Blockcrunch is not a licensed financial advisor and is purely for informational and entertainment purposes only. All opinions are personal and the show may discuss assets that the host or guests have positions in or may be actively buying or selling.
00:00:47.722 - 00:01:25.164, Speaker A: All investments carry risk, so consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions. Now, we released our first episode about six, seven days ago, and the reaction has been insane. I think about 20,000 of you guys viewed this on Twitter, on YouTube, across all channels. And a lot of you asked for part two, where we talk more about the latest market happenings. So today we're going to talk a little bit about what is alpha and edge as an investor, as different types of investors. We're going to touch on the point about inflection points, our thoughts on bears versus bull markets. We're also going to talk about the ETH, ETF, obviously, which recently happened, and we're going to talk about specific verticals that we're interested in.
00:01:25.164 - 00:02:01.020, Speaker A: Now, as an intro to those of you who are new at Tangent, we invest in web3 projects at both the seed stage all the way to liquid markets. Now on the podcast we talk a lot about different founders and thesis. If you're interested in our interviews with founders, you can check out our usual interview series. If you're interested in our venture thesis, you can check out our roundtable series as well. This on a Tangent series mostly focuses on current market happenings, and if you want to, you can also subscribe to us on YouTube. And before we start, as a disclaimer, nothing we discuss is financial advice, and everything we discuss is our personal views only and not an inducement to buy or sell any assets. Daryl, welcome back to the show again.
00:02:01.020 - 00:02:03.220, Speaker A: I think people are very excited to see you once again.
00:02:03.380 - 00:02:09.292, Speaker B: Yeah, it's been a minute. I think last time we were speaking it was close to two, three months ago.
00:02:09.356 - 00:02:13.852, Speaker A: It was May, mid May, but by the time we dropped it, it was July already much worse.
00:02:13.916 - 00:02:16.252, Speaker B: Much worse vibes then, much worse vibes then.
00:02:16.316 - 00:02:23.380, Speaker A: But we've done reasonably well, I think, in 2024. So half a year has passed. It's now July, almost August.
00:02:23.460 - 00:02:23.796, Speaker B: Yes.
00:02:23.868 - 00:02:30.932, Speaker A: So why don't you give us a recap of how we've done as a fund or as a team since the beginning of this year?
00:02:31.116 - 00:03:20.582, Speaker B: Yes, I think generally we were pretty well positioned throughout the entire year. I think we managed to navigate the local tops and local bottoms of the market pretty well. Q two in particular, I think was a very volatile quarter for most people. I think there was a, in terms of dispersion, there was the maximum amount of dispersion between bitcoin as well as the separate alts. We came away as a fund despite being defensively positioned. We were still down 10% on the quarter. But I will mark that as a win in our books, simply because I think if you were actively trading the market during that time, you would realize that most alts were probably down anywhere between 30% to 70% for that quarter.
00:03:20.646 - 00:03:22.446, Speaker A: Liquidation day, since that was the biggest.
00:03:22.478 - 00:03:46.302, Speaker B: Liquidation day in April. And following that, it wasn't the easiest. People expected a lot of v shaped recoveries. We did not get that. A lot of alts just kept bleeding. And, you know, only through the midpoint of July did we experience that recovery that everyone's waiting for. And now, you know, approaching August, we are on our way to all time highs.
00:03:46.446 - 00:04:23.542, Speaker A: Yeah. So as a fun, we're glad to be kind of near high water mark, or at high water mark, actually, as of today. But I think one of the things that I always try to emphasize is that it's not about having one or two good years, right? Because everybody can get lucky once or twice. And I was reading this book called, what is it called? It is called same as ever by Morgan Hauso, who is a partner at a fund called collaborative fund. And he referenced Howard Marks, who I think both of us are big fans of. And Howard remarks, talked about this investor that was never in the top quartile as an investor for 14 years of his career. So he's never had a single stellar year.
00:04:23.542 - 00:05:09.150, Speaker A: But if you put together all those 14 years, he was the top 4% in returns for all investors. So it kind of tells you the importance of compounding and being consistent over time. So one thing that is on the back of my mind, whenever we have a good run, let's say we have a good first one and a half years for tangent, how do we keep this going for the next ten years? So that brings us to the discussion of edge and alpha. Developing edge as an investor in a nascent market like crypto that allows you to perform over time. So I know we've talked about this offline as well, but there's different types of edge for liquid investors and for venture investors. Do you want to touch on what do you think your edges, as in liquid investors? And what are the different type of edges for liquid investors?
00:05:09.690 - 00:06:06.028, Speaker B: So I think on my edge over the years, I think my biggest edge is being able to avoid big drawdowns. I think in crypto, so much of the pain and the loss comes from very small, isolated moments in time where you have black swan events happening and this mass panic and hysteria. I typically work or function pretty well in those situations. And so most of the time, I come out reasonably unscathed through huge market, you know, market volatility moments. And I think if you're able to settle that part of the strategy in the bull markets, it's generally a lot easier. It's a question about, you know, not how much money you lose, but how much money you make. And as long as you're not doing anything too wrong, you typically let the market carry you, and then that's where the compounding of gains happen.
00:06:06.028 - 00:06:58.218, Speaker B: The problem with many crypto investors I see is they can make the money, but they can't hold it. Many such cases, that is the worst thing. So I think we at tangent focus a lot on capital preservation, which is why we have a number of risk limits in place for all the different strategies that we have. We have clear invalidations for most positions that we take, and we try our best to be as disciplined, to stick to those things. But apart from looking at it from a fund level, on an individual level, there are many different types of edges as well. You can focus on perfecting your craft in terms of creating your own frameworks for traits or positions. You can, you know, have better mastery over your emotions as a human.
00:06:58.218 - 00:07:11.050, Speaker B: I think that's one of the most important things as a investor or trader, is just being able to deal with the, with the battles you have with yourself. That's extremely important, as in being, like.
00:07:11.090 - 00:07:14.290, Speaker A: Emotional when correct things are going up or against you, basically.
00:07:14.370 - 00:07:51.846, Speaker B: Exactly. Like if you're suffering in a downtrend or, you know, you're having two or three losses in a row, you know, typically it's very easy to go until and then, you know, size up to try and make back the law the losses that you've, you've experienced. And typically that just compounds the problem. Right. So these are very simple and very human mistakes that everyone makes us as well. We're definitely, you know, guilty of having that to some extent as well. But these are things that you can, I guess, improve on without, you know, needing.
00:07:51.846 - 00:08:39.262, Speaker B: And this is something that anyone can work on basically, you know, other types of ages as well, where if you are looking to break into the space and you don't really know where to start, you know, I think Twitter is an excellent platform for or x, sorry, is an excellent platform for you to begin building your brand. You know, being able to start speaking to people that you respect, that you admire, that you can learn from. I think it's definitely something you can do in an intangible way to sort of slowly improve your standing as a person in crypto. And I think that was one of the big things I did, which we can go into later on at the start of my career that led to a lot of doors opening up in the future for me.
00:08:39.366 - 00:09:16.814, Speaker A: I think one very profound thing you said to me when I was sitting at our office beanbag and talking about different types of edge, you were saying that for liquid investors, aside from name picking, everybody's looking at the same data set, everybody has the same public information. You can look at governance protocols, you can look at a chart, for instance, and everybody sees the same levels, same price, but different people can take away different outcomes and different takeaways from just looking at the same chart. So interpreting information seems to be a type of edge as well. But how do you even start to develop something like that? Get good at interpreting information that's a.
00:09:16.822 - 00:09:32.886, Speaker B: Lot more nuanced as a topic. I think just to make sure audience understands what we're talking about. Ta is, in general, a very relatively simple strategy that most people are aware of.
00:09:32.918 - 00:09:36.438, Speaker A: And this is technical analysis, looking at charts and looking at lines.
00:09:36.614 - 00:10:39.776, Speaker B: And most people do it to some degree, some people do it well, some people do, don't do it well. But the general principles are quite simple to understand. You know, simple support resistances. What happens when you touch support, you break out or you reject, and vice versa. But even though most people, everyone is looking at the same chart, everyone's looking at the same ta, people can often come away with different interpretations of what happens. And this is where I think you bring in the non technical related factors into the decision making framework. So if, let's say you believe a non technical factor, let's say a fundamental factor is more important than the technical factor, then even though price is at theoretical resistance, for example, it should be a buy versus a sell, because what happens if it breaks that resistance? Then you go to new highs pretty quickly, right? So that is the framework.
00:10:39.776 - 00:11:19.910, Speaker B: As a bull, as a bear. If, let's say you think that the fundamental catalyst is not as important than the technical setup, then you are a bear, right? You interpret it as people are logging here into resistance. You're going to short it because bulls won't win. The fundamental catalyst is priced in, for example. Eventually, people will sell off, and you get a perfect timing or entry to short something. So those are two different ways of looking at the same thing. And what it comes down to, ultimately, is what do you overweight and what do you underweight? And this can be distilled into almost every single investing decision.
00:11:19.910 - 00:11:47.484, Speaker B: And from the investing, from this single token decision to an entire portfolio decision, ultimately, it's what do you overweight and what do you underweight? And therein lies your skill as an investor, being able to replicate and being able to be consistent at making that right decision on what to overweight and what to underweight over time is where your edge really shines. I feel.
00:11:47.652 - 00:12:28.890, Speaker A: I've always been very skeptical of ta, because the concept of looking at a chart and drawing some lines can somehow make your money is ridiculous to me. But then, over the years, even if I look outside of crypto, even equity investors, even investors who operate on very high timeframe, they look at multi year resistance. They use phrases like this. And to me, ta basically just represents areas where people tend to have the strongest opinions. So, for instance, bitcoin at 30k, or bitcoin at 60k is where there's the most activity, where most people try to make a stance. So ta, to me, kind of gives me a hint of, okay, when I should be paying attention to price and where the signal is strongest, if price goes one way or another. But then that alone, obviously, is not enough.
00:12:28.890 - 00:13:18.472, Speaker A: You have to, I think, know enough about different verticals to be dangerous. So especially right now, because crypto has become more ingrained into mainstream, you kind of have to start looking at macro as well, which, to my chagrin, because I'm not really a macro guy, but I think that's interesting with the liquid side, I always thought the liquid side is a much more complex game than the venture side. And just to talk about the venture edge a little bit, it's quite different, because if on the liquid side, everybody has access to the same information, and it's a game of who interprets this information the best and who manages their emotion. The best when they navigate this information venture is who can even access this information to begin with? Because not everybody has deal flow. Deal flow is not handed to just any investors. So you have to win deal flow. So the edge actually compounds in venture in that.
00:13:18.472 - 00:13:44.532, Speaker A: If you look at some of the historical venture funds outside of crypto, these are the names that have been around for decades, right? Sequoia has been around for a while. A 16 z has been around for a while. And the reason why I think they can be around for so long and still kind of maintain the prestige is because the prestige is the edge. They build a brand and the best founders come to them. So they end up investing in the best founders and the brand gets better. That doesn't really happen in liquid, right. Just because you have a better brand, you're only as good as your last trade.
00:13:44.596 - 00:13:44.964, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:13:45.012 - 00:14:25.914, Speaker A: You're only as good as your last year. So it's very, very different games for tangent. As a fund that kind of invests in both the venture side but also participates in the liquid side, we always are very careful. Okay, what type of edges are we cultivating here? What do we want to focus on here? And speaking of one of the edge we didn't talk about is market timing as well. So how do you navigate bulls and bears? So it leads us to the second part of the discussion, which is about inflection points. So just to give a little bit of context here, I always thought it's really interesting that in crypto, people don't seem to agree on what bull or bear markets mean. You ask ten different people what a bear market is, you get ten different answers.
00:14:25.914 - 00:14:55.130, Speaker A: Some people say, oh, it's when things draw down 90% and then another 90%, or if things draw down 40% in one day, that's a bear market. So it's a stark contrast to equities, where there is a widely agreed upon definition. In equities, indices draw down 20%. That is the dictionary definition of a bear market. Doesn't matter what the timeframe is. One day, six months, one year in crypto doesn't seem like people agree on that. So in your mind, when people use the terms bull and bears, what are you thinking of?
00:14:56.390 - 00:16:04.970, Speaker B: I think bull markets are basically up, only trending markets that go on on a multi week or multi month time horizon. I think as long as certain trend lines stay intact, for example, the bull market sort of market structure remains intact, and you're still basically in a bull if you lose that market structure. So let's say in our case, bitcoin losing 60k for the second time and then touching 54k. That actually was, I think, in theory, a loss of a bull market in terms of market structure, but then we quickly reclaimed it. So now I think the high timeframe setup is quite murky and we're still within range. So now it's like you can say that the bull market has resumed, but, you know, understanding whether you're in a bull or bet didn't really help you all that much. I think what's more important is understanding where you are today.
00:16:04.970 - 00:16:26.202, Speaker B: If you are in an uptrend today, that should dictate what your framework is in terms of understanding positions and understanding aggression. If you are in a bear market today, that should skew to a lot more. You should be a lot more defensively positioned.
00:16:26.306 - 00:17:10.694, Speaker A: And that's something that I think Howard Marks talks about as well, who I'm a disciple of. And he always talks about investing is not a game of prediction. You're not trying to predict what's happening in the next three, six months, because nobody can do that. You can't just look at the crystal ball and say that, hey, prices are going to do this and this and this, even though those are the statements that tend to grab attention and headlines. Right? So people think that great investors know exactly what's happening in twelve months. But Howard Marks basically said that it's more important to recognize what regime you are in today and that understand that if you are in that regime, probabilistically, what are the best things for you to do. So if you believe that you're in a regime where volatility is expanding mostly to the upside, capital inflow is increasing, major trend lines are intact.
00:17:10.694 - 00:17:56.510, Speaker A: That's what most people would call a bull market, then you probably want to risk on, as you said. But I always thought that bull and bears are only obvious in hindsight, right. You can look at 2022 and say, oh, yeah, that was a bear market, but at the beginning of 2022, at the end of 2021, it's very hard to say that we're going to enter a one year bear market. But actually, those are the so called inflection points when you change from one regime to another, that I think you should be very cognizant of. Because going back to your point about protecting gains, right, those are the things, those are the points where you really have to change your mind. So in your mind, what is an inflection point? What sort of drawdown do you have to envision for you to care and not be pulled into, not be flip flopping every single day.
00:17:57.420 - 00:18:23.686, Speaker B: So I think it really depends on the situation that we're in. So I think I'll give you two examples of what I thought were inflection points for this current cycle. I think the first one was the cointelegraph fake announcement of the BTC ETF being approved. And if you recall, BTC was at about 25%, five k. This is when.
00:18:23.758 - 00:18:27.190, Speaker A: Some intern from cointelegraph tweeted that an ETF is approved.
00:18:27.230 - 00:18:27.470, Speaker B: Correct.
00:18:27.510 - 00:18:28.374, Speaker A: But it was not approved.
00:18:28.422 - 00:19:25.320, Speaker B: But it was not approved. And you saw bitcoin, I think, jump was it 10%? And then immediately retrace on that announcement. But it told you very clearly what the market's reaction or the true nature of what the market's reaction would be if that news was true. And so true enough, once the BTCE ETF did get approved, then, you know, that was a very clear sign that the market's ready to go along on a very positive announcement. So, funnily enough, there will be moments or events that you probably don't expect that turn out to be these inflection points. Another example was the latest Trump assassination attempt. I think that was very big shelling point to get everyone to believe that Trump's probability of winning the US elections would shoot up dramatically.
00:19:25.320 - 00:20:21.462, Speaker B: That is still my belief today. And with a Republican at the helm, crypto would stand to be a lot freer from a regulatory point of view. And you could even start entertaining discussions about which country starts including bitcoin as a reserve asset. And these are in terms of the bullish catalysts that you can possibly imagine. This is at the highest order of bullish catalysts for crypto. If the US declares that they're going to start buying even 2% of total supply of bitcoin, this starts a domino effect, because not only the US, now China, now Russia, has to start basically forming their view on crypto as well. So this Trump assassination attempt seems quite removed from markets in general.
00:20:21.462 - 00:20:39.602, Speaker B: But I think, to me, was a huge point on getting us to flip from defensively positioned, which I guess you'll go in later back into an aggressive mode, because we thought that this was enough to galvanize the market. They say, okay, it's time to be written again.
00:20:39.786 - 00:21:11.284, Speaker A: Yeah. And it's not always very scientific. I remember the morning asia time that the assassination attempt was made. I was, I think, yeah, you called me, actually. You woke me up and said, hey, check your phone. And then my entire phone was lit up with notifications of Trump almost being assassinated. And then we were kind of digesting, okay, what are the implications for, you know, first of all for markets, and second of all for how we're positioned? And I think, yeah, this is probably a good point to bring in the defensive positioning that we had.
00:21:11.284 - 00:22:12.546, Speaker A: So, just to give some context, earlier, I think last month, about a month ago, I basically tweeted out that in my one job at Tangent is to, besides finding founders, working with founders on the liquid side is to identify inflection points, which tend to happen once or twice a year. And this is when we flip from a bear to bull, or bull to bear in the definitions we just outlined. And to me, in order to not be looking at prices every single day and be overindexed, my bar is if I think there is a risk that our entire book value can draw down 30% to 40%, not just one position, but an entire book. And I don't know if we can recover immediately, I consider that something that we should protect for, and I think any prudent investor will probably think that that's a, a sound parameter as well. And around mid June, I had very credible reasons to think that the market is going to half in value. And there were four reasons I outlined. Number one was, I think people were over positioned for the ETH ETF.
00:22:12.546 - 00:23:11.402, Speaker A: The entire market was basically running on fumes and sustained on this dream that the ETF would be the thing that creates some sort of sustained perpetual bull market. But in reality, I've shared a lot about how macro investors think about ETH versus bitcoin, and I think the appetite will underwell, at least underperform what people were expecting. Number two was there was incredibly high leverage as well, across all of the centralized exchanges at that time. And then we were tracking on internal sentiment indicators that they were at very peak levels as well, especially for some verticals. And then finally, just some heuristical signs that, for instance, big VC funds being raised. Typically when a large institutional LP's invest in VC funds, it's because they have a validation of the asset class that, hey, this could perform well, because it just performed well, which tends to mean that we're running towards the end of the cycle there. So I kind of made a bold call that, hey, I think we're going to be defensively positioned.
00:23:11.402 - 00:23:34.810, Speaker A: I didn't advocate for anyone to do this. I just said that this is something we do. And immediately I got shat on for like a week nonstop. I got death threats in my DM saying, hey, you are a threat to crypto markets. And a lot of people said very mean things. So I was very sad for about a day, and then subsequently, the entire market drew down 30 40%. If we had been fully positioned, our fund would have halved in value.
00:23:34.810 - 00:24:25.226, Speaker A: So I thought that was probably the right call. But I also did not expect it to happen so fast, because in my mind, I was conditioned by 2022 to think that crypto bear markets are like a year long. You just have a year of gestation, but then that was really just a week. So if you're a venture investors, if you didn't pay attention to any of that, you would have been buying fine. But my kind of justification is that when markets correct 40% and then subsequently double to reclaim levels, that's obviously fine and dandy, but there could be an inflection point where you correct 40%, and then that's it, you don't come back. So as an investor, it's very important that you kind of stay awake. You don't just kind of be asleep at the helm when these drawdowns happen and just expect markets to bail you out, because the one time they don't is the one time you die.
00:24:25.226 - 00:24:33.470, Speaker A: And so that's kind of the context for that kind of bear view. When I presented that view, do you remember what your reaction was, or what did we discuss?
00:24:34.850 - 00:25:04.210, Speaker B: I begrudgingly agreed. The last or the first, on a tangent episode we had, I was the bull. I'm generally bullish by nature. I prefer to be optimistic than pessimistic. That view hasn't changed. Obviously, as a fund, when you present these views, I take them into consideration. I agree with most of the points that you shared.
00:25:04.210 - 00:25:56.724, Speaker B: And even though I think in six to twelve months time, we'll be materially higher than where we are today, that doesn't mean that there can be some all out market fuckery that obviously has happened in the lower timeframes. So I think it was the right call to make. I think if the Trump assassination attempt didn't happen, or if the Democrats were a favorite to win the election, I think you'd see a vastly different market structure. Right now, I'm not sure whether 54k would have helped that double bottom. So everything's always nice and easy to reflect on in hindsight. I think it's in the moment when you make those calls that really matter. And I believe when you came up with your bear view, bitcoin was at.
00:25:56.852 - 00:26:02.542, Speaker A: Initial view was 68. By the time I publicized it, it was 65.
00:26:02.606 - 00:26:35.904, Speaker B: 65, yeah, I remember. And we managed to be pretty defensively positioned during that 65 to 50, 54k drop. And then I'm still bullish. So I was still buying the dip on a certain part of the book that I'm responsible for. And we came out okay. And so we managed to risk on, again, I think, reasonably quickly, especially, you know, at Trump's assassination attempt, which was at 58k for BDC, very lows. Yeah.
00:26:35.904 - 00:26:51.618, Speaker B: So, you know, all in all, that's, even though you're not going to perfectly sell the top, you're not going to perfectly buy the bottom. I think if you can capture the meat of the move through identifying the correct inflection points, you come on. Okay.
00:26:51.794 - 00:27:23.432, Speaker A: Yeah. I think when I first outlined that view as well, my checkpoint was the elections, because it was the single biggest, most consequential event besides the ETF for crypto markets, just because of how partisan the entire crypto issue has become. It didn't used to be like this, but actually, after the FTX event, the Democrats in the United States have taken a line against crypto. So very much so. The Republicans responded by being a pro crypto camp, so it became a partisan issue. So to me, the election outcome means a very binaristic outcome for crypto. Right.
00:27:23.432 - 00:27:55.798, Speaker A: If the Democrats win, you probably have a very horrible outcome for crypto, despite the rhetoric that the Democrats have been trying to spin, which is that, hey, we're really pro crypto now. I ran a poll on x about how many people actually believe the Democrats pro crypto stance is earnest. Almost nobody believed it. And you can see it with the enforcement actions by Gary Gensler from the SEC as well. And then on the other hand, the Republicans have become more and more pro crypto in the rhetoric. I think in a recent speech in Nashville, in the bitcoin conference, Trump mentioned that the first thing he would do as president is fired. Gary Gansner as well.
00:27:55.854 - 00:27:56.270, Speaker B: Bullish.
00:27:56.350 - 00:28:36.176, Speaker A: And the entire crowd just erupted. And I think he was blown away by just how much crypto people hated the toxic and unclear regulation environment that Gary Genster has set for crypto. With that backdrop in mind, my thinking was that, okay, there's probably no clarity to where the markets would go until the elections happen. Then we would actually dictate what the regime is, which means that from now until then is a closed system. And within that closed system, I think we've ran out of marginal buyers at that point. So I think that was a very kind of clear thesis in my mind. So when the assassination happened, in my mind, at least in your minds at first, and you convinced me afterwards the odds for Trump winning basically went up dramatically.
00:28:36.176 - 00:29:29.958, Speaker A: So what happened was instead of having your checkpoint in November, because the odds of that event has improved, you pull the checkpoint forward right now. So the market's got to start pricing in the November outcome, but today, so we basically get to invalidate the bear market thesis within three weeks of us setting it. And there was no way we could have predicted that there's an assassination attempt. So that's what we mean by kind of constantly adapting and interpreting information. Before I get started, I'm grateful for Aptos for sponsoring the show and letting us continue to make this free content for all of so here's Jerome from Aptos to tell us a little bit more. Jerome Aptos is gaining traction of entities interested in bridging traditional finance with DeFi. Some notable developments are Ondo Finance's integration of Aptos, which brings institutional grade finance on chain and ecosystem project Aptos Labs becoming a strategic investor in securitize, which is an RWA platform offering tokenized fund investments.
00:29:29.958 - 00:29:35.790, Speaker A: So can you explain why Aptos is such an attractive network for onboarding web two financial markets and services?
00:29:35.910 - 00:30:33.644, Speaker C: So FDAs is the world's fastest, most reliable interoperable layer one blockchain, making it the fastest, most accessible payment reel in the world for quick context. Visa processes 1600 transactions per second. Applaud supports 30,000 transactions per second. That's 18 times faster than Visa and feels instantaneous to users. For this reason, Apple's isn't just a blockchain fit to bring rwas on chain. It is the blockchain for bridging the trapfire defighten. In addition to Ondo and securitized developments, Aptos Labs, in collaboration with Revan Howard, BCG, Eski Telecom and Microsoft, announced Aptos Ascend, a suite of blockchain based tools and features on the Aptos blockchain designed to meet the requirements of financial institutions while at the same time leveraging the openness, scalability, security, speed and reliability of the public Aptos network Aptos Ascend will provide a web3 path for any major bank or financial institution in the world to begin offering digital asset and asset management services to the clients responsibility and their skill.
00:30:33.644 - 00:30:56.096, Speaker C: It represents a massive step forward in bridging the gap between Tradfi and Defi innovation with the industry's key stakeholders. This opportunity to bridge the institutional web3 gap in the name of open finance is huge, is global and is playing out at thanks to the speed with our low time to finality our reliability, 99.99% uptime and cost efficiency, with 100 times lower guest fees than other prominent l ones.
00:30:56.188 - 00:31:25.522, Speaker A: Thanks, Jerome. Now back to the episode. And what I get from Twitter, at least from a lot of kind of commentary, is that it seems like the ability to change bias quickly and nimbly is very, very. Is not too far removed from flip flopping too much as an investor and not having conviction. So when you think about, okay, how do I maintain conviction and make sure I compound in the bets that I like versus how do I not flip flop too much? How do you balance that as an investor?
00:31:25.626 - 00:32:21.174, Speaker B: Oh, there's no easy answer for that. I think over time, you learn when I guess it's very difficult right now, I'd say it comes down to instinct after looking at charts, looking at news events, trying to gauge emotion or sentiment in the market. But I just want to come back to your point about the Trump assassination attempt. When you talk about real time interpretation of data, I think there's no better example than that event, because even the day after the assassination attempt, bitcoin didn't move. Bitcoin was at 59 to. We were wondering in our heads, did we price this wrongly? Are we wrong that this is a material event for the market? And we weren't wrong, at least not yet. And the market was just very slow to respond.
00:32:21.174 - 00:33:04.758, Speaker B: People didn't understand how to reflect or how to interpret this into their stances. And it took days, basically, for bitcoin to reclaim 60 and then move to 63. And then after, I think by the time it moved to 63, there was basically no time to position between 60 to 63k. You had, like, two days of bitcoin price not doing anything. And then all of a sudden, the market was like, okay, the assassination attempt was something, but you had those two days to basically position, and that's where the market gives you gifts, and it rewards the people who interpret and analyze events the fastest and obviously correctly.
00:33:04.934 - 00:33:07.142, Speaker A: Where did Sol go to that day?
00:33:07.326 - 00:33:08.126, Speaker B: I can't remember.
00:33:08.198 - 00:33:09.694, Speaker A: Actually, it's like 140.
00:33:09.782 - 00:33:13.662, Speaker B: I remember we were longing it at about 140.
00:33:13.766 - 00:33:31.974, Speaker A: Yes, today it's 190. Yes, I know, because it's 69. So I think our call was correct. But it's always easier in hindsight. Right? At the day, I think that morning you called me, hey, I think this is the inflection point to your inflection point. And I'm like, come on, Darryl, I just had this thesis. Please let me sleep with this bear thesis for a few more weeks.
00:33:31.974 - 00:33:55.354, Speaker A: Let me have my victory lapse. But no, we have to flip bullish. I think it's interesting because I think on a high timeframe I'm the more bullish person. I'm a very bullish person on a 1020 year horizon, but I'm constantly a very cynical person. Like one week to four weeks, can't help it. But speaking of one week to four weeks. So it's been a few weeks, I believe, since the ETF started trading.
00:33:55.354 - 00:34:02.750, Speaker A: So far, actually. One week so far. So far. Is it kind of meeting your expectations of how it would go or anything surprising to you?
00:34:03.420 - 00:34:17.684, Speaker B: I think the pace of the grayscale outflows are surprising. I think right now it's far more aggressive than the bitcoin one. I think people generally learned their game, learned what was going to happen. Basically everyone just trying to rush out of the gates.
00:34:17.852 - 00:34:22.516, Speaker A: Can you explain to elicitors who not familiar with the grayscale stuff what exactly is happening there?
00:34:22.628 - 00:35:27.260, Speaker B: So basically, a lot of people were longing grayscale, the Grayscale Trust in order to arbitrage the difference in price between Grayscale's ethereum and the actual Ethereum price. And they basically unwind that trade when the ETH ETF goes live. So basically, once the ETH ETF launched, you had a ton of grayscale outflows, because basically everybody was like, all right, the trade is done. We need to unwind. And so you're seeing a lot of outflows come out of that trust. A part of it is being absorbed by the new buyers stepping in from the blackrocks, the bitwisers, etcetera. But the general outflow is still very, very strong, which is why you are seeing ETH price coming down quite a bit, despite it already being pretty weak going into the launch, a lot of people were running analysis on how, you know, the similarities and differences between how bitcoin and Eve would trade according to their own ETF launches.
00:35:27.260 - 00:36:22.070, Speaker B: And basically most of the bears for the ETF have won so far. But I am, we have no position right now on either asset. But if I were to guess, the ETH eT ETH would probably bottom in the next week or so as of today because of the accelerated grayscale outflows that we're seeing right now. So I think the ETF net net is still a very, very bullish instrument for the asset. And you're already seeing the ETH A, which is Blackrock's ethereum etfeminal. You're already seeing these guys start picking it up, maybe not in the amounts that would surprise anyone. But these are long term buyers.
00:36:22.070 - 00:37:00.576, Speaker B: You're seeing how these are. I think for the ibit buyers, which is Blackrock's bitcoin ETF, these guys are basically buying every dip. So I'd much rather the traditional institutions be buying and holding our assets versus the speculators that are trying to close the arbitrage premium. Right. So overall, long term, this is very healthy developments for the space. And yeah, maybe there's an ETH trade somewhere down the road, but at this point, trying to trade ETH or trying to trade ETH BTC is truly torture. Torture.
00:37:00.576 - 00:37:04.080, Speaker B: And so you typically stay away from it.
00:37:04.200 - 00:37:30.364, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. But I think if we zoom out a bit, right, this is going back to my ten year bullish personality. I think this is insane to think about. When I first got into space in 2018, all of this was just a little Internet niche with some cypherpunks and some Twitter talking heads. To think that will become a mainstream financial instrument accessible to my parents on their brokerage app, it's actually insane. For bitcoin. It wasn't as insane because people were kind of expecting it.
00:37:30.364 - 00:38:20.470, Speaker A: I really didn't expect the e thing to happen this cycle back in the beginning of 2023. I am incredibly excited that this is happening. I think the implications for crypto as an asset class are still unknown because some people are saying that now that retails and institutions are participating amass, it could get rid of a lot of the cyclicality of crypto, where people are used to four year cycles around halving for bitcoin, maybe with this kind of underlying undercurrent of inflows from bitcoin and ETH ETF's, that might not happen anymore, or we just have dampened cycles. So something that we have to think about going back to the point about inflection points as well, will bear market still look the same or bull market still look the same? I guess, before we hop onto specific verticals, is that something you've thought about as well? Would the future bear markets look similar to what we had in 2022 and 2018?
00:38:20.810 - 00:39:02.240, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think they're already changing this cycle. For example, I keep saying these are cycles within cycles. So you've got alt cycles that, you know, look entirely different from bitcoin or from ETH, for example, even though they're technically supposed to be levered beta or correlated. But it's really not the case. And you're just seeing the difference between one asset getting latent bids and latent inflows and another asset getting reverse latent outflows, which is via new tokens being unlocked. And the inflation that happens for a lot of these new tokens that are very, very high.
00:39:02.570 - 00:39:06.498, Speaker A: Talking about the high FTV coins, yes.
00:39:06.554 - 00:40:07.432, Speaker B: Not only that, but I think a lot of coins also have natural inflation levels that are much higher than bitcoin or ETH. And so you're really seeing these undercurrents work in opposite ways, and you're seeing the dispersion in returns as a function of that. So I think going forward, you're definitely going to see more muted volatility with any asset that has an ETF. I would say that that's a good thing, because this muted volatility allows for larger positions to be taken. Most of the time. The things, the reasons why people are not or tradfi is not buying bitcoin or ETH is mainly because they can't stomach the volatility of this asset class, and it's also very illiquid. So I think the liquidity and the volatility are both going in directions that allow people to allow institutions to basically slowly accumulate our assets and normalize accumulating assets.
00:40:07.432 - 00:41:22.992, Speaker B: I think people have often said that this is the last cycle for crypto, and I generally agree with that statement in the sense where this is probably the last cycle, you're going to get really super normal returns. Already you're seeing returns versus 2020 or 2017 pale in comparison. I still think you're going to get returns to outperform equities by a huge margin in crypto, but this is probably the last time, because after this fast forward three to five years, you have five to ten crypto. ETF's out there for the largest assets. You have bitcoin at $5 trillion, for example, in terms of market cap. And basically, crypto is just a fully mature individual asset class that trapfire institutions can allocate to. And at that time, you sort of think of crypto as like levered beta on equities, but levered beta in terms of maybe it's just a bit more risky versus equities instead of right now, this is basically the wild, Wild west, and you can make 100 x.
00:41:22.992 - 00:41:26.256, Speaker B: People won't be having those notions, I think, in five years time.
00:41:26.368 - 00:41:34.900, Speaker A: So on a risk adjusted basis, it might not be as clear cut as a good bet as it was back in 2020.
00:41:35.240 - 00:42:06.460, Speaker B: Well, I wouldn't say on a risk adjusted basis. On a return basis, it's going to be significantly more muted. But the risk side as well, I think it's going to be quite a bit more. When it's more socially accepted and normalized to buy, chances are you're likely not going to see bitcoin drop 50% in one day. That March 2020 incident of bitcoin going from six k to three k. Chances are those days are behind us because.
00:42:06.500 - 00:42:14.692, Speaker A: That was very specific in that there was a lot of recursive leverage as well. Bitcoin longs collateralized by bitcoin longs.
00:42:14.756 - 00:42:24.100, Speaker B: It's just a function of a nascent industry with not enough liquidity, not enough market makers in the space. Just happening.
00:42:24.180 - 00:42:27.556, Speaker A: Now that we've learned those lessons, I hope that doesn't happen again.
00:42:27.628 - 00:42:28.012, Speaker B: I hope.
00:42:28.076 - 00:42:53.216, Speaker A: But I think this is a good note to pivot to talk about specific verticals as well. So we debated. Okay, should we talk about specific names? I don't think we're here to give recommendations. We're never here to give financial advice. We're only here to share our views. So maybe we keep it broader strokes in terms of what verticals we're looking at and deployed into. So I do want to talk about AI for a bit, but before that, let's touch on a more lighthearted one, which is this idea of culture coins.
00:42:53.216 - 00:42:59.296, Speaker A: So you are the first person to flag this term to be. I don't know what culture coins are. What exactly are culture coins?
00:42:59.368 - 00:43:33.460, Speaker B: So, culture coins. So, well, firstly, they are a subcategory of meme coins. So as most of the audience is aware, AI and meme coins are the two most popular verticals for this cycle. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. So culture coins are basically this new subcategory of meme coins that aren't tied to a specific animal. I think if you notice, almost every meme coin we have is tied to either a dog, a cat, a frog.
00:43:33.540 - 00:43:34.172, Speaker A: That's true.
00:43:34.276 - 00:43:50.788, Speaker B: Or some variation of that. And culture coins are basically concepts or phenomenons that happen, that people, like, people want to identify with.
00:43:50.884 - 00:43:53.342, Speaker A: It's like an NFT almost, to an.
00:43:53.366 - 00:43:55.270, Speaker B: Extent, yes, but more liquid.
00:43:55.310 - 00:44:05.302, Speaker A: It's similar to what people said about nfts, right? At first, NFT were just cute pictures of cats, like with cryptokitties and so on. And then nfts became, hey, a badge of honor. I'm part of this community.
00:44:05.446 - 00:44:05.742, Speaker B: Correct?
00:44:05.766 - 00:44:24.658, Speaker A: And then over time, I think some nfts are even associated with certain types of thinking. Or like. So, for instance, if I say edgy, kind of pseudo intellectual, pretentious, I hold one of these. So I think I'm entitled to criticize it this way. What do you think of. It's milady's if you want to be like an edge lord. It's like, you hold milady's if you want to be like, hey, I'm cool.
00:44:24.658 - 00:44:36.474, Speaker A: I'm social. Maybe you hold a board apes. Maybe not anymore. I'm quite out of touch with this, but it seems like there might be a similar concept here is what you're saying.
00:44:36.522 - 00:44:59.038, Speaker B: I think so. But it's definitely not consensus yet. Because you're not really seeing anyone really talk about this, and you're not really seeing that many other contenders besides monk, I think. I can't remember. I think there were a couple like lock in, which was never even heard of that. Basically, you know, you know, the. What was his name?
00:44:59.094 - 00:45:01.734, Speaker A: I know the phrase locked in. I said, like, we gotta lock in.
00:45:01.902 - 00:45:02.462, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:02.566 - 00:45:03.982, Speaker A: So there's a coin called lock in.
00:45:04.086 - 00:45:17.436, Speaker B: Yeah, lock in. And it's popularized by who's. What was the guy's. The name escapes me. It was the guy that there was. The movie was made about him. Dumb money.
00:45:17.548 - 00:45:19.444, Speaker A: Oh, roaring kitty.
00:45:19.492 - 00:45:20.908, Speaker B: Roaring kitty. Oh, my God. How did I forget that?
00:45:20.924 - 00:45:23.076, Speaker A: Okay, so he made a coin called lock in.
00:45:23.148 - 00:45:31.996, Speaker B: No. So he posted the picture, remember when he came back of him selling. And that was basically people saying he's locked in.
00:45:32.148 - 00:45:33.364, Speaker A: Oh, when people create locked in.
00:45:33.372 - 00:45:59.822, Speaker B: And then people created that coin. And it's similar to mog in a sense that you're identifying with a certain action of phenomenon of being focused, being locked in. But this is obviously something that's far smaller. You know, it's probably going to go to zero. So. But this is another example. Basically something like a culture coin being created.
00:45:59.822 - 00:46:05.638, Speaker B: But, you know, for every one of these things that's being created, there are like a thousand new animal coins that.
00:46:05.654 - 00:46:23.054, Speaker A: Have been created with pump fun. I think there's 6600 thousand coins being created. But we do have a small position at mock. I mean, this is not a big part of the book. Just to clarify, out there, we're picking interesting things that are contrarian and not talked about. Like, otherwise we can talk about Sol for all days. But we just like to talk about interesting things.
00:46:23.054 - 00:47:13.582, Speaker A: And just in the interest of time, I also want to talk about crypto AI, because this is something that obviously is, I think, the most unsolved game and the most interesting one in crypto in the sense that DeFi is a very soft game. Right. If you talk about, hey, what are the trade offs between an AMM and an RFQ model for this entrance exchange? Most people in crypto will understand. Most people understand that there are different type of risks that you take on if you borrow from Aave versus from maple finance. And most people understand how to value these tokens based on the revenues and fees earned. So it's a very solved game for AI. I think it's unsolved, not just in the mechanistic level, not just in terms of, is this model of crypto AI better than this model, but at the kind of scoping level we don't even know what are the problems to solve for in crypto AI? Maybe it's just a solution looking for a problem.
00:47:13.582 - 00:47:57.284, Speaker A: So, to me, I've kind of thought about this a lot in terms of what are the big areas we should look into as a fund. So, first of all, there is the GPU infrastructure level. So there's a lot of Airbnb for GPU coins out there. There's things like Akash or things like render ionet, and so on. But to me, that is still an unsolved issue, even with the revenues for some of these networks picking up. I was watching an interview with Coreweave, which is one of the bigger web two cloud GPU providers. The core Weave CEO was basically saying, actually, for optimal performance for training and inference of AI models, you need to wire these gpu's exactly the same way and co locate them for efficiency gains, which defeats the purpose of decentralized networks.
00:47:57.284 - 00:48:18.300, Speaker A: So does that mean we, we don't need decentralized GPU networks, or do we just want decentralized clusters of centralized databases? That's an unsolved question for me. And then number two is data collection. But if you use chat GBT today, you can ask it historically, you know, ask any historical question. It can. It can already instant, instantaneous answer you. But what if you want to ask something more real time?
00:48:18.340 - 00:48:18.612, Speaker B: Right?
00:48:18.676 - 00:49:08.250, Speaker A: I want to know what is the sentiment on X about Trump today? So it then needs to scrape data from Twitter. So the privacy, the copyright laws simply do not catch up in real time for real time scraping. So is there a way for us to scrape data and ascribe provenance in a privacy preserving way, using serial knowledge proofs in crypto? Maybe also unsure. And then just to go over a few more verticals that I've thought about verification. So right now, if I ask a chat GPT or mid journey, generate me an image of Daryl in a bikini. Sorry to put that image in your minds, but how can I make sure that this bot is generating it using the mid journey algorithm? And not just some random garage band algorithm someone ran on their phones. So this is where the point about verification comes in.
00:49:08.250 - 00:49:46.932, Speaker A: Can we use the same mechanisms that people use to verify L2 transactions but for AI? But then I. The big question there is, there are a few projects doing this already, right? AI provenance and verification. But the question is, AI is non deterministic, meaning if you run the same model but on two gpu's with the same input, one's going to give you daryl in a blue bikini, the other is going to give you daryl in a yellow bikini. But it's the same algorithm. So can we kind of apply verification to non deterministic things? That's also an unsolved question. And then there's two more, just agents. A lot of people talk about agentic protocols.
00:49:46.932 - 00:50:50.046, Speaker A: I think so far, the only concrete use case I've seen for AI agents is I tell this bot, hey, I want to maximize yield on deFi, and then this bot just goes and find the best yields. But is that an overkill? Do you need bots for that? Is that the only use case? And then finally, incentivization of models. This is something like bittensor, which we do have a kind of position in. So the, I think the big kind of question for me is recently meta just released llama three, which is the biggest large language model to date. And these guys spend hundreds of millions of dollars into developing this thing, and then they just release it for free. So if these big companies are already doing this for free, why do we need to create a network to incentivize development of AI? Is it an ideological reason? Because we don't want just the big companies developing this? Or is there an economic reason that makes development of AI models better in a decentralized, incentivized network setting? So all of these questions are unanswered at the highest level. It's not even like, okay, we know this is what we're going to solve.
00:50:50.046 - 00:51:05.240, Speaker A: Is this the best way to do it? It's like, do we even need to solve this? So that, to me, is the scariest, but also the most exciting, just because of how unsolved it is. I know you're also quite excited about the AI vertical. What kind of caught your attention about it at first?
00:51:05.820 - 00:52:40.552, Speaker B: I think coming back to you saying, talking about unsolved games in general, I tend to view things from a more opportunistic lens, I guess, in terms of the different verticals, apart from what philosophically excites me, the question I ask is how much money can I make from this? To put it simply, the more unsolved we've talked about this before, the more unsolved a game is, the more opportunity for supernormal profit. And I think there is, again, no better vertical in crypto today than AI or crypto AI that allows for those kind of opportunities to present themselves. And if you talk about crypto AI today, I really think we're only just in the first inning of discovering what is possible, what is not possible, what is economically feasible, and what is not. And throughout the experiments that I hope we see in this space, we will find potentially the next axis of our cycle, but in the form of an AI protocol that could or could not be working in one of the different categories that you mentioned. But we're keeping our eyes peeled there, because if I don't know what to allocate to, I will eventually come back to what excites me the most. What is the most uncertain one is most unsolved. And so I think AI ticks all boxes here.
00:52:40.552 - 00:52:53.958, Speaker B: And that's why us, as a fund, we've allocated a decent amount of our liquid holdings to this particular vertical. And we'll see where it goes.
00:52:54.094 - 00:53:30.024, Speaker A: And the reason we've chosen to do this, on the liquid side, we have one on the. Actually, we have two on the venture side that we did a long time ago. But the reason we did this on the liquid side is just because of how uncertain this game is that it allows us the flexibility to re underwrite. If there are fundamentally better models to launch, we can simply change our convection and switch to another beta. But I think in the interest of time, we should talk about some of the Twitter questions that people have. So I'll just pick one or two from here just to wrap us up. So, first of all, someone asked us, how can someone with a small book replicate the tangent model? So we don't want to give financial advice.
00:53:30.024 - 00:53:40.540, Speaker A: This is clearly tailored financial advice. So instead of talking about that, we're going to share what we did at the beginnings of our careers to kind of do this. So what did you do at the beginning?
00:53:41.030 - 00:54:17.194, Speaker B: I think the first thing, I was pretty active on Twitter. I think that was the first big change in my life or how I behaved as an individual. Because prior to Twitter, I was actually a very private person. I wouldn't post on Instagram much, Facebook much, no podcasts. No podcasts, definitely. And just generally a very private person. Twitter was the first time I actually dared to go out of my comfort zone, put out content for people to see really for nothing in return.
00:54:17.194 - 00:54:57.940, Speaker B: I'm just putting out content that I think can help people. And so generally you gain more followers, you slowly build your brand, and that's how I started chatting with you for a bit. And yeah, I think that is really one of the most important things. The fact that I was also working in a crypto hedge fund also obviously didn't hurt. That also opened a number of doors. But I think it's really focusing on the CT profile. I think at the time when nobody else was really doing it all that much really helped me accelerate my career.
00:54:58.840 - 00:55:41.062, Speaker A: I guess from my side, if I focus on the portfolio side of things a bit, I didn't do any angel investing. Even though I'm mostly known as an angel investor, I love to look at the venture stuff, the thesis driven stuff. I didn't do any angel investing for the first two, three years of my career. I only focused on liquid investing. And I only got my first angel investing after, I think 200 hours or so of doing the podcast, putting up free content every week. And then even then, when I first got my invite for an angel round, I got kicked out at the last minute. So I think my advice to people is don't be too eager to start and don't think that you're entitled to any opportunities to start investing.
00:55:41.062 - 00:56:10.170, Speaker A: I mean, kind of do the legwork first, do the homework, put your content out, know what you're talking about, build your networks, and then it could be years before you write your first check. And that's totally fine, I think. Let's talk about the last question, just in the interest of time. How do you handle diversification versus concentration of bets, given that tangent has liquid and illiquid portfolio spread across different segments? You talk about how we think about venture versus liquid.
00:56:10.830 - 00:56:51.762, Speaker B: So I think in general, the majority of our capital is still allocated towards the liquid side of things. Within the liquid bucket, we have the flexibility to be extremely concentrated or extremely diverse where we want to. I think right now, as a function of liquidity constraints, we can't really all in one particular bet any longer. It's financially irresponsible to do so. And so we try and think of percentages of our book that we want allocated to certain verticals. And so, for example, hypothetically, let's say we're very bullish. Sorry.
00:56:51.762 - 00:57:38.172, Speaker B: We could split our portfolio to be 20% defi, 30% memes, 30% AI, and 20% smattering of other stuff. That could be one way to structure things. And then depending on your conviction on certain verticals, you could upvote or downvote the weighting of that as well. Typically, we haven't actually been, I would say, very, very aggressive in making plays. I would say that the biggest play that we made, I believe, was 50% of the book, but it was split across three to four different tokens. And this was on if I'm. This is way back in early 2023, where we were trying to play the arbitrum token launch.
00:57:38.172 - 00:57:51.550, Speaker B: And we're trying to long a couple of different things. So I remember we were long. Magic, we were long. Optimism. We were long. What else were we long? I forget as well. But it was like three or four different coins.
00:57:51.550 - 00:58:15.670, Speaker B: Yeah, it was three or four different coins. And that comprised 50% of the book. And that's how we decided to target specific plays in terms of concentration, but generally on a net neutral basis. When we don't have these high conviction plays, the portfolio would comprise of not more than, I guess, 15 positions and no less than five positions, I would say.
00:58:16.450 - 00:59:01.942, Speaker A: And I think on the longer term as well, if I think about the ten year vision of tangent as well, some diversification we also do by exploring verticals outside of crypto or adjacent the crypto that could benefit from crypto. So one bet that we've made recently is in a fund called retron. So retron is run by a biophysics PhD in Berkeley called Ronnie, and it's basically a fund that focuses on intersection between computation and biology. So think about gene sequencing, gene editing, cancer research. So the one thing that I really like about this fund is Ron used to be full time in crypto, working at a L2. So he is very, very kind of crypto aware, crypto knowledgeable. So if there's one guy that can combine biophysics and crypto, it's probably him.
00:59:01.942 - 00:59:32.312, Speaker A: So it's the bets like this that we also make to kind of diversify outside of crypto over the long term. Now, with that being said, I think that's all the time that we have for this episode. Hopefully you guys enjoyed this as well.
