00:00:00.080 - 00:00:28.388, Speaker A: I don't like compound hadn't launched. Like, Uniswap hadn't launched. So that was an actually, like, scary bear market versus now it's like, okay, yes, like, volumes are down a lot, but these NFT communities, they still persist. You know, people are still rocking their pfps. They're very emotionally attached to them. So NFTs as a phenomenon, like, they haven't, like, died out at all. It's just that we've gone down and the hype cycle and in terms of, you know, how do things come back? I think ultimately in crypto, you know, this is a cyclical market.
00:00:28.388 - 00:00:40.124, Speaker A: It's like very obviously a cyclical market. There's been so many, you know, bull and bear runs and every bull run. It's hard to ever predict, like, what's the thing that's going to set it off. You know, no one really saw uniswap coming.
