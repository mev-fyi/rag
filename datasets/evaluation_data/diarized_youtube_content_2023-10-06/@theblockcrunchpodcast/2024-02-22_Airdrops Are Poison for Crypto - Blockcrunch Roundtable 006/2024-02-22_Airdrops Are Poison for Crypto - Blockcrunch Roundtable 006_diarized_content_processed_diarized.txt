00:00:00.280 - 00:00:09.014, Speaker A: We're also reaching a stage where I think applications could benefit more from thinking about their tokens as programmable equity web3 offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:09.054 - 00:00:10.846, Speaker B: Our job is to buy great tech at great prices.
00:00:10.910 - 00:00:12.934, Speaker A: AI is also libertarian right?
00:00:12.974 - 00:00:15.230, Speaker B: Enable a use case that people haven't been able to do today.
00:00:15.302 - 00:00:18.910, Speaker A: The next hundreds of millions of players, they will come to the market through mobile.
00:00:18.982 - 00:00:53.032, Speaker B: My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next twelve months is. Hey everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockchain podcast. I'm back here this week with my host Sanad from Dragonfly Capital, and myself, Jason Choi. I'm the founder of Tangent, and before we get started, just a disclaimer. Nothing we discuss is considered to be financial advice, and our opinions do not reflect that of our respective companies. And today we are here to discuss something pretty spicy.
00:00:53.032 - 00:01:51.014, Speaker B: I was surprised this was even a spicy thing, Sanat, because when I tweeted about airdrops and how a lot of airdrop farmers are parasitic to crypto, I got a lot of hate mail and I think that tweet got like 120,000 views in like a day. And mostly it's from airdrop farmers, obviously reaching out and saying that I'm stupid and I should die. So I thought we should actually have a nuanced discussion about airdrops, whether they are actually an effective tool for go to market and retention and other important things for building companies for founders out there. And if founders do go after airdrops, what are the lessons they can learn from campaigns that have been done successfully or unsuccessfully? What are some of the metrics they can toggle? And also, we should talk about the new meta, that is points, which has also been very divisive for some reason. So I'm quite excited about this. But before that, have you done any airdrops? Have you gotten any airdrops recently? What about the Jupiter airdrop?
00:01:52.154 - 00:02:11.370, Speaker A: I did not get the Jupiter airdrop. I think the latest one I'm eligible for is Dimensions Airdrop, which I got by virtue of having some bad kids. And at least if Avo's pre trading Jupiter, sorry, dimension prices are to be believed, it's going to pay for the nfts at least. So it turned out to be a good trade.
00:02:11.402 - 00:02:17.404, Speaker B: I suppose the bad kids is the cosmos NFT, right? The 9900 bad drawings.
00:02:17.784 - 00:02:35.368, Speaker A: Yes. Weirdly enough, I feel like people don't recognize them as nfts, but now you see them a lot more as cosmos. People are becoming more prevalent in Twitter discourse. Yeah, they, when I bought it. It was, like, $300. I have no idea what it trades for anymore. You have to go to stargaze and check.
00:02:35.368 - 00:02:37.724, Speaker A: But I imagine it went up to.
00:02:39.444 - 00:02:46.084, Speaker B: Did you. Did you expect them to do an airdrop for, like, bad kids, or were you just, like, surprised by it?
00:02:46.244 - 00:03:06.394, Speaker A: No, honestly, I bought a bad kids because I was determined to try out Skip's new IBC fun product that lets you kind of move money across cosmos chain super easily. And I thought it looked kind of cool, but I'd never expected to make money from a bad kids. If I'm being honest, I don't expect to make money in cosmos usually.
00:03:06.514 - 00:03:28.290, Speaker B: I think that's, like, the best type of airdrops. It's like airdrops you don't expect, and suddenly you're surprised by it. I mean, that's, like, the first high profile airdrops. Let's dive into the history of airdrops here, actually, before we dive into the meat of things. So I think the first high profile airdrops out there was probably the Uniswap one. So this happened. For those of you who are watching this on YouTube, we're pulling up a dune article on it, which you can look up as well.
00:03:28.290 - 00:03:54.410, Speaker B: It's a great article on what happened with the Uniswap airdrop. They basically did this in September 2020, and they decided to drop, I think, 400 uni tokens to everyone who's ever used uni on any wallet. So, basically, most people in crypto who used anything on chain at that point probably qualified. And at that point, uni, I think, was trading at around six to $8. So similar to what it's trading at today. So that was, like, a $2400 airdrop. Just surprise.
00:03:54.410 - 00:04:14.714, Speaker B: Airdrop. Nobody expected it. I don't think there was any leakage, at least not in my circles. So it was generally, like, a sign of goodwill, and I think that created some sort of wealth effect within crypto as well. So that was kind of the first high profile airdrop. I don't know if you remember any other kind of high profile examples or prominent examples of airdrops.
00:04:15.214 - 00:04:31.234, Speaker A: I mean, the uniswap airdrop was really crazy. I got it on four addresses, and I remember just waking up and being like, wow, I'm thousands of dollars of rich, and how did this happen? What is this industry? And in a weird way, it was probably, like, subconsciously, honestly, drove me to become a professional crypto investor.
00:04:31.354 - 00:04:32.978, Speaker B: Oh, that was before you went full time?
00:04:33.106 - 00:04:33.914, Speaker A: Yes, yes.
00:04:33.994 - 00:04:34.914, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:04:35.074 - 00:04:52.134, Speaker A: I was just playing around so that was super cool. I can't remember the most high profile ones. I think dy DX was really big. I remember dy DX. I didn't get it, but it was a six figure airdrop, and everyone was just like, whoa. And then also the US users didn't get it, so they were super angry.
00:04:52.614 - 00:05:13.502, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah. I think that's also another thing we discussed in terms of whether points are a way for founders to kind of get over regulatory hurdles. But, yeah, I think if we think about the earlier examples of airdrops, it's always pretty positive. You're always kind of surprised. Wow. I was just using this thing because I wanted to use it.
00:05:13.502 - 00:05:47.530, Speaker B: I didn't expect to be paid, but I think sometime between the Uniswap airdrop and now, the expectations have kind of changed. People are using protocols because they think there will be an airdrop. And sometimes founders tease that there could be an airdrop as well. So that has led to quite a lot of parasitic behavior, which I talked about in this tweet. So let's set the context for this episode, which is this tweet that I put out. I basically talked about airdrops going from rewarding early users during the uniswap days to becoming a magnet for leeches. And people got very offended by the fact that I call them leeches.
00:05:47.530 - 00:06:14.970, Speaker B: So to clarify, I'm not calling airdrop farmers leeches. All of us are airdrop farmers. We all like airdrops. I'm talking about people who bully founders on social media and forums because they are not getting tokens as quickly as they thought, or they got less than what they thought that they thought they were entitled to. That I think are just absolute leeches and they distract founders. And founders should just completely ignore these people. And whenever you call these people out on Twitter, they're also the loudest and the most toxic.
00:06:14.970 - 00:07:05.974, Speaker B: So I got quite a lot of hate mail here. So my point was that actually this new meta around points is almost a revenge plot from founders to turn the table around. So instead of having airdrop farmers trying to suck the life out of these projects, founders are now basically taking advantage of the leeches in order to pump up some metrics. So I want to take a step back with today's episode. I want to discuss from an objective perspective for setting aside my personal biases and your personal biases, whether airdrops are actually a good way for retailers to make money, whether it's a good way for founders to actually grow their projects and whether it's a financially sound business decision to even make. So I'm curious, like, first of all, were you surprised that people are so pissed when I call out airdrop farmers?
00:07:07.434 - 00:07:32.084, Speaker A: I mean, I wasn't super surprised. Airdrop farmers are all over crypto Twitter, and they're usually angry people. There have been so many airdrops. Paraswap is another notable example where I remember there were all these people who were just like, hey, I tried so hard to sibil your protocol and you didn't give me enough money. This is like screaming this exact thought away on Twitter. So I wasn't actually surprised. Airdrop farmers are angry people.
00:07:32.084 - 00:07:47.464, Speaker A: If you look at the, like, if you look at the replies to founders, tweets and crypto, there's always someone angry. They didn't get enough of an airdrop. They want more of an airdrop. They haven't got the airdrop yet. Airdrop farmers are angry people.
00:07:47.924 - 00:08:30.700, Speaker B: No, I agree, man. I feel like a lot of this entitlement comes from the perception that airdrops open up the opportunity field to the everyday man, to the everyday Joe that VC's have access to, but they don't. So the perception is that while I can now have early access to protocols like Uniswap and Paraswap, just like the VC's did, instead of just being dumped on VC's, I think that that's kind of the narrative that's being perpetuated on social media. I think that's wrong in many, many ways, but I kind of get it right. It's kind of like a stick it to the man mentality. It's this kind of narrative around retails versus VC's, David versus Goliath. People love, you know, talking about that narrative, but I think that the two rebuttals I would have to that to the angry people out there is number one, actually, VC still have asymmetric info.
00:08:30.700 - 00:09:07.190, Speaker B: It's not like Airdrop is the great equalizer. If you guys remember, I think back in 2021, there was a VC firm that shut down because they were found to be sibling their own protocol at their own portfolio company to get that airdrop. And because they were able to do that because they knew from the portfolio founder directly that there was going to be an airdrop. So it's still very much an insider's game. I don't think airdrops do anything to level the playing field in that regard. We can talk about token distribution, decentralization, liquidity later on. I think those are effective things for Airdrop campaign to go for.
00:09:07.190 - 00:09:17.728, Speaker B: But in terms of airdrops completely leveling the playing field between VC's and retails, I think that's just, that's just insane. I think the actual thing that leveled the playing field was icos, but they were outlawed.
00:09:17.846 - 00:10:00.514, Speaker A: Instead of leveling the playing field. This is me totally putting my tinfoil hat on. They actually totally unlevel the playing field because we actually have no idea. The divergence ribbon example is interesting because it was found out because these people had bad OpSeC. But every single airdrop criteria is obviously known to a whole bunch of insiders inside the team. And we really have no way of knowing what percentage of airdrops are farmed by like team members insiders funds. And consequently, sometimes I think that maybe airdrops are actually just primarily a way for insiders to make a lot of money without anybody finding out.
00:10:01.374 - 00:10:48.638, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's possible. I think to ribbon's merit. So for those of you watching on video, we're pulling up the article about the divergence, which is the VC fund that Sibyl Ribbon Finance, which is the protocol that gave the airdrop to the merit. Julian, the founder basically said that we actually did not disclose the criteria, the cutoff date, the amount to our investors. We basically just told our investors that we're launching a token that we're going to do an airdrop for distribution, which I suppose are kind of info enough for VC's to take advantage of. But I think you're right, it does not level the playing field in any material way, in my opinion. And I think the point too is a lot of people also seem to make the point that airdrops are basically a way to pass money from VC's and founders to retails.
00:10:48.638 - 00:11:33.170, Speaker B: So it's a good way for retailers to kind of benefit from some of the money that VC's have magically made over the past years. But if you really think about it, the tokens that are used for airdrops are minted out of thin air. It's not like they're giving out their equity. It's not like they took out a loan to pay out airdrop, airdrop farmers. This is literally a token that's minted out of thin air. So you could argue that the actual cost of acquiring each customer is not really the cost of the tokens itself. So it's really kind of, you could argue that maybe the cost of creating the protocol behind the tokens, part of that gets dropped through this token, but it's not necessarily VC's directly handing out money through the founders to kind of airdrop farmers.
00:11:33.170 - 00:11:45.964, Speaker B: If anything, it's kind of like other retails paying other retailers. It's whoever's buying the token on the liquid markets that actually financing the value of these airdrops. So I didn't fully buy the narrative either. But curious what your thoughts are there.
00:11:47.224 - 00:12:38.394, Speaker A: The one takeaway from here that I always find interesting is that a couple of years ago I remember Haso on a podcast saying that post airdrops crypto founders seem to have forgotten that they can also give people cash. Like if you think about referral programs across web two, they raise a bunch of money from venture funds and then they hand out cash very often. I mean it's coupons and stuff, but you can also literally hand out cash. And I remember when Uniswap did the second airdrop that they did for their NFT aggregator, they pay people $250 in USDC. And I sometimes wonder, like now people are raising like now we see massive fundraisers in crypto of many millions of dollars, upwards of ten, sometimes 50. Sometimes I wonder if it would just be better for teams to just give smaller but smaller USDC airdrops. That helps kind of not create this whole dumping dynamic for their token.
00:12:38.394 - 00:12:52.874, Speaker A: It's not like any of the reasons to give people a token, which is like, oh, these people are going to vote in my governance forum. That's not going to happen anyway. They're probably going to sell your token for us dollars. You could also just give them us dollars if you've raised enough.
00:12:53.294 - 00:13:27.388, Speaker B: Yeah, so just skip the step. Skip the selling step. Just give them us dollars directly. I think that's, that's probably, that would fit the narrative around. Airdrops are a way to get money from VC's to retails that would actually fit the narrative better versus kind of minting tokens, which I think actually is a good way for us to start to dive into the objective analysis of this, which is like, are airdrops a good decision for teams in crypto? So I think there's multiple ways to measure this. There's like the financial perspective. You can look at the cost of airdrops added together.
00:13:27.388 - 00:14:16.432, Speaker B: So the dollar amount of tokens that you have dropped to your customers versus the amount of money that you've made from these customers. So this is kind of the classic customer lifetime value, like CLV versus customer acquisition cost CAC analysis. And I've actually been thinking about this for a while and our good friend Richard, from one confirmation, actually did a full analysis of this. So for those of you listening, and I really recommend that you look up on YouTube, just Richard Chen, Airdrop Dune, and you see the whole 20 minutes talk about how Richard breaks it down in terms of every protocol and how much they spend and how much they're making on the people they spend money on. And for those of you watching this on video, I'm just pulling up the dune dashboard here. You can look at the cost of airdrop for all of these companies. And Sana, it's pretty crazy.
00:14:16.432 - 00:14:51.068, Speaker B: If you look at looksrare, for instance, the cost of tokens that they've dropped to their users is about $270 million and they've actually generated around $200 million in fees. So it's actually not even profitable from a pure CLV Cac in the hazardous perspective. And there are some even more egregious cases like x two, y two dropped like $50 million of tokens and they made like $1.7 million in fees. So I think luxware is already one of the better examples. And there's so many other bigger examples. I mean, apecoin is probably the craziest example here.
00:14:51.068 - 00:15:23.694, Speaker B: So ape dropped like $8.5 billion, $8.6 billion worth of tokens and they made like $95 million back in fees from other deed, from selling their nfts, from their royalty fees and so on. So from this perspective, it seems like from a purely, purely financial sense, it rarely makes sense to actually do airdrops. If you're, if your only goal is to make money and turn a profit on these airdrops, I don't know what your thoughts are here. Is this even the right way to think about this or calculate this?
00:15:24.754 - 00:16:02.850, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is interesting and useful, but a little too web two oriented past a certain point. And I know we're going to discuss this. I think there's a bunch of other ways to look at this. At the end of the day, token market caps are super relevant. And so if what you spend, if you spend a million dollars giving out an airdrop, and eventually that leads to much more than a million dollar of addition in your token market cap, it actually is kind of free. That's one way to think about it. The way I think about airdrops and maybe incentive program much more generally, is whether you can use them to build a moat or not.
00:16:02.850 - 00:16:39.344, Speaker A: And I think it wasn't exactly an airdrop, but the one I love the most is Lido's initial incentives given to their curve pool. And so way back before ETH 2.0 even launched Lido incentivized a curve pool that allowed you to trade very easily out of stake teeth into ETH and vice versa. That pool became massive. It had like billions of dollars of liquidity. And it just gives so much comfort to anyone who's picking a liquid staking token to know that there's billions of dollars of liquidity that I can trade in and out of any time. And then that kind of lets you build a huge moat around liquidity.
00:16:39.344 - 00:17:08.093, Speaker A: That also makes it much easier to get listings on lending platforms, because lending platforms are primarily concerned with whether your token is liquid enough. And I think it's now very clear that Lido doesn't really need to do any incentives, but they've won. And there was a key moment because liquidity has such strong network effects that they actually used incentives to create a moat for themselves. I think moats are really important, and most founders, to Richard's credit, are not thinking about them and just kind of handing out money for free.
00:17:08.673 - 00:17:13.969, Speaker B: Was that a liquidity incentive, like an ongoing kind of liquidity mining thing, or is that like a one off airdrop?
00:17:14.161 - 00:17:16.373, Speaker A: I think it was a liquidity incentive primarily.
00:17:16.993 - 00:17:48.502, Speaker B: Do you think there's like a material difference between airdrops and liquidity incentives? Because I feel like liquidity incentives at least allow you a longer time to retain some users and build some habits into your users, and maybe build that Lindy. But then for airdrops, it's always like a one off kind of retroactive thing. So it seems like the former probably is more expensive because it lasts longer, but not necessarily if you look at like apecoin, but the latter, like airdrops are kind of a little bit kind of, you just blow your entire load in one go, which sometimes doesn't work.
00:17:48.678 - 00:18:05.054, Speaker A: And I think we are blurring that line these days, pun intended, with blur, which is like seasons points, but money coming in every so often. So I think that line is getting blurred. But yes, I agree that airdrops are definitely fundamentally different.
00:18:05.834 - 00:18:50.856, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you make a good point as well. Even if you do purely think about this in a financial sense, maybe the right framework is not customer lifetime value, it's not the amount of fees you make from these users, but it's actually the addition in market cap, because that's more apples to apples, the tokens you spend versus the value in tokens that you created from this campaign. And I think a small critique I would have for this CAC analysis is what we discussed before, which is like tokens are minted out of thin air. It's literally a few lines of code. It's not like this is actual cash raised from VC's being distributed. So the revenues, on the other hand, are measured in real dollars. So technically, if you use real dollars, the CAC should be the cost involved in creating the tokens and not the dollar value of the tokens.
00:18:50.856 - 00:19:36.886, Speaker B: So that could be the combined salary of the people involved in creating tokens up to that point. But then that becomes, like way too granular to matter. But I think this was a helpful framework to think about, to really force people to think about the magnitude of the discrepancy behind the potential dollar value that projects are spending in order to make x amount of fees. So I like to kind of move on to the second point, which is what you brought up just now, slightly more qualitative things beyond market cap as well. So, like airdrops, maybe they're a good way to increase liquidity, like you mentioned for Lido, maybe they're a good way to increase attention. So I think you have a good example about Sui versus Aptos here, right? Yeah.
00:19:36.910 - 00:19:53.534, Speaker A: Though. So Sui didn't do an airdrop to users that used its testnet while Aptos did. And at the time, everyone was up in arms and a whole bunch of people were like, we hate sui. They didn't reward us. Aptos is the chain of the future. We love Aptos. Aptos is a much stronger community.
00:19:53.534 - 00:20:43.804, Speaker A: And I remember watching around then and being like, maybe Sui should have done an airdrop just to kind of avoid a lot of this negative press. But I think the thing, the takeaway now for me actually a year later, is that it didn't matter. Like, I know that right now, the battle between Sui Aptos and smart contract platforms running move generally is very much a BD battle of Dev of developer experience. And there are lots of very sharp teams launching on Sui, there are lots of very sharp teams launching on Aptos. And everyone seems to have forgotten, other than maybe some airdrop farmer who was not really going to contribute anything anyway, who is still screeching at the bottom of the Sui founders replies. But, like, I just think it just didn't matter very much. Like, what matters 1234 years down the line? Again, as boring as it is, as like product VD, getting people to build on your platform, getting people to use your platform.
00:20:43.804 - 00:21:13.474, Speaker A: And so I also think, and this is somewhat true of Paraswap as well, founders can maybe develop stronger armor around these things. And to my mind, the Sui Aptos example is really, yes, you'll get attention for a month, but that attention for a month is not going to matter to two to three years down the line. So I almost think it's a pretty instructive example of, like, maybe you don't have to do an airdrop. The world won't come crashing down.
00:21:13.894 - 00:21:20.354, Speaker B: So when you say attention for month, is this because most of these airdrop farmers, you expect them to just sell within, like, the first month?
00:21:22.174 - 00:21:49.294, Speaker A: Yeah. Also, I think there may be this perception that, like, oh, the community hates sui and so we shouldn't build there. I don't think that lasted like, that would have been the, like, negative effect here. Right. Like, let's say Aptos does an airdrop and everyone in the community is happy and a whole bunch of developers are like, oh, look, Aptos treats its community well a year later. I just don't think that's the case. I think developers are willing to build on Sui because there are users on Sui and developers are willing to build on aptos because there are users on aptos.
00:21:50.354 - 00:21:51.578, Speaker B: Yeah. I feel like the big, I don't know.
00:21:51.586 - 00:21:59.534, Speaker A: Have you seen, yeah, I'm curious. Have you seen an example where just, like, getting attention from an airdrop has mattered, like, one to two years down the line?
00:21:59.954 - 00:22:41.890, Speaker B: I think it's so hard to actually attribute the impact on a protocol's value or market cap on the airdrop because you could. I think one extremely cherry picked example is if you look at the performance of Aptos after a binance listing versus sweat after binance listing, it's clear that there wasn't a lot of attention. I think it's one of the only very few high profile binance listings that just did poorly a month after listing. Talk about sweet. But then if you look at Aptos, a lot of things happened at that time. There was a lot of korean liquidity buying it because of the apartment mean, because the ticker is, you know, reminds me korean retails of, about buying apartments, and they made this meme about buying apartments by buying apt. So there's a lot of other kind of variables.
00:22:41.890 - 00:23:10.386, Speaker B: It's very hard to say that this protocol is valuable because of the airdrop or this protocol is valuable in spite of the airdrop. But one thing that I will say, though, is I think for l one s, it's l one. Founders are actually selling two products. So the first product is the actual chain itself, and their customers are developers. They have to sell this chain to developers and get developers to come on and build stuff and build their businesses on it. The other product, which is completely separate is the token and their customers. There are investors, retail speculators.
00:23:10.386 - 00:24:04.270, Speaker B: They have to convince people to buy and hold this token so they accrue value to this token so that they can use this token to finance development and make the network more secure and so on. So I think airdrops, unless you're airdropping directly to developers like Celestia, I don't think they do much to onboard developers. Which goes back to my original tweet about how airdrops aren't really doing anything to grow crypto. But I could see the argument that airdrops could grow the token side of things by giving more attention to a project, by creating more decentralization instead of having tokens held in the hand of the team and VC's. This is a quick way to just blurt out a lot of tokens to a lot of people at the same time. But I don't know if there's other better ways to decentralize your tokens or faster ways to decentralize the token. To me this seems like a kind of quick and dirty way of just saying, hey, this is it, we're decentralized.
00:24:04.462 - 00:24:37.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that is probably true. And I think founders have get weird advice legally about what it means to be decentralized. And they're like, yeah, okay, we need to get our tokens in the hands of the public. I mean, there's lots of data showing these people will sell your token. That's what's going to happen here. But yeah, I think the one other opinion I have is that I agree for layer ones that it is important because you want your tokens to have moneyness and decentralization. I think we're also reaching a stage where I think applications could benefit more from thinking about their tokens as programmable equity.
00:24:37.834 - 00:25:12.164, Speaker A: The truth is, no one is going to think of your defi apps token as money. That's just not going to happen. And consequently, I know what you mean about minting tokens out of thin air, but they do have a cost. Having more tokens in your treasury gives you the ability to fundraise more later, gives you the ability to incentivize more later, gives you the ability to pay developers more later. And so that cost is quite real. Like we actually, I don't know if you've encountered cap tables where you can't invest because there's just like not enough of the token left to incentivize the team and investors. And so I do think it's worth being careful in these situations.
00:25:12.464 - 00:25:42.866, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, no, I think that makes sense. And I feel like actually, icos and private sales. Oh, sorry, public sales are actually a better way of decentralizing your tokens than just airdrops, because you're actually forcing a financial buy in. So you're self selecting people who want to pay money to get those tokens. Now, the flip side I could see is like, okay, people who can't afford to invest in things. Well, first of all, if you can't afford to invest in risky ventures, I think there's a reason why accreditation laws exist. I don't agree with all of them, but not everybody has to invest in every single crypto protocol.
00:25:42.866 - 00:26:25.688, Speaker B: But second of all, I do see the point that, hey, maybe for people who can't invest, they prefer to spend time using the protocol to farm tokens that way. So there is a benefit in terms of, like, unquote, leveling the playing field a bit. But I still think in terms of incentive alignment, from a pure mechanism design perspective, private sales, sorry, public sales, icos are still better, but unfortunately, the legal ramifications of those are too big and they're just too easy for scams. So we let, I wouldn't even say a few bad apples ruin the entire ICO phenomenon. I think we have hundreds of bad apples. So it's kind of understandable that, like, icos were completely shut down as a phenomenon. But I just think that's a shame, because at one point, I did think that icos were a credible way to disrupt the entire venture capital industry.
00:26:25.688 - 00:27:07.644, Speaker B: Like, why do you need to raise from VC's if you can raise billions of dollars crowdfunding? Because before icos, all the crowdfunding websites were raising like, a few million dollars max for the biggest deals. But then after the 2017 icos, you realize, oh, shit, actually, we can raise billions of dollars from retails directly. But unfortunately, that's my ICO rant of the day. So ICO is not going anywhere. So we're going back to airdrops for now. I think let's move on to the third point, which is beyond the qualitative, beyond the financials. Are airdrops actually a good business decision? Like, do they help you retain users? So I think a few examples that we can look at here are things that are.
00:27:07.644 - 00:27:51.394, Speaker B: Let me actually take a look at what our notes are here in terms of looks rare. I think in Richard's talk that we mentioned earlier, he made a point about how people who received the airdrop from Luxray actually didn't contribute as much revenue to people who didn't receive the airdrops. So what exactly was the Luxray airdrop incentivizing was the kind of big question there. And then in terms of retention, I think you mentioned that about a month afterwards a lot of the airdrop farmers drop off and they don't really participate in governance. So is it even a good tool to retain users? I'm not sure if you've seen any examples there that might point to the contrary, or you generally agree there that it's not a great tool for retention.
00:27:51.854 - 00:28:27.220, Speaker A: Yeah, I strongly feel it's not a good tool for retention. I really think airdropping a bunch of tokens is not a recipe to have someone use your protocol a year later. I guess the strongest counter example I would give, though, is that I don't know whether they were airdrops exactly. They were icos. But the link community and the BNB community are both communities of people who bought the token. So maybe the difference here is ICO, who bought the token generally made quite a lot of wealth on the token and continue to just be completely obsessed with the token. I don't know if you've been on four Chan's business forum ever.
00:28:27.220 - 00:28:58.716, Speaker A: If you go on four Chan's business forum for the last five years, there are always at least three threads talking about how link is the future of blockchain, future of scaling, and how the token is just going to pump immediately. And I really wonder, like what creates that kind of a cult and making people money can create that kind of a cult. And so if you add up your token at a really low value and it goes up, maybe you have someone who cares a lot about your community. But I find it very, very. I basically just don't believe it creates user attention in any meaningful sense of the word.
00:28:58.900 - 00:29:41.158, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I absolutely agree. Those are the two biggest examples of exactly what I was saying. Like, this is controversial because like, it's, it's not pc to say that icos are good now because it's like, you know, obviously there's a lot of scams there, but how Lync and how BNB created so much attention and retention around them, besides actually having products that work, is because the incentive alignment from day one was much more pure than an airdrop. With an airdrop, you're really not sure. There's a lot of symbols or people who are really here just for the airdrop. But then if you ask people to, you know, put money down to buy a token, you're creating incentive alignment and self selecting your participants from day one. And if your token does well and you make the money, then obviously they will have more incentives to stick around.
00:29:41.158 - 00:30:33.550, Speaker B: And I think those are two big examples of why I think the ICO model, any type of model similar to icos, is much more superior than airdrops for kind of retention. And this comes to the point about airdrop farmers. Are they even real users? I think the kind of sweet narrative that Twitter tries to paint is that airdrop farmers are just everyday Joe's trying to make a buck, trying to stick it to the man. But that's not even true, because a big percentage of airdrop farmers are actually just Sybil bots, where these are sophisticated market makers, sophisticated investors, not your everyday retailers using Robinhood. These are guys who are creating bots to Sybil the shit out of these protocols. So these are, I think there was a study done on hot protocol, gnosisafe and Connext. These are some of the first protocols that did an actual anti sibling campaign for their airdrops.
00:30:33.550 - 00:30:58.816, Speaker B: And after doing that, they realized that for HUD protocol, one third of the users of the volume was fake. And then for gnosis, safe, like 22% was fake. And then Connext was at minimum. At minimum, 9% was fake. And I think they set the parameters quite loosely for Connext. So Richard mentioned this in his talk as well. So basically, unless they're 100% sure that this is actually a bottle, they would not qualify as Sybil.
00:30:58.816 - 00:31:21.564, Speaker B: So 9% is the lower end. So you can see like a big chunk of users on these protocols. Farming for airdrops are not even everyday retails. They are kind of sophisticated investors. They could be VC's for eye care. So I don't know if airdrop, is that just like part of airdrops or is that unavoidable? I'm curious what your thoughts are there.
00:31:22.724 - 00:32:03.760, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think it's just got so much worse. Right, which is to your point, like, we basically have industrial airdrop farming now. Like there exists telegram bots. I don't think I've ever used one of these. You can just like press a button and like give it access to do transactions on your behalf, and it'll just start doing a whole bunch of layer zero transactions on your behalf. Like it'll send some bridge transactions twice a day, I think. And so there's a weird sense in which I really think what you said earlier is correct, that the first few airdrops, like Uniswap, was like this magical airdrop, but it kind of made it so that nobody else can do a perfect airdrop anymore because there's like a meta and there's a game gamification going on now.
00:32:03.760 - 00:32:21.594, Speaker A: And I think if you look at the largest airdrops that people are excited about right now, layer zero, Zksync scroll, they're literally just being industrial adopt farming is the correct word. I don't think there's like any sense in which they're just like, rewarding cute users who, like, want to trade on scroll. That's just like, not what's happening anymore.
00:32:22.374 - 00:32:40.754, Speaker B: Do you agree with the cute narrative that actually a lot of these users are just like everyday Joe's who are actually using these products because they like it, not because they want to farm? Like, if we completely remove airdrops, is that a big loss to the crypto space in terms of, like, inclusiveness of, like, retails and, you know, participation from retails?
00:32:42.404 - 00:33:11.962, Speaker A: It's hard to answer because something I alluded to earlier in this conversation is that the Uniswap airdrop honestly has a special place in my heart. I feel emotional about it. But then I look at what's happening on layer zero right now and I'm like, yeah, this is just stupid. This is just stupid. There's no other word to describe all of this activity. I think it is nice that you can just use a protocol and get some small financial reward for it. That is a fun part of crypto.
00:33:11.962 - 00:33:33.074, Speaker A: Cool that you can do stuff like that. It's cool that I bought an NFT and some other team decided to airdrop me a token. All of this stuff is fun and adds to the speculative mania that basically is the fuel of crypto markets, for better or worse. But I think we do have to arrive at a meta that does not look like what layer zero and zksync look like right now somehow.
00:33:33.374 - 00:33:41.486, Speaker B: So what is happening on layers zero? I'm going to pull up this photo that you shared. When you say, what's going on layer zero, is this what you mean? Yeah.
00:33:41.510 - 00:34:09.606, Speaker A: So my understanding is basically, of course, layer zero has been hinting at an airdrop for almost two years now. And it's obviously the team is very strong. They've raised a lot of money. I think they've built what is a good product, but it's just infested with airdrop farmers. Essentially. They throw off stats for any bridge. Like if you try and do any analysis of bridging volumes, it's hard to do any because layer zero is just filled with airdrop farmers.
00:34:09.606 - 00:34:39.037, Speaker A: I thought something really funny happened where there was a whole bunch of activity midway through the year, and then towards, like, layer zero, farmers essentially started giving up. I think there was just, like, fatigue, and there were a whole bunch of tweets going around on this. Also, like, layer zero activity is dropping off because farmers just, like, don't know whether they're ever going to get a token. It's getting tiring. They don't know what the market will be like. And I thought it was so funny that on December 8, layer Zero actually tweeted, saying, essentially, we will have a token. We've always planned to have a token.
00:34:39.037 - 00:35:12.614, Speaker A: And we hear the community is pissed off, and we promise that there will be a token happening in the first half of 2024. And literally the day after they tweeted, their volume started shooting back up. At this point, it's hard to deny that the layer Zero founding team and their users are in some sort of abusive relationship with each other. Like, I don't know, who is this good for? Like, layer Zero sends out a tweet saying, yeah, we'll have an airdrop sometime in the next eight months, and their volumes suddenly spike back up. It's just unclear to me that, like, who's winning in this whole game right here.
00:35:12.914 - 00:35:23.786, Speaker B: But do you think there is a benefit to this? Like, if it's on as long a timeframe as, like, eight months, does it force people to use layer zero more and maybe build the habit of just using layer zeros and maybe that's a way for them to build?
00:35:23.810 - 00:36:03.234, Speaker A: Lindy, I could see that. It just feels like right now, people are bridging when they don't need to bridge. And I don't know how you kind of make sure that you're hitting one target without also hitting the other. But layer zero really strikes me as, like, the worst of industrial airdrop farming at this point. And I'm just convinced that most of this volume, that, like, this huge volume spike after saying, it's not like, bridging demand changed over this period. Right? It's not like player Zero tweeted that, hey, we are going to have an airdrop and organic bridging demand change. And so I don't have a perfect solution, but this is not it for sure.
00:36:03.814 - 00:36:11.406, Speaker B: So I'm pulling up the image. For those of you watching on YouTube, this is a chart of. What exactly is this chart of? This is the number of bridges.
00:36:11.550 - 00:36:17.238, Speaker A: I think this is the number of messages sent on layer zero, essentially, which include token bridges and other message passing.
00:36:17.326 - 00:36:29.682, Speaker B: Got it. So they basically skyrocketed from zero to 700,000 on the daily in the period between February 2023 and July 2023. Is this like, this is before the announcers at Airdrop? This is just organic.
00:36:29.818 - 00:36:33.402, Speaker A: I mean, I think everyone always thought there would be a layer zero airdrop.
00:36:33.578 - 00:36:58.530, Speaker B: Ah. And then it kind of fell off after, and then after they tweeted out in December, it kind of started climbing again. So I guess if I think about this from, just to play devil's advocate, if I think about this from a product perspective, maybe the if, if you're incentivizing things such as liquidity, I don't know if the layer zero airdrop is only incentivizing bridge activities or incentivizing bridge liquidity as well. But if you're incentivizing it, the fun.
00:36:58.562 - 00:37:00.294, Speaker A: Part is no one knows, just to be clear.
00:37:02.114 - 00:37:40.354, Speaker B: So if they actually manage to incentivize these industrial farmers to provide liquidity, it actually makes for a better product because your bridge now has better liquidity. So everyday users can actually use the product better. So there is a benefit to it. But I think this is really no fault of the layer zero team. This is kind of the users, the industrial farmers that you mentioned that are just trying to find out exactly what projects are going to launch token in the next three, six months and just spam transactions there. That creates a lot of noise for founders in terms of trying to ascertain what exactly is organic users here. It makes it very hard to iterate on product features because now you don't know if it's incentivized or not.
00:37:40.354 - 00:38:15.390, Speaker B: So maybe the key is actually just don't announce your airdrop ever. Just do retroactive. Just reward users in a Christmas surprise like the uniswap situation. Create these kind of lifelong good memories for your users so that you build goodwill with your users instead of trying to build that expectations, because no matter what expectations you build, you can never meet them. I remember when say network said that they're going to have an airdrop and it came out. I think it was lower than what people were hoping for. And then this hashtag around sayscam started trending and every single say post on Twitter will be called out a scam.
00:38:15.390 - 00:38:46.810, Speaker B: And I was talking about say at that time and people were saying, this is the total fucking scam. And then six, eight months later they announced, you're doing parallel EVM. The same people are now hopping on the narrative saying, say is the future. Thanks for talking about say so I think that's just a sign of just how capricious and short term focused some of these leeches are. And I stand by the fact that a lot of them are leeches. So I think this is probably a good time to also talk about points. Is a new meta, well, new ish meta, that kind of occurred.
00:38:46.810 - 00:38:56.614, Speaker B: It's kind of as a response to airdrops. I know you've ducked into this quite a little bit, so can you kind of give us a high level, first of all, like, what exactly are points? How do they differ from airdrops?
00:38:57.914 - 00:39:35.216, Speaker A: Yeah, I think points are basically systems that projects use to give users some kind of quantification of the value they're driving to the protocol. And so the simplest example is you use a protocol, you get points. Those points are not tokens or they're not tokens just yet. The team determines how and why you get a certain number of points. And the criteria for points is at the best of the team. And I think what it does is it allows you to incentivize activity, it does some amount of gamification, and eventually it is always expected that points lead to tokens. And that's probably what will happen with teams like Eigen layer.
00:39:35.216 - 00:40:13.654, Speaker A: That's what happened with a team like Blur. That's what will happen with a team like Strentec. But I think two big differences from airdrops, just outside of them being not being tokens and therefore you can't sell them. Actually, you can sell them, which I'll talk about as well, is that it gives sounders some control over the criteria and kind of incentivizing new features. And so every week you can kind of say, okay, I have this new feature. I want people to try this out. I've noticed that people are providing too much liquidity in this pool and not providing enough liquidity in this pool, and it gives them kind of a lot of flexibility about what to incentivize over periods.
00:40:13.654 - 00:40:44.014, Speaker A: I think the second underrated benefit is the UI Ux. Like, I'm sure you use frontec for a while, I use fronttech for a while. The quantification is fun. It's like fun to know. Okay, I got 500 points this week, but actually Jason got 1500. And every Friday you get this notification saying, hey, your points are here, and I can't do anything with these points, but it feels good. I'm curious what your thoughts are on the points meta these days, given I'm sure some founders that you're working with have been thinking very deeply about them, too.
00:40:44.514 - 00:41:14.098, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it buys you a lot of time. You don't have to set any expectations for airdrops. You don't have to say that this is the amount of tokens we're going to set aside for the airdrop. And like you said, it can be, it's much more programmable because there's actually nothing on chain, but it can just be okay. We decide to award more weight to people who maybe make new connections on friendtech or more weight to people who send messages. And it can also give the flexibility in terms of, like, what behaviors to incentivize over time. Maybe for this month, I want to give more weight to people who send messages.
00:41:14.098 - 00:41:55.606, Speaker B: And this month I want to give more weight to people who make new follows or buy new keys on Friendtech. So it's a much more flexible tool for founders. And like you said, there's a big gamification element as well in terms of like, getting these points. And, you know, even if you don't get any immediate monetary value to it, I think it's still a powerful driver. I think crypto, people in crypto's brains are rotted by the fact that we're so used to instant gratification. We're so used to just people printing as money when we use certain products, or, you know, even when we're using like step in for for instance, where you just literally paid liquid money every day for walking. So I think people forget how powerful actually, even without the monetary end of it.
00:41:55.606 - 00:42:20.844, Speaker B: If you just create some sort of gamification using points in web two, this is already a tried and true formula. You don't need to pay your users every single day in real time for this to help you create some sort of retention. So I'm actually quite a big fan of points, and I know there's a lot of experiments going on right now. I think Eigen layer is doing something. I think fronttech, like you mentioned, is doing something. Should we dig into the Eigen layer pendle thing first?
00:42:21.784 - 00:43:19.778, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think broadly, the interesting thing is that the points meta has got so big that, and we live in the most financialized industry ever, that there are ways to sell your points. And so I think I probably the most interesting market here where Pendle has essentially launched a market where if you have a restake version of Ethereum, so you essentially put, you take staked Ethereum, you put it into Eigen layer. There's a whole bunch of protocols called liquid restaking protocols that will now give you, essentially a liquid representation of that token. So you have a token that represents ETH put into the Eigen layer contract. What Pendle lets you do is either sell that yield. So you can say that, hey, I'm happy to get a 30% APY right now, or I think it's actually closer to 40. And in return, I'm giving away the eigen layer points, whatever monetary value of eigen layer points I have.
00:43:19.778 - 00:43:50.514, Speaker A: And on the other side, if you're extremely bullish eigen layer, you can actually just leverage yourself and buy Eigen layer points. You can say, hey, I have one ETH, but I don't. I don't want to put it into Eigen layer. I want to leverage myself, and I want to get like five x the points that I could get. And of course, Pendle has done a great job setting up liquidity markets for this and how it works. But this is actually driving a lot of volume to liquidity staking tokens and to Pendle. And I think it's quite fascinating that broadly, you should be able to.
00:43:50.514 - 00:44:20.854, Speaker A: I like this market. I think it makes sense that there is a set of users who are extremely bullish Eigen layer. There is a set of users who are less bullish eigen layer, but are happy to capture some fixed yield. But I thought it was fascinating how this has driven a ton of volume to pendle recently, and kind of actually is a key component of the war that's happening between liquid restaking tokens right now, is their pendle integrations. I'm curious what you think about kind of eigen layer points trading.
00:44:21.594 - 00:44:34.644, Speaker B: Is this that different from airdrop? So if we replace the concept of points with Eigen tokens, and we allow people to sell their Eigen token rewards on uniswap, do you think it will be materially different from what's happening here?
00:44:35.344 - 00:44:51.472, Speaker A: Not particularly. I mean, it's a little complicated. It's a little more complicated, but at a high level, I think one big takeaway. And probably this is much more visible. If you look at something like whales market, I don't know if you've seen that, but Wales market is just a straight up points market. It's really funny. You can just go there and be like, hey, I have these many eigal points I'm willing to sell.
00:44:51.472 - 00:45:14.750, Speaker A: They escrow your tokens just to make sure you don't kind of do it. You can sell hyper liquid points here. You can sell friend tech points here. And so I think, you know, some part of these things. It's like, okay, the first airdrop was magical because we didn't know that airdrops were a thing. The first few points programs were magical because points remain illiquid. But the market is good at filling in needs, and people want liquidity on their points.
00:45:14.750 - 00:45:48.874, Speaker A: And some people want to speculate on points. Like, there's a whole bunch of people who have no desire to use a protocol. They just want to buy points. Like, if you ask me, I'm actually probably pretty bullish restaking. So if you told me, hey, there's a price at which I would totally buy Eigen layer points from you, I don't care about putting my ethan into Eigen layer. And so I think the takeaway is really that, like, these airdrops and incentivization are always in, like, being gamified from both sides. And I think if you try, like, as hard as you try in crypto to make illiquid instruments, someone ends up providing liquidity to them.
00:45:48.874 - 00:46:10.234, Speaker A: We both know that there are many venture firms in this world that love selling their lock tokens that are OTC desks that facilitate this trading. Similarly, whales market has come up to facilitate points trading. Once something gets enough scale in crypto, people will trade it, whether you like it or not. And so I think founders should also just be cognizant of that.
00:46:10.694 - 00:46:30.474, Speaker B: This is, I've never actually never seen whales market. I just pull it up for our YouTube watches here. So there's a bunch of eigenpoints being sold for different prices. So like twenty four cents. Twenty four cents per point. There's like twenty five cents per point. And then friendtech points as well, like $2 per point.
00:46:30.474 - 00:46:45.214, Speaker B: So how are these points priced? Because to my knowledge, I don't think Eigen or Frontech has announced any details about, like, how many tokens each point is corresponding to and how many tokens there will be. So is this just like randomly priced?
00:46:45.754 - 00:47:07.254, Speaker A: Is people speculating? I don't know if you've ever seen there are like a bunch of Twitter analysts who will put up, bring these big excel sheets. I wish I could. I'll try and find one where essentially they're like, okay, if they give this percentage of the token supply and each token is worth this, and this is what a point is worth, and it's up to you to speculate on, like, both sides of that criteria.
00:47:07.674 - 00:47:38.596, Speaker B: Yeah, this is actually incredibly bullish in predictions markets. I know Twitter seems to be having a field day with predictions markets this week for some reason, because poly market volumes went crazy. But this is like, goes back to your prediction for. I don't know if we discussed this on the last episode, but at least in our chats you mentioned the predictions market is probably going to be a pretty big thing. Basically, the takeaway from this is if there is a way to create liquidity and bet on some shit like crypto bros is going to do it. And we see this with whales market. I'm just pulling up the dune dashboard here.
00:47:38.596 - 00:47:46.742, Speaker B: There is $33 million of value escrowed on the platform and $42 million in volume already just for points.
00:47:46.918 - 00:47:53.286, Speaker A: The volume curve is clearly going parabolic, by the way. I think this is just like going to get bigger and bigger and bigger.
00:47:53.470 - 00:48:06.634, Speaker B: This is quite insane. And do you think airdrop farmers, the industrial airdrop farmers, are like the toxic airdrop farmers that we mentioned? Are they in favor of this trend or are they just like, ah shit, this is making things much more complicated?
00:48:07.974 - 00:48:46.974, Speaker A: I don't know. I guess it probably, you know, it's weird. If your specialization is just doing great wallet activity that appears to be real, it's probably useful for you to be able to sell your, sell that right now. In a weird way, I think of it as like in commodity markets, there are people who pull oil out of the ground and there are people who price oil. And the futures market kind of enables the people who pull oil out of the ground to not worry about prices. And the people who worry about prices do not worry about pulling oil out of the ground. So in a similar way, I guess there are people who are really good at farming airdrops and there are people who are really good at pricing points and this allows both of them to specialize in some way.
00:48:47.634 - 00:49:19.924, Speaker B: And I guess with the counter example to the argument that points are a good way to generate user retention, would that be the friendtech situation, which seems like no matter what they do with the points, it kind of fell off in terms of volume. I haven't used frantic as much because I, I made basically, I started a chat and whoever wanted to ask me questions, I tried to reply, but no, people just stopped asking questions after a while. And I don't think they got rid of the point stuff. I don't think they did the airdrop yet. So what exactly do you think happened there?
00:49:20.624 - 00:49:56.116, Speaker A: Yeah, I was also surprised. I think sometimes it's just hard to remember that product is king, but like, it is the thing that is most important. And clearly people stopped having fun on frontech and fintech also had a bunch of users who, like, I don't know. They had this home, they launched this feed once and I opened the feed and there were a bunch of people just like saying, oh, by the way, this is the best strategy to maximize your points. And I was like, yeah, this is not a social network I want to be hanging out on. And so I think, I do think it's a very instructive example. I was really surprised that activity fell off before when it launched.
00:49:56.116 - 00:50:14.974, Speaker A: Everyone was like, oh, we'll see. After they do the airdrop, that's when we'll really find out. But in fact, even before they did, the Airdrop people have just left the platform, which I think is quite bearish. I love Frontech. I thought it was like basically the coolest crypto product that came out last year. And I'm sure that team will build something cool. I feel like they have a great product sense.
00:50:14.974 - 00:50:38.082, Speaker A: But yeah, I feel like fintech totally fell off. And it's weird right now, you would imagine it's super lucrative to be farming friend because there's no one on there, which means you can probably get a whole bunch more points. The only explanation I have is that the market's perception of what Friendex token will launch at has fallen dramatically. I don't know. Do you think that's the case?
00:50:38.258 - 00:51:22.120, Speaker B: I don't know because there hasn't been a huge social token except for telegram. And I know that crypto markets tend to price whatever is the market leader or the category leader at an extreme premium. And we see this with celestial, you look at the revenues to generate and the market cap they are at. So I don't know if that's just people's expectations of the tokens or if it's just very indicative of the attention span of airdrop farmers. I mean, it's not like Frank lost all the users. They still have active users every day. But I think a lot of the people who went on for speculation, or a lot of people who are just going on for non committal like myself, I'm not going to use a product if there's no engagement on it.
00:51:22.120 - 00:52:02.128, Speaker B: And I was pretty explicit that, hey, I'm going to use this if people ask me questions. And people started falling off and it kind of just reflects a downward spiral. So this is not to say it's the end of it. They could come back one day if they launch more interesting features. But I think one takeaway that I have from the volume drawdown is basically a lot of the farmers and speculators left, but whoever's left actually are probably die hard users, whoever's still using the platform today. So if anything, the fintech team should probably reward people who are still on the platform today. But I think we should wrap it up by maybe giving some more actionable frameworks for teams out there who are thinking about airdrops.
00:52:02.128 - 00:52:39.476, Speaker B: We've looked at so many different airdrop programs. You looked at so many points programs. I'm pretty sure there's some maybe best practices or pitfalls that founders can look for. I think one that I'll point to is in terms of should founders do airdrops? I don't think I had the conviction to say that, no, we should completely scrap the idea of airdrops. What I'm against is kind of industrial farming and people pressuring founders to do things that are bad for the business because of entitlement around some amount of airdrops they think they're entitled to. I'm not completely against the idea of airdrops itself. I think airdrops can be powerful if they're very targeted.
00:52:39.476 - 00:53:42.744, Speaker B: So founders out there, I think the celestial Airdrop, Richard also mentioned this in this talk. I think it's like a great example, the airdrop to core devs or stakers in different ecosystem. I'll pull up the criteria right now for those of you watching on YouTube. So for the celestial airdrop, they deposited to users of top ten ethereum rollups. So they're actually rewarding people from other ecosystems, even though arbitrage and optimism are not using celestia as the a layer, but they are basically rewarding people who have proven themselves to be crypto native to stick around and the airdropping Cosmos hub and osmosis stakers, so people who already have provided security to different crypto networks, and more importantly, they are depositing to public GitHub contributors to the celestial code base. So actual builders, this is the type of stuff that I think actually helps your community in the long term for founders and also helps crypto grow because you're rewarding people who are providing value by using products and not just farming your product specifically. So I think this is an amazing example out there for how an airdrop could be done.
00:53:42.744 - 00:53:48.454, Speaker B: Any other examples you can think of, or any other kind of pitfalls that you think founders should avoid there?
00:53:49.194 - 00:54:26.104, Speaker A: I think Blur is a really good example as well. Actually, Blur is more of a points program, and I think Blur is actually a maker rebate program disguised as a points program. And so blur, I think the founder was very sharp and understood that the way that liquidity provision is happening on OpenSeA is kind of broken. Like there is no incentive on any traditional exchange. Market makers who provide liquidity to the platform actually earn a percentage of fees or are incentivized in some fashion. And Blur realized that having, you know, a market maker is not going to pay 5% fees on both sides of a transaction like that. Just create that.
00:54:26.104 - 00:55:07.610, Speaker A: That left the NFT market very illiquid. And so blur was very, very specific. They rewarded users who listed items, but they had to list items close to the price, where items were trading, actually bid on items, and actually just created liquidity and contributed a bunch of non watch trading volume. I think, first of all, it's been successful because nfts are just more liquid post blow. That's just the truth. You can exit large quantities of nfts. I actually know someone who worked in NFT market making extensively, and they were explaining to me how on opensea it was completely uneconomical for them to try and provide liquidity because you pay a 5% fees on both sides of the transactions, your holding period is too long.
00:55:07.610 - 00:55:57.234, Speaker A: But on blur, if you cross the spread, blur will pay you back in blurred points and tokens for when you cross the spread. And so I think that that was, to my mind, one of the best ones. And I know they continue to do this, but essentially, if you are an exchange, as we've noted before, incentivizing liquidity can make sense in a lot of cases. And this is something centralized exchanges do as well, by the way, like all centralized exchanges pay their largest market makers maker rebates. And so bloor did it really well. They also did a good job of excluding users who are just there to wash trade. And I think one of the other things you have to credit blur with is that they have a really fun ui ux around points, claiming and opening the treasure chests and getting lucky, and got some vitality around that as well.
00:55:57.234 - 00:56:00.970, Speaker A: And so I think blur is as a really great example of how to do points, actually.
00:56:01.042 - 00:56:46.722, Speaker B: Yeah. And if you look at the blur competitors, right, like, looks rare, x to y two, I believe their token airdrops and incentives were targeting volume. So they were actually trying to incentivize watch trading versus blur was targeting maker liquidity. So they're actually targeting a behavior that makes the product better, but like you said, also materially improve the liquidity of the NFT space. Now, not everything they did is, you know, completely not controversial on Twitter. I think there's some people with comments on blast and whatnot but I think this is one thing they did that was quite good in terms of targeting specific behavior and really using your airdrops for a purpose instead of just trying to do airdrops because everybody else is doing airdrops. I think one more recommendation for me is exploring better ways to counter symbol bots as well.
00:56:46.722 - 00:57:24.832, Speaker B: A lot of these bots are pretty detectable. Obviously, there's more sophisticated people who will make it easier to hide their tracks on chain. But like I said, for instance, the telegram bots that help you programmatically wash, trade, or create activity on layer zero, I think those are probably relatively easy to detect. So there are ways that perhaps could help with proof of personhood on chain. One company that I backed, a very, very early stage team called absinthe labs, they're creating basically captures for on chain identity. So this could be something that I think could help create actual good airdrop campaigns. So I'm not just shitting on airdrops.
00:57:24.832 - 00:57:35.052, Speaker B: I'm actually putting my money where my mouth is and trying to fund tools that can make this better. But anything else you want to close us out on in terms of what founders should look out for for airdrops?
00:57:35.228 - 00:57:56.832, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, just on the proof of personhood. I've been disappointed that no one uses world coin in the way it was intended to be used. As people on this podcast know, I'm a world coin, Stan. I had my eyeballs scanned by the orb. I have a world id. I think it just like it does a pretty good job of one person, one account. And if there's some way to integrate that into your airdrop process, it might actually help.
00:57:56.928 - 00:58:28.014, Speaker B: Yeah, so those are our big takeaways for the founders out there. So just to kind of synthesize there, make your airdrops more targeted. Reward builders and actual crypto natives who are providing value to ecosystems with a proven track record. Also target specific behaviors that make your product better and maybe make your protocol better. Explore points, and also explore proof of personhood on chain. So that is it for our airdrop. Rand, I have no doubt we're gonna get a lot of hate mail from airdrop farmers, but at this point, I'm kind of used to it.
