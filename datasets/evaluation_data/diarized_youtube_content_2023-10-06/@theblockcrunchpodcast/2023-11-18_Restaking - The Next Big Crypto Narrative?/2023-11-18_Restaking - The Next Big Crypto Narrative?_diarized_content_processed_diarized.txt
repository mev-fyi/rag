00:00:00.120 - 00:00:45.484, Speaker A: I actually think that restaking chain has kind of left the station so there's lots of conversation happening around risks. There's a super controversial bank less episode that I that I kind of recommend people listen to if they want to get a good sense of how the Ethereum foundation is thinking about it, how Eigen layer is thinking about this. But for people who are paying attention, Eigen layer recently had a blog post showing ten companies that are already going to be leveraging Eigen layer for security. So I think it just kind of makes a lot of intuitive sense like it puts a lot of risk on Ethereum. But at the end of the day ethereum is becoming I think the world's best crypto collateral and the kind of thing that and being able to leverage Ethereum's huge market cap to bootstrap security for your network is just an idea that even if it's risky for Ethereum I think will achieve product market fit. So I think restaking is going to be bigger.
