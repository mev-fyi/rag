00:00:00.200 - 00:00:27.793, Speaker A: We tell all of our founders to not launch or think of a token, right? You know, you want to build a great product and you want all the things. All of the lessons I've talked about is without a token. If you know, mention if you've seen it. There's nothing about a token or airdrop. So it should be out of your purview and it should be really about like meeting the user where they are. Like are you solving a real world problem?
00:00:27.889 - 00:00:30.465, Speaker B: Web3 offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:30.505 - 00:00:32.333, Speaker A: Our jobs to buy great tech a great prices.
00:00:32.389 - 00:01:16.361, Speaker B: AI is also libertarian enable use case that people haven't been able to do today. The next hundreds of millions of players they will come to the market through mobile.

Now, if you're building anything in crypto, the next 60 minutes are probably going to be the most important 60 minutes that you spend this week because it's the cheat sheet to beat your competitors.
00:01:16.361 - 00:02:04.035, Speaker B: Now, one of the things that's the most important to me as an angel investor is how founders speak of us after working with us. And I don't think a lot of people in this space share the philosophy as strongly as my next guest, who is Imran Khan, the co founder of Alliance. So alliance are known for their high touch and personal approach to startup, mentorship and investing, and they recently secured a funding round from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund as well. And they've seen dozens and dozens and dozens of companies come and go in crypto and they have amassed valuable lessons that I love to dive into with Imran today. So I'm extremely excited to have you on Imran because I'm also a fan of your podcast Good Game, which I recommend everybody listening to the this podcast to check out, especially if you want to get a sense of, you know, what's in the weeds, what are the apps that are taking off, what are people interested in? So welcome to the show, man. Very excited for this.
00:02:05.535 - 00:02:15.383, Speaker A: Likewise. You know, obviously I was telling this in the background before we started the pod, but I've been listening to Blockcrunch since 2018. Was it?
00:02:15.519 - 00:02:23.235, Speaker B: Yeah, no I appreciate that, man. I launched, I think like late or early 2018, like before I started investing, but this was my first project.
00:02:23.595 - 00:02:30.619, Speaker A: I saw your tweet when you put it out there that you're thinking about experimenting with the podcast. So I remember that.
00:02:30.747 - 00:02:52.415, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. This is a long time ago and I think I should probably put out a disclaimer that I am actually an angel investor in alliance in your community round a long time ago. But yeah, why don't you give us a background because I know a lot of people who listen to the show probably already know and respect what you guys are doing. But for people who are not aware, what is alliance, how did you guys start and what are you guys working on?
00:02:52.835 - 00:03:33.125, Speaker A: Yeah, think of alliance as an accelerator program for crypto. You know, there, there are many accelerators across the entire startup sector and I think where we are is kind of highly specialized to supporting, you know, crypto founders. We run two batches a year, about 50 startups a year. We have a team of a group of researchers, product managers, engineers that kind of are more hands on and support the founders. In our community, we are structured like a traditional fund. So we have like a fund that invests in the startups. As soon as they get accepted into our program, we support them.
00:03:33.125 - 00:03:40.745, Speaker A: Then we have a typical demo day and then after that demo day, they kind of like leave the nest and go out and build their product.
00:03:41.595 - 00:04:09.787, Speaker B: Yeah. And I don't think there's any other kind of investing entity I've come across in crypto that has as good of a kind of word of mouth referral as you guys. Because everyone I talk to who work with alliance has good things to say and that's kind of something that we pride ourselves in as well. It's like we want to have this kind of high referral score. When you guys were first building Alliance, I also remember at the beginning it was called like Defi Alliance. Right. So what was the journey there? Like, what led to the expansion into just Alliance?
00:04:09.971 - 00:04:27.255, Speaker A: I mean, if. To be quite frank, I. When we started alliance, it wasn't supposed to be a. It was supposed to be just a free mentorship program. That was kind of the, the idea behind it. It was actually called Chicago Defi alliance because I'm originally from Chicago. And.
00:04:27.255 - 00:04:54.621, Speaker A: Yeah, and the core thesis was, and you know, this is where luck comes in a lot of, in many ways. And this is what we tell our founders. Luck, timing and things of that nature. And this is probably going to be good advice for all founders. But when we first Started this mentorship program. I was a part of another fund. And within this fund we're trying to figure out like, what is like our strategic value that we could provide to our founders.
00:04:54.621 - 00:05:38.625, Speaker A: And if you look across the crypto spectrum, back in 2019, it was still pretty competitive. I mean like, if you look at like a 6 and Z paradigm all the way down to all the other funds that are all across the globe, I mean, it was very competitive. And so what I thought was like, why don't I find a small niche? And the niche was Chicago. And Chicago has, is actually very well known for trading, infrastructure, trading, market making. Most of the derivatives volume flows through Chicago. So there's a really strong core group of market makers and engineers that live in Chicago. So I was like, well, why don't I recruit all the market makers and get them together and see if this is, could, this could be a good way for us to provide mentorship for Defi founders.
00:05:38.625 - 00:05:57.285, Speaker A: Because at that time, every Defi chat, if you remember, they were all trying to figure out how to get product market fit. You know, there was liquidity. There's some liquidity. This is before, like the incentives program. This is Post Haven's incentives program. But pre compound. Yeah.
00:05:57.285 - 00:06:26.875, Speaker A: So we Got Jump, Cumberland, CMT Digital and like 25 other market makers together. We convinced them why they should believe in DeFi because a lot of them said no when I first pitched them. Convinced them. We started a mentorship program. And this mentorship program brought in a lot of great startups and that kind of started the flywheel. Right. And so after our first program was done, founders wanted access to the market makers, they wanted access to the mentorship.
00:06:26.875 - 00:06:34.055, Speaker A: And then Defi Summer happened and that was where the luck came in. Right. And then that kind of like took us to the next level.
00:06:34.995 - 00:06:49.497, Speaker B: And Imran, I know it's technically still early days, but you guys already have a few big hits. In fact, I think some of the most used applications this cycle have been products of Alliance. So what are some of the big successes that came out of your demo days? Just to give a taste to our audience.
00:06:49.651 - 00:07:10.901, Speaker A: Yeah, we've had Pendle Pump, Manta, step in, tensor, avo0x, glow, xerion, chain, Flip. So yeah, those are some of the names that I could think of right now.
00:07:11.053 - 00:07:44.421, Speaker B: Yeah, what I love about that is also you guys focus a lot on apps, which is something that I want to focus a lot on as well with Tangent, because, you know, my thesis is basically there has been a lot of overinvestment into Infra and we're kind of at this inflection point where we're pushing the limits of how much more you can improve in terms of performance. And at some point, you know, we got to build some stuff that people can actually build onto these chains and bring people to build on these chains. I'm curious, like when you guys first started, was it always this application focused and do you kind of share that view in terms of, okay, there's probably enough capital going into Infra, let's build some apps.
00:07:44.513 - 00:08:30.173, Speaker A: When we first started, we actually started with Defi because Defi was the only kind of sector that took off. Then we moved to NFTs because then quite soon after it was NFTs then we opened it up to kind of all of all of crypto. So we've, we've, we've supported Infra and so we've had like Caldera, which is a roll up as a service. We've had layer ones, L2s that have joined our accelerator program. But for us, like when it comes down to it and when we think about where value accrues, a lot of the value accrues to the app side. And so we were always interested in touching user behavior and understanding ways to grow, you know, use cases around crypto. I tweeted out, probably, maybe it was like close to a year ago where I said fat protocol thesis is dead.
00:08:30.173 - 00:08:54.422, Speaker A: It was quite controversial at the time. And you know, like I do think that, you know, if we want to grow crypto to a billion users, like we've heard this tagline before, the only way you can do that is if you scale out apps. Apps will help scale out infra. And so we did put quite a bit of focus into apps over Infra. But we do still support a lot of infra.
00:08:54.558 - 00:09:32.085, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think you're absolutely right on that. This is something that we've talked about since we first started Tangent as well, which is I think this, I think the market really rewards betting on info because Even, you know, L1 with no users they can get like billions of FTV. But the market is starting to realize that, which is bringing a lot of people to not want to buy these quote unquote VC coins, which kind of led to the whole meme coin cycle as well. So I think we kind of saw that, that this is probably going to happen. This free arb for like investing in random infra and just getting a free kind of hundred x markup probably won't last forever. But at the same time, you know, it's hard to deny that building on crypto sucks. Right.
00:09:32.085 - 00:09:48.705, Speaker B: It tends to make things more expensive, it's sometimes less secure, slower. So what do you think are apps that have a natural fit with crypto? Right? Like apps that could withstand this, maybe additional friction for user onboarding and increase the cost of using the app.
00:09:49.165 - 00:10:22.385, Speaker A: But somehow still I think there's like probably two areas. You know, they're speculative and non speculative. Like that's the way I would focus on in terms of apps now. You know, speculative can be anywhere from, you know, pump fun or it could be, you know, trading in trading. It could be, you know, card games like Fantasy Top. And so there's a lot of speculative apps that could be built. In fact, like if you look at all of the games that are available on the app store, there could be some speculative element to it.
00:10:22.385 - 00:11:15.175, Speaker A: And so what, what people do now when they design these games, they think about it from like kind of a regulatory perspective and they'll use points instead of dollars and they just create like this hyper addictive loops where people can pay $2, $3 for additional stickers or something. And that's how they generate revenue. And a lot of these apps, you know, even though they're not really well known, can generate an upwards of 100 to 200 million dollars a year. And so they're very, very profitable. So there is an opportunity for speculative apps to actually come in under the guise of real money games and really kind of attack this market from a consumer perspective. So speculative, non speculative, you know, they're stable coins, there's AI crypto, there's ZK and RWAs. Real world assets.
00:11:15.175 - 00:11:52.747, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's many on the non speculative side. So really when you think about the founders that you're working with, you really want to think about what ideologies they believe in because it's a very, very dogmatic approach. Like you know this Jason. Like if you look at crypto today and you look at the VC landscape, there's one that is one group that's very focused on non speculative applications. And then there's one that's like, you know, very speculative and then there's someone in between that kind of does both. And so it just really depends on areas of opportunities and kind of going after it.
00:11:52.811 - 00:12:27.925, Speaker B: I think it's interesting that, you know, even in the examples you mentioned for non speculative, like RWAs a lot of, a lot of that is, you know, bringing things like treasury yields on chain so people can speculate on them. And then, you know, ZK more On the infra side, perhaps. So I feel like outside of payments, right, Outside of stablecoins, the universe of non speculative crypto apps that have a decent shot at beating whatever the closest experience is in web2 is actually quite small. I don't know if you agree with that, but I feel like most apps in crypto tend to have a speculative element and probably will continue to have a speculative element.
00:12:28.005 - 00:12:52.635, Speaker A: Yeah, I could agree with that. It's very hard for. Yeah, I mean, like it's very hard for. I mean crypto superpower is speculation. I mean that is what makes crypto crypto. I mean, why do you think Donald Trump is shilling crypto? I mean, it's because he's making money on it, right? Like he's minting NFTs, he's selling shoe NFT shoes or trying to raise for his defi thing. It's just, it's money, it's speculation.
00:12:52.635 - 00:13:14.165, Speaker A: And so the way I see it is at the end of the day, social, like, like traditional, like if you look at outside of crypto, the addictive loops are, you know, likes dopamine heads, network effects, like, you know, things like that. Those are the dopamine heads for crypto. It's, it's money, it's speculation, it's price going up.
00:13:14.865 - 00:13:46.825, Speaker B: So I, I'm sure you remember as well. Like back in 2017, a big part of crypto was like, okay, let's try to do like web 2 shit, but on web 3 rail, so you have like Amazon on blockchains and maybe like a YouTube but on blockchains. So those were distinctively non speculative and they, you know, none of them really took off. So do you think it was like the lack of speculation in those applications is the reason people were not interested in them? Or will these type of like completely non speculative, just like skeuomorphic. Let's bring some web2shit to web3apps, make a comeback at some point.
00:13:46.905 - 00:14:14.723, Speaker A: Yeah, they will. I just think that they can't be skeuomorphic. They have to solve a real world problem is the way I see it. I haven't seen anything yet. I mean I've seen like Uber on, on the blockchain and maybe there's some cost savings there. But you know what, like if you look at like Web two products that have taken off, they heavily benefit from centralization, economies of scale and things of that nature. So.
00:14:14.723 - 00:14:41.719, Speaker A: And in crypto it's very hard to build something like that on layer one or L2. Right. And so maybe it could be more of an Infra issue. Maybe it's more of an ethos issue. And then there's also like a solution looking for a problem. Right. Like so like if there is something to be built that you mentioned, like shopping or Uber or whatnot, it really has to solve a real world pain point.
00:14:41.719 - 00:14:58.135, Speaker A: And the only real world pain point I could think of with Uber as an example is the fact that drivers aren't getting paid enough. Right. That's what I hear all the time from, from my side when I take a ride. It's. It's absolutely great. Right. Maybe it's a little bit expensive, but it's fine.
00:14:58.135 - 00:15:17.501, Speaker A: And so really it's one sided real world problem shopping. I love Amazon. I have no issues with it. Like I don't know how you're going to compete with them. And so a lot of this is economies of scale and like, you know, network effects that they have. So these types of products I don't see. But maybe there could be like, you know, other types of niches that you could build out of it.
00:15:17.501 - 00:15:20.429, Speaker A: And that's something that, you know, I'm open to exploring.
00:15:20.597 - 00:15:48.005, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is a good segue to the segment of the podcast where we talk about some tips that you guys have for founders because you recently did a really great talk at Breakpoint, which I'll link in the show notes below. I really enjoyed it because of how kind of concise and useful it is. And one of the things that you mentioned is avoid consensus idea. So this is one of the tips you give to founders. So I consider a lot of the skeuomorphic things consensus ideas back in the day. Right. Everybody wants to take the biggest Web2 company and bring it on chain.
00:15:48.005 - 00:15:57.505, Speaker B: Now it's probably things like prediction markets. You know, what would you say are some of the consensus ideas and why should people avoid them? Like, why should people run away from these trends?
00:15:58.005 - 00:16:42.311, Speaker A: Yeah, it's crazy. Like I would say every other day I get a picture on prediction markets, which is like a still. And so, you know, like I also get, it's funny, I also get like many pictures on pump competitors and you know, every version. And so like now I understand what Hayden went through when he built Uniswap. Like I didn't understand it, you know, because if you remember when Hayden launched it that everyone wanted to launch their own version of an AMM with a twist. Right? Bancorp was one. Well, although Bancor came before Hayden, but Bancor had the token incentive model where it would pay for the slippage or whatever it was.
00:16:42.311 - 00:17:17.611, Speaker A: Yeah, it was slippage and so that, you know, people that are trading on Bancor would never incur any impermanent loss. And so, but you know, obviously if you look at that model, it turned out to be kind of like a Ponzi. So like these types of like solutions looking for a problem. Right. Like what Hayden benefited from is that he built him and Dan Robinson built something that was very unique that enabled to bootstrap this entire network. Effects of tail end tokens. And so coming in with the consensus idea just doesn't work because they've already put in the work and they're already a year, two years ahead.
00:17:17.611 - 00:17:55.225, Speaker A: From a research perspective, even if you look at the pump guys like what you see today is what they thought about three months ago, four months ago, where they are now, they're already a year to two years ahead. So to compete with them in this kind of consensus level opportunity just doesn't make sense. And so what I tell founders is think about something that hasn't been looked at. And so like the most recent example I can give you is like daos. No one's talked about daos for a very long time and in fact people are shitting on daos. And so we, we talked to a founder. Founder's like, hey, what about daos? I'm like, do it.
00:17:55.225 - 00:18:11.281, Speaker A: That's great. And so he worked on it and we launched Daos Fun a couple weeks ago and it's doing really well. And so I do think non consensus ideas and timing is like the perfect like flywheel for someone to build a great product.
00:18:11.433 - 00:18:34.267, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I gotta check out dao stuff Fun because one of my, I'm probably a very vocal dao opponent. I'm always of the view that okay, nobody should become a dao just because I've been at the trenches with some of these daos. But I don't think anybody should become a Dao unless they hit absolute product market fit and they think that no one can dominate. No, no Faster mover can come. Then they can become a Dao. But maybe that's something I should look into again.
00:18:34.411 - 00:18:36.955, Speaker A: You should. I'll introduce you to the founder. He's, he's good.
00:18:36.995 - 00:18:55.909, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that. And so for consensus ideas, I think part of the reason why people chase them as well is because the market seems to reward them. Like back in defi summer again, any fork of like uniswap just gets instantly bid. So it seemed like an easy way to make money for founders. And I guess it also like self selects for a Certain type of more opportunistic founder. Right?
00:18:55.957 - 00:19:17.109, Speaker A: Yeah, you're. You're absolutely right. I mean, look, I'm not telling everyone the founders are listening on this pod to not to build a consensus idea. Sure. If you have a, an extreme edge against, say, a competitor that's launching and you have a 10x value proposition, go out and do it. Right. But it has to be 10x.
00:19:17.109 - 00:19:22.453, Speaker A: It has to be a game changer. If it's a 5x, 4x, 8x, it doesn't work.
00:19:22.549 - 00:19:37.829, Speaker B: I think that's interesting because you're talking about, like these big improvements. But then you also told founders to focus on small problems first. So help us understand, like, what do you mean by small problem? How do you reconcile that with like a big, big total addressable market, which is the term that VCs like to use. Right.
00:19:37.917 - 00:20:09.875, Speaker A: The perfect example I can give you is something that I went through pretty early, and this is back in the NFT days, if you remember, when NFTs first started to become more popular, buying multiple NFTs was. It was a pain. And so, like, I didn't put a tweet out, but I was thinking to myself, like, I wish there was something that could sweep NFTs. OpenSea wouldn't do it. There was no blur. There was nothing else. And then Gem, XYZ and Genie, they both came out.
00:20:09.875 - 00:20:30.715, Speaker A: I talked to both of them very early on. We were in the same group, chat together, and we're just talking through and they're like, oh, we're going to enable sweeping. I'm like, holy cow. I would totally use you. Use you guys. And so that kind of became like, what Pro is today, right? Blur or Tensor. And so there weren't a lot of people transacting NFTs those times.
00:20:30.715 - 00:21:12.191, Speaker A: It was just like the early, early adopters. And for me, at that point, the big biggest pain point was just like, more tools to acquire and sell NFTs. And they found that as a problem, they built it out and both of them got acquired for 5x within a year, right, by Uniswap and OpenSea. And so that's like a very, like, good example of what I went through and why. I think the only way you could learn about these problems is if you're in the trenches and you actually are making the mistakes that other users are. And that's how you find these problems, these small problems that users go through. For a small group of users.
00:21:12.303 - 00:21:41.543, Speaker B: And I'm curious, like, for, let's say, obviously the 4.5x outcome is amazing. But for founders who want to become like the dominant players, they don't want to, you know, be acquired by a bigger company. They want to become like the next coinbase or. So I'm starting to see this trend that's playing out in Web three that it, it's been playing out in Web two for many years that if you start with a small problem, you end up building a small feature and if it takes off, the incumbents are just going to build their own and suddenly you're screwed. We saw that, I think with like Periscope on Twitter, doing streaming and Twitter just like, nope, go away. And it's happened so many times.
00:21:41.543 - 00:21:50.551, Speaker B: And then the most recent example was like Covid. What was the name of the thing that everybody was doing, like Spaces on before Spaces was a thing?
00:21:50.663 - 00:21:51.439, Speaker A: Clubhouse.
00:21:51.527 - 00:22:08.695, Speaker B: Clubhouse, that's right. Yeah, that's the one. So now it's not a thing anymore because Spaces became a thing. So how do founders avoid that? Like, how do they avoid the binances, the coinbases, the, I don't know, the uniswaps of the world from just turning their product into a feature and then just, you know, killing them, you know?
00:22:09.875 - 00:22:40.421, Speaker A: You know, the mindset I come from is like, okay, so for Genie and Gem, I think they both said, fine, we'll take the money. Right? I mean, you know, for crypto founders, 6 months, 100 mil, whatever it was, you know, it's life changing money for a lot of these people. And so. But there are very few that will push the money away and want to build something very, very big and opportunistic. It could have very well been these two could have become the blur. Right. So it's really kind of like a mindset is the way I see it.
00:22:40.421 - 00:22:43.901, Speaker A: But just moving away from that, talking about small feature.
00:22:44.013 - 00:22:44.349, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:44.397 - 00:23:36.875, Speaker A: So like the reason why I like crypto so much is it's like a dark forest compared to Web2. And what I mean by that is like you could find your footing anywhere, it doesn't matter. You could find and extract something and then use that as a wedge to get into the market and compete against the bigger global players. Who would have thought, like pump a meme coin launchpad could become a competitive threat to like larger amms and exchanges. Right. And so that's kind of the value proposition I see with crypto is that a dark forest? There's so much value that is being left behind, whether it's on the infra side or in the app side. And it just takes someone to pick at it to get their foot in the door and get into the market.
00:23:36.875 - 00:23:52.481, Speaker A: And I think that there's just still a lot left. We haven't even started. There's a lot left, which is what keeps me up at night, because I think there's a lot of things that we could build in crypto today.
00:23:52.593 - 00:24:08.689, Speaker B: So for the founders out there. So I think they get the point now. Okay, we probably shouldn't just chase consensus ideas for the sake of, like, tapping into hype. We should probably find a small problem now. Where should they look like? What is the typical process you've seen with founders in terms of, like, determining what market they should even tackle in crypto?
00:24:08.817 - 00:24:45.955, Speaker A: This is a hard one because, you know, we've tried many market different sectors, and like, some take off, some don't. And so, you know, a part of this is like, you know, when I say I spoke earlier about luck and timing, that also plays a lot into this whole narrative. Like, if you're like, okay, here's a perfect example. Like OpenSea, the founder of OpenSea's Devon, you know this already, but I'll explain it to your audience. But he built the NFT Marketplace in 2017. Nobody came. There was crickets for two years.
00:24:45.955 - 00:25:23.125, Speaker A: They maybe did like a hundred thousand dollars in volume, and then like luck and timing worked out and now they did billions in volume. Right? And that's like the perfect example, right? Like, how much, like, if you're very devoted to the idea, you just have to think about from a Runway perspective, how long can you last before luck plays in your side? And for some, it's three, six, nine months, some it could be a couple years. But then you also have to be flexible in your vision. Don't be stubborn. Meaning like, okay, a year has happened. You only have a year of Runway. You may need to do a hard pivot.
00:25:23.125 - 00:25:30.525, Speaker A: And so these are the types of things that you need to think about as a founder as you're thinking through, like, the market, market structure and sectors that you're going after.
00:25:31.305 - 00:26:00.091, Speaker B: I feel like Poly Market is also another great example because Shane has been building that thing for like so many years, since 2018, and now it's. It's hit a scale that I don't think anybody was even expecting to hit because now it's really become the largest predictions market in the world. And, you know, for four years, nobody cared. Right before the elections came, nobody really used it. So it's pretty insane that the amount of conviction that's required. And I'd love to double click on that because you mentioned that. Okay.
00:26:00.091 - 00:26:33.905, Speaker B: The biggest part is to figure out how much money we have before we run out so that we can make enough space for luck to come in. So, you know, how should founders measure whether they're successful or not? How do they know they've hit product market fit? Because I think you referenced a specific number during your breakpoint. Talk about daus. I'm curious. Like, you know, first of all, just, just remind, just remind users. I think the number was like a hundred or so daus. You said you can basically use them to figure out whether you have product market fit, why that number? And if you don't hit that number within a certain timeframe, what does that mean?
00:26:34.325 - 00:27:22.519, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say like, you know, when you first start, you know, you have, you're solving a small problem for a small group of users. When you have like 50 to 100 DAUs, and that's consistent, right? Like, it bounces from like, you know, 50, like 70, 150, 60. Like you want to see like kind of an upwards trajectory. What this means is that like you've solved a problem and they're telling their friends about, about it. And but if you get to like 50, 60, 70, and then it just comes down to like 20s and tens, then you know that your product isn't compelling enough, it's not sticky, and, and you need to. And so what I call this, and this is famously from the Tensor team who said this, who coined this term, but it's called the leaky bucket problem. And so you have a leaky bucket.
00:27:22.519 - 00:28:03.551, Speaker A: And so you got to figure out where the leaky buckets coming from, where the holes are, and try to fix it. And then you got to go back to a drawing board and look at like what is wrong with the product, you know, and so you do user surveys and try to understand the problems. Why do they churn? Is there a better product that's out there? Are you solving, are you, are you not solving a real world problem? Things like that. So you got to figure out like, where it's coming from and try to patch it up very quickly. You know, Paul Graham said this famously, but he said that, you know, building a startup is like launching and riding the rocket ship at the same time. It's like, you know, you're trying to like, figure out what's going on and how do you fix it if you're not getting momentum.
00:28:03.703 - 00:28:37.039, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think the unique part for that, for crypto founders is a lot of crypto founders would see maybe a leaky bucket and instead of trying to figure out why it's leaking, what they do is they tease an airdrop, they tease a token, and suddenly the numbers started trending up and instead of 100, you get the 10,000 people suddenly coming out of nowhere. So. Well, first of all, what is your view on that using tokens or airdrops as a very early way to maybe bootstrap some demand. And second part, how do you differentiate between mercenary farmers versus actual users?
00:28:37.127 - 00:29:22.127, Speaker A: Yeah, we tell all of our founders to not launch or think of a token. You know, you want to build a great product and you want all the things. All of the lessons I've talked about is without a token, if, you know, mention if you've seen it, there's nothing about a token or airdrop. So it should be out of your purview and it should be really about like meeting the user where they are, like, are you solving a real world problem? Et cetera. And so DYDX did this famously, but they built a product that people wanted. They didn't talk about airdrops or tokens or whatever until towards the end when they had billions of notional volume a month. That's when they airdropped everyone a token.
00:29:22.127 - 00:30:02.955, Speaker A: Right. You're rewarding your organic users, not mercenary organic. Of course you'll have farmers that will farm the product, but really, if you could just build a great product that people want, then it's very hard for you to lose customers. So for those that do it, if you were to do it, fine. But know that you know those users that you have aren't sticky. And eventually when the airdrops stop, people will leave and they'll find something else to farm because this is opportunity cost as the way these users see it. But if you're doing it as a way to build a moat, think about ways to create stickiness in your product.
00:30:02.955 - 00:30:12.085, Speaker A: And I'm not talking staking, I'm talking about like figuring out real world problems that you could solve that will keep those users over time.
00:30:13.505 - 00:30:56.987, Speaker B: I feel like apps are quite interesting in that they're complete opposite of infra, where infra you often launch the coin first. Especially if you're like L1 that needs proof of stake, you need the token. So it's almost like, I don't know if the heuristics you look for, founders who are building infra stuff are different from founders who are building app stuff because, you know, infra founders, they need to be ready to have a, you know, public token community from day one. Basically, if, especially if it's like a proof of stake type of coin. Whereas app founders, they probably don't need to deal with like token holders for years and years and years. So are there specific type of founders that you found that can manage this kind of pressure of having this public token holder base more than, you know, other types of founders?
00:30:57.161 - 00:31:01.675, Speaker A: Yeah. So just going back to your earlier comment about Layer one, L2s.
00:31:03.695 - 00:31:04.023, Speaker B: We'Re.
00:31:04.039 - 00:31:42.835, Speaker A: See, we're also, I feel like I'm curious, I want to hear your thoughts on this. I feel like we're also going through a change with L1 launches. You know, Sui Aptos did their layer 1 token launch and you know they use that as a way to reward builders and incentives and things of that nature. But if you look at like Bear out or Monad and maybe even Mega Eth at this point, a lot of them are really focused on building, getting builders to build on their product first. Right. Even before launching the token. So I feel like we're also seeing a change there and I don't know, I don't know, you know, what's driving that completely because I haven't talked to any of the founders about it.
00:31:42.835 - 00:31:59.725, Speaker A: But it's quite interesting to see like Monad, like and Bera and Mega E, they're all like, they all have startup founders that are like fundraising launching, which is great for their narrative because they actually have like real world builders that are building on those chains. But I do feel like that's changing for the L1 too. Like they have to be differentiated.
00:32:00.225 - 00:32:11.417, Speaker B: I did notice that actually I think those are exactly the three projects that I would point to when I think of this is the new era and probably in my opinion the last generation of infra projects because maybe Story protocol too.
00:32:11.481 - 00:32:13.353, Speaker A: I think there's one more I'm not.
00:32:13.369 - 00:32:54.799, Speaker B: As familiar with Story, but for those three that you mentioned, I think performance wise, you know them and also Fire Dancer, you know, when you're pushing 100,000 to a million transactions per second and maybe sub 100 millisecond latency, there's really not much else on the performance front you can improve to make things more or less future parity of Web2. So next, what do you have to, you know, compete with? After you, you already kind of push performance to the edge. You have to compete with distribution. And I think the founders know that. So now instead of just kind of talking about, hey, how fast, how great our chain will be, they have to show that they have the ability to distribute the developers. And these three are exactly the three Ecosystems that I've seen that understand it. And you really saw that during token 2049.
00:32:54.799 - 00:33:03.535, Speaker B: They're doing so many events for builders and they're not trying to show a token because none of them have a token yet. So it's very interesting. It's very refreshing to see that. Actually.
00:33:03.695 - 00:33:23.845, Speaker A: It's good. I mean, it's a good sign in my opinion. It's healthy, it's good. The question is always going to be, right now the two chains that have the most distribution is Solana and Base. And you know, we'll see. I don't want to get too controversial here, but.
00:33:23.885 - 00:33:54.085, Speaker B: Yeah, no, no, I love controversial thought. But actually that's another question I have is like for founders who are looking at where to build, I've always thought that, okay, on the newer chains that are getting hyped up, it's a little bit noisier because some of the founders are coming because they think they can leech off the hype from this new chain, especially if they build on a different chain. Before didn't work out, now they're trying to latch on a new chain. There are obviously exceptions. So how important of a factor is what the chain the app is on for you when you evaluate startups?
00:33:54.825 - 00:34:27.395, Speaker A: You know, this is like one of those questions that it's very nuanced. It's nuanced because it depends on the developers like knowledge of, of the, of the languages that they're. They're proficient in. It depends on culture. You know, we, we talked a lot about culture and how that perpetuates and use and is being used as a way to grow their developer base. Each one of these layer ones, L2s, I call, we coined the term like, they're like cities. Even Haseeb said this too, actually.
00:34:27.395 - 00:35:29.045, Speaker A: And these cities have their own culture, they have their own food, they have their own, you know, way of living, like Monad. If you look at it, I see people working out in my head memes and like, you know, like those are some of the things I kind of think of right away, right? Mega eth. I think about like hot pot, right? Or you know, like stuff, you know, those hats, like a rock band or something, you know. And so what's the other one? Yeah, bear, obviously bear is like, it's very obvious, you know, with the NFT and the bears. But so all of these have this like very unique DNA. And I think part of it is also you tapping that into what developers kind of connect with right? Outside of the language, outside of the, the the stuff like, like a large part of this is social, social like friendship and connections and, and things like that because they are very sticky. Like if you look at like the, the Solana or the basic groups, there's a very distinct unique DNA about those founders that are building there.
00:35:29.045 - 00:35:51.901, Speaker A: You know, like I think when I think of Salon, I see chewing glass, right. Or things like Pragmatic and you know, things like that. When I look at base, I look at, you know, people that are building for. On chain users and for more developed countries and things like that. So they all have this very unique DNA. So like the infra, it's very hard to do. Like, like you can't sell people on infra, right.
00:35:51.901 - 00:36:05.385, Speaker A: Like it's not something that people can connect with right away, but what you can connect with right away is these unique DNA and this culture is what I call it. So I think that is kind of what we're, what we're seeing in terms of competition right now. And that's how I see founders choosing.
00:36:06.445 - 00:36:31.035, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the funny thing is we recently did an episode with Kyle Somani from Multicoin and he's that one of the things that pissed him off the most was Haseeb's analogy of blockchain tension cities. But I think actually now that you explain it that way, I can see it. I actually never thought about this way. But I do notice different cultures for different founders and different chains. And this is not a thing in Web2 at all. Like you're not going to be like, oh, Java people who code their code base in like JavaScript. They are like more degen and whatnot.
00:36:31.035 - 00:36:40.415, Speaker B: But it's such a uniquely crypto thing that I didn't really think about, you know, how did that come to be? Is it just like a BD teams or self selecting for like same types of people or.
00:36:41.605 - 00:36:54.985, Speaker A: I feel like with crypto, you know, I think it's primarily a token. The token makes the culture, right. The community.
00:36:57.045 - 00:37:02.105, Speaker B: How does that work for Solana for instance? How does Solana token differ from.
00:37:03.885 - 00:37:45.679, Speaker A: I think. Well, I wouldn't say it's just token only, but I mean it's a way to kind of spread the religion, right. And so people have like, you've heard this term like bag holder bias. Like even if you look at the Eth Maxis, the Eth Maxis, they're never gonna leave eat like they'll go down with the fucking Titanic. I mean, but, but that's what religion is, right? And that's. And so a lot of this Is like, you know, your, your, your pillars or what you hold like your values. You're indoctrinated by holding these bags, right? Like you buy the, you buy the bags and you hold it.
00:37:45.679 - 00:38:51.445, Speaker A: You become like depending how big your bag is, you become more maximal as, as your price goes up and the more of your portfolio is, is in that one asset. But like in Solana's case, I think a lot of it is perpetuated also by the leader. Right? Right. And so you have this religion, but then you also have a leader and the leader's DNA like spreads through the community. So like, you know, if you look at Anatolia's example, I think of someone that's an engineer, pragmatic, chews glass, works like 18 hours a day. Like I mean I'm just think, thinking out loud here with you, right? When I see someone like Vitalik, I see a researcher, probably not hands on in terms of engineering, you know, can see the future, you know, things like that, right. And so a lot of the leaders DNA also spreads with the community and the token, right? Because the more people that buy into token, they adopt their leader as their leader for the chain and then that part of that DNA also falls into.
00:38:51.445 - 00:39:35.341, Speaker A: If you're a builder that rubs off on you. And so if you look at like, you know, and you could see this in the products, like you look at the products across the board, there's a very differentiated products set of products that are all building on these different chains. You like blast. Look at blast like blast, like blur, right? Blur. Very hyper speculative, right. Then you have like baseline, then you have, you know, the, as a mega pot. Then you have, you know, I'm trying to think of other products, right? So I feel like there is some shared DNA of the leader, the, the core set of values, the token, the branding, all of that kind of plays.
00:39:35.373 - 00:40:03.265, Speaker B: Into it and how, how important is. Or do you think that turns away people coming from Web2? Because for instance, I've especially like Deepin, there are a lot of guys who are not like crypto natives, right? They're really guys coming from the hardware space who spent maybe past 10, 20 years doing different types of like hardware be telecoms or like satellites and so on. And they come to crypto and they see okay, shit, I gotta adopt these different ideologies to build on like different chains. It doesn't turn them off, you think.
00:40:07.845 - 00:40:40.545, Speaker A: You know, it really just depends. Some just dive right in, some just, they just have a very hard time fitting in. And some like, like I wouldn't Say, like you have to be these types of core set of values. I think I've seen founders do just fine like without it. So it's, it's not something that has to be and like a part of it. Like over time you'll understand the crypto culture and how crypto moves and you start to become more crypto native. I think this is just part of being indoctrinated into crypto at large.
00:40:40.545 - 00:40:48.385, Speaker A: Some people will churn right away, but some see the value and the money and they'll double down on it.
00:40:49.005 - 00:41:08.327, Speaker B: And I like to bring it back to tips for founders a little bit because you've critiqued, I think token launches with very high FTV before. I think you tweeted something about this. So right now for founders who are looking to maybe launch their own token, let's say their product hits product market fit, they want to do a token. What are some more like sustainable ways they should think about for like the token offering?
00:41:08.471 - 00:41:37.273, Speaker A: Man, I tweeted this out like four or five months ago. Like I was like, you know, maybe vesting is the best period. Longer vesting, which was actually a really bad idea. But I think I've come to agreement with Kyle on this one, which, which is still probably very controversial today, which is like just launch a hundred percent of your supply, all the tokens, just launch all of it up front. And then I think what's his name? Celine Capital. Jordy. Is it Jordy?
00:41:37.409 - 00:41:38.165, Speaker B: Jordy.
00:41:38.545 - 00:41:54.005, Speaker A: He said something, he added to that by saying like, maybe offer like selective vesting or selective emissions over time so you can reward users based on certain behaviors. Right. I think that's also interesting to me.
00:41:55.985 - 00:42:21.109, Speaker B: I actually kind of agree with that and I actually think ICOs are also a better way of capital formation. But it was just, you know, with any good things in crypto, it got leveraged by scammers and it got regulated away too quickly. But I think we kind of threw the baby out with the bathwater with that one, like with ICOs. But I definitely see the wisdom in that. Do you think that will ever happen though? Are we going to see a high profile project just go like fully 100% token float on day one?
00:42:21.157 - 00:42:21.865, Speaker A: Noma.
00:42:22.845 - 00:42:23.797, Speaker B: Oh, that's true.
00:42:23.901 - 00:42:50.031, Speaker A: They're doing it. So I'm very curious to see how it works. And there's a bunch of ICO platforms are launching. You know, Echo is doing a great job of doing fundraisers for like middle to larger tier startups. Legion's launching. That's doing more on the earlier side. I'VE probably heard of like 10 other projects that are doing ICO, so they're coming.
00:42:50.031 - 00:43:47.375, Speaker A: I'm actually very, very excited about it because a lot of our founders that, you know, okay, this goes back to my middle point that I made in the middle, which is like, when you build non consensus ideas, investors will not invest outside of like a select few, like tangent, right? And it's because like, you know, and then like, you know, like I'm not talking shit about investors either, but like, you know, investors are, they want to underwrite something that they know will have some sort of pathway for in the future, right? So like before, stable coins were one of those things that people didn't really have an appetite for. But then obviously after the Bridge acquisition, people are like, okay, so this is the pathway. Now we're going to invest. So like all the valuations that were sitting around the 5 to 1012 mil now probably doubled, right? Because now there's demand for it. So I do think that, you know, once we have a pathway for all of this, then we'll see more of a clear picture.
00:43:48.625 - 00:44:16.185, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I hear that as well. And Imran, now for the last part of the interview, I do want to dig into your framework for finding founders to work with, just because you guys have selected so many good founders. So I think the cliche question is like, what makes a successful founder? But I like to ask the other end of that, which is a lot of founders obviously fail, but are there signs that you see in founders that tell you that, hey, these guys are probably not the people to kind of win this vertical?
00:44:20.365 - 00:44:45.433, Speaker A: I think it's like Paul Graham said this in his earlier talk, but being stubborn is good, but being flexible is also in the long term vision is good. So when I give founders feedback, some founders, they'll take the feedback and they stop talking to me. They just don't like bullshitting you. And so for the entire program, they.
00:44:45.449 - 00:44:51.085, Speaker B: Won'T talk to me because they are offended or offended.
00:44:52.665 - 00:45:38.423, Speaker A: Maybe they don't know. Like, maybe I, you know, feedback is a, you know, feedback is one of those things where when you got to have low ego, right? And so it's a lot about like how you, like, I, I, the way I see founders is like, you got to have lawyer, you got to be, you got to like, even like, like you probably experienced this when you launched Block Crunch. And I experienced this when I first came into crypto. But like when I got into crypto, everyone on me for a very, very long period of time, they're like, who is this kid that's coming in? Like, you know, like I would try to get into these VC events and, and they would all look at me like, who are you? And like back then it was actually even smaller. The groups were very small. And so like they would like on me like visibly. And so I would feel bad and leave.
00:45:38.423 - 00:46:19.505, Speaker A: Right. I, what I could have done then is like it, I'll just go back to my job that I had in Tradfi or whatever and then be done. But I decided to stick it out, right. Because I know that this will come. It was Tom Hanks's famous line, this too shall pass, right? It was. And so like that's the way I thought about it and that's how founders should be thinking about is like, you know, if you get on or if things push, like if things aren't going your way, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna leave or are you gonna push back? And, and so what I look for is resilience, E low ego resilience and the ability to push back. Like the founders that I do give feedback to, they push back and they're like, well, I think you're wrong, Imran.
00:46:19.505 - 00:46:45.815, Speaker A: And here's why I'm like, okay, well I still see flaws. And so like the way I see like a good founder relationship is like, like two rocks are going at it. But there's like. And they're polishing something that could be a very well round startup. I think this was Steve Jobs quote. And so like that's what you want. You don't want someone where you push back and then they leave.
00:46:45.815 - 00:46:48.565, Speaker A: And so those are some of the things that the about.
00:46:49.185 - 00:47:24.835, Speaker B: Yeah, I would add that you also don't want someone that you push back and they instantly accept your advice. They're like, yeah, you're right. Let's pivot our entire business to this. Because I'm sure on a cap table, on any given cap table, there's probably like two out of five investors that have very strong opinions and they could be wrong. So you want founders that actually push back. And I've noticed that for very credible founders, especially in like Deepin, if they come with like two decades of experience on the hardware front, if I try to ask them questions or if I push back, I'm just kind of thinking from first principles, they'll be like, well, you're wrong because you know, I've seen this, this, this, this, this. But then if I push back on the token front, which is something they're less familiar with, they'll be much more open minded.
00:47:24.835 - 00:47:46.925, Speaker B: So that kind of flexibility is extremely hard to balance for inexperienced founders. So I found that a good proxy for it is just like people who started companies before, they've been, you know, humbled, they've been humiliated, they had the triumphs. But in the absence of that, how do you figure out whether a founder has that kind of flexibility is just through conversations with them or, you know, how many times do you have to talk to them for you to figure that out?
00:47:47.265 - 00:48:22.595, Speaker A: I mean, it's pretty quick. Like, I mean, like within the first five to ten minutes you could just, maybe it's just that we've been talking to founders so much now, but just have a. But, but like our hit rate is. It's still great, isn't great? Like we have, you know. Yeah, so I don't want to go into numbers, but, but like, you know, like, it's a gut feeling. You talk to them, you look through their, you know, what they've done in the past and just like learning how they think and process information is like the way that I see it. Like some founders come in, they're very cocky and like right off the, like, we were just talking about this yesterday.
00:48:22.595 - 00:48:51.385, Speaker A: We had a founder, I won't name names, but everybody was like wanting to invest in this person or like, wanted this person. And so when we talked to him, he was a dick. He was a dick. And, and I'm like, man, like, I don't want back a founder like that, you know. And so we ended up passing. But it turns out 99% of time, founders that are dicks are. They don't really go that far.
00:48:52.765 - 00:49:26.451, Speaker B: I think. Actually I forgot if it was you who mentioned this or it was an interview that you were doing with, with someone, but they mentioned that you don't have to like all the founders in your portfolio. I actually, I don't know if I agree. Maybe because I'm an independent angel, I invest in whatever the fuck I want. And I, you know, I don't have a mandate to follow, but I really like to invest in people that I feel like can inspire me. But you know, where do you stand on that? Like, do you invest in people that you generally like or is liking them is likability, you know, actually not an important trade?
00:49:26.583 - 00:50:34.631, Speaker A: Like there, there's people with very dry personalities and, and things like that, which is very like, you know, typical, like Silicon Valley, like founder, right. Like you're in the same room and like they just say one word, like talking about and, and you know, Like, I may not connect with this person, but I see his raw intelligence and power and horsepower, right? So I'm like, I'll still back someone like that. What I mean by someone by liking is primarily like, does he have. He or she have a low ego? Can they take criticism? Do they have resilience? Are they humble, like, of their successes in the past? Because if you're not humble and you're egotistical, maniac, and like, if you're trying to recruit a founder or you have, I'm sorry, if you're trying to like, manage employees and you act like a dick to them, what do you think is going to happen? They're going to churn. And so it prevents you from recruiting the best people in the world, which is one of the things that we look for in founders. Founders should be. There's another thing that we look for is like sales, like the ability to sell people.
00:50:34.631 - 00:50:45.647, Speaker A: Like, you need to be able to convince me on a vision because that's the same thing that you'd be using to convince your future employee to join you from like Google or whatever it is.
00:50:45.751 - 00:50:57.791, Speaker B: No, that's very true. I think that's a great note to wrap us up on as well, because that's such an important insight for founders.
