00:00:01.120 - 00:00:35.134, Speaker A: You're now listening to Alpha Leak, a podcast mini series highlighting the most under the radar projects and developments in crypto, and this series is brought to you by the Blockcrunch podcast. I'm your host, Jason Choi. I'm a general partner at Spartan Capital and an active defi angel investor. Nothing on this show should be construed as financial advice, and my guests, myself, and my employer may hold positions and assets discussed on the show. And if you'd like for your project to be featured on this series, reach out to me on Twitter mrjasonchoi. This episode is also brought to you by Periswap and Solana, two of my favorite projects in crypto. Stick around to learn more.
00:00:35.594 - 00:00:36.298, Speaker B: Hey, everybody.
00:00:36.346 - 00:01:21.364, Speaker C: Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, the custody vertical is one of the most overlooked for people, not in the institutional space, in my opinion, but it's one of the most important because this is how the biggest players in the space interact with crypto. And as you guys probably saw recently in the headlines, an institutional digital asset custody solution called Fireblocks raised a whopping $300 million. So this space is definitely growing incredibly fast. And Spartan recently invested in one of the up and coming competitors called Credo, that I'm very personally excited for as well, and they offer a unique, decentralized alternative. So today, I'm really excited to have Brian Spector, the chief product officer from the Credo team on the show, to talk to us more about custody as well as Credo. So welcome to the show, Brian.
00:01:21.524 - 00:01:27.780, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for having me, man. It was good to see you. Always great to put a face to the name, so I'm happy to do it.
00:01:27.972 - 00:01:36.916, Speaker C: Absolutely. Now, before we dive into Credo and the custody space, can you tell us a little bit about your story? How did you stumble into crypto, and how did you get started with credo?
00:01:37.100 - 00:02:14.424, Speaker B: Well, yeah. So it's a long, tangled, not that exciting story. I basically was kind of a math geek in school. I really enjoyed math theory and number theory, as we call it, back in the states. And I had a really good professor who turned me on to this weird little corner of mathematics called cryptography. And this is like going back a couple years before RSA public private key even got put into a Windows server. So it hadn't hit the first wave yet.
00:02:14.424 - 00:03:11.804, Speaker B: And I just sort of read up on the story of Alan Turing and kind of the all the backstory of how much it played an important part in the allies winning the war, and I just got hooked yeah. So I kind of focused on that little corner of dark corner of the mass world, and it was really kind of dark for a while that, you know, I couldn't explain what the hell I did to anybody, you know? What are you talking about? Keys scrambling data. What? Like, I mean, my parents were convinced I was like a nut job. They're like, how are you going to get a job? How are you going to support yourself? This is like just wacky stuff. And when I graduated, I moved up to the Bay area because, you know, that's where you went. And I ended up getting a job with this little company called RSA Data Security. And they were little at the time, so I'm dating myself.
00:03:11.804 - 00:03:43.596, Speaker B: But yeah, they needed like a se basically, who knew about algorithms. So I worked my way into engineering, and I realized there was like the world's worst engineer, possibly maybe number two. And yes. So they put me back in sales engineering. Then I got into product management there. And by the time I left that what was a much bigger 2400 person public company. And yeah, I've just been in enterprise crypto ever since.
00:03:43.596 - 00:04:29.498, Speaker B: So I ran the OEM product line at a company called Encipher, which for a time was the largest HSM manufacturer in the world. So we had tons of clients in defense intelligence agencies and always meeting really strict operational standards. And that's kind of the geeky stuff I like to do. Then I said, okay, well, I'm going to start my own company. And I teamed up with this cryptographer, a guy named Mike Scott, who was one of the leading academic researchers in elliptic curve bilinear pairing cryptography, which probably know a lot about, and this is before, really blockchain, where bitcoin started taking off. It was just kind of right on that cusp. But I was totally entrenched.
00:04:29.498 - 00:05:06.338, Speaker B: And the company I had started with, Mike, was kind of taking off a little bit. And what we did was we had this SDK called Miracle, imaginatively enough named after the company, also called Miracle, and we sold that SDK. It basically sped up like your crypto silicon run times if you were a chip manufacturer. Just like the driest stuff in the world, man. I'm like sitting here going, I'm in my mid late thirties. I'm like, I am wasting my life selling stuff to intel. Look at bitcoin.
00:05:06.338 - 00:05:35.624, Speaker B: And all the crypto engineers working for me were like, we're wasting our lives doing this, man. Sell this company. Let's get out of here. So, yeah, so that's what we did along the way. I met my other co founder, the CEO Anthony Foy, who attempted to buy that company, and I blew that sale up. So that's why he's CEO now and I'm before you, so it's all good.
00:05:37.164 - 00:05:49.720, Speaker C: Yeah, Anthony's a great guy. We really enjoyed our interactions with him as well. And I totally empathize with the point about my parents thinking I'm a nut job just because I'm in crypto full time as well. That's definitely something that rings a bell.
00:05:49.832 - 00:06:18.104, Speaker B: Well, this is crazier because, like, when I. So I got into the patent licensing bit, it's not very popular, but, like, you know, we made a lot of money licensing the RSA patent and catching patent evaders and stuff like that. And I would talk to my parents, they'd be like, so what do you do? I'm like, well, I enforce a patent for an algorithm. So my mom finally gets it one day. She's like, you sell math. You make all this money selling math. I'm like, that's exactly it.
00:06:18.104 - 00:06:30.960, Speaker B: They're like, we don't believe you. You're selling drugs. You're selling drugs. I'm like, no. Oh, my God. Just get over it. Yeah, but they finally came around, like, last year, so it's all good.
00:06:31.112 - 00:06:53.278, Speaker C: Yeah. Especially because this space is taken up so quickly. So I definitely want to talk about that as well. So let's stick into credo, because credo is more than just a custody solution. It also has a couple of different important things, like a L2 element and an exchange layer. But before we kind of dive into the details here, can you help us understand just what credo is and what are the pain points that you're trying to tackle here?
00:06:53.406 - 00:08:02.658, Speaker B: Yeah. So initially, it was basically a roll of the dice that the crypto market, from a regulatory perspective, was going to break one way or the other. And, you know, that's like. But that's what a product guy does, right? Like, they have to kind of see a little bit into the future and, you know, get it right with their crystal ball. Because what really struck me, like, in, you know, when we did exit out a miracle, and I was like, all right, what's the biggest billion dollar problem we can solve here? Right? And I think I was too early in pronouncing this and basically trying to run out this issue. I was probably early by a year, but it just seemed to me, when I had come out of enterprise security, where we were centralizing all the key management, you put your root key in a PKI server, all this other stuff where time and time again, unless you had hardware security and HSM and that thing was nailed down, people were going to find the keys. It's just that simple.
00:08:02.658 - 00:09:36.284, Speaker B: They will find them. And that kind of struck me that knowing that, it just sort of struck me as like, what the hell are these crypto custodians doing? And it's almost seemed like they kind of had the wool pulled over every, everybody's eyes in like 20, 1720, you know, 2018. Because basically the pitch was we can safeguard our crypto keys better than you can safeguard your crypto keys because remember, like, I have to actually send my bitcoin to a crypto custodian, right. And most of these guys were operating, you know, outside of the regulatory framework so they didn't have to buck up five hundred k and deal with the regulators. And, you know, all this other stuff, you know, four or five years ago, that's obviously changed now. But the biggest, I guess, intention and observation that we made that defined the product was there's no, like in a few, basically, the gamble was in a few years, there's no way in hell somebody will send a ton of bitcoin to a centralized custodian when they could actually send it into a decentralized vault, provided that that vault is military bank grade and provably military bank rate. And whats even more interesting is we did this seed round that closed not too long ago.
00:09:36.284 - 00:10:32.004, Speaker B: That was literally the pitch to these strategic investors like Celsius and Derbit and Kronos and Coinbase. We just said, look, if you think the world is going to remain in a centralized custodian or it's going to go decentralized, given that everything else has gone decentralized, there's where you're going to make your bet. And, yeah, and that obviously closed it was oversubscribed. The two best words in the english language, I guess. And a lot of people believe in the vision where we're at right now as a company is that we've got to deliver on that promise. We got a solution out in the market on a shoestring that proved the concept. Now we've got to deliver the real enterprise grade and keep innovating on top of what we have and bring the customers on the journey.
00:10:32.004 - 00:10:46.824, Speaker B: But in a very short time, we have to take all that learning and make another bet on where the market is going. That's the exciting nauseating up at 03:00 a.m. Kind of thing that I love.
00:10:47.524 - 00:11:11.254, Speaker C: Definitely. And we're going to definitely dive into just exactly how Credo is decentralizing its custody. But just for our listeners out there who may not be so familiar with the space, they may have seen names like fire blocks and curve and credo and different headlines, but they may not understand what are the major differences between these different providers. So can you help us maybe break down these key players in this space today and how Credo differs from them?
00:11:11.404 - 00:11:41.202, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, it was never our, it was never our intention to get lobbed in, you know, as a competitor to Fireblocks. It's sort of, we got defined by that, which is also a real lesson for us. It's like, don't let anybody else define you. You don't let the market define you. And I think you'll see us not make that mistake the next time. But for lack of, for better or for worse, you think of like a Venn diagram, right? On one left hand panel, you've got these centralized custodians.
00:11:41.202 - 00:12:12.476, Speaker B: And when I say centralized, what I mean is all their customer information is in a SQL database, literally, or like, you know, MongoDB database. And they. It's in the clear and they know everything and they know everybody. And what basically binds you to the crypto that they're holding on your behalf is an entry in a SQL database that says, Brian owns ten bitcoin. That's it. So a database admin could come along. The government could come along.
00:12:12.476 - 00:13:02.224, Speaker B: If I can get my hands on that database, game over. I don't have to break into their MPC network. I don't have to break into their HSM. It's a lot easier than that, man. Databases are notoriously hard to lock down. Not that I would know how to do that, but I'm just saying, if I were going to do that, that is exactly how I would do it. On the flip side of that, you have L2s like Thor chain and Ren that have seen sort of what we've seen, which is, okay, there's a functional desire for the market to basically have more than just a place where I can park my assets and maybe go from bitcoin to ethereum and back again.
00:13:02.224 - 00:14:23.214, Speaker B: What I believe is actually kind of a bit of an anarchist thought about this market. I don't think the custodian market for crypto is actually going to be around in three years in its current iteration or its current form. I mean, what we have to do as a platform, because we are never going to get a custodian license, right? How do you grant a custodian license to a bunch of decentralized nodes. It's just sort of impossible. But what we're doing is we're enabling custodian, licensed crypto custodians to operate what we call a custodian bot on the network. And they can program in all these rules and basically triggers that govern how their customers can move assets in and out of the custodian framework, the regulated custodian framework that they have in which country they're operating under. That is still going to be a necessary thing, because in most major financial centers, most financial firms that deal with stocks and bonds, when the markets close, they don't custody their own stocks.
00:14:23.214 - 00:15:20.630, Speaker B: I love having these conversations with stock guys and bond guys because you start telling them about the crypto market and they're like, it goes 24 hours a day. What? That's crazy. And, you know, where do you custody yourself? Oh, we just self custody. They like, look at you like, don't say that out loud, man. And it is bonkers, you know, like, a lot of the stuff that we do in the crypto market is just, it is bonkers by any other, you know, guestimation or any other sort of viewpoint when, when we're compared against, like, how the traditional trade fi markets operate. In a way that's great. Like, you know, I'm all for tearing stuff down to rebuild it up better, but in a way, it's also, it leads to its own inefficiencies that we've had here.
00:15:20.630 - 00:16:36.534, Speaker B: And custody is definitely one of those. As a, as a institutional investor all the way down to an individual investor, I don't think you're going to park your money anywhere that isn't giving you a yield and a healthy, juicy one. Right. Because that's the lessons that we've interned from Defi. And why would I just stick my money to gather dust or my crypto to gather dust in a custodian? It's like, okay, well, they can take care of their keys better than I can take care of my keys. Somebody who's investing in Defi, I think, has probably got a good level up on how to at least protect themselves and not be stupid. Where the custody market for crypto is going to go is platforms like us will need to easily onboard the regulated custodians to operate on top of our platform while at the same time with every them and with everybody else, we have to have a series of stacks that enable folks to generate a healthy return based on, you know, their beta, right, their risk profile.
00:16:36.534 - 00:16:41.778, Speaker B: And that's that's where this thing is going to go. It makes a lot of sense.
00:16:41.946 - 00:16:59.810, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I love how you mentioned that for a lot of the custody providers out there, they're really just keeping a list of names and list of private keys on a centralized database and they just map those to each other and that could be exploited. So on that front, what does credo do differently to avoid that type of centralization risk?
00:17:00.002 - 00:17:46.690, Speaker B: Okay, so we, so on version one, we're not decentralized. I want to, I'll just say that upfront, but we're operating all of the components that would make a decentralized network. So we're operating all the validators of a tendermint network. A different team is operating the MPC nodes. Those MPC nodes are spread across the globe, literally in like Chicago, New York, London and a couple other places in Asia. They're in tier four equinix data centers. So if you've ever tried to break into a tier four equinix data center, you know, it's like, it's not a tractable, probably opportunity for you to be successful doing that.
00:17:46.690 - 00:18:39.236, Speaker B: A lot of people have, and, you know, that's just, it's not going to work. We also built our own hsms, as you can imagine, being hardware crypto geeks that we are. Those hsms are fips 142, level three strength. So they've got this tamper resistance. We then dummy proof them with eal, which is a common criteria of specification, five plus little chips that if you try and break into the box, the whole thing starts smoking like mission impossible, so nobody's going to get anything. And the reason we did that is because, and it was a really unpopular viewpoint, by the way. It was like, why you got, you know, I think we had, I can't remember how many VC's told us, like, that's not how you should be doing it.
00:18:39.236 - 00:19:33.674, Speaker B: You need to grow the community, you need to like get organic and let people pick up the nodes. And it's like, oh God, you know, be a grown up. So we wanted to do this because we are going to ask people to run these components, right? Like some major financial players. And unless we have that kind of enterprise experience under our belt where everything is documented down to a t, where everything is bulletproof and the install experience and the deployment experience is top notch, which is what I'm used to delivering. Coming from an enterprise background, you're not going to attract and you're not going to keep the quality of institutions that we want to run validators and to be a permanent part of securing this network. That's why we're going the way we're going.
00:19:34.494 - 00:20:06.154, Speaker C: That makes a lot of sense, and I like how that plays into the trend about progressive decentralization, where the first iteration of the product is centralized, but it has a clear path towards decentralization, which I think is what you were describing there. And I'd like to kind of take a step back as well for listeners who may not be as familiar with some of the more technical terms you mentioned. So you mentioned that credo uses something called MPC, right? Now. Now, I know a lot of our listeners know what a multi sign is, but what is, how does an MPC differ from a multi signature wallet?
00:20:06.614 - 00:21:05.864, Speaker B: So this is going to sound to the, to somebody who's never heard this before, this is going to sound like really kind of bonkers. And I'll explain some what's going on in zero knowledge proof cryptography. And that, that'll, that'll really make you think I'm bonkers, but, okay, so MPC is, stands for multi party computation and literally is what it sounds like. You got, you know, six computers on a network that are all spread across the globe. They're relatively decentralized. And if they all start running this protocol like, hey, Alice, you know, throw me a big prime number that is you, you know, not divisible, and if you throw it over to me, I'll go mod five on it, and then we start throwing other big prime numbers back and forth at each other. And then right at the exact same point, we'll all arrive at a point that what pops out of that protocol run is a public key.
00:21:05.864 - 00:21:53.720, Speaker B: And if we keep running the protocol like all six of us, right, we keep running the protocol for another 10 seconds. What pops out at the end of that protocol run is a signature on a transaction. Assuming that at the end of the protocol run, we all fed the same transaction into our computers, right? So I'm going to repeat that again. Like, you can actually have another process that produces a public key without a private key and produces a signature without a private key. So this is the biggest thing to hit. I mean, it is, it is an earthquake. Nobody knows it's an earthquake, but it is an earthquake because it's the first time since 1970, what, two or three? When.
00:21:53.720 - 00:22:33.474, Speaker B: Well, Clifford, Clifford Cox, our man at GCHQ, actually invented public private key cryptography. GCHQ and their infinite wisdom decided to classify it. So those, those, those guys at MIT took all the glory and the money. Clifford's walking around GCHQ going, like, moaning to himself. I don't know that for a fact. He was really nice when I met him. But anyway, so, yeah, I mean, you know, it is another quantum leap forward from the last quantum leap forward, which is only 40 years ago, we're also undergoing another.
00:22:33.474 - 00:23:35.112, Speaker B: I don't even know, I don't even know how to really describe this in terms of, you know, quantum leaps or, you know, advancements in technology. But the other area that is happening at such a, such a rapid pace that it's really kind of. Some days it makes my head spin is zero knowledge proof cryptography. So when I, when I was at miracle, before we sold out, I was, like, so desperate to have something cool in the blockchain community. Mike and I wrote a zero knowledge proof authentication as a service algorithm. And I've got like five patents and whatever, but it was really cool. For the first time ever, you could prove to somebody, like at a server that I'm holding a private key without showing them the private key and without actually having to sign something and send them a digital signature.
00:23:35.112 - 00:24:16.174, Speaker B: And it was a stronger cryptographic proof than if I had sent them a digital signature. So you've got these kind of twin just sort of vortexes of activity going. You've got an all out sprint and damn the torpedoes effort to get rid of private keys. Because in actuality, as good as public. Private key cryptography was. The downside of private key cryptography is that there's a private key, like, in 40 years, it never got better, right? It was just like. And then when real money started getting attached to private keys, it was like, oh, my God, this place is just turning sour.
00:24:16.174 - 00:25:10.170, Speaker B: We got to get rid of these private keys. And so you had a concerted effort by academia and industry over the last ten years to commercialize this technology and advance it to the point where it's usable, and it is now. So what we did is we took this multi party computation algorithms that were being developed, and we said, okay, let's try and run a really bare bones, like, the most basic version of an MPC network. We're going to do it in production, we're going to build our own hsms. No doubt this will blow up in our face, but let's go for it anyway. And the surprising thing was how stable that architecture has been since we forklifted it up a year and a half ago. It, out of everything else that we've built, has never gone down.
00:25:10.170 - 00:25:50.012, Speaker B: It's never gone down once. And that's. I think that's as much a testament to our own skill as it is to the skill of the guys who wrote that algorithm, Gennaro and Goldfodder. But it also is by virtue of just its design, network protocols are something that, as an industry, as a technology, we know how to handle those. We're not good at shuffling private keys around. So there's that. And then on the zero knowledge proof side, I got to take a break because I'll sound like a lunatic if I tell you what's going on.
00:25:50.012 - 00:26:17.790, Speaker B: That. In that space. But that's the thing I'm most excited about, like, zero knowledge proofs. Obviously, if you're into crypto, you know what a rapid pace of advancement is happening right now. And, yeah, I think it's going to actually transform the blockchain industry and also transform other industries. Storage, telecommunications, you name it. Like, it's.
00:26:17.790 - 00:26:40.374, Speaker B: It is going to fundamentally redefine human interaction, possibly. That sounds like, what the hell is he talking about? But. But I think it is, so. And I'm, you know, I'm only wrong, like, half the time, and. Oh, that makes you feel good as an investor, I bet. But, yeah, you know, the trick is knowing when you're wrong and acting fast.
00:26:40.534 - 00:27:37.494, Speaker A: Now, before I continue, I'd love to share one of my favorite products in crypto with you. Now, whenever I want to trade a token, instead of going to uniswap sushiswap Bancor one x one to see where I can find the best quote, I just go to Paraswap to scan for the best price anywhere, because paraswap aggregates all the popular ethereum dexs and saves me a ton of time and headache in finding where I can trade something for the best price and lets me trade in one place. Now, the cool thing is, theyve also integrated with Ledger live as well, meaning I can now swap at the best prices directly from my ledger wallet. So, seriously, if you are a Defi trader and you're worried about the security risks of centralized exchanges, but you also don't want to scour dozens of dexs just to find the best price, you have to check out Paraswap. So head on over to Paraswap IO blockcrunch. I'd love to also talk about our sponsor, Solana, a high throughput, layer one blockchain. Now, in the past few months, I've probably talked to two dozen teams building exciting new projects on Solana, and this is probably why.
00:27:37.494 - 00:28:11.444, Speaker A: First, it's incredibly fast with 50,000 transactions per second. 2nd, it's cheap with average fees less than a cent per transaction. That means developers can deploy contracts cheaply and also not have to worry about their apps not being composable with others, as Solana does not use any type of sharding or fragmented L2 systems. Most importantly, Solana is censorship resistant with over 950 validators today. So if you're interested in building fast, scalable blockchain applications, or want to test out the existing ecosystem of DeFi applications and more, go to solana.com blockcrunch.
00:28:11.524 - 00:28:43.240, Speaker C: I think it's so exciting how a lot of these more esoteric cryptography related topics are now being commercialized into products that can reach millions and millions of people. And on that note, for people who are not from that cryptography world, when they look into all these different custody providers names that we mentioned, fireblocks, curve and credo, they all seem to be using MPC. So I'm very curious, like, are there certain vectors that you can differentiate on, on your implementation of MPC, or is it very similar across these different platforms?
00:28:43.432 - 00:29:25.994, Speaker B: Um, you know, I think Fireblocks has sharded some of the, um, MPC secrets and given them to a. And given them to customers under sort of this, you know, um, again, like, you know, just smokescreen that. Like, oh, well, this is more secure. It's like, no, actually, dude, like, our NPC network, we would never let the customers touch those secrets that enable that protocol to run. That's just, that's like crazy. You know, you like people that work in like high security areas on networks like NATO. That's crazy to them too, right? You, like, you just, you would never do that.
00:29:25.994 - 00:30:24.534, Speaker B: And I think, you know, given that, I mean, I don't want to talk bad about fireblocks, but there's something going on over there where they lose 75 million worth of BLS keys because they're like on some dude's laptop. And it's just, that's, there's, there is a quality control and a operational control, something that broke over there. You don't get the benefit of MPC, though. Multi party computation, it basically collapses on itself to where it becomes a marketing gimmick because you've got all the usernames in a database, you've got all the amounts that you have custody them in a database. Somebody can just hack in there and change everything. And I don't have to hack into fireblocks MPC network. So that's the big difference to us as we decentralize.
00:30:24.534 - 00:31:38.404, Speaker B: There are those validator nodes that are going to scale up into well over 50 also run MPC nodes. And we're taking advantage of all of the really killer innovations that have happened in hardware security and also in zero knowledge proofs as that is going on to essentially bring the same security confidence and guarantees that we had on our first system, which, you know, is using decentralized components. It's all decentralized, but it's just got people from the same, you know, company operating them, you know, next iteration that won't be the case. They'll, they'll be operated by a lot of different people. But that is where you now get the security, the bulletproof security from, because, like, I now have to, you know, it's game theory. I have to go and collude with at least a couple other validator nodes who got some of those MPC nodes. But it's not as easy as calling my buddy up and go, dude, let's make off with the stuff on the disk and try and run the protocol.
00:31:38.404 - 00:32:35.082, Speaker B: That's actually also where it gets fun, because for a year and a half, we've been sitting there going, if you were me and you had five tequila shots, how would you try? And you only had 30 minutes to make this happen. How would you steal, you know, something, you know, and there's all those safeguards that you'll see, you know, that range everywhere from, you know, they don't know what they're signing to. You know, it's, we're using verifiable random functions and verifiable delay functions and secure enclaves and, you know, all sorts of cold war tactics. I, you know, I've got a russian girlfriend, and she's like, don't go on that show and say KGB tactics. I don't like it when you bring up the KGB. I'm like, all right, babe, I'll say, what do you want me to say? You know, she's like, say cold war tactics. Cold war tactics.
00:32:35.082 - 00:33:13.494, Speaker B: We've got a lot of cold war tactics, game theory built in. But yeah, it's going to be great. It's going to be really a lot of fun, and it's going to be a platform that you can hack at and that series people can run very serious trading operations off of. And, you know, where partnerships can be, you know, very meaningful partnerships can be put together in a matter of minutes, you know, not weeks and months in this industry. So that's another thing that we're going to be, you know, helping to accelerate that makes sense.
00:33:13.534 - 00:33:55.794, Speaker C: And I think people in the industry that are not very technical, they sometimes don't appreciate how hard it is to come up with these different MPC systems and implementations, because, as you mentioned, there sounds like there's a lot of operational things that are related to making sure the system is robust and secure. It's not as simple as, say, just copying some code somewhere and forking it and deploying our own implementation. There's a lot more considerations there that you broke down for us just now. And you also mentioned this point about validators as well. So I want to make sure we address that, because crudo also has its own tendermint based blockchain. So can you explain to us what is that blockchain used for? Where does the blockchain fit in here?
00:33:56.214 - 00:34:51.274, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is the key apex of what makes us unique, I think, on that Venn diagram, we're right in the middle. We're not Ren and we're not Thor chain, because I think we take this security component of what we're doing a lot more seriously because we're going after a more liquid class of customer. And then on the left, you've got fireblocks and copper who are custodians who are using MPC networks themselves. So it's that blockchain that makes us different. So the MPC network has their own secrets, right, that they use to run the protocol and generate either the public keys or signatures on a bitcoin blockchain. That happens when somebody wants to move into the credo network. Like, hey, guys, create me a bitcoin deposit address.
00:34:51.274 - 00:35:26.878, Speaker B: As soon as their bitcoin hits that bitcoin deposit address, they are issued with something called QBTC. It's a synthetic on the credo network. And, you know, I can trade my QBTC with somebody who's got Q ETH, who's got Q algo all day long, right? That just. It's like a. I don't want to say this out loud or over the air, but it's like a. You know, it's like a wallet that would obscure ownership and. But you know, what you have when you're coming out and the.
00:35:26.878 - 00:36:16.194, Speaker B: And the entire platform is solvent at all times. You could take our block explorer, and there's actually like, little kind of stringy sort of graphics that kind of go down to the underlying layer one. So you can see what's, you know, what wallet reports to, what ownership that you have. And that's kind of how we do what we do now. Recording all of that on the layer one is going to be problematic because a, it's slow and you know, it would cost an arm and a leg. So that's why we operate a L2, because it can go really, really fast. But what we're recording is all of those asset rights and those asset rights as they're being traded or forwarded between participants on the credo network.
00:36:16.194 - 00:37:34.564, Speaker B: So in essence it is a digital asset registry and tracking system. Now it doesn't like, it's pseudo anonymous at this point. You don't associate a street identity to it. The next version will be completely anonymous and private. So we'll, you know, there's no way to actually tell who you will be interacting with unless you say, hey, I can't trade with you man, unless you reveal a w three c credential to me selectively. So that is, that's the other way the world is moving, right? You know, I don't want to. I, I want us as an industry to recognize that we have, you know, there are people who have a very firm, intolerable, immovable will with unlimited resources to basically make our lives hell if we don't at least try to come to some terms with them about, you know, how we can make this an adult, you know, at least not like a, you know, the bad news bears kind of, of the financial industry.
00:37:34.564 - 00:38:19.532, Speaker B: And I think the way that we're going to do that is there is a path forward. You know, but oddly enough, for those who are totally decentralized, it's not like you can build a KYC system into your blockchain. Right? That just, that doesn't make sense. So what you actually, I think, you know, if you kind of deep dive into this, what you realize is that in actuality we can't carry any identity information. The only thing we can do is enable people to ask for it and send it and that's it. Right. We're not as a, we're not a participant on our own network, but we have to enable folks to comply with, you know, KYC and Amo.
00:38:19.532 - 00:38:22.064, Speaker B: So that's the road we're taking there as well.
00:38:22.484 - 00:38:46.414, Speaker C: Yeah. And that regulation point, we're definitely come back to that just because it's such a huge topic right now. But just to take a step back, is it correct to understand that whereas for some custody providers, they're keeping track of all these wallets and all these identities on a centralized database, Credo is choosing to store them on their own decentralized blockchain run by a decentralized network of nodes. Is that the right kind of distinction.
00:38:46.874 - 00:39:17.828, Speaker B: That is exactly right, because those decentralized network of nodes are geographically spread out. Right. All over the globe. So there's no, so there's a censorship resistance and anti fragility. Fragility. Sorry, antifragility aspect to this. The last thing you want is, you know, the FCA, you know, if it's not for a good reason, running into your crypto custodian and being like, yeah, I'll have that bitcoin, please.
00:39:17.828 - 00:39:50.430, Speaker B: I mean, the Americans are not, they don't have a really good track record of returning seized assets. You know, it's just, I want to make that, I want to alert everybody to that fact. I love my home country, but, like, you know, we've not done very well in that department. And, you know, and it's, and it's outrageous. It's just outrageous. But, like, they will do that to your crypto if they get a chance at the slightest whiff of something going on. And they don't respect international borders much either.
00:39:50.430 - 00:41:40.984, Speaker B: So you need to think about, all right, well, if I do have to put, if I'm in a financial services firm, where do I actually put my crypto that would be geographically resistant and antifragile and not going to get shut down? And that is your perfect custodian. It's decentralized, right? It is a decentralized custodian with a bunch of different wallets and a bunch of different yield making opportunities. So, you know, I can just park my money in there and some long term, or, you know, get my own dark pool going or, you know, listen to an RFQ bot go out and hit up a bunch of different decentralized exchanges, get me the best price for some weird low volume asset, and then, you know, obviously arbitrage that across, like, four different, you know, players and, you know, all the other usual stuff that is, you know, what that really kind of is, is basically kind of a prime broker for crypto, right. But one that I think will have to. You can't just show up with just money, right. You have to, like the decentralized platform that we're going and the decentralized trading stuff that we're going to build on top of that is going to enable serious hedge funds to operate over a decentralized network just as if they consume data feeds and do complex order routing to folks like tradestation or through tradestation or portfolio management systems. That's what has to happen here.
00:41:41.604 - 00:42:14.394, Speaker C: That makes a lot of sense. And I think the idea of decentralizing custody and also decentralizing. The exchange aspect of it makes a total sense from a security perspective. But also, at the same time, you also see regulators, folks like Gensler coming out and saying that, hey, the core of finance is trust. We need things to be centralized so that we can KYC everyone. We can go after people if things go wrong. So how do you guys kind of reconcile that vision, the need for KYC and some sort of a accountable counterparty versus complete decentralization?
00:42:15.014 - 00:42:48.744, Speaker B: Yeah. So this is the grudging. At first, I was kind of like, this rationalization that I sort of came to on my own was like, okay, that can't be the answer, right? You didn't get the answer. But then the more I thought about this thought, I'm like, actually, this is the answer. And the answer is that if you have a truly decentralized platform, you don't care about Kyc. Right? You don't. You just, like, bitcoin doesn't care.
00:42:48.744 - 00:43:38.432, Speaker B: That. Doesn't care about KYc or Aml. But I'm not. I'm not bitcoin, obviously. I'm, you know, this is my baby, and I want it to be really, you know, successful. So what actually do we need to do? Well, what we need to do is supply and make available to every new wallet creator on the credo network to get KYC and AML in a really rapid fashion by at least three or more of the top worldwide KYC AML firms who will be competing for their business and issuing them out. Decentralized identity credentials, like from the w three and decentralized identity into a credo wallet.
00:43:38.432 - 00:44:18.598, Speaker B: Right. So you may decline getting KYC in AML and come onto the credo network, and it's, like, totally decentralized and censorship resistant. But you're kind of probably find it pretty lonely, right? Because really what it is, is all right, I don't know who just picked up my bid, right. And we could go and complete this transaction without knowing each other, but I would get arrested if I did that. So, like, hey, you know, before we actually do this atomic swap, you need to give. You need to prove to me that you're in the United States. You know, you're got a credential that says you're a man.
00:44:18.598 - 00:44:51.024, Speaker B: It's been so long since I lived there. What is the classification of, like, you know, qualified investor. You know, that you're a qualified investor and, you know, I don't know, you're, you're, you know, not a. Not a felon or whatever, you know, in Europe, you could be like, okay, are you a member of the EU? Check. You know, are you over 21? Check. Are you not, you know, are you british? You know, so. And more importantly, like, really what the regulators want to see is that, you know, you will have.
00:44:51.024 - 00:45:39.114, Speaker B: When somebody gets KyC'd in amls, right? You've got, like, a white list. Literally, it comes down to, like, a whitelist and a blacklist, right? And there's even been innovations in crypto that can handle a ever increasing list like that in a way that sounds bonkers, but they're called accumulators. You can keep dropping these, like, you know, 256 bit strings into these data structures, and they'll, like, kind of whirr for a minute, and then they'll stay 256 bits and like, okay, that was weird. I'm just going to drop another one in there. It'll war for a second. It'll be like, that's 256 bit. But if you walk back up to it and go, hey, man, is Jason a member of this accumulator set? It'll go, yeah, he is.
00:45:39.114 - 00:46:18.024, Speaker B: And it will do that to the end of time. That's not even the craziest thing in zero knowledge proofs, but that's actually an accumulator science. But that's the kind of things that I got back inspired because I was like, I've got to figure out a way using all these killer innovations that are happening to actually make it so that this thing will be decentralized, it will be censorship resistant, and yet it will still be able to fulfill those obligations. And more importantly, it will enable the folks that are getting value out of this to fulfill those obligations. And it does that.
00:46:18.324 - 00:46:30.808, Speaker C: So it sounds like Credo itself will be a decentralized and open network, continue to stay that way. And you're almost delegating the responsibility of KYC and AML to the people who are using the network, right?
00:46:30.976 - 00:46:54.204, Speaker B: Totally, totally. But we will have the best technology, the slickest experience for folks to both issue credentials into a credo wallet and to consume those credentials. So, you know, there will be frictionless, it will be a frictionless workflow, so, you know, we don't affect the rate of business.
00:46:54.764 - 00:47:08.572, Speaker C: Absolutely. And I think the fact that you guys partnered with the largest options exchange in crypto right now, which we're active traders on as well, Darabit also speaks volumes about the type of quality of the product and the gap that it fills in the market today.
00:47:08.748 - 00:47:56.264, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't want to. I've talked with Ola a lot about this. I haven't talked with any other exchange about this, but we kind of have this shared vision of a custody less exchange where customers of the exchange wouldn't send their money into the end of the exchange. They would send it into credo, and it would be basically like a right that is granted by the customer to the exchange. So they become this giant settlement orchestrator. I mean, if you think about it, like, why should a centralized crypto exchange be sitting on all that crypto? I mean, you know, like, I. I didn't know if they felt that way until, like, I.
00:47:56.264 - 00:48:29.156, Speaker B: I talked with Ula, and she's like, oh, it's like, this is the thing that keeps me up at night. Like, you know, we. We spend so much time trying to secure ourselves from, you know, something horrible happening, and, you know, knock on wood, they've. They're really pro, and they, you know, I don't. They've done a great job at securing all that stuff, but there's a lot of people that don't. Right. And I think that's going to be a big issue also in two or three years where, like, you know, the bank.
00:48:29.156 - 00:48:46.244, Speaker B: You know, bank Mellon is just going to not go. They're just not going to, like, hand over 50 million to finance and go, yeah, this. This is great. You know, let's. We'll just send that to your. To your hot wallet then, shall we? It's just not going to. It's not going to happen.
00:48:46.244 - 00:49:54.212, Speaker B: So in order for those entities to, you know, business as usual, something has to give. And I think, you know, if they stopped taking deposits of crypto and focused on what they're good at, right, which is matching engines, speed and network, you know, the liquidity, you know, from here to there, you know, backorder routing deals, all that stuff, which has nothing to do with custody, right. They might be more well served, but, you know, we haven't. We haven't gone out and sang that song to all of them yet in that way, but I think we need to start doing that because I don't see how even those exchanges go for much longer without being told by regulators, like, you can't accept deposits anymore. It's bonkers. Like. Like, I mean, like, it would be like, it would be like Nasdaq, like, oh, yeah, hey, man, send me 50 grand before you can start trading.
00:49:54.212 - 00:50:40.914, Speaker B: I need to see your cash. Send me 50 grand so I can give you that Cisco stock, huh? That's. That's like what? It's like, it's just when you say it out loud, you're just like, this is. This is nuts. And, you know, so, I mean, you got to imagine what, like, you know, some dude at the SEC who's been, like, there 30 years, he's like, what? You know, like, the world must just seem like he's gone mad. So I assume this is, you know, these first salvos of Biden's administration. You know, sneaking a highly explosive, inflammatory, and potentially ruinous bill into the budget, the infrastructure bill.
00:50:40.914 - 00:50:43.234, Speaker B: That's just the first shot.
00:50:46.054 - 00:51:07.704, Speaker C: That's definitely going to be one of the key focuses, even for us as investors in this space. Just trying to see how that plays out. But I think we're coming up on time. Brian, this has been such an enjoyable conversation. Understanding the broad vision for Credo is and how it works. I think our listeners learn a ton as well. For people who want to start trying out Credo today or want to follow up on more news for credo, what are some best resources for them?
00:51:08.084 - 00:51:42.660, Speaker B: Well, I tweet when I'm tired and coding and listening to rock music. It's really kind of nonsense. So you won't find anything out about Credo by going to my Twitter handle. Also, when I was with Prime Minister Cameron, I was really chubby. I've lost a lot of weight since then, so, you know, I'm in fighting shape. The best way to get in touch with Credo is just come sign up. We've got a really lovely onboarding experience.
00:51:42.660 - 00:52:08.614, Speaker B: I think we paid a lot of attention to UI Ux, but I, in particular, I do pay a lot of attention to what goes on in our intercom channels, and I'm known to answer more than a few customer support calls as well, too. That is the best way to get in touch with us, and we would appreciate any and all feedback, and we're happy to talk to customers at any time.
00:52:09.234 - 00:52:09.698, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:52:09.746 - 00:52:09.906, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:09.930 - 00:52:17.714, Speaker C: I'm just noticing your photo with Prime Minister Cameron on your Twitter. So I'll link that in the show notes as well, in case anyone wants to follow.
00:52:17.834 - 00:52:21.130, Speaker B: Yeah, the chubby photo. All right.
00:52:21.162 - 00:52:23.458, Speaker C: Thank you so much for coming on the show, Brian. This has been really fun.
00:52:23.546 - 00:52:25.234, Speaker B: No problem, Jason. Thanks for having me.
