00:00:02.040 - 00:00:03.862, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, gentlemen, welcome to the.
00:00:03.878 - 00:00:08.714, Speaker B: Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto.
00:00:17.214 - 00:00:39.070, Speaker C: And before we get started, just a reminder for you guys out there, the Blockcrunch podcast is intended for informational purposes only.

00:00:39.262 - 00:00:53.114, Speaker B: Today's episode of the Blockcardcast is brought to you by Protocol labs, the guys behind Filecoin. And with me today is Colin Efren, who leads ecosystem at protocol labs. So, Colin, can you give us a brief state of the Filecoin ecosystem today?
00:00:53.454 - 00:01:31.154, Speaker D: So, Filecoin is almost 15 exabytes of storage capacity and 463 petabytes of real storage data. And if you take all of web3 storage protocols, Filecoin powers 99% of total storage capacity and 95% of storage utilization. In 2000, 270 thousand developers were exposed to filecoin through our various hackathon partnerships, and 500 startups are actively building on Filecoin, ranging from series seed funding to series d funding. In aggregate, they've raised about 500 million in capital and continue to grow into 2000.
00:01:31.534 - 00:01:37.486, Speaker B: Hello there. Now, before I move on, I'd love to thank the hundreds of you who have subscribed to Blockcrunch VIP, because with.
00:01:37.510 - 00:01:38.966, Speaker C: Your support, I've been able to share.
00:01:38.990 - 00:02:01.956, Speaker B: My real thoughts on specific projects that I don't usually share on interviews in a format that I enjoy more, which is bi weekly written posts. We've also been able to offer exclusive AMA's, sharing my investment frameworks, interactable models, and breaking down important trends before they become big. Now, we even had Elon Musk comment on one of our threads recently. So if you haven't already, head on over to theblockcrench.com VIP and you can.
00:02:01.980 - 00:02:03.852, Speaker C: Access dozens of hours of research for.
00:02:03.868 - 00:02:14.556, Speaker B: What you'd spend on a coffee a day. All right, hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, recently we have a few asset managers, including some of the largest in.
00:02:14.580 - 00:02:17.452, Speaker C: The world, like BlackRock, applied to create.
00:02:17.508 - 00:02:26.786, Speaker B: Bitcoin spot ETF's in the United States, and it sparked a lot of speculation about whether this could herald institutional adoption of crypto and kickstart a whole new bull market.
00:02:26.940 - 00:02:28.950, Speaker A: However, it's not totally smooth sailing ahead.
00:02:28.982 - 00:02:35.790, Speaker B: As well, because with the SEC already having a history of striking down 33 prior applications for similar products.
00:02:35.902 - 00:02:37.398, Speaker C: And they've also stated that the current.
00:02:37.446 - 00:02:47.262, Speaker B: Batch of applications may lack some key details required for them to be approved. Now, in addition, if you've been following crypto for a while, you know that the SEC is not the biggest fan of crypto as well.
00:02:47.358 - 00:02:49.270, Speaker A: They've gone after two of the industry's.
00:02:49.302 - 00:03:07.846, Speaker B: Most prominent companies recently, including Coinbase and Binance, with lawsuits. So there's a lot to unpack here. And I thought the best person to bring on the show is Ram Alewaliyah, the founder of Lumita, which is a digitally native independent investment advisor. So Ram has been on the show before, and I'm really, really grateful for you to come on the show again. So thanks so much, man.
00:03:08.030 - 00:03:10.594, Speaker E: Thank you for having me, Jason. Always a pleasure to be here.
00:03:10.934 - 00:03:20.514, Speaker B: So let's kick us off by talking about the ETF in general. So why is this spot ETF stirring so much excitement? Like, why is it important for crypto as a whole?
00:03:21.034 - 00:03:28.290, Speaker E: Well, the notable development is that you've got the largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, which manages trillions of dollars.
00:03:28.482 - 00:03:31.570, Speaker F: They filed an ETF, so BlackRock has.
00:03:31.602 - 00:03:34.970, Speaker E: Put their hat in the ring when others have failed.
00:03:35.082 - 00:03:39.354, Speaker F: Now, for context, this is the 28th.
00:03:39.474 - 00:03:48.854, Speaker E: Attempt at a bitcoin ETF. The first attempt was an application filed by the Winklevoss twins back in 2013.
00:03:49.494 - 00:03:55.662, Speaker F: So BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was on Fox Business yesterday.
00:03:55.838 - 00:04:00.862, Speaker E: He was limited in what he could say due to the fact that they're in application now.
00:04:01.038 - 00:04:07.206, Speaker F: But he said, look, our track record speaks for itself. And the BlackRock ETF track record is.
00:04:07.310 - 00:04:10.994, Speaker E: 575 approvals and one rejection.
00:04:11.494 - 00:04:28.606, Speaker B: Yeah. And I'm curious, on that note, given you're in touch with a lot of institutions in the US, do you get the sense that there's a lot of pent up demand for this product? And why can't Blackrock clients today just buy spot or even CME futures or any existing products? Yeah.
00:04:28.630 - 00:04:30.222, Speaker E: So there's clearly a lot of demand.
00:04:30.318 - 00:04:35.862, Speaker F: For bitcoin and digital assets through the convenience of a brokerage account, especially when.
00:04:35.878 - 00:04:37.854, Speaker E: You don't have to pay a high.
00:04:37.894 - 00:04:43.654, Speaker F: 2% fee like you have with the grayscale products, or deal with these discount to Nav issues.
00:04:44.074 - 00:04:50.386, Speaker E: BlackRock and these other potential ETF issuers are commercial businesses.
00:04:50.450 - 00:04:58.610, Speaker F: They have a business case, they have a business plan. They see an opportunity here to bet on further adoption.
00:04:58.762 - 00:05:02.450, Speaker E: Now, the ETF is necessary to transform.
00:05:02.562 - 00:05:09.284, Speaker F: Access to bitcoin into a security format or security wrapper.
00:05:09.474 - 00:05:14.128, Speaker E: When you invest in an ETF that.
00:05:14.176 - 00:05:20.288, Speaker F: ETF will have a mechanism to buy and sell spot using a daily auction.
00:05:20.336 - 00:05:25.824, Speaker E: Process, enlisting the support of various market makers to ensure that there's a balance.
00:05:25.864 - 00:05:32.704, Speaker F: Between the net asset value of the ETF and the value of the bitcoin that it represents.
00:05:32.824 - 00:05:34.320, Speaker E: But the fundamental answer to your question.
00:05:34.352 - 00:05:42.504, Speaker F: Is that you need to have bitcoin in a security format so that it can ride the rails of how brokerage works.
00:05:43.724 - 00:05:53.584, Speaker B: So in order to kind of bridge bitcoin into the broader institutional finance world, this product is necessary. And it's not sufficient to just have what we have right now, which is like CME futures.
00:05:53.924 - 00:05:59.252, Speaker E: That's right. You need a securities filing, you need to have straight through processing, you need.
00:05:59.268 - 00:06:14.064, Speaker F: To have integrations, you need to have a fixed protocol. There's a lot to list, a security to make that work. And an ETF would make bitcoin consumable in the capital markets.
00:06:14.404 - 00:06:52.490, Speaker B: You mentioned earlier that there has been a lot of attempts, 28 attempts before that were struck down already. And I was looking into one of the most recent examples with bitwise. I think SEC rejected them on the grounds of there not being some sort of a surveillance sharing agreement that effectively lets the SEC police manipulation. I think it's a mechanism that lets people, that lets the SEC see who's insider trading and allows them to catch people who are insider trading on current ETF products. And is this something that is inherent to crypto? Given that most venues are global and not licensed in the US, is this going to be hard to find that venue for these ETF's?
00:06:52.642 - 00:06:56.106, Speaker E: It's a great question. So, yes, the common objection that the.
00:06:56.130 - 00:07:15.028, Speaker F: SEC has shared in their very lengthy rejections of these ETF's going on like 90 plus pages, is the lack of a framework for a shared surveillance agreement. And as you said, there are quite a few others that have attempted, including 21 shares on AHRQ, which are first.
00:07:15.076 - 00:07:16.220, Speaker E: In line, by the way.
00:07:16.292 - 00:07:26.356, Speaker F: So we'll learn first there before we learn about whether BlackRock was approved, as well as others, including fidelity, as you said, bitwise wisdom tree nighting, and others.
00:07:26.540 - 00:07:35.956, Speaker E: So a shared surveillance agreement is very common. I know it sounds a bit ominous, and it's really specific to the nature.
00:07:36.020 - 00:07:39.780, Speaker F: Of crypto adjacent, as you pointed out. Let me draw a contrast for you.
00:07:39.932 - 00:07:42.668, Speaker E: So if you have an ETF that.
00:07:42.716 - 00:07:50.556, Speaker F: Trades a basket of securities, let's say the S and P 500, the SPy ETF, which is also issued by BlackRock's.
00:07:50.660 - 00:07:58.138, Speaker E: Ishares business, well, the securities that comprise that ETF, they all trade on exchanges.
00:07:58.266 - 00:08:01.106, Speaker F: Like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.
00:08:01.290 - 00:08:05.706, Speaker E: So you can point to those exchanges. And the reason why that's necessary is.
00:08:05.730 - 00:08:20.698, Speaker F: Because the SEC requires a mechanism to detect market manipulation. And he pointed out several types of behaviors that the SEC wants to detect. One was wash sale trading.
00:08:20.826 - 00:08:24.594, Speaker E: Two is insider trading through the market manipulation.
00:08:24.754 - 00:08:27.898, Speaker F: Fourth would be pump and dump issues.
00:08:28.066 - 00:08:34.774, Speaker E: They want to also be able to identify the actors, too, so they need a detection framework so that the SEC.
00:08:35.194 - 00:08:43.066, Speaker F: Can perform the investigations they need to do. So, bitcoin is decentralized and it makes.
00:08:43.090 - 00:08:46.674, Speaker E: It more challenging, but there's a way to accomplish it.
00:08:46.834 - 00:09:01.656, Speaker F: And what the SEC has said they're looking for is they're looking for a, quote, regulated exchange. Now, we got to come back to what that means in the context of Coinbase and two, a large market participant.
00:09:01.800 - 00:09:04.364, Speaker E: Those are the two criteria they focused on.
00:09:05.784 - 00:09:29.504, Speaker B: I guess that's really interesting to dive into, because most of the liquidity and volume and activity in crypto trading is not on Coinbase. It's on exchanges like binance, which, as you know, the SEC has gone after, and they're not registered in the US. In fact, they've been pushed out of the US. So is it even plausible to think that Coinbase could fit that role as being the provider of this shared surveillance?
00:09:29.804 - 00:09:31.068, Speaker E: It's a great point.
00:09:31.156 - 00:09:34.412, Speaker F: Right. And as you pointed out, 70% of.
00:09:34.588 - 00:09:39.780, Speaker E: The spot market is traded on binance. And of course, perps are arguably the.
00:09:39.812 - 00:09:44.156, Speaker F: Primary instrument that's used to express a view on crypto.
00:09:44.340 - 00:09:46.724, Speaker E: I believe that Coinbase would be sufficient.
00:09:46.844 - 00:09:49.612, Speaker F: There have been cases in the past.
00:09:49.708 - 00:09:55.532, Speaker E: Where us exchanges that did not have dominant market share were approved.
00:09:55.628 - 00:09:57.500, Speaker F: So I believe that is possible.
00:09:57.612 - 00:10:03.508, Speaker E: And also, I don't know that we truly understand the volumes on binance.
00:10:03.596 - 00:10:04.084, Speaker F: Right.
00:10:04.204 - 00:10:06.252, Speaker E: There may be wash sale trading happening.
00:10:06.268 - 00:10:13.104, Speaker F: On binance anyway, so it's hard to really understand. But what you really need is a.
00:10:13.474 - 00:10:18.914, Speaker E: A comprehensive approach to buttressing this kind of shared surveillance agreement.
00:10:18.954 - 00:10:25.234, Speaker F: I had an interesting conversation yesterday with Asaf Meir, who's the CEO of Solidus Labs.
00:10:25.394 - 00:10:36.874, Speaker E: There are three of these software companies that would implement how you do the shared surveillance agreements. And what he was saying is that.
00:10:36.954 - 00:10:43.666, Speaker F: You need to have multiple exchanges that are. Are coordinating, and that would include decentralized.
00:10:43.730 - 00:11:00.850, Speaker E: Exchanges like Uniswap, who, by the way, are cooperating, and as many centralized exchanges as possible. So not just Coinbase, but Kraken and ID lead finance. So if you can put all of that on a silver platter, it seems.
00:11:00.882 - 00:11:07.374, Speaker F: To me that it would be difficult for the SEC to reject an application on the grounds that they've stated.
00:11:07.714 - 00:11:24.066, Speaker B: So the actual candidates that need to work with the SEC here are probably Coinbase, as you mentioned, binance. But what about some of the offshore ones, or more perceived to be chinese ones like OKex, Huawei? Are they expected to cooperate as well? And how likely are they actually to cooperate?
00:11:24.210 - 00:11:26.946, Speaker E: It's a good question. And what I just shared for you.
00:11:27.010 - 00:11:30.466, Speaker F: Is what would be uncontestable if you.
00:11:30.490 - 00:11:34.042, Speaker E: Had the major exchanges and the decentralized.
00:11:34.218 - 00:11:39.602, Speaker F: Exchanges cooperate with a vendor like a.
00:11:39.618 - 00:11:45.562, Speaker E: Slidis labs, and there are two others, then I believe then that's a sufficient.
00:11:45.618 - 00:11:49.274, Speaker F: Standard that cannot be contested by the SEC.
00:11:49.434 - 00:11:54.978, Speaker E: That's a very high standard, though I don't think that's a requirement to have.
00:11:55.066 - 00:11:59.054, Speaker F: Smaller international exchanges as a part of that.
00:11:59.574 - 00:12:22.062, Speaker E: And Coinbase may well be sufficient, too. Now, if you look at the Blackrock application, they're not specific to how they will implement the shared surveillance agreement. They do name Nasdaq, they do name Coinbase, but that's about it. So Nasdaq would be the exchange where.
00:12:22.078 - 00:12:27.508, Speaker F: The ETF is listed. So that's one part of the equation. But you also need to have an.
00:12:27.556 - 00:12:42.464, Speaker E: Exchange like Coinbase that is doing the detection. There's a shot, but the SEC could have a room to say, no, this is not sufficient.
00:12:43.404 - 00:12:57.200, Speaker B: And I guess is that the main thing that you think is impacting the SEC's decision, the existence of a acceptable shared surveillance agreement, or are there other things that these applicants to the ETF should be looking out for?
00:12:57.392 - 00:12:59.128, Speaker E: That appears to be the primary thing.
00:12:59.176 - 00:13:12.120, Speaker F: If you look at the rejections, that is the number one cited reason why these ETF applications are rejected. So I hope that we can get.
00:13:12.152 - 00:13:16.136, Speaker E: The exchanges to cooperate and submit an.
00:13:16.160 - 00:13:20.564, Speaker F: ETF response that would address that issue.
00:13:21.634 - 00:13:24.818, Speaker E: The other, more cynical interpretation is that.
00:13:24.906 - 00:13:28.170, Speaker F: The SEC just doesn't want to approve this.
00:13:28.202 - 00:13:30.978, Speaker E: They will find another reason not to approve it.
00:13:31.106 - 00:13:32.594, Speaker F: Even if you have a shared surveillance.
00:13:32.634 - 00:13:37.722, Speaker E: Agreement, that's just speculation. It's hard to assess that. If you look at it just from.
00:13:37.738 - 00:13:45.610, Speaker F: A due process perspective. You look at, hey, here's an application, here's a rejection from the SEC, here's what the SEC said.
00:13:45.762 - 00:13:49.690, Speaker E: And if you take that on good faith, then the answer to that is.
00:13:49.722 - 00:13:54.334, Speaker F: To have software that will test for.
00:13:54.674 - 00:13:56.494, Speaker E: The items that we discussed earlier.
00:13:57.114 - 00:14:21.564, Speaker B: And this is quite interesting, because for me, as an outsider, I've always been a little bit confused about the SEC's official stance on crypto as a whole, because obviously you had Gensler publicly going after Binance and Coinbase. But then, I think two weeks before the recording of this episode, they also approved a two weeks levered bitcoin ETF. So what do you think? Is the. Is there a political agenda against Crypto?
00:14:21.644 - 00:14:24.260, Speaker E: It's hard to understand what is going.
00:14:24.372 - 00:14:29.532, Speaker F: Inside the mind of chair Gensler. You know, when he says, come in.
00:14:29.548 - 00:14:34.900, Speaker E: And register number one, when he says, when he refuses to answer a direct.
00:14:34.972 - 00:14:49.164, Speaker F: Question from the chair of the US House Financial Services Committee on whether ethereum is a security or commodity, when chair Gensler was previously the head of the CFTC, and third, when he says, we already have digital dollars.
00:14:49.544 - 00:14:53.200, Speaker E: Meanwhile, Singapore and others and Japan are.
00:14:53.352 - 00:15:07.292, Speaker F: Introducing frameworks for stablecoins. And you see that Gensler is backed by the progressive wing of the Democrat party, namely Senator Warren, who is building a campaign on anti crypto.
00:15:07.448 - 00:15:18.484, Speaker E: It's hard not to conclude that there is a political angle here. By the way, now that futures exchange, to your earlier point, the bitcoin futures.
00:15:18.524 - 00:15:24.732, Speaker F: ETF, there, the SEC can say, well, gee, we have a regulated market, and.
00:15:24.748 - 00:15:32.884, Speaker E: They can point to the CME. And now the question will be, is there another objection the SEC can levy.
00:15:32.924 - 00:15:35.508, Speaker F: Which would be that they might claim.
00:15:35.596 - 00:15:37.492, Speaker E: Coinbase is not a regulated market.
00:15:37.548 - 00:15:49.748, Speaker F: Of course the SEC is claiming that Coinbase is an unlicensed securities exchange. So will the SEC fall back on that or not?
00:15:49.916 - 00:16:01.304, Speaker E: That's an open question. Now, even if they were to make that claim, it gets interesting, because bitcoin is definitively a commodity.
00:16:01.794 - 00:16:09.894, Speaker F: So you could say, well, gee, hey, SEC, you have a dispute with Coinbase which is going through a judicial process.
00:16:10.394 - 00:16:27.034, Speaker E: Around whether Coinbase is in compliance with securities laws. But that should have no bearing on Coinbase offering bitcoin. So that should not be relevant to.
00:16:27.074 - 00:16:37.420, Speaker F: Whether Coinbase is permitted to support a bitcoin ETF. That would be the argument, actually, on.
00:16:37.452 - 00:16:58.954, Speaker B: That, given that there's already CME futures, there's even a levered bitcoin product already. Why can't these spot ETF providers just point to these as a precedent and say, hey, you've approved very, very similar products and we have proof that the futures trade very, very similar to spot market. Why can't they just use that as a precedent and apply for the spot ETF?
00:16:59.254 - 00:17:00.782, Speaker E: That's exactly what they're doing.
00:17:00.838 - 00:17:14.974, Speaker F: So Grayscale's suit against the SEC points to the SEC's approval of the bitcoin Futures ETF, and then argues that the SEC is being inconsistent under the Administrative.
00:17:15.014 - 00:17:29.493, Speaker E: Procedures act, which requires regulators to treat like circumstances similarly. So that is the argument. And the SEC is litigating that through the court system.
00:17:30.513 - 00:17:56.528, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. And I think one big question that a lot of people have been asking is obviously this whole idea about a surveillance sharing agreement has been known since very early ETF's were applied for. But all of a sudden Blackrock threw their hat in the ring. And obviously that's a name that most people would recognize. And as you mentioned, the track record kind of speaks for itself. So a lot of people have been asking me, what does Blackrock know? Like why are they choosing now to apply?
00:17:56.696 - 00:17:59.160, Speaker E: I'm so glad you brought this topic up, Jason.
00:17:59.232 - 00:18:02.376, Speaker F: I've been focused on this and I'll.
00:18:02.400 - 00:18:03.200, Speaker E: Show what it is.
00:18:03.312 - 00:18:06.964, Speaker F: My thesis, which is informed talking to various market participants.
00:18:07.824 - 00:18:14.616, Speaker E: Larry Fink and Blackrock see tokenization as the future asset classes are going on chain.
00:18:14.760 - 00:18:24.832, Speaker F: It started with fiat. We call that stablecoins and other assets are inevitably going on chain. Look at the monetary Authority of Singapore, look at Japan.
00:18:25.008 - 00:18:27.604, Speaker E: They're rolling out frameworks for tokenization.
00:18:28.264 - 00:18:32.304, Speaker F: And Blackrock is the world's leading asset manager.
00:18:32.424 - 00:18:35.804, Speaker E: The US does not have a legal framework for tokenization.
00:18:36.304 - 00:18:44.404, Speaker F: So if other markets get ahead of the United States, then BlackRock's position could be threatened.
00:18:45.384 - 00:18:48.202, Speaker E: This is why you'll notice that yesterday.
00:18:48.298 - 00:18:55.614, Speaker F: Larry Fink on Fox business made yet again the case for blockchain and for tokenization.
00:18:56.314 - 00:19:21.222, Speaker E: He also made this point. He said ETF's disrupted the mutual fund industry. And he's saying that tokenization can disrupt how financial markets work. You don't need custodians if the blockchain can provide security guarantees for digital assets. So that's the broader point.
00:19:21.318 - 00:19:29.478, Speaker F: He sees where the future is going. He's trying to preserve the relevance of the United States and Blackrock in a.
00:19:29.526 - 00:19:44.892, Speaker E: World where asset classes inevitably go on. Chain is a message, no question, that he's sending now. Larry Fink is a significant contributor to the Democratic Party and he has created a wedge in the Democratic Party.
00:19:44.948 - 00:19:51.996, Speaker F: He's really split the progressive wing. And the reason why I say that it's a political message on the part.
00:19:52.020 - 00:19:55.764, Speaker E: Of Larry Fink is because the ETF.
00:19:55.844 - 00:20:01.124, Speaker F: Application left certain matters unspecified, including the.
00:20:01.164 - 00:20:03.544, Speaker E: Specification of the software provider.
00:20:04.844 - 00:20:15.454, Speaker F: So it wasn't an a plus homework assignment that they submitted. Now they're going to update that based on the response that the SEC delivered to Blackrock.
00:20:16.874 - 00:20:22.334, Speaker B: And I suppose if this is rejected, those will only be the second rejection they've ever had, right?
00:20:23.354 - 00:20:33.986, Speaker E: Correct. The Blackrock has won 575 approvals. And the SEC has to apply due process, meaning they've got to apply the.
00:20:34.010 - 00:20:34.786, Speaker F: Facts and the law.
00:20:34.850 - 00:20:36.442, Speaker E: If not, you can sue them in.
00:20:36.458 - 00:20:47.574, Speaker F: The same way that grayscale is suing SEC now. So I think this pokes a finger in the eye of cherry Gensler. I think Larry Fink is frustrated.
00:20:47.914 - 00:20:50.410, Speaker E: Clients have demand for bitcoin.
00:20:50.602 - 00:20:56.994, Speaker F: Bitcoin is trading like a digital currency. Major Wall street sell side desks, including.
00:20:57.074 - 00:21:02.374, Speaker E: Bank of America and Merrill lynch. My old shop cover bitcoin and digital assets.
00:21:02.914 - 00:21:21.892, Speaker F: It trades against the US dollar. It's sensitive to interest rates. Larry Fink said it is now an international asset. And then if you look at the inflation rates in Ghana or Venezuela or Zimbabwe, where it's 100% or 300%, bitcoin.
00:21:22.028 - 00:21:26.028, Speaker E: Is an alternative medium of exchange that.
00:21:26.116 - 00:21:35.048, Speaker F: Can help people escape these inflation traps imposed by despotic regimes who want to control a population.
00:21:35.136 - 00:21:39.964, Speaker E: So there's a noble purpose behind that Larry Fink piece.
00:21:40.704 - 00:21:43.312, Speaker A: What are you thinking about his positioning on bitcoin?
00:21:43.488 - 00:21:48.720, Speaker E: Well, I'll weigh in on my own conspiracy theory there. I believe Larry Fink is positioning himself.
00:21:48.792 - 00:21:52.496, Speaker F: To be nominated as the next treasury secretary of the United States.
00:21:52.680 - 00:21:55.136, Speaker E: And the reason why is that if.
00:21:55.160 - 00:22:00.096, Speaker F: You'Re joining the cabinet, then you do not have to pay capital gains, because.
00:22:00.160 - 00:22:02.878, Speaker E: The US government recognizes that to avoid.
00:22:02.926 - 00:22:05.310, Speaker F: Conflicts of interest, you should be permitted.
00:22:05.342 - 00:22:07.590, Speaker E: To sell your interests.
00:22:07.622 - 00:22:25.198, Speaker F: And we saw this previously in the past when Hank Paulson, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, and others, they became treasury secretary. They could dispose of their assets and not pay capital gains. Larry Fink create an enormous amount of wealth creating Blackrock. He's a concentrated stock position in Blackrock. And Blackrock is not growing as much.
00:22:25.206 - 00:22:29.982, Speaker E: As it used to in the past. So, look, he's accomplished an incredible amount.
00:22:30.038 - 00:22:33.444, Speaker F: He's a founder entrepreneur, he's a builder.
00:22:33.604 - 00:22:35.716, Speaker E: Blackrock, 30 to 40 years ago, is.
00:22:35.740 - 00:22:42.268, Speaker F: Something like a series B or a series C company. He's a real force of nature, by the way. He understands the banking system.
00:22:42.396 - 00:22:46.460, Speaker E: He understands tokenization. He invests in innovation.
00:22:46.652 - 00:22:50.516, Speaker F: I would be thrilled to have Larry Fink as a treasury secretary as well.
00:22:50.540 - 00:22:53.188, Speaker E: He'd be great for crypto, actually.
00:22:53.316 - 00:23:00.738, Speaker B: I'm curious, whether the approval or the rejection of the ETF, how does that factor into his potential campaign to become.
00:23:00.786 - 00:23:09.770, Speaker E: A. I think either way, it helps. And it doesn't matter because the ETF is in the headlines now. Look at how the presidential race is shaping up.
00:23:09.922 - 00:23:13.306, Speaker F: The contenders for presidency that are emerging.
00:23:13.490 - 00:23:21.654, Speaker E: Whether it's RFK or mayor of Miami, they're pro digital assets.
00:23:21.994 - 00:23:26.094, Speaker F: So positioning against the current administration.
00:23:26.724 - 00:23:29.184, Speaker E: So Larry Fink is leaning into that.
00:23:29.964 - 00:23:36.548, Speaker B: Yeah. It's really interesting to me how it's become a partisan issue in the US. I don't think that was the case a few years ago. Is that right?
00:23:36.596 - 00:23:38.244, Speaker E: It's become a political issue.
00:23:38.324 - 00:23:40.148, Speaker F: It's becoming increasingly partisan.
00:23:40.196 - 00:23:41.884, Speaker E: I hope it doesn't become partisan.
00:23:42.004 - 00:23:47.624, Speaker F: By that, I mean like a left right split. Larry Fink is a prominent contributor to the Democratic Party.
00:23:47.924 - 00:23:50.276, Speaker E: Larry Summers, who is the former treasury.
00:23:50.340 - 00:23:52.540, Speaker F: Secretary, was on the board of digital.
00:23:52.612 - 00:24:18.920, Speaker E: Currency group, also Democrat, by the way. Jerome Powell, of course, Fed chair approved Diem, which would have been a stable coin offered by Facebook. It was rejected by the current treasury secretary, Janet Yellen. So the people in these roles matter. That was an accident of history. If that stable coin was approved by Janet Yellen, she was the last person on.
00:24:18.952 - 00:24:19.488, Speaker F: Think about that.
00:24:19.536 - 00:24:24.448, Speaker E: It got past the Fed. If that was approved, we'd be living through a different history.
00:24:24.616 - 00:24:26.564, Speaker F: We'd be living through a history where.
00:24:26.864 - 00:24:37.680, Speaker E: These digital apps from Facebook and Twitter and others would enable the use of decentralized, programmable money, including the gaming sector.
00:24:37.872 - 00:24:41.524, Speaker F: To enable payments in app.
00:24:41.824 - 00:24:43.280, Speaker E: And that's why that doesn't happen.
00:24:43.352 - 00:24:48.216, Speaker F: Meanwhile, if you look at South Korea, Japan or China with WeChat and the.
00:24:48.240 - 00:24:51.106, Speaker E: Usage of red envelopes, digital programmable money.
00:24:51.130 - 00:24:52.386, Speaker F: Is already integrated into these apps.
00:24:52.410 - 00:24:55.858, Speaker E: So it's not partisan. It can become partisan.
00:24:55.906 - 00:24:58.974, Speaker F: I hope it isn't. But it's definitely political now.
00:25:00.234 - 00:25:07.714, Speaker B: It's certainly becoming geopolitical as well. Just seeing how hard Hong Kong is pushing crypto and even China, mainland China's pushing for web3.
00:25:07.874 - 00:25:10.778, Speaker E: It's amazing to see that Japan, Singapore.
00:25:10.866 - 00:25:13.394, Speaker F: China and South Korea are running ahead.
00:25:13.434 - 00:25:16.194, Speaker E: Of the US, and that is what's.
00:25:16.234 - 00:25:18.414, Speaker F: Forcing the hand of the United States.
00:25:18.814 - 00:25:24.462, Speaker E: Competition between governments and the desire to.
00:25:24.478 - 00:25:29.342, Speaker F: Be a leading capital market is, I think, ultimately will force the hand of the United States.
00:25:29.518 - 00:25:35.862, Speaker E: Singapore is building an exchange on blockchain. They're leaning into this.
00:25:36.038 - 00:25:41.726, Speaker B: Yeah. And just speaking to peers who are running crypto native funds, a lot of.
00:25:41.750 - 00:25:43.246, Speaker A: Them are going not just setting up.
00:25:43.270 - 00:25:45.312, Speaker B: Offshore entities, but actually moving out of.
00:25:45.328 - 00:26:04.832, Speaker A: The United States just so they can execute on different venues. They're moving to places like Dubai or London. So it does seem like it's. I don't think the crypto native part is big enough to become a geopolitical issue yet, but it's definitely heading there. And from what you're saying, it seems like we're already seeing that play out at the individual level and people at.
00:26:04.848 - 00:26:05.904, Speaker B: The very high level.
00:26:06.064 - 00:26:13.626, Speaker E: Right? And there are practical reasons too, not just international competition. The practical reasons to enable tokenization is.
00:26:13.650 - 00:26:27.426, Speaker F: To create more liquidity and transparency for the financial system. The banks, they've had a drawdown, about six to 8% in their deposits. And banks are traditional buyers of mortgage backed securities. Mortgage rates now 6.5%.
00:26:27.570 - 00:26:29.698, Speaker E: The ten year just broke decisively past.
00:26:29.746 - 00:26:32.658, Speaker F: 4% this morning, a record jobs report.
00:26:32.826 - 00:26:54.990, Speaker E: So you need institutions to buy those bonds. And crypto is this alternative capital market. Look at commercial real estate. Banks need to sell off all the CRE debt, and you can't see them listed on any exchange. There's no loan level transparency. You can tokenize that. Securitization markets today are frozen.
00:26:54.990 - 00:27:09.568, Speaker E: The securitization markets don't offer loan level transparency. That's partly why they're frozen, because you lose trust in the issuer and in the loans, like we saw in 2008. That means buyers, investors step back.
00:27:09.616 - 00:27:13.872, Speaker F: They say, I don't want to buy this, or if I buy it, I'm only going to buy it at a.
00:27:13.888 - 00:27:17.440, Speaker E: Sufficiently high interest rate, which hurts the.
00:27:17.472 - 00:27:20.324, Speaker F: Consumer and hurts small business.
00:27:20.984 - 00:27:37.692, Speaker B: I think that's why a lot of my friends who are working in traditional finance at night, they're fascinated by DeFi. On the weekends you're checking out DeFi, because is the only place in the world where you can see each individual loan and how close they are to liquidation, and you just can't get that level of transparency in traditional finance.
00:27:37.788 - 00:27:42.108, Speaker F: I'm 100% exactly in that camp as well.
00:27:42.156 - 00:27:44.404, Speaker E: Right? A bank is a ledger.
00:27:44.484 - 00:28:00.554, Speaker F: It says who owes what to whom, and that's exactly what an exchange is, and that's what a clearing house is. Banks have broken, risk has become increasingly centralized in big clearing houses like ice, in the wake of the 2008 crisis.
00:28:00.974 - 00:28:09.822, Speaker E: So we needed custodians and clearing houses in the past. But now we have security through cryptography.
00:28:09.958 - 00:28:12.022, Speaker F: And we can settle in a decentralized.
00:28:12.078 - 00:28:15.086, Speaker E: Way, in a way that wasn't available before.
00:28:15.190 - 00:28:22.104, Speaker F: And the purpose for government, as enshrined in the constitution, was to secure pre existing rights.
00:28:22.254 - 00:28:28.260, Speaker E: Now that security can come through cryptography, so there's a new way to manage risks.
00:28:28.292 - 00:28:38.224, Speaker F: We lived through the 2008 crisis. We haven't addressed the issues from that completely. And tokenization is a way to do that, and it advances good public policy.
00:28:38.844 - 00:28:48.896, Speaker B: Yeah, and I suppose if the SEC does approve this ETF product, what does that imply about the whole grayscale case? Because wouldn't they be contradicting themselves, basically, if the.
00:28:49.000 - 00:28:52.192, Speaker E: Yes, exactly. Right. So the Sec is in a bind here.
00:28:52.248 - 00:28:55.844, Speaker F: Right. They've got tremendous amount of pressure from Blackrock.
00:28:56.144 - 00:29:00.328, Speaker E: And if the SEC were to approve it at the same time, you should.
00:29:00.376 - 00:29:09.684, Speaker F: See a nair simultaneous approval for all these other ETF's. The SEC cannot be perceived to be playing favorites.
00:29:10.504 - 00:29:12.240, Speaker E: There's not a special phone call that.
00:29:12.272 - 00:29:14.364, Speaker F: Happened between Blackrock and the SEC.
00:29:14.794 - 00:29:17.834, Speaker E: All that is discoverable if you're sued.
00:29:17.994 - 00:29:35.330, Speaker F: Just like you saw with the Hinman issue, that can come out to the public under discovery. So the SEC is subject to rule of law on pain of being litigated in court. So what I would expect is that if it's approved, you'll see multiple approvals.
00:29:35.402 - 00:29:37.714, Speaker E: At the same time, which of course.
00:29:37.754 - 00:29:43.034, Speaker F: Would create competition for Grayscale, although Grayscale.
00:29:43.154 - 00:29:44.818, Speaker E: Presumably at the same time, would also.
00:29:44.866 - 00:29:48.290, Speaker F: Be approved and then convert that to an ETF.
00:29:48.482 - 00:29:53.298, Speaker E: If it's not approved, I think it's going to be incredibly frustrating.
00:29:53.346 - 00:29:55.330, Speaker F: And part of this is that the.
00:29:55.362 - 00:29:58.254, Speaker E: SEC isn't issuing interpretive guidance.
00:29:58.794 - 00:30:03.762, Speaker F: Coinbase has sued the SEC in a request for rulemaking.
00:30:03.938 - 00:30:05.154, Speaker E: Think about that for a moment.
00:30:05.274 - 00:30:09.538, Speaker F: Coinbase is saying, hey, SEC, we've met with you 30, 40 times.
00:30:09.586 - 00:30:11.202, Speaker E: We're going to sue you in court.
00:30:11.258 - 00:30:15.404, Speaker F: Because we're requesting you, the SEC, to write down rules.
00:30:15.524 - 00:30:21.348, Speaker E: And the last time the SEC updated interpretive guidance was four years ago under.
00:30:21.396 - 00:30:41.264, Speaker F: J. Clayton, before there was nfts, before there was defi, and before there was widespread adoption and product market fit around stablecoins. Now, what interpretive guidance says, it's, you can look it up online. It says, hey, market could be exchanges, generally entrepreneurs, venture capital firms.
00:30:41.934 - 00:30:45.390, Speaker E: If you conduct XYZ activity, we'll interpret.
00:30:45.422 - 00:30:46.390, Speaker F: It in this way.
00:30:46.462 - 00:30:48.790, Speaker E: Meaning if you raise money from the.
00:30:48.822 - 00:30:51.846, Speaker F: Public without a registration and use that.
00:30:51.870 - 00:30:54.238, Speaker E: To go fund a venture, we're going.
00:30:54.246 - 00:30:58.270, Speaker F: To call that an unregistered securities offering and we're going to enforce against you.
00:30:58.422 - 00:31:00.518, Speaker E: That is what the content of the.
00:31:00.566 - 00:31:02.862, Speaker F: Last interpretive guidance statement said.
00:31:03.038 - 00:31:05.118, Speaker E: But there's no interpretive guidance now, including.
00:31:05.206 - 00:31:10.844, Speaker F: Around what is required to have a successful ETF launched.
00:31:11.304 - 00:31:28.804, Speaker B: Yeah, and as you mentioned, the Blackrock obviously cannot have under the table handshake agreements with the SEC, but obviously the banks could talk to each other. So do you get the sense that this is a coordinated attempt from all these banks applying around within the same week? And are they trying to send a political message through this?
00:31:29.424 - 00:31:30.360, Speaker E: It's maneuvering.
00:31:30.392 - 00:31:41.380, Speaker F: So the SEC has to approve the applications and the order in which they are received. And I believe first in line is 21 shares. And then second is ark.
00:31:41.532 - 00:31:43.052, Speaker E: And so the reason why you saw.
00:31:43.108 - 00:31:53.060, Speaker F: Flurry these applications is because they're trying to get into the queue so they can be approved quickly. That's all it is. It is a competitive response.
00:31:53.172 - 00:31:54.424, Speaker E: It's not coordination.
00:31:55.004 - 00:31:59.508, Speaker F: I spoke with the CEO of two of these e two f issuers.
00:31:59.636 - 00:32:01.932, Speaker E: As soon as Blackrock filed their ETF.
00:32:01.988 - 00:32:04.630, Speaker F: Application, all of them studied it.
00:32:04.782 - 00:32:07.038, Speaker E: They looked for the deltas in any language.
00:32:07.166 - 00:32:12.794, Speaker F: Then they copied and pasted the relevant language into their own application and then submitted that to the SEC.
00:32:13.894 - 00:32:24.874, Speaker B: I was speculating that these guys probably had the applications prepared beforehand for a day like this, but I also know that that probably wasn't the case. It sounded like they were actually just copy and pasting.
00:32:25.334 - 00:32:26.502, Speaker F: Yeah, it's not that hard.
00:32:26.598 - 00:32:28.326, Speaker E: These are standardized documents.
00:32:28.470 - 00:32:34.100, Speaker F: What's new here is they specified that they will have a surveillance sharing approach.
00:32:34.212 - 00:32:39.220, Speaker E: They didn't specify the exact method, they didn't name the vendor, they didn't name.
00:32:39.252 - 00:32:43.424, Speaker F: Which exchanges would be cooperating on the contribution of that data.
00:32:44.404 - 00:32:56.664, Speaker B: I'm really curious about this. So based on those two providers that you talked to, how confident are they actually in this being approved, or are they applying because they saw Blackrock apply and they feel like they have to get that first mover advantage.
00:32:57.174 - 00:33:00.314, Speaker E: One said 50 50, which really means they probably don't know.
00:33:00.654 - 00:33:07.126, Speaker F: So the second said unlikely to be approved. So we shall see.
00:33:07.190 - 00:33:09.486, Speaker E: I think as it stands now, without.
00:33:09.550 - 00:33:35.726, Speaker F: The lack of specification of who the vendors are and which exchanges will be contributing, then I do not think it will be approved. The answer will be is when there is a method for the SEC to detect, identify these infractions and the recipe is to have several exchanges, ideally, but.
00:33:35.750 - 00:33:39.782, Speaker E: Maybe not required, as well as Uniswap.
00:33:39.958 - 00:33:43.030, Speaker F: And other decentralized exchanges cooperate.
00:33:43.102 - 00:33:45.414, Speaker E: That is the gold standard.
00:33:45.574 - 00:33:51.964, Speaker F: And if SEC were to reject that, I would. I would find that hard to believe.
00:33:53.064 - 00:34:22.241, Speaker B: And I guess this is probably getting ahead of ourselves a little bit. But let's assume that the bitcoin ETF is approved. Do you think it's going to be? Does it pave the way for Ethereum? Just because from my perspective, it seems actually a lot more difficult for ETH just because there's a lot more volume for actual Ethereum trading on decentralized venues where there's no entities, there's no one you can really go after versus majority of bitcoin doesn't really have any major decentralized exchange presence.
00:34:22.337 - 00:34:25.001, Speaker E: Currently, bitcoin ETF is approved and you're.
00:34:25.017 - 00:34:32.321, Speaker F: Going to see Ethereum ETF's following very swiftly. The fact that Ethereum trades on a.
00:34:32.337 - 00:34:36.649, Speaker E: Decentralized exchange doesn't matter so long as.
00:34:36.681 - 00:34:48.086, Speaker F: Those decentralized exchanges cooperate in a surveillance sharing agreement. You can have an oracle spit out suspicious activity reports per the requirements, and.
00:34:48.110 - 00:34:49.790, Speaker E: There'S a way to make that come together.
00:34:49.982 - 00:34:55.394, Speaker F: So I am excited about what the opportunity of an Ethereum ETF would mean.
00:34:56.454 - 00:35:10.034, Speaker B: And let's zoom out a little bit as well, because you mentioned that there's been 20 plus to 30 attempts before. So with the exception of the fact that Blackrock's involved this time, what is different about this batch of applications versus what came before?
00:35:10.494 - 00:35:13.662, Speaker E: The only addition is this recognition of.
00:35:13.678 - 00:35:20.554, Speaker F: A need for a surveillance sharing agreement. That's one. And then two. Blackrock cited Nasdaq, which is a credible player.
00:35:20.854 - 00:35:26.534, Speaker E: Third, you could argue, well, hey, it's Blackrock. But the merit or the reputation of.
00:35:26.574 - 00:35:31.314, Speaker F: The issuer shouldn't affect the evaluation from the SEC.
00:35:31.614 - 00:35:40.412, Speaker E: The SEC has to test against what are the regulatory requirements like, Jason, you and I could go file for a.
00:35:40.428 - 00:35:57.344, Speaker F: Bitcoin ETF, provided we meet the requirements, the listing standards. We file an application, we have an audit requirement. We specify how we will ensure there's liquidity, how we will have an independent valuation agent.
00:35:58.564 - 00:36:06.394, Speaker E: So it should not be merit based. But the Blackrock brand does create headlines and focus.
00:36:07.014 - 00:36:10.534, Speaker F: So the SEC will treat this with kid gloves.
00:36:10.574 - 00:36:18.646, Speaker E: It's notable, I think, that the SEC, within two weeks, responded to Blackrock with.
00:36:18.710 - 00:36:23.142, Speaker F: A preview of the deficiency that they identified.
00:36:23.318 - 00:36:25.790, Speaker E: They did not wait to come back.
00:36:25.862 - 00:36:32.934, Speaker F: With a hundred page rejection 260 days after the application.
00:36:33.634 - 00:36:41.706, Speaker E: That's an encouraging sign. Right? So the SEC may be responding to pressure in that way where they're trying.
00:36:41.770 - 00:36:46.894, Speaker F: To lay out a path for Blackrock to comply.
00:36:47.514 - 00:36:49.898, Speaker E: We'll see. We'll see. That's hard to parse that.
00:36:49.906 - 00:36:51.254, Speaker F: That's one way to look at it.
00:36:51.834 - 00:37:11.364, Speaker B: And this is wading into conspiracy theory venue a little bit. But there has been a theory that because of Gensler's action against Coinbase and binance, he kind of has to give one to the millennials or the Gen zs and basically approve this. And this is pretty much pre approved and they're just going through the motions. How much credence do you give to that narrative?
00:37:11.824 - 00:37:23.004, Speaker F: That I can say there's a 0% chance. So when these applications are received, there is a process that's applied. There's SEC staff, there are lawyers.
00:37:23.344 - 00:37:25.120, Speaker E: Then the lawyers are watching the lawyers.
00:37:25.192 - 00:37:32.162, Speaker F: They'Re testing for consistency. They have to apply themselves to a.
00:37:32.178 - 00:37:37.210, Speaker E: Due process, and if not, then Freedom of Information act.
00:37:37.242 - 00:37:38.334, Speaker F: You can sue the SEC.
00:37:39.074 - 00:37:46.706, Speaker E: Their reputations are at risk. There are many advocates for digital assets at the SEC today.
00:37:46.810 - 00:37:51.394, Speaker F: Some of them have left because they're frustrated with the SEC's approach to crypto.
00:37:51.554 - 00:37:52.794, Speaker E: But there are quite a few crypto.
00:37:52.834 - 00:37:54.340, Speaker F: Advocates at the SEC.
00:37:54.532 - 00:37:56.044, Speaker E: Again, even then, it doesn't so much.
00:37:56.084 - 00:38:03.772, Speaker F: Turn on advocacy for crypto or not. It just turns on what are the legal requirements to launch an ETF, no more, no less.
00:38:03.948 - 00:38:08.184, Speaker E: The SEC's job is not to weigh in on policy.
00:38:08.924 - 00:38:18.304, Speaker F: The reason why the SEC doesn't have a cabinet seat is because the SEC's job is to enforce the law. It's not about setting policy.
00:38:19.144 - 00:38:24.936, Speaker E: And unfortunately, the SEC's approach today is tantamount to Senate policy.
00:38:25.040 - 00:38:32.964, Speaker F: It's becoming political, but they should simply be applying the laws and enforcing the laws.
00:38:33.624 - 00:38:52.428, Speaker B: I think that's a great note to kind of close us out on, I think, ram, you have helped us clear a lot of the uncertainties that we saw on Twitter, a lot of the conspiracy theories out there now, in terms of the general dates or general durations that people should be looking out for. In terms of how this ETF saga plays out, what are some dates we should be looking out for?
00:38:52.596 - 00:38:54.324, Speaker E: So there's a timeframe where the SEC.
00:38:54.404 - 00:39:06.384, Speaker F: Is required to respond. I believe it's no more than 260 days, or it could be 220 or 260 days. I have it in a thread, you can take a look at it there. I don't recall exactly the date offhand.
00:39:06.684 - 00:39:18.234, Speaker B: Yeah, I will link that thread in the show notes below. I think you've written a lot on Twitter in the past few weeks as well about this topic.
