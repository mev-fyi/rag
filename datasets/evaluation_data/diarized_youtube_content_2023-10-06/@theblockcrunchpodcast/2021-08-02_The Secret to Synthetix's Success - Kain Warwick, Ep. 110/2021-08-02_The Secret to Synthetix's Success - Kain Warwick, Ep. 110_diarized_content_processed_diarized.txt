00:00:00.600 - 00:00:20.274, Speaker A: Decentralized money. This is the only thing that has gained any kind of market adoption possible, that the entire trajectory of technology would have been different. This technology is still really about censorship resistance. Let financial innovations be truly globally accessible that we as a crypto space will onboard millions over the coming years.
00:00:20.654 - 00:01:20.878, Speaker B: Welcome to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast, the show where we break down detailed crypto thesis and projects with prominent founders and investors in the space. I'm your host, Jason Choi. Now, even to the people who pay close attention to crypto, it would seem like the project Synthetix came out from nowhere in 2019 and ballooned into the fourth largest decentralized finance protocol today, with over $500 million in value locked up as collateral on its trading platform. And Synthetix itself is also a very interesting project. So as a user, you would buy their native token SNX and use that as collateral to to borrow synthetic USD against. You can then trade that USD to 40 different synthetic assets on their trading platform, from synthetic ethereum, synthetic bitcoin to gold foreign exchange equities, all without needing KYC or needing to trust any exchange with handling your assets as opposed to centralized exchanges. Now they have really bootstrapped a massive community and generated over $200 million in trading volume since March 2020.
00:01:20.878 - 00:02:10.084, Speaker B: And a lot of other projects have been wondering just what was behind the sudden rise of a project like Synthetix. And actually behind the rise was years of work and experimentation, as well as interesting liquidity mining incentives and community growth strategies. So I'm very excited to bring on Kane Warwick, the founder of Synthetix, onto the show to give us some of their secrets behind how Synthetix came to prominence. We also dive into some of Cain's thoughts about the upcoming competitors in the space, especially with emerging decentralized derivative exchanges built on other high throughput chains like serum proposed by the FTX exchange. So we're going to touch on how Kane views synthetix in the world of more and more decentralized or trustless derivative platforms, and why he's still confident that Synthetix can maintain an incredibly strong mode.
00:02:10.164 - 00:02:12.620, Speaker C: Years into the future. We also talk about some of the.
00:02:12.652 - 00:02:42.436, Speaker B: Exciting things on the roadmap for synthetix, including how they're planning to decentralize into a Dao, a decentralized autonomous organization that governed different parts of the protocol, as well as their plans for L2, and whether they are thinking of building on other chains outside of Ethereum. So this is a very juicy episode with a lot of insights. So I highly recommend that you stay till the very end to listen to what Kane has to say. Now, before we get started, here is a message from our sponsor. Todays episode is brought to you by.
00:02:42.460 - 00:02:45.756, Speaker C: The good folks from Nexo. In this crisis, many investors aim to.

00:02:47.612 - 00:02:52.756, Speaker C: Others seek to maximize the yield on their cash. Nexo allows you to achieve exactly these two goals.
00:02:52.860 - 00:02:55.300, Speaker B: The company offers instant crypto credit lines.
00:02:55.332 - 00:02:58.196, Speaker C: Against all major cryptocurrencies with interest rates.
00:02:58.220 - 00:03:00.772, Speaker B: Starting from only 5.9% APR.
00:03:00.948 - 00:03:02.460, Speaker C: Nexo also lets you earn up to.
00:03:02.492 - 00:03:07.868, Speaker B: 8% annually on your fiat and digital assets. What's more, interest is paid out daily.
00:03:07.956 - 00:03:11.076, Speaker C: That means you can add or withdraw your funds at any time.
00:03:11.180 - 00:03:13.756, Speaker B: So get started today at Nexo IO.
00:03:13.940 - 00:03:45.534, Speaker C: And as a disclaimer, I am a part of Spartan Capital, a crypto assets hedge fund based in Hong Kong. Nothing we discussed is Spartans official opinion, and Spartan and myself may hold assets discussed in the show, but this is not intended to be financial advice. Blockcrunch also has sponsors who make this show possible, and sponsorships are not necessarily endorsements of projects. With that out of the way, let's dive right in. Alright. Super excited to have Kane Warwick, the founder of Synthetix, finally on the show today. So, Kane, welcome.
00:03:45.694 - 00:03:47.394, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks very much for having me.
00:03:47.894 - 00:04:15.304, Speaker C: So, Kane, I've actually wanted you to be on the show for a long time, and in my opinion, you have, hands down, the most interesting origin story in crypto. Because you started off, I think, as a certified tennis coach, you wrote a book on AI, and now you're running one of the largest Defi protocols. But before that, I think we were discussing before we're recording that you sang in a band and you did audio engineering as well. So before we get started, I'm curious about what type of music did you play and what were your biggest kind of musical influences?
00:04:15.804 - 00:04:32.064, Speaker A: Yeah, so it was like an indie rock band in Boston. So you know, bands like the Pixies, Radiohead. Nice, you know. Yeah. Like eighties, nineties, sort of, you know, alternative rock stuff, I guess.
00:04:32.724 - 00:04:48.974, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the best period for rock. And I could spend a whole episode on that. But we've got to dive into synthetics. So now Synthetix has over $500 million value locked now. But for those of us who are not yet familiar, can you maybe give us a little background about how this all started? Just. What is synthetix?
00:04:49.634 - 00:06:01.184, Speaker A: Yeah, so, you know, the project came out of a stablecoin project that went back to, like, late 2016, early 2017, and the idea was to create a payment network that would charge fees for usage and would pay the people who collateralized it. So a slightly different approach to maker, where it was a crypto collateralized stablecoin. But then what we found is that when we launched in 2018, the regulated stablecoins, so true USD, USDC, Paxos, et cetera, were just starting to emerge, which was something that I guess we didn't expect. And we made a decision to kind of accelerate our transition into a multi currency stablecoin. So the idea being that you would essentially have all these different synthetic assets that would all be collateralized by the same pool of value and people would be able to convert between them based on the price of an oracle. So that was kind of how we got there. And then it branched out from there into things like bitcoin and the SDFI index and a whole bunch of different assets.
00:06:02.184 - 00:06:19.564, Speaker C: So would you characterize synthetix as a kind of crypto collateralized, I guess, synthetic asset platform, or would you consider it more of a kind of derivative trading platform? Because I noticed that lately there have been signs that you guys are going into that direction as well, with options, with potentially perpetual swaps and things like that.
00:06:19.984 - 00:06:58.866, Speaker A: So I think it's both. You've got this platform that is somewhat constrained due to the risk profile. So we can't just issue any derivative or any asset. We need to kind of focus on the highly liquid, large cap assets, but there's a range of those. You can do oil, you can do bitcoin, you can do equities, you could do all kinds of stuff that fits that risk profile. But then at the same time, we allow people to exchange between those assets. The protocol enables that.
00:06:58.866 - 00:07:24.934, Speaker A: So it's probably a combination of issuance to support and then the actual exchange of those assets that have been issued. But it's slightly different to things like Uma, for example, where anyone can turn up and sort of construct their own derivative or their own synthetic asset. So different kind of target markets, I guess, between those platforms.
00:07:25.754 - 00:07:42.544, Speaker C: And in terms of finding the user profile for something like Synthetix in the beginning, did you envision targeting traders first, or is this meant to be kind of targeting developers and enabling developers to have different type of exposure on Ethereum as they build up different types of defi protocols?
00:07:43.164 - 00:08:55.254, Speaker A: So I think initially the plan was to build out this payment network, so to really scale out and be able to support a bunch of different fiat currencies. So we went very broad in the early days, so we supported things like KRW, for example, JPY, et cetera. And we didn't really get that much usage in those fiat currencies. The network was not really seeing much activity there. And it wasn't until we launched gold and bitcoin that we started to see genuine organic volume and a bit of product market fit. And so I think that over time, as we've scaled out the different assets that we support, we've kind of leaned into more volatile assets, more trader focused assets, things that people want to be able to trade, but maybe they can't trade it on Ethereum. And what I think that opens up is for people who are maybe building a Defi mobile app that's supposed to replace the legacy financial infrastructure, is they can tap into those synthetic assets and give someone exposure to bitcoin or exposure to gold without needing to leave the Ethereum ecosystem and all of the benefits that that has.
00:08:56.234 - 00:09:17.054, Speaker C: It's pretty amazing that you mentioned there weren't a lot of people trading the initial products, because since March of this year, there's spent over, I think, almost $200 million worth in trading volume on synthetix. So I'm very curious, what are the most traded products today? Is it still the bitcoin, the synthetic gold? Or are you seeing emerging types of assets that people are interested in trading on?
00:09:17.394 - 00:10:11.484, Speaker A: I think as liquidity has grown into and out of the synthetic ecosystem, and as a bit more trust has kind of built up and people have become more comfortable with the platform, we're starting to see the longer tail of assets get adoption. So we're seeing things like the SDFI index, which was recently rebalanced to include a few additional assets, get a lot more trading activity, and a much larger number of holders. I think the SDFI index originally had maybe 15 or 20 holders. Most recently, it's several hundred. So we're starting to see those assets attract a bit more attention, and we think that that will continue to grow as the platform scales out. So it's definitely the more exotic assets that you can't otherwise access on Ethereum. And bitcoin is obviously a great example of that as well.
00:10:12.824 - 00:10:49.844, Speaker C: That's very interesting. And I did notice that in 2019, there was almost a sudden ramp up in total value locked for synthetix, and a sudden growth in interest. And I think a lot of people, when asked to describe synthetix, they would say that it's kind of unexpected, kind of came out of nowhere, suddenly became one of the largest DeFi protocols. And obviously that was reflected in the synthetics, the SNX price as well, which introduced a lot of excitement from the community and introduced more people into the community. So was there one thing that kind of ignited that sudden interest back in 2019, or what were some things that you did to kind of build up the community from ground up?
00:10:50.184 - 00:12:03.738, Speaker A: I think there were two things. I think the narrative of a stablecoin payment network was a little bit challenging for people to kind of grasp, and some people saw the value. And there was this moment in time, in late 2017, early 2018, where stable coins were all the rage. But I think as these other stable coins launched, these regulated stable coins, that narrative was eroded slightly. I think there's still a core group of people that were very excited about a permissionless, censorship resistant stablecoin, but it's definitely a niche audience, the pivot away from this stablecoin network into a synthetic asset issuance platform and derivatives trading platform. I think for a lot of traders and people who are in DeFi, who are here because they like trading, they like speculating, they like to be able to trade all these different assets, it was much more exciting than a payment network. Unless you are deep into the payment space or come from a retail background, you don't really understand the friction of payment networks and why a permissionless one would be so much better than something like PayPal.
00:12:03.738 - 00:12:19.374, Speaker A: So I think the narrative shift was really a big factor, but probably the biggest factor was the change in monetary policy. So when we shifted from a fixed supply token to an inflationary token, that was what really ignited the interest and started the flywheel going.
00:12:20.494 - 00:12:53.424, Speaker C: Yeah. So let's talk a bit more about that monetary incentive, the monetary policy, because one of the things that Synthetix did, I think, in 2019 and continually so today, is offer these incentives in the form of token inflation to bootstrap adoption. So just to clarify for listeners, that means if I use the platform, if I mint these synthetic assets, I get rewarded in the SNX token. So, to my knowledge, this is the first major liquidity mining incentive in DeFi before the current wave. So how did that idea to do something like that come about? And what were some lessons learned from there?
00:12:53.924 - 00:14:02.512, Speaker A: I mean, I think that probably the greatest irony is the fact that it really came for me from bitcoin. So, you know, this idea of paying, which is funny, right? Because the fixed supply, you know, 21 million narrative is like the most powerful narrative out there when it comes to bitcoin. But, you know, bitcoin is, in its own way, you know, kind of inflationary asset. It pays you in the protocol token it's just that we know that there's a finite number of tokens that will ever be issued on the bitcoin network, right? There's only a certain amount of bitcoin that can be mined, but on day one there's zero. And then over the course of the first epoch, obviously there's 100 BTC being issued and then halvenings and what have you. So there was always this idea that there was more bitcoin emerging and being issued over time. And so we looked at that, and particularly I looked at the way that those early incentives influenced behavior and really created this passionate belief in the network.
00:14:02.512 - 00:15:03.464, Speaker A: And we made a decision to essentially just change the number of tokens that would be issued over time from 100 million to 250 million and say, okay, well, 150 million of those tokens that are right now unissued are going to be paid out to people who stake the network, who participate in it, who learn about it. And we kind of expected there would be this huge uproar and backlash, and everyone would freak out about it. But I think what was really interesting is that the only people that were around then were the kind of true believers, the hardcore people who really thought this thing could work. And the fact that we were all of a sudden getting the protocol to pay them for doing the thing that they're already doing and really believing in the network had this huge self reinforcing power. And that was what really started the process going. And people wanting to understand how this worked, taking the time to educate themselves about the network and really building up this core community that is now tens of thousands of people.
00:15:04.804 - 00:15:52.144, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think the synthetics case study is a great example for a lot of projects out there, because in crypto, most of the things that have any sign of quantifiable traction are things related to speculation. And some of the strongest communities are built because the protocol basically made. Well, the project basically made a lot of people a lot of money, and it drew in a lot of people and piqued a lot of interest. And even though some people think that developers shouldn't talk about price, shouldn't focus on markets, that is an essential part of bootstrapping the speculator communities early on in crypto. And I think that's something that synthetix has done incredibly well. So can you maybe just for the people who are not as familiar with how the kind of token inflation work, can you talk about how exactly it works from a user's perspective? What am I getting? And other rewards locked up? And how do those work.
00:15:52.844 - 00:16:51.668, Speaker A: Yeah. So essentially what we said is that. And again, the fact that it came from bitcoin, I used a similar kind of bitcoin approach where we were going to start off with very high inflation and then halve the inflation over the course of four years. Thankfully, one of the community members, a very smart community member of ours, Delta Tiger, came in and fixed that later and changed the inflation policy through an SIP through synthetix improvement proposal to smooth the inflation. But essentially, the inflation is paid out weekly to people who stake the network. So what the synthetix protocol wants you to do is it wants you to take your sNX tokens and it wants you to lock them into the smart contracts. And then mint SUSD, which is a synthetic US dollar, and it wants you to then take that synthetic US dollar and make it available for traders to convert that SUSD into any of the 40 different synthetic assets that the network supports.
00:16:51.668 - 00:17:25.384, Speaker A: And by putting your s USD out that you've minted against your SNX collateral, you are essentially acting as a counterparty to all of the trades that are happening in this network. And you are therefore compensated for enabling the service through fees that the trades generate so directly into the fee pool, as well as this inflation, which is there to bootstrap the network in the early phases when there was very little organic volume, as you can imagine, to now, when we're starting to see genuine volume grow and the network start to scale up.
00:17:26.284 - 00:17:35.864, Speaker C: So it essentially allows retailers to become market makers on the platform and earn really high fees in the beginning to offset the risk. Would you say that's the right characterization?
00:17:36.204 - 00:17:38.224, Speaker A: Yeah, that's pretty accurate. Exactly.
00:17:39.324 - 00:18:30.798, Speaker C: Speaking of market makers and these DeFi platforms, of course, synthetix is not the only project trying to tackle this massive pie that is the derivatives market. There are many other platforms coming soon to market, or platforms that are already live on the market. So we have things like DyDX, which we had on a show before, which is this og order book based decentralized exchange, currently offering bitcoin perpetual swaps. And there are also newer ones, like future swap, where people can trade with up to, I think, 20 x in leverage, and they generated something like $20 million in volume during their alpha. And there are some that are not launched, but will be coming soon, like strike protocol, and one that I believe is launched called McDex. And they're using variations of the AMM design that was popularized by Uniswap. So given that there's so many different types of these kind of trustless derivative exchanges out there and more so on the way.
00:18:30.798 - 00:18:35.234, Speaker C: How do you think Synthetix maintains its edge among kind of increasing competition?
00:18:36.214 - 00:19:45.038, Speaker A: I think the big difference between synthetix and most of the other protocols is that we were able to kind of bootstrap this, a very large collateral pool, up to almost $800 million now in the depths of the bear market. So we've got this monetary premium that has been able to accrue to the s and x token, where people genuinely believe that it's a valuable asset to hold. And the people who are holding it have pretty strong hands. We've been through some very terrible times together, and most of the people who are ogs in the project really get it. They know where the project's going. So we've got this kind of core collateral pool that I think is really strong and has kind of demonstrated that we can support very large trading volume. And so to come in and try and replicate that and create a pooled collateral model is going to take pretty powerful incentives, and I think it's a pretty big moat that we've built.
00:19:45.038 - 00:20:45.126, Speaker A: But I think there's another sort of component which is realistically, all of the different decentralized derivatives platforms that are coming out. There'll probably be ten, maybe by the time we get to the end of the year. When you look at the existing derivatives landscape, even just crypto derivatives, forget about the legacy financial ecosystem. There's a ton of platforms doing a ton of volume, and they're not very differentiated. You know, they've got a customer base that they've kind of built up over maybe the last five years or a couple of years in some cases. And people have different preferences for these different platforms, even with very minimal differentiation. So I think that as all of us kind of pull liquidity and pull volume away from these centralized platforms, as we get to kind of feature parity and then start to exceed them, there'll be a lot of room for a number of different approaches, and it's less about trying to compete for this very small niche category.
00:20:45.126 - 00:20:54.154, Speaker A: Right now, it's about actually going after that 100 pound gorilla in the form of Bitmex and some of the other exchanges out there.
00:20:55.334 - 00:21:43.614, Speaker C: That's very interesting because some of these centralized exchanges are coming into the space as well, and we'll touch on some of that later. But you mentioned the collateral pool as a strong moat, and I'd love to dive into that a bit, because currently synthetix require users to post about 750% collateral before they can trade against the collateral versus say, a margin exchange where you may be able to go up to ten, even 100 x leverage on places like Bitmex. So effectively, you put down one to 10% of your margin to trade versus several hundred percent. So obviously, this model is not the most capital efficient. And some have pointed that this might actually limit synthetix growth in terms of trading volumes. So I'm curious about what your thoughts are on that and what are the future plans to potentially bring this collateral fraction down.
00:21:43.954 - 00:22:58.124, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think the most important point to kind of bring up around that is that you don't need to be an SNX staker to trade. So you can turn up and you can purchase S, USD or any one of the synths from Uniswap or balancer or curve or anywhere, even some centralized exchanges, and start trading. Now, you can't trade leverage at the moment, you can only trade the equivalent of spot synthetics. But in the next iteration of the project and the spec is about to be released, there will be the ability to trade leverage. We like to keep this idea of the stakers, and we have a very high collateralization ratio to provide a strong buffer for the collateral pool to de risk it for traders. But as a trader, you'll be able to turn up, buy $1,000 worth of SUSD, and then take a leveraged ten x 20 x position in a synthetic future contract. So that's going to be something that will definitely shift the protocol and open up a lot of opportunity for much higher volumes.
00:22:59.164 - 00:23:12.396, Speaker C: Now, just to clarify on there, because the total value of all the assets in the synthetix ecosystem is a fraction of its collateral, since it's over collateralized. So wouldn't that limit the value that trades on synthetix?
00:23:12.580 - 00:24:23.234, Speaker A: I mean, it does to some extent, but there are two kind of levers we have to expand the pool of tradable synths. So at the moment, we have around about 70,000,070 or $80 million worth of cents, which, you know, 70 or $80 million in deposits can support a lot of trading volume, especially if you have high velocity assets and leverage. So once you start getting ten x 20 x 50 x leverage on a pool of synthetic assets, that is really only there to do one thing, which is support trading activity. We can support very, very high levels, levels of volume just with that current collateral pool. But then in addition to that, we have the ability to which we just relaunched, let people borrow against ETH to generate, at the moment, synthetic ETH, but eventually borrow against bitcoin to generate synthetic bitcoin and synthetic USD. So we have the ability to expand the collateral pool through other forms of collateral as well as expanding volume through leverage and other levers that we've got that we're planning to pull.
00:24:25.294 - 00:24:42.874, Speaker C: That's awesome. So it sounds like the focus for now is really to grow the user experience and make it feature, kind of achieve feature parity with centralized exchange. And you're less concerned about some of the other kind of new AMM designs or new derivatives exchanges, trustless derivative exchanges that are coming out?
00:24:44.054 - 00:25:35.248, Speaker A: Yeah, that's correct. I think the pie is going to expand for all of us as we kind of improve the user experience on chain. There's no question if you have the same user experience. We're starting to really see that play out now with things like Curve and Uniswap and one inch and the Dex aggregators generating hundreds of millions of dollars with the volume. There's absolutely no question in my mind that an educated user will prefer to use a trustless protocol, all things being equal. So once we can get to that point where all things are equal, and that's not an easy path, we need to fix a whole bunch of things to get to that point, including latency and throughput and scaling. But once we get to that point, there's no question that we've got a better offering because you just remove that need for trust and depositing funds to a centralized exchange.
00:25:35.376 - 00:25:37.152, Speaker B: And this 32nd break is brought to.
00:25:37.168 - 00:25:40.272, Speaker C: You by our sponsor Nexo. With the latest ups and downs in.
00:25:40.288 - 00:25:57.946, Speaker B: The economy, investors need new ways to grow their wealth. Nexo is offering a high yield interest product with up to 10% apy on your crypto, stablecoins and fiat. And you can even borrow cash or stablecoins using your crypto as collateral at rates as low as 5.9%. And there's also the Nexo token that.
00:25:57.970 - 00:26:00.114, Speaker C: Gives you access to various bonuses and.
00:26:00.154 - 00:26:07.574, Speaker B: A dividend that is scheduled soon. So you can learn more about that at Nexoio token. That's Nexo IO token.
00:26:08.304 - 00:26:37.934, Speaker C: That actually brings up a really interesting point, because unlike the centralized exchange front on kind of the Dex ecosystem, most of the volume is driven by spot. Dexs like Uniswap like Curve, rather than kind of derivatives like I guess, DyDx Synthetix for now. Do you think eventually the Dex base will play out the same way as decentralized exchange base where derivatives are a multiple of spot? Or are there unique factors that make spot trading in a deck setting more, I guess reasonable than trading derivatives.
00:26:38.754 - 00:27:27.834, Speaker A: I think at the moment it's just architectural limitations. We've only just, in February of this year, gotten to the point where we were able to solve front running to a point where we felt comfortable lowering fees. And even now, that's still, the lower the fees are, the easier it is for people to attempt to front run the oracles. So there's a number of things that we need to do to fix that. So I just don't think we've really, other than doing, like, off chain order matching and other things, we don't really have the architecture in place to directly compete with a bitmex or a Darabit or FTX, etcetera. We're close. We're not too far away now.
00:27:27.834 - 00:27:42.394, Speaker A: We're probably three to six months away, but it just hasn't been possible until now. So it's no surprise that you're seeing things like, you know, uniswap and curve explode with volume, but not yet seeing the derivative space kind of follow along. But it will come.
00:27:43.774 - 00:28:24.044, Speaker C: Yeah. And speaking of these architectural limits, one thing that I thought was amazing was the synthetix demo on optimistic roll ups. So just to offer some color for our listeners, synthetix not too long ago launched a demo using optimistic rollups, which we covered in a previous episode, which is a L2, a scaling solution to basically build a near instant settlement exchange. And when I was trying out the demo, it felt exactly like a centralized exchange. It didn't feel like I didn't really know that I was using a Dex. Now, that was obviously a demo, but I'm curious about what the roadmap is for that. When is that coming out? And what was the decision process behind picking optimistic rollups as the scaling solution to go?
00:28:24.504 - 00:29:01.034, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, wouldn't we all love to be living in an ovm world today? I'm sitting here looking at gas prices of, like, 55 guys right now. So it would be very nice if we could just snap our fingers and move into that reality. But there's a lot of things that need to kind of come together. So we're working really closely with the optimism team that's formerly the plasma group to get the next kind of phase of this. So we did the demo. It was super successful. The UX was amazing.
00:29:01.034 - 00:29:52.074, Speaker A: And the next step is get to a sort of pseudo main net, which is something that we're working really closely with the team to kind of launch. And I think probably what we'll start off with is trying to take some of the load off of the staking side of the equation, maybe not even trading first. It might start with staking, which at the moment, the cost of staking and the cost of transactions within synthetic, so, you know, minting, burning, claiming, is extremely high. It can be, you know, $1015 per claim, which makes it really hard for smaller SNX holders to justify, you know, staking and claiming. And so hopefully, moving over to l two will alleviate some of those concerns and allow us to kind of, you know, get one step closer to Mainnet. So we're working really hard. It's probably, aside from synthetic futures is probably my top priority.
00:29:52.074 - 00:29:54.094, Speaker A: It's the thing that I think about the most every day.
00:29:55.034 - 00:30:05.882, Speaker C: And how far away is this technologically? Are we talking about a two, three year type of development needed to bring optimistic rollups truly to mainnet for synthetics? Or is this kind of shorter term?
00:30:06.058 - 00:30:09.214, Speaker A: It's probably closer to months than years at this point.
00:30:09.754 - 00:30:45.794, Speaker C: Got it. Got it. And speaking of scaling solution, obviously, one of the headlines that caught a lot of attention last week was the centralized exchange FTX announcing that they're building serum, which is this new Dex protocol built not on Ethereum, but on Solana, a high throughput chain. Solana is also a project that we covered back in 2018, so listeners can definitely go back and check that out. But bringing it back to the Defi context, do you foresee more DeFi projects moving to other chains as they start to notice the effect of high guest costs and users? And have you considered moving synthetix to other chains for scalability reasons?
00:30:47.604 - 00:31:29.066, Speaker A: We considered moving to EOS and in fact, went through probably six month planning phase of deploying simultaneously. So the idea was to deploy in parallel to eos and Ethereum back in the day. One of the dumber things that I've done in my life, definitely, and I've done a lot of dumb things, but that was definitely up there. Top, top five, I would say. Say. So, you know, we kind of went through our phase, and, you know, this was also back, you know, kind of before DeFi was starting to really do as well as it is now. And, you know, when it was really difficult to kind of get attention and resources and awareness from users.
00:31:29.066 - 00:32:08.984, Speaker A: So, you know, we, we thought that it was a good play, but it turned out, you know, the ecosystem there in terms of tooling for developers was just way too immature. It just wasn't even possible to contemplate deploying something with the complexity of synthetics onto eos at the time. Maybe that's changed. I don't know, we haven't really paid too much attention. But, you know, it's something that I think a lot of people underestimate. The amount of different tools and the breadth of tools and depth of tools that exist on Ethereum for engineers is, you know, it's not perfect by any stretch, but it's pretty incredible, and it gets better every single week. And so that's a competitive advantage.
00:32:08.984 - 00:33:24.714, Speaker A: That aside from all the things that we talk about around composability and collateral value and all the stable coins are on Ethereum and all of these other advantages, I think the developer tooling and the ecosystem that has been built on Ethereum is really, really hard to compete with. Even if you start with a blank slate and build from scratch, there's just a lot of kind of things that you don't anticipate that engineers are going to need that require time and effort and experimentation and iteration to kind of resolve. And so, absolutely, I think people can kind of move onto a new chain and try and start something from scratch. And there's going to be challenges with that composability, etcetera. But I think one of the hardest things is going to be to kind of build up that tooling that it's Ethereum has now to really support the kind of grassroots development effort, things like what we see with Andre and Wifi and projects like that that can spin up, pull contracts from Synthetix and pull some stuff from various different projects and kind of wrap it all up and deploy it really easily onto Ethereum. I think it's going to take a while before any other chain is going to be able to compete with that level of, of developer tooling.
00:33:25.934 - 00:34:00.094, Speaker C: Yeah. And intend to agree with the point about composability, about how all of these DevOp protocols can pluck into each other and rely on the work built by other teams, and rely on the reputation and security that's maintained by other teams to build their own protocols. Now, at the same time, with the transition of Ethereum to Ethereum 2.0 to a new kind of sharding environment, there are a lot of open questions about can different shards talk to each other efficiently? How would it look like from a UX project perspective? Are these concerns that you have right now, or are you fully confident that the Ethereum ecosystem will figure this out?
00:34:01.514 - 00:34:54.054, Speaker A: I mean, I'm not confident in our own ability to figure out all the problems that we need to solve just for different synthetics. Right. So, you know, there's, there's no question there's uncertainty there's no, there's no question that there's execution risk. You know, there's execution risk across all of crypto in every single project, in every single thing that we're all working on. It's still highly experimental and there's a lot of unsolved problems for us. I think the main focus is on ETH one x right now. And so getting the current Ethereum that we have, combined with a L2 scaling solution that is as close as possible, EVM compatible, that supports all the smart contracts that we have, that will let us get to a ten x or 20 x and 30 x scalability improvement, which will buy us enough time to let the e 2.0
00:34:54.054 - 00:35:07.354, Speaker A: roadmap play out. So there's no question over the next two years, it's on us to really get the l two stuff going and support those teams while we wait for the rest of the roadmap to play out on the e two side.
00:35:08.454 - 00:35:39.994, Speaker C: So it sounds like the tension currently is completely not related to other chains or Ethereum 2.0, but very much focus on scaling volumes currently. So on that note, I've also noticed that there are a lot of new products that are launched in Synthetix to really kind of offer more things for people to trade on and scale up the volumes on the platform. And one of those things is binary options on different altcoins, which I really haven't seen on any other platform so far. So can you maybe talk a little bit about that? What is the design behind that, and what has the traction looked like so far?
00:35:40.494 - 00:36:26.900, Speaker A: Yeah, so there were a couple of interesting things that we wanted to test out with binary options. So the first was creating something that didn't add incremental risk to the existing debt pool. So as it stands now, as an SNX staker, you're the counterparty to every trade except within the binary options space. So we still use a pooled collateral model. It's just that it's a pooled collateral model within each market that's siloed. And that was something that we wanted to test out, because at some point, while leveraging this undifferentiated debt pool is really powerful and allows us to spool up liquidity quickly for any new asset, there's trade offs there. We wanted to test off the design space and see what those trade offs look like on the other side.
00:36:26.900 - 00:37:23.718, Speaker A: And we've been pleasantly surprised that even if you get things right, it's the right market at the right strike price, with the right kind of timeline in terms of maturity, etcetera, we've seen a lot of interest. So one of the most interesting markets was the chainlink market that was launched right after we released binary options. And I think there was something like 150 or $200,000 worth of volume traded on that market, which for a market that was less than a week old and a feature that was less than a week old, was pretty impressive. There's still some things that need to be fixed up and some improvements that I think can be made. But one of the other really nice things is that it's a purely market driven approach. So it is genuinely permissionless. Anyone can come and create a market on any one of the supported assets with any strike price, any maturity, put their own parameters in.
00:37:23.718 - 00:37:50.914, Speaker A: And the person who creates the market is sort of responsible for seeding the initial liquidity and bootstrapping it. And what we've seen is that I think we've had over 200 markets created now, which has been super exciting to watch these market creators come in, test out different approaches. So there's still a lot of work that needs to go into that. But early signs are really promising and people are really enjoying playing with the binary options markets for sure.
00:37:52.814 - 00:38:20.334, Speaker C: I'm curious, because now, if you look at other projects that have tried to go with this, anyone can come in and start a market and collateralize that market type of model. Things like Augur V one, those have really struggled to pick up volume, and the liquidity is really fragmented across hundreds of markets, single digit type of volume. So what is synthetix doing differently to make sure that that doesn't happen? That in the binary options market, we don't have a huge fragmentation of volume or liquidity.
00:38:20.834 - 00:39:17.842, Speaker A: I think one of the things is that, you know, SUSD's primary reason for existing is to be a trading asset. It's not like Dai, where, I mean, Dai obviously, leverage on ETH, et cetera, is a big driver, but it hasn't been a big part of the narrative. And I think with SUSD, the point of SUSD is really there to drive trading volume. And so I think a lot of the people who are large SUSD holders, the opportunity cost of. Of holding s USD is pretty low when it comes to trying out a new protocol component or trying out a new feature within the exchange. Because other than putting it into yield farming, there really isn't much else that SUSD is designed to do. It's designed to be converted into different synthetic assets, whether those are binary options or know, synthetic bitcoin or whatever.
00:39:17.842 - 00:39:50.078, Speaker A: People want to do with it. It's a very low kind of barrier to entry. And I think you've got a big community, as I said, of tens of thousands of people, all of whom hold a lot of SUSD and have a lot of collateral in the network. And so you've got this kind of captive audience that's ready to kind of jump in and try out any new feature or, you know, any component that's released, which is something that is a huge mode. It's really hard to replicate that in a new project that is starting tomorrow.
00:39:50.126 - 00:40:40.984, Speaker C: For example, speaking of the use cases for S USD, one thing that I really like about synthetix is that not only are you guys writing all the contracts, but you guys also vertically integrate and build the UI for people to trade on the synthetics exchange to manage their synthetic holdings on the minter platform. Now we're also starting to see other teams come in and add more use case to the SUSD. So one of the projects that has been circling around the Defi circles and currently on Testnet is a project called Dhech. And it's an asset management platform where people basically trade on the Synthetix exchange, and other people can invest in these different funds that trade on the synthetics exchange. Are you seeing more signs of these kind of vertically vertical, the integrated companies built on top of Synthetix? And if so, what are some of the most exciting projects you've seen there?
00:40:41.314 - 00:41:51.750, Speaker A: I mean, dhedge is definitely one. There's some other cool stuff that people are working on, but I think it's really only been in the last three to six months that we've had a level of scalability and stability that people have felt confident betting their entire project on Synthetix and building on the protocol. You can have amazing features and all of these cool systems in place, but if people don't trust it, then they're not going to build on it, because the platform risk is such a huge risk to take when you're building a new project or a new startup. And so I think we've only gone to the point now where people feel comfortable putting a lot of effort into it. And so we're seeing different projects that are now much more interested in integrating SUsD, integrating synths. And one of the ways that we're going to help facilitate that is we're about to launch a volume program where people who do a direct integration of synth exchanges are paid like a volume rebate on that trading volume. So that's something that's going to be announced hopefully in the next two or three weeks.
00:41:51.750 - 00:42:12.494, Speaker A: And so, you know, platforms like one inch that do direct synth integrations, you know, some wallets that do direct synthetic integrations are going to be able to essentially generate a revenue stream from doing these direct synth integrations, which I think is going to only accelerate this process of seeing more projects integrate with Synthetix and build out new use cases on top of it.
00:42:13.354 - 00:42:16.922, Speaker C: And is that going to be financed by token inflation? Or are they getting a cut of.
00:42:16.938 - 00:42:54.494, Speaker A: The actual fees that will come from initially the synthetixdao? So synthetixdao has a decent sized treasury that it will use to kind of fund that for the first three months. And then based on the results from that, then either we'll allocate more funding towards it to continue on in the future, or potentially put it out to the community to implement some protocol level incentive to drive this. But I think in the near term, it's something that the synthetix Dow feels pretty comfortable funding and is a good sort of use of funds and a public good to drive more awareness and. And adoption.
00:42:55.954 - 00:43:46.750, Speaker C: It's great that you touch on synthetic style because that's definitely something that I wanted to dive into. But as we come to the kind of final part of the interview, I would love to get your thoughts on synthetix in the context of the wider defi movement. Because this year we've seen the massive growth of DeFi protocols. And we see massive pools of capital, hundreds of millions of dollars. I think the total is almost three, $4 billion right now locked up as collateral for lending, for borrowing, for options, for insurance, and in your case, for trading as well. Now, there are some that are trying to extrapolate this to, you know, 510 years out, right? And they're trying to think that maybe all of these pools of collateral will converge and we'll end up actually with a few large, prime brokerage type of protocols that offer collateral for all of the above. And the other camp thinks that we still have, you know, dozens of protocols having various feature specific things backed by their separate pools of collateral.
00:43:46.750 - 00:44:00.734, Speaker C: I'm curious about what your thesis is on this. If you have to think, almost on the Sci-Fi level project out to 510 years, where will DeFi be? Will we still see these massive pools of collateral separated? Or is it more going to be a winner takes all type of game?
00:44:01.354 - 00:45:13.964, Speaker A: I mean, it's really interesting because there's a number of dynamics at play. One is lower barriers to entry. We've never had a financial system with lower barriers to entry than what we see in DeFi today. Literally, someone can turn up, self educated, have read some blog posts and start building stuff that would have, 1020 years ago, cost hundreds of millions of dollars and taken years to build with huge teams and funding required. I think that if you let that thesis of low barriers to entry, extremely hyper efficient competition with, you know, maybe not as much lock in and, you know, kind of difficulty, you know, low switching costs, etcetera, you know, difficulty to kind of lock people in to your particular system because it's a closed system that they have to exist in. It feels strange to kind of assume that there's going to be this, you know, black hole of liquidity that's going to pull everyone into the same protocol. Maybe there's just some kind of inevitability of that.
00:45:13.964 - 00:46:01.684, Speaker A: But personally, my hope is that we see more competition, lower barriers to entry, and a proliferation of different protocols with maybe hyper focused niche audiences that they're enabling to do very specific things. It'll be interesting to see it play out. There's no question. If it goes the way of traditional finance, then, yeah, it's going to aggregate to maybe four or five massive protocols that support a range of different things. But my hope is that it goes the other way and that we have a much wider range of very specific protocols that are all in competition with one another, and we see very market driven, competition driven innovation.
00:46:02.824 - 00:46:37.844, Speaker C: That's definitely my hope as well. I think it would be a shame if everything is controlled by one contract and one project and one set of contracts. So definitely love to see that vision you mentioned play out. Now, Ken, as we come to the final part of the interview, recently, the plans for Synthetix Dao have been announced, and this is a great way for the community to take part and take a very active role in governing the future of Synthetix and really take an active role in addressing many of the things that you've discussed on this podcast. So can you talk a little bit about what is synthetic style and what is the roadmap for this, and how can people participate?
00:46:38.624 - 00:47:20.334, Speaker A: Yeah, so, you know, what we're trying to do. And synthetix has a habit of doing weird things, you know, not necessarily like the norm, cut and dried. I mean, we do some dumb things like creating foundations and stuff. That is the norm. But, you know, we do try to experiment and do, you know, different, take different approaches to things where we can. And I think in this case, what we wanted to do was to not just create one monolithic DAO with five people in it that control every single function in the protocol. That just didn't seem like the right approach and didn't seem like the right way to iterate and experiment.
00:47:20.334 - 00:48:13.250, Speaker A: Initially, we launched the Grantstow, which was responsible for public goods funding. We launched the protocol DaO, which doesn't handle any kind of financial aspect, just is there to kind of manage the actual protocol governance and upgrades. And then the synthetixdao, which manages the treasury, which is obviously transitioning away from the legacy foundation and responsible for sort of funding the overall progress of the network. And so what that then allows us to do within those three Dallas is have much more flexibility and openness to experimentation. And I think the really important thing here is we're trying to open up all of these daos progressively to more community ownership and involvement. So already the grants DaO has more community members than it has core contributors. And the protocol DaO will go the same way over the next three to six months.
00:48:13.250 - 00:48:54.464, Speaker A: Hopefully we'll introduce more community control there. And you're particularly adding token holder veto powers and a number of incremental improvements to engage the community. But I think all of this is pushing in one direction, which is essentially to say that it is absolutely, and everyone's feeling this in deFi, there's so much going on, you cannot possibly keep abreast of every innovation that's happening. And that's true even down at the micro level of synthetics. It is impossible for me to stay across every single thing that's happening in every aspect of the protocol. I just can't run it. It's too wide, it's too fast moving.
00:48:54.464 - 00:49:49.476, Speaker A: Delegating these things out and allowing these emergent, self governing little nodes to take specific things, like, for example, the refresh of the SDFI index that happened with almost no involvement of the core control contributors. That was a purely community driven effort. Things like modifying their monetary policy. So allowing, when there's a specific problem that pops up for a set of people to tackle that problem, address it, bring it to the community, having reviewed it, and try and make the right change and make the right decision, allowing these kind of emergent governance structures to bubble up to the surface. There is absolutely no way that a hierarchical, multilevel organization is going to be able to compete with that level of specialization and flexibility. So ultimately it's all about pushing in that direction and allowing that to emerge. And we're seeing that across different protocols.
00:49:49.476 - 00:50:22.614, Speaker A: We're seeing it with compound, we're seeing it with Aave Kyber there's more and more of this community driven, deep analysis of very specific problems that pops up. Maybe it happens for two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, where you've got this team of people that's really looking at a problem, and then they present the solution to the community. The community ratifies it, it's implemented, and then that coordination group is unwound and goes back out into the community. So those are the types of things that we're really trying to facilitate.
00:50:23.954 - 00:50:35.784, Speaker C: That is exciting, and I can't wait to see how this turns out. So for people who want to get involved or to keep up to date with some of the things that you mentioned, what would be the best channels for them to follow you and synthetix?
00:50:36.444 - 00:50:58.054, Speaker A: Probably the synthetix discord is the best place to kind of, you know, if you really want to immerse yourself. But the synthetix Twitter account, my personal Twitter account, I'm sure you can link to those in the tagline or whatever are good places to follow for the latest announcements and my general shit posting that you get from me.
00:50:59.634 - 00:51:11.762, Speaker C: Absolutely. I would definitely include those in the show notes. This has been an amazing discussion. We learned a ton about the vision for synthetix and synthetix in the context of the wider defi movement. So thank you so much for coming onto the show, Cain. It's been a pleasure.
00:51:11.898 - 00:51:13.834, Speaker A: Thanks, Jason. Yeah, it was really fun. Had a good time.
