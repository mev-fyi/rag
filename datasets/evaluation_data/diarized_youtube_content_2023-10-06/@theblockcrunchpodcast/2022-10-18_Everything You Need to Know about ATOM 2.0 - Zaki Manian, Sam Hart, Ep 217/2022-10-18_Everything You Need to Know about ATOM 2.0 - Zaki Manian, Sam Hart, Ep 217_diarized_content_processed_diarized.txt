Now, before we get started with today's.
00:00:41.112 - 00:00:42.760, Speaker B: Episode, I've got some great news for you.
00:00:42.832 - 00:01:26.196, Speaker C: Now, a lot of you have been asking for how I analyze projects that I bring on the show. That's why I decided to create Blockchain's vip to share with you all the heavy research that goes on behind the scenes. Now, every week or so, our team prepares an in depth research memo with things like sector analysis, technical concepts made simple, in depth competitor breakdown, and even interactive models so you can learn about the most important projects before they become important. And our team is putting in hours every week, scouring discord, Twitter, forums and blogs to help you get an edge in crypto and understand the latest projects and themes at the deepest levels. That goes way beyond just an interview. Now, in addition, we'll also host exclusive AMA's with myself to answer any of your questions. So all of these are only available to blockchain's VIP subscribers.
00:01:26.196 - 00:01:38.144, Speaker C: And the good news is that while our interviews will always be free, the vip tier costs less than one coffee a day. So head on over to theblockfrench.com VIP or click the link in the show notes below to sign up.
00:01:39.564 - 00:02:20.614, Speaker A: Alright, hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, I'm really, really excited for this episode because Cosmos is one of the largest ecosystems in crypto and to date, there are 200 plus blockchains, or app chains building with the Cosmos SDK or with tendermint, which is Cosmos consensus engine. However, there has been a longstanding discussion on Cosmos token, which is atom and its ability to capture the value that it has really created for crypto. So recently, a hugely ambitious plan called atom 2.0 has been announced just last week to change all of that. So with me today are two ogs from the Cosmos ecosystem, Zaki and Sam, to help us break it all down. So welcome to the show, guys.
00:02:20.614 - 00:03:03.584, Speaker A: Thank you so much for coming on. Definitely. Now, just to get us started, I remember when I first read about Cosmos, maybe like three four years ago, there were nowhere as many layer ones, but today, the landscape has really changed. So I love to start by just helping contextualize what Cosmos is. And I saw this really interesting tweet yesterday that I feel like, I don't know if you guys agree, but basically Kyle Simani from Multicoin tweeted that Solana is like a fast global state machine or basically example of fat protocol thesis, then Cosmos is the opposite of that, which is the app chain thesis. I don't know if you guys agree with that or how would you contextualize cosmos within all the layer ones today?
00:03:06.284 - 00:04:17.624, Speaker D: So I think one of the things that has been unique about Cosmos is that we had a very distinctive vision for building blockchains that goes back to, like, Jay's original vision and then built on by many, many other people who all had this pluralistic view of how blockchains should exist. That is that if that, like, the logical sort of instantiation of a blockchain is like a community or an application, and that was the natural architecture of blockchains and that we needed to build this. We called this idea cosmos, and we, like, value accrual was always, like, to do later, and the goal was to build the technology stack first. And so that's how we kind of got here. And so what Cosmos is almost, you can think of it, it's a set of components, but it's also almost a language for describing how to build and interoperate and interconnect an l one into a network of blockchains. So that's kind of.
00:04:19.804 - 00:04:25.584, Speaker A: I love that. And, Sam, do you agree with that as well, or how do you see Cosmos in the context of all these elements out there today?
00:04:27.324 - 00:05:05.604, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. It's a very different architecture. Obviously, it gives you a lot more control as an application designer. And, I mean, the expectation is that there's really going to be a lot of differentiation among this network of application specific chains, and there's really going to be kind of greater specificity and kind of tailoring for specific market conditions. So, yeah, it's kind of built as a next generation platform.
00:05:07.024 - 00:05:35.954, Speaker A: Yeah, I love that. And I think with all the conversations we have with developers and builders, they all love how customizable it is when they're building with Cosmos. But I'd love to quickly just pivot and talk about this new paper that just came out, which is Atom 2.0. Saki, in a recent presentation, you said that the features in the new cosmos will make EIP 1559 look quite dull in comparison so I'm really excited to dive in here. But first, yeah, just to give them context, where did this come from? Where did this paper come from? Who wrote this?
00:05:37.574 - 00:06:26.374, Speaker D: Okay, so I would say the. So let's just kind of go back a little bit, which is so 2019 Cosmos hub launches. So first, proof of stake production, blockchain running tendermint. We also get binance builds the BNB chain using the Cosmos SDK polygon builds their chain matic, their existing chain. Also, all of this stuff happens around the same period of time. We have this whole ecosystem of people start baking the first Cosmos SDK chains as standalone applications like Akash and Kava. They also launched during this time period.
00:06:26.374 - 00:07:03.502, Speaker D: And then 2019 is kind of the Cosmos SDK go to market year. And then we're working on IBC, which is really the point. The idea was we built all of this stuff with the idea of these blockchains would be able to interoperate. But now in 2019, we have an island of standalone blockchains. Same thing in 2020. It takes longer than any of us anticipated, but the end of 2020, IBC is ready, IBC launches, then nothing happens. Nobody really has a plan for what to do after IBC launches and then osmosis launches.
00:07:03.502 - 00:07:50.434, Speaker D: And then after osmosis launch is a giant forest of blockchain starts to come into existence because they can interrupt with, operate with osmosis exchange liquidity. An economy starts to form. We start getting NFT projects. We start getting like Stargaze and asset mantle and Omniflex. And sort of the ecosystem really starts to expand post 2021. But when the team left all in bits, tendermint, the original development company, there's very little left there. And there were very few people, there were basically no people involved who were involved in launching the Cosmos hub at all left of the company.
00:07:50.434 - 00:08:37.504, Speaker D: All of us then started to, most of us started to build our own chains in 2021 after Osmosis launched, circling back at the end of 2021. For better or worse, a lot of us have an emotional attachment to the Cosmos hub, to Adam. And we're like, I don't. It seems sad to, like, let it just become a me, like, remain the meme coins. It's like every other chain builds has, like, pursues its app chain hypothesis. And Adam is just this asset that is used to, like, onboard from centralized exchanges into the ecosystem. Eventually, that's not going to be as important because, you know, eventually it was obvious that USDC and other things would come to cosmos.
00:08:37.504 - 00:09:40.324, Speaker D: So we were like, you know, it's just like, okay, it's like, maybe there's one world in which Adam kind of rises, did its thing, birthed the cosmos, and then fades away. But there were a bunch of ideas that had come in, had come to fruition that we had sort of, kind of hypothesized about that you started seeing in the real world in 2021, like, protocol controlled value, protocol controlled liquidity. And the other piece, I would say, is the whole Mev story. We had this idea of interchange security, a form of shared security for the Cosmos hub, extending on the IBC protocol to the consensus layer. That idea had probably been around since 2019, but our team had stepped up to build it, which had been cool. So all these pieces were there. And the other thing going back to Cosmos history is we come up with the Cosmos idea.
00:09:40.324 - 00:10:20.474, Speaker D: I think we all kind of are like, we don't have a great value accrual story here, but we think we'll build something cool. 2016, 2017 era of Cosmos. Gavin and Robert, for Polkadot, were, like, inspired by Cosmos, but they're like, we want a much more concrete value accrual story. And we were like, your value accrual story is stupid, because anyone who has a really great product is not going to pay for a parachute slot. They'll, like, launch their own l one. And we were like, that doesn't make any sense. And so all of these ideas had floated around for a long time about, like, what were good value accruals for, like, sort of networks of blockchains, kind of architectures.
00:10:20.474 - 00:10:53.924, Speaker D: And when the pcv stuff and the mev stuff started to become, like, a real thing, I, sunny, Sam, lots of other people in cosmos started really being like, oh, there's a new set of primitives that we can incorporate into Adam and maybe really reshape its role in the ecosystem. And so, basically, nine months of work sort of started with these kinds of ideas, basically, this set of ideas, and they sort of eventually converged into this paper.
00:10:55.344 - 00:11:22.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's really a great walk down memory lane, because I remember looking at Polkadot and Cosmos way back, and I was really excited about Cosmos vision, but I thought, okay, the atom token wasn't really investable at that time. And then I looked at the Polkadot vision, and I thought, okay, no one's gonna pay for the parachain. So I wanted to kind of get access to this kind of cross chain or interchange thesis, but I didn't really know how. And I think this paper kind of really changed that, but just want to pass it to Sam to see if you have anything to add on the history of cosmoside.
00:11:26.374 - 00:11:29.094, Speaker F: One thing that was just kind of.
00:11:29.134 - 00:11:41.666, Speaker E: Unknown, I mean, you kind of admitted it yourself, is like how these networks are going to scale. Like the Cosmos architecture is very kind of committed to horizontal scaling, but it.
00:11:41.690 - 00:11:45.654, Speaker F: Wasn'T quite known what was going to be required.
00:11:47.834 - 00:12:15.414, Speaker E: To make sure that the network was actually kind of fully activated. And that was really left as an open problem in the initial cosmos thesis. And the idea was, okay, we're going to observe and try to address that when we have sufficient information. And so that's kind of like where this atom 2.0 vision comes into play.
00:12:16.114 - 00:12:38.084, Speaker A: No? Yeah. Thanks for that walk down memory lane. I think that was a much needed context on this and I'm really excited to dive into the paper. So from my understanding, there's, I think, four major parts in the paper. There's the change in issuance, which is partly enabled by the conversation on liquid staking. There's interchange security, interchange scheduler and interchange allocator. So I'd love to dive into all of that.
00:12:38.084 - 00:12:49.952, Speaker A: Let's start with the monetary policy first. I think, honestly, this is the most boring part of the paper, but this is what it starts with. So I think we got to break that down first. So what is new with the monetary policy with Adam?
00:12:50.128 - 00:12:54.656, Speaker F: So it's helpful to know a little.
00:12:54.680 - 00:14:05.104, Speaker E: Bit about the way that cosmos chains are set up today, which is kind of targeting a certain security level, which is two thirds of tokens staked. Basically, it's a PID controller. So if then two thirds of token holders are staked, then issuance will change in order to reduce that staking level and vice versa. If you drop below two thirds, then you want to increase the security level, so you increase issuance and occlusion. And Zaki has been kind of spearheading this project to introduce a new module, liquid staking, into the ecosystem. And this really just changes the security regime radically. There's an expectation that most of the atom token holders are going to be staked and issue liquid staked assets.
00:14:05.604 - 00:14:06.344, Speaker F: So.
00:14:08.084 - 00:14:54.144, Speaker E: There'S an opportunity and really a need to change the monetary policy because this stake ratio targeting no longer makes sense. So we've done some security analysis. We're actually going to publish a kind of follow on paper that goes into more detail on this. But the paper gives a sketch. And the idea is that we can basically move from an exponential issuance regime into a sub exponential regime. And we can actually just issue linearly so we can have tail emissions that that are fixed. So that's the main kind of concept.
00:14:54.144 - 00:15:19.844, Speaker E: And then we, because we no longer have this adaptive issuance model and the kind of purpose that is suggested in this paper is to create this economic zone, there's some capital upfront capital required to do that. And so there's an initial issuance to kickstart that process.
00:15:21.664 - 00:15:42.524, Speaker A: So let's see if I can synthesize that. So it sounds like, because now that liquid staking is a thing, we don't really need to emit as many liquid tokens and just flood the market with atom so we can actually have a lower emission over time. But then in the short term, you guys actually want to increase emission into a treasury to fund development. Is that kind of roughly the plan for the monetary policy?
00:15:46.654 - 00:16:25.636, Speaker D: I have like some. There's some like, optics questions that have turned out to be more important than we anticipated about how the treasury gets. Gets funded, which is, I think what's important about the way things work is we do not think that Adam can generate sustainable revenue with its like, current, like with small tweaks to like. Like we still want to reward stakers. And we believe that like atom holders should be more than just like a fixed emission meme coin, right. That it should actually capture real revenue from the world. That again, like that.
00:16:25.636 - 00:17:28.604, Speaker D: So these are the things that are important to us. The second thing is, like, people have gotten very hung up on the paper's proposal of like, of like a rapid emission of 55 million tokens into the treasury. I think it's a very important thing to understand that what the paper is really trying to get at the core idea the paper is trying to get it is that such a treasury should exist. And that if the treasury is going well, that is, we are deploying capital, generating profits, making success is achieved. That the treasury can scale to the point where it represents a meaningful fraction of the total set of atoms out there and it can continue to pay for itself. I think we're talking about tweaks to the paper to clear up the optics, because there is a way of interpreting what is being said is looking like a lot of dilution. And that is not the effect nor the intention, but maybe it is excessively subtle in the current version of the paper.
00:17:29.884 - 00:18:00.344, Speaker A: Yeah, I did see that community response initially from some people when they saw kind of, oh, wow, a lot of the initial admission would go to a treasury like, what is this treasury being used for? And so on. So I'm sure there'll be a lot more detail around that soon. But one quick question. I want to double click on the point about liquid staking, because I've not been able to find an answer on this. So if there is a liquid representation of an underlying stake, and the stake is slashed on wherever it's staked on what actually happens to the liquid representation, does that introduce any risk to cosmos?
00:18:00.714 - 00:18:36.840, Speaker D: So what we did with liquid staking is we have not enshrined any one single liquid staking protocol as the answer. Instead, there is a very robust market in the cosmos ecosystem of liquid staking providers. Stride, lido, persistence, one quicksilver. And there are, like. I don't know, there are always more coming. Like, it is like, people are very excited about this as entrepreneurs. So we have, like, great founding teams, building protocols.
00:18:36.840 - 00:19:19.514, Speaker D: And I think for the answer is, what happens when someone gets slashed? For every one of those protocols, it's a different answer. And really, what we want, what we've, what the goal of the occlusion liquid staking module is been to make is to, like, accelerate the adoption and accelerate the growth of the marketplace so that, like, the market can choose which among these solutions and which among these answers to, like, what happens when your atoms get slashed to your liquid atoms? That there can be, you know, that there will be many answers to the question, and the market will choose, you know, what do they want to use in defi? What will people accept as collateral for stable coins and all of this stuff that we want in the expanding atom economy.
00:19:21.214 - 00:19:27.104, Speaker A: Got it. Got it. So it sounds like there is a multitude of possibilities deserve, but, yeah, that was a little bit of a tangent.
00:19:27.144 - 00:19:39.444, Speaker D: Pluralism is the way of cosmos. Like, our answer to any question is pluralism. What do you want? Pluralism, what should cosmos be? All possible answers.
00:19:40.464 - 00:20:15.644, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I love to kind of dive into the most exciting part of the paper, which is the part about interchange security and these new features called a scheduler and an allocator. So let's talk about interchange security first, because this is really important. And with this enabled, basically, app chains can soon rely on Cosmos hub or atom stakers to secure their chains instead of bootstrapping their own validator set. So I guess is the correct analogy here that app chains can become more to Cosmos hub, what roll ups are to Ethereum today? Or is there a difference there?
00:20:16.424 - 00:20:43.204, Speaker D: I think that the answer is a bit. Has. There's a nuanced difference here, which is so one of the things that. So there are a lot of reasons why a team, why things might be built using interchange security, because interchange security gets, gets. You all get to like really interesting properties that are somewhat okay. I mean, there's some commonality with roll ups. It's not undeniable.
00:20:43.204 - 00:22:09.994, Speaker D: I will say that in many ways, like, one of the things that's cool about inner jain security is right, is like, with roll ups, it's like, how do, how are you going to bridge? How do you get a decentralized sequencer? All of that stuff with interchange security? We have answers to all of these questions right now. Now, are the asymptotic security bounds and asymptotic scaling properties of ropes better than the asymptotic scaling properties of interchange security? Yes, roll ups at the asymptotes are better. I'm a big believer in Celestia and the modular future too. But we find a bunch of different reasons why you might want to build something with interchange security. One is you just want to add a feature to an existing blockchain and an existing token, but you don't want to add all of that complexity into the core system where bugs, et cetera, might cause the whole system to halt. And so part of our motivation has been, hey, we can get so this allocator, the scheduler, can all be built as interchange security chains. The next thing we find is that there are third parties who want to build applications that are clearly value creating for the ecosystem or value creating for atom, but they do not want to have their own tokenomics.
00:22:09.994 - 00:22:39.558, Speaker D: And one of the biggest things is we've never really had great answers for people who don't want to build things on Cosmos using the app chain. With a full app chain hypothesis, you could run smart contracts on top of evmose or cosmosm or Juno or all of these things. We never had a great answer of, hey, I just want to build an app chain, but I don't want to. And here's the value of creation story. We don't know about tokenomics, we don't know about security. We don't know about bootstrap strapping. We haven't figured that out yet.
00:22:39.558 - 00:23:23.858, Speaker D: We may never figure it out. So we've never had anything from them. And interchange security has also given us a product in that genre. And then I think the third question is, it gives a project a great opportunity to collaborate even closer with the atom holder community. We've seen these collaborations of like, look, we did an airdrop, but that's a one time single instant in time collaborative moment. Then the communities immediately diverge as people sell and other people buy, and they go off in their separate directions. By building on top of interchange security, you have ability to align your community and the atom holder community and collaborate.
00:23:23.858 - 00:23:33.934, Speaker D: That collaborative idea is a big motivation between having the scheduler and the allocator to actually have a tangible way of in protocol expressing those collaborations.
00:23:38.834 - 00:23:40.322, Speaker B: Hey guys, I'm really excited to tell.
00:23:40.338 - 00:23:41.490, Speaker A: You more about one of my favorite.
00:23:41.522 - 00:24:14.424, Speaker B: Products in crypto right now, DyDX. This is a team I've known since 2018 and they've built one of the best exchange venues out there that also happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly. Now listen until the end because there's an opportunity for savvy traders out there as well. And here are just a few reasons why I like DyDx over other exchanges. First, is very liquid. It processes two to $3 billion every day in volume and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording. Which means you can trade things like Ethereum, bitcoin, Doge Solana and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today.
00:24:14.424 - 00:25:04.774, Speaker B: Second, it's also extremely cheap and if you're down bad from the bear market, you don't have to worry about gas fees at all because there is no gas fee on starkware L2 where DyDX is built on. Now that brings me to my next point as well. Its incredibly fast, unlike other L2 and high speed Dexs, you dont actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore. And as an additional point, by using Starkware, DYDX also provides users with increased security and privacy. And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so many different sub accounts. And their iOS mobile app is also live right now and it's amazing because it's compatible with Metamask, Coinbase wallet, Coin 98, Huawei wallet, and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there. And it's available for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today.
00:25:04.774 - 00:25:29.834, Speaker B: And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions, the most recent tier in the $10,000 equity tier, have won over $95,000 in rewards and you can get started with as low as $500 in equity to compete for prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DYDX exchange to learn more. And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:25:32.414 - 00:25:57.444, Speaker A: Yeah, and we're going to have to dive into what the scheduler and the allocator actually are and the kind of the motivations for that. But before that, just to kind of get some intuition here. Now, given that a lot of the app chains now can basically have the transactions validated by atom stakers, will this greatly increase opportunity for mev extraction, given that a lot of transactions are happening between different hubs? And maybe that's a good way to actually start talking about the scheduler as well.
00:25:59.384 - 00:27:04.214, Speaker F: Yeah, I can start to talk about this. The way that interchange security is structured, the atom validators are also validating on what's called the consumer chains is kind of the equivalent of the roll up. And so they, the validators will have information about both of these chains. They're concurrent processes, they're run separately. But that's, there's already that the knowledge of the state state on the other side of the network. So there certainly are mev opportunities there. And the scheduler is definitely a kind of acknowledgement and way of, kind of being more precise and deliberate about those arbitrage and kind of information sharing across domains.
00:27:05.434 - 00:27:12.574, Speaker A: So actually, what exactly is the scheduler? Can you maybe explain it through an example of how it might work in reality?
00:27:15.514 - 00:28:48.184, Speaker F: So it's a new construct, and it's a little bit unique to the cosmos architecture. So the idea is that, well, in cosmos you have a lot of control over the node binary. Part of that control is basically how block space is structured. Who has control of the transaction inclusion at a certain point in time. And what we realized is that we can actually tokenize that control at some specified time in the future, and we can trade that. So what we're proposing here is basically chains can opt into this system where they reserve some of their block space at a regular interval and offer that in a shared market. And then the purchaser of that reservation can redeem that NFT effectively at the specified time with a set of transactions.
00:28:48.184 - 00:28:53.484, Speaker F: And so they have kind of exclusive access to that block space at that moment in time.
00:28:56.544 - 00:29:27.174, Speaker A: What is an example of an application that would use something like this? Because this is quite unique, just to make sure that I understand it correctly. It sounds like with this scheduler module enabled app, chains within Cosmos would basically be able to say something like, hey, every five blocks I'm going to sell one of these blocks to whoever wants to buy it, and I'm going to sell this in the form of an NFT, which the holder can come redeem for block space later on. But I'm struggling to understand what type of applications would go out and buy an NFT and redeem block space like this.
00:29:30.254 - 00:30:19.224, Speaker F: So the purchaser, we actually, one of the primary buyers, we expect to be a flashbots like entity. So a blockbuilder, because the futures market for block space is actually going to be a kind of materially different product than the spot market, effectively. So they will likely resell blockspace to their customers with a different set of guarantees. That's a bit of an abstract answer, but needless to say that we think that there's going to be a very interesting market structure for block space, futures versus spot.
00:30:21.604 - 00:30:43.694, Speaker A: This is a massive concept as well, so I want to make sure we understand it. How does the redemption actually work? So say I buy an NFT that represents, let's say, a future block on osmosis, and I go to osmosis and give them the NFT. Do they have the right to just say, no, I don't want to honor your redemption? And what is the mechanism to prevent that from happening?
00:30:44.394 - 00:31:26.320, Speaker D: Yeah, I could take it. So, a bunch of teams inside of cosmos, informal osmosis, et cetera, have been developing this extension to tendermint called ABCI, or Abci 1.0. So, back in the good old days of 2015, Jay created this idea of separating consensus from application. He called it ABCI. It roughly was not majorly changed until this new ABCI proposition. And the idea is, with ABC I, you can program every step of the. Of the.
00:31:26.320 - 00:31:59.314, Speaker D: Of the, um, of the, uh, program every step of the, um. Of the consensus. So one of the things you can program is the conditions under which validators accept a block. Um, so it becomes relatively easy with, uh, ABci 1.0, which is the next tendermint release. Tendermint 0.37 has to write a rule that says, hey, we got this IBC packet from the scheduler blockchain.
00:31:59.314 - 00:32:22.364, Speaker D: It says that block 6000, the top part of the block, needs a signature from this public key in order for you to vote for the block, or you can vote for an empty block. Those are your options. No other block is valid, and you can plug these block validity rules in. And so now the protocol can guarantee delivery of these things.
00:32:23.504 - 00:32:39.004, Speaker A: I see. That's really interesting. So it's automatically enforced already. And I also love that example of flashbots using something like this. And is this the first example of a futures market for block space, or has there been other attempts that you guys have seen before? Like, what inspired this?
00:32:41.164 - 00:33:51.728, Speaker D: We were inspired by Carl's work on a block space futures market proposal for optimism. I think Carl Flourish and other people on the optimism and Ethereum Reach foundation team and the Ethereum community, we're talking about this idea of, I think even back in, I got to say, 2019, maybe we're talking about this idea of doing a block space futures market as a way, but they ran into a bunch of problems that we conveniently have solutions to. We can deal with the censorship problem, for instance, by only having the top of the block auctioned rather than the entire block. So we can separate the builder and the block proposer. And so this becoming a mitigation of censorship concerns. Because we have IBC, we can actually, we have a protocol by which multiple blockchains communicate with each other. So if you want to have a unified auction, it doesn't have to be centralized.
00:33:51.728 - 00:34:23.970, Speaker D: It can actually run on a blockchain. And so we take a lot. We stand on the shoulders of giants. And I think optimism's work is credited in the paper. And we have been very excited about different ideas from flashbots and stuff like this. But this idea of futures and spot market being separated, I believe, is somewhat novel. And this idea of using ABCI to do it is also novel.
00:34:23.970 - 00:34:41.383, Speaker D: So we're very excited. These are. But, you know, somebody will tell me that there's some forum post that they wrote on some ETH research or someone else that, like, predicted all of this, like, five years ago. So, you know, I'm sure that the things will be thrown. We tried to cite, you know, everything that was out there.
00:34:41.763 - 00:34:56.853, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. And I guess on the project side, right? So on the app change side, say, like, what's the incentive for, say, someone like osmosis to integrate the scheduler? So I understand on the flashbot side, like, there's a lot of value prop for them, but for appchains themselves, why would they want to integrate this?
00:35:00.233 - 00:35:40.874, Speaker F: So, first off, it's purely elective. No one is required to use this. So the idea is that it needs to be value add to any chain. It's being sold to these chains. And the way that I've been thinking about this is that a chain like osmosis is very likely going to do to internalize a lot of the mev within their own chain. And osmosis is actually already doing this. They're doing arbs between pools in protocol.
00:35:40.874 - 00:36:43.574, Speaker F: And so that's, you know, expected and encouraged. Osmosis does not have a way to kind of manage multilateral relationships between other chains. And in fact, if they need to establish a relationship with every single chain in order to kind of optimize cross chain arbs, that takes away from their focus on their core business. So that's kind of like where this product is focused. There's real value in aggregation and for osmosis to have a single counterparty for, for capturing at least some of the value of multi domain mev.
00:36:47.554 - 00:37:07.864, Speaker A: And I'd love to kind of also touch on the allocator as well, which obviously is a big part of the paper. I think this is the part where people seem to have the most trouble with understanding. So the scheduler makes a lot of sense in terms of creating a futures market for block space. Now, what exactly does the allocator do and how does that fit in with the scheduler?
00:37:12.244 - 00:38:47.914, Speaker F: Yeah, totally. So I'm sure, Zacky, you'll agree that oftentimes we'll get asked the question like from new Cosmos chains, like how do we, projects that are about to launch, how do we kind of align with Cosmos? We want to be integrated into the ecosystem. We want to have a close relationship with the builders. We want to make sure that we're connecting with the community because Cosmos has a really strong and kind of politically conscious ecosystem and there's no avenue for collaboration apart from information sharing at this point. So there's a demand for economic integration and exchange that, that is just not being satisfied. And so that's kind of the, that's one thing that the allocator is trying to solve. On the other end, there's this kind of phenomenon of targeting atom for air drops and kind of new cosmos chain go to market.
00:38:47.914 - 00:40:01.464, Speaker F: And this has been an interesting phenomenon to kind of watch play out, but it's not really a sustainable strategy for ecosystem growth. So we kind of stepped back and tried to think about this from first principles. Like, okay, we want to make sure that that atom continues to be kind of like more economically integrated as the ecosystem matures and that it really. Token holders, atom holders. And the hub itself is able to get exposure to ecosystem growth because the hub is really sponsoring a lot of the, the infrastructure development. So the allocator is basically a way to get that exposure and to kind of like have a more collaborative relationship with these new projects that are launching through getting exposure to the underlying tokens.
00:40:04.584 - 00:40:24.324, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think that, I think I understand the motivation for the allocator now basically facilitating smoother and better economic exchange between different app chains. But I'm still quite vague in terms of what the allocator actually does. So is it like a tool for people to do air drops across chains? Or, like, what is it allocating?
00:40:29.424 - 00:41:41.596, Speaker D: So mostly what the allocator is, is a tool by which the cosmos hub can hold non native assets in various ways, shapes and forms, where it can say, hey. So it can either delegate assets to groups of humans, to daos and say, hey, dao. Like, use these atoms and go out and try and generate, like, you know, we think a deal, like, we think a deal with stride. Like, we think growing the stride liquid staking ecosystem is important. We're going to delegate a bunch of atoms. You guys decide, like, what you specifically you should do for it, but you are going to be pipe, you are going to be piping the profits back up to the cosmos hub. That is, you know, that's, that's one aspect of it where, you know, you delegate some stream of funds to that other ways in which are purely algorithmic, where we target a certain asset mix through a governance vote and we use mechanism to have people ARB and buy atoms.
00:41:41.596 - 00:42:31.360, Speaker D: And inspired by Olympus, dow a little bit and other pcv mechanisms to achieve an asset mix from a certain amount of token emissions. Both of these things are sort of what we constitute in the. But it is we are asking for sort of. It comes down to this idea of building new governance features that can then allocate funds to applications whose job, like, you know, there are like at least three different teams, simply vc defract. And I forget what the other one is that are building, like ETF's type instruments for cosmos. I have a project called Sommelier, which makes strategy tokens. So cosmos hub could decide, hey, we want to own a bunch of the strategy tokens, or we want to, oh, osmosis.
00:42:31.360 - 00:43:14.404, Speaker D: Osmosis wants to build an ETF token out of ion. Forgot about that. And they want to call the token IBC. So the cosmos hub could vote and say, hey, we would rather take a million atoms and trade them for IBC and own IBC rather than those atoms because we want that synergy. This is the kind of model. But there's the other piece, which is, hey, once you own a bunch of assets, you also have to manage it, which is this ability to rebalance and algorithmically, or have an algorithmic asset mix adjustment portfolio rebalancing strategy is critical to the allocator module succeeding. They do a good job, Sam.
00:43:20.264 - 00:44:06.744, Speaker F: In the kind of monolithic paradigm you see, Ethereum has intrinsic alignment with some of the projects in their ecosystem because they're issuing assets on Ethereum. And that's just not the road that cosmos decided to travel, travel down. But we still think that Adam and the Cosmos hub is like an important kind of leader and collaborator within the ecosystem. And so this is borrowing concepts from international trade and political alliances to actually create that alignment.
00:44:09.564 - 00:44:59.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I really love that way of phrasing it, because basically, Cosmos is trying to maintain its pluralism and allow people to create all these customized app chains, but also, at the same time, find some way to unify all of the value in one place and have Atom have exposure to all of that value created. So I think that's a really, really interesting challenge. And that actually reminds me of another feature that I wanted to touch on, which I don't think was really talked about in the white paper, but this was covered during Cosmos verse, which is the recent Cosmos conference, this thing called Mesh networking, which allows different app chains to validate for each other, which I thought was really, really interesting. It really fits in this theme about cross app chain synergy that you guys were talking about. Is that something that's on the roadmap immediately or just a theoretical concept? What do you guys think about that?
00:45:03.114 - 00:45:31.634, Speaker D: I can take my stab at it. We've really been struggling. So there have been things that. Okay, so there are things that Cosmos teams find, like, really offensive from a design point of view, that we are, like, explicit rejections. So we reject, like, sort of randomly chosen committee based security. We think that's really scary. So that's like sharding.
00:45:31.634 - 00:46:11.806, Speaker D: And, you know, you see this stuff in production in Nier, and it's really cool. But if anything about, like, you know, the BSc attack over the weekend, over last weekend has taught me anything. It's like, you know, my suspicions about what software might be more fragile than you think are going to take longer to play out than I usually, than you think, and it's going to take years. And so I've always been really scared of committee based security. So we don't like that. And that's what Polkadot and near do, we don't like. We think that arbitrary subset based security is essentially proof of authority networks.
00:46:11.806 - 00:46:56.106, Speaker D: So that's basically what avalanche is doing with subsets where you elect in a subset subnet. So what we actually, I think we're converging on what the Cosmos team believes are forms of shared security that are robust. One form of shared security is the interchange securities idea, where you do full replication, and then the mesh security idea works really well. So DeFi chains have this problem, which is this imbalance between TVL and staking and value at risk and TVL. Right? And so you have the gravity bridge right now, which has far more USDC bridged over it than the value of its staking token. And so you have all of these. You have these imbalances.
00:46:56.106 - 00:47:52.278, Speaker D: Superfluid staking, which is like a great innovation from the osmosis team, is the first attempt to address this imbalance, which is to say, hey, let us use your token in both DeFi. In both our DeFi platform and in the application layer or in the staking layer. And I think that's so far been performing well. But the next idea is, hey, we're in this economic relationship with each other, where Kanto and all our TVL comes, and a large portion of our TVL comes over the gravity bridge. Why don't we have mesh security between us? So I think we're probably finally. I think mesh security is a major sort of cognitive innovation about, we want to make the interchange security thing less rigid and more flexible, but we still want to keep with our design principles as Cosmos. And I think it is typical fashion.
00:47:52.278 - 00:48:27.042, Speaker D: Sunny has really shown us a very interesting direction for Cosmos, but it's less clear that and mostly what I want cosmos like, Cosmos people are like, there is some sort of competition between mesh security and interchange security. And I'm going to say that our experience seems to indicate that there is, like, there are going to be people who want mesh security. There are people who want interchange security. There are very few people who are going to be like, oh, which one should I pick? They're like, no, I have to. Economics. Like, I want to build. I like, want to make my token valuable.
00:48:27.042 - 00:48:55.200, Speaker D: I have this all figured out, but I want to borrow. I want to be able to buy security, rent secure. I want to have security, like, across our economic relationships. I want to, like, map security to our economic and trading relationships. And then there are going to be people who are like, I want affiliation with atoms, or, I don't want to have tokenomics, I want to choose interchange security. That world is completely separated, and I don't view them as competing at all. But it's not part of the Atom 2.0
00:48:55.200 - 00:49:04.724, Speaker D: vision development direction at all. To build mesh security, it will have to get. There will be, hopefully, new mechanisms within cosmos for funding.
00:49:06.204 - 00:50:17.804, Speaker F: I think if you ask anyone who's building a cosmos chain like they like, no chain is an island. It is a very collaborative ecosystem. And the direction that everyone is heading is towards economic, political integration with one another. Security is a super important ingredient, but it's a starting point, actually. And it's a means to an end, which is further collaboration, trust minimization for bilateral relationships between app chains, the ability to create, create a substrate for higher order application logic, and the ability for future collaboration. So actually, some of that stuff is in the paper. It's just framed in a slightly different way.
00:50:17.804 - 00:50:21.204, Speaker F: I'm fully on board with the general idea.
00:50:24.724 - 00:50:52.174, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think that's a great way to kind of wrap up the conversation. So today we've talked about a lot of very specific ideas, but I think it all ties back into creating a more unified economy for Cosmos and for more value to flow back to atom. So I'm going to ask the last question, which I'm sure a lot of atom holders are thinking and a lot of developers hate to answer, which is, what is the timeline for all of this? Like, are we talking about a few months or a few years of rollout or what does that look like?
00:50:55.594 - 00:51:38.100, Speaker D: So I'll talk about just from a developer point of view. So the liquid staking stuff, that cosmos that is in the white paper, was all developed by occlusion over the last year with the financial support of the Interchain foundation, which we are very grateful for. But the occlusion team built all of that. So that's actually ready to be merged with Cosmos SDK and will be part of the default new staking behavior of the Cosmos SDK. The scheduler is a thing that can be built. So interchange security is scheduled to go live in January. The scheduler is something that the interchange security team is very excited about.
00:51:38.100 - 00:52:20.866, Speaker D: We all gotta. Hopefully we could stop fighting about issuance on the Internet and get back to reading multi dimensional auction papers to figure out how to build that piece. And then the allocator, I think, has been in R and D mode for about three months, but it still has a lot of open questions about building it. And then for the governance stuff, we have this groups module that has been written that is going to allow us to build a lot of the governance stuff already. Again, timelines are unclear. We have to pull both existing and new teams together for this. It's hard to get started until we have some sort of.
00:52:20.866 - 00:52:37.414, Speaker D: Until we have a vote of the atom holders to sort of align around an idea, which has been the political process that is going on right now. But hopefully, once we're past that, we get into this team building phase and we can build this shit.
00:52:38.874 - 00:53:02.304, Speaker E: The first two parts, interchange security and liquid staking, have a kind of notional commitment from the Atom Holder community. There's been prior votes and a lot of development work and those are going to come online estimated Q one of next year, so very soon. And really everything else in the paper.
00:53:03.284 - 00:53:04.024, Speaker D: Is.
00:53:05.964 - 00:53:13.444, Speaker E: Still being discussed and, and we're hoping to get all the token holders on board.
00:53:14.384 - 00:53:29.044, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And I think that is an incredible note to wrap this up on. So thank you so much, gentlemen, for coming on the show again to explain to us all the ambitious plans that Atom 2.0 has. I'm really, really excited to share this with the community and yeah, thank you so much again.
