00:00:39.334 - 00:00:40.910, Speaker C: Today's episode is brought to you by.
00:00:40.942 - 00:00:47.030, Speaker A: Protocol Labs, the team behind Filecoin. And with me today is Colin Efrin from protocol Labs, who leads ecosystem there.
00:00:47.062 - 00:00:50.630, Speaker B: To tell us why people should choose Filecoin over alternatives.
00:00:50.702 - 00:00:54.434, Speaker A: So, Colin, why should people be using Filecoin over other competitors?
00:00:55.054 - 00:01:26.316, Speaker D: Filecoin believes that web3 will only win by offering a better product at a better price point. When it comes to storage, Filecoin offers the most scale at the cheapest price, with the strong guarantees uniquely enabled by its open market of storage providers and its crypto economic incentives. Now, smart contracts on Filecoin, which launches in q one of 2023, only make this more powerful. It enables users to create perpetual storage deals to store data forever at costs that are a small fraction of centralized storage.
00:01:26.330 - 00:01:29.368, Speaker C: Storage providers like esteem hello there.
00:01:29.416 - 00:01:30.752, Speaker B: Now, before I move on, I'd love.
00:01:30.768 - 00:01:34.016, Speaker A: To thank the hundreds of you who have subscribed to blockchain.
00:01:34.040 - 00:01:35.896, Speaker B: Because with your support, I've been able.
00:01:35.920 - 00:01:43.568, Speaker A: To share my real thoughts on specific projects that I don't usually share, on interviews in a format that I enjoy more, which is bi weekly written posts.
00:01:43.656 - 00:01:45.200, Speaker B: We've also been able to offer exclusive.

00:01:51.528 - 00:01:53.128, Speaker B: Now, we even had Elon Musk comment.
00:01:53.176 - 00:01:54.490, Speaker A: On one of our threads recently.
00:01:54.632 - 00:01:56.390, Speaker B: So if you haven't already, head on.

00:02:01.110 - 00:02:27.254, Speaker A: What you'd spend on a coffee a day. Hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, in the past few weeks, we've had a pretty crazy time in crypto. We spent a lot of time on the show talking about regulations, we're talking about banks blowing up. So I really wanted to do something that is away from that focus back on what's fun in crypto, because that's why we're all here in the first place. And one of the things that I've always wanted to talk about is NFT trading.
00:02:27.254 - 00:03:02.686, Speaker A: And this is one of the areas that I find myself struggle with the most, just because it's so different and attached from the rest of crypto investing. And I've been looking for the perfect guest to bring on this show for years, I'd say, and I was very fortunate that recently at ETH Denver, I met this person called Spencer who's running an NFT only fund and he's focusing specifically on NFT trading. And I thought, wow, this is a perfect, perfect opportunity to bring Spencer on to talk about his funds, Spencer Ventures and NFT trading. So thank you very much, Dimitri from one Kx for making the introduction. And Spencer, welcome to the show, man.
00:03:02.870 - 00:03:11.274, Speaker C: Jason, thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to kind of share the good, the good book of NFTs with your audience and with everyone who listens to this podcast.
00:03:11.694 - 00:03:17.430, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely, man. And just to get us started, I'd love to kind of hear about your story. Like, what's your background, man?
00:03:17.622 - 00:03:45.958, Speaker C: Yeah, so I have like a weird and winding sort of path in life. I didn't go straight to college from high school. I used to competitively, so I used to travel around doing that, doing World Cups and Grand Prix for the US, training like full time basically. And while I was doing that, I needed money and I needed a job and I didn't have a degree. So I ended up working at a startup based out of New York. While I was working there, we won a few million dollars in venture in contracts, the Department of Education. I got promoted to c suite.
00:03:45.958 - 00:04:50.154, Speaker C: We went on, we raised venture, but the joke at the company always was that we were doing education technology, but I was uneducated at the time. So ultimately left that company, went to the University of Chicago, studied economics, was an executive at three other startups, venture backed, two of them sold, one of them raised $125 million valuation in a year and a half for another one of them. And during that period of time, I was buying and selling magic, gathering trading cards to fund the startups that I was running. And pandemic happened, kind of shifted a little bit what I wanted to do with my time, wasn't sure where I wanted to go, and ended up going to the dark side, which was venture investing. And so I joined a group called Lofty Ventures based out of Chicago, doing super early stage check writing. And while I was at lofty Ventures, was in clubhouse and sort of early pandemic days, stumbled across NFTs and I said, oh, this is just kind of like venture investing, but with trading cards, this makes sense to me. And so started off sort of testing the waters a little bit, dipping my toes in, getting my feet wet.
00:04:50.154 - 00:05:17.560, Speaker C: Bought my first bored ape for like 2.8 ETH back in the day, made a couple of investments. What started as a very small portion of my personal portfolio very quickly became a very large portion for those who were around last year. So that was a pretty, or I guess two years ago at this point. So I had a pretty crazy run. Was an early investor in Ugalabs assets and artifact, which got acquired by Nike Cool Cats, which pumped pretty strong. So did that a lot.
00:05:17.560 - 00:05:50.874, Speaker C: And then in December of 2021, sold most of what I was holding to stables. So about 70% of the portfolio. Following that in Q three of 22, I actually raised a fund. So institutionally backed fund, we're buying the dip and we've been in operation for about seven, eight months at this point. Had a lot of different swings during that period of time. But one of the marquee investors, and this was reported by blockworks for my fund is the Pritzker Group, which is the governor of Illinois family office. And so that was a pretty exciting investor to help onboard into the space.
00:05:50.874 - 00:06:29.654, Speaker C: And it was just interesting to me to see what was capable. There was so much appetite, especially those who remember last year, early on in the early days, it was just this crazy, crazy run up. And then I think as many crazy run ups do, it pulled back very significantly. But if you look and you have a long thesis on what nfts are and what the space is like now is, I think one of the most interesting times to be building those positions when not as many people are focused on them. And I think this is the cycle that like begins to lay the groundwork for institutional adoption in the next cycle. So I'll pause there, but that's a little bit of my story. Happy to go into any parts of that, more or less, as they're interesting.
00:06:30.274 - 00:07:03.778, Speaker A: Yeah, and I'd love to kind of dive into that last part, which is obviously your NFT fund, which Spencer ventures. And according to the announcement, I think you raised from a $10 billion family office, as you mentioned, and this is one of the very few funds I've seen out there crypto that is NFT only because usually I see a lot of funds that are investing in NFT infrastructure. They're investing in companies like Blur and Opensea. But for you, it seems like a lot of the focus is actual NFTs themselves. So I'm curious how you came across how you decided on this thesis. Do you also invest in infrastructure or is this mostly directly the JPEGs themselves?
00:07:03.946 - 00:07:36.220, Speaker C: Yeah. So this is kind of interesting, right? Like I come from a venture background and I think the obvious thing, which a lot of people did, was to raise a web3 equity fund or token warrants or something where you invest in the infrastructure, right. I'll give you a little anecdote about why I didn't go that route. And it's something that I've looked at a lot, but we really just trade jpegs. And I think a lot of people don't believe me when I say that, but it's true. And I'll tell you a story here, which is that I was talking with the co founders of Artifact early on. I was looking at doing a venture investment and they said hey, the end of us talking.
00:07:36.220 - 00:08:16.338, Speaker C: They said hey, don't venture invest in us, just buy the NFTs they sold to Nike. Eight months later the venture investors got about a three X on their investment, something plus minus that the NFTs were a 200 X. And so this got me kind of thinking. And I think one thing thats interesting about this is the venture investors obviously did great. A sale to Nike is fantastic. And theres a lot of money to be made venture investing, but theres just a lot more capital because its much easier to set up an institutional like account and institutional grade product for venture investing than it is for liquid token trading. And I think a lot of people shied away.
00:08:16.338 - 00:08:55.270, Speaker C: The regulations aren't as clear. The infrastructure isn't as much like when I work with my service providers, my admin, my auditors, my tax accountants, they're learning along the way how to think of themselves in the context of this fund. And so a lot of people I think, shied away for that from me. I shied away from that for me. I actually saw this as exciting because I think this is the type of thing where its like, okay, you have disproportionately tons of institutional capital going towards these infrastructure investments, but the assets that the infrastructure is for is much harder for institutional capital to get behind because the structuring isnt there. Let me take on this hurdle. I want to go lean into the difficulty of this.
00:08:55.270 - 00:09:27.814, Speaker C: Lets figure it out. Be as above board as possible, do everything in as much the right way as possible. Always optimize for above boredness beyond anything else. But let me build this infrastructure. Somebody has to come do this. And I think this is where, if you look at the cycles, my view is in the next macroeconomic cycle, there will be more institutional players such as myself, that come in and are trading the assets directly, because it's just going to get easier over time. There will be more clarity and the infrastructure will be better, even if we have to build it ourselves.
00:09:28.904 - 00:09:46.672, Speaker A: Yeah, no, definitely. I think that is a really unique approach, and I'm really curious how you would define your strategy as well. Would you call Spencer ventures more of a trading fund for NFTs or more of a venture investing fund for NFTs? And how do you decide on what is the holding duration for your average position, for instance?
00:09:46.848 - 00:10:13.286, Speaker C: Yeah, so I like to say that my strategy is to make money for my investors. And this is a very, very broad answer and not a great answer to your question, really. So here, here's the thing. I think I've seen a couple of funds that have been structured where they're like, similar to a venture fund, where they're long, only they buy and hold. Their goal is to hold for three to five years. Um, and they're looking for, you know, ten x's, hundred x's. I don't think this is totally the right approach because you don't have to do that.
00:10:13.286 - 00:10:32.762, Speaker C: So, like, when you have a venture fund, practically, like, you kind of have to do that, right? So if you invest in a company and it goes, gets marked up ten x in the next round, sometimes there's an opportunity to sell secondaries, but very often there isn't. And it's not like consistent liquidity that you can rely on. Right. And so in venture investing, you're locked into the strategy.
00:10:32.818 - 00:10:33.394, Speaker A: Right.
00:10:33.554 - 00:11:08.440, Speaker C: Now, the similarity between venture investing and NFT investing is that it's very high volatility. So you're going to have some hundred x's and you're going to have some stuff that goes to, like, actual zero. Right. However, one of the cool parts about this, this industry is that you don't have to do that, right? So you can actively manage positions, you can enter and exit positions with liquidity. Now, it's not quite as liquid as, say, a public equities. So it's not like you can necessarily buy and sell at giant size at any time. And this is an important thing, is size, right? So the liquidity actually decreases as a function of the size of your position.
00:11:08.440 - 00:11:37.844, Speaker C: So as an institutional player, this is something I think a lot about, and it was a big question going into this, right. When I'm entering a position, I like to target one to 5% of a collection. When I'm entering. That takes me four to six weeks usually to build. And if I ever want to exit the entirety position, if I try and do that in one day, it's not a good idea. Usually this is going to cause a huge, huge swing in price that's going to adversely affect me. The market is not liquid enough.
00:11:37.844 - 00:12:24.594, Speaker C: We don't have market makers in the same capacity that yet in the same capacity that we have in say public markets or even in other crypto that are just waiting there with bid depth to absorb your selling, youre hoping someones going to buy it. Now, recently with Blur, this has changed a little bit, but from a macro perspective, you have to think about it that way. In general, when I enter a position, I think about only entering positions where im comfortable holding a project long. Theres a lot of stuff youll see in nfts that pump and pull back. You can make money trading that stuff, but its not really my focus because I need to be able to enter a large position and exit for it to be meaningful in the scope of the returns. Now, that being said, if we have two to three x, I don't need to hold the whole position. What I like to do is buy down cost basis.
00:12:24.594 - 00:13:06.570, Speaker C: Two x's, maybe trim back a third to a quarter, three x's, trim back some more, recover the whole cost basis, and then I feel much more comfortable letting the rest ride. And this is like, I think anyone who tells you that they can time exactly the top or time exactly the bottom, not just in nfts, not just in crypto, but in any asset class, is just lying. This is not how any of this works. So if you sell on the way up and buy on the way down, this is the best approach in general. Now, that being said, there are acute capitulation moments. One thing I really like to do with the fund is buy into buy the blood is what everyone says. We deployed a really significant portion of our fund within the three weeks after FTX's collapse.
00:13:06.570 - 00:14:14.554, Speaker C: And I think this is like, that's proved out to be a really good trade, but it's one of those things where I woke up that morning and I said, okay, this may not be the bottom, but it's certainly not the top, right? Let's buy. And this is similar to like, okay, in December of 21, why did I sell most of what I was holding? I woke up one morning, I said, this may not be the top, but it's certainly not the bottom. And there was like two, three months where that looked terrible in all my group chats of friends, they're like, oh, I can't believe you sold, like, we're up another 20, 30%, and then six, seven months later, that looked very good, right? And so this is the type of thing is, like, if I will sell some too early and I will buy some too late, and I'm okay with that, because if I'm not doing that, then I'm just being too aggressive. I think this is like a general trading thing, right? Where, like, if you hit every good play, it means you're making too many bets. Like you should, in equilibrium, be missing good plays. Because if you're hitting every good play, it means you probably hit a lot of really bad plays. And in, I think the crypto, but especially in nfts, preservation of capital is really important, right? Like, a lot of stuff does actually go to zero.
00:14:14.554 - 00:15:18.468, Speaker C: And so drawbacks, overall market drawbacks, individual product drawbacks is one thing, but, like, overall market going back is another. And I think if you want to trade in this market, right, you have to have a long thesis in general, because, again, there are these moments of liquidity crunches, acute capitulation. Right? And so the way that I think about this, and the reason that I'm so excited about nfts, I think that nfts are similar to crypto in that, like, in 2016, 2017, crypto went up really substantially, right? Everyone said it's a bubble, and then it went down, and everyone said, I'm right, it was a bubble, right? And then 2020 comes along and it goes back up, and now suddenly it's not a bubble, it's a cycle. And a cycle narrative is what brought institutional adoption. Why do I say institutional adoption? Well, because if you look like during that period of time in the 2020 cycle was when you saw the S and P highly correlate to ETH and bitcoin. Why did that happen? Because the same people that trade the S and P were trading it. You saw Rentek, you saw Citadel, you said all the quant hedge funds start trading crypto.
00:15:18.468 - 00:15:36.392, Speaker C: Right? And that was, like, true institutional adoption. I think that there's a reasonable chance, a very good chance, as a matter of fact, that we are in the same sort of moment in nfTs. 2020 was the first time it went up. It went crazy. Everyone said it was a bubble. It went down. Everyone said, haha, I was right, it was a bubble.
00:15:36.392 - 00:16:02.846, Speaker C: And I think this is just my personal opinion, but I think that there's a very good chance in whenever interest rates decrease, because they will decrease. At some point. But whenever that happens, we have an overall macroeconomic in a sort of better environment that we will see nfts recover. And when nfts recover, they will go from being a bubble to now being a cycle. Right. And so that cycle narrative, I cannot tell you how important that is to driving institutional adoption. Right.
00:16:02.846 - 00:16:35.852, Speaker C: And that's sort of the big bet that I think you have to make trading nfts. Everything else you do is like, yeah, I'm buying down cost basis. I'm finding plays here and there. Sometimes there are things that I enter and exit completely in short periods of time. But really, it's, with this long term goal, it's like, okay, I think in general, nfts will do really well in the next macroeconomic bull run. And so whatever I'm doing right now is just positioning my portfolio so that it's in the right place to catch that and be really good. Then as much as I can buy down cost basis, great.
00:16:35.852 - 00:16:54.312, Speaker C: As much as I can pay distributions to investors. So that right now we've paid about 35% of capital that was originally contributed back to our investors, and that's just on profits we've made from trading other stuff. So effectively, I just think of everything that we have in the fund as costing 35% less, which is great. It's a great position to be in.
00:16:54.488 - 00:17:18.014, Speaker A: Yeah, that's amazing. And I really like the way that you put it. Basically, you're making a macro bet on nfts as an asset class as well, which I think is a really interesting bet to make. And I'd love to dive into the portfolio aspect of it. And going back to the point you mentioned earlier where you target, I think you said one to 5% of a collection. So how did you come up with that, uh, you know, number? And how important is it to get to that number?
00:17:18.434 - 00:17:24.066, Speaker C: Yeah. So, I mean, this is, this is like, I don't think this is something that traders should take away, in general, as being a target.
00:17:24.130 - 00:17:24.330, Speaker D: Right.
00:17:24.362 - 00:18:11.250, Speaker C: This is just like, what size impact do you, as an individual investor, want to have on a company? And this maybe comes from, like, a venture background is like, there is certainly a point, right? Like, you don't, as a trader, want to own, say, 50% of a collection, right? Like, that's probably too much. You're never really. Maybe you exit that position, maybe you have the crazy trade, and eventually you exit it. But, like, there's a point where, like, if you have too much of the supply, you can never really expect to sell. Cause as soon as you start sell, selling, everyone's gonna run, right? Like an. Imagine if someone who had 50% of bitcoin like, this just isn't good for anyone, right? So there is like a. Now what is that number? I don't know what the answer is, right? Like, I would, like, I've started from the perspective of I wanna be more conservative versus too aggressive, right? Like, I don't wanna ruin a product by owning, you know, say it's bad to own ten or 20% of a collection.
00:18:11.250 - 00:18:46.254, Speaker C: Like, I just don't want to find. I'd rather like, inch up to that than start too high, right? And so I think one to 5% is a pretty comfortable place to be at where it's like, okay, this is sizable. You know, this is a trade at size. Because if you're running, you know, a multi million dollar fund, like, let's say you have a sub one ETH play or a one ETH play, right? Like one ethanol depends. Now it's a lot more. But back when I was starting to run the fund, like, you know, there was plays we made where we, where we bought, like a one ETH, we bought a quarter million dollars worth of it. So that's probably like 200 units of a ten k supply.
00:18:46.254 - 00:19:14.760, Speaker C: Like, that's about 2%. Right? And so for me, that was just what I was looking at with. With resources. Um, but I think this, this kind of speaks to, like, one of the big things about running an NFT fund is there's no playbook, right? Like, you can't go and say, okay, the last ten years, here's how people have run NFT funds. I am very much making this up as I go, and I'm going to be the first one to admit that to you. Anyone in NFTs who tells you that they're an expert is lying through their teeth. This is literally basically a two year old industry.
00:19:14.760 - 00:19:51.406, Speaker C: And so, I don't know, this is where I feel comfortable today is I don't feel comfortable owning more than 5% of a collection usually, and not always, but usually for it to matter. For our sized fund, owning one to two to three to. At most, 5% is like a good place to be in terms of like, okay, we own a significant percentage where interest aligned with the founders of the project and the community. And. But we can get some excise returns. And also, like, what's really nice is, I think this is a challenge with NFTs versus coins, is actually like, you know, most coins, right? What supply do you have? A million? A billion like, however many coins are in circulation, they're very divisible. Right.
00:19:51.406 - 00:20:37.520, Speaker C: But NFTs for most investors aren't, right? So if you want to buy a crypto punk right now it's $125,000. Let's say that that goes one hundred twenty five thousand dollars to one hundred eighty thousand dollars. You can't take $125,000 off because you need to sell the whole punk. As a trader, I much prefer to be in a position where if something runs up, I can sell part of my position, but not all of it. Inherently, that means that I need to own multiple of the same collection. This is one of the benefits to being a fund versus like, it's actually really nice as managing a fund now versus when I was trading individually, is that as a fund manager, I can have trim exposure. If I want to trim 10% of my crypto punks position, I can do that because I own many, many punks.
00:20:37.520 - 00:20:42.736, Speaker C: And so this makes sense if that is a good frame of reference. Yeah.
00:20:42.760 - 00:21:06.474, Speaker A: And speaking of, obviously, as you mentioned, there's no playbooks yet, but I'm curious whether there are common practices arising because if you look at say like traditional equity portfolios, you're talking about hundreds of names for crypto portfolios. I think depending on your strategy and conviction and mandate, I think I've seen anywhere from like 30 names to maybe like ten names. So for a typical NFT portfolio now, how many collections do you have to own?
00:21:06.974 - 00:21:42.626, Speaker C: You know, I think the answer is you don't have to own anything, right. It kind of depends on like what you as a trader, what your goals are, what your like, thesis is, what your time horizon is. Right. I think that there's really two different types of exposure, and it's important to know which one you're looking for. One is do I want exposure overall to NFTs as they move as a percentage of global value? If you want to think about, okay, I think NFTs will outperform, say vanilla ETH or vanilla bitcoin or gold or stocks or whatever it is. And I just want exposure. I'm not going to day trade this, I'm not going to do anything.
00:21:42.626 - 00:22:13.122, Speaker C: I just want to index exposure essentially. Right. That's one type of thing you could do very well with a very small portfolio of one or two or maybe three different projects doing that. I don't think you need to go for breadth if that's what you want to do. I know a couple of people who, their entire portfolio is just crypto dick butts and honestly, that is, I know that sounds crazy, but that's a very reasonable portfolio allocation. They've outperformed, I would say, 90% of traders. Right.
00:22:13.178 - 00:22:13.530, Speaker A: Wow.
00:22:13.602 - 00:22:52.446, Speaker C: Now you might say, okay, actually the reason I want to get into nfts is because I see that there are these things, ten xing, five xing, and I want to make these quick flips. And my goal is to stack using nfts to trade. Right. And that's a very reasonable approach too. But the thing that you're going to have to do to realize that buying a crypto punk under that strategy, crypto punks, they may move here and there, but they've been relatively stable. Their volatility isn't super high and especially their volatility isn't high without the underlying price of ETH moving very significantly. If you're trying to get a ten x in two weeks, you shouldn't be trading crypto punks.
00:22:52.446 - 00:23:17.426, Speaker C: That's not the way to do it for someone with that kind of thing. I think one thing that I've seen a lot of traders in the NFT space make the mistake of is like being like, okay, I need to have this kind of returns. I need to find something in the market right now that fits this profile. It may just not exist. Right. And people can talk themselves into aping the wrong thing. Again, I'm going to go back to what I said earlier, which is my strategy is make money for my lp's.
00:23:17.426 - 00:23:27.042, Speaker C: Why? Because the environment changes so often and so frequently in nfts that like, that, the way to do that does also change very substantially.
00:23:27.098 - 00:23:27.578, Speaker D: Right.
00:23:27.706 - 00:24:03.508, Speaker C: And so I think strong opinions, loosely held, is a really important concept here where be patient, look for the right play. When you have conviction, ape with conviction, but don't feel like you need exposure to everything. That's the easiest way to lose money because if you look like most NFT projects go down as a function of time, if you're just like, yeah, I want indexed exposure to everything, you're almost guaranteed to lose money. And I think we have to come at this from the perspective too, of a very somber reality, which is that most of these products won't matter in the next cycle. Right. I would say if three matter in the next cycle, we've done really well. And you got to look at the last cycle.
00:24:03.508 - 00:24:22.116, Speaker C: Right. Both in crypto and in nfts. The last, the first cycle we had crypto punks and cryptokitties. If you held cryptokitties, they're worthless right now. If you held crypto punks, they're worth a ton. That was a great thing to have held, right? But it wasn't always obvious that would be the case. Similarly, I think back to litecoin in 2016.
00:24:22.116 - 00:24:50.124, Speaker C: Litecoin was supposed to be the thing. I know tons of people who, like, if you were getting an indexed portfolio of crypto at that time, you held probably just as much litecoin as you held ethereum. And now that sounds kind of ridiculous to say, but that was the thing to do then, and it was never obvious. But if you held a portfolio of litecoin, bitcoin and ETH, you did fine, right? Those were kind of like three reasonable ones. If you held a whole bunch of other shitcoins, the shitcoins changed, right. Each cycle. People like to look for new stuff.
00:24:50.124 - 00:25:16.654, Speaker C: So I don't know, it's kind of a mixed bag here. And I don't want to seem too doom and gloom, but I feel like there's a very. A lot of people lose a lot of money trading nfts, chasing the next, like, crazy pumping random thing. And that's like, not the right approach. Like, I think you should enter the space, figure out your long term thesis, figure out how you get into it, and then if you want to trade on momentum plays, trade on momentum plays. But, like, know that that is like pretty close to, like spinning a roulette wheel.
00:25:17.334 - 00:25:56.164, Speaker A: I think that's a really, really great point. And actually, that brings me to a question that I've had for a while, which is, how do you underwrite specific nfts? Because for crypto coins, for crypto assets, for instance, there's earnings that you can look at. Sometimes there's on chain activity that you can look at. But at least my layman's understanding is that a lot of nfts seem to be priced based on their cultural relevance. And it's almost like a recursive loop where the more valuable it is, the more eyeballs it has, the more culturally relevant it is and the more valuable it becomes. But how do you identify the flywheel? Well, first of all, do you agree that that's kind of like the flywheel that's driving value? And if so, then how do you identify something of value?
00:25:56.544 - 00:25:59.408, Speaker C: Kind of. Is it okay if I give a little bit of a long winded answer to this?
00:25:59.456 - 00:26:00.324, Speaker A: Yes, please.
00:26:00.744 - 00:26:33.744, Speaker C: Okay. So we're going to start at the very beginning because I think it's important to, like, quantify, talked a lot about nfts, but like, what are nfts? Right. So I'm going to give you a very simple overview of how crypto and how it's led to nfts. So in the beginning there was bitcoin, right? And what is bitcoin? Bitcoin is a big list of who owns how much bitcoin that is very secure and yada yada. And there's a functions that let you change how much on that list based on a set of rules, right? This is what bitcoin is. And there's logic around having an account which is called a wallet. This is like conceptually what bitcoin is now.
00:26:33.744 - 00:27:05.970, Speaker C: And I'm making broad strokes here, but come with me on this journey. So now, Ethereum is very similar to bitcoin, except ethereum is not just a list of who owns what. Ethereum. Ethereum has the functionality to be a list of who owns something else, right? And sometimes this something else is coins. This is why we look at like, l, two s, et cetera. But what is very interesting is what if this something else is what we call an NFT, right? And very often people mistake nfts. Oh, they're just digital pictures.
00:27:05.970 - 00:27:43.378, Speaker C: Well, no. So this something else, we're going to assign a picture to it so we kind of can track it and it's easy to think about what it is. But really this something else is an access token, right? And so what does this access token do? Well, for a while, no one really knew what to do with this tech, right? But I think a big, and we saw cryptokitties, you saw punks, this was art, okay? We know this will be a big technology. Eventually the original thing is going to be valuable. That's kind of what crypto punks are, right? There was an on chain art movement where it's like, okay, we can do generative art. This is what, like fidenzas and art blocks is what that is. But what was very interesting was Boredap club, bored API club came in and say, hey, two things.
00:27:43.378 - 00:28:08.490, Speaker C: One, this is actually, you are going to own the intellectual property for the ape that you have, and you have the right to make derivatives of that, et cetera. So it's IP ownership on chain. This is the connection to the picture. But also we're a private social club. This is an interesting paradigm. Now, a lot of people copied that. You saw cool cats, kind of was another one that had that thesis.
00:28:08.490 - 00:29:01.314, Speaker C: Currently, pudgy penguins, I think, also has a strong IP thesis, right? We also saw a virtual real estate thesis emerge, right? So there's going to be a metaverse and these NFTs will represent parts of the digital land that you own in the metaverse, right? Like now, we've also seen video games where video games say, hey, in game assets are, are these nfTs? Here's what you're going to own is these NFTs. But really, there's a lot of different use cases. And much like we're very early in what an NFT fund is, or much really, really very early still in what an NFT is, I would say the most successful use case thus far in the last cycle is, as you pointed out, digital luxury. So one concept that I think a lot about, and this may be me being a little weird personally, but I'd much rather own a bored ape and drive a Toyota Camry than I would drive a Rolls Royce and not own a board ape.
00:29:01.354 - 00:29:01.650, Speaker D: Why?
00:29:01.722 - 00:29:28.422, Speaker C: A couple of reasons. One, as soon as I drive the Rolls Royce off the lot, it depreciates 30% in value, and over time, it continues to depreciate. Maybe it's a classic car at some point, but in general, cars go down in price. Also, if I get into an accident, if someone steals it, et cetera, it's gone. Now, people can steal nfts, there's fishing, etcetera. But in general, I feel much more like, stable. Having my luxury contained to a digital thing that I own.
00:29:28.422 - 00:29:56.420, Speaker C: Now, obviously a bourdie probably also fluctuates in price a lot more, and this is the crypto element to it. But when I think about luxury spend, in general, I think of it mostly consumptive. I don't usually buy, say, a Gucci or Versace or whatever. I mean, I don't usually buy these things, but when I do, I don't buy them to say, oh, well, this is an investment. Right. But really what I think is kind of interesting to me is where do we interact a lot? Right. Well, people say the metaverse is coming.
00:29:56.420 - 00:30:37.680, Speaker C: The metaverse is coming, and maybe the metaverse is coming in the form of a 3d virtual environment that mimics real life. But I'm going to make the argument that the metaverse has already come. And one of the more common metaverses in our industry that we interact with is just Twitter. This is one of the reasons that early nfts in the last cycle was largely the ones you heard about the most. The ones that probably did the best were profile pictures that were mostly used on Twitter. Why? Because it's the same reason that people go to a nightclub in a Gucci or Versace shirt. The same reason they're wearing that hype wear brand because it's cool, or was cool at least to own one of these digital collectibles, flex it on Twitter, flex it in different circles.
00:30:37.680 - 00:30:58.386, Speaker C: And I think that that is kind of an interesting way to look at what nfts are currently. Now, I must admit I've lost your original question in this explanation, but I hope that this is like, at least an interesting way to think about it, just kind of what an NFT is, what was most relevant last cycle and kind of where we're at right now. Yeah.
00:30:58.410 - 00:31:12.464, Speaker A: And I think a great extension to that is how do you underwrite, maybe we can walk through specific examples as well. When you see, say, a board ape, how do you decide that this should be worth, you know, 50 ETH versus 100 ETH versus 200 ETH?
00:31:12.804 - 00:31:41.076, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think this is a very interesting thing. One thing that I think about NFTs, like, is we actually kind of have this concept in public markets, which is goodwill, right? So NFTs are kind of like trading goodwill without an underlying company. And I have a friend of mine who was, he used to run a multi billion dollar, multibillion aum public equities hedge fund. He left that hedge fund to go trade ETH. And I said, why would you ever do that? And he said, well, ETH is great. It's fun to trade.
00:31:41.076 - 00:32:08.544, Speaker C: It's like the S and P, but there's no earnings calls. Right. And I thought that was kind of a funny approach to look at this. I think it's hard to say that there's fundamental value in nfTs, but I actually think this is true of most assets, especially since the public markets have been decoupling from revenue, right. So you can't justify why is Tesla stock worth what it's worth based on, uh, its revenue? Just doesnt make sense, right. Amazon doesnt pay dividends. So Amazon is just kind of a shitcoin, right.
00:32:08.544 - 00:32:53.670, Speaker C: And so I think like, questioning revenue models of like, valuation models of public companies is, is rather important. Now, you might say, okay, but youre trading pictures of cats on the Internet, right? Like, this is clearly something different than Amazon, and ill agree with you on that. Right. So what do I look for? And this is sort of a slant from the venture world, is I look, uh, it's really important to me, the founders and the team, right. Because in one view of NFTs, NFTs are kind of like making, or they're kind of cults, and you're making a bet on a cult, right. And so the cult leader is very important. Uh, one of the things that I look for the most in NFT teams, uh, that I'm talking to or sort of researching on is do they have a thesis on the space? As I said, we don't know what the best use case of nfts are yet.
00:32:53.670 - 00:33:28.740, Speaker C: This is a two year old industry. A lot of stuff has failed. But what I want to be able to do whenever I make an NFT investment is I want to say, if the best use case of nfts is XYZ, then this project is the best exposure to that thesis, right? If I can't say that, then I'm just going to buy the one that does that is the best exposure to that thesis. Because at the end of the day, you're making thesis driven bets subdivided. Thesis driven bets. If it's digital luxury, maybe it's crypto punks, right? That's just the original one you saw. LVMH partnered with Tiffany's, did a drop with crypto punks.
00:33:28.740 - 00:33:59.294, Speaker C: There's a reason they went with that collection, right? Digital luxury. If you think sort of the asian luxury market is the big play here, Azuki has the best exposure to that, I think. If you want to say, okay, what's sort of the music nft thesis? That's probably doodles. I don't have a strong music nft thesis, which is why I don't hold doodles. But they've gone very hard music. They're partnered with Pharrell. If you want to say the IP thesis, I think you may say yuga Labs, I think pudgy Penguins is probably the strong one, strongest one there.
00:33:59.294 - 00:34:47.466, Speaker C: They're licensing a net licenser of their own IP from their holders to create CPG products. They're putting in Walmart. I think that's a pretty compelling way to approach that. And if you want to look at what metaverse and the metaverse and the 3d virtual environment sense, I think other deeds, Yuga Labs is pretty good exposure to that. And this is kind of like how you think about that. And then when you see a new project or a project that's up and coming or getting bigger, you really have to question, is this project able to win at least one thesis? And a, are they able to do that? B, do they even have a thesis? A lot of founders in the space are just like, yeah, I make a picture and it goes up in price, right? That usually, guess what does not go up in price. That's just usually not how this works.
00:34:47.466 - 00:35:08.774, Speaker C: That goes up maybe for a period of time, but this crashes and you never see that money again. It's gone. Doing the diligence. Who are these people? Are they really here to build for a while? And do they have a take? Do they have a thesis on what's going on here if they don't, again, it's surprising how many people don't and run these companies. I say run.
00:35:10.534 - 00:35:45.420, Speaker A: That makes sense. And I noticed that a lot of the things you mentioned just now are kind of qualitative, thesis driven stuff. I'm curious if there's a quantitative aspect to this as well, because one thing that one company that really benefited from NFTs was Nansen, which is the data company that allows people to track the on chain holders and on chain volumes and the P and L of specific on chain addresses that are trading NFTs. And seemed like a lot of people were using those type of data to make their NFT investment or trade decisions. Is quantitative data a part of your process? And if so, what type of data.
00:35:45.452 - 00:36:45.770, Speaker C: Do you look at a little bit now? I will. So the challenge here is this is because nfts in general have such a small market cap, and if you look at any, like, a lot of NFT collections have like, $25 million market caps, right. You always have to assume you're trading against whales, right. I think two of the most common groups of people that I see trading nfts are the under 30 category, and then the over 50 ex Wall street from before Wall street was regulated category. The problem with a lot of the statistics driven stuff is it's really easy to manipulate statistics and a lot of retail in the space trades using technical analysis, et cetera. You can, um. I'm not a big believer in ta, but I think, and, like, you should look at this data like, I do look at, like, holder concentration, right? As I said, if somebody else is holding, you know, in one wallet, like, a huge percent of a collection, that's usually not great.
00:36:45.770 - 00:37:29.366, Speaker C: Like, you don't want exposure to someone else being able to just sell the whole, their whole position. Like, you want to look at holder concentration. You know, one thing I also do look at is I look at volume as a function of announcements. So, like, do, is the community paying attention? Some other metrics that are worth looking at is how many NFTs have never moved since mint. So there's some collections that have effectively much lower circulating supplies than you think based on that. But, yeah, I don't know. I think in general, thesis driven investment does better, although you should look at volumes look at the number I look at the most is certainly volume and activity.
00:37:29.366 - 00:37:57.114, Speaker C: Like on days when someone just, you know, there's been days in certain projects where someone will go in, buy one to 2% of their collection that will just cause a price movement up of like ten to 20%. And it's often right to sell that right because, like, again, because there's low liquidity, it's very often that whales were either intentionally or unintentionally move price when they're trying to buy into collections. This is one of the most challenging things about managing an NFT fund, is thinking about my impact on the market.
00:37:57.194 - 00:37:57.746, Speaker D: Right.
00:37:57.890 - 00:38:25.060, Speaker C: This is something that I like. One of the reasons that I have launched an NFT fund, a small NFT fund in the bear market, is because I want to go into the bull market personally, understanding this impact more. This is one of the biggest things that I just am still learning as I go along, but have been getting a better and better sense of is, okay, I want to enter a one to 2% position in a project. What's the best way to do that? Over what period of time do I use bids? Do I market? Buy? And. Yeah.
00:38:25.092 - 00:38:52.374, Speaker A: So I think this is a good segue to talk about the broader market because I'm curious about how the liquidity for NFTs have changed, because in the beginning, obviously, you're buying specific nfts. But right now there's multiple ways to bet on nfts. There's NFT indices, there are fractionalized nfts, and I've lately seen perpetual spilled for nfts as well. So as a trader, as an investor in nfts, do these instruments matter to you? Do you use these instruments to bet on nfts as well?
00:38:52.794 - 00:39:32.412, Speaker C: Okay, so I will say the biggest shift in liquidity in the last year has been the introduction of blur marketplace. So blur marketplace, for those of you who don't know, is sort of a competitor to Opensea. They're currently crushing OpenSea. They have a token, and they've incentivized bids on collections as a way to earn their token. And this has provided a lot of liquidity depth to nfts that wasn't there. If you were in December or October of last year and you wanted to sell 70 board apes, you would probably have moved the price down 40% a few weeks ago. You could do that.
00:39:32.412 - 00:40:16.002, Speaker C: I had a couple of friends who sold 72 board apes in two clicks, and they got the full price there because there was just huge amounts of bid depth close to floor I don't think this environment will last too, too long where it's like that. But I do think this is like a foreshadowing of what's to come, where again, the more that we have market making, the more that we have market makers, the better it will be. Now, liquidity was way, way, way better in the bull market, right. This is one of the biggest challenges of the bear market is if you want to sell something and you're not selling it, especially for floor, floor being the cheapest price of collection. Good luck. It's tough. It'll take like weeks to months to do.
00:40:16.002 - 00:40:44.774, Speaker C: Now. I think this environment will change and I have some kind of mixed feelings on it. So you mentioned a couple of different products. I think a lot of the stuff that exists today has made nfts a lot more fungible in the sense of like, you have derivatives, you have sort of bids at floor, like having a rare item like doesn't fit as well into those kind of paradigms. And I don't love that about those products. I will also say that in general, the derivatives products have come. I think a lot of them are structured very poorly.
00:40:44.774 - 00:41:30.792, Speaker C: One of the big problems with perpetual swaps, and we've seen this even on GMX and the bigger ones in the coin market, is people have manipulated the price of ETH. They've taken large shorts out on GMX, leveraged shorts, then sold a bunch of ETH, caused ETH to go down and printed on the shorts. If you can do that with Ethereum, you sure as heck could do that with any NFT. Because again, these are low liquidity, small supply things that it's not too hard to move the price of collection by 20% to 50% if you really, really want to, especially if there's economic incentive to do so. When it comes to fractionalization, I'm going to be honest, I actually haven't seen a ton of that. I think there was a big move last year and a few years ago to daos that were in investment Daos and did not pan out very well. I think it makes sense why.
00:41:30.792 - 00:42:01.664, Speaker C: And it's because it's this idea that. Two ideas. One is if you ask the Internet to do something, don't be surprised what the Internet gives you. Have you ever heard of Bodie McBoatface? Actually the USS Bodie McBoat, yes. There was a Reddit poll, the US bought $100 million research vessel and they put a poll on Reddit to say what they would name it. And Reddit, the Internet, voted to name it the USS Bodie McBoatface, and it actually exists. And a lot of investment Daos made trades like that.
00:42:01.664 - 00:42:35.970, Speaker C: And one thing they like, another way to think about this too, is there's the paradigm of like, okay, if you go to dinner and before dinner, you agree that you're splitting the bill evenly, regardless of anyone orders. Everyone orders surf and turf and the champagne. Right. Well documented that people do this in an investment Dao. Very commonly what they would do is they would vote and they'd buy the most expensive thing in a collection for some ridiculously high price because it was cool and fun to do. So investment daos in general did not do very well. Also, it's very hard to run a more complicated strategy with an investment DaO.
00:42:35.970 - 00:42:58.884, Speaker C: Like, when I manage my fund, most of our, I split up our activity across a large number of wallets. Most of them are private. So people don't know which ones are our wallets. We have a few doxed ones. But I'm very transparent that I do not have full transparency in my holdings because, like, that would just be silly, right. You're clearly not optimized as a financial actor, moving with everyone knowing exactly what you're doing. Nobody does that in any market.
00:42:58.884 - 00:43:12.416, Speaker C: Right? This is not a thing. And so those products are challenging a lot of the other stuff. And even some investment daos have challenges of legality, right? Like, if you are fractionalizing an NFT, this is mostly unambiguously a security.
00:43:12.600 - 00:43:12.944, Speaker D: Right?
00:43:12.984 - 00:43:55.096, Speaker C: And so I think a lot of the early efforts to do this, now there's two approaches. One is sort of take the cowboy, like, whatever the US approach, and the other, okay, I won't really comment there, but I think it's really hard, given the regulatory environment, to make structured product where you do fractionalize nfts. And also it's really hard to think about how do you liquidate, do you vote to liquidate, et cetera. So these things exist. But I don't know that this is like, I don't know how optimistic I am about a lot of these things. I don't know how, I don't see them currently having a very large market impact. I think what it is, and maybe is that these are products that traders like, that institutions may like longer run like it is.
00:43:55.096 - 00:44:25.892, Speaker C: It's interesting. I thought about, there isn't a good way to just hedge my portfolio, right? And structured products such as perpetual swaps may give us that. But I don't really think that today this has a huge impact. It may have a bigger impact in the next cycle. We'll see. You know, one thing that was funny was a lot of people that I knew who traded NFTs in the last cycles were actually just like quant traders at hedge funds because there was nothing in their, like, agreement with the funds they were working at that said that they couldn't trade nfts in their personal accounts. And I won't name which hedge fund.
00:44:25.892 - 00:45:23.524, Speaker C: There was a very well known quant hedge fund that I knew where there was the day of a big mint, one of their, like, vps came down, or one of the partners came down and said, why is nobody, you know, trading our stocks? And they were like, oh, we're claiming whatever, shitcoin. And they had this whole big sit down because it was like they were all, there was a couple of markets that I watched pop up that I knew who it was and it was these quant hedge fund guys just market making against each other. I was like, this is ridiculous, what's going on here? But that's interesting. You have some of the smartest people in the whole world that trading general assets, looking at nfts. This is what makes me so excited, is watching that behavior is like, look, I think the way that I see NFTs is, and people critique them, like, isn't this kind of dumb? And I say, yes, yes, it is. But I think that everything is kind of dumb, especially stocks. Especially, like, look, why is a dollar valuable? Because we say it is.
00:45:23.524 - 00:46:01.664, Speaker C: Because the US is a military. They print a bunch more of it, right? Why are public equities valuable? Well, some of them pay dividends, but most and most of the tech stocks don't. And so they're valuable because you just believe someone else will pay you for it eventually. And they probably will. But the core thing is people like to trade stuff, right? And people like structured markets where they can trade stuff in a way that makes sense to them and they don't have to worry about the underlying stuff in the same way. And so it is interesting to me, even if all the NFTs are digital luxury, are companies that are just the goodwill, most of what people trade on Wall street is goodwill anyway. And so I don't know that that is so bearish as a lot of people will make it out to be.
00:46:01.664 - 00:46:36.084, Speaker C: But I think, like, you know, people will trade things. Like, I have friends that trade weather futures tell me that that makes more sense than betting on profile pictures. And as you said, and I think you alluded to this, part of this is just like are they cool? And that's really hard to quantify, really hard to figure out betting on what's going to be cool culturally in that unit of time. Right. But it's also fun and interesting. I think it's what drawn a lot of people to it. And when else do you have the volatility of sort of public private markets but, like, the accessibility of public markets? Like, I think this is a really interesting thing.
00:46:36.784 - 00:47:12.264, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think that is a phenomenal note to kind of close this out on as well, because I do think that this is this kind of absurdist take on all types of assets really, really makes a lot of sense. It really kind of helped me click things when I realized, wow, actually the concept of value is incredibly subjective, and NFTs is as subjective as it gets. So this is such an interesting a art form and very interesting craft to me when it comes to kind of investing in NFT. So I really want to thank you for coming on and explaining all of this for us and for listeners who want to, you know, keep up to date with what you're working on, with what Spencer Ventures is working on, what are the best channels for them to do this.
00:47:12.564 - 00:47:31.958, Speaker C: Yeah. So if you want to stay up to date with everything going on in my ecosystem, my website is Spencer. That's Spencer dot v c, that's victor Charlie, and my Twitter isand one. That's sgsand one. Yeah. Reach out. I'm excited to hear what people think about this episode.
00:47:31.958 - 00:47:59.206, Speaker C: And I have one last quickish rant if you want me to go on it, to close things out. But I don't feel the rest of the airtime. No, I love that. When I look back at what are some of the interesting things? If you're a crypto native person who's curious about nfTs, why do these matter? Well, there's sort of an interesting regulatory thing here that's going on, and it's that NFTs feel a lot like trading cards. Right. And so, and collectibles. And so this collectible collectible angle complicates the idea of NFTs as securities.
00:47:59.206 - 00:48:38.882, Speaker C: Now, what are the biggest wins of the NFT space so far? Well, I would say apecoin, which was an airdrop to bored apes, was the biggest win. Why do I say that? Because what happened was apecoin got airdropped to the bored apes and it didn't dilute the underlying price of the bored apes. And it had a $7 billion market cap at launch. It got as high as like $23 billion market cap without diluting the underlying collection. Why? Because it's completely different liquidity that trades NFTs than that trades these coins. And the coin, importantly, was traded on a custodial marketplace, was on Coinbase, it was on NFTX, it was on binance. And all these things, all the hedge funds.
00:48:38.882 - 00:49:33.394, Speaker C: And if you're over $100 million in the US, you have to trade custodially everything you're doing. But most of these large coin funds can only trade custodial marketplaces, right? And so if you think, and so if you think about coins in the crypto space as sort of the equivalent of the public markets, but for the metaverse, then I see NFTs as the private markets, but for the metaverse, because many NFTs, and I think we'll see this in the next cycle, are building out brand value, band credibility, et cetera, et cetera. And rather than as a private company would ipoing, they then do a coin issuance and have different liquidity, which is different exit liquidity for their holders. And importantly, unlike in a private investment, when I do a venture investment, it goes public. I don't get to then sell the private stock as well as the public stock. However, in NFTs, when an NFT does a token airdrop, you get to sell the underlying NFT, which usually does very well after a token airdrop if it's well received. And then you also get to sell the coin that you were airdropped.
00:49:33.394 - 00:49:49.834, Speaker C: Right. And so if all you think nfts are is that, I still think that's a very compelling thesis for the NFT market. And it's one of the biggest things that I look for actually in NFT collections is are they going to do an ERC 20 token? And do I believe that they can get that ERC 20 token exchange listed day one?
00:49:50.334 - 00:50:01.718, Speaker A: So the option value for nfts to have a liquid token is important as well. So I think that that's homework for me. I'm going to go back and find out a list of nfts that might have token airdrops in the future and see if they're interesting.
00:50:01.886 - 00:50:05.118, Speaker C: Very cool. Well, I hope your listeners enjoyed, and thank you so much for having me.
