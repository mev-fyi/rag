00:00:02.120 - 00:00:08.794, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, gentlemen, welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto.
00:00:14.694 - 00:00:36.154, Speaker B: And before we get started, just a reminder for you guys out there. The Blockcrunch podcast is intended for informational purposes only. Neither the host nor its guests are licensed financial advisors, and nothing discussed should be construed as financial advice. Views held by blockcrest guests are their own, and sponsorship messages do not constitute financial advice or endorsement. With that out of the way, let's jump right in.
00:00:36.234 - 00:00:50.298, Speaker A: Today's episode of the Blockcrunch podcast is brought to you by Protocol Labs, the team behind Filecoin. So to tell us a little bit more is Colin Efren, who leads ecosystem at protocol Labs. So, Colin, can you tell us what's one thing that people misunderstand about Filecoin the most?
00:00:50.386 - 00:01:43.046, Speaker C: One thing people don't realize is that the launch of smart contracts on Filecoin in Q one of this year will transform the Filecoin network into the world's largest just open data economy and a full fledged layer one within web3. Most people think of Filecoin as the world's largest decentralized storage network. And while that's true, the community onboarded 450 petabytes of real data in 2022, up 18 times from the beginning of last year. Q one of this year is transformational. The community is launching the Filepoint virtual machine, where users can start writing programs to automate storage and renewal of data, pay for computation, and trigger retrievals, all of which is built on a permissionless market of hardware providers that is 15 exabytes in size. This will open the world's largest data economy and make Filecoin one of the most powerful layer one blockchains in web3.
00:01:43.150 - 00:02:21.722, Speaker A: Hello there. Now, before I move on, I'd love to thank the hundreds of you who have subscribed to blockchain vip, because with your support, I've been able to share my real thoughts on specific projects that I don't usually share, on interviews in a format that I enjoy more, which is bi weekly written posts. We've also been able to offer exclusive AMA's sharing my investment frameworks, interactable models, and breaking down important trends before they become big. Now, we even had Elon Musk comment on one of our threads recently. So if you haven't already, head on over to theBlockcrunch.com vip and you can access dozens of hours of research for what you'd spend on a coffee a day. Hey, everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast.
00:02:21.722 - 00:02:55.860, Speaker A: Now, over the past years, we've seen the who's who in finance enter crypto slowly but surely. And recently, I think the most notable example was the largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, filing for the bitcoin ETF. Now, our next guest is also from that world of the who's who and finance. Now, our next guest is an investor at Superscript, which is an early stage blockchain investment company founded by Temasek. Now, for those who may not be familiar with Temasek, it is a global investment company headquartered in Singapore that was founded 49 years ago. So with me today is Jacob from Superscript.
00:02:55.932 - 00:02:56.212, Speaker D: Great.
00:02:56.268 - 00:03:06.940, Speaker E: Thank you very much for having me. I feel very lucky to be here and great to chat with you, Jason. You've done a lot for the industry in terms of education, information, and. Yeah, happy to be here.
00:03:07.012 - 00:03:36.432, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks, man. I'm always excited to have fellow investors in Asia as well. I feel like there is a very big difference between asia based crypto investors and western based crypto investors in terms of what we look at, which we can dive into it as well. But before that, I'd love to get some context here, because obviously, crypto is a very small asset class by comparison to a lot of other things. And I know before this you were involved in architect as well, agricultural technology. So I'm curious, like, how did you make that transition into crypto? What drew you into crypto, and how did that lead to superscript?
00:03:36.528 - 00:04:22.502, Speaker E: Yeah, great question. So my background has always been sort of more the traditional finance route in banking and consulting and then working in Agritech at Masek. I think what really appealed to me with crypto was that in my personal life, I was just exploring, researching what this whole paradigm was. I was pretty late to it because I always sort of steer clear from all the headlines that you see about hacks and scams and all of these things. And there's a lot of noise out there on what bitcoin was and what Ethereum was. But I think as I started to practically apply myself and play around with it, like using wallets. And with the advent of smart contracts coming out on the Ethereum blockchain, I started experimenting more there.
00:04:22.502 - 00:05:05.198, Speaker E: And I realized very quickly that this was really a new paradigm, right? It was kind of adding the infrastructure and rails that basically allow people to attach value to the activities that they do online, whether it's creating a program, whether it's interacting with different people, transferring value, sharing things. And that's when I really fell down the rabbit hole. And I started experimenting a lot with some of the DeFi protocols that started emerging. The other blockchains like finance, smart chain, polygon, and Solana, and just fell really in love with it. And I guess you could say from there, I made that transition from farming to yield farming in terms of my career.
00:05:05.326 - 00:05:24.864, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's exciting. And I'm always excited to see large players in traditional finance enter the crypto space. And obviously we know that superscript and Temasek are separate entities, but it was founded by Temasek. So I'm curious, like, how did that story happen? Like, when did you guys start? And when did you guys kind of spin out and decide, hey, we need a separate entity to focus on early stage.
00:05:24.944 - 00:05:25.248, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:05:25.296 - 00:05:31.952, Speaker E: So I think crypto is a very specific and very, in many ways, niche to begin with. Industry.
00:05:32.088 - 00:05:32.360, Speaker D: Right.
00:05:32.392 - 00:05:34.048, Speaker E: It moves lightning fast.
00:05:34.216 - 00:05:37.192, Speaker D: You have to be very pretty much.
00:05:37.248 - 00:06:15.886, Speaker E: On the cutting edge and at the cold phase to really understand what's going on. And that means playing around with contracts. That means embedding yourself in the communities, Twitter Discord, GitHub, developer groups, and doing that is quite difficult to do from a larger institution. You just simply need to be a lot more nimble to get the insights on how technology like this could displace other investments or even be a look into how people actually interact and exchange value in the future. You really need to go earlier. And so I think that's where this concept was born from. We're very fortunate Tamar succeeded at our company.
00:06:15.886 - 00:06:40.596, Speaker E: We're independently managed. We make our own decisions as to where to invest, and our stage is much earlier. So we're looking at seed, pre seed, sometimes series a investments with a view to learning as much as possible, finding the best opportunities, but being really plugged into the communities, developers build their ecosystem, which you just won't be able to do working from a larger organization.
00:06:40.740 - 00:07:08.784, Speaker A: I guess from a timing perspective, I think you guys started in a time when I think a lot of people are probably skeptical of crypto, and you guys are being active in the time, and a lot of people are saying, hey, the opportunities are probably, like, fading. And we recently saw the news that I think Sequoia cut down the size of the crypto fund as well. So amidst all of this, like, what is, or what are some things that continues to give you conviction, or has that changed from what made you guys decide to spin out superscript in the first place?
00:07:08.864 - 00:07:19.592, Speaker E: No, I don't think so. I think we see that this technology, while it's new, and therefore because it's new. There are many things that need to improve. It's here to stay in our view.
00:07:19.648 - 00:07:20.744, Speaker D: At least at superscript.
00:07:20.864 - 00:07:48.128, Speaker E: That is the conviction that we have. We definitely believe that this is emerging in terms of having decentralized systems, structures, applications. They're really here now, and they will be alongside some of the centralized options that we have, Facebook, Google, Amazon, so on and so forth. It's important that we have these alternatives because there are a few things that.
00:07:48.216 - 00:07:51.000, Speaker D: The trends that we continue to see to happen, right?
00:07:51.112 - 00:08:21.284, Speaker E: So for example, I think it's becoming very clear now that people realize that value can and should sometimes accrue to users in the community as well. If you're a stakeholder, if you contribute to an ecosystem, then some of that value should come back to you. And it's a different kind of setup than necessarily accruing to a monolithic, centralized provider. They still have their place, of course, but it is definitely a trend that's coming out. The other thing also is that as we've seen, especially in the last decade.
00:08:21.444 - 00:08:23.660, Speaker D: It'S increasingly important for us to be.
00:08:23.692 - 00:08:54.484, Speaker E: Aware of who controls our information and data. And really that should be us to some degree. And having the option and ability to do that is something that web3 rails or blockchain provides. So these trends are not going to go away. And then there's a couple more sort of trends that are still sort of moving in that direction, like having more efficient and faster payment settlement rails, right. Which blockchains theoretically help do. That's going to reduce the cost of doing business.
00:08:54.484 - 00:09:02.644, Speaker E: Imagine with smart contracts you automate some of the business relationships that you have rather than have it be manual.
00:09:03.104 - 00:09:08.294, Speaker D: And so all of these things, we feel will continue to be trends that.
00:09:08.424 - 00:09:42.176, Speaker E: Support the emergence of blockchains. Now you alluded to a few things, right? Like there have been a lot of problems. The user experience and the user interface is not fantastic. We've had quite a few scandals, of course, and most of them have been driven on the decentralized exchange side of things or the centralized players. But there have been decentralized hacks as well. And I think that these are growing pains of a very new paradigm, and we're here to sort of invest and support teams that can help solve some of these problems.
00:09:42.280 - 00:10:30.042, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think we talked a little bit about this before we started recording as well. But there just anecdotally seems to be a difference between what us or western based investors look at and what Asia based investors look at. I've noticed that a lot of western funds, the OG crypto funds that started in like 2017, 2018, a lot of them are still investing in like L1 S and L two s. But you look at Asia funds portfolios, a lot of them are full of applications and consumer facing things, which I personally find more interesting at this point in Crypto's lifecycle and to understanding. I think Superscript has made at least 15 investments and a lot of these span anywhere from tooling wallets and social apps. What I thought was interesting was there's not a lot of l one s and l two s. So I'm curious like if that's a deliberate choice and is that a firm focus to only mostly look at apps?
00:10:30.148 - 00:11:07.992, Speaker E: I don't think it's a deliberate choice. I think what you outline is very true. In sort of the more western hemisphere of the world, there is perhaps a little bit more focus on technology research and infrastructure type projects. So that could be a new layer, one with a novel consensus mechanism or different technology to make things go faster. Essentially it could be L2 scaling solutions, it could be bridges, really technical stuff. We do actually invest in those areas because we do believe that infrastructure needs to improve over time. I think also we recognize that applications and use cases need to emerge for crypto because we're so early.
00:11:07.992 - 00:11:51.444, Speaker E: We've had a couple of them do really well, like defi NFTs, Socialfi gaming is sort of making its way slowly. It made a huge explosion, but of course these things take time. But ultimately we've started looking into more user applications as well, because ultimately you need, you need to support some teams to build something that will bring more people on chain. So it's a roundabout answer, but I think you need to do both. To date, we focused a little bit more on what we coin infrastructure. So like wallet and developer tools, because you need good wallets to get people to have a really nice and easy experience and onboard to be able to access blockchains. You need developer tools and community tools so that more people can create.
00:11:51.444 - 00:12:00.810, Speaker E: And when you have more people creating, then maybe they create adapt, maybe they create some kind of novel use case and from there we can start to expand even more.
00:12:00.882 - 00:12:01.642, Speaker D: Yeah, and I'd love to kind of.
00:12:01.658 - 00:12:46.602, Speaker A: Dive into that because, you know, on the show we spend a lot of time talking about infrastructure. Sometimes we bring on individual projects, but we never really got a chance to dive into a broader portfolio of applications and see how investors are thinking about the space. And in particular, I'm interested in like the social consumer slash creator economy type of companies that you guys invested in. So, for instance, you guys invested in a company called Open, which is this super app that integrates all aspects of nfts from creation to minting. I believe the founder was also previously a co founder of Ada Rising, which for the hip hop fans out there as a well known asian american record label. So can you talk a little bit about op three n or open? What led you guys to invest in that? And why is now the right time to build something like this?
00:12:46.698 - 00:13:43.406, Speaker E: As with most things, it's early. Right? There is a chance that some of these things don't work out. But I think open was an interesting and intriguing one for us because of that background of the founder having had his roots in entertainment and some of the ip that's there, we felt that at least gave him a shot in terms of having a bit of a content advantage in accessing quality content that then they would have to turn into a compelling platform for fans to use and engage with the celebrities and the stars and the entertainment guys that they like. This is one potential use case of web3, which is connecting you more directly, allowing you to have a more intimate relationship with some of these stars, and sort of disintermediating a little bit some of the platforms that there weren't really great avenues to have a direct one on one relationship.
00:13:43.470 - 00:13:45.424, Speaker D: As to whether it's the right time.
00:13:45.724 - 00:14:15.542, Speaker E: Right now, the jury's still out. I think obviously part of it is also to do with macro in the markets. And when those things happen, sometimes a lot of the attention gets sucked out and then people aren't using blockchain or crypto rails as much as they were during an exciting time. So during this time, that's when heads down, you keep building that platform out, and then once it becomes more ready and more people come back into using blockchain, they'll realize that, oh, actually, there are these unique ways in which I.
00:14:15.558 - 00:14:19.114, Speaker D: Can interact with what I like. Right.
00:14:19.414 - 00:14:21.870, Speaker E: And that's why we thought that was an interesting one.
00:14:21.942 - 00:14:49.156, Speaker A: Yeah. And I wonder if this is part of a broader trend of creators verticalizing to building their own platforms as well. Because we see this even outside of web3. I think a lot of artists are trying to start their own streaming platforms. I think you have folks like Jay Z starting their own platforms a while back. And then in web3, even here in Singapore, I think there's a project called Ark, which is NFT community project. One of the co founders is a famous pop singer, JJ Lin as well.
00:14:49.156 - 00:15:03.364, Speaker A: So I'm curious, like how much attention do you guys pay to this creator led platform development trend? Do you think that is something that is uniquely enabled by web3 or something that web3 can enhance in some way?
00:15:03.524 - 00:16:09.400, Speaker E: So we're predominantly an infrared tech investor, but we always have our eye to use cases. For example, open was a special one because we typically don't go down deep into that side. But what I will say is that the reason why this is important is because it's creating an avenue from which creators can really sort of access value more directly if they are able to create content for their fans directly and good content. Because if you don't create good content, then obviously that's not going to resonate well with your fans. But if you can do that, then you kind of displace those traditional platforms, a lot of the ones that are out there, like YouTube, nothing against them. The great thing about those platforms is they've got a lot of eyes and a lot of users, but their take rate, because they have that mass scale, they can afford to have a higher take rate than some of these more artists controlled venues or more web3 type controlled venues. To me, I feel it's a use case that is so early that it's a bit of an experimentation stage.
00:16:09.400 - 00:16:16.616, Speaker E: But if it really takes off, then it could really unlock more value going to both the user and fans as.
00:16:16.640 - 00:16:18.560, Speaker D: Well as the creators, I guess moving.
00:16:18.592 - 00:16:48.204, Speaker A: Away from creator platforms, because I know you have a strong interest in wallets as well. This is an area in crypto that I've always had trouble trying to figure out because we've had so many great wallet experiences. For instance, Argent came out in 2019. Amazing wallet, social recovery, all those things before smart contract wallets were a big thing. But then, for some reason, nobody seems to be able to dethrone metamask. Everybody's still using metamask, and everybody hates metamask. So I'm curious, like, what are the ways for wallets to, you know, for new wallets to.
00:16:48.204 - 00:16:54.028, Speaker A: To win here? Or is that, like, already too mature of a market with too strong of an incumbent for anyone to disrupt?
00:16:54.156 - 00:16:56.164, Speaker D: That's a really good question. You know, we.
00:16:56.244 - 00:17:16.532, Speaker E: We've been going through a journey with our wallets and thinking on investment and thinking on wallets. So what I do believe is that first movers have a great advantage. You've seen that with Metamask, we've seen that with Phantom on Solana. Even though technically they weren't the first wallet, they were the first one that really came on strong during Solana's rise.
00:17:16.588 - 00:17:18.132, Speaker A: First one was solit, right? From.
00:17:18.228 - 00:17:33.773, Speaker E: Yeah, it was like Solat or something like that. And then there was solflare and a few other ones. So I do believe that there's a lot of sort of incumbent advantage that comes with being seen as the wallet of choice there, and people will flock towards that because that's what everyone is using.
00:17:34.433 - 00:17:37.689, Speaker D: So in reality, wallets are a good.
00:17:37.721 - 00:17:44.025, Speaker E: Business if you can be one of those players. But for some blockchains, that time has already passed, especially on Ethereum.
00:17:44.089 - 00:17:47.065, Speaker D: Metamask is dominant there, and they've got.
00:17:47.089 - 00:17:55.776, Speaker E: A lot of order flow, same with Phantom to some degree. And they're also trying to expand to other blockchains from what I've seen. So for new wallets to come in.
00:17:55.800 - 00:17:57.664, Speaker D: There'S got to be an angle, right?
00:17:57.744 - 00:18:05.640, Speaker E: There's got to be a special feature that really captures the crowd's attention. Maybe you're a wallet that is focused.
00:18:05.672 - 00:18:08.472, Speaker D: On gaming, and there are certain kinds.
00:18:08.488 - 00:18:13.216, Speaker E: Of features or profiles that you have. Maybe there is a certain kind of.
00:18:13.240 - 00:18:15.752, Speaker D: Wallet that caters towards certain types of.
00:18:15.768 - 00:18:49.944, Speaker E: Geographies, and you're able to cater to those preferences. So one of the historical things that I look at is if you look at Google, it's a very simple interface. It's just a search box and that's it. But if you look at the korean search engines, it's literally a search box and like a thousand different things, because that, culturally, is how that market loves to search for things. They love to be able to see a lot of things in one place. So could a wallet succeed on some of these more tailored and specific features? Probably, and possibly, but it is a very competitive space.
00:18:50.104 - 00:18:50.804, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:51.464 - 00:18:52.936, Speaker E: The second thing I'll say on how.
00:18:52.960 - 00:18:55.964, Speaker D: Wallets succeed is maybe it's not wallets.
00:18:56.824 - 00:18:59.304, Speaker E: Maybe it's simply that you have an.
00:18:59.344 - 00:19:02.576, Speaker D: App that people love to use for.
00:19:02.600 - 00:19:06.200, Speaker E: Whatever reason, and you have a wallet that's attached on the back of that.
00:19:06.392 - 00:19:08.728, Speaker D: People don't even know it's a crypto wallet.
00:19:08.856 - 00:19:18.208, Speaker E: It's just so seamless that suddenly you realize later on, oh, actually, I have this blockchain wallet on the back. It's non custodial and I can do whatever I want with it. I think a good initial, an early.
00:19:18.256 - 00:19:19.884, Speaker D: Example of this was like step in.
00:19:20.344 - 00:19:31.392, Speaker E: Because it was an app on the phone where I get paid to walk in GST and a token. But in reality, you had this wallet that seamlessly bolted onto the back and.
00:19:31.528 - 00:19:35.976, Speaker D: Suddenly that could become an app. So maybe the wallets of the futures.
00:19:36.000 - 00:19:37.976, Speaker E: Are just simply apps and good apps.
00:19:38.000 - 00:19:39.124, Speaker D: That people want to use.
00:19:39.624 - 00:20:01.942, Speaker A: No, I agree with that. And I think feature differentiation is controversial just because features rarely become a mode. Wallets can start other features. But I guess one interesting way you guys have expressed this view is to invest in Martian, which is the wallet for Aptos and Sui. So I guess being that first mover in a new ecosystem, is that kind of one of the ways to establish that mode that you see?
00:20:01.998 - 00:20:24.438, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that was what our viewpoint was with Martian. Really great team, very young and nimble. They are the most popular wallet on the Aptos ecosystem by a long way. If you do believe that Aptos will succeed as layer one, then they've got a great shot at it because they were there first. Now there's other wallets that will compete, but our bet is on a team.
00:20:24.486 - 00:20:27.950, Speaker D: There that's made it a good product early on.
00:20:28.022 - 00:21:01.810, Speaker A: And I think to put this in more concrete terms as well, I think another example of a company you guys invested in is mSafe, which is the first multisig build on move, which obviously allows you to use it on Aptos and Sui. So it's quite interesting. I'm curious in terms of whether you guys decide to invest. So there will always be newer l one size is the move to try to get into the first wallet on each of these potential ecosystem, try to maximize your optionality? Or how do you decide this is an ecosystem that we want to invest in the l one on? Or this is the ecosystem where we want to invest in the wallets for?
00:21:01.882 - 00:21:08.674, Speaker E: Yeah, great question. So it's not always easy because l one s typically come with a higher valuation.
00:21:08.834 - 00:21:09.346, Speaker D: Right?
00:21:09.450 - 00:21:23.826, Speaker E: Because they sell the idea that they will bring an ecosystem, users, maybe enterprises will come on board. And so typically the valuations are pretty high. And once they start to reach that, depending on the number, then they start.
00:21:23.850 - 00:21:25.770, Speaker D: To move out of seed, typical seed.
00:21:25.842 - 00:22:03.438, Speaker E: And series a ranges. So we have to be disciplined and we are. And so that also is part of the reason why maybe we haven't been focused a lot on layer ones. But what we do think is very important is to build relationship with layer one at their foundations to understand what are some of the promising projects that are out there and building on top of them. Occasionally we might put a small check into, let's say, a layer one at a higher valuation so that we can get access, build that relationship, and then start looking at some of the seed more venture type investments. But that is the way we would look at it in terms of jumping into the first wallet.
00:22:03.486 - 00:22:07.754, Speaker D: I think it's not just that. It also has to be the team.
00:22:08.654 - 00:22:24.742, Speaker E: There is a strategy that I've seen other investors, not necessarily VC funds, but other investors employ where they're like first energy, NFT marketplace on Aptos. Put a check in first, Dex first. That's not really the way we play it. It's more wallets are a good opportunity.
00:22:24.878 - 00:22:26.234, Speaker D: This team is solid.
00:22:26.654 - 00:22:36.846, Speaker E: And because they have made a splash as the first wallet and are constantly building applications, sorry, building features, we think that this is a good team to.
00:22:36.870 - 00:22:37.534, Speaker D: Make a bet on.
00:22:37.614 - 00:23:15.816, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's interesting because what you said sounds like an obvious strategy, but it wasn't so obvious, I think back in 2021, 2022, when everyone was being highly rewarded immediately for being the first mover on any chain. And I think a lot of investors based entire strategy on just like spreading across as many ecosystems as possible and investing in the first x on x chain. And so for myself, I make it deliberately a point to not do that because I know that that's going to dilute your returns a bit and you kind of end up just spraying and praying a lot. So I really appreciate that. The point about looking at actually the team behind the product, especially because can.
00:23:15.840 - 00:23:18.656, Speaker D: Be competed away, it's a range of factors.
00:23:18.760 - 00:23:22.840, Speaker E: It can't just be sort of first in best dress. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:23:22.952 - 00:23:55.326, Speaker A: And you mentioned that there are a lot of interesting use cases now and then. The two specific ones you mentioned are like DeFi and NFTs. I guess playing Devil's advocate here as a mainstream kind of non crypto native person looking into crypto now, all they see are like DeFi security problems with the recent curve exploit, with millions of dollars being lost for liquidity providers in NFTs, they see all these scams and speculation. It seems like from the outside, the only use cases that I've taken on in crypto are gambling speculation or fraud related.
00:23:55.470 - 00:23:57.558, Speaker D: So I'm curious, first of all, do.
00:23:57.566 - 00:24:01.814, Speaker A: You agree with that? And second of all, what can we do to change that perception of crypto?
00:24:01.934 - 00:24:04.406, Speaker E: Yeah, I do agree that there is.
00:24:04.430 - 00:24:09.482, Speaker D: An issue with there being fraud issues.
00:24:09.578 - 00:24:14.698, Speaker E: Hacks, so on and so forth. But I do also think that it is because we are early and a.
00:24:14.706 - 00:24:17.014, Speaker D: Lot of the infrastructure is being built right now.
00:24:17.994 - 00:24:38.842, Speaker E: Even if you look at the way that web two progressed over the years, is UI UX improved over time? Those cycles took five to ten years each time something went from the web one type client interfaces to the Windows 3.195 of the world and then moving from there across the iOS and mobile apps.
00:24:38.898 - 00:24:39.258, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:39.346 - 00:24:41.434, Speaker E: Those waves took 510 years each time around.
00:24:41.474 - 00:24:41.866, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:41.970 - 00:24:48.522, Speaker E: I'm not saying it's going to take that long for crypto. It's hard to have a crystal ball to gaze, but we have to understand.
00:24:48.578 - 00:24:51.482, Speaker D: That that's how early we are in.
00:24:51.578 - 00:24:54.418, Speaker E: This type of technology cycle.
00:24:54.586 - 00:24:59.330, Speaker D: So that's my high level view, at least in terms of why we're seeing.
00:24:59.362 - 00:25:08.354, Speaker E: A lot of these things. As to the point about financialization and gambling, it's just one big casino. I would say that there's some merit to that.
00:25:08.394 - 00:25:08.954, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:09.114 - 00:25:16.738, Speaker E: You know, the very tricky thing about tokens is that you can't divorce tokens from blockchain technology.
00:25:16.906 - 00:25:19.254, Speaker D: They're sort of connected at the hip for now.
00:25:19.594 - 00:25:30.014, Speaker E: And once you have tokens, and because everything is permissionless, you can create liquidity pools and anyone can ascribe a value to it, and you can trade and barter and swap on any Dex.
00:25:30.394 - 00:25:32.454, Speaker D: So there will always be that element.
00:25:32.914 - 00:25:50.610, Speaker E: Of financialization of things, even nfts, which I really loved because it was like it took me back to collecting card game days, even that's moved to borrowing and lending financialization of nfts and having trading pools for nfts. So I do believe that that will.
00:25:50.642 - 00:25:54.614, Speaker D: Always be an undercurrent inside crypto in general.
00:25:55.234 - 00:26:13.408, Speaker E: But there are so many other things that we can use blockchain technology for. One of the things I'll mention is something solving the problem of identity, reputation and credentials. There's been a lot of noise about Worldcoin. I won't comment too much about that.
00:26:13.496 - 00:26:17.440, Speaker D: But what is important is that right.
00:26:17.472 - 00:26:32.884, Speaker E: Now, the way that you login online control your data, your identity is usually through login with Google, log in with Facebook, login with the web, two methods. Now, there's nothing wrong with that because it's very convenient, it works.
00:26:33.344 - 00:26:35.176, Speaker D: But going forward in the future, if.
00:26:35.200 - 00:26:40.312, Speaker E: You want to control some of your data, you want to control some of that information and reputation.
00:26:40.488 - 00:26:41.712, Speaker D: Wouldn't it be great to have a.
00:26:41.728 - 00:26:43.656, Speaker E: Fourth or fifth option, which is login.
00:26:43.680 - 00:26:46.512, Speaker D: Decentrally or login with your wallet, and.
00:26:46.528 - 00:26:50.592, Speaker E: Then from there you can bring your on chain credentials, which is made up.
00:26:50.608 - 00:26:52.616, Speaker D: Of the transactions that you made, the.
00:26:52.640 - 00:26:59.552, Speaker E: Swaps that you made. The fact that you voted on chain with some tokens to support something, the fact that you're part of a certain.
00:26:59.608 - 00:27:03.092, Speaker D: Dao, bring all that reputation and information.
00:27:03.188 - 00:27:11.100, Speaker E: With you outside of the web two area. So for us, we see like there's a lot of use cases that will.
00:27:11.132 - 00:27:13.932, Speaker D: Help unlock things so that value can.
00:27:13.948 - 00:27:17.332, Speaker E: Go back to users compunities and people can actually control their stuff.
00:27:17.468 - 00:27:54.042, Speaker A: And I want to go back to the point you made where you said blockchains and tokens are joined at the hip. I don't think people appreciate how significant it is that you said that. So obviously you're more crypto native than a lot of people I know. But having come from that, you know, who's who in Tradfi's world, that line is not a popular line just three years ago in Tradfi because the party line for tratfi was blockchains, not tokens, blockchains, not crypto. So I feel like there has been a slight shift in attitude towards tokens. Like people are starting to understand them as coordination mechanisms and not just for speculation. So I hope that's something that will continue to change.
00:27:54.042 - 00:28:05.306, Speaker A: But I'm curious, like do you see that in your circles in tratfi, in terms of the attitude being more open to the idea of tokens as being much more than just speculation tools?
00:28:05.410 - 00:28:14.818, Speaker E: Yeah, I will say that it is still very much a new paradigm that people have to get their heads around. And if you think about it, blockchain is actually a way to coordinate resources.
00:28:14.866 - 00:28:17.442, Speaker D: At its heart, it's a way to.
00:28:17.498 - 00:28:27.890, Speaker E: Incentivize behavior and then keep a network going to be able to do that. Of course you can use tokens to do that, right? But sometimes it's hard for people to fathom that.
00:28:27.962 - 00:28:29.434, Speaker D: So what?
00:28:29.474 - 00:28:43.694, Speaker E: That results in new ways to do things. Like we saw a constitution Dao, for example, which was a bunch of people coming together to try and buy the constitution. Now that didn't quite work out, but it coordinated people globally for an action.
00:28:44.634 - 00:28:50.050, Speaker D: And that undercurrent principle has gone through.
00:28:50.082 - 00:29:12.042, Speaker E: Things like DeFi protocols, making sure things are decentralized, that the community can vote. These are new concepts, right? Or I guess newer approaches to things that blockchain enables. And I think people just kind of need to understand that there is legitimacy behind that. Sometimes people will look at governance tokens and say, well, the value of them just goes down. I can't do much with them, but.
00:29:12.178 - 00:29:14.202, Speaker D: This is the start.
00:29:14.338 - 00:29:35.514, Speaker E: Tokens and tokenomics, the systems need to improve over time. There's got to be more that you can do than just governance. Maybe there's some kind of utility that's attached to it. I think a lot of teams are working on solving that. So personally for me I do think that tokens are important as an incentive mechanism and to underpin systems.
00:29:35.814 - 00:29:38.126, Speaker D: They can be abused and they have been abused.
00:29:38.230 - 00:30:15.686, Speaker E: So that is always something to worry about. The last thing I'll say is that some of the investments that we make, actually, most of them will take an equity stake where we can. Because sometimes tokens isn't the answer. You might invest in, let's say something that builds blockchain tools, but there's no need for a token because you're not really needing to incentivize behaviors. Supporting a company that creates really good tools for helping people build in crypto or web3, I think that's the other lens as well. It doesn't always have to be tokens, but tokens are helpful when you want to bootstrap a network and incentivize behaviors.
00:30:15.790 - 00:31:03.582, Speaker A: Speaking of incentivizing behavior, you mentioned the example of Constitution Dao. I found it interesting that I think, to my knowledge, you guys invested in two dao. One is Alliance Dao, which is a venture building DaO, and the other is PWN no more. These are actually investments that we share both of these investments. I love to touch a little bit on Pono more because not enough people know about them. So they're a white hat hacker Dao with a bunch of cybersecurity experts from very kind of pedigree backgrounds, and they automate the auditing or searching for vulnerabilities in Dapp code bases and dependencies. So I'm curious, like, how did you guys decide to invest in Pontnomore? And what is your general view on the current state of handling security in crypto, which seems like very reliant on auditing firms?
00:31:03.718 - 00:31:12.274, Speaker E: Yeah, this is a great question, and it goes back to what we were speaking before about how early we are and how it scares people out there.
00:31:12.854 - 00:31:16.270, Speaker D: Until we get security right, there will.
00:31:16.302 - 00:31:40.804, Speaker E: Always be a barrier to entry, not just for institutions. Forget institutions. It's just the everyday person, right. You know, right now, you put your money in a bank account in most countries in the world, you don't have to worry about it disappearing. But with crypto, you know, you put in a wallet, you could get hacked. If you put in a smart contract, that could be a vulnerability. I think it's probably a rite of passage that most of us in this space have experienced this in one way or the other.
00:31:40.804 - 00:31:45.844, Speaker E: This was part of the motivation for backing a team like Po Norman.
00:31:46.464 - 00:31:48.232, Speaker D: They, you know, and what we liked.
00:31:48.248 - 00:32:07.772, Speaker E: Was that they have various backgrounds with respect to hacking and participating in these capture the flag contests with large organizations like Microsoft. I think a couple of them have won a few of these things, and the whole idea of a white hat Dao is that, listen, when someone writes.
00:32:07.788 - 00:32:12.580, Speaker D: A smart contract because it's decentralized, anyone.
00:32:12.612 - 00:32:18.504, Speaker E: Can try and find a breach. And that's scary, because you only know what you know.
00:32:19.954 - 00:32:25.434, Speaker D: Sometimes an attack usually comes from a very novel place.
00:32:25.594 - 00:32:43.522, Speaker E: And even if you automate some of the solutions to look out for those vulnerabilities, you're not going to catch everything. And so that's why having a dao or a team of people that have done this before that know how to look for vulnerabilities, having a team like that be able to apply that sort.
00:32:43.538 - 00:32:45.570, Speaker D: Of thinking around how to attack a.
00:32:45.602 - 00:32:48.114, Speaker E: Certain contract, I think that is interesting.
00:32:48.154 - 00:32:51.396, Speaker D: Because that enables us to hopefully spot.
00:32:51.540 - 00:32:54.892, Speaker E: Problems and then go out and see if we can help solve some of.
00:32:54.908 - 00:32:57.460, Speaker D: Them on the automated part of it.
00:32:57.612 - 00:33:07.308, Speaker E: Again, automation is not going to catch everything, but a lot of the mistakes that happen, like reentrancy attacks that are in the code, sometimes the basic people know about them.
00:33:07.356 - 00:33:10.820, Speaker D: It's just that for whatever reason, someone didn't spot it.
00:33:10.932 - 00:33:14.622, Speaker E: Automation can catch some of those more commonly known problems.
00:33:14.708 - 00:33:50.842, Speaker A: Yeah, and I'm all for supporting any project that helps add to the security of the space. Even if they're like, you know, open source tools that are not profit seeking, I think those are very worthwhile to back. And Jacob, I'd love to kind of wrap up the interview by talking about the higher level here, which is this meta around Asia. So for years, people have tried to pit Asia against the west. I'm always a little bit against this because Asia is so big and so diverse. You know, China, Korea, completely different markets, Singapore, Hong Kong differently as well. So I'd like to zoom in a little bit and just focus on Hong Kong and Singapore, because these two places have always been touted as kind of the crypto hubs of Asia.
00:33:50.842 - 00:34:26.750, Speaker A: And throughout COVID, there has been a little bit of back and forth. There are a lot of people moved from Hong Kong to Singapore, and then Mas didn't really have any clear, I think, guidelines on exchanges, and Hong Kong was trying to push for that, and then Singapore is pushing back. So there's always been a little bit of tension between the two ecosystems competing to be the crypto capital of Asia. So I'm curious, like, do you think that that's actually what's happening? Is Hong Kong and Singapore competing to be crypto capital of Asia? Do they even care about crypto at this stage? And where would you spend? If you're a founder, where would it make more sense to startup base.
00:34:26.862 - 00:34:40.998, Speaker E: Yeah, this is a great question. The short answer is that I would spend time in both, and I don't see them necessarily as competing cities. Right. If we think about the whole paradigm of crypto and web3, it's really borderless, and we should see it as.
00:34:41.046 - 00:34:45.710, Speaker D: That way, whether or not you want to do it east and west.
00:34:45.902 - 00:34:51.126, Speaker E: Hong Kong, Singapore, ultimately, all of these opportunities can be accessed anywhere in the.
00:34:51.150 - 00:34:52.474, Speaker D: World with a click of a button.
00:34:53.774 - 00:35:47.874, Speaker E: I do think that Hong Kong and Singapore consistently come up because they are both cities where a lot of capital coalesces around. Hong Kong attracts it from the north asian region, Singapore, the southeast asian region. Both also have got, from what I've seen, quite forward thinking regulators who are willing to have a stab at seeing what regulation and regulatory frameworks could look like. I think Hong Kong has grabbed the headlines with some of the things that they have done there on regulating exchanges and stable coins in particular. I think the difference is that Hong Kong is opening up the ability to market and sell directly to retail users. Singapore, they have the monetary Authority of Singapore, very forward thinking. And from what I've heard, speaking to teams, quite consultative as well, to understand how all of this works.
00:35:47.874 - 00:35:55.054, Speaker E: And they've also put together some consultation papers on stablecoins as well. So I think in general, the regulatory.
00:35:55.134 - 00:35:55.994, Speaker D: Landscape.
00:35:57.774 - 00:36:03.406, Speaker E: It'S good that we have people experimenting with frameworks. Other jurisdictions may or may not adopt.
00:36:03.430 - 00:36:05.230, Speaker D: It, but what we're seeing is that.
00:36:05.262 - 00:36:19.990, Speaker E: People are providing an example of what it could look like. We'll see how far that goes, but that's always a step in the right direction in terms of understanding that this is a real asset class, and there needs to also be safeguards in place.
00:36:20.062 - 00:36:20.462, Speaker D: Right.
00:36:20.558 - 00:36:43.814, Speaker E: From what we've seen with some of the implosions in the industry, and actually even from the decentralized part, forget just smart contract hacks. There needs to be some level of enforcement, or I guess, a way to remediate some of the hacks. That can happen, and there's got to be consequences. Otherwise these things will keep happening and no one will come on board.
00:36:43.934 - 00:36:45.696, Speaker D: From a regulation point, I think I.
00:36:45.720 - 00:36:54.488, Speaker E: Look at them both favorably in the sense that they give potential examples of how you could regulate in this industry.
00:36:54.616 - 00:37:36.388, Speaker A: I find it very fascinating that Hong Kong aggressively, at least on the government side, pushed for crypto after the implosion of FTX. My understanding is they realized, okay, wow, we don't have a clear framework here. We cannot allow the possibility of the next FTX setting up in Hong Kong skirting rules. So we're going to write down the rules, and if you break these rules and you become the next FTX, then this is kind of on you. So I think that that's having the attitude that's pushing them. For Singapore, it does seem like they're taking a slower, more, maybe more considered approach, given that they've always struck me as more kind of earlier to crypto than Hong Kong was in terms of friendliness to kind of crypto. And hopefully we will continue to see that as well.
00:37:36.388 - 00:37:53.508, Speaker A: But Jacob, really, really excited to have you on the show finally to talk about all of these interesting companies. And I think we share quite a lot of similar thoughts as well. And you know, being out here in Asia, I'm sure we're going to cross paths many, many times. So for people who want to keep following you or what super script is up to, what are the best channels for them to do this?
