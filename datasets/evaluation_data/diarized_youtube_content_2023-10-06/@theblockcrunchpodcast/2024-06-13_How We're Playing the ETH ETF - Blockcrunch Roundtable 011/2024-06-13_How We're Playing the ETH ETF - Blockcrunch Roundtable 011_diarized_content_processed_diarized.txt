00:00:00.160 - 00:00:40.972, Speaker A: A trader who was super excited about the ETH ETF and then just kept talking about okay, im so excited to long EtH beta. And the other person is just like okay, you can just buy a lot of ETH and the other person repeatedly says no, I need to find an ETH beta. And so I do think there is some level of delusion where were kind of obsessed with these betas. People have been pitching me stacks as bitcoin beta for the last year and a half and quite frankly, Sax has performed very well in the last year and a half. So maybe they were, they were on to something. But I think we spend a little too much energy looking for beta and we will spend the rest of this episode discussing some tokens that I think will do well. But I do want to caveat by saying I think like it's entirely possible that the major beneficiary of these flows is ETH.
00:00:40.972 - 00:00:43.564, Speaker A: Web Three offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:43.604 - 00:00:45.420, Speaker B: Our job is to buy great tech at great prices.
00:00:45.492 - 00:00:48.060, Speaker A: AI is also libertarian right enable use.
00:00:48.092 - 00:00:49.796, Speaker B: Case that people haven't been able to do today.
00:00:49.860 - 00:00:53.484, Speaker A: The next hundreds of millions of players, they will come to the market through mobile.
00:00:53.564 - 00:01:36.922, Speaker B: My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next twelve months is hey everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch Roundtable. It's me, your host, Jason Choi, and also my co host, Sanad from Dragonfly. Now, before we start, another thing we discuss is financial advice, and everything we discuss is not representative of our official opinions for our respective companies. So for today's episode, we want to talk about the ETh ETF. So a lot of people have mentioned a lot of different opinions about the ETH ETF, which just got approved, or at least the first part of it just got approved two weeks ago as of today's recording. But not many people have really talked about the implications of the ETF.
00:01:36.922 - 00:02:15.946, Speaker B: What are the second order impacts? Like, what are the coins or projects or trends or matters or narratives or what have you that the ETF approval actually could influence? So today we thought we'd do a roundtable, casual conversation around what we think are the biggest beneficiaries, as well as some more suspect beneficiaries, or maybe projects that would even suffer from the approval of the ETF. So here we are. Finally, after many years of waiting, the ETH ETF is somewhat approved. Was that surprising to you, Sanad? Did you expect to see that happen at all? Was that on your bingo card for 2024?
00:02:16.060 - 00:02:38.574, Speaker A: No, I was definitely pretty surprised and I definitely don't pay a lot of attention to the nuances, but I know that the smart macro people within our fund were pretty bearish on the prospect of it being approved. The polymarket odds were super low, the Bloomberg odds were super low. So I was just kind of believing what the market had led me to believe and I didn't think it was going to happen. What about you?
00:02:38.734 - 00:03:05.068, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by YGG. I'm very excited to announce that we're partnering with yield Guild games to bring you today's episode. You may remember YGG as the leading guild in web3 that helped drive the success of games like Axie, Infinity and Pixels, but they actually have bigger ambitions than just that. Ive really enjoyed co investing with and also learning all about gaming from their founder, Gaby Dezahn throughout the years. So here is Gabi to tell us all about how YGG has helped games succeed before.
00:03:05.196 - 00:03:58.354, Speaker C: YGG is evolving into a guild protocol. So dont think of us as a guild. Think of us as a platform that scales guilds of all sizes, which means that we provide the foundation infrastructure for guilds to scale, do different kinds of quests that can earn them crypto and have them own assets. And right now, the majority of this is still in play to earn games. But there's now different kinds of work that you can do in crypto that can earn you money. Think of what YGG is doing as a combination of Uber and LinkedIn. People are self organizing into groups and then finding opportunities in web3 that can not only earn them crypto, but they gain reputation in the form of badges and soul bound nfts, which allows them to build up a reputation on things that they've done well in contributing to different protocols.
00:03:58.434 - 00:04:49.564, Speaker B: And now back to the episode same page. Man, I think when the bitcoin ETF got approved, I was, I wasn't too surprised because I think there was some significant demand from Tradfi from the retail crowd, and it was pretty hard to make an argument that bitcoin is a security. So the arguments that were against bitcoin being an ETF by the SEC didn't really stand to me. I think the odds from Bloomberg analysts, even before approval were kind of in an overwhelming positive direction. So they were predicting around 75% versus ETH. I think their prediction was 25% before updated comments from the SEC, and there was a lot of talk about how the staking aspect of ETH could make it potentially have security characteristics, which made it a little bit harder to get an ETF, just like bitcoin. But my biggest skepticism was always the demand for ETH.
00:04:49.564 - 00:05:25.148, Speaker B: Right? I always thought that we had more than ten years for the bitcoin narrative to really percolate the mainstream. It's been ten years since I think bitcoin started to talk, being discussed in mainstream circles, not just like cypherpunk blocks. And people understand this digital narrative very, very well. And Tradfi has been talking about bitcoin for the past many, many years as well. So I thought that the mainstream had a lot of time to warm up to bitcoin. It's very easy to understand bitcoin as an asset, but for ETH, every year it gets more confusing. We have l two s this year.
00:05:25.148 - 00:05:50.826, Speaker B: Last year we had DA layers stripped out. So it was just very hard for mainstream to understand what it is. So I always thought that Wall street could be a few years away from getting as warmed up to eth as they are to bitcoin, if at all. And to me, bitcoin is always kind of a macro asset. They look at it as almost like an inflation hedge, digital gold. But for ETH, they look at it as a tech bet. So it's also a different class of investors with a different type of risk appetite.
00:05:50.826 - 00:06:25.130, Speaker B: So it was a little bit more, it's actually a lot more uncertain in my mind. So I was very, very surprised that it came out. But just before we dive into the implications here, I thought would probably be good to give some technicalities about the ETF approval, just because it wasn't a straight up approval. So for listeners at home, there's basically two main parts to ETF approval. So I'm not an ETF expert, neither is Anat, but we're just going to give this context here before we dive into things so that it's a bit clearer. So when applying for an ETF, apparently there's two parts. So there's one part called the s one.
00:06:25.130 - 00:07:08.888, Speaker B: So the s one is this initial registration form for new securities that's required by the SEC for public companies based in the US. So this form is used by ETF's to register the securities and it details the specifics about the ETF's offering. So that's one part, and then the other part is the 19 b. Four, or people are calling it 19 b on Twitter. So this is specific to ETF's and involve the listing standards of the exchanges where the ETF's will be traded. So this was the thing that got approved about two weeks ago. There was a deadline, like whenever someone applies for a 19 b, there is, I think, 45 days before the SEC has to make initial decision, and then the s one is the one that has not been approved yet and that one is a little bit more up in the air.
00:07:08.888 - 00:07:42.692, Speaker B: I think people are saying that they can actually drag this out for weeks to months before they approve because there's no hard deadline for that one. That is pretty much where we are today. We have 19 b approved as when not approved. But by and large, I think people are assuming that the whole thing is already approved and it's just an eventuality as to when the ETF will actually start to be traded. So I guess before we dive into the implications, what projects we think benefit from this, how do you think the ETF would do? Are you expecting people to get as excited about it as the bitcoin ETF in terms of inflows? Have you looked into that much?
00:07:42.838 - 00:08:47.334, Speaker A: I havent dug into so many specific numbers, but I generally think the ETF will see significant inflows. I think people are overthinking this idea that ETH is too complicated for tradfi to understand. And theres with this ridiculous recent twitter debate I saw where someone is like, oh no, we need to market it as digital oil and settlement layer is too complex for idiotic tratfire people. And the honest answer is that while I understand that bitcoin has had ten years to push its narrative, I do think the digital gold kind of bet against the dollar bet on an asset that does well in volatility is a pretty tricky bet. And thats not what most capital in the world is thinking about. Most capital in the world is not thinking about, oh, how can I hide my money under my bed when the government collapses? Capital in the world is trying to find productive, interesting technology thats being built. And I think ETH is going to be the key asset that those flows come into.
00:08:47.334 - 00:09:20.446, Speaker A: I dont know if you remember, Kyle Somali had this interesting thread, I think, three years ago about money crypto and tech crypto. And I think if youre looking for an easy kind of pitch, bitcoin is money crypto and eat is tech crypto and tech crypto is way more interesting. People who think it's too complicated, like staking is too complicated. People in chatfire love writing 15 page sell side reports on this stuff. They will take the time and energy to understand it. It's like a $400 billion asset. It's worth paying attention to because it's liquid enough.
00:09:20.446 - 00:10:14.676, Speaker A: And so I generally remain pretty bullish ETH. And I think one challenge is that if you read the finer details around this ETF, the reason it's going to be approved is still the reason that the bitcoin ETF was approved, which is that the Supreme Court said, hey, there's no logical reason for you guys to have futures ETF's on an asset and not have spot ETF's on the same asset. And given that that's the logic for this, and the CME has explicitly said that they're not trying to add Solana futures anytime soon, I actually think ETH is going to have a pretty long window in which it will be just ETH and bitcoin that have the benefits of these institutional inflows. And I think in that world ETH does very well because it just absorbs all of the energy for interesting tech being built on crypto and all of those flows just come to Ethiopia.
00:10:14.740 - 00:10:57.588, Speaker B: Thats a good point because it allows bitcoin and ETH to pull away from the crowd. Because I think a lot of people who are not crypto natives, who are not in the space, they are often quite worried about custody, especially after FTX. So it's not actually that common for people who are not spending a lot of time in crypto to have a metamask or even have a coinbase account. So having a brokerage account where you can just buy bitcoin ETF's and ETH ETF's on your banking app is actually a huge, huge difference. And you tap into a much bigger crowd than just crypto natives. So you're right, I think it does allow bitcoin and ETH to pull away from the crowd. There's, and it's funny you mentioned the sell side report as well because I think last year Goldman put out an ETH report, actually written by our former colleague.
00:10:57.588 - 00:11:30.424, Speaker B: So shout out to Dominica from Goldman for writing the report. So yeah, I do foresee more staking reports as well and on the impact just to give some numbers to our listeners as well. So in terms of the bitcoin ETF, if you look at net inflows, so for those listening at home, you can go to Farsight Co. UK. They basically track the daily inflows for every single bitcoin ETF product. So I think inception to date, there's been about $13 to $14 billion in net inflows. So you take all the inflows and you minus all the GBTC outflows.
00:11:30.424 - 00:12:26.644, Speaker B: So if you take that number and look at the increase in bitcoin market cap. In the time that this inflow happened, you can basically back out about a 30 to 45 x multiplier effect. So that means for every dollar that went into bitcoin, it resulted in a $30 increase in the market cap of bitcoin. Now, if you apply the same multiple to what could look like for ETH, and let's say you assume that the ETH inflows will be one 10th or maybe one fifth of bitcoin inflows, and you can arrive at this ratio in whatever way you want. So one way that people look at is looking at the CME open interest for bitcoin versus the CME open interest for ETH at the time before ETF approval. So if you take that, it's around, I think, 10% to 5%. So if you back out basically using that kind of mental math, you get about $5,000 ETH as kind of the bull case.
00:12:26.644 - 00:12:56.424, Speaker B: So that's just kind of a rough mental exercise. Obviously, that's not a price target, that's not financial advice. I think I have to disclose that. But that's just kind of a back of the envelope math that you can do at home just to kind of figure out what are the different scenarios there. But just to kind of put that in context, if we do get that type of inflow, let's say ETH gets to 5000 or 10,000, we get billions of dollars of inflows. What are some projects that you think will really benefit from this, or besides ETH as the asset itself, obviously.
00:12:57.004 - 00:13:36.700, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the first thing I want to say, I don't know if you saw that meme that I posted as well that I thought was really funny, where it's kind of a trader who was super excited about the ETH ETF and then just kept talking about, okay, I'm so excited to long ETH beta. And the other person is just like, okay, you can just buy a lot of ETH. And the other person repeatedly says, no, I need to find an ETH beta. And so I do think there is some level of delusion where we're kind of obsessed with these betas. And I remember, like, as an example, I also want to make the point like they do work. Like, people have been pitching me stacks as bitcoin beta for the last year and a half. And quite frankly, stacks has performed very well in the last year and a half.
00:13:36.700 - 00:14:13.494, Speaker A: So maybe they were onto something. But I think we spend a little too much energy looking for beta and we will spend the rest of this episode discussing some tokens that I think will do well. But I do want to caveat by saying I think it's entirely possible that the major beneficiary of these flows is ETH. Like, that would be my first takeaway here. And we have individual theses for a bunch of tokens. You can either go super long, Pepe, because that's the ETH mean coin. You can believe that Lido may finally actually break out of its stable coin price range that has been stuck in for a long time.
00:14:13.494 - 00:14:31.694, Speaker A: You may think that the l two s will do very well, but then you have to caveat it by looking at unlock schedules. So it's probably worth diving into the complexity. But I do think overall allocating to ETH is probably the no brainer, easy way to play this.
00:14:32.274 - 00:15:33.602, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, that is actually my hypothesis as well. So my co founder at Tangent, our angel fund Darryl, talked about this trade on another podcast, which I would not show because they're a competitor, but he's going to come on the show, I think, next week. So we're going to talk about this trade that we did where we effectively just sold all of our Solana, most of our alt exposure, and just went all into ethics right before the ETF approval. And we're going to explain why we decided to do that. But yeah, at that time we discussed kind of, okay, what are some ways to play this if we have such a bullish view on ETH? Is it to buy eth beta? And we just thought, actually, no, that the simple thing is just to buy etH, because ETH itself will be the main beneficiary of these ETF flows. So, yeah, so most of the things that we discuss here, I think will mostly just be kind of experimental ideas, just brainstorming. But in that spirit, the first thing that occurred to me besides ETH is probably Athena, which we've talked about again and again in the show, but it's the most obvious one because it basically is a product around ETH funding.
00:15:33.602 - 00:16:22.746, Speaker B: It's a product around bullish ETH. It is designed to be levered ETH beta almost. So, as you recall, as listeners recall, basically the yield that you earn on the Ena bond comes from ETH funding rates. So the more people along ETH, the, the higher the funding rate goes, the higher the yield that supposedly accrues to the USDE, which is the bond product that they have. And also, obviously part of the yield comes from the staking ETH as well. So in a market where you're structurally bullish, where the net marginal participant is a buyer, your funding rate should be trending up or maintaining up, which should be quite positive for Athena's yield, assuming, you know, the increase in funding doesn't get immediately offset by increase in inflows. But either way it's a positive development.
00:16:22.746 - 00:17:02.524, Speaker B: So that, to me, is quite positive. Obviously, the flip side is you could argue that a lot of the ETH demand might be on the spot ETF instead of expressed in perpetual swaps, which could kind of alleviate some of the marginal increase in funding that would have gone to the perpetual swaps. But at the end of the day, it's still one product. Like if people bid eTH on their brokerage apps, it doesn't mean that no one's going to bid eTH on perpetual exchanges. So either way, I think the creation of a structurally bullish market is very, very positive for Athena. I'm not sure if you have the same thought there or any skepticism over that.
00:17:02.944 - 00:18:30.354, Speaker A: No, I agree. One of the things that's been crazy impressive is I don't know if you saw the charts recently that the founder posted showing that Athena is the fastest USD denominated asset to get $3 billion in market cap, and it's way faster than. I mean, Athena is not exactly a stable coin, but it's been way faster than all of the other stable coins that are reaching that level, which is super impressive to see. And as you said, I think Athena's ability to give yield or scale stablecoin in some sense is limited by the demand to go long on ETH. And assuming the demand to go long on ETH futures increases over the next few months, which I think is a pretty easy bet to take, Athena has far more room to grow, and that team is just absolutely crushing it on integrations. Something that was super cool that was announced recently was that you can now use USDe as collateral to long bybit futures on bybit, which I think is such a huge unlock because one of the failure modes of stablecoins, Dai and Frax, to some degree in my opinion, is that theyre useful for playing a bunch of defi games, but no one ever uses them for what stablecoins are really used for, which is either to make transfers or to use them as collateral for trades, which is a major use case. And so im super hype with FiNA and I think that team continues to execute really well.
00:18:30.734 - 00:19:34.230, Speaker B: That was actually one thing that scared me, but that's why I'm not a founder. But seeing a kind of relatively nascent asset used as collateral on exchanges. I think I just too much PTSD from seeing of using altcoins as collateral and FTX myself. But given that it's more of a USD pact asset, and I think the exchange bybit probably has a higher collateral requirement for non USDT or non BTC type of margins, I wish them all the best and this is really one of the most exciting unlocks, I think, because it really starts to put you on the path to compete with USDT. People before would compare USD, the Athena USD packed asset to Dai to fracs, as you mentioned, but now people are starting to talk about it in the same veins as hey, this could be the next USDC or USDT. I want to go to one project that you mentioned earlier, which is Lido. So Lido, I actually don't really have a strong view on how this ETH ETF could benefit it.
00:19:34.230 - 00:20:00.894, Speaker B: Besides the fact that, hey, maybe this draws more attention to ETH and maybe more people stake EtH, I guess you could also argue that if more of the demand for ETH is coming in the form of the ETF, which does not provide staking, then the staking yield just goes to there's just more of the staking yield that or less of the staking yield that's diluted. But what are your thoughts on there? What are the implications for Lido?
00:20:01.754 - 00:20:41.930, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Lido is one of those kind of tokens that perpetually is spoken about as undervalued. But everyone who calls it undervalued struggles to provide a strong catalyst for it to go up. And so it is super weird. Lido makes quite a lot of revenue. They have $36 billion of ETH that are staked through them. Theyre such a clear market leader, its hard to find a monopoly at that scale in crypto. But, for example, right now, the liquid restaking tokens, some of them trade at comparable market caps while doing having 1% of the TVL and 1% of the brand value that kind of lido does.
00:20:41.930 - 00:21:32.584, Speaker A: And so the easy answer here, to some degree that I believe, is that Lido has a lot of structural sellers. They've obviously had a bunch of people buy Lido over the years in private deals. And the bullish thing for Lido is that over the last year, year and a half, almost all of that is unlocked. So if you look at the Lido charts, and I encourage viewers to do this, it's like one of the charts where there's such a massive divergence between the price chart and the market cap chart, because the price chart from, like three years ago is kind of lame and pretty flat. Like, it has some spikes. But we're kind of where we were two and a half years ago, which is super pathetic in some sense. The market cap has grown immensely, which is just a way of saying it's unlocked and people have been selling it.
00:21:32.584 - 00:21:40.734, Speaker A: And so, yeah, if you just increase the timescales of the stuff. Okay, so the market cap is growing.
00:21:40.884 - 00:21:43.522, Speaker B: But the price is just a stable coin.
00:21:43.658 - 00:21:44.666, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:21:44.810 - 00:21:47.074, Speaker B: And this is because of the inflation of the token.
00:21:47.194 - 00:22:16.170, Speaker A: Yes. The thing about Lido is that it really is almost fully diluted at this point. And so we have very few unlocks to go. This team is well funded. I think they will benefit from a few things. The one thing that was announced was symbiotic, which is a kind of product that Lidos co founders and investors are building to focus on the restaking market. Now, it was widely anticipated that this will have some sort of relationship to Lido.
00:22:16.170 - 00:22:59.114, Speaker A: I don't know what that looks like, but Lido didn't really react to the news. I struggle. I come back to what everyone says, which is that maybe there are just a lot of structural sellers for this token, and that's what prevents it from growing up, or maybe there's just no real reason to bid it. The reasons are very fundamental. It's like, okay, it has good cash flows. It is a stalwart of Defi. I think if they're able to establish some position for themselves in this restaking meta and the market kind of rediscovers an affinity for ETH and eth staking things.
00:22:59.114 - 00:23:22.440, Speaker A: There's a lot of room for Lido to grow. It's worth so little relative to a lot of other projects in the space. And so I continually remain pretty bullish on Lido. And I do think. I don't know. I mean, there's no sense in which downside is really capped, but it's like, I don't think there's a lot of sellers at this point either. But, yeah, this isn't a very bullish thesis.
00:23:22.440 - 00:23:28.188, Speaker A: It's just a thesis for believing this thing is undervalued, but, like, continuing to struggle to find the catalyst that pushes it up.
00:23:28.276 - 00:24:20.540, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is the, this is, this tweet is very accurate that you included from Sisyphus. For those of you who are not watching this video, the tweet basically says, my guess is Lido is the new maker. Four years of steady selling pressure from the devs from paradigm in a 16 z before the fundamentals matter. I guess just to clarify the facts a bit, I think the big maker seller over the years was polychain because I don't think paradigm was even around when Maker was first started. I could be wrong on that. But basically the story there was, I think anybody in crypto throughout 2018 to 2021 would remember for Maker, we just basically had so many bullish developments, amazing growth. It was a dominant stable coin in DeFi, and it was just underperforming a lot of assets because there was one or two big wallets that just kept selling the MKR token in size.
00:24:20.540 - 00:24:55.038, Speaker B: And people were basically suspecting that it's probably one of the earlier investors. And people on Twitter were saying, oh, it's probably polychain whatnot. I don't know who it is. But the issue is there is a divergence between short term price or near term price and development just because of this type of supply dynamics. And yeah, it looks like we're seeing that in Lido as well. For those of you watching this on YouTube, I'm pulling up the price chart for Lido and the market cap chart for Lido, which is exactly what Sanat just described. So yeah, this one is a confusing one.
00:24:55.038 - 00:25:35.702, Speaker B: I don't feel very strongly, but I guess most people are probably in the same boat. That's why it's not going anywhere, because no one really feeling strongly. And there's also an element of it being a solved game. I think majority of Defi, which I put Nido under as well, is a solved game in the sense that there is strong consensus on valuation models. People look at cash flows, people agree on certain metrics like TVL, which you mentioned just now as well, versus a lot of the other verticals. I don't think there is any consensus on how to value l two s, how to value da layers, how to value l one s, even besides comping it to ethereum, how to value AI coins or meme coins. So those allow for more imagination with regard to the upside.
00:25:35.702 - 00:26:03.244, Speaker B: And because of that, I think Defi has basically been an underdog for the past few years. And that applies to Lido as well. So that's another added reason for why Lido has been kind of struggling a little bit. And even with the symbiotic news, I think symbiotic is the Eigen layer competitor that I believe paradigm is incubating. That would be, is it built on Lido or just by the Lido team? It doesn't seem like people really care. Like the price just did not react to this news.
00:26:03.744 - 00:26:07.378, Speaker A: Yeah, I think part of the problem is that the relationship is currently unclear.
00:26:07.536 - 00:27:01.748, Speaker B: Well, I guess moving on to another project that we think could benefit from this. I actually think if we do get a massive ETH dominance run, you could get the same effect as the last cycle where you create massive wealth in ETH and net wealth trickles down to ETH native assets. And the most interesting one to me being nfts. So the difference with the bitcoin ETF and ETH ETF is, I think, a lot of the on chain degens don't actually hold bitcoin. I believe the Venn diagram. If you have to draw a Venn diagram to illustrate bitcoin holders and on chain degens who are playing around on pump fund, I think the overlap is actually quite small versus, like, if you do the same for ETH and those dgens, the overlap is a lot bigger because you're holding ETH in your metamask, you're trying different things, you're bridging to different chains. So the wealth effect, I think if we get an ETH bull market, is going to be much more interesting for the rest of crypto than if it occurred in bitcoin.
00:27:01.748 - 00:27:37.920, Speaker B: And one of the things that I look at is this metric called total three, which is the total market cap of all crypto assets except for bitcoin and ETH. And for the most part, it really hasn't grown too much. I'll try to see if I can show it on the screen here. Yeah. So despite all of the. Despite all of the attention given to crypto in the past year, this total three metric isn't actually even close to the all time high last time. It's almost like, well, slightly more than half of the all time high.
00:27:37.920 - 00:28:12.300, Speaker B: So it signals to me that the broader wealth effect that we saw last time, where you just throw a dart on the board and anything goes up, isn't really here yet. And I think we get some element of that if we do get an eth bull market, which we really haven't had. So I think a big beneficiary of that could be nfts, just because when you have more assets on chain, people start to buy things that they want to flex. There's the element of veeblin goods there as well. And what is one good way to express that view could be the biggest NFT exchange, which currently is still blur. Do you have any thoughts on that?
00:28:12.372 - 00:28:54.796, Speaker A: I mean, I guess I could see it. The challenge for me is that nfts as a cultural phenomena feel dead even in CT land. It's like, who's really flexing anymore? There are people who are penguins and there are people who are punks, and they've been penguins and punks for a long time. And sure, like penguins and miladis have done well over this cycle, punks and bodapes have not. So there is like some differentiation. But I guess the biggest challenge for me is that like, it feels like a lot of that energy won't is flowing into different avenues people are excited by. Meme coins is probably the biggest one for sure, but maybe people more of it will flow into platforms like Fintech and Fantasy top.
00:28:54.796 - 00:29:42.194, Speaker A: I'm not sure. The only concern I have is that I just feel like the social status associated with acquiring an NFT and flexing. It feels like it's fallen a lot in cd land as well. And particularly given that even punks are having a terrible time with yuga releasing weird graphics and the price falling off a cliffhanger. I'm just more worried about structurally whether there is demand for nfts in a way that there was two years ago, because I think just a handful of people, and my sense is right now there's a handful of people trading maladies, trading punks and trading penguins, and that's all that's going on. And so I feel like the cultural meta has to shift more than just a wealth effect. But I could be wrong.
00:29:42.194 - 00:29:48.830, Speaker A: Plurals obviously benefits in some way from blast tailwinds. I don't know what the specifics there are, actually.
00:29:48.942 - 00:30:53.158, Speaker B: I think it also could be different types of nfts as well, because the way I think about it, just from first principles, Veebland goods probably tend to occur when things get frothy, when there's a lot of liquidity and money sloshing around. And I think your argument is that the nfts of last cycle, like the pudgies, the apes, might not be the veebling goods that they are, that they were, just because the status is kind of faded, the novelty is kind of worn off. Which is why I'm also open to the idea of super rare potentially doing well as the I think only NFT exchange focused on exclusive crypto art. That has a token, because I could totally see a world where this time people don't really flex their wealth through apes, where you have hundreds of very similar looking ones. Instead they go for the one of ones, the kind of artists, the very kind of bespoke art pieces that have been basically a vibeling good in the web two world. These are basically just real art pieces, so I could see that happen. I had that kind of thesis last time as well.
00:30:53.158 - 00:31:22.084, Speaker B: A last cycle where I thought that after the pfps will come to one of ones because they are even more exclusive, even more veeblin. But I don't think the market had any gas to even get to that point before we just kind of imploded. So this time around I could see the market just skipping the pfps and going straight for the one off ones. But that's kind of like an out there idea, so we'll see how that goes. Going back to your picks, I think you mentioned that maybe eigen layer could benefit from the ETF as well. What are your thoughts on that?
00:31:22.244 - 00:31:56.114, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I'm actually just very curious to see what I say. With the ETF news and the Eigen token white paper dropping a few weeks ago, people have kind of forgotten, but I didn't get a little bit. But I think it's worth revisiting. A handful of things are going on. One is that actual flows, and I'm trying to find the dashboard. I should have brought this up before, but actual flows into lrts have slowed pretty significantly. And so it feels like the ecosystem is kind of obviously likely attracting less eth as things go.
00:31:56.114 - 00:32:39.474, Speaker A: But Igalia's TVL obviously benefits immensely from just the price of ETH going up. And so I think one effect, that there's a few things happening in the eigen layer ecosystem. I'd say two, that I'm really curious to see how they play out. One is just that the eigaliar ecosystem now is $20 billion, and so they're expected to generate yield on $20 billion. And that's actually pretty hard. Like, if you think of emissions across tokens in crypto, like, I think something with a really high inflation like Celestia probably inflates like a billion dollars this year. Most tokens inflate, most high performing tokens inflate, somewhere in the realm of 60 to 100 million.
00:32:39.474 - 00:33:21.854, Speaker A: And so for eigen layer to generate 5% yield, it now needs to have a billion dollar of emissions combined with its own token and AV's tokens. And 5% isn't even that crazy. And that's assuming the price and TVL stay constantly. And so they've kind of done a great job attracting TVL to this massive pool. But now they're going to have to either step up and provide the yield, or see kind of outflows from that pool. And so I'm really curious to see how that plays out. Having said that, I think the interesting counterbalance to that is that my sense is from talking to a bunch of teams in the Eigen layer AV's ecosystem, that we're effectively going to have a very real AV's season.
00:33:21.854 - 00:34:14.844, Speaker A: What I anticipate is that as Eigen layer goes live and these avss go live, therell effectively be like a token launch every few weeks off an AV's whose yield can only be earned primarily through Eigen layer. And so were going to see like, I can think of at least eight to ten reasonably credible avss. Im not very excited by the products of most of them transparently. But I think theres reasonably credible teams that will like launch at reasonably high valuations. And so there will be this kind of like right now everyone was playing this Eigen layered airdrop farming game. I think version two of the game is actually going to be like a ton of tokens launching, like a ton of AV's tokens launching and those being earned by people who are in the pool. And some of those will probably have obscene valuations which will allow them to kind of keep the merry go round going for a while longer.
00:34:14.844 - 00:34:43.927, Speaker A: So broadly, I think anything good for ETH is probably good for eigen layer in general, with the caveat that I think the Eigen layer ecosystem has set itself up for an interesting challenge with having $20 billion of TVL that they are effectively forced to generate yield on. And so once the airdrop and all is done, maybe that money just leaves, but otherwise you have $20 billion. And to pay them 10%, you need $2 billion, which is a crazy sum of money and emission.
00:34:44.015 - 00:34:46.759, Speaker B: And this number will go up after the ETF as well.
00:34:46.911 - 00:34:53.431, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And if ETH goes up, then like the tv and percentages become even harder to keep up with.
00:34:53.527 - 00:35:24.610, Speaker B: I think that's a good point. Right? If we get to like, let's say, just with the current units of ETH, let's say ETH doubles from here. You get $40 billion worth of TVL and Eigen layer. And one Av's. One AV's needs to give out $4 billion a year to give it, you know, a 10% yield or $2 billion to give it a 5% yield and $2 billion. It's not $2 billion in fdv or market cap. It's $2 billion in the monetary value of the inflation that they have to print just to eigen layer stakers.
00:35:24.610 - 00:35:39.634, Speaker B: So I don't even know if I guess most of the big, maybe top ten, top 20. I need to check the math on that. Top ten, top 20 l ones probably emit $2 billion a year. Is that fair to say? Do they even get to $2 billion a year?
00:35:39.674 - 00:35:53.914, Speaker A: I mean, it depends a lot. Like cosmos chains inflate a lot, but everyone is staked, so it's kind of neither here nor there. That's why celestial inflates like a crazy amount. Celestia inflates, I want to say, like 16% this year, 16% off of a.
00:35:53.954 - 00:35:55.474, Speaker B: Pretty big market cap as well.
00:35:55.634 - 00:36:09.818, Speaker A: Yeah, but I do think cosmos chains have the benefit where almost everyone is staked. So it's really a tax on a very small handful of users. But I think the bigger l one s insulate way much less than that.
00:36:09.946 - 00:36:39.716, Speaker B: Yeah. So you really have to plan on a few big infra projects coming on again to really give you juicy yields. But my understanding is most of the AVss are actually not that type of project. So, yeah. Would be interesting to see whether this ETF thing is actually positive for Eigen. It could be a challenge for them. And on that same note, I have a similar view on l two s as well, in that it's quite unknown what the impact is for these l two s.
00:36:39.716 - 00:37:08.634, Speaker B: So on one hand, you could think that, okay, if you get a wealth effect in eth, there's more dollars on ethereum and they could bridge two l two s to try different things. But the gap between bridging to an l two and bridging to like another l one is so little right now that I don't know if this exclusively benefits something like arbitrum or optimism or metis or what have you. All these l two s. Do you have any views on how this ETF impacts our beloved l two s?
00:37:09.254 - 00:37:37.846, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think the wealth effect is real and that money will flow into l two s. I think the one thing I start by saying is l two s are already becoming pretty complex to trade. It's like the no brainer. One is just to kind of assume arbitrary and optimism are the main ones and continue to back those. And broadly, I think both of those ecosystems are doing very well. Having said that, I think you have to be careful. The Zk ones are launching tokens.
00:37:37.846 - 00:38:04.126, Speaker A: Stockpile launched a token. Zksync is launching a token. And so im curious to see how those play out. I think longing something like Metis is just a bad idea, but there are people who are people who continue to long bitcoin cash and make money. So who knows? There are weird assets that people can make sense of. Blast is probably going to launch a token somewhere soon. The thing I'm actually much more curious to see is how differentiation plays out.
00:38:04.126 - 00:38:40.604, Speaker A: But I think on the whole, the l two ecosystem will do well. I expect l two PvL to continue to rise, and I expect roll ups to continue to do well. What I'm curious about is how competition plays out between blast, arbitrage, and optimism, each of which has a bunch of interesting stuff happening in their ecosystems. Optimism, outside of shipping a bunch of stuff like fraud proofs, is really home to base and the super chain, and they're doing a bunch of interesting stuff there. For some reason, it's still unclear whether base will ever have a token. I don't think op gets any of that bid. In theory, it could.
00:38:40.604 - 00:39:28.964, Speaker A: That was a big narrative when it was happening. But I don't think op gets any of that bid, really. Arbitrum is doing well with launching stylus, and I think blast is also crushing it on multiple fronts. And so I'm actually very curious to see whether all three of them and the ZK roll ups continue to trade as one, or whether we have a lot, like a lot more weight is placed on asset selection. I think the other challenge, really, is that for all of these tokens, you just have to be cognizant of unlock schedules. I think the nice thing about arbitram and optimism is that they've both gone past major Cliff unlocks, and now they're just kind of steady drip unlocks. But that is always kind of the challenge, because there'll be new l two s launching, and those l two s will maybe not have unlocks for a while, and then you're kind of in this very sharp liquid trader PvP game.
00:39:28.964 - 00:39:35.032, Speaker A: But I'm skeptical that all l two s just go up. That feels like it. Too easy.
00:39:35.128 - 00:40:17.932, Speaker B: I think this goes back to this aggregation of ETh thesis that we talked about on a previous episode, which is the fact that before, you could basically, if you're bullish on ETH, you think some positive flows or developments are coming to ETh. You buy eth, and then you can't just buy eth, because when l two is emerged, you start to think of, okay, Eth is a settlement layer, and you have to also bet on the execution layer. If you're bullish on web3, on ETH, and then this cycle around, you have the da layers as well. So not only do you have kind of horizontal fragmentation in terms of attention and flows, in a sense that you have more and more l two s. It's not just optimism anymore, it's optimism. Arbitrum, all these other l two s. You also have vertical fragmentation of attention, which is, it's not just l two s.
00:40:17.932 - 00:40:51.670, Speaker B: Now, people talk about l three s and also one layer below ethereum, and then you have the bridges, the layer zeros, the da layers. So I could see that attention fragmentation, just being. And people just kind of ignoring that completely and just say, you know, screw it, we're just gonna go for eth. Because the one thing I can be confident on, if I think flows are coming to eth, is that eth will get a bit right. That's like, that is a fact. Um, versus, you know, maybe some of this flows go to this l two instead of that l two. That could be too complex a calculus for people to get involved with.
00:40:51.670 - 00:41:30.194, Speaker B: So, yeah, I can definitely see your skepticism there. Um, so which goes back to your point. Yeah, the simplest thing might actually just Eth gets the benefit, and then maybe some things on ETH gets benefited as well. Um, and speaking of that, I think one thing, the last thing I want to bring up that I think could get benefit from this EtH bid could be meme coins, which we've seen already all cycle with solana. We saw the rise of wif, which is relatively new meme coin, relative to some of the ogs, like Doge and so on. And then on ETH. It seems like the consensus of what the eth meme coin is, is Pepe right now.
00:41:30.194 - 00:42:02.244, Speaker B: So I guess the thesis there is retail flows. They don't want to just buy a large asset. They want to find something that's slightly more out. The risk curve maybe gives you a little bit more variants, which is what kind of leads them to buy meme coins. And I could see a situation where tradfi is kind of buying ETH because they're not basically allowed to buy meme coins by their mandates. And then the retailers are just like, you know what? We're going to buy a higher volatility version of this, and we'll buy meme coins. And then you basically get a bit in Pepe and Eth.
00:42:02.244 - 00:42:30.366, Speaker B: So it's kind of like the barbell portfolio. If you bring up that kind of meme, of the 100 IQ kind of bell curve, you have the 50 iqs buying Pepe, 150 IQ is buying Eth. And then the middle of the pack, the 100 iqs are buying all the L two s and Lido and they're all wondering, oh shit, why are we not getting richer? So I could definitely see that happening as well. I don't know how much time you spend on meme coins. I'm not an expert there. I've dabbled a little bit. But is this something that you can see happening as well?
00:42:30.550 - 00:43:11.840, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, very little. I guess the thing that always worries me a little bit is like, how do you know when there's going to be a new one? It's like whiffs happened after bonk and it ended up getting bigger. And as you look at this category, like, do you understand why we've decided maybe it's just the most recent one, but why? Pepe is the flag bearer for ethereum meme coins and it's not Shiba or Floki. I think people should be trading them and I can totally see them making money. But I guess the thing that always confuses me here is asset selection. How do you not know that? Theres actually a new dog weve had thats going to come on ethereum and its actually going to be the big one and Pepe and its going to overtake Pepe. So yeah, I have no idea.
00:43:11.840 - 00:43:28.578, Speaker A: But I could totally see it working. I think with plus Solana is probably a great way to expose yourself to the Solana ecosystem. Probably better than trying to buy the defi on Solana. So I agree with the meme, but I dont think I have the capability to trade the meme coins. Honestly.
00:43:28.776 - 00:44:03.550, Speaker B: This is honestly pretty interesting, right? Because if you think about 2020, 2021, when people were thinking about betas to ecosystems, they want to bet on. Just to give an example, like for avalanche, people were buying trader Joe, people were buying pangolin swap, people were buying cravata, the game on avalanche. So people were actually looking for products on avalanche. And the logic was very clear. It's like, okay, if we're going to get inflows or incentives for people to use apps in this ecosystem, we should just buy the apps, right? So, but for this cycle, people don't even think like that. People are just like, you know, fuck the apps. We're not going to even touch defi.
00:44:03.550 - 00:44:34.266, Speaker B: Let's go straight to the meme coins. I wonder if we'll ever get a pendulum swing back to the apps where people are like, well, money is coming into this ecosystem, so let's bet on the apps in this ecosystem. But yeah, I think that requires a mindset shift of the market, which is historically very, very hard to predict. But before we close out, are there other categories that you want to touch on that you think could be center of attention for this ETH tailwind?
00:44:34.370 - 00:45:07.554, Speaker A: Well, actually the opposite. One thing I think this might do is that it might take some of the wind out of the sails of all of this stuff that's happening in the bitcoin ecosystem, and in particular one, I think maybe that was already happening. But like runes was, my understanding is it underperformed everyone's expectations. No one is talking about having made money on runes. They kind of fell off. People were super hype about them. They did a lot of trading, they did a lot of trading volume on the first couple of days, and then it just kind of fell off.
00:45:07.554 - 00:46:01.330, Speaker A: And similarly, I'm saying, like, maybe not in private funding, but it feels like there's a little bit of exhaustion with stuff in the bitcoin ecosystem. And the kind of both bitbounds and Merlin launch tokens and theyre doing fine, but theyre also pretty low as valuations go relative to those of the 10th roll up in the Ethereum ecosystem. And its worth remembering that these are number one. And I think, as you said, people were kind of writing it off. But I think if we kind of see people's attention shift meaningfully towards Ethereum, I think people will rediscover that. Ethereum is a way better technical platform than bitcoin, and all of the stuff we're trying to do on bitcoin can be done already on Ethereum, and it's just better. And so it feels like the wind is already kind of coming out of the sales in the bitcoin ecosystem a little bit.
00:46:01.330 - 00:46:28.034, Speaker A: And I'm kind of predicting that a renaissance in excitement around ETH will probably be bad for all of this stuff in the bitcoin ecosystem. Not bitcoin, the asset and the EDF inflows, but all of this runes, BRC twenties l two s. I think a lot of this is not going to do well in the face of excitement about Ethereum, because also objectively, I think Ethereum is an order of magnitude better place to build all of this stuff.
00:46:28.534 - 00:46:57.042, Speaker B: Actually, on that note, as a venture investor, you look at so many deals and companies coming your way, or builders whose products might come to market a few months or a few years from now. Based on all those conversations, have you seen a lot of people building on ETH layer one itself? Because the last one I remember was Athena. Everything else is pitching. Hey, we're building a blast. We're building on Solana, we're building on l two s. No one seems to be building on l one anymore for ETh. Is that the case for you as well?
00:46:57.178 - 00:47:36.096, Speaker A: Almost entirely. Outside of a very small subset of products, we don't see anyone building on l one. I think part of it is that a lot of the things people want to do in Defi are now more exciting and high performance. And you see developers just realize oh I could do this thing on an l two and it would be cheap and it would make sense, but you cant do it on an l one, its way too expensive. I think we should expect to see that happen increasingly. I was listening to the Bankless podcast with Justin Drake and Anatoly from Solana and he literally said something he said before where he said you should not build on etel one. Like if you're a developer, you should build on an etel two or you should build on Savannah.
00:47:36.096 - 00:47:53.888, Speaker A: Etl one is not supposed to be anything but a settlement layer. I think you should expect to see that more and more. But yeah, I agreed entirely that almost all ethereum pictures I see are now for applications built on l two s, which I think is a good sign for ethereum in some sense.
00:47:54.056 - 00:48:23.990, Speaker B: Yeah. So maybe that is the l two tailwind. Not so much about eth ETF flows or anything to do with Eth bid, it's just people going to actually stuff on them, which we're starting to see. Fantasy top I think is on blast. All these newfangled social fire apps like Friendtech is on base, so nothing. There's a lot of development happening on l two s already, so that could just be a matter of time before l two has got some love again. And maybe it's wrong to focus on the ETF flows as the predominant tailwind.
00:48:24.102 - 00:49:09.860, Speaker A: Yeah, I think what I'd quickly add is that we spend a lot of time thinking about where do we find the sharpest developers, because that's the ecosystem we should be paying attention to and that's where we expect to see results six months from now. I think a year and a half ago we basically said all the smart developers we see are gravitating towards rollups. I think we probably missed a small pocket. And today I would say almost all of the sharp developers are developing applications either on rollups or on Solana. And I would very explicitly put bitcoin not in that category. There are some sharp builders in bitcoin, but you meet them and they tend to be people who are like, look, I saw what happened on ETh. I want to do that on bitcoin, but there's very few kind of cutting edge, high caliber developers outside of the Solana and Ethereum roll up ecosystems, in my view.
00:49:09.972 - 00:49:40.562, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm always trying to look for like the zero to one apps as well. Like just completely new types of just weird shit that people can do on chain. And all of that is happening on either l two s, and some of them are so complex that they can't even be supported by current l two. So I was talking to, I guess without giving away too much, I was talking to this project that's allowing people to short meme coins, but in order to do liquidations correctly, they need instantaneous finality, not fast finality. They need instantaneous. So they were saying, yes, Solana is way too fucking slow. We can't do it.
00:49:40.562 - 00:50:12.960, Speaker B: So they're actually building on a shared portal of ours that allows for that, which hopefully we can share more soon. But there you have it, folks. Our picks for what could happen after Ethan ETF. Besides ETH itself, we talked about Athena, we talked about Blur, we talked about super rare, we talked about meme coins, Lido, Eigen layer, l two s, and also bitcoin.
