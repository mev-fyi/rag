00:00:01.960 - 00:00:39.006, Speaker A: You're now listening to Alpha Leak, a podcast mini series highlighting the most under the radar projects and developments in crypto, and this series is brought to you by the Blockcrunch podcast. I'm your host, Jason Choi. I'm a general partner at Spartan Capital and an active Defi angel investor. Nothing on this show should be construed as financial advice, and my guests, myself, and my employer may hold positions and assets discussed on the show. And if you'd like for your project to be featured on this series, reach out to me on Twitter mrjasonchoi and this episode is brought to you by perpetual protocol and Solana as a disclaimer, Dragonfly Capital, at which Haseep is a managing partner, is an investor in Hash flow.
00:00:39.150 - 00:00:40.286, Speaker B: That's why I'm really excited to bring.
00:00:40.310 - 00:00:47.594, Speaker A: On Haseep to share his viewpoint as an investor in the project as well. And I myself am also a personal investor into the project.
00:00:47.894 - 00:01:01.004, Speaker B: Today, I'm really excited to learn more about a new project called Hash Flow, so I'm very excited to have the founder of hash flow, Varun Kumar, on the show, as well as Haseeb Qureshi, who you've heard from before from Dragonfly Capital. So welcome both.
00:01:01.944 - 00:01:02.648, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:01:02.736 - 00:01:04.204, Speaker D: Thanks for having us, Jason.
00:01:04.904 - 00:01:05.304, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:01:05.344 - 00:01:13.444, Speaker B: So just to get us started right away, Varun, can you maybe give us a context about what hash flow is and how did it come into existence?
00:01:13.904 - 00:01:15.004, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:01:16.024 - 00:01:25.884, Speaker E: I think in one line they usually like to talk about hash flow as it's a decentralized exchange that is bringing institutional liquidity into defi.
00:01:27.784 - 00:01:53.294, Speaker C: But if we backtrack exactly what that means and unbundle some of the concepts and what that means for the end trader, and then also, why is it even relevant? I think we can backtrack a bit more. To go back to Defi summer from last year, I think we talked about this, where Uniswap obviously has been a catalyst in getting the excitement into Defi and seeing where things are today.
00:01:55.274 - 00:01:55.658, Speaker E: That.
00:01:55.706 - 00:02:17.694, Speaker C: Resulted in many, many other projects starting to innovate at the AMM level, where essentially you can think of amms as these vending machines that will give you quotes every time you request one. But then at the same time, we also noticed that while this is good, it looks very primitive, and is there a way for us to unbundle uniswap.
00:02:18.034 - 00:02:20.418, Speaker E: And see what else can be done.
00:02:20.466 - 00:03:41.660, Speaker C: To solve things at the level of capital, efficiency, or even gas costs? And more importantly, how can we bring broader financial instruments that are typically traded on CFI or traditional finance into DeFI in a way that actually improves the market structure. And I think that kind of led to hashload, where we were essentially like, people like to trade on uniswap because of simplicity, of how easy it is to just go and request a quote and get something. And at the same time, CFI has been perfecting price discovery and structuring assets for the past 100 years or even more. We wanted to see if there is a way for us to meet in the middle, where we can find the best of both worlds, where we are able to marry the two together. I think that's what led to creation of Hashler, where we were like, let's combine the price discovery of CEFI and bring the sophistication of traditional market making and apply that at the DeFi level. So, so, which means permissionless, trustless trading for the end user on Ethereum, but they also means that it's extremely more.
00:03:41.692 - 00:03:44.324, Speaker E: Capital efficient and it allows for any.
00:03:44.364 - 00:03:48.388, Speaker C: Kind of product or assets to be traded effortlessly on DeFi.
00:03:48.516 - 00:03:48.756, Speaker F: So.
00:03:48.780 - 00:03:54.788, Speaker C: So that's kind of how I'd like to describe. Harsh, low, but keen to hear if.
00:03:54.876 - 00:03:57.892, Speaker E: You have any questions so far, or if Haseep, if you'd like to add.
00:03:57.908 - 00:04:00.134, Speaker C: Any more context on top of that.
00:04:01.474 - 00:04:17.054, Speaker B: Yeah, so it sounds like the way that traders interact with hash flow is going to be familiar to anyone who's used uniswap before. But how are the trades executed in the background? Can you maybe give an example about a trade going through the hash flow system and how is it executed?
00:04:17.434 - 00:05:46.272, Speaker C: Yeah, I think what we like to call this is signature based pricing for anybody who's traded in traditional OTC desk or just traditional finance in general is familiar with RFQ system. So from the front end, obviously a user goes, enters a number, the vending machine gives you the quote, and then you submit the order and the trade goes through. And then you see your transaction being mined on Etherscan. In the backend. We essentially have market makers who manage an inventory of assets in hash load pools, and they are essentially issuing quotes via RFQ system that we've built. And anytime a user decides to take a trade, we inform the market maker, then they sign the quote, and then the user broadcasts that signed quote to the blockchain and the trade is executed against the pool. So essentially, in many ways, this actually guarantees that the same quote that the user is going to get that quote or that price, and it prevents things like mue or front running and things that you've typically seen in amms, which traditionally have been using bonding curve to give a more more to dive a bit deep into it.
00:05:46.272 - 00:06:21.394, Speaker C: So we can think of smart amms are smart contracts who are doing market making and you have lazy LP's who are putting capital. So you have people putting capital and then your smart contracts do the pricing. They use the strategies to price assets for the end user. In this case, we have essentially kind of unautomated the market maker by bringing traditional market makers to do the pricing. But the end result is a highly optimized, gas optimized and highly capital efficient protocol that that allows anybody to do the swaps without the issues you would face in typical amms.
00:06:22.574 - 00:06:43.940, Speaker D: So maybe I can add a little bit of color there on what makes it so interesting relative to something like uniswap. So Uniswap obviously works very well for a certain category of assets. Now, if you look at the most active uniswap pools or something, it's like EQSDC or something is a canonical pool for which uniswap, especially uniswap v. Three.
00:06:44.102 - 00:06:45.444, Speaker F: Has a lot of liquidity.
00:06:46.184 - 00:07:19.284, Speaker D: Now, Uniswap liquidity on Uniswap is worst for pairs, where the impermanent loss, quote unquote between two assets is very high. Permanent loss is kind of a fancy term for price divergence if the price of two assets diverges a lot. So one example of an asset whose price is going to change a lot is like an option. An option is an asset that basically depending on whether the option pays out as it gets closer and closer to expiring, the value of the option is either high or zero, and it gets closer and closer to zero, or closer and closer to being a very high.
00:07:19.324 - 00:07:21.584, Speaker F: Number as it approaches expiry.
00:07:22.004 - 00:07:43.732, Speaker D: This is an asset that Uniswap just absolutely sucks at pricing. Because Uniswap, if you're pricing an option against USD, the option price is going to continually change all the time. Now, something like ETH USD as the volatility of crypto, when the volatility of crypto is relatively low, EthUSD can work pretty well. But for types of assets that are.
00:07:43.748 - 00:07:47.964, Speaker F: Very volatile, Uniswap just doesn't do pricing well at all.
00:07:48.004 - 00:08:27.474, Speaker D: It just doesn't really work. The impermanent loss is so high that it's extremely constraining for good liquidity. So another example of an asset that can't be priced well on Uniswap is something like gas filings, which are used by almost all yield or not yield aggregators aggregators trading aggregators, because they can lower your gas costs for interacting with a contract, but it's very hard to get liquidity for them because putting them in an amm, I mean, gas prices are just super volatile. They whip up and down all the time, as we've seen over the last few weeks. So pricing a gas token in amm just totally doesn't work. The LP's in that amm just get absolutely destroyed.
00:08:27.634 - 00:08:30.306, Speaker F: So what hash flow allows is it.
00:08:30.330 - 00:08:55.745, Speaker D: Basically allows market makers to sit around off chain and just basically sign quotes. Whenever somebody wants to buy some gas tokens or buy an option, they just write down a price and say, okay, here's what I'm willing to give it to you for. You receive the quote offline, and you can decide whether you want to submit it on chain. But the point at which you submit it on chain, it's totally trustless. It's just as trustless as uniswap. You don't have to trust the counterparty, you don't have to underwrite them. You don't know who they are.
00:08:55.745 - 00:09:09.464, Speaker D: You just take the cryptographic quote, you submit it on chain, and it gets executed. But because it's not pre committing to a price on chain, which is effectively what Uniswap does, Uniswap pre commits to a price, and then as people trade against it, that's what updates its price.
00:09:10.964 - 00:09:13.372, Speaker F: Hash flow doesn't have that requirement, and.
00:09:13.388 - 00:09:35.958, Speaker D: So that allows you to price things that are much harder to price on chain, using off chain intelligence to do that. Now, the second aspect of it, which is something that in crypto today, it's a question of how much people care about fees. But the other advantage of something like hash flow is that it sort of disintermediates something like Uniswap in that if.
00:09:35.966 - 00:09:38.030, Speaker F: You take a look at ethusd, again.
00:09:38.102 - 00:09:42.526, Speaker D: Very, very common pair, whether it's USDC or tether or whatever, lots of volume in ETH.
00:09:42.550 - 00:09:47.554, Speaker F: USDC, Uniswap charges 30 bps for any trade on ETH. USDC.
00:09:48.374 - 00:10:19.258, Speaker D: That's in addition to the slippage and the front running and whatever else you end up. If you had sandwich attack, blah, blah, blah. So 30 bits, I mean, that's like one of the highest features on Coinbase, which is an extremely high fee to your exchange. It's very expensive to trade on uniswap. Most market makers, if they knew that they were taking 30 bps on trade, they would mint that trade every single day of the week. Like 30 bps is a very high margin for most market makers. And so if you just go direct to the world's best market makers and allow them to compete head to head with the.
00:10:19.258 - 00:10:27.402, Speaker D: With the fees that are being paid on these on chain amms, the contention, the bet that hash flow is making is that world class market makers will.
00:10:27.418 - 00:10:29.650, Speaker F: Be able to do better once they.
00:10:29.682 - 00:10:51.730, Speaker D: Start serving that DeFi flow directly. And as Varun alluded to, it's completely resistant to MeV. So all the shenanigans of front running and sandwich attacks and this and that, none of it works in Hashlo, because in hash flow, the market maker just gives you a price. You put it on chain and it gets executed. There's nothing a miner can do to mess with it, because it doesn't matter.
00:10:51.762 - 00:10:54.054, Speaker F: What order in which things get executed.
00:10:54.594 - 00:11:00.694, Speaker D: So that's hash flow in a nutshell, and why I think it's so interesting as a new protocol.
00:11:01.274 - 00:11:27.904, Speaker B: Yeah, I do have a few follow ups from that, and I think, before I go to some of those follow ups, I think at this point, a lot of listeners probably wonder. These signature based quotes sound a lot like an RFQ system, as Varun has mentioned. And one of the projects out there that has been working on this for a while is Zero X. So, can you maybe help us take a step back and understand what are the major differences between what hash flow is trying to do and maybe what someone like Zero X's RFQ system is doing?
00:11:31.444 - 00:11:36.700, Speaker C: This is an interesting one, I think. I think she had Tom here to talk about it.
00:11:36.772 - 00:11:37.384, Speaker E: But.
00:11:39.164 - 00:11:40.972, Speaker C: I think, in general, we've made.
00:11:40.988 - 00:11:44.988, Speaker E: The narrative that it's essentially both Zero.
00:11:45.036 - 00:11:47.916, Speaker C: X and Hashlo have been focused, or.
00:11:47.940 - 00:11:56.094, Speaker E: At least in terms of rfqs, we are quite similar in the sense that we're both using RFQ systems to serve.
00:11:56.254 - 00:11:58.030, Speaker C: The end user or a client.
00:11:58.222 - 00:12:01.798, Speaker E: But I think, from architectural standpoint, I.
00:12:01.806 - 00:12:15.074, Speaker C: Think hash flow is very, very different from the way Zero X works, which a kind of makes it more performant, but also allows for more interesting things to do that you could do on Defi.
00:12:16.254 - 00:12:19.552, Speaker E: I think, to be more specific, at.
00:12:19.568 - 00:12:27.040, Speaker C: Least at the moment, Xerox essentially doesn't have a pool based architecture.
00:12:27.232 - 00:12:29.288, Speaker E: So the way Zero X swaps work.
00:12:29.336 - 00:13:03.296, Speaker C: Is the end market maker is having funds in their wallet, or maybe they have their own smart contracts they're using to serve the end Defi counterparty. And most of the trades happen where they sign the quotes, but then the swap happens between two wallets. In case of hash flow, what we decided to do instead is take a pool based approach, where your pool is serving as an inventory for the end user, for the market maker rather.
00:13:03.440 - 00:13:04.904, Speaker E: And the reason we decided to do.
00:13:04.944 - 00:13:21.092, Speaker C: That is because we realized, if you're a smart market maker who is very native to Defi, they already have their own smart contracts that they use as an inventory to trade and serve the rest of DeFi. But for many market makers who are.
00:13:21.108 - 00:13:23.252, Speaker E: Just getting into DeFi, but who also.
00:13:23.308 - 00:13:31.564, Speaker C: Happen to have almost the assets under management, are more than the entire TVL of DeFi. And they are figuring out how DeFi works.
00:13:31.724 - 00:13:34.700, Speaker E: And we are like, if you can just serve or offer them those smart.
00:13:34.732 - 00:14:01.444, Speaker C: Contracts that could be used a to work with and hash low trades, but also just be used as your gateway into any DeFi protocol, by parking capital in the pools, it makes for a much more efficient deployment of capital. And then more importantly, and also more interesting things like crowdsourcing funds from decentralized LP's that they could use to market make.
00:14:02.024 - 00:14:03.432, Speaker E: In which case it becomes very much.
00:14:03.448 - 00:14:16.694, Speaker C: Like a hedge fund or running a designated market making system. Back in traditional current world, what's happening is asset issuer would go to a market maker, then they'll probably do a deal where they're lending out tokens.
00:14:18.954 - 00:14:19.242, Speaker E: And.
00:14:19.258 - 00:14:37.936, Speaker C: Then the market maker will take the tokens, and then they will market make on different venues. So it's a very manual process of how that workflow happens. So essentially, taking that deal flow, the wet code that exists in legal contracts, and we are transforming that into thousand lines of code, where now anybody can.
00:14:37.960 - 00:14:40.552, Speaker E: Just put assets in the pool, and.
00:14:40.568 - 00:14:44.048, Speaker C: Then your assets can be market made by some of the world class market.
00:14:44.096 - 00:14:46.680, Speaker E: Makers, which is something you at least.
00:14:46.712 - 00:15:17.224, Speaker C: Cannot do in current Xerox architecture. So in a nutshell, I think going with a pool based architecture allows you to do far more interesting things than you could if you had just used a pure RFQ, that that does a swap using a proxy between two wallets. And not to mention our gas costs are like nearly 50% cheaper than zero x is 120k trade versus 70k. So that's another advantage just to be.
00:15:17.524 - 00:15:18.452, Speaker E: If you were to go with the.
00:15:18.468 - 00:15:30.288, Speaker C: Pure metrics, I think gas is like more like a. It's scratching the surface. I think there's more interesting things to be done besides gas savings, of course. So, curious.
00:15:30.336 - 00:16:10.294, Speaker D: Well, I would say gas savings are pretty big, especially given where Ethereum mainnet is right now. And if you think about it, part of what I think is so interesting about hash flow's approach is that zero x is kind of a very generalized protocol that's intended to be all things to all men and hash flow. Basically, because it is such a simple protocol, it is designed to do one thing and do one thing very, very well, which is on chain RFQ. That's it. There's nothing else. And so anything else that's extraneous to that goal can just get ripped out. And that allows you to be much more gas optimized and also optimize the experience for the end user, more so than zero x can.
00:16:10.294 - 00:16:41.424, Speaker D: I think that really matters, especially in the world we're in today, where again, we talk about gas costs are not necessarily sexy, but they're very, very tangible now, especially to on chain traders, where essentially a large part of your fixed cost is the gas fee, especially that's pricing out many of these lower cost trades that are having to go onto side chains or finance smart chain, or have to go into L2 s. The more that we can allow low value transactions to be economical on layer one, the better it is for everybody.
00:16:43.404 - 00:17:30.400, Speaker B: Touching on one of the premises that you mentioned, Varun, you mentioned that users will be able to deposit their assets to be market made by some of the best market makers in the world, and ideally maybe with their own customized strategies to compete with each other, to offer better quotes and get more flow. But what I thought was really interesting is that one of the former product managers at Zero X made this point that based on what they saw, the market makers seem to prefer to use a standard set of rules for their orders, and that these private market makers are currently choosing to offer liquidity using, I think, Zero X's off chain orders because of their ease and security, rather than kind of create their own strategies or customized order types or whatnot. So is this something you've observed with market makers on hash flow as well, or is this a concern that you.
00:17:30.432 - 00:17:39.072, Speaker E: Have actually, KK, can you elaborate on the question a bit more? So, so if I'm understanding, actually, could.
00:17:39.088 - 00:17:40.648, Speaker C: You repeat the question one more time?
00:17:40.816 - 00:17:41.200, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:17:41.232 - 00:18:12.174, Speaker B: So I think one of the observations made by a former product market product manager at Zero X is that instead of all of the market makers having very customized strategies when they provide liquidity, all of them are kind of just using a standard set of rules that are preset set of rules for their orders. I'm curious if you've seen any kind of idiosyncratic market making behaviors from the market makers on hash flow today, or are they all pretty much using a very similar strategy?
00:18:12.834 - 00:18:38.738, Speaker E: So I think right now, since we are still in the early stage, where we are just about to plan to remove the gates and go from closed alpha to open alpha. I think at the current state I think most market makers using very primitive strategy which is very similar to what others are doing, although the diff is they're serving different inventories and some market makers specialize in options, the other ones.
00:18:38.906 - 00:18:45.542, Speaker C: Specialize in this or they have an inventory of say doy so they market making those assets and so on.
00:18:45.598 - 00:19:03.006, Speaker E: But in general, I think given that in a close offer we only went for like low TVL and just test out how the product performs in adversarial conditions while the gates are closed, I think I would say we don't have.
00:19:03.030 - 00:19:07.334, Speaker C: A very, very concise answer to that.
00:19:07.374 - 00:19:16.026, Speaker E: Question to see if I have seen anything different. For now, I think most market maker strategies have been consistent with each other in terms of they're using more primitive.
00:19:16.090 - 00:19:18.570, Speaker C: Strategies just to bootstrap things.
00:19:18.682 - 00:19:25.786, Speaker E: But I think we might see more interesting things once we enter open alpha phase, wherever they could get a bit.
00:19:25.810 - 00:19:29.130, Speaker C: More advanced because we also plan to up the TVL by a notch and.
00:19:29.162 - 00:19:32.434, Speaker E: See how it performs as we go.
00:19:32.554 - 00:19:33.866, Speaker B: Now before I continue, I'd like to.
00:19:33.890 - 00:20:24.120, Speaker A: Take a moment to share some exciting companies that made this podcast possible. I'd like to talk about our sponsor, perpetual protocol. If you are worried about leaving your funds on an exchange that may be hacked, but you are also tired of paying for hundreds of dollars in gas fees in deFi, you should really check them out because they have built a fully on chain exchange on Ethereum and Xdai that allows up to ten x leverage. Now, they've also released zero gas deposits in addition to near zero gas fees for trading. And if you're paranoid about smart contract exploits like I am, don't worry because they have also obtained protocol level insurance via nexus mutual and unslashed finance to provide automatic coverage for all traders on perp exchange. Now today, for users outside the US, if you have an Ethereum address, you can already start using perp exchange with no signups. So go to perp exchange blockcrenge to check it out.
00:20:24.120 - 00:21:11.262, Speaker A: That's perp exchange blockcrunch. I'd love to also talk about our sponsor Solana, a high throughput layer one blockchain. Now in the past few months ive probably talked to two dozen teams building exciting new projects on Solana, and this is probably why. First, its incredibly fast with 50,000 transactions per second its cheap, with average fees less than a cent per transaction. That means developers can deploy contracts cheaply and also not have to worry about their apps not being composable with others, as Solana does not use any type of sharding or fragmented L2 systems. Most importantly, Solana is censorship resistant with over 950 validators today. So if you're interested in building fast, scalable blockchain applications, or want to test out the existing ecosystem of Defi applications and more, go to solana.com
00:21:11.262 - 00:21:12.518, Speaker A: blockcrunch.
00:21:12.686 - 00:21:59.674, Speaker B: Haseeb, I think one of my favorite blog posts that you've written is called unbundling Uniswap, and this was written a while ago before the launch of Uniswap V three, which we also discussed on the show. And you mentioned in that block how inefficient Uniswap is because of its design and how inventory is offered at every price level because of the way that the AMM works. And since then, Uniswap has evolved into v three, which allows liquidity providers to provide liquidity or inventory at specific ranges more similar to kind of how someone like Alameda, a professional market maker, might do it, a more simplistic form of how they provide liquidity on an exchange. So do you think that brings it closer to the idea of hash flow? And do you see some sort of maybe convergence happening in the future between something like hash flow and Uniswap?
00:22:00.654 - 00:22:43.538, Speaker D: It's definitely true that Uniswap v three was a huge improvement over the over many of the issues that I raised in that blog post, which talks primarily about Uniswap v two. Uniswap v three, much more capital efficient, allows professional market makers to engage in better sort of liquidity concentration around the mid market price or less. Liquidity is wasted in the wings, where it's not really doing anything. There are still some principal shortfalls, though, of Uniswap's v three. So I mean Uniswap v three, obviously the place where amms really shine, as I highlight in one of those articles, is in pricing stable assets. So two different kinds of bitcoin pegged tokens. Amazing.
00:22:43.538 - 00:22:55.962, Speaker D: Amms are perfect at that very, very minimal improvement that can be made by getting a professional market maker to market make two assets that are completely mean reverting. But the universe of assets in crypto is quite large.
00:22:56.098 - 00:22:57.114, Speaker F: The things that we care about are.
00:22:57.154 - 00:23:31.316, Speaker D: Very big, and one of the types of assets that really does not lend itself well to something like Uniswap are basically assets that are not delta one, as you said, or assets that assets especially that have very high volatility or that will exhibit very high impermanent loss. It's one of the reasons why on Uniswap, what we're seeing is, one, Uniswap is obviously very successful. It's dominant today. But we're also seeing that on Defi, overwhelmingly, the assets are being traded are spot. There's almost no derivatives volume on chain. On a relative basis, it's like 90 plus percent spot.
00:23:31.500 - 00:23:35.612, Speaker F: And if you look in Cefi, it's.
00:23:35.628 - 00:23:40.964, Speaker D: The other way around. Overwhelming majority of what's traded in c five is derivatives.
00:23:41.124 - 00:23:42.980, Speaker F: So why is there this divergence?
00:23:43.172 - 00:23:46.052, Speaker D: And I'd contend that a large part of the reason is that it's really.
00:23:46.108 - 00:23:50.024, Speaker F: Hard to price derivatives in an amm.
00:23:50.484 - 00:24:22.654, Speaker D: Especially when they're high volatility. So having something like hash flow, which can bridge the boundary between c five and defi, I think, is one of the important stepping stones to being able to get a fuller, a fuller ecosystem of asset types, especially ones that are not as low volatility as something like ethusd or stablecoin, to stablecoin, getting liquidity, price discovery, and the flywheel starting to come online in deFi. For these kinds of assets to also.
00:24:22.694 - 00:24:23.554, Speaker F: Be traded.
00:24:25.374 - 00:24:32.814, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. And I'd love to take this chance to pivot and talk about maybe some of the trade offs that comes with this massive increase in efficiency.
00:24:32.854 - 00:24:33.030, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:33.062 - 00:25:05.764, Speaker B: So one of the things that came to mind is the point about censorship resistance, because obviously, on Uniswap, anyone with a laptop can provide liquidity from anywhere. And for Hashlo, it sounds like that is more nuanced, where you have the part where everyone can provide liquidity, but then the people who can actually execute the trades will probably have to be whitelisted. They have to be kind of professional market makers. Is there a concern about kind of permissionlessness, or giving up some permissionlessness, or do you think that's really not something that users would care about at the end of the day?
00:25:06.344 - 00:26:29.274, Speaker E: So I think from the end user perspective, the trades on hash flows are just as permissionless as you would find on any other amms, because I think the UX is extremely similar, or it's the same experience that you would see on Uniswap, where you go and you request for a quote and then you execute the trade, and your trades cannot be censored by anybody. So I think the trade off would come in the form of anybody being able to just quickly spin up a pool and start serving, and the smart contract will take care of the rest, which was at least the concept in V two. With V three, I think you have to set price ranges and then hope that your price range selection was going to update prices consistently. Which is weirdly like Kyber actually in many ways, where you're broadcasting trades consistently. Sorry, the price is on chain consistently. But the good thing is anybody can permissionlessly just add any asset and it will be available for trades almost instantly. And I think one of the things that we've been looking into currently, at least so far, because we are using market makers, and there is a bit of a initial setup cost associated not just with creating the pool, but also setting up the RFQ system.
00:26:30.854 - 00:26:32.974, Speaker C: And most market makers may not take.
00:26:33.014 - 00:27:49.984, Speaker E: The risk of listing an asset like Shiba Inu or Elon coin when the markets are really, really crazy. In those circumstances, I think uniswap is actually probably going to win, because it's really, really easy for anybody to just create liquidity around those assets. But I think at the end of the day, I think our thesis has been that for 80% to 90% of the time, I think most market makers would serve the assets that are predominantly blue chips, or at least popular among most people. So in which case we should be able to serve quotes on assets that are like a blue chip, but then also there is enough liquidity around them, but also the rising stars that has more demand, but also not just a token that's been issued by some random person. And then there's liquidity needed. But more important, like to Hazeep's point, I think very, really shine is being able to provide pricing for assets that cannot be priced on Amms. And if you look at this traditional markets, I think options and futures is like thousand x, bigger than spot market.
00:27:49.984 - 00:28:21.534, Speaker E: And currently, again, there's no protocol or AMM experience that allows anybody to trade those assets effortlessly. And I think that there is a big gap that we could fill, and then we can bring a whole new class of liquidity into deFi, where we are able to allow for pricing and trading of these non delta one assets more freely and permissionlessly as you would trade spot assets on Uniswap, for example.
00:28:22.794 - 00:28:56.690, Speaker D: I'd also add, going back to the question of censorship resistance, the one nice thing about the hash flow interface is that anytime that you look at, you say, look, I want to make a trade. Obviously unlikely, because as a market maker, you just want to serve flow. But let's imagine that for some reason, the market maker just states you in particular, and is not willing to serve you hash flow automatically. Also ping Xeniswap and sushiswap to compare price such that if the market maker is on the platform don't serve you a better price than Uniswap or sushiswap.
00:28:56.842 - 00:28:58.694, Speaker F: It automatically routes you there instead.
00:28:59.514 - 00:29:10.174, Speaker D: So in the case that there is a user who for some reason is such an asshole that nobody wants to serve him, then they can automatically just go to uniswap or sushiswap, which everyone is serving you a better price.
00:29:11.274 - 00:29:20.574, Speaker B: And as a tangent of that, putting on the vc hat for a moment here, do you think hash flow is a super set of something uniswap? Then?
00:29:25.804 - 00:29:26.744, Speaker D: I wouldn't.
00:29:28.084 - 00:29:29.664, Speaker C: I would say yes and no.
00:29:30.284 - 00:29:44.076, Speaker E: Big big or big big. Because, you know, I see why you would think about that in that direction. Because if you're not getting the quotes, then we'll direct our quotes to Uniswap, in which case we really become some.
00:29:44.140 - 00:29:47.814, Speaker C: Kind of an aggregator. But by the same time, really also.
00:29:48.874 - 00:29:56.690, Speaker E: I guess the answer could be a yes, but that's a tricky one. But I think I'd say, as the.
00:29:56.722 - 00:30:27.174, Speaker D: Actual VC with my hat on to begin with, I wouldn't say that Haflo is a superset of Uniswap per se. I think they both very clearly have their strengths and both have their weaknesses. What I would say is that what hasflow really does. Does. Is it one, it fills in many of Uniswap's weaknesses and complements uniswap in many important ways. There are some things, again, that Uniswap is just absolutely knocked down the right solution to. And as Veren mentioned, there are many long tail assets.
00:30:27.174 - 00:31:00.098, Speaker D: A huge part of volume is long tail assets, and most of those long tail assets are not going to be priced through hash flow because market makers just aren't. They're not going to figure out that, oh, hey, the market market really loves Shiba token. I'm going to go find Shiba token and start market making it, especially when you can't hedge it. There's no perp on Shiba, or at least maybe at a certain time. There is not. That's just not the kind of game that market makers are in. So it's quite likely in my mind that Uniswap is going to be the place where you're going to get the best liquidity on many, many assets.
00:31:00.098 - 00:31:34.784, Speaker D: But I think over the long run, when it comes to boat the head, meaning the sort of blue chips, the one that are in most demand, that market makers are going to be most aggressively competing on where they're used to taking very, very small margins on market making like ETH, USDC market makers will take razor thin margins on that pricing, much lower than what Uniswap generally charges in its 30 bps. And in addition to that, the kinds of assets that Uniswap can't price. But on the things where Uniswap is unequivocally better, I think it's going to remain a part of the pantheon of Defi.
00:31:35.964 - 00:32:14.614, Speaker B: That makes sense. And going back to this discussion about trade offs as well, one thing that I was thinking about was for Uniswap, obviously, there's this massive issue around MeV, this minor extractable value which we could dedicate an entire episode to, which we're actually doing a few weeks from now. But for something like hash flow, it seems to me that that problem wouldn't be as prominent, given that these trades are executed directly by market makers. So can you guys maybe talk a little bit about how you think about MeV in the context of hash flow, and maybe even provide any type of data that you guys might have seen in terms of what that looks like versus something like Uniswap?
00:32:15.234 - 00:32:35.372, Speaker E: So, yeah, I can go into a bit more detail around that, but to start with, I think MeV is not as much of a relevant problem to hash flow because of the way it's been designed. But we can also go into context of why MeV happens on uniswap and other amms, and then why actually, we.
00:32:35.388 - 00:32:41.504, Speaker B: Should probably take a step back here and just to define what Mev is for listeners first, just in case they don't understand.
00:32:43.204 - 00:32:43.944, Speaker C: Sure.
00:32:44.884 - 00:33:01.710, Speaker E: So me is a minor extractable value, but I think now it's become maximal extractable value. So I think, I think we're defining multiple ways to what MEV means or the abbreviation. But I think the TLDR is whenever.
00:33:01.822 - 00:33:04.646, Speaker C: A user sends a transaction, the miner.
00:33:04.710 - 00:33:08.314, Speaker E: Gets to reorg or put those transactions in the block.
00:33:08.894 - 00:33:12.366, Speaker C: Which means technically, your miner has the.
00:33:12.390 - 00:33:14.294, Speaker E: Last look on every trade.
00:33:14.374 - 00:33:15.702, Speaker C: In many ways, it's not the market.
00:33:15.758 - 00:33:33.614, Speaker E: Maker, it's not the trader, but your miner has the last look on what the trade looks like. Which means they could typically use that to the advantage to reorg the block in such a way that they can actually benefit from those trades. Especially because in amms that use bonding.
00:33:33.654 - 00:33:36.798, Speaker C: Curve, where each trade would result in.
00:33:36.846 - 00:34:50.602, Speaker E: Change in the price in either direction, they could basically use that to do essentially extract value or benefit or arbitrary the trade in ways that you cannot typically do otherwise if you were not using bonding curve. That is. I think that also results in and then the same property of bonding curve could also result in other attacks like sandwich attacks, where someone can essentially, once a trade is so you can buy an asset for a price knowing that somebody else is going to buy it. Because if you buy something on a bonding curve, its price is going to move in the other direction. And then you can arb somebody by letting them buy the asset at a higher price, and then you can sell it back to the system at a much, much lower price to make profit out of that. So which is a sandwich attack? You could do these things because we're using bonding curve, or the x times y equals k, at least in amms. And as a result, the way the asset is being priced is the reason why you could do or pull off such attacks if you were to trade to an amm.
00:34:50.602 - 00:35:14.588, Speaker E: And the reason I said that MeV attack is almost irrelevant to Hashno is because the price is already agreed upon between the trader and the market maker beforehand, and it's signed by the market maker. And at that point it doesn't matter how the transaction is.org within the block, it will always execute the trade at the same price and give the user the same asset that they saw previously.
00:35:14.756 - 00:35:16.268, Speaker C: So in many ways, you could also.
00:35:16.316 - 00:35:31.700, Speaker E: Say it's like there is no slippage because you get what you agreed to and there's no price variation because someone else traded before you did. So wait, did I cover everything or did I miss anything?
00:35:31.732 - 00:35:34.208, Speaker C: Haseeb I mean, the one thing I.
00:35:34.216 - 00:36:17.958, Speaker D: Would add is that MEV, it's increasingly become termed as the MEV crisis on Ethereum. And a large part of why this is a crisis is that it used to be that MEV was largely, it was a relatively small phenomenon that happened at the margin. Occasionally people would lose some money because there were front running attacks in the mempool. Now, it's increasingly become the case case that almost all mining pools institutionally extract as much value as they can without making transactions fail by reordering and basically stuffing around transactions that are happening in any given block. And so the thing about this that's.
00:36:18.006 - 00:36:23.646, Speaker F: So nasty is that users for the most part, don't really know it's happening.
00:36:23.830 - 00:37:05.172, Speaker D: There's no real way to surface to yourself like, hey, I lost money today, or I got a worse price than I would have otherwise gotten because I got front run, or because I got sandwich attacked, or because miners mess around with the block and found some clever way in order to maximize their own upside to a user. It's totally transparent. But actually, since the advent of flashbots, which is one of the big companies that's working on the public visibility and also the institutionalization of MEV extraction, they've shown that in the month of May, which I think it's something about 300 million in MEV that was extracted through their platform, or rather, they detected in.
00:37:05.188 - 00:37:10.824, Speaker F: MEV through their platform, 300 million that was extracted last month.
00:37:11.404 - 00:37:31.544, Speaker D: Now, all the users who lost money via that MEV getting extracted, if you think about it, if you were trading on an exchange and you knew that the exchange operator was just reordering transactions in order to find ways to make money, they were inserting their own transactions. They were front running people, back running people, doing all sorts of nonsense. You'd be like, what the fuck is this? I'm not going to trade this exchange. That's insane.
00:37:32.164 - 00:37:34.584, Speaker F: That has become ethereum defi.
00:37:36.764 - 00:37:54.348, Speaker D: Increasingly, what you're seeing from protocols in response to this is that they're finding ways to become more nav resistant, finding more ways that miners cannot manipulate the economic activity that's taking place on that platform. And hash flow is a perfect example of that.
00:37:54.396 - 00:37:54.820, Speaker F: In that.
00:37:54.892 - 00:38:14.384, Speaker D: In hash flow, doesn't matter how malicious the miners are, you're doing an economic activity on an exchange. Even if the exchange operator is crooked, it doesn't matter, because you and the market maker, who you're dealing with, you two have already agreed on the price, and the smart contract guarantees that the execution of that price cannot be messed with.
00:38:16.124 - 00:38:40.944, Speaker B: That makes sense. And as we come to the final part of the interview, I'd love to kind of zoom out a little bit and think about what's still missing from hash flow, in your opinion, is the goal to overtake most of the volumes in Defi today? And if so, what are the other pieces that you still have to build out and that you still like to see on hash flow before that happens? And feel free to, either of you, feel free to take this.
00:38:41.804 - 00:39:15.344, Speaker E: Yeah, I think I can present my take, and I'll have Haseeb see what he's going to add there. So I think right now, we are in the opening. We are still in the first innings of how things are going to pan out. But I think when we started, I think that the biggest things we had was since we are so focused on getting world class market makers on board to provide liquidity here, that was the first on how do we get these people to participate?
00:39:16.164 - 00:39:17.508, Speaker C: And I think, I'm glad to say.
00:39:17.516 - 00:39:53.732, Speaker E: That we finally got into the position where we pretty much have every market maker you can think of we are working with them at the moment. So I think that solves for the bootstrapping problem. But now I think the next stage is the deal flow, the demand, which obviously we haven't gone fully live yet. So right now the numbers are not very, very glamorous. But I think that's something we expecting to change or expect to change in the upcoming weeks once we remove the gates and access codes and anybody can just go 3d trade.
00:39:53.908 - 00:39:56.524, Speaker C: And it's still an alpha phase because.
00:39:56.564 - 00:40:20.926, Speaker E: We haven't completed all the audits yet. And I think many audits won't be fully done until October or November. So we are still calling it alpha. And we might even start with like basic blue chips like USDC, DAi, USDT and ETH and then see how well can we perform with those assets. And I think if you're able to get the volumes that we expect that.
00:40:20.950 - 00:40:21.982, Speaker C: We have in mind, I think that.
00:40:21.998 - 00:40:30.278, Speaker E: Would be a good start towards saying we're able to now get deal flows from various aggregators and also directly from just hash, two.com and so on.
00:40:30.406 - 00:40:31.726, Speaker C: So I think once we have the.
00:40:31.750 - 00:41:08.374, Speaker E: Demand flow and the take a flow now, I think at that point it becomes a scaling problem in terms of what other new assets can we add to get this going. But I think eventually the goal is to bring all kinds of asset classes that are currently possible on Defi into Defi through the way we've designed and architected things which allows for such a thing to happen, which includes the non delta one assets and also markets that cannot be effectively made on l one currently in the way they've been designed.
00:41:08.534 - 00:41:10.542, Speaker C: And while addressing the issues that we.
00:41:10.558 - 00:41:24.514, Speaker E: Just talked about, including Mav, Anta, phone training and other attacks. Although I'd be keen to see what kind of new attacks can be launched into this, hopefully we'll get to see them in the open launch.
00:41:26.834 - 00:42:02.830, Speaker D: Yeah, I would echo that. I'm excited to see hash flow come live. It's super cool to see just a transformation from this world where in the world of Uniswap, in the world of amms, there's so much opportunity cost to having a pool being live if the trading volume isn't really there yet. The beautiful thing about hash flow, which is, I think, very attractive to a lot of protocols that would like to work with incentivizing liquidity of this type, is that the opportunity cost isn't there anymore. There's no permanent loss if you have an effective mechanism for off chain pricing.
00:42:03.022 - 00:42:04.274, Speaker F: Doesn't cost you anything.
00:42:05.094 - 00:42:37.678, Speaker D: The money sits there and it waits for somebody to show up. And you can serve any amount of volume with a very small amount of TVL or a very small amount of inventory as a market maker would categorize it, because you're not trying to do anything too cute or anything too complicated. You're just bridging the old world and the new world using a very simple and lightweight protocol that stands in between. So I would love to see this thing come out to the world and see what people can get creative about integrating it into the different protocols that.
00:42:37.686 - 00:42:39.870, Speaker F: Are out there and that are live. Yeah.
00:42:39.902 - 00:43:05.594, Speaker E: Because what's interesting is last year if I had pitched the same idea to any institutional person, they would have been like, no, in fact, experience at firsthand where if you had said, like, we're going to use smart contracts for storing assets, they would be like, no, that's, that's ridiculous. Like, why would anyone do that, right? Like, we should be using Coinbase custody or bitgo before doing that, right? So, so.
00:43:06.454 - 00:43:07.882, Speaker C: And now, a year and a half.
00:43:07.928 - 00:43:14.048, Speaker E: Later, it's like, if you say smart contract custody, if you don't say that, then that's considered weird.
00:43:14.206 - 00:43:15.956, Speaker C: In fact, the paradigm has already changed.
00:43:15.980 - 00:43:42.610, Speaker E: To the point where people are excited to participate in DeFi, and this is the institution also. In fact, some of the traditional finance folks are also starting to show interest in participating in such. In fact, a couple of weeks ago, a couple of days ago, someone mentioned us on Bloomberg that this is one of the protocols that is quite promising in terms of bringing even traditional finance liquidity into DeFi.
00:43:42.642 - 00:43:45.002, Speaker C: So I think, which is why I.
00:43:45.018 - 00:43:51.586, Speaker E: Think the future seems quite exciting and bright given that. Given that, how much we've come since.
00:43:51.770 - 00:43:55.714, Speaker C: Within like a year, really, because this was like last year when people said.
00:43:55.794 - 00:43:57.194, Speaker E: Smart contract because it is ridiculous.
00:43:57.234 - 00:43:59.002, Speaker C: And now that's how they want to.
00:43:59.018 - 00:44:00.494, Speaker E: Serve the deal flows.
00:44:02.274 - 00:44:17.604, Speaker B: Yeah, most definitely. And I'd love for our listeners to try out the hash flow product as well and keep up to date with what's going on next. So for people who want to keep posted on what you're building next and what's coming out next with hash flow, what are the best channels they can check out today?
00:44:18.624 - 00:44:36.944, Speaker E: So currently, I think we're quite active on Discord, discord and Twitter. But mainly discord is where all the activity is happening. But for anyone who wants to come and start trading, you should just go to hashla.com and you can get started instantly.
00:44:38.164 - 00:44:44.144, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, thank you both so much for taking the time to come on the show. This has been really educational, and I can't wait to share this.
00:44:44.604 - 00:44:45.652, Speaker C: No, absolutely.
00:44:45.708 - 00:44:47.244, Speaker D: Thank you so much, Jason. This is great.
