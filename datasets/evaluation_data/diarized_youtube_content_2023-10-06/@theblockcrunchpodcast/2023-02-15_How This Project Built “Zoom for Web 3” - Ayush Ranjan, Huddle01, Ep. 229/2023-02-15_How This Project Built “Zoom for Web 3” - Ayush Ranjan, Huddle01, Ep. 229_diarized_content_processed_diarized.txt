00:00:02.040 - 00:00:08.714, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, gentlemen, welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto.
00:00:17.214 - 00:00:41.010, Speaker B: And before we get started, just a reminder for you guys out there, the Blockcrunch podcast is intended for informational purposes only.

Today's episode is brought to you by.
00:00:41.042 - 00:00:52.814, Speaker A: Protocol labs, the guys behind Filecoin. And with us today is Colin Efrin from Filecoin, who can tell us a little bit more about what's one interesting way that people have used Filecoin to build? So, Colin, take it away.
00:00:53.234 - 00:00:53.546, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:53.570 - 00:01:33.064, Speaker D: Filecoin has been used to store hundreds of petabytes of web two data, helping web3 cross the chasm into, what I would argue, mass adoption. Developers have built onboarding platforms like singularity, estuary, and file drive, and more to mimic s three interfaces and onboard datasets like genocide testimonials from the Shoah Foundation, New York government public datasets, and large scientific data sets from universities like UC Berkeley. Within web3, Falcon has been able to provide redundancy for our top NFT platforms like Magic Eden OpenSea, storing a large fraction of web3's nfts and secure gaming assets through Unreal Engine five.
00:01:33.724 - 00:01:39.676, Speaker A: Hello there. Now, before I move on, I'd love to thank the hundreds of you who have subscribed to blockch VIP, because with.
00:01:39.700 - 00:01:41.156, Speaker B: Your support, I've been able to share.
00:01:41.180 - 00:01:59.446, Speaker A: My real thoughts on specific projects that I don't usually share on interviews in a format that I enjoy more, which is bi weekly written posts, we've also been able to offer exclusive AMA's, sharing my investment frameworks, interactable models, and breaking down important trends before they become bigger. Now, we even had Elon Musk comment on one of our threads recently.
00:01:59.590 - 00:02:01.350, Speaker B: So if you haven't already, head on.
00:02:01.382 - 00:02:04.126, Speaker A: Over to theblockcrench.com VIP and you can.
00:02:04.150 - 00:02:06.062, Speaker B: Access dozens of hours of research for.
00:02:06.078 - 00:02:58.540, Speaker A: What you'd spend on a coffee a day. Hey, everybody, welcome back to another episode of the BlockCrunch podcast. Now, this week we're going to continue our exploration of the Filecoin ecosystem, who is a gracious sponsor of the show by talking to projects that are building using Filecoin. And if you've talked to me from as a project or as another fund, or as an as an investor, you know that one of my biggest interests is in applications that actually attract real users beyond the crypto natives. And I'm constantly on the lookout for products that are trying to launch into a broader market and not just build for us dgens. And a lot of these products tend to sit on the intersection between web two and web3. And one of the really interesting one that I actually came across way before Filecoin became a sponsor, actually a product that I stumbled upon was called Huddle, which is a video chat streaming recording application built on top of Filecoin.
00:02:58.540 - 00:03:17.144, Speaker A: It's a web3 native application, which I think is really interesting. And I personally used the demo as well with the founder, Ayush. And I had a great time just seeing the future of products like this. So I'm really, really excited to have the founder, Yoosh, on the show to talk to us more about huddle and how it's leveraging filecoin as well. So welcome to the show.
00:03:18.104 - 00:03:28.564, Speaker C: Thanks, Jason. Thanks for having me. And it was great chatting with you. I think five months back we had a good chat in hello as well where we had a discussion on what we have been building. So thank you for having me.
00:03:29.424 - 00:03:39.804, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. So now, for those of the listeners who are maybe not by a laptop right now and can't click around on a demo, can you explain a little bit about what you're working on and what you're building?
00:03:40.264 - 00:04:08.396, Speaker C: Absolutely. So Ardal Zero one is a communication toolkit for Web three, where we have a three pronged approach. The first is what you mentioned very correctly. It's a proper dapp, like it's a decentralized application which is exactly like Google Meet or Zoom or Microsoft Teams, but uses all the crypto primitives like NFT SEO avatars. It uses recordings, which is get stored over Filecoin. You can do all the things you can do on Google Meet and Zoom, on Huddle Zero one as well. And it's just that you don't need to do it in a web to native manner.
00:04:08.396 - 00:04:45.432, Speaker C: So for example, if you want to log in, you don't log in via your Google authentication, you log in via your wallets, or you can do a guest login. So now you can have much more freedom of expression. And then you can use your NFT as your avatars when you're having a chat, both as an AR and a VR filter. And then if you want to store this recordings, you can store those recordings very securely over two things. Number one, on hot storage over ipfs, that means if you want to quickly just store them, share the recordings with people, you can do that. And if you want to store the recordings for a longer period of time, then you can use Filecoin to store those recordings. If you want to live stream, you can use where we use something called as live peer as well, where you can just live stream that call onto multiple places in one click.
00:04:45.432 - 00:05:15.112, Speaker C: For example on Zoom, you can do it only on YouTube, at Hudlow one you can do at three places in one click. For example on Twitch on YouTube, or also on your own player. So that increases your distribution. At the end of the day, that's the first layer. We have done more than 1 million minute of meetings on the platform. Masari is one of our top, I'll say clients who uses Arlo one for live streaming cases. That means they want to do a video conferencing and live stream over to YouTube and a couple of Daos, NFT based communities, they love using it because of all these mitre of features.
00:05:15.112 - 00:05:48.244, Speaker C: Apart from that, you can do token gated meetings. That means let's suppose if I'm doing a proper meeting in any Dao, and that Dao needs to have a, have their own tokens. So now instead of using your own authentication system, you can use just do a proper token gated meetings. That means if you have that NFT or that co op or that lens profile, you can just create your own custom filters and only those people can enter those meetings who have those particular filters set. So now you have a much more. You're just adding that social layer on top of your authentication without capturing your data. So that's the first layer of hardlow one.
00:05:48.244 - 00:06:19.456, Speaker C: The second is the infrastructure. That means your SDKs. So now people can use our SDKs and build any kind of audio and video apps which they want to build. So if they, if they're building a decentralized discord, or a telegram or a WhatsApp, they need an audio, video or messaging, so they can directly use a plug and play SDKs and build any kind of things they want to build on top of. And the third is the end game of f one. That's the protocol layer. That means if I use Jason and Juan from Filecoin are having a chat, and if Jason has a good Internet connection, he can become a node and he can power the call of all three of us.
00:06:19.456 - 00:06:56.434, Speaker C: So instead of relying on a central server like AWS, we are right now using a compute and bandwidth of Jason who also has a good Internet connection and he's the one who's powering the calls. So we are solving three things here, privacy and security. Performance issues with having much more freedom of expressions. And third, at the end of the day is your low, like you are having a better economy. That means you are having a bottom up economy rather than using a top down economy. So value is captured by users, for users. And yeah, that's the overall crux of hurdle one, we have been a team of 25 people now and yeah, building strong for the last two years.
00:06:57.134 - 00:07:39.824, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm really excited about conversations like this because, you know, for the past four years, so much of the attention has been focused on infrastructure. Everyone's building layer ones or messaging protocols and not enough people are building products that actually leverage all of these. And just from that first sentence alone, you mentioned using Filecoin for storage for some of the video streams, using live peer to stream, using lens, maybe as an NFT profile for people to sign on. I think that's just the beginning of the type of applications that we can see. I guess a broader question that's related is what do you think is wrong with web two incumbents right now? Like with Google Meets or like say twitch or Zoom? What can huddle offer that I guess solves that problem that you see?
00:07:40.684 - 00:08:08.984, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. So I think I'll just go back to the time when we started huddle one back in ETH Global Hackfest 2020. The idea was pretty simple that everybody was talking about decentralization Web 3.0. And the meetings were happening over these web two incumbents like Zoom and Google Meet. And this was the time when actually few of these players were actually facing a class action lawsuit for the privacy kind of issues which were happening. So the first thing will go on the layer of your first click. That is your Google oauth.
00:08:08.984 - 00:08:36.476, Speaker C: You're authenticating yourselves for that. You're giving your email, you're giving your ip, you're giving your personal identifiable information. So that's the first kind of bottleneck which happens where your data actually is now not only yours, that's how you're logging into it. So that's the first layer. The second layer comes in the problem of performance issues. So the way the current architecture of video conferencing or the current architecture of communication is built, it uses a central made of transfers. For example, if you are in Singapore, I am in India.
00:08:36.476 - 00:08:55.556, Speaker C: The servers are generally based in North Virginia and us because that's where the cheapest servers are. So all your audio and video packets are routed through a central server. In us. Then it comes back. Now these packets are transferring via something called, as these are UDP packets, they transfer via optic fiber cable by speed of light. And then it comes back to you and me. That leads to.
00:08:55.556 - 00:09:43.914, Speaker C: And the more it travels, the more there's heat loss. The more there is heat loss of these packets, the more there is jitter buffer latency. So that's again the issue which happens. And that's something which you have seen in India a lot, which we closely saw because in India a lot of the tier two and tier three cities where the bandwidth is not good. And when COVID happened, they had to go and stay at home and while doing the calls, so they had to use zoom in tandem with their WhatsApp so that they could have, because the latency was so high, they need to ask that, hey, what did the teacher say exactly? Because the latency was so high they were not able to even do the calls. Now it has such a spiral down snowball effect that now that rote learning happened for two years. Now imagine for a 6th grader not able to have a good conversation for two years with their teachers, that leads to such a spiral on effect of education.
00:09:43.914 - 00:10:45.370, Speaker C: So performance is the second issue and the third is that all the value which is getting accrued, that means the good conversion which we are having, all the value which is accrued is captured essentially by two players, either the platform or by the centralized server providers like AWS, Azure, GCP and stuff like that. So these are the major problems on the level of the deep level problems. And if you talk about maybe expressions and stuff like that and new primitives which are out there, like for example nfts which I believe is the most expressive crypto primitive out there now for you can now use your nfts. Like we've seen a lot of schools doing that right now as well, where you can use, because student don't need to like use, they don't want to switch on the video when they're doing a call with their, with their teacher. So what they do is they switch off the video and then they're done. They're like, hey, I'm not doing anything now. But now when you have these kind of engagement things where now you have a NFT as an AR filter, the engagement increases because they need a new kind of engagement metrics on how do we capture the attention of students at the end of the day.
00:10:45.370 - 00:11:20.978, Speaker C: So that's where nfts are adding a very interesting kind of value which we have been seeing with a couple of schools which we are testing out with in us specifically. So I think these are the couple of layers. And then comes the point of even the unit economics of the companies. Now, all the recordings which happen on education, it happens in any kind of daos or it happens any kind of healthcare industries. All these, these are very confidential data, number one. Plus they need to store all these data for a long period of time. Now, if you compound those data over year, like days over days, months over months and years over years, it's a large amount of data.
00:11:20.978 - 00:12:10.914, Speaker C: And aws s three is not cheap. It's very, very expensive. And that's where you require a better solution, which is much more cheaper. And Filecoin's negative price, the how they have the U D economics, the negative price, storage, leads to even your price being virtually zero. Like you are not actually paying anything for storing such a humongous amount of data onto file coin. So I think this like, obliterates or helps a lot of industries, like education, healthcare, event house, where the recordings are taking place on a. On a very large level, and in general as a whole, the three things which I mentioned, from performance to privacy and to the overall your bottom of economy, this will help in creating new kind, new era of apps, which are much more, which doesn't have a denial of service and which is not controlled by central incumbents.
00:12:12.344 - 00:12:35.884, Speaker A: And before we dive into how this is possible, like how you guys built this, I guess, is there a trade off? Because it sounds amazing, right? It sounds like this is decentralized. You can more efficiently allocate your bandwidth to people on a call who may have more bandwidth, and you can increase retention or engagement for people using. But is there a trade off with this? Is this something that's very expensive to run, or maybe it's slower in some instances, or.
00:12:36.364 - 00:13:14.020, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. It's a great question. And this is something which we have been dabbling for the last two years. So, as you mentioned very correctly on the first point, which you said that we have built a lot of infrastructures, lot of messaging infrastructure have come into play, lot of other infrastructures have been coming to play since 2017, but we haven't seen good apps built on top of. And the reason behind that, which I believe is that we have a lot of research based assumptions on which we build infrastructures rather than user driven, feedback driven, data driven inputs. So what we did was that we built the infrastructure first, but we didn't open the infrastructure for public to use or for developers to use. We built our own app on top of our own infrastructure.
00:13:14.020 - 00:14:02.964, Speaker C: So the first app on the infrastructure of huddle Zero one was our own app. And once we built the app for the last two years, we focused completely on building an app, which is an iconic product in itself, which can compete with the likes of Google, looks exactly similar, and in fact has some new kind of parameters which people will love to have a much better, I'll say much better drop off rate, a very less drop of rate because people are loving these new kind of experiences. So we started off with an approach of product first, progressive decentralization. So right now at Hudlo one, what you see decentralized are your authentication layers, your recordings, your live streamings. But what is still not decentralized completely is the audio and video. We do peer to peer calls for up to four people. But post that we still rely on central servers, which is geographically located because we need to provide a better service.
00:14:02.964 - 00:14:35.960, Speaker C: Now, over time, what we are building is something called as divergent. So now once we see that a lot of so it's a game of demand versus supply by first solving a demand on the lay on huddle one platform and the infrastructures. And over time we'll do a proper slider instead of a switch. We'll progressively decentralize it because the protocol is ready. And now we'll use it for people to run the nodes. Right now it's just checking that how protocol is performing as compared to the central servers. And once we see that the performance is comparable or even better, that's where we'll completely do that slider move.
00:14:35.960 - 00:14:47.724, Speaker C: And similar to how an Apple iOS update from 14.1 to 14.2 happens, similar. It will happen that hey, we are having an update and we are just shifting from central servers to a proper decentralized nodes.
00:14:49.224 - 00:15:01.244, Speaker A: And that's actually a really great pivot because I want to talk about the infrastructure that's making this possible. So can you briefly explain what is the decentralized infra behind Huddle Zero one today? And how does Filecoin fit in that picture there?
00:15:01.624 - 00:15:19.960, Speaker C: Absolutely. So for any kind of video, audio and video, there are a couple of layers which are very important. The first layer is your directly synchronous communication, that is audio and video, which requires UDP packets. The second, which is very important layer is live streaming. That means you live stream. This calls into multiple places. And the third layer is recording.
00:15:19.960 - 00:15:58.528, Speaker C: So these are three major components of any kind of audio and video kind of experience, which even includes asynchronous level of chat. So for audio and video, we use something called as WebRTC protocol. WebRTC protocol is something which has been developing since 2000. And that's where we have started building on WebRTC as a protocol that we upgraded the WebRTC protocol by writing our own code in c to make it much more performant, much more lighter. At the end of the day, the second layer is the live stream. So second layer is the live streaming, which uses something called as HLS and dash technology. That's where we, instead of using the central components, we use something called as live peer because they are solving for live streaming aspect of things here.
00:15:58.528 - 00:16:48.060, Speaker C: So we use live peer, where the encoding and decoding of this audio video happens via live peer protocol, which is again, in a done in a proper GPU based fashion. If Jason has a good gpu, he can become a proper encoder, a transcoder. He can transcode the audio and video in a much more methodical fashion. And the third component is your recordings. So recordings right now happens over two places, either over aws s three, or over glacier. Now the problem with that is, again, denial of service, extremely high costings, and that's where Filecoin comes into picture. And that's where all the audio, the intellectual matter of any kind of content of any human connections, it gets stored over ipfs on the hot layer and file con, on the core layer, on the audio and video part, which is the first layer, the web RTC part, we are upgrading from WebRTC to DRTC.
00:16:48.060 - 00:17:27.494, Speaker C: That means decentralized real time communication. So that's where divergent comes into picture. So divergent is our, is our open, like it will be proper, open, neutral, borderless and decentralized and trustless kind of source where you can run your own divergent nodes. It will be live in by Q three of 2022, where now Jason or AYuSh can run their own divergent nodes. And by that they can essentially do a proper algorithmically routed video calls. Where if we are in Singapore, and if, let's suppose Jason is in Singapore, he can run the node himself and he can power the call of all of us. So that's the kind of three pronged approach we have on the layer of audio and video itself.
00:17:28.554 - 00:17:46.374, Speaker A: Good. Why was it important to be able to store the data decentrally? And I guess out there, there's multiple different offerings right now, I think there's storage that's been around for a while. Sia for decentralized storage. Arweave. So why did you guys decide to go with Filecoin? And ipfs.
00:17:46.964 - 00:18:22.294, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. So one thing which was very important for us was when we are storing our filecoin, the replication factor really helped us. The number of miners were so high. So once you're storing the data, it's very, very important that the data remains, number one, safe. And number two, there's like stamper, like it's proper, there's no tamper to be happening. And if any kind of thing happened to the node, there is a replication factor involved as well. So file can, first of all, is one of the largest, like it's doing, I think, 100 x more than in terms of storage as compared to rv, which is coming the second on the second, and then maybe the third would be storage there.
00:18:22.294 - 00:18:58.734, Speaker C: So that's one of the reasons. Second was replication factor. So what we saw very easily was that I could have a replication factor of ten. That means if I'm doing a recording with Jason right now, even if the recording, let's suppose get like, if the node somehow behaves in an erratic fashion, I'm still able to have nine more replication factors of it. That means the data remains much more safer here because now you have multiple duplicate copies of the data onto different places. So these are a couple of reasons where we believe that that led to lower costings and also much more better replication factor, which led us to completely go towards the file coincide.
00:19:00.514 - 00:19:18.044, Speaker A: And I guess as an attention to that, is it possible to kind of add some of these filecoin or live peer features onto existing offerings? So what's the difference between, say, Huda zero one or, you know, adding, you know, adding Filecoin to like Zoom?
00:19:19.104 - 00:19:52.564, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. So in order to add filecoin, we have done a very deep integration with Filecoin there on the infrastructure level itself. So it all boils down to the philosophy of how the web two and the web3 business model works. So the web two business model worked on the data collection. That means authentication is the bottleneck. Authentication is how the bread and butter of all the web two businesses work. So in order to integrate filecoin into your own offerings, you need to have an authentication which directly merges with Filecoin or file converter machine in a manner that means it makes it composable.
00:19:52.564 - 00:20:21.912, Speaker C: And that's where we are actually also a part of Filecoin virtual machine hackathon. So we are sponsoring that as well. People are building on top of us. They're using our SDKs, leveraging our SDK of Hudlo one and building any kind of, they building marketplaces, that means how you can store these recordings of audio and videos. They're doing a proper hudlow one kind of video recording. They've made their own custom frontends and then storing all those onto file con itself. Now this is possible because of how the authentication mechanism has been designed.
00:20:21.912 - 00:20:45.870, Speaker C: Now, if you're using a Google Oauth, it becomes very, very tricky to essentially create that kind of a composable stack between your stack and between something like Filecoin or something like live peer in between. So that's something where the SDK has become much more composable, where the main, I'll say, attack source is the philosophical thinking of how the authentication should work. So without data collection or with data collection, if you're doing a data collection, you won't be able to have a composable stack.
00:20:45.942 - 00:21:04.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I see, I see. So basically, the design for Huddle Zero one is just fundamentally different from a web two stack. You can't just take a web two streaming or video call platform and just slap some web3 features on it because it is, at the infrastructure level already decentralized.
00:21:04.734 - 00:21:05.374, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:21:05.414 - 00:21:25.364, Speaker A: Yes. Got it. And I'm curious because one of the most teased features for Filecoin is the FVM, basically creating this virtual machine where people can finally write applications on top of Filecoin and not just use file coin for storage, but do fancy things on top of it. So is that part of the roadmap for huddle as well?
00:21:26.104 - 00:22:22.480, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So right now it's been, I think, ten days since the kickoff of Fileco and virtual machine hackathon has happened, and Huddle Zero is also a part of it. So what I believe is that FVM will be so powerful because now with smart contracts, we have programmable storage as well, which gives you a two in one kind of a offering for any kind of dapper which wants to get built. So imagine you can have a programmable storage, and that's what we are seeing at people who are leveraging even our SDKs. They want to have, like they're building these, their own front end of audio and video, they're building their own web, three discords. And then they're leveraging FVM to store all these things in a programmable fashion, all the storage over file coins. So what we're seeing is a very high velocity of intellectual content, of asynchronous charts or the synchronous audio video getting stored over filecoin, leveraging the infrastructures of something like huddle one lifepeer and others.
00:22:22.480 - 00:22:36.124, Speaker C: So basically making it much more data, much more, I'll say, intellectually rich, which is getting stored over file coin. And this will happen at a very, very fast pace in the coming months.
00:22:37.304 - 00:22:58.454, Speaker A: And I think this is where it's really interesting to get your take as a builder because this is not commonly understood because a lot of people see filecoin as like a storage network, but now there's a programmable storage of programmable data. So what is the difference between say like programmable data post FVM and like non programmable data? And what type of difference does it make to you as a builder?
00:22:59.314 - 00:23:52.046, Speaker C: So now since you have a programmable proper storage now, you'll be able to now leverage all the kind of securities which were there on Ethereum. So whatever things you're building and now get that in a single page onto file coin itself. So you don't need to go anywhere, you don't need to do extra, additional efforts. And that mental model, that file con is just for storage, gets changed there because now all the apps, all the, all the builders now know that they can get everything here on FPM itself. So it's like you can build any kind of things if you have built anything on Ethereum. It's so easy for you to port because like just add storage there because now you see that, hey, it's so easy for me to port because you get everything because it's so much compatible now that you get everything which you wanted, but now you also don't need to depend on s three or glacier. And now you can just like smartly code into the, into your application that.
00:23:52.046 - 00:24:38.702, Speaker C: Where do you want the storage to happen? Which kind of miner you want to get it stored onto? This miner has a rating of let's suppose 4.8 versus 4.7. Do you want to get wanted to store there? What should be the application factor look like what amount of storage you want to do or how much for how much time you want to do that storage onto all these things you can program. Now that means you can just have a proper understanding of. If you talk to me about in next couple of years, your unit economics will become so much better for all these fundamental businesses because now you'll be paying so less, because now you exactly know how much you're paying for the storage because you know that you need to store this for let's suppose 367 days. You can just program that, hey, store, for instance, days replicated for a factor of three and then you're done. So you don't need to pay any additional costings.
00:24:38.702 - 00:24:41.862, Speaker C: And now you can control everything with the power of your code.
00:24:41.918 - 00:24:57.674, Speaker A: Yeah. So that was from the builder's perspective. So from the user's perspective. Now, what kind of features? Because given now that huddle is already live, you know, it always has these web3 integrations. So why does this still need programmable data? What new things can you do on huddle after FVM?
00:24:58.414 - 00:25:26.878, Speaker C: So now you can use huddle Owens, I'll say SDKs, and you can build all those things that you want to build. So huddle has two layers, as I mentioned, DAP and the infrastructure layer. So now what is possible for even us on the DAP layer is that people want to store their data. They store their data days, over days, months, over months and years, over years. And now they have a dashboard. Now you can go into dashboard and select that, hey, I want to see my data of March 21, 2021. So now you can do that very easily.
00:25:26.878 - 00:26:15.680, Speaker C: And it makes me so easy to store the data because now people have the power to how much time they want the data to get stored. And now I can design my pricing model in such a very interesting manner where I can give them a such lucrative costings on the storage layer, which is not possible fundamentally in the business model of web3, web two, that means Zoom doesn't give you that. They give you an offering of that. Hey, you know what? I give you additional 50 gb of storage and post that they charge you based on per gb costings. Now, this is something which I won't be doing now because I have this power of programmable storage now on the, on the tap layer and on the layer of infrastructure. Now, it makes me so easy for people who are building on top of me. They don't need to, like, come now, think about storing the data over AWS or over GCP or over s three and over glacier and stuff like that.
00:26:15.680 - 00:27:00.714, Speaker C: They have a one stop composable SDK, but they just, it's a no brainer for them. Audio, video, they can leverage 101 missing because I want to leverage huddle one. And then if they want to store all these asynchronous data and just make sure that, hey, it gets stored over this much amount of time, they can just do that in a single line of code itself. So that's the kind of leverages which you get at the end of the day, which decreases the, which makes your unit economics very, very healthy and your pricing much, much more competitive as compared to. So, for us on the infra layer, we can compete very easily with something like Agora, something like daily, something like all these other zooms SDK very, very easily because our costings will become so much competitive and so much better that we can slash 50% of costings as compared to the others which are out there.
00:27:01.854 - 00:27:49.514, Speaker A: I love that there is a actual commercial need to be building on web3 rails, because a lot of the companies we see, a lot of the projects out there are building web3 for ideological reasons. They think we got to be decentralized for the sake of being decentralized. But here there's a very clear cost saving Kate savings case that you made, which I think is really, really interesting. And another really interesting thing that I want to dive into is one of the thesis that I had was that applications will capture most of the mind share, so they should control most of the values, not the protocol layer. And I'm starting to think that this is starting to be validated because we see a lot of applications verticalize and build their own infrastructure. So can you talk us, talk to us a little bit about the decision to not just build huddle Zero one, the streaming and video call app, but also verticalized and built divergent, which is the communications protocol built under Huddle Zero one that you just mentioned.
00:27:50.254 - 00:28:39.188, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great point. Something which I've been pondering, Jason, over the last two years, and the design decisions of building product has happened very methodically on how do we go about it. So what we started seeing, Jason, was that once we built the infrastructure, we used WebRTC completely. We hadn't decentralized it yet. And we started seeing that once we are using all these crypto primitives of nfts, didifablica verify credentials, and all these protocols like live peer Filecoin, we started seeing that a lot of people are essentially coming on the platform, they're loving it for the sake of the. Because you have a very good product chop. So the first thing which we realized was that to build if you have very good product chops, because we come from a web two world, like from before 2020, I was product builder, so I've built a lot of products in my past.
00:28:39.188 - 00:29:07.144, Speaker C: Same goes with my team as well, and that too in a high velocity, indian based consumer market. So I understood that. What kind of, how do you solve the leaky funnel, the leaky bucket of from the top to the bottom funnel. So for that, you need to have very good product chops. And what we started seeing was that lot of users started coming, retention increased to around 40%. That means people were returning back again and again. And then what we started seeing was that, hey, anyway, we're capturing so much value on the app layer.
00:29:07.144 - 00:29:34.994, Speaker C: If we just build divergent here, we can just open up this infrastructure for other people to also build on top of it. So what happened was that infrastructure, which we have right now, we built the PM, we built an app on top of it first as well. That was a very good validation that infra should be opened up for others. And then we opened the infra for others. And then we started doing this. Hackathons, sponsoring hackathons in ETH, India, in FBM. And just in the last two months, that's where we opened the infrastructure.
00:29:34.994 - 00:30:14.876, Speaker C: We had around 67 projects were built on top of us. And what the good thing about this, Jason, was that since we already had built product first, developers started using our infrastructure, not because they just get grants, but because they knew that, hey, these guys are builders, they've actually built a product on top of it. It was a testament that the infra works. They are good, solid. They've done more than 1 minute of meetings. So we get a lot of, I'll say, consulting or a kind of officers where the builders come to us to talk about that. Hey, how do I build this front end rendering? How do I essentially go from a low fidelity experiment to a high fidelity experiment in terms of my design decisions and stuff like that? So I think this is working.
00:30:14.876 - 00:30:28.888, Speaker C: So we might reach a multiple PMF very fast, and that will lead to a much more demand on the infrastructure layer. So I think that's how the decision came into picture as I started seeing a move towards PMF on the on the tab layer itself.
00:30:29.036 - 00:30:57.464, Speaker A: Yeah, that is interesting to hear firsthand. And I love to pivot a little bit away from talking about the product infrastructure, to talk about the growth side, because one of the things you mentioned in the beginning of this interview was that there's almost a 1 million minutes streamed or used on huddle zero one. And I remember when we first chatted about five, six months ago, that number was a lot lower. So what happened driving those many minutes? And who are the people using is web3 version of streaming or video calls?
00:30:58.244 - 00:31:22.596, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. So the people who are using it is, are essentially creators. They are essentially these people who love to have these meetings, that token gated meetings, people who love to have, who do their office hours on a daily basis. And what interesting thing happened for us was we integrate with Cal.com. So Cal.com is a proper web like a proper calendly itself in open zones currently. And then we integrate something like meet with wallet.
00:31:22.596 - 00:32:03.194, Speaker C: So network effects started happening at a much more faster pace. So people who were you, who were adapted to using these scheduling infrastructures, a calendar scheduling infrastructures, that's where huddle also started getting integrated on. So now when people are sending links, because we are in link sharing business, so we share links, let's suppose 3000 links in a day basis. Zoom shares more than 10 million. So if we need to crack 10 million links, we need to have a scheduling infrastructure. So that's where we integrate with something like meet with Wallet, with Cal.com, and all the people who preferred privacy, people who preferred pseudonymity organizations, who preferred, who were NFTs Daos creators, who wanted to increase their distribution.
00:32:03.194 - 00:32:36.098, Speaker C: That means something like who wanted, who streamed on Twitch and wanted to stream on YouTube and onto their player in one click. That was not possible on Zoom. So they essentially started shifting on huddle one because not because it's a web3 product, but because you can have multiple plethora of distribution in one click, so you can get three distribution. So if you go on to huddle one right now, just click on tools, you'll be able to live stream in one click onto three places. You cannot do that anywhere else. So these things led to people coming on us using the platform and loving the overall experience. So that led to the jump in the number of minutes of meeting.
00:32:36.098 - 00:33:08.402, Speaker C: So a couple of l one s, they've started using Hudlo one for their daily seminars, daily webinars, or all their calls, because not because we have web3 product, but because they were able to stream onto twitch or onto YouTube in one click itself. So that's how the engagement started. That led to even a very good, I'll say, inbound interest for the SDKs. So I'll say that our front end product, which is the DAP layer, is leading to a lot of inbound leads for the SDKs as well. So that's creating a very good, I'll say, proper inward network effects and inbound lead cycle for us.
00:33:08.458 - 00:33:47.634, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. So I think that that's a really precious kind of lesson for founders out there that are building web3 web two products and trying to bring them to a larger audience. And I think that the question that a lot of people will have when they build these type of products is obviously you want to get to the first, say, 100,000 crypto natives first, but then the goal is always to bring it to the next 200 or 300 million mass audiences. So how will your growth strategy change when it evolves beyond targeting the Masaris of the world or the crypto natives of the world into targeting just mom and pop zoom users?
00:33:48.214 - 00:34:08.742, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah, I think that's a very, very good question. And something which, again, we have been thinking deeply onto it. So I'll just give a pass of huddle one. Huddle one started off, though, we had. So we integrated file coin way back in 2020 when file cone was coming in itself, that time retrieval is something where retrieval was just coming into the picture. But we had done that.
00:34:08.742 - 00:34:53.698, Speaker C: And what we saw as a very good market for us was education. So Hudlo one started off with a product, product focused, a web3 based product, but focused only on the education market. Why? Because our performance was better, our audio video quality was better, our latency was better, and our storage was much, much more cheaper. And that's where we got into the world of talking to people like Unacademy by juice and all these other big edtech organizations in India. So we started off with a market of edtech first, not crypto native audiences, and we wanted to do the sales cycle here, do these things. So what we understood was that it's a very, very huge market. The next market, like education, is really, really huge for something like Hudlo one, leveraging the power of filecoin on the infrastructure, on the recording layer.
00:34:53.698 - 00:35:37.860, Speaker C: So the next target of Hudlo one is to move towards capturing and solving that. The main problem are two things only that number one is the performance issues, because people or students connect from all over the world. So the connections are not great, even though something like Starlink will take years to have a complete distribution. Until that time, use will not have a less late, have bad latency. And you need to record all those calls because of maybe kappa laws in us, which requires something like if your children below 13 years of age, and to record those calls and stuff like that, and something like intellectual property of the university, that itself. So second is your costings. So those two are very important verticals, which will solve for a huge market like education.
00:35:37.860 - 00:36:21.268, Speaker C: The third market we'll be capturing is going after healthcare. So something like HIPAA compliance in us is very known for that means patient doctor confidentiality. So when you're talking to a doctor, you need to have a confidentiality when you're doing a. The market is huge for these online consultations, and that's where you get something like filecoin on the recording aspect, we're making it much more secure and something like huddle zero one on the encryption layer. That means it's end to end encrypted and it's getting stored over filecoin, which is, again, cheaper and again, cryptographically encrypted. So I think these three verticals where I'm seeing after crypto natives education and healthcare will be humongous markets for something like a composable stack of huddle one filecoin as well as livepeer.
00:36:21.316 - 00:36:33.344, Speaker A: Yeah, got it. That's really helpful. And I'm really excited to see products like this take off. So for people who want to, you know, actually check out huddle zero one, what are the best ways for them to do this today?
00:36:34.284 - 00:36:55.518, Speaker C: Yeah, so if you want to check out Hudlo one, it's Hudlow one.com. That's where we are live. The philosophy of the thinking behind zero one is we wanted to take o one, because when we do a huddle, let's suppose when we meet, we huddle in a, in a proper group. But zero one is binary. That means it's zeros and ones. And since you are meeting in an online world, zeros and ones. So that's why Hudlo one name came into picture.
00:36:55.518 - 00:37:11.794, Speaker C: So you just type on Hudlow one.com and you'll be able to find us. I'm also active on Twitter a lot, so my handle is ranjan 3118. So happy to answer any questions, happy to guide, happy to chat, happy to discuss philosophies on how web3 should move. And yeah, that's about me.

Again, I think this type of application is exactly the type of stuff that we need to have to kind of break out of the crypto echo chamber. So I wish you all the success and thanks for coming on.
00:37:28.174 - 00:37:29.990, Speaker C: Thanks, Jason. Thanks for having me.
