00:00:01.160 - 00:00:38.810, Speaker A: Welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the show for crypto natives. Every week we do short but in depth conversations with the most important builders and investors in crypto so you can filter through what's noise and stay ahead of the markets. I'm your host, Jason Choi. Nothing on this show should be construed as financial advice, and my guests, myself, and my employer may hold positions and assets discussed on the show. Today's episode is brought to you by perpetual protocol, Figment, and Aave. Recently the largest decentralized exchange in all of DeFi, Uniswap launched their version three. Now, version three is not just a small update to the existing automated market maker, which all of us DeFi users use.
00:00:38.810 - 00:01:38.024, Speaker A: It is a complete revamp on the model and brings in a lot of questions about different trade offs when it comes to capital efficiency, as well as costs and prices for users, liquidity providers, and other projects that rely on uniswap. Now this is one of the more nuanced topic lately, and to be honest, one of the most exciting developments in Defi lately. And initially I wanted to reach out to the Uniswap team to get their thoughts on this, but I thought it might be more interesting to get the objective thoughts of a power user of Defi, who also happened to be a market maker or an Algo trader in a previous life, and also a current founder in DeFi that works with a lot of decentralized exchanges. And I'm really excited to bring on Will Sheehan, who, who has written a lot of exciting things about Defi, as well as built his own Defi prime broker, which we'll talk about later. We're also touching a few other things, including Will's thesis for Defi, as well as what he's building at Parsec Finance, which I personally am a big fan of. So if you want to hear more about that, make sure you stay till the very end.
00:01:39.044 - 00:01:48.028, Speaker B: Well, Will, I follow your writing and work for a while now, so I've always wanted to bring you on the show. So really, honestly stoked to have you on today. So welcome to the show.
00:01:48.196 - 00:01:49.708, Speaker C: Hey, thanks, Jason. Thanks for having me.
00:01:49.756 - 00:02:07.148, Speaker B: Absolutely. Now, it's been a pretty crazy time in crypto, and we just had Coinbase go public last night, my time and morning yours at 100 billion valuation yesterday. So before we get started, I'm really curious. Do you remember when was the first time you used Coinbase and what made you sign up for it?
00:02:07.316 - 00:02:34.964, Speaker C: Yeah, this is actually my bitcoin or crypto origin story involved Coinbase I had heard about it from a friend who was buying fake ids with it back in the day when I was in college. And I learned about it. I wasn't really into finance at the time. I learned about it and went on Coinbase and bought one. I then sold it at 1000. So that was one of the worst trades I've ever made.
00:02:36.544 - 00:02:39.200, Speaker B: Sure this is back in what, 2013.
00:02:39.272 - 00:02:41.364, Speaker C: Ish, or I think it was like 2015.
00:02:42.424 - 00:02:48.924, Speaker B: Got it. And I guess what made you decide to come back to crypto more seriously after that?
00:02:49.504 - 00:04:08.078, Speaker C: Yeah, so after that I had kind of a swirling set of interests around. You know, I was a physics student, so physics and math, but specifically on the applied side. So I kind of got into quantitative trading and quantitative finance, as well as just having an engineering background and doing web development, different software projects. And I kind of didn't really want to go into the finance like tradfi world and didn't also find a standard SaaS tech job that interesting. And so I kind of resembled upon crypto, specifically ethereum, as I kind of was trying to figure out what to do with my life. And Ethereum took it like 100 x for me versus bitcoin, just because as a technical person and as someone who is interested in derivatives and financial products, it just felt so much more expansive to me. And I think as someone who's worked with a lot of different APIs on web two, the whole prospect of an open API and open financial API specifically was super compelling.
00:04:08.078 - 00:04:14.714, Speaker C: And I basically went down the rabbit hole in spring of 2017 and haven't really thought about anything else since.
00:04:15.654 - 00:04:26.256, Speaker B: That's pretty awesome. You have some algo trading background as well, and now you're working on something called Parsec finance. So can you give our listeners a taste of what parsec is and kind of, how did you decide to start that?
00:04:26.430 - 00:05:19.150, Speaker C: Yeah, so my background is in trading and, you know, trading engineering. I was, you know, have been involved in Defi since like, you know, maker single collateral die and some of the early, early products. And, you know, as I was trading all these different, different products on Ethereum, I didn't really have like a cohesive interface to kind of understand just my portfolio as well as prices and what's going on, how these different financial products are interacting with each other on one screen. And so you can think of it as an interactive brokers or Bloomberg like interface, but for Defi and all the complexities that come with that, yeah, definitely.
00:05:19.182 - 00:06:07.282, Speaker B: And I'm a huge fan of the product as well. I checked it out in the very early days and kind of having one, one platform to use so many different Defi applications and different exchanges is a pretty amazing experience. And I'm sure we'll get to that when we talk about your defi kind of prime brokerage thesis as well. But will, there's so many things I want to cover with you, because you've written a lot of very thoughtful pieces. And I always thought it's very, very illustrative to kind of learn from people with that traditional algo trading background who are also using defi products and are very defi native. And I would love to kind of just start the conversation with Uniswap, which you've written about a few times before. And you were one of the first people that voiced a very well informed opinion on Uniswap v three, which was one of the bigger developments in the industry and defi.
00:06:07.282 - 00:06:26.144, Speaker B: So for some context for our listeners, Uniswap now generates, I think, about a billion of dollars, billion worth of volume almost daily, and at times it even surpassed that of Coinbase. So before we dive into v three, can you help us understand briefly of what v three is and how it compares to v two?
00:06:26.924 - 00:07:19.364, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think you can kind of think about v three as a superset of v two. So, basically, v two is this liquidity strategy, where you spread your assets across the entire range of prices. So from zero to infinity. So you'll keep buying the token as it goes to zero, or as it, or sell it as it goes to infinity. But what v three does is it kind of splits this up into a set of bins, and you can actually discreetly apply your liquidity within those bins, or ranges across multiple bins. And I think the best way to think about v three is kind of a mashup of an order book and uniswap v two or v one, which is just this very simple liquidity strategy. But I think it's also important to note that it's not an order book either.
00:07:19.364 - 00:07:31.164, Speaker C: They haven't gone all the way in the direction of being an order book. It's really an attempt to harmonize the benefits of both trading systems.
00:07:32.384 - 00:08:05.514, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, that's a point that I wanted to hone in on, because in the article that you wrote about v three, you did mention that it's kind of like an order book, but not really. So can you help us maybe understand what are the exact differences between a traditional order book or something like a coinbase, or even like a serum, which we've had on the show before, and something like an amm, which is what uniswap v one and v two were. So what are the key differences between. How does v three harmonize the both? And what are the key differences between a traditional order book and v three today?
00:08:05.894 - 00:09:10.326, Speaker C: Yeah, so the key difference is between just a standard amm, like a uniswap b two, and an order book is with an order book, you have these discrete price levels that you can put in individual orders on. But with v three, you can actually place orders across a range, and that is only one order. So if you back up a second with v three, you can actually construct an order book. If you just said that LP's can just add liquidity in each of these bins, but actually, the ability to apply liquidity across a range is something that you can't do in an order book. You couldn't go and say, okay, I want to have an order out at all times from $90 to 110 on some asset. It doesn't actually. You can't actually do that because the order book won't let you, and your orders will keep getting filled on both sides, and you'll have to keep doing this, this maintenance if you actually want to run, you know, this the simple meaner version strategy that kind of a lot of LP's are trying to run.
00:09:10.326 - 00:10:12.462, Speaker C: And I kind of walked through this in the article, but basically, the reason that I think this is important is that it allows for the more passive type of LP's to participate in a way that they don't get operationally disadvantaged by higher speed and better equipped traders. So that's one big difference, is these spread orders. The other difference that's a little bit more subtle is that with standard order books, when an order is sweeping into the book, it'll take out the orders within one price level. First in, first out. So if you get your order in first, that one will be filled as the taker comes in. But with Uniswap, this actually goes across all of the liquidity in that bin pro rata. This has some interesting implications, but the main one is that there are going to be less games around getting placement in a certain price level.
00:10:12.462 - 00:10:26.274, Speaker C: And so this, in theory, will reduce the amount of transactions required to participate in these liquidity pools, which is obviously important given the computational restraints of public blockchains.
00:10:27.774 - 00:10:35.674, Speaker B: And are there any trade offs that come with this increased flexibility for LP's? Would you be increasing things like impermanent loss for LP's?
00:10:36.574 - 00:11:19.714, Speaker C: Yeah, so I made a joke about this twitter about when you're placing a single limit order, you're actually taking the maximum impermanent loss because by definition you are selling your asset immediately for the other asset. And so if the asset then keeps going up, you've taken on in theory and permanent loss. So this concept kind of breaks down as you go more towards an order book. And so I think it's less important in v three. But if you take that definition of Il then it does increase it if you tighten your your liquidity. But I don't think that's a bad thing. Traders want to take more risk.
00:11:19.714 - 00:11:32.318, Speaker C: The ability to modulate your risk is good, and I don't think that we should be scared of the fact that basically v three allows you to leverage your risk exposure across a curve.
00:11:32.446 - 00:12:25.126, Speaker A: Now before we continue, I'd like to take a moment to share some exciting companies that made this podcast possible. I'd like to talk about our sponsor, perpetual protocol. If you are worried about leaving your funds on an exchange that may be hacked, but you are also tired of paying for hundreds of dollars in gas fees in defi, you should check out perpetual protocol because they have built a fully on chain exchange on Ethereum and Xdai that charges extremely low gas fees for trading and they allow up to ten x leverage. Now if youre paranoid about smart contract exploits, dont worry because perpetual has also obtained protocol level insurance via nexus mutual and unslashed finance to provide automatic coverage for for all traders on perp dot exchange. Now today for users outside the US, if you have an ethereum address, you can already start using perp exchange with no signups. So go to perp exchange Blockcrunch to check it out. That's perp exchange blockcrunch.
00:12:25.126 - 00:13:10.384, Speaker A: I'm also proud to call Figment a sponsor of the show. If you're part of any crypto project or you want to launch your own crypto project, you definitely need to check out Datahub. Datahub is Figments newest product and they are the fastest way for developers to launch and scale web3 applications. You can access standard network rpcs, submit transactions, and build even faster with Datahubs unique enhanced APIs. And thats all because under the hood, Datahub is powered by figments best in class blockchain infrastructure and is already offered on networks like Cosmos, Avalanche, near Sello and a lot more.

00:13:10.384 - 00:13:55.976, Speaker A: So head on over to Datahub Figment IO or click the link in the show notes to learn more. One of my absolute favorite products in crypto is Aave. Aave is a non custodial liquidity protocol, meaning you can earn interest on your crypto or borrow crypto assets without trusting any centralized counterparty to hold your funds. I personally have been using Aave for a long time to earn up to 12% of my USD holdings like USDC USDT or even decentralized stablecoins like Dai or exchange stablecoins like Binance USD, which totally blows my bank out the water. And if you're new to crypto and worried about security, Aave has been audited by security firms 13 times in 2020 alone and once already this year, which they disclosed fully. So I'm really excited to have a product that I love as a sponsor. So go on over to aave.com
00:13:55.976 - 00:14:00.634, Speaker A: and aave.com to check out which of the assets you'd like to borrow and lend today.
00:14:01.294 - 00:14:43.264, Speaker B: To me, one of the core innovations of Uniswap is not just enabling people to trade, but democratizing market making, right? So guys like me, I'm not an algo trader or active market maker. I can just park my assets passively in a uniswap pool, kind of 50% to 50% kind of ETH and whatever asset I want to provide liquidity for and instantly become a liquidity provider and start earning trading fees. Now, what you mentioned about v three sounds like it allows for more bespoke and real time and complex LP strategies. And I'm curious whether you think that opens up the arena to professional market makers to coming into Uniswap v three at the expense of maybe retail guys or everyday users.
00:14:43.964 - 00:15:35.838, Speaker C: Yeah, I think this is the most important question probably around v three. I think the answer is definitely yes. It does open up the opportunity for traders with more refined opinions and specific goals to enter the game. And that does remove fees from LP's in theory. But I think actually the concept of having an amm that is only passive LP's is a little bit flawed. And you can even see this in the existing market because if you route through, you know, one inch or, or zero X API, what they'll do is they'll ping market make private market makers and see if they want to take the order, you know, versus, versus routing it to uniswap. And so this is actually parasitic to the LP's already.
00:15:35.838 - 00:16:27.654, Speaker C: And additionally, the LP's don't get any of that order if it's an advantageous order. And so I think what's interesting here is that V three is actually combining, in theory, combining those two parties into the same system and will apply fees to those pro rata instead of the MM being able to come in and opportunistically snipe the good order flow. And so I think that's what goes back to the pro rata mix across a liquidity level. And so I think that the routing and aggregation piece of this becomes really important. And actually said in our call that I think that Uniswap should give out uni for routing directly because routing is actually really important in a system like this that is really trying to be the main liquidity venue.
00:16:30.274 - 00:16:58.344, Speaker B: For me as a kind of non professional algo trader. Do I have to actively manage my ticks or just to give listeners some context, these ticks are basically the different price tiers within the V three design. So do I have to be actively managing my liquidity and kind of moving them between different ticks in order to compete with the professional market makers? Or do you think there's still a space for passive LP strategies under V three?
00:16:58.684 - 00:17:42.504, Speaker C: I think there will be space for passive LP strategies. I think that the passive LP strategies will have to get a little bit smarter. They'll have to do things around volatility ranges and trying to stay a little bit tighter and increasing the risk to LP's a bit to get enough fees to make it worthwhile. But I think they'll definitely be able to compete, because the other important thing is that with the efficiency that comes with this new AMM will come more volume and some more fees, and then more volume and more fees, and it becomes a self, you know, a positive feedback loop that will really help LP's. Even if you're getting a very low percentage of fees, it'll be meaningful at high volume.
00:17:44.884 - 00:18:14.294, Speaker B: This also reminds me of a critique that some listeners had for a project like Bancor, which uses a slightly more complex model relative to a vanilla amm, which is that gas costs will be incredibly high. So given that, say, I put in an order into Uniswap as a trader, and my order crosses multiple ticks, so I would have to be hopping between multiple ticks. Does that incur a lot more gas cost than something like V two, which is much simpler?
00:18:15.394 - 00:18:46.714, Speaker C: It is slightly more gas. My understanding is that's about 15k gas per tick that you cross. Depends on the pair a little bit. How many ticks you'll cross. Usually only large orders will will be doing that meaningfully, but it's also a fairly low gas amount. I don't think that the gas effects will be that different for traders. I think for LP's, if you're managing an LP position, they'll obviously be substantial, but that comes with the territory of being more active.
00:18:48.214 - 00:19:02.084, Speaker B: Got it. On that note, what do you think are the biggest trade offs with Uniswap V three, you get all of this efficiency, all this capital efficiency, which hopefully generates more volumes. But what are the biggest things that it might have given up in that process?
00:19:02.944 - 00:19:57.714, Speaker C: I think the big one is simplicity. I think that never underestimate the power of a simple system in Defi. I think the type of retail traders that are often participating want simple systems that they can set and forget it. I think you see this with Uniswap and things like yearn. Simple systems, even if they're less efficient, often win because people don't have to understand them, they don't have to read a white paper to use them. And I think that's the big risk here, is that the contracts are probably five to ten times more complicated and integrations won't be as fast. It's not as seamless to spin up a yield farm that where you a pool, two where you put in LP tokens and give the token out to LP's.
00:19:57.714 - 00:20:34.854, Speaker C: And so things like that are less seamless. And I think it's a lot of uniswap volume is attributable to that simplicity. So I think that's the big risk in my mind. And the other risk is just that even though they're trying to harmonize active LP's and passive LP's, private market makers still trying snipe order flow from aggregators? And I think that's something that will probably play out over a longer timeframe, but I think that's a risk.
00:20:37.034 - 00:21:16.054, Speaker B: What I thought was really, really interesting is that before the launch of V three, you wrote this post called Citadel Sharp is Uniswap's opportunity. And in it you mentioned that instead of making more and more like order books by giving the makers or the liquidity providers optionality, they should lead into the strength and severely constrain the makers. So it sounds like Uniswap v three might actually be leaning away from that and giving makers a lot more optionality at the expense of simplicity, as you just said. Do you think that kind of compromises on Uniswap's original vision? And how has your view on Uniswap changed ever since they announced v three?
00:21:16.724 - 00:22:57.752, Speaker C: Yeah, I think v three is the first thing that has really made me challenge that thesis. I think it sounds really good to say that basically passive LP's can absorb basically the idea there is that passive LP's can accept a return profile that is a lot lower return than a sophisticated market maker like citadel in traditional markets, just because they aren't doing any maintenance and they don't have LP's, they don't have, they're not running funds, they're just trying to make some yield on their assets. And there are even ways that Uniswap V two is not perfectly conducive for passive LP ing. There are ways that LP's can kind of sandwich trades and pull out their liquidity and optimistically add it back in at certain moments. So there are ways you could constrain even more by adding withdrawal windows and things like that. But I think the issue that I've kind of alluded to already with that thesis is really aggregation and aggregators will try and get the best price possible for traders, and aggregators are going to continue to make deals with market makers who want that flow similar to what Robinhood's doing and has been doing with payment for order flow. It's pretty similar, and I don't really see a world where that doesn't exist.
00:22:57.752 - 00:23:02.084, Speaker C: And I think that is a challenge for more passive.
00:23:04.144 - 00:23:17.244, Speaker B: So you're saying that currently, if I'm using one inch, some of my orders, so one inch would actually go to private market makers first to get a quote before trying to fill on uniswap. And you think that would also still happen in v three or you think that would be lesser in v three?
00:23:19.144 - 00:23:51.864, Speaker C: I think the hope for Uniswap would be that it's lesser. And yeah, it does happen. It primarily happens on kind of more liquid pairs like ETH and stuff like that. And maybe that's what happens. Maybe just more liquid pairs have that kind of amm flow or, sorry, private market maker flow, and the longer tail assets continue to flourish on amms. But I think in an ideal world, from Uniswap's perspective, they would prefer that it goes all directly to the main capital pool.
00:23:52.924 - 00:24:23.544, Speaker B: I always thought that is such a underexplored area in Defi, because when you talk about market makers in crypto, people immediately think of folks like Amber or Alameda, like the large desks that are market making on centralized exchanges. But when you speak to these guys, they usually say they actually don't do any type of market making on DeFi because the volumes are so low and the gas are so high or whatever. So who are these market makers in Defi? Are these individuals or like smaller desks? And how can people find out more about these guys?
00:24:24.164 - 00:25:05.294, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean they're, they're, there are some like more established people that are doing this. You know it's also, it's completely permissionless still. You know, a lot, a lot of them use the Xerox RFQ system which provides really good prices from some from their own desk and some from others. And you know from the aggregator's perspective they're giving a better price. And from the trader's perspective you know, there's no reason not to do it. And I think the reality is that traders don't care where their volume is routing through unless there's some sort of token yield that you get from doing that.
00:25:07.194 - 00:25:56.610, Speaker B: Definitely. And another trade off that I think we should touch on is that for Uniswap V two, obviously a lot of the, well all of the LP positions will be tokenized in an LP token. So the token is fungible. So just to give listeners an example, if I provide into say an ETH USDC pool, I provide 50% ETH and 50% USDC pool. USDC into a uniswap pool, I basically get a LP token in return that is redeemable for my share of that pool. And what a lot of projects have done back in defi summer is use this LP token as a almost proof that a user has provided liquidity for a specific coin and they reward holders of that LP token with their own incentives. So there are a lot of things that you can play around with with these LP tokens.
00:25:56.610 - 00:26:04.374, Speaker B: Now it sounds like in v three this might change and become less fungible. So can you talk about that? And I'm curious what you think about that.
00:26:05.154 - 00:27:11.754, Speaker C: Yeah, so I do think there's a big change. What I expect to see happen here is that kind of these meta systems like something like yearn or x token, that they create their own token wrappers of their positions and their position vaults to try and get some of that fungibility back. On the LP side it is substantially more complicated. But I think that's the hope is that some service providers come up that that will allow users to have an actual token that then they can maybe draw a stable coin against and things like that, because that's obviously a huge use case. And most of what's happening with uniswap b two there's this new wave of lending protocols taking LP tokens as collateral. And I think that's something that we definitely want to see happen with v three as well, but it will definitely require some infrastructure.
00:27:13.214 - 00:27:18.114, Speaker B: Yeah. And just to clarify, what exactly is the change in v three when it comes to LP tokens?
00:27:19.374 - 00:28:04.614, Speaker C: Yeah, so, I mean, if you think about it, you can't just have one token that's LPs, because you can have all these different positions and every different position has kind of a different time that they entered the pool and, you know, is mapped to a different account address. And so these are all individual positions, kind of similar to how you'd have a futures position that's just yours. You know, you can't then go and like trade your futures position. You could, but it would have to be like peer to peer. And so it's a similar, similar thing happening here. And basically, there's no way to do this individual binned concentrated liquidity without breaking that fungibility of the LP token.
00:28:06.194 - 00:28:42.932, Speaker B: Definitely. Now, I think we've covered a lot of things related to v three in terms of the capital, efficiency and gain, and in terms of the involvement of other participants who may not be as involved with this weap today. So professional market makers, and we also talk about some of the trade offs. So things like fungibility regarding the lp tokens potentially increase gas costs and maybe retail guys will lose out to more sophisticated LP's. So some of the trade offs there. But you wrote this post that I think synthesizes a lot of your views here. So I'd like to kind of wrap up this part of our conversation by touching on that post.
00:28:42.932 - 00:29:03.604, Speaker B: And you mentioned that in that post that you think Uniswap v three is the Dex to rule them all. So I'm very curious where that thesis came from and whether it's, first of all, kind of how much conviction you have around that thesis. And second of all, do you see any space for other AmM competitors? Should uniswap v three really take off?
00:29:04.184 - 00:30:13.444, Speaker C: Yeah, so I mean, to be clear, the title there is really, I think, meant to symbolize what the Uniswap team is attempting here, personal thesis. So, yeah, I'm not going to say with 100% question. That is correct. Going to win. I do think there's a non trivial chance that it could get greater than, call it 75% of Dex liquidity and Dex volume. But yeah, I think my main hesitations on applying a higher probability would be around basically the execution risk on whatever platforms it's deployed on, as well as just the ultimate question of limit order book versus amms. And is there anything there? I tend to think that there is, and that this is an emerging effect of trading on public blockchains that are resource constrained.
00:30:13.444 - 00:31:01.074, Speaker C: Regardless of whatever high speed chain that finance ends up happening on, there are going to be resource constraints to that because it's a distributed network. And so there are advantages to mms on that front. But I think there's also a chance that limit order books went out, so I definitely wouldn't apply a super high probability, but it's substantial and I think it's an incredibly ambitious project from a team that was really already leading. And so, yeah, I mean, I think it's just, it's cool to see teams like that that already have a $30 billion protocol then going out and trying to completely disrupt themselves.
00:31:02.374 - 00:31:18.064, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great point. And I think that also brings us to a thesis that you had that I'm very interested to discuss, which is this thesis around DeFi prime brokerages. And before we dive into that, maybe you could explain what that means and where the thesis came from.
00:31:18.724 - 00:33:22.384, Speaker C: Yeah, so this is something I wrote last summer. And basically the origin of me thinking about this topic was as DeFi protocols kind of start to start to expand and start to solidify in the ecosystem. Protocols like synthetix and Aave and compound and maker and all these, all these different lending and kind of credit protocols. I think the obvious question is where do they go next? And do they just build services on top that kind of end up becoming something like a prime brokerage where it's this full service, basically account where you can get whatever risk you want. And that system kind of hedges itself out for you. And this is kind of in tradfi, what some of the big banks and dealers do, and they're super powerful because they let you take on really concentrated risk and access to really bespoke derivatives. And I was kind of thinking about what who ends up being that for DeFi? And does this vertical integration on the protocol level make sense? The conclusion I came to was that I think ideally it's not vertically integrated, and you have horizontal services that specialize in lending and options, clearing interest rate swaps, and you have all these different interoperable protocols that then get kind of aggregated by basically risk bearing entities that they kind of become the Defi prime broker, where they aren't actually the protocols, but they set up basically risk parameters around letting users access these protocols.
00:33:22.384 - 00:33:54.634, Speaker C: And ideally there are multiple of these because I think I worry with the vertical integration is that then you kind of reinvent traditional finance because there's all this stacked risk, as you can see with Archegos last week. I think it's really important to stay away from that. And I also think there are benefits to, huge benefits to protocols, really honing their craft and really figuring out how to do one thing really perfectly well.
00:33:56.374 - 00:34:57.703, Speaker B: That's such an interesting point because I mean, the first wave of diva is really characterized by projects that do one thing very, very well. So Aave, just as lending maker, just as, I guess, lending and the stablecoin and then synthetix only does derivatives trading and they really rely on composability with other projects to really grow their user base. Now, at the same time, I think around the time that your blog post came out, we started seeing projects that are really playing into this vertical integration thesis. So one of the projects, Alpha Finance, they did a levered yield farming product and they're building a perpetual swap trading product and then an options product. And then for one inch I think they're considering building a lending product besides the aggregator. And obviously they built their own amm as well. So I guess, where do you see, why do you think projects are starting to think about this? Are they trying to compete for more collateral and figure that they need to offer more products to do that? Or is that just a natural progression for where all projects are headed?
00:34:58.083 - 00:36:02.924, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think it's a natural progression of where things are in the ecosystem right now. There are a lot of really competent teams that are kind of pushing the envelope, adding new functionality. I think that's probably a medium term thing. I think long term though, with these systems, they're going to basically have really stiff competition on the capital, efficiency and fee levels. And I think that basically it's going to be very hard to have one of these systems have one of these systems win in this permissionless environment where projects like dashboards like Parsec and Zapper and stuff, they can choose whatever is best to work with and to let users interact with. Really, it's going to take a lot to figure out how to do any one of these financial products. I think we've seen teams execute on lending and spot trading to a certain extent, but that's really it.
00:36:02.924 - 00:36:37.404, Speaker C: And we haven't actually seen a successful DeFi options protocol. We haven't seen a successful DeFi futures protocol quite yet. Maybe soon on that one. These are really hard things to do on open APIs and I think it's going to require teams really going deep on one financial product. But I think it also makes sense that, that they're spraying around a little bit and seeing what works. And I think I could totally be wrong here as well.
00:36:39.264 - 00:37:27.344, Speaker B: Yeah. And one thing that I think ties us back to our previous discussion on uniswap v three is that right now, my simplistic way of thinking about this deFi prime privilege thesis is that all these projects are competing for collateral. They're trying to lock up as much collateral as possible, because once you have user funds, you can then re hypothecate them, maybe by using lp tokens or whatever, into other use cases, you can maybe put them as margin for perpetual. Maybe you can even put them in an insurance fund. Now, if Uniswap V three's model is the future of Amms, their model will inherently be more capital efficient than current Amms, so they will require less collateral. Do you think in the early days that will actually put Uniswap at a disadvantage? Should they go after this defi prime brokerage thesis because they may end up owning less collateral than they could have?
00:37:27.884 - 00:38:40.154, Speaker C: Yeah, I think probably in the existing, existing market, with the existing set of market participants, TVL is definitely something that people care about. But I think long term, really what you want as a protocol or as a financial product is you want to allow users and traders to take the exact amount of risk they want in the most efficient way possible, without any gotchas. And that really is not conducive to pumping your TVL. And so I think teams will have to just deal with that fact ultimately, that TVL, I mean, it depends a little bit on how you, on the financial product, for sure, but that's not really the goal. You want to create the best possible thing for users to trade or use. And really, it's kind of ironic because some high TVL projects are really capital inefficient, and that's why their TVL is really high. And that's kind of the inverse of the actual feedback loop you want.
00:38:42.104 - 00:38:55.924, Speaker B: That's really interesting. And I thought this is a great way to pivot into talking about Parsec as well. I know you touched briefly on what Parsec is, but can you illustrate to us how did you decide to start parsec and what can users do on it today?
00:38:56.624 - 00:40:19.044, Speaker C: Yeah, so like I said, I was kind of trading around my own account on DeFi a while ago, and it really started as building it for myself, and it was something that I really wanted as a way of, as anyone knows, that's in Defi. You kind of have 35, 40 tabs open at any given time, kind of traversing what's going on. And really the goal is to try and remove as many of those tabs as possible so that you can do as much on one screen as possible in a super customizable interface that is built to scale with Defi. As Defi gets, you know, crazier and more complex. And as we ultimately, you know, eclipse all the, all the, you know, crazy financial products that traditional finance has and go beyond. And I think, you know, really what you can do with it today is you can get really in depth analytics on spot trading and spot lending, as well as some of the early DeFi derivatives protocols, as well as chain data, contract data, and all in one super customizable screen. And so it's primarily, you know, an analytics platform as well as a trading platform.
00:40:19.044 - 00:40:40.004, Speaker C: And I think over time there will be more functionality on the actual execution side. You know, you'll be able to do things like lending and some of these like more prime brokerage type things, but really we're starting out primarily with analytics and kind of keeping up with the space as it grows.
00:40:41.344 - 00:40:48.124, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And since I guess you could, would you consider parsec as an aggregator of sorts as well?
00:40:48.744 - 00:41:38.564, Speaker C: Yeah, I definitely would. It's really about captivating a certain type of user, which is kind of a more in the trenches prosumer user that's really trading their funds around and really wants to know what's going on. It's really a way of, I think the best way to think about the product is it's like kind of the beating heart of Defi. It's really just a way to see what is going on. It's incredibly hard to know what's going on in Defi. There's no kind of like, good place to do that, and I think, per se, has come a long way in doing that already. And you can kind of see market data streaming in live and try to update the mosaic with the market in your mind as you try and participate.
00:41:39.824 - 00:41:54.824, Speaker B: Yeah, and there's definitely a little bit of aggregation theory going on here. So I'm curious whether you think there will be maybe one or two massive prime brokerages or when Defi reaches maturity. Are you going to see a lot of parsecs that are specializing in different areas of Defi?
00:41:55.364 - 00:42:38.640, Speaker C: I think that there are going to be lots of, I shouldn't say lots. I think there are probably going to be ten to 20, really high quality front ends. I'm obviously partial to this theory of how everything plays out. I think that protocols don't have the user, they have the user's funds, but they don't actually have the user. And frontends have a connection with the user base, their user base that protocols don't really have on the same level. Some of the early protocols certainly do, but I think over time protocols are just going to launch and they're not even going to have a front end. They're just going to integrate with Parsec and the other ten really good front ends.
00:42:38.640 - 00:43:21.184, Speaker C: They are customized for certain types of users. We have more pro traders and then you have interfaces like Zapper which are kind of more retail focused and give you a really good rundown of your portfolio. And we're even seeing this like liquidity launch last week and they don't even have a front end and I don't really think that's a bad choice. It might be a little bit early, but over time, to my point, earlier teams are really going to optimize how good the financial product is and then let other teams like us handle. How are we going to get data on this protocol? How are we going to let people use it, how are we going to show their portfolio and things like that?
00:43:22.844 - 00:44:00.906, Speaker B: Yeah, that's definitely an exciting mission. And I do think a lot of focus in this space is given to protocols but not enough to the aggregators in the front end level, which is the level that owns the users. So I'm really, really excited to see how this plays out. Well, will, it's been such a pleasure to bring you on. I know we went through a lot of different things, you know, uniswap v three DeFi prime brokerages, Parsec. And I know you're working on a lot of things and honestly your block is one of the best that I followed and I think it's so undershared. So for people who want to follow your writing and follow your work in general and also check out Parsec, can you give us a few areas, a few resources that they can tap into?
00:44:01.090 - 00:44:23.014, Speaker C: Yeah, so the actual site is app Parsec finance if you want to look at the research, it's on research Parsec finance if you want to follow us. Twitter is the best place. The Twitter handle is Parsec finance and my Twitter is wilberforce. At the end you can get the straight Wilbur force handle.
00:44:23.714 - 00:44:28.986, Speaker B: Awesome. I will include that in the show notes below. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show. Wilt. It's just been a pleasure.
00:44:29.090 - 00:44:29.714, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, Jason.
