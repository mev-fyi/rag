00:00:35.392 - 00:01:07.056, Speaker B: Hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, at the core of this Defi 2.0, the term that's coined by many in crypto to describe a new wave of Defi protocols specializing in more complex and more unique mechanism designs, is a project called Faye, which I'm super excited about. Now, Fei has championed many interesting ideas, including the idea of protocol controlled value liquidity as a service. And it's one of the more kind of complex and fascinating experiments that I've come across in crypto, and I'm really privileged to be an early investor as well.
00:01:07.200 - 00:02:05.466, Speaker A: Now, because this episode is pretty technical and we do go into the weeds of how Faye's mechanism design works, I think it will be helpful to describe how it works quickly. First, so Fei is a USD pact stablecoin, and it also has a separate token called tribe, which is used for various purposes, including governance of the stablecoin. Now, a lot of us are familiar with Makerdao, which is the credit backed stablecoin project. With Maker, you go to the protocol with some Ethereum, you deposited that Ethereum into the protocol, and then you can take out a loan which is denominated in USD against that collateral. Now, for Faye, the key difference is quite dramatic, because instead of depositing that collateral and borrowing against it, when you bring your ETH to Fay, the protocol actually buys the ETH from you and pays you in the stablecoin Fei. So the protocol ends up owning the ETH. So with this comes a lot of implications about liquidity management, capital efficiency, and there's a lot more nuance to this, of course.
00:02:05.466 - 00:02:07.706, Speaker A: So we're gonna save that for the episode.
00:02:07.890 - 00:02:20.374, Speaker B: So, to explain what Fei is, how it works, how the team managed to recover from a somewhat rocky start and is on track to disrupt Defi today, I'm super excited to have founder Joey Santoro on the show. So welcome to the show, Joey.
00:02:20.724 - 00:02:42.348, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks, Jason. I'm really excited to be here. It's been an incredible journey for this protocol and obviously this early supporters. The early community really helped us get through, like you mentioned, a pretty rough lunch, and now we're in, honestly phenomenal shape. And I'm really excited to kind of share that with your audience and with the broader crypto community.
00:02:42.516 - 00:02:52.150, Speaker B: Yeah, most definitely. And before we dive into kind of the weeds, I'd love to kind of just start with the high level here. So, Joey, what is Faye, and what is the pain point that you were trying to tackle when you started? Faye?
00:02:52.292 - 00:03:25.022, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So I've been defi native since around 2017. Very technical background. I just fell in love with the idea of Ethereum. It's like programmable money, programmable interoperable applications, censorship, resistance. I really loved it. And the early DeFi protocols compound makerdao super inspired, and by, say, around 2020, you had defi summer, and it felt like stablecoin innovation was pretty stagnant.
00:03:25.022 - 00:04:01.844, Speaker C: And at that point, there was a bunch of crazy algorithmic stable coins that were unbacked and super volatile. And I saw the writing on the wall there. I was like, those things are not going to work. And I was involved in the MD set dollar community, learned a lot there. And, yeah, I guess it was clear that stablecoins were in the zeitgeist. People needed a decentralized defi native stablecoin, but they didn't have that. And Makerdao is obviously still like an incredible piece of infrastructure, but there are some concerns around its dependence on USDC or its scalability.
00:04:01.844 - 00:04:52.268, Speaker C: The idea behind FEI was to create a defi native sustainable stablecoin that could scale really easily, but also be backed by fully decentralized assets. And that was this idea of protocol controlled value, which is the real huge idea behind Faye. My mental model for Faye is really that it's protocol control value is this abstract concept, and then you just mint a stablecoin against that protocol controlled value, almost like one giant maker vault that's managed by the tribe holders. And that's a pretty high level idea of Faye. And it's always been this way. But v two leans a lot more in that direction than v one did. And I'm sure we're going to get a chance to talk about some of those differences.
00:04:52.268 - 00:05:00.020, Speaker C: But the real high level defi native scalable stablecoin, fully decentralized, that's the big idea behind Faye.
00:05:00.132 - 00:05:41.974, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think the awareness for the importance of that has been increased over the past year or so as well, especially because I think Makerdao was so relied upon by DeFi, but that it also started incorporating a lot of more centralized assets as collateral, like USDC and real world assets, which some of the defi kind of hardline proponents are not a big fan of, especially because it introduces maybe unknown dependencies on the non defi world. So actually, that touches on my next question, which is, before we dive into the technical mechanism design, can you help listeners understand just roughly how fate differs from these existing stable coins out there, be it makerdao or even terraust, which a lot of people are talking about today?
00:05:42.134 - 00:06:25.504, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So I could talk forever about this. So I'll try to paint with very broad I'll try to paint with very broad strokes because obviously I know, like almost every single stable coin in great detail and how the tiny differences, but I'll try and I'll try and paint with very broad strokes. So Faye, on a high level, like I said, it's like one big maker vault. So you have the collateral, that's the pcV, and the debt, which is FeI. But in maker, individual users make open individual vaults. In Faye, it's kind of like tribe holders are the one big vault owner, and they decide what the collateral gets, where it gets deployed, and what the minting caps for Fay are and things like this.
00:06:25.504 - 00:07:13.522, Speaker C: So that's one mental model. And then the other mental model is in fave two, at least FEI is one to one redeemable. So you can always buy FeI for a dollar worth of some on chain asset, some token or ETH, and then you can always redeem it for $1. So in that sense, it's kind of like USDC or USDT, where it's just one to one with dollars. But instead of using dollars in a bank account, you use crypto tokens on chain. So those are kind of the two big mental models that I use, like USDC on chain versus, or like one big maker vault. So that's kind of where it stands, like it is one to one redeemable, but it's also collateralized, but not over collateralized.
00:07:13.522 - 00:07:39.224, Speaker C: It's not like a debt backed stable coin like makerdao, even though it sort of acts like one at scale. It's more like people are buying and selling Faye against the protocol. Does that analogy make sense? I can talk about, like, terra and other algorithmic stable coins as well, but I'm curious if those analogies were pretty salient as far as how Faye fits relative to kind of the big three.
00:07:39.844 - 00:08:03.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And we're going to definitely dive even deeper into detail to make sure people understand this. But what you just said in terms of v two, which we'll talk about as well, sounds a little bit like the Terra model, where people can redeem ust the stablecoin for Luna, which is their native token, or the other way around. What would you say is the major difference between Terra and Faye? Fi two?
00:08:03.634 - 00:08:57.478, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So if you can think of a spectrum where Fi is kind of in between Dai and USDC and Terra, it inherits some features of all of them. And kind of another analogy, like if your users are familiar with the Frac, stablecoin Frax is basically like exactly halfway between USDC and Terra, right? Like it's maybe 80% backed by stable coins. On any given day, that number changes. I don't know what it is right now. Maybe it's 60%, and then the rest of it's backed by FXS. And so the part that's backed by FXS is identical to Luna, Terra and FEI is most similar to fracs, among other stablecoins.
00:08:57.478 - 00:09:58.938, Speaker C: But the difference is really important. So with Terra, you have this idea that the Luna token is absorbing volatility in the demand for UST. So if USD goes to 101, then the Arb loop is you sell it for, or you buy it for $1 worth of Luna, that Luna gets burned, and then you sell it on the market and the price comes back to a dollar. So the real key feature is that Luna is absorbing volatility and demand for the stablecoin itself, because that's captured by direct arbitrage with the price changing with Faye, the tribe token in V two is actually going to be used to absorb volatility in the collateral, not demand. So the demand is satisfied by redeemability with a collateral which is exogenous. So it's like ETH or Dai or Rye or Defi pulse index. So it's these external assets that are backing Fae, not tribe.
00:09:58.938 - 00:10:17.832, Speaker C: And tribe is just kind of acting as an absorbing buffer of the volatility in that collateral, not the demand for Faye. So it's an extra step, if you will. But the extra step involves having this giant treasury of PCV that is used to backfire.
00:10:17.968 - 00:10:59.540, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really interesting to hear these different designs as well. And for listeners who want to understand at a higher level, what are the comparisons behind these different models, you can check out episode 128 and 129, where we had Ben Simon on to describe the different ponzi nomics of the different stable coins. And we also did one episode 147 where we had Sam from Frax describing how fracs actually work. So just a few episodes for listeners to check out. Enjoy it. I'd love to kind of dive into how v two works, but I don't think we can understand it before we understand how v one worked. So let's talk about v one, because one of the core innovations there was this idea of protocol controlled value, which is really important.
00:10:59.540 - 00:11:03.408, Speaker B: Can you explain what it is and why is it so groundbreaking?
00:11:03.536 - 00:11:43.370, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So protocol controlled value is honestly like a very obvious and powerful idea, which is that when a DAO has assets that it can deploy algorithmically, it doesn't have to deploy those assets in a purely mercenary way. It can deploy those assets to achieve some additional goal. That goal could be liquidity. That goal could be, um, you know, defending a peg. In Faye's case, that goal could be attracting users, like through, like, yield farming or whatever. But, like, it's not always this, like, black or white, like, mercenary kind of, you know, or using it to pay developers.
00:11:43.370 - 00:12:27.828, Speaker C: Like, having smart contracts means you can do much more complicated behaviors. And that's what makes PCV so powerful, is that it allows our DAO to kind of like, provide services to other daos or to users that, or defend the peg. And I think that that's kind of the really powerful idea there, and that's why it's so important. But the way I always say is, like, there was a bunch of teams developing this idea around the same time you had, like, the Olympus team was developing. This Frax also looks very similar to, like, a PCV model tokamak now. So it's kind of like a rebrand on the concept of a treasury. But I see a protocol treasury as a subset of PCV.
00:12:27.828 - 00:13:05.892, Speaker C: And PCV is just this idea that any asset that is sovereignly owned by a protocol, that's PCV. And then you can break it down into this PCV is defending the peg. This PCV is earning yield. This PCV is the treasury that pays developers or whatever. So PCV is just this broad idea, and it unlocks some pretty powerful use cases that, like, I guess, are highlighted in kind of this DeFi 2.0 movement. And so I'm really grateful that the terminology PCV kind of latched onto people because that's a really powerful idea.
00:13:05.988 - 00:14:01.470, Speaker A: Now, before I continue, I'd love to share one of my favorite products in crypto. With you. Now whenever I want to trade a token instead of going to uniswap sushiswap bancor one by one to see where I can find the best quote, I just go to Paraswap to scan for the best price anywhere because per swap aggregates all the popular ethereum dexs and saves me a ton of time and headache in finding where I can trade something for the best price and lets me trade in one place. Now the cool thing is theyve also integrated with ledger live as well, meaning I can now swap at the best prices directly from my ledger wallet. So seriously, if youre a defi trader and youre worried about the security risks of centralized exchanges, but you also dont want to scour dozens of dexs just to find the best price, you have to check out Periswap. So head on over to Paraswap IO blockcrunch I'd also love to take a moment to talk about the Hbar foundation. Now if you approached me one to two years ago, I would tell you I'm really skeptical of layer one systems outside of ethereum.
00:14:01.470 - 00:14:46.568, Speaker A: But in the past twelve months I started to notice billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of users flocking to new blockchains left and right. And then I realized there's an actual market gap being filled. And I always love to support projects who support builders. And one of those projects is Hedera Hashgraph. Hedera is an enterprise grade public network with its own crypto asset called HBAR, and the Hbar foundation has launched, with an initial budget of over $2 billion, to provide entrepreneurs with the funding and ecosystem support needed to quickly build and deploy new applications on the Hedera Hashgraph network. The HbAR foundation is eager to find builders in defi nfTs, gaming, sustainability, and all sectors. So if you are a builder, a developer, or creator with an idea, visit hbarfoundation.org
00:14:46.568 - 00:14:47.456, Speaker A: to learn more.
00:14:47.600 - 00:14:48.720, Speaker B: I'd love to talk a little bit.
00:14:48.752 - 00:15:31.238, Speaker D: About notional if you've followed the show for long enough, you know I'm pretty excited about fixed rate products. Notional finance is the leading fixed rate borrowing and lending protocol, and they've just released a major upgrade. With notional, you can not only borrow and lend at fixed rates for up to one year now, but liquidity providers also have a pretty good opportunity. Thanks to an integration with compound and a liquidity mining program, LP's can actually earn interest, liquidity fees and token liquidity mining incentives as well. We've talked with Teddy from notional recently and as a happy investor as well, I've been pretty impressed with how the team is building this critical infrastructure that will help onboard the next billion users to deFi. So you can check it out today at Notional Finance blockcrunch.
00:15:31.366 - 00:15:52.762, Speaker B: Yeah, and just to clarify here. So PZ fee basically refers to the idea where if you deposit a collateral into the protocol, the collateral now belongs to the protocol. You can't withdraw it, unlike in maker, where if I deposit Ethereum, I mint Dai, but I can always withdraw my ethereum by burning my dai at any time. So is that kind of the core idea there?
00:15:52.858 - 00:16:15.578, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. So other systems have TVL, which is like an IOU, but PCV is not an IOU. It's an exchange of value, and then the protocol becomes the owner of that asset once you deposit it. So that was kind of the big idea behind favor. And there was a couple other innovations that are not as powerful, but that was the main one.
00:16:15.666 - 00:16:29.818, Speaker B: So if people are exchanging collateral directly for this new stablecoin, this fi stablecoin, that means the ability of FaYE to maintain a PEC is incredibly important. So can you describe a little bit about how FAye 1.0 achieved a peck with USD?
00:16:29.946 - 00:17:17.440, Speaker C: Yeah, so the idea behind FEI V one was that PCV would kind of back the value of Faye by making it very liquid on secondary markets, and then the protocol would use direct incentives to keep the peg, which was basically a penalty for selling below the peg and a reward for buying it back up. In practice, the launch was massive. It was the biggest defi launch in history in terms of ETH raised or really dollars raised. And all this went to the protocol, right? Like, none of it went to fay labs. It was totally just like ETH for the protocol to back Faye. And in exchange for all that, ETH users got fae. But because it was such an early protocol, there was nowhere to put it.
00:17:17.440 - 00:18:05.426, Speaker C: So everyone just kind of wanted to cash out their feI because we didn't have any integrations, there was no, like, native staking yet. So everyone sold, and then the penalty got really high. And it was a very light touch kind of mechanism. It was very nuanced, and it required really careful parameterization, and the launch just kind of totally steamrolled it, and the Fapeg broke. It didn't recover for over a month. But we did recover, and we can talk about that journey, I guess, and the lessons learned there, the big one, was that redeemability is the way to keep a peg. I think everyone's kind of learned that, like, the market is way too volatile for any other kind of mechanism.
00:18:05.426 - 00:18:44.496, Speaker C: So in, like, usT's case, you're redeeming against Luna, in Makerdao's case, you're redeeming against USDC. In USDC's case, you're redeeming against dollars. In Frax's case, you're redeeming against sometimes dollars and sometimes fxs, or rather proportion of each, depending on the algorithmic collateralization ratio. And Fei is similar. It's always one to one redeemability in this case, usually with ETH, but it could be any other ERC 20 token, but it's always external collateral. It's never the tribe token itself that's being redeemed. Well, I can qualify that.
00:18:44.496 - 00:18:48.376, Speaker C: But in normal operations, you're not using the tribe token.
00:18:48.520 - 00:18:52.766, Speaker B: The tribe token is the native governance token for Faye. Just to clarify.
00:18:52.960 - 00:18:57.770, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah. So Fei is the stablecoin tribe is the governance token. Yeah.
00:18:57.922 - 00:19:10.210, Speaker B: Before we go into some of the lessons learned from the launch as well, can you describe the point you made about Faye providing liquidity to maintain the pec in v one? How did that work, exactly?
00:19:10.322 - 00:19:48.684, Speaker C: Yeah, so this was honestly like a pretty cool feature of Faye v one. All the ETH that was raised at genesis was immediately deployed into a liquidity pool on Uniswap. And this was a $2.6 billion liquidity pool. It was the biggest liquidity pool Uniswap has ever seen, and it probably will be for a really long time, because now, with V three, it's way more capital efficient. But, yeah, it was basically this huge, huge liquidity pool, which made the price pretty hard to move. And then the protocol, beyond direct incentives, had an additional mechanism called re weights.
00:19:48.684 - 00:20:08.932, Speaker C: And the reweights were really what was like the final backstop, where the protocol would use its PCV to bring the price back up to a dollar by making a trade using its own assets. And that's kind of what I meant by PCV. Not always being about money, but sometimes just being about defending a peg. And that was kind of like the idea behind reweights.
00:20:09.068 - 00:20:44.270, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's the part that I think a lot of people struggle with, because they're used to over collateralized models like Makerdao, where you deposit ETH, and the ETH does nothing but backstop the value of your loan. So, basically, if your collateral drops in value, you get liquidated, whereas in this case, it sounds like you're actually taking the collateral and then doing something else with it, other than just backing the value of the Faye, that's taken out. So can you help listeners who may be unfamiliar with this new paradigm understand how is that possible? Is it not dangerous to take the collateral and do something else with it? Shouldn't it just be sitting there and backstopping the value of the stablecoin?
00:20:44.392 - 00:21:41.374, Speaker C: Yeah, so here, this is like the big idea is basically that because Faye protocol is operating at like a really big scale, we can diversify the collateral, we can put it into a bunch of different protocols to mitigate the tail risks, to mitigate the price risks. And Faye v two actually introduces algorithmic rebalancing, where, depending on the collateralization ratio, the protocol is going to be more conservative or more aggressive with its allocation. And this is all done automatically using balance or smart pools and custom weights. It's a really, really powerful feature. And the idea is that the protocol can maintain a very healthy collateralization ratio by earning yield, by providing secondary liquidity, by diversifying. And if anything bad ever does happen, the tribe token is there to kind of restore, recapitalize. And those are like the big ideas behind Fav two.
00:21:41.374 - 00:21:41.862, Speaker C: Got it.
00:21:41.878 - 00:22:01.206, Speaker B: And we're definitely going to dig into the minutiae for fav two as well. But just to sum up this part of the conversation, which is regarding the FEi 1.0 launch, what would you say were the biggest lessons out there from the launch, and how did Faye actually regain its PEC and recover from that initial launch?
00:22:01.350 - 00:22:37.704, Speaker C: Yeah, so, I mean, this is obviously like, kind of. It was a very intense learning experience, let's put it that way. Like, I have grown quite a lot as a developer, as a community leader, as a founder of a company and a protocol, it's hard to be good at any one of those things with Fav one, really. There was so many things that went wrong. There was bugs in the code. People didn't understand the mechanism, the peg was breaking. And all this happened at the same time.
00:22:37.704 - 00:23:26.024, Speaker C: I think that, like, in terms of defi lessons learned, like, definitely be conservative with your launches, take your time, really make sure you, you know, you have a really solid understanding of what's going to happen and how to recover if things don't go well. One of the big problems was that there was no recovery mechanism built into the protocol if things were to go this badly. And so it took over a month to kind of right the peg. And so we should have done more planning upfront before the launch. And also we definitely should have over communicated with the community that there was. It was just like a lack of comms kind of led to a lack of trust. And this is something that I feel very deeply like.
00:23:26.024 - 00:23:54.780, Speaker C: I learned so many things that I wish I could go back and do better. And now I guess all I can do is do my best. And Faye is in a really good spot right now. And I think a lot of people are still thinking about what Faye looked like in April, because it wasn't that long ago, but Faye is in such a better spot. And the way that we got there was by taking out complexity, things that weren't clearly good or bad. We just went straight back to a redeemability model. And that's actually what got us.
00:23:54.780 - 00:24:32.770, Speaker C: What got the peg back was we removed the direct incentives, and we relied heavily on re weights, which basically just kept the peg at a dollar all the time because the protocol was over collateralized. And then we slowly just, like, continued to make partnerships, increase utility for Faye. Remove broken code or remove, like, extra code. That wasn't necessary. Simplify the code base. And then we started doing some deep planning for v two, but by then, the peg was solid, and it was kind of just put your head down, make something really good. And now we're finally ready to, like, show the defi community what we've done.
00:24:32.770 - 00:24:47.574, Speaker C: And I'm really excited about where Faye is going. And the lessons learned are definitely, like, scars and a badge of honor at the same time. Like, we made it through a pretty hard, hard thing as a community, and so now we're very resilient.
00:24:48.354 - 00:25:17.174, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely, definitely. I love the honesty there, and I love this point you made about stripping out complexity and going back to kind of fundamentals here. Now, you did mention that redeemability is going to be a big feature in 2.0. Does that actually conflict with this idea of PCV? And just as a reminder to listeners, this idea of PCV is that you cannot redeem the collateral, and the protocol controls the collateral, and they can do whatever they want with the collateral. So now that it's redeemable, does it kind of conflict with that?
00:25:17.334 - 00:25:55.950, Speaker C: No, it's not conflicting at all. It's actually, it requires just like, one little reframe. But basically, when you mint Faye, you're not lending the protocol the asset you used to mint it with, you're giving it up. So you no longer have price exposure to that asset. Like, if I buy one FEI for $1 worth of ETH today, and then ETH goes up two x, the protocol gets that benefit. And if you go give the FEI back to the protocol, they're gonna give you half as much ETH as you put in. So that's why it's pcv and not something else, is because you don't maintain price exposure.
00:25:55.950 - 00:26:19.180, Speaker C: Once you buy Fei from the protocol, you completely sacrifice your collateral. It's not collateral, you're just giving it. You're making a trade, basically. And that's the big idea there. So then it's all PCB. And that's why Fav two is basically just a PCV backed stablecoin. That's like the big idea.
00:26:19.180 - 00:26:21.664, Speaker C: An algorithmic bank, if you will.
00:26:22.084 - 00:26:35.344, Speaker B: Got it. That makes sense. I'm actually curious. So with 1.0, why was redeemability taken off the table? I'm sure you've thought about introducing redeemability in v 1.0 as well. But what was the rationale for not having that in the version one?
00:26:36.164 - 00:27:25.494, Speaker C: Yeah, it's because we were worried about volatility risk, because it's a complex problem to manage volatile collateral. And so we thought direct incentives was like a better mechanism for maintaining the peg, using kind of literally a more direct, like, not price dependent mechanism. But it just turns out that that's not good enough. So redeemability really is like the way to maintain a peg. And so instead we do rely on like sophisticated portfolio management as a mechanism in v two. But v one thought that that wouldn't be too hard, but we decided that it was the right way to go for v two. So that's kind of the decision there.
00:27:25.614 - 00:27:39.794, Speaker B: Yeah. And redeemability is just one of the core design goals of v two. I know you wrote this blog post about some of the key goals around the redesign. So can you walk us through what are the key goals here? What are the main objectives with version two of Fae?
00:27:39.914 - 00:28:44.520, Speaker C: Yeah, so v two is really, it's really three major upgrades and then a bunch of other, like, smaller upgrades, new website. But the big upgrades are this one to one redeemability that I mentioned. The second upgrade I've already mentioned as well. It's the algorithmic pcv management, where the price changes according to what the PCV allocation changes according to what we call a risk curve, where the riskier the PCV is, the closer it gets to 100% collateralized, the more stable assets we have. So we would be shifting into assets like DAi, LUSD, rye, the closer we get to 100% so that we're less at risk of like an ETH collapse, for example. And then on the flip side, if PCB is doing really well, then we can allocate into ETH and like have these more volatile assets, like various low cap index coupe products or whatever. Yeah, and it's all done algorithmically using our on chain collateralization, Oracle, which is pretty cool.
00:28:44.520 - 00:29:28.166, Speaker C: And the last feature is kind of the way that it all ties together. And this is kind of what makes it beautiful, is that the tribe token is there to both get rewarded in the form of buybacks when things are going well, when the PCV is doing well, it's above 100% reserve ratio. And when the PCB is below the target reserve ratio, then tribe is similar to terra. This is where the overlap is, is available to be minted and sold for Fae in order to recapitalize the system. So it kind of uses like half of the terra model, if you will, and only when the protocol is under the target reserve ratio.
00:29:28.300 - 00:29:40.194, Speaker B: And one of the key ideas that you often talk about, as you describe v two as well, is also liquidity as a service. So can you explain what it is and what are some of the main issues with liquidity mining today?
00:29:40.354 - 00:30:16.776, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. So this is like. So when I talk about the features of v two, I'm talking mostly about the mechanism for how the peg is maintained. But liquidity as a service is really what makes faith like, kind of special. And it highlights phase product market fit that, that we found. So kind of to take a step back, we see a stable coin, like makerdao, like dai, as a stable coin for consumers. It's a place where consumers want to go to get capital efficiency, to get liquidity against their collateral, and they don't want to sell their ETH.
00:30:16.776 - 00:31:13.486, Speaker C: So they go and mint dai and they can use that for leverage. They can use it to fund their lifestyle. But it's very like user centric, it's very consumer oriented. For Makerdao, with Faye, what we found is that because we use sort of a looser monetary policy in the form of PCV, FeI protocol can mint faye, and as long as it's not endangering the peg, can use it algorithmically to deploy into lending markets as liquidity, or pair against other tokens to provide swapping liquidity, like on Uniswap or sushiswap. This was the big idea is that Faye is a stablecoin for daos. It's a stable coin that can provide services to daos because of the scale that it operates at, because of PCV. This particular product, liquidity as a service, is a partnership that we're doing with Ondo to give some high level context about Ondo.
00:31:13.486 - 00:32:06.186, Speaker C: Ondo is a structured products platform. And their first product is a way to basically divide up a uniswap pair or sushiswap pair into two parts. The junior tranche, which takes on all the fees and all the impermanent loss, and the senior tranche, which kind of gets a fixed yield but doesn't take advantage of any of the. Doesn't take advantage of any of the swap fees or impermanent loss, and it's protected from impermanent loss. The senior tranche is usually the stable tranche, and the junior tranche is, like the leverage tranche. And when I talked to Nate, I immediately realized that if Faye protocol could be in the senior tranche, then Faye is protected against price movements in the paired token. And so the senior tranche is always one asset, and the junior tranche is the other asset.
00:32:06.186 - 00:32:56.924, Speaker C: In this case, the junior tronage would be like the product token or the project token. Excuse me. And together, they would go and provide liquidity. So, think about it like, if we wanted to do this with, for example, the compound dao. Compound Dao says, we want a bunch of liquidity comp fey on uniswap or sujiswap, they provide a bunch of the comp token to this vault and fei protocol. The fei dao would provide a bunch of FEI, and then they would get paired in the vault, and FEi protocol is protected against impermanent loss. And this is the cheapest way to get a massive amount of USD denominated liquidity, because all the compound Dao has to do is pay a small fee to Faye protocol, and they get to take back all their comp tokens at the end, minus impermanent loss.
00:32:56.924 - 00:33:24.238, Speaker C: But they also earn all the exchange fees. So this could actually even be profitable for other daos to monetize their treasuries. And then we think it's a really powerful feature and a really nice. It has nice trade offs relative to the other kind of like, deFi 2.0 liquidity as a service type of models so that these DAos can kind of pick. Well, do I want Il? Do I not want? Do I. But do I want to earn fees? I'll use last with Ondo and Fei.
00:33:24.238 - 00:34:08.004, Speaker C: Do I want. No, Il. But I also don't get fees, and it's more of, like, a long term approach. Well, maybe you use Toca Mac, and if you kind of like more of an upfront cost to acquire toca and be involved in their ecosystem, but more. More like, you know, you get these, like, benefits from being a part of their network or do you want to own the liquidity? Because like with, with Fei and Tokamak, you're renting it with, with Olympus Pro, you're actually like purchasing this liquidity and you get to keep it. So it's kind of like PCV as a service. And so the way that we see this faye and Ondo liquidity as a service is, it's like the cheapest, quickest way to get liquidity, to get short term rented liquidity.
00:34:08.004 - 00:34:18.376, Speaker C: And that's a pretty unique offering, I think, and kind of what illustrates why FEI is so powerful and v two specifically.
00:34:18.480 - 00:34:56.316, Speaker B: Yeah, I love this idea that Makerdao is for consumers and FEi is for daos. And I love to kind of dive deeper into this because as you mentioned of DeFi 2.0, there's so many newer DeFi protocols that allow daos to capitalize or add liquidity to their protocols in different ways. So there's Tokimak. Now there's Olympus Pro, which has been getting a lot of attention as well. I know you touched a little bit on this, but can you help us break down? So for any DAO operators out there, how should they think about choosing between using Tokimak, using Olympus Pro and using Fei? What are the different objectives that they should have in mind if they, when they decide to kind of pick one of these three to use?
00:34:56.460 - 00:35:24.684, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So I actually, I wrote an article about this not too long ago. It was, the goal of the article was really just to paint the trade off space. Like, it was pretty neutral. It highlighted these, these three offerings and kind of the pros and cons. There was really nice graphic kind of explaining what the trade offs are. And honestly, I think if you're a Dow operator, you should do all three of them because they're all, they all kind of provide a different type of liquidity and a different type of benefit.
00:35:24.684 - 00:36:26.110, Speaker C: So I think the PCV as a service idea from Olympus Pro is like really powerful. If there's a certain token that you want to acquire, you can use bonds to kind of have. It's still like, you're still like sort of issuing your token, but instead of just renting the liquidity, you get to keep it at the end. And that's a really powerful idea. But that's obviously very different and still very expensive relative to, say, Faye, where in Faye's case, you can spin up really huge amounts of liquidity against Faye, and all you have to do is take on the risk of impermanent loss, but you get to earn the swap fees so if you expect a lot of volume, you might want to use FeI because you get to keep the trading fees. And then lastly you have tokamak, where you make this upfront investment into Toka to seed the reactor. But then you can kind of direct that liquidity to different exchanges against different pairs depending on what your needs are.
00:36:26.110 - 00:36:58.516, Speaker C: It's a little bit more complicated, a little bit more of a kind of an upfront investment and a long term investment. But with Tokamak, you're protected against Il. So if you know you want that liquidity for a really long time, and you may want to move it around and have a little bit more optionality, you might want to invest in Tokamak. And I think all three are powerful and they all play a unique role. So you should consider trying all of them and then kind of maybe honing your use cases from there once you've kind of seen the effects in the wild. That would be my suggestion, yeah, and.
00:36:58.540 - 00:37:28.450, Speaker B: I'm definitely going to link that blog post below in notes as well. I think your blog is extremely underrated. More people should be reading your blog, so I'm definitely going to link that in the show notes below. So, listeners, if you're checking this out, definitely make sure to bookmark that page and read everything that Joey's written. I personally learned a lot and I'd love to zoom out a little bit. As we come to the final part of this discussion, we talk a lot about mechanism design. What you learn from v one, how it carried over to v two, and how v two will make fei the de facto stablecoin for daos.
00:37:28.450 - 00:37:35.766, Speaker B: So when it comes to the biggest ways to create demand for Faye, what are you most excited about in the next 1224 months?
00:37:35.890 - 00:38:11.944, Speaker C: Yeah, like I said, my mental model for what Faye is has really shifted towards like, extremely defined native use cases, like partnering with other daos, and obviously as like play to earn and the metaverse, these kind of like more like nfts. Like these use cases are starting to really gain traction and Faye has a lot of applications there as well. Like these really long tail assets. They need. They need liquidity pools. And Faye liquidity as a service is perfect for that. Faye protocol is like very willing to partner with these more long tail type of projects.
00:38:11.944 - 00:39:08.280, Speaker C: And yeah, that's where I think that Faye really wins and achieves its vision, is when all these daos, they want to have Faye as a part of their protocol, they want to have Faye owning their governance token, they want to have Faye having skin in the game because Faye is the most value add partner. If you're going to sell your tokens to VC's, there are some really value add VC's, but you can't compare to a capital allocator like Faye that can mint stable coins, provide PCV as TVL, provide liquidity, help you bootstrap oracles, and that's where Faye really grows. It grows with defi. The more projects that come into this like Faye umbrella and work with Faye, the better it is for the whole ecosystem. And I think Faye is honestly finally finding product market fit. We're super close with Rari Capital. We have a ton of FEI and fuse.
00:39:08.280 - 00:39:43.800, Speaker C: We have the third largest fuse pool, one of the largest stablecoin issuances and volumes for borrowing on fuse. We're also really close with index co op. We have a ton of DPI liquidity, a bunch of the index token, and there's more projects already in the pipeline that want to partner with Faye, sort of get that liquidity as a service. And that's where I really think that Faye is going to win. And I'm super excited about those use cases because it's very partnership centric, it's very community oriented, and it's super exciting.
00:39:43.992 - 00:40:00.814, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, I think that's a great note to end this on. So any doubts, if this interests you at all, definitely reach out to Joey to work with Faye. I can't recommend it enough. Well, thank you so much for taking the time, Joey. And if people want to kind of reach out to you or keep up to date with Faye, what are the best resources for them to do this?
00:40:00.974 - 00:40:35.664, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. The vast majority of our community lives in discord, so definitely join our discord. I'm sure Jason will leave an invite link in the chat. You can follow our Twitter, a protocol. You could follow me at Joey Santoro and yeah, like, those are the main mediums where we kind of engage with the community, our Twitter and discord. But yeah, we're really excited about v two. The community is very excited.
00:40:35.664 - 00:41:24.548, Speaker C: Oh, and I guess something I'll plug is that tomorrow, actually? Well, I mean, tomorrow as we're recording, but well, after this video is released, we'll kick off the buybacks and Faye protocol's equity is currently over $800 million. And so 20% of that this year is going to go towards buying back the tribe token. And we think that's a great way to kind of like reward tribe holders and keep them incentive aligned to kind of manage the pcv, like on the mechanism level. That was like a big component of fav, too, to kind of bake these in these automatic buybacks. And those are going to start as the first feature rollout for v two. And then obviously, the main release is December 15. We just posted that announcement article, so keep an eye out.
00:41:24.548 - 00:41:31.324, Speaker C: We're ready. We would love to have you in the community. Come join and participate.
00:41:31.484 - 00:41:34.852, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, that's a great note to end this on. So thanks for coming on, Joey.
00:41:34.988 - 00:41:36.404, Speaker C: Thanks, Jason. Yeah, thanks for having me.
