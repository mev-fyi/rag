00:00:00.440 - 00:00:26.816, Speaker A: One thing that I've seen a lot of traders in the NFT space make the mistake of is being like, okay, I need to have this kind of returns. I need to find something in the market right now that fits this profile. It may just not exist. Right. And people can talk themselves into aping the wrong thing. Again, I'm going to go back to what I said earlier, which is my strategy is make money for my LP's. Why? Because the environment changes so often and so frequently in nfts that like, that.
00:00:26.816 - 00:00:59.084, Speaker A: The way to do that does also change very substantially. Right. And so I think strong opinions, loosely held, is a really important concept here, where be patient, look for the right play. When you have conviction, ape with conviction, but don't feel like you need exposure to everything. That's the easiest way to lose money, because if you look like most NFT projects go down as a function of time, if you're just like, yeah, I want indexed exposure to everything, you're almost guaranteed to lose money. And I think we have to come at this from the perspective too, of very somber reality, which is that most of these projects won't matter in the next cycle.
