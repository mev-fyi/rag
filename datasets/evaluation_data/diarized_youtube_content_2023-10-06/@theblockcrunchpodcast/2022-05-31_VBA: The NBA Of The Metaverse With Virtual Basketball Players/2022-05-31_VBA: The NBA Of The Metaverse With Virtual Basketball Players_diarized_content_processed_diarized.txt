00:01:07.824 - 00:01:34.970, Speaker A: All right, hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, this week I'm really excited to continue diving into the world of games in crypto. And with me today is the founder of VBA Virtual Basketball association, which is a fantasy basketball game built on Solana. And Charles also happens to be an old friend of mine from way back before crypto. So I'm really, really excited to have Charles on the show to talk to us all things virtual Basketball association and all things fantasy sports. So welcome to the show, Charles.
00:01:35.162 - 00:01:37.174, Speaker D: Thank you, Jason. I'm excited to be here.
00:01:37.474 - 00:01:50.054, Speaker A: Yeah, man. And look, I've known you for a while now, before crypto, and I know you took the leap into crypto after a brief sprint in, maybe not that brief, but a sprint in web two. So what kind of brought you over the edge into crypto?
00:01:50.444 - 00:03:13.804, Speaker D: Yeah, so a little bit of context here is I had spent basically the early part of 2021 exploring, starting my own company, and during this time explored, like, the gambit on, like, different consumer ideas, creator, like businesses, healthcare, different b two B SaaS plays, and just wasn't really able to find something that I was genuinely passionate about that I felt like I could work on for three years, five years, ten years, and basically, like, dedicate, like, the next ten years of my life, too. And something that I had always been really passionate about has been sports, basketball in particular, and then video games and fantasy sports in particular. And around the summer of 2021, I discovered this horse racing game, which I'm sure many people know called Zed Run, where people were buying these digital NFT horses, entering the competitions and racing them. And at first it didn't make a ton of sense to me. But as I dive deeper into the platform and I saw that people were making content and tools and really turning these NFTs into their own, that's when crypto really clicked for me, actually, in the context of NFTs used for games, where I saw people taking this thing, making it into their own thing because they had ownership over that asset and then making the ecosystem better for it, that's where motivation to build VBA on blockchain itself became a reality.
00:03:14.184 - 00:03:20.484, Speaker A: One of the things really interesting is you also spent a lot of time building web two before you were working at Facebook. For how many years?
00:03:20.964 - 00:03:24.412, Speaker D: I worked at Facebook and Instagram for about three and a half years before this.
00:03:24.508 - 00:03:30.904, Speaker A: Three and a half years. And how different has it been to build in web two versus building in web3?
00:03:31.724 - 00:04:19.964, Speaker D: I was actually just complaining about this with one of my friends earlier today. He was also Facebook. And the biggest jump has been it feels like the traditional way of building a consumer product in web two is ship an MVP, iterate for a long time until you find PMF, and then basically turn on the gas and grow it like crazy. It seems like the playbook is currently reversed in web3, where it's go out and do a bunch of marketing, hype it up, and then go out and figure out what to do with the community. This is something that I've been struggling with because I think the way that we're building our product is very much first principles, web two product. But I always have this question in the back of my head, like, oh, should we be doing it in this hype driven cycle versus like a product driven cycle?
00:04:20.264 - 00:04:53.424, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's super interesting, especially in nfts, right? It always comes down to the community verse. Like in a most previous, most recent episode, we talked to a project called Wasiverse, which is this metaverse built around this one weird meme that came out of the 2018 bear market cycle. And they didn't really have anything besides that meme, but they had the community and then they built this project around the community, which I think really brings home the point that you were talking about just now about community first. But let's shift the gears a little bit to talk about VBA. So what exactly is VBA and what gave you the idea to start this?
00:04:53.724 - 00:05:37.734, Speaker D: Yeah, so VBA stands for virtual Basketball association. And the way that I describe it is what we want to do here is we want to build a basketball league from the ground up on the blockchain. And in terms of like more like comps, right, we can say it's sort of like a combination of like NBA two k, like mygm mode with fantasy sports. And the idea here is that there's a bunch of fictional NFT basketball players. Each of them have their own set of attributes and characteristics. And then you basically, as the owner of these NFTs or the owner of a basketball team, basically try to put together the best team possible to enter in different types of competitions for like crypto rewards. The main motivation here is basically had always been like a huge basketball and fantasy sports fan.
00:05:37.734 - 00:06:09.044, Speaker D: Actually, my probably most played video game ever is like NBA two k. I used to sit in my basement with like my buddies in high school. We would simulate these games well into like 2030, 2040, and all the players would be fake, but we would still like continue to do it because we just loved competing each other in this format. And so when I was thinking more about NFTs and how we could make that ownership feeling even more real by giving them the asset that they basically own regardless of the game exists, that's when basically we really wanted to do the VBA as a concept.
00:06:09.504 - 00:06:16.568, Speaker A: And for those not familiar with two K and the manager mode, can you describe a little bit about what that is?
00:06:16.736 - 00:06:51.264, Speaker D: Yeah. So two K, MyGM or football manager, are these simulation games not super visual when you think about a AAA game where you're actually controlling a character, but rather you're sort of responsible for picking players on a team, setting some coaching strategies, basically training those players, and then basically using those players to compete in games. And all those games are simulated. So you take into account the attributes of those assets, have some RNG basically, and then output basically plays that lead to an end game result afterwards?
00:06:51.644 - 00:07:11.264, Speaker A: That's quite interesting. So I guess that's different from the core gameplay of two K where you're using the players to actually play in a basketball game. What was the decision behind, you know, pursuing the route of creating a manager simulation versus like, you know, a basketball, you know, a virtual basketball type of gameplay?
00:07:11.644 - 00:08:01.324, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the motivation is if you look at just like market size and like users, I think there are actually more people who are interested in like a manager or like fantasy sports game than there are in like the actual AAA video game. Because if you think about it like, it's quite heavyweight for you to go, like, plug in your Xbox, pick up a controller, and play, like, a 45 minutes game. Whereas if you just look at fantasy basketball as a concept, there's, like, 20 or 30 million people who play it every single year. And the concept here is that you can play on your browser, you can play it on your phone, and it's super accessible for you to spend 510 minutes a day max on this thing and still have a ton of fun with your friends during the course of the season. And so that's sort of the user that we were going after here is, like, the older adult who is probably a little bit more busy, but is still interested in having, like, a sports ownership or, like, sports competitive experience.
00:08:02.144 - 00:08:38.040, Speaker A: Yeah. And I should probably make a disclaimer that I am personally an angel investor in VBA as well. And that was one of the big reasons, you know, obviously, besides having known you for a long time and knowing you're one of the smartest people in my circle, but also this idea about creating a very easily accessible game that is not too hard to understand, that, you know, has a broad appeal to mainstream markets that can bring in people who. Who may not already be in crypto. I think that that was a very powerful idea, I guess. On that note, can we talk a little bit about the gameplay? So, I understand there's five fictional players that you're managing as a team, and how often do these players engage in matches, and how do they upgrade themselves? How does that work?
00:08:38.192 - 00:09:40.320, Speaker D: Yeah, so I'll describe sort of where we're headed by the end of the summer, because I think that's probably a more apt way to sort of understand what we want to build is, um, people, at first, will be able to enter their players in weekly competitions. And these weekly competitions are just like round robin groups where you're pitted against people of your same category. Um, we will have a salary cap so that, you know, just like in real sports, as a salary cap, to prevent richer teams from dominating poor teams. We wanted to install a salary cap so that crypto whales couldn't necessarily go in there and just dominate, like, your average crypto investor. Um, in the long term, we sort of splitting. We see this splitting up into multiple different game modes. And so we want to draw this distinction between what is, like, a franchise mode where, you know, we want to build, like, a lore and history to the league where people feel like there's, like, the all star team, like, the all rookie team, there's, like, a World cup type of concept where we really want to build up, like, a brand and identity around it, but we also really want to make sure that there's opportunity for people to play every single day versus just like on a weekly basis.
00:09:40.320 - 00:10:04.474, Speaker D: And so the thing that, where I'm probably most excited about shipping this summer is like an arcade mode or, like, daily fantasy for this, where people can enter their players in, like, hundreds of different game formats, basically ranging from, like, no salary cap to, like, only your common underdog players for different prizes. And this will really lean into sort of a lot of, like, the D gen sports betting gambler that exists in web3 today.
00:10:04.854 - 00:10:05.166, Speaker A: And.
00:10:05.190 - 00:10:05.366, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:10:05.390 - 00:10:13.314, Speaker A: Can you describe the concept of the salary cap? So does that mean the price for the player nfts, or is that something else?
00:10:13.494 - 00:10:49.154, Speaker D: Yeah. So again, I'm just gonna write a disclaimer here. That season zero, which is what our summer sort of, like, MVP period is, is like, very experimental. And I want to say that because I think the way that we're building this product is more akin to, like, a fantasy sports consumer app where you ship and then iterate versus, like, a game where you have everything built out beforehand and then ship the thing. And I think that's an important distinction to make because the expectations will be better aligned that way. Right. In terms of what I mean by salary cap is we've assigned players to start with based off of their rarity, like a value.
00:10:49.154 - 00:11:27.320, Speaker D: Sort of like how in DF's fantasy, like, Giannis will always be priced higher than basically like, Brook Lopez, because he's just not as good of a player. We've basically assigned based off of rarity to start with a price value and then make sure that people who put the five players in their lineup are below this total salary cap. I think over time the dynamics might change as we get more data. You can imagine that we would take into age of the asset into account, we could take into their stats into account, we could take into the attributes into account. But for now, we're starting with a sort of basic model based off of just the rarity of the asset itself.
00:11:27.512 - 00:11:38.824, Speaker A: Got it. So there is a cap in terms of the total, I guess, power of the team. You can't just have every single player in the team that's the most expensive NFT out there. The most powerful NFT out there.
00:11:39.404 - 00:12:03.854, Speaker D: Yes. For the franchise mode. Yeah, because I think we want to do it in a way in which it feels like it's competitive for everybody. When we get into the arcade mode, we know that there are basically, like, whales who want to flex their team of like, five legendary players. And in that way, basically, we'll allow them to just basically pay an entry fee for a higher stakes competition so that they can compete against other people who are on the same caliber as they are.
00:12:04.274 - 00:12:29.414, Speaker A: I know this is a very, very important decision for you guys, because I remember when we were first chatting about VBA, you wanted to make sure that you make a game where it's not paid to win, right? Where the rich people can just come in and pay and then just dominate the games at all times. But subsequently, you also thought that, okay, in nfts, there's always an element of whales wanting to flex their wealth. So how do you balance between the arcade mode and the franchise mode, and how did that decision get made?
00:12:29.914 - 00:13:10.296, Speaker D: Yeah, so the franchise mode is the mode for everybody, that we want everybody to be able to play, actually, both modes, I guess, for everybody, for different reasons. Right. The franchise modes for everybody in that, like, we wanted to have a standardized set of rules that people can play from and say, you know, everybody has a. Has a role in sort of building the history and the lore of the VBA. And then in the arcade mode, basically, we wanted to make sure that we gave opportunities for people from the lowest ranks of the highest ranks to play in something that felt, still felt fun and competitive. Um, in terms of basically preventing whales from just dominating from the beginning is we wanted to make sure that two things happened, right. One is that the assets were ROI capped.
00:13:10.296 - 00:13:52.464, Speaker D: And that unlike a lot of the first generation crypto games where assets would never sort of expire or depreciate, our assets will retire after a certain number of seasons are played. Um, and that way, basically, there's no LeBron James that plays for 100 years in the VBA. It's, you have to consistently keep up and you can't just hold an asset for forever to make it stay dominant. And then number two is we really want to introduce, like, a training system where folks can, like, earn in game currency or a token. We haven't necessarily worked out the exact details yet. There's certainly pros and cons to both where they can use those points to improve their players. And then basically, like, if you've grinded your way up, you can at least cash out by selling into a whale or work your way up into competing in that higher league.
00:13:52.894 - 00:14:22.714, Speaker A: That's such an interesting game design because obviously it's greater for engagement and retention because people have to come back and purchase new cards or recruit new players all the time. But from the investors perspective for people who hold the NFTs as collectibles. Like you see in the case of mystic axies, a lot of these PDE games, how do you guys communicate that? Hey, this NFT that you bought as a collectible, depreciate in value over time if it pay, you know, after a few seasons.
00:14:23.134 - 00:15:04.358, Speaker D: Yeah. Um, and context here of how long they're going to be is we have it basically so that players will retire between ten and 20 years of seasons of experience. And when we minted our players, we did, uh, zero to ten years of experience on all those assets. So we wanted to make sure that there was already some depreciation curve that was started, but nobody would sort of like starting in season one, some of the first players will start to retire. Uh, and what's interesting here is you can start to see the market start to price that. That way. Right, where it's, you know, a legendary rookie who has zero years of experience, like, the floor price on that is gonna make 100 soul, versus, like, a legendary player who has eight years of experience who might be near retirement is gonna have a lower value.
00:15:04.358 - 00:15:39.316, Speaker D: And so what you'll start to see is sort of similar to how real life basketball players have, like, different contract values at different ages. We're starting to see that based off of the earning potential of the different assets in the game itself. The other thing I'll say here, too, is that I think the whale dynamic within games adds an interesting wrinkle to pricing as well. And that I think whales are willing to spend more without the EV calculation than, like a lot of traditional investors are. And that, like, they're willing to pay more for the legendary player, even if it might not make sense, which is very much like a thing that has to happen for almost all games to. To do well. Right.
00:15:39.316 - 00:15:45.664, Speaker D: Is you have to have somebody who's willing to be even negative for that to work and more like status or pride.
00:15:46.004 - 00:15:56.748, Speaker A: And I guess on that point about status is the assumption that, you know, after some of these legendary players retire, that NFT will still retain some value because of the history, because of the kind of lore associated with it.
00:15:56.916 - 00:16:28.144, Speaker D: Yeah, so we. I won't commit to anything here. So we've had a couple of different ideas turned around from the community. One is basically allowing that player to turn into a trainer. So if you wanted to basically train new players, you know, having a legendary player sort of as a coach, will help you train better players or, you know, advanced players better. Um, the other way, basically here is, you know, uh, turning a legendary player into like a Hall of Fame asset, and then as a result of it making the hall of Fame, gaining some sort of special privileges, um, as part of like the rest of the ecosystem.
00:16:28.844 - 00:16:59.412, Speaker A: That's interesting because that also involves, I guess, a lot of lore, building a lot of matches to play out before some of those storylines can play out. And I'm curious because the parallel to fantasy sports here is that you guys are also doing these virtual matches, but all of your players are fictional players. Have you thought about using actual players, as in the case in a lot of fantasy sports games where you see actual NBA players? And how did that decision get made in terms of deciding to go with fictional players instead?
00:16:59.608 - 00:17:38.068, Speaker D: Yeah, so we evaluated this early in the, when we first started thinking about the VBA as a concept. And I think one of the things that came up around licensing is that the licenses is really expensive to get the MBA license. And once you get it, when you're really restricted to what you can do, as far as I understand. Right. So, like, there's this longstanding thing where FIFA developers always talk about how having the FIFA license sort of handicaps them from creating new competitive gameplay. And so our approach was always, let's build a compelling product first and then sort of explore licenses later, if that makes sense. The other side of this too, is something that I've really found fascinating.
00:17:38.068 - 00:18:59.074, Speaker D: A part of web3 is the ability for communities to make brand new ip, right? If you look at a lot of the top PFP projects like bored apes, Suzuki D, gods on Solana, like, you start to see people turn these assets into an identity, right? You have like a person who's a person and then also have like a burner account that's like bored ape number, like 153 or like noun, like 168, right? Like some. And then they turn entire identity around that. And there's this game that I was really interested in in 2020 called Blaseball, which if you're not familiar with it, is this like horror baseball simulator game where, you know, the fans would bet peanuts on these like 30 fictional teams that would play one season a week. And the community really went off the rails with the ip. At one point over the summer, they had over 100,000 users. People were just creating fan art and fictional storylines for all these different characters that they had just met via plain text. And so I really believe that there's an opportunity where it's like, we can even supercharge that, right, by giving people the benefit of, hey, you own the IP itself, what can you do with this player, can you turn it into something that's like a little michaela for basketball, for example, who don't know, is like this, like virtual Instagram influencer basically that isn't real, that people still follow and are really obsessed with.
00:18:59.374 - 00:19:00.902, Speaker B: Hey guys, I'm really excited to tell.
00:19:00.918 - 00:19:02.070, Speaker A: You more about one of my favorite.
00:19:02.102 - 00:19:05.534, Speaker B: Products in crypto right now, DyDx. This is a team I've known since.
00:19:05.574 - 00:19:07.246, Speaker A: 2018, and they've built one of the.
00:19:07.270 - 00:19:11.654, Speaker B: Best exchange venues out there that also happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly.
00:19:11.774 - 00:19:13.142, Speaker A: Now listen until the end, because there's.
00:19:13.158 - 00:19:46.660, Speaker B: An update for savvy traders out there as well. And here are just a few reasons why I like Dydx over other exchanges. First, it's very liquid. It processes two to $3 billion every day in volume and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording. Which means you can trade things like Ethereum, bitcoin, doge Solana, and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today. Second, it's also extremely cheap, and if you're down bad from the bear market, you don't have to worry, worry about gas fees at all, because there is no gas fee on starkware L2, where DYDX is built on. Now that brings me to my next point as well.
00:19:46.660 - 00:20:25.384, Speaker B: It's incredibly fast. Unlike other L2 and high speed dexs, you don't actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore. And as an additional point, by using Starkware, DyDX also provides users with increased security and privacy. And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature, which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so many different sub accounts. And their IoFS mobile app is also live right now. And it's amazing because it's compatible with Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Coin 98, Huawei wallet, and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there. And it's available for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today.
00:20:25.384 - 00:20:50.414, Speaker B: And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions, the most recent tier in the ten $10,000 equity tier, have won over $95,000 in rewards. And you can get started with as low as $500 in equity to compete for prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DYDX exchange to learn more. And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:20:52.354 - 00:21:27.774, Speaker A: And it's so interesting, this point about a almost decentrally created lore, right, where you have an organic community form around seeds that are planted by, say, a team. In this case, in this case, you guys planting the seeds for these VBA players. But then the lore is really created by the community as they create more artwork around it. And I think that was really the, I guess, the moonshot case for a lot of metaverse projects, right? They want the community to come in and build out their storylines for them. And we see this in projects like loot as well. I think that was one of the earlier experiments. And are you starting to see signs of that happen for VPA, or is that a little bit too early right now?
00:21:29.264 - 00:22:15.874, Speaker D: We've seen some of it, and a lot of it we're trying to encourage as best we can. Like, two examples of this are a lot of users are just creating backstories for their players. Like, hey, this is, I don't know if you guys ever watched the tv show Caillou as a kid, but basically there's this bald character that somebody got it, hey, this is grown caillou, who grew up playing in the VBA. Or there was this guy, and he was like, hey, this guy shattered both of his kneecaps, couldn't play professional in the NBA, and then he joined the VBA to compete in the virtual sense. So that's been really cool to see. And so we've been really trying to foster the community who comes up with these things by making sure that we reward them and sort of elevate them in terms of, like, what they do. The second thing that I'm, like, really bullish on is, like, having some sort of, like, sponsored league journalism.
00:22:15.874 - 00:22:51.172, Speaker D: A great example of this is, like, Zed run had this thing for a little bit called the Zed Gazette, right? And this was just like a newsletter that somebody was writing about, like, you know, what was happening within the horse races and what was happening in the ecosystem. And the other day, we were doing, like, a Twitter spaces, and there's this guy in our community named Sean who, like, creates his own content. And we were like, hey, you should become like the Stephen A. Smith of the VBA. And Stephen A. Smith is this, like, you know, this, like, sports personality and ESPN who's, like, really popular. And so it's like, okay, well, what can we do to help? Like, give this, like, sean a platform basically to become the Stephen A.
00:22:51.172 - 00:23:03.464, Speaker D: Smith of the VBA. And then all of a sudden, like, that is like a full on job, right? Like he can monetize that and he can create his own bread identity around that. And like we see that, like this empowerment of creators around the VBA is a really core part of our mission.
00:23:03.924 - 00:23:17.194, Speaker A: And how did you get to that point? So obviously when you guys first started, you know, there was nothing and then you guys built it up. How did you guys grow the community to the point where you started to see these organic creators come in and want to contribute to the lore for, you know, almost nothing in return?
00:23:17.614 - 00:24:03.598, Speaker D: Yeah, right now it's very early, so these people are very far in view between as contacts for people. Like I think we've about, we sold about 1600 packs in the alpha sale for people and this was because we wanted to do a small group of early believers to make sure that like we could work out like the right game modes and the concepts for people before we grew it bigger. And for now, basically what we've just been doing is like, I guess just being highly involved as a team in the discord. Like, I don't know how many discord communities people are in, but if you join a lot of them, you don't see the team that active all the time. Right. You see a lot of mods in there. And I think something that we've done pretty well is like, make sure that myself, my co founder, like the engineers working on the game are in there chatting with the community and listening to their ideas.
00:24:03.598 - 00:24:19.874, Speaker D: Because I think like, one of the more important things here is making sure that people feel like they're listened to and that like, if they do suggest something that they have power to impact the community and the product. And so we want to make sure that people who join the VBA feel that way so that throughout the process we can continue to get better together and grow that way.
00:24:20.294 - 00:24:59.034, Speaker A: Yeah, and thinking back to DeFi Summer as well, this was really the key differentiator for successful projects where the founders always hanging out with the community. It feels like the founder is part of the community and the founder is the person who's spending the most time in the discord with the fellow DJ's. So that, that's been really exciting to see for you guys as well. And I know you guys just did your season zero mint. I think on the 23 March as well, there was 3672 player packs in season zero and you guys released, I think, about 1600 of those. So what were some of the major kind of lessons from that first drop and how will future drops differ from the first one?
00:24:59.374 - 00:26:18.038, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I have a lot of lessons where I think we could have definitely done better on two things, I'll say that I think held us back a little bit were one, are actually the things that I think went well first, actually is like, you know, we sold, like, we sold like, a large amount of packs within like, a 30 minutes window, and we saw the flys, the floor price basically, like three x in the first day and sort of maintained that level since then. And so that felt really good to see, like, a lot of people who were whitelisted go out and mint the product, have the public sale, basically go perform well, and then have the people who bought it, beholders, actually, and not flippers. I think there were never more than, like, 100 listed at one time because the people who had bought them actually wanted to play the game itself. The downside of this is that it wasn't a super hyped project going into the Mint. Right. Like, one of the things that, like, I had always been really careful about was, you know, I want to make sure that throughout the white listing process or the Mint listing process, that we only got people who are passionate about basketball or fantasy sports or sports gambling or sports betting. And I think what ended up happening for that is, like, we didn't really do a great job attracting that investor class, to your point earlier, right.
00:26:18.038 - 00:26:57.196, Speaker D: I think a core part of NFTs is you have to attract this investor class who sees that they can make ROI doing this. And as a result of that, we had to resort to some interesting mechanisms as part of our mint. So this is one thing that I think we did that felt kind of unique, which is there's two ways to create a lot of demand pressure for a project. One of them is basically knowing that there's going to be 20 or 30,000 people minting at the same time. So you want to rush and then the network gets congested. The other way to do this is create time pressure. So we did our mint using, like, time pressure and that, like, you know, we said, you know, in 30 minutes, if we don't mint out, everything that doesn't mint in that time period was burned.
00:26:57.196 - 00:27:25.522, Speaker D: And so that's why you see this number of, like, 3672 is. We said, hey, we're going to mint 2000 packs in this first part of season zero. And we sold 1672. And so basically after 30 minutes, we burned the next 300. And what was cool about this, actually, is that there were folks who were like, oh, I really wanted to mint, but I couldn't. And as a result of that, that's why we saw such a strong floor price afterwards is because there was that demand still that for folks who had missed the window, that's a really clever.
00:27:25.578 - 00:27:57.944, Speaker A: Mechanism because you see this in, even outside of nfts with public sales, if the public sale is way too massive, the price just does not perform and it kills a lot of morale early. But I guess on the point about hype as well, I noticed that for a lot of projects that maybe sustain a lot of hype in the beginning, it also tends to simmer down very, very quickly as well, whereas the things that last tend to be things that could grow slowly. Awareness. So how do you guys balance between, you know, how hard do you want to push the hype for the project versus, you know, how I guess, quote unquote organic, you want the growth to be?
00:27:58.364 - 00:28:54.022, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a fantastic question. And the way that I worry about this a little bit, I used to worry about this a lot, actually. I think the more I've thought about it, the more I felt better about my answer to this question, which is basically like, you know, what do I need to do as a builder to feel like I can go to sleep at night? And even if this business doesn't work out, which obviously I hope it works out fantastically for myself and all the community is like, will I be able to look them in the eye and look like my friends and family in the eye afterwards? Right. And to me a lot of that is just like, I want to set reasonable expectations for people because I think when you have a project like moonbirds, for example, right, like super hyped on ETH and at some point it was what? Like the floor price was like 40 ETH right afterwards. Right. Like you have to imagine almost like, what does the utility of that project or what does that need to become for it to live up to that value? Right. Like they think they raised like 60 or $70 million in the first day or something like that.
00:28:54.022 - 00:29:15.074, Speaker D: And it was like, you know, what do you need to build to live up to that? Whereas for us it's like, you know, we wanted to make sure that whatever milestone that, like, we made, we were able to feel like we could deliver on it and make sure that the community's expectations were met. And we think that in the long run, if we keep doing it slowly this way, that, well build something that's long term sustainable and just have something that's sort of slow and steady growth.
00:29:15.614 - 00:29:58.582, Speaker A: Yeah. And what I really, really like about what you guys are building is that unlike a lot of NFT profile picture projects, which is really just a profile picture, and they make some memes around it, which I think it has its own place. You guys really thought from first principles about how NFTs can enable better gameplay by enabling ownership and not just trying to create profile pictures for nothing. So I think that the heavy focus on first principles and utility is something that really, really sets you guys apart. And on that note, when it comes to utility, obviously you're wading into the arena with not just web3 games, but also web two games. So how do you see VBA competing against maybe web two fantasy sports over the next say, decade or so?
00:29:58.768 - 00:31:06.178, Speaker D: Yeah. The first branding I actually had for VBA was fantasy fantasy sports, right? Where it's, if you look at like current fantasy sports, it's, you know, you bet on games where real players are playing and their stat lines sort of impact your earnings, right? This is restricted to very much like, reality in the sense that like, LeBron James isn't going to play every single day. Tom Brady is only going to play once a week on Sunday, right? And one of the cool things that the Metaverse allows is, you know, you could have your star player, the VBA, play every single day. You can have them play five games a day, right? And so, like, this allows us to open up like ten x 100 x different, like, entertainment opportunities because the frequency is going to be there. The downside of this, obviously, is that it's not tied to this like large, larger than life brand like LeBron or Tom Brady. But we think that like, if we're able to do it right with the community, and this is a big if, right, that like, we're able to create something that's very compelling, that people will feel is just as real as, like real life. And that's like some people's definition of metaverse, right? Is, you know, we want the metaverse to be a place where the virtual world feels as compelling as like the IRL world.
00:31:06.346 - 00:31:13.854, Speaker A: Hmm. And I guess on the kind of boring business question, how do you guys, you know, how do you guys generate revenue for the VBA company?
00:31:14.514 - 00:31:51.506, Speaker D: So four ways here, some of them are sustainable, some of them are not sustainable. I think, like, the four obvious ways are, um, primary sales of nfts not sustainable. You can't keep minting things, um, secondary revenue on nfts, um, somewhat sustainable, but probably not long term. Uh, the third way that I think this is going to be our big bet this summer is, um, taking an entry fee in competitions. So having like paid entry competitions where people can play like skill based competitions for higher. For higher stakes and then taking like a small fee there. And so then our goal is like, let's create as compelling of a gameplay as possible so that we can maximize that.
00:31:51.506 - 00:32:18.984, Speaker D: And that feels very incentive aligned with users. Right. We want to create a game that people like because that's mutually beneficial for everybody. And then four is ideally the VBA becomes big enough and we can start bringing an external capital in the ecosystem. And I think a lot of people have been talking about this for web3 games is like, if you can bring sponsorships or external capital into the game itself, then you can afford to pay the community more because you have somebody who is just there for those eyeballs versus having an economy that's solely circularly driven.
00:32:19.524 - 00:32:33.504, Speaker A: And speaking of circularly driven, how strongly do you feel about having a major play to earn element in VBA where players play these games to earn, say, VBA tokens? Is that a core part of the roadmap? And how do you think about that?
00:32:34.244 - 00:33:25.824, Speaker D: This we're being super careful about because we've been trying to stay as far away from play to earn and play and earn branding. At some point, I think we had, like, ball and earn as, like, as a statement, but I really wanted to get rid of that. And the reason why is, I think, like, once it gets branded in this, like, play to earn or brand to earn or ball and earn or move to earn category, I think it's hard for the user to separate like, fun from like, the ROI that's expected. Right. And so we always want to set the expectation that, like, this is something that we wanted to make that was fun, driven first and then basically, like, earning second. It's the same way as, like, if you think about like a fantasy sports game today, like, you know, you can play DF's on Fanduel or Draftkings, they don't call it anything like play and earn because effectively it is play and earn, right? Like, you play fantasy and like, if you perform well, you. You do earn money.
00:33:25.824 - 00:33:38.424, Speaker D: It's just like, this is fantasy sports, right? And so that's the sort of way that we want to brand. This is like, you know, we don't want to explicitly call it that, but we want to make sure that there are ways for people who perform well to sort of like, earn within the economy.
00:33:38.884 - 00:33:43.464, Speaker A: Yeah. And just to clarify on that point, actually, where will the earnings come from for winning teams?
00:33:43.924 - 00:34:29.534, Speaker D: Yeah. So the non sustainable way is like the free entry competitions, right, where we actually allocated 100% of our mint to prizes because like as you mentioned earlier, like we're venture backed in the sense that like we raised money from angels like yourself and VC's to make sure that we could build up the team. And so all the mint revenue basically we just allocated back to prizes because it's the community's money. And then how we're going to do it sustainably is do paid entry competitions for the most part where people have to pay on top of their nfts basically to compete with them, sort of how Zedron does it. And then basically take a portion of those earnings to reinvest in free to play contests to attract new users and grow that way.
00:34:29.874 - 00:34:38.232, Speaker A: And in terms of the gameplay mechanics, who gets to decide which team wins? Is it kind of a automated, um, simulation or does, does the team kind.
00:34:38.248 - 00:35:14.904, Speaker D: Of decide, um, it'll be automated in the sense that we've, um. Actually our good friend Scott actually has built most of this, is we've built like a game simulator where we take into account all the attributes of the players, um, and then probability, basically to determine like what the outcome of any given play is. And then basically if you sum up like 100 plays during the course of basketball game or 48 minutes, basically that's the output of the game. And so the gameplay experience when you play against another team is sort of you watching this play by play in like a live action format, similar to how you would watch like an ESPN play by a player box score go by.
00:35:15.324 - 00:36:03.894, Speaker A: Yeah, I really love that as well because I'm of the view that, you know, simple gameplay can bring in a lot of players. But if you have a simple gameplay with added complexity where, you know, your casual players can still partake, but then you have expert players who can go a layer deeper and, you know, kind of go all moneyball on this, I think there's a lot longer longevity to types of games like that. And poker, I think is a great example of this. Poker is a very simple game. Anyone can play poker, but to get good at poker you require true dedication and expertise. And I feel like there is that aspect here to VBA where casual players, I can just buy a bunch of the NFTs and participate in these games, or I can really go ham and just calculate the probabilities based on the stat of each player and try to really win each game. Are you starting to see those different profiles of players like power players and casual players?
00:36:05.194 - 00:36:52.424, Speaker D: I hope we start to see it once we launch. So we're launching in June, so only a few weeks away at this point, and I think we'll start to see separation when we launch multiple different game modes. This is why I'm really bullish on multiple different game modes and sort of a platform play in the sense that, you know, we build the VBA as a platform and then basically you can create all different types of games on top of it. Another way that's really interesting that this could go is, you know, people taking the nfts and building like a modded game on top of it. Right? Like three, V three. Like if people are really liking the VBA nfts, like it's success to us that other people want to build like the big three for the VBA, where there's three on three games happening with the same assets. That's one of the advantages of the ecosystem and we want to make sure that devs and other people who are passionate about it take advantage of that.
00:36:53.144 - 00:37:11.504, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I guess on that note about this upcoming launch, what can users expect from the June launch and what can they expect from future releases? Are the drops going to have different types of players in the future? Can they breed players? Maybe? What are some kind of new gameplay mechanics that people can expect?
00:37:11.664 - 00:38:01.602, Speaker D: Yeah, so v zero that we're shipping in June is going to be just the franchise weekly mode, basically through July and August. We'll just be making sure that we do a lot of iteration on that. So making sure that people can scout players by perhaps revealing attributes, altering almost the salary cap and the different rules within the game. And the purpose of this month long period is just to make sure that we work out the kinks in the first product. The thing that our team is starting on next really is this arcade mode that I've mentioned where we want to be able to support multiple different formats and then basically start doing paid entry competitions afterwards. At that point, then there's a couple of different ways that we can take this. One thing that we're pretty excited about is the concept of training, where we want to introduce progression so that we can go to season one and say, okay, season one, your players have gotten better or worse.
00:38:01.602 - 00:39:05.012, Speaker D: And on top of that, you as an owner can start thinking about how I want to allocate training points to make my players better in certain categories. And then the second thing that, but I'm still trying to think through this, is what would it look like for us to create utility for all pfps and projects that are nfts? This is the idea. If there's Azuki's and bored apes around the Solana ecosystem. There's d gods, there's sets on crack, there's Catalina whales, whatever. What can we do to basically turn those nfts into basketball players so that there's no friction anymore for them to buy a VBA NFT to get started, but they can use their own NFT, convert it into like a very low level VBA asset, train it up using like our tokens or in game currency, and then use that asset to compete in competition. Because nobody's really working on this thing of like, how can I create generalized utility for all pfps that exist in the market today? And we know that the PFTP market cap is like insanely large because there's so many projects that there's a lot of users in this category that like, are looking for something to do with their projects that they've invested in.
00:39:05.198 - 00:39:19.896, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think projects will be extremely open to this, but every project, every PFP project out there is looking to add some utility to them. So it'd be cool to see bored apes playing in a VBA game against Azuki's, for instance. I think that would be the Metaverse dream, right?
00:39:20.080 - 00:39:40.644, Speaker D: Yes. That's something that we've talked to a handful of top projects on Solana doing later this year is having a tournament where maybe it's 16 teams, maybe it's 30 teams of the top Solana projects. Basically convert a handful of their players into nfts and have them compete, which is both good for growth and also helps bring community on Solana together.
00:39:41.144 - 00:39:52.640, Speaker A: Yeah, most definitely. And I think as we're coming up on time as well, I want to make sure that our listeners know where to check out VBA once the launch comes. So when can they expect the launch to be, and where should they go to check it out?
00:39:52.832 - 00:40:14.366, Speaker D: Yeah, thank you, man. So thanks for bringing that up because I would have never shilled it myself. Uh, we're hoping to launch the first version of this game around mid June this year. Uh, and then basically the best place to go is either our Twitter, which is our Twitter handle, isbagame, or our website, which is just www.vbagame.com.
00:40:14.550 - 00:40:22.874, Speaker A: Awesome. And we'll have those in the show notes below. So once again, thank you so much for coming on, Charles. This has been really fun to learn more about what you guys have been up to, and I'm really excited to check out the game.
00:40:23.534 - 00:40:25.654, Speaker D: Yeah, thank you so much for having me, Jason. Appreciate it, man.
