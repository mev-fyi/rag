00:00:00.160 - 00:00:05.094, Speaker A: This is the first fair launch with an actual product that is venture backed as well. So I thought this was very interesting to me.
00:00:05.134 - 00:00:07.678, Speaker B: Web Three offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:07.726 - 00:00:09.526, Speaker A: Our jobs to buy great tech at great prices.
00:00:09.590 - 00:00:12.190, Speaker B: AI is also libertarian right enable use.
00:00:12.222 - 00:01:03.802, Speaker A: Case that people haven't been able to do today. The next hundreds of millions of players, they will come to the market through mobile. My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next twelve months is hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, I took a week off for the first time in two years since I started Tangent about a year and a half ago. And when I came back, there was a massive, massive token launch called Friendtech. And suddenly everybody's talking about this project and everybody's talking about social fi and crypto again. So I thought today, for today's Roundtable episode with Sanad, we're going to do a episode that focuses on all of the social apps that we've come across recently, what's happening with them, what our thoughts on them, and what actually constitutes a successful social app.
00:01:03.802 - 00:01:24.140, Speaker A: So it's pretty much a free form discussion and I'm very excited to have my trusty co host here, Sanad. And before we start, obviously nothing we discuss is financial advice and everything we discuss is our own personal opinions and not reflective of our respective companies. And we may have exposure to assets we discussed and we try to disclose those. So, sadat, first of all, did you get a frantic airdrop?
00:01:24.252 - 00:01:40.940, Speaker B: I did. I got a very small one because I definitely stopped playing with the app at some point. I claimed it. I'm not even sure what it's worth because the app crashed as soon as I claimed it and I haven't really tried to use it. Then I've been meaning to try out clubs, but I haven't joined one yet. Have you joined a club or created one?
00:01:41.092 - 00:02:29.934, Speaker A: I have basically been just running my own chat where people buy keys and access the chats, but then they have this, like I said, they have this new club feature where you can basically start a club with three different types of curves. So I guess taking a step back here for people who are not aware of what frantic is, it's basically an app that allows you to join paid groups. You buy these keys belonging to personalities in crypto on Twitter or whatever. And after you pay for these keys, you can access a group chat and you can have chats with people who are otherwise maybe very hard to access. It's a pretty useful gating tool for people with a lot of following. But the common critique for version one was that because the keys are priced on the bonding curve, it gets to the exponential part of the bonding curve very quickly. Once you have 20 people in a group, the keys start getting so expensive.
00:02:29.934 - 00:03:02.790, Speaker A: For v two, they pushed out two other types of curves. Basically a more casual curve where you can have 50 people and the price will still be reasonable. There's a standard curve where it gets a little bit more exclusive, you know, up to 30 people and then exclusive where you have ten people, and then after that it gets super exclusive. So I haven't joined, I haven't started my own club yet, but I did join one, which is called good Gamma. It's from a options trader on Twitter. I always really enjoy their takes. So yeah, I'm just in there just hanging out.
00:03:02.790 - 00:03:17.818, Speaker A: But I did also get an airdrop and I actually started buying some friend token after I came back from my break as well. But yeah. What are your overall thoughts on what's going on in frontech or kind of in the social vertical for now?
00:03:17.946 - 00:04:14.676, Speaker B: I think specifically on Friendtech. I think the most interesting thing about Friendtech is definitely the way the token was distributed. I think particularly given that we're in a market where, and we're both obviously partially responsible for this, but basically we see a bunch of tokens launching that increasingly have higher and higher insider allocations and it feels like we spend so much energy, particularly people who are trading in the liquid market, thinking through token unlocks and thinking through who's going to vest and when are they going to sell. And there's like this constant who's going to dump on who kind of dynamic to the conversation. And that's why I think it is in a long time, I don't think we've seen like a fairly distributed app token. And given that dynamic, I'm super, super curious to see how it plays out and whether it's just like such an interesting counterfactual to all of the kind of tokens that have 30% to 40% insider allocations. And I'm curious to see whether there's like meaningfully different price action.
00:04:14.676 - 00:04:16.780, Speaker B: Is that part of what got you excited to buy it?
00:04:16.852 - 00:04:43.142, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by YGG. I'm very excited to announce that we're partnering with Yield Guild Games to bring you today's episode. You may remember YGG as the leading guild in web3 that helped drive the success of games like Axie, Infinity and Pixels, but they actually have bigger ambitions than just that. I've really enjoyed co investing with and also learning all about gaming from their founder, Gabby Dezan, throughout the years. So here is Gabby to tell us all about how YGG has helped games succeed before.
00:04:43.278 - 00:05:36.418, Speaker C: YGG is evolving into a guild protocol. So don't think of us as a guild. Think of us as a platform that scales guilds of all sizes, which means that we provide the foundation infrastructure for guilds to scale, do different kinds of quests that can earn them crypto and have them own assets. And right now, the majority of this is still in play to earn games, but there's now different kinds of work that you can do in crypto that can earn you money. Think of what YGG is doing as a combination of Uber and LinkedIn. People are self organizing into groups and then finding opportunities in web3 that can not only earn them crypto, but they gain reputation in the form of badges and soul bound nfts, which allows them to build up a reputation on things that they've done well in contributing to different protocols.
00:05:36.506 - 00:06:05.904, Speaker A: And now back to the episode. Yeah, I mean, this was the first token where, like, the team doesn't have any tokens, right? Like investor tokens, I think were, like, canceled. So they basically just airdropped everything out. So this is, since YFI, the first kind of true fair launch. And this is also, I mean, there's been some fair launch in, like, small cap meme coins, but this is the first fair launch with an actual product that is venture backed as well. So I thought this was very interesting to me. So it listed at like $10, dropped all the way to like 150, and it just started buying some there.
00:06:05.904 - 00:06:35.078, Speaker A: And because I bought on my public wallet, people were, like, tracking and started tagging me and then started kind of looping me into these friend groups. But I didn't mean to kind of be so visible, but I was just personal. I was just buying my personal wallet. It's not even like a fun wallet or anything like that. And I was just on my break on the beach just, like, clicking buy because I thought it made no sense for this thing to be trading at where it was. But we can dive into, like, the token later. I want to kind of zoom out a little bit first to talk about web3 social, because I feel like before this, there.
00:06:35.078 - 00:06:58.054, Speaker A: Before this year, there was really no social fi category, right. There were some people who were throwing this term around. I mean, before that, some people called it web3 social. And then forecaster kind of officially pushed, started the kind of web3 social narrative but I guess to you, what exactly is web3 social? Is it even real vertical? Or is it just another kind of weird narrative that people are trying to push?
00:06:58.174 - 00:08:03.818, Speaker B: I like web3 consumer a little more, particularly if you're going to start including stuff like fantasy top. I have a kind of maybe bearish forecaster generally take, but my take is that if you have consumer app, like, if there's a consumer app, and consumer apps are really largely built on features, particularly ones that have some social. And if you have an app where the core feature kind of relies on crypto, and in fact, you couldn't really envision this app existing without crypto, then that's my favorite definition of web3 social or web3 consumer. This is also why. And forecast has changed a lot since Degen has come out and there's all this tipping happening. But this is also why initially, I thought Forecaster was kind of lame because it's just like Twitter, except with a decentralized backend, which is pretty irrelevant to the product experience and why I've always been much more excited by the steel cams and friend techs and fantasy tops and to some degree, the pump funds of this world versus just far costa. But I know forecast has changed a lot, and this is my definition.
00:08:03.818 - 00:08:12.066, Speaker B: It feels like you have to have a core product feature that is bringing people there be like something that you can't imagine happening without crypto being super.
00:08:12.210 - 00:08:35.576, Speaker A: Super crypto native can just be like skeuomorphic. It can just be like Twitter or Facebook, but on a blockchain. Because I know I use this example a lot because I think it's very emblematic of so many social fi experiments. But peep eth, right? Back in 2018, some guy just built a Twitter clone on chain. Like, every action was on chain. And yeah, I think those are not that exciting. And I shared the same thoughts.
00:08:35.576 - 00:09:06.998, Speaker A: Right when I first look at Forecaster, I was like, okay, this is just a Twitter clone. I signed up, like, two years ago, but then I just never really used it because I didn't see a lot of differentiation from Twitter. I got a lot more engagement on Twitter. There's a lot more interesting content on Twitter. I think it really changed when they introduced this feature called frames, which is basically allowing you to engage on chain with a wallet within the feed itself. So imagine you're scrolling through Twitter and then there's literally, instead of a, like button, there's like a mint button for like a new coin. You just click and you mint.
00:09:06.998 - 00:09:49.608, Speaker A: So it's a seamless experience for like crypto natives to use this app. So it kind of makes sense that their user numbers actually started going pretty crazy. And we're going to go through this in a bit. But I think Forecaster is the only web3 consumer social application where you have a chart like this. There was a massive, massive hype cycle in the beginning and usually you lose like half your users, if not more, and you never come back from that. And then they launched this frames thing that allowed everyone to kind of go and mint coins. And a lot of people started tipping each other on forecaster with this token that is technically not issued by the forecaster team, but it's like a third party token called Degen, which I have some as well, but people just use it as a tipping currency.
00:09:49.608 - 00:10:30.906, Speaker A: And then once those two things came along, the users started to climb again. So now they're actually near all time high users for about 45,000 to 50,000 daily active users. So my assumption is there's probably addressable market of about less than 100,000 users for crypto natives in terms of daily active users now. So they basically tapped a big chunk of their market already. So that's quite exciting. But you also mentioned Steelycam, and I remember you were the first person in my entire circle to ever talk about Steely Cam and frantech and racer before everybody started simping for this racer guy. So give us the context there, man.
00:10:30.906 - 00:10:33.182, Speaker A: How did you discover this thing and what is it?
00:10:33.378 - 00:11:20.794, Speaker B: I mean, I was following Racer because in my view he is the best shit poster that CT has ever seen in the history of CT. And he released this thing called Steelcam. And what attracted me to it was exactly the thing I mentioned earlier where it was like the silly app where you would take a picture, it would get minted as an NFT and you could steal it from, and someone could steal it from you, and then someone else could steal it from them. And only the person who currently owns it or had stolen it last can see it and it's kind of blurred to everyone else. And then there's a little bit of a Ponzi game where if someone steals it from you, then you get the money back that you spent stealing it. And if someone steals it from them, then you get a little bit of profit. So there is like a little bit of speculation involved.
00:11:20.794 - 00:11:56.654, Speaker B: And it was mostly what was happening was a bunch of extremely online cd characters would take a picture and be like, haha, this is a dick pic. And then someone would steal it and be like, yeah, massive dick. Just stupid shit like that. But again, the reason I liked it a lot was that, like, it had a very small period of hyper growth and it took over the timeline. But most importantly, it was like, you can't imagine this app existing without crypto. It's like, so crypto native. The stealing, the little bit of Ponzi, the little bit of financialization, little bit of fun taking over the Twitter timeline.
00:11:56.654 - 00:12:26.134, Speaker B: And so the reason I liked it is that the core feature was very, very crypto native. And so that got me excited. And I kind of, like, was pretty bullish, even at that point. I was like, okay. Even the ability to kind of create a small parabola in consumer with an extremely crypto native feature set was what got me excited. I still have a bunch of, like, pictures that I've stolen from people. I don't know if, you know, shlooms, the, like, kind of offbeat artist.
00:12:26.134 - 00:12:31.990, Speaker B: I've stolen a few of his. He has this weird Gary Gensler thing that he made that only I can see. So if anyone wants to steal it.
00:12:32.142 - 00:12:34.910, Speaker A: So only the owner can see the picture?
00:12:35.022 - 00:12:36.950, Speaker B: Yes. You have to steal it if you want to see it.
00:12:37.022 - 00:12:40.246, Speaker A: So you have a wallet somewhere with a bunch of private dick pics, basically, yes.
00:12:40.310 - 00:12:45.902, Speaker B: Yes. And if you need. If you really want to see them, you have to steal them. Sorry, guys.
00:12:46.078 - 00:12:49.590, Speaker A: Is this still life? Is steelycamp still available now? Like, you can still play around with it?
00:12:49.622 - 00:12:54.318, Speaker B: Haven't tried to turn it on in months, but I imagine they wouldn't have shut the app down.
00:12:54.486 - 00:13:02.014, Speaker A: So racer, basically, he didn't really pivot, right? He started ceilicamp first, and then he started fintech. And that's like, his main thing now.
00:13:02.134 - 00:13:09.542, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think Steelcam was, like, one app they tried kind of worked, but really didn't take off in a big way. And then they launched Frontec.
00:13:09.598 - 00:13:34.548, Speaker A: And when you say crypto native, right, you're really talking about, like, speculative elements, because even for forecaster, before they have the crypto native element, it was, like, too similar to Twitter from the user perspective until they added the frames thing and people started minting all these new coins, and that was very much speculation. So are there crypto native aspects to social applications in crypto that are not related to speculation that you've seen before that that actually worked out?
00:13:34.676 - 00:14:19.914, Speaker B: They exist, but I think they're kind of irrelevant, which is to say that I think, and I think a lot of people believe this, but really, crypto shines when there's some value being transferred, when there's some notion of digital scarcity. That's interesting. There are obviously a whole bunch of people who, like, the initial pitch for forecaster was that, look, the backend is decentralized, so you'll always have access to your data, you'll always have access to your identity or id is posted on ethereum, and other people can build front end. So it's kind of like. And there's a couple of other social apps I've seen where they post all the data to like, arweave or something. I just inherently find that concept kind of uninteresting, I think, like, I just don't care when I'm using Twitter about whether the backend is decentralized or not. Like, it just doesn't feel like it matters enough.
00:14:19.914 - 00:14:45.048, Speaker B: And it suffers from the same kind of problems that crypto privacy does, where users don't care enough as much as, like, developers do. And so I think there are a bunch of people who try and say, look, we need to, like, give users access to their data. We need to make it like, we need to decentralize the backend. We need to make sure anyone can launch a feed based on top of your posts, and you can always take your post history with you. And I'm personally very bad at all that stuff. I don't know how you feel.
00:14:45.216 - 00:15:10.446, Speaker A: Yeah, because it feels like an imagined problem that people are trying to solve. Right. Because the initial pitch for web3 social is actually not what it is today. Currently, it's like, okay, we will allow someone that has asian, some money games, some speculation within your app. But before this, it was like, we got to take back control of our data from Facebook. And if your data is ever monetized, we want to give you a cut of it. That was like the utopian dream of decentralized social.
00:15:10.446 - 00:15:53.136, Speaker A: I feel like that was very much driven by founders and not driven by the market. This is something that sounds really good on paper, but I think one big event that actually made me very skeptical of that thesis was delete Facebook. I don't remember delete Facebook movement, but basically after the whole Cambridge Analytica thing back in 2021, there was a movement called Delete Facebook, where everybody is calling for boycotting of Facebook. But then you look at Instagram growth, which is part of the meta company, you look at Facebook user growth, it really hasn't really made a dent. So my view is that most people using these apps don't really give a shit. They are a little bit scared. They're a little bit creeped out.
00:15:53.136 - 00:16:29.318, Speaker A: Sometimes if the person or data is leaked, but for the most part, it's not going to be enough for you to be like, oh, shit, we got to start a new movement to do this. People are drawn to applications because they want to connect with people because maybe they can make some money on it. And I think it's taken the past two years for web3 social to actually figure that angle out and to come to this point, which is how we have forecaster, with its relatively big daily active user base for crypto app today. And then we have frontech taking off as well. But I'd like to dive into the specifics. We talked about forecaster a bit. We talked about Friendtech a bit.
00:16:29.318 - 00:16:40.574, Speaker A: There are some that are quasi social that I know you're familiar with as well. There's one called fantasy top. There's also one called pump fun. Have you spent much time on fantasy top?
00:16:41.394 - 00:17:31.793, Speaker B: I did play it for a few weeks. I also want to make a disclosure. Our fund is an investor, so I like fantasy top a lot. I think it's, you know, the reason I think it's interesting is that there is a core set of users who are dangerously addicted to crypto Twitter. Like, they spend far too much time on crypto Twitter. The core premise of fantasy top for those who haven't played the game at all, is that effectively it's a trading card game or like a fantasy card game, kind of like fantasy football, where you pick a bunch of players every week to make your team, except the players are characters on CD and your winnings are proportional to how much engagement those players got or those CD characters got. And cards vary in rarity and price, and they can be traded based on people's perception of how much engagement someone is going to get over the week.
00:17:31.793 - 00:18:02.274, Speaker B: And so again, the reason I think it's always interesting is that, like, they've already shown an ability to get a consumer parabola and that people are excited. A bunch of people are playing, a bunch of people are tweeting about this. There's a bunch of people who already made a bunch of money, which is always a good sign that all these tweets from people saying, oh, I, like, put 0.1 eth in, I now have four, five eth. Yeah, exactly. This. Like, someone started with two eth, they now have a seven ETH portfolio, plus they got some blast gold, plus they'll get some airdrop.
00:18:02.274 - 00:18:37.014, Speaker B: And I think that's one sign that it's working. And the other sign, which is truly chaotic, is that if you look in the replies of a bunch of big CD characters now, particularly those who have cards. There's so many people saying, hey, man, you aren't tweeting like, you're on my team this week and you need to be tweeting, you need to be getting engagement. And so I think that's already an amazing signal. I think we kind of, when someone gets a consumer behavior working, we tend to like always be naysayers. But I think really, there are like three, four apps in history that have at least taken over the timeline for two, three weeks. People are having fun.
00:18:37.014 - 00:19:24.888, Speaker B: The chaos has been unleashed. The only thing I think that will be a challenge for them, and I know the team is working very hard on is making sure that they can kind of avoid botting and other kind of issues that mess with the engagement metrics. So I think the craziest thing I saw was that someone was telling me privately that someone else bought them 2000 followers because they owned their card. And so can you imagine like someone else buying you followers because they own your cards? So I think basically, as long as they're able to kind of figure that part out, it remains super interesting. And this is another thing where a lot of people have told me that Tam is so small, it's only crypto traders, and I think it's like kind of related to what we spoke about earlier. One, I think you can just kind of belong degeneracy. You can just be long.
00:19:24.888 - 00:20:03.286, Speaker B: The idea that there will be more crypto Twitter users, there will be more people coming in buying meme coins, paying attention to this stuff. And so just being long degeneracy is pretty interesting. And something I want to touch on later as well is just the idea that you can make a lot of revenue from these things. So, like, Facebook's average revenue per user, I think is still like something like $12 a quarter. And sure, like they have $3 billion. They have 3 billion users, which makes them an extremely, extremely valuable company. But there is a way in which like friend made $25 million, which is a very substantial sum of money off of what you, as you pointed out, is like at max 100k user base.
00:20:03.286 - 00:20:19.064, Speaker B: And so I think you do kind of have to use a different rental model when it comes to monetization of these things. Generally, I'm pretty excited about fantasy top. I think they have some challenges, but just that ability to take over the timeline and seeing a whole bunch of people having fun is a very bullish signal, I think.
00:20:19.484 - 00:21:11.392, Speaker A: I think the monetization front is massively under discussed as well. Because I don't think in web two there's ever an example where a social app, before achieving literally millions of daily active users, can monetize to the extent that these guys have front hack, doesn't have that many users. But they've already generated what? Yeah, in the past three days, they've generated half a million dollars in fees from trading of the friend token within their own UI and also trading of the keys. So this is something that I think is uniquely crypto native as well, just allowing social apps to monetize quickly. So that is, that also fits into kind of the point about kind of VC ownership that you mentioned, because these apps can monetize so early on, they might not even need to, you know, massively dilute their own token supply by selling to investors. And that feeds into the community owned kind of angle as well. And just on fantasy top as well.
00:21:11.392 - 00:21:49.010, Speaker A: Yeah, I get a lot of those tweets, like every day someone tags me and say, hey, Jason, tweet something, man. And it's pretty wild that I think in the past month, right. I think my follower count has fluctuated by thousands every day, up and down, up and down. So there are definitely people buying followers for me and then engagement wise on every post, like, I'm not complaining because the engagement is going on, you know, off the roof, but there are a lot of people who I think probably turn me on alerts just to retweet everything that I tweet out, regardless of what it is, because of fantasy top. So this is the first I've seen in crypto as well. And I'm quite excited about this because this doesn't require a behavioral change. There's no friction to onboarding.
00:21:49.010 - 00:22:24.336, Speaker A: I have been participating in fantasy top without being on fantasy top for the past few months just because I'm tweeting. And I only just started to kind of actually get on the platform, buy some cards. I bought a Tom Schmidt card as well because it seems like he's very active there. But I didn't need to actually engage in this platform for this to work. So it doesn't require massive uplift in terms of changing the behaviors of influencers to get the application to work. So I thought that was a huge point. I would contend that it's not really a social application because to me, a social application is where you socialize with others.
00:22:24.336 - 00:23:04.722, Speaker A: You get to interact with people, for this is more like a speculation market on another social app. So to me, the dream for this is actually not just, you can bet on social engagement for different Twitter influencers. You can use this to bet on YouTube influencers. You can use this to bet on any type of metric on any third party platform. So that is one of those things that allow crypto to really bridge over to web two without massive friction. I think these guys are onto something here. I'm still a little bit skeptical about how do they make this sustainable, because to my understanding, the engagement numbers on Twitter, you cannot really enforce the value of the cards you buy to the engagement numbers.
00:23:04.722 - 00:23:43.734, Speaker A: It's really more like an NFT where, okay, you think this guy is going to be popular, so I buy this, but there's no kind of price curve enforcing the popularity of me versus the value of my card. The only thing is the social points you accrue on fantasy top, which entitles you to an airdrop. So it's monetization by airdrop still, which is not sustainable, as we know, over the very long term. So I'm curious if these guys can figure something out. And that kind of is why I'm excited about Friendtech as well, because they actually enforce the value of the keys to how many people buy the keys by having an inbuilt bonding curve. But I understand there are trade offs, which we've talked about as well on the monetization stuff.
00:23:43.774 - 00:24:28.324, Speaker B: I don't know if you ever seen Olaf's tweet from two years ago that I just think think is turning out to be so much more prescient now, where he basically tweeted two years ago saying, instead of either paying for a product or investing for a return, many good business models in crypto are a combination. Users come for both the product experience and a chance that they'll make money. It's both and long term, this fun and maybe profit business model will replace the advertising business model for many online platforms. Replace ads with crypto, financial incentives and games. And I actually can't stop thinking about this tweet. I think it is very prescient. And this is kind of what a lot of the current crop of social founders are tapping into their understanding that people like spending time on platforms where they're having a little bit of fun.
00:24:28.324 - 00:24:39.908, Speaker B: They're kind of buying lottery tickets, or maybe there's a potential of making money. And the monetization that these apps have per user is so much greater than those of advertising funding apps.
00:24:39.956 - 00:25:37.712, Speaker A: This is interesting one. I'm just pulling up the tweet here for people who are watching this on YouTube. So, yeah, fun and maybe profit. It's interesting that OLAP was already talking about this like two years ago, but then, now we're actually starting to see it play off. And then I think I would add even kind of like trading or speculating speculation related profits into this as well, right? Because for fintech, if you think about it, they're not really monetizing the chats, right? You're not, you're not like the volume of your chats, the volume of engagement on the platform doesn't really affect their monetization too much directly, at least. It's how much friend token you're trading, how many keys you're buying and selling that is kind of affecting the monetization. And this was also a critique that I had about Friendtech early on, is it doesn't reward loyalty for users, it doesn't reward the same things that Facebook and Instagram are trying to target for.
00:25:37.712 - 00:26:08.382, Speaker A: So these companies, they target for KPI's like engagement retention, how much time you spend on the app. But for Friendtech, they are technically monetizing by volume of the keys. So when I buy a sanaa key, I join your chat, I'm in there engaging every day. They really just make money off of me. That one time I bought that key, the next time they make money from me is if I sell the key. So if I exit, exit your chat. So I think there is something that still needs to be figured out in terms of how incentivization works for some of these social apps.
00:26:08.382 - 00:26:25.754, Speaker A: But this is actually a massive leap from what was just available just maybe a year or two years ago, which I'm very, very excited about. Let's talk about pump fun as well. I know that's another one that you have looked into. What is this? And is this a social app as well?
00:26:26.254 - 00:26:53.962, Speaker B: Yeah. So pump fun is a platform to launch meme coins for some context. I think a lot of people don't actually know what it takes to launch a meme coin. So yes, you can just deploy a token contract and it costs very little. But realistically, you kind of have to put in some amount of liquidity, ideally between five to $10,000. The more the better. And then there's just a Dex cleaner page where there's a whole bunch of tokens launching.
00:26:53.962 - 00:27:48.336, Speaker B: So you may want to get some people to kind of start shilling your coin. There's a small fee you have to pay to Dex tools and Dex screener to kind of get your socials added. And so in a weird sense, like, it felt like we had democratized launching meme coins but they still required some amount of investment and some amount of kind of understanding the meta. So pump fun, in a funny way, really does truly democratize the launching of a meme coin. So you come on pump fun, and you have a meme, like a small picture and a token ticker, and you launch a coin and it costs like a pathetically small amount of money, like less than $10. I think you can do it on Solana, and then your coin gets added to a feed, which is really skid. So honestly, it's like, hard to, like, spending time on pump fun may break your brain because of how fast the homepage moves and other people get to buy or sell your meme coin on a bonding curve.
00:27:48.336 - 00:28:28.702, Speaker B: So at that point, you don't need to add any liquidity. You're just trying to see how popular the meme is, of course. And if the meme reaches a certain amount of popularity, which corresponds to a $69,000 market cap, at that point, some amount of what has been used to kind of buy the coin effectively gets added as liquidity to radium and locked away forever or burned. And at that point, a pumpkin meme coin has kind of graduated to being a real meme coin and is traded on redium. So you can obviously still trade it on the platform. I think two things are interesting here. One, it's almost like a prediction market on which memes are interesting and which memes are relevant and which ones will take off and which ones won't.
00:28:28.702 - 00:29:06.758, Speaker B: And so if you, you can just kind of come to pump fun and look at a bunch of memes and be like, oh, I think this one will go up, I think this one will go down. And then the second thing I think is super interesting is that, like, they actually have had a bunch of coins that have gone pretty big come out of pump fun. So I was doing some math earlier. So there have been 460,000 tokens launched, which is a completely insane number of tokens to launch. But if you just open the website, there's a coin being launched effectively every second. It's like nonstop, out of which 4600 actually reached the 69K market cap and made it to a radium pool. So I think it's pretty fascinating, actually.
00:29:06.758 - 00:29:42.444, Speaker B: Like, if you are at all a believer in the meme coin meta and this kind of financial nihilism, assets are just memes, and people want to kind of trade them and like, basically play PvP liquidity games. It's super interesting. And the other part of pump fund that I think is super interesting is that you can sort of see that they're trying to be a little bit of a social platform. So you could come to pump fun. And every token has a thread, so you could reply in the thread and start like, there are like conversations about the meme. So it's actually designed a little bit like four chan so you can definitely have a conversation. You can just hang out on the pump fun homepage if you want.
00:29:42.444 - 00:30:23.258, Speaker B: And there's a bunch of YouTube videos as well of people just like spending time trading and hanging out on pump fun. And if you see, I think they have now a feed where you can follow your friends and see what coins they're buying and they're selling. So if you really believe in this, like kind of, there will be a bunch of brain damage. People who spend all their time, like what people do on Instagram, they'll just do that on pump fun. I think it's like a pretty fascinating experiment and you can imagine a lot of stuff happening where people just kind of stream themselves playing around on pump fun. People kind of start following what assets their friends are buying and what assets their friends are selling. So I mean, I don't know how successful it'll be.
00:30:23.258 - 00:30:47.916, Speaker B: They also have kind of a parabola and they charge 1% of every buy transaction on the bonding curve. So they also are producing pretty successful revenue. It's obviously a bet on so many things. It's a bet on the meme coin meta sticking around. It's a bet on people really caring about fair launching. It's a bet on people spending a lot of time on this platform, which you have to be pretty unhinged to do at the moment, but I'm totally fascinated by pump fun. I don't know how you feel about it.
00:30:48.060 - 00:31:29.746, Speaker A: I feel like. So my boomer take is that this reminds me a lot of, just like the launch pads, right? So like last cycle, there were so many launch pads on different chains just allowing people to launch tokens, and they were all trying to build legitimate projects. Whether it's like some Dex on Avax or some Dex on Solana or some fucking lending protocol and Polkadot, this just seems like a, hey, fuck it. Like we're going to drop all that pretense. We're not even building anything here. It's just meme coins. But it's the same thing, right? I'm very skeptical of the business model because there's an oversupply of meme coins, but I guess they are monetizing on the supply, right? So every meme coin that's created the platform makes money and doesn't matter.
00:31:29.746 - 00:31:44.788, Speaker A: They don't really need to care about the outcome of the meme coins themselves. So it's not really like a venture type of model. So I wonder how long this can last. It seems very much like a flash in the pan kind of thing for me. But, yeah, I mean, if it takes off, I also would.
00:31:44.956 - 00:32:12.714, Speaker B: I don't know if, you know, Michi, which is the latest exciting cat token, apparently, which has grown to a $330 million market cap, and there are people saying it's the next wave. Again, this is not investment advice. I never trade meme coins, to be clear, but Michi is at $330 million, and it launched on pump funds. I think as long as, like, assuming there will be one to two meme coins that grow and are relevant, and as long as pump fund is able to capture some percentage of those. I don't know. I mean, like, whiff and doge are real.
00:32:13.254 - 00:33:03.852, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. That's true. I think it's as long as you can capture attention for an extended period of time, there are always things you can do. So if. Okay, I think my caveat is my cop out take is that if pump not fun continues to exist in the current form that it does, you know, in years time, I think it will be much lower volumes, if it exists at all, than here. But if they kind of parlay this attention into something else, if they start to expand, if they start to kind of listen to user feedback, you know, I think quite similar to forecaster, where they basically went from like a Twitter clone to like, a crypto native UI for interacting on chain. I think if they do something like that, then, yeah, there's definitely potential to this, but, yeah, it's very, very, very reminiscent of, like, four chan kind of philosophy.
00:33:03.852 - 00:33:07.744, Speaker A: And even the font, I feel like it's quite similar with the green text and all that.
00:33:08.204 - 00:33:17.624, Speaker B: The thing that blows my mind is just how many coins are launching. It's almost like posts on four chan, except it's a coin. Every time you just look at this webpage, it won't stop moving. Literally.
00:33:18.164 - 00:33:29.844, Speaker A: Yeah. So if you're watching on YouTube, it's literally flashing every second. And I think you mentioned earlier there's like 4464,000 tokens launched. And in how long is it? In a month time? Two months?
00:33:29.884 - 00:33:33.692, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like it's been live for maybe a couple of months. I don't know the exact time, but yeah.
00:33:33.788 - 00:34:02.200, Speaker A: Jesus Christ. Well, I think we've covered a lot of the major ones recently. I'd like to zoom out a bit and talk about just how big we think this market is. So right now, I think with forecaster there's about 50,000 users, with fintech there's about 5000 users. I think for context, I think Facebook has about 2.9 billion monthly active users. So if you assume that the total tam for social crypto now is like, or maybe not tam, maybe the serviceable, addressable market.
00:34:02.200 - 00:34:36.674, Speaker A: So people who are ready to use the apps today, if you assume that it's 100,000, then it's really just like 0.003% of the total social market in the world. So I know this type of moon math is what people use to kind of dilute themselves into thinking massive markets. But it is actually pretty surprising how much attention these things have gotten, but how little usage they still have compared to mainstream. So I'm curious, what do you think are the things that need to happen for us to start to see those type of numbers where we're talking to millions or billions instead of a few thousands?
00:34:39.094 - 00:35:12.696, Speaker B: I really wish I had the answer, but I don't know. Some of it is just truly expanding the crypto tam a little bit. And I think there have been examples that were like, I don't actually know how many users Sorare got at its peak, but Sorare was pretty like, you hear of normies in Europe who are just like football fans. They enjoy playing so rare a lot. I don't know if everyone's familiar. Sorare is effectively a fantasy trading game where your fantasy cards are nfts. They are very successful in football and have done expanded to some american sports as well.
00:35:12.696 - 00:35:54.574, Speaker B: They have official partnerships and all. But yeah, I don't really know. I'm personally like, I don't spend a lot of time worrying about that question. In a weird way, I think every cycle we're going to expand the number of users who are familiar with crypto, and every cycle, crypto native in itself becomes a much larger kind of universe. And given that all of these apps are inherently financial, I personally spend much more. I personally think it's much more interesting trying to find outcomes that appeal a lot to the current set of users versus trying very hard to be like, oh, I'm building the next Facebook on crypto, which is just something that never made sense to me, but also, maybe I lack imagination.
00:35:54.914 - 00:36:20.936, Speaker A: No, I think that was the mistake that early social five founders, or crypto social founders did. They were like, we're going to make Facebook but decentralized. We're going to make Twitter, but you own the data, and then nobody gave a shit. And then now the mentality for social fi is just like, we're going to make something that can maybe make money on, that you can maybe make money on and have some fun on. And that was like an instant hit. So I think every time crypto takes itself too seriously, it just never works.
00:36:21.040 - 00:36:21.280, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:21.312 - 00:36:51.714, Speaker A: The only exception is bitcoin, where all the bitcoiners are super uptight. But whenever anything outside of bitcoin tries to be very, very serious on the consumer facing side, it doesn't work. So I think social five finally figured that out. So on that note, obviously it's very hard to predict, but if we were to make long term bets on winners, I'm sure there are some heuristics that you're looking out for. There are some that I try to look out for as well. What are some things that you try to look out for when you try to figure out, hey, can this thing actually be the next twitter?
00:36:53.654 - 00:37:30.280, Speaker B: I think one that we've thought about internally as a fund that maybe I shouldn't be leaking. It's just that we get excited. A founder can create a parabola. Like the far cost of parabola at some level also exists, but basically, if you can get a small group of users extremely excited and obsessed with your product, that's a really, really good sign. So that's one for me. And the second is that I'm just much more excited by products where some amount of financialization speculation or just like some key feature depends on crypto and wouldn't make sense without crypto. Those are the two things.
00:37:30.280 - 00:37:57.804, Speaker B: And outside of that, I actually think it's worth not like, constraining your ideas of what these things could be too much. Could I have conceived of steel tech? Sorry, steelcam or friendtech or pump fun or fantasy top myself? Like, 100% no. And so the nice thing in consumer, and I think you've also spent a lot of time studying this, is just like, what you're supposed to be doing is seeing things that take off and adding fuel to the fire versus pretending like you can predict the future.
00:37:58.504 - 00:38:30.762, Speaker A: Yeah, I think my approach is so every single social app that's come out since 2018, I try to try it. Even some of the more obscure ones, like favor, which is like another Twitter clone built on lens, I tried all of them, and I think for me, it's like the litmus test is okay. Do I find myself coming back to this app day after day. Do I find this interesting for Farcaster? I couldn't really find that when I signed up two years ago. And then now I just find, okay, it's actually, there's a lot more stuff happening there and then for Friendtech as well. Whenever people ask me a question in my group, I just like, oh, this is interesting. Yeah, I'm happy to do this.
00:38:30.762 - 00:38:49.854, Speaker A: Q and A. So those are, like, small examples of me coming back to apps, I think. One thing that you pointed out earlier, kind of as a half joke, as well as mildly sexual names, pump fun and fantasy top. I wonder if that's deliberate. But, yeah, it's a weird coincidence that those are, like, the two popular apps as well.
00:38:50.474 - 00:39:08.814, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I do think it's important to not take yourself too seriously at some level. Like, I mean, the pumpkrot fund meme coins become radium pools when they hit 69k on Solana and 420k on blast, I believe. And so. And you can see that these founders are also really good at not taking themselves too seriously on Twitter.
00:39:09.314 - 00:39:31.414, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. It's pretty different from, like, infrastructure founders, where it's like everybody's a PhD everybody's talking about, or the nics consensus. I think the only exception is, like, bearer chain. I'm not an investor there, but they're the only chain that doesn't seem to take themselves seriously. I don't know if it will work as an infrastructure. Like, if I'm a developer building an application, I want my business to be built on an infra that's reliable.
00:39:31.414 - 00:40:05.000, Speaker A: I don't know if that type of marketing gels with most mainstream developers, but we'll see. Another thing that I look out for is also actually retention. So my view is that, yes, we're looking for zero to one type of use cases or behaviors that are not possible without crypto. But at the very core, these social products are still social products. They're not too different in terms of the kind of human psychology they tap into compared to web two apps. So as such, I think we can borrow some heuristics from web two apps. So I think a 16 z, not the crypto fund, but a 16 z, the OG fund.
00:40:05.000 - 00:40:49.220, Speaker A: They wrote a really, really good post about how do you define an app, a social app that has captured lightning in a bottle. So without going through the entire application, basically they just track retention, the retention of your users over time. So if you can retain 20% of your users, then it's like, okay, if you can retain 35%, then it's good. If you retain like 50%, then it's great. So as an example, I think they provided a bunch of historical numbers for what it looks like for different social applications. So, for instance, for Snapchat, right, they're day 30 retention. So by the 30th day, how many of the users are still left is about 33%.
00:40:49.220 - 00:41:33.916, Speaker A: For Instagram, it was like 56%. TikTok 34, Twitter 28, Facebook 40. So I know it's very hard to measure this because so many of the applications are still new, numbers are very low. And then the second thing is, for social apps in crypto, there are users, like people who come in to chat and use the features, and there are speculators, people who come in to claim airdrops and maybe buy and sell the tokens. And both of those are counted as users for on chain metrics. So there's a lot of noisy, muddy data in web3, but I try to roughly see if they can at least meet some of these bars. So just for context, when I first looked into this during the initial Frentech v one excitement, I think that that number was around 30% for fantasy top right now.
00:41:33.916 - 00:42:07.174, Speaker A: So far it's about 42%. But for forecaster, I can't really find the reliable data. But the user, this is the only secular growth user chart over time. So it does seem like at least for the hottest project in crypto social right now, they are actually retaining users. So those are the signs that tell me, hey, I should probably be paying attention here, if not buying some of the coins, which I personally have, but I don't know if you've spent time looking into this retention cohort data. I know it's a little bit of overfitting as well.
00:42:09.934 - 00:42:54.254, Speaker B: We do look at it when we make an investment, but honestly, I spend. I'm kind of conflicted where I think it's weird, right? Like, you could have written f friendtech when v one came off, and the retention clearly did fall off a cliff. And it's unclear whether v two is really going to work. I feel like there have been a lot of complaints about the actual app experience and what they've launched. On the other hand, the token is kind of a different product, so it convolutes things. But I think 100%, like, in the long term, we have, like, retention is definitely super important because there have been a bunch of crypto things that have taken off for like a week or a month and then disappeared into nothingness. And Steel Cam is kind of an example of that, actually.
00:42:54.254 - 00:43:17.474, Speaker B: And I think they had very low retention. So we definitely look at retention when we're like trying to dig very deeply into these investment apps. But I think it's interesting. I'm trying to think of what, in ten years, assuming there are great consumer apps and someone writes this vc post on what the right metrics are, like, what kind of retention we'd look for, and what monetization metrics might look different.
00:43:19.174 - 00:43:40.724, Speaker A: I'm curious what your thoughts are on that user point as well, because for these crypto social products, you mentioned earlier that we need to have crypto native use cases. We need to have some form of speculation. But as you know, there are a lot of users that are not real users in that they don't care about the app. They're really here just to trade and claim the airdrop, but they show up as kind of user numbers. So how do you define what an actual user is in a crypto social app?
00:43:41.584 - 00:44:19.430, Speaker B: Yeah, it's super tricky, actually. I think like, I mean, like as GC is like a huge struggle in crypto is trying to just like. And this is not just true of social apps, this is true of bridges and all sorts of other apps, like trying to figure out what apps actually see a bunch of usage and what apps are just kind of people farming airdrops and they don't care a lot. I think unfunzing. It just takes a lot of nuance, like you should be. We don't have the best stats because a lot of that infra is off chain, but it would be super interesting to see how many people are actually spending time in their fintech chats. Similarly, we know how many coins are being launched on pump droid fun.
00:44:19.430 - 00:45:11.904, Speaker B: The thing I'm most curious about is how many are people spending like hours hanging around on pump fun and just buying and selling meme coins. But this is definitely something that's a challenge even for an app like fantasy top. There are a whole bunch of people who are like, hey, this is a cool new app. I'll play it, I'll get involved and I'll do it till the airdrop. And that's why looking on Twitter, to see signs of people having fun, which I think there are at least a handful of people who are having a lot of fun. Playing fantasy top is interesting, but yeah, I mean, the broader issue of trying to figure out what is an incentivized user versus a real user in crypto is effectively a black hole that is in some way where crypto investors make their edge. I think if you even have some strong heuristics and are able to figure out it's what helps you distinguish good investments from bad.
00:45:13.564 - 00:45:37.094, Speaker A: I think just to close this out, let's put some skin in the game here. I know not all of these have live tokens or anything, but let's assume that all of the social apps we talked about are now presented to us as investment opportunities. If you must pick one to invest in and one to maybe not short, because not all of them are tokens, but one to pass, what are your picks? I can go first. Actually, if you need some time to.
00:45:37.094 - 00:45:38.078, Speaker B: Think about do it, do it, do it.
00:45:38.166 - 00:46:16.770, Speaker A: I would personally bet on Friendtech. I already own some friend token, as people know, because it's on my public wallet already. I think they have unlocked something in crypto that was not unlocked before. A lot of people say it's just kind of paid telegram group, but I think the attention they have captured and the way they enforce value in the keys is quite interesting. So I'm curious what they're able to do with v three onwards. If I must pass one, probably pump fun, just because I don't think it's very sustainable to create a business model around just minting of meme coins. I feel like I've seen this before, but yeah, I actually would love to back all the other ones out there.
00:46:16.770 - 00:46:20.304, Speaker A: But if I must pick two, two. That's actually. That's my picks.
00:46:20.764 - 00:46:56.060, Speaker B: Interesting. I think I'll start with what I'm not excited by. I'm still not excited by far. Castle, I get the frames are kind of interesting and quasi crypto native behavior and people are tipping Degen, though I've heard there's a lot of boarding behavior there. I just fundamentally think the product is kind of uninteresting and I think a lot of the stuff they've pitched where they're like, oh, look like there's a whole bunch of people building far caster clients now. And I just like, I'm just skeptical that this is like a super interesting product space to work in where you lose a different farcaster client and I'll use a different farcaster client. It's not my bet on how social apps take off.
00:46:56.060 - 00:47:33.720, Speaker B: And I think the fundamental problem of just trying to recreate Twitter without Twitter's distribution is like just not going to work. It'll continue to be a cute place for CT people to hang out because it feels a little cleaner than crypto Twitter, but I'm pretty bearish overall on forecaster. I'm going to hedge my long and just say I'm going with the mildly sexual name strategy. So I actually like both pump fun and fantasy top a lot. I think fantasy top, again, like I said, it's one. It's a model that works, right? Like, people love playing this stuff in sports. People actually do love speculating on who's going to win and who's going to lose sports games.
00:47:33.720 - 00:48:10.894, Speaker B: And if you can think of CT as an arena, I think as long as they can kind of solve the botting problems and make sure that, like, it doesn't feel artificial, they are definitely on to something. And I'm actually bullish pumpkin fun just because. I don't know. I think meme coins aren't going anywhere. I think I have a little more belief in their staying power than most other people in the space. And I think it's really a long degeneracy bet. And I think if you're long degeneracy, imagining people spending a lot of time on pump function is exciting.
00:48:11.834 - 00:48:49.342, Speaker A: Yeah, I could see that. Because initially my thought was, okay, if I want a long meme coins, I'll just buy the meme coins. But if you look at the average half life of a meme coin, and I discussed this with Ray Chan on the meme Land episode as well, there's actually not that long of a lifespan. There's only a few that's made it to Lindy doge Shiba, maybe with eventually, but most of the meme conscious die off after a few months. If you want to hold meme coins, hold a basket of meme coins versus holding a business that churns out meme coins. Technically, the latter is probably a better bet on that kind of long degeneracy. So I can definitely see that well, but there you have it, folks.
00:48:49.342 - 00:49:23.294, Speaker A: You have our picks for kind of the social fi category, at least in the existing universe. So we'll check back in in two years and see how bad or how good our picks are. But if you have any questions for me or Sanaa, just ping us on Twitter or follow us on the blockcrunch on Twitter or ping us in whatever social app you can find us on.
