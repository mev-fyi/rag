00:00:00.600 - 00:00:54.444, Speaker A: I think for us we target specifically yield products on majors, which is something that every crypto person owns. Some part of their portfolio is in ETH or bitcoin or USDC. I think our focus is really just like we think there really isn't much alternatives in DeFi if you are high yields on ether bitcoin. So because of that you almost have to use revenue if you are looking for the type of yield profile. So yeah, I think it's very different from trying to sell people a thematic idea compared to this is the place that you can get high yield on your ether bitcoin for some part of your portfolio. I think that's an easier sell and something that doesn't go away once the hype cycle disappears.
