00:00:00.240 - 00:00:45.104, Speaker A: And I think the most important thing is a fighter spirit, or like, the tenacity that they have, like, the vibe that they show that they never give up. And I think it's super important, a lot more important for crypto startups than typical tech startups, because, number one, crypto moves so fast. And as we were saying, that you might have to pivot after two months. You might have to expand in a month. And the second is because the whole industry is so new, you never know what's going to work and how the industry is going to be. Right. So that's why you need to be able to have that fighter spirit and always try to find a way to make it work, because what worked, you know, last month may not work in the next few months.
00:00:45.104 - 00:00:47.244, Speaker A: So I think that, yeah, that's the key thing.
