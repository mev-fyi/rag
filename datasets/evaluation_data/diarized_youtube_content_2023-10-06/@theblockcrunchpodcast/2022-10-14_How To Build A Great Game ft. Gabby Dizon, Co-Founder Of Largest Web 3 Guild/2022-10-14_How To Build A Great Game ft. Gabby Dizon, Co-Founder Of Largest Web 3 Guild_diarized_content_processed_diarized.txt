00:00:00.280 - 00:00:44.358, Speaker A: Yeah. So shipping a game is incredibly complex that requires a lot of different skill sets. You need art, you need game design, you need code, you typically need a lot of back end server skills. And yeah, putting these together into a working product that is actually fun is very, very hard. So there's a lot of operational excellence that goes into shipping a good game. And I think a lot of teams that come to web3, a lot of them are like zero to one thinkers, conceptual thinkers that may have original ideas, but I don't think we've seen the kind of basically operational excellence that we've seen in the top games coming to web3. There's already teams that have been funded and starting to build product, but typically a good game has a dev cycle of like around two to three years.
00:00:44.358 - 00:00:54.334, Speaker A: So I think there's a lag in the market right now where the teams get fund got funded last year, earlier this year, starting to build product, and we're not going to see the fruits of that labor until maybe end of year or sometime next year.
