00:00:42.744 - 00:01:26.186, Speaker A: Now, a lot of you have been asking for how I analyze projects that I bring on the show. That's why I decided to create Blockchain's vip to share with you all the heavy research that goes on behind the scenes. Now, every week or so, our team prepares an in depth research memo with things like sector analysis, technical concepts made simple, in depth competitor breakdown, and even interactive models so you can learn about the most important projects before they become important. And our team is putting in hours every week, scouring discord, twitter, forums and blogs to help you get an edge in crypto and understand the latest projects and themes at the deepest levels. That goes way beyond just an interview. Now, in addition, we'll also host exclusive AMA's with myself to answer any of your questions. So all of these are only available to blockchain's vip subscribers.
00:01:26.186 - 00:02:01.000, Speaker A: And the good news is that while our interviews will always be free, the vip tier costs less than one coffee a day. So head on over to theblockfrench.com VIP or click the link in the show notes below to sign up. Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockchain Podcast. Now, this week I'm really excited to have Longhash ventures on the show. Now, Longhash is a crypto investment fund and accelerator, and they collaborate with founders to build their web3 model and navigate the asian crypto landscape. So with me today are Emma, who is the founder of Longhash and also Chican, who is the CEO and GP of Longhash.
00:02:01.000 - 00:02:02.444, Speaker A: So welcome to the show, guys.
00:02:02.944 - 00:02:06.844, Speaker C: No, thanks for having us. Super exciting being a big fan.
00:02:07.504 - 00:02:18.084, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And so I know you guys just came from nftnyc as well. So before we get started with formalities, how was the whole event? Like, what do you guys think of the whole event?
00:02:18.904 - 00:03:00.204, Speaker C: Yeah, it's super exciting. So I think we still see like lots of excitement even though the market was doing absolutely horrible for the like two, three weeks when the whole conference was happening, right. Every night it was like bad news. Right. But I think everyone there was super, super excited. I think like a couple of observations, right? So firstly, like, I see a lot of different background people as opposed to the normal, usual defi, sort of like crypto conference, right. This time you see like musicians, you know, artists and kind of people you don't expect to see crypto are there, which is super exciting.
00:03:00.204 - 00:03:24.964, Speaker C: Also, I do see a lot of interest from like web two vc's particularly. A lot of kind of web two vc's from China. I don't know whether it's because a lot of people kind of left Shanghai, you know, because of the COVID situation, but a lot of them are there in NFT New York conference. Yeah, it's super. A lot of exciting energy flowing around.
00:03:25.824 - 00:03:48.414, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. In the end, it's really all about the people. Right. So we were spending a lot of time with these one on one meetings with our portfolio, with other investors, and reassuring that people are still here. So even though whatever the market says, especially at NFT, NYC energy is still there and there's still a lot of creative frontiers for people to explore.
00:03:48.994 - 00:04:10.854, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And speaking of longhouse, you guys have been around for a while and you've made a lot of notable investments, projects like Polkadot Zapper. I think you guys were early investors in like instadapp Balancer and one of my personal favorite projects in the space cow swap as well. So can you talk a little bit about the background for longhash? How did you guys get started and what are you guys mostly focused on these days?
00:04:11.474 - 00:04:41.874, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I can take a crack on that. So we started in late 2017, early 2018. I met Chikai when we were both McKinsey consultants doing a project in Vietnam. Helped one of the local banks launch digital attacker business. And we start to talk about crypto, web3 back in 2017. So late 2017, once I get connected to some of the crypto ogs in China, who is willing to put up some seed money for us to start accelerator.
00:04:41.874 - 00:05:40.968, Speaker C: So I called up Xikai and he just kind of left McKinsey even though he had a return offer, but he never really went back after a year. So we started as an accelerator in 2018, and our first big bet was really, like you mentioned, into Polkadot ecosystem as we really liked the whole kind of interoperability thesis. And we also felt like, hey, we have accelerator, why don't we help you to launch accelerator in Asia? So that's kind of what we did. And through that accelerator program, we managed to invest into some of the kind of relatively prominent projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, like Asta Acala. So that kind of model really makes us think, hey, you know, it helps to kind of add value to a lot of protocols, right? And really helps us to capture early stage deal flow as well. From there, we replicated that model. We worked with Filecoin, we worked with Algorand Ncitica, quite a number of different protocols.
00:05:40.968 - 00:06:00.384, Speaker C: And last year we set up a dedicated defi fund, and today we're setting up our second fund of hunter Mu. We're actually just in the process of doing first close. So over the years, I think our thesis has evolved, but definitely has been focusing on this whole multi chain infrastructure.
00:06:01.924 - 00:06:04.184, Speaker A: Definitely. Anything to add there, Shikai?
00:06:04.644 - 00:07:04.944, Speaker D: Sure thing. I think, as you mentioned in an intro, I think a lot of people come to us with particularly the multi chain idea, but also the fact that we run an accelerator and the fact that we're based in Asia. I think the combination of these two things with the accelerator, there is a general impression from the fact that we do work with founders. It's value adding from the start with particular goals and milestones that we try to instate whenever we try to work with a certain founder that's in our DNA whenever we invest in any project. And secondly, having done that in Asia, where we built up a network to support the founders, be it from the relationships from the web3 side or from a community perspective, to get more exposure, the founders that we speak to want that complementary skillset. I think that's why with many of the investments, as you have mentioned, they do want this plurality on the cap table among the investors.
00:07:05.964 - 00:07:41.954, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And I think it's really interesting to have this accelerator in Asia, because there are not that many accelerators in Asia, period, and let alone accelerators in Web three. So this is really, really cool to see. And I'd love to dive into the multi chain infrastructure as well, but just because it's still fresh out of memories right now, I'd love to dive more into NftNYC and what you guys found there, because I'm curious, like, based on what you've seen there. So I personally didn't go there, but it seems like, as Emma mentioned, there's a lot of diversity of people, not just like crypto natives. What does that tell you about where nFTs are today? And what does that event inform you about where nfts are going?
00:07:43.014 - 00:08:14.646, Speaker C: Okay, happy to take the question. First, I think my mental model is, I put NFT into three categories. The first obviously is the collectible. I think that's where most of the value of NFT is today. And the second category is the kind of standards and tools for community engagement. You can use that as a kind of membership token for token gated access and stuff like that. And then the third type is more like innovative use cases that has linkage to off chain world and usage.
00:08:14.646 - 00:09:02.308, Speaker C: And it's way more complicated than just token gated access. It could be maybe like an NFT token to access your car or NFT tokens for, I don't know, represent tokenized fractionalized ownership of something in real life. I think that the sky is the limit. So today I think most of the NFT use cases we're seeing are still in category one because it's the most speculative. And people just love collecting all these jpegs even though there's no real utility. But it's fun and you can show off. But the second category, I think we start to see some signs with that, with what role is building in terms of, you know, social token and integrating utilities to that social token and board apes.
00:09:02.308 - 00:09:59.574, Speaker C: So, so say during NFT New York, I see a lot of like board apes holders are super excited to go to the marketing events, right? There was like a, like a concert where Snoop Dogg showed up. Everybody's super, super excited about it. Yeah, everyone. And people were like buying different types of merch which they only have access to, and this type of aid festival and that really get everyone super excited. But category three where, you know, it's the enrichment of various like real life use case. I don't think we're seeing too much, but that's the part I'm most excited and bullish on. I think the example of that could be like I just mentioned, right? I would love to see one day in my wallet I'm holding ownership token of say my house or my car, right? I will be able to control that from my car or I'll be able to sell that in a p two p marketplace.
00:09:59.574 - 00:10:10.414, Speaker C: And I'm sure the creators, builders there would have way more imagination than I have. So those are kind of my mental model.
00:10:11.034 - 00:10:52.236, Speaker D: Yeah. If I may converge with that answer from a people angle as well. I think we do see quite a few types of people on the ground at NFT NYC and they are rather distinct. Like the energy is quite different. So I think the first group that most people are very familiar with are, I guess we kind of fall in that category as well, which are then the collectors, the investors, the participants in web3, the crypto holders who are there to enjoy the community, enjoy the part of web3, join these parties and bond with each other. And so there's still, I think, a bunch of energy around this part. NFTs have brought people together in this unique way that the crypto hasn't really done.
00:10:52.236 - 00:11:44.774, Speaker D: So in fact, it's a little even more kind of like micro tribal and like, okay, sure. Like people are excited about that. Fine. Then there's like the more the creator economy side of things, which people have been talking about for a long time. But here we are on the ground and it's actually there, right? Like the artists, the 3d designers, the musicians, they are there and they're there trying to learn how did it actually mint, how did he use storage, how they use the different tools to reach their community and fans. So that part to me is really an infectious kind of energy, and it touches on like the infrastructure providers as well. But what everybody's looking for, as what emma has said, and also we delivered this as part of our event talk, is that everybody wants to have some sort of like real utility or like real value, arguably.
00:11:44.774 - 00:12:28.184, Speaker D: We've created so many collectibles and assets. And the fun thing about it is that it doesn't have to be separate, right? Just because you're a collective doesn't mean you can't also have utility. Or just because you don't have a piece of art doesn't mean you can't go straight to the utility component, which we see some very early signs of, like joining these, the parties using these NFTs as token gates. But there's a lot more talk about the roadmap in the future where, hey, look, actually here, I can create some merch. I can give you lifetime access to particular types of goods and services. I can give you lifetime access to ticketing, for example. Or you can get something like royalties in the ips with music.
00:12:28.184 - 00:12:39.214, Speaker D: So all these on the horizon, that's what everybody's minds are about. Like everybody realizes, especially in the bear market, we're all looking for real value, and this has to come in the coming cycle.
00:12:40.074 - 00:13:09.614, Speaker C: That's super interesting. I want to add to category three, I think, because recently we're doing a lot more research on music. Nifty. So that's one category we really want to see, more disruption. And we think there's huge potential, right? Because you can disrupt from music creation to music distribution and to ongoing kind of fan engagement, there's so much you can do to this entire industry's background chain. So I think, yeah, we're super bullish in this sector and really want to see more projects coming out from here.
00:13:10.474 - 00:13:18.170, Speaker D: And I must say that to keep adding on with, like, the parties, you can kind of feel their vibes.
00:13:18.202 - 00:13:18.370, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:18.402 - 00:13:46.234, Speaker D: But with music, it really hits different when you're at one of these, like, in person events, and the artist comes on and says, hey, look, I'm about to sing this track that just minted out this morning, and it's about partly web3, and, like, my story and anything about it, they perform it live, the crowd engages with it like that energy. Life is something totally different and really makes us feel compelled to collect and share this with a particular community.
00:13:47.174 - 00:14:32.394, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think for people who want to learn more about, like, a specific example of this, one of my favorite episodes I've ever done on the show is episode 178, which we did with the lead guitarist from a band called Avenged Sevenfold. And he was talking about how they use NFTs to curate a community. And initially, a lot of their communities, these are, like, heavy metal fans, not exactly the most kind of tech focused type of crowd, and they were a little bit against that, but I think now they're coming around to it. And I think that it was really interesting because this is exactly what the social tokens guys have tried to do, but then for some reason, they never took off. But then NFTs took off in this huge way. So I'm curious about why do you think that is? How did NFTs take off for musicians and artists the way that social tokens fail to do so?
00:14:33.734 - 00:15:15.354, Speaker C: Yeah, that's super interesting because I think social token tool in many ways still remains as a fungible token. I feel like for a lot of the communities, it's actually good to combine both because, say, for example, ERC 20 token will represent the economy and. But a non fungible token represents uniqueness of collectibles of, you know, certain type of different tier of membership. Right. So there's different fun, a different kind of attractiveness associated with different type of, you know, whether it's fungible, non fungible. So I feel like. I feel like in my mind, like a more perfect model will be combining those two.
00:15:15.354 - 00:15:19.614, Speaker C: I don't know if that kind of addresses the question.
00:15:20.074 - 00:16:01.514, Speaker D: Yeah, it's a matter of timing, because if you go to an artist and say, hey, look, time to print your own money, just put stuff in a very weird way, whereas now say, hey, look, actually sell your album and allow the collectors of your album to come to meet you at a concert, then, okay, it's something different. And now we can introduce a bit more of the social currency concept of like. Okay, then what about people who promote your album? What are people who are actually organizing those events, hosting these listening parties? Maybe it's time to now that we can introduce a bit of that social money concept starting from NFT. So I think our hope is that it will indeed see both, as Emma said.
00:16:02.134 - 00:16:16.724, Speaker A: Yeah. And I really like how I think your inner consultants come out because I love how process driven that thinking is. Like you get the NFTs first you see that community, and then you get to the social tokens part. Maybe the NFTs are the missing step that social tokens needed to take off.
00:16:17.344 - 00:16:31.832, Speaker C: Yeah, totally. And I feel like because of the uniqueness of every piece of NFT, right. It kind of really relates to you personally. Right. Like my board apes will be different from your board apes. Right. And once I put it as my profile, I probably have some sort of emotional bond.
00:16:31.832 - 00:16:38.284, Speaker C: I probably don't want to sell it, even if it's not the most sensible investment compared to some ERC 20 token.
00:16:39.154 - 00:16:41.658, Speaker A: Yeah. If I may, great example.
00:16:41.826 - 00:17:27.254, Speaker D: Throw in like a wild idea here. I think arguably we kind of hit a winter with NFT volumes now. Like an actual winter, right? With like volumes, like way below what we used to see. And to me, everybody, a lot of people have actually made this comparison where we had the ICO era of nfts, where people used it to raise huge amounts of funds with little accountability, and now it's kind of dissipated and everybody's waiting for that DeFi summer moment. So what really kicked off DeFi summer was the idea of liquidity mining, right? That you can actually reward a particular specific, verifiable on chain behavior and link that with earning a particular token. So we need that kind of like liquidity mining moment kickoff for nfts. And it's quite hard to do it for nfts.
00:17:27.254 - 00:18:03.144, Speaker D: So I could be like, during the ICO times we have whitelisting as well. You have to do all this sharing on social media, but it's only when you can do on chain behavior providing lp tokens. So here, what is the behavior that we can verify that benefits these NFT communities? It's very hard to do that with nfts directly because they are like a single big chunk. You want to have these micro contributions that in the end can add up and maybe you can redeem a particular NFT or unlock the purchase of a particular NFT. So I think that social tokens or these ERC 20 equivalents could be the missing piece for the next cycle to come.
00:18:04.084 - 00:18:45.556, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a really interesting point because in my mind I always thought that we already had nfts somewhere with all the retail speculating. But I guess you're right in that a lot of the first wave of nfts are cookie cutters of each other, right? User profile pictures. And there's maybe one or two winners out there, things like board apes and cryptopunks. But for the most part, a lot of them are still quite speculative kind of small experiments similar to icos. So I'm really looking forward to seeing NFT summer, but I'd love to take this chance to pivot a little bit and talk about you guys main thesis, which is the multi chain infrastructure. And what's interesting to me is every bear market people revert on this, right? People are like, okay, all these ETH killers, they're not going to be around. It's all about Ethereum.
00:18:45.556 - 00:18:49.864, Speaker A: So tell us, why are you guys confident about the multi chain future?
00:18:52.004 - 00:20:30.166, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, I think it's somewhat kind of validated for the last four years, right? Because the amount of activity, I can't remember the specific matrix, but the amount of tvls or the amount of users, I think it used to be a lot more Ethereum dominant, whereas today you do see that being kind of captured by other alternative layer ones or L2 s. I think if you look at the longer enough time period, actually the, you know, it's not like the dominance of Ethereum activity has been growing up. It actually has been coming down right from percentage wise. But I think one thing I have to say is I feel like some of the best brains, best talent developers are still in Ethereum community and some of the key innovations are still there, right? Defy summer breakout from their NFT. Most of the high value nfts are still there. A lot of the real innovations happens in Ethereum, but once it gets created because of the permissionless nature of, you know, crypto and blockchain, it just gets copied and kind of in a super efficient way, right? Just kind of proliferates in many other chains and, and every chain brings a different value proposition, right? Some are, I really like what, Hashib from dragonflies. One of the article, he says blockchains are like cities, right? Which I think makes a lot of sense, right? In real life, it doesn't make sense for you to expect all the companies or even all the financial service companies to set up shop in Manhattan just because it's not physically possible.
00:20:30.166 - 00:21:18.096, Speaker C: So same thing in crypto. You can't possibly expect all the different types of applications to compete for the scarce block space in one chain. Different type of value capturing different type of applications will drive for different kind of underlying needs for different chain. Right. So I think it's been somewhat validated and also, I think as we can see, as Ethereum kind of migrates from proof of stake, sorry, from proof of work to proof of stake, right. Because it's kind of a working chain with billions of dollars of values captured in there, the whole migration, you know, a lot of careful planning, it doesn't happen so quickly, right. But if you build a brand new chain, you can just do that very quickly.
00:21:18.096 - 00:21:39.364, Speaker C: So innovation can happen very quickly. So that's why we've been kind of putting bets in chains that could help applications or infrastructures that could help applications to launch application chain very quickly. And that's why the initial bet in Polkadot and now we're seeing to invest more into the cosmos ecosystem. Yeah.
00:21:43.924 - 00:21:45.452, Speaker A: Hey guys, im really excited to tell.
00:21:45.468 - 00:22:19.640, Speaker B: You more about one of my favorite products in crypto right now, DYDX. This is a team ive known since 2018 and theyve built one of the best exchange venues out there that also happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly. Now listen until the end because theres an opportunity for savvy traders out there as well. And here are just a few reasons why I like DyDx over other exchanges. First, its very liquid. It processes two to $3 billion every day in volume and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording. Which means you can trade things like Ethereum, bitcoin, Doge Solana, and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today.
00:22:19.640 - 00:23:19.712, Speaker B: Second, its also extremely cheap and if youre down bad from the bear market, you dont have to worry about gas fees at all because there is no gas fee on starkware L2 where DyDx is built on. That brings me to my next point as well. Its incredibly fast. Unlike other L2 and high speed dexs, you dont actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore. And as an additional point, by using Starkware, DyDx also provides users with increased security and privacy. And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature, which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so many different subaccounts IoFS mobile app is also live right now and its amazing because its compatible with metamask Coinbase wallet, Coin 98, Huawei Wallet and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there and its available for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today. And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions, the most recent tier in the $10,000 equity tier, have won over $95,000 in rewards.
00:23:19.712 - 00:23:34.964, Speaker B: And you can get started with as low as dollar 500 in equity to compete for prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DyDX exchange to learn more. And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:23:37.784 - 00:24:25.904, Speaker A: Got it? Got it. And that's interesting because I'm curious what you guys look for in terms of predictors for a l one's potential success. Right? So back before Solana took off, I think the thesis that was put forward by multicoin was that low fees make a lot of sense, right? The everyday user wants low fees and composability makes a lot of sense. Everything should be on one chain so that everything can easily compose versus being on different app chains, different shards. And I don't think most people predicted that that would happen. But it does seem like, it does seem to highlight the fact that there needs to be a trade off that is so unique to warrant there being a unique chain, whereas a lot of the other chains out there, they have similar infrastructure. You could argue that maybe Polkadot cosmos, maybe near, maybe ETH 2.0,
00:24:25.904 - 00:24:45.764, Speaker A: they all are these kind of hub and spoke type of model. And the tradeoffs may not be immediately clear to most users or people out there. So I'm curious, do you agree with the thesis that these chains have to be so different that it warrants their own existence? Um, you know, otherwise, like, why should we have so many different chains?
00:24:46.984 - 00:24:48.240, Speaker D: Oh yeah, yeah, that's.
00:24:48.392 - 00:24:49.924, Speaker C: Sorry, you go ahead.
00:24:50.384 - 00:24:50.856, Speaker A: Sure thing.
00:24:50.880 - 00:25:19.602, Speaker D: Sure thing. I think. Absolutely. Although even just from like a, purely from a block space perspective, even if you're not super differentiated, like the sheer demand for block space and like the need for scaling means that you will get different l one s, which may be more similar. Right. But if I may bring back the city's analogy, sure. Along all the river deltas, you have all these congregation of people coming in from social perspective, agriculture perspective.
00:25:19.602 - 00:26:17.834, Speaker D: But as the infrastructure gets more mature, we start to see specialized towns, come on. Industrial towns, where it's specified for a particular factory or a particular type of product or service that they're producing, which could be mining something or producing semiconductor goods, for example. Or you might see the artist towns emerge, where it's all about the culture. You get a congregation of the most innovative artistic people come in and do all these paintings, sculptures, and that attracts a lot of tourists and exports its own kind of products and services, which targets a particular crowd, typically the more premium, more luxury kind of crowd. And so what I think we will see is the kind of speciation across. People will try to firstly fill all the demand for basic block space. And you go on and differentiate and speciate into the various niches that you can occupy to serve particular goods and services to the most optimal extent.
00:26:19.574 - 00:26:51.374, Speaker A: I see, because I think that's a really important point, because if you look at the developments of different l ones in this past cycle and the cycle before that, you have l ones that focus on specific use cases. I remember there are a few l ones that tried to be like the gaming chain. And then at one point, people were saying ethereum's like the defi chain. And I think tazos tried to become like an NFT chain and Nier tried to have its own kind of art community as well. So I'm curious whether you think use cases or dev tooling, like, which of these drive differentiation more?
00:26:52.834 - 00:26:53.650, Speaker D: Why not both?
00:26:53.722 - 00:26:54.374, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:56.594 - 00:27:44.726, Speaker D: There'S from the demand side, like clearly, like the volume of block space that you need, as you can see with DydX, drives them to bring their own chain or like a game, right? They need so much block space. I think increasingly, like perhaps even on the horizon, you see something like a step in, decide to maybe like, hey, look, we're using so much Dex volume, we're using so much block space. Maybe it makes sense to have your own app chain. At the same time, it might not be very possible if the barrier is too high, right? Like you need those highways. And I like to think of the tooling for that particular chain as kind of like the plumbing and the wiring that you need to make in a particular chain. How do you make the user experience really good in handling their wallets and handling their gas? If you're doing a consumer application like a game or like a step in, maybe you don't want everybody to pay gas every single time. You just want them to verify the nfts.
00:27:44.726 - 00:27:57.104, Speaker D: And so the tooling comes bottom up, and also the demand comes and sucks people out from different places. And we hope it comes hand in hand. As always, it's not a clear cut this or that or one or zero.
00:27:57.884 - 00:28:14.284, Speaker C: Yeah. I also feel like for a particular change to take off, right. It's so much more than just the technology, because you could say, hey, I'm the cheapest. Right. Or I'm the fastest or most secure. But the truth to that is there will be so many more other elements, right. You can.
00:28:14.284 - 00:28:35.764, Speaker C: One is about technology. Secondly is about developer community. Right. Are you attracting the best talent? Thirdly is about whether do you have the tools for people to do their work easily? And also, do you have the right policy? So in a way, it's very much like a city or like a country. Right. Think about Singapore. Singapore started as a small fishing village, right.
00:28:35.764 - 00:28:56.770, Speaker C: Doesn't have anything. It doesn't have the, you know, the best technology, if you use the analogy, right. It doesn't have the resource or whatnot. But how did it become the global financial center today? Right. And a lot of it is to do with it manages to track the best talent. So in the case of blockchain, attracting a lot of the developers, the brains. Right.
00:28:56.770 - 00:29:20.974, Speaker C: And having the right policy, having the right tools, having the right, you know, housing policies, the right infrastructures to keep people here. So I feel like. So for us, when we look at, you know, whether we will be bullish or making investment into one particular chain ecosystem, we want to look at all those things kind of holistically, not just like, hey, their consensus mechanism is different.
00:29:22.344 - 00:30:02.856, Speaker A: Definitely. And I'd love to kind of dive into Polkadot here as well, because I know you guys were involved early on, and my previous employer, Spartan, we were very bullish on polkadot in the early days as well. And I remember we were buying up a lot of SAF just OTC, just because we were very bullish on the team and the development. But I think one thing, one lesson for us in the past cycle is that seemingly the development there has not been as fast as some of the other l one s that really grew massively. Right. Communities like Avalanche and Solana. And we were trying to do a post mortem about, okay, what exactly kind of not went wrong, but what exactly could they have done better to kind of grow faster? And, you know, we have an answer, obviously.
00:30:02.856 - 00:30:11.124, Speaker A: But I'm curious what you guys think, whether you guys agree with that statement first, and if so, like, what do you guys think can be done better at the Polkadot side?
00:30:12.064 - 00:30:50.094, Speaker C: Yeah, I think depending on what timeframe you're looking at, if you're looking at the last two years, definitely agree with your assessment. It hasn't grown or depending on what matrix. If you're looking at market cap, yes, sure it hasn't grown as fast as some of the alternative layer ones, but if you're looking at number of developers, it's still the second largest developer community outside of Ethereum. There's still lots of projects coming through. Right. So I think if we're taking a long enough kind of timeframe, we're still bullish in Polkadot ecosystem. That's why we're still investing into the space.
00:30:50.094 - 00:31:42.454, Speaker C: But I do think there are some lessons for them to think about, because if you look at some of the kind of more aggressive layer ones like Solana Avalanche, they have a very kind of dedicated business development. Or you can argue whether it's centralized or decentralized. Right. I think Ethereum was started as being super decentralized because it has the benefits of being the first smart contract platform. But then the game has become increasingly competitive. So for layer one to gain traction quickly, you just need to have very aggressive policies or infrastructure to attract developers and also to have the successful poster boy use cases, I think to attract further talents. And I think to that end, Polkadot has still been adopting a relatively kind of decentralized approach.
00:31:42.454 - 00:31:58.634, Speaker C: So they have infrastructure in place like grants and accelerator program. But I think largely the development team is trying to stay away from the marketing market, making a lot of those type of activities and more focus on development.
00:31:59.374 - 00:32:39.114, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. The culture is definitely a lot more focused on compliance. Very, very safe. We don't want any risk at all of being labeled as security. And I think because of that, that has been a limitation to push forward with some of, say, the incentive programs aside from the grants that has been happening. So because of that, perhaps we'll see a longer time horizon before we see the exponential scale versus a more bootstrapped approach approach which some of the other newer l one s have taken. But it remains to be seen in the five to ten year horizon how it looks like and how it will play out.
00:32:40.294 - 00:33:44.864, Speaker A: Shika, I think you made a really interesting point about remaining compliant because it seems like at least in crypto, it's the projects that toe the line that are kind of pushing into gray area almost that seem to have been winners. And I think one of the good examples of that was DYDx and disclaimer, they are a sponsor of the show, but they kind of went for this essentially hosted clob model and now they're pushing, after they got the adoption, now they're aggressively pushing towards decent decentralization I guess you could argue the same for Uniswap, right? It didn't have a token until way later on, and even now it's still pretty centralized holdings. So there is something to be said about centralized development versus community driven development, but that can be another episode in and out of itself. So I want to kind of get your thoughts on something else, which is recently, in this past cycle, we saw a lot of dapps hit product market fit and they start to onboard a lot of users and suddenly they want to launch on their own chain. So Axie Infinity was one of them, Defi Kingdom and recently Dydx, of course. I'm curious, what do you think about this? Is this the eventual path for all the apps? They're just going to become their own app chains?
00:33:47.444 - 00:34:45.754, Speaker D: Quite likely indeed, I think. But you need to incubate the, perhaps you need to incubate a particular, to a particular scale before you would do that. I think once you hit a particular demand, a need for space, block space in the digital sense, or like physical space in the real world sense, as an equivalent, it could make sense to at least partition off your own section of your town. Eventually you're known as your state, you're known as your own country in the same way for block space. So what I think what we're really interested in is how do we help projects make that transition and prepare for that transition from the get go. So one of our investments recently is into this multi chain infrastructure called saga. They allow you to spin up these chainlets very easily, just like how you're spinning up an Amazon server and say, okay, look, initially, if you don't want to care about setting up validators and so on, we're going to do everything for you.
00:34:45.754 - 00:35:26.574, Speaker D: You just need to tell us what's the kind of sla you need and we'll set it up. You can tell us exactly the kind of virtual machine you like, the user experience you like with gas and so on, and we'll get you going. So you start from a small perspective and then look at as you scale, you need more block space, you need more customized features, then you can start to do that, or maybe even you decide to spin up your own chain by yourself. So in the same way, I think with Polkadot, some of the on the roadmap, we have something like parathreads where, look, you don't need to have your own chain as a whole. Go for the whole auction. People say it can be expensive. Look, whenever you need a block, just purchase that bit of block space.
00:35:26.574 - 00:35:56.194, Speaker D: Then as you scale up, maybe you can think of a parachain. Maybe you move to a parachain first, maybe you set up your own parachain later. So we need to kind of lay down the steps for that transition. But certainly, I think once you hit a certain scale, to me, it's an inevitable future as long as we can crack the interoperability question, because if it breaks composability, the cost of it might still be too high. So as long as you can set up and retain those benefits of using all these other applications. Sure thing.
00:35:57.774 - 00:35:58.086, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:58.110 - 00:36:00.234, Speaker A: And Emma, anything to add there as well?
00:36:00.534 - 00:36:38.242, Speaker C: No, and I also think provides a lot of flexibility. Right. Because today, the truth is the underlying has posed a lot of restrictions to support some of the applications that has reached product market fate. And the most immediate needs is to gain scalability. So by using, say, for example, Cosmos IDC framework or Polkadot, you are able to have your own chain and customize. But then one day, what if you want to be plugged into a multi chain world? I don't want to be an isolated island. I want to be connected, like Singapore again.
00:36:38.242 - 00:36:57.934, Speaker C: I'm like the best citizen of Singapore. So, like, what happens? Right then the IBC model is great, because then I can be plugged into other cosmos chains, or in the Polkadot framework, I can be plugged with other parent chains. So I feel it's pretty attractive model. Yeah.
00:36:58.594 - 00:37:42.554, Speaker A: And I think this is a very relevant point, especially now, because in the past few months, people have started to service this new narrative called the fat apps narrative. So for people who have followed the show since 2018, you know, we've discussed fat protocols on the show so many times already, but people are now turning that around and saying, well, chains are actually worthless without applications built on top. The applications are the ones that's instilling these chains with value. But right now, from what you're saying so far, it seems like applications are still very much paying for block space. You know, block space is still the thing in demand right now. So how do you think this plays out in the future? Like, it seems a little bit chicken and egg for me, because, you know, block space on a chain shouldn't be worth anything if no one's using it. But if no one's using it, then, you know, it's.
00:37:42.554 - 00:37:45.134, Speaker A: So I'm curious what your general thoughts about that.
00:37:46.434 - 00:38:29.422, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a super interesting analogy. I think intuitively, I would think both matters, right? Because in the web tool world, it's owning fat application. Right. You have all these kind of monopolies, applications hold user data and sell them, and that's super profitable. But if you look at the protocol level, the HTTP, SMTP and all that, there's no way to monetize it. That's why it's public goods. But the unique advantage of crypto web3 is you can incorporate a token into the underlying protocol, whether it's communication protocol or whether it's the decentralized storage layer, you are able to incorporate the model, the token, and trade revenue out from there.
00:38:29.422 - 00:39:14.976, Speaker C: But I think that doesn't invalidate applications holds value. It's just that both used to have value, but there's no way for protocol to capture value. Before, but now with token, you can capture value for protocol, you can also capture value for application. And I think it drives demand for both. Say for example, ethereum, there's so much applications wants to build on top of that, and hence that really highlights the scalability issue. People want it to be faster, want it to work really well, and because of that, it's not able to meet the requirements of all the applications and hence migrate. Application starts to migrate out other than the ones that's already generating lots of value, like you have uniswap and compound and all those.
00:39:14.976 - 00:39:35.794, Speaker C: But one day, once those applications move to a different chain, if that chain managed to suit the needs of a lot of applications, chain will potentially face some sort of threshold as well. Right. And that drives needs for better, faster chain again. So I think it's kind of like a dynamic stripes in each other to evolve.
00:39:36.814 - 00:40:07.350, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, absolutely right. All the values can have value thanks to the token. If I may add a little bit of dimension here, I think the threat protocol thesis was largely centered around the idea of like money assets and finance. So when you have, when you need like that settlement layer, it does make sense and you want like very immutable, smart contracts, you don't want things to change to be verified. You need a Lindy effect as well. Coming in. I think that's where the fat protocol thesis really is solid.
00:40:07.350 - 00:40:52.254, Speaker D: As you build up that consensus that this is the most secure chain, the longest chain with most assets on it. But when you come to things like, let's say I'm building the social NFT, I'm building this game, look, if the chain ever gets hacked, we all just agree that like, no, this hacker is not the top player or doesn't hold all the game assets, we know who holds all these game assets, we know who is in the community and we can just fork it and recognize our reality a lot more easily than if I had a financial asset and somebody can go and redeem it for cash or whatever other assets. Right? So perhaps we start to see the kind of lighter applications. Be more of a fat application and more of like the asset heavy, financial heavy, be a bit more protocol heavy fat protocol ish.
00:40:53.154 - 00:41:29.594, Speaker A: That's a really interesting point, because that basically means that, I guess for more financial, serious use cases, then you still very much need that decentralization is everything kind of approach. But when it comes to games, it's less important because most of that is, most of the consensus is, I guess, social. You don't really need tech to enforce it. That's a point that I don't think enough people talk about. So thanks for bringing that up. And I know we're running out of time here, so I want to make sure that at the final part of our interview here, we give you a chance to shout out any companies that you guys are excited about, portfolio companies that you recently invested in. So just take it away, guys.
00:41:30.694 - 00:41:36.794, Speaker C: Oh, okay. We each choose a favorite. There's so many. We love them all.
00:41:37.214 - 00:41:42.314, Speaker A: Anything that comes to mind, maybe a recent investment or any investment that you talked to recently.
00:41:43.494 - 00:42:26.390, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one company comes to mind is leet protocol, or just because I met them in Austin and the memory is still very fresh. So what lead protocol does is they link unchained conditions to off chain access, off chain NFT use case. So one of the use cases they are developing is actually work. We say Shopify. So if you hold a certain type of, say, doodle right, and then leet protocol will allow you to gain access to the token gated Shopify shop to buy merch and stuff like that. Of course, it's a relatively simple use case, but that really brings a lot of potential possibilities. Lead protocol is different in a way that they try to decentralize this network.
00:42:26.390 - 00:42:38.548, Speaker C: So the access conditions gets kind of split up and stored in different nodes, make it truly decentralized. So we're pretty excited about the traction they're having and the use cases they're building towards.
00:42:38.686 - 00:43:30.204, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I've already mentioned saga before about the chainlets, but I'll throw another one also in this similar vertical of like, NFT infrastructure, which is smart token labs. So they have token script technology and also their own alpha wallet. What they want to do is to actually, like I said before, introduce this more digital economy concept to NFts as well achieve some of the similar effects as what you could with lit. So they've done ticketing for FIFA World cup. They've introduced some of the derivative clothing for bored apes as well with Nifty Taylor. So I do see that it unlocks a lot of new surface area for new goods and services to be built using many of the IP or many of the NFT assets that are existing. And they don't have to be on chain even they can be exist in your website and web two or the physical world as well.
00:43:31.324 - 00:43:56.944, Speaker A: Those really interesting companies, I don't think they are very well known in the mainstream yet, so I'm excited to learn more about them and then I will definitely include those in the show notes below.
