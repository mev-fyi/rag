00:00:46.326 - 00:01:32.120, Speaker B: That's why I decided to create blockchains vip to share with you all the heavy research that goes on behind the scenes. Now, every week or so, our team prepares an in depth research memo with things like sector analysis, technical concepts made simple, in depth competitor breakdown, and even interactive models so you can learn about the most important projects before they become important. And our team is putting in hours every week, scouring discord, twitter, forums and blogs to help you get an edge in crypto and understand the latest projects and themes at the deepest levels. That goes way beyond just an interview. Now, in addition, we'll also host exclusive AMA's with myself to answer any of your questions. So all of these are only available to blockchain's VIP subscribers. And the good news is that while our interviews will always be free, the VIP tier costs less than one copy a day.
00:01:32.120 - 00:01:38.164, Speaker B: So head on over to theBlockcrunch.com VIP or click the link in the show notes below to sign up.
00:01:38.904 - 00:02:15.702, Speaker A: All right, hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrench podcast. Now, we're doing this episode in a very interesting time as exchanges seem to be kind of falling left and right. But I'm really excited to talk about something more positive today than what's happening in the centralized exchange space. And I have with me today my friend and also mentor at Tangent Mabel, to talk about two of the big developments that has come to one of the largest lifestyle apps in crypto today, which is Stepn. Previously we did an episode on Stepn. We did a report on Stepn as well. But after that they've made a few strides, including a thing called door, and then also a thing called more, which we're going to dive into that.
00:02:15.702 - 00:02:36.324, Speaker A: The reason why I think it's really interesting is because it has actual implications for how people will build in crypto in the long term, what it means to verticalize your own application and what layer of the stack should investors be focusing on in the long term? So there are a lot of interesting topics we can pull from Stepn's latest developments. So I'm really, really excited to have Mabel on. So welcome to the show again, Mabel.
00:02:36.824 - 00:02:41.872, Speaker C: Thank you. This is probably my third time on the show. Very excited to be back.
00:02:42.048 - 00:02:43.440, Speaker A: I think it's your third or fourth.
00:02:43.472 - 00:02:45.032, Speaker C: Because we've done 4th. 4th?
00:02:45.088 - 00:02:53.364, Speaker A: Yeah, we've done a few before as well. But for people who are not familiar with Stepn, I think most people probably are if they're listening to the show.
00:02:53.484 - 00:02:55.384, Speaker B: But what exactly is Stepn?
00:02:56.444 - 00:03:32.198, Speaker C: Yeah, so I will just kick off with a very brief description about it. It's a web3 lifestyle app with social and game elements. People like to say things around Gamefi or social fi. I felt like those are just things that I don't think how I could explain very well. So when I tell people, we just, you know, I just tell them that this is something that with social and game elements, so TLDR people can earn a bit of return as they run, as they move. So that's like what we do. And then within the app, it has a dual token system as well as the NFTs.
00:03:32.198 - 00:04:37.308, Speaker C: And then with the NFT, there's different metrics and parameters within the NFT that allows you to optimize different aspects of the sneaker and then help you to earn or maybe like have fun with it. A lot of people who play this during this, probably almost a year since we launched. We launched last year, December, we felt like a lot of people were just making friends online and offline through a bunch of meetups and also just getting to know each other through the community. So I think it's generally very interesting movement that we are seeing, that we are onboarding quite a few users through the app, especially for a lot of them. First of all, it's like they never really like to move, and now they're incentivized to move. The other aspect is that they learn about how you can leverage across blockchain in a very simple way. They understand, oh, you need to actually have gases, you need to have the sea phrases and whatnot in order to use and interact with blockchain in the most simple way.
00:04:37.308 - 00:04:40.744, Speaker C: So I think that's really summarized what Stepn is.
00:04:41.524 - 00:05:26.100, Speaker A: Yeah, and it's core Stepn. I personally used Stepn before as well. So basically, people can walk around with these kind of NFT sneakers and they can earn tokens. And I think a core kind of critique that people have for Stepn, and also games like Stepn, or apps like stepn, is that if you incentivize usage by printing tokens, it's not sustainable over time. But despite that, despite the rewards dwindling over time, there's still, I think, 100,000 monthly active users on the Solana chain for Stepn. And then there's almost kind of one to 2000 new users every month. So I guess especially in this bear market, we've seen the rewards kind of starting from people earning like thousands of dollars a day now, I think maybe a dollar a day or so on.
00:05:26.100 - 00:05:30.864, Speaker A: Despite this kind of decrease, what is still pulling in new people into the game, you think?
00:05:32.354 - 00:06:12.656, Speaker C: Yeah, I think. Okay, so going back to numbers first. So I would like to provide a bit more nuance on the numbers that you just mentioned. I think on chain number is actually quite different from the actual in app metrics that we have every day. So we do have see the drops, we have seen a drop of on chain users, because obviously with the tokens drops, people are not as interested in just keep mining and selling every day. So rather a lot of them, they decided to reinvest in the game or just have fun with it, rather than just thinking about monetize it every day. So that's why there's a huge drop of the on chain data.
00:06:12.656 - 00:07:32.548, Speaker C: So actually right now, within the app, like people who ever have a delta of their asset every day, it's still around 500, 600k DAU. So what that means like you run a little bit every day, or maybe made some money or you mint something, or if you have some transactions within the internal marketplace, all of these actions, whatever, that have a quote unquote delta within the asset, we consider those people as Dau within the app. So for that we previously had at peak was around 1 million, and then it dropped very low to significantly less than what I just described, and now bounced back slightly to the number that I just told you. So I think the on chain number is actually quite different from the enact number. I just want to clarify this first. And I think the reason why there still are people interested in coming in is just because I think lifestyle, if we call it lifestyle app, it actually has a component of gamified things where people can actually spend time with their families and friends and then have some fun with the app itself. So I think that is one of the reason why a lot of people at the beginning, when they first saw step in in December and January, they got hooked.
00:07:32.548 - 00:08:04.396, Speaker C: I actually don't think it's because of the money making effect, but obviously, fast forward to march and April. It became much more lucrative. So I have to say, sure, a lot of people came in at that time because it was like very money making. They could definitely earn a lot from that. It's very profitable. But I think at the beginning when people came in, they just thought it was fun. And they can use this app as a very good offline social thing to have with their friends and family.
00:08:04.396 - 00:08:48.068, Speaker C: So I think that's really it. And then I think this also encouraged a lot of people to also record their daily life and then share on social media. And then more and more people started to know about it, and then they just want to use it as a way to continuously encourage themselves. And I think right now, for both Solana, actually, all of these different realms, Solana, BNB and Ethereum, if you have a relatively high level sneaker and then you run for 45 minutes or an hour, you can still buy a coffee. I know this was a meme for a little while. Jan said that and people hated it. It was like, oh, I'm not coming to your a game to just buy a coffee.
00:08:48.068 - 00:09:07.144, Speaker C: But I think for a lot of people, they actually enjoy it because now I think everything going back to norms and then, you know that this is not going to be something that you just get back to money within five to seven days or whatever. They actually appreciate that. Like, there's like a very positive feedback loop for them to keep working out. So that's really it.
00:09:07.484 - 00:09:48.584, Speaker A: That's really interesting. I feel like there's so many different levers you can, you can pull in terms of, like, how much tokens to reward to users and kind of which tier of users to really try to optimize for user retention. So I'm sure you guys are doing a lot of that kind of experimentation behind the scenes. And I think one big thing that you guys did since our last interview with Stepn, which was a long time ago already, is to let users earn another token, not just the GST reward token, but also the GMT reward token, which my understanding is that is a governance token as well. So I guess, how has this played out? Like, how has the decision to allow users to earn two different tokens, um, kind of change things at step in, you know? Any lessons from that?
00:09:49.444 - 00:10:47.870, Speaker C: Yeah, so this actually brings back to a discussion around bringing externality to step in. So a lot of people were asking this since almost like, since day one, or maybe not since day one, but definitely, like, since the game started to become very lucrative. And then they were asking the question, like, where does the money come from? And then there was constantly people asking if you are going to bring in external cash flows or whatnot to make sure that this is sustainable. So essentially, this dual token model is something that we presented to the market that we were answering that question. So obviously, I think there are two ways. To begin with, there are two ways to really bring in the externality. One is to find external utilities and other, like, scenarios where you can use the sneakers so that, like, this is not just a utility asset within the game, but also some other sort of representation, which is what we actually have done.
00:10:47.870 - 00:11:55.096, Speaker C: So, like, we work with Atletico de Madrid and then we issue that Genesis sneakers with them as a co branded sneaker. And then the hoarder of those can not only play within Stepnapp, but also go to the matches and watch and, you know, even have, like, vip draws for, for the merch, right? Like, so there are some sort of real world utilities for people, so that people are thinking when they're buying it, they're not just thinking about the sneakers as a speculative asset, but rather it's a thing that they can actually consider a semi collectible because they want to hold it, because there is, like, actual value behind the NFT. That's like one aspect of externality. The other part of externality comes in, like, to answer a question, like, where does the money come from? So let me explain how this whole dual token model works so that you can understand. So right now, we have this classic pool where you can just mine the GST sneakers. Sorry, you can mine the GST with the classic sneakers, like whatever that we had before. And then we have another pool for the GMT earner.
00:11:55.096 - 00:12:46.542, Speaker C: So for the GMT earner, they actually have to attain a separate type of sneakers. The way they attain that sneakers is through burning the classic sneakers. So there creates a constant deflationary force for the classic sneakers to be consumed, so that there's not only inflationary forces coming from the classic sneakers, but also there is deflationary. So there's like, constant support for classic sneakers. So then people who have spent the money to burn the classic sneakers, they can earn the GMT from that pool. So there are constantly a balance between the two pools. Because let's say if this GMT pool only has one or two rainbows, the rainbow sneaker is what we call the GMT earner.
00:12:46.542 - 00:13:35.906, Speaker C: So let's say the rainbow sneakers, there is very few of them. So it means, like, only, like, these two or three people are sharing the whole pool. So then some people will think, oh, this is actually very lucrative for me or profitable for me, so I'm going to go the other side. But this also doesn't last forever, right? Like, sometimes, like, you'll find, okay, like, this GST part is also very profitable. So then you go back. So there's like a constant dynamic balance between the two, and you also create a continuous deflationary force for the GST earner to have the floor price of the sneaker supported by it. So at the end, what us as a team should be answering is how do we create the value for GMT so that people who are mining the GMTs can actually get benefit from it.
00:13:35.906 - 00:14:18.726, Speaker C: So then they will be more motivated to continue to have the rainbow sneakers to keep going. So I think through this dual token model, what we were trying to build is through providing more value to the GMT, we could make the whole step in application sustainable. Because at the end, then the thing that we need to answer, the question we need to answer is just how do we create more scenarios for us to drive more benefits and values going back to GMT? That's why we are doing more, doing door and some other experiments to try to, you know, provide more benefits to the token. I'm not sure if I explain it well, but.
00:14:18.830 - 00:15:15.196, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that's a great segue to talk about more and Dora, which we'll get to in a bit. But I think this is really core, right? Because every time we talk about PDE games like Axie Infinity, the core question any investor asks is who is the natural buyer for the token? We get where the natural supply is coming from the game, or the application is minting the tokens to reward users, but then who is actually supporting the price for the tokens? And I think you kind of covered that very well in terms of creating utility for the tokens. So one of these avenues to create utility is this thing called door, which we should talk about now. And I thought it's really interesting. So to give people a bit of context, door is basically Stepn's own decentralized exchange to facilitate in game token swaps. And prior to building Dor, which is your own Dex, you guys worked with one of the better teams on Solana called Orca, who was building their own Dex and plucked into Stepn. And you guys made the decision to basically cut orca off and then create your own Dex.
00:15:15.196 - 00:15:21.784, Speaker A: So I think that there's a lot of things we can unpack there. But first of all, why did you guys do that? And what was the motivation for that?
00:15:22.764 - 00:16:04.256, Speaker C: Yeah, first of all, we not only used orca, but we also used pancakeswap. And for Ethereum we just started using door to begin with. I mean, it was simple, right? Like we own the front end, we have the traction. So. And then I think we all, we were very familiar with everything with DeFi, and we know that it's not very hard to fork these underlying protocols at the end. What matters for a lot of these DeFi protocols is like where your attraction comes from. So if we are, you know, having, owning the traction, owning whoever that's coming in from our front end, then we felt like we could probably also just also own the underlying protocol.
00:16:04.256 - 00:16:44.760, Speaker C: Because actually right now we haven't really very actively marketed our Dex, the automated market maker, the amm. So most of the traction came from stepn itself. But we do think because there is potential for stepn to continues to grow organically, then we should own the underlying protocol. And then forking a DeFi protocol, especially like a lending or amm, isn't that hard. But I do agree that we should be very mindful of the asset securities, which we are. I think the team, our engineering team is relatively strong. They were able to just to make sure everything of those are all right.
00:16:44.760 - 00:17:07.924, Speaker C: And also we done all the auditing and whatnot. So yeah, it was as simple as that. And I think we also touched upon this last time when we talk with Daryl. We were talking about how DeFi super app may not work, as in, if you're trying to build a bunch of protocols, but if you have one single entry, it is possible to also own the underlying protocol as well.
00:17:09.144 - 00:18:09.220, Speaker A: This is really interesting to me because for a long time investors in crypto talked about fat protocols, basically layer ones, because everything is built on top, it captures all the value. And then I think that logic extends to the base layer building blocks as well. So basic things like decentralized exchange landing protocols, they should capture value from all the applications that plug into them on top. But I think stepn is an example of people thinking about it from the opposite way, which is what if the top layer, the application layer, owns all the value and we just verticalize and cannibalize on whatever is under us? I guess if we have to zoom out a bit, we started to see this happening for different application layer protocols as well. Like DyDX building their own app chain, for instance, injective building their own app chain. So do you expect to see more of this verticalization happening over time? And if so, does that kind of threaten projects like Uniswap or compound that are just like generalized exchanges or lending protocols?
00:18:09.412 - 00:19:13.598, Speaker C: Yeah, I absolutely remember we exactly talked about this and last time, my answer still holds truth. I think this will start as. So I think at the beginning we see curve like, you know, and uniswap, all of these just being very powerful and they actually accumulate a lot of liquidity, right? So especially for curve, like they just plug into everywhere. So that it's very hard for anyone to replace curve right now just because like they were already so plugged in. But I think for our case it's because like we, like I said, we own attraction and then, so if we are providing liquidity, we could choose where to provide, whether it's to orca or to our own amm. So I think what the case of us work is because there was an initial liquidity to begin with, so then we can start with that. But I don't believe that this type of verticalization will just keep going forever, because once a place has a lot of liquidity, I think other liquidity will tend to just join it rather than just building its own.
00:19:13.598 - 00:19:46.484, Speaker C: Right. Otherwise we'll just see all of these recommendation keep going on. But I do think there is some potential for the initial few applications to bootstrap its own liquidity. And then later on, if we were to say, convince other people to use our own, we can tell them that you have liquidity here. Do you want to join us? I think the problem at that time for us to use orca or to use pancake swap was primarily because it's the same for us to provide liquidity anywhere. It doesn't matter. There was an opportunity cost.
00:19:46.484 - 00:20:00.584, Speaker C: That's why we could do that. So I didn't directly answer your question, but I think there's a small window where some of the applications, if they have strong enough traction, they can do that. But I don't think this window will last forever.
00:20:02.004 - 00:20:10.134, Speaker A: Do you think it makes sense? Would you guys offer door to other applications to use as well? Does it make sense for you guys to become like a Dex project almost?
00:20:11.354 - 00:20:41.428, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean like it just be a SDK, right? It is possible for sure. Like that's what we were also thinking of. And also, I would say within more because like we're going to have GMT utility, we are also plugging in door as well. So like you'll see a lot of these, like, just like start to all work together. And I think, you know, not just for, for more, but for some other things that are not within our ecosystem. Whoever wants to have a plugin, they can feel free to use it.
00:20:41.596 - 00:21:09.724, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. Building your own primitives is an interesting approach. And I think another primitive you guys are building, which we should talk about is more, which is the NFT marketplace that you guys are building yourselves. I think this is coming at a really interesting time because obviously a lot of discussions are circling around Opensea's decision recently. So for context, they basically announced that they're building this smart contract that allows new, new NFT collections to enforce royalties on chain. And I think people kind of are of two minds about it.
00:21:09.724 - 00:21:15.824, Speaker A: So before I dive into more, I guess curious what your thoughts are about that and, you know, why is there so much noise around that?
00:21:16.564 - 00:22:17.020, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think the open sea part is already story part two. The story part one was that, you know, x two, y two, and then magic Eden, they all started this optional royalty, right? If you follow Laurie Shin, you'll see like she had a discussion with Droshin, Haseeb and Li Jin about whether royalty is, should continue to exist or not. And then like the flip side of it, like the people who arguing against it is because like they said, oh, royalty is not on chain enforceable. My general take on all of these things is that I think for any users, I don't call them traders because I think going forward, if the whole market expands, it's just going to be on just the traders. So I call them users. So for the users, like, when they consider fees, they don't think about like, okay, marketplace fee versus royalty fee, they actually take those two as just one. Like they consider like the total percentage of fees that they're paying.
00:22:17.020 - 00:23:01.798, Speaker C: So I think there's like an upper limit. They want, they're willing to pay for any marketplace. And then, so the question comes to, like, who should be earning which part of the fee? And I think at the end, it's not a pure technical challenge or obstacle. It's actually a business decision because today, let's say we are at a very competitive market, and then all the users will only be willing to pay two to 3%. Then if OpenSea charges 2.5, then it means those creators can only get 0.5%. This might not be good for the long term because at the end, a lot of the creators, they don't have the initial social consensus around them.
00:23:01.798 - 00:24:15.744, Speaker C: They actually need the initial cash flow to help them continuously bootstrap the community and then keep working. So at the end, it comes like whether the platform is willing to yield their ability to make the money from the users and then yield it to the creators who are weaker than they are, and then treat them as a discovery discoverability platform. So I think that's really my take around that. So I was actually thinking less around like whether, okay, brawl t is on chain enforceable or not, because I think even if there are a lot of on chain aggregators like Gem or some of the other ones, the like, realistic. Well, like what would happen is that a lot of the users, especially, you know, if we look to three to five years, a lot of them may not necessarily go to these on chain aggregators. They would actually just go to places where their attention could reach to or like someone, somewhere they actually are very well aware of, like say opensea or hopefully more could be one of those, right? So at the end, I think if the, it's about the platform's decision whether they want to give the royalty to the creators rather than just like saying, simply saying that it's not enforceable.
00:24:15.784 - 00:24:47.934, Speaker A: And so I guess now there's like two big camps in the big players in the NFT world. There's, as you mentioned, there's x two, I two, there is magic Eden that are not enforcing any royalties. Opensea is trying to make sure creators enforce that on an on chain level. And to my understanding, more is also pro royalties. Can you share more about the decision to, I know you talked about this a little bit, but can you talk more about kind of your decision to want to enforce royalties and why is that beneficial to users?
00:24:48.634 - 00:25:17.894, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. I guess, like before we jump in, I should also explain the basics of more so that it helps the context. Right. So more is a member only multi chain, NFT Marketplace and Launchpad. So what it means is that we charges, we charge membership subscription fee from users and we do not charge any service fee from users trading. It meaning that the, the volume of the NFT trading doesn't matter to us.
00:25:17.894 - 00:26:11.994, Speaker C: It's almost like a Costco model where people just paid entry fee and they just can enjoy the high quality goods, the high quality services, and then all what matters is that the more people trade, their membership tier will go up and then obviously it will benefit when it comes to the launchpad raffle because the higher the membership here, then the higher probability they will get the launch pad. So that's really it. And then we intentionally do not offer the choice of optional royalty. I think that's the context of us. So your questions around, honestly, right now we do not have any technical solution yet for the royalty enforcement. We actually plan to go do that very easily in the future. Basically, you just offer people the right type of min contract.
00:26:11.994 - 00:27:27.944, Speaker C: I can just made it up here because I haven't really discussed with our engineers. But if you want to, you can enforce the Mint contract to be like, if you want to transfer it from one address to another one, you have to pay within the balance of your wallet, like to the initial mint contract so that can be enforced. But then that also hurts the like, it's probably not the same kind of NFT as we are thinking today, but what I'm trying to say is like technically level, it's definitely doable if we want to do something like that. But right now it's just as simple as a platform wide decision where we do not offer the button for people to do the optional royalty payment, they have to do it. And then for users who are trying to get higher membership, they also won't get the counting if they are trading on the 0%, the royalty. And that's because we want to avoid people from just watch trading to get higher membership tier. So yeah, I think that's quite simple and I think that the key decision, I would say rationale behind this decision is that we do think a lot of users, sorry, a lot of creators, like I said, they do not have a lot of social consensus around them when they started off.
00:27:27.944 - 00:28:05.358, Speaker C: And it's actually very unhealthy from my perspective. A lot of these collections, they're just starting off as a very high primary sale price because it means there might not be as much turnover after their first initial sales and then maybe that collection just died down in one week. It's very similar to a lot of these secondary market trading. You have very high market cap launch and then it hurts all the retail who participated because I don't have to explain, you understand what I'm talking about. So same idea. Like look at Yuga Labs. Like they launched at a, it's Freeman at the beginning and it took a very long time for them to build their social consensus.
00:28:05.358 - 00:28:39.024, Speaker C: So like having royalty, having a low primary sales, initial starting point, it's actually good for the community because it will enable a very slow and organic community growth. It would also encourage the builder, the creator to continuously building on the community because like they know that their income is going to matter for them for the long term. If they don't work on it, then they won't be able to get turnover and also royalty. So I think that's something just behind that. I won't explain.
00:28:39.404 - 00:28:48.784, Speaker A: And just to clarify, it sounds like you guys will be offering more as a marketplace for any type of NFT creator. Is it just for buying and selling sneakers or is it any NFT at all?
00:28:49.684 - 00:29:03.564, Speaker C: It's not related to sneaker. I mean, right now we are focusing on PFP, IP oriented nfts. I can explain why, but it's generic NFT marketplace. It's generalized NFT marketplace.
00:29:04.344 - 00:29:22.004, Speaker A: And how does that, I guess, what was the decision to start that? Because for the tech side, it makes a lot of sense. There's already a lot of swaps happening for GST, GMT, and you guys already have that happening. But it sounds like this NFT market, it sounds like almost like a different company or a different part. Like, how does that fit into the broader step in plans?
00:29:22.424 - 00:30:18.458, Speaker C: Yeah, I can definitely share that. So it actually, the whole mentality behind having this NFT marketplace is actually quite similar to how we think about the relationship between step in and the Dex. I'll have this one sentence to begin with. So everything that we do, we are trying to drive more value into GMT. Going back to the point about making step into ST, like having GMT have more valuable would definitely make sure this game keeps going for a long time because of the dual token system. So then, like I said, step in is a front end and then the Dex is a underlying settlement layer. So I think we have the same vision where we are seeing owning more as the NFT marketplace is the settlement layer, the value settlement layer, but that's for NFT.
00:30:18.458 - 00:31:22.480, Speaker C: And then on top of that, we are foreseeing ourselves to have other front ends. That's driving traction to the NFT marketplace. But I think what's quite different here is that we do believe that in the future, there will be a lot of web3 applications that are just bootstrapping themselves, starting from the IP genesis PFP collection. Like they're just building something similar to Stepn. They have a very well rounded plan for building some sort of application, but at the beginning, they would have to issue a set of NFT to bootstrap their community. So we think of more as just the very beginning of their roadmap, and we want to enable people to issue their own projects starting from more. So I think the way we think of more is that we build this shopify and then next year we are actually shipping another front end like application, which is the first store on top of the shopify.
00:31:22.480 - 00:31:50.294, Speaker C: But we do want to encourage people in the long term to add more other kind of stores on top of the shopify. So that's why I'm saying the mentality is quite similar to the Dex. We did this Dex as also Shopify step in as the first store and we want to encourage more stores open up on the decks. So I think like that two thread goes in parallel. I hope this helps explaining how we are thinking about our vision.
00:31:50.954 - 00:32:18.544, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that kind of that makes sense and tying everything together. I think one kind of definitely advocate take is I've seen just from working with different projects in the past when they expand their product scope, especially when they build things that are maybe synergistic with their core product but not 100% relevant or 100% the same, it spreads the resources a lot and it's hard for them to monitor everything. So how do you guys manage a Dex NFT marketplace and a popular lifestyle app at the same time?
00:32:18.964 - 00:32:51.044, Speaker C: Yeah, it's not an easy effort. One way to manage the resources that we shard all our engineering resources. So each team in terms of engineering side is separate. Like we have a team for step in, we have a team for the Dex and we have a team for more. And those are not like whenever one is working on one thing, it's not taking the other one's resources, otherwise it's going to be impossible to because you have to maintain the step in like daily development. Right. Like there's a lot of updates.
00:32:51.044 - 00:33:23.454, Speaker C: Like we have to continue to do so. Like it's not taking each other's resources. On the marketing side, we are still trying to figure out our best, best way to optimize everything because like right now we share, we do share the same BD team and marketing team. But I think in terms of the product development side, we do have a very clear angle since the very beginning. We understand that it's not going to be possible that if one team is building everything, it's not going to work. So I think in terms of engineering side, we had that. That's why we were able to ship all of these together at the same time.
00:33:23.454 - 00:33:36.614, Speaker C: Like you have to. I don't want to like, you know, joke about this, but I think a lot of the engineer, the asian engineers, they are very capable and they ship very fast and I think that's one of the edge that we have.
00:33:38.074 - 00:34:08.084, Speaker A: You know, I'm just curious because, you know, I kind of expected that eventually step in would do their own Dex. I didn't expect the NFT part, but I thought the way that would happen is you guys might actually go and acquire some of the Solana teams that are, you know, under a lot of stress in the bear market. Maybe you buy out, like, Orca, or maybe you buy out some of their Solana decks. And I thought, okay, this is probably something that's like four or five years down the line when you guys are much, much bigger. So I'm curious, like, in terms of timing, why do this, like, split now? Why start all these different arms now?
00:34:08.824 - 00:35:12.842, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think that goes back to the question of how do we drive value back to GMT, right? We need to find places that actually can generate very stable revenue that can, like, support GMT. So the short answer to that, all of those is just that. And I think if you do ask me, like, why we want to do it now, it's also because, like I said, I think a lot of the new generation web3 applications, they are not going to just have the fungible token. They actually might have their initial bootstrapping mechanism as issuing their IP oriented or PFP oriented collection. So I think the way we think of more launchpad is beyond a PFP collection Launchpad, it's actually a place for a lot of the teams who wants to build applications to put themselves up to the public as their first step. We want people to discover all of these teams in their early nascent stage and then grow with all of these teams.
00:35:12.842 - 00:35:54.428, Speaker C: And then all of these teams might have their own vision of building something like a usable product, like step in itself, but then they want to bootstrap their initial community, and then we want the, the more launch pad to be that discoverability platform. So that's really why. And we do think right now bear market is the right time to build because, like, a lot of the noises are going to fade away and then people would actually know or think about what could actually be built during this time. It's like, think about, like, Binance Launchpad. I don't want to draw this parallel, but I do think finance. Launchpad also started 2019 January, and that's the deepest beer. I actually think this could be a very interesting opportunity for us.
00:35:54.428 - 00:35:58.444, Speaker C: It's going to be an asymmetric one, but I think it's also a good bet.
00:35:59.504 - 00:36:24.024, Speaker A: And one thing that I really want to touch on with more as well is that unlike a kind of two and a half percent service fee like Opensea, you guys are actually the first NFT marketplace to have a subscription fee instead of a service fee. So what exactly is the, because I've never seen a business model like this where you charge a subscription fee to a marketplace. So what inspired that and why does it make sense?
00:36:24.844 - 00:37:26.270, Speaker C: Yeah, so this is just a SaaS model, right? It's very simple. Like we don't go as the volume goes, like we want to make sure that we create our network effect, not through charging the ground where the plants are growing out of, but rather we want to enable all of these plants to grow on top of it. And then like at the end, I think I keep mentioning this sentence, but I do really like it. I think attention is the only scariest commodities in this world. As long as you get the attention, you would be able to do a lot of things. That's something you just can't easily get if you are following other people's model. I think the way we think of it is that we want to provide this infrastructure to people first to make sure that they, they can easily find the best projects, the best application, not even just project, because I think a lot of the token, quote unquote project, the fungible token projects, are protocol level stuff.
00:37:26.270 - 00:38:13.670, Speaker C: We specifically want to focus more on the application side. We want people to find those and then don't have to worry about having the trading fee just because this is the place we want them to, by default, go to. And on the other side, we also want to make sure that the creators, the app builders, they can make their first bucket of money from here. Just because like we do understand that bootstrapping the initial social consensus is very, very hard. And I think like if you have, I mean, it's as simple as if you have 1 million users, your, your monthly subscription fee, it's already quite lucrative. Like it's, it's not a whale business, let's put it this way. It's a large volume of people that you're onboarding.
00:38:13.670 - 00:38:22.074, Speaker C: It matters if you have a lot of people who are using your platform. I think it's just how you make the numbers count.
00:38:23.014 - 00:38:34.280, Speaker A: Wouldn't it make it harder to convince people to use the platform if OpenSea or x two, y two, or these other exchanges out there are free for them to use? I guess free upfront, quote unquote, you're.
00:38:34.312 - 00:38:42.688, Speaker C: Talking about like they are, they're not charging or you're saying like they're going to subsidize people with 0% marketplace fee or. What do you mean?
00:38:42.736 - 00:38:52.728, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So if they are, I guess, is it a bigger friction to charge like a subscription fee or is it a bigger friction to charge a 2.5% service fee? I guess is the.
00:38:52.816 - 00:39:53.610, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I get what you're saying. So I think it's quite simple. If you are showing to people the first few batches of your launchpad, the first few seasons of your launchpad is very successful, then people will be able to think of it. But I think for Openseer, for some of the traditional marketplace, I think their target audience is just the native users, a lot of those. Because I think if you are trading nfts, then if there's no purpose for people to trade those nfts, but rather just flipping it or whatever, they will just go to place where they don't have to pay a subscription fee. But I think for ourselves, I think we think of us beyond just a NFT collection launchpad, if that makes sense. I think it's more of a people, we want to make sure that people understand that this is something that they're getting access to, a place where they can discover the next generation, high quality applications.
00:39:53.610 - 00:40:33.164, Speaker C: I think that's a bit different. Different. And also I think subscription model is very, very prominent in the traditional space. I think I generally have a problem of understanding why would web3 industry adopt the traditional model. But sometimes it's actually not a bad idea to go with something that's actually more around mass adoption. Because I think when it comes to membership, at the end, you don't have to do the traditional, you can do also do just providing NFT, like soul bound nfTs, you can make it very crypto native. It's like token gated community almost.
00:40:33.164 - 00:41:20.014, Speaker C: And I think making sure that your people understand that what you're providing is high quality, then you can gradually get people in. I mean, at the end, we're not just talking about the crypto world today. We're talking about there are still a lot of people who are yet to be onboarded. And I think the way that a lot of people to be on board, it's just like how many other people who were onboarded by step in, which is like they have a very simple purpose, like they can use the app and then where did they find the app? Then you come to the more marketplace. I think that's just one simple, small goal that we have. I also am not 100% confident this will work, but I think this is something that we want to try to innovate and then make sure that people at least entertain with it.
00:41:20.594 - 00:41:26.494, Speaker A: That makes sense. And how much is the subscription fee? Like, if I want to use the more marketplace right now. How much do I have to pay?
00:41:26.794 - 00:42:11.894, Speaker C: Right now it's all free. Like next week if you list something on top of the marketplace we're going to gift you. But then after promotional period it's going to be 29.9. So let me do a calc for you. So if you trade a board ape on Opensea that one single transaction, the transaction fee for that is going to pay your five year membership for more focus of the percentage. So I'm just saying that if you are trading once a year for a twelve ETH or more NFT, then you're already making back the whole subscription fee. So I think like for some people I think that the math makes sense.
00:42:11.894 - 00:42:28.134, Speaker C: But I agree with you, right. You're gating them. So it's not necessarily gonna work for everyone. But the bet which is that like if you could start from the launchpad then like you know, there are gonna be new people on boarded through it.
00:42:28.554 - 00:42:36.974, Speaker A: Do you think that will end up attracting a lot of whales then? Since it makes a lot of sense for whales trading large nfts. But if you're buying like a ten dollar NFT, it might not make sense.
00:42:37.324 - 00:43:20.700, Speaker C: Yeah, that's also true. That's also true. But then, you know, the experience of doing step in was that we found often time you do have to attract the crypto inner cycle inner circle people before you onboard everyone else. Right. And also I think it's just that when it comes to like, you know, a lot of the projects like I said, right. We don't want to monetize from the the ground but we want to monetize or like build our network effect from the plants that growing out of this ground. So like our hope was that, you know, some of these applications that we are launching through launchpad like they can also grow into some sort of large thing and then bring in their users or their community members for us.
00:43:20.700 - 00:43:22.784, Speaker C: So I think it's like a win win process.
00:43:23.084 - 00:43:55.044, Speaker A: That's interesting because initially when I first saw the announcement that you guys are charging $30 a month for a marketplace, I was like who's going to use this? Like I'm just open. See, but then once you mention that example, like the fact that if I trade one, you know, top 30 NFT once it already pays for like a few years, it is a really smart go to market and I'm really excited to see when it takes off. So I guess when it comes to the last part of this, what, what is the status on all of these things? So on door, is it live right now on more? You know, when, when are you guys gonna start charging for, for users?
00:43:55.824 - 00:44:36.096, Speaker C: Yeah, so for door it's like for the three chains, it's all live. Like we are all using um, the door for BnB realm, for ethereum realm and for Solana, we haven't really actively looked for partners just because like we discussed, like we need to have some priority and we determine the priority is not to onboard people to our using our Dex SDK. So right now the only client, quote unquote, obviously there is a web browser UI for door. But I would say most of the traction comes from step in and I think we are fine with that. With more. We are going to start charging it from like. Well, I wouldn't say start charging it.
00:44:36.096 - 00:45:32.956, Speaker C: We'll say we open the payment subscription for people starting from mid November and then we are going to start with the crypto stream payment, which is like extremely crypto native way to do it. I think a lot of people who are using the stream like streamflow or maybe superfluid, they are just using it for the salary payment. But there aren't that many membership subscription in crypto world for some reason. But I think this is the perfect place for us to use that application. So we are going to use some of these stream payment solutions for the payment. I do want to mention one small point that I don't think I have mentioned yet is that for Launchpad, we are also using a very innovative way to engage with more community members. What we are doing is that we are going to do it in a very hackathon way where we are going to, obviously there are going to be a lot of submissions and then we are going to pre screen a little bit.
00:45:32.956 - 00:46:33.794, Speaker C: But just like every single one of the other hackathon, you would also have to go through the pre screening process. But once we go through that, we'll display all the relatively prominent projects for people to vote. Then people are able to browse through all of these different applications or maybe some NFT collections that they want to to vote for and then they're going to vote with GMT. So each member will have a 10,000 GMT cap for each account. So what this does is that like we want to kind of bring both the law, like the exchange launch pad model and the hackathon model together. Because like, I think both you and I have seen the success of Solana hackathon, but we saw all of these prominent projects on Solana which actually came out of the solana hackathon right? Like mangle Soland or some, like even orca or some of the other ones. We found this is a very good model for someone who never had any community exposure but have a good product to get attention.
00:46:33.794 - 00:47:30.454, Speaker C: So we want to adopt that, and then we want to make sure that when people are doing these voting, it's actually the first round of community exposure or social consensus accumulation for these projects. So we thought it's going to be a win win process for everyone to be in this process, get a lot of attention from the voting process, and then the community will also be able to see a bunch of different projects across. For example, if you're the core community member of one project, you would also be able to see the other things. So then the other projects are also getting exposure from some of the attention that wasn't supposed to be their public audiences. So I think it's going to be a win win process for a lot of these community members as well as the projects. And then after a period of time where people finish their voting, we'll just reveal everything. And then people will see who's number one and be in the launchpad.
00:47:30.454 - 00:47:43.494, Speaker C: Obviously, whoever within the process, they will get minted. But then obviously the number one winner will get the most traction from the more platform. So that's one thing I do want to add on.
00:47:44.274 - 00:48:12.270, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah. That's really exciting. I didn't realize that was already. Door was already live on three chains as well. So that's awesome. I think these conversations are the conversations that I think the most interesting in bear market because everybody's kind of talking about how crypto is dead, but then in the background you have people kind of trying out new models like this. So really appreciate you for coming on again for providing us with this content for people who want to, who for some reason are not following you already.
00:48:12.270 - 00:48:13.634, Speaker A: Where can they go?
