00:00:00.800 - 00:00:31.800, Speaker A: You're now listening to Alpha Leak, a podcast miniseries highlighting the most under the radar projects and developments in crypto. And this series is brought to you by the Blockcrunch podcast. I'm your host, Jason Choi. I'm a general partner at Spartan Capital and an active Defi angel investor. Nothing on this show should be construed as financial advice, and my guests, myself and my employer may hold positions and assets discussed on the show. And if you'd like for your project to be featured on this series, reach out to me on Twitter mrjasonchoi. Today's Alpha leak is brought to you by perpetual protocol, Figment, and Aave.
00:00:31.952 - 00:01:03.644, Speaker B: Alright, hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of Blockcrunch, Alpha Leak. I'm very, very excited to talk about one of the teams that I've been the most excited about in Defi, and that is the Alpha finance lab team. And the reason why we're bringing them on again on Alpha Leak is because they're launching a completely new product called the Alpha Launchpad. And by the time this episode comes out, the product should have been live. So I'm very excited to have the founder of Alpha Finance Lab, Tasha, on the show once again to talk to us about Alpha and Alpha Launchpad. So welcome back to the show.
00:01:03.984 - 00:01:21.004, Speaker C: Thanks so much, Jason. Yeah, we've been really excited about this. We've been building Alpha launchpad for quite a while now, under the hood pretty much, and now it's out for the community, and we're really excited to see what we can build from the Alpha launchpad.
00:01:21.734 - 00:01:46.194, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And I'd love to kind of start by just giving our listeners a sense of what Alpha is, because it's not like a lot of Defi projects where it's one single product, like just one amm or one lending pool. It's supposed to be a collection of many different products, and you guys are incubating own projects as well. So can you help us understand, for people who are just hearing about Alpha for the first time, what this project is and what are you guys trying to achieve?
00:01:46.594 - 00:02:47.264, Speaker C: Sure. So think of Alpha Finance Lab as a Defi lab. We are building a number of Defi products under what we call the Alpha ecosystem. So you can think of it as alpha ecosystem consisting of a number of alpha products. These alpha products within alpha ecosystem, the main theme that we're focusing on is pretty much related to how do we making sure that multiple products work together to maximize returns while minimizing downside risks for users. So that's only one part of Alpha Finance Lab, another part which is related to Alpha Launchpad, is that in order for us to be a full fledged defi lab and not only just grow the Alpha finance lab, but also help grow the whole Defi ecosystem out even further, we're launching this incubator program called Alpha Launchpad. And through Alpha launchpad incubator program, we are incubating a number of new Defi projects.
00:02:47.264 - 00:03:40.476, Speaker C: So these new Defi projects that we're incubating will have their own ecosystem. So now you will see that there are two sets of ecosystems within Alpha Finance Lab, right? One is the alpha ecosystem consisting of alpha products that we built. The other is the ecosystem that we incubate through the Alpha launchpad. So from all of these, these two, you know, parts, two key parts of Alpha Finance lab, we call it the Alpha universe. And I think having that, you know, high level understanding really is really key to understand Alpha Finance lab as a whole. And the reason that we structure our project this way is mostly, you know, because of how we see DeFi, right? Like, we know that DeFi is going to be here for the long term. And we also know that DeFi is still really young and nascent in its stage right now.
00:03:40.476 - 00:04:21.684, Speaker C: So there are going to be a lot of significant changes going on with DeFi, right? With more regulatory landscape impact, with more bulls and bears market going through different cycles. And we know that because of all these changes, DeFi will change a lot because of those things. So we have to be able to adapt according to the market quickly. And by having this model being a DeFi lab, building our own products, incubating different ecosystem, we'll make sure that Alpha Finance Lab will remain one of the top ecosystem in DeFi at every moment, no matter where DeFi is in its industry cycle.
00:04:22.584 - 00:05:13.140, Speaker B: Yeah. And I really empathize with that vision because for Defi, it's really existed for maybe two years, maybe three years, if you count in the beginning of Makerdao. And the landscape for Defi has changed so much that I've seen for every uniswap, for every sushi swap out there, there's two dozen or three dozen other projects that have tried to build one product, which quickly became obsolete within six months. But at the end of the day, a lot of these teams were able to pivot. And even if you look at the so called blue chips, Aave, even synthetix, they both pivoted from projects that were completely different. So I think having this structure where you're building this team of brilliant people building different products over time and evolving with the market makes a lot of sense to me. And I'd love to kind of touch on the first product that you guys shipped.
00:05:13.140 - 00:05:50.464, Speaker B: Right, Alpha Homora, which is the yield farming levered yield farming product. Now, at the peak, I think there was over a billion dollars in deposits. And right now, after the market correction, there's still a whopping $800 million there. And that's incredible for a protocol that's less than a year old. Now. However, there was an event, I think, a few months back, where there was some sort of an exploit between alpha and cream. So can you, before we kind of dive into Alpha launchpad and some of the newer features, can you help our listeners understand kind of what happened there and what were some of the steps that you guys took afterwards to take care of that?
00:05:50.924 - 00:06:09.656, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. And quickly. Quick. Note that the total value log now across Alpha humora product is actually 1.4 billion at the moment. Yeah. So I think that speaks a lot to the value it brings and the new category that we created, which is the Le Reggie farming that you mentioned.
00:06:09.656 - 00:06:41.960, Speaker C: So back to cream. Right. So I think a lot of the problems that we saw came from the complications that Alpha Homer v two has, as opposed to alpha v one. The reason that we made it a lot more complicated is because we wanted to scale a lot bigger. So if you look into. If you compare alpha hammer v two to alpha hammer v one, right. You see that there are so many more functionalities that v two can do and v one cannot.
00:06:41.960 - 00:07:20.734, Speaker C: For instance, you can borrow stable coins, you can borrow many other assets, not only limited to ease. So that's one difference already. The second difference is there are many amms that alpha hammer v two works with right now. It works with uniswap v two, kerf balancer and sushiswap. And number three, it can also work with many more amms. So from the high level, because of all these functionalities, scalability that we want to put in, in the end, the code gets to be pretty complicated. And unfortunately, the exploit happened back in February.
00:07:20.734 - 00:08:05.284, Speaker C: And once the exploit happened, we took actions right away. So we make sure that all the contracts are stopped and making sure that we clear everything from the smart contract re auditing to rewriting a number of pieces in the contract layer. We also got peer reviews by many of the top tier, not audit firms, because that's considered under the audit category. But this is the smart contract researchers that are really active in the space. For instance, Samsung, who's really respected in the space. So we got a number of security measures put in place. So in total, Alpha humor v two was audited by three firms, Techshield, Quantstem and Openceplin.
00:08:05.284 - 00:08:33.092, Speaker C: So that's on the security side. And we also published a pretty extensive blog on the new security measures that we have put in place. So just to give a quick run through. Number one is definitely multiple audits by top firms. Number two is peer reviews by respected people in the space. Number three is internal review, of course. Number four is monitoring tools.
00:08:33.092 - 00:09:46.996, Speaker C: These are the ones that will really alarm us if anything happens ahead of time. Number four is active bug bounty program. So we also have worked with immunify and armor to make sure that whenever we push new line of code, it's being pushed out to the whole community of developers in the space to help become white hacker or what hacker means is to really help find the loophole and then report back to us. So we have put all of these in place since February. And right now our Fahomer V two has relaunched since May and we have been pretty happy with the performance so far and also going forward in terms of the funds side, we also work with cream to ensure that there is no impact on the user's end, because whatever happened to the event, there's actually no real impact on the user's end. Because how Iron bank or the cream v. Two lending protocol works with Alpha Homer V two is that it's structured in more of a b two b lending.
00:09:46.996 - 00:10:31.228, Speaker C: So you can think of it as one firm lending to another firm. So as a result, Alpha Homer V two is paying back to cream V two, as opposed to having users to pay back directly to cream V two. And the way that we're paying back to Iron bank or cream V two right now is through a portion of the protocol fees that we collect. So across all the protocol fees that we have collected and going to collect going forward, we are taking 20% of those fees to consistently pay back to cream. So I would say it's the most optimal solution. No impact on users. There's a mechanism to put in place to repay the funds back.
00:10:31.228 - 00:10:47.784, Speaker C: We're deep partner with Cream and have been working with them consistently. So the relationship is also still pretty good. And I would say the crisis management has been, in my opinion, has been pretty good. But yeah, happy to answer any more questions.
00:10:47.864 - 00:11:35.136, Speaker A: Now, before we continue, I'd like to take a moment to share some exciting companies that made this podcast possible. One of my absolute favorite products in crypto is Aave Aave is a non custodial liquidity protocol, meaning you can earn interest on your crypto or borrow crypto assets without trusting any centralized counterparty to hold your funds. I personally have been using Aave for a long time to earn up to 12% of my USD holdings like USDC USDT or even decentralized stablecoins like Dai or exchange stablecoins like Binance USD, which totally blows my bank out the water. And if you're new to crypto and worried about security, Aave has been audited by security firms 13 times in 2020 alone and ones already this year, which they disclosed fully. So I'm really excited to have a product that I love as a sponsor. So go on over to aave.com aave.com
00:11:35.136 - 00:11:45.560, Speaker A: to check out which of the assets you'd like to borrow and lend. Today I'd like to talk about our sponsor, perpetual protocol. If you're worried about leaving your funds on an exchange that may be hacked but you are also tired of paying.
00:11:45.592 - 00:11:47.136, Speaker B: For hundreds of dollars in gas fees.
00:11:47.160 - 00:12:30.382, Speaker A: In defi, you should really check them out because they have built a fully on chain exchange on Ethereum and Xdai that allows up to ten x leverage. Now, they've also released zero gas deposits in addition to near zero gas fees for trading. And if you're paranoid about smart contract exploits like I am, don't worry, because they have also obtained protocol level insurance via nexus mutual and unslashed finance to provide automatic coverage for all traders on perp exchange. Now today for users outside the US, if you have an Ethereum address, you can already start using perp exchange with no signups. So go to perp exchange blockcrunch to check it out. That's perp exchange blockcrunch. I'm also proud to call Figmin a sponsor of the show.
00:12:30.382 - 00:13:08.684, Speaker A: If you are an investor wanting to manage all your proof of stake assets in a single place, you definitely don't want to miss this. Figmin makes it simple for you to generate returns on your digital assets by managing all your proof of stake investments in one place. Their fully managed staking infrastructure and detailed user dashboards give investors the edge they need to stay ahead of the curve. Figment has some of the widest coverage in the proof of stake market, supporting over 30 mainnet blockchains like Polkadot, Cosmos, Nier, the graph, and celo. So it doesn't matter if you're an individual investor or you manage a fund, Figment is easily the go to solution for everything related to proof of stake in your portfolio. So check them out in the show notes below.
00:13:09.144 - 00:13:56.986, Speaker B: I think this case study was so overlooked, but it's actually so consequential for DeFi because this is one of the first times that there is an inner protocol borrowing where alpha was borrowing from another protocol called cream, and there was a default. And the default is paid by, you know, future fees earned, part of the future fees earned on alpha back to cream. And so this is completely between protocols. And I think a lot of people in DeFi understand the concept of interacting with DeFi protocols. Right. I'm using uniswap, I'm using compound, but this kind of inner protocol borrowing and default and the subsequent kind of payback schedule, this is something that is, I think, to me, sounds really futuristic, and we can spend another episode on that. But I definitely want to make sure that we have time to talk about the new product that's coming out as well.
00:13:56.986 - 00:14:07.106, Speaker B: So you mentioned the launch of Alpha Launchpad, which will be incubating different projects. So can you help us understand what does incubating mean in Alpha's terms?
00:14:07.290 - 00:14:54.624, Speaker C: Yeah. The reason that we came up with this is we saw that there are so many things that new Defi projects have to get right the first time they launch, to make sure that they launch successfully and then get the product market fit right away. Right. So, for instance, just to give you some context, they need to be able to identify the right problem, fine tune the product market fit, figuring out the tech to do that in the most secure and optimized way and the most simple way. Right. And also that's on the tech side, but also on the business and marketing side. There are many other things that they have to know from growth, hacking tactics, investors relations, community building.
00:14:54.624 - 00:15:40.646, Speaker C: So the list goes on. And we realize that we don't want to only build our own products. We also want to incubate more DeFi projects that will also not only help the whole DeFi ecosystem, but also bring a lot of growth to Alpha Finance lab. And how that works is that all the points and all the categories that I mentioned earlier are all the things that we're going to mentor and guide the incubator projects through. So you can think of it as the incubator projects being incubated by Alpha Launchpad. They're getting the recipe and playbook to launch and grow successfully from our experience and from our know how. So that's what they get.
00:15:40.646 - 00:16:29.594, Speaker C: Right? What Alpha Finance lab is getting in terms of, you know, the whole alpha community are a number of things. One is that these incubator projects will live under the hood of Alpha universe. So that means that there will be a lot of synergies among different products, between alpha products and these products. So the ecosystem itself would be pretty expensive. So that's number one. Number two is that Alpha stakers will also get a portion of the incubated project's token from just staking Alpha. So that means that when you stake Alpha on tokenomics, Alphafinace IO, you will not only get the protocol fees collected from Alpha Homora and all the alpha products, but you're also getting all the incubator projects token in a certain proportion.
00:16:29.594 - 00:17:10.264, Speaker C: So that will also really bring a lot of value accrual to the alpha holders. The third thing that Alpha community also gets, which also gets pretty interesting, is a portion of the protocol fees from the incubator projects will also accrue back to alpha stakers. So all in all, from building a number of alpha products, from incubating a number of these projects, value accrual will pretty much flow back to alpha token holders and those who stake. And I think that will, that's the vision that we have to grow the alpha community and also grow the whole Defi landscape.
00:17:11.524 - 00:17:17.820, Speaker B: That's interesting. And in terms of these projects that you guys are picking to incubate, what is the criteria for them?
00:17:18.012 - 00:17:52.492, Speaker C: Yeah, so we have hard criteria and also soft criteria. Right. So the hard ones definitely is that, number one, the product is not live yet. Number two, the token is not live yet. Number three, the team is not anonymous because we want to make sure that the team behind the project we incubate are in for the long term and structured in a way that are able to do so. And those are majority. And the last one, the fourth thing is bring synergy to the alpha ecosystem.
00:17:52.492 - 00:18:06.304, Speaker C: So those four items are the hard requirements, and then the soft one really requires us talking to the team, understanding their vision, understanding their product, and see how we can fit together.
00:18:07.884 - 00:18:32.626, Speaker B: And when you say synergies, I don't know if, I think by the time this episode comes out, the launchpad should be live, but I don't know if you'd have announced the projects in that launchpad pipeline yet. But if not, can you still kind of give us a sense of the type of projects you that are on the immediate horizon or maybe the type of projects that you guys are looking for? And when you say synergy, what does that mean in terms of alpha?
00:18:32.810 - 00:19:01.744, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good question. And we actually have been working with the first team already. The first incubator project, which is pretty exciting. And the synergy that it will bring will allow Alpha Homera users to hedge their risks better. I don't want to get into the detail too much in terms of what the new project does, but that's the type of synergy that we bring to that the new incubator project brings to Alpha home aura users.
00:19:02.044 - 00:19:26.364, Speaker B: So all of these new projects, they need to enhance the existing use cases for Alpha. So currently Alpha has its levered yield farming pool, and I think it's announced that in the future there will be things related to exchange as well. So the projects that you guys are incubating will be almost like added features on top of these core products. Is that a good way to think about it?
00:19:27.144 - 00:20:01.322, Speaker C: Not really. So it would be a completely different product, has a different use case, capture a different market. It's actually a new market that we're capturing. So going to be pretty exciting when we announce the first incubator project out. But because of these two, you can think of it as two different circles, but they have the overlapping area. So we're making sure that the overlapping area gets to, you know, really bring benefits to both Alpha Mar users and also the incubator projects users and in.
00:20:01.338 - 00:20:30.282, Speaker B: Terms of the launchpad. So obviously in the past few months, we've seen some other launchpad projects out there as well. I think there's Polka starter for Polkadot based projects, there's solestarter for Solana based projects, and essentially what they are are basically fundraising platform, public fundraising platforms. Is that what Alpha Launchpad is going to be as well, where people can bet on these or invest in these so called idos or kind of launchpad projects?
00:20:30.458 - 00:21:06.134, Speaker C: No. So it will be completely different. I think there are a lot of differences. Let me categorize into several topics. The first one is that we're not an ideal platform. The services that we really offer are the whole playbook and recipe to launch this new Defi project successfully and grow successfully. I think having that standpoint makes Alpha Launchpad really unique, because no other launchpad provides that recipe and playbook.
00:21:06.134 - 00:21:50.514, Speaker C: Once we provide this, it will not only bring benefits to the Alpha Finance lab, as I mentioned, but it accrues a lot of value to the whole Defi ecosystem, because by us doing this, we're pretty much training and growing the talent in Defi. And as Defi talent grows, the whole ecosystem also grows. And as a result of these projects launching, achieving product market fits. The whole Defi landscape will also look a lot different from all these incubator projects that we launch, I think that really sums up a good way to understand Alpha Launchpad, which is very different from the other launchpad programs.
00:21:51.574 - 00:22:10.194, Speaker B: Got it. Just to clarify here, you'll be working directly with these teams to build these new Defi primitives and leveraging a lot of the experience that you guys had. Now, if these teams are launching their own tokens and they want to distribute it to new users, will you guys help with that as well? Or is there any type of distribution mechanism built into Launchpad two?
00:22:10.354 - 00:22:58.174, Speaker C: Yep. So one of the requirements that the incubator projects have to follow as well by launching on Alpha Launchpad, is allocating a certain percentage of the tokens to alpha stakers. So that means that, let's say it doesn't have to be a lot. Maybe it's 5%, 10% depends on different teams allocating that to alpha stakers across a certain period of time. And hence, for alpha stakers, by staking Alpha, you will start to accrue protocol fees from alpha products, start to accrue a number of tokens from the launchpad projects, and then finally start to accrue the protocol fees from the launchpad projects, too.
00:22:59.714 - 00:23:05.906, Speaker B: So is the only way for people to get access to these new project tokens by stake Alpha tokens?
00:23:06.050 - 00:23:12.774, Speaker C: Correct. If you want to get it without buying on open markets, yes.
00:23:13.474 - 00:23:25.490, Speaker B: That's really interesting. And in terms of fee accrual, I think you also mentioned that part of the fees that are generated on these future protocols will accrue to alpha token holders, right?
00:23:25.682 - 00:23:26.386, Speaker C: Yes.
00:23:26.530 - 00:23:40.354, Speaker B: So what was the inspiration for that? Did you guys look into other token models that have this type of ecosystem type model that you guys may be looking to exchange tokens? And how did you design that token value accrual model?
00:23:40.514 - 00:24:34.480, Speaker C: Yeah, we actually did not look at other DeFi projects. We actually looked at traditional companies and what works well in our reality world. Right. Like, not the DeFi world. And what we saw is that a lot of, a lot of these ideas that we're doing, Alpha launchpad incubating different projects, value accrual back to Alpha is pretty similar to, you know, the mother company creating the smaller companies. Right. And how do we make sure that this ecosystem of different companies remain and bring value to the mother company? Who's the one incubate these new companies? And what we saw in the traditional world is that some percentage of perhaps dividends or velocro in some sorts also flow back to the mother company.
00:24:34.480 - 00:24:46.764, Speaker C: So that's the model that we see works really, really well in traditional world, and we think can be applied here in how we structure launchpad in a decentralized way.
00:24:48.104 - 00:25:38.144, Speaker B: And this is something that you also touched on earlier in this conversation, Tasha, the point about regulation, because now, obviously, for some of the IDO platforms or launchpads out there, they are conducting these token issuances that may be construed as security offerings. But for you guys, the definition of a launchpad is different, where you guys are only incubating the projects and not really doing public fundraises for any of the projects you incubate, you're just distributing the tokens to the existing token holders of alpha. So in terms of regulation, how are you guys thinking about that? Do you think you guys are less at risk of securities regulation because of the fact that you guys are not conducting these public fundraises? And if so, are there certain regulatory aspects that you guys are paying a close attention to?
00:25:38.564 - 00:26:41.012, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. The model that we did makes sure that we can scale and also grow despite regulatory landscape changes, because we are not conducting any sales to the public. If regulatory says that other launchpad programs conduct sales to the public, and KYC, for instance, that would be pretty troublesome for, for the other launchpad programs. So by us distributing without selling the tokens to offer stakers, make sure that we're safe from that area. The regulatory landscape or areas that we're more focused on is more on the product side. So given different nature of the product, what are some warnings? What are some items do we have to show on the front end side to make sure that it complies to potential regulatory additions in the future? But I think that's not too hard, and that's also not going to push.
00:26:41.068 - 00:26:59.584, Speaker B: Any timeline back that makes total sense. And I guess in terms of the projects that you guys are looking for, I know you mentioned that you don't want to share too much at this point in time, but are there specific maybe themes or features on your wish list that you really love to incubate?
00:27:00.134 - 00:27:36.314, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So stablecoin, definitely. I think there are a lot of rooms, and actually internally, we are brainstorming different ideas on this as well. And then if you see the alpha Homura. Right, it actually is a leverage farming, which pretty much comes from us integrating the two industries. One is lending, the other one is yeuke farming. So we're looking to achieve something similar in terms of creating a whole new market for our own, for the new incubator projects.
00:27:36.314 - 00:28:05.634, Speaker C: So I think that's more on the types of market gaps that we identify and the new incubator projects identify. Another area that's also really interesting is short selling because there is actually no protocol in DeFi that allows this functionality to be done very effectively. And this functionality is actually really core to have the whole financial markets operate effectively.
00:28:07.494 - 00:28:55.010, Speaker B: That makes a lot of sense. And I also love to use this opportunity to zoom out a bit and talk about this vision for all these incubator projects. Because obviously on one hand you see the wider defi doing a lot of composability related things. You see maybe augur plugging into maker using its Dai and plugging into zero x for its order book. And then you see these different margin trading products maybe plugging into other lending protocols. And even for you guys, you guys plug into another protocol cream to enable the borrowing part for the levered yield farming. So how do you guys think about how do you guys balance between hey, we're going to build these products internally or incubate these products internally versus we're going to go out there and see what's been built and then compose with them.
00:28:55.010 - 00:29:00.334, Speaker B: Is that a kind of, I guess, accurate dichotomy to think about or is that not too relevant?
00:29:00.914 - 00:30:09.288, Speaker C: I think there are three categories, right? Like one is we build internally becoming alpha products, the other one is we're incubating and launching as a new incubator project under the Alpha universe. And then the third one is partnering, integrating with the existing protocol. So the third one, it's definitely if there are use cases that already match with what we need, then we will integrate. But a lot of times the market gaps come from the fact that the area that we saw actually haven't been tapped by any of the protocols in the space. And that's why we need to either build ourselves or incubate. So it comes down to either one or two and the rationale between either go with building ourselves or incubating, the new projects really come down to the type of product itself and also the function of tokenomics. Because a lot of times in order to really grow and bootstrap the product really well, it also ties a lot to the tokenomics design.
00:30:09.288 - 00:30:45.054, Speaker C: So if the tokenomics design is actually aligned with what we already have with alpha, and the product seems to be really related or brings a lot of synergy to alpha products already, then we build ourselves. But if there are a number of tokenomics designed that really show that it actually needs a new token, a new completely new tokenomics design, plus the new market gap that we're capturing has a small area of intersection with alpha products, not a huge area. Right. Then we set that as an incubator project.
00:30:46.514 - 00:31:06.374, Speaker B: Got it. Makes a ton of sense. And as we come to the final part of the discussion, Tasha, I'd love to kind of get your sense of where do you see Alpha in two to three years? What are the key parts, key products that the launchpad would have incubated or you wish to have incubated by then? And what is the kind of ultimate vision here?
00:31:07.254 - 00:32:16.054, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there are two ways you can think about it. One is expanding the alpha universe in terms of the product layer that we offer. And the other one is expand the existing, let's say we have five, six products, whatever, expand those into as many defi landscape as possible. Because I see that DeFi will not only, you know, appear on Ethereum, it will appear on many other chains, perhaps. Hopefully there will be some technology that really allows a lot more easy interoperability so we can leverage that tech, but if not, then we will also drive that innovation in terms of making sure that different blockchains, different Altus can talk and interoperate a lot better. So I think in terms of taking at a deeper look on the first layer, in terms of the products, what we see, and I think are the key components to have built out. One is something in the derivatives space.
00:32:16.054 - 00:32:54.904, Speaker C: Two is in the stablecoin space. Three is in more of the trading space. I think, for instance, short selling and more. And I think if you look into the traditional finance landscape, these are the components that are really, really key to the financial industry. Stablecoins definitely is the main currency of the fiat or the traditional finance. I think we have a lot of room to experiment still in terms of what kind of designs work for stablecoins. Derivatives itself is also a really huge space in finance.
00:32:54.904 - 00:33:36.562, Speaker C: If you look into, you know, traditional finance, the derivatives markets is a lot huge or a lot larger than the spot trading markets. And if you look at Defi now, derivatives is still really, really small. So there are a huge gap for that. The third one is, you know, short selling or other types of trading. Right. And I think these types of tradings are key to make sure that the fun, the market functions properly. So if you look into traditional finance as well, you will see that, for instance, short selling is really much the key tool that allows the whole market to not get too overvalued, for instance.
00:33:36.562 - 00:34:00.744, Speaker C: That's one of the use case. And if you look into Defi, we don't really have that tool that we can use really easily. So I think a lot of these will be the ones that we incubate out because we see the importance of these components playing out in traditional finance, and we are going to make sure that it also capture the large gap in Defi, too.
00:34:01.764 - 00:34:15.344, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. That makes a lot of sense. And for people who want to learn more about the launchpad or maybe want to get involved with these new launchpad products, what are the best resources for them to reach out to and use?
00:34:15.644 - 00:34:21.054, Speaker C: Yeah, they should go to Alpha launchpad, alphafinance IO.
00:34:22.274 - 00:34:33.414, Speaker B: Definitely. I will include those in the show notes below. Well, thank you so much once again for coming on. Tasha for the second time onto blockcrunch. This has been a delight, and I'm really excited to check out what projects you guys are incubating.
00:34:33.754 - 00:34:36.034, Speaker C: Thank you, Jason. Very glad to be back.
