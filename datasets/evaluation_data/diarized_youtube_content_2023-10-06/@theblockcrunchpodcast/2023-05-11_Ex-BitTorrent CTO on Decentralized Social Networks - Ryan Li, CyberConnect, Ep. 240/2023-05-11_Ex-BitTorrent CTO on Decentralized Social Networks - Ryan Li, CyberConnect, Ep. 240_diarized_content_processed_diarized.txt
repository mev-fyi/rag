00:00:02.040 - 00:00:08.714, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto.
00:00:17.214 - 00:00:39.040, Speaker B: And before we get started, just a reminder for you guys out there. The Blockcrunch podcast is intended for informational purposes only. Neither the host nor its guests or licensed financial advisors, and nothing discussed should be construed as financial advice. Views held by Blockcrunch's guests are their own, and sponsorship messages do not constitute financial advice or endorsement. With that out of the way, let's jump right in.
00:00:39.232 - 00:00:53.684, Speaker A: Today's episode of the Blockcrunch podcast is brought to you by protocol apps, the team behind Filecoin. So to tell us a little bit more, is Colin Efrin, who leads ecosystem at protocol apps. So, Colin, can you tell us what's one thing that people misunderstand about Filecoin the most?
00:00:54.334 - 00:01:47.154, Speaker C: One thing people don't realize is that the launch of smart contracts on Filecoin in Q one of this year will transform the Filecoin network into the world's largest open data economy and a full fledged layer one within web3. Most people think of Filecoin as the world's largest decentralized storage network, and while that's true, the community onboarded 450 petabytes of real data in 2022, up 18 times from the beginning of last year. Q one of this year is transformational. The community is launching the Filepoint virtual machine, where users can start writing programs to automate storage and renewal of data, pay for computation, and trigger retrievals, all of which is built on a permissionless market of hardware providers that is 15 exabytes in size. This will open the world's largest data economy and make Filecoin one of the most powerful layer one blockchains in web3.
00:01:47.274 - 00:01:53.146, Speaker A: Hello there. Now, before I move on, I'd love to thank the hundreds of you who have subscribed to blockchain VIP, because with.
00:01:53.170 - 00:01:54.666, Speaker B: Your support, I've been able to share.
00:01:54.690 - 00:02:17.626, Speaker A: My real thoughts on specific projects that I dont usually share on interviews in a format that I enjoy more, which is bi weekly written posts. Weve also been able to offer exclusive AMA's sharing my investment frameworks, interactable models, and breaking down important trends before they become big. Now, we even had Elon Musk comment on one of our threads recently. So if you havent already, head on over to theBlockcrench.com vip and you can.
00:02:17.650 - 00:02:19.522, Speaker B: Access dozens of hours of research for.
00:02:19.538 - 00:03:16.882, Speaker A: What youd spend on a coffee a day. Hey, everybody, welcome back to another episode of the BlockCrunch podcast it's been a little while since we recorded a new episode, and I'm here in our Singapore office now today. I'm really excited to cover a really exciting topic, which is web3 social, because since as early as 2018, web3 proponents have wanted to replace centralized social network that abuse user privacy and data. But the vertical has always kind of lagged behind many others in crypto. So to give you some examples, we had Twitter, but on chain like peep ETH way back in 2018 for those who remember, which was a little bit more than an experiment. But then we also had bitcloud, or Deso, as they're known as now a venture backed web3 Twitter clone, which some viewed violated user privacy right out the gate. So we had a little bit of fumble in the early days, and lately we've had really hyped up projects like Lens and Forecaster, but so far, neither have really hit the inflection points that DeFi and NFts have.
00:03:16.882 - 00:03:44.904, Speaker A: So the big question our listeners have is, are web3 social networks just too early, or are they a pipe dream, or are they the next big thing in crypto? So to explore this, I'm really, really excited to bring on one of the earliest decentralized social graph projects and also the market leader by far, by user account, which I'm also an angel investor in. So today I'm really glad to have with us on the show Ryan Lee, the co founder of CyberConnect, to share with us more about the decentralized social vertical. So, Ryan, welcome to the show, man.
00:03:45.364 - 00:03:49.024, Speaker D: Thanks so much for reminding me. Jason, this is an honor.
00:03:49.724 - 00:03:56.984, Speaker A: Yeah. So before we started recording, we talked about some exciting news that just came out about cyber Connect. Can you tell us a little bit about that?
00:03:57.764 - 00:04:24.544, Speaker D: Yes, we've been thinking about this for a while. To really build a user owned, decentralized social network, we're finally making the move to announce our own token, which would eventually lead to the decentralization of who is actually governing the protocol. So this morning, we just announced coinless public sale, which is going to happen on May 18. Very big step for us.
00:04:25.404 - 00:04:41.182, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been a long time coming, and I'm really excited for what happens. So we're going to cover that later. But before that, you've had a really, really interesting resume, Ryan. So before we even start with what cyber connect is, what decentralized social is, can you tell us a little bit about what you were working on before you started cyberconduct?
00:04:41.358 - 00:05:26.934, Speaker D: Of course. Of course. So, I don't know where to start, actually? So my journey into tech, especially into building software, is when I was in high school, I got into building tech when iOS was still like very popular. I built my first iOS app when I was in high school. And then right after that, me and my, a bunch of my friends at college, we started this company called Sketch off, which is like a social network when I was only 18. At that time, we thought, well, people don't really post genuine photos or genuine posts anymore on their social networks. They are always photoshopping their nicest photo when they're posing in the gym or whatever.
00:05:26.934 - 00:06:17.344, Speaker D: At the time, we wanted to bring some genuine self expression into social networks. That was a really great experiment. And right after I worked at Google, I worked at Instagram. Both, like, both companies were like the biggest tech giant, especially for Instagram. I did a bunch of stuff for Instagram client to make users love or use Instagram more, especially on when they are not in the best kind of network setting. So especially for the third world countries and those users. Anyway, after those experiences working at the big tech, I decided to work on web3 full time during 2017.
00:06:17.344 - 00:07:25.644, Speaker D: And at the time I was exposed to bitcoin since 2014, build a bunch of random stuff during hackathons. And 2017 was the time I saw what people are starting to really realize, that token economy is something that's going to really change how social networks, or just networks, how networks are going to work. And I got a lot of inspiration from the existing projects at the time. And we decided to build our own, what we call decentralized content economy, where we want to reward the best content through a token and through a blockchain that we designed from the ground up. So at the time we built what we call a Lido network, a blockchain on Cosmos. And then we built an application or a platform on top of it, which is called Dlive, a decentralized live streaming platform. At the time, we had so since lunch, like, since after like half a year of lunch, we had more than a million daily active, we have more than 30 million monthly.
00:07:25.644 - 00:08:21.804, Speaker D: We have PewDiePie as our exclusive streamer. Everything was like a great experiment. And the reason why it kind of worked is really, at the time, contents are just not monetized enough. Or to put it a different way, like streamers or content creators in general are not getting a fair distribution of value from centralized media companies like YouTube or Twitch. They probably get at most like 30 average getting like 50 or 70% of the cut taken away from Twitch or from those platforms. So how we design it was like really open it up to create this token economy where every user is part of stakeholder for the network and they are always going to enjoy the upsides as well as they have the right incentive along with the platform. So that was the backstory.
00:08:21.804 - 00:09:13.764, Speaker D: Dlive was eventually acquired by BitTorrent in 2020. And I said at BitTorrent for a while, almost the same team, we regrouped in 2021 and then we started CyberConnect. We did a lot of experiment in between and we also had a lot of different thoughts about what's the best approach. And we decided on building the fundamental social network layer for any application to build on paw. And I think that's where 2021 was a key moment in a lot of the web3 movements where some of the standards like summer 21 was becoming very popular. And then we decided to really bet on building infrastructure for all the developers to build upon. Yeah, that's like a quick story into why we are connect.
00:09:14.424 - 00:09:21.576, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember seeing that news around BitTorrent acquiring your company, your previous company, D Life, I think back in 2020, right?
00:09:21.720 - 00:09:22.864, Speaker D: Yes, early 2020.
00:09:22.904 - 00:09:32.964, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, that was, that felt like a lifetime ago because that was like before all the COVID stuff started happening. And then I think Cyber Connect was launched in the time of COVID right?
00:09:34.164 - 00:09:49.424, Speaker D: Yeah, it is in the time of COVID We started Cyberknit in 2021. We explored a little bit in NFT world and we decided, as I said, to bet heavily on building the infrastructure layer for any kind of web3 social.
00:09:50.164 - 00:10:13.544, Speaker A: I think it's quite poetic that you guys started a protocol to connect people in a time when people were all separated during COVID I'd love to dive into that theme because obviously that's the mission that web two social platforms have tried to go after for a long time. And you worked at one of before a while ago at Instagram. So what is main challenge with web two social platforms today? What is the opportunity for web3 to come in?
00:10:14.724 - 00:11:14.652, Speaker D: Yes, I think in general, what web3 brings to any kind of work is really direct monetization on chain where they can do any kind of monetization through NFT, through 20, and then a governance model where everyone is part of the network so that they have incentive to drive the network to a long term success. So those two play very well along with how we see web two content platforms or social platforms evolve throughout the years. Right. One of the biggest challenge with web two platforms were like content creators are not monetizing enough. They are pretty much taking 10% of the total revenue from everything that the platform generates. Like all these different platform generates tens of billions in revenue every year through ads, through a subscription. But then, like, the content creators are only generating probably less than 10% of that.
00:11:14.652 - 00:12:29.734, Speaker D: And the reason why they are very much being constrained by the platforms is really they don't own their data. Like they don't own any kind of content that they uploaded to these platforms. They don't own the audience that they have. Take, take one quick example, is when we were doing d live, Mixer acquired the biggest streamer from Twitch, who was called a ninja, who was a programmer, a pro esport gamer, and it was biggest star on Twitch. And then eventually when he moved to Mixer, he brought like 30%, probably less than 30% of his traffic of his audience to, to a different platform. So two problem that we saw was like, well, content creators are having a very hard time of monetizing their content or monetizing, monetizing the attention that their audience brings as well as like, they have no interoperability. There's no chance that they can bring their audience to a different platform or if they want, as a regular user, you can't really have enjoy any kind of interoperability when you want to see to bring your friends, your, any kind of your social interactions to a different platform.
00:12:29.734 - 00:13:01.924, Speaker D: And that really kind of blocks any kind of innovation that happens in social. We're still using the same social platforms from like almost ten years ago, just because the amount of data that they gathered to themselves, the wall gardens that they created. So that's like the big problem that we're facing. And I think web3, with the right amount of incentive and the right amount of ownership could really solve that. So that's why we started cyber connect.
00:13:02.664 - 00:13:36.644, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's a pain point that I personally feel as well, because I think so many people, like content creators like myself, putting in so much time on Twitter, bringing people to Twitter, I think one of the best performing threats we had had like 40 million views. But, you know, we're not getting paid a single for any of those. But instead, we're actually paying Twitter now because they have this new model for blue checks, which is crazy to me, which is why I'm so excited about cyber connect. So let's dive into cyber connect because you guys are building a decentralized social graph. Now, for unfamiliar people, what exactly is a social graph?
00:13:36.984 - 00:15:09.264, Speaker D: So how we're seeing a social graph, or more generally like a decentralized social network, is really how do you own your identity or like pieces of your identity, you might have multiple identities across different platforms, but how do you really own them and have the capability of bringing them along? How do you own your content and your distribution? Like how your audience is seeing your content, how are you monetize them directly? These are the problems we see commonly found in web two social networks. So how we're solving that is really making users, the owners, the actual owners of these, their profile, their content, their audience, their monetization channels, and baking this into a protocol that any application developer can build on. So Cyberconnet is in general, a set of smart contracts on chain and a scalable storage solution that helps storing all these data as a self serving data, so that the content creators, the users, can safely trust the blockchain or the cryptography of it to own their data and not trust cyberconnect or any platform to own these. And they can safely bring them along to different applications that's built, built on cyber Connect. So it gives you the sign in with Facebook kind of feel, but it doesn't give Facebook the ultimate permission of using all your data to do whatever they want.
00:15:09.644 - 00:15:19.184, Speaker A: So when you say data, this is like the personal information that you upload or your connections to other user profiles as well. Is that kind of what makes up the social graph?
00:15:19.884 - 00:15:44.254, Speaker D: Yes. So your profile consists of your names, your avatar, your bio, and then as well as how you're interacting with different content creators, different communities, how you're acting in general when you are just browsing through all the digital experiences. Yeah. Especially focusing on the content creators and how they're engaging with the community.
00:15:45.474 - 00:16:12.674, Speaker A: So this is interesting because this is the type of information that creates a moat for networks like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. They want to keep this data because it's the lifeblood of how they can target their users. By understanding what you're consuming, what videos that you tend to like or spend more time on, they can target you better. So this is the money maker for them. So what is the incentive for, you know, a decentralized network to build on cyber connect if they can't own this data and have that moat?
00:16:13.574 - 00:17:57.960, Speaker D: Well, one thing is like, we've seen that DeFi brings a lot of efficiency, efficiency to the traditional finance, right? Like uniswap can do the same amount of trading volume with a much smaller team, with much smaller infrastructure. And we've been seeing that with a more transparent and more fair value distribution among the network, content creators among those social networks could really earn the same amount of money as well as the whole ecosystem can have a more fair stake into the value generation and they can all benefit without having one central party that's like in control of everything. Imagine Facebook data or Twitter are more open, but then deficiency went up by 10% or 100%. The whole ecosystem, there will be more people building on top of the same infrastructure, as well as the whole value generation will be more fairly distributed to every player, not only just the creator, but also the curators. The viewers as well as like as network can play a better part into this network. And I know this is very early, like a lot of this experiments are like as we're seeing right now, the user numbers are way smaller than like the web3 social user numbers are way smaller than the web two ones. But we've seen a lot of real engagement, like long lasting engagements and connections happening on web3 at a much deeper connectivity versus the web two ones, and I think those are the ones.
00:17:57.960 - 00:18:08.364, Speaker D: So our thesis really bringing monetization, better monetization for creators, and long lasting connections for everyone who's part of the network.
00:18:09.044 - 00:18:49.896, Speaker A: So this is a slightly different value proposition than I think, what Twitter and Facebook are offering, because they're not offering better monetization platform, they're just offering platforms for more exposure. And folks, creators on these platforms now seem to be using other channels to monetize. Maybe they ask for sponsors and have those transactions be conducted outside of the networks they're on. So given the value prop for a web3 social graph like cyber connect and a web two social graph like what's Facebook use is so different for the winning applications or companies built on top of web3 social graphs, do you think they'll be similar to, like, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok? Or are these going to be like fundamentally different types of companies, Facebook and.
00:18:49.920 - 00:19:45.504, Speaker D: Instagram, they're the type of company that they're, they're early. They had their network build up just faster than anybody else. They don't necessarily provide the best UX or UI like at Facebook. I was, when I was working on Instagram, it was at the time where they're trying to copy the story from the story feature from Snapchat. It's kind of funny to see because they have a bigger audience at the beginning, they can still keep the mode by just not really innovating much. And I think in web3, when the datas are not really controlled by the central platform, all the developers have more incentive to build better user experiences, better monetization models for themselves. And then the users will just pick the best user experience instead of like, because I have so much data already on Facebook, I have, like, no incentive to migrate to a different platform.
00:19:45.504 - 00:19:58.954, Speaker D: And I think that's a win for the long run. Right? Like, people would want to see more competition and more innovation happening on every product.
00:19:59.254 - 00:20:09.834, Speaker A: Yeah. And when you talked about a better monetization for creators on cyber Connect, can you give it an example of how exactly does that work? So if I create something in cyber connect, how do I make money from that?
00:20:10.334 - 00:21:21.068, Speaker D: Well, there are a lot of different layers when you make money on Twitter or any kind of platforms. Well, first, you have most of the platforms. You have to have a lease, a very significant user base, like at least 10,000 or 100,000 to start really monetizing. It has to go through multiple layers where ad providers and ad networks come in and you somehow get a scoop of all the ads revenue. And in terms of that monetization model, where you have to go through different layers, cyber provides a very natural direction, interaction with your audience. So right now on cyberconnect, you can create a post, you can create any kind of content where you can set a specific rule that how do you want your audience to engage with it? So let's say you have a really great article and you want to monetize on top of it. You can say that either anyone who wants to consume this content has to follow me directly on cyber Connect by paying a monthly fee, and then these contents are directly available to those subscribers who are paying a monthly fee.
00:21:21.068 - 00:21:59.144, Speaker D: Or you can say that this content is really only available for people who pay $10 to view it, which we already have. We're seeing content creators on cybercrime making hundreds to $200 per blog that they write. So this kind of direct monetization, without having to accrue a very large audience is what direct monetization means to us. So they don't have to build up their audience. They don't have to work with ad network directly. They can monetize on their audience even if they don't have hundreds of thousands of them.
00:22:00.044 - 00:22:08.744, Speaker A: So where does the web3 element come in? Because you can already kind of do this on onlyfans, on these kind of paid, paid platforms already.
00:22:09.064 - 00:22:40.140, Speaker D: Well, I think the web3 components play in cyberconnet. One is all these content that they own, it doesn't belong to Onlyfan. Like, they can create these content on platforms that's not limited to cyber Connect. Anywhere that's integrated, any app that's integrated with CyberConnect, they can bring these content along. Anything that they post on one app is also available to other apps that's integrated. So you get more distribution, not just from this one app that you only find, right. And as well, we all know that.
00:22:40.140 - 00:23:42.566, Speaker D: I don't know if you are like, I don't know how deep you are into the counter creator part, the transaction costs, or just in general, the infrastructure for acting or donating anything on any of these platforms takes at least 30 days to clear if it's a credit card when we're building Twitch or like decentralized Twitch, Twitch takes 60 days to clear any kind of donation or subscription. So content creators are like, they have to wait. And then not only just the waiting part, they can't really take any monetization from a different region just because twist doesn't really like, Twitch is not operating in every region of the world. Like, you don't get Internet money. Like, people have to have the right amount of access to the infrastructure that you can pay any creator on a platform. That's like very different from how we're seeing the Internet. Money flows on web3.
00:23:42.566 - 00:24:55.750, Speaker D: So the two key components is, one, you don't necessarily need to have one single platform control your distribution, and then you don't. You get the Internet money where anyone in the world can directly donate or purchase your content. And then with this, you get much less take rate on twitch or any of these platforms. The take rate is at least 30% to 50% just because of the inefficiency of those platforms. But yeah, those are like we've learned throughout the years of building content platforms for the creators. I think right now we're not really yet there yet to build better monetization just because the distribution is much smaller. You don't have the billions of users or hundreds of millions of users on web3 versus what you get on Twitter or on YouTube right now, what you get is really direct monetization with the true fans that you get, as well as building a long lasting experience or long lasting connection with your fans because they were so early.
00:24:55.750 - 00:25:10.754, Speaker D: And then with the right amount of incentive, everyone becomes a stakeholder off the network. Instead of like, I'm working for Twitter or like, I'm relying on Twitter to make money. So that's like the current state. But in the long run, I think the efficiency really plays a much bigger part.
00:25:11.774 - 00:25:46.094, Speaker A: So just to kind of synthesize there, it sounds like being able to accept global payments and real time settlements through crypto, and also having this kind of open social graph where I posted one website and it's immediately accessible on all the potential websites that are accessing cyber connect. That composability is the biggest step function improvement over something like olefins, where if I post something, I'm going to have to post the same thing separately on a separate account and maybe there's non competes, whatever. Is that the main pitch to creators today?
00:25:46.554 - 00:26:20.224, Speaker D: Yes. And along with the connection that you actually make with your audience. Like, I wasn't the early supporter of PewDiePie, but I was like, early support of, like, a lot of the smaller creators as they grow bigger. Like, my contribution in the early stage didn't really mean anything in terms of monster monetary value or in terms of community recognition. Just because the data is not available. No one can really attest that I was an early supporter. And building that long lasting connection with your audience as well as with your friends is really what web3 brings as well.
00:26:20.254 - 00:26:32.276, Speaker A: Well, so I think, like, every follow and every like could be on chain and you have very viable proof that Ryan was the first guy to ever like, a pewdiepie video. That's. That's where the value is. That, that's interesting.
00:26:32.380 - 00:27:08.512, Speaker D: Yeah, I was an add on. Like, third party. Third party developers or providers can actually build on these data. Like, there's literally no way for you to, as applicant developer, there's no way for you to build like a separate layer for like, loyalty or any kind of these recognition platforms for creators on YouTube or Twitter. There's no way to know who are the earliest supporter of Jason or block crunch on Twitter because the APIs are not open. That's also building a long term connection. It doesn't depend on a platform.
00:27:08.512 - 00:27:32.456, Speaker D: It doesn't depend on closed API. It's really important for more innovative applications to come along. You can't have third parties building more incentivized loyalty programs for you. Like, whoever listens to this podcast can level up or some, or in some other ways, like gamification ways. That's not possible on any kind of podcast or YouTube, right?
00:27:32.640 - 00:28:16.928, Speaker A: Yeah. I think I can attest to just how frustrating it is to have siloed databases between different platforms. So we can't really figure out who was the first people to download the podcast because that data is not publicly available to us. And we can maybe see who are the early followers on Twitter, but there's no consistent, easily viewable data on how much they engage with us. So what we do now is we have a newsletter as well, which is a paid newsletter for people who want to dive deeper into specific projects. So we cross reference people who are subscribed on the newsletter with their email, and we try to guess what their Twitter handle is. See if they follow us on Twitter and from their interactions, try to guess, are they watching our YouTube? Are they downloading our stuff? It's just insanely, insanely complicated.
00:28:16.928 - 00:28:43.184, Speaker A: So it makes no sense to me that there's no one open database for all platforms to access because for creators, that would mean a lot. Now, I'm curious for the user side, though, because I think a lot of the value proposition for web3 social as a theme is that Facebook or Instagram or Twitter, they take your data, sometimes they violate your privacy. And that was the big push on the user side. Do you think that's something that users care about as well?
00:28:44.404 - 00:29:29.552, Speaker D: Well, I think users care a lot about privacy. It's just like they haven't experienced anything, like, oh, this is a very private data set that I'm not going to give to. Like, they have no prior experience of working with that. So, like, it doesn't really bring much value at this point. Like, if we, if we were like, operating under entire private, like, privacy conserving kind of environment, and then somehow Facebook come along and say, okay, we're gonna take your data and do ads or whatever on, on top of that, then people are gonna get extremely frustrated. So now it's like people care about it to some extent, but, like, not really on a product level. They still, they still love Twitter, they still love all these Facebook or all these platforms.
00:29:29.552 - 00:30:29.004, Speaker D: And how we're solving that is like, web3 doesn't necessarily bring privacy. Just by being web3 or being decentralized, it brings ownership to, like, at the very beginning, like, you start to own your data. And as the infrastructure and different providers start to have more, like, data, data access control, some kind of private setting with more. More futuristic tech, like maybe ZK, maybe some of the NPC kind of setting for users to really review those data upon their consent, then we have a much more private environment. But web3 itself doesn't really bring much more privacy. Probably it brings more, more data into public just by being, having all these data available on public blockchains or public decentralized storage. But I think it's a good step when users are starting to own their data.
00:30:29.004 - 00:30:37.364, Speaker D: As you say, you have all your data on all these fragmented platforms. You really don't have any control of it.
00:30:37.904 - 00:30:59.490, Speaker A: Yeah. And as a creator, I'm always, I guess it's kind of my inner investor as well. I'm always trying to hedge my bets. I'm always kind of paranoid that one day Twitter is going to take down my account and all my followers are gone. So I'm trying to diversify into, I want subscribers on my RSS feed, on my YouTube, on my newsletter, so that, you know, I can diversify, but if I actually own the data, I don't have to think about that that much and just focus on the creating.
00:30:59.642 - 00:31:13.570, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. And all the, all the, all the consumers, all the users, all the audience that you have should have a consistent profile across different platforms. Like, you shouldn't be like, looking at different emails as well as like a Twitter id or like YouTube ID and try to compare and match them.
00:31:13.722 - 00:31:16.644, Speaker A: I think that's the one address, basically.
00:31:16.834 - 00:31:35.564, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. Or like one username or one profile so that you can always align with them and you can see how they're progressing along with your. All your different funnels. Right. Like how they started becoming your Twitter subscriber and then becoming your newsletter subscriber, eventually become a paid. Some kind of paid audience.
00:31:35.984 - 00:32:09.014, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And I love to kind of dive into the current landscape in web3 social as well. So there's many other projects and companies that are trying to go at this vertical. I think that the earliest attempts were things like social tokens, where creators can issue their tokens and if you buy their tokens, you maybe have like quasi equity exposure to what they're working on. That seems spiritually similar to what you were talking about, about being able to show your early support for creators. But in your opinion, why didn't you guys go with the social token route? Like, what's wrong with the social token solution?
00:32:09.474 - 00:33:01.686, Speaker D: Yeah, I think I was exposed to social token back in 20, 2019 ish when like, rally was like really big. One promise that they gave was like, social token gave this kind of quantifiable commitment an audience can give to a creator. One thing that I found that the market doesn't really, like was first, like the, the free, like, express, like, expressive. Like, the token doesn't really mean anything until the creator have to set up a specific rules and the creators just don't know how to really take advantage of that. And as well as like, the speculation part of it really kind of screws up. Like, hardcore audience don't really care about the right, they want your creator to be successful. They don't want to speculate on your creator's social token.
00:33:01.686 - 00:34:03.274, Speaker D: So that really creates some kind of extra externality where speculators come in, how we are seeing it seeing it is really if there's one very simple way that creators can recognize, or at least they know who are the core hardcore contributor or the early supporter, and the early supporters know that this data is also publicly or like at least freely available to the creators, and the creators will eventually do something good about it. That's kind of the long lasting social connection that we were still trying to bring to the audience and creator scene, so that creators will have the confidence that they will always recognize all the hardcore fans, and the fans will know that the same way happens on the other side. Yeah. So to be sure, I think social tokens are two too expressive. Like nobody knows what to, how what to best leverage it for.
00:34:04.214 - 00:34:53.332, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you summarized the problem, like, more perfect than I've heard anyone summarize it because that's exactly the problem I faced. I think we tried to issue our own social token with roll, I think back in 2019 maybe, but that was a challenge I faced is I just didn't know how I can enforce certain things. And when I even offered free tokens to certain followers who are pretty loyal, they're like, I don't want your shitcoin. So it's just weird to introduce an element of speculation into earnest fan creator connections. And I think that's what we saw with Deso, with decentralized social as well, where all the creators were given these massive tokens that had some sort of monetary value tied to bonding curve. And what we ended up doing was we just dumped the tokens right away because it's just like random money out of nowhere. We don't want to work on this token, but you're giving me free money, so we're going to take it.
00:34:53.332 - 00:35:11.074, Speaker A: So it's just always weird to me to have that speculative element. But moving away from this speculative social token side, there's also other web, three social networks. So things like forecaster or lens protocol, they've been getting quite a lot of attention. Can you talk a bit about what they're doing and how that differs from what you guys are working on?
00:35:11.894 - 00:36:08.904, Speaker D: Yeah, I think just to start, we've seen a lot of different approaches. Back in the days there were steemit, there were the ones you talked about, I forgot the name, sorry. Like, there were like different decentralized social networks back, back at the time, what they were lacking was really like a composable layer, or at least the environment for composability, where developers can have the common understanding of building on top of something that they understand. As we are approaching 2021, 2022. Now people would know, okay, NFT is a standard that's going to be here for a while and then like years of twenties and the usernames, like having some kind of username user profile is very commonly understood. And putting on EVM or like some kind of a major blockchains or mainstream blockchains are getting more adopted. So lens and forecaster are very, I think they're really good approaches.
00:36:08.904 - 00:37:01.524, Speaker D: We started way earlier than either of them and we, I mean, I'm here to, I still say good things about both of them where far craster kind of focused more on building a really good community vibe. It doesn't really matter about the tech. I think the tech is kind of similar to like mastodon or like the earlier activity pub kind of protocol, but where they have very native community, very elite Silicon Valley like community. So it's valuable for those users within the community. And for lens, I think they did a good job on building some kind of a common layer with entirely smart contract based approach and then onboarding developers to build whatever they want. And for us, we took a very different approach. Our approach is more like we started earlier.
00:37:01.524 - 00:38:00.764, Speaker D: We were exploring all kinds of different way to express this common standard of how to express social interaction, social connection, and we landed on having a smart contract plus hybrid Arweave based approach. So users both enjoy the scalability of Arweave reams as well as the tokenization and monetization on those smart contracts. On top of the protocol, we have very different approach in terms of product or go to market. So we build our own product. We're very product driven where our product is called link three. You can visit it on link 3.2. It's like a social network that looks very similar to LinkedIn plus eventbrite, where every organization can have their official profile, where they can display all their official links, their official team members, their backers, as well as using those profile to create content.
00:38:00.764 - 00:38:57.414, Speaker D: So they can create a blog post, they can create an event where, let's say they have a community call coming up or they have like an AMA with another partner coming up, they can register them on link three and users will come to explore these communities through different type of content, events and blog posts. So link three was more of a restraint or confined approach. Instead of building like let's build another Twitter, we were really more focusing on building something that people are really used to like people are used to reading articles, people are used to attending those AMA's or Twitter spaces and even in offline events. So link three is becoming. We want link three to be the place where they can explore things. On web3 becoming the distribution channel for all these projects and communities and creators to showcase their stuff to the community. And link to has so far the best traction.
00:38:57.414 - 00:39:21.154, Speaker D: We have 900,000 monthly visitors on the site. We have more than 400,000 transacting users or wallets through the cyber Connect protocol. And I think our approach at least is what we're seeing that's working. It's very different. It doesn't sound like Twitter. As sexy as like, oh, let's build another Twitter. But it works.
00:39:21.614 - 00:39:46.994, Speaker A: Yeah. And I do realize that on the link three website, you guys report about 890,000 total cyber profiles. I think if you compare the similar number to like lens, there's about 112,000 there, forecasts are about 12,000 there. So how did you guys get, like, this much of a lead on your kind of alternatives? Is it kind of first mover advantage? Are you kind of creating the profiles for the projects? And how do you like onboard so many people?
00:39:47.854 - 00:40:39.368, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a great question. We took the same invite only or gated approach to start with, similar to other alternatives where they kind of have this invite only access in the beginning and during earlier this year, so January or February of 2023, we started working with more ecosystem partners. So before that we were like solely focusing on link three. We want to make sure that link three has the best community, best creators. And after we approached a very big amount of user base, we started to open it up to developers. And earlier this year, we partnered with BNB chain to do a hackathon where we onboarded more than 50 developers. That's when we open it up.
00:40:39.368 - 00:41:25.288, Speaker D: We open the profile registration up to a lot of the users so that they can easily onboard to any application built on cybercrime, not only just through a link three or through us. So that was like a big push. We see about 30% to 40% of the traffic going to applications that's not built by us. So that's a good sign as well as we saw that cyber connect protocol, like the cyber username and the tokens or nfts that we issue through the Cyberpunk protocol are being integrated into other applications. So that's also a good sign where people find this or developers find this valuable to them. The social connection or the social interactions are valuable to other applications. Yeah.
00:41:25.288 - 00:41:40.134, Speaker D: And that's only the very beginning. I think the approach that we took is the right approach for the team. We are iterating our protocol to make it so much more fun and so much more versatile in the next coming month.
00:41:40.714 - 00:42:17.014, Speaker A: Yeah, and speaking of kind of versatile, there's one project that I actually spoke to recently called favor Phaver. So they're building kind of like a Twitter clone, I want to say, that's built on web3 rails. So I think they actually started by building on lens so you can create a lens profile. But I think recently they also announced they're launching on cyber Connect. So I thought that was really interesting. So because they're launching a two different one, three social graphs. So do you think, like, social graphs and one three are actually competitive with each other or they eventually end up being just one big social graph? Or is it like, many different flavors of social graphs? How is that going to pan out?
00:42:17.394 - 00:42:20.938, Speaker D: Well, I don't have the crystal ball to see, like, well, how is it.
00:42:20.946 - 00:42:21.814, Speaker A: Going to pan out?
00:42:22.754 - 00:43:03.834, Speaker D: But my general intake is like, social graphs take very different forms where there are different topology and every different social application, their different geo user base. So for favor, I think it's the right approach for them. Right when they are at the intersection of different protocols and they can freely leverage all of them, as well as having this kind of aggregator effect in the long run, I think it's the ones that really provide value or provide user retention will win in the long run. And, yeah, I don't have a crystal ball. Like, I think. I think Faber is doing well. I like, I like them.
00:43:03.834 - 00:43:16.974, Speaker D: I like how they're integrating with us. They're just starting to integrate with. They started integrating with the profile set up earlier and they're integrating with the content part of as well. I'm just excited to see how this experiment plays out.
00:43:17.514 - 00:43:35.934, Speaker A: Yeah, and I guess on the juicier part now, because obviously the way that Facebook and Twitter make so much money is through is by not opening up their data. So for cyber connect, obviously you can't just, like, close source all your data and become, you know, another Facebook. So how does cyber connect actually makes money in the long term?
00:43:36.594 - 00:44:15.434, Speaker D: Well, there are different, different ways, and we've been experimenting with the revenue model from the very beginning. One is what we're seeing very common now, like selling usernames. People do really want to own their, like, out of everything, people want to own their username. The telegram sells their username. Twitter does with the blue check mark. YouTube does it as well. So cyber can start out when any user wants to register a cyber profile, they can either choose a free profile with a longer name or they can purchase a premium name and we've seen a good amount of revenue from just selling those user names.
00:44:15.434 - 00:45:05.042, Speaker D: So that's a good sign of user actually caring about the name. And the other part of it is really taking a very small amount of transaction fee out of all the paid transactions on the protocol. So when you are, we are minting something that requires some token or like where you have to pay to mint something, we take a small fee out of that. These are very early, by the way. Again, I don't know how the protocol is going to play out. I think the monetization model is going to change so much when we have much more user base. But I think just having a fair distribution and fair way of looking at all this transparent data sets, we can really easily reward those good players.
00:45:05.042 - 00:45:35.626, Speaker D: Among network. I don't think ads are bad players. Ad networks and ad providers, they're the ones actually paying for everything. And it's just like they are not really paying for everything. Like a lot of what they pay goes to the pockets of Twitter or Facebook. But having a more transparent, more efficient network could overall make this whole network a positive sum game instead of a zero sum. So that's my initial take.
00:45:35.626 - 00:46:04.984, Speaker D: We're still very early, by the way. We're also exploring a different, a lot of different stuff where maybe the identity plays a stronger role, where users have a cyber wallet that's attached to a profile. So taking the profile even a step back where beginning, they're beginning their journey into web3 starts with something that's attached to cyber connect. So that's something we're exploring as well. But, yeah, very early.
00:46:05.744 - 00:46:36.352, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm excited about how early it is, and I think this is a perfect segue to our last question, which is, you know, you see all these web two social platforms coming up with new dopamine loops. Like, be real. I think every year there's like some form of new gimmick for social that keeps pulling new users in. And it seems like the web two guys have really mastered a way to capture users. So how do we convince people to switch from web two to web3 social in the next, you know, in the next few years, a couple of.
00:46:36.368 - 00:47:05.460, Speaker D: Things I think will play out. One is like, the dopamine part of it doesn't really, it's, it's not bound to a web two or web3. Right. You can always do all these like, infinite scroll kind of play or like some kind of gamification where users want to see how they're rewarded with the next video or with the next scroll. But then, most importantly, is how we are treating the creators. Right. Like, these platforms eventually are run by the creators.
00:47:05.460 - 00:47:40.412, Speaker D: It's not by Twitter or by YouTube. Creators have to have a sustainable, long term model for them to work. I mean, there are some kind of social networks where they're focusing more on, like, the closed circles, like be real or Snapchat, where you don't. It's not really necessarily like social media. It's like more a DM type of a, like, communication tool. But for the type of the social media or the people or where content creators are most important, they have to have a sustainable way of making money in the long run. And that come back.
00:47:40.412 - 00:48:40.330, Speaker D: That comes back to how we're solving this from the beginning. One lesson that we learned from building DLI was we were able to bring PewDiePie, the largest youtuber at the time, onto Dlive, was really aligning their goals with the company's goal or with the protocol's goal. So when PewDiePie joined D Live, he is technically a stakeholder of the protocol. So everything that he earns is in the token that we had before. And he became the biggest, one of the biggest stakeholder of the network. And I think that could really bootstrap, like, onboarding web two creators to web3 with the right amount of incentive, where they're no longer just like, oh, this is a new platform I just want to explore and I just want to, I don't want to get, like, I have this fomo of not like, if I don't get onto the new, I'm going to miss out. Now, if they get on Cyberconnect, they are actually part of the network.
00:48:40.330 - 00:48:51.394, Speaker D: They're very early. They're going to be biggest stakeholder of the network. So that's how we are going to, with the right amount of incentive, we're going to onboard all the creators from Web two.
00:48:52.654 - 00:49:17.994, Speaker A: Yeah. And I honestly think this is one of the most overlooked verticals and people are often thinking about it the wrong way. So hopefully this episode will be out there and change the narrative on it and get people excited again. So I'm really, really excited for this coin, this launch as well. So, Ryan, for people who want to keep up to date with what you guys working on, with trying out Cyber Connect, for creators who want to create your link, three profiles, you know, what's one place they should go to right now?
00:49:18.614 - 00:49:46.636, Speaker D: Please follow us on Twitter for now. Until Twitter, until we build something better than Twitter. So I love that you can find us on cyberconnect hq on Twitter and we'll build something out better. Hopefully next in the next episode we can showcase something I'm not going to end this with. Go to follow us on Twitter. Yeah, we're also on link three, so link three, two. Cyberconnect.
00:49:46.636 - 00:50:05.224, Speaker D: You can find everything about us as if you're a developer. Come build with us. Build on top of Cyberconnect. You get all the user base, get all the tools that we provide. If you're a user, come and explore through different applications built on cyber Connect. And again, thanks so much Jason, thanks so much for bringing on.
