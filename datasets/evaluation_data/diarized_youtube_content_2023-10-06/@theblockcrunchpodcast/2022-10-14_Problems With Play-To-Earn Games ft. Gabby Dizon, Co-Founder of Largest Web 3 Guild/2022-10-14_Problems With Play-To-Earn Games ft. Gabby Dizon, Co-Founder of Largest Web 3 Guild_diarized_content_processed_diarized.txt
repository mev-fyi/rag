For example, some money is at stake, some people win, some people lose, because not everyone can make money. And a game that is designed correctly will have people spending more for flexing and status. Basically, like if a game is a social network and these are the people I care the most about, then I will spend money to flex my status on this network in the same way that you're buying cryptopunks or mystic axies, for example. And that means that that money isn't really looking necessarily for a financial return, they're looking for social return.
