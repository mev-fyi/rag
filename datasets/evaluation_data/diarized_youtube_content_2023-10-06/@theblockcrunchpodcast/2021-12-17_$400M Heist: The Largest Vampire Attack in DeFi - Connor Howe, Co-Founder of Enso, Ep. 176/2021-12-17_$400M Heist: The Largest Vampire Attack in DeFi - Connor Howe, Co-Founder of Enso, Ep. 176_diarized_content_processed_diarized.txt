00:00:35.136 - 00:00:36.536, Speaker B: This episode is also brought to you.
00:00:36.560 - 00:00:51.152, Speaker C: By notional finance I like to use notional finance to get transparent fixed rate borrowing and lending on Ethereum. The upgraded and easy to use V two with token and liquidity mining is also live now at Notional Finance blockcrunch, so stick around to learn more.
00:00:51.288 - 00:01:22.856, Speaker B: Hey everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, in this week's episode, we are discussing a really, really exciting event happening in DeFi, which is a massive vampire attack. And the project behind this is Enso Finance, and it lets users create so called social meta strategies on chain, which we'll discuss what they are. And now they're launching a vampire attack on six different DeFi protocols. So in other words, they are taking full advantage of Defi's openness and snatching liquidity and users from various protocols. So to me, this is one of the more exciting things to happen in DeFi lately.
00:01:22.856 - 00:01:39.248, Speaker B: And I'm excited to learn more about what anto does, how they want to pull off this vampire attack, and the implications about open source innovation in DeFi. And as a disclaimer, Spartan is an investor in Enso. So to talk about this, I'm really excited to be joined by Connor Howe, the developer and founder of Enso. So welcome to the show, Connor.
00:01:39.376 - 00:01:40.800, Speaker D: Thanks for having me, Jason.
00:01:40.952 - 00:01:47.764, Speaker B: Yeah. So, just before we get started, I'm curious, what attracted you to this circus, this crazy world that is crypto?
00:01:48.184 - 00:02:14.232, Speaker D: Yeah. So back in 2013, I ran a lot of bot farms on World of Warcraft and runescape. So I'd level up these accounts. I would farm herbs in Runescape, for example. They were very lucrative at that point. I'd be then selling this for more gold, more accounts, build up the bot farm. And it got to a stage where these mule accounts were full and bans were coming in all the time.
00:02:14.232 - 00:02:54.504, Speaker D: So we started to diversify into crypto actually at that point for selling and buying these accounts. Then I got heavily into Ethereum in 2016, where I wrote one of the UK's first ethereum research papers, actually. So I built a Dapp back in 2016, very different space then, very kind of isolated, where people built their own dapps without interacting with others. And nowadays it's completely open. So that's kind of how I got into it. And there's a lot of philosophical beliefs that we should have an open financial system where people can fully see what others are doing and have the full traceability.
00:02:54.964 - 00:03:20.588, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I think a lot of that philosophy around creating an open and composable system is going to come into discussion very quickly when we talk about the vampire attack and what it is and how it's pulled off. So let's talk about what you're building now. So you're building a project called enSo, and it focuses on something called meta strategy. So for people who are not as familiar or they haven't come across enso yet, can you talk about what the product does and what exactly is a meta strategy?
00:03:20.716 - 00:03:54.084, Speaker D: Sure. So strategy itself is created by anyone on the platform. This can be an individual, a dAo, or a multisig. A strategy is comprised of any ERC 20 token. This token could be not limited to an LP pool, a gauge, a wrap, token, base assets, and these are deposited into the contract, generating yields. And this is called a strategy. So other people are able to invest into this strategy, and the creator is able to take a performance fee from the top.
00:03:54.084 - 00:04:37.116, Speaker D: Now, a meta strategy is when you combine multiple strategy tokens into another strategy. So for example, I can create a strategy based upon LP pull tokens and curve, I can create another one that's very risk averse, maybe stablecoin farming. And it can bring both respective tokens into one strategy. And we call this a metastrategy. So if I like your investment strategy, I could bring your strategy token into mine. And by doing that, whatever changes you do within your strategy, I will still get the exposure to. So it's bundling all together in one place and having one unified UI where anyone and everyone can create a strategy.
00:04:37.270 - 00:04:47.096, Speaker B: And just for people who haven't seen the product yet, is it kind of a drag and drop UI where people can pick different strategies and create their own stack, or how does it work?
00:04:47.280 - 00:05:17.090, Speaker D: Yep. So the user comes to the platform, they go to the create button, they select how much ether they like to start it off with. If they would like it to be public or private. Public, meaning anyone can invest. You can also set a whitelist on top of addresses that are able to invest. If you want to have a performance fee, you can set the performance fee from zero all the way up to 100 if you wish. Again, we believe in a open, transparent world where people should use their own somewhat common sense as to what is a good investment.
00:05:17.090 - 00:05:59.448, Speaker D: So for example, if someone has a 90% performance fee, maybe it's not the most lucrative. But we don't believe in putting limits around people as to what they can and cannot do regarding the creation itself. You select the base assets, then you can nest these farms. So let's say dai, you can then deposit this into compound CDAi, you can take CDAI, then you can put it into another farm and then take that LP pool token and put it into another farm. It's very simplistic. I'm proud to say that we've spent a large majority of our time on these designs. We've done the third iteration now full revamp of the application.
00:05:59.448 - 00:06:17.600, Speaker D: We work with a UX agency that does Ikea and SBB mobile, which is the national train app within Switzerland. So we put the user centric at the first because it's complicated. Underneath that we need everyone and anyone to be able to do it.
00:06:17.752 - 00:06:48.572, Speaker B: Yeah, and that's one of the things that I'm most excited for in DeFi as well, which is this kind of abstraction of complexity. Right. I think when I first looked at curve and like convex, there are these like Cvxcr, USDC, or like USDT. There's so many different assets that are very hard for non crypto natives to understand. So this abstraction thesis makes a ton of sense. And I'm curious, so in terms of what types of people will use these metastrategies, it sounds like you might be not just targeting crypto natives, but also people who might be relatively newer to crypto. Is that right?
00:06:48.748 - 00:07:13.708, Speaker D: Yep, that's true. So it's a built. It's a tool built for people who are native and who also have the DeFi experience. So they'll be able to do their arbitrary forms that only deployed 1 hour ago. If you're more new to crypto, then you can just have exposure to the base assets on Ethereum at the beginning. So it's kind of catered to whatever the user group they're looking for. And also treasuries.
00:07:13.708 - 00:07:25.350, Speaker D: So treasuries can manage their assets in a more effective way. Instead of building smart contract calls to all the other platforms and going to five, six different uis, they can now do it all through one unified place.
00:07:25.542 - 00:07:34.126, Speaker B: So do you foresee maybe Dow treasuries being a bigger source of capital for Enso than, say, retail users like me?
00:07:34.270 - 00:08:16.308, Speaker D: I would love it to be retail, honestly. I would love crypto sweaters to put their mouth kind of their money where their mouth is, actually, because I think a lot of traders nowadays say they buy this token and they just throw 1010 tokens out on their Twitter six months later, say, oh, I said buy this. This happens all the time. So I would love to see a strategy built by one of these individuals and for them to prove that they bought it at this price point and to see the performance over time. So I would love it to be more retail for individual traders, but it's not limited to that. It can also be investment daos, for example, maybe Laos. It can also be multi sicks.
00:08:16.308 - 00:08:21.692, Speaker D: It can be treasuries wishing to manage their funds all within one simple place. Yeah.
00:08:21.708 - 00:08:51.557, Speaker B: And Connor, you mentioned this kind of social aspect to it. For instance, like these Twitter influencers may be managing a public portfolio, and in the past there have been other projects that kind of do this as well. And obviously there was, I think most recently was dhedge, where there are like these public profiles doing different portfolios which people can subscribe to on chain. So can you help us walk through, you know, what about the social aspect interests you the most? Are there like analogies in the web two world that you've seen work that gets you excited or how do you think about that?
00:08:51.725 - 00:09:34.298, Speaker D: Sure, I think a lot of it comes down to retention on the platform. So we've built gamification in the background as well. It's very rudimentary nowadays to have a leaderboard and we have this as well. So people psychologically want to compete, so they want to have a higher rank in the leaderboard, same as video games. I think this is why a lot of people play nowadays regarding the gamification element. People are able to join tournaments and compete with each other. So, for example, we will have the whole ENSO community about one month after launch, where they will challenge each other and whoever is the most profitable with their strategy over the course of X days, then they will get the prize built.
00:09:34.298 - 00:09:52.134, Speaker D: Another great example of this, I can challenge you one versus one for who's the most profitable over X period of time. So the social element, we're bringing in more gamification in the background and we hope that people will kind of show their traits and will compete with each other.
00:09:52.434 - 00:10:14.506, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I'd love to kind of pivot a little bit to talk about the spicier aspect of today's discussion, which is this vampire attack that you're launching on six protocols. So I think on the day of recording, a day before, there were some press coverage, but not much detail has been given about exactly how this is pulled off yet. So can you tell us exactly what is a vampire tech, first of all, and what type of protocols are you targeting?
00:10:14.690 - 00:10:41.906, Speaker D: Sure. So this was first introduced by Sushiswap. Last year, Sushiswap forked Uniswap 141 offered very lucrative incentives for migrating your lp tokens from Uni over to sushi. By migrating the lp tokens, they burned the LP, took the underlying, and put it into one to one lp. On the sushi sites, they were able to accomplish, I think, 1.5 billion. Correct me if I'm wrong, but they've done really good.
00:10:41.906 - 00:11:13.274, Speaker D: And this kickstarted the community, and the sushi community is one of the strongest right now within the space. And this aligned the incentives very quickly for the early users for joining the platform. And it was similar minded individuals on Uniswap LP pools that could join Sushiswap. So we're doing the same, but we're doing it to six people. We're not forking anyone. We've built all our own core contracts. They've been audited as well by chain security, and we've built migration tools.
00:11:13.274 - 00:11:55.588, Speaker D: This is similar to a mobile phone provider. So if you have a mobile phone provider or BT and Vodafone want you to move over, they'll say, we'll give you some credit for moving over. So we're doing the exact same, but we're doing it to six people that have a similar concept. These six people are index co op token sets, Piedao, Dhedge, Powerpool, and Indexed, which I feel bad for index because they recently got hacked. I think they're a great team, but we built this about four months ago. So the way that this will work, you'll go to fully gamified UI. We want to bring gamified DeFi, really into DeFi 2.0,
00:11:55.588 - 00:12:27.394, Speaker D: where people are able to stake their index tokens. Let's take Dpi, for example, from index Co. They stake this four weeks later, we have the right to call a contract. This contract will then burn the index token, take the underlying, which has comp XYZ with inside, and then move over to a one to one end. So strategy now up for grabs. There's about 7800 million TvL available. This is not limited to 800 million because people can buy more indexes.
00:12:27.394 - 00:13:04.910, Speaker D: By doing this, we bring early users that believe in a similar concept. Indexes are a basket of assets. Most of these platforms are raw ERC 20 tokens. But by having a similar mindset of baskets of assets, then we can bring them over to Enso. And this will kick start the platform, kickstart the user base, and we will be giving nfts as well for the rewards of people migrating. We will also be giving native governance tokens as well for kickstarting the community and aligning the incentives. And yeah, we think it'll be a lot of fun to see how users react.
00:13:04.910 - 00:13:13.954, Speaker D: How much TVL has been migrated from previous holdings, from new holdings. Yeah, I think it'll be very interesting.
00:13:14.294 - 00:13:24.362, Speaker B: Yeah. And are these nfts and native governance tokens only given to people who migrated, or is it given to people who purchase new products on top of Enso as well?
00:13:24.538 - 00:13:53.984, Speaker D: So for the vampire tech, the nfts are only available for people who migrate. The governance tokens will be rewarded to people who migrate after the migration has happened and the platform's kick started. We have incentives for users continuously building on top of EnSo. So for example, creating strategies, investing into other strategies, rebalancing, restructuring and creating meta strategies. There's some nice incentives underneath to keep the interests aligned.
00:13:54.444 - 00:14:26.684, Speaker B: Yeah. And this is such a crazy idea, I think, especially for people who are not in crypto, because, you know, when someone wants to build like a Facebook competitor, all of Facebook's social graph is private, right? And when you see companies start to build on top of Twitter, you know, Twitter can shut off their APIs at any time if they think that whoever's building on top of them is competitive. But in crypto, you can just look on chain at who the users are on all these products that are directly competitive, and then you can just, you know, launch a vampire attack. So I'm really curious, you know, are you worried eventually that someone else would do the same to Enzo?
00:14:27.144 - 00:15:14.634, Speaker D: I welcome it. Why not? It's fair game. This helps us innovate faster. This helps the ecosystem grow more if we're constantly not competing, but more pushing each other for developing better products and who can retain the most users will be the end game. I think there is space for multiple index protocols, multiple strategy protocols, and I welcome people to do it, because if you do it, then we will start feeling the pressure and we will start building faster and we will start innovating more, and I hope this happens to the other platforms because I think it is a great concept. But I think there are some areas missing, such as fully permissionless creation. There's also missing of what assets can and cannot be used.
00:15:14.634 - 00:15:42.570, Speaker D: We don't believe in whitelisting assets. We believe that people should learn from their own mistakes. So for example, when a child rides a bicycle, generally they learn by falling off, scraping their knees, and getting back up and going again. Whereas I see the world that a lot of platforms nowadays are limiting as to what can and cannot be used. So yeah, I welcome anyone to do it. Feel free. Please do a lot of good gamification on the user interface.
00:15:42.570 - 00:15:48.186, Speaker D: That's where the fun comes from. And yeah, let's play now, before I.
00:15:48.210 - 00:16:43.060, Speaker A: Continue, I'd love to share one of my favorite products in crypto with you. Now whenever I want to trade a token, instead of going to uniswap sushiswap Bancor one x one to see where I can find the best quote, I just go to Paraswap to scan for the best price anywhere because paraswap aggregates all the popular Ethereum dexs and saves me a ton of time and headache in finding where I can trade something for the best price and lets me trade in one place. Now the cool thing is theyve also integrated with Ledger live as well, meaning I can now swap at the best prices directly from my ledger wallet. So seriously, if you are a defi trader and youre worried about the security risks of centralized exchanges, but you also dont want to scour dozens of dexs just to find the best price, you have to check out Paraswap. So head on over to Paraswap IO blockcrunch. I'd also love to take a moment to talk about the HbAr foundation. Now, if you approached me one to two years ago, I would tell you I'm really skeptical of layer one systems outside of Ethereum.
00:16:43.060 - 00:17:28.138, Speaker A: But in the past twelve months, I started to notice billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of users flocking to new blockchains left and right. And then I realized there's an actual market gap being filled. And I always love to support projects who support builders, and one of those projects is Hedera Hashgraph. Hedera is an enterprise grade public network with its own crypto asset called HBAR. And the HbAR foundation has launched, with an initial budget of over $2 billion to provide entrepreneurs with the funding and ecosystem support needed to quickly build and deploy new applications on the Hedera hashgraph network. The HbAR foundation is eager to find builders in deFi, nfts, gaming, sustainability and all sectors. So if you are a builder, a developer or creator with an idea, visit hbarfoundation.org
00:17:28.138 - 00:17:29.066, Speaker A: to learn more.
00:17:29.210 - 00:18:12.770, Speaker C: I'd love to talk a little bit about notional if you've followed the show for long enough, you know I'm pretty excited about fixed rate products. Notional finance is the leading fixed rate borrowing and lending protocol, and they've just released a major upgrade. With notional, you can not only borrow and lend at fixed rates for up to one year now, but liquidity providers also have a pretty good opportunity. Thanks to an integration with compound and a liquidity mining program, LP's can actually earn interest, liquidity fees and token liquidity mining incentives as well. We've talked with Teddy from Notional recently, and as a happy investor as well, I've been pretty impressed with how the team is building this critical infrastructure that will help onboard the next billion users to DeFi. So you can check it out today at Notional Finance blockcrunch.
00:18:12.882 - 00:18:39.084, Speaker B: Yeah, and I'm really interested in the game theory aspect of this because I remember back when Sushi launched a vampire attack on Uniswap, people were saying, well, Uniswap actually has the upper hand because they haven't launched the token yet. So after sushi is migrated, Uniswap can then launch a token. So whoever comes last in this kind of vampire attack game actually wins. I'm curious about how you think about the game theory of this. Is there an ideal strategy to launch a vampire attack to make sure you retain that liquidity?
00:18:40.184 - 00:19:07.064, Speaker D: An ideal strategy to retain that liquidity. So I think you should go for the DPI index. I would start off with that one. I would definitely get indexer from all of the platforms just to expand the knowledge to see how other people are doing it. So you can give us feedback for how we can continuously improve. Specifically on the UX and integrations layer. This is what we're mostly interested into.
00:19:07.064 - 00:19:23.104, Speaker D: And afterwards just participate in the gamification element and see if you're migrated index. If you would like to edit it, you can edit the underline. So don't envision these assets as fixed. As soon as you migrate, you're able to edit and then participate in the ENSo platform.
00:19:23.684 - 00:19:33.024, Speaker B: And when you launch a vampire attack, what is the logistics? Like, do you have to reach out to each of the team and talk to them and work together? Or is it more kind of just like surprise, we're coming for your liquidity.
00:19:35.284 - 00:20:26.634, Speaker D: So we haven't approached any of the teams we have now after the press release, just to say, no, bad blood, fair game. Let's have some fun together. If we can work together in the future, let's see what works out. Regarding the communication prior to happening, we wanted to keep it as silent as possible. The reason why for the migration scripts, we have some measures in place just in case they do upgrades. But we didn't want this to get into wider knowledge at the beginning, so we can kind of build, see what works, what doesn't work. And a great example indexed their governance, delisted about two, three indexes, which was great for us just prior to the attack because we had these in our migration script, so we didn't contact the teams prior to being in the public knowledge.
00:20:26.634 - 00:20:51.374, Speaker D: But I see this as a fun experience for all. It doesn't need to be battle. If we were to simply do very basic UI and just migrate through very simple UI, I don't think it'd be reasonable. But as we build all of this gamification, we've got nfts. It's great visuals. Then. Then I think it's fun for everyone.
00:20:52.154 - 00:21:30.330, Speaker B: Absolutely. And you also wrote a blog post about DeFi 2.0. And for people who are not aware, you can check out our episode with Faye, which is one of the DeFi 2.0 projects. But one of the core concepts in DeFi 2.0 is this idea of protocol controlled liquidity, where instead of having users deposit liquidity and they can withdraw at any time, you're actually making a trade with the protocol where you deposit your liquidity, and in return the protocol maybe gives you their native token in equivalent value at the time of transfer. So given that protocols start to own more of their own liquidity, do you think this concept of a vampire attack is mostly a DeFi 1.0
00:21:30.330 - 00:21:36.454, Speaker B: concept? Is it going to be like an obsolete thing moving down the road, or will it still have still happen to different protocols?
00:21:36.834 - 00:22:10.070, Speaker D: I think it will continuously happen, and I think people should promote it because it improves the products. Ultimately, if you need to constantly build, continuously integrate, yeah. With DeFi 2.0, with ENSo itself, you can have the LP tokens and side of the strategy. You can then have these LP tokens sent to other platforms as well. So EnSo could be a one route where you can manage all of these LP tokens that are then leased to the other protocols. So having one unified place for doing this.
00:22:10.070 - 00:22:35.110, Speaker D: So an example could be one strategy that has all of the own bonds and then you can have one entrance route instead of getting all of the different bonds. I think this will always happen. It's happening within banks. If you move from ubs, you move to Raifison, you get this credit. And I think we should promote it. It's composability. And this is what Ethereum was built for, interacting with each other's platforms.
00:22:35.262 - 00:22:58.638, Speaker B: Yeah, and I feel like users are the ones who ultimately benefit because when you migrate between different protocols, you get all the new incentives and you also get products that are pushed to innovate faster and create better features. And I guess we started to see that with, with uniswap and sushi. I'm actually surprised there hasn't been more vampire attacks. I'm curious if you have any thoughts about, you know, why haven't there been as many vampire attacks?
00:22:58.806 - 00:23:18.984, Speaker D: I think it's very risky. You put yourself in a very vulnerable position by doing this. Like your question earlier, do you think people will do this to us? Yes, I think they will. And we should promote this. I think that's primarily, primarily the reason nobody wants to create bad blood. However, this isn't bad blood. This is just how it's done.
00:23:18.984 - 00:23:40.964, Speaker D: This is composability. I hope a lot more people do this because it makes you think about your product in different ways. It's a great competitor analysis, really doing the competitive analysis and going through all of their contracts, how it exactly works, how you can do the migration, how you differentiate yourself from all of the other competitors.
00:23:41.384 - 00:24:00.396, Speaker B: Yeah, most definitely. You also mentioned earlier that actually, before we recorded that you guys have been working on version two for about four or five months now. So can you talk a little bit about what's going on there? I know there's some excitement around being able to bundle arbitrary contract calls. So can you kind of describe what's going on there and what can users do with it?
00:24:00.580 - 00:24:40.872, Speaker D: Sure. So this is where the fun begins, if the vampire tag wasn't fun already. So Ethereum was built in a way where you can bundle multiple smart contracts together and call multiple smart contracts together. Right? So for example, you have one protocol doing a protocol control value, one creating strategies, one doing indexes, one having a social network. By doing this, everyone kind of creates their own integrations with other platforms, right? So you hire developers. They have to build integrations into element, they have to build integrations into curve. They need to read all their docs and understand exactly how it works.
00:24:40.872 - 00:25:49.966, Speaker D: Now, this isn't scalable in the long term. This is who can hire the most developers? And it's an integration race ultimately, which in the long term doesn't build good products, it's only who can integrate with the most people. So with version two, we've built a generalized solution where you're able to paste any smart contract address, select the functions that you want to call, and paste it another smart contract address, and then you can nest all these calls together. So an example could be paste in an address of a farm that only deployed 1 hour ago, select the stake function or deposit function. Then in your next call you can take the return value of maybe your wrapped stake to then put it into another farm. So by having this open and transparent system where any smart contract call can be done and nested together, then it allows other projects to focus on the product itself, and it opens up the whole world of Ethereum smart contract calls. It was very interesting to kind of come to this point because we knew we were going to hit this actually.
00:25:49.966 - 00:26:29.764, Speaker D: But regardless, we went down this path of integrations because we wanted to launch earlier. However, by doing this, we've done a couple of integrations and we realized this is not good long term. We need a solution for ourselves for building arbitrary smart contract calls. We call these recipes. Now, similar to token lists on Uniswap, we'll have recipe lists where you can see all the other creators, all of the other recipes that have been created and their calls underneath. Now this opens up the floodgates for what could and cannot happen. A lot of common sense will need to come from using this sort of tool.
00:26:29.764 - 00:27:05.570, Speaker D: People will create recipes that contain honey pots that contain fake farms. Now this is why you would need a governance on top for then verified lists. You'll need projects for verifying their recipes itself that they use within the platform. That then creates a trusted layer on top. And yeah, we see the world in a way where it should be fully open. Any smart contract call should, should be done. It will be very interesting to see how other projects react to this, if they will adapt a product or they will continue on this integration race.
00:27:05.762 - 00:27:39.064, Speaker B: Yeah, so we've spoken about, I guess two big things that people maybe a year or two ago might have thought were sources of moats for Defi products. So one is liquidity, the other is like exclusive partnerships or integrations, right? And we see projects like Cream Alpha finance doing a lot of partnerships and integrations, but based on what you guys are building, it seems like not only will liquidity no longer be a mode because of the vampire attack, integrations may not be a mode as well. So in your mind, over the long term, what is the mode for a defi product?
00:27:39.224 - 00:27:41.112, Speaker D: What do you mean by modes exactly.
00:27:41.288 - 00:27:58.744, Speaker B: In terms of, I guess the protective defensive mode that allows them to retain users, some sort of positive feedback loop that helps them retain the users over time without always being at risk of being forked or having their users taken easily.
00:27:59.604 - 00:28:41.632, Speaker D: I think it's down to the community, and I think it's down to the product, and I also think a lot of it's down to ux. I think we can improve within the defi community on what user experience we have now. People will use this tool underneath. We promote it, actually, but by creating ourselves, we can enable a better product for ourselves. Social trading applications for people to build strategies for people to now go, literally farms that were deployed five minutes ago, if it was or not verified on Etherscan. And that's where the real alpha is. Nowadays, you can have people who have the best alpha, but they only have 1000, $2,000 to their name.
00:28:41.632 - 00:29:16.180, Speaker D: With a tool like this, they can now profit from it. So they can build the recipe, they can bring their recipe into their strategy, and then other people can invest into it. Now, these people can play not only with $1,000, but they can play with $20 million. Now, if people invest into their strategy and they can take a percentage off the top. Regarding forkiness, yeah, I think it will happen and we promote it again. I think it comes down to the community and the constant feedback, to the constant iterations. And I also think it comes down to the vision of the team.
00:29:16.180 - 00:29:31.948, Speaker D: So the teams came up with this idea. We've implemented it. We can see where the next steps are going to be. If it's just raw forks, then, yeah, they can keep building on top, and maybe they have the same vision, but it's not the same end goal as to where we want to get to.
00:29:32.076 - 00:29:46.354, Speaker B: That's fascinating. And I love to kind of usually wrap our discussions on a very, very big question, which is, you know, for, for you, what does success for? And so actually look like? So if you look down, you know, 510 years from now, what, what is success for Enso, sure.
00:29:46.434 - 00:30:22.998, Speaker D: I want a platform that people can use every day. That's pretty much it. So I want a platform that I can use. So this was started about a year ago where I would send ether to my friends for them to manage, so they would find low market cap coins, they would use my ether and, yeah, I mean, we all do it. They would buy it and they would manage it and I would trust it. And I thought, why can't we just have a tool that there's no trusted element for this? So the end goal is allowing anyone to create a strategy for people investing into each other's and for managing it. I see that we probably will have a mobile app in the future.
00:30:22.998 - 00:31:00.312, Speaker D: This is where the industry is going, in my personal opinion. So the Robinhood. But for social trading on the. On the phone, this right now is only built for Ethereum, but I would like to build it open for any layer, one coin, so you can have a portfolio or strategy comprised of other chains within one place. And yeah, I think it will be a tool used by a lot of people and I just want to build something that people use that makes sense. You know, a lot of people say, oh, what are you invested into? Well, here's my strategy. Just invest into it.
00:31:00.312 - 00:31:07.496, Speaker D: It's very easy this way. And instead of trusting my friends with ether, I can just directly invest into their strategy.
00:31:07.680 - 00:31:24.508, Speaker B: Absolutely. That's a really compelling vision and that's exactly why aspart investors as well. So I'm super excited to have people check this out. So for people who want to partake in this vampire attack and witness what is happening or just want to be a part of the Enso community, what are the best channels for them to do this? Yep.
00:31:24.556 - 00:31:45.356, Speaker D: So join our discord. It's very new and we're always open to advice as to how to improve the community. We have feedback loops as well for questions. If you have any questions, I'm in the discord. I'll answer you if you join our telegram. It's not as active. We recommend discord and on the Twitter as well.
00:31:45.356 - 00:32:14.434, Speaker D: You'll see most of the posts on discord about five minutes before it gets released on Twitter. So that's where all the news comes out and just, yeah, help us build a product that makes sense, where you can collaboratively invest with your friends, with a Dao, with a multi sig, and tell us what features that you would like. Because ultimately the community is the users and be part of the future and have some fun with the vampire tech. It's really good fun. Absolutely.
00:32:14.474 - 00:32:19.282, Speaker B: I'm super excited to see how this goes. So, once again, thank you so much for coming on, Conor, this has been really fun.
00:32:19.458 - 00:32:20.634, Speaker D: Thanks very much for having me, Jason.
