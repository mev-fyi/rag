00:00:00.640 - 00:00:52.880, Speaker A: The other kind of inference is when you're making the model output available to smart contracts in the first kind of model inference where you're just generally making it available. This is a race to the bottom. This is like people are trying to optimize the delivery of the model output so much they're trying to make it as cheap as possible. And in this instance, when you're trying to do inference to smart contracts, you can never get it totally cheap because the blockchain computations are expensive and because you're always going to have to use a validation technology like zero knowledge proofs to show that the output of these models is valid. It's always going to be a little bit more expensive to do inference to smart contracts. And it's a totally different target market than AI APIs in general. They're going to broader tech.
00:00:52.880 - 00:00:59.684, Speaker A: You know, this target market is going to people who are building smart contracts that want to use AI. Now why might that be.
