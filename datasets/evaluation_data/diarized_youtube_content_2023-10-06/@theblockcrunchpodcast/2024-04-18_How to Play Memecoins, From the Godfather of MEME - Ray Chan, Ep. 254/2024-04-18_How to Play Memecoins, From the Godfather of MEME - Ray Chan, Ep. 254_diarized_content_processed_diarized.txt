00:00:00.160 - 00:00:12.854, Speaker A: What is the mission for that team, for that guy to start their projects? Of course, everyone in web3 wants to make some money. But other than money, what are they trying to build? Web three offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:12.894 - 00:00:14.686, Speaker B: Our job is to buy great tech at great prices.
00:00:14.750 - 00:00:16.662, Speaker A: AI is also libertarian.
00:00:16.758 - 00:00:19.086, Speaker B: Enable a use case that people haven't been able to do today.
00:00:19.150 - 00:00:22.750, Speaker A: The next hundreds of millions of players, they will come to the market through mobile.
00:00:22.822 - 00:01:00.362, Speaker B: My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next twelve months is. Hey everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockchains podcast. I'm your host, Jason Choi, co founder of Tangent, an angel investing fund. Now, recently, as institutional investors pile into bitcoin, retail investors seem to pile into something else entirely, which are meme coins. So meme coins have surged to over $60 billion in market cap with doge at $23 billion, Shiba at $18 billion. But also a lot of newcomers like Pepe and Dog with hat also rallying in prices.
00:01:00.362 - 00:01:28.358, Speaker B: So some investors describe this emerging theme. Some of our friends in VC circles described this as financial nihilism, which is that value is completely subjective. So markets just given to attention and memes and cash versus cash flows and business models. So some even say that GameStop was actually the first mainstream meme coin. But others also say that meme coins are a gateway for people to try out crypto. So discuss all of this. What drives meme coins? What meme coins are exactly.
00:01:28.358 - 00:01:39.234, Speaker B: I'm really honored to invite one of the godfathers of memes himself, Ray Chan, the founder of Memeland and the founder of Nine Gag and one of the biggest websites in the world. So, Ray, welcome to the show, man.
00:01:39.694 - 00:01:41.394, Speaker A: Thank you. Thanks for having me.
00:01:41.854 - 00:02:00.474, Speaker B: So before we dive into Memeland, I know before Memeland, you were really known for starting nine gag, which is a platform that became synonymous with Internet culture and humor. And to this is still one of the biggest websites in the world. So how was the experience starting and running nine gag? How did that lead to the creation of Memeland?
00:02:01.774 - 00:02:50.074, Speaker A: We started nigh in 2008, so that's almost like 15 years ago. And it started as a simple product to solve our own problem, own needs, where it's, oh, if I want to see funny content, where can I find it traditionally? Okay, you can type on Google, but most of the content on Google is not really that great, especially about memes and stuff, because it's kind of like outdated. So we just create a very simple website for people to share funny videos, funny content in the past, we didn't even know the word meme. It's just funny pictures, funny videos. But after some time, meme become more mainstream, and then people have been talking about memes. It's not any insider niche topic anymore. And then that's why I would say that meme is almost like in our blood.
00:02:50.074 - 00:03:07.874, Speaker A: We didn't choose meme. Meme chose us because we are like an open platform for people to share the content. But at the same time, meme needs community. So we have been building communities for the last 15 years. So it's almost like a natural shift for us to go into web3, where people talk about meme and community all the time.
00:03:07.954 - 00:03:32.658, Speaker B: I'm very excited to partner with Yield guild games to bring you today's episode. You may remember YGG as the leading guild in Web three that helped drive the success of games like Axie, Infinity, and Pixels. But they actually have much bigger ambitions than just that. I've really enjoyed co investing with and learning all about gaming from their founder, Gabby Desant, throughout the years. So here is Gabby to tell us more about why YGG is more than just a guild and why you should care about YGG as the dominant guild protocol.
00:03:32.786 - 00:04:10.110, Speaker C: Yeah. The way to think of YGG is that it's a guild protocol or a platform that wants to scale all guilds operating in web3. For people to care about platforms, typically you have to jumpstart the content yourself. And we had to be the. The biggest guild in Web three, which we've done in the last three years. But for this year, we're really making sure that we want to scale guilds of all levels that can put gather community, bring themselves on chain, and go on quests that can have them earn crypto or own their own assets. And YGG is the protocol that will be able to scale that across all guilds?
00:04:10.302 - 00:04:44.584, Speaker B: Yeah, because I notice a lot of successful web two founders when they come to web3, they don't usually understand the crypto game. There's so many things that are different, the attention part of it, the hype part of it. But to me, you seem to have an intuitive understanding right away. So I think I remember when we first chatted when we were exploring crypto, and then we chatted again a few months later. You were completely already caught up with everything, and you were kind of noticing things that even me, as a full time person, I wasn't noticing at that time. So are there any parallels between web two meme world and the crypto world that made it easy for you to make that transition.
00:04:45.444 - 00:05:36.150, Speaker A: One good example would be like social media. It's almost like when we talk to our mom or like our parents, they don't understand social media. For the one who are more like trendy, maybe they use Facebook, but they don't understand TikTok, they don't understand Instagram. And then for the one who actively using TikTok and Instagram, somehow you always feel that they are cringy and stuff like that. It's almost like when you are like a normal web two founders, you just found everything in web3 so weird. I mean, you know that there's a big opportunity, right? Because people have been talking about it for over ten years and then there's a lot of so called money right in it. But the thing is, it seems that it's really, really hard to learn about web3 by just reading like articles or listening to podcasts, right? I mean, of course if they listen to like a block crunch, I think it's better.
00:05:36.150 - 00:06:12.522, Speaker A: But most of the time, most of the Twitter spaces and hosts actually don't know that much. So they share their own view. And by listening to them, you actually don't really know the full picture. So for us, on one hand, because of our experience, if not get with social media, it's almost like we are always trying to stay young as a product, as a company, as a person. On the other hand, it's because I pay to learn. Pay and lear and learn, right? I believe that the best way to learn is actually, hey, get your hands dirty, right? Get, get your skin in the game. That's why I bought a lot of nfts.
00:06:12.522 - 00:06:49.814, Speaker A: I think maybe I spent like 3000 eve 4000 eve to bought NF to buy NFT when Eve was like fucking like $4,000, right? So it's like a full cycle, right? So, so when you, when you have so much pain, right? When you are down back so much, you probably can learn really, really fast. It's almost like crash course. Crash course. Literally crash so that you learn. So that helps a little bit. And luckily, and we are so happy that the markets are finally bouncing back, more people are paying attention to crypto, to web free again. So I would say that it all pays off.
00:06:50.834 - 00:06:58.946, Speaker B: So let's talk a little bit about Memeland. So what exactly is Memeland for people who've never heard of it? Or maybe people who know nine gag, but not Memeland, how should they understand.
00:06:59.010 - 00:07:51.642, Speaker A: What Memeland is for people who don't know Memeland? This is the web3 company that me and my co founder started. It's like a separate company from Nyga, but the team is basically all come from NygA who have the experience in building community, building product building software, building social media. The mission of Memeland is very straightforward. We want to bring ownership to every community in the world. We try to become the social platform on web3. When people talk about social, they talk about social fi, okay, how to add more like cryptocurrency or to social media. I think the way that we think about it is how can we leverage the power of social to actually educate people about web3, to get people participate in web3? Because one thing that I learned about web3, which is the most impressive part, is people actually have a stick.
00:07:51.642 - 00:08:42.060, Speaker A: I mean, if you are early, you actually can, can get more of it and you can co build a community, you can co build a product, co build a token together. This is something that's like so beautiful, right? That's why, that's why we started this, to experience that. And to us, we didn't have the best start because when we first launched our first NFT collection, it's called UW MVP. Right now we rename it to meme land MVP. That was in June 2022. It's like two weeks after Laluna crash and everyone was so panicked and they all feel like, oh, shit, this is the end of the crypto world. And then no one really wanted to buy NFT because NFT is something that, okay, when the token price is going up, most people, they actually don't buy NFT and the price is going down.
00:08:42.060 - 00:09:21.498, Speaker A: People also don't buy NFT. So somehow you need people to have certain confidence in the token price and then they think that, okay, this is a good store of value when you buy NFT to join the community, to participate in it. And that's how NFT can kind of go up in price. So we launch at not the worst time, but I would say second to worst time because that year and FTX also crashed. So we know that, hey, Luna, crash was not the worst with the FTX. Crash is actually the worst of that year. So we started that and then it's a 420 items collection.
00:09:21.498 - 00:09:42.566, Speaker A: We minted at like five from three eve. That was like, I mean, when I look back, I was like, shit, we didn't know shit, right? It was like so expensive, right? But at the time we thought, hey, Bloomberg's was minting at like 2.5 Eve, right? And they have like 10,000 items in their collection. We only have like 420. And we are. We are from nigh gad, right? And then if we mint it at like 5.3, it's acceptable.
00:09:42.566 - 00:10:09.586, Speaker A: Especially when the price was not set by us. It's actually set by a vote from the community. So of course people vote without any like, burden, right? Without any responsibility. Just like how people vote in real life. So somehow we didn't even mince out. We wanted to sell like 300 of MVP's. Turn out, we only sell like, we only sold like 200.
00:10:09.586 - 00:10:43.614, Speaker A: That was like a wake up call for us. Shit. Web two, I would say web two, presence and experience and clouds. It doesn't transfer directly to web3. So it's almost like we need to go back to the drawing board to understand, okay, what is the web3 culture that we need to embrace? So in July, we started another collection called the potatoes. Right now we call it like meme ram potatoes for the sake of easier to find it. It was a free mint because at that year, at that time, Goblin town, I don't know whether people still remember it.
00:10:43.614 - 00:11:28.336, Speaker A: They created the free mint meta where you actually can do a free mint, but the team can actually get a royalty as a revenue stream. Of course, that ship has long sail, but with potatoes, it gives us the first hand experience in managing 10,000 items, a bigger NFT community, because the price is free. So somehow people expectation was lower. Of course, right now, people still have very high expectation. And this gives us a good chance to learn about how to really build a wealth free community. And potatoes right now is actually the only free means. I mean, if we talk about the market cap or the value of free means, number one is crypto punk, number two is the potatoes.
00:11:28.336 - 00:11:57.058, Speaker A: It's so crazy when you think about it. Of course there's like a big gap, right? But we are number two and the number three is actually way, way below us, right? I think that's the potatoes. And then at the beginning of last year, January 2023, we finally minted our mint collection called the captains. Right now it's called the meme captains. And we mint at like 1.069 Eve. And then when Eve was like $1,200, right? So we sold out in twelve minutes.
00:11:57.058 - 00:12:33.650, Speaker A: And then right now, I think the fall price, I think they dropped a little bit. These days it's still at like four if you. But if it's like 4000 on paper, every minter, they actually have like 800% return. So we did a decent job on that. And the last thing is actually launching meme coin in November last year we joined binance launch pool and then we launched a token. Right now I think we have about 3 billion FTV and then maybe a few hundred million as a market cap. So I think we started with NFT and then we stepped into fungible tokens.
00:12:33.650 - 00:12:47.882, Speaker A: And then right now we're launching products. We just launched sticklens a few days ago, which is our first product. So I would say we almost touch on every part of our web3, and every part is not an easy fix. Yeah, yeah.
00:12:47.898 - 00:13:13.166, Speaker B: I always thought it's very interesting. I feel like Memeland, it has a token called meme, but it's not really, really a meme coin in the strict sense of like no utility in the sense that you guys are actually building. You've dropped multiple NFT projects, you're building actual products, which you just launched like a staking product called Stake Land. So when you guys were kind of coming up with the idea of meme land, clearly you guys didn't just want to build like a doge type of meme coin.
00:13:13.190 - 00:13:13.350, Speaker A: Right?
00:13:13.382 - 00:13:23.564, Speaker B: So what is the right way to understand, you know, meme? Is this a meme coin? Is this kind of a coin that's embracing meme culture, but it's not a meme coin. What is the best way to think about that?
00:13:24.184 - 00:14:16.342, Speaker A: I think the best way is the best definition is, hey, we all have our own definition of meme because, hey, how can you say that this is not a meme coin? Honestly, I believe that bitcoin is also a meme coin in some way. Because at the end of the day, I believe that the world is made of memes. And it's just some of them, they're more cooked if I set by SPF. I know that it's not the most popular person right now, but I think that actually is a very good insight about meme, about value. Because when we look at a lot of things in life, okay, how come this sneaker is worth that much money? How come that, like a painting is worth so much money? It's all an accreted, I would say, valuation. And meme is almost like an accredited valuation on the other hand as well. So I believe that we can all have our own definition of meme coin.
00:14:16.342 - 00:14:42.882, Speaker A: We can all have our own definition of meme. The challenge is whether other people share your definition. If they share it, then you have a community, then your meme can actually spread. If you. Oh, I think that, oh, I'm a funny guy, I take a funny photo. But if the whole world doesn't agree with you, then your photo is only your meme, but not the meme of the world. So this is something about the meme definition.
00:14:42.882 - 00:15:18.038, Speaker A: Okay, then we take a step back. Actually, when we launched Memeland and then we launched a token called meme Coin, we got some criticism from some crypto oG. They think that, hey, they tried to capture the ticker, they tried to capture the name, so that people are misleading people and shit. To me, I was like, hey, we have been working on memes before you started in crypto. And to us, Nagat is all about memes. And in our web3 company, we call it, like, meme land for our token. Of course, it's called meme coin.
00:15:18.038 - 00:15:47.484, Speaker A: It doesn't make sense for us to call it lancoin. That's why we call it meme. And of course, luckily, meme is almost like a big category of every crypto cycle. So somehow I believe that on one hand, we embrace the meme culture. On the other hand, we also want to do something meaningful for our community. Because if we zoom out and look at a lot of the meme coins in this space as a category, it always survives as individual token. Only a very few one can survive to the next cycle.
00:15:47.484 - 00:16:20.476, Speaker A: What we try to do is, on one hand, we want to become like the meme coin. On the other hand, we also want to build something meaningful for our community. But if you look at our white paper, when we launch, we literally say that this is useless, no intrinsic value. On one hand, we want to set the expectation lower. On the other hand, this is, like, for legal reason as well, because, okay, a lot of the regulators, they don't like tokens to promise a lot of things because that means that you are selling securities. But for us, we literally tell you that we are not doing shit. But, okay, right now we have time, we have resources.
00:16:20.476 - 00:16:46.694, Speaker A: Maybe we build something interesting for our community. And if you like it, you can also build it for our community as well. I believe that this may be a better way to launch a good token, especially if the team is legit. For us, we have been around for like, 15 years. For Nyga, we've been around for like, two years through the bear. For Memeland, I would say that we are one of the more credible teams in the space. So we can pull it off.
00:16:46.694 - 00:16:49.198, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, I remember.
00:16:49.366 - 00:16:54.230, Speaker B: So, for me, myself, I've never really done a lot of meme coins. We trade.
00:16:54.342 - 00:17:19.094, Speaker A: Seriously, you always analyze shit, right? So basically, you always try to see who was the trend, what's the reason behind it. It's almost like the y curve kind of guy and also the left curve kind of guys. Hey, this is fucking me, man. I just ape in. So it's like two different types of investors. So I would say that both are okay. Both are right, because honestly, no one can really predict the market.
00:17:19.094 - 00:18:10.268, Speaker A: But I just feel like, on one hand, one thing that I learned from social media, from our decade of experience with social media, is if something is popular, instead of criticizing it, try to understand why by having this kind of exercise, we actually will stay updated. Because I remember when TikTok was launched, when they just bought, like, musically, and everyone saying, oh, it's so stupid. It's mind numbing. People just follow the screen and dance and do the mouthing and stuff like that. But the thing is, fuck, it's like the biggest social media in the world right now. I think the same case happened with Snapchat, with Pinterest, with all these stuff. That's why a lot of traditional investors, they always believe that, okay, for social media type of stuff, they actually need a younger person to tell them why it is hot.
00:18:10.268 - 00:18:39.444, Speaker A: I feel like in crypto, a lot of the things are kind of like that. So for people who are very smart, very mature, I think they almost have to embrace it and then talk to more normies to understand why they love it. And most of the time, maybe that's the game changer. I mean, for the normies, they need to be more analytical. For the fearful, analytical type of person, they actually have to embrace the culture more. It's almost like we are not perfect. We have our own witness.
00:18:40.264 - 00:19:05.958, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think that's a very fair assessment as well. Actually just hired someone who was, like, just into the very degen shit coins just to kind of. He's very young as well, so just to refresh our minds a bit. And I remember, like, when I talk to founders, when I decide what to angel invest in, it always starts with the product first. Hey, this is what we're building. And then maybe we have a token. But then with your chat, I remember it was very interesting because you're basically like, hey, we're doing a token.
00:19:05.958 - 00:19:34.724, Speaker B: There's no product, there's no roadmap. And I was like, okay, so what are we investing in here? And you're basically like, okay, the people will come. And I thought that is such an interesting parallel to Ninegek as well, because you mentioned that when you started Ninegek, you didn't start it as a meme site. You didn't seed it with memes. People came and then brought memes. So there's a lot of parallels there. I'm curious, do you think of it the same way as well? Do you expect people to come and then meme coin is the shelling point for them to come together, and then they build things around that?
00:19:35.024 - 00:20:14.678, Speaker A: This is a good question. I remember it's really hard to convince you because it's almost like, hey, why? Well, actually, are you building? You keep asking very, very difficult questions. I know that I didn't do a good job, but I'm lucky to have you as our investors so that we can kind of, like, you can guide us in the space. And I think one thing that I want to share is, first time founders, they focus a lot on the product. Second time founder, they usually focus on the distribution, because if you own the distribution channel, you can distribute all kind of shit that you want. Of course, if some shit actually is good, then people will love it. Then it can amplify, it can multiply the final result.
00:20:14.678 - 00:21:01.134, Speaker A: But no matter how good your product is, if no one knows it, if no one uses it, it's still just a very small business for us. I believe that meme is something powerful in a way that is the easiest way to get into people's store, to get into people's wallet. And if we can mobilize good enough of people believing in that, then we can make use of that community to build something that has the highest value to that community. So it's almost like we kind of like working backwards in, okay, we have an idea and then we build it, and then we get people. This is actually very web two way. On the other hand, we try to create a community first, and then we create something meaningful and valuable to the communities. If they like artwork, then we can invest in art pieces.
00:21:01.134 - 00:21:40.156, Speaker A: If they like social product, then we build social product, we invest in social products, and then if they just love to make more money and getting more airdrop and stuff, then we launch sticklet. I think it's almost like we understand what our users want before we actually build it out. We were the first asian companies that joined Y Combinator and also like 500 subs. One thing that stick with us is the slogan of YC is make something people want. And I feel like a lot of the things in crypto in web3 is, hey, I have something I want and I want people to love it. That's why they have a hard time getting that product. Users.
00:21:40.156 - 00:21:59.012, Speaker A: Meanwhile, a lot of the meme tokens. A lot of the meme coins out there, they actually just fun. And if you believe in the fun, then you do it. How sustainable is the next phase of challenge? But when talking about go to market, having fun, creating value together, I think that is the easiest sell among all the categories.
00:21:59.068 - 00:22:37.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I remember when I first kind of told our peers that, hey, we're investing in this thing called Memeland. It was very hard to convince the VC's because like you mentioned, a lot of the VC's are used to this kind of thinking where we got to build the product first. But then in tokens, I always, in crypto, I always tell founders that there's actually two products you're building. One is the actual product that people use, but the token is a completely separate product. It's a distribution channel. And I really like the fact that you guys just completely double down on the distribution channel first. But you guys also earnest in the sense that I think this is the only team that really understands attention and didn't strike me as like, hey, we're in it to make a quick buck.
00:22:37.674 - 00:22:39.774, Speaker B: We're here to launch a Joe Biden coin.
00:22:41.194 - 00:23:11.780, Speaker A: Again, I think that a lot of teams were really good at getting attention even in the past. I mean, a lot of the tokens that crash, they actually do a really, really good job in marketing. But I believe that to run a business, to run a sustainable, honest business, there are a few elements that we need. If we lack one of them, then it may not end well. Number one, of course, you have to be passionate about the idea. Number two, you have to understand how to sell the product. That means the marketing.
00:23:11.780 - 00:24:00.226, Speaker A: Number three, you actually have to know how to build a product. Then, number four, you actually know how to find, I would say, form a good team so that it can kind of like amplify every element in that formula. And then the last part is, the part that I believe that most crypto people ignore is, okay, whether those guys are actually good guys. Of course, power corrupts people. Absolute power absolutely corrupts people. But the thing is, what is the mission for that team, for that guy to start their projects? Of course, everyone in web3 wants to make some money, right? But other than money, what are they trying to build? I'm like a very normal guy, born and raised in Hong Kong. I studied law, didn't study shit at college.
00:24:00.226 - 00:24:30.476, Speaker A: That's why I didn't become a lawyer. But the thing is, we understand that, hey, we want to create something impactful. I have a kid right now. I want him to be proud of me. I'm not saying, oh, legacy, shit like that, but at least he can tell his classmates, oh, his dad actually works in like a company called Meme Land, right? They actually are building interesting stuff, but not like, oh, shit, my dad is like in jail. I don't want to be that. No matter how much money you have, it's not worth that part, right? I love Hong Kong.
00:24:30.476 - 00:24:53.088, Speaker A: I love to live in Hong Kong. I don't want to live in like Bahamas. No shit to Bahamas. But all my families, I'm friends. I'm mostly in Hong Kong. That's why I want to make sure that the things that we do are legal, the things that we do are safe from the legal perspective. And also interesting enough, because I believe that in web3 there are so many opportunities, so many inefficiencies that we can solve it.
00:24:53.088 - 00:25:18.208, Speaker A: Then we can create value together with our community and also for our team. One thing that I always share with my web two founders friend, when they are asking about web3, by the way, no one asked me about web3 for the last two to three years. Maybe one or two. But these days, so many founders friends reach out to me, hey, Ray, I want to start a token. I want to start a project. What should we do? Number I give them like two. I wouldn't say advice.
00:25:18.208 - 00:25:40.020, Speaker A: Two sharing. Number one is, hey, let's buy some NFT first. Let's buy some token first. When you buy it, you can feel it. When you feel it, you can actually make the best decision. Number two, give before you take. This is something very, very important because when you try to, oh, just sell some shit to people, then people will see through you very, very quickly.
00:25:40.020 - 00:26:12.726, Speaker A: One thing that I like and also dislike in web3 is people are very skeptical, even though everyone in web3 right now is like early. But they're so skeptical. Tool works like everything, right? But at the same time, they're also aping into all kind of shit. It's almost like a very, very like a contra. I mean, not. It's almost like bipolar kind of type of people in web3, right? So by getting your skin in the game and also try to give before you get, I think that's something that we need to learn before we enter web3.
00:26:12.790 - 00:26:36.260, Speaker B: I mean, I've been offered so many influencer meme coin deals and like 60% discount three months long. I've turned all of them down over the past five years. The only kind of meme coin that I invested was you guys because I was able to follow your journey from day one. And I knew kind of the motivation for coming into this space, and I saw kind of the fact that you guys started in probably the most painful time in the market, told me that, okay, these guys are not really in it for a quick buck, and these guys don't need to. I mean, they run.
00:26:36.292 - 00:26:37.836, Speaker A: Or maybe these guys are just stupid.
00:26:37.900 - 00:27:10.214, Speaker B: Yeah, it could be, but I don't think that's the case right now. But I'm really curious, because when I was looking at the numbers for nine gig, there's like 100 million monthly users that's, like, bigger than the entire crypto market right now. So when you move to a slightly smaller market in terms of, like, number of people, what are some of the things that you have to adjust? And let's say crypto gets to 100 million daily active users, what do you think are things that founders today who are running applications right now or tokens right now will need to struggle to adapt to?
00:27:11.034 - 00:27:55.834, Speaker A: I think number one would be, it's not a fair comparison because it's almost like comparing a freemium game to a paid game. That means if you look at the number of audience per free tv stations, they will always be bigger than subscription like streaming services. But the value per user is different, and also the quality of the content can be very different. I believe that when we compare audience or followers of Naga, we have about 200 million audience across the world on our different platforms. But the thing is, most of them, they use it for free. They kind of keep taking value outfit, right. And to be honest, it's very replaceable.
00:27:55.834 - 00:28:06.866, Speaker A: Yeah. Because, okay, I don't. I mean, let's say, oh, Nyga kind of like shut down. Oh, I miss you. Right. People are always like that when you shut something down. People say that they love you, right.
00:28:06.866 - 00:28:37.272, Speaker A: It's almost like when you die, everyone loves you, right. But at the same time, when you are alive, actually, people don't really give a fuck. So I think that the challenge here is people like you, but not like you enough so that they will get their, I would say get their skin in the game, right. That get. Invest their money in it, right. I think that's the issue of, like, web two companies, especially on social media. That's why a lot of the social media companies, they have to rely on advertising, because people feel like their time is cheap, right.
00:28:37.272 - 00:29:18.840, Speaker A: And honestly, a lot of people, they have a very low opportunity cost. That's why they don't mind reading ads and stuff. I think when we were younger, we wasted so much time, right? Why? It doesn't really matter that much if we want like a 32nd ad. I don't even want to pay for YouTube premium. But when you finally time becomes more scarce with scarce resources, then you think that, oh shit, maybe I should take taxi instead of taking bus. It's not because I become richer, it's just because my time is more valuable to me. I think this kind of thinking will always be there because there are always people, they will not want to invest in anything, and somehow they just want to invest their time.
00:29:18.840 - 00:30:49.740, Speaker A: So I would say that web two product without any capital commitment will always be bigger. But it's not a fair comparison. But at the same time, if we can make sure that, okay, people know that what we're building is meaningful, it's valuable, it creates utility, utility, not in the traditional, I would say web3 definition, but more like economic definition of utility. Almost like similar to like value, right? If we can explain to people why this is valuable and how this is like better than any other products that you're using, then we shot to like reach like 100 million of like active daily, active daily active users, right? Because the thing is, a lot of the issues right now is not about the concept, it's about the execution. It's about the go to market. It's about what are the products that you actually want people to use it. Again, as I mentioned, a lot of the word free product is something that nerds, geeks sit in front of the computer and then they believe that that's what the world wants, right? And that's why when they launch something, especially in Defi and a lot of like this kind of stuff, it's like so complicated that even if you talk to like economics professors, he will not understand what you're doing, then how do you expect to have a lot of users? I believe that on one hand, we have to improve how we present ourselves, how we go to market, how we design the UI Ux.
00:30:49.740 - 00:31:53.878, Speaker A: But at the same time, it's almost always about, hey, let's stop trying to have a solution first and then try to find a problem. Let's go back to the drawing board, find a problem first and then try to do it. I believe that a lot of the issues in web3 right now is because it's not because people are stupid, it's because people are smart. That's why they don't want to waste their time on your product after you airdrop to them, because they know that, okay, if your product actually doesn't solve my problem, but your product is giving free token, and then token will pump, why don't I get it? Why don't I farm it? And that's what they focus on right now. And at the same time, most of the valuable product they actually started look like something meaningless, but because they are fun to use, then it keeps getting people engaged and then they make people stick, it becomes sticky. That's how it can grow in value. Look at bitcoin, look at Ethereum, I look at Solana, and I think a lot of this kind of actual use case is almost like they solve, they cross that hurdle.
00:31:53.878 - 00:32:13.836, Speaker A: And I believe that meme coin Memeland has a good chance, not because we have like 200 million at our pocket, 200 million people, not money right at our pocket, but because we kind of see that, hey, shit, maybe it's not that complicated. Maybe we actually have to dumb it down so that more people can understand. Yeah, yeah.
00:32:13.900 - 00:32:36.534, Speaker B: My framework for understanding Memeland, I don't know if you agree, but I feel like it's much more similar to something like Solana than something like doge. And what I mean by that is when Solana first launched, like a lot of l one s, they didn't launch with all of the products on top, but you can't do anything on it. There's nothing on it. It was just a token for l one. And the devaluation was pegged to a dream. People think this could be like the next ethereum. And then the people came and then it became reflexive.
00:32:36.534 - 00:32:59.944, Speaker B: More things are built and then similar for you guys, right? When you first launch a token, you literally tell people, hey, this is not going to do anything. And then over time, more people come and then some products emerge. So it's almost like if Solana is like a technical infrastructure for products, you guys are like a social infra. You guys have the distribution and reach. So it's quite different from like the full on meme coins, like dog with hat, which really doesn't have anything.
00:33:00.444 - 00:33:38.582, Speaker A: This is one thing that is a very interesting observation. At the same time, if we zoom out when we talk to light Solana holders, by the way, I bought Solanas in the last bull run. I think that the highest price that I bought was like $200, right? So, I mean, I was to exceed liquidity. I'm still is. So I'm still am. But this is also a learning, right? Oh, shit. Solana reached like all time high in two years, but I'm still down bad, right? But at the same time, this is a good experience, because you can see how the narrative doesn't really change that much for Solana.
00:33:38.582 - 00:34:14.614, Speaker A: It's like lower gas fee, faster. Whether people believe in that, whether people argue that is still the main selling point. And I think that's the problem, or quote unquote, problem of like ethereum, especially for the mainnet. And it's a good product in that sense, because you find a problem first and then you try to provide a solution. And if you get enough of people rally behind you, you have a community. And when you have a community, you can attract more resources, attract more developers, attract more, like investor money. And that's how you can create the flywheel.
00:34:14.614 - 00:34:46.411, Speaker A: So I would say that Solana is one of the good product in that sense. And of course, sometimes it kind of go down and stuff like that. And I think, I mean, even when we look at Twitter or Facebook these days, they still go down from time to time. I believe that this is just part of the growing pain on one hand. On the other hand is if you continue to create value, most people actually don't really care because most of the time it's not unfixable. It's not, oh, Solana get hacked. It's not like that.
00:34:46.411 - 00:35:47.024, Speaker A: I believe that there's something that will continue to improve. I'm quite bullish about Solana, especially after they come back from the FTX. Associated collateral damage. Of course, this is not financial advice and stuff, but we actually see more projects, more builders, more people actually talk about Solana built on Solana. I think that is quite interesting. But when you talk about the infrastructure layout, the social layer, one idea that I'm thinking, we always try to think about, I think if you talk to our team, the first questions I always ask them, hey, what's the marketing angle in this? It's almost like we do things mainly to wow people, mainly to surprise people, because a lot of the time, no matter how good your product is, if you don't know how to go to market, no one knows it. And I think a lot of stuff in web3 is kind of boring, unless it's not boring when you make money, but most of the time it's quite boring.
00:35:47.024 - 00:36:33.040, Speaker A: So what we try to do is, hey, how can we be different? It's like the old Apple slogan, think different. All the meme coins, most of them, of course, they have a team, but their team is not that transparent. Most of the time, they are totally undocumented and you don't know where they live, what their faces are, and most of the time. They're very, I would say, unhealthy beginning and unhealthy beginning in the sense that there was actually a lot of fud and stuff. Because a lot of the meme coins that we see is actually launched by the same group of people. It's just that, oh, some of the ideas stick and then that's why they are so good. Not because they are really, really talented and stuff.
00:36:33.040 - 00:37:16.264, Speaker A: It's because they're very experienced. Meme coin is very much like NFT, in a way. Hey, the more rug pools that you launch, the more sophisticated your meme is. That's why the lower, the fewer errors that you have. I'm not saying that a lot of meme coins are rug pool and stuff, but I'm saying that a lot of the projects, the one that survived is actually one of maybe like a thousand or even like 10,000 of them. And those teams, I don't know whether they started with a good heart, right? But because it's like so big, they become, they can get in the, they have more resources to deploy so that they can do more interesting stuff. And when you cross the hurdle and finally your community, then that's how the meme coin can survive.
00:37:16.264 - 00:37:46.060, Speaker A: I think Doge and then Shiba in the last cycle, and then Pepe and dog with head and also some other meme coin, I think they all share that kind of like, I would say, characteristic. I would say that Shiba is a little bit different in a way that they try to launch their own l two. They try to do more apps and stuff. They are more like developer kind of team. Right? Meanwhile, for other projects, most of the time it's really just meme. It's really just about community. If we think about the community, there's nothing there.
00:37:46.060 - 00:38:31.706, Speaker A: I think for us is on one hand, we want to embrace the ticker, the culture, at the same time, also embrace the community. But hey, can we actually build something meaningful for the community as well? Because once you kind of, like, continue to grow, people will compare you with other projects. How can you be different? It's something that we always try to do. I mean, I can definitely launch a meme coin. Totally undocumented, probably can do decently well. But how can we be different if we want to work with more legit companies, legit people? I don't believe that they will work with some totally undocumented team. People are still very cautious about that.
00:38:31.706 - 00:38:53.058, Speaker A: Of course, Satoshi is undoc, but hey, bitcoin is bitcoin. You can't compare yourself to bitcoin, and it takes, like, ten years. I don't think most of the meme coin can last for, like, one year or even ten months. So I would say that we try to embrace. We try to pick the best of both world. On one hand, we embrace the culture. We embrace the community.
00:38:53.058 - 00:39:29.294, Speaker A: On the other hand, can we build something meaningful and useful so that we can reach more people? So I would say, I mean, I share this with you, right? Hey, when we launch mem, we actually can do whatever marketing that we want. We can launch a collab with Pornhub, right? And then we can do something, like, crazy, right? Maybe we buy out the sphere in, like, Las Vegas, right? Or maybe we donate to, like, charities and stuff like that. I think there are things that we can do. I think the question is, how does it benefit to our community and whether this is something that is, like, create value and create a positive flywheel. Yeah.
00:39:29.834 - 00:39:40.894, Speaker B: So I guess zooming out a bit when you look at the other meme coins out there, you mentioned, like, dogeba Pepe and all these things. Do you like to compare meme coin to them, or are they, like, just fundamentally different?
00:39:41.314 - 00:40:12.224, Speaker A: I would say that when the price pump, I love to be associated with them. Right. When the price doesn't pump, I want people to think that, okay, we're different. It's almost like. How do I say? It's almost like a basketball? It's almost like in the NBA when you first started, you want yourself to be compared to all the great guys, all the legends, because they already make it. You want that association. Kobe Bryant was Michael Jordan.
00:40:12.224 - 00:40:55.018, Speaker A: You love that kind of comparison when you first started. But after some time, you want to be different because you feel like, okay, maybe we actually are better than Michael Jordan. Maybe we can be something great, and then after that, you will feel like, okay, maybe it doesn't matter anymore, because we find our own way, we find our community. It's almost like a kid how people grow. When you were young, we want to be the same. We want to be part of the norm, but when we continue to grow, we want to be different. So I would say that, on one hand, we want to enjoy and embrace the meme as a marketing, as a community, but on the other hand, we also want to compete with the big guys.
00:40:55.018 - 00:41:17.624, Speaker A: I'm not saying that, oh, we want to launch an l two, compete with Solana and stuff, because I believe that that's not the problem that web3 has right now. It's not more like infrastructure. It's actually more on the application side. It's actually more on the marketing side and the social media side, I think we try to focus on that. I share this with you. I'm a big fan of Charlie Munger. A circle of competence.
00:41:17.624 - 00:41:32.384, Speaker A: Hey, we have been building in social media for 15 years. We understand social media marketing through and through. We understand community through and through. We want to focus on that. Meanwhile, we also try to embrace a new tech, the new innovation.
00:41:34.084 - 00:41:56.282, Speaker B: I'm not sure if you kind of studied the other meme coins as well, but do you see any commonalities in terms of the successful ones? Because you mentioned earlier that for memes, it's very subjective. I might think this is like the go to meme for people to rally behind, but the next guy doesn't. So what do meme coins do to kind of what separates the successful ones from the 10,000 unsuccessful ones?
00:41:56.418 - 00:42:21.884, Speaker A: All the meme coins, right? They're same in a way that. I mean, it's almost like that James Franco. Like a chief, right? Same, same, but different, but still same. Kind of like that chief. I mean, I'm not. I'm really. No, I mean, I'm more like an expert in meme, but not like an expert in meme coin, right? Because I buy some, but I actually don't buy that much because I don't have time to kind of, like, look at the market and stuff like that.
00:42:21.884 - 00:43:10.514, Speaker A: One thing that they. I think a few things that they share is there will always be speculation element, right? But this is something that's very common in crypto in general. But I think that speculation element is also, at the same time, there are not that many people who are very convicted in that. But if you can turn, you can reach a critical mass, then you have a better chance to survive because people will believe that, oh, shit, there are more whales holding that token. They probably will not dump as far as me, so I can exceed comfortably. When people have that kind of, like expectation or illusion, then your token price actually can stand firmer. And then, on the other hand, is right now, when you look at all these tokens, most of them are dogs.
00:43:10.514 - 00:43:56.106, Speaker A: It's almost like. It's almost like a revenge of the traditional Internet meme. Because traditionally, cats are more popular as an Internet meme. But when you look at all the tokens, all the meme con right now, doge, and then, like, shiba dog with hat, and then baby doge. And then, I mean, Pepe is a fraud, right? But that's another thing, right? But I think a lot of them, they are dogs, right. This is also kind of interesting, right? And the last thing I would say that is a lot of them, they actually don't get the endorsement of the original meme creator. For example, like Pepe and Doge, right? They use the icon, they use the image, but actually the original creator, they don't endorse it because on one hand they don't understand what it is.
00:43:56.106 - 00:44:37.492, Speaker A: On the other hand, I just feel like they, maybe they feel that they are not respected when their creation was getting used. I understand this is pretty common in crypto, but I believe that a lot of the meme creator, they were still living in the more traditional world. That's another similarities. But in general, I just feel like you need to be able to rally the community. And I think community is a very interesting thing. It's almost like a double sided sword in a way that, okay, they can help you grow, but once you piss them off, they actually can kill you way away. I mean, we see a lot of that in NFT.
00:44:37.492 - 00:45:38.004, Speaker A: That's why I feel like people always say that NfT like shitcome with JPEG, right? But when for people who started NFT, it's like shitcoin is actually like NFT without JPEG, right? So that's shitcoin. It's almost like a ERC 1115, like a standard in a way. And also another thing that we were talking about before we started this check is when you look at who is buying meme coin these days, a lot of them were actually NFT buyers in the last cycle, but they found that, oh, shit. Oh, the liquidity of NFT is very, very low, right. And also, oh, I'm just like a very small player, right, in the blur farming game, right? So I can't really exit in a good time. Or maybe in the, in the, in the, in the shitcoin world, there are greater fools than me, right? That's why they join. So, so I believe that a lot of people who buying shitcoin in this cycle, this season is actually x NFT bias.
00:45:38.004 - 00:46:07.274, Speaker A: So I think that's also an interesting shift because traditionally the order like meme coin stuff, they are more like crypto degens, native crypto degens. But this time we see more like NFT buyers. They also buying shitcoin. But again, I just feel like what comes fast probably will also goes fast. So how can you pick the winner? I mean, there are like two ways. Number one is pick the winner. Number two is exit in a good time.
00:46:07.274 - 00:46:29.614, Speaker A: I think that's the common meme coin. I would say buyer challenges. That's why for us, we try to be different in a way that, hey, no matter which meme coin pumps and dumb, we are still here. When you search on binance and OKX, you search meme. Meme is always there. We enjoy the so called SEO. We call it.
00:46:29.614 - 00:46:56.082, Speaker A: I make up some shit called like a crypto exchange optimization. It's like CEO itself, like SEO. And I believe that, okay, oh, maybe two cycles back is like doge. One cycle back is like shiba, and this cycle is like dog with hair, like Pepe and maybe like flocky. But whatever the cycle, when you search meme in, all the top exchange meme points are also there. And hopefully the price stand. Okay.
00:46:56.082 - 00:47:58.598, Speaker A: So that people believe that, okay, we are around for the long haul. And at the same time, hey, how can we build something meaningful for our community so that they actually can, I would say, get more value out of just buying and selling? One thing that I always want to achieve, I don't know whether it's possible, is when we talk about community, how come for a community to make money, they have to sell the stuff that they like? I find this is like a very, very contradictory, like a value proposition. Right? NFT is like that. Hey, I'm a big fan of light captains, but if I want to make money, I have to sell captains. If I'm a big fan of light Doge, I love the community vibe, but I want to, but I need to sell. I don't know whether it's possible, but can we create a token, be it, like, fungible or non fungible, that the longer that you hold, the more value that you get, and you actually don't have to sell it to create a value. I don't know whether this is like Utopia and whatever, but this is something that I'm really, really interested to try to build.
00:47:58.598 - 00:48:04.342, Speaker A: We kind of make it work in NFT. I don't know whether, on the token side, it's doable.
00:48:04.438 - 00:48:42.704, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think this is very interesting to see you kind of walk through your first principles, thinking on how do we create communities? How do we maintain these communities? And I think the big takeaway for me is, like, attention comes and goes every cycle. Like you said, there's some meme coin that comes and stays. Some people make money, some people lose money. But what you guys are trying to do is to be that secular trend where every cycle, no matter what happens, you guys are sticking around. So if that is the goal, I guess my last question to you is, what do you have to do differently than these other main coins to make sure that you guys stick around? Is it kind of the more community management, is it more products, is it better marketing mix of those?
00:48:44.524 - 00:49:12.714, Speaker A: I think attention is one thing. On the other part is actually trust. Attention and trust are the most scarce resources on the Internet or basically in people's life. And they kind of go hand in hand. If you can get more attention, somehow you get more trust. That's why when you look at the influencer, when they have a bigger number of followers, people trust them more. Whether they are actually trustable, I think that's another question.
00:49:12.714 - 00:50:14.846, Speaker A: But generally, when you get more attention, people are willing to trust you more. And when people trust you more, they're willing to give you more attention. Because attention is what's the limited resources that everyone has? Because everyone only has 24 hours. If I pay attention to you, that means that I'm sacrificing other opportunities. For me, it's almost about. On one hand, we can always use a marketing campaign to boost the attention, but on the other hand is how can we build trust? Because trust is actually the unfair advantage when you build, when you actually operate a business. Because we are old enough to buy maybe our cars, our home, our shoes and whatever, where do you go to? You go to a trusted brand, even though sometimes their price may be higher, because you know that, okay, the deliverables will be good enough so that it's worth that extra premium.
00:50:14.846 - 00:50:54.992, Speaker A: I believe that this is something that we also want to work on. Because on the attention part, there's like, I wouldn't say easy job for us, but I would say that's something that we understand it quite well. And because we call ourselves token, like meme coin, we can easily do a lot of things to grab their attention. On the other hand, one thing that we know, especially compared to other meme coins, are we actually can be a more trustable, like probably the most trustable team, generally speaking. Because, hey, we are out there. You actually can see me. And then we go to conferences, talk about meme coin, to talk to people, talk to our holders.
00:50:54.992 - 00:51:30.124, Speaker A: When is the last time that, okay, some meme coin creator actually talks to that community? I believe that is almost like close to zero. And then of course, there are some tokens. They get embraced by some big names. For example, I remember Bonk. And then silly Dragon, they all get embraced by the Ming chain team. For example, silly dragons, they got some mention, I think it's by Solana founders or something like that in bonk as well. But the thing is, they are still not the team that builds it, assuming that they are like separate teams.
00:51:30.124 - 00:52:19.432, Speaker A: But at the same time, how can we be there and show up and then tell the world that, okay, the cycle comes and go, but we are here to build. And the key part is how can we put our community first? I think at meme land our slogan is, okay, we are the community company. How can we actually achieve that? It's something that it takes time to show the world and this is something that we are doing every single day. Because it's so funny that hey, no matter how much that we do, it's never enough. I would say that our communities have a higher expectation and requirement than my mom and then all the asian parents. It's almost like shit. When I talk to our holders, I would say that, hey, are they all Asians? How come they have such a high expectation? I mean, this is like a racist joke.
00:52:19.432 - 00:52:57.732, Speaker A: That's why I always believe that I would get canceled if I'm based in the US. But the thing is, I just feel like on one hand you have to listen, you have to hear what they say, but you can't get driven by the community too much. Otherwise you will just focusing on all the short term thing. Because most of the people in a community, they focus on the short term gain. On one hand, we have to embrace the short term stuff. On the other hand, we have to build something that lasts for longer. For me, as I mentioned in our town hall some days ago, hey, I want meme coin to be meme land and meme coin to my last code job.
00:52:57.732 - 00:53:21.394, Speaker A: Not because I can get retired, but because I want to make it sustain. Maybe like ten years, 15 years, 100 years. Maybe it's doable for nugget, just a simple website to share some random funny pictures. We have been running it for like 15 years. I think for something that has a way stronger, like value proposition, I believe that we can make it like decades long. Yeah, I think this is our goal.
00:53:22.174 - 00:53:33.354, Speaker B: And I think that's a great note to end this on. I don't know if I even need to plug your Twitter because I think you probably have the most Twitter followers out of anyone I've ever interviewed on the show. But we'll still include your Twitter handle below.
00:53:35.214 - 00:54:11.424, Speaker A: Hey, Jason, I have been working on social media for 15 years. Number of followers doesn't mean shit to me because I know that, hey, most of these influencer, they actually don't make money. I mean, they may have some influences, but when you ask people to buy stuff, they actually too much. That's why a lot in the social media, the actor, people who actually push the market, it's actually the micro influencer. Influencer. Or maybe they have like 10,000 followers, but they're super available, super trustable. I think that's how, how, that's why a lot of the big brands that work with the smaller influencer, all the big ones, they actually don't care too much.
00:54:11.424 - 00:55:04.516, Speaker A: So for me, the numbers is just like vanity metrics. I really want to make sure that, hey, our community feel like, hey, they are comfortable by holding onto our asset NFT and also token, because we are here to build and we are building behind the scene and also we show up in the event and stuff so that you know that we are here. I don't know. I think generally speaking, I would say that this is such a big opportunity for us to do well. I mean, I don't need to do web3 because, okay, for Naga, we are quite comfortable, but this is something that we believe that we literally can change the world. So we want to grab the opportunity to do our best. I don't want to, hey, when I die, I just feel, oh, shit, maybe we should not rug pull, right? I think this is the last thing that I want to think about when I die.
00:55:04.516 - 00:55:25.618, Speaker A: I want to. I want. Again, as I said, I want my kid to be proud of what we have building. I want our team to be proud of that. I don't want people to remove, oh, they work at meme coin or meme land on their LinkedIn. I don't want people to do that. When you talk to a lot of people like FTX or a lot of other projects, they never put that on the resume again.
00:55:25.618 - 00:55:48.154, Speaker A: Oh, I have a gap year. Whatever. Shit. Right? I mean, I understand this is bad, but somehow when you try to think about things that, hey, whatever you do, it will get public. Whatever you do, you will have a record on the Internet then that will help guide you make a better decision. So this is how we operate. And of course, there are so many things that we need to do better.
00:55:48.154 - 00:56:05.000, Speaker A: And to be honest, we are all seniors, we are all imperfect. But one thing is we learn quite fast. We show that in two years, we become the number one NFT in Asia. Top ten in the world for meme coin. We're like a top ten meme coin. Top ten nft coin. Right now.
00:56:05.000 - 00:56:10.884, Speaker A: I believe that we have a lot of room to grow and also a lot of room to learn.
00:56:12.424 - 00:56:19.480, Speaker B: I really appreciate that and really appreciate your time. Ray. This is a really fun episode, very different from a lot of the interviews we've done, so I'm excited to share this.
00:56:19.632 - 00:56:20.216, Speaker A: Thank you.
