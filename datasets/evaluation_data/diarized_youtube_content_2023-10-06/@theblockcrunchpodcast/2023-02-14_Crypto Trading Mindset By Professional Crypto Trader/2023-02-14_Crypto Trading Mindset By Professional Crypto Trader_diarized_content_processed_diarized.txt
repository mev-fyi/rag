00:00:00.400 - 00:00:50.844, Speaker A: I think that there's a tremendous amount of alpha in understanding supply and demand and where it comes from. So, for example, you look at something like an optimism and an axie, and they just had tremendous amount of supply that was coming online. And so effectively for optimism for a bit there, you have to make the bet that there was $50 million a month of buy pressure coming into actually, when it was at two, it was like $200 million of buy pressure coming in a month to keep this thing at $2. You're like, how the heck is that going to happen? Where's $200 million going to come from? That doesn't make any sense, right? And so you start to dig into the actual flows and supply and demand of these assets, and you go look like optimism might be great tech, but our job is not to buy great tech. Our job is to buy great tech at great prices.
