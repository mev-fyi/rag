00:00:00.080 - 00:00:45.018, Speaker A: Some of the tools that are very unique to us. And here is something that we are developing, which definitely, we're getting a lot of good feedback from the point for Sky Mavis is we are owning the complete stack. We have the blockchain, we have the Mavis hub, which is the distribution channel, and then we also have the wallet, where the players, that's where they first get started. What we are doing is we are partnering with game studios and we're saying if you are bringing in, let's say, 1 million users through your game, we're going to attribute that user to your, to your account. So we're tagging that user. And whenever that user is spending money on the wallet, that's actually when we, Sky Mavis, make money. So it's similar to the way that Metamask makes money.
00:00:45.018 - 00:00:59.394, Speaker A: When people click swap and Metamask, Metamask makes a cut, when people will click swap and roll in, that's when Sky Mavis will take a cut. And in that moment, when we take our cut, we're going to give, let's say, one or 2% back to the game developer in like, in the next five or ten years.
