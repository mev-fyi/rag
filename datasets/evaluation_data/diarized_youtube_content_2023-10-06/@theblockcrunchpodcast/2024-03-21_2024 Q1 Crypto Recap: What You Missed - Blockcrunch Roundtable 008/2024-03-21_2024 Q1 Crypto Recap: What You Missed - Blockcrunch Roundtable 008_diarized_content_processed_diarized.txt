00:00:00.160 - 00:00:27.768, Speaker A: Why this airdrop was interesting and why it was so notable was because it was $700 million notional value at the time of the drop. So one of the biggest airdrops ever, one of the biggest token airdrops ever on Solana. And even today, I think some of the people are still posting screenshots of how much they got airdropped. And we see stories of like five, six figure airdrops, which is insane if you think about it. Just using a product pays you an annual salary for an average Silicon Valley worker.
00:00:27.816 - 00:00:30.144, Speaker B: Three offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:30.184 - 00:00:31.976, Speaker A: Our job is to buy great tech at great prices.
00:00:32.040 - 00:00:34.616, Speaker B: AI is also libertarian right enable use.
00:00:34.640 - 00:00:36.376, Speaker A: Case that people haven't been able to do today.
00:00:36.440 - 00:00:40.040, Speaker B: The next hundreds of millions of players, they will come to the market through mobile.
00:00:40.112 - 00:01:45.366, Speaker A: My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next twelve months is welcome back to another episode of the Block Crunch podcast with me, your host, Jason Choi. I'm an angel investor and founder of Tangent, and Sana Kapoor, investor at Dragonfly Capital. Now, as a disclaimer, nothing we discuss here is financial advice, and nothing we discuss is reflective of a respective company's opinions. We may also hold assets we discuss so the context for this week's roundtable is that we just finished Q one of 2024, which has been a whirlwind. I think it's probably the most consequential three months in the history of bitcoin, as we hit all time highs and have a massive ETF just got approved that blew everybody's expectations out of the water. So if you're coming back to crypto after a few years of break because you saw a notification on your Coinbase app telling you to buy bitcoin now, this is that episode that tells you everything that happened in the first quadrant in the first quarter of 2024. And there's quite a lot, and I'm really excited to have Sanit here to recap everything.
00:01:45.366 - 00:02:04.548, Speaker A: With me, we try to curate a list of of just the five or six most major events that happened, but we ended up coming up with more. So if we have time, we try to cover all of them. But before all of that, now, Sana, this week you are in the US because you just went to ETH Denver. How was ETH Denver this time around? Was the trip worthwhile?
00:02:04.676 - 00:02:27.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, Ethan was good. Crypto conferences all start to feel very similar. And I guess the interesting thing is you kind of see trends get hotter and trends get less hot. I don't know. I was at Eat CC in Paris last year. Then I was at Defcon in Istanbul and I was at Etenberg, and every time the chorus around Eigen layer got louder and louder. Well, last summer in Paris, people were kind of interested.
00:02:27.254 - 00:03:02.310, Speaker B: This year, I swear there was a restaking or Eigen layer related event going on all the time. Anytime you could ask someone where they were and they were at the Eigenveil event, and that was just true for a period of five days, which was kind of crazy. Outside of that, I think people are excited again. You can kind of see the smiles returning to people's faces. People are objectively also obviously wealthier. Lots of teams are really excited about token launches, which is cool. I think we're finally seeing the effect of a whole bunch of companies, including our portfolio companies, are seeing that the token launch window is open.
00:03:02.310 - 00:03:41.504, Speaker B: So a bunch of teams that have been building through the bear will be launching tokens soon. So lots of conversations around that people remain excited about ZK. I think people in Ethereum land are spending a lot of time thinking about roll up fragmentation. I think it's especially given Justin Drake's recent push around it. I think the Ethereum community is seriously starting to realize that the UX of using ten different roll ups just kind of sucks a lot. And they're thinking through problem, thinking through how to solve that problem. As with all ETH events, a lot less excitement around the application layer.
00:03:41.504 - 00:03:50.008, Speaker B: But that's just kind of the way things are. And that's also the valuations are all in the infra layer for right now. So I suppose kind of lines up with what you'd expect.
00:03:50.176 - 00:04:32.326, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I guess it sounds like same old because I remember I went to the 2023 one and it was pretty quiet because that was right after all the blow ups that happened in 2022, Luna three AC and then obviously FTX earlier as well. And I remember the only things that people were excited about were like nfts and games. So I guess this time people are kind of swinging way back to the infrastructure in terms of the app to infra pendulum, which I feel like crypto always operates in. But it sounds like you had a fruitful trip. I'm excited to hear that. And I'm sure there's a lot of chatter around bitcoin as well. And that brings us to kind of a first big recap for Q one, which is bitcoin hits all time high, but it's more interesting to me why it hit all time high.
00:04:32.326 - 00:04:57.182, Speaker A: It's because we finally had this institutional ETF approved. Actually, multiple ETF's approved, which was unthinkable back in 2019. I think a lot of people were saying institutions are coming. That was the meme in 2019, and now they are really here. And then I think the numbers for the ETF also blew everybody's expectations out the water. So it started with about 20 billion, I think, in the first week and then slowly rising every single day. Every day.
00:04:57.182 - 00:05:17.816, Speaker A: We were tracking the inflows for bitcoin ETF's and it was at least half a billion dollars, sometimes more, sometimes a little bit under. But now we're sitting at almost $52 billion just sitting in bitcoin ETF's. So I guess. Did that surprise you at all? Did you have $50 billion bitcoin ETF on your bingo card for 2024?
00:05:17.880 - 00:05:55.278, Speaker B: I did not. And it's funny you say it was unthinkable in 2019. To me personally, it feels unthinkable. Versus like November of last to last year, like post FTX, you remember how like, we were like, having conversations about, or at least I was having conversations about whether I should still work in this industry. And the pace of the rebound has been shocking. I think overall, the speed of these things has taken me by surprise as well. I guess one way of putting it is, like, I'm not surprised because I believe in bitcoin and it's cool to see other people get it.
00:05:55.278 - 00:06:26.138, Speaker B: It's like I've, for four years of my life been like, telling everyone in my life that bitcoin is like digital gold. It's the coolest asset. You want to own some. And it's cool to see like, the floodgates open like this with institutional money. But yeah, I've definitely been surprised by, like, just how fast everything has happened. It feels like, I don't know, it feels like from December of last year, just like, prices are like on an upward trajectory nonstop. And it is cool to see how much inflow the ETF's are getting.
00:06:26.138 - 00:06:49.590, Speaker B: And it's also nice to see the GBTC story, which I know you've dug into more kind of being negated. When the ETF came out, a whole bunch of people were like, oh, yeah, all that will happen is like, the GBDC people will sell some, then go into other ETF's because of fees, and then we'll be back to square zero. This was definitely not buy the rumor, sell the news event. This was actually just like bullish. People are, people want bitcoin.
00:06:49.782 - 00:07:29.186, Speaker A: It felt like a new beginning for bitcoin. And it's hard for us crypto natives to really contextualize these massive tri fi numbers because I think when three AC, which was one of the biggest funds in crypto, was around at the peak, they were allegedly $10 billion. And $10 billion is a massive amount for crypto. It's like the biggest fund in crypto and then now $10 billion, just like a drop in the bucket for tratfi. So I was talking to, actually a family office here in Singapore pretty recently, just about what their views on bitcoin is. And they basically mentioned that bitcoin is an asset that's designed for speculation. In no other asset in the world do you have something that halves its supply every four years.
00:07:29.186 - 00:08:12.380, Speaker A: So it's like almost constructing or manufacturing a bullish narrative every four years. And you have something that's not confiscatable. You have something that's really cheap, relatively, to gold to transfer around. So I never thought about it as the perfect speculative vehicle. But what this family office manager told me was basically, if you were tasked with designing the most speculative assets in the world from scratch, on paper, bitcoin is exactly the outcome. So that was quite interesting to me that people are thinking about this way and it feels like something that's a little bit boomerish, especially when we look at all these roll ups and data availability layers and so on. But to most people in the world, I think bitcoin is still quite novel.
00:08:12.380 - 00:08:24.500, Speaker A: And now that they can access it without thinking about on ramps and off ramps and just buying it through ETF's, that's actually a massive paradigm change. It's not like one of those sell the news type of events, as you mentioned.
00:08:24.572 - 00:08:52.573, Speaker B: One question I have for you is that we've always historically been in this, oh, money first flows to bitcoin, then it flows to ethereum, then it flows to alts. There's all these graphs of how to play all season that traders are always throwing around. Do you feel any worry that there's all this institutional capital that has found a way to flow into bitcoin, but it may not flow into the layers below? So it's unclear that the guy who's buying your bitcoin is also going to buy your Harry Potter sonic Obama ten Enu.
00:08:53.273 - 00:09:24.354, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely. This is a debate that I've had with my teammates almost every day as well. My contention was basically, Tradfi is comfortable with bitcoin. Now. It's taken us ten plus years, 1020 years, to really get these guys into the narrative of digital gold, an easy narrative to flip, because it is a narrative that relies on other people believing in it. It's basically like the gold delusion, but you're trying to recreate from scratch with only 20 years. So it took this long for people to really understand it, to get comfortable with it.
00:09:24.354 - 00:10:06.982, Speaker A: And I think a lot of people are focused on the deflationary aspect, or at least the capped supply aspect of bitcoin. And whenever you mention ethereum, even though at times it's deflationary now because of the fee burn, most people's perception in the mainstream is still that it's inflationary. So I think that's a big mental leap for people to go from bitcoin to ETH. And then the liquidity question as well. The TRFI numbers are so big that we always think of bitcoin as like, incredibly liquid, ethereum as incredibly liquid. And our definition of illiquidity is like a 50k type of shitcoin. But for tradfi, some of the top ten crypto assets that we consider to be the pinnacle of liquidity in this industry are very illiquid.
00:10:06.982 - 00:10:58.912, Speaker A: So it's very hard for them to go down the list, actually. And I think a huge part of this is also bitcoin seems to be like a macro asset. Now, people talk about it in terms of being an inflation hedge, in terms of being a liquidity index for the US dollar liquidity, but people talk about ethereum as if it's a tech bet. So it's two quite different crowds and two different buckets of capital. So I'm a little bit skeptical that the capital and bitcoin finds its way to ETH. So immediately, I think the changing factor, the variable, there will be an ETH ETF if you have tratfi guys starting to come out and say, actually, ETH is just like bitcoin, but it's more environmentally friendly and it's faster. Maybe you can spin some sort of an ESG angle, which is what we saw with Bill Ackman tweeting about it a few days ago, talking about how bitcoin might collapse society by consuming too much energy.
00:10:58.912 - 00:11:07.280, Speaker A: So let's buy some bitcoin. That's the kind of general view there. I'm not sure if that kind of coincides with the view that you have or you have in your circles as well.
00:11:07.352 - 00:11:41.036, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty much exactly the same. I'm very curious to see what happens with the ETTF. I've seen that it feels like people are getting more bearish on. I saw on polymarket, the price fell from like sixty cents to thirty cents, which is now my go to for scene where, where it's a pretty liquid market. There's like been a couple million dollars bet already. But yeah, I don't spend a lot of time trying to read about ETF's and stuff. And so like, I was just kind of in the bucket of people who was like, ah, bitcoin.
00:11:41.036 - 00:11:52.036, Speaker B: ETF happened. The ETF will also happen, but it feels like the market is kind of revading that. I do agree that I think it's going to be challenging for like, for this kind of liquidity to flow into other assets.
00:11:52.180 - 00:12:45.340, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I encourage our listeners to look at things like the ETH e discount as well, and also the CME open interest on ETH and kind of study the parallels between this and also what happened to bitcoin before the ETF's because that is saying something very different from the prediction markets, which I thought was interesting. But I think going back to your question about where capital flows, I think it's very interesting now that we have a lot of institutionals and maybe even retailers buying ETF's. And then on the other hand, you have someone, you have a large part of the market just flipping way to the other side of the IQ spectrum and just going straight into meme coins. So this is the second big thing that I think happened in the past quarter, which is quite recent. And some say it's still happening right now as we record this. It's the meme coin mania. So just to give some context there, I mean, meme coins reach $6 billion in total market cap.
00:12:45.340 - 00:13:14.378, Speaker A: Obviously, it's led by Doge and Shiba. Some people say it's because Shiba launched their own L2 and now people are pricing in the fundamentals. It has nothing to do with that. The entire meme coin vertical just rerated. And we have some newer names like Pepe, which is this green frog just rerating like, I think four x in a month. And then there's this dog with hat thing. And then I think recently we started to see a lot of meme coins pop up on Solana as well with these, like deliberately misspelled names of presidential candidates.
00:13:14.378 - 00:13:36.468, Speaker A: So there's like Doolin Trump and Joe Bilden. I don't know what's going on, man. I think it caught, a lot of people were surprised. I mean, meme coins have been around for a while, but this time it seems like retail's just kind of skipped all that defi nft l one nonsense and just straight went to the deepest fundamentals, which is the meme coins. What are your thoughts there?
00:13:36.636 - 00:14:20.862, Speaker B: No, it's endemic for sure. Someone I know pretty well who came from a tradfi background and always struck me as one of the, like, more tradfi esque people in crypto, has been shilling me zin z y n, which is like the nicotine supplement, which is a coin that has just been ripping for the past three weeks. Like, it can't stop going up. Nansen even wrote a thread about it. What are we doing here? I think it is crazy. On the Joe Boudin thing, I was also thinking it was so funny that there was a whole bunch of people who were shilling the Biden coin on Ethereum, like, for two weeks before that, because they were like, oh, Trump is like ten x, the market cap of Biden. This is mispriced.
00:14:20.862 - 00:14:41.534, Speaker B: And their thesis was completely right. Except, like, that it didn't work for Biden. It worked for Buddha on Solana and not Biden on Ethereum. Poor guys. I think. I guess the thing that I think most interesting here is that crypto has always been an outlet for speculation, and speculation that is bordering on gambling. Like, that has always been a thing.
00:14:41.534 - 00:15:21.674, Speaker B: And, you know, like, there are many ways to do degeneracy. When I was most interested in 2020, you could enter, like, some token that was named after food that was doing some kind of farm. You just kind of bridge to a new chain, put your money into it. Just kind of hoped for an APY. Hoped to sell. Before, like, the token crashed, there was this Omfolk season. Do you remember where, like, every chain, there was, like, an omfolk launching, and it was like, oh, who will be the first there? Like, how do I get early access? Perps have always been like, perks can obviously be used pretty responsibly, but they can also be super degenerate when you're like, 5100 x leverage.
00:15:21.674 - 00:16:00.314, Speaker B: There's this trend of people on rollbit who open along with 100 x leverage, and then they actually make a video of it and put it up on TikTok because 95% of the time they get liquidated immediately. But there's a 1% chance they make a bunch of money. And it feels like meme coins are, like, currently the gambler's instrument of choice within crypto. I've always been curious to see whether they last. It is crazy. I don't know if you've ever gone on to one of the deployments phases, but if you just go on to Dexcreener. This is people creating meme coins nonstop for every thing under the sun.
00:16:00.314 - 00:16:16.178, Speaker B: To me, it just feels like lottery tickets. And I'm, like, happy for people to play lottery ticket games that are positive ev, but I can't really tell whether it's like a lasting paradigm or whether this gambling energy will go somewhere else. I don't know. What's your experience been?
00:16:16.306 - 00:16:54.462, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you make a great point about the food coins because just for our listeners who are not aware, so this is back in, what, 2020 during the so called Defi summer. There's a lot of Defi protocols that were being spun up every single day, and they were themed after food. So there's, like, ramen finance, which had a Dex and also a lending protocol, and you could stake your tokens and farm it. So they would give you a lot of incentives early on to bootstrap it. But if you strip away all of that, it's really the same thing. Sure, some of these teams might have stuck around and actually built up products like sushi, but most of these, come on, most of them were not going to ship anything anyway. And these were just memes.
00:16:54.462 - 00:17:32.248, Speaker A: And I think there's a really recent and interesting thread read by Travis Kling from Ikigai Capital, where he titled his thesis for 2024 as financial nihilism, which is this idea that people just drop all pretense of any of this thing mattering at all, and people just kind of swinging way to the other side and saying that actually nothing matters. None of this is any meaning. Value is completely subjective. Screw fundamentals, screw cash flow, screw products, screw revenue. We're just going to bet on memes. So this time around, I kind of see these meme coins as the same thing as those food themed defi coins, but without the defi aspect. They're not even pretending anymore.
00:17:32.248 - 00:17:54.046, Speaker A: They're not even saying that we're going to build a Dex. No Dex this time. Just straight up a coin misspelled name of Joe Biden. Just go buy it or go away. So that's kind of what's happening. Part of me, I do understand where some of the kind of ivory tower people on Twitter are saying, oh, this is all speculation, we shouldn't touch this. Meme cards are bad for this space.
00:17:54.046 - 00:18:21.250, Speaker A: But on the other side, right. I think a lot of people are looking into crypto for the first time because of these kind of meme coins, because it's fun. You know, people are not. I don't think any rational adult would put in their entire net worth into, you know, zincoin or like Nick coin. But these guys are maybe chucking in like a $100, right, just to, just to see how it goes. And if it goes up, it piques their interest and they come into crypto, and they also usually have to use Dexus to buy these things. So for a lot of people, it's the first time they're interacting with Defi.
00:18:21.250 - 00:18:35.602, Speaker A: So in a way, it's like an interesting little top of funnel user acquisition tool for all of crypto. So who am I to say that this is like lower brow than some of the defi coins that just completely rucked?
00:18:35.738 - 00:19:12.806, Speaker B: Is there anything interesting to invest in from a venture perspective, you think here? I mean, telegram bots are the one, quote unquote tooling in this sector that you can expect that meme coins continue to grow. Telegram bots continue to grow because they're just like the primary interface. It works really well for them because they get to charge really high fees. Meme coin buyers don't care about fees because you're buying a lottery ticket, basically. And the sniping dynamic is pretty important to telegram bots. But outside of that, have you seen, let's say, you're excited about meme coins for the next three years. Other than aping your net worth into Joe Boudin, what else can one do?
00:19:12.990 - 00:19:47.464, Speaker A: Yeah, I think if you study the price history of meme coins, they rarely trend up into the right. It's not like an asset you can hold comfortably. The price performance is usually like a year of just like no movement, and then suddenly you have one month where it like five x, and then it collapses back to zero and then it just flat for you. No other assets in crypto trade like this except for scams. So it's a little bit hard to invest from a venture perspective. And I feel like for meme coins, you can't really 100 iq it. What I mean is, if you try to find something that's like half a meme coin, but they're trying to build products and add utility, it's going to underperform the thing that's like no pretense at all.
00:19:47.464 - 00:20:17.644, Speaker A: But you also feel a little bit less secure for holding one of those assets. So it's not something that we can really do like pure, pure meme coins. We invested in meme land, but it's not a pure, pure meme coin. I'm actually interviewing the founder later today as well. But in terms of pure, pure meme coins, I've had offers for some influencer deals where it's like 50% discount and then three month unlock just designed to just allow me to dump. So obviously I say no to all of those things. But yeah, I don't think that's kind of my arena here.
00:20:17.644 - 00:21:03.672, Speaker A: But yeah, I think in terms of tooling, one very, very auxiliary event is probably just like uniswap. People always just spinning up meme coin pools in uniswap or even Jupiter on Solana. Which actually brings us to our third point of the third biggest thing that happened, which is this massive, massive Jupiter airdrop on Solana. So to give our listeners some context there, Jupiter is a Dex aggregator on Solana. So it's kind of like one inch on Ethereum, and they did an airdrop for people on Solana, for users, for Solana. Now, why this airdrop was interesting and why it was so notable was because it was $700 million notional value at the time of the drop. So one of the biggest airdrops ever, one of the biggest token airdrops ever on Solana.
00:21:03.672 - 00:21:40.236, Speaker A: And even today, I think people, some of the people are still posting screenshots of how much they got airdropped. And we see the stories of like five, six figure airdrops, which is insane if you think about it. Just using a product pays you, like, an annual salary for, like, an average silicon Valley worker. So this was a pretty massive, massive event, and I think it prompted a lot of discussion around airdrops as well. And just to give a little bit of context as well, today, Jupiter, I think, trades about $1 billion in daily volume. One inch, on the other hand, trades about $42 million in daily volume. So there's a little bit of a chick in the neck.
00:21:40.236 - 00:21:55.692, Speaker A: You're not sure if people are using Jupyter. And they stuck on Jupiter because of this loyalty that was created by this airdrop incentive. But clearly the product is working and people are happy there. What did you think when you first saw this get a massive, massive airdrop? Did you get any of this airdrop?
00:21:55.748 - 00:22:32.830, Speaker B: Unfortunately, I did not. I just don't spend enough time on chain on Solana, which is a failure mode of mine. I think it's very cool. I think, like, as we've discussed before, airdrops have, like, a really good, feel good factor associated with them, particularly for those who get rich via an airdrop. They actually remain somewhat loyal. And there is kind of a great money flow that happens where you basically, I mean, it's not actually out of thin air, but whatever you kind of produce money out of thin air for a bunch of retail participants. They sell and then start putting it into other parts of the ecosystem.
00:22:32.830 - 00:23:07.420, Speaker B: So it's nice to see Solana liquidity flow. I mean, overall, I think it's just been emblematic of how amazing the Solana story has been. Like, Solana has clearly had an amazing renaissance. There's a whole bunch of builders who stuck with it, there's a whole bunch of users who stuck with it, and they're being rewarded. One other aspect of this that I think is underrated is like, the Jupiter founder is insane at founder marketing. And it's also kind of emblematic of how this stuff is changing. I don't know if you've ever seen, but he's just like, on, particularly before the token launch, I only saw a couple of hours of this, but he's just on stream all the time.
00:23:07.420 - 00:23:42.312, Speaker B: He's like, on stream talking about Jupyter, talking about the token launch, talking about life, chatting with all his streamers. It's actually a delight to see in some ways, and so it's just cool to see. Also, I think people underestimate how founders can actually get really close to their communities, particularly for kind of Degen products. I think it works really well. And so meow is like a great streamer and his streams are very widely viewed by Jupyter people. And actually he walked through the dynamics of the token launch very carefully on stream and stuff. But yeah, I think it's just a.
00:23:42.328 - 00:23:42.884, Speaker A: Sign.
00:23:44.824 - 00:24:21.184, Speaker B: He seems like building, talking. I don't think he streams himself trading, but I should check that. But yeah, I think it's just like, emblematic of, like, the Solana story is amazing because I think it's just very clear that, like, it's the block. Like, if you're not hanging out in the ethereum roll up ecosystem, the obvious choice to build is Solan. Like, I think it's like. And it has so many competitors in this kind of alt l one space. Like, remember how last cycle, everything was about Solar Soluna evacs? That was the trade.
00:24:21.184 - 00:24:48.944, Speaker B: It's been a minute since then, but yeah. So I think it's just cool to see that Solana has, like, emerged from a very tough period. And a lot of the reasons that Solana pitched itself as an interesting technical platform are actually the reasons it's succeeding. Like, people do want to trade meme coins and do all this defi leverage stuff and want to do it with super low fees, and Solana gives you a place to do that.
00:24:49.284 - 00:25:33.348, Speaker A: We're probably two of the very, very fortunate people to have seen his entire Solana journey quite early on. I remember back at our previous employer at Spartan, we're advising Solana back in 2018, 2019, and Kelvin, our boss at that time, tweeted about it recently as well, about how they were advising Solana race during one of the craziest times. And then, so I got to see kind of Solana start from a complete startup. Actually, the first time I saw them was even before Spartan. I was traveling to San Francisco in 2018 for a crypto event, and I couldn't afford a ticket at that time. So my good friend Bonnie from 500 startups actually flew me out there. And then I went to a panel and Solana was one of the speakers.
00:25:33.348 - 00:25:49.584, Speaker A: Nier was another. There was Oasis as well. But back then, Solana was just a startup. They just raised their first seed round. And then now we see this as, like, the pinnacle of how you bootstrap the l one, which is really, really crazy to me. So it's still one of my bigger bets. Personally, I think it is the.
00:25:49.584 - 00:26:33.324, Speaker A: It's kind of cemented itself as the onboarding funnel for retails this cycle. And you can see by just the sheer volume of meme coins that are happening on Solana. And my info thesis has always been incredibly simple, which is, like, I think users, over time, want cheaper and faster. It makes no sense for me to think that users want to go the other way, which was why I was so hesitant to kind of submit to the BRC narrative, because it was going slower and, you know, and more expensive. But I do see, you know, a market niche for that. But, yeah. So, Solana, I think, checks all the buckets, I think, in terms of, like, the implications for other l ones, do you think people should just stop building l ones? Like, is this pretty much over Solana cemented, or are there any avenues for other l ones to maybe craft out a market for them themselves?
00:26:33.444 - 00:26:58.180, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the first answer to this question is, like, we have lots of l one s that aren't widely used, that trade at multi billion dollar valuations now. They aren't fully unlocked. There's lots of stuff. But even oasis, like, probably was a pretty decent financial return for its investors and founders, even though, like, no one uses oasis anymore. I don't know what. I don't know what rose trades are. Okay.
00:26:58.180 - 00:27:02.676, Speaker B: Rose trades at 1.7 billion, and it's almost fully unlocked.
00:27:02.700 - 00:27:02.836, Speaker A: Right.
00:27:02.860 - 00:27:37.946, Speaker B: So I think the answer to whether you should build an l one is that, like, if your failure mode is Rose, like, yeah, you should build an l one. You will get rich. Like, I. It's funny how many. It was funny how many times I've spoken to people and been like, the way to get rich in crypto is to start an l one. It remains shockingly true for some reason. And so I think it's like, yes, from a product perspective, I think Solana does occupy a very serious place, and it's going to be very hard to compete.
00:27:37.946 - 00:28:10.274, Speaker B: And so Sui and Aptos are examples of chains that were truly launched to basically compete for the marginal dev who would build on Solana. They're fast, they're parallel, they're low cost, they use a new programming language. Those devs are like, those users are not going to sue in Aptos. They're very much going to Solana, at least for the time being. And so I think from a perspective of what do we need and what's interesting. Yeah, you should build an app on a roll up or on Solana. That's what you should build.
00:28:10.274 - 00:28:46.570, Speaker B: But also, I can't in good conscience say, you shouldn't launch another l one if you want to get rich. It just is like, we love funding these things. Dragonfly is continuing to invest in them. We broadly do still think there is infra to be built here, and it can get faster and cheaper and it can get to a point where we can basically, like, accommodate crazy levels of scale. But, yeah, I don't know. I think, like, the question of whether people will build on your l one and whether you'll get rich building an l one are, like, so far apart these days that it's just, like, hard to answer you with a straight face.
00:28:46.762 - 00:28:47.178, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:28:47.186 - 00:28:58.514, Speaker B: How do you feel about the l one kind of landscape right now? There are lots of l ones raising today. Like, it hasn't stopped. And there are lots of funds funding them today. Like, there's no reason to believe that it'll stop.
00:28:58.854 - 00:29:16.870, Speaker A: I think as long as the valuation floor is higher for l ones than apps, that will continue. I was hoping that actually Axie would be the inflection point. Right. Axie was the first app in crypto to be multi billion dollars, and, you know, it had the numbers to support it. And, you know, this cycle round, objectively, we do have more application layer things.
00:29:16.982 - 00:29:30.034, Speaker B: That are actually launched in l one, though. Like, that's what they decided. I feel like that's the other thing that happens when everyone in crypto, once they reach a certain scale, launch an l one. What else is there to do?
00:29:30.334 - 00:30:11.926, Speaker A: They just verticalize and start their own l one s. Yeah, that is a good point. I think that will continue to happen as long as the market thinks fat protocols is still a thing, which it seems like it is. It just allows you to dream a bigger dream if it's infra layer versus application layer. So that is a challenge in terms of opportunity for founders. Personally, I feel like there's a lot of founders that are trying to do a lot of low level optimizations and make change faster, marginally faster. I think unless you can create a ten x type of performance, trying to create a 20% faster Solana probably isn't worth it in terms of offering other languages, obviously, Aptos and Sui, the big sell back in the day was like, move language is gonna be huge.
00:30:11.926 - 00:30:52.666, Speaker A: I think that might be worth exploring if you're creating kind of ability for developers to build with other languages that are bigger than solidity. But at the same time, I feel like maybe transpilers can kind of tackle that market if you have a move transpiler down to EVM. So for me, personally, I'm still very excited about EVM, just because it's had the most Lindy in crypto thus far, and it has the biggest community in crypto thus far. So if you can create a really, really fast kind of Solana performance thing for EVM, I think that's a huge, huge market. I'm willing to place multiple bets there. The one that we did was say, unfortunately we missed on Monad, and there's a few others that we're looking at right now. I think that's a pretty big market opportunity.
00:30:52.666 - 00:31:39.876, Speaker A: So, speaking of infra, the other big, big thing that happened is obviously eigen layer, which you mentioned. Everybody's talking about it. Ethan there specifically, I think a 16 z put in $100 million in cash into Eigen Lair before their launch, which is probably the biggest venture check at, technically pre product that I've seen in crypto this year. And obviously, the Eigen layer kind of pre launch, they already have this point system that allows people to put in Ethereum to get some points and maybe get an airdrop later on. And that has reached $12 billion before the main function is even live. So obviously, it's like an insane, insanely big paradigm shift. I think a lot of people are saying this is the most exciting development since Ethereum.
00:31:39.876 - 00:32:01.382, Speaker A: Specifically, I think Olaf from Polychain went on a podcast recently. I'm not going to say which one, because they're competing with us, but he mentioned that this is the biggest thing since ethereum, which is a big, big claim to make. I know you have a lot of thoughts in Eigen layer. We talked about this a lot as well. But what is the hype for people who are just hearing about Eigen layer for the first time? Why are people so excited about this thing?
00:32:01.508 - 00:32:44.972, Speaker B: I think for the first time it is an actually interesting novel new primitive. Like, we don't see a lot of those. And it's one that actually, I don't know, makes a lot of sense from first principles. It's basically this idea that, look, Ethereum is very valuable, which means that Ethereum's proof of stake, security and valid data set are also very valuable. Ethereum is like the gold outside of bitcoin. Ethereum is probably the gold standard for secure compute. And I think the key insight of Eigen layer was that the only way currently to leverage Ethereum's trust is to build a smart contract on Ethereum, or maybe a roll up.
00:32:44.972 - 00:33:36.934, Speaker B: And there are lots of things that people want to build that cannot fit into a smart contract on Ethereum, but would still benefit immensely from leveraging Ethereum's validator set and Ethereum's trust and Ethereum's security as a proof of stake asset. And Eigen layer essentially allows you to use Ethereum to secure your new blockchain network or new blockchain application that may or may not be a smart contract. So I think that's kind of from first principle. It's a really interesting idea, and I've always been hugely excited by Eigen layer. I guess one point on the hype right now is that it feels like it's kind of, and crypto narratives that get hot always do this. It's just kind of gone into la la land, for lack of a better word. Like, people are just insanely high, people are pouring money into this contract, people are just farming a massive eigenveyor airdrop.
00:33:36.934 - 00:34:18.874, Speaker B: And if you think about like Eigenveil, the product sells security effectively. I think what's really important is making sure is paying attention to Eigen layer's AV's ecosystem. AV's just refers to a startup that's basically buying security from Eigen layer. And I think that's also been super impressive. So at each of these conferences, they've kind of announced new partners who are building on Eigen layer and increasingly like a statement that doesn't make a lot of sense. But I spoke to a VC at Ethanworld and I asked them like, oh, what's interesting to you these days? And they said, oh, we're looking at investing in avss. And I was like, what does that even mean? Like, AVss are like sequencers and oracles than anything infra related.
00:34:18.874 - 00:35:04.684, Speaker B: But I think the key for Eigen layer, outside of just getting token hype and TVL into the contract, is really finding people to sell the security to. And I think they have done a great job there. For a prelaunch product, they already have a list of great customers. People like espresso systems, people like Nier, people like wormhole, people like ritual, all of whom have kind of agreed to buy security from Eigen layer. And that's a crazy customer list for a pre product. I think as long as they continue to find customers who want to buy this security, who want to buy Ethereum security through Eigen layer, the hype plays out correctly. If that stalls, then I think there may be a little bit of a struggle.
00:35:04.684 - 00:35:13.264, Speaker B: But I think that's where I'm paying the most attention to understand. Are there actually a lot of customers for what Eigen layer is selling? And the answer, at least till now, seems like, yeah, there are quite a few, actually.
00:35:14.384 - 00:35:56.782, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is the best BG I've ever seen. I don't know if that's because they hired Calvin Liu, who used to be with compound. I think when they announced that they hired Calvin, people were very, very excited because they saw the success with compound. So shout out to Calvin Nieuw for probably helming a lot of those initiatives that you mentioned. I think with the market, that's probably finding ways to speculate on agglayer before the token launch with whales market, we talked about the points there, implying some crazy valuation. But I won't be surprised to see Eigen layer just being like a top 20 coin when it launches. And there's already multiple companies raising venture money to build defi primitives on top.
00:35:56.782 - 00:36:34.616, Speaker A: This idea of liquid restaking tokens that allows people to have liquid representations of restaked ETH that uses Eigen layer. So I can name like Renzo, I think puffer Etherfi just got announced for binance launch pool Rio, which is a portal of ours, and blockchain capital. They're all either in market or coming to market soon. So I've never seen a single ecosystem with this much venture money poured into companies building on top of it before its launch. Even for Solana, this really only happened after FTX enshrined them as the serum chain. So it's very crazy to me. And obviously with this, a lot of people are talking about systemic risks as well.
00:36:34.616 - 00:37:02.094, Speaker A: We're not going to tackle them. In this episode, I recorded a full interview with Sriram, the founder of Eigen Layer, talking exactly about the systemic risks. He's very open to talk about all of this, so feel free to check that one out. But speaking of systemic risks, this leads us to our next big topic, which is Athena. So Athena just became, in Q one, the biggest revenue driving application in all of crypto. Right. So they just talked to revenue charts.
00:37:02.094 - 00:37:29.296, Speaker A: If you plot just the fees made in the past month for every single application in crypto, excluding centralized exchanges, the biggest one is, I think, ethereum. The second one is Tron. The third one is Athena. So it's become the top app in Defi already. So this is obviously a big, big deal. And I think a lot of discussion on Twitter has been around whether Athena has crazy systemic risks, which we've talked a little bit about before as well. So let's touch on that a little bit.
00:37:29.296 - 00:37:48.640, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on. Well, first of all, actually, even before that, when I tweeted out that Athena is now the highest fee generating dap, I think a lot of people took offense at the fact that I called it a Dap, where D stands for decentralized. So what are your thoughts on this? First of all, does it qualify as a Dap for you?
00:37:48.712 - 00:38:18.220, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I don't know. I mean, it just feels like the most nitpicky thing, like someone has built something that people really want. The only way it scales is by doing some part of the trading off chain. And thats just like the nature of liquidity right now. I think Dragonfly is obviously an investor in Athena, but were also just investors in things that people want. And I think worrying too much about is this decentralized, centralized is not worth it.
00:38:18.220 - 00:38:47.290, Speaker B: I think theyre very upfront about the risks of centralized custody, and theyve thought through them super intelligently. They use partners like copper, and they make it all transparent. That's all you can really ask for. I think there isn't a version of Athena that's entirely on chain because that was tried and it failed because there isn't on chain per liquidity. So the question of whether it's a DAP or not is kind of irrelevant. It's like, okay, we want to build a tokenized basis trade stablecoin, and the only way to build it is by tapping into off chain liquidity. And they've done it correctly.
00:38:47.290 - 00:38:47.974, Speaker B: I think.
00:38:48.274 - 00:39:31.584, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the trade off, the correct way to think about the trade off is if you are comfortable custodying some of your assets on some of the biggest centralized exchanges. If you have funds on Binance, Oke, expybit, and so on, you are probably comfortable with the risk that you take on Athena, assuming you also do liquid staking on Lido, because it's pretty much the same risk, you're exposed to the same counterparties. So it's not as decentralized as something like, I don't know, like a fracs, but I think decentralization is a spectrum. Right. So they are not centralized in the sense that they're decentralized across multiple parties. It's not like all of your funds are custodied on Binance. In fact, none of it is custody on centralized exchanges, and it's split across multiple counterparties here.
00:39:31.584 - 00:39:47.612, Speaker A: That's kind of my thought there. I know you wanted to touch on the end game situation on Maker as well, because I think the founder of Athena guy talked about how complimentary Athena actually is to maker. Do you want to explain that thought a little bit?
00:39:47.668 - 00:41:07.414, Speaker B: Yeah, I just thought it was very cool that for a product that's so new, Athena actually recently got a shout out on Roon, who is the founder of maker often writes kind of these end game plans that are just like a broad overview of what's happening at Maker and where he wants to take it. And in this plan that I think was published like, two, three days ago, he actually says that one of the key sources for one of the sources of yield that he's most excited about for Maker is actually perpetual swap yields that they can tap into using mechanisms such as Athena's susce. So it's kind of crazy that, like Roon basically said, this, like, fits very well into our plans considering Athena just launched. And I think it's a sign that, again, like, people want the product that Athena is building. And there are some, like, valid concerns that the team has thought through very carefully. But I think that's the most important thing. Like, you can see by the kind of almost parabolic increase in TVL, by the mentions on your timeline, by how angry it makes some people, by the fact that, like, the biggest defi institutions like maker are taking Athena very seriously and seeing why perpetual swap basis yield is effectively like, an important source of yield in this market and deserves to be treated with seriousness.
00:41:07.414 - 00:41:10.138, Speaker B: It's a cool sign. I don't know.
00:41:10.266 - 00:41:49.538, Speaker A: I think a really telltale sign of just, like, hype around a product is the emergence of scams. I think there's a huge ton of just fake Athena Twitter handles. So if you're listening or watching this, be careful. I think as of this week, March 13, when we're recording this, everything you see on Twitter related to a token airdrop right now is a scam. It's fake, so only follow the official kind of Twitter account there. But yeah, I think this was one of the most exciting investments we've done as well, and I'm glad we did this together. Speaking of investments we did, let's look at investments we didn't do as well because I don't think either of us were very deep into the BRC train until quite recently.
00:41:49.538 - 00:42:26.280, Speaker A: We started looking into it just to give some context here. This year, this quarter specifically, there is a massive growth in ordinals and BRC 20 tokens on bitcoin, which started in November of last year. I think the first wave of this came in June when people started doing bitcoin's version of nfts, which are inscriptions. So for bitcoin, there's no smart contract. So you can't really create nfts, but you can inscribe details into the Utxo and bitcoin itself, which create kind of Nft like assets which people started trading. So that was, you know, a fad for like a month, and then in November it came back with a vengeance. So now it's like a whole ecosystem.
00:42:26.280 - 00:42:54.974, Speaker A: Now, I think someone mentioned to me there's like 64 Bitcoin l two s that are launching this year, and there's probably hundreds that are raising right now. You mentioned on our BRC episode with Katrina, which listeners can check out as well, that there's something called Merlin chain that nobody even knows about, but they hit like a billion dollars in TVL, but the west is completely blind to it, which is insane to me. So are you excited about this vertical at all? Like, in terms of, like, the dozens of l two s, how many of these have you aped into already?
00:42:55.094 - 00:43:16.646, Speaker B: I have aped into none. So it is kind of crazy. Like, Merlin does have more than a billion dollars in real TVL. If you look at the. So I dug into the Merlin figure a little bit. Some part of the TVL is composed of BRC 420s, which don't feel like a real thing. I don't know.
00:43:16.646 - 00:44:00.314, Speaker B: I'm definitely not an expert, so I won't chat too much here. I think what I'm sensing is that people want a place to play money games with. Bitcoin ordinals are doing exceptionally well. People are excited about this ecosystem. A lot of retail participants I know in the market are basically spending a lot of time trading ordinals, minting ordinals. I do think bitcoin was not designed for tech innovation, and so there's a bunch of teams doing that, and I wish them well and I hope it works out. But that's not something I'm hugely excited by right now, because it feels like you're trying to shoehorn proofs and verification, or DA, into bitcoin, and it just wasn't built to do that.
00:44:00.314 - 00:44:59.900, Speaker B: I do think it's pretty likely that there will be a roll up that basically, I'll put air quotes around roll up. There'll be a chain of some kind that allows you to easily bridge bitcoin over, and they gain a bunch of TVL and they play the L1 L two playbook really well of getting the right influencers, getting the right people to build apps, making sure there's like a robust ecosystem without getting too worried about security or technical considerations. And this chain will do a massive airdrop, the kind that has never been seen by bitcoin holders before. And that will be pretty game changing. So I think once bitcoin people are like, get an airdrop and realize they can play in l two s, they will probably be excited. I'm not hugely excited by the sector, because it just doesn't feel like bitcoin was built to do programmability. But I think startups like Babylon, some of these bitcoin l two s may be more successful.
00:44:59.900 - 00:45:29.174, Speaker B: The truth is, I'm also like, this is definitely a failure mode of mine where in my head I'm just thinking about Ethereum all day. And so I always struggle with bitcoin. Really feels like, what are you guys talking about? What do you mean by ZK roll ups on bitcoin, where we have like the cutting edge happening on Ethereum. So I think that's where I'd land on them. I don't know. How excited are you? Are you getting more excited or less excited over the past few weeks as the market is definitely getting more excited?
00:45:29.554 - 00:45:49.946, Speaker A: Yeah, I definitely am getting more open minded. I was very much in the same camera. I always thought, okay, bitcoin's entire value proposition is immutability. We don't want to build things on it. We don't want to fuck with bitcoin in any way. And all of the degeneracy or the crazy shit should happen in in other l one s. But then I also realized that there was actually a massive especially in Asia, the early kind of chinese mining whales.
00:45:49.946 - 00:46:41.058, Speaker A: And these guys are sitting on billions of dollars of liquid bitcoin. I think one of the founders I spoke to, I asked them, okay, what is your go to market distribution strategy? How do you get your first hundred million dollars worth of bitcoin into this protocol? And they're like, oh, yeah, I know a guy who literally has, like, a billion dollars in bitcoin just sitting on binance, and he showed me a screenshot and I was just blown away. And I know these whales exist. We've talked to some of them back when we were working at Spartan, but it's just crazy to me that they are so different from your average crypto native and what they're looking for for trade offs. I think there's different tiers. So if they are very comfortable with centralized custodians, they probably hold some wrapped bitcoin on Ethereum and earning yield on some deFi protocol if they're less comfortable with that. But they're more comfortable if, like, they're still okay with, like, l two security, they might use some of these l two s, especially if there's, like, defi protocols on them.
00:46:41.058 - 00:47:20.764, Speaker A: Now, if they're not comfortable with that, then there are teams that are trying to build kind of vms natively on the bitcoin layer, one layer, using verifications or using validity proofs or fraud proofs. So I do think that there is, like, a tier of product for every type of whale that has a different type of trust trade off that they're comfortable with. I don't know where that is. Maybe most whales are just okay with putting it on binance, and they would just all use, you know, wrap BTC and use it in Defi. Or maybe there's actually a large contingent of whales that are like, no, I don't want to touch any l two s. My bitcoin is precious to me. I don't want to trust centralized custodians.
00:47:20.764 - 00:48:03.724, Speaker A: I only want to use, you know, native l one kind of vms, which I think might be, you know, a market opportunity here. So I'm willing to make bets there. But as you say, I think this kind of. Even though we're based in the east, I think this has kind of caught me by a surprise a little bit, just because of my initial bias against using bitcoin for development. But this is something that was, I think, one of the most significant things to happen to bitcoin as well, just because there's historically not been much happening on bitcoin. Other than price go up and maybe some stuff around taproot. So I think for the purpose of time, this is the last one that we should touch on, is the uniswap fee switch.
00:48:03.724 - 00:48:40.998, Speaker A: So just to give our listeners context. So Uniswap is obviously one of the most profitable applications in crypto. It's the go to Dex on Ethereum. And they issued this kind of governance token years ago, this massive airdrop, actually back in 2020, but the token never really had any use case. It's actually just a meme coin. You can use it to govern the protocol. But all the fees that Uniswap was earning did not accrue to the tokens until, I believe, two weeks ago, someone put out a proposal to turn on the fee switch for Uniswap, which accrues some of the revenues earned by this massive Dex to token holders.
00:48:40.998 - 00:49:04.020, Speaker A: So that was one of the biggest things that people were praying for during Defi summer, that we're going to turn these tokens into revenue accruing tokens, but, you know, potentially also exposing them to security risk. Security as in, you know, them being classified as securities and regulated, not the security as in safety. So what are your initial thoughts there? Do you think this vote will go through?
00:49:04.212 - 00:49:59.674, Speaker B: So I think it'll take a bit for fees actually to get collected. My understanding of what happened right now is that the fee switch proposal passed, but then the actual proposal that would upgrade the contracts failed because there were a bunch of valid concerns about smart contract security and kind of bugs that may arise through this process. It's pretty convoluted, I think, more than anything else. Like I start by saying in the vein of, like a sharp person told me recently, tokens are just content and they compete for attention. So I think it was nice that, like, defi had attention for a week, and in that week, everyone noticed, hey, these coins are really cheap and double the price of every single one of them. Admittedly, you're right, it was through a very bullish period. But I guess, look, I'm a huge fan of the large DeFi protocols that are working and continue to do great things.
00:49:59.674 - 00:50:33.470, Speaker B: So I'm a huge Aave Stan. I think they kind of aave three actually pushed the needle forward. They're building cool products, they continue to chug along, they've turned into cash flow generating businesses. And I really like the end state for the largest DeFi primitives. Having said that, they continue to be pretty boring investments. They feel like stable coins, they never outperform ETH and I don't know that that will change. So I guess I was looking more from just like, I was excited that people were paying attention to Defi tokens again.
00:50:33.470 - 00:51:07.156, Speaker B: I think the truth is, it's funny because the rest of Defi rewated, but Maker already does buy back and burn. They do that already. I believe Aave also has some mechanism for staking and a fee return. So it's really just uniswap that has struggled with this. I think eventually Uniswap does turn on fees, and I think that's hugely bullish for token holders. But I think also it's nice that people are like. It's nice that DeFi coins got like a week of people paying attention to them, because I do feel like they're just kind of.
00:51:07.156 - 00:51:26.386, Speaker B: Like, they're just kind of there. No one talks about them. They work, they have teams. They're really great companies in some ways that have kind of lasted through multiple bull and bear markets. So it's nice to see. I don't know, how did you feel about, like, this uniswap free switch debate?
00:51:26.490 - 00:51:50.540, Speaker A: Yeah, I basically saw it, and I fully expected this re rating because I know nobody holds Defi tokens anymore. No funds, no retails. Nobody cares about DeFi tokens. They used the Defi protocols, but nobody owns the token. So everything went up as expected there. But in terms of long term implications, I'm still mostly drawn to the novel stuff. I haven't seen a zero to one moment in DeFi in a long time besides Athena.
00:51:50.540 - 00:52:13.820, Speaker A: So hopefully Athena or these LRT's, these liquids restaking tokens start to reignite some interest in defi. We start to create some weird and interesting shit again. Hopefully we don't blow anything up this time. But yeah. So this was one of the more kind of bittersweet moments. I think we've been waiting for this fee switch since we were both back at Spartan. So that years ago, but yeah, they finally made it happen.
00:52:13.820 - 00:52:35.780, Speaker A: But yeah. So there you have it, folks. The five or six biggest things that happened in Q. One, if you were living under a rock, or if you just came back to crypto, make sure you send this episode to any friends who are trying to get back into crypto again. Hopefully this was a helpful recap. And if you want to reach out to either of us, both of us are on Twitter, so we're going to include our handles in the show notes below. But yeah, thanks for taking your time, Sarat.
00:52:35.780 - 00:52:37.388, Speaker A: I'll see you on the next roundtable, man.
00:52:37.476 - 00:52:38.036, Speaker B: Thank you.
