Views held by Blockcrunch's guests are their own, and sponsorship messages do not constitute financial advice or endorsement. With that out of the way, let's jump right in. Now, before we get started with today's episode, I've got some great news for you.
00:00:42.744 - 00:01:26.180, Speaker C: Now, a lot of you have been asking for how I analyze projects that I bring on the show. That's why I decided to create blockchain VIP to share with you all the heavy research that goes on behind the scenes. Now, every week or so, our team prepares an in depth research memo with things like sector analysis, technical concepts made simple, in depth competitor breakdown, and even interactive models so you can learn about the most important projects before they become important. And our team is putting in hours every week, scouring discord, twitter, forums and blogs to help you get an edge in crypto and understand the latest projects and themes at the deepest levels. That goes way beyond just an interview. Now, in addition, we'll also host exclusive AMA's with myself to answer any of your questions. So all of these are only available to blockchain's VIP subscribers.
00:01:26.180 - 00:01:38.144, Speaker C: And the good news is that while our interviews will always be free, the vip tier costs less than one coffee a day. So head on over to theblockcrunch.com VIP or click the link in the show notes below to sign up.
00:01:40.124 - 00:02:13.960, Speaker A: Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now I'm finally back in the home studio, so the audio should be a lot better than all the episodes that came anytime in the past four or five months. I'm really excited for that. But another thing I'm really excited for is our guest today. So just to give you a little bit of context, this is another episode in our series of Tangent Fireside chats. So for those of you who are not familiar, Tangent is a collective of experienced operators and founders in crypto, investing our own capital and time into other founders in web3. So our principles are high conviction and high touch.
00:02:13.960 - 00:02:58.536, Speaker A: And that's why it's very important for us to have people involved who have walked the walk investing alongside us to lend their experience to founders way back. So today, as part of the Tangent fireside chat. I'm grateful to have with us one of Tangent's angel mentors, Gabby Dizon. And for those of you who don't know, Gabby is the co founder of Yield Guild Games, the largest web3 gaming guild that's backed by a 16 z. Now, Gabby has also spent 18 years in the gaming industry and was one of the very first people I know who foresaw the success of games like Axie Infinity. And last year Gabby was named one of 50 leaders in the NFT space by Fortune magazine as well. So I'm extremely grateful to have Gabby on again, this time to talk about where he sees the gaming space headed in web3, the current challenges with PTE games and guilds.
00:02:58.536 - 00:03:06.404, Speaker A: And towards the end we'll talk about projects that Gabby is maybe excited by. So make sure to stay till the end. So without further ado, welcome, Gabby.
00:03:06.824 - 00:03:09.684, Speaker D: Thanks again for having me, Jason. Second time around?
00:03:10.084 - 00:03:20.744, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Now, this has been a really long year and a lot of things that happened in crypto and in gaming as well. So I guess just to kick us off in general, what have you been most busy with this past year? Man?
00:03:21.244 - 00:03:53.004, Speaker D: So right now, trying to really understand and figure out where the space is going right now with where the market is, things have slowed down a bit, which I think is good. So we're trying to figure out how to really kind of understand where the world is going. I still have 100% conviction in the future of web3 gaming, trying to see who are the participants, who's making games, who's making tools around it and. Yeah, figuring out Yug's strategy and its place in the world.
00:03:53.744 - 00:04:24.164, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'm sure we're going to dig into a lot of that because as you mentioned, this year is a pretty crazy year for crypto markets. Everything is down, and especially for PTE games. I feel like we went through a little bit of an existential moment with play to earn games because the players have kind of, obviously the numbers have fallen down a lot. So I'm curious where you think this model of paying gamers tokens to play games is going. Is that basically proven to be unsustainable and is that still going to be a thing in the next cycle?
00:04:24.544 - 00:05:19.234, Speaker D: Yeah, so I think what's happening right now is largely a game design challenge. So a lot of games copy the Axie model, the two token economy, one inflationary token, and the governance token that's used as a representative of the treasury. Right. And think of SLP, the in game, inflationary token, as a in game commodity, basically inside its economy, where people can earn that by winning games and you can use it to breed more axies, but since it's also tokenized, you can trade it with each other. And what happened last year was that because of the rise of axie, there was a lot of demand from traders on the exchange side. And I think by definition, there is going to be a lot more liquidity on the exchange side than you are in your game economy. So when the market started going down, the price of SLP went along with it.
00:05:19.234 - 00:06:13.704, Speaker D: And because the game couldn't react quickly enough to the changes outside, then the demand really fell. So I think games are learning their lessons from this and are adapting their tokenomics so that it can avoid the same pitfalls. For example, I see a lot of games pivot towards more soft currencies, basically in game currencies, so that they can have better control of the economy. So tokenizing these resources inside the game, whether they're nfts or fungible tokens, means that the players own them and you're giving them permission to sell or to reinvest in the economy. And when players choose to sell, then you, like, there's nothing you can do about it. So the design is really being iterated on. And I've seen a lot of games come up with different mechanics so that they can have better control of what goes inside or outside their in game economy.
00:06:14.444 - 00:06:18.136, Speaker A: And you mentioned this idea of soft currencies. Can you kind of explain what that is?
00:06:18.300 - 00:06:53.954, Speaker D: Sure. So soft currencies are what you see in current games currencies, whether it's gold or gems that you earn inside the game. So inflationary currencies are hard to map to real world value because it's inflationary by design. Right. And it's something you earn as kind of a mark of progress while grinding in a game. And we've found that paying for grinding itself is not sustainable. What you want is the player doing things of value inside the game, basically, before you give them assets of value as well.
00:06:53.954 - 00:07:00.734, Speaker D: So games are trying to delay the point when players are able to take assets out of the economy.
00:07:01.434 - 00:07:08.562, Speaker A: Got it. Okay, so you're now seeing games that are using these assets that are not tied to outside balance. So it's not trading off chain first.
00:07:08.658 - 00:07:09.410, Speaker D: That's right.
00:07:09.562 - 00:07:20.944, Speaker A: Got it. Got it. And do you think that will solve most of the issues that we see with these highly inflationary reward tokens? Is that the solution to creating, you know, sustainable PTE games?
00:07:21.104 - 00:07:43.096, Speaker D: It's a, it's a weapon that game designers have in their belt. Ultimately, you need to create an economy where people would want to spend, and maybe you're diverting that amount of spend towards player value, whether as nfts or assets. So yeah, it's just part of the tool belt that game designers have to, I guess.
00:07:43.160 - 00:08:11.944, Speaker A: On that note then, what do you think are the important parts to be on chain for games? Because to be honest, I think what we've learned in the past year plus is that most games really don't need to be on chain to be fun at all. And there's often an overemphasis on economy over gameplay in what I've seen in web3 gaming. I'm actually curious, when we go back to first principles, what parts of the gameplay actually can be improved by being on chain. Like do we even need on chain elements?
00:08:12.284 - 00:09:14.620, Speaker D: So putting assets on chain means that you're forcing a data standard that anyone can use, whether it's the game itself or other games that put on it. And putting smart contracts also means that it's basically forced interoperability, which is actually really hard to do outside of blockchain because it's. It's hard for games to really talk to each other even in the same company. You don't see a lot of interoperability between a Warcraft or a Diablo, for example, that has different teams. So hardening these ways that people can work with each other either as assets, whether it's NFTs or ERC 20 tokens, or via smart contracts, but a kind of forced interoperability, which I think is great. Plus with smart contracts, you can have a way to really program value inside and outside the virtual economy. So yeah, I think we're just starting to see how the use cases of these will happen.
00:09:14.620 - 00:09:18.184, Speaker D: And I'm really excited to see the games that are coming up to do this.
00:09:19.004 - 00:09:26.532, Speaker A: And just to clarify, so do you think it makes more sense for games to be closed loops economies, rather than just being completely open from day one?
00:09:26.708 - 00:10:18.464, Speaker D: No, a web3 game should have parts of the economy that are open. But I think it's really hard balance a fully on chain game, because if assets are fully on chain, then that means you will not have any control over assets that are traded on, say, Uniswap or OpenSea. So it's going to be really hard for you to balance the economy. Instead, what we're seeing is that game developers are choosing entry or exit points into the ecosystem and they can do things, for example, like maybe they can tax and exit out of the economy when you turn an off chain element into a token and. Yeah, so they're doing this, or maybe there's a certain level by which you can tokenize an asset. So that means they have greater control over the flows of the economy.
00:10:19.604 - 00:10:53.406, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I think we did an episode and a report on Stepn as well, and we saw a huge issue with kind of just a highly inflationary token being printed and people farming that token and just dumping it right away on exchanges. So I suppose if there is some sort of tax that's implemented when you exit the economy, could maybe help curb some of them. And I guess on that note, as well as a segue, what do you think are the key parts to building a sustainable Pte economy? I guess even taking a step back, do you think games will still continue to be PTE, mostly in web3?
00:10:53.590 - 00:12:01.032, Speaker D: Well, there's a lot of experiments that are happening. I view p two e specifically as using on chain assets, specifically nfts, to earn things of value, whether it's tokens like SLP or even nfts. Gabe Leyden of limit break, which is doing the jidaigaku now, is doing a free to own economy where he's not using any fungible tokens at all. What he's doing is basically like an NFT factory structure, similar to clone x, where holders of the original assets get airdropped new assets, and then they have greater control of the inflation of the economy. Now this has some issues as well, in that the value may skew too much towards the original holders and prevent new people from coming in the economy. So I think we have to balance basically giving too much power to the original holders and making sure that you can still onboard new people into the game. So there's lots of experiments happening.
00:12:01.032 - 00:12:22.204, Speaker D: I have no doubt that a sustainable economy is possible. It's basically just game design. But web3 gaming is new. I think it's very similar to when free to play design was new and people were experimenting, except now we're experimenting with real value and oftentimes people, other people's money. So we have to be a lot more careful about it.
00:12:22.824 - 00:12:35.366, Speaker A: And would you say there are specific types of games that could benefit from using web3 rails, like having some sort of an open economy, or, you know, on chain assets, like specific types of games that you think will take off first?
00:12:35.550 - 00:13:32.886, Speaker D: Yeah, there are some principles because putting a game on chain means that you have some type of economy, and economy means trading between people. So I think this lends itself better to some multiplayer aspect in the game. So because there is literally trading involved, so it doesn't really make sense as much on a single player game. It also lends itself well on where there are different types of jobs to do in the market, in the gameplay itself. So let me give you an example. If there's a game where there's a battler and there's some crafting involved, maybe for the weapons, and then there's gathering of resources, and then if people, maybe content creators streaming the game, there might be an esports team. All of these different jobs means that there's several ways for people to participate without really feeling they have to be the best at battling, for example.
00:13:32.886 - 00:14:13.774, Speaker D: And I also feel that there needs to be a zero sum element into some of these gameplay. For example, some money is at stake, some people win, some people lose because not everyone can make money. And a game that is designed correctly will have people spending more for flexing and status. Basically. Like if a game is a social network and these are the people I care the most about, then I will spend money to flex my status on this network in the same way that you're buying crypto punks or mystic axies, for example. And that means that that money isn't really looking necessarily for a financial return. They're looking for social return.
00:14:15.154 - 00:14:29.466, Speaker A: It's really interesting, that point about kind of zero sum element. I didn't really think about that. So does that mean maybe mostly mmorpgs or maybe games that have some sort of a ranking element to it where, you know, some winners lose? Some winners, some players lose, some players win.
00:14:29.570 - 00:15:29.046, Speaker D: Yeah. Some kind of PvP mechanic really makes sense because if. If all money that comes in is like money that is looking for your financialization, meaning taking money out, then I think everyone will lose over time, because not everyone can win that money. But if people are putting in money themselves for the chance to win greater money, and it's clear in the rules that some people will lose out on this, then you can have things like prize pools, which are very easily understood in the world of games, have an entry fee to have a price pool where people can compete. Then you have people who are helping the competitor. Like, think about it. Similar to f one, right? Like people compete in the race, but it's not just the driver, it's the car and the company behind the car and the teams that help the race, the driver during race day, and all of the sponsors behind it.
00:15:29.046 - 00:15:38.714, Speaker D: And someone has to win, other people will lose, and there are sponsors coming in. So a lot of what, what will be successful in web3 gaming will be similar to those elements.
00:15:39.214 - 00:15:48.798, Speaker A: Does it mean it will have to have some sort of a gambling element to the winning games out there, or do you foresee the losers paying out the winners? Or is it the game paying out only the winners?
00:15:48.966 - 00:16:09.654, Speaker D: So I don't think it necessarily has to be gambling because gambling is typically games of chance where you don't have any control, rather than there will be skill based gaming, people paying an entry fee, getting put in the prize pool, and then the price gets paid out to winners. I would see lots of that happening.
00:16:10.394 - 00:16:40.386, Speaker A: That's really interesting because we don't really see, at least to my knowledge, I don't think that there's a lot of examples like that in web two. And most of the economic activity happening in a traditional game seems to be people buying skins or microtransactions within games like Fortnite where people pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into skins and so on. But I guess you're thinking is that that mode of economic transactions is not going to be the main thing in web3. We're going to have other types of economic activity in web3.
00:16:40.450 - 00:17:11.844, Speaker D: Skins will definitely happen, but skins in CSGO, Fortnite, they already work. So the main thing that you get when you bring skins into web3 is basically just the ability to trade them between people. And I do think that will be an element of it. Yeah, but I think if all we port our skins to web3, I don't think it's enough of a solution. There's not that much difference with current games if that's all that it's doing.
00:17:12.544 - 00:17:38.800, Speaker A: Yeah, that would be pretty sad if all we end up achieving is just like NFT playable skins. Yeah, exactly. That would be pretty sad. So I suppose for the web two game developers out there, they're listening to this and they're thinking, wow, there seems to be some opportunities in web3, but we don't know where to start. What would you say are the areas that, the most interesting areas of web3 that they can incorporate into their games? Yeah.
00:17:38.832 - 00:18:37.754, Speaker D: So really I think game developers should be thinking about it as an economy first. And the biggest difference with economies that we've seen, for example, in free to play, is that you want the economy to be in the hands of the player. And rather than making a lot of money from direct sales, either primary sales or things like in app purchases, you want players to be producing the assets of value in the economy and trading with each other, and you're just probably making money via secondary fees. So this is what makes free to own. Very powerful in that you're not charging anything directly to the player, so you're not taking money out of the economy and you're letting players find their own place in the economy and trade with each other, buy what they think that's valuable. And yeah, basically have your players be your biggest advocates because they are making money while producing the things of value in that economy.
00:18:38.734 - 00:18:53.364, Speaker A: Yeah. And you talk to a lot of these developers through IgG, through your own investments as well. What would you say are some of the biggest or most common pitfalls that you see these kind of non crypto native game developers making when they try to create a web3 game?
00:18:53.744 - 00:19:41.244, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that the most common pitfall is not internalizing the player owned economy. It's very different from what you're doing in free to play, for example, where actually you're optimizing for conversion to in app purchases. So you have liveops set up to do weekend sales and do discounted sales during limited time. But if you're doing this, you're inflating supply of assets. So you really have to think of how to manage asset inflation supply. How many of these assets are on chain, what assets are on chain versus off chain? There's a lot of decisions to make that you don't necessarily have the answer to until you try things out.
00:19:41.874 - 00:19:59.146, Speaker A: So it sounds like it's almost like it's more about creating an economy first than a game. So I guess in terms of teams that you're looking for when you're trying to work with a team or invest in a team that's building a game, are you looking for economists then or are you still looking for the game developers?
00:19:59.330 - 00:20:47.554, Speaker D: We're looking for game developers that have previously shipped games. So they're like they've shipped games and they're successful in that because like if you have the game part down, then we can help. On the web3 side, we're also looking for game developers that have shipped games with some sort of internal economy. So it might have been free to play. It might be an RPG or MMO. Because if you already can think in terms of economy then you can reorient that towards a web3 economy, which is something that we help a lot of these game developers with. But if you're not used to creating games that have an internal economy or you're maybe crypto native but haven't really shipped the game before, I think the market landscape has changed wherein it'll be very difficult for you to get funding.
00:20:48.414 - 00:21:27.494, Speaker A: I definitely agree. And I remember seeing a lot of teams that have zero gaming experience building up crypto native games, and they're able to build some pretty cool games out there. But the DNA is so different from a pure gaming focused team because especially having spent the past two or so months in Korea, I met with a few kind of large gaming studios, and these guys are completely different types of people than folks I would usually talk to in the cryptonative land building cryptonative games. And on that note, I'm sure you talked to a lot of traditional game studios as well. Would you say there are some large missing gaps that web3 or crypto native gaming devs need to learn from web two studios?
00:21:27.834 - 00:22:23.248, Speaker D: Yeah. So shipping a game is incredibly complex that requires a lot of different skill sets. You need art, you need game design, you need code, you typically need a lot of backend server skills. And, yeah, putting these together into a working product that is actually fun is very, very hard. So there's a lot of operational excellence that, that goes into shipping a good game. And I think a lot of teams that come to web3, a lot of them are like zero to one thinkers, conceptual thinkers that may have original ideas, but I don't think we've seen the kind of basically operational excellence that we've seen in the top games come into web3. There's already teams that have been funded and starting to build product, but typically a good game has a dev cycle of around two to three years.
00:22:23.248 - 00:22:36.204, Speaker D: So I think there's a lag in the market right now where the teams got funded last year, earlier this year, starting to build product, and we're not going to see the fruits of that labor until maybe end of year or sometime next year.
00:22:40.544 - 00:22:45.328, Speaker A: Hey, guys, I'm really excited to tell you more about one of my favorite products in crypto right now, DyDX.
00:22:45.456 - 00:22:46.704, Speaker B: This is a team I've known since.
00:22:46.744 - 00:22:48.416, Speaker A: 2018, and they've built one of the.
00:22:48.440 - 00:23:25.758, Speaker B: Best exchange venues out there that also happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly. Now listen until the end, because there's an opportunity for savvy traders out there as well. And here are just a few reasons why I like DyDx over other exchanges. First, it's very liquid. It processes two to $3 billion every day in volume, and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording. Which means you can trade things like Ethereum, bitcoin, doge Solana, and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today. Second, it's also extremely cheap and if you're down bad from the bear market, you don't have to worry about gas fees at all because there is no gas fee on starkware L2 where DyDX is built on.
00:23:25.758 - 00:24:03.010, Speaker B: Now that brings me to my next point as well. It's incredibly fast. Unlike other L2 and high speed Dexs, you don't actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore. And as an additional point, by using Starkware, DyDX also provides user with increased security and privacy. And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature, which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so many different sub accounts. And their iOS mobile app is also live right now. And it's amazing because it's compatible with Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Coin 98, Huawei Wallet, and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there.
00:24:03.010 - 00:24:31.574, Speaker B: And it's available for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today. And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions, the most recent tier in the $10,000 equity tier, have won over over $95,000 in rewards. And you can get started with as low as $500 in equity to compete for prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DYDX exchange to learn more. And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:24:33.874 - 00:25:21.468, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think people seem to have a misconception about how long it takes to build these games because in Defi, right, we're used to uniswaps basically being forked and you're having a front end spun up in one day. But then these games, as you mentioned, take like two to three years. And I think AAA titles take even longer than that. So I am excited for the coming few years, but I think a lot of people have over inflated expectations of what to see. I mean, last year, I guess, on that note. So one big part of the entire web3 gaming narrative was obviously guilds, of which YGG was at the helm of that. And I guess, first of all, how do you think guilds have evolved amidst this wider, I guess, exploration of what games actually work, what type of models work, right?
00:25:21.516 - 00:26:13.246, Speaker D: So guilds have been around for a very long time. The first guilds were probably around in Ultima online in the late nineties. And of course there have been guilds around World of Warcraft, Runescape, and other games. And I guess with the rise of Yggdras and other guilds, what you've seen are guilds that are handling real value as part of their treasury balance sheet, right. And a lot of the guilds that were set up last year basically set up to mine the economy using SLP, profiting from that. And yeah, that led to an imbalance in the market where there was money invested, but more money was taken out than in. We've been careful so that we're always investing in the game economy and actually very slow to sell, especially NFT assets.
00:26:13.246 - 00:26:57.774, Speaker D: So we're still one of the largest asset holders in Axie Infinity, I think, with over 200,000 axies. And even as the markets go down, we've kept that number because we believe that the game will bounce back. So now that the market is down and yields have dried up, guilds have really figured out that they need to pivot and see how they can build value into these games. Axie is a good point in this. There's still a lot of guilds that are very active in Axie. A lot of them have pivoted to either creator focused guilds, guilds that are specializing on esports, for example. They're guilds that focus on building product to help other people maybe manage assets or navigate the games.
00:26:57.774 - 00:27:23.594, Speaker D: So people are seeing that you need to do something of value that is not just farming assets in the game and selling it. Because, yeah, if everyone did that, then the game would not be sustainable. And that is why guilds are also pivoting to a prize pool model. Because if everyone paid an entry fee into a prize pool, and then you took the money out of that to pay people who are winning, then that's a more sustainable model as well.
00:27:24.074 - 00:27:28.134, Speaker A: Pricing model as in like people have to pay an entry fee before they can be a part of the guild.
00:27:29.074 - 00:27:46.014, Speaker D: Before they can have access to earnings, for example. So for example, season one of earnings, there might be $10 entry fee. People go in, pay that fee, and then 90% of that pride pool is paid out to the winners.
00:27:46.714 - 00:28:26.452, Speaker A: I see, I see. So creator focused guilds and price pool models seem like the newer iterations of what guilds look like. I remember we actually did an interview with the founder of Blockchain space, which is a data analytics platform for guilds, and he mentioned that there are two types of guilds that he saw in this space, and this is about a year ago. There's micro guilds that are guilds that are really reliant on scholarships so they really are trying to grind these rewards and they make money just from the rewards. And then there's macro guilds. So like guilds that mostly derive most of the value from investments they make. So I think YGG invested in a lot of really great games in the early days, and a lot of the balance sheet is from investments in those games.
00:28:26.452 - 00:28:32.396, Speaker A: Do you agree with this distinction, and do you think that's still going to continue to be true? Like, you get these micro guilds and.
00:28:32.420 - 00:29:07.054, Speaker D: Macro guilds, last year that distinction was more true. I think this year guilds are specializing even further. It could be esports, it could be creators, could be investments, it could be product. There are some service guilds that work for other guilds. For example. There are guilds that help with lore, for example, in different games. So you're seeing different kinds of work, guilds that have a specialization and sell their services to other guilds or daos or games.
00:29:07.794 - 00:29:12.542, Speaker A: Got it. So guilds are basically almost like a subset of daos at this point.
00:29:12.718 - 00:29:20.594, Speaker D: Yeah, I think there is a very close intersection, and at some level, guilds and daos are similar.
00:29:21.974 - 00:29:31.566, Speaker A: Got it. Are there like specific guilds that you think are doing interesting things that maybe you haven't thought of before or just interesting up and comers that people might not be aware of?
00:29:31.750 - 00:30:17.974, Speaker D: Actually, in terms of, I think more of them as a dao or than a guild. But there's a Dao called Strider, which is doing very interesting work. So Strider, in a nutshell, wants to be the Ygg for intellectual property. That means there is a really good creator that's creating IP, but he or she wants to do it within a community setting. So there's a way for community members to work on IP together and help shape it along with the creator. And then when that IP is used, maybe it's licensed to a game or a film or a book. Then the proceeds will be used to distribute between not only the primary creator, but the other contributors of the guild.
00:30:17.974 - 00:30:27.034, Speaker D: So I'm really fascinated in that type of, I would say, work Dao structure and how you can decentralize groups, creating value together.
00:30:28.014 - 00:30:58.292, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm really excited to see that because we just wrote a memo on a project called Treasure Dao, and they're basically trying to create, like, a community focused lore where, you know, people contribute to the lore and create games for it. And that reminded me, actually of one of the first interviews we ever did on this show back in 2018 with a company with a project called Solarius and their whole pitch was that they're going to create a Sci-Fi economy and then creators, artists, filmmakers all around the world are going to come in and create ip and they never, never really took off because there's really, that was.
00:30:58.308 - 00:30:59.828, Speaker D: A consensus project, right?
00:30:59.956 - 00:31:01.156, Speaker A: Yes, it was. It was.
00:31:01.260 - 00:31:08.820, Speaker D: But yeah, I heard about it as well. It was pretty cool, kind of a few years ahead of its time, but yeah, it was definitely a cool concept.
00:31:08.972 - 00:31:47.324, Speaker A: It was, it was definitely a few years ahead of its time. And I think at that time they didn't have, there's no like NFTs at the time, there's no PTE, there's no incentive for people to create content. I guess now there's a lot more tools for daos and, you know, creators to, to really use, to incentivize people. So I'm, I think, you know, folks, things like Strider would make a lot more sense in the market right now. And I love to kind of pivot and talk a little bit about you as an investor as well. So obviously you are an angel investor yourself and you also angel invest with Tangent, this collective of other founders. So in general, what do you look for in a winning game investment and is it different from like other types of startups?
00:31:47.944 - 00:32:38.284, Speaker D: So for a game specifically, I'm looking for founders who have experience, especially in the genre that they're making in. I think going from web two to web3 is hard enough. If you have expertise in the game that you're doing and taking that to web3, then I think that's a really good tact to take. It's hard when maybe you've never shipped a game before or you're doing a game in a completely different genre that you know, and then you're adding in how to design an open economy via web3 for the first time. So a lot of investors in games want to minimize some of those risks by investing in proven game developers who have a certain subject matter expertise and then helping them turn that into a web3 game.
00:32:39.304 - 00:33:02.914, Speaker A: Got it. Got it. And I guess it sounds quite similar to what you would look for in any other startup vertical. You're looking for experienced founders. Are there like specific elements in games given how subjective taste is and how hard it is to predict what games take off? Are there certain signs or maybe questions you would ask these founders when you talk to them to really suss out whether they're the right person for you to back?
00:33:04.014 - 00:34:10.030, Speaker D: We ask a lot about how they think about the economy, number one, and second, what their approach is to community building. So in my opinion, the tokenomics and the community are really what separate a web3 game from everything else. Of course you need to make a good game. Of course you need to be, it needs to be fun. But even when talking about fun, it's kind of useless when you hear advice, for example, like, oh, a game has to be fun and it needs to have a sustainable economy. Of course it needs to have both. When you talk to me about fun, can you drill it down? Is it fun? Fun on the game mechanics themselves, is it fun on the elder or meta game mechanic? Is it fun from community interactions? Is it fun in terms of being able to do things together as a group or as a community? Is it fun because it's fun to speculate and trade together as well? Like, I have a lot of fun trading on Opensea with my friends looking for the best, best nfts that we want to own together.
00:34:10.030 - 00:34:21.154, Speaker D: So you have to be able to break that down into mechanics and elements and really be able to apply systems thinking and economies based thinking into game development.
00:34:22.134 - 00:34:41.768, Speaker A: Yeah, the science of fun, I like that. And that's something that I never really kind of thought about. What makes a game actually fun? It seems such a subjective thing, but I guess from what you're saying, it seems like you're actually able to break it down into its constituent parts and maybe actually predict whether this game would be fun or not. Yeah.
00:34:41.816 - 00:35:12.524, Speaker D: So for example, a lot of people say Axie is not fun. Well, give you some news. I was playing Axie 4 hours a day and it wasn't to grind for SLP. Right. It was fun because the mechanics of owning assets together with community and being able to compete with each other on card game format were a lot of fun, especially for people who like Hearthstone or magic the gathering. So it's very lazy to throw out. Oh, Axie is not fun or step in is not fun or whatever.
00:35:12.524 - 00:35:35.844, Speaker D: Yes, you may have like elements in the game that are not fun, but if you saw what worked overall, the fun of being able to do things as a group, as a community, along with ownership, actually exceeded the shortcomings that it may have on fun on the mechanical level. And that's something for game designers to think of as they're creating their game.
00:35:36.334 - 00:35:46.074, Speaker A: And I realize this might be an extremely general question, but what are some ways that a web3 game can make itself fun?
00:35:46.694 - 00:36:10.332, Speaker D: Right? Well, yeah, let's go into different elements. Right. So fun in terms of mechanics. Like it has to feel good while you're doing this. So this is basically you know, a shooter or a MOBA that feels good, or card game mechanics that makes sense. And then you have the metagame mechanic. What are you building towards? Am I trying to get to level 100? There are the group mechanics.
00:36:10.332 - 00:37:06.664, Speaker D: Am I doing this within a multiplayer, in a game or as a group? What kind of game? Or clan mechanics that I have so that we are building together as basically as a group, which lends to better retention? What are the things that are coming in the game that can surprise me? What can I look forward to so that it's not just the same mechanics being repeated all over again? What can I own in this economy? Yeah, what are the things I'm looking forward to that I own that will have value, to basically reward the work that I have creating value in these games? So these are the elements of fun that you should look into. And of course you want players to be able to spend money in game, not just for financial reason, because they're either having fun at one of the elements that we mentioned, or because they want to flex their social status at the group of people that are in that environment.
00:37:07.804 - 00:37:49.454, Speaker A: So mechanics, which is the gameplay itself, the metagame, like, what are you trying to achieve within the game? And then also ownership, like, what assets are you owning, what business are you trading? Those three are big, big elements and that's a really, really clear breakdown. So for founders out there, hopefully that was really helpful for you. Now, at the same time, when I think about these three things, they often strike me as quite subjective. So, like for you, for instance, what you think is a fun mechanics might not be the same for me. So for me, as an investor, it's always been hard to pick out individual game titles. So I almost prefer to make the lazier bet and kind of go at the infrastructure level. I don't know if you feel the same, like, do you feel yourself gravitating more towards like, game infra versus, like individual games when you invest?
00:37:49.954 - 00:38:40.540, Speaker D: So it's actually super hard to bet on games. I think VC money in games is a sort of relatively more recent phenomenon. Even a 16 G just created their first games fund recently, even though they've been investing in games for the last maybe seven or eight years. But it's been hard to apply VC money in games, especially because a lot of it is based on taste and your knowledge in playing games. And it's not until recently when you can more concretely, I would say, look at the financial aspects of the game that it's easier to do VC bets on it. However, betting on games can be incredibly rewarding. I mean, look at the people who've done 1000 x on Axie, for example.
00:38:40.540 - 00:39:20.948, Speaker D: So games are also seen as a hit driven business. So where it's driven by taste, it's a lot harder to predict what will be the winners. You can't just apply pure logic to it. So I guess it's a little bit like picking movies. Which one will be billion dollar blockbuster, right? Yeah, but now that you're basically creating economies, it's easier to bet on founders that know how to build virtual economies and turn them into open web3 economies. And if you're able to attract a lot of money there, then you'll have a valuable economy that other people will build on top of. The best example in web two being Roblox, for example.
00:39:20.948 - 00:39:39.784, Speaker D: Roblox has been around for, I think around 15 years already and now it's such a valuable platform for others to create user generated content on and make money. And yeah, I think Roblox is proving that the best economies can prove as platforms for others to build on top of.
00:39:40.764 - 00:40:22.744, Speaker A: That makes sense. And no, I totally agree with you in terms of how hits driven games are and how difficult it is to pick winning games. So that's why I find myself looking a lot at game infrastructure, maybe software that allows people to build games or gaming engines or gaming economic infrastructure. As I mentioned just now, one of the recent episodes we did is with Treasure Dao, and their whole thesis is we're going to build economic infrastructure for web3 games, which I thought was a pretty interesting thesis. From your perspective, do you invest in any infrastructure for games? And if so, what would you say are the biggest missing pieces from an infrastructure perspective right now?
00:40:23.164 - 00:41:15.594, Speaker D: Yeah, I've invested in infrastructure for games from teams like Stardust that are creating infrastructure to add web3 economies to games. Guilds are a form of infrastructure as well. So we've created our subdao network, which is basically a geographical daos, subdaos of YDG that onboard community into web3 and then into these games. So we've created the subdos across Southeast Asia, India, Latam, Brazil, Japan, Korea, Turkey and other places in the world that we're looking at right now. And then there's the things that you can build on top of the guilds, like could it be lending, for example, could it be a benefits marketplace for these web3 workers? So there's actually a ton of stuff to build now that web3 games are becoming economies on their own.
00:41:16.414 - 00:41:44.974, Speaker A: Yeah, and one of our earlier bets with Tangent is what they were doing lending for guilds in the beginning, but I think the market kind of shrank a bit. So they pivoted slightly. But I do think that infrastructure for guilds make a lot of sense as well, especially should the PDE games come back in a big way. So I guess on that note, if you were to say, try to find the next billion dollar company building web3 gaming infrastructure, what would that company be building?
00:41:46.634 - 00:42:30.710, Speaker D: Well, that's a great question. I think you have to look at the particular insight that the founder has. So people talk a lot about product market fit. I also take a look a lot at the founder market fit. So for example, we recently invested in Capital Dao, which is also infrastructure to move assets in different guilds and daos more efficiently across web3 gaming. And a lot of teams have tried to take on that particular market. Capital Dao has shown that they have a lot of expertise in the SaaS area that allow them to do this really quickly.
00:42:30.710 - 00:43:17.404, Speaker D: Like they know SaaS, they know web3 gaming. So the particular intersection on that is something that they're uniquely good at, which is why we invested in them and then when we're working with some of the games in our portfolio to integrate them. So yeah, so if you look at the founder like what edge do they have that sets them apart? It's hard to bet, for example, on bunch of people who think they have insights on web3 gaming but have never produced a game yet because there's so much that they don't know. They may be really good at smart contracts, for example, they may be really good at community, but if you've never shipped a game, then you might want to gain experience in that first by joining a team or making one yourself in your own time before you're raising funding for it.
00:43:17.944 - 00:43:35.514, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. And I think people seem to have this, this misconception that successful founders are always like college whiz kids dropping out of school. But I think read somewhere that the median age for like unicorn founders is actually a lot older than 18. I forgot the exact number, but it's over 40.
00:43:35.594 - 00:43:38.306, Speaker D: So yeah, I think it's like somewhere.
00:43:38.330 - 00:43:55.474, Speaker A: In the mid thirties to forties. So yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense to better founders with that experience. And on this note about looking at the next billion dollar companies, are there specific projects that you're really excited about, both as a builder in the space and also as an investor right now?
00:43:56.094 - 00:44:48.774, Speaker D: Definitely excited about what Gabe Leyden is building with limit break and Digidaigaku. Gabe's previous company, Machine Zone, was one of the most aggressive companies in the free to play era and defined the playbook of user acquisition in free to play gaming. And you see that Gabe is taking on a very different approach in web3. So I'm really excited to see what comes out of that. Yeah, there's a bunch more games that are coming out. Some of them I can't talk about, but some of them are in the horizon games like Block Lords, which is a medieval strategy game, but each of the person in the army is basically a person. Games like Civitas, which is also a strategy game with different things for players to do.
00:44:48.774 - 00:45:24.742, Speaker D: And a lot of that team is really backed by veterans of games such as Eve Online. And there's a bunch more. And there's honestly so many things I'm excited about for the next two years. And I think that in the current market, this is really the time to build. What excites me getting up every day is that I don't really need to check where the price of any asset is at. There's a lot of work to do in building the future that we think should happen. And yeah, as a builder, this bear market is very different from the last one because in the last bear market, there was barely any money.
00:45:24.742 - 00:45:46.514, Speaker D: There were barely any kind of real use cases. Even the VC's money were drying up and companies were dying left and right. Here you're seeing that there's a lot of well funded teams that are still getting funding. It may be taking longer, valuations may be lower, but people are heads down building product. The best of the best are coming to web3 and I can't be more excited.
00:45:47.134 - 00:46:03.874, Speaker A: Yeah, no, absolutely. And before we end, I'd love to double click on that limit break news as well because I think last or two months ago, they announced that they, I think, raised $200 million to build a blockchain game. So can you talk a little bit about, like, why do they need that much money to build this? Like, what is. What are they building?
00:46:04.414 - 00:46:59.624, Speaker D: So first of all, it doesn't take $200 million to build a game. What Gabe represents is a very experienced founder who changed a lot of the landscape in free to play. And investors are willing to put $200 million pre product launch, betting that he can revolutionize web3 gaming again. Knowing Gabe, he's going to spend a lot of that money on mass user acquisition once the product is out and proven that it could scale. Right now, he's done several NFT drops in the free to own model, similar to what Clonex has done, but I can assure you he already has a game in his back pocket and I haven't seen it yet. But when it comes out, and I think Gabe has mentioned that it will be web based where you can connect your wallet, I'm really excited to see it. I own a few digits personally.
00:46:59.624 - 00:47:16.164, Speaker D: YGG also swept the floor in the open market for some digis at like 1.3 ETH, so that's worked out pretty well. So yeah, like we want to be a guild that has a big presence in whatever game world Digidai Gaku has got it.
00:47:16.204 - 00:47:45.924, Speaker A: And honestly that I think that's one of the things that gets me really excited to work with you is because you always have a great finger on the pulse of what's going on. And I think YGG is always at the forefront of whatever is the next big game that's coming out. You guys always seem to be already aware of it or already involved somehow. So there's this uncanny ability to find out the next big thing. So as always, learned a ton from you in this episode. For people who want to follow you or be a part of YGG or check out what you guys are doing, what are the best channels for them to do this?
