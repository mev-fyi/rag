00:00:02.040 - 00:00:03.862, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, gentlemen, welcome to the.
00:00:03.878 - 00:00:38.944, Speaker B: Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto. And before we get started, just a reminder for you guys out there. The Blockcrunch podcast is intended for informational purposes only. Neither the host nor its guests or licensed financial advisors, and nothing discussed should be construed as financial advice.

00:00:39.284 - 00:00:53.390, Speaker A: Today's episode is brought to you by Protocol Labs, the guys behind Filecoin. And with us today is Colin Efrin from Filecoin, who can tell us a little bit more about what's one interesting way that people have used Filecoin to build? So, Colin, take it away. Yeah.
00:00:53.422 - 00:01:32.114, Speaker C: Filecoin has been used to store hundreds of petabytes of web two data, helping web3 cross the chasm into, what I would argue, mass adoption. Developers have built onboarding platforms like singularity, sjury and file drive, and more to mimic s three interfaces and onboard datasets like genocide testimonials from the Shoah Foundation, New York government public datasets, and large scientific data sets from universities like Berkeley. Within web3, Falcon has been able to provide redundancy for our top NFT platforms like Magic OpenSea, storing a large fraction of web3's nfts and secure gaming assets through Unreal Engine five.
00:01:32.814 - 00:01:33.422, Speaker D: Hello there.
00:01:33.478 - 00:02:03.220, Speaker A: Now, before I move on, I'd love to thank the hundreds of you who have subscribed to blockchain, because with your support I've been able to share my real thoughts on specific projects that I don't usually share on interviews in a format that I enjoy more, which is bi weekly written posts. We've also been able to offer exclusive AMA's, sharing my investment frameworks, interactable models, and breaking down important trends before they become big. Now, we even had Elon Musk comment on one of our threads recently. So if you haven't already, head on over to theBlockcrunch.com VIP and you can.
00:02:03.252 - 00:02:05.116, Speaker B: Access dozens of hours of research for.
00:02:05.140 - 00:02:44.776, Speaker A: What you'd spend on a coffee a day. So welcome back to another episode of the BlockCrunch podcast. Now, this week's episode is quite interesting because we have a two parter. So the first part of this interview is free and public to all, and the second part is only for our blockchain vip subscribers, which you can find on the BlockCrunch.com VIP and now, the guests here we have this week is really a special investor that I've just had the opportunity to meet last year and observe how they performed over the last year. And I would say that they're one of the very few people who navigated last year incredibly well. And last year was undoubtedly one of the toughest years to be in crypto.
00:02:44.776 - 00:03:34.718, Speaker A: With back to back systemic blow ups. From the $60 billion wipeout of terra Luna over a number of days to the $30 billion implosion of the FCX scam, very few investors were savvy enough to profitably navigate all of these landmines and come out on top by the end of the year. Now, even now, as we record this episode in mid January, the shadow of DCG, potentially becoming insolvent, still looms over us. So we're not really out of the woods yet. But one of the investors whose commentary has really helped me kind of contextualize a lot of these events is halpress from North Rock Digital. Hes an up and coming fund whos known by his audience on Twitter for his constant, timely market commentary. And Hal previously spent five years at Morgan Stanley before becoming a long, short investor in tech at Maverick Capital, which is a $15 billion hedge fund.
00:03:34.718 - 00:04:13.374, Speaker A: Now, in November of 2021, he finally left to start Northwark Digital, his own crypto hedge fund. Now, of all the investors I met last year, as I mentioned, very few really navigated the large crisis as nimbly as how. And ive always wanted to pick his brain on just how he thinks about investing. What is his framework for BET selection, for bet sizing his time horizon, how he quantifies or qualifies narratives, which is something that I think is more of an art than a science. And as you will see in this episode, there's a very different approach to some of the other investors that we've brought on the show before. And as I mentioned before, this will be a two parter. The first part, we're going to focus on a house investment process.
00:04:13.374 - 00:04:57.272, Speaker A: Specific bets, bet sizing, some of the commentary on the immediate horizon. Now for the more specific things we're going to reserve for our vip's. So these are things such as with the incoming recession, how health things crypto will perform in a recession, as well as the opportunity that might arise from the DCG situation and what Hal's breakdown of the event is. We're also going to dive into how specific bet, specifically discussing things like DyDX, and also specific indicators that Hal looks at when trying to identify and front run narratives. Now, we're going to open that part of the interview to all of our audience in about a month's time. But as a vip subscriber, you can access it today on the vip website. Again, you can head on over to the blockchain.com
00:04:57.272 - 00:05:03.376, Speaker A: vip. Now, without further ado, let's jump into the interview with Halpress from Northrop Digital.
00:05:03.520 - 00:05:04.128, Speaker D: Thank you, Jason.
00:05:04.176 - 00:05:06.044, Speaker E: Thank you for having me on. I'm looking forward to it.
00:05:06.424 - 00:05:15.884, Speaker A: Definitely. So just to kick us off, I don't want to, you know, make you walk through an entire resume again, but I just curious, can you explain to us what is NRD's thesis and how did it get started?
00:05:16.664 - 00:05:45.126, Speaker E: So, yeah, I mean, you walked through the basics of my background. Just to give some context. I started my career at Morgan Stanley trading equity derivatives. I covered tech there for three years, and that's where I learned most of my base financial information and also sort of investment management skills. And then from there got a more fundamental background. Did a year in equity research and a year in private equity, also at Morgan Stanley before, as you mentioned, moving to Maverick. Those six, those first six years were.
00:05:45.150 - 00:05:48.990, Speaker D: Really training for then trying to pivot.
00:05:49.022 - 00:06:03.638, Speaker E: And start my own fund. You know, I didn't always know that it wanted to be in crypto. I actually only discovered crypto in 2020. So I'm relatively new to the space. But as soon as I did, you know, I have quite an obsessive personality.
00:06:03.806 - 00:06:06.486, Speaker D: And there's a lot of, there's a.
00:06:06.510 - 00:06:54.658, Speaker E: There'S a large rabbit hole to go down if you have the type of personality likes to go down rabbit holes, which I do. And so I fell very deep down the crypto rabbit hole when I did start going down that path in 2020. And I came to really two foundational conclusions that led me to start Northrock. One is I do believe that the blockchain innovation is a real step function technology innovation that will unleash a lot of future white space for innovation beyond that. Now, that's very different concept than saying that all the tokens that use some sort of blockchain technology have value. Those are two very different distinctions. And I'm certainly a believer in the core blockchain technology, but less so in sort of the fact that all these tokens that use it to have value.
00:06:54.658 - 00:07:41.674, Speaker E: I think there are some that do, but I'm more skeptical of that. But that first innovation just led me to the belief that this is going to be a very interesting space to sort of spend time in from an intellectual curiosity standpoint. And then because I think there are going to be a lot of cool things that get created from it. But then the second factor, which I think is arguably more important in terms of my decision to start the fund in crypto, is just that. I think crypto is an extremely. Well, I would even go so far as to say it's the least efficient liquid market that exists in the world today. There are probably more inefficient markets, but they're not very liquid because crypto is very liquid and also very inefficient, especially relative to equities, which is where I've been spending time before.
00:07:42.294 - 00:07:44.846, Speaker D: And so as an active manager, that's.
00:07:44.910 - 00:08:33.304, Speaker E: Highly attractive, because your goal is essentially to outperform some benchmark. You can set that benchmark many different ways, but whatever you set it at, your goal is to outperform that. And the efficiency of the market directly correlates with the ease of actually outperforming that benchmark. The less efficient, the better. And so, you know, going to the least efficient place, I think, makes a ton of sense. Like I say, it's sort of similar to, like, if you could play soccer against a bunch of high schoolers or against the pros, and you have the same prize money if you win in either league, which one do you want to go to? Like, I'd rather not compete against the pros, and so I view the equity investors as sort of pros, and I'd rather compete against less efficient environment, which I think exists in crypto.
00:08:33.684 - 00:09:17.424, Speaker A: Yeah, no, especially after watching the World Cup, I saw how unattainable it is to play soccer against the pro. So I totally hear what you say. I think it's interesting because when I first started in the business as well, we began as a long, short hedge fund back in 2018 at Spartan, and one of the only ones in this space. But back then, I think correlations were really high, and there were less instruments to short, and the markets were even more inefficient. I think the space now is probably more ready for a long, short type fund, which, as I understand, is what NRD is. I'm curious, though, what do you think are still some of the missing pieces in this industry for a fund like yours that exists in the equity world? Are there still some infrastructure or some efficiency that doesn't exist yet?
00:09:17.724 - 00:09:18.884, Speaker E: It's a tricky question.
00:09:18.964 - 00:09:23.084, Speaker D: I mean, the ease of sort of.
00:09:23.124 - 00:09:38.862, Speaker E: Running a long short book requires you to have the ability to short things, and that's not always as easy as it would seem. It's certainly not as easy as it is in the equity space. Without getting into too much detail, there.
00:09:38.878 - 00:09:42.270, Speaker D: Are ways to do it, but that's.
00:09:42.302 - 00:10:23.828, Speaker E: Certainly something that I think makes it a bit harder. But I think the barrier to entry is really not so much about the infrastructure as much as it's about. They're just very different markets in terms of the market psychology. In equities, you'll run a long, short book primarily based off of fundamentals, because I think in equities, fundamentals are much easier to gauge, whereas in crypto they play a role, but they're certainly not as powerful at driver as they are in equities. And you really have to be able to understand the other drivers. And also there's an element of just volatility in the crypto space that I think is probably hard for some equity investors.
00:10:23.876 - 00:10:26.796, Speaker D: And also just the fact that it's.
00:10:26.820 - 00:10:36.356, Speaker E: Open 24/7 like you can wake up on a Saturday morning and have a short up 50% for no random reason.
00:10:36.420 - 00:10:39.104, Speaker D: Just cause, just cause.
00:10:39.524 - 00:10:51.174, Speaker E: And that takes some getting used to from sort of a mental capacity standpoint to be able to handle that kind of constant uncertainty.
00:10:51.554 - 00:10:56.818, Speaker D: I think those sort of emotional barriers.
00:10:56.866 - 00:11:01.334, Speaker E: Are probably steeper than the actual infrastructure barriers.
00:11:01.994 - 00:11:34.094, Speaker A: That's really interesting, and we're going to get into specific bets and some of the thesis that you've outlined on Twitter in a bit. But before that, I love to talk about your investment process first, because I think a lot of equities investing that you did in before probably involves things like excel modeling, looking at earnings, whereas in crypto, it's still not entirely clear if those things even drive price. It's not entirely clear what moves price. So how much of your previous job can you actually carry to your daily process today, and what parts of that do you think can be discarded, at least for now?
00:11:34.474 - 00:11:34.874, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:11:34.914 - 00:11:48.390, Speaker D: Well, just to start, I think that earnings in. Okay, so the core first principle, sort of tenet that this is all based.
00:11:48.422 - 00:12:24.724, Speaker E: Off of, is the idea that the asset is worth the current value of future cash flows. Right. Because that's what forecasting the earnings is actually about. I think that's probably a fair assumption. In equities, however, I don't think that the earnings actually directly drive price. And equities either with a company earns more or less money, does not actually create buy or sell pressure in the stock. What creates the buyer and sell pressure in the stock is the investor that bases their buy or sell decisions off of the fact that the company is making or losing more money.
00:12:24.724 - 00:13:05.358, Speaker E: That fundamental link is only as strong as the investors willingness to adjust their flow based off of the fundamentals. Sometimes that that relationship is quite strong in equities for a generic stock like Apple, even with Apple, a lot of times it isn't either, but it's stronger. And then you get a situation like GameStop and it's completely irrelevant. Right. So even in equities, I don't think that earnings really drive price so directly as people think. I think the investor set there is much more focused on it. So it's certainly impacts their flow decisions more than in other areas.
00:13:05.358 - 00:13:26.154, Speaker E: But even there, I'd say it doesn't actually drive price. The only thing that actually drives price is supply and demand for the actual asset. In crypto, I think it's not binary. It's not a yes or a no. As we said, Apple is probably pretty far towards the yes direction GameStop, pretty far towards the no direction crypto. It varies too. It is everywhere on that spectrum.
00:13:26.154 - 00:14:09.070, Speaker E: I think this sort of valuation modeling does thing drive price to some degree in crypto, because there are some investors that base their investment decisions off of fundamentals, and so the fundamentals will therefore impact their flow decisions, which will then therefore impact price. And I think the degree to which that occurs is really correlated to the proportion of investors in crypto that care about those things. And as you pointed out, I think that proportion of investors is smaller than in equities, but they do exist. And so it is important. And I think ultimately, a lot of crypto is driven by narratives. However, narratives can form based off of the fundamentals as well. So I definitely think that they matter.
00:14:09.070 - 00:14:30.966, Speaker E: The strength of the correlation is certainly weaker, and there's other things that matter too, but it's certainly a factor that is relevant. And so just to close the loop on that, in terms of how I bring my sort of other day job into this or my prior day job, I have a couple of analysts that.
00:14:30.990 - 00:14:34.254, Speaker D: Work under me now, but we do.
00:14:34.294 - 00:15:02.880, Speaker E: Build models for most of the things that we invest in. I've shared my Ethereum model. I think I may have published a screenshot of our Lido model. We do build models. I think even in equities this is the case. The point of the model isn't really to spit out a value of what the asset is worth. It's more just to get an understanding of the ballpark and then also understand which variables drive that value and sort of the sensitivity of them.
00:15:02.880 - 00:15:20.524, Speaker E: It's really just a sensitivity tool to understand how changes in these different variables will actually impact its value. They still think that's useful. That process is quite useful in crypto. So we don't base our investment decisions off of the number from some DCF in a model, but it's part of the process. It's a piece of the process that we use.
00:15:21.204 - 00:15:38.424, Speaker A: And I'd love to double click on that point about narratives as well, because you said before that crypto is a deeply narrative driven asset class, which to many people might seem very qualitative and at times amorphous. So how do you define a narrative, first of all? And how do you spot it and how do you play it?
00:15:39.204 - 00:15:46.192, Speaker E: Yeah, so I've said this many times and I definitely believe it, crypto is a game of positioning for narratives before they exist.
00:15:46.388 - 00:15:50.964, Speaker D: That's really, you know, that's the game in a nutshell.
00:15:51.704 - 00:15:58.304, Speaker E: And yeah, to your point, what is a narrative? You know, that's kind of a very open ended thing. I mean, what I think it is.
00:15:58.344 - 00:16:05.764, Speaker D: Is a reason to expect future price appreciation.
00:16:06.304 - 00:16:09.016, Speaker E: That is really the actual narrative itself.
00:16:09.160 - 00:16:11.368, Speaker D: So, for example, the merge was a.
00:16:11.376 - 00:16:30.966, Speaker E: Very strong narrative, and it's in the past now, so we could talk about it objectively. There was a view that once the merge occurred, its tokenomics would drastically change and that would drive future price appreciation. So in its purest sense, that is the narrative. Its the reason to expect future price appreciation. That really is the narrative, because no one will buy or sell something because.
00:16:31.030 - 00:16:34.350, Speaker D: They think theres really good things happening.
00:16:34.382 - 00:16:58.264, Speaker E: At this very moment. Youre buying and selling because you are speculating somethings going to happen in the future. You care about the future price appreciation. And so the narrative itself is really that, it's that reason to expect future price appreciation that you look for or reason to expect future price decline. Like, there's also, like you said, we're long short, so we do have short theses as well. And you can have powerful short narratives as well as long narratives.
00:16:58.884 - 00:17:02.908, Speaker D: And then how do you spot them? I think there's a lot of different.
00:17:02.956 - 00:17:05.380, Speaker E: Factors that go into it. I mean, I think you have to.
00:17:05.412 - 00:17:10.183, Speaker D: Understand broad market conditions because certain narratives.
00:17:10.343 - 00:17:46.398, Speaker E: Might take hold in a bull market that won't take hold in a bear market and vice versa. You have to understand the positioning in the asset at the current time. If there's a narrative, but everyone already knows the narrative, then that's not really relevant because what you only think you care about is incremental buyers and sellers. And yeah, you have to be able to forecast a little bit into the future and think multiple steps of how things will unfold, how things are likely to develop, and then after they develop, what the reaction to them is going to be and how that's going to either self reinforce or not. And so I think there's an element.
00:17:46.446 - 00:17:51.486, Speaker D: Of sort of market environment understanding, as.
00:17:51.510 - 00:17:54.434, Speaker E: Well as psychology and sort of forecasting.
00:17:54.934 - 00:18:08.154, Speaker A: And maybe, can you provide me with an example of narrative that you spotted before anybody else? And maybe the ETH merch could be a good example of that. Where did you find a narrative, and when did you decide that, hey, this is going to become a big thing thing?
00:18:08.654 - 00:19:24.630, Speaker E: So this goes back to something you asked me about before we started recording, which is one of our core sort of philosophies at the fund, is this idea of 90 ten, which is 90% of an investors job is sitting on your hands doing nothing, and then 10% of your job, and any of that 90%, you pass on sort of all medium conviction things, and certainly low conviction things, and you await the truly high conviction opportunities. And then the 10% of the time is spent truly optimizing those 10% and monetizing them with concentrated positions. And so what that leads to is that a lot of the time, we just sit here not doing a whole lot, looking for that 10%. And very early on, I had the view that the merge was going to be a very strong narrative at some point before it occurred, just because it was so powerful of a fundamental force for such a large asset in the space. And it was going to get so much sort of press that I could just see. And then this also goes back to sort of evaluating narratives, right? The idea of creating this, like, Internet bond, you can understand, is very digestible by mainstream media. So if you can sort of forecast this, goes back to that, like, okay, the merger is going to come, people are going to start talking about it.
00:19:24.702 - 00:19:28.390, Speaker D: And then all these mainstream media reporters.
00:19:28.422 - 00:20:09.374, Speaker E: That want to write about crypto are going to ask people, what's the best narrative to discuss? And this is such an easy one to understand and grab ahold of and write about. So if you can forecast those steps, then you can understand that that's a narrative that's going to initiate, and then it's also going to be quite sticky because it's going to be very understandable and attractive to a lot of different groups. We identified that quite early, and we were preparing for, once you see a narrative in the future, then you start spending a lot of time preparing for it. And we did that. We learned everything we could about the merge. We learned everything we formed as many connections as we could to try to get our best sense of the merge timing. We really researched all the different assets, trying to figure out which things we thought would benefit most from the merge.
00:20:09.374 - 00:20:32.604, Speaker E: It's not always just the obvious answer of ETH. Right. Liquid staking derivatives actually outperformed ETH a lot going into the merge. And so a lot of it is preparing the research on the narrative well in advance. And then it's trying to figure out how to time and position for it and when the right moment is and how you want to sort of monetize that narrative, which is not always a simple task.
00:20:33.544 - 00:20:54.604, Speaker A: It sounds like a large part of it is kind of trying to find things that the mainstream might find easy to understand as well. So I don't know if this is a simplistic conclusion, but I guess things like more complicated things like mev or like data availability, more technical topics, those are probably more unlikely to become actual narratives. Right? Is that the conclusion that I can take away from that?
00:20:55.044 - 00:21:10.984, Speaker E: So that's certainly. Yeah, that's certainly a factor. I mean, I think. I think that definitely. That definitely true. Like, the more complex they are, the harder it is for them to appeal to a broad audience. I also think that something that's really important is finding a narrative that actually is going to impact price.
00:21:11.364 - 00:21:14.572, Speaker D: Like, especially like anything that has the.
00:21:14.588 - 00:21:42.650, Speaker E: Ability to directly impact tokenomics is quite powerful. And that's why the merge was so appealing, because it's not just like Ethereum becomes more efficient, but it actually results in structural change in daily cell pressure. That's as direct as it gets. Yeah, I think it's both something that's simple and easy to understand, or at least can be dumped down to a point that is simple and easy to understand. And then also something that actually impacts price.
00:21:42.802 - 00:21:53.630, Speaker D: Like if it's this network is going to have a ten x like speed improvement in terms of, let's just say.
00:21:53.662 - 00:22:09.874, Speaker E: For example, some Alt L1 was going to have a ten x speed improvement in their transactions. It's like, yeah, that might marginally make it more attractive to use, but is that actually going to result in more people buying the token? Probably not. So that's probably a less powerful narrative in my opinion.
00:22:10.414 - 00:22:35.334, Speaker A: That's really interesting, and I'd love to double down on that a little bit because I think one of the ideas that you are very fond of is this idea of long ETH against bitcoin. And you've talked about this in previous interviews as well. So first, can you talk us through the thesis, especially when it comes to, as you mentioned, the structural supply and demand, like, what changed in bitcoin to warrant that trade for you.
00:22:36.434 - 00:22:38.394, Speaker E: We generally have that view, and we.
00:22:38.434 - 00:22:41.026, Speaker D: Will sort of ebb and flow the.
00:22:41.050 - 00:22:47.462, Speaker E: Sizing of it based off of the condition. But it's definitely our bias. And I think the core reason for.
00:22:47.478 - 00:22:53.710, Speaker D: The bias is that I care a lot about structural tokenomics and ETH.
00:22:53.742 - 00:23:14.796, Speaker E: Bitcoin just have very different structural tokenomics. ETH has net daily demand, bitcoin has net daily supply. It's really that simple. At current, ETH has about $5 million of buy flow and bitcoin has about $10 million of sell flow. And so every day, bitcoin needs to attract $15 million more of buyers, all else equal. Otherwise, e three DC goes up.
00:23:14.940 - 00:23:17.540, Speaker D: And that's really the crux of it.
00:23:17.572 - 00:23:24.304, Speaker E: There's a lot of other things on it. We could spend an entire hour talking about that, but I won't go too far in the weeds.
00:23:25.404 - 00:23:48.694, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I guess a lot of the devil's advocates would probably talk about maybe alternative l one s as competition for ETH, or maybe more of the activity moving on to L2s, which might disaggregate ETH as a valid layer. So I'm curious, like, what do you think about those? What is the risk case for this trade?
00:23:49.714 - 00:23:59.134, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, there are multiple risk cases for anything, right. I think on regards to the first point, I think ETH is pretty dominant in terms of its.
00:24:00.954 - 00:24:02.266, Speaker D: Position as the.
00:24:02.370 - 00:24:28.786, Speaker E: Number one l one in the space. And I think that's going to be really hard to compete with just due to the network effects. And building the decentralized network that they've built built is really quite difficult in terms of barrier to entry. But even more so than that, I mean, I actually think of ETH competing directly with bitcoin for the store value utility. I actually think bitcoin, I mean, ETH is a far better sov than bitcoin is. And I've written a lot about this. So just on that alone, I think the thesis makes sense.
00:24:28.930 - 00:24:36.646, Speaker D: And then in terms of the l two s, it's a very interesting question. Like, I do think some activity will.
00:24:36.670 - 00:25:00.774, Speaker E: Move to l two s from l one. However, I think there will always be sort of a base layer of activity on l one where if you really value the sort of security and convenience of it, especially at a floor level, if fees are quite low, then the added benefit of l two is reduced. There's sort of a floor on fees.
00:25:00.814 - 00:25:04.082, Speaker D: Where below this level, not so many.
00:25:04.098 - 00:25:21.506, Speaker E: People are going to bother going to l two because l one fees are cheap enough. And so that really keeps a floor on fees, which is all you really need for the e thesis is that floor. But then also I think a lot of the l two development will be sort of app specific l two development that doesn't exist on l one at all today because it's not practical at those fee levels and that's purely additive.
00:25:21.570 - 00:25:21.938, Speaker D: Right.
00:25:22.026 - 00:26:00.896, Speaker E: Like if you can develop a very high throughput gaming application on an l two, that's not cannibalizing l one activity that just doesn't exist on l one today. Yes, you're not going to add a ton of gas consumption because of that, because it's going to be on this efficient delta, but whatever you do add is just additive. And I think there's going to be a lot of those applications. So I think you are going to have this floor of gas consumption due to the fact that there's this base layer of activity that doesn't really want to move off of l one, especially at low prices. And then l two s will cannibalize some of other stuff which we've already seen. And by the way, ETH fees are at the highest level. They've been in quite a long time, despite l two activity being the highest it's been in a long time.
00:26:00.896 - 00:26:05.004, Speaker E: So it's not proving to have any correlation. It may actually be additive.
00:26:06.024 - 00:26:06.928, Speaker D: And then on top of that, I.
00:26:06.936 - 00:26:10.844, Speaker E: Think you're going to have a lot of app specific l two s that are actually purely additive.
00:26:11.384 - 00:26:29.120, Speaker A: And I guess just to add another data point to supplement that as well, yesterday we published a memo for our blockchain VIP newsletter and we found that I think 80%, up to 80% of the fees for transactions on l two s, both optimus and arbitrum, actually accrue to layer one instead of the actual roll up.
00:26:29.192 - 00:26:29.424, Speaker E: Right.
00:26:29.464 - 00:27:17.694, Speaker A: So even without, even if the applications are not purely additive, or like marginal, marginally additional applications, even now, they're already accruing more value to ETH, which I think really kind of supplements the thesis there for sure. And I'd love to talk about positioning a bit because you did mention that depending on the thesis and the timing of the same thesis, you might fluctuate on sizing a little bit. And I think people often joke that crypto funds only know how to be max short or max long with no in between. So. Yeah, and I think with this backdrop as well, a lot of people are talking about CPI and fed policy, and obviously none of us can really predict that consistently. So against this uncertain background, how do you even decide, how long should I be? Like, how short should I be? What is the difference between, like, a 25% long fund or a 50% long fund?
00:27:18.714 - 00:27:24.226, Speaker E: It's funny that you say that the expectation is the crypto funds are either max long or max short, because I'm.
00:27:24.410 - 00:27:26.014, Speaker D: The antithesis of that.
00:27:26.554 - 00:27:46.752, Speaker E: Our positioning is quite sticky. We tend not to move it around very much. We will flex, and I obviously put takes out on Twitter all the time about my market views, and I will flex our positions based off of those. But the flexes are quite small. And I'd say that positioning is something that it's not a constant.
00:27:46.808 - 00:27:47.048, Speaker D: Right.
00:27:47.096 - 00:27:59.204, Speaker E: How we run the book now is very different than how we ran it when I launched a little over a year ago. And that's constantly evolving as I learn and grow and sort of get a better feel and try to optimize things.
00:27:59.544 - 00:28:05.832, Speaker D: But generally we tend to operate. Our goal as a fund is that.
00:28:05.848 - 00:28:26.316, Speaker E: We will generally almost always be net long, and we seek to participate in less than 50% of the downside and down periods and greater than 50% of the upside and up periods. And so that really sets a 50% net benchmark. And we view that as our sort of neutral position, and then we'll flex above and below based off of our.
00:28:26.460 - 00:28:27.276, Speaker D: Sort of market views.
00:28:27.300 - 00:28:35.124, Speaker E: But it's, like I said, it's generally a small flex. I think there's more edge and this view, my views on these things change.
00:28:35.204 - 00:28:37.620, Speaker D: But I think for the most part.
00:28:37.772 - 00:29:10.608, Speaker E: Most of the time, I mean, there's different opportunities that arise. Like, for example, I think year end was a pretty obvious long period. Like pretty obvious long opportunity. And I was very vocal about that for really the entirety of December and especially the final week of the year. So that's a period where I think there is value and sort of alpha in the beta, like longing on D 31st. But generally, most of the time, I don't think there's a ton of value in picking a beta direction. I think there's more value in harvesting the alpha.
00:29:10.608 - 00:29:34.354, Speaker E: We try to make that a significant driver of our p and l and not have it just rely on the beta. And the way that we kind of do that is keeping that core position relatively sticky and only sort of expressing those macro views at extremes when we have high clinical views and even when we do in relatively small size.
00:29:35.014 - 00:29:55.284, Speaker A: That's quite interesting. And I'm curious, what is the, is there any scenario where you decide, hey, we should be completely long, the entire fund? Because what are the, I guess the checklist that you go through to tell yourself that, hey, this is the time to be fully bullish versus somewhat hedged, or 50% hedged?
00:29:56.304 - 00:30:10.364, Speaker E: There's certain things there. I mean, I don't talk about everything, but there's certain things that we look at. And I'd say also that's something that I, as an investor, need to improve on.
00:30:10.404 - 00:30:15.124, Speaker D: I think I was extremely high conviction.
00:30:15.164 - 00:30:24.596, Speaker E: That year end was a good buying opportunity, and we did buy. However, I think I could have given my view, I should have probably been even bigger than we were.
00:30:24.780 - 00:30:28.660, Speaker D: And so it's something that I still.
00:30:28.692 - 00:30:38.556, Speaker E: Work on all the time. But generally, what you look for, you look for. I mean, in simple terms, you look for a confluence. Everyone has different things that they look.
00:30:38.580 - 00:30:41.316, Speaker D: At, but what you look for is.
00:30:41.380 - 00:30:46.236, Speaker E: When all of those things align. And that doesn't happen all the time, but it does happen from time to time.
00:30:46.260 - 00:30:48.628, Speaker D: And when it does, that's when that's.
00:30:48.676 - 00:30:50.104, Speaker E: That'S when you have real signal.
00:30:50.964 - 00:31:10.800, Speaker A: That's interesting. I've always been really fascinated by the discussion of bet sizes because I know a lot of investors have their own frameworks for sizing bets. Some like fixed bet sizes, some like Kelly criterion, I personally look at, like, how much I'm willing to risk. So in terms of how you size bets, like, do you have a specific framework, or is it different for different types of bets?
00:31:10.832 - 00:31:34.034, Speaker E: Yeah, no, we have a framework, and yes, it's different for size times for different types of bets. I mean, I think we have sort of a benchmark that we use for different types of bets. And then based off of our conviction and what we view as the risk reward, will flex that higher or lower sort of discretionarily. We generally err on the side of caution. And I think size things smaller. And I think this surprises people sometimes.
00:31:34.074 - 00:31:40.138, Speaker D: Like, I'll have an idea that will be completely right, and they'll ask me.
00:31:40.146 - 00:31:41.242, Speaker E: Like, oh, how much did you make on that?
00:31:41.258 - 00:31:42.706, Speaker D: And they'll be like, oh, you didn't.
00:31:42.730 - 00:31:53.538, Speaker E: Even make that much money. And then I'll have a view that's completely wrong, and they'll be like, oh, you must be crushed. And it's like, oh, you actually didn't even lose that much money. And I think, you know, we generally err on the side of caution in.
00:31:53.546 - 00:31:56.598, Speaker D: Terms of sizing because we have a.
00:31:56.606 - 00:32:29.734, Speaker E: Very high confidence in our ability to be right more often than we're wrong, and therefore, we don't want any one bet to determine the outcome of the fund. So it's a fine line between sort of monetizing things appropriately, but also never putting yourself in risk of having material damage. I just call it that. There is so much alpha to just existing in this space. You never want to compromise that. I mean, that's definitely a core principle that we use a lot.
00:32:29.774 - 00:32:37.542, Speaker D: And so while that may lead to smaller returns on certain views that we.
00:32:37.558 - 00:32:48.954, Speaker E: Get right, it will also drastically increase the odds that we're around for a longer period of time, which is ultimately what I think is most important. And so that's generally how we think about it.
00:32:49.454 - 00:33:21.994, Speaker A: I think that's fascinating, because if we go back to one of our previous interviews with Galois Capital, where we talked about placing big bets in kind of one trade a year type of thing, that is a very, very different strategy. I guess there's many different roads to kind of the same outcome and just to kind of close out this part on the investment process. One question that I love asking investors, because I don't think a lot of people even think about it in crypto, is how do you decide when to exit something? Because there's no missed earnings to speak of. When do you even decide, hey, this narrative is over?
00:33:22.914 - 00:33:28.978, Speaker E: So there's two things I would say. We do also share the view of Galois capital, and I know, Kevin a.
00:33:28.986 - 00:33:29.734, Speaker D: Little bit.
00:33:31.714 - 00:33:49.206, Speaker E: In that we believe in concentrated bets. Fewer, more than sort of like many bets more often. But there's also a fine line where you want to be concentrated enough to monetize, but not concentrated. So not too concentrated to risk actually blowing up. So I think it's a matter of balancing those two things. I don't want to be.
00:33:49.370 - 00:33:51.030, Speaker D: I don't want to be unclear that.
00:33:51.102 - 00:33:55.902, Speaker E: We do also believe in that principle of concentrated bets. It's just a matter of sort of.
00:33:55.918 - 00:34:03.550, Speaker D: Like, balancing that with the idea of really sort of protecting tail risk as well.
00:34:03.662 - 00:34:05.314, Speaker E: And there is a middle ground there.
00:34:05.934 - 00:34:08.974, Speaker D: And then in terms of exiting, it's really.
00:34:09.054 - 00:34:21.003, Speaker E: That's really the art. I think exiting is much harder than entering, although both are sort of relevant. It requires discipline, it requires process, it requires planning, and it requires being extremely honest with yourself.
00:34:22.863 - 00:34:44.757, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think just to close this out here, I would love to get your thoughts on. I'll make it more open. So is there any one bet right now, either bullish or bearish or one vertical that you're quite excited about? It could be a specific asset, a specific theme or even a situation like the whole DCG situation right now, whatever direction you want, sure.
00:34:44.805 - 00:34:50.061, Speaker E: I mean, the thing that we've been most vocal on is the liquid staking derivative trade into withdrawals.
00:34:50.237 - 00:34:54.477, Speaker D: And that's one where we planned it well in advance.
00:34:54.645 - 00:35:18.164, Speaker E: Ever since the merge happened, I knew withdrawals were coming. I monitored it quite closely. I had the thesis about liquid staking derivatives being a beneficiary from many months ago. I knew that we were going to put this trade on and it was just a matter of monitoring it. And then year end was really that optimal time for a variety of reasons. That was like an example of the confluence where you had sort of macro sell off. It was the right time to event.
00:35:18.464 - 00:35:21.496, Speaker D: The individual names were getting sold, it.
00:35:21.520 - 00:35:22.800, Speaker E: Really kind of everything aligned.
00:35:22.872 - 00:35:24.936, Speaker D: And so we did take sort of.
00:35:24.960 - 00:35:27.016, Speaker E: Significant positions for us into that period.
00:35:27.200 - 00:35:28.124, Speaker D: And then.
00:35:29.864 - 00:35:31.472, Speaker E: How you think about that.
00:35:31.648 - 00:35:34.064, Speaker D: Evolving is really quite complex.
00:35:34.104 - 00:35:35.192, Speaker E: And I think it differs for all.
00:35:35.208 - 00:35:38.906, Speaker D: The different assets involved, because there are.
00:35:38.930 - 00:36:13.052, Speaker E: Certain assets that really only directly benefit after it's happened. And the actual technical forces of the increase in staking participation really have an impact. And then there are others that don't benefit as directly. And so it's different for different assets. And also it's somewhat hard. This is a thing with exiting is it's hard to forecast the right time in advance because it depends how the situation unfolds, it depends how the price action is in advance of the event as well. And so you can't actually give a.
00:36:13.068 - 00:36:16.460, Speaker D: Definitive answer so far away.
00:36:16.652 - 00:36:23.744, Speaker E: So what I'd say is it's certainly something that we think about, but I don't have a good answer as to a predetermined plan at this point.
00:36:24.364 - 00:36:46.714, Speaker A: Got it. I love that. Not giving too much of a game plan away. Well, I guess we'll see how this liquid staking trade evolves, because it is one of the hottest narratives right now. It's been really, really interesting to learn about your process, and I think our listeners really learned a lot from interviews like this.
