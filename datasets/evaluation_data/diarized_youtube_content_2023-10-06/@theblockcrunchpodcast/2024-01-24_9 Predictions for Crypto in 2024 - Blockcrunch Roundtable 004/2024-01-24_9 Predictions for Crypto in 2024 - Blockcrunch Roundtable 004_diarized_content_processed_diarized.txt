00:00:00.640 - 00:00:10.638, Speaker A: Like, if you want to see where the future is headed in crypto, you should pay attention to cosmos. It just doesn't happen on cosmos. Web Three offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:10.686 - 00:00:16.870, Speaker B: Our job is to buy great tech at great prices. AI is also libertarian right enable use case that people haven't been able to do today.
00:00:16.942 - 00:00:20.550, Speaker A: The next hundreds of millions of players, they will come to the market through mobile.
00:00:20.622 - 00:01:04.822, Speaker B: My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next twelve months is hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. I have with me here my trusty co host Sanat to host our end of year episode. So because it's the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, depending on when this gets released, we thought it would be interesting to do what everybody else is doing, which is market predictions for 2024. The caveat here is I actually hate predictions. I've never made any money from predicting because I'm horrible at predicting the future. All of my predictions are usually wrong, so do not make any financial decisions based on anything on this show, especially my predictions.
00:01:04.822 - 00:01:34.032, Speaker B: Maybe Sana's predictions as well. But anything on this show is not financial advice. But this is more of an intellectual exercise for us to think about. Okay, what could be coming next and what could be changing, but more importantly, what doesn't change cycle from cycle. But before we dive into it, I actually had a lot of trouble coming up with just like four or five random predictions. So I'm actually curious, like what you were preparing for yours. How did you go about deciding off the million things that could happen next year? Like how did you decide what you're going to cover?
00:01:34.168 - 00:02:02.342, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there were two, three that came to mind pretty immediately because they're just things that I've been thinking about. And I think there are themes that are kind of on my mind, like restaking is on my mind, dealers are on my mind. And so it was very natural to come up with predictions for those. And for another couple, I admittedly, like, spent a lot of time looking at people's previous predictions from years, from prior years and trying to see what's interesting and also diving into some parts of the industry like telegram bots, that I'm interested in but don't spend as much time thinking about.
00:02:02.438 - 00:02:17.638, Speaker B: Did you read any of the 2024 predictions made by other funds or investors? Because there were a lot of them. I was reading through Masari's one and they had like 200 pages worth of predictions from, I think, just Ryan alone and some of the analysts as well.
00:02:17.766 - 00:02:28.870, Speaker A: I did not read 200 pages of Masari's report. I haven't looked at any. I guess I watched. I watched the chopping block and they did some, but I think those are the only ones I've seen.
00:02:28.942 - 00:02:55.480, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm excited to dive into ours. So I deliberately wanted to focus on things that are equally liquid markets, because that's where a lot of our listeners seem to concern about, and then equally venture side, which is more on the kind of app development side. So I'm curious what yours would look like as well. But I can get started here. So my first prediction is that the ETH ETF will disappoint and the bitcoin one will be price dependent.
00:02:55.480 - 00:03:35.168, Speaker B: So this one I'm actually pretty high conviction on. So what I mean by this is I noticed that obviously this entire year has been characterized by the bitcoin ETF. Everybody's been talking about the bitcoin ETF. And it was actually a surprise in the depths of a bear market to see some of the biggest institutions of the fund of the world come in and say that, hey, we're going to launch a bitcoin ETF. So it seems like the market has priced that in throughout the entire year with bitcoin having its massive run. But I think it's important to remember that the steps it took to get here were very many. So I remember back in like 2017, 2018, when people talk about bitcoin, it was still considered like a cyberpunk and underground concept.
00:03:35.168 - 00:04:20.238, Speaker B: And very much the perception was that it's used to purchase drugs and weapons and so on. And even now, with Elizabeth Warren and in the mainstream media, a lot of perception around crypto is still kind of around this perception of crypto being kind of for illicit purposes. So it took many, many years to. To incept this idea of bitcoin being digital gold in the minds of institutional investors, to the point that tradfi guys are finally even remotely considering the possibility of allocating 1% to 5% of the portfolios to bitcoin. So that leads me to Ethereum. I think Ethereum is nowhere near the level of mind, share and acceptance in tradfi that bitcoin has. Or bitcoin has a very, very clear narrative, especially in times of macro uncertainty.
00:04:20.238 - 00:05:09.154, Speaker B: But this year, we saw so many macro projections from economists and investors about whether power will be cutting rates or raising rates, nobody knows. And in this uncertainty, people like to flock to kind of uncorrelated assets. And gold was something that a lot of people were talking about earlier this year. And then digital gold is a pretty easy narrative to sell, especially after price has run. So I do think that if price continues to perform well, I do think the bitcoin ETF can convert some of the skeptics that are on defense. So I saw this tweet last night as I was preparing for this, which is a perspective from bear parents about a $15 billion fund advisor. So the TL doctor here is that they are considering the benefit of a 5% allocation to bitcoin to clients portfolios, which I think is massive.
00:05:09.154 - 00:05:39.946, Speaker B: Right? If you think about 2019, when Pompliano was talking about institutions are coming, it was like, let's get off zero, let's get to 1%. And that was already a big push. The fact that big guys are thinking about 5%, I think, is a huge step. But I don't think ETH is there at all. So I think if there is an ETH ETF, the flows would disappoint. It's going to take many years for tradfi to get comfortable with Ethereum, and that will actually lead into one of my later predictions as well. But first of all, I'm curious, like, whether you have any thoughts on this.
00:05:39.946 - 00:05:45.818, Speaker B: Are you expecting an EtHTF, first of all, and in your circles, is there any interest in something like this?
00:05:45.906 - 00:06:32.538, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we get an ETH eTF. I kind of made a prediction two years ago when ETH was kind of firing on all fronts with its roadmap was trying to transitioning to ETH 2.0. It felt like I was convinced that ETH BTC was only going to go in favor of ETH for a long time. It hasn't really happened. I'm curious whether you think some of the kind of easier narratives for ETH, like digital supercomputer. And I remember at some point, Kyle Samani had written this really interesting thread about kind of money crypto versus tech crypto and believing that tech crypto would be a lot better. So I'm curious whether you think those narratives still have a lot of potential for ETH or do you think it's just the bitcoin digital gold thing and they won't spend time getting to know and understand Ethan? Because I personally think ETH is great money as well.
00:06:32.626 - 00:06:45.442, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, in long term, I do hope that's the case. Because if it's not, then I think you and I are both screwed. Right. If there's no one adopting the web3 side of crypto. But in the short term, I just think it's really, really hard to sell trendfi. Right.
00:06:45.442 - 00:07:07.810, Speaker B: Especially now. Right. I think even last cycle it was easier to understand cause ETH was just ETH. There's no L2s yet. Now you're kind of. This will lead to one of my later predictions as well, but you're kind of confusing the value proposition of ETH as an asset, not ethereum as an ecosystem, but ETH as an asset, because now you have execution layers and L2. Now you're disaggregating and then pulling out the DA layer into Celestia and Eigen as well.
00:07:07.810 - 00:07:46.026, Speaker B: So it makes it more confusing for people to understand what ETH actually is, which means it's probably going to take even longer. And in my mind, I was tweeting about this a few months ago. I think bitcoin is very much a macro asset. It's very easy to understand, whereas ETH and the rest of crypto is a tech bet. So in kind of risk loving environments, I expect investors to buy into the dream of web3 and, you know, maybe participate in the upside for ETH and web3 assets. But in uncertain macro environments, I think bitcoin is likely to outperform. But the fact that in this risk rally of all the risk assets the past year, ETH has not outperformed, that's actually more concerning to me.
00:07:46.026 - 00:08:07.410, Speaker B: It means that there's not even that much demand for ETH within crypto, let alone outside of crypto. So who knows? This could be a bottom cycle. Maybe ETH just starts, you know, rallying from here. But I've heard enough people say that I've been a bottom signal for the past month. As you know, ETH continues to go down like 1020 percent against bitcoin. That I don't really. It doesn't really change my mind.
00:08:07.410 - 00:08:17.706, Speaker B: I think that's actually a great segue to your prediction, because you wanted to talk about something that I'm quite excited about as well, which is restaking an eigen layer. Do you want to jump into that?
00:08:17.770 - 00:09:03.240, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess my prediction here is that 10% of all ethnicity is restaked via Eigen layer. To remind people, I believe currently 23% ish of ETH is staked. And so this would imply that almost half of ETH staking is also either staking goes up a lot, or almost half of the ETH that's being staked today gets ended, ends up being used for restaking. I don't know if we've discussed restaking previously. There's a big protocol called Eigen layer that essentially allows individuals to restake their ETH, where that ETH is used to provide security to new middleware and crypto services that aren't built on Ethereum. And those validators essentially agreed to get slashed to have that Ethereum slashed for providing security to that network. It kind of turns Ethereum primarily into a security asset almost.
00:09:03.240 - 00:09:54.020, Speaker A: So this has been a big theme this year already. I think the Eigen layer smart contract has almost a billion dollars in TVL already, even though it's really just a gigantic airdrop farm at the moment. But I've been hugely impressed with Eigen layer's ability to kind of attract really high quality infrastructure products. So you have people like espresso systems who have chosen to use Eigen layer for security, which I think is a huge kind of confidence vote for the ecosystem. And more generally, I think, and this ties into something you were mentioning, I think Ethereum is kind of cementing its place as great collateral high security, an excellent DA layer. And Eigen layer fits perfectly within those themes. And I think generally people will want to generate yield from their ethereum.
00:09:54.020 - 00:10:02.380, Speaker A: This list of infrastructure product projects will provide some amount of their tokens, and that's going to make Eigen layer be bigger than most people think it is.
00:10:02.452 - 00:10:50.836, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think the concept of restaking is quite interesting, and one of my predictions does include something like this as well, which we'll get into. But I'm curious, like what you think of the risk side, because every time I bring up the concept of restaking, which is this idea of allowing people to, as you mentioned, stake their ETH to validate for the ETH network, but also use that same ETH that they've staked to provide security for maybe a bunch of different applications. That idea of like, re hypothecating reminds people a lot of just like, leverage. And it seems like if you get slashed in one project, you get slashed all throughout, and people just get freaked out by this concept. So what are your thoughts there? Like, is this something that people can get over, like they got over with Lido initially, or is this something that is just going to be reserved for the more risk loving corners of crypto?
00:10:51.020 - 00:11:17.520, Speaker A: Interestingly, I think that it is hugely risky. And so in general, the notion of trying to run almost a new consensus layer on Ethereum's execution layer is risky. And I think maybe another side of this prediction is someone is going to lose a lot of ETH through eigenvector. I think there'll be kind of some AV's that has some slashing condition that no one has properly understood. Suddenly a bunch of ETH gets slashed via that you were restaking for some other network. Everyone is confused. I think this happens.
00:11:17.520 - 00:11:41.720, Speaker A: But the honest answer is, and this is true of most security risks, people only care about them once bad things happen. And for the moment, I think Eigen layer train feels like it's left the station. So I think it's going to accumulate a ton of TVL. I think it will have some security concerns and at least one AV's will blow up. Hopefully it's not one of the bigger ones. Hopefully it's not existential for Eigen layer. But basically my prediction is that the train has left the station.
00:11:41.720 - 00:11:47.456, Speaker A: So a lot of money is going to come into this ecosystem, but it remains a huge security risk for sure.
00:11:47.600 - 00:11:55.840, Speaker B: And you mentioned Espresso as well, so can you explain to our listeners what espresso does? And you mentioned this point about ETH alignment, I think in our notes as well.
00:11:55.912 - 00:12:53.488, Speaker A: So I'll talk separately about both. Espresso is essentially a shared sequencer. And so for those who are somewhat familiar with how rollups work, one part of what rollups do is essentially take transactions and order them and kind of create a block that can then be posted to a base layer. And Espresso is essentially a network, a crypto network that allows multiple roll ups to share the same sequencer, which allows them to kind of get one, not have to build their own sequencer technology, prevents them from some, from running into some regulatory issues about centralization, and also allows kind of better interoperability between rollups that live on the same shared sequencer. Espresso systems, which is probably currently the market leader in shared sequencing, uses Eigen layer for security. And that's kind of, again, as they said, they kind of want as many of Ethereum's l one validators to be validating espresso as well. And more generally, you're seeing that as execution has moved off of Ethereum's base layer.
00:12:53.488 - 00:13:36.250, Speaker A: There's a number of projects that kind of want to continue to be Ethereum aligned in some fashion and show that they're kind of contributing to Ethereum or part of the ecosystem or benefiting from its liquidity without actually being a smart contract that lives on Ethereum. And Eigen layer is kind of the easiest way to do that. You get to say, hey, look, I'm Ethereum aligned. My network is secured by Ethereum, the asset. Ethereum validators, a subset of Ethereum validators are also securing my network. I think it's a little bullshitty because you don't necessarily inherit all aspects of Ethereum security, but really a theme these days is that Ethereum is more of a distribution strategy than it is a tech platform. People continue to just be like, I'm involved with Ethereum in some way.
00:13:36.250 - 00:13:56.050, Speaker A: My roll up may send, may use something else for DA, but we're still an ETH roll up. And so in this way, I think using Eigen layer for security allows you to claim ETH alignment and benefit from Ethereum liquidity. And I think that's kind of going to be increasingly important as execution stops happening on Ethereum mainnet.
00:13:56.122 - 00:14:48.620, Speaker B: This actually reminds me a lot of the discussion on Cosmos as well, which is a lot of people use. There's a lot of discussion around using Cosmos hub as like the primary security, shared security layer. And you know, a lot of people want to be swear their allegiance to like the cosmos hub. But then it looks like a lot of the IBC, most of the IBC transactions were processed by osmosis as well. So there a lot led to a lot of this kind of infighting, which I think is quite curious because Cosmos was already on this chain a few years ago, and then Ethereum is kind of discovering, rediscovering this. So on the back of your prediction, I think this is similar to mine, which is my second prediction is I think one of the biggest driver of new products and innovation will once again be yield. So just to give us a bit of context, when I think about predictions, I not just think, I don't just think about things that will change, because that's very hard to predict.
00:14:48.620 - 00:15:28.896, Speaker B: But I try to think about what won't change from cycle to cycle. And one thing that I think won't change is people will always love yield, especially crypto natives. They don't even care about risk adjusted yield, they just want yield. So there's a lot of new ways to construct relatively more sustainable yield now that Ethereum has transitioned to proof of stake since the last cycle. So I think one example of this, which we've talked about multiple times, which is a shared portfolio companies of ours, is Athena. So we mentioned, we described Athena before. But for those of you who are not aware, this is basically where you stake ETH and mint a liquid stake ETH, use the liquid state ETH as collateral, and you post it with the custody and the custody.
00:15:28.896 - 00:16:02.552, Speaker B: The custody then helps you open a short position to hedge out that ETH position. So effectively you print a stake coin that gives you the e staking yield plus the short funding rate for, you know, shorting the ethereum perpetual. So that is currently offering, I think, like 20% to 30% yield or so, just off of market forces alone. Off the first, I think, month of this guarded launch, they've already minted $60 million in TVL. So I think that's. So for people who are watching this video, you can see the chart here. I think right now the live number is also around 60 million.
00:16:02.552 - 00:16:50.510, Speaker B: I think that is, you know, one of the examples of how people can creatively manufacture an anchor type yield in a market in a way that's driven by market forces and not artificial inflation. So another example of this is actually just through restaking. So one of the projects that we backed that just announced a recent round was real network. So they are effectively creating liquid staking derivatives for liquid restaked ETH. So if you imagine Lido as a liquid staked ETH, that offers you a liquidity plus a percentage of the staking yield from ETH. So restaked ETH will offer you a percentage of the yield that you earn from restaking for all the different types of applications. So, as you mentioned, there is risks that there are risks with this.
00:16:50.510 - 00:17:44.126, Speaker B: And I think a lot of it comes down to auditing the projects and selecting the projects that they choose to re hypothecate and validate for. But then, you know, I think it's those things that can give you a step function improvement in terms of yield. So that takes you from like four or 5% native Ethereum yield to maybe like 10% to what we see on Athena, like 20, 30% yield. I think those are massive, massive drivers of adoption and usage. The big question for me here is, like, how scalable is this? Can we get to like a Ust level? Like, can we get to $60 billion? Or does this top out at like $10 billion? I think that remains to be seen. But I do think that off the back of that, some ideas is, I think, you know, if eigen layer lists, I think it trades higher than Celestia right away, but I'm often wrong about these things. Have you seen any products that are on this train in terms of passing yield to end users?
00:17:44.310 - 00:18:31.460, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Eigen layer is definitely one, but I think broadly, and Athena is probably a really exciting name in this category, along with another couple of companies that haven't emerged out of stealth yet. But I think the notion of stablecoin yield being shared back with participants is going to happen one way or another. And so I think Athena is a big enabler of that. But more generally, tether and circle have these extraordinarily lucrative business models where they essentially just, you give them money, they keep the yield, they give you kind of a stable coin in return. I think their market power kind of has reached a zenith and is going to start falling at some point and someone's going to come in and return yield to users. And that's kind of a big shift that I think will happen in the stablecoin ecosystem over the next few years.
00:18:31.532 - 00:18:36.116, Speaker B: So do you think tether will actually start passing through the yield back to USDT holders?
00:18:36.220 - 00:19:00.050, Speaker A: I think someone will just beat them by doing that and they will struggle because their business isnt set up to do that. And in theory, of course they could. And I know circle does do some institutional agreements with certain participants in the ecosystem, but more generally, I do think tethers business model will kind of get disrupted. Whether tether is able to disrupt itself, I actually find that unlikely.
00:19:00.122 - 00:19:27.970, Speaker B: Yeah, because it really makes no sense for them. They're basically like running a bank and not offering any kind of fixed deposits for users, right. So I think number here, I'm just pulling it out from Forbes. I don't know how reliable this is, but they made like $1.5 billion in profit in one quarter, just from the yield of their deposits alone. So at some point, I do believe some of this needs to pass back to users. I think USDC already started doing something like this on Coinbase for their users.
00:19:27.970 - 00:20:00.588, Speaker B: I'm sure you've seen a few of these projects when you're kind of sourcing for deals as well. There are a lot of projects this past twelve months that promises to create a stablecoin that passes treasury yield back to users. I passed on all of them because I couldn't get comfortable with the banking side of things. I think it's very much a trade as well to leverage the high yields right now. But some version of passing yield to end users make a lot of sense to me, especially as there are more alternatives now. There's more competition with things like Athena now. But let's move on to the next prediction.
00:20:00.588 - 00:20:02.100, Speaker B: What do you have next on your list?
00:20:02.212 - 00:20:54.490, Speaker A: Yeah, next on my list is a roll up related prediction, which is that I think rollups are going to spend more than $300 million posting DA to Ethereum this year. The end of the year has been thematically very Solana centric, but for me, one of the broad takeaways of 2023 has just been the immense success of rollups. I think arbitrum and optimism have had excellent years. Increasingly we're seeing more and more developers gravitate towards either deploying their applications on arbitrum optimism or other successful Ethereum roll ups, or building their own roll up in the ethereum ecosystem, as chains like Zora and Evo have done. And I think we see the strength continue. Roll ups have proven themselves to be a great scaling solution. While Ethereum DA continues to be very expensive, I think it continues to be the best deal here and has strong enough distribution effect that it's going to be hard to disrupt.
00:20:54.490 - 00:21:44.902, Speaker A: So rollups already spent, I believe, upwards of $110 million posting DA to Ethereum this year. That has accelerated significantly in November and December. I think December itself has already had $28 million, which is essentially a function of the fact that the chain is busy again and gas costs are going up. I think Ethereum will ship EIP 4844 this year, which is essentially a separate market for rollups to post DA, which should mitigate some of kind of the high fees on rollups. But I generally think like demand for DA from Ethereum continues to increase as kind of users gravitate towards rollups as rollups like zksync, Linnea scroll kind of see more adoption and more users. And so I think demand for kind of deer and ethereum will continue to outplay supply. Rollups will spend, like I said, I think $300 million this year posting DA to Ethereum.
00:21:44.902 - 00:22:17.964, Speaker A: I actually think, weirdly enough, this is also bullish for all DA layers. So I think some roll ups will decide that the cost of posting DA to Ethereum is too high, particularly those that find it hard to pass it on to users, like maybe a gaming chain. And so collectively, I also think that there'll be at least five roll ups that kind of have TVL, have users that are using celestia or avail or eigenvalue. But I basically think 2023 was the year when rollups really started to gain a ton of traction, and I think we kind of continue to see that accelerate next year.
00:22:18.124 - 00:22:29.940, Speaker B: How much cheaper is it to post DA to post DA data on celestial eigen da or veil versus just posting on l one ethereum? Is it like a ten x type of improvement?
00:22:30.012 - 00:22:48.146, Speaker A: Yeah, at a minimum it can actually range from much more than that. It can be like between one and two orders of magnitude. So there are kind of DA solutions that are definitely less secure, but that kind of use off chain committees that can be 50 x to 100 x cheaper. But even in the base case, something like celestial is definitely at least an order of magnitude cheaper.
00:22:48.250 - 00:23:09.422, Speaker B: And I'm looking at the chart here, right. And for people who are watching this in video, you can see the publishing transaction, the cost of publishing transaction data to l one from these different roll ups. Like if you ask me to name the roll ups are expanding the most. I probably would it not have guessed. It's, I think it's here. It's linear, I guess. Yeah, I would have guessed arbitrum, but I wouldn't have guessed linea.
00:23:09.422 - 00:23:22.822, Speaker B: And kind of scroll is kind of up there as well, $1.8 million. So this is all just recent as well, from November to December. Is this just a reflection of degens coming back to use like l two s and much more stuff happening on l two s?
00:23:22.918 - 00:23:41.744, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's a function of that as well as a function of, um, just gas prices on chain being higher. And because right now we don't have a separate market for Da roll ups, just compete with regular transactions and people are trading again, people are on chain again, gas prices are up. Um, and that reflects both on Ethereum and on roll ups themselves.
00:23:41.864 - 00:24:26.980, Speaker B: Yeah, I actually feel like this is a supportive argument for alternative l one s as well. Like if the cost continues to climb, um, because one thing that doesn't change cycle to cycle is like, no one likes to pay more to do the same things they could do on another cheaper chain. So I'm curious what this implies for chains like Solana or like any low fee kind of high, high throughput chains. We saw a lot of interest in, say, recently, which is a portfolio of ours as well. But I'm really curious on what your take is on my next prediction. But before that, I need to visit the last prediction because I actually forgot to talk about what the prediction was. My prediction specifically for yield as a driver of new innovation, is that yield related products is going to bring $100 billion, is going to make total tvl above $100 billion.
00:24:26.980 - 00:25:12.886, Speaker B: So I should slap a specific number on it. So there's a way to prove that if I was right or wrong. But then moving on to the next prediction, which is what I'm curious about your thoughts on, is the unbundling of ETH. So right now I think ETH is in a very different place than where it was last cycle before the rise of l one's, l two s, and da layers. I think now the ETH value prop is very much changed and it's almost like we're unbundling ETH into like a modular stack, which is very much the intention for the modular thesis. So now we have execution layers on arbitrum, optimism, linear, all these, like l two s and base. And then we also have Da layers that are pulled away from Ethereum, layer one as well.
00:25:12.886 - 00:26:23.054, Speaker B: So into its separate kind of layer with its separate token. So I want to talk about the unbundling of ETH, which is this idea that ETH as a value accrual layer is being disaggregated. So last cycle we have ETH as an l one, very much like a monolithic type of architecture. Even though the intention was to have, was to have L2s, most of the application, most of the activity was very much happening on layer one, whereas now we have actual applications built in, thriving L2 ecosystems. And we even have DA layers being pulled away from Ethereum into its own value accrual layer with its own value accrual token, most notably celestia, which is valid at multiple billion dollars now. So my prediction is that the aggregate valuation of all the disaggregated pieces of Ethereum will exceed Ethereum eventually, maybe not this year, but the volume that happens on l two s will exceed the volume that happens in l one this year. So right now, what the number roughly looks like, if we go on defi llama here, for those of you watching this on video for Ethereum, I think the seven day or the one day volume right now is around a billion dollars.
00:26:23.054 - 00:27:07.742, Speaker B: So 1.28. Right now, if you combine arbitrum, which is about 700, call it 600 to 700 million, and optimism right now, which is about 100 million, you combine them, that's about half of Ethereum's daily volume right now. I do think that this will double, especially if you introduce other l two s as well, to more than that of Ethereum. And the reason why I think this is going back to my point about what won't change from cycle to cycle, I think people will always prefer lower fees. So before you were constrained by choice, there weren't too many things happening on l two. Most of the interesting applications are still very much on l one. But I think now that we have these kind of more or less mature ecosystems on l two, there will be more applications being built on them.
00:27:07.742 - 00:27:50.436, Speaker B: And people would prefer to do things in a cheaper way than a more expensive way if they have a choice. So they would drive utility to l two. So what does that mean for ETH as an asset? I think that continues to feed into my first prediction, which is the lackluster performance of an ETH etf, because now to properly express a bullish ethereum stance, you have to own l two s, you have to own Da layers in order to have full exposure versus something like a Solana. If you're bullish in Solana, just buy like Sol. So I think that adds to the confusion of how ETH accrues value. But I know you probably have some strong thoughts here, given that I think you're quite bullish on ETH, but you also have a very strong view on rollups. So, curious what you think about that idea of kind of unbundling of ETH.
00:27:50.620 - 00:28:35.590, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, like I said, ethereum is kind of turning into an asset, something that sells security and a DA layer, but really is no longer an execution layer. And I think it is tricky. It's hard to figure out who has network effects in this ecosystem. What should roll ups be worth as a percentage of Ethereum is an open question. Do they struggle in the way that there's a world where they struggle in the way that defi apps on Ethereum have always struggled, where Aave compound, uniswap maker, all of them have been pretty big successes, but their asset prices have always underperformed Ethereum. I could see something like that happening for rollups. I just think that Ethereum will kind of successfully navigate some part of this transition is kind of what I think.
00:28:35.590 - 00:29:29.502, Speaker A: I think it's understood that rollups are the way they scale, compute. I think it remains like pristine collateral, and I think the fact that it kind of has good economics. Validators are paid by fees, which is true of almost no other crypto asset. And the fact that validators are generally willing to accept a lower yield if it's paid in Ethereum versus it being paid in, for example, some cosmos shit coin. So I think Ethereum has a lot of traction around it if people continue to transact widely using Ethereum, the asset, on optimism and arbitrum. And so while I understand that the narrative can get a little confusing and modularity feels like a little bit of a meme, I think Ethereum has generally, like, always been one step ahead of the game of understanding how scaling will happen. And I think its role as like, a key asset in this ecosystem will matter.
00:29:29.502 - 00:30:00.912, Speaker A: And I think something like Eigen layer actually allows it to, like, truly realize the potential of just like, this is a $250 billion asset and you can use it to provide security in a way that it has no competition there. Like, I think, for example, if you tried to do restaking on any other asset, it would be like a comical notion, almost like that, outside of bitcoin, which makes it challenging to build this stuff. And so I think with restaking as a delayer and as pristine collateral, Ethereum generally continues to succeed, is my view.
00:30:01.008 - 00:30:31.830, Speaker B: It's kind of off topic, given that this year there is this BRC 20 wave. I'm curious what your take is on this, because if there is one asset that should be considered, like, clean collateral, or just like, secure collateral is probably the most liquid, you know, the most valuable asset, which in this case is bitcoin. I don't know how much time you spend looking into this development on top of bitcoin, all these inscriptions and stuff, but do you think that challenges ETH's narrative as like, the programmable money?
00:30:32.022 - 00:30:52.592, Speaker A: In short, no, because bitcoin remains not programmable. I think from at least a little. I understand, I have a lot of respect for the stacks team, but I don't think they've gained a lot of traction or liquidity. I think the development experience still sucks. There aren't great ways for bitcoin to kind of. There aren't great ways to build on bitcoin. And I don't think that has really changed.
00:30:52.592 - 00:31:30.178, Speaker A: People have tried to do a whole bunch of stuff with kind of. I know the taproot wizards and a whole bunch of other stuff, but I think the dev experience still kind of sucks. We don't see, like, the smartest developers coming and saying they're building things on bitcoin so broadly. I think Ethereum continues to remain programmable money in a way that bitcoin does not. One project that I would keep my eyes on is Babylon. It started by a super, super smart team, and they are essentially building eigen layer for bitcoin. And I think that idea makes some sense, because from first principles, Eigen layer essentially just utilizes the fact that Ethereum has this excellent, valid dataset and has a huge market cap, which makes it hard to attack.
00:31:30.178 - 00:32:00.616, Speaker A: And bitcoin has some of those features as well. And so the locking and programmability is going to be a little bit of a. The locking of bitcoin and the programmability of the chain is going to be a little bit of a challenge for Babylon. But I think that project could attract a fair amount of TVL. And the truth is that in market cap security terms, like most cosmos chains, for example, don't even have a billion dollar TVL now. Whereas, like, attracting a billion dollars of TVL to a restaking protocol for bitcoin is not a crazy idea. That's just not a lot of bitcoin.
00:32:00.616 - 00:32:07.524, Speaker A: And so I think there are, like, some exciting things happening in the bitcoin ecosystem. But overall, I'm not excited by it.
00:32:07.644 - 00:32:14.124, Speaker B: I think we've mentioned Cosmos a few times already. I don't know if you want to touch on this prediction of yours that has to do with cosmos, too.
00:32:14.204 - 00:32:38.174, Speaker A: I can. I'm happy to. My prediction is basically that cosmos remains a bit shit. And so I think you hinted at this earlier, and I'm someone who's always been fascinated by Cosmos because I think it's, like, intellectually very fertile. They come up with ideas before anyone else does. They came up with this notion of app chains four or five years ago. Everyone in Ethereum is all in on roll ups.
00:32:38.174 - 00:33:08.372, Speaker A: They came up with a notion of shared security. Everyone on Ethereum is all in on restaking. And so if you want to see where the future is headed in crypto, you should pay attention to cosmos. It just doesn't happen on Cosmos. And so, broadly, I think, for example, osmosis monthly trading volume is lower than Uniswap's daily trading volume. And I kind of don't see a whole lot of catalysts for that to change. And so I know people are excited about celestia.
00:33:08.372 - 00:33:36.472, Speaker A: People are excited about the launch of USDC via noble. People are excited about neutron. People are excited about DYDX. I think DYDX sees some success. But generally, I think cosmos continues to kind of struggle. I think the recent kind of political debate with forking atom is not great, even though people are excited that they'll now have two tokens. And I think with the struggle to kind of the struggle to attract liquidity, the struggle for go to market just continues to persist.
00:33:36.472 - 00:33:56.876, Speaker A: I think users don't come here. Osmosis has just a pathetic amount of TVL relative to chains like optimism and arbitrum. And so I haven't seen enough. That gets me excited to think that Cosmos is really going to have its major rekindling. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe neutron and osmosis collectively attract a bunch of TVL. I think DyDX probably does okay.
00:33:56.876 - 00:34:19.730, Speaker A: Some Cosmos SDK chains, including someone like Seimei, may do all right as well. But generally, I think the IBC Cosmos osmosis ecosystem just continues to underperform and continues to fail to attract liquidity. And it makes me really sad, actually. Like, I think there are some excellent teams building really cool stuff, but they just have not figured out how to get liquidity onto their platforms.
00:34:19.812 - 00:34:42.134, Speaker B: If you think about the most valuable applications, not just l one. S, right. Applications like Luna was one of them. One of them, I think the most valuable application at that time, at the height of the power, and they were a cosmos chain. I think the problem with cosmos is that the problem is also in inherent is this design, which is this idea of, like, chain sovereignty. Right. They want all the app chains to have complete sovereignty.
00:34:42.134 - 00:35:11.602, Speaker B: You can run your own consensus, you can do whatever you could use shared security from the cosmos hub to bootstrap your security before you spin away your own validator set. But it is very much intended to be a ecosystem or a constellation of sovereign chains. And as such, there is no one shelling point for you to accrue value. And I think they kind of realized that when Luna took off. But then it didn't really benefit Adam, at least not directly. It didn't benefit cosmos. Besides the fact that maybe more people are using the.
00:35:11.602 - 00:35:45.714, Speaker B: Actually, that's not even true. I was going to say more people are using Kepler wallet because of Luna, and that's why more people will be onboarded onto the primary wallet in cosmos. But if I remember correctly, Luna wasn't even supported on Kepler, so it didn't even benefit cosmos all that much. So I think maybe part of that phenomenon prompted some of the discussion around atom 2.0, which is this idea of really accruing value back to the atom token, really trying to create this big shared security hub. But then that didn't really take off. That was kind of struck down, I think, by just bureaucracy.
00:35:45.714 - 00:36:36.066, Speaker B: So I think what you said about if you want to see the future of crypto, look to cosmosis not going to happen, because, you know, on Cosmos, I think that's, like, a great point. And, yeah, I think I probably agree with this one as well. It's just interesting that every few months, you suddenly get a massive run on all the cosmos coins. And then, obviously, recently, people are very excited about injective and, you know, to a certain extent, osmosis as well. I actually wonder if the launch of liquid staking will be, you know, a step function improvement for the cosmos ecosystem. Because one big problem with cosmos is that a lot of the app chains have incredibly high inflation, which means incredibly high yield. And as I mentioned before, people just love yielding crypto, right? So a lot of these networks are, like, 60, 70% staked, which means liquidity is incredibly thin even for the blue chip assets, because everyone is staked.
00:36:36.066 - 00:37:14.146, Speaker B: Nobody's, like, trading these on a liquid basis. So with the launch of things like Stride, I wonder if this would help with liquidity and ecosystem, maybe kickstart some sort of a positive feedback loop. Especially because, as you said, I think there's a lot of incredibly bright people in the cosmos ecosystem. It's just that they don't seem to have remotely the same distribution as even some of the newer kind of l one ecosystems. On that note, I think one prediction, this is kind of like a low effort prediction, to be quite honest. But I'm quite high conviction about this, which is I think the top quartile infra projects will still beat the top quartile applications. So this might be surprising to some because I always talk about application.
00:37:14.146 - 00:38:09.384, Speaker B: I love investing in applications as an angel, because I want people to come to crypto to use things and not just speculate on maybe people will use some things on top of these l one s. But every single cycle I look back on since 2017, the infrastructures are still the ones that perform the best, in a. In a financial sense at least, you know, in an aggregate. And I think that's because it's easier for people to underwrite these things at much higher valuation, so they're more willing to pull forward the valuations of these things. So even this year, if you look at the best performing assets year to date, right, if you segment it by liquidity. So these are on Masari, the top assets that are trading about 100 million to a billion dollars a day. So some of the most liquid assets you look at the year to date performance, it's still, by and large, infrastructure projects, right? So you have stacks, you have avalanche of optimism.
00:38:09.384 - 00:38:45.458, Speaker B: Mina near Aptos. So you kind of fully expect to at least have half of this list, or more than half of this list be l one s. And even the ones that are not l one s are, you know, by and large, infrastructure projects, right? So render is like pretty much an infrastructure project injective. They turn from a, you know, a perp Dex to its own defi chain as well. So for me, it's kind of hard to see what will need to change for the market to re rate applications as a sector. I think we can have breakout wins, like with Axie, with Luna. So individual applications beating all of the l one s.
00:38:45.458 - 00:38:54.970, Speaker B: But if you take the top quartile performance, it's very hard for me to see applications just outperforming. Do you feel differently there, or is this just going to be more of the same every cycle?
00:38:55.002 - 00:39:17.834, Speaker A: Again, no, it feels like it may be more of the same. Honestly, I can't figure out why either. I think at some level, as a crypto investor, if you try and do any math on infrastructure valuations, you'll just end up pulling your head out. It's like Celestial is being used currently. Celestial is a really cool project. I think they have, like, a couple of roll ups using it at best. None with a whole lot of users.
00:39:17.834 - 00:40:02.016, Speaker A: There are some people throwing inscriptions on there, but it trades at, like a $10 billion plus valuation, at least as of last week. And there's no math that can make this make sense. Like, there's no fee multiple, there's no notion of, like, I think you just kind of have to feel comfortable as a crypto investor, you do kind of have to just be like, when people use crypto infra, it's worth a lot. Without thinking of any notion of valuation or fees. Even an oracle like pith, which, again, great team, great product being used pretty widely, makes, like, no fees, essentially, like, launched on the market at a multi billion dollar valuation. And so, yeah, I've always wondered what it'll take for this to change, what it will take for some amount of investing discipline around infrastructure to happen. It's been a little bit of a mystery to me, for sure.
00:40:02.016 - 00:40:22.506, Speaker A: I don't see a huge catalyst for it shifting anytime soon, particularly given the strength of infrastructure valuations that have launched in the last quarter, like Port Celestia, with even something like Jito, which is kind of an application kind of infrastructure, but they've got attracted, like, such massive valuations that I feel like we're in for more of the same this cycle.
00:40:22.610 - 00:40:58.974, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like you said, I think these l ones are not just infra, they're like distribution channels. Right. If you think about the product cycles in crypto, it's like infrastructure drives application. So when Solana first launched, it was around for a while, nobody cared. And then FTX kind of enshrined it as, like, the fastest chain, and we're going to build all this serum stuff on top. And then all these applications started piling in, because now they have a critical mass of users that came to test out, like serum. So to a certain extent, you kind of need something to kick off, you know, adoption on a chain, and then once people get used to the wallet, get used to using the chain, the chain itself becomes a distribution channel.
00:40:58.974 - 00:41:28.624, Speaker B: So in that sense, I think it's. It's kind of application bet as well. Like, if you don't know which application to pick on, top of a chain, you probably can just buy the chain. So I can see why it's like a little bit of the best of both worlds, and why people tend to congregate to those every single cycle. But that's interesting to me because one of your predictions has to do with applications. It's very specific type of applications, which is telegram bots, which wasn't really a thing until I think, like this past year. You want to talk about that a bit?
00:41:28.734 - 00:42:00.914, Speaker A: Yeah. This ties into a broader thesis, which I think happened this year, which I think mattered a lot this year, with seeing Uniswap's front end monetization. So I don't know if everyone's aware, but Uniswap started charging a 15 basis point fee on transactions that happen through its front end that accrue directly to Uniswap labs. I think in general, front ends in crypto have shown themselves to have value captured. And so this is true of the uniswap front end, and it's true of metamask. Metamask swap makes a ton of money. The uniswap front end makes a ton of money.
00:42:00.914 - 00:42:31.210, Speaker A: And so people have always, and they tend to attract kind of stupid flow, for lack of a better word, like flow. That's okay with getting sandwiched, okay with getting arbitrage. Leaves a lot of mev on the table. Is happy to pay relatively high fees. Like on metamask swap, you're really just paying a fee for laziness. Like, you could go to one inch or another aggregator, but you've just chosen to use metamask and are happy paying them a pretty high fee. And so I think aggregating unsophisticated flow is very valuable in crypto.
00:42:31.210 - 00:43:06.118, Speaker A: It's just been a huge challenge because no one has been able to do it other than metamask and the actual front ends for applications themselves. And so that's kind of the Uniswap front end. Some people trade, people go to aave and all to lend money out, but no one has actually quite managed to create just an interface. A lot of people have tried, but really it's just been metamask and Uniswap. And I think that was true until this year. Telegram bots are like the first time we've seen someone successfully build just a trading interface without building the protocol themselves or building a wallet. And I think that's actually super cool.
00:43:06.118 - 00:43:45.082, Speaker A: I think actually, telegram bots are underrated. People currently are excited because they kind of charge fees and the tokens have taxes I think they actually generate so much mev because they tend to attract users who don't care much about slippage or high fees. I think they remain hugely valuable. I think this year we have seen a billion and a half dollars of volume flowing through telegram bots, which is pretty significant. I think people aren't paying as much attention, but there's a whole bunch of people using them. They primarily use them for sniping, but slowly, I think they're going to start using them for trading as well. And I think they benefit hugely from the fact that we are in a shitcoin meta right now.
00:43:45.082 - 00:44:27.056, Speaker A: People continue to be excited about trading new assets. People continue to be kind of excited about earning multiples on their investments as opposed to kind of smaller returns. And so I think generally, we've seen interface innovation versus metamask and Uniswap. We've kind of seen strong evidence this year that what people want aren't fancy social recovery wallets. People just want to ape shit coins through their telegram bots. And I actually think, like, as much as there's a part of crypto that kind of holds their nose up here and is worried about security risks, I think we spend a lot of time on telegram building trading interfaces on telegram makes a lot of sense, and I think they're kind of the first time we've seen interface innovation versus metamask and Uniswap. So I think telegram bots are not a flash in the pan.
00:44:27.056 - 00:44:34.080, Speaker A: I actually think they say a lot about where crypto, UI and Ux are going broadly, and I expect to see some really big wins in this category.
00:44:34.192 - 00:45:06.768, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's one of the most interesting predictions, because this wasn't a thing last time. And I'm definitely one of those people who kind of hold their nose up at the security of this and haven't really spent much time using these things. We've spent time looking into the numbers from an investment perspective in terms of using them. I don't have the courage to use some of these things, but it is pretty impressive for people watching this on video. Asana pulled up this dashboard about the volumes for these telegram bots, and they say that this number is actually understated. It's $1.5 billion.
00:45:06.768 - 00:45:30.404, Speaker B: The real number is probably a bit higher. And if you look at the lifetime volume of things like Maestro, the number one Dexbot, it claims to be like $3 billion. And I'm actually surprised the revenue isn't as high as I thought. So this is. Is this a number of either. Is this like dollars? They made $16,000, so $17,000 in revenue off of $3 billion in volume.
00:45:30.484 - 00:45:40.036, Speaker A: Yeah, I haven't dug into this dash in a bit, so I would have to check. But, yeah, I think that's still pretty substantial. Right. Relative to any other app in crypto.
00:45:40.220 - 00:46:03.458, Speaker B: That's true. Yeah, that's very true. That's a good point. And at one point, I think Unibot was like, valued at like 200 million at launch. And, yeah, if you look at the user trends on this dashboard board is quite interesting as well. It's just been kind of exploding throughout the entire quarter. And I think this ties into the regulation meta as well, which is as exchanges get more and more regulated under more scrutiny, their listing process will get slower and slower.
00:46:03.458 - 00:46:51.270, Speaker B: Slower. And a lot of the more degenerate gambles and bets will probably start off chain, as they always have, but probably more so now that there's more scrutiny on these exchanges. So the more risk loving retailers probably flock to kind of dexs, and they all want an edge, and these things probably provide them with some sort of a perceived edge. And I think that the bigger implication of this as well is mobile, which is my last prediction, which is, I think the biggest use case for crypto or the biggest application this year will happen on mobile. So we've seen kind of hints of this every cycle. Axie, obviously 2 million daily active users, that was primarily mobile as well. And then after the fizzle out this year, friendtech, 50,000, I think, daily active users at the peak, also completely mobile.
00:46:51.270 - 00:47:40.074, Speaker B: So I think some sort of mobile application makes a lot of sense. If you think about the amount of time we spend on our desktops versus our mobile, it makes sense for crypto to make that transition. I don't know what exactly it's going to take. Is it like better wallet tech? Is it account abstraction or social recovery for wallets? We've had those on mobile for a long time. Those haven't been massive drivers of usage. I think it's really just, it takes one interesting application for everybody to leapfrog over to mobile. And I think another underrated thing that hasn't been discussed much is the fact that there seems to be this relatively new, maybe I'm just a boomer, but relatively new heuristic, or this UI that allows you to save a link as an icon on your home screen, on your iPhone, for instance.
00:47:40.074 - 00:48:05.194, Speaker B: So that's what fintech does. That's what I think unlonely. One of the applications you showed me does a lot of applications can just bypass the App Store completely and just occupy real estate on your phone screen without needing to go through the whole App Store process. So I think that's also another big unlock. There's just a lot of factors leading to some sort of a mobile hit taking off. So that is something that I'm quite excited about as well.
00:48:05.734 - 00:48:10.034, Speaker A: Do you specifically expect it to be in social or gaming?
00:48:10.384 - 00:48:49.046, Speaker B: I think it will probably be a mix of both, actually. Yeah. So one of the. I don't know how much I could share, but one of the, you know which one this is a company that we just backed that will announce soon is a mix of both. So it is a mobile application where on the top screen you have a streamer that will entertain you, talk to you, and then on the bottom half of the screen is a game that you can play with other people who are participating in that stream. So there's a game and a social element. So there's like two revenue streams, right? There's tips to the streamer and then there's also revenues generated in game.
00:48:49.046 - 00:49:25.398, Speaker B: So I think that type of application allows for multiple streams of financing, which is a great fit for DeFi because you can abstract all of that into one NFT or one token. So it sounds like a cop out answer, but I would defend it by saying that it's not because I actually backed a company that does exactly half of gaming and half of social. And I'm very excited to share that soon. I think that is pretty much all of our predictions to start out today. I think we went through like nine or ten predictions. If you have to pick one that is most likely to play out and one that is least likely to play out, which one would it be? I don't know.
00:49:25.406 - 00:49:53.800, Speaker A: I have a lot of confidence in my predictions. I think the Eigen layer one is probably aggressive, though I'm still leaning towards it's happening. But that's probably the one where people will would find pretty controversial because, I mean, given that only 23% of ETH is staked, it's pretty aggressive to say that 10% will get restaked. I think the roll up one will probably happen. Maybe the cosmos one is too bearish. I mean, they do have a whole bunch of stuff happening. They're going to have a native USDC launch.
00:49:53.800 - 00:50:08.264, Speaker A: Maybe people finally discover that app chains and IVC are actually great. Maybe they're able to attract liquidity in some fashion. So that one's probably the most bearish one and might be a little too aggressive, but I kind of stand by all of mine.
00:50:09.484 - 00:50:40.024, Speaker B: Yeah, I wish I have the confidence as well. I think my highest conviction one is still I think the ETH ETF thing will disappoint and very high conviction about the mobile thing. I just don't know if it's going to happen within 2024 because that's very specific. I think the least likely one is probably the unbundling of ETH. I think the volume aspect in terms of L2, aggregate volume overtaking ETH is quite likely, but the valuation aspect, I think that's probably going to take at least a few years, if at all. But that's it folks. You have all of ten of our predictions.
00:50:40.024 - 00:51:03.232, Speaker B: I'm curious what you guys think and how they compare to the hundreds of predictions I'm sure you've seen on Twitter, so let us know in the comments below. And if you have any suggestions for topics that Sanet and I should go over, let us know on Twitter on YouTube. Shout at us. We're always excited to hear from some of you.
