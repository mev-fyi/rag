00:00:41.072 - 00:00:42.768, Speaker A: Episode, I've got some great news for you.
00:00:42.856 - 00:00:46.320, Speaker C: Now, a lot of you have been asking for how I analyze projects that I bring on the show.
00:00:46.432 - 00:00:48.136, Speaker B: That's why I decided to create Blockchain's.
00:00:48.160 - 00:01:32.110, Speaker C: Vip to share with you all the heavy research that goes on behind the scenes. Now, every week or so, our team prepares an in depth research memo with things like sector analysis, technical concepts made simple, in depth competitor breakdown, and even interactive models so you can learn about the most important projects before they become important. And our team is putting in hours every week, scouring discord, twitter, forums and blogs to help you get an edge in crypto and understand the latest projects and themes at the deepest levels. That goes way beyond just an interview. Now, in addition, we'll also host exclusive AMA's with myself to answer any of your questions. So all of these are only available to blockchain's vip subscribers. And the good news is that while our interviews will always be free, the vip tier costs less than one coffee a day.
00:01:32.110 - 00:01:38.114, Speaker C: So head on over to theBlockcrunch.com VIP or click the link in the show notes below to sign up.
00:01:40.574 - 00:02:04.594, Speaker B: Alright, hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrench podcast. Now, this is an episode that I've been wanting to do for a very, very long time, which is an in depth look at Daos. The Dao thesis. What's wrong with Daos today? And how can we grow this Dao universe? And with me are two of Dao's biggest proponents, Peter and Dimitri. From one k x. Dimitri, you've been on the show before, but Peter, this is your block crunch virginity. So welcome to the show, both of you.
00:02:05.774 - 00:02:10.714, Speaker D: I am proud to have lost my blood crunch virginity here. I'm excited.
00:02:11.534 - 00:02:35.534, Speaker B: Yeah, super, super stoked to have both of you on. So now, you guys both are part of this fund called one Kx, which our listeners are familiar with. And you guys put put out this really great blog post recently about this future of daos so before we dive into that, can you just give us a little definition of just what daos are? Because people out there seem to think that anything with a discord and with a twitter is a Dao. So is that the right definition?
00:02:36.754 - 00:02:37.154, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:02:37.194 - 00:03:05.352, Speaker D: So I think, first of all, we're still really understanding what could DAos be. But I think on a property level, yeah. The organizations that are crypto native, the digital first, and the organizations that have distributed ownership and governance structures. So unlike traditional equity companies, in which there's sort of total board controlled or CEO controlled sort of organizations, ownership, governance of assets, rights, all properties of the.
00:03:05.368 - 00:03:09.176, Speaker E: Organization, completely, I guess, distributed in governance.
00:03:09.360 - 00:03:16.374, Speaker D: By the community members that are part of these organizations. Hence, decentralized, autonomous organizations. I think a lot of people mistake.
00:03:16.414 - 00:03:19.526, Speaker E: Autonomous for being automated software, but in.
00:03:19.550 - 00:03:24.222, Speaker D: My definition, the autonomy of a lot of these digital native organizations comes from.
00:03:24.358 - 00:03:30.750, Speaker E: The fact that the management of these organizations are permissionless by token holders or.
00:03:30.782 - 00:03:33.234, Speaker D: The owners of that distributed organization.
00:03:34.694 - 00:03:37.310, Speaker E: And I think there's a lot of.
00:03:37.342 - 00:03:42.610, Speaker D: Exciting things, but I think the most exciting thing about daos is the fact that they're very easy to store, arguably.
00:03:42.682 - 00:03:45.658, Speaker E: Much harder to run. But you can start them in a.
00:03:45.666 - 00:04:00.930, Speaker D: Couple minutes with a Nosis safe and set up a snapshot dashboard just as quickly, and you're off to the races, coordinating and discord, or telegram, or whatever communication tool you want. And I think the cool thing about.
00:04:00.962 - 00:04:03.738, Speaker E: This is that you just have a lot more experimentation.
00:04:03.786 - 00:04:11.216, Speaker D: You have a lot more open source innovation happening just because of how easy it is. And if you have a lot more.
00:04:11.240 - 00:04:14.064, Speaker E: Experiments happening, you'll find a lot more things that are working.
00:04:14.224 - 00:04:21.936, Speaker D: And I think this is where things get really cool, is that you get to have different permutations and different attempts.
00:04:21.960 - 00:04:25.264, Speaker E: At building different, I guess, at building.
00:04:25.344 - 00:04:40.604, Speaker D: Products, at building services, at making investments, and different people able to try different things in ways that we would never completely expect, with a rigid legacy structure.
00:04:40.644 - 00:04:42.144, Speaker E: That'S purely paper based.
00:04:42.564 - 00:04:46.544, Speaker D: Instead, it's all software based, it's all programmatic, it's completely flexible.
00:04:47.244 - 00:04:51.024, Speaker E: And that's, I think, why people are excited about daos.
00:04:52.644 - 00:05:36.516, Speaker F: And then I'll offer two more definitions. I think you asked ten people what the definition is. You get ten different answers. Two more perspectives. One is, it's a group of individuals who are loosely organizationally coordinated and strongly economically coordinated towards a common goal. So really groups of people with a shared mission and a shared bank account. And I would actually argue ten people with gnosis safe using discord emoji voting is a doubt more traditional definition is actually, if you just look at what a cooperative is, you google it, it tells you they're member owned, member governed businesses that operate from, for the benefit of their members.
00:05:36.516 - 00:05:43.544, Speaker F: And I think from another light, daos are effectively these digital cooperatives.
00:05:44.444 - 00:05:53.224, Speaker B: Do daos need a token to be a dao? Like, if I'm just a community, what differentiates a digital community from a decentralized, autonomous organization?
00:05:55.044 - 00:06:12.490, Speaker D: I would say, at least from my perspective, I think Daos can totally exist without a token itself. I think, you know, people can definitely coordinate around shared objectives and I guess, you know, cooperate and collaborate without economic alignment. But I think the token is what.
00:06:12.522 - 00:06:16.442, Speaker E: Establishes the economic alignment and establishes, I.
00:06:16.458 - 00:06:20.114, Speaker D: Guess, a social contract that everyone is working together in a positive, some way.
00:06:20.154 - 00:06:21.534, Speaker E: Towards that shared goal.
00:06:22.634 - 00:06:23.694, Speaker B: That makes sense.
00:06:24.034 - 00:06:24.650, Speaker E: Yeah, go ahead.
00:06:24.682 - 00:06:25.154, Speaker B: Sorry.
00:06:25.274 - 00:06:40.334, Speaker F: Oh, sorry. I just want to add, like, it need not be a fungible token. You know, we've seen Daos operate with nfts. I think nouns is a good example of a DAO that operates via one NFT, one vote.
00:06:41.274 - 00:06:42.974, Speaker B: That's a really fantastic point.
00:06:44.394 - 00:07:01.522, Speaker D: Arguably, it doesn't even need to be a transferable token at all. It could be completely reputational based, right? So arguably, daos have existed for many years or hundreds of years before even crypto with, like, religions, right, where it's just purely social contracts and purely social reputation.
00:07:01.698 - 00:07:03.826, Speaker E: A bunch of, you know, I guess.
00:07:03.890 - 00:07:12.482, Speaker D: Priests and churches scribbling down who's good and who's bad and who can be trusted, right? So, yeah, there's a lot to explore that.
00:07:12.658 - 00:08:06.454, Speaker B: I guess it's really just a digital way for people to collectively coordinate. But this time we can actually do it decentrally, like for, versus say, like churches before, where you need, like, local kind of parishes, you know, local communities, you can just do it completely online right now. And the tokens are just one of the many tools to introduce economic alignment, which Dimitri mentioned. And I think it's really refreshing that you guys are bullish dows, because in this market environment, every influencer out there is bearish dows. And I think for good reason as well, because there's been so many stories of just, like, free riders and things getting too bureaucratic at a Dow level. So before I get into kind of specific examples that we've seen in the recent kind of months, what are your general thoughts about that? Like, are daos just fundamentally harder to manage than an actual company? And are there, like, specific use cases that can only be done with a Dao and not with a startup company?
00:08:07.674 - 00:08:39.102, Speaker D: Yeah, it's fascinating, right? A lot of the sentiment towards Daos sort of echo the sentiment towards tokens back in the last cycle, in 2017, 2018, after the last crash. Massive, bearish sentiment towards tokens. No one believes in tokens as a means of value crawl. Everyone believed in equity companies. I think in a similar way, you know, the idea of daos is quite a valid one. I think the excitement is valid. However, the implementation of the current daos have been not great, to say the least.
00:08:39.102 - 00:08:42.822, Speaker D: Right. I think one core issue is, I.
00:08:42.838 - 00:08:45.158, Speaker E: Guess, you know, you can sort of.
00:08:45.166 - 00:09:12.630, Speaker D: Think of daos as digital organizations, but another way is to think about Dallas as games that were the object. Instead of like, the objectives being purely digital and purely virtual. They're around business objectives, they're around creating things, around investing, they're around building services. And I think the main difficulty with daos is the fact that most of the daos are trying to build organizations or build digital organizations around objectives that.
00:09:12.662 - 00:09:17.046, Speaker E: They are not yet clear on until Yl.
00:09:17.070 - 00:09:47.908, Speaker D: It's like they're trying to build game loops over things that are very, very difficult and unable to build game loops for. I think a lot of the daos that we've seen fail or struggle really are built around really, really difficult processes and objectives, such as product development. Whereas we've seen many Daos with simpler game loops, such as service Daos, or investment daos, or even NFT collection daos operate pretty effectively. I think that we're just. Yet, I think we're in a process.
00:09:47.956 - 00:09:51.208, Speaker E: Of discovering how to build more, I.
00:09:51.216 - 00:10:12.016, Speaker D: Guess, game bullets for more and more sophisticated and more complex activities. I mean, like, product development is the hardest game. Arguably, product development in a centralized team by itself is extremely difficult by nature. And if you throw that into a decentralized environment where everyone has power, yes, you're going to end up with a.
00:10:12.040 - 00:10:17.554, Speaker E: Mess to say, and I think so, like zooming out.
00:10:17.594 - 00:10:33.654, Speaker D: I think that idea of aligning groups of people permissible, see through tokens is still a highly powerful idea. I think we've just yet to figure out how to actually execute on these ideas. And maybe Dmitry has a few thoughts here.
00:10:34.074 - 00:11:25.884, Speaker F: Well, I could offer the bullish bear perspective in the sense that most are probably broken, especially when we're looking at protocol daos. But I would frame it as a thing we need to figure out regardless of whether we want to or not. It's almost like the web3 vision of having these open source protocols and public goods that span across generations. You effectively need to solve the human coordination layer and establish the right ownership and coordination structures that allow individuals from around the world to continue stewarding the software. This is very specific to protocol DAO. And I think like Peter was mentioning, like the different flavors, but I think if you believe in the web3 vision, you need to solve for the human coordination layer.
00:11:27.224 - 00:11:52.944, Speaker B: And I think it's really important that you guys brought up these different types of daos. Like there's product focused DaO. It's like basically like make her Dao. The entire DAO is surrounding one single product and the development of that product. And then there's more, I guess objective oriented DAos, or more generalist Daos. For instance, like these VC Daos, like Metacartel, which, Peter, you're very intimately familiar with, which for our listeners it's basically a venture Dao. It's a group of people investing money into startups.
00:11:52.944 - 00:12:27.934, Speaker B: But then regardless of what type of Dao it is, I personally am a hardline progressive decentralization believer, which is this belief that we should always start with a centralized entity and have just a bunch of people extremely motivated to solve a problem and then over time decentralized and include more people in. And I've never seen the opposite work. Like, I've never seen something that starts completely decentrally work, except for bitcoin and ethereum. So I'm curious what you guys think there is progressive decentralization the only way to do this properly? Or have you guys like seen counterexamples of that?
00:12:31.194 - 00:13:23.044, Speaker F: I think from my perspective, you probably need to have it be progressive. I think it helps. I think the initial 1020 members of your DAO will dictate the culture of the next 100 to 200 members of your DaO. And I think you actually need to be very thoughtful with how you scale the initial group of people and how you expand that. So first you need to be able to onboard really passionate, you know, find ten really passionate contributors, ship product or achieve some shared goal with those ten people. And then you could expand to 2040, 80, et cetera. And I think a lot of Daos grew too quickly and they have, you know, 100 plus contributors and no one really knows what they're doing.
00:13:23.044 - 00:13:35.802, Speaker F: No one really has like clear responsibility over specific areas. And I think before you scale, you need to get the right people to join and then figure out structure and.
00:13:35.818 - 00:13:39.274, Speaker E: Then figure out ownership on top of.
00:13:39.314 - 00:13:56.094, Speaker D: To that point, most of these Daos are onboarding hundreds of people or into paid positions without actually understanding what the game looks like, what the game plan is, what the sustainable participation revenue loops look like.
00:13:57.634 - 00:13:58.762, Speaker E: And when you do that, all you.
00:13:58.778 - 00:13:59.634, Speaker D: Do is just burn money.
00:13:59.714 - 00:14:00.334, Speaker E: Right.
00:14:00.754 - 00:14:10.906, Speaker D: I think there's sort of like two things to balance. So I think that, like, I am generally in the camp of like progressive decentralization, but I'll argue the other side.
00:14:10.970 - 00:14:11.554, Speaker E: Right.
00:14:11.714 - 00:14:47.894, Speaker D: Just as a thought experiment too, I think that it's a balance rather than a pure one sided progressive decentralization and the different modes of operating that you can sort of, you should be careful, you should, you can decide to opt for as well, in the sense that when, when you're launching a dao, there's two things to get right. I think, first, you need to understand what is, I guess like a core business loop that is sustainable and at the same time you need to attract contributors that can contribute to these business loops or revenue loops. And I think it's a balance between.
00:14:48.054 - 00:14:52.342, Speaker E: Figuring out the loops by themselves as well as bring a community of people.
00:14:52.438 - 00:14:54.474, Speaker D: Alongside the journey with you so that.
00:14:54.514 - 00:14:57.162, Speaker E: The aligned, they're involved, they feel like.
00:14:57.178 - 00:15:02.210, Speaker D: They'Re part of a movement that's bigger than what they are. And I think it's hard to achieve.
00:15:02.242 - 00:15:05.154, Speaker E: That if you just forgot the business.
00:15:05.194 - 00:15:11.706, Speaker D: Loops and start day one with absolutely nothing. Nothing started right from scratch effectively.
00:15:11.850 - 00:15:17.370, Speaker E: And I think, yeah, I think a.
00:15:17.402 - 00:15:21.158, Speaker D: Different case might be the fact that if everyone, if you threw in 100.
00:15:21.206 - 00:15:24.022, Speaker E: People into a group in which everyone.
00:15:24.078 - 00:15:42.634, Speaker D: Really understood the core business loops very well, could they participate and could they become a meaningfully decentralized Dao while still being affected from day one? I think maybe, yes. I think there are different ways to start daos. I think the progressive decentralization route definitely.
00:15:43.214 - 00:15:44.554, Speaker E: Is a lot simpler.
00:15:45.014 - 00:16:24.568, Speaker D: It's a lot more iterative, it's something that we understand as an operating model for web two. But I also suspect that different ways to launch these organizations maybe start at scale. But I would admit that we haven't yet figured out effective operating processes that allow us to achieve meaningful results at scale yet. So I think that's a TVD, that's a design space, a coordination design space that we haven't yet figured out. I wouldn't just discard it as something that doesn't necessarily work, but yes to the data. I totally agree. Like, you know, nothing has super, really worked from a decentralization first perspective.
00:16:24.568 - 00:16:28.244, Speaker D: That's a, you know, it's just a different perspective, I guess.
00:16:28.744 - 00:16:39.764, Speaker B: And are there like good examples of progressive decentralization done well in your, in your opinion, like projects that maybe people can look to as a template for how to do this properly?
00:16:41.184 - 00:16:48.384, Speaker D: Yeah, I think one of the. I guess one of the Daos that really surprised me was code arena.
00:16:48.684 - 00:16:52.424, Speaker E: Code arena is a DAO that basically.
00:16:52.764 - 00:16:57.316, Speaker D: Coordinates auditors and software engineers to look for bugs and to audit code.
00:16:57.340 - 00:16:57.524, Speaker E: Right.
00:16:57.564 - 00:17:05.644, Speaker D: Traditionally, smart contract audits have conducted by a handful of auditing shops. Instead, what they've done is that they've.
00:17:05.684 - 00:17:12.342, Speaker E: Created a service, Dao, that coordinates auditors to run audit contests.
00:17:12.518 - 00:17:15.982, Speaker D: They basically connect their bugs that they.
00:17:15.998 - 00:17:19.510, Speaker E: Find, and they're rewarded once they're reviewed.
00:17:19.662 - 00:18:05.306, Speaker D: And the fascinating thing about why code arena is working is that the game loop of smart contract auditing is actually fairly straightforward, I think, in comparison to much more complex game loops or revenue loops, such as product development, where you're trying to build a new product, discover a market, and find revenue and monetize it, auditing is actually much more straightforward. And as such, it's been able to really, I guess, identify what it takes to automate the process of code contests, code auditing contests, and scale that. And they're at a stage in which they're beginning to automate a lot of the manual processes that they've initially facilitated, and they're starting to really step back.
00:18:05.450 - 00:18:09.778, Speaker E: While also seeing the machine run fairly efficiently.
00:18:09.826 - 00:18:13.306, Speaker D: So they were able to really do.
00:18:13.370 - 00:18:19.994, Speaker E: Roughly initially, like, one audit contest a month. They're roughly doing a handful of, like.
00:18:20.034 - 00:19:03.726, Speaker D: Maybe one order contest a week right now. They want to scale to a point where they can do 1020 per week, and they're able to really do that in a fairly straightforward way without actually introducing increasing fixed costs that traditional services business would have. I think this just is an interesting data point because it sort of enlightened me to this idea that how well your DaO can operate is wholly dependent, or at least how hard it is to build a DAO is wholly dependent on how complex your participation loops look like and whether you can really automate the incentives, automate the processes involved, and then be able to scale that way.
00:19:03.790 - 00:19:07.894, Speaker E: Right, but I think that's one example.
00:19:08.014 - 00:19:09.662, Speaker D: Maybe Dimitri can talk about a few others.
00:19:09.718 - 00:19:42.564, Speaker F: Yeah, well, it's a good example. And also with Coderina, the wardens, at least the initial wardens, have a sense of ownership. They do receive a token allocation. It really helps the retention rate of the highest quality auditors. And if you look at the discord, it's actually not very buzzy. You know, it's not like a lot of these daos that have, you know, thousands of people in their discord. It's actually fairly quick when token.
00:19:42.564 - 00:20:19.864, Speaker F: Yeah, yeah. Like people are doing work, and they have a very clear understanding of, of the job to be done and then how to coordinate around that. So I don't think a successful Dao necessarily means that your discord is always buzzy. I think it's actually more. So how can you clearly define the rules of engagement and the economic loops and then have people coordinate around those loops in somewhat of a decentralized way?
00:20:20.884 - 00:20:45.374, Speaker B: And for these successful examples of daos out there who manage to pull off this progressive decentralization, what are the things that they decentralize first? What are the things that, for the projects out there who are trying to do the same, what are some of the things that they should delegate to the community to vote on first? And then what are some of the things they should probably keep it as centralized as possible until the final part of their decentralization?
00:20:46.114 - 00:21:51.038, Speaker F: Conceptually, I would start with most simple things first, like the lowest risk, because I do think it's a bit of a learning process with the community members. And I think if you're building a play to earn game, what you probably don't want to do is hand off economic modeling to the community. It's a very difficult thing. There aren't many subject matter experts. And actually I think that's why a lot of the early experiments around base layer governance and dow structures around base layer governance hasn't played out like a lot of people thought it would, because there's so few people that understand things at that technical of a level. So I think things around base protocol changes like product development are probably things that could come at a later stage. And I think you almost need to teach your community how you want them to engage with the core team and then participate with the core team in.
00:21:51.046 - 00:21:53.318, Speaker E: The beginning to that point.
00:21:53.366 - 00:22:04.412, Speaker D: We've actually been doing some work with Sky Mavis on scaling the governance recently, where the vision all along for Sky Mavis was really to have decentralized governments.
00:22:04.438 - 00:22:07.664, Speaker E: Governance of the Axie game and economy. Right.
00:22:07.784 - 00:22:26.016, Speaker D: But however, and as much as people are screaming for governance, if you just transferred governance to access holders from day one, or at least right now, it'd be complete chaos. It would just probably be people proposing to give themselves a lot more SLP than they have right now already or some other sort of self interested proposals.
00:22:26.080 - 00:22:27.524, Speaker E: Without a lot of signal.
00:22:28.664 - 00:22:35.404, Speaker D: The team has recognized us and that's why this, they're taking a different approach. And I guess the approach that we sort of like came together on.
00:22:35.444 - 00:22:36.024, Speaker E: Right.
00:22:37.164 - 00:22:39.260, Speaker D: And landed on was this idea of.
00:22:39.452 - 00:22:42.340, Speaker E: I guess, credential based governance where you.
00:22:42.372 - 00:23:16.958, Speaker D: Actually want to have subject domain experts identified through verifiable credentials, whether identified manually or programmatically. You want to identify the people who can actually participate effectively in governance, who have subject matter experts expertise to have informed decisions, and then you want to organize those people together under political parties, almost as groups that can basically informed opinions and form signal around them, while also giving them highlighted governance bonuses in.
00:23:16.966 - 00:23:18.494, Speaker E: The areas that they are experts in.
00:23:18.574 - 00:23:20.966, Speaker D: So I think maybe one or two.
00:23:20.990 - 00:23:24.902, Speaker E: Years out, the vision is people who.
00:23:24.918 - 00:23:35.642, Speaker D: Have gone through the axis school of economics have a 20% governance bonus in all economic related matters. And you can sort of scale this with like, in traditional world government, you.
00:23:35.658 - 00:23:37.186, Speaker E: Have the Ministry of Defense, you have.
00:23:37.210 - 00:23:42.570, Speaker D: Ministry of Health, you have Ministry of education, blah blah. I suspect we're gonna see the same with axie.
00:23:42.602 - 00:23:46.034, Speaker E: But that governance, I guess, like, that.
00:23:46.074 - 00:24:02.628, Speaker D: Governance coordination doesn't sort of necessarily, like, emerge so organically. You need to do the groundwork to actually form these groups. You need to do the groundwork to identify the right people and then highlight them and give them way more, a lot more leverage than everyone else.
00:24:02.796 - 00:24:07.196, Speaker E: And yeah, I think this is probably.
00:24:07.300 - 00:24:22.064, Speaker D: Sort of a hint of where governance is going. You know, credential based governance is going to, and reputation based governance is going to only become a lot more important, at least in daos, in which you really need to effectively govern at large scale.
00:24:26.434 - 00:24:27.946, Speaker B: Hey guys, I'm really excited to tell.
00:24:27.970 - 00:25:13.938, Speaker A: You more about one of my favorite products in crypto right now, DyDx. This is a team I've known since 2018, and they've built one of the best exchange venues out there that also happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly. Now listen until the end, because there's an opportunity for savvy traders out there as well. And here are just a few reasons why I like DyDx over other exchanges. First, it's very liquid, processes two to $3 billion every day in volume, and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording, which means you can trade things like ethereum, bitcoin, doge, solana, and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today. Second, its also extremely cheap, and if youre down bad from the bear market, you dont have to worry about gas fees at all, because there is no gas fee on starkware L2, where DyDX is built on. That brings me to my next point as well.
00:25:13.938 - 00:26:02.198, Speaker A: Incredibly fast. Unlike other L2 and high speed dexs, you dont actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore. And as an additional point by using Starkware, DyDX also provides users with increased security and privacy. And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature, which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so many different subaccounts and their IO iOApp's mobile app is also live right now, and it's amazing because it's compatible with Metamask, Coinbase wallet, Coin 98, Huawei Wallet, and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there. And it's available for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today. And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions. The most recent tier in the $10,000 equity tier have won over $95,000 in rewards.
00:26:02.198 - 00:26:17.454, Speaker A: And you can get started with as low as $500 in equity to compete for prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DyDX exchange to learn more. And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:26:19.554 - 00:27:06.380, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's so interesting because I actually just recently read about this as well. Your work at one KX with meta portal Dao basically helping Axie Infinity trying to credential at least 1000 contributors instead of formal processes. And this ties in pretty well with a recent episode we did with Project Galaxy, which is a credentialing project, and for vip subscribers, we did write a ten page report on just how it works. And I do think that is probably going to be how large daos have to govern themselves over time. But at the same time, I think Axio is also an exception because at least my impression is that most of the DAO use cases are often very short lived and very ad hoc. So we have things like Constitution Dao. Basically a bunch of people decided, hey, we're going to raise some to money and try to buy the constitution, like Nick Cage in national treasure.
00:27:06.380 - 00:27:38.364, Speaker B: And then there's citydao, where they just kind of bought 40 acres of land in Wyoming. And then there was people pleaserdow, where a bunch of whales just pulled together capital to buy some art. So all of these actually strikes me as more less companies, more like spvs with a very finite duration in terms of their lifespan. I'm curious about where you guys think most daos would head towards. Is this more going to be like these ad hoc, organic, maybe short lived type of entities? Or is it all corporations just going to become daos?
00:27:39.944 - 00:28:57.394, Speaker F: I think there's an. And I think we've been talking about different flavors, and I think that distinction is important around protocol daos, service Daos, collector Daos. I think in a few years, quantity wise, we're probably going to see many more of these collector Daos, like the pleaser type flavor. I think the members in these daos is going to be much smaller in the single to low double digit digit. And likely the dollar amount that they'll be managing is also going to be much smaller than what's in a protocol DaO treasury. I think the collector Dao and investment DaO use cases, flavors, and to some extent, service daos play better with more of a retail type use case. And I think as the concept and crypto as, like, a tech in general reaches more mainstream, I think that's going to be a fairly popular flavor of multiplayer coordination.
00:29:00.454 - 00:29:00.806, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:29:00.830 - 00:29:02.794, Speaker B: And Peter, anything to add there as well?
00:29:04.454 - 00:29:07.434, Speaker D: I think Dimitri hit the nail on the head.
00:29:08.214 - 00:29:42.598, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah, I totally agree with that. I do think it makes sense that there will be more collector Daos than Project Daos, and I'm really excited to see where they evolve into, but I think we've kind of shield daos enough. So I want to focus a little bit on the maybe more negative stuff, which is people's gripes towards daos. So I think one notable example is the Uniswap dao. So they established this Defi education fund, I think back in June 2021, they received, like, 30 to 45 million in unit tokens. And then most of the votes for those tokens were voted in by institutional holders.
00:29:42.598 - 00:30:06.314, Speaker B: And there's a proposal to pass through despite major community pushback. And then, as expected, they dumped out their tokens because of market conditions and not much news in progress since then. So this seems like a lot of this, like, bureaucracy and fake governance is still happening, especially for very large daos. What do you guys think about that? And is this something that we can resolve over time?
00:30:07.984 - 00:30:13.472, Speaker E: Arguably, the uniswap example actually highlights, I.
00:30:13.488 - 00:30:34.272, Speaker D: Feel like highlights the benefit of distributed decentralized governance. I feel like the fact that that proposal was allowed to pass while the community itself was pushing against it should rationality on the community's part, maybe as exception more than the rule in this space. But once the crowd showed some level of wisdom, and it was actually sort.
00:30:34.288 - 00:30:36.536, Speaker E: Of, I guess, like the larger whales.
00:30:36.560 - 00:30:39.224, Speaker D: Who had sort of, you know, who were investors before. Right.
00:30:39.264 - 00:30:45.576, Speaker E: And I think this goes points towards the fact that it just shows the.
00:30:45.600 - 00:30:48.552, Speaker D: Degree of decentralization for that very dow maybe.
00:30:48.608 - 00:30:49.204, Speaker E: Right.
00:30:49.824 - 00:30:52.044, Speaker D: But I think generally speaking, yeah, like.
00:30:52.784 - 00:30:54.704, Speaker E: Daos have tons of issues today. Right.
00:30:54.744 - 00:31:11.312, Speaker D: So I think, like Dimitri said earlier in the podcast. Right. You know, your Dao, the first ten contributors are going to see the culture of your Dao, and the next 100 will drive that momentum forward and so on. And I think a lot of, I think that's been a structural issue of.
00:31:11.328 - 00:31:15.272, Speaker E: A lot of retroactive airdrops that have.
00:31:15.288 - 00:31:17.124, Speaker D: Been used to kickstart dows.
00:31:18.384 - 00:31:22.824, Speaker E: They're done at scale. So that culture is completely out of.
00:31:22.864 - 00:31:25.484, Speaker D: The control of a community or even the team.
00:31:26.284 - 00:31:34.540, Speaker E: It's, you know, just these communities are let loose, you know, and I think.
00:31:34.572 - 00:31:38.252, Speaker D: That'S just like, led to a lot of coordination failure on that front.
00:31:38.308 - 00:31:40.020, Speaker E: You know, people don't have the time.
00:31:40.052 - 00:31:45.212, Speaker D: To form relationships, to form and build these coordination structures to effectively work with.
00:31:45.228 - 00:31:47.636, Speaker E: Each other, and you just end up.
00:31:47.660 - 00:31:50.108, Speaker D: With this very antagonistic, very zero sum.
00:31:50.156 - 00:31:52.092, Speaker E: Environment where people are just trying to.
00:31:52.108 - 00:31:54.236, Speaker D: Extract value from one another without actually.
00:31:54.300 - 00:31:56.264, Speaker E: Caring about the shared objective here.
00:31:56.664 - 00:32:02.776, Speaker D: And I think uniswap definitely highlights that. But it would also add that I've.
00:32:02.800 - 00:32:05.520, Speaker E: Talked to the Uniswap team and other.
00:32:05.592 - 00:32:09.284, Speaker D: Supporters, and a lot of the inactivity is by design.
00:32:11.824 - 00:32:17.544, Speaker E: And I guess it's always in hindsight. So I think a lot of daos.
00:32:17.584 - 00:32:26.630, Speaker D: Have just meaninglessly spent money hide people. I think we get to see the effects of inactivity or lack of activity.
00:32:26.702 - 00:32:30.294, Speaker E: Or the high barrier to any activity.
00:32:30.334 - 00:32:34.398, Speaker D: Fold that down. Yeah.
00:32:34.446 - 00:33:42.098, Speaker F: I think you could frame it as governance extractable value. This could be proposals from a core team to raise their own salaries when there's no, like actual revenue being produced by the Dow itself. You almost act as like a union, like a worker union that might, you know, that could be threatening to leave if the treasury doesn't allocate more funds to keeping you on. I think that's an issue that needs to be solved. I do think NFT based voting, reputation based voting could address a lot of the issues with just pure token based voting. And yeah, I think Peter mentioned a lot of the points on contribution. I think you don't need to scale contribution for contribution's sake.
00:33:42.098 - 00:34:29.254, Speaker F: I think it's more so activation that's important around how do you find who your highest quality contributors are? Because they're out there, but they might not be fully engaged. And it's like, how do you activate all the latent talent that's in there in the specific cases where you need them? So I think it's more selective high performance contribution and it's really knowing who do you want to give a voice to in which situations, and then how loud of a voice do, do you want to give them? And I think, like that nuance, again, we're still trying to figure out how that works in the flavor of protocol daos, especially with a large number of token holders.
00:34:30.474 - 00:35:27.744, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that nuance is probably one of the most important points because on one hand, I think Peter's point is definitely right in the sense that the Uniswap examples illustrates why we should have more transparent and more decentralized governance so that not a few whales don't control decisions. But at the same time, there's this humorous quote that I'm paraphrasing, but it's basically to. The meaning of democracy is government for the people, by the people, but the people are dumb. And we kind of saw this example with a recent Dow dispute between Merit Circle and Yggdras, where the team was actually somewhat against this. But the members of the merit circle Dao voted to terminate the relationship with YgG, who is an investor in that Dao, basically scrapping their legal contract, which is actually illegal, and citing conflict of interest, amongst other reasons. And a lot of people were like, for this in the community, but it was clearly not something, at least in my opinion, not something.
00:35:27.744 - 00:35:47.104, Speaker B: That's correct. Just because it's illegal to kind of breach that contract. So in those situations, you know, how do you. How do you balance, like, giving the community a voice, but also, you know, when you run in situations like this with things that are maybe kind of illegal, maybe controversial, how do you resolve things like that?
00:35:49.204 - 00:35:56.276, Speaker D: It's a good question. I guess the root of the problem, there is more about the quality of your participants, the quality of your token holders.
00:35:56.300 - 00:35:56.436, Speaker E: Right.
00:35:56.460 - 00:36:15.228, Speaker D: I think people really, really understand how important this is. It's not just about, yeah, we got like 20,000 token holders, but if they're all idiots, then you're kind of fucked. You know, like, it's the point of curation, curating your core community. Right. And an issue, a structural issue of liquid ERC 20s. Right.
00:36:15.356 - 00:36:18.384, Speaker E: And I guess, how do you prevent it?
00:36:18.884 - 00:36:23.796, Speaker D: I honestly don't have a good answer for this. You know, I think most teams would.
00:36:23.820 - 00:36:29.190, Speaker E: Probably claim decentralization or I guess argue.
00:36:29.222 - 00:36:33.870, Speaker D: Some level of like, you know, regulatory arbitrage to say, like, hey, we have nothing to do with this. We couldn't have stopped it.
00:36:33.902 - 00:36:34.358, Speaker E: Right.
00:36:34.486 - 00:36:41.774, Speaker D: And I guess that is also the dangerous part about decentralized organizations, if they are truly decentralized, no single party can.
00:36:41.814 - 00:36:54.546, Speaker E: Pull the plug on something dangerous, reckless and or evil or whatever. Right. So I guess it's more points towards like, yeah, so we can expect a.
00:36:54.570 - 00:37:00.774, Speaker D: Lot to go wrong and more the point where we should be careful about building decentralized organizations that can't be stopped.
00:37:01.994 - 00:38:18.422, Speaker F: Yeah. And I think there's a lot of experimentation you could do here to say it could potentially be mitigated over time. So one example or one experiment I like to see is more of this kind of like retroactive, reputation based governance power, where, say, a DAO proposes a vote. With that vote is a very clear KPI attached at a specific point in time. And then at that point in time you evaluate, was this a good idea? Or like, did we hit the goal that we wanted? And maybe that's TVL volumes, some quantifiable metrics. And if you do, then the people who voted yes on that proposal get like a boosted governance power, they get more weight, and over time you could start to effectively curate the best decision makers in your dao. And that's kind of done by pseudo reputation and it's retroactive, so it'll take a few cycles to bake that in.
00:38:18.422 - 00:38:21.194, Speaker F: But I think that's one experiment that I love to see.
00:38:22.174 - 00:38:49.564, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that fits into the discussion that we had just now about credential as well. I do think that's one key missing part of Dow governance. But anyway, I think this has been an incredibly interesting conversation. There's so many more tangents we can take this on, but as we wrap up, I'd love to get your thoughts on just what is one dao that's like interesting to you or you're most excited for, or maybe just top of mind for both of you so that our listeners can go check it out. Demetria, would you like to go first?
00:38:50.264 - 00:39:09.402, Speaker F: Yeah, I think I mentioned it. I really like nouns. Very clear goal. It's to propagate the nouns IP. It has a sustainable funding structure. One noun per day gets auctioned off. It's a very natural, progressive decentralization just by nature of that supply ticking higher.
00:39:09.402 - 00:39:24.934, Speaker F: And you don't need an ERC 20 to govern it. And the community there has come up with some very interesting innovations around, effectively like the coordination governance space.
00:39:26.914 - 00:39:46.454, Speaker D: My favorite one right now is Suncamp. They're basically a Dao that brings people together to produce music behind the latest headless band known as headless chaos. And they brought together so many creatives, artists, musicians, producers, visual artists, to produce a whole album.
00:39:46.534 - 00:39:52.782, Speaker E: You know, where the royalties and the music revenue of the NFC mints that.
00:39:52.798 - 00:39:56.630, Speaker D: Are selling, you know, go directly real time to the participants.
00:39:56.702 - 00:40:06.342, Speaker E: And I'm just like fascinated by, yeah, like multiplayer cooperative, sort of like, you know, like collaboration, I guess.
00:40:06.438 - 00:40:08.914, Speaker D: And they're sort of really pushing the forefront of what's possible.
00:40:09.934 - 00:40:24.674, Speaker B: Yeah, most definitely. And thank you so much for those recommendations. And once again, thank you so much for coming on to the show.
