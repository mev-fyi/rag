00:00:00.520 - 00:00:29.412, Speaker A: So if you look at the distribution of flare once, right now there's basically two extremes. On one hand you have application specific chains like DydX and osmosis, and on the other hand you have general purpose chains like Ethereum and Solana. And they both have their own set of benefits, general purpose chains. The biggest benefit is around social coordination. They're able to have an ecosystem of projects that are all building together, and they're all on the same team. And with application specific chains, you benefit from customizability. So you're able to take every single layer of the stack and customize it to exactly what you want.
00:00:29.412 - 00:00:54.444, Speaker A: We think the area in between is the most interesting. So not quite general purpose, not quite application specific, but rather use case specific. And from this approach you end up benefiting from both the social coordination aspect. So in the case of, say, we can have different teams that are basically all part of the same family, that all help the, say, ecosystem succeed. It also benefits from having composable transactions. So you can have atomic transactions that span multiple projects, which you don't get if you have separate app chains that are trying to interact with each other. Our.
