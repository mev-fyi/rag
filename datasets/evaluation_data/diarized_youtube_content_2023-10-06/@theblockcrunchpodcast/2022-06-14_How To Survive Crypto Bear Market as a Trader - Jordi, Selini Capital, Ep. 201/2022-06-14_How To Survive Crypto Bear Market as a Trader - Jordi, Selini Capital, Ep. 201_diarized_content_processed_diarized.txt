00:01:08.104 - 00:01:49.686, Speaker B: Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, a lot of listeners have been asking for me to bring our guest this week back on the show in light of very volatile market environments. So, as you probably know already, if you've been following the show, Jordy is a trader, investor and the CIO of Cellini Capital, and he's known for his incisive observations of the crypto market. And previously, Jordy actually came on the show towards the beginning of this year to give us some color on where he thought the market was heading. And some of the stuff we discussed played out, some not. But what listeners enjoyed, besides Jordy's specific predictions was the clear framework that he provided to navigate this crazy market. So this week, I'm very excited to bring Jordi back on the show once again to talk about all things crypto markets.
00:01:49.686 - 00:02:06.154, Speaker B: And for our vip subscribers, we will touch on more specific predictions and outlook towards the end, which will turn into a transcript and send straight to your inbox. So if you don't want to miss out, make sure you're subscribed on theblockcrunch.com viP. So with that out of the way, welcome back in the show, Jordy.
00:02:07.134 - 00:02:12.444, Speaker D: Thanks, Jason. I wish you could be under better circumstances, but we'll make the best of what we can.
00:02:13.184 - 00:02:31.684, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And I think given what's happening in the market right now, I think Celsius has just paused all the withdrawals I think the opening question everyone is wondering is just where are we in the crypto cycle? Are we near the end of a bear market, or are we just at the beginning of a multi year bear market? What are your thoughts on that?
00:02:32.704 - 00:03:16.628, Speaker D: I think we're at the beginning of a multi month bear market. We talked last time and we had to give some probabilities on, you know, the base case scenario, which was we would go sideways. At the time, that was the base case that I saw. I had a very, very small chance of a bull case, which was, you know, some crazy adoption would get announced and there was some chance of a bear case. Unfortunately, we have really gone into this bear case. I think one thing that is clear is the one thing that we saw with Luna that was being discussed is this ratio between the amount of selling and the market cap impact. And in equities, that impact is usually between three and eight times.
00:03:16.628 - 00:04:04.994, Speaker D: So if somebody sells a billion dollars, it'll usually affect like $5 billion worth of market cap. In crypto, it's pretty clear that because of its nature and there's less participants compared to equities, we might be closer to like an eight to ten x multiple. So when we have somebody like Celsius maybe needing to sell, you know, I don't know, $5 billion or something, you can have like a $50 billion worth of market cap effect. Obviously, we saw that with Luna. So this goes both ways. It explains a little bit of the exponential, like, crazy rise we had in 2021 and 2020, because maybe at the time, 100 billion of buying pressure would create, know, a trillion dollars. And now 100 billion of sell pressure is basically obliterating a trillion dollars of market cap.
00:04:06.614 - 00:04:42.974, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think last time when we talked, there was, I think there were inklings that there were some lone voices out there, like the Lloyd capital talking about Luna being unsustainable. I think at that time you wrote a piece about how unsustainable algorithmic coins like Olympus were as well. But I don't think many people really predicted that it will be this quick of a destruction and wealth for Luna. And then now we might be seeing something similar but less intense with Celsius as well. So are these kind of, did you kind of factor in, would you consider these, first of all, edge cases or black swan events? And did you kind of factor these in in the beginning of the year?
00:04:44.234 - 00:05:34.544, Speaker D: Yeah, we're definitely seeing black swan events or at least gray swan events. When it comes to Celsius, it seems to just be like, not a very well run company that should have taken a bit more care with their short term liabilities. And a lot of people obviously made assumptions during the bull market that they don't need to take care and they don't need to worry about short term liquidity because everything is so amazing and all the multiples are growing now, all the assumptions are getting tested. We're really seeing an amount of pressure that some people thought we would get to, but a lot of people didn't expect that we would get to this amount of pressure. With Celsius specifically, we'll have to see exactly what is happening. There hasn't been transparency. It's not been very clear what they're needing to do with staked ETH, for example.
00:05:34.544 - 00:05:59.772, Speaker D: And they keep moving coins to FTX. That's what's been happening in the last 24, 48 hours. We're seeing a lot of coins moving there. So is FTX buying them? Are they dumping them? Is this just an OTC transaction? Nobody really knows. So I think there's enough uncertainty that until it gets resolved, the bottom won't really be put in. Yeah.
00:05:59.788 - 00:06:18.394, Speaker B: And I guess on a note, one thing you mentioned that I thought was really interesting is you think this will be a multi month bear market, which I guess seems to be somewhat contrarian in that a lot of people, it seems to be the consensus now that we're gonna have, you know, maybe recession in 2023, we might have a very drawn out bear market. So where does that kind of few months observation comes from?
00:06:18.734 - 00:07:15.996, Speaker D: I think the cycles right now are going to be very fast, like a lot faster than in previous times. 2008 was a very slow bear cycle. It really took many years to really get out of it. Then the COVID one, we saw a very fast v shaped recovery, which was just a matter of months. And I think now that's more the norm. Given that the way that governments are willing to act quickly and decisively in certain situations, partly because people kind of come to expect it now. You know, people at something will just expect more stimulus checks, for example, in the United States or even in like in the UK or other places, if the government is forced to give out handouts, then it just sort of creates a spiral on inflation again, of course, but also potentially prices rising without necessarily meaning that real prices are rising.
00:07:15.996 - 00:08:00.324, Speaker D: It just means nominal prices are rising. I think by next year around Q one, we'll see a reversal from the central banks. They'll have realized that the economies cannot really take this level of tightening and people will just prefer to take their luck with some combination of inflation, also getting checks in the mail. And what I've been predicting for a long time is creative taxation is going to come at that stage where governments will say we need to give out money to most people, but where does that money come from without creating a lot of inflation? We need to take it away from other places, and so they'll really start getting creative with taxation.
00:08:02.084 - 00:08:38.194, Speaker B: And I did hear that there's inklings of that in places like Australia already, where I think people who are abroad are worrying about potentially global taxation as well. And I hate to turn this into macro podcasts, but I have to bring up the fact that I think Drucken Miller recently on an interview mentioned that there hasn't been a situation like this where it resulted in a soft landing and almost always resolves in a recession. And I think he's calling for a recessionary case in 2023. And given that crypto hasn't really faced a recessionary environment before, how do you think about navigating that potential outcome?
00:08:39.294 - 00:09:56.224, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, crypto has kind of shown that because of its nature and how quickly the markets can trade and how swiftly valuations move, it can potentially act as a little bit of a bellwether in terms of the market at large and the sentiment. I think the valuations have already gone down 90% in many cases. We've seen even these elite God tier coins that were being mentioned on crypto Twitter at the beginning of the year as the convexes and all these favorites, the analyst favorites, are down over 90%. That doesn't mean they can't go down another 90%, but it does go to show that already the valuations are coming into more reasonable levels. I would say even a lot of the l one s that were at really crazy valuations, something like avalanche, it's not an unreasonable valuation right now. So I don't think that we can necessarily go a lot further down because at some point the nominal amounts just end up being so small compared to the mind share that crypto has. Because one thing that will stick is how many people know about crypto, have learned about crypto, are more comfortable with the concept of crypto.
00:09:56.224 - 00:10:33.704, Speaker D: So that will stay even in a bear market. So in terms of navigating it, obviously the simple things is the risk curve starts from bitcoin and goes to ethereum and then few l one s. And further on down, we will of course see bitcoin dominance go up. That's what we've been seeing, and that will continue to be the case. I think ultimately the bear market has to end with the majors pulling themselves out of it. So we're hoping optimistically for a nice ETH merge later this year. Would be nice if that goes smoothly.
00:10:33.704 - 00:10:54.884, Speaker D: If inflation continues to be a problem and bitcoin is seen as a potential way to escape that inflationary system for people, then those two assets can create a little bit of a wealth effect again to resume some of the altcoin evaluations that are maybe closer to fair value.
00:10:56.064 - 00:11:27.832, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. We're going to come back to that point about bitcoin being an inflation hedge as well. But one thing I thought that was very insightful that you gave in the last conversation we had on the podcast was that at the beginning of the year, you were monitoring mostly one thing, which was inflows from institutional funds. Your view was that if funds redeploy, then it would probably give you a more bullish outlook and increase the probability of a bull market continuation. If funds don't redeploy, then it will be a bearish outlook. And obviously they didn't redeploy. We had a horrible January, and then the bear market kickstart.
00:11:27.832 - 00:11:37.564, Speaker B: So I guess the question for you now is, what are some other things that you are now monitoring to signify that crypto has potentially bottomed or maybe a reversal is in order?
00:11:38.784 - 00:12:21.488, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the point about funds still remains. We do want to see when appetite will come from outside of the system. What I always talk about is, you know, closed systems and open systems. And within crypto being a certain closed system, we do need new funds to come in and invest into the broader ecosystem. Everybody has their team and they have their coins, and there's been all this like layer one versus layer one, or bitcoin versus ETH, and even down the list, when you look at options, vaults, people have their favorites there, and they have to compete, compete. But at the end of the day, we all need to kind of understand that we need money from outside of crypto to come into crypto. So we need those investors.
00:12:21.488 - 00:13:02.250, Speaker D: And I talked to a bunch of these institutional investors. I'm sure you do as well. And with the Luna disaster that happened, I think everyone is a little bit antsy even more now, kind of waiting to see what happens with industry. The Celsius news potentially that they just halted withdrawals is not going to help either. So I do think we're going to have quite a few months where a lot of the new money into the system will wait and see. That will create really good buying opportunities. If there is no liquidity, then certain assets will start to be quite attractively priced.
00:13:02.250 - 00:13:50.344, Speaker D: I think they already are, but could get very attractively priced. So I'm looking for interest still from traditional institutions. To come into the space is one thing, and then the other thing I always watch, I guess we'll talk about it later, is the narratives in the mainstream. So, like bitcoin's narrative, inflation narratives, what I've been always predicting is this is the type of environment, like the stagflationary environment is when bitcoin would start to pick up. So I'm waiting for signs of that in probably Q four. Early Q four this year is when I expect that investors will realize equities will not really save them and they'll start looking around for a different product.
00:13:51.564 - 00:14:08.324, Speaker B: Yeah, actually on that point, because bitcoin was often hailed as this inflation hedge for many years now. And now that we actually have record CPI prints, bitcoin doesn't seem to be getting any love here. So why do you think that is? And do you think that potentially invalidates bitcoin's inflation hedge case?
00:14:09.224 - 00:15:01.044, Speaker D: Yeah, people don't really understand what inflation hedge means or how to think about it. It doesn't really mean look at the CPI number, and the higher the CPI number, then the more bitcoin should go up as a hedge. It's more of a competition to the central bank system. So you have to look at the trust people have in the central banking system, and when it starts to break, then there is a need to potentially hedge that exposure to how much they're printing and how they're doing it. And I think that the trust in that system, in the monetary authorities, will really go down. When you're facing inflation, that simply doesn't go away, or they can't make it go away because it'll cause a recession. They'll kind of get stuck in the limbo.
00:15:01.044 - 00:15:44.394, Speaker D: My base case is still that we do not get like a very deep recession. I think we'll get a mild recession that will be inflationary in nature, and inflation will sort of continue to linger on for a while because as soon as it comes down, that'll be the opportunity for the doves that we have at the Fed to just take their foot off the gas again and let the economy start to inflate again. So that's the type of environment that I think people will really start educating themselves on. Why is this happening to us? Why is the economy in such bad shape? And once they educate themselves, I think the natural progression becomes something like bitcoin, which is outside of the system.
00:15:45.574 - 00:15:47.086, Speaker B: Hey guys, I'm really excited to tell.
00:15:47.110 - 00:16:21.280, Speaker A: You more about one of my favorite products in crypto right now, DyDx. This is a team I've known since 2018, and they've built one of the best exchange venues out there that also happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly. Now listen until the end, because there's an opportunity for savvy traders out there as well. And here are just a few reasons why I like DyDx over other exchanges. First, it's very liquid. It processes two to $3 billion every day in volume, and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording. Which means you can trade things like Ethereum, bitcoin, Doge Solana, and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today.
00:16:21.280 - 00:17:00.596, Speaker A: Second, it's also extremely cheap, and if you're down bad from the bear market, you don't have to worry about gas fees at all, because there is no gas fee on starkware L2, where DyDX is built on. Now that brings me to my next point as well. It's incredibly fast. Unlike other L2 and high speed dexs, you don't actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore. And as an additional point, by using Starkware, DYDX also provides users with increased security and privacy. And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature, which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so many different subaccounts. And their iOS mobile app is also live right now.
00:17:00.596 - 00:17:34.372, Speaker A: And it's amazing because it's compatible with Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Coin 98, Huawei Wallet, and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there. And it's available for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today. And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions. The most recent tier in the $10,000 equity tier, have won over $95,000 in rewards. And you can get started with as low as $500 in equity to compete for prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DyDX Dot exchange to learn more.
00:17:34.372 - 00:17:36.584, Speaker A: And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:17:38.884 - 00:17:53.784, Speaker B: Yeah, and how do you think that affects the rest of crypto? Is it? As you mentioned, there's a wealth effect that first has to benefit bitcoin before these other theses can play out, or do you foresee maybe a potential just decoupling of bitcoin from the entire space?
00:17:55.324 - 00:18:37.586, Speaker D: There's definitely a decoupling. There can be some strength idiosyncratically into other spaces as well. There are certain things that you can even consider them recession proof. Gaming, for example, is something that people might spend more time on in a tough environment. So if somebody very successfully creates some gamefi elements that catch on, those can do well. But for the most part, I think with digital assets, if bitcoin does well, everything else can can benefit from digital natives being able to put more money into their favorite tokens. ETH is going to be an interesting one.
00:18:37.586 - 00:19:27.384, Speaker D: I'm very curious to see what happens there. The really interesting thing about ETH is all the ETH maxis that I talked to have been sort of expecting this dip. Even someone like Santiago and a lot of other very strong ETH believers have been saying that they don't really have any interest in buying until we're at 1000. They're kind of more used to ETH having very large swings. So in terms of ETH, I think we'll have sharper moves, bigger down draws, and then potentially like bigger upside moves as well, compared to bitcoin, which is relatively going to hold up and just slowly accrue value potentially as its use case becomes clearer.
00:19:28.964 - 00:19:55.554, Speaker B: That makes sense. And I also want to kind of invoke this blog post that was written by Arthur Hayes pretty recently, and he mentioned that this Luna incident, this Luna disaster, as you call it, brought forward a lot of the pain that would have been drawn out because of this changing monetary environment and potentially challenging environment in the next few years. So do you agree with that? Do you agree that we front loaded a lot of the pain already and that perhaps the worst of the move, by magnitude at least, is behind us?
00:19:56.174 - 00:20:45.428, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, you have to agree that it's been shocking how quickly some of this has come down. You know, having 10% down moves in a day, you know, for multiple days, is accumulates very quickly. So I have to agree with him that a lot of it has gone front loaded. I think the Celsius thing right now is potentially accelerating that. So from a price point standpoint, I do think that the low is getting nearer and nearer. But at the same time, one of the things we have to be honest with ourselves in this industry is we haven't necessarily found use cases that have real world potential to the extent that we were hoping at this stage. And a lot of the l one, an alternative l.
00:20:45.428 - 00:21:03.344, Speaker D: One thesis is based upon apps being used and people using the block space, and that block space being valuable, and I think we're in need of new ways to use that block space and make it more valuable right now.
00:21:05.084 - 00:21:46.438, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with that. I think we've seen some pretty massive, um, use cases that were born in this past cycle, but it's definitely not close to the level that I think a lot of people were expecting, especially with things in, like. So, um, in a social vertical like web3, a lot of people were talking about social networks built on crypto rails, but that hasn't really fully occurred yet. Um, so I'm excited to see a lot of the development continue. Um, but I think one of the concerns that I had was with this whole Luna situation and Celsius. Now we're going to invite more overzealous regulations, which more might actually bar out a lot of retails who are the lifeblood of crypto from participating. And as you mentioned, it sounds like a lot of the institutions are kind of panicky as well about crypto.
00:21:46.438 - 00:21:56.514, Speaker B: So what do you think needs to happen to really trigger external capital to flow into this space once more if both retailers and institutions are kind of hesitant to deploy?
00:21:57.254 - 00:22:41.594, Speaker D: It's all about narrative. So new narratives have to get built, or even existing narratives have to get rebuilt, and that will drive adoption. I think institutions are more comfortable with crypto now because they've spent a lot of time analyzing it. They've had teams that they've hired to look at it. They may or may not have invested in small places, like in exchanges or something safe for them that they feel is they can look at as a normal business. So as that happens, it's increasingly safer to assume that when there are new narratives, they will be able to deploy quickly in terms of the regulation. Look, we always knew there was going to be some regulation.
00:22:41.594 - 00:23:33.104, Speaker D: It's always in their interest, and everyone's interest, really, for there to be some regulation. When they keep saying that coins are securities, I've always admitted that, yeah, most coins are securities. They act as businesses, like there are dividends or some sort of payment expectations for a lot of these coins. Maybe bitcoin and ethereum are commodities, but most other ones are indeed securities. And I don't think that means that they should be regulated in the same way that, you know, us equities are regulated, because we are dealing with a multinational asset class. But we'll have to see how they do it. I mean, we've had some signs that potentially the regulation will be quite even handed and will not be so bad.
00:23:33.104 - 00:23:40.344, Speaker D: It could end up being a positive and allow other firms that have not been able to invest to come in.
00:23:41.804 - 00:24:15.434, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I tend to agree with that. I think that's something that's probably long term conducive to the space and obviously to prices as well, but short term, potentially quite volatile. And I think Andre, the famous Andre and Defi, kind of brought up this point in a recent interview that he sees Defi forking into two paths. One is the regulated path, where you do everything by the book, and the other is the current kind of cowboy path, where most developers will probably stay anonymous and both can coexist without one destroying the other. So I think that view is quite likely as well. And I'd like to move on to community questions as well.
00:24:15.434 - 00:24:39.684, Speaker B: So one of our listeners asked that Ryan Watkins, who is a former analyst at Masari and current investor at Pangea Capital, he made a comment on Twitter about how it might be possible that we've seen bitcoin's all time high for the remainder of its existence, given that we just had a historical bull run fueled by unprecedented money printing. So what probability would you assign to that? Is that a thought that you entertain at all?
00:24:40.744 - 00:25:24.176, Speaker D: No, not really. There's a tiny probability. We have to always give some probability to the tail risks. You know, there are potential ways that bitcoin loses all interest, but I think it's very small chance. I think it's, like a 5% or lower chance. I can't really see how you can say forever. I mean, maybe for the next five years you could make the case, but I can't possibly see how $69,100, whatever it was in 2035, is going to be enough money to be able to acquire, like, you know, a bitcoin, which is limited supply, has huge mind share in terms of, you know, everybody knows about it.
00:25:24.176 - 00:25:52.914, Speaker D: There's very few people know in the whole world who don't know about its existence. And if you believe like I do, that, you know, there are certain Lindy effects, there's certain shelling point premiums, and there are certain, you know, you can call it, like, mythologies, really, like, the mythology of its creation that will last for, you know, decades to come. The chance that that was the high. Extremely unlikely.
00:25:54.254 - 00:26:06.594, Speaker B: Yeah. And our listeners also have some very tactical questions for you as well. So this is one of them. What are some things that you are monitoring to help you navigate this market? Any specific metrics or indicators that you find the most useful.
00:26:09.024 - 00:26:12.924, Speaker D: Are we talking about trading specifically or kind of like a broader sense?
00:26:13.944 - 00:26:16.016, Speaker B: Both, yeah.
00:26:16.080 - 00:26:47.524, Speaker D: I mean, the main one, which I've talked a little bit about is interest rates. I look at the interest rate curve. It's always being a leading predictor for the macro environment, for recessions. So there's two elements. One is the slope of the curve and one is the absolute level of the rates. So one thing that many people talk about frequently is when the curve goes into inversion. So basically you have long run rates below short term rates.
00:26:47.524 - 00:27:07.764, Speaker D: That means that they're expecting rate cuts, which means they're expecting a recession. That's usually the situation that you get a recession in. And every single time this has happened in history, it's like 20 times. Every single time we've had a recession in the next year or so. So whenever people say this time is different, they're always wrong. We're very close to an inversion. It hasn't happened yet.
00:27:07.764 - 00:27:40.660, Speaker D: I think twos and tens are pretty flat right now. We'll see if the curve inverts. If it stays sort of flat, then it's kind of more the scenario that I talked about, which is this stagflationary, not really recession, but life support situation. I look at it very carefully. I look at the absolute level of rates. I've been saying that, you know, as rates are accelerating up, it's a really bad time to buy. And recently they've been accelerating up.
00:27:40.660 - 00:28:00.844, Speaker D: So I would say number one thing that I look at is the rate of change of rates. And I can't really find myself getting bullish in a situation where rates have gone from two and a half percent back to three and a quarter. It shows that the Fed is going to bring on more pain.
00:28:02.664 - 00:28:12.644, Speaker B: Got it. And in terms of, I guess, general, are there crypto native metrics that you look at as well? Are those kind of less relevant in the context of macrometrics?
00:28:13.664 - 00:28:47.894, Speaker D: They're a little bit less relevant because I think they follow from sentiment. But of course, you know, I'm noticing how cheap it is to send an ETH transaction. I'm noticing, you know, the value of the block space on other l one s as well. So right now everything is cheap. It shows that the NFT mania has calmed down. We look at NFT transactions, there's, there's very few transactions happening right now. So also looking at volumes on exchanges, that's, that's a very obvious one.
00:28:47.894 - 00:29:04.854, Speaker D: It can be a little bit misleading because when you have a big price fall, then the volumes spike up. But then the days after they die out. So of course we would like to see higher volumes before really kind of seeing a sign that interest is coming back.
00:29:06.154 - 00:29:26.424, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think multiple traders that we've spoken to on and off the show have kind of pointed to volume as the single most important thing that they monitor as well. So that's definitely something to know for our listeners out there. In our last interview, you called Bitcoin the bellwether for the whole asset class. And with the merge coming up and more development happening outside of bitcoin, do you think that's still the case right now?
00:29:27.404 - 00:30:06.460, Speaker D: Not for the next six months, completely. So I think for the next six months, ETH is potentially equally bellwethery. I think that the merge hopefully reinvigorates a little bit of the, the altcoin hype and puts a bit more institutional capital back in play as people try to take advantage of that narrative. So in terms of a pure bellwether for the entire space, I would say that ETH has a very important role for the next six months, definitely.
00:30:06.492 - 00:30:22.824, Speaker B: And Jordy, we're now going to get to our vip segment and discuss more specific calls, maybe assets or themes that you're watching, which will be sent exclusively to our subscribers through our newsletter. But before we get there, what are some channels that our free subscribers can follow you on and follow more of your insights?
00:30:23.524 - 00:30:41.484, Speaker D: I mean, obviously Twitter is the main one that I post on at game theorizing. I occasionally write a medium article when I have a weekend off, which has not happened for a very long time, unfortunately. But hopefully soon, especially in a bear market, there will be more time to do that. And yeah, just great podcasts like yours as well.
