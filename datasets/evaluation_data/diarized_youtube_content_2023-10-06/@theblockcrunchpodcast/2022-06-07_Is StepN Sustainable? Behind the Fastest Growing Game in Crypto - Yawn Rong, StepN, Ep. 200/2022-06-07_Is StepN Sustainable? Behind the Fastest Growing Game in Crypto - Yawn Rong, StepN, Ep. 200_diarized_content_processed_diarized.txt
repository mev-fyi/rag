00:01:07.814 - 00:01:40.832, Speaker A: Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of Blockcrunch podcast. Now, I'm really, really excited to talk about one of the hottest products in crypto today, which is a project called Stepn. Now, Stepn is one of the most exciting stories in crypto this year because they are not just a play to earn game, they're specifically a move to earn health and fitness application that rewards users for moving around. And they first went live last year in December, and in less than six months, they achieved a record of 400,000 daily active users. And that actually might have changed now. So we're going to check on that in a bit. And also 1.7
00:01:40.832 - 00:02:03.844, Speaker A: million monthly active users on just the 26 April of last month, according to the team. And this is already one of the most downloaded fitness apps in the fitness section of the App Store today. So I'm really excited to dive into what is this move to earn phenomenon? How does Stepn work? And most important at all, is it sustainable? So I'm very excited to have Jan from the Stepn team on to discuss all of these. So Jan, welcome to the show.
00:02:04.004 - 00:02:05.984, Speaker C: Hi, how are you? Glad to be here.
00:02:06.524 - 00:02:12.624, Speaker A: Awesome. So you're calling from cold Australia. So is there a very vibrant cryptocene in Australia?
00:02:13.754 - 00:02:32.174, Speaker C: Actually on the east coast is pretty vibrant. Talk about Brisbane, Sydney. But again, Australia, you have isolated cities and the pers is okay in South Australia, it's a little bit slow, but you know, Brisbane, Sydney, definitely the place.
00:02:32.754 - 00:02:47.546, Speaker A: Got it. Awesome. I got to visit sometime because I've heard so many good things about the australian scene. We've interviewed a few founders from Australia before as well. But I guess first of all, I want to dive into what stuff actually is for people who are not aware. Can you help us explain just what is stuff and how does it work?
00:02:47.690 - 00:03:09.534, Speaker C: So we try to position ourselves as a lifestyle app now, basically with a little bit of a game element and social element in the future where people equipped with NFT sneakers and then they move outside, either walking or running, and earn tokens, which the token will be used to access a range of the in app game features.
00:03:10.714 - 00:03:19.538, Speaker A: And there's a mobile application for Stepn right now that people can download from App Store. And what do they have to do to start using the app?
00:03:19.706 - 00:03:58.772, Speaker C: So when we design it, we actually trying to onboard non crypto users. So we having that in our mind. So we build everything around the simplicities. So people download the app from the App Store, either the Google or Apple it download that, and then you need to create a decentralized wallet account. So basically people have to. That's sort of the biggest hurdle is to write down their sea phrases, back up the wallet. And once they have the wallet, I think the second hurdle is for them to deposit some cryptos to the wallet.
00:03:58.772 - 00:04:08.034, Speaker C: So either the Solana or BNB. So we're now running on two chance, and then they can start buying NFT sneakers. And then basically start move toward.
00:04:08.374 - 00:04:11.270, Speaker A: And these NFT sneakers are basically their ticket to entry.
00:04:11.302 - 00:04:11.446, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:11.470 - 00:04:15.590, Speaker A: So you have to buy the sneakers before you can start earning from moving around.
00:04:15.742 - 00:04:16.714, Speaker C: That's correct.
00:04:17.054 - 00:04:22.714, Speaker A: And these sneakers, is there different tiers of different NFT sneakers or are they generalized?
00:04:23.054 - 00:04:47.276, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, you have a lot of. We were trying to build. I think the sneaker system is pretty complex. So it has several spectrums. So you have the quality level five qualities, and then there's four types. And then within the four types you have like four attributes, and then you have four socket. So it's trying, we're trying to design this as an essential.
00:04:47.276 - 00:05:22.754, Speaker C: Like, you know, when you play video games, you have this item either is a helmet or is the weapon, and you can either enchant or you can have like a socket. You know, it's all the, you know, game element from MMORPG. Mmorpgs. So we want people to start with something simple like just one pair, and then gradually work their way up to a higher level quality. A higher level sneaker or higher quality sneaker so then people will spend in the app for a longer time, and then they will get a healthier body in the end.
00:05:23.294 - 00:05:32.844, Speaker A: So I know you mentioned there's different tiers of sneakers, and I know that the price are freely traded as well. There's obviously volatility in the price, but roughly how much do people need to.
00:05:32.884 - 00:05:49.264, Speaker C: Get started with stepn after the Solana crash? And the entry price now is much more affordable. It's about $600 to $800 to get started by one floor price, common sneaker.
00:05:49.844 - 00:06:03.274, Speaker A: So 600 to 800, that's still a relatively high entry price for an application. When you guys were thinking about, hey, should we make this maybe a free to play game versus a kind of gated game? How did you guys decide on that?
00:06:04.814 - 00:07:12.284, Speaker C: We think about the free to play, but again, when you design the app, having no sort of a barrier to entry sometimes is also not so good because then you have people flooding in, and then if you don't have the app ready to unbolt that much people, you're going to get into troubles. So we want to have a barrel entry, but then you free up that barrel entry by, let's say a rental system because, you know, so when app pay people good money for running or working, you will imagine people will want to game the system. So either they pay people to run or they do other things. So having a rental system in the end will be, I think, a plausible option in the long term. Because you slowly lower that barefoot entry, you're not going to just do with no entries barriers right off, right. Have higher barrel entry and then you gradually remove that.
00:07:12.744 - 00:07:29.444, Speaker A: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And I can see a rental market appearing for step and sneakers, and it's already appearing for different NFTs games as well. So it sounds like the core piece holding all this together is the fact that people can make money by walking around or running around. So where is that revenue coming from?
00:07:30.064 - 00:08:03.668, Speaker C: So you talk about the revenue, you're going to talk about two things. That's when people are getting the question, say once the user slowed down, and this is the end of the app. So you heard about this death sparrow thing. But fundamentally, we're going to explain two things. One is that where the money comes from. A second is what happened if user slowed down, meaning that eventually there's no money flow in and then you go into the death barrels. One where the money comes from.
00:08:03.668 - 00:09:09.894, Speaker C: So at the rapid growth rate, your money will come from people that are buying NFT sneakers. So minting NFT sinkers actually making pretty good profit and then people will be selling that to the NFT marketplace, to the other users, other user buys it and they get into the app, refer to their friends, families and expanding the whole ecosystem, because we are talking about the move to earn. So basically it's a healthier sort of concept than play to earn meaning and also with readily available access with the mobile phones. And also the concept people were targeting to a much broader audience, meaning that not limited to the crypto native, not limiting to the gaming industry or gaming ecosystems. So we talk about hundreds of millions of users around the world. So naturally you tap into a much, much bigger user base and enable you to grow for a very long time. And you use this very long time basically to build various flywheels and you starting to create value.
00:09:09.894 - 00:10:19.116, Speaker C: Because when we are talking about a enclosed ecosystem, like for example axie or other gamefab project, it doesn't have external energies. And I like to use the entropy theory here is that let's say Earth is a relatively enclosed ecosystem, but you have to rely the sun to provide energy for everything to thrive on the earth. And if as a project we cannot induce external energies to the ecosystem we create, then eventually user will slow down growing. And then when people are cashing out, then your token price cannot support it and then going down that aspiration. So what we're trying to do here is to use the length of growth, let's say six to twelve months, and we will build various value propositions. And I think with ASC, sneaker is one of them. So basically we encourage people to use the sneaker, basically have the show off functions.
00:10:19.116 - 00:11:13.124, Speaker C: So something almost we consider see the success of the bored apes and it has a social value there. And we're trying to create a range of social values. And basically people are not only willing to spend, they're also willing to show off their sneakers. So basically you create a constant sort of onboarding process for people spending the app. And when your collaborations with other projects or other sneaker brand, you actually are creating values and people are paying for this premium price sneakers. For example, you know, talking about ASX sneakers, you're trading around 50 bnb, roughly prepared. So people are buying for this other collectibles now rather than a functional sneaker that will earn them tokens.
00:11:13.664 - 00:11:53.014, Speaker A: Got it. So it sounds like there's some social value as well. And you actually asked a question that I wanted to ask, which is when we look at popular play to earn games like Axie Infinity, players basically earn revenue through their native tokens, the AXS token and SLP token. And that revenue has value because there's underlying demand for those tokens. There's maybe speculative demand, maybe investors are buying up the tokens. So does stepn also rely on the same kind of speculative demand to prop up the token price in order for walking around to be, to be worthwhile for most users? Or what are the most natural sources of demand for the native token for stepn?
00:11:53.324 - 00:12:19.322, Speaker C: So we talk about two tokens we have in the two token system. One is the GST. Basically people earn GST. As of now it's the game token using the GST to mint and the GMT on the governance side and also to improve the game functionality side. And that's another use. So we talk about the use of the GST. It's mainly being used as mintings.
00:12:19.322 - 00:12:28.654, Speaker C: And by minting, basically people are creating new sneakers and selling to the new users. And basically we will use that to onboard users.
00:12:29.714 - 00:12:47.138, Speaker A: Got it. And is there a recurring aspect to this revenue? So if I, as a step in user, I purchased some GMT token and I mint some GST tokens and I use that to buy sneakers, do you expect me to kind of buy more GST tokens down the road or is that the only kind of, you know, interaction between me and the token?
00:12:47.226 - 00:13:35.438, Speaker C: Yeah, so going back to the speculation thing. So we actually are trying to discourage speculations because we have seen several occasions where people are holding on the GST and then pump up the price of gsts. And at one point GST is about $40 per token. And so this has come down to how do we balance the game mechanics. And in this particular scenario where, you know, when we first have in the BNB chain, the liquidity of the G's is pretty low. And when people are holding on the GST price, the price go up to the roof and they have to be dynamically adjust. And now we are implementing a dynamic pricing strategy.
00:13:35.438 - 00:14:11.454, Speaker C: So basically changing the price as the price action moves. So basically just to tackle on the speculation, because when people speculate, I think normally the retail user are getting burned because if you buying all the GIC on the market and you're now selling the meeting cost is going to go up and then the person buying the sneakers going to buy at higher price. So I think curbing the speculation is actually what we are doing and we're constantly basically improving on that.
00:14:12.114 - 00:14:44.578, Speaker A: Got it. And I guess just to dive into that a little bit, you mentioned that the market for fitness or health or lifestyle is much bigger than just a gaming market. And let's say today, let's say roughly there's a billion people on earth that would ideally be potential customers for step in. And you do in the next 510 years scale to these billion people, how then do you, what happens at equilibrium? Who is still coming in to support the price of the tokens to make sure that it's still worthwhile for people to participate in this move to earn?
00:14:44.706 - 00:15:50.164, Speaker C: Yeah, so that's the reason we actually, so we start off as a Gamefi and we see what happened with the Gamefi project. It's a short lifespan, prone to pump and dump and have a niche market. And then the developers are constantly chasing after producing new content to retain the users. And as the game sort of lose the momentum going upward and it will fall and then going down that death barrel, so we see that and then we started to pivot away from a game file. So that's the essence of the lifestyle app, is you have the social and the game element. So we've talked about the game element, the reason that human as a social animal, they need communication, they need interaction, they need to sort of have a meaningful conversation once a while. And that's the reason that toward the end of the product lifecycle, we basically want to create a vibrant running community.
00:15:50.164 - 00:16:46.184, Speaker C: So that's the reason that we are actually doing a lot of offline event. So we are running like five to ten offline events at the moment. We have one in Greece, one in Japan, several in Japan, several in Australia, in Spain, we have several in us, and there are multiple in East Asia area. So when people are meeting offlines and they're creating a stronger social connection. So when we talk about web3 socials, we talk about the interactions with wallet, but interaction with wallet is very weak. And what we picture is that using a web3 app, and then you actually bring people together offline, and that's valuable and that's powerful. And people almost can use the sneaker as a vocal point for conversation, and then they are willing to pay for the social features in the app.
00:16:46.184 - 00:17:42.996, Speaker C: And then you actually turn this move to earn into a app that people are willing to spend for it because they want to retain their social status, they want to have a social presence, and they want to impress their friends or impress the community members. So this is a really a two tiered step, basically. So yes, people are making money and they are having a good time now. And as we expand, but with more and more people onboarding, they were starting to gradually earn less. This is inevitable that people are going to earn less. But when they are earning less, are they going to stop? I don't think so, because they already have the habit of exercising and now they're earning thousands of dollars a day. That's because the GIC is valued at either $4 on the Solana or $10 on the BNB chat.
00:17:42.996 - 00:18:43.744, Speaker C: But as the sort of the growth rate starting to slow down, I mean, if people earn $10, $50 a day, that's still much, much more sort of, I think the web two people are going to be impressed because we are now having more people onboarding that never ever used crypto before, and they are really impressed by how much they can earn. So let's say even they earn $10. So the earning bit will gradually fade off. But then as we are bringing more partnerships from external partners, so either we can work with another project. Say you want access to these millions of valuable users. How about you pay for this to our users? So they are making, let's say they are making, let's say $500 a day now, and that $500 are provided by Stepn. Let's say in a couple of years later they still earn $500 a day, but maybe only $10 as provided by stepn.
00:18:43.744 - 00:19:28.334, Speaker C: And then $490 are provided by either advertising sponsors or co branded sponsors. Or people want to access users by Airdrop their tokens. And really, in the end, there's no difference from the user side. They're still earning the same amount of money, but they are not provided by us, they are provided by the ecosystem partners, and they are also more willing to spend in the app. So that means the longer we grow, actually the healthier the whole ecosystem is going to be, because people are minting sneakers selling on the NFT marketplace today. But in the future, people will be willing to spend to access the social features of the app.
00:19:28.894 - 00:19:56.890, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. And I appreciate how you think about both sides of the market, because with a lot of play to earn games that we talk to, it's clear that they think a lot about the demand side, where the users come from and how much they earn. And all they do is basically print tokens out of thin air to reward these people. But they don't think about the supply side, which is where the capital is coming from in the long term. And it sounds like a lot of that will be from partnerships for you guys. You've already started with some of the partnerships. I noticed you guys partnered with, I think, SPF for a charity event.
00:19:56.890 - 00:19:58.674, Speaker A: Can you talk a little bit about that too.
00:19:58.834 - 00:20:43.648, Speaker C: Yeah, so we did that sneaker and basically we did auction on the FTX and there was, I think a Taiwan buyer bought it for 2100 sold. So then we basically agree with FTX. So the proceed will be donated to the charities of this and doing good stuff basically. So that's one, just one way we're doing that. So taking charity auctions. So we are basically exploring different directions on how can we onboarding more partners. So really you consider the sneaker as a advertising billboard.
00:20:43.648 - 00:21:14.034, Speaker C: So we can make SPF sneakers, we can make other celebrity sneakers and we can have co branded sneakers. It doesn't have to be a sneaker brand. It could be an IT brand. And so there's many, many possibilities. It's just about, it's really just how we're going to do the business development down the track. Bringing more partners to the ecosystem and providing values to the users as well. Providing value to the partners as well.
00:21:14.544 - 00:21:25.256, Speaker A: And based on your BD conversation so far, what types of companies are interested in this? Is it mostly sports brand that want to advertise their actual sneakers or you see a lot of different companies too?
00:21:25.440 - 00:22:36.180, Speaker C: Well, so we are talking to a few sports brand, particularly sneaker brands. So I think this is, we just started, right? So we basically want to roll out just couple every year at least. And then we're going to explore other type of ways, basically to encourage people to use the sneaker as a social identity. So we're going to release a panda skin, which is our own design, like a panda sneaker. And so I think we just need to be more creative on what we can do with sneakers. So, yeah, so either it's partnerships or like a particular special items. And, you know, just in the end, the sneaker, well, we want to create a sneaker, something like, you know, like how the PFP works, right? So you holding the genesis and you having perks and, you know, people value, you know, the Genesis sneakers and people value the special design sneakers and then they become like talking sticks.
00:22:36.372 - 00:22:50.156, Speaker A: Hey, guys, I'm really excited to tell you more about one of my favorite products in crypto right now, DYDx. This is a team I've known since 2018, and they've built one of the best exchange venues out there that also happens to be decentralized and mobile friendly. Now, listen until the end, because there's.
00:22:50.180 - 00:22:52.684, Speaker B: An opportunity for savvy traders out there as well.
00:22:52.844 - 00:22:54.220, Speaker A: And here are just a few reasons.
00:22:54.252 - 00:22:56.468, Speaker B: Why I like DyDx over other exchanges.
00:22:56.596 - 00:22:57.898, Speaker A: First, is very liquid.
00:22:57.996 - 00:23:36.492, Speaker B: It processes two to $3 billion every day in volume and has 35 perpetual swaps as of this recording. Which means you can trade things like Ethereum, bitcoin, Doge Solana and most of the most popular assets with up to 20 x leverage in the venue today. Second, its also extremely cheap and if youre down bad from the bear market you dont have to worry about gas fees at all because there is no gas fee on starkware L2 where DyDX is built on. Now that brings me to my next point as well. It's incredibly fast. Unlike other L2 and high speed Dexs, you don't actually have to wait to withdraw your assets anymore. And as an additional point, by using starkware, DyDX also provides users with increased security and privacy.
00:23:36.492 - 00:24:27.414, Speaker B: And my personal favorite feature is the cross margin feature which means I can seed one account with USDC and trade across multiple markets from there without needing to start sub accounts because I really hate managing so many different subaccounts. And their iOS mobile app is also live right now and it's amazing because it's compatible with Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Coin 98, Huawei Wallet, and a lot of the most popular mobile wallets out there and it's available for people outside of the US or sanctioned countries today. And one last thing, one exciting opportunity is their competitions, the most recent tier in the $10,000 equity tier, have won over $95,000 in rewards. And you can get started with as low as $500 in equity to compete for profit prizes. So if you're already trading, might as well get paid to do it. So if any of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend that you head on over to DYDx Exchange to learn more. And I thank them for sponsoring this episode.
00:24:30.034 - 00:24:54.584, Speaker A: That makes sense. And I guess there was one other competitor in the market that I've noticed as well, Sweatcoin, which some listeners might be familiar with, and I think their business model is working with potential sponsors and partners to sell products on their platform which users can buy with the native token they earn. Is that a similar type of sponsorships you guys are looking for? Or it sounds more like you guys are doing branded sneakers for your sponsors.
00:24:55.244 - 00:25:53.004, Speaker C: So I think swag, I think we studied their business model and I think they are the only company from the web tool space actually have a business model. There's many free earning apps that didn't know what they are doing about so they basically failed. And I think Switecoin is one of them that actually knows their trade but I think with us we are trying to take this more from a web3 perspective. So we are not going to sell items on the NFT marketplace, but it's more a co branded royalty sharing sort of collaborations. And really with us we are leveraging the brand reputation and also with our user base, so creating good synergies. So it will be more of a longer term collaboration because the royalty share basically will be something that long term.
00:25:53.624 - 00:26:20.934, Speaker A: And you made a really interesting comment about how play to earn is more like a bootstrapping mechanism where people are earning money, but over time you do need external sources of capital to keep that going. But looking across the play to earn space right now, almost none of the games really have a full plan for external source ethics capital. They're already relying on just minting tokens. Have you seen any projects that maybe seem sustainable to you or some projects that you guys took inspiration from when you were first starting? Stepn.
00:26:25.354 - 00:27:28.374, Speaker C: Just thinking from top of my mind, it's difficult, right? So one is that when we talk about Gamefi or move to earn, play to earn, you only worry about that issue when you have enough users and many, many gamefire project now having trouble bootstrapping the seed users. So I think that's again, the nature of Gamefi is because it's still crypto native and gaming. So how many people are playing game fast? Maybe a million and that's it. And then the game is also very fragmented. You want the other one, want the. It seems that a lot of there's a card type of games available on the crypto space and we see several first person shooting games. But I mean the game genre is already overlapping and you are competing in one particular niche within this gamefi niche.
00:27:28.374 - 00:28:13.904, Speaker C: I think really, I think the real question should be why should we need to only targeting to the gamefire crowd? Why not targeting to the bigger audience and open up the audience base? And then you will be starting to worry about how about we burning external partnerships? Because with the game it's really difficult because you are creating your own narrative, your own system. Everything is difficult for any external partnerships to tap into that. But I think with a sneaker, what I'm trying to say is that.
00:28:15.924 - 00:28:16.212, Speaker A: You.
00:28:16.228 - 00:28:51.072, Speaker C: Don'T need to have a lot of game elements. You will need a minimum amount of a game element, which means that it's malleable. So when it's malleable, you open up the opportunities for collaborations. If you have a particularly, let's say exe or any other games that we have, everything very systematically designed, it's very difficult to change it. If you change it, everything else going to be changed and then you're looking at so many work have to do that makes sense.
00:28:51.168 - 00:29:14.280, Speaker A: And I think looking at some more recent data, was there anything about the. So obviously you guys had a massive, massive, explosive first phase with a lot of users coming on. Was there anything about how fast you guys grew that surprised you? Or were there specific strategies that you guys did differently than most of these other play to earn games that allowed you to be one of the most played games in crypto today, I think.
00:29:14.472 - 00:30:03.092, Speaker C: We are very much focused on the product side. So we don't really. So basically everybody just works every day. So we're looking at. So we're very hands on on everything in the app, which means that we're very responsive to a lot of the bugs in the beginning and also feedbacks and we are able to iterate ideas. So I think that's the reason for building something simple in the front end, because that enable us to rapidly change things and without wasting a lot of time. So if we go in this direction, we spend a lot of energies on the cg and it doesn't work, we're going to another direction.
00:30:03.092 - 00:30:25.254, Speaker C: That's money and time wasted. So we are going very lightweighted on the front end that enable us to build a very robust backend and onboarding users and bootstrap and running activities. So I think product and community oriented is the key, I think, for us to enable us to grow, basically.
00:30:25.994 - 00:30:39.174, Speaker A: Are there any major features of the app today that is different from what the app looked like when you guys first launched back in December? Any major changes that you guys made as a result of this close communication with users?
00:30:40.084 - 00:31:27.168, Speaker C: Actually, no. Because when we first designed the app, we have a very. So when we. When we explore the ideas, we have all sorts of ideas in our game narrative, but when actually design. So we spend a lot of time to refine the ideas and to just cut all the clutters and necessary elements, just leave the core, you know, the sneakers and the energy system and, you know, so under the earning caps. So surprisingly that not many things got changed because you still need to have that consistency. If we change too frequent, the user will have sort of a negative reaction.
00:31:27.168 - 00:31:42.914, Speaker C: They think, oh, you don't know what your dog is doing, right? So if it doesn't, I think everything works fine for now with the older system designed, so we only are fine tuning it. We actually didn't do any major changes.
00:31:43.774 - 00:31:51.914, Speaker A: That's interesting. And I guess if there were major changes that you have to make to the application right now, what are some of those changes that you're thinking of?
00:31:54.054 - 00:32:41.784, Speaker C: Major changes? So I think, again, I think that's one of the reasons that we are doing well is because we have pretty experienced game producers. So we spend time to build the roadmap and also the game development document and then we stick to it. So surprisingly that we didn't do much of the major shift to our directions. So what we did is that we add in module, the game module, very carefully because we want to keep the gap very simple. And when it's simple, you actually can refer to new users quite easily. You tell people that I go out for a walk an hour and make $500. That's easy.
00:32:41.784 - 00:33:28.774, Speaker C: We don't want to over complicate the app, meaning that we are very, very conservative on adding new features. So since we start building the app, we only add one layer of complexity, which is the mystery box system. After thorough study, we're going to add another system in another one or two weeks time, which is a minting scroll system. That's another item. And we are probably going to add another batch system in the q three this year. And that's about it. So we are basically rolling out the plant sort of features.
00:33:28.774 - 00:33:35.454, Speaker C: And when we are designing new features, we are very, very careful of not adding complexities to the app.
00:33:36.114 - 00:34:16.546, Speaker A: And that word of mouth point you brought on is so interesting because stepn is probably the only application where I've seen so many different ads on places that I didn't expect to see crypto ads like Instagram. On people's captions, they say, hey, I'm earning money. If you click onto this link in my bio, you can earn money by just walking as well. So it's such a kind of easy sell to retails. And which lets me to think, in the long term, if there are more competitors in the market, is the biggest differentiation basically how much people can make. Like if an application comes out and offers the same thing, but instead of making you earn dollar 500 an hour, maybe they can provide dollar 600 an hour. Do people just hop on from app to app? And what is the moat over time?
00:34:16.700 - 00:35:38.496, Speaker C: Okay, so the mode, I believe, is the user base. And it's also about how you turn the economy around. Because really, who is that? Going back to the question, who is paying this $500, let's say, or let's say not $500, let's just say $100, right? For entry levels, who is paying that money? It is the same people that are onboarding new users, these same people that are upgrading their gems, the same people that are trying to get better sneakers, same people that trying to have more energy. So we talk about user doing transactions, peer to peer transaction to other users, and the user are consuming and spending and that's where the money comes from. And there's. So we are looking at about 700,000 daily users now and we're going to break a million daily users in June very confidently. So unless there another app that can rapidly bootstrapping users and having a super high demand for their tokens enable the first batch of user earning hundreds and hundreds of dollars a day, then application developers themselves have to pay for the initial play to earn revenues basically to the users.
00:35:38.496 - 00:36:26.246, Speaker C: And that is hard. So we start with the GST, about ten cent and all the way up to now. So because the user demand. So the new app have to be really having initial users not selling their tokens, but keep buying and then on the same time keep up with the growth. I think it's is a fairly difficult thing to do. They have to juggle on several sort of bolts and to make the balance. Because if you are not making the balance, you are having people dumping the token or you have people holding the token make the price going off the roof and then thinking new user onboarding really difficult.
00:36:26.246 - 00:37:26.064, Speaker C: There are so many things can go wrong with how can I say, if you don't having your hands on the pole for the market. And that really is testing the dev team's execution skills. So when we talk about the mode of competition, this is an interesting aspect because when you're looking at doesn't matter is a car or let's just say McDonald's and KFC, they look identical almost. You know, McDonald have fried chicken, KFC have fried chicken, you know, that will have burgers that will have chicken nuggets. So this is not about point of difference because you can only have so many point of differences. I mean, move to earn, it is a point of difference versus play to earn. But how can you make a move to earn app different from the other move to earn app? I think it's fairly difficult.
00:37:26.064 - 00:38:07.834, Speaker C: And even you try to make some different aspect. In most cases, users probably don't care. They care about what, they care about making their ROI back, making their investment back, and they care about how interesting the app is. And they probably care about how the community, if they can make new friends. As you can see that the initial need is always about the financial returns. But over the time, they probably gonna stay for the community, they're gonna stay for the gameplay, they're gonna stay for other things. But if you, the new sort of app, cannot address the initial financial incentives for the user, let's say they only earn like a dollar a day.
00:38:07.834 - 00:38:27.814, Speaker C: People say, why even bother? Right? So the initial bootstrap and also the how they kick off their move to earn is very important. So if they have one misstep and they're going to be in trouble.
00:38:28.474 - 00:39:12.464, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think with fitness apps especially, there is this engagement element where you don't want to break the streak. For instance, I think in web two, there are a lot of fitness apps where they track how many days in a row you work out or how many days in a row you're sleeping. Well, for games, you could replicate some of that element, but for fitness, I feel like there is an inherent kind of retention element to it, and there's also an element of I'm going to walk around every day anyway, might as well get paid to do it, regardless of how much. So my hypothesis is that retention for fitness apps, for lifestyle apps like Stepn, is probably going to be higher and less price sensitive than a play to earn game like axie infinity. I don't know if you agree with that.
00:39:12.844 - 00:40:01.448, Speaker C: Yeah, that's what we see. Because really people are actually, I mean, I think the most impressed user are not the people that are doing the exercise every day. I think the most advocate stepping user are the people that never did exercise before. And they can see how drastically they change on their physical shapes, they can see how they change on their energy levels, because, you know, people do not exercise versus people exercise regularly. You can see they feel different almost. They eat more, sleep better all around, healthier. So these are the people see the most significant transformation.
00:40:01.448 - 00:40:30.004, Speaker C: And basically they were saying that I don't give a, you know, damn about how much I'm earning because now actually I changed their lives and they have been more vocals about it. And that's, I think, how I think we bootstrapped the initial users and also for people that wanted to advocate and also create an offline event, those initial known sporty people.
00:40:30.764 - 00:40:41.464, Speaker A: And how do you prevent against botting or Sibyl attacks, given that it's such an easy way to earn money, why can't I just buy ten phones and then just put them on a treadmill?
00:40:42.444 - 00:41:35.694, Speaker C: You can't put on the treadmill because it is a gps track. So you have to actually move outdoors. And with multiple phones, we are not doing anything at the moment because there is too much demand. So temporarily, we are allowing people to have multiple phones and to work out simply because demand is much higher than supplies. But talking about anti cheating, it is very important because I think for many, many apps that didn't manage the anti cheating well, you are getting the hackers basically to print money in your ecosystem. It's almost like a counterfeit money, and then the count for money actually is the real money in this scenario. So then your token value will be much less.
00:41:35.694 - 00:42:46.834, Speaker C: So what we're trying to do is to have people actually doing the proof of workout, where when they actually spend energy, spend the time to move outside, and the token must worth their time. I mean that people are selling that at higher price. So we have done very extensively on the backend with the machine learning system and to identify people bought in or people are cheating. So you will see that with the basics, ongoing improvement, almost like ongoing improvement in the gps. So that's something that we are working almost continuously to improve, to make sure that nobody are earning the money in an unjust sort of manner, but with people genuinely moving outdoors with one or two phones, not at the same time, but let's say consecutively, it is temporarily allowed, as that there's more demand than the supplies.
00:42:47.734 - 00:43:07.794, Speaker A: So right now, Stepan only works for walking or jogging or running or outdoors. Activities that require traversal of distance. Is there a natural path to other types of exercises, like, for instance, ball games, which are. You won't travel far on a GPS, but you still burn a lot of calories, or just weightlifting. Are there other types of fitness that are on the roadmap?
00:43:08.914 - 00:43:39.444, Speaker C: I think the reason we pick walking or running is because everybody walk around. There's no skill involved, and there's easily can be done. You don't need to learn how to run, how to walk. So with any other type of sport is limited into different scenarios, even bicycle. You need to buy a bicycle to do it. So I think if we, I mean, we are already tapping to the biggest sport, general running, walking. Why do I need to tap into the niche?
00:43:39.524 - 00:44:06.904, Speaker A: There's no point that makes sense. I'd love to finally touch on the token itself. We did talk about this a bit, but there's two tokens in stepn right now. There is the green satoshi token, the GST, which is unlimited supply, and it's the token that most users are earning by walking around. And there's also the governance token, which is GMT or green metaverse token. So, can you help us understand why are there two separate tokens and what were the use cases for each of them?
00:44:07.474 - 00:44:48.176, Speaker C: Okay, so the GST are designed for being exclusively used in stabn. And with the GMT, it is more of a platform token. So if you're going to build more product down the track, we will all utilize gmts. So GMT will be across platform token not only on seven, but also on other things we build. And that's one and two is that GST will be used as almost a disposable, not disposable income. But people are spending GST without worry about the price will go up or anything because it's unlimited supply. So GMT are earned to be spent.
00:44:48.176 - 00:45:48.514, Speaker C: It's not to be earned by just holding it. So we need to give people sort of the expectation that the GST price GST is not the token that you're holding it, right, it's a token that you're going to spend it. And on the other side, GMT will be used one for governance in the future. Two will be used to access some of the high level game perks, for example, to redistribute the attribute point, to improve the game mechanics, and to subscribe in what we call the shorten fader pool, which is a pool that when other people are suffering, let's say, file under jam upgrade, the subscriber actually will get some gsts and also with other use cases we build in the future. So that's sort of the main differences. GMT is something that cross platform finance supply. The JT is something that exclusively using stampin and also influence supply.
00:45:49.294 - 00:46:02.834, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. And I think as we're coming to the end of the interview, I'd love to get your sense of what do you see as the biggest milestones for Stepn. Coming up, what are some of the biggest things that you guys want to achieve in, say, next six to twelve months?
00:46:03.204 - 00:47:06.714, Speaker C: Next to 612 months. I think we are constantly building a more robust system to onboarding the web two to web3. So I would say the biggest milestone is when we are onboarding, let's say tens of millions of web two users to the web3. So they're going to use stepn wallet as a first wallet and everything. The experience in stepn will be there first Webster experience, and then as they become more of a savvy Webster users, they can then onboarding and say, I want to buy these pfps or I want to do these tradings on this platform. So I think we want to be sort of really what we want to do is become the gateway of the web two to the web3, and we'll be able to tell them that, how to get the proper Webster experience. So I think that would be the major.
00:47:06.714 - 00:47:10.234, Speaker C: If we can do it, that'd be the biggest milestone we can do.
00:47:11.094 - 00:47:23.794, Speaker A: Absolutely. And I'm super excited to see anything that expands user base for crypto happen. So I'm really excited for step in and for people who want to check out the game or maybe to get an activation code or to follow you. What are the best channels for them to do this?
00:47:25.034 - 00:47:56.514, Speaker C: We are giving away now activation code in our discord. So we have the first discord, but it's 500,000 people. It's already reached the top max and we are creating the second Discord seven tool. Basically it is linked in the Twitter. So we do airdrops sneakers, we do airdrop activation code also on the Twitter and also on both Twitter and Discord. So that'll be the two main sort of community we're holding.
00:47:57.134 - 00:48:11.830, Speaker A: Got it. Awesome. I'm super excited to share that in the show notes below. And we're going to write a full report on this for our blockchain VIP subscribers as well. So for those who want the extra edge, make sure you're subscribed. Thank you so much for taking the time to come onto the show to speak with us, Yan. We learned a lot today.
00:48:11.942 - 00:48:12.294, Speaker C: Thank you.
