00:00:00.360 - 00:00:39.385, Speaker A: This was somewhere at the start of 2024 where Solana was breaking $100. People saw it go 10x and people were saying how it needs to cool off. And we took the pretty aggressive view that Sol would have a push to $200. At the time, I don't think many people shared our sentiment, and we were pretty cognizant of this. And we realized that there were still very strong fundamental drivers of why Solana would continue to receive flows. And so we put on a pretty aggressive long on solana at about $110, which we initially. Which we took off at about $190.
00:00:42.765 - 00:01:13.965, Speaker B: Welcome to On a Tangent, a special segment of the blockcrunch podcast. I'm your host, Jason Choi. Now, about two years ago, my friend Darrell and I left two of Asia's most successful crypto funds to start investing our own capital. And we called ourselves tangent. And since January 2023 to May 2024, we've about quadrupled our investing capital and also assembled a team of some of the sharpest people in crypto. So a lot of people are curious about what we've done and what we're doing. So we wanted to do a little bit of a recap and overview of the Tangent story so far.
00:01:13.965 - 00:01:42.341, Speaker B: So if you're a young analyst or an investor out there looking to join us, or if you're a founder who's looking for a truly crypto native team to work with, or you're just interested in our market views, make sure you make it through the episode. So. So this here is also an experiment. As you notice, we usually don't do these in a studio, but if you enjoy this episode, comment on YouTube or let us know on Twitter. So we know whether to keep this coming as either a monthly series or periodic series. But without further ado, here is the first. On a Tangent with my co founder and good friend, Darryl Wang.
00:01:42.341 - 00:01:47.325, Speaker B: And before we get started, nothing we discuss is financial advice. Welcome to the show once again, man.
00:01:47.485 - 00:01:52.741, Speaker A: How's it going? I see you every day, but obviously this time is a little bit different in studio.
00:01:52.813 - 00:02:20.771, Speaker B: It's a very, very overwhelming setting. But I wanted to start with our Tangent story a little bit. Actually, let's start with what Tangent is today because a lot of people are confused about what we actually are. I think I've gotten feedback from people that we're an incubator, we are a trading fund, we're a market maker. So I think just for the people out there who are not familiar, we're Basically a evergreen fund. Right. So we describe ourselves an evergreen fund in the sense that we invest across every life cycle of a crypto company.
00:02:20.771 - 00:02:31.271, Speaker B: But we actually haven't. We didn't start this way. So why don't we dial the clocks back a little bit to 2019 and talk about. About how we met. I think this is. Was it 2019 or 2020?
00:02:31.332 - 00:02:34.883, Speaker A: Well, I wasn't in the space in 2019, so it was 2020.
00:02:34.944 - 00:02:35.783, Speaker B: 2020, yes.
00:02:35.919 - 00:02:36.303, Speaker A: Yes.
00:02:36.359 - 00:02:39.079, Speaker B: And then I think you messaged me on Twitter.
00:02:39.167 - 00:02:39.439, Speaker A: Yes.
00:02:39.487 - 00:02:41.399, Speaker B: And you were in school then or.
00:02:41.487 - 00:03:10.215, Speaker A: I was. I was. I was an investment banker with JP Morgan, and I was just getting my hands wet or my feet wet, looking, dabbling into defi. And then one of the only really education materials out there was your podcast block, actually. I was like, oh, look, this is pretty sharp. Asian dude, seems around my age, and he's doing something really cool with this podcast. Let me tune in and listen a bit.
00:03:10.215 - 00:03:24.147, Speaker A: One or two episodes in, I really loved what you were doing, and so I just thought I'd reach out, and I'd never really done anything like that before. And then to my surprise, you actually replied, and I was like, wow, this space is pretty interesting because you can actually talk to people who run podcasts.
00:03:24.291 - 00:03:33.367, Speaker B: So did you really pick me first or Arthur first? So for reference, Arthur was your former boss at your last boss. Yes. Did you. Did you reach out to your former boss first or did you reach out to me first?
00:03:33.431 - 00:03:46.815, Speaker A: I believe I reached out to my former boss first. And then as we were talking about either before I was about to join him or after I just joined him. Then I started tuning into your podcast and then we started chatting.
00:03:46.975 - 00:03:51.799, Speaker B: And so you fast forward. Was it two years later we decided to start this thing together?
00:03:51.967 - 00:03:52.319, Speaker A: Correct.
00:03:52.367 - 00:03:58.613, Speaker B: So how did we decide to start? Tangent, because I remember it was also, I actually haven't met you in person at that time.
00:03:58.799 - 00:04:05.321, Speaker A: Yes, we actually met one and a half years in after knowing each other, I believe, and it's in Barcelona.
00:04:05.473 - 00:04:17.121, Speaker B: And I figured you might have been because you reached out to me and you said, hey, I'm thinking of starting something. And I just said yes. Like on the first call, I said yes. So you're probably not surprised because I've never met you in person and you're like, what the fuck?
00:04:17.193 - 00:04:19.849, Speaker A: I was like, yeah, this guy is. This guy's ready.
00:04:19.937 - 00:04:25.147, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So what's the story there? Why did you decide to reach out and kind of start this together?
00:04:25.251 - 00:04:59.473, Speaker A: Yeah, so it was a couple of things, I think One was I was ready for the next chapter in my career outside of working for a fund. And at the same time, I knew that I want. I didn't want to do it alone. And I wanted to find a partner that could really complement my skillset and my character. And I got to know you a bit better by then. We done some ridiculous investing together, both good and bad. I thought you were a pretty good guy, honorable, trustworthy, very sharp as well, very hardworking, and I thought you'd be a great partner.
00:04:59.473 - 00:05:19.005, Speaker A: And so I was like, if I was going to do something like run a fund or start something by myself, who would I want to do it with? And your name was on the top of the list. So I was like, hey, why not just breach the topic? And on the first call, you're like, I'm down. And we're like, all right, let's do this.
00:05:19.345 - 00:05:41.389, Speaker B: Yes. I was already thinking of kind of striking it out and doing my own thing as well. So I was. This is like four years into my last job, which is a long time in crypto. So I was like, okay, let's do something new. And I was kind of looking for a partner to do this, and I was actually shopping around a few different ideas. And when you reached out, I think your idea appealed to me the most in terms of, hey, let's just start with the two of us and just pull our capital together.
00:05:41.389 - 00:06:05.349, Speaker B: So we actually toyed around with the idea of, like, raising external capital, doing like a proper VC fund. But you've convinced me that it's not the right move. And I think we made a really great decision just because of what we're going to talk about later, which is why we're an evergreen structure and what it means. But let's talk about the old days first. Because we started off with a mentorship model, I think we basically reached out to all of the founder friends that we had, and then we found five of them.
00:06:05.397 - 00:06:05.901, Speaker A: Five or six?
00:06:05.933 - 00:06:20.085, Speaker B: Yeah, five or six of them that we thought were some of the sharpest people in the space and most helpful angels. And we just started co investing together. So tell us the story there. How do we assemble this team of crypto avengers and what happened there?
00:06:20.245 - 00:07:40.719, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, really, it was a sort of go to market tool that we were using as two people that were trying to break into the scene and make it out on our own. Obviously, there's a pretty big gap in relying on your previous firm's reputation and platform versus coming out on your own. I think a lot of People in this space also feel that at least people similar to us in prior positions would notice the difference between when you're with the fund and when you're by yourself. It's a whole new different ballgame. And so we thought, hey, we've made a couple of great friends over the past few years working with founders, mostly founders of protocols, and we know that they are pretty active or they want to continue doubling down and paying it forward by investing in the space. So why not let's have a bit more of a formal relationship with them where they give us some of the time to impart knowledge that they've learned via the experiences they've had from founding these companies. And in return, we help deal source, filter quality control deals and allow them to co invest with us with no fees, no carry, no nothing, just on a pure goodwill basis.
00:07:40.719 - 00:07:45.887, Speaker A: And that's really the original idea of how we wanted to start the tangent model.
00:07:46.031 - 00:08:23.891, Speaker B: And I think there was a lot of goodwill because we all did say together. So that was, I think, more than 100x for all of our mentors involved. So hopefully that was a good experiment. And these guys are not just business relationships with these guys are personal friends as well. Like you went to Thailand with one of our mentors on that trip, and then we went to a UFC fight with one of our mentors as well in Singapore. So a lot of these are personal relationships that we truly just enjoy working with these people. But at the end, I think after six months or so, we had to kind of revamp that model a bit, mostly because of the capital constraints.
00:08:23.891 - 00:09:09.365, Speaker B: Right. As our kind of fund size got a little bit bigger, we started to get sized out and we just kind of turn it into more casual but close relationships. So if we see investments that fit certain mentors, sometimes we reach out to them. But versus, you know, in the beginning, where it's very structured, where it's like every mentor looks at every deal and, you know, we schedule the time between the mentors and the port coast. So now we've become kind of more like a conventional fund structure, but with a twist in the sense that there's that evergreen concept. So you're actually the one who coined the term as well, because we were trying to figure out, okay, how do we describe this fund structure? It's not really just a prop fund, because prop fund implies like trading, only trading, but it's not really just an angel fund because we're not just investing in private deals as well. So what the hell is an evergreen fund?
00:09:09.825 - 00:09:51.815, Speaker A: So basically it allows us to support protocols and companies in every step of the way. Right. Whether you are at the idea generation phase in the pre seed structure or the normal conventional seed and series A rounds, all the way to the liquid markets where we can provide liquidity, provide capital in supporting these protocols on chain. Or it could be as aggressive as outrightly buying tokens on the liquid markets as well. We've done all of that in the past. We will continue to do this in the future. We think it's the best way to give compelling and comprehensive support to all our different port cores.
00:09:52.555 - 00:10:40.979, Speaker B: I think a big part of this is also because we notice what didn't work in other funds. Because with venture I think a lot of funds are getting so big that they can't possibly participate in seed rounds without completely messing up the cap tables. But at the same time, especially recently with the high FTV kind of meta going on, a low float meta going on, people are really focusing on going back to the days of fair launch, which means a lot of great opportunities and great projects might not even have venture rounds. So for crypto as an asset class with such a short liquidity window, it's not like equities where you build a startup and then 10 years later maybe you get an IPO, maybe you get an exit. This is like two months, you get a token. It didn't make sense to us to just focus on like venture structured deals. I think it made more sense to kind of look at it from first principles.
00:10:40.979 - 00:11:05.659, Speaker B: What are the best investment opportunities across the entire asset class. And if it happens to be a venture, we do a venture check. If it happens to be a liquid market, we'll do it. So the best example for this is really Athena. And so Athena, we were the angel investors in Athena. So we got in the very first round and then when they did a follow on round in a venture setting, we also did that. But then when they list the tokens, we also bought it at I think like 20x the size that we did in C check.
00:11:05.707 - 00:11:05.963, Speaker A: Yes.
00:11:06.019 - 00:11:36.647, Speaker B: And we LP'd as well and we provide an LP as well. So that is only possible in crypto. Like I don't think there's any other asset class where like a sequoia and web2VC would kind of, you know, buy your startup shares and then you know, market make for, for, for your shares if they get listed and then buy your shares after they get listed. Yeah. So I think this is a much more unique structure. And then one big part of it is also is 100% employ employee owned. So we had a big debate about this in the beginning because I was thinking, hey, we should just raise some money, do this at scale and not risk our own shirt.
00:11:36.647 - 00:11:44.807, Speaker B: But you actually convinced me to not do that and I think that was a great decision. So what was going through your mind when you were thinking, hey, let's make this an employee owned fund?
00:11:44.991 - 00:11:57.435, Speaker A: Well, I think. Well, number one, I'm extremely risk loving. I guess relative to the average individual out there, I would say that I'm willing to lose it all in order to.
00:11:57.935 - 00:11:58.959, Speaker B: Ideally not.
00:11:59.087 - 00:12:49.375, Speaker A: Ideally not. But in order to enjoy the super normal profits that you can get. In crypto, we understand that there are huge risks involved, but we want to expose ourselves completely in order to enjoy the upside. And so I also think that if you're 100% employee owned, it's also the purest form of investing because everything you have is on the line. You basically live or you die by the sword, you eat what you kill, et cetera, versus having slightly misaligned incentives. Where some funds are playing an AUM marketing game, other funds are, I guess, making decisions because of the fact that it's not their money. So even if things go wrong, it's not the end of the world.
00:12:49.375 - 00:13:10.363, Speaker A: And we've seen a number of these instances in the past where I look back at it and I say, maybe we can do better. And so I thought this was the best way to pit ourselves against the best competition there was in crypto. And here we are, we're still alive.
00:13:10.499 - 00:13:39.951, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's definitely better incentive alignment or at least it's simpler incentive alignment. I think the argument some would make against employee owned fund is probably it's not as scalable as bigger funds or like institutional funds, at least on day one. Right. If you go out and raise $100 million, unless you have $100 million lying around, you can't do things at the scale as some of these institutional funds. But at the same time, I think it does align incentives a lot more because your success is basically the founder's success. If, if the.
00:13:39.951 - 00:14:19.571, Speaker B: So the one interesting game that I see my VC friends play is they want to see markups. We're going to see other funds come in and buy, buy their bags, their investments at a later round and then they will mark it up on paper but listed yet and they could use those kind of numbers to go raise money. So that's part of the VC game. It's nothing to criticize, but for me it never really made sense because it's not real games. I cannot pay for lunch with paper markups. So I thought it was pure if we only get rewarded if we actually get to exit an investment and monetize the investment. So yeah, I think at the end this was a much cleaner way of doing investing.
00:14:19.571 - 00:14:58.763, Speaker B: So thank you for convincing me and rep pilling me on this evergreen employee fund model. So there you have it. That's the kind of structure and story of Tangent so far. So let's talk a little bit now about what we're investing in, kind of what we're actually excited about. Because I think over the past two years, as we kind of approach for me, my second or third cycle, for you, your second cycle as well, I think we have a better idea of what are actually things that are worth backing in crypto. So for us, I think the three main categories that we think of is zero to one stuff. First of all, that was the one category that we always talked about since day one.
00:14:58.763 - 00:15:45.521, Speaker B: So what we mean by zero to one stuff is just things that were not possible before that are enabled by crypto now. So an example of that would be like Athena as an Internet bond, they're creating an Internet native yield that you can't possibly do this outside of crypto. And then there's also things like prime which were investors on the liquid markets. So this is parallel. They're creating an AI based game which is also incredibly hard to do kind of outside of that context. So we also did SEI for instance, which is also when they first pitched us, they were a kind of defi only chain and they wanted to create the infrastructure for people to build the fastest perpetual dexs. So all of these are kind of enabling new behaviors that were not possible before.
00:15:45.521 - 00:16:17.613, Speaker B: And we're constantly on the lookout for these. So that's kind of number one big group. Number two group that we want to look at is what we call market for everything. So when we look at different applications, we realize that crypto's biggest ad in terms of user experience is adding a financialized layer. It doesn't necessarily make things faster, it doesn't make the UX smoother. So it's very hard for crypto apps to compete with web2apps on a pure user experience level. So it must compete on a feature level and usually that becomes some form of financial speculation.
00:16:17.613 - 00:16:39.905, Speaker B: So obviously the recent wave of social fi with things like Friend Degen we're big fans of and also we thought NFTs kind of fit into this paradigm as well. So we ourselves are not great NFT traders we are not. But we got involved with a guy who's very good at this. So you want to tell the story about Spencer Ventures and who this guy is?
00:16:40.025 - 00:16:43.593, Speaker A: I believe it was you who met him in the US if I'm not wrong.
00:16:43.769 - 00:16:49.335, Speaker B: Yeah, I met Spencer in, in East Denver and a dinner.
00:16:50.035 - 00:17:40.955, Speaker A: So yeah, we were planning or figuring out our NFT strategy in house and knowing that both Jason and myself, we have pretty dubious track records in investing in NFTs, we thought why not let's outsource this to one of the sharpest people in the space, Spencer. And so we ended up supporting his. I believe it was his first major fund, first ever fund that came out. It was a pretty small fund. I believe it was between the 5 to $10 million range, which we thought was the sweet spot. If you are an NFT fund trying to 10x in the next cycle, it gave you just enough firepower to play a couple of interesting games with a couple of interesting top projects. Spencer has gone on to acquire.
00:17:40.955 - 00:17:45.603, Speaker A: I believe he is the largest holder, the fund is the largest holder of pudgy penguins in the world today.
00:17:45.659 - 00:17:47.190, Speaker B: He bought all the 3ac pudgies, he.
00:17:47.242 - 00:18:29.859, Speaker A: Bought all the 3ac pudg and he's done a couple of very interesting things on the side in the Solana ecosystem as well, but mainly in the ethnic ecosystem. And I think his monthly LP calls are really just educational calls for us to learn more about the industry. And that's something I think we definitely want to do more of as we progress and as we explore ancillary fields where we obviously have no domain expertise and knowledge. But we want to find people who are at the forefront trying to find the next big thing in that I guess different field and support them where we can.
00:18:30.027 - 00:19:27.911, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think that comes back to the structure of the fund because if you're a pure venture fund, it's very hard for you to make these fund of funds investments. If you're a pure hedge fund, you also probably don't want to lock up your capital. But because we're employee owned evergreen style, we can just invest in fund managers that we think are experts in certain verticals that we want to get smarter on. So that's how we're playing the NFT kind of vertical and that fits into our market for everything thesis, which is that in NFT's cases it's basically adding a financial layer to art, to kind of any type of social applications. So yeah, quite excited about that vertical as well. And I think that the Last vertical that we pay a lot of attention to is what we call coordination networks. So if you kind of zoom out a little bit and think about what Bitcoin actually is, right, besides a digital money that people use to store their wealth, it's actually just a digital network that's coordinating a bunch of ASICS and GPUs around the world.
00:19:27.911 - 00:19:48.385, Speaker B: So that was actually the first actual depin use case. So people call it depin these days. But crypto has always been about coordination of resources. And resources can be physical resources, like the GPUs we see today with crypto and AI. But it could also be people. So you can coordinate efforts between people. So some of this might look like daos, some of this could look like just social communities.
00:19:48.385 - 00:20:38.323, Speaker B: So some of the bets that we've made in that arena, I think one of the most confusing bets for people when they look at what we invested in was Memeland. So I've talked very copiously about Meme Land. It was very much a founder driven bet. So Ray, the founder of Memeland, which is a social community that tries to basically coordinate community around OneCoin, he spent the past 15, 16 years building a business around just memes before crypto was even a thing. I would even argue he was one of the people who popularized the word meme in the Godfather, the godfather of memes in the modern context. So Richard Dawkins was the guy who invented the word memes, but then I think Ray was the guy who popularized it in the Internet context by building 9Geck, which is one of the biggest meme websites in the world. So that's kind of an example of how I think crypto could be used as an experiment to coordinate social communities.
00:20:38.323 - 00:21:03.517, Speaker B: So we see how that plays out. And then two of the other investments that I don't think have been announced. So one I can't talk about yet, but the other is called Amino Chain. So this is basically a blockchain that coordinates biobanks around the world. So I think you and I were both kind of foreign to the concept of what biobanks were. So when the founder explained to us, we were kind of, wow, this makes so much sense. So a biobank is basically a big, big fridge that stores human samples.
00:21:03.517 - 00:21:40.751, Speaker B: So hair, blood, semen, sweat, and people use these samples to develop drugs. But apparently when you purchase human samples for pharmaceutical purposes, there's a lot of obviously privacy related concerns. There's a lot of data that need to be transferred. You can't just take a vial of Blood from nowhere and then make drugs out of it. So the kind of standard paperwork for transferring of these human samples takes up to weeks to months and it's incredibly costly. So these guys basically came in and decided, hey, actually a blockchain can solve all of this if you store all the info on chain. So we're quite excited about that one and there's quite a few examples.
00:21:40.751 - 00:22:09.001, Speaker B: But just to kind of synthesize our major thesis. So it's mostly zero to one type of impossible behavior sort of enabled by crypto. There's market for everything, so financialized applications and then also coordination networks of people and resources. So that's kind of what we look at across the entire fund. But I'd like to kind of dive into the details here. What does that actually mean? Right. So I think a lot of people are probably curious about the war stories in the past year and a half since we started.
00:22:09.001 - 00:22:17.585, Speaker B: And also from the outside looking in, a lot of people also assume we're just venture. But if you actually think about it, you got your start in liquid markets.
00:22:17.665 - 00:22:17.985, Speaker A: I did.
00:22:18.025 - 00:22:41.555, Speaker B: As part of Defiance. I got my start in liquid markets as well because my previous employer, Spartan's First Fund, was a hedge fund. So actually we were able to apply, I think a lot of things we learned. And we managed to double the fund twice since we started about a year and a half ago. So let's talk about how we did that by focusing on some of the maybe the big bets that we got. Right. So you want to talk about.
00:22:41.555 - 00:22:50.171, Speaker B: Let's pick anyone here to talk about. Let's talk about the Solana call first because that was a kind of consensus trade, but we managed to kind of catch on to that as well.
00:22:50.343 - 00:23:23.205, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I guess Solana was interesting. I think this is sort of midway through the altcoin pickup. I would categorize the bull market really starting to take off as being in October 2023. So we're about nine months from that already. This was somewhere at the start of 2024 where Solana was breaking $100. People saw it. So I'd go 10x and people were saying how it needs to cool off.
00:23:23.205 - 00:23:55.841, Speaker A: I think the parabolic one is over. And we took the pretty aggressive view that Seoul would have a push to $200. At the time. I don't think many people shared our sentiment. I think a lot of people were trained in the very PVP regime and were conditioned to sell outperformance. And we were pretty cognizant of this. And we realized that there were still very strong fundamental drivers of why Solana would continue to receive flows.
00:23:55.841 - 00:25:14.805, Speaker A: And so we put on a pretty aggressive long on solana at about $110 which we initially, which we took off at about $190, call it in March this year. So that was one example of us making market calls which is really our day to day, I guess, main priority. But I can go through a couple more of the more idiosyncratic names that we've been studying ever since the start of Deep in the Bear names like Stacks, for example, Akash, Ronin. These are all, I guess house favorite names that we have bought in the past and they've all done phenomenally well over the course of this cycle. At least I believe, if I'm not wrong, 10xing in most cases, at least from the bottom till their highs. Maybe not now, but yeah. So a lot of the day to day work that we do is researching these kind of names, trying to find the compounders that can continue to keep up with the market's strongest winners or obvious is the strongest win in the market.
00:25:14.805 - 00:25:49.075, Speaker A: But we do a variety of different things as well. These are the longer term, 6 12, 18 month thesis driven type of stuff. Correct type of positions. We also trade on a slightly lower time frame as well. This is typically stuff that a part of the team does with me. I think an example of an interesting idea that we had was putting on a Degen position, I believe in March as well, shortly after we rotated out of Solana.
00:25:49.155 - 00:25:51.451, Speaker B: What is Degen for people who are new to this?
00:25:51.523 - 00:26:30.369, Speaker A: So Degen is. It initially started off as a pure meme coin on base and it was popularized. I'm not sure whether good or badly because VCs actually took a stake in Dijon and I think it got a bit of flak for that. But it began being accepted as the in platform or in app currency for a number of interesting social fire platforms. Right. I think Farcaster uses it as its main tipping mechanism and I believe a couple of other smaller applications. I think Dracula was one of those that really kickstarted that big run for Degen in March.
00:26:30.369 - 00:27:38.311, Speaker A: And that's where we really got the idea right. Because socialfire was something that was on our horizon for the longest time and we saw Degen as potentially a good shelling point for not only the base ecosystem, but also the far caster ecosystem which I think a lot of people wanted exposure to. And so I guess in a span of two to three weeks we were aggressively buying Degen sometime in March and I think Shortly after that Degen had this parabolic move up I think from the bottom to the top it went up like 30 or 40x. And we walked away with that as I think one of the top three entities in the world by P and L. So that was a pretty good win. That is an example of the more shorter term type of plays that we make at Tangent. So we're not just a long only oriented venture fund or sort of, I guess fundamental deep value investing fund.
00:27:38.311 - 00:27:49.487, Speaker A: We also try and play the games that everybody or I guess the more the degens out there also play. So yeah, that's one example of that.
00:27:49.551 - 00:28:22.533, Speaker B: I think that actually. So that's calls an interesting question because a lot of people think hey, trading and venture are very, very different things. And I've always been on the view that if you're very, very good at venture and very long term investing, you're probably not that great at trading or kind of monitoring attention flows. And if you're very good at that, you're probably not great at venture. That's true. So I think this is why this partnership is very interesting, which we'll talk about later as well because of how differently our brains are wired. But I actually think the two are more complementary than people give it credit for because we are constantly monitoring for these opportunities.
00:28:22.533 - 00:29:15.995, Speaker B: We're constantly trying out everything on chain, right? So we knew about Degen, I think way before most people in the world did because I was already getting tipped on Degen on Forecaster months and months ago. And we constantly try out every single application that comes out. So we're able to capture the moments when we see kind of breakout hockey stick growth. And that actually feeds into the longer term venture thesis as well because it helps us understand hey, where the user attention is going and what are the lessons we can learn from projects that successfully capitalized on attention and also projects that failed to capitalize on that attention and it just kind of came and went. So like Forecaster is a great example of this, right. You look at the user chart up into the right over time and then you kind of expect like most social fi apps for it to kind of collapse and then just stay there. But then they actually made a revival and that coincided with the rise of the Degen token.
00:29:15.995 - 00:29:58.303, Speaker B: So that was actually a big lesson in terms of the usefulness of tokens to incentivize usage. And it wasn't just the token, obviously there was style frames and so on. But yeah, so the kind of monitoring these, I think a lot of the longer term Investors, they try to tune out the markets completely so they don't pay attention to what's happening on chain, what are people excited about? And then some of the traders tend to kind of completely ignore the longer term. Hey, what's happening on the technical development? What are the latest in zk? I think for a successful crypto firm as an investment fund, you need to be able to play both games to be truly, truly comprehensive. And that's a controversial opinion because people think that there shouldn't be strategy drift. Right?
00:29:58.399 - 00:30:19.505, Speaker A: Yes. And that's. And I would argue that they're correct if only one person's at the helm. Because as you said, you know, not one person can't be a master in both different fields. Right. But that's what we do on a day to day basis. We have very clear delineated roles in the function with very clear responsibilities.
00:30:19.505 - 00:30:26.401, Speaker A: And I believe this complementary skillset allows us to perform well in the different areas of crypto.
00:30:26.513 - 00:31:11.747, Speaker B: Yeah. And since we've given one example about a kind of big trade gone right, I'd like to touch on kind of the longer term fundamental bets that we made that were correct as well. So you mentioned stacks, Akt and Ron. I think those are really great examples because they are emblematic of the three biggest verticals. So how we made the decision to buy stacks, I think early 2023 and early 2023 also for AKT and 2023 for Ron, was basically that we think, hey, there's like three things that crypto seems to be good for is AI, is probably gaming, is coordination of resources. And in which case for Akash it's AI, it's gaming. And then also bitcoin seems to be the only thing that was going up in 2023.
00:31:11.811 - 00:31:12.219, Speaker A: Yes.
00:31:12.307 - 00:31:48.465, Speaker B: So from that lens we started to look at, hey, what are some good opportunities to play this. And then with Stacks, we've known the team for, I've known the team for a long time, since Spartan and they had the big Nakamoto upgrade coming on as well. What caught us by surprise was actually the whole ordinals and rune thing that was taking off, which was add a tail wins for that. But that really added to the bet. And then for Akash, I think we were also just looking at different GPU networks and we realized the most interesting kind of organic growth was coming from Akash. And we established a relationship with the team. I spoke to them over months.
00:31:48.465 - 00:32:05.937, Speaker B: We still have a group chat, brought them on the podcast to learn about them. So that was another example. And then The Ronin thing was very interesting to me as well, because it was a very favorite coin in Asia, but I don't think a lot of our friends in the west were even paying attention to it.
00:32:06.001 - 00:32:06.577, Speaker A: Yes.
00:32:06.721 - 00:32:30.561, Speaker B: So for Ronin, I remember the entire BD strategy was just focused on selling to Asia. And obviously we were both around when Axie first took off. The biggest game on Ronin at that time, and then Pixels came around as well. Do you want to kind of talk about the kind of Ronin thought process, how we navigated that, kind of what gave us the conviction to play there?
00:32:30.713 - 00:33:06.575, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think the base thesis was that gamefi was always going to be a recurring theme in the next cycle. I think we saw that with Axie Infinity. We're still waiting to see what the next successful variation of that can be. Hopefully it comes this cycle. But we also were cognizant of the fact that we were not gamefi experts. Number one, we are not gaming investors. And I think investing in games is very akin to investing in NFTs, where you need to have certain domain expertise in order to make the right calls.
00:33:06.575 - 00:34:19.563, Speaker A: And we didn't have that. So what we ended up deciding to do was finding the best proxy for gaming ecosystems out there that we think, okay, if we have three different ecosystems in gaming today, which is the most likely place where we're going to find one of these next big hits. And we thought that Ronin was a very good contender for it. We still do today, mainly because of their proximity to the Southeast Asian landmass where so many of the past or prior people playing Axie have shown exhibited patterns of behavior that they're willing to try new things. I think the team at Ronin is one of the best in the business in terms of understanding how to build a gaming ecosystem, being able to push the marketing, being able to ensure the pipeline of games that are launching is of sound quality. So for us, that was a very clear bet as a fund and it was the default until we saw that Right. Gaming title Surface.
00:34:19.563 - 00:34:26.067, Speaker A: And I think so far we are not able to make the claim that we've seen it yet this cycle.
00:34:26.171 - 00:34:27.307, Speaker B: Except Pixels.
00:34:27.491 - 00:34:36.942, Speaker A: Pixels is one of the potential contenders still tbd. But yeah, so I think Ron. That was the thesis for Ron.
00:34:37.078 - 00:34:45.974, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think for Ronin, one big thing that got us excited is because we know that for crypto it's really all about distribution, especially on the app layer.
00:34:46.014 - 00:34:46.478, Speaker A: Right.
00:34:46.606 - 00:35:31.855, Speaker B: And so for distribution is really the most valuable currency. So when we see a project that is actively turning down projects that really want to build On Ronin, that makes me realize that these guys have way better distribution than most. Because there was one example, I think this is a few months ago, where there was a game that was kicked off Ronin for under delivering. And you never see that in any other L1s because all the L1s would just basically welcome any app with open arps, just so they can slap another logo on there and say, hey, we have like 200 or bazillion applications with like four users on our chain. But then Ronin was the one that was like, this is a legit company. There's like, they're actually building something, but we're going to kick them off because they're not shipping fast enough. And that made me realize, okay, these guys have insane distribution because they're so confident that they can kick off projects from the chain.
00:35:31.855 - 00:36:00.115, Speaker B: And then number two is also because they've done it before, right? They have gotten, I think, 3 million daily active users for Axie, which is not a number you see in crypto ever. And the fact that they onboarded all those users means they can activate them again. So one of the kind of gambits that we took was that maybe they can reactivate this user base for their next titles. And they kind of did. With Pixels, I think you mentioned recently it was like 2 million active users or so on.
00:36:00.455 - 00:36:03.583, Speaker A: I think it was about a million active users MAUs. Yeah.
00:36:03.639 - 00:36:41.419, Speaker B: So they were still able to activate their existing users. So for us, kind of Ronin is the distribution play. So I think that is a good example of a kind of longer term thesis driven play that we're able to manage over time, but kind of going back to some of the shorter timeframe plays as well. So one of the big plays we made was also buying ETH ETH btc, which was originally an idea serviced by our colleague Ryan. So let's tell us the story there. So what is with the ETH play? Because I was actually initially not on board with this, but I was convinced otherwise.
00:36:41.547 - 00:37:33.577, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think it initially came across when I was discussing this with Ryan and this was, I guess, 10 days before the ETH ETF deadline. And we were just remarking how poor sentiment was for eth and that if the rejection was to happen, it was probably going to be priced in. And so we thought, after realizing that, we said, hey, there's actually a trade here. Which is, well, number one, if the rejection, if we're correct, if the rejection is priced in, then chances are ETH BTC as a ratio was probably not going to go down any further than it had been. And that ratio has had already lost a three year range and was just absolutely getting massacred. And I think the range was like 0.05 to 0.08
00:37:33.577 - 00:38:06.353, Speaker A: and recently lost that range and it was trading to 0.045. Everyone on CTE was calling for 0.03 at least before everybody hated it. So it was a combination of. Not just. It was a mixture of apathy and also outright hate for ETH at that point. So we thought, hey, why not? There is a ton of option value baked into it in case the upside or we won the lottery.
00:38:06.353 - 00:38:43.035, Speaker A: And for some reason the ETF actually got approved which actually turned out, that's what happened. And it was absolutely not priced in. You would not have been able to catch that move if you didn't already have a position. And so we obviously got really lucky in a sense where we bet on call it a 10% odds of something happening. And it happened. But we got it at such a cheap price that even if we were wrong we probably wouldn't have lost money. And so we ended up putting in something like half the fund in an ETH BTC position and ended up doing okay.
00:38:43.035 - 00:39:05.393, Speaker A: Because in the span of I think three days after we finished building our position, the change or the re weighting of the probabilities for the ETH ETF started happening. ETH moved from 3k to 3.6k really quickly. Now it's at 3.8. So all is well in tangentland.
00:39:05.569 - 00:39:35.691, Speaker B: Yeah, so it was actually an interesting play because I will confess that I'm not the best at lower timeframe trading. I'm more of the kind of of longer time frame thesis. And then for some of the shorter time frame or medium time frame things, I rely on our team to kind of give me that color. So that informs a longer term thesis to see what I need to re underwrite. So I didn't really have a really great read of where ETH was going. I think I was in the camp that I was looking at the user numbers as a typical kind of long term investors. I'm looking at user numbers.
00:39:35.691 - 00:40:25.577, Speaker B: I'm like, everybody's using the retail chains, everybody's in Solana, all the apps are coming on Solana. You look at the airdrop value, it's the biggest on Solana and everybody's using base and blast. Nobody's coming back to Eth1 like what is the trade there? And then the other part of why I was skeptical as well is because I figured that for Bitcoin, we had so much time since 2008 to talk about digital gold and this narrative really permeated Trife mainstream. So no one doesn't know what bitcoin is anymore. If you go on the street and ask everybody, I'm sure they've heard of bitcoin, they understand, at least conceptually what it is for eth. It was getting more and more confusing every single year. And we did an episode about the disaggregation of eth, where last cycle you want a long eth, you just buy eth and then suddenly you have to factor in the L2s now because execution is happening on L2s.
00:40:25.577 - 00:40:49.965, Speaker B: So if you look at the founders that are building on ETH, no one's building on L1 anymore, except Athena, actually. So you have to buy the L2 tokens as well. And then this cycle you started to have this aggregation of the DA layers as well. So you can't just buy eth, you got to buy the DA tokens. So it's way too confusing of a tech bet. So for me, in my mind, bitcoin was always a macro bet and an ETH is always a tech bet. And to me, the tech bet has not permeated mainstream consciousness.
00:40:49.965 - 00:41:15.283, Speaker B: So I was very dismissive of the etf, even if it was approved. But I think what you guys were able to do was think from first principles and basically illustrate the two legs of the trade. The first leg is because everyone within crypto is under positioned, as long as they reposition, you can have some pretty spectacular outcomes. The second leg has to do with the actual ETF flows. So that was actually a variable that wasn't even relevant at the time of the trade.
00:41:15.299 - 00:41:15.923, Speaker A: It was, yes.
00:41:16.059 - 00:41:38.354, Speaker B: So kind of helping me be able to see that was kind of what brought me over the board. And we managed to do very well on that one. So, yeah. Good week. Good week for Tangent. Now we've spoken about some of the good times, so I want to make sure that we talk about some stuff that we were wrong on as well as fundamental investors. So one of the big fundamental bets that we did early was it 2013 for Rolbit?
00:41:38.470 - 00:41:39.515, Speaker A: 2023? Yes.
00:41:39.631 - 00:41:48.223, Speaker B: So yeah, 2023 was Rolbit. So for those who don't know Rolbit was. Why don't you give the story on what Rolbit is actually and why we took a position there?
00:41:48.359 - 00:42:40.885, Speaker A: So I think one of the big things within the depths of the bear market, I think gambling was an activity that saw a lot of traction and pickup. Because people were obviously all degens in some way and we just need to speculate. And in a dead market they end up going to casinos to speculate. And so Robit was this absolutely, absolutely mind boggling growth machine in a sense of how much volume they're doing, how much fees they were generating. There was this element of are the fees real, Are the numbers real? We did quite a bit of work to conclude that, I think with reasonable confidence that I think the numbers were real. And so we thought this was a great business. This likely is.
00:42:40.885 - 00:43:31.695, Speaker A: And because they were sharing their statistics on a public dashboard in real time, we thought we can track these numbers in real time. I can't remember the exact numbers, but by a traditional equity framework this was a fantastic business growing at phenomenal ways. And so we thought, hey, why not put this on as a core position for Tangent? Turns out most people, once the bull market comes back on, leave the casinos. And because actually it's a casino token, the other exchanges just absolutely refuse to list them because of whatever reasons.
00:43:31.855 - 00:43:33.167, Speaker B: KYC maybe.
00:43:33.271 - 00:44:11.585, Speaker A: Yeah, kyc. Competitive issues, yada yada. So without access to tier one exchanges, robot could never be placed in the hands of the big marginal buyers that could really push this to a valuation to what we thought was fair. And so after recognizing this, we realized we were playing a fool's game. We were trying to apply equity frameworks to crypto and while that may succeed in 10 to 20 years, once the space has fully matured, doesn't exactly work now. And so we held that position for I believe it was four to five months. It was a painful four to five months.
00:44:11.585 - 00:44:28.055, Speaker A: We didn't exactly lose a ton of money, but we didn't make money. And it was a huge cost in terms of opportunity cost to us. So that was an example of how we thought we were being smart. In fact we were just 100 IQ and we didn't make any money.
00:44:28.175 - 00:45:02.575, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think that's a great example of illustrating how fundamentals and thesis driven investing could come into conflict with the shorter timeframe aspects or the liquidity aspects of the game. Which is why I think for a successful team you need to look at both. So what I mean by that is for us, our thesis, one of the three thesis like zero to one, market for everything, coordination networks. I think Robit firmly fits into two, which is market for everything. They're creating kind of a casino. It's technically not fully on chain as well, but there's that aspect of kind of financialized games.
00:45:02.575 - 00:45:51.007, Speaker B: So that kind of hooked us in to start looking into it. And then we started diving into the fundamentals, the actual revenue. We tracked all the token burns. We put some models to make sure that, hey, these numbers track check out. But then that came into conflict with both market timing, which is bull market coming back, and users tend to go to higher risk activities during a bull market instead of just in a casino. And number two, the liquidity aspect, which you mentioned as well, which actually a lot of founders ignore for some reason, particularly in deepin sectors. When I talk to deepin founders, a lot of these founders come over from the hardware space, right? So they're creating these networks of GPUs, CPUs, what have you, and they think that, okay, just as long as I create a great network of these hardware components, then we can have a great token because the market will price it in.
00:45:51.007 - 00:46:21.465, Speaker B: But that is not true in crypto. I think it's so inefficient that fair pricing doesn't happen unless there's sufficient liquidity and the game is relatively solved. So a lot of Deepin founders focus so much on the hardware side, they forget that the token itself is almost a separate product. And this applies to any protocol out there as well. I think for any project that has a token, you actually have two products, right? For founders out there, you have the actual product that people use and you have the token. And they require different roadmaps. They require almost the same amount of attention.
00:46:21.465 - 00:46:48.215, Speaker B: This is why I always advise founders in an early stage to not do a token until your product is, you know, has reached product market fit and you know how to scale this. And then you push the token because you cannot ignore one and just focus on the other. And I think that was the case for Robit. They kind of focused on one and the token. Sure, they had the token burns, but they just couldn't figure out the liquidity aspect of it. So they never really got to being kind of fairly priced by market participants.
00:46:48.515 - 00:47:15.945, Speaker A: I think if they played their cards differently and they were cleared legally for what they were doing internationally, and they somehow managed to get tier one listings, it would not be unreasonable to assume gold based at a 10 billion market cap today. I think the numbers, if it's real, would warrant such a valuation. But unless we are in crypto, because.
00:47:16.025 - 00:47:46.655, Speaker B: They also had the distribution, they had so many users that were not in crypto and they're coming to crypto the first time. So that was actually a very strong thesis for kind of distributing, owning the distribution and maybe expanding vertically. So they could create more per pairs, they could become an exchange. So the dream was very big actually and the fundamentals supported it, but it didn't work out. So that was one example of bet gone wrong. But I think because of our abilities to risk manage, we actually didn't get hurt.
00:47:47.155 - 00:47:48.867, Speaker A: We lost like 15%.
00:47:48.971 - 00:48:14.605, Speaker B: Yeah. But it was like a big opportunity cost. But I think that comes back to kind of being able to manage risks correctly. Which kind of leads us to the next part which a lot of people are interested in, which is our investment process. So in terms of how the Tangent team is structured, so a lot of people hear from us on Twitter, but actually we're a bigger team as well. Do you want to talk about the philosophy of structuring our team the way it is currently and how we're doing that?
00:48:15.105 - 00:49:02.577, Speaker A: So right now we have, well, you take care of the venture side of things almost completely. I take care of the, I guess lower time frame trading on the centralized exchanges and we co manage a much larger proportion of the book. That is the spot book where us plus the rest of our team generate spot ideas, consistently re underwrite them and hold them anywhere between one month to I think as far as 12, 18 months. So that's the three different sub strategies of how Tangent is structured right now I would say we're doing pretty well across all three segments. Obviously things can be improved, but.
00:49:02.601 - 00:49:27.841, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. So I think for the spot book that's where things like Stacks Akash Ronin came in. Right. Where we have a thesis, we underwrite these things, we reach out to the team, we talk to them, we kind of help them, support them in different ways and then we have a core position that we just purchase on exchange. So I think this structure allows us to straddle all the timeframes. So the venture timeframe is really like four years, four plus years. Right.
00:49:27.841 - 00:49:49.581, Speaker B: Because we're not SAF flippers. So I do not like SAFT flippers. I don't like people who buy safs and then flip them in two weeks and claim to be long term investors. We don't do that. So we actually hold these things for years and years. And then for the spot book, depending on the market narratives, depending on what are interesting bets at the time, depending on opportunity costs, as you said, it could be we could be re underwriting things in one month. If we're wrong, we get out.
00:49:49.581 - 00:50:23.027, Speaker B: But if we're correct, we can hold them for also 12, 24 months. And then the trading book is where we focus on maybe lower timeframe Ideas that are more attention driven. So actually a lot of the meme coin behavior fits into that as well. So we've built a team specifically to be able to cover all of these. So at first I was a little bit apprehensive of the idea because I thought, okay, this sounds like strategy drift, right? You're hiring people with different personalities. But at the end, it's actually the entire team came together and started making decisions with inputs that are just. You would not have thought of if your entire team is the same personality.
00:50:23.131 - 00:50:24.259, Speaker A: Yes, definitely.
00:50:24.427 - 00:51:19.355, Speaker B: And I think speaking of that, one thing we did was we have this 40 question or so quiz that we designed, which if you answer all of it, it spits out a radar chart. So if you guys play video games and you have different strengths and weaknesses, Strengths and weaknesses, basically you have different attributes for your characters. So it kind of shows you, hey, this person might be very good at understanding attention flows, but very bad at interpreting data, or very good at kind of predicting trends, but very bad at confusing trends with actual traction. And so a lot of kind of very specific traits. So what we want to do is make sure that as a team, when we overlay all of these radar charts, we get a circle. We get a very, very kind of complementary and capable team. So was that something that you always thought that we wanted to do in terms of just hiring such different people, or is that just something that kind of occurred to you as we were building this together?
00:51:19.515 - 00:52:01.591, Speaker A: No, I think it was very clear from the ankle this was the way to do it. I think for me, I was very clear on where my strengths lie. And I thought I had a pretty good sensing of where yours did as well. And so the reason why we helm the two, I guess, tail ends of the book is because we know that's where our strengths lies. And for the much more as a larger main proportion of the book, that's where we really need a team to come in and support us. So I think everything was deliberately done correctly. Right now we're still fine tuning the mechanics of how the entire team works, bringing on one or two more people to really fill out the team.
00:52:01.591 - 00:52:06.519, Speaker A: But after that, I think once we've locked in, we're good to go.
00:52:06.687 - 00:52:33.715, Speaker B: Yeah. And so if you're listening to this at home and you are a young analyst or investor, you want to join us, just reach out to us. Happy to have a chat with you guys. So on that note, actually, on building a team, I think one of the main things that I wanted to do was make sure that we're very different in skill sets and wiring, but very similar in values. So we don't want to hire bad people. So we want to hire for people who kind of believe in the industry in the long term. They want to support this industry.
00:52:33.715 - 00:53:06.877, Speaker B: They don't like scammers, they don't want to do. They're kind of high integrity people, but at the same time they're very different wirings and skill sets. Because I was always up to view that best decisions come from thoughtful disagreements. If you have a whole team that is constantly just hyping each other up having the same thesis, you're going to miss some of the biggest trends in crypto. Because unless you actually steel man your ideas, I don't think you can make good investment decisions. So I think we've set up a team precisely to do that. So just to kind of talk a little bit about the process for the liquid fund side.
00:53:06.877 - 00:53:31.835, Speaker B: So for the spot fund and the kind of shorter timeframe trading stuff, stuff we have periodic postmortems for basically every single decision we make. Right. So we track every single thing and we try to distill lessons learned every single month into principles. So is this something that before you started Tangent you did on your own as well, like just constantly trying to journal everything you traded and was this something that you kind of developed over time?
00:53:32.215 - 00:54:17.335, Speaker A: No, I think a lot of this is actually to your credit. I think you are much more diligent and organized than me in that sense. I would definitely reflect and journal the big events that happen or the big mistakes or the big wins that I've had, but not so much till a point where it's systemized the way that you've done it. I think you've done a fantastic job at really creating this, well, all machine of if there's an event, what is the output, what is the postmortem, what are the lessons learned? And through that I think we've grown so much quicker. We've become better, faster as a function of these consistent systems and processes in place.
00:54:17.835 - 00:54:42.253, Speaker B: Yeah. And I always talk about the importance of principles just because there is so much recency bias in how people think about markets. Right. We always remember the latest thing. So for us we were stuck in like PTSD mode for like a year since 2022, because you know, Luna 3ac, FTX, all those things. So a lot of people were using recency bias and, and they were making decisions in the market as if it's going to be a bear market and job market. So a Lot of people were sidelined in 2023 because of this.
00:54:42.253 - 00:55:09.601, Speaker B: So I think to think the way to avoid it is actually just to study history and to distill these into bite sized principles so you can easily recall them. So this is something that we do just every year. We just collate all of our lessons from that year from wins and losses into principles. So it's been applied kind of quite well, I think, to how we run as a team. So that's on the liquid side. On the venture side as well. I think we also are pretty diligent in terms of how we evaluate teams.
00:55:09.601 - 00:55:40.111, Speaker B: So we do ref checks for every single founder we work with. We make sure that we don't play the game where founders are like, hey, we have 48 hours before the round closes and so, and so is already invested. So you gotta, you gotta commit on the call. Like if you say that to me, I'll just, I'll just hang up. I don't want to get involved because for us it's really long term relationships, right? We want to invest in people we want to work with over the long term. We want to see you ship your products, we don't want to see you cash out too early, we want to see you actually ship your thing. So we want to help you on the way.
00:55:40.111 - 00:56:00.381, Speaker B: So we want to stay with you for years and years. And for us to like commit on the first call, it's almost like you meet a girl on a first date and you marry her. It makes no sense to me. So we do our diligence. We're very, very processed. But as a result of that, we're also quite slow in terms of the venture side, I think deliberately as well. So every year we do not invest in more than 10 projects.
00:56:00.381 - 00:56:31.303, Speaker B: We are very, very concentrated in terms of our bets. And a big part of that is because we know that in the first year of any startup, we've seen hundreds. Now in crypto, it's the most crucial and founders need your help the most. But the bigger funds, because of allocation resources, they usually can't get involved that early. So there was a gap in the first year of the startup where, you know, these start. These founders are kind of just left out to dry. So we kind of come in and help these founders with kind of figuring out, okay, how do you hire people? We've helped them close some pretty senior hires before.
00:56:31.303 - 00:57:15.305, Speaker B: We help them negotiate with exchanges, assemble entire cap tables, also kind of crisis manage in some cases. So a lot of the behind the scenes things that need to be done and can only be done if you have a deep network and expertise in the Asia ecosystem. We try to do that for our founders, but we typically don't talk about a lot of those things publicly just because these are internal kind of company things. But yeah, so I think we're quite process driven for the venture side and the liquid side as well. I guess in terms of the broader team, when you think about how do we scale as a team over time, what are the types of things you look for in candidates or people you want to hire?
00:57:16.005 - 00:58:34.883, Speaker A: I think the ability to have a strong independent view is one of the most important things in crypto. I think when, if you let yourself get taken by the current, I.e. cT and prices that you see every day, you can quickly lose yourself into just doing what people are telling you to do or thinking how people are telling you to think. Right. Because there's so many threats on CT now where they're telling you, hey, this is an interesting trend look at XYZ protocols as for potential alpha and by the time that you are taking this at face value and going to investigate these things, there's an element of alpha decay already. Not saying that these threads are useless, but typically the best ideas that I found have often never been from ct. I've actually used CT as a counter indicator quite a bit in order to find the best ideas and not to diss anyone specifically, but more so just take the general, I guess, emotion portrayed to a certain thing.
00:58:34.883 - 00:59:44.229, Speaker A: So ETH is a perfect example for that. I saw hate and anger on ETH so much just days leading up to the ETF deadline. So I think having a strong independent view is extremely important. And being able to at the same time be malleable in your view, after being confronted with a different perspective is also, I think pretty crucial. And these are, I guess, pretty contrasting characteristics. And it's not often that you would see someone or it's pretty difficult to have both, but I think it's possible and I think if you can have that combination, you would, number one, be able to spot alpha before anyone else, which is extremely good for money making. And number two, you'll be able to hop on trends at a rate that is probably, probably it doesn't make you too late to them basically.
00:59:44.229 - 01:00:23.385, Speaker A: Right, because money is made. The most money is made actually when you are predicting a trend and it turns out to be correct. The second most money is made when you are midway through a trend and the trend continues to go, but obviously it's a bit less but the risk is a lot less as well. And so if you can kneel these two aspects down, you typically will do pretty well in almost any environment. Whether PvP, PvE, you do okay. So I think those are the two main, most important things and those are the two things that we look out for in prospective analysts the most as well.
01:00:24.085 - 01:01:27.893, Speaker B: If you really think about it in crypto or in general investing, it's at least in kind of early stage, high risk, high variance type of investing. I'm not talking about the deep value type of investing. It's all about catching hockey stick growth, right? Catching parabolas. And I think different styles of investing would put you in different phases of that parabola, right? So as a venture investor, your goal is to get in even before people realize there is, there's a hockey stick happening, right? So you're trying to pre position, you know, years ahead of time of the next big trends. So if you're investing in Deepin like three years ago, or if you're investing in socialfi, you know, years ago, then I would consider that, you know, good venture investing probably versus if you're chasing crypto AI now, I'm not so sure if that's, that's like, I think that's confusing timeframes. So for me one of the biggest rules is your ability to navigate timeframes well is very, very important for crypto. Just because VCs and traders, they're investing in the same assets because the time, the liquidity is months.
01:01:27.893 - 01:01:52.017, Speaker B: So people always confuse timeframes. And I think that was actually one of the reasons maybe that we messed up with the robot thing. It's because some confusion around timeframes as well. So for us as a team, we want to find people who can navigate timeframes well and are self aware enough to know where they are good at. So I think my edge for instance, is in pre positioning years ahead of time. So I run away from trends. If I see everybody hyping up crypto AI, I'm not going to do a crypto AI deal.
01:01:52.017 - 01:02:35.631, Speaker B: I think your skill is kind of navigating the parabola as it's happening, as the trend is happening. And then we find some people on the team who are good at maybe early phases of the parabola, so they start to see some sign of breakout. Maybe they see user numbers spiking up on certain applications but the price not moving, so they see some discrepancy and they get early. And some people on our team are very good at the last part of the Parabola, which is when things get the most euphoric but also the most liquid. So they are kind of very plugged into the information flow. So being able to kind of navigate this entire line I really think is the whole game of investing. But the more important thing is the ability to recognize which part of the line you live on and just stay there.
01:02:35.631 - 01:03:24.833, Speaker B: So in order to make our team be very self aware of this, we also have a dot collection system. So we call it dot collection systems. Basically every pitch we have like 30 different criteria that we rate each of our analysts on. Just for me and Daryl, just to make sure that, okay, it seems like this person is good at logical thinking and understanding secondary effects, but maybe they're not so good at market timing. So over time we're able to kind of plot these personality or skill traits of our team as well, which I think our team quiet enjoys because it helps them grow faster as well. Yes, because I think one of the big things with my first job as a consultant was these kind of 360 reviews at the end of the year. Basically once a year you got some feedback from your manager, they give you a bunch of bullshit about, oh, you're a hard worker but you're not that, blah, blah, blah, blah.
01:03:24.833 - 01:03:57.345, Speaker B: So didn't help me with anything. So you want to make sure that if you want, if you're serious about being a world class investor and you come to work with us, we have systems in place to make sure you track your progression and we're very, very specific in terms of what we think you can work on. Yeah, so that's a little bit about what the tangent process is like. So for the second part of this, I know a lot of you guys are probably tuning in to hear some sort of alpha or market views. So some of the things that you guys have asked us about, I've listed here. So we're going to discuss that one by one. The first being the ETF implications.
01:03:57.345 - 01:04:00.905, Speaker B: So what are your thoughts on the ETH ETF just in general?
01:04:01.365 - 01:04:40.689, Speaker A: Well, okay, I think taking a step back from the eth, I think just comparing the biggest difference between the last cycle and this cycle is undoubtedly the ETF ETF that is the number one unlocker to significantly larger pools of capital. And it's the ultimate answer for who is your marginal buyer? Right. Who is your marginal buyer for BDC at 60k? And the answer is sovereign wealth funds. The answer is potentially companies. The answer is potentially huge tradfi institutions. Right. If we had that that last cycle, maybe we Wouldn't have topped that 69k.
01:04:40.689 - 01:06:12.251, Speaker A: Right. But now that we have it, where can we go? So I think this is undoubtedly the most important thing this cycle to have happened so far. And it's interesting because I think at a very low level it's pretty obvious, right? Oh, ETF means more money come in, means number go up, right? But I think when people are consistently re underwriting where you are in the cycle, people are consistently asking who is the marginal buyer? How do flows look like now that the BDC ETF has matured to a stage where you really don't know whether tomorrow is going to have a positive or negative flow? When there's an absence for reason too long and you see the inflows come out at 300 million, 500 million. That is, I think one of the biggest positive impacts of the ETF this cycle because it plays a profound role in changing sentiment as well. Because if there was no ETF and we were ranging between 60 to 70k for three months, I think most of you will get pretty jittery. I still think most people on CT are pretty jittery because they're consistently asking, all right, it seems like the flows are pretty much exhausted. Who is your marginal buyer? There's no marginal buyer.
01:06:12.251 - 01:07:56.781, Speaker A: It's time to go back to the shadowlands bear market again, yada yada. But if you look at the broader system or cycle, what is the reason to buy BTC now? The halving is over, right? The ETF has come, so all the, I guess catalysts that you would pre position for are already over. So why are you still long? And the answer is really because you just have had that lifeblood connected to you, to the largest pool of capital in the world that if by our estimates it's not even 10% allocated yet, there's really no reason to I guess sway from a net long bias in order to capture these flows. And so I think the ETF is enough to be the tipping point to skew you long in situations where you would typically be neutral or maybe even short. I think that's the biggest difference to the mindset and the psychology of the market now. And this extends from BTC and now we're going to see, I guess in the next couple of months what it does for ETH as well. But if were right and consistently more and more people submit and embrace crypto from the real world, there is really no reason why you should be bearish.
01:07:56.781 - 01:08:04.477, Speaker A: Because even on days where you have 100 or $200 million outflows you know that the rising tide ultimately brings us back, Right?
01:08:04.621 - 01:08:06.909, Speaker B: It's very befitting of your green candle behind you.
01:08:06.957 - 01:08:07.237, Speaker A: That's correct.
01:08:07.261 - 01:08:43.071, Speaker B: It's very bullish. Very bullish. So I think this is an interesting point about studying history as well, because. So we talked a lot about studying history and distilling it into principles, but there's also a limit to how much you can just reason by analogy. And hey, this happened in last cycle, so it's going to happen this cycle. So that's why we always encourage our people to think from first principles as well. And one of the kind of main differences like you mentioned, is this undercurrent of ETFs, because if you reason from analogy alone, last time we had a Bitcoin futures ETF that was the top of the market, and last time the bull market happened after the halving as well.
01:08:43.071 - 01:09:02.511, Speaker B: So if you just reason from analogy, then there's a risk that you completely misinterpret this entire cycle. So I think this is something you're quite good at in terms of reasoning from first principles and making sure you're not just blindly superimposing charts over each other.
01:09:02.583 - 01:09:02.951, Speaker A: Yes.
01:09:03.023 - 01:09:12.564, Speaker B: So how do you navigate thinking from first principles but also balancing learning from successes and losses of the past cycle?
01:09:14.664 - 01:09:54.027, Speaker A: That's a tough question. I think thinking from first principles is definitely the most important thing because usually from that you'd be able to develop viewpoints that the market may not agree with. That's number one. The market is a pretty good reflection of what hurt mentality is. And oftentimes hurt mentality is wrong. And so this is how you're able to take control and viewpoints that may or may not pay off in your designated timeframe. So, that being said, I don't have a lot of experience in crypto relative to a lot of the OGs out there.
01:09:54.027 - 01:10:45.715, Speaker A: And a lot of the time I understand how crowd psychology or investor psychology repeats. And so we typically try and find ways in which the setups are very similar, meaning markets have been conditioned to do certain things in the past, and that's why it's likely that it's going to repeat in the future. But it's definitely, I would say this is one of the more challenging aspects of being a PM and trying to decide, okay, are markets going to diverge from history or are markets going to follow history? Because if you can answer that question with 100% accuracy, you'll be the best investor in the world by far. But it's something that we strive to do on a day to day basis.
01:10:46.175 - 01:10:56.965, Speaker B: And I guess bringing down to specifics, I think a lot of people are interested in our views on bitcoin and we talked about the CHOP framework a little bit as well. So yeah, what is our current view on bitcoin?
01:10:57.585 - 01:11:00.365, Speaker A: Why don't you answer that given that this CHOP framework is yours?
01:11:01.345 - 01:11:42.149, Speaker B: I've been a big proponent of this. So my view is that anything between 56 and $71,000 is noise. So I think the market is just in a wide, wide chopping range. And every time we've tried to break 3 of 71, we might break 3 today to be honest, we already broke 3. We've already broken 3 of it, so it might be irrelevant. So technically the point is 73 and I'll just keep adjusting it upwards to fit my bias. But my whole point is that there is a big consolidation range for bitcoin and unless we get some sort of positive development, most likely in the form of some sort of political catalyst towards the end of the year, then we enter trending again.
01:11:42.149 - 01:12:11.945, Speaker B: But I have no conviction on what the timing is. I'm really just basing decisions off of what the price is, telling me a few kind of reasons why I think we are in some sort of a wide chop range is threefold. So number one, if you look at, you look at equities, they are no longer just up only. So that's usually quite high correlation with bitcoin as well. So obviously that's lower timeframe. So low conviction on that. Number two is actually stable coin inflows.
01:12:11.945 - 01:12:55.283, Speaker B: So if you Track USDC and USDT, we've pretty much been a straight lineup since Q3, Q4, 20, 23, that's finally started to stagnate. So it means inflows at least from crypto native inflows for USD to USDC is slowing down a bit. So obviously you could say that that might be offset by the ETF inflows into bitcoin. A bit dubious about that. And I think number three also is that a lot of this ETF flows is probably priced in at the moment unless we get surprising inflows to the upside. Which is why I think we need another additional catalyst probably in the form of favorable political conditions which we are starting to maybe get. So maybe we do break out of that range.
01:12:55.283 - 01:13:31.317, Speaker B: But until this kind of range of 56 to low 70s break, I'm not very, very convinced that we get any type of euphoric bull alt market especially for eth. So I think just to extend the View to ETH as well. I think part one of the repositioning trade is done where all the crypto natives are repositioned, which you correctly called. But the second part of that I think really depends on actual flows coming in. So that depends on the S1 being approved. So I think from now till then, ETH price action is also a distraction in noise. But that's my personal view.
01:13:31.317 - 01:13:33.781, Speaker B: I know we have some internal disagreements about that sometimes.
01:13:33.853 - 01:13:36.813, Speaker A: This is why you have the red background and I have the green background.
01:13:36.909 - 01:13:38.577, Speaker B: I am the bear. I am the bear.
01:13:38.641 - 01:13:40.833, Speaker A: He is the chop bear and I.
01:13:40.849 - 01:13:43.281, Speaker B: Am the perma bull. It's always ptf.
01:13:43.433 - 01:14:19.471, Speaker A: Yeah. So we've gone back and forth on this a number of times, so. And the compromise is the invalidation. Right. So I think at 73k, if we do break above 73k, Jason will be forced to submit and we are able to flip fully long once again. Which I think, I mean with we've sort of sat in a three month range for a bit. I think if we do have a proper breakout, you're probably not going to be able to buy 73 or 74k.
01:14:19.471 - 01:14:56.645, Speaker A: If we break out properly it's going to be probably straight to 76 or 77 and then next order of business is trying to touch 90 I think. So I would definitely prefer that as opposed to continuing in this range for a while. But let's see. Right now it really feels like, especially with the last yesterday's $800 million BTC inflow, it really feels like the ball is in Tradfire's court. They are controlling the market now. Now we see what happens.
01:14:57.585 - 01:15:27.177, Speaker B: Yes sir. And now another thing that people want to know about is talk about one of our bigger positions. So without kind of giving away everything, I think one thing we can talk about is probably Arweave. Yeah, so we were quite early to the Arweave train. So let me kind of give a backstory there. When we looked into storage networks, I think in 2023 it was by far to me very, very clear that filecoin was the winner in terms of the capacity, the supply, all the metrics. And to me Arweave has a very niche proposition.
01:15:27.177 - 01:16:01.487, Speaker B: They were asking people to pay multiples on top of what you would pay for any other storage solutions. But obviously the trade off there is you're paying upfront for the cost of perpetual storage. But when you really think about it in terms of a consumer use case perspective, I couldn't think of anyone who wants to store something online forever Besides, maybe French use cases like human rights lawyers and so on. So to me, the TAM wasn't that big. But then something changed when this AO thing got launched. So we're not going to talk about AO specifically. We did an episode with the founder of Arweave, Sam, about ao.
01:16:01.487 - 01:16:20.915, Speaker B: So we dive really deep into the tech there. We dissect the whole white paper. If you want to check that out, go ahead. But in terms of AO, so this is new L1 that is kind of developed by the Arweave team and they just had a very interesting update as well. You want to talk a little bit about that update, about this fair launch?
01:16:21.455 - 01:16:56.075, Speaker A: Yes. So Jason handles the. The fundamental implications of how exciting AO is as a tech, as new technology. I handle AO in terms of what it means for our bottom line and how do we make money from it. So I think AO is very interesting right now because number one, it is a L1 that allows for AI agents to work on chain. I think not many, if not any blockchains currently offer that alternative. Right.
01:16:56.075 - 01:17:26.407, Speaker A: So immediately it can start being categorized as a potential candidate for the AI agent meta. Right. And I believe there are not many high quality candidates out there today. Number two, this complete fair launch by the team. Well, it's not a real fair launch in a sense that you have a lot of AR token holders that basically.
01:17:26.471 - 01:17:29.327, Speaker B: Get free AO tokens if they custody on chain.
01:17:29.391 - 01:18:28.635, Speaker A: If they custody on chain. We'll actually find out later today the exact details of that conversion. But as far as it gets, this is about as good a launch from a VC backed team as you can get. It does not get better than 100% going to, or rather a 0% allocation for investors and 0% allocation for team. That's basically what it is. So now this, I think works very well with the existing dynamic of the crowd or the market being unhappy with high FTP tokens, simply because I think the dynamic there is pretty well understood by the market. You have new tokens, even if very exciting, you have huge inflation and emission concerns somewhere down the road.
01:18:28.635 - 01:19:52.117, Speaker A: And so people have gravitated towards meme coins, I think at large because of the fact that they are 100% fair launched and fully circulated. So I think AO can capture a part of that matter as well as an AI coin or an AI leader that doesn't have that aggressive investor unlocks or team unlocks. It may still have quite a bit of inflation because of the way that they're structuring the AAO token release. But we'll see As I said later today, so if you match the fair launch meta with the AI agents meta, you actually have a very compelling candidate here that can be the market leader for both mindshare and price appreciation, especially given how, I guess, dry or tired the rest of the AI landscape is. Right. If I asked the general participant on the street, what are the main AI tokens to long, they're going to answer render, they're going to answer near, and they're going to answer a world coin, or they're going to answer one of those AJAX fetch tokens as well. This has been the case since the start of the bloody cycle.
01:19:52.117 - 01:20:30.535, Speaker A: Everybody's kind of tired of this. Everybody already knows that most of these coins are probably overvalued, to put it lightly. And people want a new fresh idea with a fresh dream. And this is where I think AO can really provide that. So we have built up a reasonable AR position based on the conversion ratio and the ultimate details of the tokenomic launch for ao. We may build a separate AO position as well. But I think in the absence of really anything else happening in this market, it.
01:20:30.535 - 01:20:32.571, Speaker A: We really like this.
01:20:32.763 - 01:21:05.779, Speaker B: Yeah. And by the time this episode comes out, about a week from now, we'll know what the actual verdict is on the details. But it's interesting because we approach this. This is an example of how the team works together, where we have a member of a team who I consider maybe a medium timeframe type of wiring, come in with a pitch that say, hey, there's this new AO development that's quite interesting. Let's look into it. And then I myself, I think more higher time frame wired. I look into the AO stuff, I dug into the team and I thought, this is actually really interesting.
01:21:05.779 - 01:21:29.575, Speaker B: This is what dfinity said they're going to build for years, but just nobody cared. But they're for real doing this. And then we have a member of our team who is more of a tinkerer. Lower time frame. Well, not lower time frame, but more of an on chain kind of guy, actually test out AOTest net and walk out, walk us, walk the entire team through it, kind of. He was running the two AI agents against each other, showing us kind of how it works as well. So that kind of gave us an idea.
01:21:29.575 - 01:21:56.205, Speaker B: Okay, this is what people are tinkering with. And then we try to approach with a venture approach. So we try to approach a team. Hey, if you guys are looking for investors for ao, get us involved. But because that didn't happen and the actual token is only going to be in liquid markets, we bring in kind of the kind of liquid side of the fund as well to participate. So that's an example of how different wirings of a team allows us to capture an opportunity in a comprehensive way. So I'm quite excited about this.
01:21:56.205 - 01:22:38.905, Speaker B: So we'll see kind of how it turns out. But for the last part of our segment today, I tweeted out what people want to know when I brought you on the show. And we have I think a list of like 20 or so questions, some of them very inappropriate, so we're not going to talk about them. But I've picked, I think five or six questions here that I thought was quite interesting that we can do as a rapid fire for the last segment. So first one here is how do we pick each other as co founders? And I think this guy asked on both your Twitter and mine, he asked you like, how did you pick, how did you know Jason was the one? And I was like, how did you know Daryl was the one? And I told him, you know, we're not married, we're co founders. Okay, so what was the story there? How did we decide to work together?
01:22:39.325 - 01:23:43.319, Speaker A: So I thought that you were one of the most publicly opinionated people in the space that I thought consistently made a lot of sense when you were, you know, voicing your thoughts on Twitter. I think your podcast was one of the best education materials out there for newcomers to get into the space. I thought you were a generally good guy. And I had, you know, we talked shop a little bit throughout the years. We were getting to know each other and we co invested with each other a little bit. So generally what I look for, a partner is someone that I can trust, someone I think has similar values as me, someone that, that can push me and make me consistently try to be better in a sort of competitive way, but not directly competitive, and someone who could pluck the leaks that I have in my investing skill set. And so I think you ticked all those boxes pretty quickly.
01:23:43.319 - 01:23:54.175, Speaker A: And I knew this quite early on. And so I was like, this is a good guy. Maybe if I ever do anything by myself, I'll hit him up.
01:23:55.715 - 01:24:42.351, Speaker B: I think one of our guys yesterday asked us, why are we doing this as well? And I think our answer was that actually we just like the game. Why not just retire and go check out somewhere? But actually we just enjoy the process of being in the market, of trying to solve this game that is crypto and kind of working with people who we think are very sharp and learning new things every day. Like if, if we were to stop tangent, I don't know what we would do. So I think that that's one of the reasons why we started to do this. I think for me it was actually, I remember very distinctly last bull market. We're all kind of investing in different things, co investing different things, trading different things. So sometimes because markets are 24, 7 and last cycle was truly crazy, sometimes you send money to friends or people you met online to execute stuff on your behalf and send it back to you.
01:24:42.351 - 01:25:04.369, Speaker B: Sometimes you do it for them. And I think, think I've had a few cases where I sent some of my funds to some friends as they were buying some stuff. I told them, hey, help me execute some of this. And then sometimes they would come back and say, hey, I help you execute this. So I should get a little kickback from the profits you get. So some of them would pocket 10% before they release my funds. So that's fair.
01:25:04.369 - 01:25:23.061, Speaker B: But then I think I remember I sent you the most amount of money I've ever sent anyone I've never met in person. And I remember I was doing this because I was taking my girlfriend out at the time. But then I saw this thing. I was like, if I try to trade this, my girlfriend would kill me. So let's hit up there. Okay. So I sent him the money and then we went to watch a movie.
01:25:23.061 - 01:25:40.861, Speaker B: Half of me thought, okay, I've never met this guy. Probably he took the money and ran away. And then when I came out, you finished the trade. There was like a good profit there. And he sent it completely back to me, no questions asked. I was like, okay, this guy is very trustworthy. So to me, they go back to the point about finding people with different skill sets but similar values.
01:25:40.861 - 01:26:01.051, Speaker B: Right. In terms of integrity. So I think that was one of the things. So obviously we've also talked for like two years before we started. And then I met you in person in Barcelona as well. Now I moved to Singapore, so yeah, so that's kind of the story there. But I think if people are looking for co founder advice, I would not recommend starting something with someone you've never met before.
01:26:01.051 - 01:26:10.105, Speaker B: So make sure you kind of run some checks first and make sure you've talked together, you've done some things together. Just because we haven't met in person, we've actually talked, talked a lot.
01:26:10.265 - 01:26:58.619, Speaker A: So to be fair, I think it's not like Jason and I immediately, you know, combined our aum together and start the tangent on day one, we actually had sort of a Soft feeling out process for a year. For almost a year, yes. Where we were by all means working together, but we hadn't really taken that step to pool our capital together because I think that's a very big deal. It's a very big step for anyone to take because it means that whatever decision you make, you have to make on behalf of two people instead of one. Right. Versus if I were to co invest with Jason, for example, I would have my own sort of book, he would have his own sort of book. And only certain deals that we like that we can co invest together.
01:26:58.619 - 01:27:33.749, Speaker A: That's a much, much, much lower commitment. And so we had a full one year sort of feeling out process saying is this guy really the person that I want to commit with? And only after that did we decide to go ahead. So that is something that I would recommend. If you are trying to find someone you want to work with in crypto, maybe, chances are you probably haven't met the guy in person. I would recommend taking some time to really get to know this person. It could be a year, it could be years if you need it to be. There's no hurry.
01:27:33.877 - 01:27:54.999, Speaker B: It's actually a signal I use for a venture process as well. In terms of investing in co founder pairs. One question I always ask is how did you guys meet? Did you guys work together? Did you guys disagree before? And if they have never met before and they just started this because they met at a conference or something, it's not a death knell, but it's also sometimes a little bit. Are these guys going to be friends in like two years?
01:27:55.047 - 01:27:55.583, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:27:55.719 - 01:28:01.675, Speaker B: So that's, that's one. So okay, someone wants to know what is our biggest moment of disagreement so far?
01:28:04.775 - 01:28:18.143, Speaker A: I think most of the disagreements is actually just on positions and book net. I don't think on. We don't actually have many big disagreements.
01:28:18.239 - 01:28:20.063, Speaker B: Many small disagreements, yes.
01:28:20.119 - 01:28:52.197, Speaker A: On like. So we have no major disagreements on principles, on morality, on ethics, which is important because if you do, then it's the wrong partner. Basically, something's not right. But yeah, we have many disagreements in which either I'm asking Jason to buy, he refuses, or he's asking me to buy and I refuse. And I'm like no. And so actually the way that we sort of partially solved this was we introduced the concept of vetoes in tangent. It's very similar to.
01:28:52.197 - 01:29:13.465, Speaker A: What do you call it? What is that? That in tennis you have these challenges. Yes, in tennis you have challenges. And similarly in intention we have vetoes where if one party or the Other feels really, really strongly and the other party just refuses to budge. You can pull the veto and just execute it anyway.
01:29:13.545 - 01:29:15.201, Speaker B: And if you're right, it replenishes.
01:29:15.313 - 01:29:23.831, Speaker A: Correct. So if you're right on the call, it replenishes. If you're wrong, you tuck your tail between your legs and you lose your veto for the rest. I think every six months.
01:29:23.993 - 01:29:30.331, Speaker B: Because I remember I laughed because I remember in 2023 we both vetoed and we're both wrong. So we just left with no vetoes.
01:29:30.403 - 01:29:30.867, Speaker A: Yes.
01:29:30.971 - 01:29:33.735, Speaker B: And it was related to, I think like market beta call.
01:29:34.035 - 01:29:34.795, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:29:34.955 - 01:29:54.951, Speaker B: But yeah, I think that's a good characterization. I think there's many moments of small disagreements all the time. It's because we are wired so differently. But it's because of that that I think we are not, we're not allowed to make lazy decisions. I won't be like, oh, darrow thing says, yeah, let's do with it. So it's always like, actually I disagree because of this and this and this. And we make sure we address all of them.
01:29:55.023 - 01:30:10.127, Speaker A: Yes. Like many times I would feel like doing something just because I feel like it. And then I tell Jason and then he bombard me with a list of questions. I'm like, why do you feel this way? And I'm like, all right, maybe, maybe it's not.
01:30:10.191 - 01:30:30.011, Speaker B: Maybe you get a long text from me. But it's actually quite funny because people think that as a venture kind of long term focused guy, I'm always bullish about everything. And as shorter term firm traders, they're always bearish about everything. I feel like that's actually not true. I feel like I'm often more bearish on things, which is why I have the red candle here.
01:30:30.083 - 01:30:30.523, Speaker A: Yes.
01:30:30.619 - 01:30:41.755, Speaker B: Despite working mostly with founders on a multi year type of horizon and not really caring too much about the low timeframe price movements, I'm always very quite bearish.
01:30:41.915 - 01:30:44.891, Speaker A: Yes. And I'm the natural bull, which is pretty funny.
01:30:44.963 - 01:31:15.245, Speaker B: Yeah. So I don't know what it is. Maybe it's a 2022 PTSD. So speaking of that, someone also wants to know how do you exit for early investments? So I'm actually going to steal an answer from Chris Berniski, which I thought was a great answer, which is if I exit and you know, then I fucked up somewhere because I would never want to kill the price of any project that we exit. I want to make sure that there's sufficient liquidity. The project is a maturity stage that the thesis has by and large played out. So we can exit gracefully.
01:31:15.245 - 01:31:36.081, Speaker B: I think that's actually a great, great framework work because you see a lot of the bigger funds exiting their early positions. They just kill prices. I'm not going to name names, but I think in 2022 or 2023 someone very big was exiting maker. It might have been 2021. My timeline's blurring. 2023, 2023. So early investor was exiting maker.
01:31:36.081 - 01:32:09.491, Speaker B: Maker was, I think honestly having a great roadmap with endgame and so on, but the prices would not budge and it was mostly because of one big entity. I think I never want to do that too to a project because you're actually curtailing the Runway of the project if you do this right, because the treasury is based on the token. So if you're constantly just like suppressing the price, not giving them room to breathe, then it actually hurts the team. So for me that's kind of the framework. So I really kind of think of venture investments at either 100x or 0x. If it's a 2x, I don't really want to exit because I consider that a failure. If it's a venture investment.
01:32:09.491 - 01:32:13.145, Speaker B: Do you have any thoughts on how do you want to exit for investments?
01:32:13.565 - 01:32:14.749, Speaker A: HODL to zero.
01:32:14.837 - 01:32:16.997, Speaker B: Hodl to zero. You've done that before.
01:32:17.101 - 01:32:18.933, Speaker A: I have. We'll get to that.
01:32:19.029 - 01:32:23.693, Speaker B: So actually, let's get to that. So what is your biggest loss in crypto before Tangent?
01:32:23.829 - 01:33:03.315, Speaker A: So I remember at the end of the last cycle, I believe it was March 2022, where I basically pulled the plug and I said that's it. And I sold everything I had. But being that ardent die hard supporter of certain things, I was like, okay, I sell 80% of what I have. 20% are these GameFi tokens that I believed would be the future of gaming, that I just said, even if this goes to zero, I'll be okay. And I show my support to certain projects that I will not name that eventually went down.
01:33:03.755 - 01:33:06.135, Speaker B: I did go to zero almost.
01:33:06.995 - 01:33:47.179, Speaker A: Well, I had a $2 million position that's now worth $10,000 on my Zappa Pain. OGs will know which one this is. And the other one did go to zero. So I really threw away 20% of my net worth on GameFi tokens because I had this mistaken belief that going down with a ship is better than dumping on my friends. I don't know whether I make the same decision if I'll ever face with them again. I think the answer is probably just don't hold so much of these GameFire.
01:33:47.227 - 01:33:49.083, Speaker B: Tokens just make better calls, basically.
01:33:49.139 - 01:33:49.539, Speaker A: Make better calls.
01:33:49.547 - 01:33:52.475, Speaker B: All the things that you're actually willing to hold to zero because you believe in the team.
01:33:52.555 - 01:34:01.785, Speaker A: Yes. So that's a perfect example of how I lost 20% of my network worth for nothing. But I sold the majority of my crypto in March 2022.
01:34:02.165 - 01:34:02.653, Speaker B: Did okay.
01:34:02.669 - 01:34:03.389, Speaker A: And I did okay.
01:34:03.477 - 01:34:19.781, Speaker B: Did okay. And we were able to start tangents, thankfully. Thankfully. So the last question out there. Sorry, the last question for our Twitter audience is for analysts out there. What are the best ways for them to differentiate? So this probably goes out to people who want to maybe work with us as well.
01:34:19.893 - 01:34:20.421, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:34:20.533 - 01:34:51.457, Speaker B: What are ways they can send out? So I remember when we first started, it was actually when I first started, it was. I wouldn't say it's not difficult, but it was easier to differentiate because nobody was doing content. There's a few OG bitcoin podcasts and I was one of the first guys to do a crypto podcast. So I was interviewing projects every day. And through that I was also building my knowledge and network. And because of that, it became extremely valuable to any crypto fund. But today, everybody has a blog, everybody has a substack, everybody has a podcast, everybody has a Twitter.
01:34:51.591 - 01:35:15.845, Speaker A: So I think there are three things, right? The first prerequisite is you have to be active on ct. If you're not active on ct, it's just Connecticut is now the modern day cv. Right. If you don't have a trail of either good calls you've made or good things that you've provided or helpful information you've provided, I'm just going to pass.
01:35:15.885 - 01:35:18.909, Speaker B: Over your profile because you're not going to notice. Basically.
01:35:18.957 - 01:35:41.895, Speaker A: Yes. You haven't put in that proof of work or proof of recognition for being in this space. So that's number one. I wouldn't even say it's a plus point anymore. It's a prerequisite at this point. That's number one. Number two, I mentioned earlier having a very independent mind because this allows you to push back on me when I have views.
01:35:41.895 - 01:36:48.115, Speaker A: And that's what I want my analysts to have because that, as we discussed, produces the best sort of conversations on things and often leads to the best takeaways. And the last point is I would say show ways in which you've exhibited an enormous amount of competitive spirit. I think that's extremely important now because we typically want to hire a star competitors looking to be the next top hedge fund manager. I think that is a pretty good description of who we're trying to hire because eventually for whoever that comes, work with us in a perfect setting. As they grow and as they mature in their careers, one day maybe they'll come out, they'll spin out their own fun, or they will take on a much larger role within Tangent. And we'd love for that to happen, right?
01:36:48.655 - 01:37:20.255, Speaker B: I think for me, it's also, it's two things. Mostly it's especially for the longer term, parts of the book where you build a relationship with founders, you kind of help them do bd, help them do hiring. I want to have very good founder referrals for this guy or this woman. So what I mean by founder referral is like, if I talk to founders you've worked with before, what do they say about you behind your back? So that's actually one metric that I always try to optimize for Tangent is. And you can't fake that, right? You cannot, you cannot larp your way out of it. You must actually have done something for the founders. You're back.
01:37:20.255 - 01:37:57.631, Speaker B: You must have been there for them. You must pick up the phone when they call you for them to speak well of you. So I think if you talk to pretty much all of the founders we talk to that we work with, I think we have a pretty good founder referral. And I want to see that on an individual level for someone who wants to focus on longer term, longer, higher timeframe investing as well. And I think number two for me is, has this person found a way to systematize luck? Because I got so many DMS from people saying, oh, I made like X million dollars on this coin, you should hire me. Or I called this one play, you should hire me. But I really don't give a shit if you make one success, right? Because you're probably just in the right place at the right time.
01:37:57.631 - 01:38:36.171, Speaker B: I want to see whether you're able to repeat the success over time. Like, was it luck or did you. Were you able to isolate the variables from what happened in that play and then turn that into a playbook and then exercise that playbook? So that comes over time and again, I'm of two minds about whether you should be active in ct, because there's one point about groupthink. If you're constantly just plugging the ct, you're unable to zoom out. But without ct, like without a live feed of your thoughts over time, it's also kind of hard to see how you think. So one exception could be writing a block, a substack, that's fine, but the distribution is often lower on CTE as well. Substack, you need to find a way to distribute a substack.
01:38:36.171 - 01:38:50.343, Speaker B: So it all comes back down to having some sort of a social presence so you can get noticed. Just because the crypto investing landscape is so nascent that I don't think headhunters are particularly useful for junior analysts.
01:38:50.399 - 01:38:50.879, Speaker A: No.
01:38:51.007 - 01:39:05.599, Speaker B: Maybe for senior gps. But for junior analysts, you have to find a way to get noticed. I guess we have time for one more question. One last question is how do you continuously educate yourself and grow? Could be outside of crypto.
01:39:05.687 - 01:39:24.879, Speaker A: This is a great one. So. So I started going on more walks recently to fulfill my step count, which I have once again put as an agenda on my list. And what I love doing is just putting on a long form podcast and going on like one or two hour walks.
01:39:24.967 - 01:39:27.195, Speaker B: Besides blockcrunch, what are the ones you listen to?
01:39:27.695 - 01:39:36.539, Speaker A: So actually recently it's been outside of crypto. So Lex Friedman is the series I'm working through.
01:39:36.647 - 01:39:38.107, Speaker B: The Bill Ackman one.
01:39:38.291 - 01:40:40.391, Speaker A: Not just in general. Lex Friedman's podcast, in which he interviews a whole host of different people. Entrepreneurs, the richest people in the world, war, politicians, AI, I guess, CEOs, for example, anything really. It goes through the most interesting, different stuff on different industries in the world. And I think that in general for me has been so helpful in just like broadening my mind understanding outside of crypto, what's happening in the real world, what is the cool shit that's going down, how am I supposed to act if World War 3 happens? All the kind of stuff you'll be able to find in all these random podcasts. So that's for me, one of the most enjoyable ways that, that I grow as a person. Because I think it's very easy to often just lose yourself in crypto and then just, you know, too focus on like the P and L and then focus on like de stressing P and L.
01:40:40.391 - 01:40:46.103, Speaker A: Destressing P and L. And are you really growing from that? Maybe your bank account is growing, but are you growing as a person? Probably not.
01:40:46.239 - 01:41:40.517, Speaker B: So I agree with that. I think the best way to grow for me is to look outside of crypto. I was like that before where I would just read all the white papers, just focus on crypto, just be extremely crypto focused. And I started to realize that it's actually not great for me as an investor because sometimes when I talk to founders, I notice how smart and how technical they are, but at the same time how myopic they are in terms of just how small the worldview is because they're so focused on solving crypto specific problems that they forget why they're building crypto in the first place. So this is why we're so focused on, and I guess you could call it the consumer level, but it's mostly really the applied crypto level. So, you know, I think we pretty much passed on all the MEV stuff, a lot of the ZK stuff, but we really try to find ways where people are applying crypto to actually solving real world, real world problems. So the big example that I mentioned earlier was amino chain.
01:41:40.517 - 01:41:42.317, Speaker B: Right. Like learn about biobanks for the first time.
01:41:42.381 - 01:41:42.925, Speaker A: That's cool.
01:41:43.005 - 01:41:53.687, Speaker B: So I think learning about things outside of crypto will help our investing in crypto. So one way we're doing is two ways we're doing it internally. One, we're investing in funds that have nothing to do with crypto.
01:41:53.751 - 01:41:54.303, Speaker A: Yes.
01:41:54.439 - 01:42:33.365, Speaker B: So we've actually invested in a few funds now. So besides the NFT fund, we just made a commitment to a fund that is only doing biotech, especially AI driven biotech from a PhD in the US and we're looking at a few others that are kind of similar in that they have nothing to do with crypto, but they could. The people running the fund are at least open to the idea of crypto crypto. So I think that's how you actually get to see experimental use cases. Number two is internal knowledge sessions. So these are kind of Friday hangouts we do of the team where everybody comes in with something cool they did ideally something weird. So my only criteria to the team is like, give me the strangest thing you did this week.
01:42:33.365 - 01:43:12.023, Speaker B: Doesn't matter if it's in crypto outside. And they just kind of walk us through. So I think one of the weird ones that was presented internally, I forgot what it was called, but it was this game game where you can bet money on what do you think other people will bet the least money on and what do you think people will bet the most money on? And if you bet on those two, you win the game. So that started a whole conversation about kind of game theory. How do you actually play a game like this? We ran the game through ChatGPT to see what the optimal outcome would be as well. So it's like really left field type of conversations that keep your brain fresh. So yeah, those are two things that we do.
01:43:12.023 - 01:43:33.431, Speaker B: But there you have it folks. This is the first ever segment of On a Tangent. If you enjoy this, let us know on Twitter. If you hate it, please shut up.
