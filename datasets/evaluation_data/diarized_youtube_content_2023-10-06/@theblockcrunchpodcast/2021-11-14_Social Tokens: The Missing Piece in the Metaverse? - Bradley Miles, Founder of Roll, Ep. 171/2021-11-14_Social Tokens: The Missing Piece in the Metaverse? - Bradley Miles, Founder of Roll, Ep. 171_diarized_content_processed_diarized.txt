00:00:00.880 - 00:00:31.904, Speaker A: You're now listening to Alpha Leak, a podcast mini series highlighting the most under the radar projects and developments in crypto, and this series is brought to you by the Blockcrunch podcast. I'm your host, Jason Choi. I'm a general partner at Spartan Capital and an active Defi angel investor. Nothing on this show should be construed as financial advice, and my guests, myself and my employer may hold positions and assets discussed on the show. And if you'd like for your project to be featured on this series, reach out to me on Twitter mrjasonchoi. This episode is also brought to you by Periswap. Stick around to learn more.
00:00:31.904 - 00:01:25.704, Speaker A: This episode is also sponsored by the Hbar foundation. Now, social tokens is a concept that has fascinated me for a long time, and in the past two years, we've already seen NBA players tokenizing their own contracts. We've seen musicians tokenizing their own royalty so that they can share it with fans who buy their tokens. We've seen people tokenizing their own time so that if you own a token, you can rent out or buy out an hour of their time with them. There's so many different models, and even myself about a year ago also issued a token for the podcast called the Crunch Token. Now personally, I never really figured out a use case for it, so I kind of gave up on it. But I'm very excited to dive back into it again because in the past twelve months, precisely because of the emergence of nfts and their increasing popularity, there's a lot more attention given to the so called creator economy, as well as new ways for people to engage with their fans online.
00:01:25.704 - 00:02:02.570, Speaker A: So I'm very excited to go back to square one and talk to the man behind it all. And I'm talking about Bradley Miles, the founder of Roll, which is also the company that I first issued my own social token on. So Bradley is an OG in the space. He has been thinking about the social token problem for a long time, and he personally called it social money a year or two ago when no one was talking about it. So with this episode, we're going to dive into what is the current landscape for social tokens, what is the creator economy, as well as what we think is the inevitable stack for creators online to create tokenized communities. So incredibly excited to have Bradley on the show finally.
00:02:02.642 - 00:02:10.770, Speaker B: Hey everybody, I'm super excited to have founder of role and my friend Bradley Miles on the show finally to talk about social tokens. So Bradley, welcome to the show, man.
00:02:10.842 - 00:02:13.410, Speaker C: Jason, really happy to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:02:13.482 - 00:02:24.716, Speaker B: Absolutely. Now, one of the biggest topics this year is social tokens. Now, for people who are living under a rock, can you kind of explain what social tokens actually are before we dive into the weed of things?
00:02:24.820 - 00:02:33.860, Speaker C: Absolutely. I'd like to mention that you're very early on social tokens and have one for this podcast called. What is it called?
00:02:33.972 - 00:02:36.224, Speaker B: It's called Crunch the Crunchies.
00:02:36.564 - 00:03:19.918, Speaker C: So you're a very early creator on this, which is. I just want people to know. But yeah, a social token, you can really think about it as the latest way to digitally represent a community. The innovation here is largely around ownership and fungibility. So unlike non fungible tokens, whose value is derived from their uniqueness from one another, social tokens really have a sort of value around the sameness. They represent sort of a unit of account or measure of value or store of value in a community. So for Jason's example, one crunch is the same as the next crunch.
00:03:19.918 - 00:03:59.286, Speaker C: And so this allows fascinating things to happen. Now, like social tokens can be thought of as a category that could exist on top of defi and create what some people are calling the next creator economy or a defi creator economy. They could also introduce with traditional finance or tradfi. So you could think of social tokens as things that could integrate with things like visa, you could think about spending them at stores or rewards. And these are all things that different parties are exploring. And so it's going to be a massive space. We think it's going to be really the future of how we engage online when things are more asset based.
00:03:59.286 - 00:04:02.894, Speaker C: And. Yeah, it's just a quick analysis there.
00:04:03.014 - 00:04:27.668, Speaker B: Yeah. In many respects, it kind of seems almost like a precursor to all of the NFT stuff happening right now because a lot of those NFTs are very tied to the creator behind them as well, just as these social tokens are very much tied to the creator creator's identity. And we're going to dig into more of that later. But I'm curious, so what drew you to the idea of social tokens? What personally fascinated you enough to bring you into this space and start a company in this vertical so early on?
00:04:27.796 - 00:05:24.834, Speaker C: Yeah, so I've been in this space, I think, professionally since 2015. So late 2015, Brian Zelkas and Pete Rizzo hired me to lead research at Coindesk. And so I was developing these massive state of blockchain reports, 100 page reports, anything from bitcoin mining market share to whatever was the topic at the time covered Ethereum in 2016, really never looked back, saw it as the future of community. Mainly I was obsessed with things. I remember when, like, YouTube created like the donate button on their page or like when Patreon was exploding, I was like, this is amazing. And just every iteration of, like, anything creator that happened, I was really fascinated with. And then all of a sudden I was like, okay, there's this really somewhat byzantine thing called Ethereum in 2016.
00:05:24.834 - 00:05:54.464, Speaker C: I was like, if this in any way interacts with the creator economy, it's over. A lot of web two people talk about first mover advantage. In many ways, social tokens and Ethereum create sort of a last mover advantage. It's moving towards. This is the end state of a community. This is the finality of it, where communities can kind of own capital that's specific to the community but is also a completely independent of platform. And once you wrap your head around that, there's really no looking back.
00:05:54.464 - 00:06:14.246, Speaker C: This stuff isn't possible on web two, it's uniquely possible on web3. And it's even made more powerful with systems that already have decentralized finance established on there. So Ethereum for us, for roles is really great home for the category. Yeah.
00:06:14.350 - 00:06:36.594, Speaker B: And I think on that note, with starting a role as a company, which we'll talk about more in a bit, you've spoken to a lot of influencers. I know there are a lot of big names that you probably can't share yet, but there are a lot of big names that have been announced when you talk to all these influencers. Right? Be they kind of YouTube creators or artists or musicians. What are some of the common pain points they're facing when they use these existing centralized platforms?
00:06:36.714 - 00:07:36.334, Speaker C: Yeah. So a big pain point for them, believe it or not, is control. So they generally feel that they can be demonetized or lose their reach at any point in time. Nothing about how the market around their community is monetized is kind of in their control. And we really see that from, you know, emerging creators to established creators. One creator that is on role is Terry Crews, who created a power token and is most white chicks and idiocracy and all these things. But he gave a really beautiful story in the defiant and in a podcast we did as well about control and power, actually, and not feeling in power and wanting to go towards web3 to establish a sense of power and control.
00:07:36.334 - 00:08:13.274, Speaker C: And so you're seeing that from movie stars to youtubers. And for us it's really just fascinating, even from an anthropological standpoint to see this play out. You watch people growing up and all these different things, but to actually be a part of their journey and how they establish community on the Internet has been fascinating. So we're learning along the way as well, and solving that pain point has kind of become interesting. Obviously, crypto offers a ton of benefits there, specifically social tokens.
00:08:13.354 - 00:08:59.948, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And even for me personally, I always have this fear that Twitter is going to rug me one day and then just kind of delete my account, started collecting emails just so I can own the emails and kind of start my own newsletter as well, because there's always that fear. If you created content for a long enough time and you're dependent on one platform, that that platform could always ruck you. You're kind of at the mercy of whoever owns that platform. So I totally, totally empathize with that point about control. And speaking of control, now, today most creators rely on massive centralized platforms for distribution, right? It's like YouTube, TikTok, onlyfans, sub stack. So if you're coming out and starting these tokens that let creators take full control of their own content and their own destiny, how do you think these companies will react? Do you think they'll be hostile? Have you seen any kind of hostility from these guys?
00:09:00.076 - 00:09:49.154, Speaker C: Well, I think the 2021 answer is they're reaching out and they're trying to learn. So Raul has spoken with also companies at the FAANG level all the way to seed and series a and brands in between can't talk about anything necessarily. But, like, I think NFTs are definitely moving faster than social tokens. So, you know, things like, you know, TikTok creating nfts on, like, immutable, like was not on anyone's 2021 bingo card, but, like, that happened. And so, you know, you'll see similar things happen in the social token space for sure, and in the next few years. So a lot of the larger companies, they're not crypto native companies. They will never be crypto native companies unless they start new companies or projects inside of what they're doing.
00:09:49.154 - 00:09:57.014, Speaker C: And even so, those won't have the DNA of a web3 project unless they acquire it. So they're all trying to learn.
00:09:59.234 - 00:09:59.522, Speaker B: How.
00:09:59.538 - 00:10:16.254, Speaker C: To integrate this technology. And really this philosophy, it's a completely different philosophy than how they run a company. They're really trying to integrate this philosophy into the company and just learn. And that's kind of what we're seeing right now that's really interesting.
00:10:16.294 - 00:10:22.030, Speaker B: So it's more of a story of integration and curiosity than straight out hostility, at least for now.
00:10:22.142 - 00:10:38.124, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say maybe all of the fang, except maybe like the f or the m. The f, is it, I was reading an article and is it fang now? Is it mango?
00:10:39.704 - 00:10:41.024, Speaker B: What's the o in mango?
00:10:41.144 - 00:10:48.472, Speaker C: Oh, someone said it was maybe like Oracle, like they were changing the whole thing. But I guess it would just be manga. If it was manga.
00:10:48.648 - 00:11:13.440, Speaker B: I like that. Yeah. At least it makes more sense than faang to me. Well, I think now we have a pretty great 10,000 foot view of what social tokens are. I'd like to kind of zoom into the company level a little bit because you are really early to social tokens, and roll was one of the first companies in this space. But ever since then there have been a few other companies that came around. So namestyke, fwb, rally, bit, cloud, all these names that people might have heard of before.
00:11:13.440 - 00:11:23.096, Speaker B: Can you help us kind of break down the social token landscape today? What do you think? Are the major players or the major different approaches to social tokens and kind of crypto and culture?
00:11:23.200 - 00:12:01.774, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll definitely talk about all those guys. I think before that, it's really interesting to consider like the inevitable stack for social tokens, like what a social token stack looks like at large. So you can really categorize this, I think, into like four pieces of the stack. So stack one would be the bottom, would be the infrastructure. So it'd be like how social tokens are created. And I would also say how they're quote, financialized. So how social tokens become liquid, have value, or are sort of otherwise financialized, traded, et cetera.
00:12:01.774 - 00:12:36.788, Speaker C: So the second part is the rails. So that's how social tokens move from point a to point b. Either point can be a metamask wallet or a neo bank like chime or your Twitter account. And so it's really important to diversify what those points can be because social tokens are going to be about scale. The third part in the stack is the API layer. So there will be developers who are just focused on streaming or just focus on spatial audio or chat, but they're amazed by what's going on. And so they won't want to build the infrastructure or the rails.
00:12:36.788 - 00:13:12.990, Speaker C: They'll want to work with folks that already have done that. And so folks that have played around or are thinking about the API layer will kind of own how, I'll say, web. Two companies can interact with, with the social token stack. And then last is the application layer. This is where all the fun is going to happen. This is where you're going to ride the social token highway and make it rain social tokens in a streaming platform or just tip people and all that stuff. Understanding the tack in terms of infrastructure, rails, APIs and applications is a really good mental model.
00:13:12.990 - 00:13:59.006, Speaker C: Now I'll talk about some folks that are in this space as well. Yeah, so in addition to role, which we'll get into definitely a few other platforms out there and really great communities. So FWB is a fantastic community started by Trevor McPhedries, creator of Brood and Little Michaela, also role investor and investor in many other projects as well. It's just sort of become a hub for creators and cultures and sort of its own innovative landscape lot going on there. So they'll definitely continue to be sort of a media hub and sort of space for all things crypto creator in the future. You may see some other hubs like that emerge as well. So fantastic community.
00:13:59.006 - 00:15:12.516, Speaker C: Unlike the also on the creator side, there's folks like Whale Shark. So establishing Whale Shark's a role creator who's establishing some incredible models around really sort of gating community access in addition to the idea of storing nfts as sort of a vault concept inside of a community. So he's pretty much one of the first ones to do this as early as last year, which sounds like ten years ago now, a lot of other folks have done this, and you may even see products around an NFT vault concept for social token communities. Yeah. So some other companies out there rally is definitely a player as well as bit cloud, I guess I'll talk about some of the differences between these things, if that's great. So, yeah, so bit cloud is on another blockchain that's not Ethereum from, I think, what they've renamed to Deso or decentralized social. And so it's an interesting play to kind of create an application and then back into a blockchain for us.
00:15:12.516 - 00:15:48.424, Speaker C: What we're excited about primarily like why social tokens are exciting to us, is the idea that they can represent markets that are unbounded. So there are several tokens on roll that have a larger market cap than roll than my company. And this is kind of, this is kind of the point, right? That is uniquely possible through decentralized finance. Right. There's no channel on YouTube that's like the channel itself that's like worth more than YouTube. There's no Patreon account that is worth like, you know, the 5 billion that Patreon was valued at. That's not the case in web3.
00:15:48.424 - 00:16:14.486, Speaker C: There's this wonky world where the markets are totally unbounded. So, yeah, bit cloud's interesting, but I think the journey that they'll have to go on is sort of somehow bringing decentralized finance at scale to another blockchain. And so getting those folks over might be difficult, but really interesting experiment for.
00:16:14.510 - 00:16:23.564, Speaker B: People who are not familiar. Bit cloud kind of resembles Twitter. It basically has a Twitter feed, but then all the people you follow have their own cloud token.
00:16:23.734 - 00:16:57.444, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And I think the idea there would eventually be to create other applications around that. So that's interesting. I think the journey there will be like, how do these things become more interoperable and liquid and financial? So it's exciting. Yeah. Rally is another player. So Rally has sort of created this platform that allows creators to, to mint on it and have a set of rewards and different things like this.
00:16:57.444 - 00:18:02.144, Speaker C: Some of the differences between, let's say, roll and rally in that sense are tokens on rally exist on sort of a side chain, which means they don't necessarily have a contract address on Ethereum. So we're kind of excited about the interoperability between a token like whale and smart contract platform like Uniswap. So we don't have to create an exchange as an example, whereas if you're, if you're playing on a sidechain, you have to create the demand for that side chain itself. So, you know, as well as your own sort of, you know, bonding curve or however you want to think about an exchange. So rally has all that and, you know, it's very, very sort of user friendly. But then again, yeah, the journey to establish eight nine figure markets kind of becomes a bit of a challenge if defi isn't just strapped to the hood of the creator economy you're trying to form. But interesting premise, for sure.
00:18:02.144 - 00:18:27.322, Speaker C: Yeah, those are two players. There's a few more emerging. The next step, or role is really just building out this API layer. We want to see hundreds of these types of platforms in the future. We don't think these are competitive with role at all. We truly see role as infrastructure. So if someone comes out and they want to create the next twitch or they want to create the next clubhouse, that's not competitive with role at all.
00:18:27.322 - 00:18:51.656, Speaker C: We absolutely want to integrate with these platforms, understand how they work and build APIs the same way stripe build APIs that define the gig economy, routing one payment from a gig worker to a gig worker as well as a platform. We want to understand how the intersection of, say, like spatial audio and chat and like social tokens will work, build APIs around them and then deploy them to hundreds of other platforms.
00:18:51.760 - 00:19:18.050, Speaker B: Absolutely. And even throughout that whole explanation, I really like how you're always thinking about composability, right? How do these social tokens pluck into the wider crypto world, not just create like a side chain with its own token kind of just hanging out there, but how do we really plug these creator tokens into this multibillion dollar defi market, which is really fascinating to me, and I think that's a great segue as well to focus on talking about what role is and how it started. And what would you say is the mission for role?
00:19:18.162 - 00:19:56.894, Speaker C: Yeah. So the mission for role, quite simply, is to grow the GDP of the creator economy. And so we're doing that by creating the economic infrastructure that combines both web two and web3. So when we think about role, when we first started, we needed to, there was nothing, the concept of a social token didn't exist. We actually thought of another term that's adjacent called social money, which is more transactional. So there was nothing in late 2018 2019 that led to where we are now. And so we really have to make a lot of educated guesses.
00:19:56.894 - 00:20:37.042, Speaker C: So the first guess, do people want to create their own currency? So the answer was a resounding yes. The timing was great because there were things like uniswap kind of thinking about a v one. How would this work? Getting past things like an ether delta or Bancor for some of the old school people in the space and just creating something a bit more formal. And so in early 2020, which sounds like 15 years ago, we basically created a Uniswap front end for role. Uniswap created a great product called token lists. You can go to tokenlist.org, comma.
00:20:37.042 - 00:21:08.210, Speaker C: You could see your role token. So someone like yourself or creator or anyone, you don't need to know how to create an ERC 20 token. You don't even need to pay gas for it. You don't need a unity. So we're creating these simple ways to integrate and financialize community from there. And so once we did that, we onboarded 300 plus creators. Many of those now have really successful markets and the next step.
00:21:08.210 - 00:21:36.966, Speaker C: So we validated the concept, which is great. And what we wanted to happen is happening. So we wanted to unleash a wave of innovation that many, many, many people could benefit from. Even people that are going to compete with us, it's absolutely fine. Some folks come up to us, they're like, hey, did you see what so and so is? Doing or like, yes, we think it's amazing. Like, there's going to be 47 winners in this space. Like, you know, we're not worried about, this isn't like high school.
00:21:36.966 - 00:22:12.674, Speaker C: Like, we're not worried about what, what someone does. We're really excited about everything that's going on. And so what we're learning, like, in the past five months is that, you know, everyone from, from Faang or manga to, you know, seed companies, series a companies, big brands, agencies, they're all going to want to play in this space, but none of them are going to understand the infrastructure and the rails. They're just going to say, hey, I know, so and so. So and so wants a token. He wants it to do this and this and this. And we'll basically say, okay, let's go.
00:22:12.674 - 00:23:07.146, Speaker C: And if it's something we can't do, we're just going to find the players that want to do it right. So we're not going to create, you know, we're not going to effectively going to like, you know, work with Walmart and allow you to, like, spend crunchies at Walmart and get a shirt. Like, we're going to work with a party that, you know, already has built like a web two payment rail to do that and kind of plug in these things. We're not going to rebuild Twitter. We're just going to integrate into their APIs and so anyone that has a token can use it on Twitter through this. We really feel that something like role, probably role is going to begin to upgrade the Internet in this way. We're excited because we're not going to be the exchange, we're not going to be the side chain, we're not going to be the platform.
00:23:07.146 - 00:23:38.128, Speaker C: We just want to be the infrastructure. So there's going to be 40, 50, 60, 7100 plus winners in this space and we're going to pretty much work with all of them. And that's kind of something we're really excited about moving forward. So API hackathons for spatial audio and chat and all these different types of things. Hey, we onboarded this person. They want to do this. How can we all work together to move this forward? This person wants to create a Dao.
00:23:38.128 - 00:23:52.312, Speaker C: This person wants to create this. How do we think about working together to make the most value in the creator economy? And that's what kind of gets me up every day. I'm excited about what a lot of other people are doing and how we work together.
00:23:52.448 - 00:24:09.462, Speaker B: Absolutely. It's awesome. You've created role. This company that is the infrastructure layer for all social tokens. You help creators create their own social tokens. Can you talk about the product itself? Is it an app right now that people can go on and mint their own tokens? Is it more of a service? What does that business model look like?
00:24:09.558 - 00:24:52.890, Speaker C: Yeah, so right now, role is an app. And so you can go to app dot terrell.com dot, you can sign up. Creating a token for now, we've thought of as like a permissioned process because we, I think, have a big response, like an Uber level responsibility for introducing this category to the wider world, whether that's like, you know, the SEC or the FTC, or just traditional bodies or traditional creators or platforms. So we really wanted to have that trade off and just guide things. So we didn't want tokens to be named after, you know, racial epithets or like, or have a Jayz token. So there has to be some level of permission there.
00:24:52.890 - 00:25:38.364, Speaker C: Eventually, that permission won't be the company, it'll be another governing body. But someone needs to govern that process. But once that process is approved by whatever body, you could have your own token with its own ticker, and it could interact with the role app, which right now is pretty similar to PayPal. It's an app that you could send and receive these whitelisted ERC 20 tokens very easily. You could spend them, use them. We have this unique feature called earn codes, so you can create a little code like a bitly style link and just blast that out to folks behind the scenes. We're plugging into just about everything that makes sense.
00:25:38.364 - 00:26:01.922, Speaker C: So in the future, a bunch of web, two platforms right now, web through infra, obviously, Ethereum, Uniswap, and yeah, whatever we think is useful. Lots of apps have come along that on platforms like Discord that folks use, like collab land and others. And so we're opening up our API slowly to parties like that so people can use the role wallet and whatever app comes along they want to use.
00:26:02.018 - 00:26:57.520, Speaker A: Now, before I continue, I'd love to share one of my favorite products in crypto with you. Now, whenever I want to trade a token, instead of going to uniswap sushiswap bancor one by one to see where I can find the best quote, I just go to Paraswap to scan for the best price anywhere, because per swap aggregates all the popular Ethereum dexs and saves me a ton of time and headache in finding where I can trade something for the best price and lets me trade in one place. Now, the cool thing is theyve also integrated with ledger live as well, meaning I can now swap at the best prices directly from my ledger wallet. So seriously, if youre a Defi trader and youre worried about the security risks of centralized exchanges, but you also dont want to scour dozens of dexs just to find the best price, you have to check out Periswap. So head on over to Paraswap IO blockcrunch. I'd also love to take a moment to talk about the Hbar foundation. Now if you approached me one to two years ago, I would tell you I'm really skeptical of layer one systems outside of Ethereum.
00:26:57.520 - 00:27:43.506, Speaker A: But in the past twelve months I started to notice billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of users flocking to new blockchains left and right. And then I realized there's an actual market gap being filled. And I always love to support projects who support builders, and one of those projects is Hedera Hashgraph. Hedera is an enterprise grade public network with its own crypto asset called HbAr, and the Hbar foundation has launched with an initial budget of over $2 billion to provide entrepreneurs with the funding and ecosystem support needed to quickly build and deploy new applications on the Hedera hashgraph network. The HbAR foundation is eager to find builders in deFi, NFTs, gaming, sustainability, and all sectors. So if you are a builder, a developer, or creator with an idea, visit hbarfoundation.org to learn more.
00:27:43.650 - 00:28:27.250, Speaker D: I'd love to talk a little bit about notional if you've followed the show for long enough, you know I'm pretty excited about fixed rate products. Notional finance is the leading fixed rate borrowing and lending protocol, and they've just released a major upgrade. With notional, you can not only borrow and lend at fixed rates for up to one year now, but liquidity providers also have a pretty good opportunity. Thanks to an integration with compound and a liquidity mining program, LP's can actually earn interest, liquidity fees and token liquidity mining incentives as well. We've talked with Teddy from notional recently, and as a happy investor as well, I've been pretty impressed with how the team is building this critical infrastructure that will help onboard the next billion users to deFi. So you can check it out today at Notional Finance blockcrunch.
00:28:27.362 - 00:28:49.730, Speaker B: Absolutely, and I feel really lucky to be able to see one of the first versions of the app itself and kind of test it out and see all these tokens. I think it was a year or so ago and there were a lot of really different use cases and really creative ways that people are using tokens on role. And so can you talk about some of the more interesting examples of what creators on the platforms are doing with their tokens?
00:28:49.842 - 00:29:24.356, Speaker C: Yeah, you know, when we started in 2019, we wanted to really think about what was going to happen. It's so wild to predict what's even going to happen a year from now. Like, no one could have predicted what 2021 was going to be like at all. No one thought, even folks in the NFT space, they all thought this was maybe like three, four years away. So for us, we really thought these tokens would be more of a transactional element, a lot like loyalty. So like, hey, spend tokens to get from a to b. And we kind of set up the system like that.
00:29:24.356 - 00:30:19.064, Speaker C: We were right in a sense of rewards. So we quickly saw a lot of creators increase the KPI's that they want to achieve on other platforms through tokens. So one KPI, if you're a Patreon creator, maybe getting your patrons to the next level, you may have level one, which is $5, but level two is like $50. And so you want more people on level two for sure. And so a great way to do that was to create another platform independent reward mechanism for those top 10% of people that maybe they just need a little push to get to the next level. And it turns out that pushes your own social token, a new representation of community that they of course, need to be a part of because it's coming from you. We saw people getting deplatformed or people's platform just leaving.
00:30:19.064 - 00:30:54.218, Speaker C: So we had streamers that were on platforms like D live or Mixer. Mixer went under. And for whatever reason, some folks wanted to move from dlive to other platforms like Twitch. And you can't move your Twitch points, you can't move your D live virtual currency, but you can move your role. Social token, they actually used it as a tool to migrate communities from one platform to another. That's been very cool to see. Social tokens are flying around Twitter all the time as well.
00:30:54.218 - 00:31:27.676, Speaker C: People kind of use our codes on Twitter. A few people have used them on panels. You can create QR codes on role as well and just kind of leave it up there for folks to jam on. So that's on the web two, reward side. There's been deep innovation on the web3 side too, which is fascinating. There's so many. I wish I could just like one day I'm just going to create a list of like an RFP just like a request for projects that should exist, but, like, in the social token space.
00:31:27.676 - 00:31:59.912, Speaker C: But some pretty fascinating things are in the same way that creators collaborate in web two, maybe on YouTube. So, like, you know, one creator will go on another creator's video, like, they'll collab and go back and forth. So we're seeing that. We saw that with tokens as well. So we had, you know, two role creators sort of collab by, you know, through staking, through the staking rewards. You can stake one creator's token with ETH and you can get another creators reward back to back. And the overall result was like a strong rise in liquidity.
00:31:59.912 - 00:32:41.490, Speaker C: So that was, that was really cool to see earlier on, I would say less so now. Folks were pretty fascinated. This was like a 2019 thing, like early 2020. Folks were pretty fascinated with the idea of, like, one token for my time. And so that kind of died out because what we really think the future is is social tokens representing self expression as a digital asset, which means the main use of your social token may have nothing to do with you. So let's imagine we onboard Rihanna. Rihanna has a nation of millions of people that she calls the navy.
00:32:41.490 - 00:33:28.604, Speaker C: Let's say her social token is called navy. There's many people in that nation that have their own ideas. So there's Rihanna Navy Brazil and Rihanna Navy Italia. And they have very different ideas in their favorite Rihanna song, and they battle it out all the time and they express themselves. So those parties may use navy in a lot of different ways than Rihanna uses it. And that's okay. If there were a platform that allowed you to express yourself in the token of another person by, let's say, gating that content, and only people that hold, in Rihanna's case, Navy, can view that you're creating this reaction for people to effectively engage in the community by buying and holding the token.
00:33:28.604 - 00:34:12.864, Speaker C: So that's creating economic events in this microwave, but in a really constant way. Imagine if every time, imagine if every retweet was sort of this sort of web3 buy and hold opportunity. So we really think the future will look something like that. So that's kind of exciting to think about and see. And we're talking to folks that are interested in doing that. Yeah, I'd say the most fascinating thing is the application layers starting to hit a little bit. So folks just creating, I think, what's now become commonplace in 2021, but we really pushed for in 2020, like, really hard was.
00:34:12.864 - 00:34:43.208, Speaker C: Yeah, people gating communities with social tokens. So now that's kind of evolved to nfts as well. Social tokens are probably a better fit because everyone benefits. I could hold one social token even though it's 100 to kind of gated and get involved, you see. And you know, you're starting to see what I talked about as well. So you're starting to see other communities where the creator isn't a part of like almost fan clubs of the club emerge. And so, you know, but it's the same token, so it's nothing to do with the creator of the token.
00:34:43.208 - 00:35:05.296, Speaker C: Maybe it's like, you know, this club Brazil or this club New York or something else. And so that's the beginning, right? So it's going to start with, you know, an asynchronous mob chat, but it could easily move to an image or post. We're not going to build that. But once someone builds that and it hits, that's going to be an application for a minute.
00:35:05.400 - 00:35:34.984, Speaker B: That's really, that's really cool. This idea of kind of bridging web3 tokens and using tokens as an incentive to generate demand and adoption on other applications. I'm curious, do these applications have to be web3 applications as well? Because for the first example you mentioned, which is people using tokens to optimize KPI on another platform. So say I will give people crunchy tokens if they subscribe to my YouTube channel. Am I relying on YouTube's API to grant access? And how do I distribute those tokens?
00:35:35.104 - 00:36:23.072, Speaker C: Yeah, so as far as roles gotten, we've really just wanted to test that out. It's wildly true and successful. So we've seen this on Twitch with donations, YouTube with subscriptions. Like you could even call it like subscription mining or subscription mining blank blank, morning, whatever you want, whatever the flavor of the month is there. But yeah, you know, for role you're really relying on, it's really local, which is like, you know, you're really relying on, you know, either, either knowing that, you know, person that subscribed or them kind of saying it at home base, whether it's a discord or whatever or. Yeah, or these, these earn codes that we have and just manually sending it to folks, there's a lot to think about before it turns ugly. Right.
00:36:23.072 - 00:36:58.994, Speaker C: So I'm sure you've seen massive stream farms for you know, for whatever, whether it's subscribing or listening. We saw a stream for him. I think it would go viral the other day. It was like an axie play to earn farm. And so yeah, we really wanted to think about how to do this in the right way before we introduced like, you know, the power of like web, three tokens into something simple. So how can you make it more civil, resistant and things like that? But that's coming for sure. We're just going to do it in a way that we think will work a little better.
00:36:59.114 - 00:37:07.474, Speaker B: Got it. So for now, the process is still somewhat manual, but once you figure it out, the civil resistance and some of these other key questions, it will be more automated. Yeah.
00:37:07.594 - 00:37:55.306, Speaker C: So maybe you could imagine maybe a delegation process. Like, okay, everyone's in the crunchies, but I really know that like 100 people are into crunchies. So if those hundred people connect their role wallet to their YouTube, then they can just watch to earn. Or maybe if they connect to their sub stack or whatever, or their twitter, I could just create a mass send out to folks. And so, yeah, those are kind of the next steps. But yeah, we really think that that's going to be the beginning. That's going to create developer demand for folks to create massive, truly decentralized social network, web3 networks.
00:37:55.306 - 00:38:01.106, Speaker C: They're going to need to see things like this first and make sure people are doing those habits easily.
00:38:01.250 - 00:38:25.626, Speaker B: Yeah. And from what you're saying, it sounds like, at least to me, I think these web two companies will actually be very open to ideas like this because they themselves don't have to build the tokens, they don't have to worry about the infrastructure layer, but you're actually creating tools that would generate more demand and usage for their platforms. So I don't really see any reason why, say, YouTube would want to like shut off access to raw at all. But do you have you kind of thought about that? Is there a risk that you're still somewhat dependent on these web two companies or.
00:38:25.730 - 00:39:05.638, Speaker C: No, I think it's quite the opposite. I think, I think this is going to be so addictive for them and so foreign to them. We're literally like, you know, we're literally like Martians, kind of like coming in on there home base and be like, what is this crazy, you know, technology? How are you flying? Like, what is this crazy technology you're using? And so, you know, we're kind of teaching them what DeFi is and how these things exist. And I think the thing you need to keep on telling them is like they can't own it. Like, this isn't something like once you try and own it, it's over. Like we're not going to come back. And so some of them are having a difficult time kind of thinking through that.
00:39:05.638 - 00:39:32.098, Speaker C: But it's interesting to have those conversations. I spoke to a few today, definitely looking for a partnerships lead. I'll just shout that out for the watchers out there, listeners. But yeah, so generally they're trying to learn and they're trying to get smarter on it so they can be a part of the category. They will be a part of the category. They're all just currently trying to learn. I'd say for the rest of 2021, definitely.
00:39:32.146 - 00:40:04.806, Speaker B: And yeah, you hear that, listeners? If any of you want to work in one of the most exciting companies and social tokens, slide into Bradley's DM's on Twitter. And we're going to come back to that in a bit as well in terms of how people can reach out. But this is a question that I love asking founders because I think the idea of social tokens is super cool. And as you know, I was one of the earlier guys to kind of test this out. But I also kind of struggle to think of who is the person today that's kind of dying to use this product today. The, I think the product vision is really compelling. I definitely see myself kind of using this once the tools are more integrated with, you know, my podcast feeds and all that.
00:40:04.806 - 00:40:08.766, Speaker B: But then who's the person today that is just kind of dying to use? Role?
00:40:08.910 - 00:41:11.606, Speaker C: Yeah. So we think role is for anyone that has a community on the Internet and wants to monetize it. So if you have an interest in creating a community and monetizing it, that's pretty much the threshold from there. If you are interested in giving your communities, if get in giving your community a say in something or having your community achieve like a deeper sense of belonging or status or like creating, like creating a new system in your community around like, you know, something like around a sense of belonging, that's like a really good candidate. So I'll give an example. So you may call this like micro governance, but like in web two, for the past ten years, there's been this really big pattern. You could just google this on YouTube of like, my followers choose my ex.
00:41:11.606 - 00:42:09.968, Speaker C: And so, you know, if you type that in, you'll see people, you know, my followers choose my hair color for the day. My followers choose what I wear. Typically this is happening on Instagram or Twitter in a poll sense. And so they'll get answers in the poll. This would be a beautiful web3 product, by the way, if someone created a social token based polling app in your token, and then, so once they have that, they go and do the activity. And so we found folks that it's playful, but we found that folks that like to creators that like to give their users that sort of option or experience, they love social tokens. They love, they may not be, they may have never heard the word dao or anything like that, but they love the idea of having the power and control to give to their community whenever they want.
00:42:09.968 - 00:42:37.908, Speaker C: They don't even need to know about DeFi or think about it as a new market or something like that. We can teach them everything along the way. But if you're someone that literally just wants to give more to your community and monetize along the way, like 100% great candidate. Obviously web3 natives are really great, but so is terry crews. So is anyone that really wants to think about their community in this new light.
00:42:38.036 - 00:43:01.264, Speaker B: Absolutely. That's a phenomenal answer. And yeah, I got to say, whoever's creating the social token polling app, definitely reach out because this is something I will use. I will personally use this thing. This is an idea that I've thought about for a long time as well. How do we make this podcast almost like a Dao, where people can vote on what guests to bring on and who to host the next episode? So, yeah, if anyone's out there building this, definitely let me know. We have.
00:43:01.564 - 00:43:17.056, Speaker C: It can really just be like a microfilm fun snapshot. It's hard to introduce snapshots like a youtuber or something, but if it's like a super fun thing that can just like a Twitter extension, discord extension, that's super fun and engaging and new for a lot of people.
00:43:17.120 - 00:43:32.138, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And now for the people out there, the creators out there who want to reach out to you and create their own tokens, what would you say are the most important considerations or the most common pitfalls that you've seen with creators making their own tokens unroll?
00:43:32.226 - 00:44:08.054, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think a creator, creators are becoming the center of the Internet. So that's really exciting. Tools like nfTs, social tokens, and Defi, like allow them to do that, but really that makes them leaders. Creators are always leaders, and so leaders need to have vision. And so I think this goes just across the board. Whether you're launching a Patreon or a YouTube channel, you just need to have an idea of what you're doing for it to be successful. You obviously had a really good idea of how to create this podcast before you did it.
00:44:08.054 - 00:44:46.712, Speaker C: It'd be really good to understand what you want to do with your token, what you want it to be called. I can give a whole thesis on the evolution of naming tokens from 2019 to now. They used to be named tokens. People used to call these personal tokens because they named them after themselves. Then it emerged to community and social, which is where we are now. So understand what you want to call it, the differences, understand the utility, what you can do with it, and even some of the constraints. If you want to automate this and have this person like this and get a token, we're liking this.
00:44:46.712 - 00:45:48.344, Speaker C: We're not really there yet, but if you want to think about ownership or giving back in a new way, like, we're totally there. So whether it's a discord or telegram or some new application or even just a way, we have people that just use. Shout out to Connie Digital, who created Hue. He integrated social tokens into his newsletter. So every week you can follow Connie Digital's newsletter and you can get some hue, you know, and he has a massive, super early on nfts, massive fan base. There's so have an idea of how you want to use it, where you want to aggregate community. Do you want it to be around your newsletter? Do you just want to chill, have it be more async there? Or do you want it to be real time? Do you want to use it on Twitch? Do you want to use it on discord? Once you have that, I think you're ready to go team role and just the wider space as well can really embrace folks that come along.
00:45:48.344 - 00:46:11.324, Speaker C: It's a wild ride from there, right? So, you know, we never thought we'd see markets in the nine figure range for creators and things like this, but it's happening. Big shout out to Huobi. So they were part of our round and I believe they were the first exchange that has listed something that people would call a social token. So we'll be listed.
00:46:11.484 - 00:46:12.636, Speaker B: Which one was this?
00:46:12.820 - 00:47:13.970, Speaker C: Yeah, so what? We listed whale two months ago and even that concept is fascinating, right? Like we created whale with whale shark, and a lot of creators really look up to that token. So if you're a creator right now, even that spark, that one tiny moment, it changes you from saying like, oh, wow, maybe the aspiration isn't, isn't a million followers, maybe the aspiration is $9 million in liquidity and like a, you know, nine figure market cap. And like everyone that, you know, I brought along the way benefiting like, that sounds crazy, you know, and so that's going to happen over and over and over and over again. So, you know, we're really just like we have to hammer like, you know, uniswap and social tokens or just like token gated access. Like all that stuff's here now. So we're going to keep on hammering. We're going to keep on doing the new innovative stuff that folks can just integrate with and can then become more ubiquitous.
00:47:14.122 - 00:47:29.314, Speaker B: Definitely, definitely. And you also mentioned the point about NFTs, and I'd love to get your thoughts on how has the growth of NFTs this year, and I guess by association meme coins as well. How have those things impacted the adoption and attention for social tokens.
00:47:29.434 - 00:48:14.764, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say it's all part of the creator economy, meme coins in like the funniest way. I never thought I'd see like multiple meme coins just cracking the top 100 or top 150. Like I thought those days were over, but they're, they're not. But yeah, it's all like a really playful part of the creator economy for sure. So they're all going to kind of play on top of each other. A lot of NFT utility I think will become social token utility once it becomes bigger. But yeah, a lot of folks learn about role through nfTs.
00:48:14.764 - 00:48:38.252, Speaker C: So we had a bunch of creators reach out roles go to market. Initially was NFT creators, so that's how we ended up working with hundreds of them. And then NFT creators became just content creators and then content creators now becoming NFT creators and they're finding out about role and what's going on as well. So I think they'll kind of play off each other, which is great.
00:48:38.348 - 00:48:51.644, Speaker B: Most definitely. Now, I think as we come to the last part of our conversation, I'd love to get your maybe one bold prediction for the future of social tokens and also ways for people to reach out to you if they want to help you build out role.
00:48:51.764 - 00:49:32.712, Speaker C: Yeah. So one bold prediction, most fintech platforms and social platforms will become social token platforms by 2025. What that means is where you bank. Like if you have an Internet bank, it will have a space for social tokens, whether it's a chime or what they will and why. We think this is because creators run the Internet. Where creators go, the Internet will go if role is successful. And most creators have their own currents, so every creator that wants their own currency has one.
00:49:32.712 - 00:50:17.052, Speaker C: The economics of what it means to create an application on the Internet will bend towards the concept of social tokens. And so whether you want to create, you know, the next, you know, creator debit card or a neo bank or the next you know, clubhouse or, you know, your metaverse. You know, you're going to have to play with this category because it's a reinterpretation on a first principles level of community as a digital asset. That's fundamentally what we believe that, like, no one else really has believed. So that's kind of like the premise. Twitter doesn't think that, or anyone else. And so if you think about the future of community as a digital asset, that digital asset has to be everywhere.
00:50:17.052 - 00:50:37.374, Speaker C: Community exists on the Internet. And so that's kind of one thing that we think to be true. Yeah. And so obviously APIs are very exciting premise for a principal like that. Yeah. Guys, we're doing a bunch of hiring on the engineering side. My co founder Sid's super busy recruiting.
00:50:37.374 - 00:51:19.458, Speaker C: So if you're a front end engineer, there's a ton of work we need from you guys there. If you're a backend engineer with some API experience, you don't have to be X stripe or PayPal or whatever. If you just have API experience on the back end, we'd love to work with you. We have projects for designers. If you used to work at Patreon or YouTube and you just love creators, we'd love to talk to you. We're not going to be the home of creator support, but I think some other folks may take that. But like, we definitely need to get that off the ground and kind of like create the framework for what that means.
00:51:19.458 - 00:51:32.054, Speaker C: Yeah. Closing in on a compliance lease. So that's really good. And that's about everything. Lawyers holler at me. Thinking of the general counsel next year. Yeah.
00:51:32.554 - 00:51:35.920, Speaker B: And if people want to reach out to you, what, what is the best way for them to do that?
00:51:36.042 - 00:51:59.204, Speaker C: Yeah. So stalk me on Twitter or like Dm Bradley Miles. And I love emails. I love random emails from people. I used to randomly email people. And so how. I got a few checks in our seed round, which was cool way back when, but yeah.
00:51:59.204 - 00:52:10.792, Speaker C: So bradleyroll.com t r y r o l L. Happy to talk to anyone and just jam with them, even if you're curious about what we're doing.
00:52:10.928 - 00:52:13.712, Speaker B: Definitely. Yeah, I'll definitely include those in the show notes below as well.
00:52:13.808 - 00:52:15.112, Speaker A: Well, Bradley, thank you so much for.
00:52:15.128 - 00:52:18.080, Speaker B: Taking the time for this. This has been really enlightening and really fun.
00:52:18.272 - 00:52:19.544, Speaker C: Awesome. Jason, always a pleasure.
