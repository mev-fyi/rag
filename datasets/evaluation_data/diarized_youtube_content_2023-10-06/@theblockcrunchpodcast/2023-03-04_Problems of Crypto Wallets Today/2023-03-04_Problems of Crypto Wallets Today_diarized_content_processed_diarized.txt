00:00:01.120 - 00:00:13.830, Speaker A: But if we think about what this account is, it's fundamentally just an account. It's not programmable. It's just sitting there. It's controlled by this one private key. If you lose a private key, you're screwed. You lose access to everything we just spoke about. Right.
00:00:13.830 - 00:00:41.302, Speaker A: Whether that could be millions of dollars. It's your reputation. It's all your future airdrops. So it's pretty devastating to lose your private key. For users to even think about private keys, I think people generally forget how intimidating it is if you're not crypto native, right? Even if you're crypto native, you have to think about things like non to use attacks. Sort of look at what went to mute kind of did recently. I think the reason they got hacked was because of one of these things.
00:00:41.302 - 00:00:58.904, Speaker A: You might tell your friend to go buy a ledger. They buy it on Amazon, and when they get it from Amazon, someone already kind of wrote down the private key and they input it. Right? So, like, I think if you're not crypto native, and even if you are, there's so many ways for this to go wrong just because of how important private keys are.
