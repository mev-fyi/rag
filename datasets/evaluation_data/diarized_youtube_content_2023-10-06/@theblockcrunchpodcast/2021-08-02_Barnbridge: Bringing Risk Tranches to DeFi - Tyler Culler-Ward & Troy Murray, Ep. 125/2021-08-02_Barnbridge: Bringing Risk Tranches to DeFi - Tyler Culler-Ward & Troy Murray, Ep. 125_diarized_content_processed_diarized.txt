00:00:01.560 - 00:00:19.246, Speaker A: Welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the show for crypto natives. Every week we do short but in depth conversations with the most important builders and investors in crypto so you can filter through what's noise and stay ahead of the markets. I'm your host, Jason Choi. Nothing on this show should be construed as financial advice, and my guests, myself and my employer may hold positions and.
00:00:19.270 - 00:00:20.742, Speaker B: Assets discussed on the show.
00:00:20.878 - 00:01:19.086, Speaker C: Today's episode is brought to you by our sponsors, Nexo, Radix, and Bittrex. Stick around to learn more. As you know, if you've been following the show for a while, most of our episodes have to do with decentralized finance, and throughout the past 100 episodes or so weve been talking to founders in DeFi to not just understand how the projects work, but where they are headed 510 years from now. When I ask myself that question, to me its very evident that there will be new types of markets that emerge in crypto and were already seeing signs of that, where people can now trade things like spare storage, compute tokenized stocks, tokenized prediction market outcomes. Basically, youll be able to create markets out of everything, and it's logical to me that from these new markets we will see new market infrastructure to support them. So I'm constantly on the lookout for new DeFi primitives, and one of the most popular verticals that people have been talking about lately is fixed income and structured products. So there are projects like Saffron and Barnbridge, the latter of which has been talked about quite a lot lately.
00:01:19.086 - 00:01:34.402, Speaker C: So I wanted to invite the founders of Barnbridge, Tyler and Troy to talk about why they are building structured risk tranches for DeFi, what exactly that means, and how it works. I'm super excited to share this episode with you, but before I get to it, here is a message from our sponsor.
00:01:34.498 - 00:01:54.322, Speaker A: Today's episode is brought to you by the good folks from Nexo. In this crisis, many investors aim to keep and grow their digital assets. Others seek to maximize the yield on their cash. Nexo allows you to achieve exactly these two goals. The company offers instant crypto credit lines against all major cryptocurrencies. With interest rates starting from only 5.9% APR.
00:01:54.322 - 00:02:07.090, Speaker A: Nexo also lets you earn up to 8% annually on your fiat and digital assets. What's more, interest is paid out daily. That means you can add or withdraw your funds at any time. So get started today at Nexo IO.
00:02:07.202 - 00:02:15.014, Speaker B: Hey everybody, I'm super excited to have Tyler Ward and Troy Murray, the co founders of Barnbridge on the show. So, Tyler Troy, welcome to the show.
00:02:15.594 - 00:02:16.930, Speaker D: We're happy to be here.
00:02:17.082 - 00:02:18.214, Speaker E: Thanks for having us.
00:02:18.954 - 00:02:38.434, Speaker B: Now, so both of you have been in crypto for a while before even Barnbridge. So instead of having you walk through your entire resumes, which could be another episode in and of itself, I'll just ask you guys this. I'm curious about what is one thing for each of you that you've done in crypto that you're most proud of outside of Bnbridge? Tyler, why don't you start first?
00:02:39.614 - 00:04:08.824, Speaker D: Oh, that's actually a good question. So I did a lot of marketing and branding and I guess, like, high level architecture for a lot of projects that ico'd through 2017 and early 2018. I feel like the space got pretty spammy in, like, maybe March of 2018, but I feel like I was helpful in raising a lot of money that paid for things that are getting built now, either through, like, forks or even the ideation phase. So a lot of the really, really early stuff that launched in 2017, other than maybe, like, Makerdao, isn't, like, isn't a massive success from the token holders perspective, but if they stuck with crypto and defi and, like, kind of followed it up to this point, a lot of, like, the code that we wrote, the standards that were created, the stuff that, like, was funded by early work that we did, like, is what's paving way for, like, what we have now. So I worked with a lot of good projects and a lot of bad projects, but I feel like if we hadn't done what we did in those early days, we might not be where we are today. And it wasn't just me, but I was at least a part of a lot of. We funded a lot of research, and I think that's probably what I'm most proud of.
00:04:09.844 - 00:04:11.984, Speaker B: That's awesome. Troy, what about you?
00:04:12.404 - 00:04:57.684, Speaker E: I think the most important thing I've done so far is kind of dive deep into the idea of using daos or a large amount of entities to curate media, but also just kind of exploring how that level of governance can actually control a protocol. So if you look at, like, a lot of what's going in Defi now, specifically around, like, synthetix or even Aave and Barmbridge, a lot of that early work has kind of given me the insight into how you can use governance layers to control a protocol and how you can get there without running afoul of certain things. I guess I put it that way.
00:04:58.584 - 00:05:17.764, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot of things that we could unpack there for another episode. But for now, I'd love to talk about Barnbridge, because you guys have described this Barnbridge project as being able to do types of financial transactions that you can't necessarily do without smart contracts. So what exactly is Barnbridge and what does it do? And either of you feel free to take this.
00:05:18.544 - 00:06:21.686, Speaker D: I can take this one as Tyler. So I should preface it that I wouldn't say that Barnbridge or anything in crypto is going to completely replace things that you can do in tradfi. You can do things that you can do with tradfi through Barnbridge or through smart contracts. The issue is efficiency. So it's like, can you do them as efficiently? So, like, you can create, like, price stabilization, like, alpha strategies, but they're, like, a, super hard to structure, and b, there's not a lot of, like, aftermarket liquidity for these, like, super complex structuring. And they don't have the ability to, like, exist as their own token that you can then go and trade and use collateral with. So I think that, like, financial structuring has gotten, like, so scientific that you could realistically structure anything in a trust.
00:06:21.686 - 00:07:21.944, Speaker D: I mean, like, if the brightest minds in the world were working on Wall street from, like, 1980 to 1995 or even 2005. I don't, I don't want to say that you can't build anything like this, but you can't build anything like this with the same level of immutability and efficiency. So, like, the inherent underlying function of what Barnbridge is doing is it's tokenizing risk. And so, like, you can securitize risk, right? I don't think that anything in Defi is going to necessarily do something that you can't do in tradfi. And so, like, you'll see people try to get you in these, like, gotcha moments of, like, well, you can do that with, like, a perpetual futures contract that you can short and then buy a delta option that does this. But, like, that, you can't put that all into one proof of liquidity that represents the risk and then trade that risk one to one outright. And, like, that's what crypto changes.
00:07:21.944 - 00:08:16.974, Speaker D: It's, it doesn't do nothing about smart contracts is gonna do something that you can't do without them. It's a matter of how much more efficient that it makes everything. And that's where I say, like, you really can't do things in tradfi, that you can do things similarly with smart contracts, like the traceability, the ability to look at all of these derivatives, when they're put into other derivatives, the ability to track all of that on chain, the ability to then trade it, move it to other places, that's what I mean when I say you can't, you can't do this. In tradfi, it truly is creating a new primitive that has the potential to change finance. But I want to say that with an asterisk, that if you were to say you can't do these things, I'm not sure that it's easy to say that, but it's another thing to actually show someone how it works.
00:08:18.074 - 00:08:32.534, Speaker B: That's a really interesting perspective. I'd love to dive deeper into how Barnbridge actually works. Can you give us an example of how someone would use Barnbridge? What do you mean when you say you tokenize risk? And again, either of you feel free to take this.
00:08:33.634 - 00:09:42.944, Speaker D: I can take that one too. So when you talk about risk in finance, you're normally talking about monetary risk, that something will go up and down in value. There's other risks, there's scarcity risk, when you have smart contract risks that they talk about in crypto, which is probably the number one thing other than just general risk management, that's holding trad five back. Basically, when you look at risk from a finance perspective, it's not like all encompassing. So I don't want to paint this as a broad stroke of Barnbridge is going to fix everything, but it will help you trade in and out of positions that pertain to whether or not an asset is going to go up or down in value without having to put it into an options contract or some type of futures contracts. So, like, what smart contracts allow you to do, which is amazing and like, was really mind blowing for me, is that there's really like two ways that an asset can change price. It's either the income stream that's coming in is going to change.
00:09:42.944 - 00:10:30.964, Speaker D: So, like, rent in a market drops, like, real estate values drop. If, like, yields change, the price of bonds change, dividends change, the price of stocks change. Like, if Johnson, and Johnson says tomorrow they're dropping the dividend, well, the stock's going down. So, like, there is an inherent, like aspect that they would teach you in finance, like college in America. Like the present value of an asset is the, is the future value of cash flows. And so that's one way that we would look at, like risk from a price fluctuation perspective. There's also risk from just general alpha like commodities, which are what, at least in the United States, that crypto assets are mostly categorized as they don't like, behave as commodities.
00:10:30.964 - 00:11:00.502, Speaker D: They're not like wheat or corn, or even gold or silver. There's different types of fluctuations that you see with them that have nothing to do with that. But suffice to say that it's not always just the future value of cash flows is the present value of an asset. Bitcoin's never been a productive asset. ETH generally just became one. But it wasn't up to this point. And we saw these massive fluctuations that had nothing to do with cash flows.
00:11:00.502 - 00:12:20.812, Speaker D: So what Barnbridge allows you to do is to take a pool of money, which everything in defi is pretty much pools. They're all pools with smart contracts that dictate how the pool of money is going to behave. Like, you can essentially write like if then statements into pools of money, which was always the premise of ETH to me, which was that you could write if then statements into money, period. So if you look at like, you have a pool of capital that you can structure, if, like, the income stream goes up or down, then basket one makes more than basket two if it goes in a different direction, and basket two makes more than basket one, that can help you mitigate risks, or trade in and out of risk on the yield side, or on the income side, or like rent or dividends, like I was saying, then on the other side, you can just generally do that off of alpha. You can just say like, if ETH appreciates in terms of Dai, and creates a positive alpha or negative alpha scenario, not every dollar in that pool deserves the same percentage of that price volatility. You can basically split it out, where, like, one pool gets. Like one part of the pool gets 30%, and one part of the pool gets 70%.
00:12:20.812 - 00:13:31.594, Speaker D: And what I mean by part of the pool, this is like the true, I guess, beauty of Barnbridge, is that you can have a tokenized representation, or a proof of liquidity of what's in that pool, and the way that the smart contract is designed to give your proof of liquidity x fluctuation that you deserve. So if you bet the right side of that bet, when you restake that on the pool, after it's all said and done, you get like, what? You either lose the bet or you win the bet. You basically have a tokenized representation of the bet that you took. And unlike betting markets in traditional finance, those tokenized representations will have massive secondary market liquidity. Like, that's what a bond is. It's kind of a representation of risk, but with a massive asterisk there. It doesn't have the same fungibility or traceability on chain that a proof of risk like coming from Barmbridge would have.
00:13:33.294 - 00:13:54.014, Speaker B: So it sounds like you guys are creating basically different risk tranches or debt with different seniority, which are typically very common structures in traditional finance. So is the target user more of the kind of institutional side, the crypto funds more sophisticated users or who are the major types of users you see that will use Barnbridge?
00:13:54.514 - 00:14:47.254, Speaker D: I think we're going to find that out later. I think that there's credence to both sides. So, like in traditional finance, when people think about tranches, they're normally talking about like CDO's and all the stuff that we learned about in like the financial crisis. And the reason that those got so out of hand is because you basically had baskets of CDo's that were inside other CDO's. And you'd have to like unpack the entire like, trust or security to see like, okay, this company or this trust of these CDO's that have CDo's from like all over the world essentially make up this tranche. And like, there may be CDo's inside those tranches once you unpack them. And like, the average, like, investor can't ever get that level of like, sophistication.
00:14:47.254 - 00:15:30.130, Speaker D: And honestly, the banks and Wall street didn't have that level of sophistication. That's why it took them like four or five years to even unpack what was in these things. But the difference between this is what I mean by like the efficiency of blockchain is a lot of people are like, oh, Barnbridge is bringing CDo's to blockchain. That sounds great. That sounds like a financial crisis waiting to happen. But it doesn't because you can actually, like, if you envision something like zapper that can look into your wallet and tell you like everywhere that you're plugged into and all of the debt and all of the assets that you have across, like the main bellwethers or the crypto ecosystem. And you can like, see your net worth down to that second, like, exactly how much you own.
00:15:30.130 - 00:16:29.438, Speaker D: If you put that into like an institutional level of being able to plug into massive corporations and then the banks that have linked to those corporations, you start to build traceability on a level that you never could have with Tradfi. I mean, you could have, but you would need advanced AI to build those types of graphs. So that's what I mean by efficiency is like, you can like run algorithms with CDO's on blockchain that I think do make them like palatable for the average everyday person. So I do think that like the everyday person could use CDO's on chain where they probably never would have even touched them or knew what they were in MBS. But I also think that there will be a massive tradfi demand for this where you can go to like a company like JPMorgan and be like, we're tokenizing risk. This is what's in these risk tranches. You can see it here.
00:16:29.438 - 00:17:12.994, Speaker D: This is what it's pegged to. This is a company that linked to it. You can see this on chain, this is backed by X. And like, here's the insurance contracts, here's the Oracle, the price oracle that verifies this information. And I think at that point you're getting to a level that tradfi would look at something like this and be like, okay, I get it. I'm basically trading and out of risk, which is what I do every day, but I'm not doing it in this transparent of a way. And so that's where I say that I think that Barnbridge will bring Defi to Tradfi is because of the efficiency and transparency, not because we're doing something that you necessarily can't do otherwise.
00:17:14.734 - 00:17:18.834, Speaker B: That's interesting. And Troy, I'm curious if you have anything to add there too.
00:17:21.114 - 00:18:26.684, Speaker E: Well, I 100% agree with everything that Tyler is saying around the transparency of everything that's going on. I think where it gets really interesting, just in my own personal opinion, is around how you structure these products so that you can get tradfi into it. Where does the rubber meet the road from the tradfi experience? So like, what needs to happen to allow for them to get involved in this system? So are there other entities or are there third parties on top of these things? Or do we wrap them in like zero knowledge proofs to allow for, like, you can't take them down, anything like that. So I don't know, I just, I find like the mystery behind where all that goes is what's most interesting to me. Kind of like, I don't know. I don't know how you would go without it, though. Like how do you, how do you get them involved?
00:18:27.504 - 00:19:04.084, Speaker D: It's almost like what's, what's cool about Barmbridge is almost what's cool about Defi. Like, Barnbridge is a little bit like Defi squared. Like, we don't actually lend or borrow. We don't. We exist as a primitive that essentially allows you to trade into positions on top of these other primitives. Like, we couldn't have existed before, like Aave or a compound or a maker, a uniswap existed. So, like, I think what to me to tack onto what Troy was saying that interests him is not.
00:19:04.084 - 00:19:59.374, Speaker D: It's like, what can we build on top of Barnbridge? Like, once people see, like, how efficient, like, defi squared is, which is like, CDO squared, like, what could we have done with CDO's if there was transparency and they weren't, like, designed to fail? Or if we could see on chain that they were designed to fail because they weren't designed like, CDO's, weren't designed to be malicious products. They were designed in good purpose. They, they got out of control because of the lack of transparency. And it kind of stopped there because it became like a dirty word. And I think with Defi, the types of products and, like, structuring and, like, arbitrage opportunities and like, the coded, like, algorithmic, like, ability to track on chain and find, like, gaps in the market, it's really, it's exciting, is the easiest way to put it.
00:20:00.784 - 00:20:28.408, Speaker B: Yeah. And I really resonate with this vision to make these CDO's, or complex financial transactions and financial products clearer and more transparent and to bring it to kind of where it is today. Obviously, Pawnbridge will be launching with two products that people can use from day one of the launch. And this is a smart alpha product and also a smart yield product. So I'd love to kind of dive into these so that the listeners have a better idea of what they can expect when they actually use these products.
00:20:28.576 - 00:20:30.850, Speaker C: So let's start with smart alpha first.
00:20:30.992 - 00:20:33.674, Speaker B: So what is it and how does it work exactly?
00:20:37.374 - 00:21:50.282, Speaker D: So, sometimes it's easier to explain smart yield first, because I think that the market needs it more right now. But smart Alpha was actually, like, the original idea that I think stemmed Bondbridge. So, I mean, maybe it is better to start there because smart alpha was the, that was really my original idea of why I wanted to create this. And it had to do with this is actually a major component of, like, how will tradfi move into crypto at all? Not even just defi. I took the CDO concept and tried to apply it just generally to price fluctuations. And so the easiest way to, like, break this down is this really wouldn't work in trad five, because you would basically say, okay, if I could take 30% of the upside and downside in one tranche and 70% of the upside and downside in another tranche by putting half down. Right? Like, you got $100.
00:21:50.282 - 00:22:36.704, Speaker D: They're both broke into two. Why would the senior side ever take that bet, right? Like, why don't I just put $30 in and keep my $70? But the proof of liquidity aspect of it is what changes everything. The tokenized risk component is what changes everything of why there would even be a market for this. And that's what I really started thinking about was that the number one reason that Tradfi won't move into defi right now or won't even move in. We're not even at the level that tradfi is looking to move into defi. Tradfi won't even move into bitcoin or, or ethereum. And the reason is because the underlying volatility of those assets, right? Like, I mean, bitcoin's what, right now? Like, it's, it's.
00:22:36.704 - 00:22:39.588, Speaker D: Is it, like 15? It was like, it's at its highest.
00:22:39.636 - 00:22:42.624, Speaker E: Level since, I think, 20, 2018.
00:22:43.044 - 00:22:43.900, Speaker D: Yeah, it's.
00:22:43.972 - 00:22:44.324, Speaker E: Right.
00:22:44.404 - 00:23:15.394, Speaker D: It's doing a lot better. Crazy volatility. I've been a little bit slammed the last, like, 24 hours, but it's. It's gone up a lot and, like, east about to hit, like, 500. Honestly, I don't look at bitcoin's price as much as ETH, but, like, ETH is about to hit $500, right? Well, it was at $80, like, in April. Right? Like, that's a lot for a tradfi institution to bite off. So I saw, like, bellwethers in the industry, like, andrew keys, which he's, like, low profile, but he's like an Og of ETH.
00:23:15.394 - 00:23:55.180, Speaker D: Like, I mean, he's the guy that, like, got Microsoft to, like, start messing around with ETH at all, right? And I was also, like, I grabbed lunch a lot with Mark. You. I think, like, everybody knows what, like, Morgan Creek is and what they've done for bitcoin. He lives in the same town as me. So, like, I saw, like, andrew trying to sell Ethereum to, like, state street, and I saw, like, mark trying to sell bitcoin to, like, calpers. And I was like, these guys are both, like, smarter than me, better looking, charismatic. If they can't do this, I can't sell bitcoin or Ethereum to these institutions.
00:23:55.180 - 00:24:51.624, Speaker D: So I was like, well, I mean, how could we structure these things to make it palatable for them? And how could we put them into a structure using blockchain that would actually make them want to do it? And so I started thinking about CDO's, and I brought the CDO concept that has to do with. With yield. Like, we all know CDO's is bringing in yield. And I really tried to basically say, well, what if you could just tranche out the alpha risk? Like, what if you could just tranche out the price fluctuation risk? And that's where I got to that concept of, like, well, maybe they would just say, I'd put $3 or $30 down. But then I realized, like, no, but because you would have a proof of liquidity, you'd have. I was thinking about this even before proof of, like, before Joel Montenegro even wrote about proof of liquidity, and I was calling them risk ramps and risk tranches, because that was the only way that I really knew what to call them. And I was just thinking, if you could have a tokenized representation of risk, then you can put it back into the money Lego system.
00:24:51.624 - 00:25:29.426, Speaker D: And this is the even bigger part. It's only one trait. So, like, when I was sitting on a bunch of, like, synthetix gains just as pure synthetics, if I wanted to de risk my position and just launch into, like, a lower risk chain link position, that's only one trait. I can just move into a 30% tranche of chain link. And if you think about that, like, on a money manager perspective, their clients are asking them, like, hey, I'm really interested in this crypto stuff. Like, I really want to be, like, invested in this. If they're like, I, you know, I put $30 in and the 70 other dollars, like, I didn't do anything with, they're going to be like, well, give me that $70 back.
00:25:29.426 - 00:26:33.768, Speaker D: But if they're like, I traded in and out of these positions, of these risk positions, these tokenized risk positions, and I was able to protect your downside by, like, 30% on the downside when this thing dipped way more. And then I was able to also execute on the upside when it went back up. And, like, that fluctuation should have been a net loss or gain at x percent, but because I was using these products was a net gain of this percent, then you're actually, like, bringing in a level of trading that, again, like, you can't. You can't do that in tradfi. Not with the same amount of trades, like, not with the same amount of transactions, and not without, like, having to explain some things on the other side of, like, what are you doing with your cash position? Because these whole things represent a cash position as well, that you can go lend on aave that you can put back into the system. So that that's the smart alpha. I probably went like a little bit over in explaining that, but I think that to me is the most powerful part of Barnbridge.
00:26:33.768 - 00:26:37.564, Speaker D: The smart yield, I think is more needed in the short term.
00:26:37.864 - 00:27:21.724, Speaker A: And this 32nd intermission is brought to you by our sponsor, Nexo. Depending on what type of company you're operating, Nexo can help you in different ways.

You can even buy fractions of a share and manage your crypto and stock portfolio on one single exchange. I'm really excited about this as a user, and if you are too, sign up today for Bittrex Klobo using the link in the description.
00:28:25.654 - 00:28:41.314, Speaker B: So just so we can clarify how a user could use smart alpha. So you're basically tranching out the price risk or the volatility of certain assets. And people can use smart Alpha to invest in different crypto assets. Is that the correct way to characterize it?
00:28:42.174 - 00:28:45.034, Speaker E: Well, I think the question would be like, who is the user?
00:28:45.934 - 00:28:46.806, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:46.990 - 00:29:50.474, Speaker E: So if the user is an institutional investor or a large fund, they want to allow their clients to have access to the market without the high risk and without, but they're not going to get the high upside either. It's easy to explain in the stablecoins, which is why the smart yield is a lot easier to show how that will work. But if we have it with smart Alpha, you have tokens out there that have crazy volatility, and then they're allowed to get access to the token through their who's ever taking their money in. And they can then not get, they're not going to get the same upside, but they still get the same exposure, right, because they're not at risk for the same downside. So it really comes down to money managers and how that will work for them, because it's not easy to sell this system to the everyday stockbroker or who's ever out there who wants to get like at least some sort of exposure to the system.
00:29:51.134 - 00:31:03.290, Speaker D: I can give you just an example of how someone will use this. Just the other day, like, I tweeted out, like, an example of how I would use the smart alpha product. So, like, when DeFi was crashing, like, hard the other day, I basically was like, this is how I would use Barnbridge. In this scenario, if you can basically take SDFI or the DeFi index that token sets does with DeFi pulse, and you can put that into the smart alpha product on like a million dollar pool, and you can say, look, I want all these users to bet on one side or the other of DeFi. So like, let's, it doesn't have to be 70 30, it can be 90 ten. So maybe some users just want access to DeFi, but they're like, whoa, this thing's really tanking right now. And other people are like, I think it's going to turn around, right? So from a user interface perspective, you're just going to log into Barnbridge or another exchange that wants to use this like coinbase or a binance, or, I mean, like anybody in the money Lego system that exists as an interface that you can buy these things and you can basically say, I want to go really long s DeFi right now.
00:31:03.290 - 00:31:31.188, Speaker D: Meaning I'm going to put, for every $50 that I put down, I want 90% of the volatility. And there may be other people that are like, I want to take risk off the table right now. And I don't, I mean, I believe in Defi long term and I don't want to move to cash. So basically I just want to kind of sit in a position that I get a little bit. The upside, if I'm super wrong, I don't get hit as hard if it goes down. So I'll sit in a 10% sd five position. Right.
00:31:31.188 - 00:31:56.684, Speaker D: But that, the majority, I guess, difference between that is like it's two transactions to move 90% cash, 10% sd five. It's one transaction just to move into one of these tranches. So if you start to think about massive transactions of traders or even just like an average person that makes three or four trades a day, it does start to add up and how much more efficient this is.
00:31:57.824 - 00:32:19.502, Speaker B: So is it right to almost understand this as almost like a 0.5 x levered ETF where you have, you know, less exposure to beta, where you don't drop as much when prices go crazy when they start tanking, but you also don't get as much exposure, as much upside when the prices start to rally. Is that the kind of right framework to think about this?
00:32:19.638 - 00:33:10.380, Speaker D: Yep. But it's a, the major difference I think, is taking that component and the forex ETF on the other side of that 0.5 ETF, both of those new positions exist as their own asset that can be lent, borrowed and traded. Right. Like, so the difference between this and an ETF, the other, I guess differences is that it's not represented as a paper component that if it gets completely out of control, there's not another side ensuring it. Like a lot of those ETF's, like especially super levered ETF's. Like if you have a super levered bitcoin position, you need to know like damn well that other side is covered if bitcoin really flips tradfi.
00:33:10.380 - 00:33:14.864, Speaker D: The way you're talking about this is just algorithmically ensuring that the other side's coming.
00:33:15.964 - 00:33:35.634, Speaker B: That's really, that's really fascinating. And I think this actually bridges really well into the discussion about smart yield as well, which I'd love to get into. And this is actually the more interesting one to me personally, given that as a deFi user, this is something that I can see myself using today. So can you maybe explain how it differs from smart alpha exactly what it is and how does it work?
00:33:36.454 - 00:34:12.356, Speaker D: Yeah, and I guess one thing I should say that everyone should know is I think the really crazy thing about Barnbridge, where I talked about what could be built on top of it has to do with mezzanine tranches. We're just doing senior and junior. But where we can start to get really creative is the way that you code, like, the behavior of the mezzanine tranches. And this counts on both sides. So I just wanted to throw that in as an asterisk. But the smart yield, the way that you can think about that is we're structuring. A lot of people are doing fixed income in crypto.
00:34:12.356 - 00:34:51.856, Speaker D: They're trying to. They're trying to do it. I don't know if it really, like, actually exists anywhere yet, but most of that's on, like, the syndicate side or, like, the side that's actually, like, lending, like, an Aave. Right. What this is doing is it's just allowing you to pull in any yield and structure it in a way that you can ensure that one side gets a return no matter what. But in order to, like, the flip side of ensuring that, like, so you've got a 5% like, dai apy on Aave, right. Well, you can say, I'll insure 2% to the senior tranche.
00:34:51.856 - 00:35:27.704, Speaker D: Right. And they want that. Cause they're just like, all right, well, I want fixed. So that, I mean, there's a reason fixed income is, like, the most traded asset in the world. It helps with everything from, like, financial planning to a lot of other things. But in order to get that 2% coupon, they have to basically say, okay, but I give the upside up. Right? So the junior tranche, if you're basically looking at, like, dai at 5% on Aave, like, sometimes that gets up to, like, 90%, right? So if you have, like, yield farm that, you know is coming onto market, that's going to have massive demand for Dai.
00:35:27.704 - 00:36:04.334, Speaker D: Right now, you don't really have any way that you can trade that upside. I mean, right now, you don't even have a way to fix lock in the down the fixed rate, which I think that was going to come whether Barnbridge existed or not, but the ability to split it out and actually just bet on the mere fact that that APy could move in one direction or another, that is the difference between, like, Barnbridge and what the other fixed protocols are doing. And then when they make those fixed protocols, then we can pull that yield in and restructure it. But that's a whole other story. But a lot of people, I think, will make fix, whether we exist or not. What we're allowing you to do is just bet on the interest rate moving.
00:36:05.854 - 00:36:29.734, Speaker B: That's interesting. And just so we can understand what type of risk the user is actually taking on. So, you're basically depositing assets into a different floating rate markets, but you're guaranteeing that a specific tranche receives a certain rate, which means that if the floating rate is below that guarantee rate, someone has to take the loss. And I'm assuming that's coming out from the people who are invested in the junior tranche. Is that right?
00:36:29.894 - 00:37:16.302, Speaker D: That's right. And they actually will get locked for their percentage of what the fixed payout is. So, essentially, like, they won't have full lock on their whole asset, but a certain. Right, like, if you lend someone $1,000 on a 5% coupon, you're expecting, like, what? Like, dollar 50 back. So, if you say $2, you're only locking $2 of the thousand. So there will be some locking mechanism that ensures the senior rate. But if interest rates change in the other direction, the senior rate is giving that up in order to ensure that fixed rate.
00:37:16.302 - 00:37:27.794, Speaker D: So you're basically giving people the ability to bet on. Well, I mean, trade. Whether it's. I mean, betting, trading, hedging, it all means the same thing. It's just different markets.
00:37:29.544 - 00:38:10.496, Speaker B: Got it. So, it sounds like there will be two types of users for smart yield. So there's the type that's more conservative, and they want to earn a guaranteed fixed yield, and there's also the more risk loving type that would basically be able to earn more yield than they're entitled to with their own capital base but also be exposed to potentially negative yield, where they have to pay out to remunerate the senior tranches. So, my kind of question there is, given how risk loving we know the defi de gens are, I'm assuming most people will probably pile into the junior tranches of the debt to maximize the risk. Do you kind of foresee the same scenario happening, or what types of people do you see using the kind of senior tranche?
00:38:10.640 - 00:38:49.448, Speaker D: I think they're all the same people, and I think that they exist at a different day, at a different time on what bet they're trying to make. Like, it's almost like saying, like, do I only take futures bets on the Patriots because they won the Super bowl every year? Like, well, that changed once Tom Brady moved to the bucks. Like, so, like, sometimes I might want to take a completely different bet than the one that I took the day before. So, like, Troy can probably expand on this, as well. But, like, this SD five scenario that I just gave you where I say, all right, I want to ape into SD 590 percent because crypto dropped a lot. And I believe in DeFi long term. And I think this is like short term.
00:38:49.448 - 00:39:36.650, Speaker D: And I tweeted that like a week ago. And if I had made that bet, I would be massively in the money right now. Right now what I may say is, okay, well, now I actually just want to take my gains and lock in a fixed position so that I can have my mortgage paid for the next month. Right. So I just want to make sure that that happens and I'm going to go on vacation somewhere. There's all sorts of reasons that people move in and out of risk tranches and it could always be the same person that has different risk appetites in the same time. To say that, like DeFi always is like risk on, that's like extrapolating the whole market and just like not assuming that there are people within that market that that day or week or month, like, don't actually want to take a risk on position.
00:39:36.650 - 00:40:08.654, Speaker D: Like, I personally wanted to use Barnbridge and like, that's why I like pushed so hard to get it created and like even ask Kane to like steal the idea. But it was because I personally wanted to take other sides of like, what the market was doing that may be just locking in a fixed rate, that which is a lower risk thing to do. Sometimes I want to ape and go long and there's been times where I've been right in that and there's been times I've been wrong in that. But I definitely would use both sides of all of these things. And I'm a very risk on person.
00:40:09.034 - 00:40:38.600, Speaker E: I think one of the more interesting things that has occurred, like, in our conversations is that when we talk to institutional investors, they're always like, well, who's going to take the junior tranche, right? And we're like, okay, okay. And then when we talk to, like, djen traders, we're like, who wants to take the fixed tranche, right? And we're like, this is hilarious because like, you each both don't see that there's these two markets that are like prime to be exploited. Essentially. That might be the wrong thing.
00:40:38.632 - 00:40:40.364, Speaker D: Not exploited, but introduced.
00:40:41.464 - 00:40:45.428, Speaker E: It's there for the taking and no one knows it yet. And that's, that's the best part.
00:40:45.476 - 00:41:34.278, Speaker D: Exploited is honestly, no, I think it's a fair thing to say that. I think, like the listeners should know is like every single one of these trades has a winner and loser. Like you, someone will win and someone will lose. So like exploit if that's the way, like, you want to say it, but like, I will say that I have talked to tradfi investors that are interested in Defi and they're like, what kind of an idiot is going to hop into a junior tranche on this crazy defi shit? And I'm like, dude, you have no idea. And then I talk to deejay and they're like, who's going to take the senior side? And I think that's just a disconnect that they don't. I mean, if you're talking about a trustless, permissionless network that the other person doesn't need to meet the other side, or you don't need to rely on a third party institution like you do with a levered ETF or an under.
00:41:34.326 - 00:41:40.250, Speaker E: Levered ETF, and you know that it's all there. Like, it can't be not there on the other side because it's transparent, right?
00:41:40.322 - 00:42:04.854, Speaker D: Yep, exactly. So then, then I think that you're going to have a lot more people meet each other on, on a platform like this. Then I think the, there's a lot of people on one side that are going to think the other side stupid and there, and that's always going to be the case, or this thing doesn't work. But that's the way every market in the world works. They always think there's a, nobody does a transaction and thinks there's not a winner or loser.
00:42:06.104 - 00:42:40.416, Speaker B: That's really interesting. I think that's a great rationale about how Bondbridge could bridge Tradfi and Defi. I think it's interesting to note that the risk appetite of the Degens and DeFi is probably multiples of that of your typical trendfi user. So this is a really, really interesting project that I'm really excited for. And just to close this out here, my last question goes to both of you. Say we zoom out here and say three to five years. If Bondbridge is incredibly mature, it's reached a vision that both of you have set up for the project.
00:42:40.416 - 00:42:47.644, Speaker B: Where do you see it? Where do you see it being mostly used? Who are most of the people using it? And what's the scale that you guys are thinking of?
00:42:50.144 - 00:42:52.016, Speaker D: I mean, Troy may want to go first.
00:42:52.080 - 00:42:52.680, Speaker E: I'll go first.
00:42:52.752 - 00:42:54.280, Speaker D: I have some moon boy expectations.
00:42:54.312 - 00:43:20.516, Speaker E: Well, I have moon boy, too. So I would say that it becomes ubiquitous inside of any system. So there is no tradfi. There is no defi. It is just finance. The two worlds have met. I mean, we're talking like five years, right? And the two systems are pretty much meshed and that you don't even know the difference and that there are no.
00:43:20.540 - 00:43:21.544, Speaker D: More barriers.
00:43:23.964 - 00:43:58.664, Speaker E: For people to be able to get access to these type of markets. Right. You won't need to go and know the people that allow you to have access to this, where, like, my favorite saying is that we're selling Degen's greed to Wall street and God knows what they're selling it for, right? So these hurdles have all disappeared. And I could see it as just this global financial market that it tokenizes risk for every asset in the world. But that's like my moon boy love of everything.
00:43:58.744 - 00:44:49.156, Speaker D: So I have a couple of ways I could go with moon boy. Cause I do think, like, Barn Bridge is like, has the potential to be extremely, extremely powerful, primitive for Defi if it succeeds. But, like, the easiest thing, I think that, like, people separate from Barnbridge when they look at it at, like, the face level of, like, if you can just log into a platform that you can trade in and out of positions from, like, aave to maker to, like, a under leverage, like, chain link position versus an over leveraged chain link position, and you can just do that all on one platform. Like, that's, that's powerful in and of itself. And that's like, us. DJ's kind of talking to, like, how we would use it. But, like, when, I mean, I remember, like, on some of the first calls I had with Kane, I was being like, this has like, the potential to completely change finance forever.
00:44:49.156 - 00:45:37.110, Speaker D: He's like, you don't need to, like, go that crazy when you're, like, talking to people. But the reason that I think that, and I'll try to go fast because, like, I don't want to bore your users. But, like, basically the easiest way to think about it is, like, if you think about, like, something like, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they only give listings to, like, four banks in the whole world. Like, countrywide. Like, I don't even know what their names are anymore because they all went out of business. But, like, they had, like, specific parameters and specific, like, listings that they would then buy based on those, right? And then you, like, downstream have these, like, super high risk traders that will, like, buy in and out of things and they really, like, could never see the other side. Like, I don't, like, have access to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's, like, daily listings.
00:45:37.110 - 00:46:26.878, Speaker D: But if you, like, truly start to merge, like, tradfi and Defi, you can almost start to just run algorithms on being like, these are the types of assets that these money managers like, every single morning. And then it becomes like a game where it not only normalizes rates and risk across the defi ecosystem, but it does it across the world. You can put wheat futures contracts into the smart alpha and then go. Or let's then say, like, okay, well, like, wheat sold in France. And I also, like, then want to bet as a hedge against that on, like, real estate in France because, like, if wheat doesn't go up, then, like, the farmers can't essentially buy homes. And that's going to cause, like, or like, pay their rent. And that means real estate's going to go down.
00:46:26.878 - 00:47:04.044, Speaker D: So, like, you can start to, like, structure. Like the just crazy arbitrage and like, just crazy bets that you just can't do. Or you would be like, I mean, that might be a good bet, but, like, it's going to blow up if it works. I mean, like, AIG is going to happen, but this allows you to make these types of bets without even having to need to rely on that. Like, you just know the other side's there. Like, it's in the algorithm, right? Like, and that's what's exciting about Barn Bridge, is like, there will be pools that blow up and like, the junior will lose capital. But, like, it's basically structure where if you take the right side of the bet, you're getting a payout.
00:47:04.044 - 00:47:38.876, Speaker D: Like, in that scene of the big short when like that, the dude from the office that's the comedian is like thinking to sell at the very end. They're literally like, if you don't sell, you're not going to make a dime off of this. Right? Like with Barnbridge, you don't have to deal with that. Like, it's like, nah, I'm going to hold until that whole junior collapses and then I'm going to be right. Or I'm going to just hold and, like, sit in the junior tranche because I was so right. So, like, you don't have to rely on the other side. Like, you can basically transparently see, it's like having a bond desk to the all world assets.
00:47:38.876 - 00:47:50.704, Speaker D: Like, that's nuts. Like, you can't. It's, I mean, it's mind bending what you can do with it. But I mean, like, that's why I said, like, it gets moon boyish and it won't only be barn bridge, it'll be what gets built on top of it.
00:47:51.604 - 00:48:05.600, Speaker B: No, I do think that that is super compelling. And if there's a way that Tradfi is going to bridge to defi, it's going to be through products like this where you bridge two different types of risk appetite, and just as a closing, I suppose, is that why you guys.
00:48:05.632 - 00:48:07.288, Speaker C: Called it Barn Bridge in that it's.
00:48:07.336 - 00:48:08.520, Speaker B: Bridging two different worlds?
00:48:08.552 - 00:48:10.232, Speaker C: Or why is it called Barn Bridge?
00:48:10.328 - 00:48:12.124, Speaker E: I'm gonna let Tyler take this one.
00:48:12.504 - 00:48:53.200, Speaker D: This is like going to be the most, like, let down the most terrible part of this whole. So I wrote the white paper and named the company a year and a half ago, before yield farming was even, it existed. And I always said it was going to be a bridge between crypto and tradfi. So I think that's where the bridge came from. But the honest truth is, I was originally going to name it bank of humanity, and that was trademarked by fidelity or TD ameritrade. And then I did bank of civilization because I kind of knew the scope of what I wanted to have made even before, like, the defi run up. So, like.
00:48:53.200 - 00:49:14.392, Speaker D: But like, bank is so. I mean, I don't know, it's like a little bit, like obnoxious and then, like, also it's a lot of syllables. And the sad thing about it is, I was. I was watching, I think Troy sent me, like, beetlejuice. They have a bridge that's like a covered bridge in beetlejuice and it looks like a barn. And I was like, oh, that looks like a barn bridge. And I googled it to try to figure out what it was called.
00:49:14.392 - 00:49:35.660, Speaker D: It didn't have, like, any SEO, and I thought it kind of sounded like a trad five word. And we just lucked out on yield farming and barns and farmers. Like a year and a half later when we went to build it, we were like, okay, we're definitely going to keep barmbridge name. But it was like a. There was no. It was a. It was an arbitrary word.
00:49:35.732 - 00:49:54.044, Speaker B: Yeah, got it, got it. I love how serendipitous it is because with the yield farming craze, it definitely fits in. But once again, thank you so much for coming on the show, guys. This has been incredibly fun. And for people who want to learn more about Barnbridge or stay up to date with what both of you are working on, what are the best channels for them to do this?
00:49:54.584 - 00:50:16.824, Speaker D: I would say Discord is like the best because you can actually communicate with us. We try to be super active with the community, but if you're just looking for updates, follow us on medium and Twitter. Anything major that comes out, we're going to put on those. Honestly, medium, if you're a low content person, go to medium. If you're a high content person, go to Discord.
00:50:18.644 - 00:50:21.624, Speaker B: Awesome. Well, thank you very much for coming on the show, guys.
00:50:22.004 - 00:50:24.420, Speaker D: Yeah, honestly, this was fun. We enjoyed it.
00:50:24.492 - 00:50:25.124, Speaker E: Yeah, thanks a lot.
