00:00:06.998 - 00:00:08.714, Speaker A: And builders in crypto.
00:00:17.214 - 00:00:46.330, Speaker B: And before we get started, just a reminder for you guys out there. The Blockcrunch podcast is intended for informational purposes only. Neither the host nor its guests or licensed financial advisors, and nothing discussed should be construed as financial advice. Views held by Blockcrunch's guests are their own, and sponsorship messages do not constitute financial advice or endorsement. With that out of the way, let's jump right in. Now, before we get started with today's episode, I've got some great news for you. Now, a lot of you have been asking for how I analyze projects that I bring on the show.
00:00:46.330 - 00:01:32.120, Speaker B: That's why I decided to create blockchains VIP to share with you all the heavy research that goes on behind the scenes. Now, every week or so, our team puts prepares an in depth research memo with things like sector analysis, technical concepts made simple, in depth competitor breakdown, and even interactive models so you can learn about the most important projects before they become important. And our team is putting in hours every week scouring discord, twitter, forums and blogs to help you get an edge in crypto and understand the latest projects and themes at the deepest levels. That goes way beyond just an interview. Now, in addition, we'll also host exclusive AMA's with myself to answer any of your questions. So all of these are only available to blockchain's VIP subscribers. And the good news is that while our interviews will always be free, the VIP tier costs less than one coffee a day.
00:01:32.120 - 00:01:38.124, Speaker B: So head on over to theBlockcrunch.com VIP or click the link in the show notes below to sign up.
00:01:38.984 - 00:02:22.142, Speaker A: Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrench podcast. Now, it's a pretty dark time in crypto as we are recording this, you know, one of the biggest exchanges in crypto has just blown up. A lot of the large traders and funds that people idolize turns out to be frauds. And for seasoned djens even, this is a pretty hard time to be hopeful about the future of crypto. So that's why I thought it is a great time to do an episode like this because oftentimes in the darkest times in the market, I found it best to talk to those who have a very long term focus and tell us about what they are excited about in this space. And I thought there would be no people better to bring on the show than one of the most OG funds in crypto, which is blockchain capital. Now, just to give some context.
00:02:22.142 - 00:03:19.798, Speaker A: Blockchain Capital was founded in 2013 and they're an early investor in Ethereum, in Coinbase, Opensea, Aave and more. You know, any application you've used in the early days of crypto, they've probably had a hand in it. So nine years later, I'm really curious to see what they're still excited about with so many things already built out in crypto and what they're looking forward to beyond this bear market in a few years to come. So I'm very excited to have Kinzhul and yuan from blockchain Capital on the show today. And in this episode, we're going to discuss all the themes and projects that they're excited about, including things like account abstraction, dynamic nfts, data indexing layers, why roll ups will win over app chains, building in crypto versus building web two thoughts on aptos and sway, as well as web3, social like forecaster and lens. We're also going to talk a little bit about the modular blockchain thesis, fat protocol thesis and so on. So if any of these terms sound like neofango terms to you, it's because they're probably going to be the next big things to come in crypto.
00:03:19.798 - 00:03:27.554, Speaker A: So if you intend to stay in the space, this is an episode that you got to check out. So without further ado, really excited to have Kinjul and Yuan on the show.
00:03:27.854 - 00:03:29.274, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:03:30.014 - 00:03:36.194, Speaker A: Yeah. So, well, I guess just to kick us off, it's obviously a pretty historic week so far. How are you guys doing? How are you guys faring?
00:03:36.744 - 00:04:13.014, Speaker C: It's kind of, you kind of experience all the stages of grief is the best way to put it from my perspective. Definitely some, some disappointment and sadness for, for all the folks that were hurt in this process and, you know, a little bit of frustration for sure. But I know that, you know, our values remain the same in terms of why we're here and why we continue to build in crypto. And so taking the long term view is how we've approached it from a fund perspective and how we continue to approach it. This was really a failure of centralized systems and something that we're actively, you know, trying to fight against with decentralized systems.
00:04:14.314 - 00:04:16.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I hear you. What about you? How do you feel about this?
00:04:16.954 - 00:04:54.734, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm personally, you know, like, thankfully, I'm, I wasn't affected by a lot of my close friends and people I know and peers in the industry were. And so, like Kendall said, it's just a really sad time I was pretty shaken. You know, when the news came out, I think like a lot of people, it was just totally unexpected and kind of came out of the field. Definitely sets the industry back a couple of years and not great. But like I said, this is why we're all here. Right. This is a great reminder for us that decentralized systems are inherently more robust, and that's really where we want to go as an industry.
00:04:54.734 - 00:05:09.874, Speaker D: And FTX at the end of the day wasn't. It's a, it's a centralized service provider that just happens as service crypto, which is not really at all what, you know, we're here to build and kind of just. Yeah. Again, highlights sort of the failure.
00:05:11.734 - 00:05:12.022, Speaker A: The.
00:05:12.038 - 00:05:18.150, Speaker D: Fact that even centralized systems that we all trust and think are robust can fail us.
00:05:18.182 - 00:05:18.542, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:18.638 - 00:05:20.474, Speaker D: And we need decentralized systems.
00:05:21.054 - 00:05:37.674, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I definitely agree with Kim Joel's point about this being proof that we need these decentralized systems. And that's what I want this episode to be, to be a reminder of what we can look forward to now, to dive into the brighter side of things. Why don't you guys give us a little bit of background about what you do at blockchain capital. Kendra, why don't you start first?
00:05:38.774 - 00:06:12.156, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So I joined blockchain capital in 2018. Prior to that, was working in traditional finance, but found myself falling down the bitcoin rabbit hole. And that kind of led to the whole entire space and was just really intrigued. So I decided to move over to the investing side at BCap. I'm on the investment team, focused a little bit more on the consumer end of things. So consumer is a relatively new category, but we do a lot of work in the NFT and DAO space and specifically focus on infrastructure.
00:06:12.156 - 00:06:32.604, Speaker C: I think consumer infrastructure is really important and definitely highlighted by things like FTX where we need to make sure that we're providing safe onboarding for users and trying to reach the masses. That's primarily my focus area. However, I've definitely spent time in defi and infrastructure more broadly, seeing the full gamut in my time at BCap.
00:06:33.344 - 00:06:43.524, Speaker A: Yeah. And we're definitely going to dive into what consumer means because I think we haven't done a great job at covering consumer on this show before. So I'm really excited to learn about that. Yuan, what about you? What do you do at BCAP?
00:06:44.184 - 00:07:23.560, Speaker D: Sure. So I'm a little newer to blockchain tabl. I've been with the team now for about a year and call it eight months. I started out with blockchain capital, kind of as a part time intern while I was still a junior at the University of Pennsylvania, I was studying computer science and philosophy at the time and just hung around, really loved the team and thought it was kind of the perfect combination of my interests. It felt like the right way to enter the kind of the space. I've been tracking and following crypto since 2017, when I took a gap year and kind of first discovered it. And yeah, it just felt like the perfect way to get into space.
00:07:23.560 - 00:07:57.254, Speaker D: Was able to learn a lot about just different areas of crypto, everything from scaling to the Dao space to defi. I think when I initially started blockchain cap, I was particularly focused on daos and treasury management, got a little deeper into DeFi, and then since I joined about full time a year and two months ago, I've been much more focused on scaling and I guess the decentralized infrastructure side on things like bridging, privacy, tech scaling and stuff like that. More so than some of the DAO stuff and defi stuff I was focused on more early on.
00:07:57.874 - 00:08:19.084, Speaker A: Yeah, and I'd love to dive into those specifically now in terms of what's next on the horizon now on the consumer side. Kim Joel, it seems like a lot of the investments that blockchain cap has done before has mostly been in infrastructural or very kind of low layer primitives. So what is consumer? Is it something like Aave, or are we talking about something else?
00:08:20.184 - 00:09:09.596, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. I think a lot of different funds in the space probably define consumer differently. The way we think about it is a bent towards consumer infrastructure and specifically servicing the end user, but really providing infrastructure to make it easier to use applications in the space. You know, I think there will be a time where we're investing much more at the application application level, but I think we still have a ways to go, and I think 2021 was a great demonstration of. There's so much experimentation. We've got all this rapid iteration on daos, on NFT projects, on IP, and all these sort of models are being figured out in real time. Right now, though, we really want to focus on how do we get to the next level of onboarding users and making sure that this is all safe and intuitive to use.
00:09:09.596 - 00:09:15.824, Speaker C: I would say consumer infrastructure is probably a better way of positioning our investing thesis right now.
00:09:16.324 - 00:09:20.064, Speaker A: What are some examples of that? Is this like wallet infrastructure or.
00:09:20.524 - 00:10:06.564, Speaker C: Yeah, so I would say, you know, wallet infrastructure is definitely there. If I just kind of look across our portfolio, a couple of names that come to mind are things like upshot, for example, which is doing NFT pricing and appraisal, so really focused on how do we surface the best pricing data for nfTs. For example. Another example is a project called Workdao, which I'm happy to talk a little bit more about, but really solving the problems of Daos from a perspective of people and ops and compliance, which I think is probably the hardest challenges but the least sexy. And so people don't necessarily want to go after it. I think at the end of the day, though, that's really going to be important for enabling end users. Wallets fit into that, and then also gaming infrastructure.
00:10:06.564 - 00:10:14.404, Speaker C: So things like Stardust, which is an infraplay to allow developers to build games with NFT assets, things of that nature.
00:10:15.184 - 00:10:57.054, Speaker A: I think this is really interesting because I always thought that consumer investing is, in crypto to this point, actually harder than infrastructure, because for infrastructure there's so many kind of low hanging fruits. You want to create things that allow for scalability without giving up decentralization. You want to build projects that are very defined in this scalability trilemma. But then for consumers is a little bit more amorphous. It's really hard for me to predict, you know, what is going to be the next big thing. What will users or consumers or mom and pops actually care about? So when you look at these projects, how do you decide where to even start? Like, if someone comes and pitches you a blockchain based Airbnb or blockchain based Tinder, how do you decide whether these things have legs at all?
00:10:58.074 - 00:11:54.632, Speaker C: Yeah, I think at the earliest stage, it's still relatively straightforward when it comes down to, um, finding the right team and finding the right market opportunity. One thing that's unique about crypto is really sort of sequencing in, you know, to do like a user owned Airbnb or user owned ride sharing app. Do we even feel like at the end user is comfortable with a wallet today? Can they actually go on these platforms and engage in a way that feels scalable? And I'd say the answer most of the time is no. You know, I think we've also seen a lot of, like, hits that were, that went, rose up really fast and then unfortunately kind of detracted or retracted rather. So things like, you know, top shot, for example, where I had my friends hitting me up about top shot and they heard about it. It's this really cool thing, everyday, everyday consumers, but it wasn't necessarily sustainable. So I really do think that, you know, we can't really run until we learn how to walk.
00:11:54.632 - 00:12:33.164, Speaker C: Um, and so a lot of the consumer focus for, for us is on how do we get better UI like things like account abstraction, for example, which yuan can talk a little bit more about, I think will be really important to improving the UI and UX of wallets and of apps more broadly. Or how do we make it so developers feel comfortable onboarding in game assets to their games? Right. I think the gaming community has been notorious for being skeptical of nfts more broadly. And so how do we make that like a really easy process? That's really how we're thinking about the consumer problem. Space is like baby steps before we can actually get to that huge scaling.
00:12:33.864 - 00:12:56.014, Speaker A: So it's a bit earlier than I thought. Then it sounds like it's more investing in the infrastructure that enables consumer apps to be built rather than actual apps itself. I think you make a really great point about account abstraction, because, Ron, I know this is something that you are really excited about. Can you explain to us what is the account abstraction thesis or what is it? And kind of what are some projects that may be doing interesting work there?
00:12:56.674 - 00:13:34.488, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So I think this is an area that lots of members of the Ethereum community has actually thought to be very important for quite a long time. I guess before we get into why it's sort of more talked about recently, I think just talking about what it is would be perhaps helpful. And so I think for a lot of us crypto natives, when we use blockchains, the way we interact with chain is probably through metamask or something like it. You have an account that's controlled by a private key. That might be a twelve or 24 word phrase, but that's really just a private key. That key lets you do a bunch of things with your account.
00:13:34.488 - 00:14:07.032, Speaker D: It secures all the assets you keep within it, because it secures all the assets you keep in it. It also secures things like your identity, your right to future airdrops, your on chain reputation, your DJN score. There's a whole host of things because of the way you use this particular account, and that's just secured by this one private key. Right? But if we think about what this account is, it's fundamentally just an account. It's not programmable, it's just sitting there. It's controlled by this one private key. If you lose a private key, you're screwed.
00:14:07.032 - 00:14:30.394, Speaker D: You lose access to everything we just spoke about. Right. Whether that could be millions of dollars. It's your reputation. It's all your future airdrops so it's pretty devastating to lose your private key. And for users to even think about private keys, I think people generally forget how intimidating it is if you're not crypto native. Even if you're crypto native, you have to think about things like nonstreet use attacks.
00:14:30.394 - 00:15:03.076, Speaker D: Sort of look at what wintermute kind of did recently. I think the reason they got hacked was because of one of these things. You might tell your friend to go buy a ledger. They buy it on Amazon, and when they get it from Amazon, someone already kind of wrote down the private key and they input it, right? So, like, I think if you're not crypto native, and even if you are, there's so many ways for this to go wrong just because of how important private keys are. So I think, like, the future of wallets, as we think about it, you can't think of it as, hey, how do we make people understand how important private keys are?
00:15:03.100 - 00:15:03.404, Speaker C: Right?
00:15:03.484 - 00:15:36.524, Speaker D: How do we make them just be able to use private keys that we are able to script in natives? I think that's entirely the wrong approach. Right. I think, like, private keys are just fundamentally the problem with crypto onboarding. We need to find a way to just make private keys not as important. And I think account abstraction is, like, the best way to do this. You know, another way to do this would be, I mean, I think if you think about things like games, as they're onboarding users, they can use things like custodial wallet infrastructure where like, they just spin up a wallet for their users. The users don't know they're interacting with the blockchain.
00:15:36.524 - 00:15:51.066, Speaker D: They have a wallet and they've extracted away the private key. Right. The company that they're, you know, that they're, that developed the game has, you know, created the wallet. At the end of the day, the user doesn't need to worry about the private key. But that feels like the wrong way of doing this.
00:15:51.090 - 00:15:51.250, Speaker C: Right?
00:15:51.282 - 00:16:32.164, Speaker D: Because a lot of what makes crypto interesting is also self custody. You want users to understand that they are custodying their own assets. They have full control over it, you know, the data that they're giving up when they're using whatever app, they're deciding to sort of give up that data, right. That feels very important to crypto and kind of sovereignty and kind of the values that we care about. And so, like, account abstraction, in my view, is like the perfect way to kind of marry these two worlds where you can make users get the self custody, have sovereignty over their assets and data. But at the same time, they have good ux that they're used to. And the reason for this is account abstraction basically makes wallets programmable.
00:16:32.164 - 00:17:33.852, Speaker D: And so you can have things like key rotation, which I think is a very clear example of how this can play out. So with key rotation, you can sort of say, hey, if you can have a multisig that can't decide, that can't spend your assets, but what this multisig can do is if three out of nine of your friends and family sign, you know, like a signature, they can change the main signing key of the wallet. So in that case, if you lose your private key, you can change it by asking your friends and family to sort of change it for you. Similarly, you can also have multiple private keys there, right, that each have different permission levels. So one, you can have one that's like in a hardware wallet, you keep it a bank vault, and that key can do everything. You can also have, you know, the wallet be controlled by private key on your phone. But this phone private key can only do things like spend a day at, like a coffee shop shop, right? And so, like, you can have all these different levels of private keys that have different permissions to interact with your wallet.
00:17:33.852 - 00:17:57.330, Speaker D: And if you think about what that means, is that you can have this wallet, users can basically use it in all the ways they're used to using fintech apps while getting self custody. You can also have things like fraud monitoring, right? Like you can have the wallet provider run a service that blocks transactions on your behalf. They suspect something's fraudulent. Of course, you can override that if you want, just like with your credit card.
00:17:57.362 - 00:17:57.530, Speaker A: Right?
00:17:57.562 - 00:18:40.374, Speaker D: So all these sort of ux patterns that we're kind of used to in web two and fintech can now be reintroduced to crypto while keeping sort of the core elements of self custody. And what makes having your own wallet so great, right? And so I think in that sense, account abstraction is really great because it means every single wallet on Ethereum will have this kind of feature set. And so that's what account traction is. Sorry, this is a bit long winded, but the reason why I think people are so excited about today is there's been a new kind of proposal as to how we get to account traction, right? It's called ERC 4337. And essentially it means that we can get a counter traction without making any core protocol changes.
00:18:40.414 - 00:18:40.782, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:40.878 - 00:19:07.218, Speaker D: Usually when theorem is upgraded, client teams need to update their software, and that takes time. That's the whole EIP process. And, you know, it's a big reason why the moose Lily is everyone wants XYZ updates. The client teams only have so much time, but ERC 437 gets us, you know, most of what we want. A count traction without making the client teams do anything. Right. So it's a way to get a contraction without core protocol changes.
00:19:07.218 - 00:19:20.830, Speaker D: And there's a bunch of wallets coalescing around this kind of a standard to have account abstraction on basically any EVM equivalent chain. So yeah, that's pretty much counteraction smart contract wallets. And I think why we're excited about it.
00:19:20.942 - 00:19:30.554, Speaker A: And I'm curious, like how far away is this? Are we talking about a few years before these things are as popular as metamask? Or is it like a few months?
00:19:30.934 - 00:19:34.950, Speaker D: Well, I think the best example would be something like Argent, which has been around for quite a while.
00:19:34.982 - 00:19:35.342, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:35.438 - 00:20:07.138, Speaker D: I've used argent, Argent already had a lot of these user patterns. But the fundamental reason, I think, why Argent was not really able to succeed was because in the past couple of years, we've had the bull market. And when you use a smart contract wallet without account abstraction, you have a huge gas overhead. So every single transaction you make, you have to spend 21,000 additional gas. And when the gas price is something like 400 kw, that's like $30 to make a uniswap transaction. Right. In addition to the swap fee, which is probably like 200.
00:20:07.138 - 00:20:17.190, Speaker D: Um, and so if you're a normal user, that's very expensive for you. And so, like, you know, would you rather pay $40 more for every transaction or just use metamask?
00:20:17.222 - 00:20:17.414, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:17.454 - 00:21:00.104, Speaker D: I think when, when the calculus comes down to that, it's pretty simple. Um, but with something like ERC 4387 and like account abstraction in general, the reason why it makes smart contract wallets so much better is you remove that gas overhead, um, by a significant amount. With full account abstraction, it's gone. But kind of with something like 4337, you can reduce that gas overhead significantly. And my understanding is 437 is basically ready. So there are now a whole host of new kind of emerging wallets that are following this standard, and a lot of them are going to launch very soon. And I think also this gas overhead problem is significantly mitigated by rollups, which we didn't have before.
00:21:00.104 - 00:21:17.224, Speaker D: Now we have roll ups, we're on the cusp of sort of scaling solutions that will kind of ten x amount of users that can really interact with the chain at the same time. And when you have that and something like account abstraction together, I think the combo there is really when smart contract wallets can kind of really shine.
00:21:17.644 - 00:21:38.104, Speaker C: Yeah, I would just add that with argent, for example, they are working with L2s that have native account abstraction. So that's also been a part of their thesis. And something that wasn't really ready until very recently is they've got integrations with Zksync to be able to do native account abstraction. I think that's going to help with their adoption.
00:21:39.884 - 00:22:06.414, Speaker A: And I'd love to expand on that. So Kendra, you mentioned that account abstraction is one of the core developments that could unlock a lot of new use cases for consumer facing applications. Allow people to build things that you can't build before. Are there other categories or themes that you're looking for in the infrastructure layer that would also unlock more design space for people building consumer apps in crypto?
00:22:07.394 - 00:22:40.324, Speaker C: Yeah, I think another example that's really interesting is the concept of dynamic nfts. I think that's something that's been relatively underexplored and pretty new. And we saw this huge wave of nfts that were represented mostly by pfps and these sort of static images. But the reality is that nfts can be anything. And I think actually those are probably bigger markets. And just to explain. So a dynamic NFT is essentially sort of introduces programmability into the NFT.
00:22:40.324 - 00:23:38.940, Speaker C: So the metadata, for example, could be dynamic and change over time. There's probably a bunch of different applications in terms of, you know, maybe you get an NFT today and then in a year it looks like something else or it represents something else, or it's a contract, and that contract has an expiry date. If it's a financial contract, there could be all sorts of interesting elements that make it so nfts are not sort of this like static one time thing that probably enables use cases well outside of art. And I think that's something we're really excited about. It's just really difficult when the broader NFT community doesn't necessarily have standards that they're embracing. So, you know, there's been a lot of debate around, for example, IP models like CCO and compared to other models that have been debated. And I think there's going to be a similar standardization process when it comes to dynamic nfts or other standards that people want to be using, but we're not quite there yet.
00:23:38.940 - 00:23:42.144, Speaker C: But I think that's another category that could unlock a host of use cases.
00:23:42.524 - 00:24:03.704, Speaker A: And I'm assuming for these dynamic nfts you probably require some novel backends to be built as well. I'm guessing the storage layer is probably slightly different for static nfts and dynamic nfts. So I guess just broadly in order for us to have dynamic nfts, what are the types of companies that you like to invest in to kind of bring forth this dynamic NFT paradigm?
00:24:05.324 - 00:25:01.540, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think there's a couple of examples and, like, specific features that we probably want. So one is like the data layer. So, you know, to a certain extent, what's available, you know, in the metadata, we want to make sure that that data is being tracked and is able to be sort of, you know, categorize or index in a particular way that then reflects market data around pricing or market data around, like how rare is this trade or, you know, basically all of that, all of that sort of quantitative information. I think that's going to be really important. And then I think there's probably going to be specific infrastructure for each sort of like subsector. So just as an example, if you think about Uniswap and v three positions, v three positions could be represented as a dynamic NFT and really sort of show the sort of evolution of that position over time. And there's probably some infrastructure to be built around that use case.
00:25:01.540 - 00:25:17.424, Speaker C: And so we would be looking to talk to teams that have an idea or an application of a dynamic NFT that they think will improve the current state or really sort of enable a use case that people haven't been able to do today, and then they're sort of building the stack around it.
00:25:17.994 - 00:25:42.706, Speaker A: Got it. That's really interesting. The data layer. I think I know exactly which companies you're talking about because I've seen a few of those recently. But I'd love to go back to something that yuan, you mentioned earlier, you mentioned rollups, which is a massive theme right now. I think at the time we're talking right now, there's like four or five companies that are building roll up as a service type of projects. And this is coming at the same time when a lot of people are talking about app chains and cosmos as well.
00:25:42.706 - 00:26:03.894, Speaker A: So I'm curious. It seems like there is this trend for applications to build up their own infrastructure as well, either as app chains or maybe spin up their own roll ups. I'm curious about what are your general thoughts here? Like, is this app chain, app roll up thing going to be the way that people build apps? Do you have a preference for either of these? And feel free to take it anywhere you want with this.
00:26:04.234 - 00:27:01.444, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's a really great question. And I think the answer with a lot of things, it comes down to it depends, I think, because if you think about what an app chain or an app roll up is, you're sacrificing a few things to gain a few things. What are you sacrificing? Well, one, you're definitely sacrificing composability. You're moving to your own app chain or app roll up. And especially in cosmos with IBC, the level interoperability you get is really hot. In Ethereum, if you develop an app roll up right now, not quite the same level, but there are a lot of things that are going to change that. If you're in a fractal tree of ZK roll ups, for instance, slush will change that, which is an emerging research thing that lets different ZK roll ups talk to each other asynchronously, the same level as IBC does.
00:27:01.444 - 00:28:47.886, Speaker D: But what do you get? You gain things like sovereignty and fee capture, because now that you're your own chain, you get, not only do you earn the same kind of protocol fees that you used to earn before, you also get to capture mev and congestion fees. And we know that, especially if you're a DeFi application, where there is things like mev that can be very lucrative as an application, the value that you're able to capture now includes congestion fees and also mev that potentially makes your token and what you're building much more valuable. And so I think fundamentally, it's kind of this trade off between, hey, is an application, am I willing to sacrifice some composability for these other things that I'm gaining? But on top of that, I think for something like Dydx, you could argue it's more decentralized in the way you build application. Depending on what needs to go on chain, what needs to go off chain, there's potentially a good opportunity, especially using something like Cosmos ABCI sort of, to basically service out tenement consensus and play with it. You can make things that are ordinarily off chain part of consensus and just structure it in a way that's more decentralized and lets you basically, from a regulatory standpoint, also just show yourself. I think there are a number of factors that makes applications might want to become kind of either an app roll up or an app change. I think longer term, we're the opinion that app roll ups are going to win out over app chains, but I think as a category, just applications choosing to become more sovereign in that way.
00:28:47.886 - 00:29:07.234, Speaker D: I think it's something that we haven't seen the end of. I totally see it happening more and more, just because if you think about the incentives that are there, a lot of them make sense. Once an application gets large enough, from a lot of perspectives, they're able to make more money. Why wouldn't they? Right?
00:29:09.174 - 00:29:22.914, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And kindred. Anything to add on that side? When you're talking to consumer applications, do you see a strong preference from founders to build as app chain or roll up? Or maybe they don't want to worry about any of that, they just want to build on Solana or Ethereum directly.
00:29:24.694 - 00:30:20.612, Speaker C: Yeah, it's going to be really interesting debate. I can see the case for both. So on one hand, I think a lot of projects in the ecosystem have been unfortunately sort of bound by the roadmaps of Ethereum or by the roadmap of Solana. And that is that it can hinder their product experience and how they are ultimately trying to reach their end user. And so I could see a case for having sovereignty and having control and really being able to capture most of the value as the right business choice. I think from a business perspective, that could make a lot of sense and also just being able to have more control. But on the same sort of vein, that you can make an argument that having to deal with all the trade offs as it comes to having your own chain and the infrastructure and the costs and upkeep is very expensive, and you want to just focus on your app, whatever it is that you're trying to build and deliver.
00:30:20.612 - 00:31:12.364, Speaker C: So, um, I can definitely argue both sides. I think we'll probably start to see certain use cases where it makes more sense to do an app chain versus not. And like one particular example, I think I'm, I've been thinking a lot about is gaming, and whether it really makes sense for gaming to have like a shared state on like an ETH layer one, or whether they should just go and do their own app chain. And particularly given like the use cases, their security sort of requirements, and the fact that those are like very high, high velocity environments where we're having thousands of transactions and hopefully millions of users, potentially that makes more sense. So I think it's going to be very specific to the type of application, and we'll probably start to see a little bit of a battle emerge between the two models, and hopefully we'll figure out soon what works.
00:31:12.714 - 00:31:57.814, Speaker A: That's actually a question that I've been trying to answer myself, because on one hand, I think when we talk to developers, cypherpunks a lot of investors as well. They are really excited about infrastructure and diversity of infrastructure, allowing developers to build up any flavor of any layer one or roll up that they possibly want. Then I talk to seasoned web two entrepreneurs who are trying to come in and build products. They don't really want to learn about any of that. They don't even want to know what a roll up is. They just want to build an application. So how do you reconcile the two? Do you think maybe the infrastructure layer needs to abstract away so much that the builders don't really have to decide? Or do the application builders, when they come into crypto, must they necessarily learn about all these different flavors before they can start building things?
00:31:59.354 - 00:32:34.004, Speaker C: So I can share my take and then Johan, I'd like to hear your take as well. My perspective is that everyone that comes in thinking we're going to build with a web two web 2.5 mindset quickly realizes that we're not ready for that yet. To really understand the full experience, you have to get into the weeds. And I think we'll get there. But similar to how the first 1015 years of web development, we didn't have no code solutions, and everybody is really eager to jump to the no code era of blockchains. And I just don't think we're there.
00:32:34.004 - 00:33:17.868, Speaker C: So I think if you're not ready to get into the nitty gritty, you probably need to sort of evaluate your strategy. Now, that being said, at the end of the day, like, the infrastructure doesn't matter if we don't have applications building on top of it. Right? What is the infrastructure for? At the end of the day, we need people building apps and we need things to work. And so I definitely think there's a middle ground that we need to reach. And we want to encourage people to feel like they can come into the space and they don't have to spend, you know, ten months or a year onboarding and ramping up in terms of their knowledge. So I really do think it's important to make it as easy as possible. But at the same time, like, shortcuts are really dangerous at the stage of where we are.
00:33:17.868 - 00:33:28.184, Speaker C: And so I really want to, like, caution folks from, from, you know, potentially thinking that there's a, there's a really easy shortcut here. I don't think there is. And I think we've kind of seen that in the past year.
00:33:29.764 - 00:33:46.408, Speaker D: Um, you know, totally agree with what Kendall said, but I also think we're kind of at an interesting time now. Right. Because a lot of this infrastructure, Jason, that you mentioned and that I'm also excited about. Like a lot of that wasn't ready until like the last, call it seven, eight months.
00:33:46.456 - 00:33:47.044, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:47.864 - 00:34:25.484, Speaker D: And then now with kind of. I mean, you know, ZK sync is about a launch polygon. Zkevm is on the horizon. Scrolls also on the horizon you have all these different kind of. Well, you also have all the layer ones, but with all these different pieces of infrastructure launching, you have many more teams that I think are willing to help these developers from web two pick the right solutions and even help them with a lot of development. We've seen Starknet or Starkware pioneer this early on. I think they basically built DyDX's Stockx instance entirely themselves.
00:34:25.484 - 00:34:55.857, Speaker D: I think that's going to be a model we're going to see a fair bit of early on as more and more web two devs come into the space. And I think a lot of that's going to be driven by the amount of money that's flown into these scaling solutions. I think pretty much every single one of these UK roll ups have gigantic war chests. Polygon obviously already has a gigantic war chest and a lot of them are using that to send their BD teams out there to talk to these web two developers and sort of evangelize kind of the solutions they're building.
00:34:55.905 - 00:34:56.185, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:56.249 - 00:35:32.834, Speaker D: I think that's a good thing. Right. At that day, like you mentioned, a lot of these web two developers don't really want to understand a lot of this lower level stuff. And I think early on we're going to have a lot of people helping them to navigate the space. And sure a lot of these teams will be biased, but at the end of the day, I think if they're onboarded onto things like ZK Rollups, I think I might be a bit biased here. I think ZK Rollups are probably the right solution this year. I think if that's what they're using and these teams can teach them and help guide them along, I think the worries that you mentioned can be alleviated.
00:35:33.374 - 00:36:28.804, Speaker A: I think that's a really interesting viewpoint because I think the general feedback from people who are trying to build in starkware or maybe trying to looking into things like aztec, these different flavors of ZK roll ups is that the barrier to entry for builders is so high. You're going to learn this new language called Cairo. You're going to learn noir for aztec to build, whereas for things like Solana, you can build with rust and then with the newer chains, aptos and sway. I think they're really advertising this aspect of move language being a really great language. This is slightly a weird pivot, but I noticed that blockchain capital didn't invest in either aptos this way. But almost every other single venture firm has invested in one or both of these. So I'm curious, maybe if you don't want to speak specifically about them generally, what do you think about the layer one vertical right now? Is there still a space for a new incumbent to become dominant, or has the chessboard pretty much been set?
00:36:30.024 - 00:37:25.950, Speaker D: Well, I think I can give my views. I'm sure King also has some. But I think, in my opinion, I think it's shared by a lot of people on our team as well. If you look at what makes Athos in sui interesting, a lot of it comes down to the moviem. If you're creating a new virtual machine, why are you creating a new trust network to allow this to flourish? You're building this new chain with no ecosystem, with no security. Why don't you deploy that as a roll up instead? That lets you innovate on the thing you actually want to innovate on, which is the virtual machine while inheriting the security of the chain like Ethereum. That feels like the right way to go, right? Like a layer one like Celestia is also interesting because it kind of flips this paradigm that we've seen where you have this monolithic blockchain on its head, where it allows people to innovate on other layers of the stack, but benefit from kind of existing infrastructure that's already been built.
00:37:25.950 - 00:38:16.250, Speaker D: Right. So I think in our view, we're far more excited about kind of the modularization of blockchains into things like, you have data availability layers, you have settlement layers, you have execution roll ups, you have fractal roll ups, kind of this whole new world that's sort of enabled by some of these advances that we've only really seen in the last couple of years. That feels like the right way for the industry to go forward, right? Because you can have your roll up, you can modify the execution environment, you can tweak it from the EVM to something else. You can create a new virtual machine that suits the application you want to build. You can do all these things without compromising on security, decentralization, and everything we care about. But launching a new layer, one where you have to bootstrap a lot of this from the start and from the very beginning, it just feels like a lot of extra work for no real reason. When you can get a lot of what you want by building a roll up instead.
00:38:16.250 - 00:38:18.454, Speaker D: So that's at least my personal view.
00:38:21.594 - 00:39:22.622, Speaker C: Yeah, I would, I mean, I would agree, I would agree with you on this is something that we talk about a lot internally. And so it's definitely sort of our worldview. I think the only other piece I would add is I have a lot of scar tissue from the 2018 cycle and all the l one s that came out, out of that and spending a lot of time on it. So I'm never going to say never, but I just feel very strongly that as the network effects of existing L1's continue to grow and we have a very clear path for scaling while still experimenting and innovating up the stack on the things again that yuan mentioned, where you really do want to be innovating, like bootstrapping a trust network is not something that's easy. Bootstrapping a network in general is not something that's easy. And I think that's definitely been demonstrated by the Solana journey to date. And I think it's commendable the work they've done, but it's just so difficult.
00:39:22.622 - 00:39:39.464, Speaker C: We're not talking about something that goes from zero to 100 in a year. We're talking about like a five year plus journey. And so I think we're just really careful when we, when we evaluate new layer ones, because it's not the same thing as launching an application. It's, it's a whole different equation.
00:39:40.044 - 00:39:43.012, Speaker A: And I guess this is where the painful incentive problem.
00:39:43.068 - 00:39:43.284, Speaker D: Right.
00:39:43.324 - 00:40:12.384, Speaker A: I think for people who are, who want to build certain new features or aspects that could be built on top of ethereum, their incentive is actually to create their own l one and then just raise a shit ton amount of money for that l one because it's much harder probably to raise for something perceived to be a smaller feature than selling this dream of a massive l one ecosystem. So do you think that can never be solved? How do you attract developers to build, say, the moviem on Ethereum as a roll up versus building an entire l one?
00:40:13.764 - 00:40:48.318, Speaker D: Well, I think to start, we haven't really seen rollups launch tokens yet. And I think fundamentally, a lot of these builders, they see the valuations that some of these l one s that Kim Joel mentioned from the last cycle have gotten. And I think that directs a lot of incentives. But I think over the next couple of years is optimism now has a token, I think. Well, I don't know, but I suspect arbitrum is going to have one soon. Starknet will probably have one soon. Things like zksync, um, scroll, polygon.
00:40:48.318 - 00:41:29.606, Speaker D: I think it's conceivable a lot of these roll ups will have tokens soon. Right. And I think once some, some of these roll ups start having tokens and we see how they perform after they get some traction and everything, a lot of these people who would develop new l ones hopefully will see that. Hey, actually, you know, developing an l two gets us a lot of this sort of, uh, gets us basically what we want, while also making it less work for us and allows us to innovate in the place that we do. Right. So I think it's not just a function of kind of. Yeah, I think, like you said, there's this incentive problem and we just haven't had incentives from roll ups just yet.
00:41:29.606 - 00:41:37.434, Speaker D: And I'm very optimistic that we'll see those kind of play out over the next couple of years that might flip kind of this sort of cycle on its head.
00:41:38.134 - 00:42:06.204, Speaker A: I think that kind of leads to the bigger question about fat protocols. Right, which is this thesis that's been touted since 2017 about how the lower in the layer of the stack that you are, the more value you capture. So for Kinsel, since you focus a lot of time on, I guess, the higher stacks of the layer, and in terms of the application layer or the consumer layer, do you agree with that? Or, you know, or do you think maybe the top quartile bets for crypto venture in the next ten years, are they going to be still layer ones or are there going to be maybe consumer applications?
00:42:08.224 - 00:43:23.368, Speaker C: Yeah, so maybe I'll take the first part of that question that I'll get back to the top consumer bets versus layer one. So I think there's been this sort of debate in the consumer, you know, the crypto consumer world of should you do app first and then bootstrap your protocol later? Or should you start with your protocol and then attract developers to build social on top of it? You know, I think maybe a good example of this is like lens versus Farcaster. I think at the end of the day, they're both still trying to bootstrap like a very large social ecosystem, but they're going about it in two different ways, where Farcaster has, like their, their Twitter, like Apple, and then lens is going out and attracting developers with grants to build on top of it. My personal view is I think the application layer has not gotten the love and attention that it needs in crypto. And so I would love to see a sustainable app sort of have a home run. And I think that that's ultimately going to be the signal to the market of, hey, developers, come and build over here. It's very similar to, like, the iPhone, right? The iPhone was a huge hit, and then developers were like, okay, I want to launch an app on the App Store because this is like the platform that has distribution.
00:43:23.368 - 00:44:22.994, Speaker C: And so I think, like, it's a similar idea when it comes to consumer apps for crypto. And that's probably still really early, but I don't want to sort of, I don't have the answer in terms of, like, the protocols are still going to be really valuable. And that's a lot of the value prop that, like, consumer social is touting is, you know, being able to take a protocol that has all this sort of like, open data and, you know, use it in a bunch of different ways and figure out what is the most attractive or what is the most, you know, beneficial. Like, that's the beauty of what we're doing here is we don't have closed APIs and we don't have closed data graphs. So personally, I think application first is going to be really important for how consumer kind of grows over time. But I definitely don't want to discredit, like, the role that the protocol layer will play. I guess in terms of the fat protocol thesis, I think we're starting to see it sort of play out where protocols are incentivized, of course, to grow their ecosystem, have all these applications built on them.
00:44:22.994 - 00:45:03.312, Speaker C: What happens when the first big application that is generating more economic value than the protocol occurs? I don't know. I think it could happen. I really do think it could happen, but I don't know. Like, how does that switch the incentives of the protocol, which is effectively behaving like a platform? Right? Do they want to then compete at the application layer? I think that's going to be like an open question that crypto needs to sort of face because up until now it's been, we're just going to do the protocol and, you know, developers, please go out and build all these great applications. I think the second that that application becomes more economically valuable, if that's even possible, that's when we can have a different sort of equation I think we're already seeing. So, yeah, those are some considerations.
00:45:03.408 - 00:45:41.954, Speaker A: We're kind of seeing that at the very top layer of the stack, not quite at the layer one yet, but we just had an interview with Stepn, for instance. I think most of the volumes on the Solana exchange orca came from Stepn. And they decided to basically say, screw it, screw you guys, we're going to cut you out and create our own Dex to capture all the value. So it makes sense that maybe that argument should extend even lower in this stack to layer one as well, which I think would be really interesting to see. Now, there's so much more that we could dissect here, but in the interest of time, I love to just kind of close out on what is one, say, category or one project that you guys are extremely excited about that listeners should be checking out?
00:45:42.374 - 00:46:22.404, Speaker C: Yeah, I can start. I mentioned this earlier, but I think workdao is really interesting. They are effectively a way for daos and web3 companies to employ their contributors in a very legal, compliant way. Again, maybe not the sexiest category, but absolutely critical. And they're just, they're doing an amazing, incredible job and making people feel like they can contribute to web3 and not have to worry about, you know, how does, how do I even go and pay my rent now if I'm just getting paid in tokens? Like that is a really big problem that's affecting people globally and they're, and they're solving that. And so I'm really excited about what workdao is doing.
00:46:23.184 - 00:46:31.084, Speaker A: Yeah, we definitely include that link to work down below. I actually have never heard of work down, so I'm really excited to check this out. Yeah. What about you?
00:46:32.104 - 00:47:03.258, Speaker D: I think. I'll think it's probably zksync, I think. Jason, you also mentioned something earlier how a lot of the existing ZK roll up solutions, they're really difficult to work with. If your developer with Stockware, Stockman Cairo is super difficult, with Aztec, Noir is super difficult. Zksync just launched their baby Alpha mainnet. It's not open to users yet, but as a developer, you can go deploy on the main net. Unlike some of these other ZK solutions that are live today, they're actually fully EVM compatible.
00:47:03.258 - 00:47:39.702, Speaker D: It's a developer, you can deploy your application with minimal to no changes. Existing developers can just port the applications over super simply. And that's not something we've seen before in the ZK landscape. I think also it's also just a very future proof solution. They have things like native account abstraction. So if you're a developer and you want to build things with really great ux, it's a really great place to be able to do that because this fresh ecosystem that's ready for mainstream adoption, it's super scalable and you have the tools that let you build a lot of these very, these applications that prioritize UX.
00:47:39.758 - 00:47:40.190, Speaker C: Right.
00:47:40.302 - 00:48:13.418, Speaker D: Then finally, I'd also say the way Zksync's built, again, it uses an LVM compiler which future proofs it because in the future they can build things like Rust and C front ends and you can write applications in Rust and C two and at the same time inherit libraries written in some of these modern languages just all around. It's a solution that lets developers transition over super simply and easily today, but it's also very future proof and you know, it just sets a great foundation for evolve, continuing to evolve into the future.
00:48:13.466 - 00:48:13.842, Speaker C: Right.
00:48:13.938 - 00:48:20.602, Speaker D: So yeah, I think that's, that's, that's another project that we're very excited about and I'll probably leave you with that.
00:48:20.778 - 00:48:39.092, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. I'll include that in the show notes below as well. Well guys, thank you so much for doing this. I think this is much needed positivity in a time when it's pretty dark in crypto. And now we finally seems like there's a lot of things to look forward to. So I guess SPF has his, you know, in his downtime, he has his cocaine. I have this podcast to keep me excited.
