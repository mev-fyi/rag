00:00:14.889 - 00:00:17.505, Speaker B: Web3 offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:17.545 - 00:00:19.337, Speaker C: Our job is to buy great tech at great prices.
00:00:19.401 - 00:00:21.873, Speaker D: AI is also libertarian Right enable a.
00:00:21.889 - 00:01:06.499, Speaker C: Use case that people haven't been able to do today. The next hundreds of millions of players they will come to the market through mobile. My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next 12 months is blockwrench is not a licensed financial advisor and is purely for informational and entertainment purposes only. All opinions are personal and the show may discuss assets that the host or guests have positions in or may be actively buying or selling. All investments carry risk, so consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions welcome to another episode of blockcrunch. I'm your host Jason Choi, co founder of Tangent, a prop investing vehicle in crypto. Now for our roundtable session where we discuss the latest VC trends and thesis in crypto, I'm excited to be joined by my co host once again, Sanat Kapoor from Dragonfly Capital.
00:01:06.499 - 00:01:57.089, Speaker C: Now in the last roundtable we Talked about why VCs like to focus on infra and not applications in crypto and why we want to see more applications. So in this episode we're going to talk about the infra side of things. What is exactly the end game for backing a bazillion L1s and L2s and whether any L1s or L2s can actually challenge the incumbents like Ethereum and Solana. And to add more credibility to this, I brought on a mutual portfolio founder of ours, Shuyao. Just to make it fair, Shuyao is the co founder of Real Time Blockchain Mega Eth. So we're going to talk about technical, social and the financial implications of building the blockchain to rule them all. Now, to give a little bit of context, I came across mega eth about 6 months ago and they were on an ambitious mission to get a chain that can produce 100,000 transactions per second, which is more than what Visa today processes and leaks above what any blockchain is capable of doing.
00:01:57.089 - 00:03:06.097, Speaker C: Now to do this, they've also assembled the Avengers equivalent of a co founding team, with Yilong Li, who is a PhD at Stanford working on consensus, Lei Yang, who is a PhD at MIT working at networks and Shuyao, who was the Global head of business development at ConsenSys for seven years. After getting an MBA from Harvard. Now, most interestingly, they're pursuing centralized block production where they have one full node producing blocks, but decentralized verification by having a large network of lighter weight nodes safeguard the work of that node. Now that's an oversimplification. I will attach more of the technical docs in the notes below for those who are interested, but it's a surprisingly controversial and extremely technical and nuanced trade off with implications on both the technical and social side, which we'll touch on now at the end. I'll also touch on some tactics for scaling your developer or token communities and also force us to set aside our back biases to make everyone talk about what the other chains that they think are doing a good job and and I even put my co host Sanat on the spot by asking him why his fund invested in two of the Next Gen blockchains, Monad and Mega Eth, who recently had a somewhat heated debate between their co founders and another podcast as well. So this will be a very fun one as usual.
00:03:06.097 - 00:03:08.105, Speaker C: So without further ado, let's get started.
00:03:08.185 - 00:03:09.313, Speaker A: Pleasure to be here.
00:03:09.409 - 00:04:13.127, Speaker C: Very, very excited to have you on show. So you've done a few podcasts recently, but I think this one will be the most kind of broad in terms of like covering the high level of why we even need L1s or L2s and kind of the approach to creating winning ones. And I'm going to name this episode the Most Expensive Question in Crypto because I think this one question explains how most VC capital flows, right? We recently saw a pre product L1 called Story Protocol raised at like $3 billion valuation and people still act surprised that these are being done. But Sanad and I actually discussed in the last episode why VCs in Crypto Fund so much more infrared than apps and the TLDR is the reward for nailing the next Solana or the next Ethereum is so big, right? Ethereum is 280 billion, Solana 60 billion. So when the reward is so big, people naturally gravitate towards them. So that's why I think the most important question really in crypto for a lot of investors is will there be a Nick Solana or Ethereum type of outcome? So in other words, why do we still need more infra? You know, what's the end game for infra? So Xiao, given you're building the next big infra, I'm curious what your take.
00:04:13.151 - 00:05:08.075, Speaker A: Is on this first yeah, so my first reaction was we should add Tron on that list as well I think there are a bunch of protocol that has product, market, fit eth, Bitcoin, Tron, Solana. So from our perspective, obviously we love infra the way that's different from VC's Love Infra. I think they are the foundation layer of why we're being here. But I'd love to answer your question from the word endgame perspective. We actually as a team never thought about we're building any sort of endgame. We believe that if we're in the industry, you're always pushing toward the frontier, there's always going to be a blockchain that's much faster, performant, more decentralized, et cetera. However, we've started talking about ourselves as endgame blockchain very much thanks to Vitalik.
00:05:08.075 - 00:05:51.603, Speaker A: So apparently in his 2021 blog post which is entitled Endgame he the end game of a scalable blockchain is one where you have relatively centralized block production and very decentralized and trustless block validating network. And that's exactly what mega eth is. So maybe selfishly, to answer your question, we believe that we are building some sort of end game for blockchain within the near future time limit. But we also really genuinely believe that everyone should advance in the better direction of building better base layer. Because if we can't get better base layer, we can't really build better dapps.
00:05:51.699 - 00:06:24.662, Speaker C: Before I get started, I'm grateful for aptos for sponsoring the show and letting us continue to make this free content for all. So here's Jerome from aptos to tell us a little bit more. Jerome aptos is gaining traction of entities interested in bridging traditional finance with DeFi. Some notable developments are Ondo finances integration of Aptos, which brings institutional grade finance on chain and ecosystem project. Aptos Labs becoming a strategic investor in Securitize, which is an RWA platform offering tokenized fund investments. So can you explain why Aptos is such an attractive network for onboarding Web2 financial markets and services?
00:06:24.732 - 00:07:29.195, Speaker D: So Aptos is the world's fastest most reliable interoperable layer 1 blockchain, making it the fastest, most accessible payment real in the world. For quick Context, Visa processes 1600 transactions per second. Aptos supports 30,000 transactions per second. That's 18 times faster than Visa and fills instantaneously users. For this reason, aptos isn't just a blockchain fit to bring rwas on chain, it is the blockchain for bridging the threadfi defi gap. In addition to Ondo and Securitized developments, aptos Labs, in collaboration with Brevin, Howard, bcg, SK Telecom and Microsoft, announced Aptos Ascent, a suite of blockchain based tools and features on the aptos blockchain designed to meet the requirements of financial institutions while at the same time leveraging the openness, scalability, security, speed and reliability of the public Aptos network. Aptos Ascent will provide a Web three path for any major bank or financial institution in the world to begin offering digital asset and asset management services to the client's responsibility and at scale, it represents a massive step forward in bridging the gap between TRADFI and DEFI innovation with the industry's key stakeholders.
00:07:29.195 - 00:07:45.075, Speaker D: This opportunity to bridge the institutional web3 gap in the name of open finance is huge. It's global and it's playing out at Apples thanks to the speed with our low time to finality, our reliability, 99.99% uptime and cost efficiency with 100 times lower guest fees than other prominent L1s.
00:07:45.155 - 00:08:03.043, Speaker C: Thanks Jerome. Now back to the episode. When you say better base layer, does it mean like faster or is it kind of more different features or you know, maybe supports more type of coding languages? What are the metrics that you think in terms of, okay, if this is the end game blockchain, these are the things that we need that the current blockchains don't have.
00:08:03.219 - 00:08:32.538, Speaker A: Yeah, I think definitely faster latency is something we really, really care about and we believe that has been neglected by a lot of founders. You know, if we can reduce the latency to Web2 level, we can really enable a lot better user experiences. We think security is an interesting metric as well. Even with tokenomics. Right. There are so many facades in what a good blockchain is. I think most people just reduce blockchain into performance, into throughput.
00:08:32.538 - 00:09:00.550, Speaker A: And throughput by itself is a measurement of capacity, not capability. And more importantly, throughput is a measurement of utilization. So people often say like, oh why do we need more block space? Like you know, look at Solana, it hasn't really hit the tps like you know, what are these infra projects? But that isn't, that doesn't mean like we don't need more chain. It just means like most of the current applications are not utilizing the chain the way we should be.
00:09:00.662 - 00:09:23.295, Speaker C: I'm curious, like for Sana, from an investor's perspective, you look at a lot of L1s and L2s as well. What are you actually looking for when you want to back the next L1? Like what are you thinking of? Hey, Solana has like I don't know, 10,000 transactions per second. Right now we need, like, to hit 100,000. Is there like a metric that you try to see if certain L1s hit or what kind of, you know, what makes you decide to write a check to, hey, I'm going to back this new L1.
00:09:23.415 - 00:10:02.489, Speaker B: It's a good question. I won't mention any specific metrics because metrics get gamed very, very fast. There's like tps and then people found a way to kind of game tps and then we kind of went to gas per second, and even that gets gamed. I think as an investor, it's incumbent upon you to understand, like, what performance really means and what kind of performance people are looking for. You know, people will throw around terms like parallel, and then you have to think about, okay, what happens when a certain, like. Like there is one NFT that everyone wants to mint and you can't parallelize it and how blockchains respond to situations like that. And so I think the infrastructure conversation is nuanced enough that I can't tell you, like, oh, if you had XTPs, we would write you a check.
00:10:02.489 - 00:10:41.875, Speaker B: That's just not how it works anymore. I think a couple of things. One is broadly, though, I think it's not so hard to make the bet that 10 years in the future people will want cheaper and faster secure block space. Now, there's many different ways to interpret that, but that's actually one of the easier bets to make in crypto. Like, for example, other things you could be betting that NFTs will matter in 10 years. And that's actually kind of risky right now because NFTs don't seem to matter right now, but at a high level, saying, yeah, I think people will want cheaper and faster block space to do whatever they want to do on a blockchain. Seems like a pretty easy, not risky bet to make in its own way.
00:10:41.875 - 00:11:13.969, Speaker B: I think the thing we're thinking about, though, is that, like, strategically positioning towards app developers is becoming more and more important. And so, you know, when you start, you have Ethereum, and Ethereum can kind of be a home for everything because it's the first place where there are smart contracts. And then Solana is like, okay, actually, we're way cheaper and way more performant. And so it's like this. The space of strategic things you can do as a blockchain now is like, it requires more unique positioning. It requires a very differentiated pitch to app developers. And that can be different things.
00:11:13.969 - 00:12:00.477, Speaker B: You can have vibes based Pitches that actually take off Blast is effectively a vibe space pitch that did pretty well. They were like, yeah, we gamble here and a bunch of people came and built gambling apps there and it kind of worked for a while. I'm obviously biased. I think Mega Eats pitch being more performant than almost any other blockchain that we can imagine right now and pushing kind of the roll up trade off spectrum to its edge is one that should appeal to developers. But yeah, I think you have to work backwards, look at what developers want and kind of. I do think it is true that the kind of strategic positioning is becoming harder and harder for every blockchain that gets launched these days. Given that Solana and Ethereum have kind of occupied a lot of the space.
00:12:00.501 - 00:12:35.621, Speaker A: In the narrative room, I would just add one thing. I think we. Yeah, it's really competitive. Honestly, like as a blockchain founder you have to have a differentiated technology. You have rents, you have really good swags. I often joke that Mega is the fashion company and we put so much time and effort in our swags and it's actually becoming competitive advantage at some point. But joke aside, I think the other thing that a lot of people overlook is the surrounding infrastructure with the blockchain.
00:12:35.621 - 00:13:09.665, Speaker A: I came from consensus my entire crypto career was Wallet, rpc, data indexing, et cetera. I think a lot of blockchains don't really put much attention on these middlewares. As a result their application developers are not just getting a good dev experiences and as a result then the end user not using the chain effectively. If I think about what Solana has done really well, I think the iteration of Wallet on Solana has downloaded magic. People overlook on that quite a lot.
00:13:09.785 - 00:13:35.569, Speaker B: I guess actually on that front I'm curious how you think about differentiation inasmuch as one of the reasons that people really like launching clone EVM blockchains or blockchains that look very similar to other blockchains. That is actually really easy. Some indexer will be like, okay, well we index this other get folk. We can index your get folk as well. It's not so complicated. Metamask will work out of the box. And so there's a weird trade off where if you want to actually start from scratch, it makes your job much harder.
00:13:35.569 - 00:14:00.097, Speaker B: Where like I imagine at the performance scale you guys are running at, indexing is hard. It's much harder than it is to index like a normal EVM chain. So I'm curious how you guys think about those trade offs and in particular Solana took a while Like Solana Indexers and Solana Block Explorers. Solana Block Explorers still kind of suck if I'm being honest. And so I'm curious as you guys do so much of this stuff from scratch, how you kind of bootstrap that infra ecosystem or how you think about trade offs with compatibility.
00:14:00.281 - 00:14:55.487, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean dude, no pain, no gain, right? If you get your block space very easily forking someone else or just, you know, rat it out, then you don't get moat, you don't get loyalty at all. You, I mean you do get easier infrastructure but if no one uses it, then yeah, it doesn't make sense. Even when I was working on Infura, you know, Infura only supports a few chains and it's always a very strategic decision because every chain you support you're putting a lot of work beforehand. If you don't get developer activities, then it's pretty much a wasteful resources. So even for non differentiated blockchain, getting these middlewares can be difficult. You have to either pay or you have to like, I don't know, raw dog yourself into that company and really love you. But yeah, and your second question on us.
00:14:55.487 - 00:15:38.201, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, RPC data indexing will be extremely difficult. We have to work with people who believe in us from scratch. But more importantly, we are working with our DAPP ecosystem directly. If we just work with an independent data indexer without looping in our DAPP builders, we never know whether this new data indexer actually works well with for example, our spot. Dax, I was literally just on a call with founder of rabi. We're talking about, you know, wallet support and the most important thing again is data indexing. So I need to work with him to make sure that whatever he stands up to integrate with Mega Ether actually works.
00:15:38.201 - 00:15:48.329, Speaker A: So it's a lot of dirty work to be honest. You have to really think it through before you just like launch a chain and inshallah, hoping it works. It doesn't.
00:15:48.457 - 00:16:24.213, Speaker C: People underestimate the difficulty of doing a very fast chain. They think, they think, okay, we're just going to make bigger blocks and you know, slightly more centralized block production and then everything will be fast, but all the piping needs to be reworked just because of the, of the speed. I remember when Solana first came out the indexing was so hard that I think developers were having a lot of issues on the testnet. I'm just trying out apps. This is during the serum days as well. But before I move on to kind of the technical trade offs that people have to make to get this type of performance. I like to just quickly close out on the end game point because I think Sanat, you mentioned that TPS is very easily game.
00:16:24.213 - 00:17:38.509, Speaker C: But in my mind, in my 100 IQ type of framework, I always use TPS as like the kind of benchmark because when I think of Visa, right, visa has like 65,000 transactions per second and then something like Solana I believe is like 2 to 3,000. I could be wrong on this, but you can see that even some of the fastest chains in crypto are quite far away from like Web2 Infrastructure. So when I first spoke with the Mega ETH team and they mentioned that, hey, we're going to do this construction to reach 100,000 transactions per second, that's a type of scale that I have in my mind when I think of web 3 eventually reaching web 2 parity. So to me that's the end game getting very, very fast transaction per second and very fast throughput. But obviously the big catch here is how is that possible? I like to go into the technical side, which is what are the main trade offs that L1s and L2s can make to increase their throughput? Because obviously we, a lot of us know about the scalability trilemma that Vitalik wrote about. And to put it very simplistically, in most cases, when you want to make a faster chain, you need to make things a little bit more centralized. But I think for Mega E, you guys are doing something quite interesting with this concept of like node specialization and kind of challenging.
00:17:38.509 - 00:17:54.603, Speaker C: What does it mean by actually a centralized chain? How do we measure decentralization? So do you want to touch on that a bit? And I know there's also a recent debate with the founder of Monad on another podcast about kind of what a full node actually means. So we can get into all that in a bit.
00:17:54.699 - 00:18:47.945, Speaker A: So in terms of the layer 1, layer 2 trade off to get performance, it's actually pretty straightforward. As layer one, a layer one is forced to make the trade off between performance and decentralization, period. If a layer one wants to get performance, the only way to do is either jack up their hardware, which means they automatically becomes really centralized, or they might improve their software for a little bit, but that doesn't give them the performance increase that they desire. So L1 is forced to make such trade off. And that's why a good layer one should always optimize on decentralization, because we believe it's harder part to get. So now what is the trade off Layer two because everything is in trade off. The L2 trade off is a non performance because you can jack up your hardware like what Megaist does, centralize and optimize to get performance.
00:18:47.945 - 00:19:25.549, Speaker A: But because you are using a base layer, a layer one as your decentralization, AKA security and censorship, resistance guarantee, you still gather decentralized benefits. But what you are losing is finality. So the common critique trade off for L2 has always been yo dude, you have to wait for seven days for you to settle back on. Yeah, the challenge period. Or you can say oh you know, wait until ZK proves that you have instant finality. To us, you know what we are performance maxis. Our stronghold is on the execution environment.
00:19:25.549 - 00:20:00.325, Speaker A: We are not proof experts. We believe that someone will figure out a ZK way to have instant finality onto layer one. It's going to happen. We're optimistic, but we rely we're going to use someone else who does it better. Our job is to make the performance as extreme as possible. So that would be my answer on the layer 1 and layer 2 trade off. Now going off that why does Mega ETH can be so performance optimized? So yeah, after understanding the layer 1, layer 2 performance trade off, I can go a bit deeper into node specialization.
00:20:00.325 - 00:20:38.935, Speaker A: By the way, for those of you who are listening, my co founder and CTO Lei does this fantastic YouTube videos that explain technical concepts. You guys should all check it out. He explained way better than I do. So what is no specialization? If we go back to what layer one does, right? Layer one is actually a very homogeneous network, which means that every layer one knows does exactly the same thing. Imagine having a thousand laptop that runs the same math problem all over the world. What does it mean? You get a lot of duplication. It would be really nice if you have one laptop that does the work and the rest just copy.
00:20:38.935 - 00:21:33.673, Speaker A: That's what node specialization is. When you have a lot of redundancy, all your node has to wait for the slowest one to complete a task in order to move on to the next task. That's why layer one can never be scalable because all the nodes do the same thing. Now going into Mega east and roll up, we can actually take the layer one task, the layer one nodes and configure them into special hardware and software. So for example, what Mega ECR is, we concentrate the heavy lifting of execution into one beefy centralized server. So this server just like churning out blocks all the time really fast, 100,000 tps, millisecond latency. But then in the meantime, to compensate for the performance coming from the centralized sequencer, we have very decentralized validating network.
00:21:33.673 - 00:21:45.161, Speaker A: So you have node that specialize in producing blocks and node specialized in validating blocks. So that's why we're the most performant blockchain.
00:21:45.353 - 00:22:02.129, Speaker C: So I guess just to double click on that. Right. I think the best way that at least for me to think about decentralization is what sort of risks are you opening up yourself to as you veer more to decentralized part? So let's say like to borrow someone drops a missile on that server room and blows it up, then what happens to Mega Eth?
00:22:02.297 - 00:22:35.371, Speaker A: Yeah, so or someone you know, there's a bad actor on our centralized sequencer. So you would still have escape hatch, a force exit going back to layer one. So that's one way, say like L2, derive security from layer one. Because there's always this path going back to the base layer that is completely decentralized. Right. I think a second way, a second improvement we're working on is actually rotational sequencer. So we are not fan of decentralized sequencer because we are performance maxi.
00:22:35.371 - 00:22:57.145, Speaker A: The moment you have decentralized sequencer, you are sacrificing performance. However, a rotational sequencer is very different. So you would still have multiple sequencers, but at any moment you have one that execute transaction. So if a bomb that hits one, you just rotate to another one that still does the job without sacrificing performance.
00:22:58.005 - 00:23:22.865, Speaker C: And Sana, I think as a VC, you probably see a lot of different L2s that have explored at least similar constructions. I know there's a lot of discussion for like the big L2s around decentralized the sequencer or not decentralizing the sequencer. So how would you categorize Mega Eth in terms of the trade offs it's making among other L2s or L1s that you've seen? And have you seen any other changes doing this approach before?
00:23:23.025 - 00:24:04.185, Speaker B: Honestly, not really. The only two teams that I know that are working that kind of came at this from different angles are Eclipse and Mega Eth. Broadly, I think one of the things we noticed is that of course Arbitrum and Optimism was super successful because they were kind of the first chains that proved that hey, we can actually make a much faster, cheaper evm. And then we kind of realized one, it isn't that much faster or that much cheaper, but it's cool. It still enables new use cases. Unfortunately, Most of the L2s that launched after that and I'VE spoken about this previously. Kind of feel boring.
00:24:04.185 - 00:24:47.157, Speaker B: Like the block space is uninteresting, particularly relative to arbitrary optimism. And from a user perspective, they don't feel that different. Like, it is just true that if you're using linear or scroll, it doesn't feel like magical in any way. And I think neither from the app developer's perspective nor from the user's perspective. And one of the things is that obviously ZK tech is cooler than optimistic tech in some ways, but it's hard to feel for either a user or an app developer. And so I think actually, like, one of the reasons we're really excited about Mega 8 is that it pushes the frontiers of what an L2 can be. And I think optimism and arbitrary more like a good first attempt at showing what L2s are possible.
00:24:47.157 - 00:25:01.101, Speaker B: And then we have to kind of push forward. And a lot of people try to kind of just recreate the mold of optimism and arbitrary. And we still see pictures like that. And I think most of those pitches are pretty uninteresting, unfortunately. So that's maybe one way that I've seen a lot of L2 pitches go down.
00:25:01.173 - 00:25:11.213, Speaker C: I want to double click on this point on the full notice. Well, I know this is apparently a very, very sensitive topic for crypto since the beginning of Ethereum, let's say, but okay, just, just so we can.
00:25:11.269 - 00:25:15.805, Speaker B: It's sensitive from the beginning of Bitcoin, just to be clear. Like the Bitcoin maxis have fought about.
00:25:15.845 - 00:25:59.183, Speaker C: Full nodes as well, so 2008, so there's no way we're going to resolve this thing on this, you know, one hour podcast. But just to give some context, I think by and large the kind of retail or a mainstream consensus of what a full node is is basically you have blockchains and you have a bunch of nodes that are heavy duty notes, right? They verify every single transaction on a blockchain. They keep a full history of every transaction or of the state, right? So these are like full backup copies of your device. So for Ethereum, according to, I think ethernodes.org not all of the full nodes are, you know, publicly queryable. But I think according to Ether nodes, there's like 6,000. Solana has like 4,400 according to Solana Compass, Bitcoin has almost 20,000 according to Bit Notes.
00:25:59.183 - 00:26:17.639, Speaker C: So in Mega east terms, does that mean Mega Eth has like one like full node, but then a bunch of other nodes that are, you know, don't fit into the conventional definition of full node, but you achieve Kind of decentralization by having those nodes kind of check the work of that full node. Is that kind of the right intuition for it?
00:26:17.687 - 00:27:04.295, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think that's what Senet meant by where the most interesting experience experimentation. For layer 2, we completely decoupled execution environment from the layer 2 full node. That allows us to concentrate heavy lifting into the sequencer and then for the rest of the full node we make them extremely light so they can like anyone can run them. Right. You can actually run it on your phone. So our full node by definition is very different explanation from others because we did this decoupling. But I think, you know, I think that debate made us, got us really got us to reflect quite a lot.
00:27:04.295 - 00:27:46.107, Speaker A: I do think, you know, on the one hand we can say we use a different definition, but on the other hand it just completely reflects our design philosophy is we don't believe that a node has to execute all the transactions even with our validating node. It's so light because not all the validating node is actually validating each transaction. They're only validating a subset of all the transactions. So we're doing all the optimization to make sure that the chain is performant without sacrificing the decentralization. So I think it's on the one hand it's a definitional difference, but it's really a design principle difference sense.
00:27:46.251 - 00:28:21.937, Speaker C: Yeah. And I'm curious like why no other chain. I know you kind of mentioned this on another podcast as well, but why no other chain has explored this trade off? Is there some kind of like gaping risk that that is that, that that you get if you just have like one centralized block production that all these altos are just not willing to take? Or is it just like such a high bar in terms of like the technical optimization you need and you know, all the indexing things that Isana mentioned that is required before you can get this chain to work, that there's a very high barrier to entry, that not everyone can build this. Why has no one else explored the same trade off that you guys are exploring when they're trying to build these fast blockchains?
00:28:22.081 - 00:29:11.905, Speaker A: I mean, I would say it's my co founders, but they told me not to mention them because they're humble devs. I think the honest answer is the design is very unorthodox. Everyone was going after consensus, everyone has different fancy DK proof. No one actually thought about going after the execution environment. Even Vitalik wrote about it. So I think we are the one who actually, because of Elon and my co founder's background, it becomes very intuitive for them to explore this area and they also have the engineering talent to actually implement the solution. So one thing I want to continue to emphasize is you ask is RSP coming from no specialization.
00:29:11.905 - 00:29:47.769, Speaker A: I said yes or no. Yes, because we do have decentralized beefy sequencer, but that's really a fraction of it. We've done so much software optimization on top of the sequencer that makes it a step function improvement. It's not just slightly better, this is a rocketry better. You know, one of our mega Mafia builder told me today, it's not linear improvement, it's rocketry. So. And a lot of these software improvements, extremely difficult.
00:29:47.769 - 00:30:17.265, Speaker A: Jason, like we reroll the entire state try like, you know, we realized that Merkelization is 99% of the performance bottleneck. We're just like, screw that, we're going to rewrite the whole thing. We're using JIT compiling, you know, we are doing our own parallelization. We're not using block STM or anyone else that's out there in the open source world. So it's both a hot wire, it's both a architectural design choice as well as a software optimization.
00:30:18.045 - 00:31:15.025, Speaker C: This kind of reminds me of like solana back in 18 as well. I know I almost reference this every episode just because I really index a lot of things to kind of the Solana story because it's one of the big kind of stories of victory in crypto, right from from startup to like major blockchain. And I remember back in 2018 when they put out the paper a proof of history about kind of paralyzing and optimizing for, you know, you optimizing for speed using hardware. A lot of people were asking the same question, like, how come no one has done this? And the answer was really as simple as because Anatoly, the founder was a hardware guy for like 10, 20 years, right? It, it's actually a lot harder to build these chains and kind of tackle the low level technical problems if you don't have like 10, 20 years under your belt in that specific domain. And Shaw, you mentioned that your co founder is very humble, but they came from that background as well. So I think that's a very convincing answer. But I'd love to kind of pivot a little bit and put the spotlight on Sadat as well because I think the two big.
00:31:15.025 - 00:31:44.471, Speaker C: I don't think you guys call yourself Solana killers, but the market is kind of discussing you guys in the context of like chains that could compete with Solana in terms of the speed and scale and the ambition. The two big ones that I hear the most are Mega Eth and Monad. So Dragonfly, you guys invested in both of them. So Sanat, can you explain to us, okay, what are the differences between these two things? Like what are the trade offs they're making? Are they both trying to go for the same thing? But what kind of trade offs are they making here in order to achieve that?
00:31:44.663 - 00:32:26.707, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I guess I should just start by saying Monad investment predates my joining Dragonfly and so I'm less familiar with it. Obviously. I, I know our thinking around it. It's kind of hard for me to answer because Shuya actually did a very eloquent job explaining the trade off space that L1 stake and L2 stake. And I think broadly those two approaches lead to pretty different kind of outcomes for users for security trade offs, for the way you're thinking about what matters, they lead to a different profile for assets on the chain. Like I said, I think broadly, one, I don't wake up in the morning and think there'll be one blockchain in 10 years. I don't think that.
00:32:26.707 - 00:33:15.999, Speaker B: And so we've invested in other blockchains as well, and we think that are like, interesting, like exploring interesting. Like I think maybe the way to put it is we generally like founders who are willing to explore interesting points in the trade off spectrum and we find founders who are kind of just sticking to the same points, kind of pouring and I think in their own way, both of these chains, like Monad is trying to push what a highly performant EVM L1 could look like. And Mega Eth is basically saying, okay, what if we just pushed like we used the L2 trade off spectrum, like relinquish the job of verification largely to the L1 and then push performance to its absolute maximum. And so I don't know if that answers. I'm actually struggling to answer because Shuya actually just did explain, explain what L1 versus L2s are. And that was kind of what I would kind of respond with.
00:33:16.087 - 00:33:41.005, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I think that's, I want to touch on that because one of the Monad's main pitches is that it's going to be the most performant EVM compatible layer one. And I think it's interesting that Mega Eth, also, one of the things that you guys emphasize is being aligned with Ethereum as well. So help us understand this kind of social layer. What is the difference between EVM compatible Ethereum alignment and Ethereum foundation alignment. Like why are these things important?
00:33:41.345 - 00:34:21.299, Speaker A: These things are not important. Like I genuinely do nothing, but I want to explain why I don't think they're important. I think EVM compatibility is, you know, it's a standard again. I used to run wallets, right? Like no one cares whether you're at layer one, L2 whatsoever, as long as they can use it on Metamask and most of them are EVM compatible. So to me it's just like a design choice, a base layer. And then the question about Ethereum foundation, I think the foundation just does what's good for the chain, the ecosystem, the asset. What do I need to do with it? I'm not certain.
00:34:21.299 - 00:34:38.495, Speaker A: I love to contribute whenever we have more technical findings, but so far it's like I don't consider that as part of my success metric. I think the last one to align with the Ethereum ethos is probably the most important one to my heart.
00:34:38.835 - 00:34:42.883, Speaker C: What is the Ethereum ethos? Actually in the context of L2s, I.
00:34:42.899 - 00:35:19.221, Speaker A: Would say let me retrace and talk a bit about my personal experience. And I think that represents what our team really believes in. So most of our team coming from countries that actually need blockchain, like we come from countries that you know, get currency depreciation, censorship, et cetera. Our team actually believe in decentralized technology. Surprise. Like, you know, we love Token, but we believe in decentralized tech stack. So Ethereum to us is simply the most decentralized and censorship resistant layer one.
00:35:19.221 - 00:36:14.677, Speaker A: Like people ask, often ask us like, oh, can you guys not be Ethereum layer 2? But we were just like, we face it, we can't, we're centralized sequencer, we need a decentralized base layer. We can't, we can't abandon Ethereum. Plus we love the Ethereum ethos and community which is, you know, really building antifragile technology for majority of the world. So we are aligned with Ethereum in terms of that and our company mission honestly is in fact to build decentralized technology, empower people to build decentralized application for the world digital economy. And we truly believe that. So does it have to be manifested with the Ethereum social layer? I don't think so. But I genuinely think we're the most Ethereum aligned protocol out there because we're the only one that has to use Ethereum's decentralization to be who we are.
00:36:14.861 - 00:37:08.933, Speaker C: And I would actually challenge the view that EVM compatibility is not important just from a commercial perspective. It seems like EVM is probably the greatest export of Ethereum in that once you are EVM compatible, you know, you can tap into the huge user base that Metamask has, at least relative to all the other Ethereum wallets. But at the same time the obviously Solana was the big exception to this, right? Like people were quite dismissive of Solana in the beginning because it didn't try to be EVM compatible, it didn't Try to use MetaMask, they needed their own wallets. The first wallet was like solid from FTX and it was absolute dog shit before Phantom came around. But they still managed to win. So I'm curious, like Katsana, you mentioned that being EVM compatible and kind of forking EVM chains is a very fast way to get to market for L1 founders. Why do you think people were wrong about Solana when they look at Solana and said that, hey, it's not EVM compatible, it's going to be beat out by avalanche.
00:37:09.069 - 00:38:01.097, Speaker B: It's tricky because I think the answer is definitely overdetermined. Like one could say, okay, if you're going to have a different ecosystem, you need someone to help you bootstrap. They had FTX and they had multicoin that like pushed very hard to make developers build stuff like this. I think developers may be willing to explore new trade off spaces when there's like a huge performance gain to be had. But I do think it's like, it's very path dependent. I think Solana kind of had access to a special crop of developers, had kind of a lot of support from an ecosystem, had a lot of people willing to fund developers making a lot of experiments and failing, which is kind of the way these things get bootstrapped. Maybe one way to contrast it is with the MOVE ecosystem where actually if you talk to developers who are writing in move, they will tell you MOVE is actually an excellent way to write smart contracts.
00:38:01.097 - 00:38:27.625, Speaker B: It is really secure, people are really excited and maybe these things just move on slower times frames. But unfortunately over the past few years MOVE hasn't managed to get that adoption. It's hard for me to answer why. There are some devs, they have got funding, there's no FTX behind them. The user experiences that were created were not super unique. And the truth is that the user experiences that were created on Solana at first were unique. Like at that time no one could run anything resembling serum on any other blockchain.
00:38:27.625 - 00:39:09.865, Speaker B: And so it was pretty cool that someone built an order book that ran on a Blockchain eventually most trading on Solana happened on amms, which is funny, but I think there's a time, there's a place, there's like differentiation. Today if you try to launch a totally new blockchain with a totally new programming language, I think you would struggle unless there were very, very clear trade offs that kind of helped. And some of these trade offs are also long term. One of the trade offs around MOVE is that it's more secure and security is one of those things that is like a nice to have but no one is like, like you can't feel it. You can't feel it every day until things get hacked. And so I, I struggle to give you like one answer. I really think like this.
00:39:09.865 - 00:39:28.387, Speaker B: The story of Solana has Anatoli involved, has FTX involved, has investors kind of packing it, has kind of Phantom being a default wallet, has apps like Pump Fun and Meme Coins trading there. Like, which one is the reason that people managed to write programs for in a different language is very hard to.
00:39:28.411 - 00:40:08.175, Speaker C: Answer since we're on the question of searching for the nixpec L1s. Obviously a big trend. I wouldn't say it's a trend, but a big kind of point of interest for investors and maybe some developers alike. Were aptos and SUI right when the MOVE kind of language was positioned as this new way to get to developers outside of crypto. So as L1 Co founder Shreya, obviously you guys are not building with MOVE now, but I'm assuming you guys have kind of thought about that angle. What are your thoughts on the MOVE blockchains? Is that a good wedge to get developers and is that something that was ever part of the conversation when you guys were deciding, okay, what kind of languages should we support for Mega Eth?
00:40:08.255 - 00:41:00.143, Speaker A: Yeah, we're a big fan of move actually. I think we pioneered a bunch of parallelization, security and all of that. To us it was quite out of the question because obviously, I mean, you mentioned that EVM does have a lot of market share and just like developer education. But more importantly, I don't think changing a language matters that much to develop a developer onboarding. So my answer to like, you know, why I think MOVE language did not take off was, you know, the initial batch of application on MOVE just weren't that interesting. Right. They were not utilizing the MOVE language to have like direct user benefits.
00:41:00.143 - 00:41:37.137, Speaker A: Like, you don't feel using Move is that a MOVE is different from like on a fast like Ethereum layer too. So I think that's what they miss Whereas on Solana, Solana Pioneer use cases that you just can't find it anywhere. Right. They were the first one to talk about Deepin. And by the way, most of the Solana Deep ins don't even use Solana. They can't because that chain doesn't allow real time computation, by the way we do. So I think the major difference is if you can't have a differentiated application on your chain, no matter how good the language is, how secure the language, it does not matter.
00:41:37.137 - 00:41:51.985, Speaker A: So, I mean, as a blockchain founder, to me is I offer the language that's most familiar to the users and I make sure that I work with founders who are actually pushing to zero to one. Pushing the zero to one use cases.
00:41:52.805 - 00:42:25.431, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think we're moving on to my favorite part of this conversation, which is the tactical part. Because my view is, yes, the tech side is incredibly important and difficult, but beyond a certain threshold, especially as more smart people come into this space, uh, you have to compete on distribution, but you have to actually get developers to build on a chain. You can build the fastest chain, the most secure chain. If no one builds on it, you still lose out. So I love to focus on kind of what you guys are doing on the getting developers part, because most of our conversations actually before we got involved as investors was actually around this part. It wasn't even about the technical part.
00:42:25.431 - 00:43:06.943, Speaker C: It was because I thought you guys were very, very thoughtful about bootstrapping that ecosystem and show this is not the first ecosystem you've bootstrapped as well, because you've also done it before at consensus. So let's start with the question about apps, right? This year a big theme has been we want more apps. We don't want to back more infra. Everybody keeps saying that. But besides perpetual swap exchanges and some prediction markets, there haven't really been very interesting applications that took off huge. Maybe there were some social things that ended up being somewhat of a flash in the pan. Have there, have there been ever kind of builders that came to you, or maybe in Sanat's case to come to your Porco L1s that say that, hey, we want to build this really interesting application.
00:43:06.943 - 00:43:13.071, Speaker C: It's not available anywhere else, but all the chains out there just can't support what we want to build? What are some examples there?
00:43:13.183 - 00:43:47.001, Speaker A: All the time. You'd be really surprised. I'll give you three examples on top of my head. So Biome, the team is building fully on chain Minecraft. They were trying to use one of the op stack redstone they just broke the chain the moment they launch. The chain was not performing enough for them to have, was it? So you have this other person somewhere there to direct where your little character goes. And Mega user is actually the only environment that a fully launched Minecraft can operate in because of our latency.
00:43:47.001 - 00:44:42.223, Speaker A: When you have low latency, you have high tick rate and that's really important in a game design. Second example is decentralized VPN latency matters one more time because if you can't enable really fast hopping between different nodes, you have performance aggregation and you have a bad VPN and a slow vpn, no one will use it no matter how private it is. The last example is a funny one. It's a Solana founder. You know, he just DMed me when we launched our fundraising and he's building a fitness tracker and I was like, wait, why doesn't it work on Solana? And he's like, you know what, I can't compute all the biometric data real time on Solana. I was like, you got it, we're real time blockchain, so yes, we can host all your real time data, biometric data compute on Omega. So these are the three examples I got on top of my head.
00:44:42.223 - 00:45:09.659, Speaker A: But every day, honestly, I get developers coming to me and they confess to me that most of their application actually don't use the chain. So I often joke, I said devs these days are cheating the chain, so. And because they know it's just current blockchains don't work. And I'm hoping I build an environment that they can come on and be comfortable breaking my chain so I can go iterate on a better chain, find a better end game.
00:45:09.827 - 00:45:28.405, Speaker C: So you're referring to how a lot of Deepin networks have their hardware hosted completely off chain, but then the only thing on chain is like their token which you can trade on exchanges, right? Yeah, definitely. There's quite a few examples of that. Sanaba, what about you? Have you seen any interesting applications that are just not possible in current generation of blockchains?
00:45:28.525 - 00:46:17.281, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean I think when you mentioned Perpetuxes and it's worth pointing out that Perpetuxes decentralized Perpetuxes like hyperliquid is the first attempt we've had that feels like it's really succeeding. But outside of that it's kind of pathetic that like three years after the first perpetux on chain launch they do like 5 to 7% of the volume of Binance. So like it's a big market and no one has succeeded at getting anywhere close is my current view. And some of that is obviously like, for various reasons, but UI UX is a big one. And so enabling that is kind of really important. I think generally the way I think about it is bringing down the cost of trust is super important. And so people forget that rollups did actually enable a whole bunch of cool applications like GMX could not have existed on L1.
00:46:17.281 - 00:46:50.308, Speaker B: Friendtech could not have existed on L1. Fantasytop could not have existed on L1. And so we did actually get a whole new wave of applications that utilized this cheaper, more interesting block space. And I think kind of what Shuya was pointing to, bringing down the cost of trust just means that like, if you have to, like, one way of thinking about it is, okay, you're asking a user to pay a fee for decentralization. If that fee is $10, then the only thing that it really makes sense to do is to make big transactions, transfers of eth. Or like borrow hundreds of dollars. Like, you can't actually buy $5 of a meme coin paying a $10 fee.
00:46:50.308 - 00:47:37.651, Speaker B: When you bring that down to $1, then, okay, there's a whole bunch of interesting stuff that I can actually move on chain. I can start bringing order books on chain, things like that. And I think if you get it down even lower, and I'm sure you covered a lot of the use cases, a lot of these things that we think of as like fundamentally off chain ideas are things that people aren't willing to pay for. Like, very often when you talk to crypto apps, people are like, oh, why does this have crypto? You know, crypto imposes a huge cost on users. Like you have to use this different UI ux, you have to pay a lot more. And so we kind of constrain ourselves to thinking of places where users are very, very willing to pay for decentralization or very, very willing to pay for this, like, permissionlessness. And if we just kind of lower that cost, then a whole bunch of stuff that we don't think of as happening on chain can happen on chain and be more secure.
00:47:37.651 - 00:47:46.795, Speaker B: And so that's kind of the lens I've always looked at it at, and which is why I always think like, there's demand for cheaper and faster block space as long as in some sense there's demand for compute.
00:47:46.915 - 00:48:32.771, Speaker C: Because I think over time a lot of people have adopted this quite cynical view that I've kind of talked about before as well, which is if you add crypto to any application, it rarely improves the user experience. In most cases, it actually degrades the user experience. So to think of crypto as like a type of tech that is inevitable is quite difficult for most people because it makes no sense for me to want to pay for every single, like I do on Twitter or pay for every single tweet. But if you bring the cost down to such like negligible levels that it basically becomes future parity, you know, I think that could happen. So I think you make a pretty good point there. And I think this is probably something that you guys spend a lot of time brainstorming about and kind of incubating even with Mega Eth as well, Right?
00:48:32.883 - 00:48:57.671, Speaker A: Yeah. I was going to say in one of Vitalik's recent blog posts, he's like, describe us, we are AWS with blockchain scaffolding. I thought I was. You know, you have the crypto guarantee somewhere where you need it, but otherwise it feels like aws. But yeah, I think you're right. From a use case perspective, we are. We love wacky crypto ideas.
00:48:57.671 - 00:49:30.159, Speaker A: And I often joke like, you know, I love to go back to 2017 ICO scams because, you know, back then there was no infrastructure, but they can actually be properly built. And you know, things like, for example, decentralized Luma, right. You might be asking, you know, why it's 2024. Why decentralized Luma? I think you're not being creative enough. Right. Imagine you sign up for an activity the moment you get into the event. Until you get out, you can clock the time.
00:49:30.159 - 00:49:57.661, Speaker A: Then you can have very granular input of your personality and how you interact with the event. Or another example would be I've been hosting Help Out Dao for the last four years. My biggest freaking pain point is people don't show up. I'd love to implement a slashing mechanism. Right? You stake some coins. If you don't show up, going to slash you and then suddenly you actually bring your real life on chain. And you can do a lot of community activities.
00:49:57.661 - 00:50:25.377, Speaker A: Like, I'm so excited about these use cases. We have an internal thesis that Mega east needs to provide emotional value to people. Like gone are the days where just a hyper financialized chain. People need to love us, want to come us, want to play a game show with us. Yeah. So I think once we bring down the cost of bringing transaction on chain, everything needs to be on chain because why not?
00:50:25.521 - 00:51:14.103, Speaker C: Yeah, let's talk about that. Let's talk about the social layer of a blockchain, which I think is different people have different interpretations of this. Right. So if you look at Bitcoin, I think the social layer back in like 2008 and early days was like cyberpunk, all these like underground threats and people just are hardcore privacy maximalists. And then Ethereum, I think the kind of culture is very much kind of decentralization focused, very kind of defi adjacent. How would you describe maybe zooming out from Mega Eth a bit? First of all, how does a blockchain create its quote unquote culture? Because it seems to me like there's actually two and some founders don't even realize there's two, which is the developers and then the token holders, which sometimes don't even overlap. The token holders are like the degens and sometimes they don't even care about the tech, but you kind of need them to provide liquidity.
00:51:14.103 - 00:51:26.087, Speaker C: And then you have the developers who sometimes don't really think about the token at all. They just want to build interesting applications. So how do you balance the culture between these two groups? How do you scale these two groups? How do you even get started with these two groups?
00:51:26.191 - 00:52:12.585, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember you asked me to think about the token community a few weeks ago. It's investor value add right there. So from Mega Youth perspective, our thesis is the only way to solve an ecosystem cold stock problem is by having really good applications. So we go after the developer community from the very beginning, very intentionally. And that's why we have the Mega Mafia program which are just craft builders who are pushing the frontier of what could be possibly built on a high performance blockchain. And I think we are doing pretty well with the Mega Mafia program. I think now we are ready to go after the token community.
00:52:12.585 - 00:53:16.555, Speaker A: And I would challenge actually all other blockchain founders have been doing the way that they've been doing. You know, we're seeing a lot of people, you know, paying shills on Twitter and you know, you start having momentum, et cetera. I think these are tactic. But the most important way to build a community in my mind is how Solana did it, which is you have a group of people who are Solana Maxis. No matter what happened with Solana, even though Solana at $12, which surprisingly has more activity than now, Solana is $130, which I find it to be strange turn off events, they stay with the community. To me it was like after building the developer community, I want the token community to have that level of loyalty and to me the only way to have that loyalty is when they actually love the Depth we have and we don't become this like, I don't know, high fdv, low float VC chain. And I think the third one is we're building a culture that's fun.
00:53:16.555 - 00:53:36.167, Speaker A: We are now being perceived as mercenary and we don't do short term oriented activities, we don't farm our community, etc. So all in all, it requires a lot of discipline, a lot of careful thinking and we're about to embark on this journey.
00:53:36.351 - 00:53:52.013, Speaker C: I like that there are a lot of subtle jabs in what you just described. So Sana, I'm not going to make you name the specific change, but have you seen good examples or bad examples of how communities are bootstrapped in either your portals or in L1s that you've been kind of monitoring?
00:53:52.159 - 00:54:21.463, Speaker B: There's, there's good and bad examples. And I mean, Solana is the big one, right? Because I think like in the last four years that's the chain that's been successful. And I think in some sense there's also like, you kind of have to choose to do something differently than what your rivals do. And Solana just does have this focus on shipping. Okay, we are a bunch of people, we optimize for hardware and we ship a bunch of useful stuff. That's the focus here. We're not constantly kind of like Ethereum is just far more academic than Solana.
00:54:21.463 - 00:54:44.519, Speaker B: Like, this is true. Like if you go on E3 search, you can constantly find people writing really long threads about the future of ZK and new ways to prove things. And all of that is super interesting and super useful. And that's meant that Ethereum probably has very robust MEV infrastructure and stuff like that. But Solana has this focus on, yeah, let's just ship stuff, like eat glass and ship stuff. And it's kind of embodied by Anatoly. And I think that's been really useful to them.
00:54:44.519 - 00:55:29.555, Speaker B: I actually know builders who like participate in something like super team and they're like, they really like the focus on like, yeah, just build stuff, just ship it and get to market as fast as you can. And so increasingly I do think, like I said, you have to choose to do something differently than what your rivals do and you have to say no to some things. And I know people aren't very excited about BLAST right now, but I do come back to it because I do think in a universe of boring L2s was not a boring L2. And some of the things they did was they said no. They said no to like, okay, we're not going to, like, chase after Uniswap and AAVE and launch our chain with like, Uniswap and aave. We're actually going to launch our chain with Fantasy Top Thruster, Juice. All these apps that people are like, okay, this is different, this is interesting, this is new.
00:55:29.555 - 00:55:58.163, Speaker B: And so we're always kind of looking for differentiated strategies. The thing is though, I think ideally you want something that enables new apps plus a great community. One of the challenges is that, like, if you like, if there's nothing technical, then it feels like it doesn't last. And the cult thing is interesting because, like, there are polkadot. There are people who are like shilling Polkadot on my timeline right now. They, like still think Polkadot is the future. There are people who made money on link in 2017 and never gave up.
00:55:58.163 - 00:56:34.275, Speaker B: Like, you can go to 4chan's business thread, business forum and there is always a thread of people talking about how Link is going to go up, like consistently for the last eight years. I think they just continue to believe in it. And so you do need a cult that's not stupid. Like, I think that's important because clearly, like polkadot and chainlinks just don't matter that much anymore. And so I think there is a balance. And I definitely agree that like, people like chains where there's interesting things to do. And that's in some ways what like aptos, since we haven't managed to do just yet, is build a place where there's interesting stuff to do.
00:56:34.275 - 00:57:01.743, Speaker B: I also think particularly when it comes to tokens, people do need to zoom out. There's a sense in which, like, people really look at like, okay, the TGE was yesterday. This is what it's trading at. These investors made money. The airdrop was sold for this. And when you zoom out, like, Solana had a four year cycle when it fell to 10 and came back and a lot of its competitors that had gone up, like I remember last cycle, Soluna Avax was like just like a consistent thing that people kept saying Soluna Avax. And it was just like, okay, these are the three blockchains of the future.
00:57:01.743 - 00:57:29.623, Speaker B: And it turned out that actually Solana was the blockchain of the future. Luna was very much not the blockchain of the future. And Avax has definitely lost some traction. And so I think that is like, people can get excited by prices going up and just kind of form mini cults. But the difference was that all through the bear market, Solana had a bunch of developers eating glass and building new apps. And so I do think this, like very short term focus on like, oh, this is what happened at your token launch and now it's game over for you. It's like kind of neither here nor there on like four, five year time horizons.
00:57:29.759 - 00:58:14.295, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's the, that's the differentiation between token communities and developer communities. And to a certain extent I also feel like you kind of need a Herculean effort in the beginning to bootstrap the community. Right. For Solana, they almost had a patron in the form of ftx where a lot of the early applications were built by FTX guys like Serum. There's a bunch of wallet, there's a bunch of dashboards that were built by the FTX team. And then obviously I think the McAlenao twins who just pretended to be 12 different teams and just bootstrap a lot of stuff, you can kind of shit on that and say, hey, FTX was a big scam and Macaleno twins were probably committed some sort of crime. But you could also argue that without that bootstrapping there probably wouldn't have scaled as fast in terms of the developer mindshare.
00:58:14.295 - 00:58:43.161, Speaker C: So I think right now the way that people try to replicate some element of that is just to do incubation. I think every single L1 should be having like a crack incubation team. Like to not incubate actually makes no sense to me. So I think what Mega Eve is doing with the Mega Mafia, which you guys should check out if you're listening at home, is very interesting. Now, in the interest of time, I'd like to kind of wrap up by talking about an opportunity for L1s. Right. Because we spent so much of the episode talking about how great Solana is.
00:58:43.161 - 00:59:42.925, Speaker C: I'd like to be a bit fair and kind of maybe each of us can name something that we think Solana is not as good at that could be an opportunity for other L1s. And just to set aside our back biases, we will Try to name L1s that are not megaeth or not Monad in this case, since we also brought up Monad. So what is the opportunity that Solana is not tackling today that maybe another L1 could tackle? I think one that Solana is not tackling, I think is the market that Tron is tackling, which is like hyper cheap stablecoin payments in Asia for some reason. I think in the early days Solana was very, very prominent in Asia because FTX was based here and a lot of the Solana community was here. But then I think over this past cycle, a lot of the people who got involved with Solana when the token was trading very low was actually in the US First. A lot of builders were in the US for some reason, they have kind of lost mindshare, at least anecdotally in Asia. So I think Asia Focus kind of go to market.
00:59:42.925 - 00:59:46.577, Speaker C: Something like Tron could be a candidate for that.
00:59:46.681 - 01:00:29.145, Speaker B: I'm not sure I can name a specific L1. There's a couple of teams working on this, including one called Delta. But I think one idea that I have pretty often is that a lot of crypto is based on crypto economic mechanisms where basically people put up collateral, say they'll do something, and if they don't do it, they get slashed. And I think we are still underestimating how much really efficient ZK changes all of that. And one of the thoughts I have pretty often is that like, okay, if you start from first principles with zk, you actually don't need stakers, you don't need proof of stake. A lot of constructions that we have in crypto are kind of like us trying to shovel ZK into the ZK rollups that currently exist. Again, trying to shovel ZK into Ethereum.
01:00:29.145 - 01:01:12.281, Speaker B: And so if I had like a dark horse candidate, I think if you like try and start with a blank slate on ZK and say, okay, I'm going to build an L1 that is like just assumes that everyone can prove things and no one has to put up any collateral ever. There are no crypto economic mechanisms and try and figure out what that looks like. And there are three, four teams working on that. That's like my current dark horse for where a lot of this industry is going. Because as industry is super focused on crypto economic mechanisms and ZK could actually break all of that. And it's a weird world to live in because it doesn't have a lot of place for tokens. That's kind of the, like really, that's kind of the scary part of ZK because like all our tokens kind of are used for staking and stuff and doesn't do much in ZK.
01:01:12.281 - 01:01:19.655, Speaker B: And so maybe if you start from first principles, launch an L1 with no token that just is like compute. That is proved by everyone all the time.
01:01:19.825 - 01:01:47.175, Speaker A: You don't need token to do anything. Most tokens are governance token anyway. So your public goods are good value proposition. I kept thinking about one of the tweets that Matt posted a few months ago. He asked, you know, Solana is not the place where filecoaster would happen. No one on Solana is innovating the really frontier of things like decentralized social. We can talk about Solana having Deepin.
01:01:47.175 - 01:02:11.883, Speaker A: I don't think any Deep in has like serious product market fit. Yeah but like really cypher punky like very wacky ideas I don't think are happening on Solana. I don't know what's the reason behind them. It seems to me very much a very much a hyper financialized chain. Right. I still think Pump Dolphin is the best thing that has happened to them. And you know they're different variation.
01:02:11.883 - 01:02:44.257, Speaker A: We can go after that. I can't think about an R1 R2 that replaced that to me that's why I'm passionate about Ethereum to be honest. Like shameless plug. I do think as nerdy as the Ethereum community is, we are the one that dare to try something like Flycaster and actually make it a thing. And having Vitalik abandoned Twitter I just go full time shippers over there. So I think that lack of innovation is something I think opportunity another layer one or L2 can come in.
01:02:44.431 - 01:02:48.105, Speaker C: So I guess gun to head that chain might have to be based then.
01:02:48.565 - 01:02:56.437, Speaker A: No wait, why there's a chain here? I'm about to eat glass literally. My conclusion, okay.
01:02:56.581 - 01:03:18.285, Speaker C: I'm trying to set a sign of back biases but okay, so Asia ZK and actually culture which I never thought of. That's very, very interesting point that you brought up about Solana. So these three are probably some of the opportunities for infra builders of the future. I think this has been really really fun. So for people who want to check out Mega Eth or follow you, Shuyao, where should people go?
01:03:19.225 - 01:03:34.345, Speaker A: Mega Eth labs? Come to our website, read our white paper. But more actually more importantly come to our discord. You can find it on Twitter handle. Please don't follow me. I'm still trying to sydude. So if you're watching this, don't tell people I'm a girl, please.
01:03:34.505 - 01:03:41.989, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll include everything in the show notes except for your Twitter. Maybe we'll include your Twitter as well. But yeah, thanks for coming on guys and we'll see you in the next episode.
