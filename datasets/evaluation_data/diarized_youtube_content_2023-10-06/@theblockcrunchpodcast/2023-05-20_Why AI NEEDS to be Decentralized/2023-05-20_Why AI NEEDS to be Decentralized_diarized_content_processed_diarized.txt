00:00:00.160 - 00:00:50.604, Speaker A: Now that whole pipeline today is essentially owned by a handful of large technology companies. And the whole idea of web3 times AI, the way that I see it in my mind is that we can use web3 primitives to make that pipeline open and democratized. Like, I don't think we want to be in a world where OpenAI, by virtue of having the largest, best performing, most popular model, sucks in everybody's data. Like more data than Google. I just don't think we want to live in that world. I think the web3 vision is that data is self sovereign. Maybe libertarian in a sense, it's a libertarian view.
00:00:50.604 - 00:00:59.784, Speaker A: Have enough technology or we can create enough technology to turn that pipeline upside down. Inverter.
