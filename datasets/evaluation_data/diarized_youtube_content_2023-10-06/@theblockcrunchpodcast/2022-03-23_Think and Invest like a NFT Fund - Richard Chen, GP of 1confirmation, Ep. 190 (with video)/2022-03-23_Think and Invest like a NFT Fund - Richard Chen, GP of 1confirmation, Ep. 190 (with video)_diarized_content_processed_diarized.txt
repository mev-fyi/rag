00:00:02.120 - 00:00:07.022, Speaker A: Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors.
00:00:07.078 - 00:00:23.190, Speaker B: And builders in crypto. This episode of the Blockcrunch podcast is brought to you by Coinflex and Paraswap. Stick around to learn more.
00:00:23.342 - 00:01:12.824, Speaker A: Hey, everybody, I'm super excited to have another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast with my good friend Richard Chen, who is general partner at one confirmation, one of the earliest crypto investing funds. And if youve been following the show for a while, you know, we did an episode recently back in August 2021, talking about Richard's investment thesis and some of his general thoughts around nfts as an early investor in both OpenSea super rare and a few other projects that became massive successes. Im really, really interested in how Richard processes nfts and how he interprets the themes out there and how he picks his investments as well. And since August, there's a lot that happened in the past few months. So I'm really excited for this episode to catch up and also to get Richard's thoughts on the crazy things that happened in the past four or five months. So, Richard, welcome to the show again.
00:01:13.324 - 00:01:15.304, Speaker C: Thanks, Jason, for having me on again.
00:01:16.324 - 00:01:49.164, Speaker A: Yeah, and I'm excited that this is one of our first video interviews as well. Well, just to kind of get us started, let's jump right into the meat of it. We, you know, before the interview, we had this discussion around whether we think a basket of blue chip NFTs will outperform, say, the top ten altcoins by market cap. So id love to get your thoughts on there in terms of your outlook. Right. If you have to invest in a basket of altcoins versus a basket of nfts for the next, say, five years, where do you see more upside?
00:01:50.184 - 00:02:42.530, Speaker C: Yeah, well, its hard to give like specific price predictions or anything. But overall, I say the NFT market is still more nascent compared to cryptocurrencies. So I think one thing that's changed in the past year is we've had more institutional adoptions of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin ETH and others, which is a double edged sword. It's good that there's more legitimacy in this space, but the downside is that now crypto is pretty macro correlated with Fed monetary policy. Um, so I don't think bitcoin ETH will have like nearly as much upside as it did, you know, back in like 2014. Whereas, you know, what we're seeing with NFTs right now is kind of like 2017 or earlier. If you were to like make a similar historical analogy where it's still like a very nascent asset class.
00:02:42.530 - 00:03:22.364, Speaker C: It's a lot of speculation. You know, ten k pfps is kind of like the icos of 2017, but like done a little bit more artistic, artistically and tastefully. But because of that, I think the most successful projects, just like how the most successful projects from the 2017 era outperformed significantly. I think that will probably happen with NFT, is where the top NFT projects and collections will outperform all coins in the broader market significantly.
00:03:23.384 - 00:04:09.994, Speaker A: That's really interesting because my initial thought was actually to disagree, just because I feel like there's more, I guess, activity to benchmark to for a lot of these all coins, especially in defi where there's actual cash flows you can model out. Whereas for me, a lot of the NFT pfps have always been a little bit amorphous in terms of where the value comes from. Which I guess brings me to my next question. In a previous interview with an NFT collector called Beastfi, he mentioned that one of the core heuristics he uses when he invests in an NFT specifically is to see who will buy it from him at a higher price. So im curious what you think about that. Are there other ways to think about value and nfts as opposed to just thinking whos going to buy it from you?
00:04:11.014 - 00:05:04.880, Speaker C: That literally is the definition of a bubble. Its the greater fools theory. Something just because some greater fool will buy from me at a higher price down the road. I mean, look, it's, you know, kind of at, at the end of the day, it's like culture. It's like art is like if you look at like the traditional art market, like why are Picasso's worth so much? Whereas like some random artist who like, makes just as good art, like they're not worth like a lot. It's just because a couple of whales and bake collectors basically move the market and decide what's valuable. And I think that's going to be the case where the top collections are in diamond hands and those collectors will ensure that the floor price doesn't drop below a certain amount.
00:05:04.880 - 00:05:26.764, Speaker C: It's just like if you go to an auction house and there's an Andy Warhol up for auction, like the existing Andy Warhol collectors will make sure that it gets bid up over a certain price because otherwise it'll devalue their collection. So there is some notion of a floor price with nfts.
00:05:27.384 - 00:05:36.444, Speaker A: That's quite interesting. I guess on that note, what would you say are some of your favorite bets or some of your most successful bets in terms of specific collections so far?
00:05:37.284 - 00:06:07.518, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, our most successful investment, this is out of the fund, is probably going to be the Genesis mint on super air. So it was basically the very first NFT minted on super air. This was back in April 2018. The owner of that decided to fire sale. So you listed it for 100 ETH, and we snatched it up immediately. But because of the lendiness and narrative around that, that could potentially be a fun return.
00:06:07.518 - 00:06:09.514, Speaker C: Or just that one NFT alone.
00:06:10.734 - 00:06:12.846, Speaker A: So you purchased it at 100 ETH?
00:06:12.990 - 00:06:13.670, Speaker C: Yes.
00:06:13.822 - 00:06:15.758, Speaker A: Oh, wow. And this is back in 2018?
00:06:15.886 - 00:06:25.834, Speaker C: No, no, the NFT was minted back in 2018, and then we made the purchase, I want to say January 2021.
00:06:27.694 - 00:06:41.734, Speaker A: Got it. And I guess when, when you saw that NFT, what was the process behind it? Like, what made you decide that, hey, this is going to be a good investment? Was it like evaluating the artists behind it? And if so, how do you compare different artists and so on?
00:06:42.474 - 00:06:57.054, Speaker C: Well, it's more of, like, getting, like, we wanted more exposure to super rare. So, like, you know, we invested in equity in the company. And, like, an obvious way to, like, support the project was to, like, you know, buy the very first NFT ever minted on the platform.
00:06:58.584 - 00:07:21.056, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting because in our previous interview with Deez as well, that's one of the things he mentioned as well when he looks for nfts to invest in, which is this idea of historical or cultural significance. Usually, if it's one of the first nfts on a blockchain or one of the first entities ever, then it might probably have more value. Is that one of the criteria that you look for as well, some sort of cultural significance?
00:07:21.160 - 00:07:49.554, Speaker C: Yeah. What story can the artist tell? Kind of a mental model is like, if you were to look back, like, 20 years from now in, like, an art history textbook, as, like, what do you think will be the pieces that are highlighted in this textbook? And, like, those are, like, basically all things that have historical or, like, cultural significance. And, like, you know, being first is, like, certainly a very good indicator of that.
00:07:50.414 - 00:08:06.714, Speaker A: Are there other, I guess, things on your checklist that you kind of tick off when you look for an NFT to invest in? Like, cultural significance being one of them? And I think you also mentioned, you know, the popularity of the artist being another one. Are there some other kind of traits that you look for?
00:08:07.294 - 00:08:58.574, Speaker C: I say, like, understanding community building is, like, super underrated. And, like, I noticed this a lot with artists, especially photographers who come from, like, you know, the Instagram world and, like, have very big followings on Instagram, but I guess are probably new to Twitter and, like, web3 crypto natives, which, like, that's largely where the collector base is. And at the end of the day, it's like, without engaging your community, your collector community, and like, kind of giving them value, you're kind of like doing a disservice to your existing collectors. And I have seen, like, many times where, like, artists will do like a couple of mints and then just kind of drop off and stop engaging. And that's like, ultimately hurtful to the collectors long term.
00:08:59.514 - 00:09:37.884, Speaker A: So community building, cultural significance, and also the popularity of the artists, all of these sound, at least to defi investors, it might sound very kind of almost wishy washy and that it's hard to measure, it's hard to quantify. I know you do a lot of quantification on quantitative analysis on Dune, which we can touch on later, but for at least a DeFi asset, for instance, I can model out cash flows, and from that I can project maybe a target price for me to exit. But for say, a PFP or for an NFT, how do you decide what is the reasonable price to exit?
00:09:39.244 - 00:10:25.244, Speaker C: Yeah, well, in terms of exit, I guess that hasn't really been an issue because personally, I kind of just hold my collection. And also for the fun, we haven't really, we haven't sold any of our nfts, so I guess we'll think more about exiting later when we have to. But, yeah, that's like, one big difference between DeFi and nfts is, I think I talked about this in our last podcast, is like, it's very like left brain versus white right brain, where Defi, you're looking at fundamental analysis, cash flows, all of that. Whereas nfts, you're kind of like a talent agent is like you're identifying like, culturally significant trends early on. Like kind of like being like Hollywood talent agency and betting on those artists early.
00:10:26.824 - 00:11:00.572, Speaker A: And I guess on that note, just to wrap up this part about general kind of NFT process, before we dive into specific projects here, how would you go about valuing an individual piece of nfts? Not just in the case of exiting, but say you see a project with great cultural significance, there's a great narrative artist, is really popular. It's already been listed for a year or so. So the price there is a liquid price. And how do you decide? Is 50 ETH a good buy for this? Is 100 ETH a good buy for this. How do you ascribe some framework around value for individual nfts?
00:11:00.748 - 00:11:49.454, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the framework people generally use is like comps is just like looking at historical sales of the artist, also like other artists in the same category. So, like, if you're talking about photography, then like other blue chip photographers with the same genre say it's like landscape photography and like what their pieces are selling for, with like very liquid collections like bored apes and cryptopunks, then it's a lot easier. There's more clear valuation metrics, and there's also a bunch of projects now that are building models to appraise value of these nfts just because there's a lot more data points to look at based on historical sales and also the attributes. But, yeah, valuation is still an open question.
00:11:50.634 - 00:12:15.974, Speaker A: Yeah. And I guess that goes back to the point about the definition of a bubble, right. If it depends on comms and the comps started trading down, then the whole thing seems to able to unravel. And I guess we saw a little bit of that in the past month when a lot of entities started to trade down a bit. Is that a concern that a lot of the perception of value is very much almost like self referential. It's worth this much because it's been worth this much before?
00:12:17.154 - 00:12:45.654, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's kind of largely the art market in general, where it's a lot of it's driven by mimetic desire and kind of. It's valuable because, like, other people think it's valuable, therefore it's valuable. You can argue the same thing with, like, fiat money and a lot of these. This is a kind of a rabbit hole to get into of, like, epistemology and metaphysics. Like, why do these. Why are these things valuable? Like, kind of the philosophy behind that.
00:12:46.554 - 00:13:10.294, Speaker A: That's very fair, and I think that's a great way to pivot into talking about specific projects. Since we last chatted, there has been a lot of new projects. I think bored apes was already around when we were first chatting, but then, since then, there's a lot of. I wouldn't say copycats, but projects that are quite similar in scope. And one project that a lot of people are asking about on Twitter is this thing called Azuki, which I don't know if you saw.
00:13:11.234 - 00:13:15.614, Speaker C: Yes, I'm not super familiar with Azuki, though I haven't gone deep in it.
00:13:16.834 - 00:13:38.304, Speaker A: I guess just to be more general, projects like Azuki basically profile pictures with no other use cases except for maybe you can display it on Twitter. How do you think these things will fare out? Because there's so many Azuki's and bored apes out there. What separates the blue chips from the rest, given they're all launched within the same three months?
00:13:38.644 - 00:14:30.090, Speaker C: Yeah, at the end of the day, these PFP NFTs are membership passes. And this goes back to my earlier point about community, is how do you ensure your NFT project is Lindy? Is by constantly giving your rewarding your collectors with value. So say bored apes gives you access to a discord, a Dao, like in person events. And then now with the launch of these ape token like airdrops. So constantly finding creative ways to reward existing collectors is. Is like one way of like, kind of keeping these, this valuable. Whereas if it's just kind of, you know, a narrative and just like a PFP, then, you know, it could, like, stay like, culturally, culturally relevant.
00:14:30.090 - 00:14:40.306, Speaker C: But it's a lot harder to do so when, you know, kind of narratives are fleeting and people move on to the next relevant trend.
00:14:40.410 - 00:15:08.556, Speaker B: Before I continue, I'd love to share more about a later sponsor, Coinflex. Now, Coinflex is an exchange that's been around for a while. They're actually doing $1.5 billion in daily trading volume right now. Recently, their team reached out and walked me through their latest product, the AMM. In short, it lets anybody earn fees as market makers on the Coinflex exchange simply by depositing their assets. As of this recording, the seven day in range average for ETH AMM pool depositors is 82%.
00:15:08.556 - 00:15:46.466, Speaker B: So how does this work? If you're familiar with how other amms out there work, this is very similar. You can basically select what price range to provide liquidity for, and the UI even shows you your risk under different scenarios. I also love that they have this cross collateral system, so you can market make in any market you want using pretty much any collateral you have. If you know how to manage your risks, you can even access up to ten x leverage while providing liquidity. So this is one of the most creative ways I've seen a company borrow elements from Defi in a centralized exchange setting. So I highly encourage you to check it out@coinflex.com. Ammunition I'd love to share one of my favorite products in crypto with you now.
00:15:46.466 - 00:16:28.314, Speaker B: Whenever I want to trade a token, instead of going to uniswap sushiswap Bancor one by one to see where I can find the best quote, I just go to Paraswap to scan for the best price anywhere because paraswap aggregates all the popular ethereum dexs and saves me a ton of time and headache in finding where I can trade something for the best price and lets me trade in one place. Now, the cool thing is they've also integrated with ledger life as well, meaning I can now swap at the best prices directly from my ledger wallet. So seriously, if you are a defi trader and you're worried about the security risks of centralized exchanges, but you also don't want to scour dozens of dexs just to find the best price, you have to check out Paraswap. So head on over to Paraswap IO blockcrunch.
00:16:29.414 - 00:17:09.514, Speaker A: Yeah, and I guess on that community oriented front, a project that I really want to get your thoughts on is also looks rare. So for the listeners out there who are not aware, looks rare is essentially a community owned version of Opensea. At least that's how they brand themselves. They have a token out there already. And I think the argument a lot of people make in favor of looks rare is that Opensea, the incumbent, is not community or ended because the platform retains fees and looks where it doesn't retain fee, and it rewards its users with its own token. What do you think about all of this? What do you think about looks rare specifically? And then I guess we'll talk generically about these kind of community oriented forks later.
00:17:09.894 - 00:17:58.206, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, if you look at the history of these community oriented forks, they all suffer the similar fate, which is like, they realize that ideas are cheap, but execution is way more important and harder. And I'll give a few examples. So you have Ethereum and Ethereum classic, and Ethereum classic was this purist community fork ultimately died because, like, the social consensus was on Ethereum. Same thing with bitcoin and bitcoin cash. Same with Uniswap and sushi. So it's good. Like, these community forks are good at like, getting retweets and a lot of capitalizing on, like, the narrative and like, the Twitter drama and hype around it, and also for insiders to make a lot of money from, like, getting into the presale.
00:17:58.206 - 00:18:59.568, Speaker C: But you quickly realized that Opensea had to grind through a multi year NFT bear market just to build a product that they had today. And it's a lot easier to get a bunch of retweets and insiders pumping the price of looks, but then it is to actually build a useful product. Opensea has a really big defensible moat, which is that 99% of their engineering effort is spent on website search and discovery UI UX Sre like SRE DevOps stuff. And the smart contracts have not changed since 2018 until very recently. So it's very different from a defi fork where if you fork Uniswap then you fork 90% of the secret sauce of Uniswap. Whereas for opensea there's a lot of front end stuff that has to be done manually. For example, if you want to filter in art blocks collections, there's no standardized NFT metadata standard.
00:18:59.568 - 00:19:34.544, Speaker C: So like how you filter an arc blocks collection is very different from how you filter a bored apes collection and all that has to be done manually. That's also like how I think we talked about this earlier, how Coingecko is pretty defensible because token listings on Coingecko are also done manually and that's how they get data circulating supply out of fully diluted things like that. So overall execution is really hard. And that's the thing that these own forks end up realizing at the end of the day.
00:19:35.444 - 00:20:17.724, Speaker A: Yeah, and I guess another challenge for a lot of community owned forks is they tend to accrue value much faster than they accrue adoption. I forgot what looks where it started trading at, but it was a pretty high valuation for a startup that was essentially a few months old. So I don't know if that makes it harder to bring on board newer people given there's not as much upside. But it does look like that's a general challenge that a lot of these community oriented forks suffer from. So I guess just to be contrarian, are there any reasons that a community oriented fork like looksrare could potentially take off, see a future for these types of projects?
00:20:22.344 - 00:20:34.084, Speaker C: Not off the top of my head. I'm sure there's going to be one that works eventually, but just historically the odds are stacked against them.
00:20:35.304 - 00:21:00.774, Speaker A: On the topic of Opensea, you mentioned that a lot of the front end stuff is manual as well. And recently we started to see some of these aggregation tooling taking off pretty significantly. Things like Genie and Gem that allows people to batch purchase nfts that are listed on Opensea. Do you see a wedge for those products to become full fledged companies as well? Or is that a feature that maybe OpenSea could build themselves?
00:21:01.394 - 00:22:11.884, Speaker C: Yeah, Genie. And one big difference between them and community forks is genie and Gem especially gem is way more focused on execution and that's super underrated. The other thing is I mentioned that opensees, they're innovating on search and discovery, front end kind of the web, two infrastructure stuff, but the smart contracts have largely stayed the same since 2018, but whereas Gem, they're innovating more on smart contract layers, in my opinion. I call Gem less of an aggregator, but more of like a broker, where they do more fancy trade execution features for nfts that are really only possible if you write your custom smart contracts. And like, if you look at the genie contracts on chain, like they're constantly deploying new contracts on chain, all of them are unaudited because they constantly ship new features. And that's how you can do things like sweep the floor for something or have dynamically adjusting list prices. And that's all because it's done at a smart contract level.
00:22:13.224 - 00:22:37.264, Speaker A: That's quite interesting, and I'd love to use this opportunity to talk about other marketplaces as well. I think in our last interview you mentioned that some of the more niche marketplaces, like super rare and foundation, did not increase their adoption or usage proportionally with the growth of the rest of the NFT market. I'm curious if anything's changed there and whether you see that to be a persistent trend.
00:22:38.684 - 00:23:14.564, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, the benefit of being like a generalized marketplace like Opensea is you kind of index all the different subcategories within nfts. They'll like within nfts, like different categories, like art, music, collectibles, metaverse, real estate, and others. There's going to be like Lowell, like kind of bull markets and like kind of a drawback. So while being Opensea, you're more antifragile to each of the like cyclical nature of, for each of the individual submarkets.
00:23:15.924 - 00:23:40.332, Speaker A: And I'm actually super curious like why, how, given that Opensea is generalized and catered towards all types of nfts, how did things like super rare take off? Why was there a space for them to take off? Given that you can probably purchase the same stuff? Technically you can purchase the same stuff or list the same stuff. You listen to super rare on Opensea. What did they do that made them successful in their own niche?
00:23:40.508 - 00:24:44.630, Speaker C: Yeah, at the end of the day, it's search and discovery and user experience. And when you're just focused on being a premier art marketplace for one of ones, you want a really minimalist, nice UI Ux. That's great for artists to showcase their arts, for collectors to showcase their collection. And that's not really appealing if your one of one art is sitting next to some random collectible in your Openz wallet. And that's been a big thesis of ours in the last few months, is verticalized NFT marketplaces, because they can focus on having a good ux for each vertical that they're building on. So, example is a recent investment we made is metahood, which is a zillow for metaverse real estate. And if you were to search, say, voxels or decentraland land or sandbox land on Opensea, like, you would have no spatial perception of like, where that land is relative to anything else.
00:24:44.630 - 00:25:08.134, Speaker C: There isn't a map in Opensea, but if you have a dedicated marketplace for that, then you can have like the zillow map you show, like, where that land is relative to everywhere else. You can have appraisal for that piece of land. These are like UI, hugely important UI UX features that like Opensea just can't support because they're a generalized marketplace.
00:25:08.994 - 00:25:26.734, Speaker A: And when you say verticalization, do you consider nfts on different chains to be, to be verticals as well? Would you consider a marketplace only for nfts on Xchain an example of a verticalized NFT marketplace as well?
00:25:27.914 - 00:25:43.414, Speaker C: Not really. I call that more of like horizontal adoption. So, horizontal versus vertical monopolies. Horizontally, you expand into other areas, and verticalized means you own the entire stack.
00:25:45.034 - 00:26:00.464, Speaker A: Got it? And this is one point that I think Jake Brookman from Coinfund raised as well, which is this idea that nfts transcend their underlying chain. I'm curious what you think about that. Does it matter what chain nfts are built on?
00:26:01.204 - 00:26:44.294, Speaker C: I think it does. So I guess I would probably take the other side of Jake's thesis, mainly because like lendiness is. And like, I've also been like, this has been a huge discussion right now with super rare. And like other projects I know that are looking at L2s is like. Yes, like they're interested in L2 s because of like cheaper gas costs. But they still want the nfts to be minted on ethereum, layer one because of the lendiness of layer one. And then L2 could be useful for having a marketplace contract where you do the auctions and the trading there, but you still want to mint it on l one.
00:26:44.294 - 00:27:25.804, Speaker C: We see this with marketplaces on Tezos or on Polygon or Solana. There's a very different average price that if the same artists were to mint on different l one s, the average price of pieces on specific l one is very different when you compare them to each other. So I made this mistake when I was buying stuff on Tezos, and I thought I was getting such a good deal because all this stuff is super cheap relative to Ethereum. But it turns out, no, like, people, collectors are willing to pay a premium for nfts from the exact same artists that are minted on Ethereum. L1.
00:27:26.584 - 00:27:31.564, Speaker A: Why do you think that is? Is that just a matter of, like, culture adoption?
00:27:32.504 - 00:28:08.144, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like you're kind of, you know, guaranteed that, like, these NFTs will be around forever. And, like, there's just, there's like, little platform risk. Right. Um, and like, this was the case with, uh, he can't nuke, which was the marketplace on Tezos is, um, I guess I think they had like, some internal drama and then, like, the company just like kind of rage quit. Uh, fortunately, like, someone else built like a front end mirror. So, like, your nfTs, like, weren't completely rugged, but like that, that's like the kind of risk that you take minting on some other platform.
00:28:09.244 - 00:28:27.280, Speaker A: So I guess the, the Lindy for NFTs on specific chains is depending on the Lindy of the underlying platform as well. So if you, you don't have, if you're not as bullish on, say, the Tezos ecosystem or the Tezos developers, then probably not a good idea to be sweeping for floors on the Tasos marketplace.
00:28:27.312 - 00:28:50.904, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Like the marketplace you're minting on and like, the blockchain you're minting on. So, like, you know, there's also, like, a big price difference between, like, super and foundation, even though they're both, you know, selling one of one. Super Air is curated, which is why the same artists selling this pieces on both super and foundation. The average price on super will always be higher than foundation.
00:28:52.084 - 00:29:03.144, Speaker A: Got it. And this really ties back to the point about discovery that you mentioned as well. And just to make sure we touch on the comment you made, which is verticalized marketplaces, what are the verticals you're most excited for?
00:29:04.244 - 00:30:02.920, Speaker C: I think music is the one that's breaking out the most. It's kind of surprised me how long it's taken until now. I think one large reason is because searching, discovery and music is hard. It's not like art, where you can just quickly scroll through an Instagram feed and you can quickly pick the stuff that you like for music, you have to actually take the time to listen to it. But yeah, one of our portfolio companies is catalog. And I think they have potential to be like, what Soundcloud kind of failed to do is be a platform for search and discovery for new indie artists where they don't have to go the traditional path of getting tied to record labels and management companies and unfair contracts. And NFTs is just the very tip of the iceberg of providing that new business model for artists, for musicians, and for catalog.
00:30:02.952 - 00:30:05.704, Speaker A: Are they packaging royalties for artists or is that.
00:30:05.864 - 00:30:33.318, Speaker C: No, it's just, it's just like the one on one nfts. I guess I'm pretty, like, bearish royalties relative to, like, just the music NFTs. I think two reasons. One is has to do with, like, securities law, because tying royalties to NFT makes it. There's a strong argument that it resembles a security. So there's that issue. And the second is, well, actually three.
00:30:33.318 - 00:31:18.844, Speaker C: Second is then you have to deal with negotiating contracts, renegotiating contracts with existing record labels and management companies. So that's a huge business development problem. And then three is, if you just look at the economics of royalties, the amount of cash flow that you get is tiny compared to how much you make selling nfts. And there's, I think a musician RAC, like, he actually posted a really good tweet thread about this. He. Compared to how much he made from Spotify streams, compared to how much he's made from NFT sales and basically five collectors, only five of his collectors have earned him more than cumulative Spotify streams since he's started.
00:31:19.664 - 00:32:04.454, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember seeing this stat about sound mint as well, where an artist made more in one NFT drop than he would have made in like 21 million streams. I don't know if that was the same musician, but that was pretty astounding to me. And it's curious you bring up this point about royalties, because all the projects that I've spoken to in music nfts, they have these roundabout ways of going around the securities considerations. So some of them might create a studio where they would purchase your NFT back at a value that's equivalent to what the royalties would be. So they're not distributing royalties. It's somehow tied to the value of the nfTs. And then there's this other project that was separating the royalties and the music into like two separate tokens.
00:32:04.454 - 00:32:26.464, Speaker A: The royalties can't be traded, but you could be airdropped it if you hold the music nfts. But for now, it does seem like there's a lot of security, a lot of kind of regulatory overhead for teams that are trying to crack the royalties. If we have clearer regulatory frameworks around that, would you become more bullish on these kind of package royalties?
00:32:27.964 - 00:33:17.404, Speaker C: Possibly, but no, I just think the most disruptive thing is something that we haven't seen that doesn't exist before, and that's the core invention of the NFT, not trying to fit some new paradigm into an existing framework. Actually, Chris Dixon wrote a really good blog post about this a few years ago. I think it's like some title. I think it's something like easy technologies versus hard technologies, whereas you want to be swinging for the fences and building stuff that's super disruptive, rather than trying to play it safe and tie some new framework to what's already existing in the legacy system.
00:33:18.394 - 00:33:39.138, Speaker A: Yeah, Chris sticks. It is definitely a lot more eloquent than I am. I wrote something similar recently, I think a title, the subtitle of that section was called skeuomorphic these nuts. So not the most eloquent on my part, but I totally understand the point about building things that are totally disruptive versus skeuomorphic and trying to retrofit them into existing stuff.
00:33:39.266 - 00:34:03.704, Speaker C: Yeah, I just found it's called strong and weak technologies is the name of his blog post. It talks about examples like the public Internet versus the information superhighway. I guess if you're around in the nineties, you know what that is. Things like Skype versus voiceover IP, examples like this throughout history.
00:34:04.444 - 00:34:30.360, Speaker A: That's super interesting. We definitely should include that in the show notes as well. And since we're talking about packaging royalties, I think a good segue is NFT DeFi as well, or this idea about building financial rails for nfts. So we've seen two major examples of this. Actually, three major examples. So we have platforms that let you fractionalize nfts into fungible tokens. We have platforms that let you collateralize your NFT and then take a loan against that.
00:34:30.360 - 00:34:37.924, Speaker A: And then we have platforms that let you lend out your nfts. What are your general thoughts here? Is there a market for these DeFi rails?
00:34:38.434 - 00:35:28.144, Speaker C: Yeah, there definitely is. It's still very early, obviously, because the total market cap of nfts has to grow significantly to support derivatives and these DeFi projects. I think the biggest use case for all this DeFi rails is answering the billion dollar question is, how do I get exposure to blue chip nfts without being a whale? I actually had a tweet thread about this. There's a couple of different ways you could do it through derivatives. So like kind of like doing a synthetic, like synthetics before these nfts where you rely on price. Oracle, you could do it on with prediction markets, you could do it with investment daos, or you can do it with fractionalizing nfts. And I kind of outlined the pros and cons of each approach in this thread.
00:35:29.404 - 00:35:44.354, Speaker A: Definitely. We'll definitely include that into the show notes below as well. Well, ortrend, as we're coming to the end of the interview, I'd love for you to kind of give us an outlook in terms of are there specific verticals or even specific projects that you're really, really excited for in the next few years?
00:35:46.574 - 00:36:37.744, Speaker C: I think search and discovery is still hugely underrated in the NFT space. So now there's a lot of blog posts and thought leadership, like VCA thought leadership about the unbundling of OpenSea and how OpenSea will become. And I know I talked about this is how it will be unbundled through these verticalized marketplaces. But I think the bigger thing that no one's talking about is search and discovery. If you use the OpenSea search box right now today, it's still pretty rudimentary in how you can find collections. And the key insight here is that people largely go to Opensea with already the intention of knowing what they want to purchase. They don't really go to OpenSea to browse around and try to find new collections.
00:36:37.744 - 00:37:08.814, Speaker C: That's done through Twitter, through Discord, these off chain social media platforms, someone who can build a really nice search and discovery platform, or I like to compare it to Spotify for nfts, where you have curated playlists, that's how you discover. That's how I discover new music at least, is by going through other people's playlists and seeing what they curated. I think that's a hugely valuable tool.
00:37:10.034 - 00:37:24.424, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Search and discovery, that's going to be a theme that we're definitely going to be keeping an eye out for, I guess. On that note, I know we've already covered this in the last podcast, but in case this is the first time people are hearing from you, what are the best places for them to follow you?
00:37:24.964 - 00:37:30.428, Speaker C: Yeah, Twitter. I am Richard Chan, 39, on Twitter. Yeah, awesome.
00:37:30.476 - 00:37:37.420, Speaker A: Well, thanks again for coming on. This has been really fun and I'm really excited to do this again in 612 months and see where we are.
00:37:37.612 - 00:37:42.924, Speaker C: Great. Yeah, thanks, Jason. Yeah. Excited to see how the space has changed in another year.
