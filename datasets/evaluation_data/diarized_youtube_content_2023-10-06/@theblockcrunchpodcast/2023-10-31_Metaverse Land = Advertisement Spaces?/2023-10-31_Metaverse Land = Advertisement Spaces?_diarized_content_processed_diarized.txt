00:00:00.280 - 00:00:38.622, Speaker A: I had a phase when I was quite bullish on this, and I think the thesis was pretty clear. Right. If you create an economy in a virtual world, it makes sense that the real estate will be worth something, because the analogy I drew was basically ad space. It's very similar to, like, ad space you have on any website you visit. But it just so happens that this ad space is represented as, like, real real estate. Does it make sense for, like, different plots of land to be worth different things? I think so. In a similar way that the top banner on a website is probably going to get more higher cost per click than a bottom banner.
00:00:38.622 - 00:00:58.574, Speaker A: I think in that sense, it might make sense, but I think this thesis really has not been validated. I think the market has gone way ahead of what reality actually is. I remember when we were back at Spartan, we were testing out sandbox, for instance, and there's four dudes in the entire world that's online at the same time for a multi billion dollar metaverse.
