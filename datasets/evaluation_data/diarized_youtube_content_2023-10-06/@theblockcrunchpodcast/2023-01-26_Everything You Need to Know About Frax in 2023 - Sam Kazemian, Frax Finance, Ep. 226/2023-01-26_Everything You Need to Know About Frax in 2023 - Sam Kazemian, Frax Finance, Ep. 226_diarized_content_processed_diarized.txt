00:00:39.304 - 00:00:40.896, Speaker B: Today's episode is brought to you by.
00:00:40.920 - 00:00:54.404, Speaker A: Protocol Labs, the team behind Filecoin. And with me today is Colin Efrin from protocol Labs, who leads ecosystem there to tell us why people should choose Filecoin over alternatives. So, Colin, why should people be using Filecoin over other competitors?
00:00:55.024 - 00:01:27.904, Speaker C: Filecoin believes that web3 will only win by offering a better product at a better price point. When it comes to storage, Filecoin offers the most scale at the cheapest price, with the strong guarantees uniquely enabled by its open market of storage providers and its crypto economic incentives. Now, smart contracts on Filecoin, which launches in q one of 2023, only make this more powerful. It enables users to create perpetual storage deals to store data forever at costs that are a small fraction of centralized storage providers like s three.
00:01:28.744 - 00:01:29.368, Speaker D: Hello there.
00:01:29.416 - 00:02:02.914, Speaker A: Now, before I move on, I'd love to thank the hundreds of you who have subscribed to blockchain. Because with your support, I've been able to share my real thoughts on specific projects that I don't usually share, on interviews in a format that I enjoy more, which is bi weekly written posts. We've also been able to offer exclusive AMA's, sharing my investment frameworks, interactable models, and breaking down important trends before they become big. Now, we even had Elon Musk comment on one of our threads recently. So if you haven't already, head on over to theBlockcrench.com vip and you can access dozens of hours of research for what you'd spend on a coffee a day.
00:02:03.934 - 00:03:04.714, Speaker B: Hey, everybody, welcome back to another episode of the blockchain podcast. Now, as we're recording this, crypto markets are off to a bullish start in the new year, and one of the projects that have renewed a lot of community interest lately is fracs. Now, Frax is the only semi algorithmic stablecoin that has actually persisted its peg throughout 2020. Two's thick and thin, even as one of the largest algo stablecoins back then, UST was collapsing to zero. Now, with the new year on the horizon, Frax is an incredibly ambitious roadmap in Defi to scale adoption for its partially collateralized stablecoin fracs, its inflation packed stablecoin FPI, its ETH packed stablecoin called Frax ETH, its lending and exchange products, as well as its liquid staking derivative product, staked Frax ETH. And lately, there's been a lot of interest in liquid staking derivatives, so called lsds as well, such as projects like lido or projects like rocket pool. So we're going to talk about how Fracs compares with those two, as well as what Frax is doing in that arena at all.
00:03:04.714 - 00:04:00.974, Speaker B: So, to understand all of Frax's ambitious roadmap, how all of its products tie together in a unifying vision, I'm really excited to once again have Sam Kazemian, who is the founder of Frax, on the show. Now, in this episode, we'll go through a lot of very technical details about Frax's design, but more importantly, the rationale for how they design things and how they think as a defi protocol. I think there's a lot of interesting questions about whether a decentralized stablecoin should be relying on centralized custodians for the collateral, the trade offs that you have to make for creating a secure and stable, stable coin versus a completely decentralized stablecoin. There's a lot of nuance to this topic, and I really appreciate Sam from taking his time to come on the show to talk to us. And finally, at the end, we're also going to touch on Frax's long term roadmap about how Frax intends to scale adoption for its stablecoin. So definitely make sure you listen till the end of the entire episode. So, without further ado, here is Sam Kazemian from Frax.
00:04:00.974 - 00:04:01.906, Speaker B: Hey, Jason.
00:04:01.970 - 00:04:03.890, Speaker D: It's always a pleasure to be here.
00:04:04.082 - 00:04:13.524, Speaker B: Definitely. Now, let's kick us off with a look back to last year, because, I mean, a lot has happened last year. Um, what were the major milestones or developments for fracs in 2022?
00:04:13.904 - 00:04:21.040, Speaker E: Holy cow. Right? 2022 was definitely, like, a pretty crazy year. It started off, like, awesome in terms.
00:04:21.072 - 00:04:26.224, Speaker D: Of the crypto markets, the stock market, everything, and then somehow continued to get.
00:04:26.264 - 00:04:42.166, Speaker E: Worse and worse, even though when you thought, like, after terra, like, okay, well, that was pretty bad. It can't get worse, right? And then, you know, the bankruptcies of, like, sells these, like, all these things, like, holy crap, again, pretty bad, right? At least we're, like, kind of at the bottom. It can't get any weirder or worse, right?
00:04:42.190 - 00:04:44.406, Speaker D: And then FTX is just like, just.
00:04:44.430 - 00:04:49.550, Speaker E: Like the bad news kept coming and coming, or along with the interest rate hikes and stuff.
00:04:49.742 - 00:04:56.510, Speaker D: But the year was honestly pretty, pretty good, comparatively, for Frax, right?
00:04:56.622 - 00:05:03.390, Speaker E: Obviously, Frax was the only stable coin other than Dai on chain that didn't.
00:05:03.422 - 00:05:05.146, Speaker D: Break its peg at scale.
00:05:05.210 - 00:05:06.602, Speaker E: Basically, what I like to think of.
00:05:06.618 - 00:05:10.274, Speaker D: It is like, the stable coins above a billion supply, right?
00:05:10.314 - 00:05:10.714, Speaker E: Like, what?
00:05:10.754 - 00:05:14.434, Speaker D: The ones that at scale, what are they?
00:05:14.474 - 00:05:19.106, Speaker E: Right? And actually, the top two decentralized stable coins, other than the fiat coins is.
00:05:19.130 - 00:05:27.374, Speaker D: Dai first and then fracks. And we still have over a billion stable coin in supply. Never broke our peg, continued to build.
00:05:27.674 - 00:05:30.666, Speaker E: 2022 was pretty brutal, right? Not going to lie.
00:05:30.690 - 00:05:33.874, Speaker D: Like, all of this stuff, a lot of projects didn't make it.
00:05:33.914 - 00:05:42.262, Speaker E: A lot of, you know, real companies exchanges, all these things didn't make it in like a interest rate environment that just continues to go higher and higher.
00:05:42.318 - 00:05:42.510, Speaker A: Right?
00:05:42.542 - 00:05:43.630, Speaker E: Like, if you think about it, there's.
00:05:43.662 - 00:05:46.406, Speaker D: A lot of stuff that only exists.
00:05:46.470 - 00:05:53.750, Speaker E: In like, a zero interest environment, right? Whether it's crypto, whether it's like Silicon Valley startups that have never, you know.
00:05:53.782 - 00:06:08.374, Speaker D: Made profit or whatever, right? All of these things. And a lot of these things won't continue to exist unless rates go back to near zero. Right? But that's not how we operate. So fracs has done pretty well.
00:06:08.534 - 00:06:12.662, Speaker E: We continue to make revenue, continue to ship. Most importantly, I think we're one of.
00:06:12.678 - 00:06:13.234, Speaker D: The.
00:06:15.374 - 00:06:20.814, Speaker E: Best shippers of code and products and execution. When we say we're going to do.
00:06:20.854 - 00:06:24.414, Speaker D: Something, we do it pretty much every single time.
00:06:24.534 - 00:06:26.150, Speaker E: I don't think there's any time we.
00:06:26.262 - 00:06:29.302, Speaker D: Said we'll do something and we haven't done it.
00:06:29.478 - 00:06:31.566, Speaker E: So, yeah, 2022 was brutal, but it.
00:06:31.590 - 00:06:32.926, Speaker D: Was a pretty good year.
00:06:32.950 - 00:06:41.510, Speaker E: And so now into 2023, we have a lot of good stuff because we've shipped more and more. Towards the end of 2022, we launched.
00:06:41.542 - 00:06:53.554, Speaker D: Frax Ether, which a lot of people like to call it like a liquid staking derivative. And it might be like, technically speaking, but it's actually important to talk about.
00:06:53.934 - 00:07:07.936, Speaker E: Why we build all of these things rather than, um, looking at them as, like, standalone products. And so we launched Frax ether, and then we're also going to launch a few other stuff and continue to grow the products that we've already launched, like.
00:07:07.960 - 00:07:11.456, Speaker D: Frax lend, frac swap, and, and these kinds of things.
00:07:11.640 - 00:07:41.796, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And I'd love to kind of turn the focus on the new year as well, given that it's the beginning of 2023. Now, looking at some numbers currently, I think Fracs, the stable coin, has about a supply of a billion, 92% of which is collateralized. And Fracs ether has about 100 million staked. Fracs Lend has about 200 million in TVL FPI, the inflation pack stablecoin that you guys have has about 80 million in circulation. So all of these are big enough to not qualify as simple experiments. These are actual bonafide products with people behind them.
00:07:41.796 - 00:07:50.278, Speaker B: So in 2023, how are you splitting your focus or development efforts across these and other major initiatives that will be coming out as well?
00:07:50.476 - 00:07:52.426, Speaker D: This is a good question because the.
00:07:52.450 - 00:07:54.722, Speaker E: Way that I like to think about it and the way that were going.
00:07:54.738 - 00:07:56.826, Speaker D: To be talking about our roadmap thats.
00:07:56.850 - 00:07:58.114, Speaker E: Going to come out by the time.
00:07:58.154 - 00:08:09.258, Speaker D: This podcast is put out there is fracs build stablecoins. We build things basically as if were building stablecoins.
00:08:09.306 - 00:08:10.674, Speaker E: We like to think about it as.
00:08:10.714 - 00:08:13.282, Speaker D: If were a issuer of a currency.
00:08:13.338 - 00:08:14.810, Speaker E: Which is basically like a central bank.
00:08:14.842 - 00:08:25.282, Speaker D: And well get into how we build Frax ether that way. But everything we build is so we can issue the best stable coins we can stabilize stable coins that we build.
00:08:25.338 - 00:08:25.578, Speaker E: Right.
00:08:25.626 - 00:08:33.538, Speaker D: If you think about it, frax is a dollar pegged stablecoin. FPI is a CPI pegged stablecoin. Frax ether is a stablecoin peg.
00:08:33.586 - 00:08:34.322, Speaker E: Two, one.
00:08:34.378 - 00:08:46.002, Speaker D: Ether. And the way that we build the mechanisms and the way that we think about these things is not a standalone product that requires different kinds of attention.
00:08:46.098 - 00:08:50.066, Speaker E: And like, we don't have silos in like, frags.
00:08:50.090 - 00:08:54.290, Speaker D: Frags is actually pretty lean and fast moving organization.
00:08:54.362 - 00:08:55.266, Speaker E: There's only eight of us.
00:08:55.290 - 00:09:09.010, Speaker D: All of us are engineers. We build all of the stuff that we're talking about. It's built by eight people. So literally all of this stuff is built by eight people. The reason it can be done that.
00:09:09.042 - 00:09:11.066, Speaker E: Way is obviously like, we work around.
00:09:11.090 - 00:09:19.418, Speaker D: The clock all the time. But still, it's that we don't have a disjoint, uh, framework. We have a very, very clear roadmap.
00:09:19.466 - 00:09:20.674, Speaker E: And like a very clear vision.
00:09:20.714 - 00:09:26.482, Speaker D: We build stuff that allows us to build the best stable coins, the best stable coins, whether they're pegged to ether.
00:09:26.578 - 00:09:28.626, Speaker E: Uh, to CPI, to the dollar, to.
00:09:28.650 - 00:09:29.250, Speaker D: Any of these things.
00:09:29.282 - 00:09:32.178, Speaker E: So that's how we think about it. So it's not like, you know, fracs.
00:09:32.226 - 00:09:36.818, Speaker D: Lend is just this kind of island of like a lending market that's like.
00:09:36.866 - 00:09:39.482, Speaker E: Supposed to compete with aave or something like that.
00:09:39.538 - 00:09:42.366, Speaker D: If it was, we would, we would like tokenize it, right?
00:09:42.390 - 00:09:50.230, Speaker E: Like we would just. There'd be like a fraxlin token or something. There'd be like a frac swap token. There'd be like a fracs, uh, ether token.
00:09:50.342 - 00:09:54.206, Speaker D: There'd be, there'd be a like frax BTc token.
00:09:54.230 - 00:09:56.214, Speaker E: In fact, we'll, we're looking into issuing.
00:09:56.254 - 00:09:58.574, Speaker D: A BTC pegged stable coin.
00:09:58.654 - 00:10:00.158, Speaker E: Um, and so that's going to come.
00:10:00.206 - 00:10:03.758, Speaker D: In around q two as part of our roadmap.
00:10:03.886 - 00:10:08.224, Speaker E: And, um, they're not siloed. They're not siloed, they're not anything like that.
00:10:08.264 - 00:10:18.924, Speaker D: The fracs DAO issues, stablecoins. And there's a very unique way of thinking about the world if you're a stablecoin issuer. And that's essentially how we design everything.
00:10:19.344 - 00:10:29.524, Speaker B: So all of these products are basically shouldn't be thought of as independent products. They should be thought of like a part of the mechanism that allows for these stable coins to be issued.
00:10:30.344 - 00:10:31.376, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly.
00:10:31.440 - 00:10:32.748, Speaker E: That's exactly correct.
00:10:32.936 - 00:10:35.564, Speaker D: If you think about how stablecoins work, right?
00:10:35.604 - 00:10:53.228, Speaker E: They need a lending market, right? They need like a credit facility. Like if you think of how DAi is generated with on chain debt, they need a swap facility or ways to rebalance collateral, whether it's through amm. We use curve and we use frac swap. Frac swap we use, because it has t wms, right, which is it allows.
00:10:53.276 - 00:11:19.454, Speaker D: Large liquidity to balance across time curve. Obviously, it's deep stable swap liquidity, right? Pegged assets. And so everything we do is built so we can issue better and better stablecoins without having to rely on, for example, like our stablecoin being listed on compound or on aave and stuff, and being able to build these kinds of things you need for issuing currency internally.
00:11:20.034 - 00:11:56.038, Speaker B: And this is actually a question I wanted to ask later once we get at the community question portion, but I thought it's a good time to bring it up now. So, given that there are lending markets for fracs right now, is there a risk that, you know, you have one large actor that just borrows a lot of fracs and, you know, push the fracs price down to 90? And just to give some context for, for, for listeners, basically, right now, uh, if you have a frac stable coin, you can redeem with fracs. Uh, I think you get like ninety cents of USDC, but the protocol means $0.10 worth of FXS tokens. So I think one of our listeners asked, is this open to the similar risk that face some other kind of algorithmic stable coins? Especially with lending available.
00:11:56.126 - 00:12:00.640, Speaker D: Now it's a good time to talk about the fracs part of the roadmap.
00:12:00.792 - 00:12:03.696, Speaker E: One thing we're changing about the fracs.
00:12:03.760 - 00:12:06.024, Speaker D: Stablecoin is this year.
00:12:06.144 - 00:12:10.592, Speaker E: So right now, the collateral ratio is 93, give or take. So 90, 93 is fairly close.
00:12:10.648 - 00:12:14.400, Speaker D: The rest is 70%, is fxs and.
00:12:14.472 - 00:12:18.616, Speaker E: Volatile assets and stuff. We're actually changing fracs entirely, 100% cr.
00:12:18.680 - 00:12:23.180, Speaker D: Two exogenous collateral, fairly safe collateral.
00:12:23.212 - 00:12:27.196, Speaker E: In fact, you might have heard that one of the things were working towards.
00:12:27.260 - 00:12:30.212, Speaker D: Doing is getting a fed master account.
00:12:30.268 - 00:12:32.532, Speaker E: Or an actual way to get either.
00:12:32.668 - 00:12:37.788, Speaker D: Direct deposits at the Federal Reserve system or treasury to bills in an isolated.
00:12:37.836 - 00:12:45.508, Speaker E: Account similar to paxos. A little bit like circle, slight differences, but we have our own, basically isolated.
00:12:45.636 - 00:13:01.620, Speaker D: Secret sauce, so to speak. Fracs will not be at any CR different than 100% above or below. So we're actually increasing the CR to 100%. It still makes it the most capital efficient, stable coin, if you think about it.
00:13:01.652 - 00:13:03.396, Speaker E: DAI is 130% cr, right?
00:13:03.420 - 00:13:06.624, Speaker D: So for to mint every single DAI.
00:13:07.004 - 00:13:09.748, Speaker E: On average, the reported CR is 130.
00:13:09.796 - 00:13:09.980, Speaker A: Right?
00:13:10.012 - 00:13:13.964, Speaker D: So you need about $1.30 of collateral.
00:13:14.004 - 00:13:17.002, Speaker E: Like ethereum or other kinds of things they accept as loans, right?
00:13:17.108 - 00:13:21.670, Speaker D: And so if Brax is 100% cr, it is actually the most capital efficient.
00:13:21.742 - 00:13:24.470, Speaker E: Centralized stablecoin, because our amos and stuff.
00:13:24.502 - 00:13:31.014, Speaker D: Will keep the CR always balanced at 100, not below, not over. So it is still the most capital.
00:13:31.054 - 00:13:32.878, Speaker E: Efficient, but it will be 100%.
00:13:32.926 - 00:13:46.414, Speaker B: Craig, actually, on that point, if you guys are backing fracs with treasuries or deposits as well, does that introduce a vector of centralization? There must be someone controlling the bank account, or maybe it's you guys running the bank account.
00:13:47.434 - 00:14:00.130, Speaker D: Yeah. So two things. This actually gets into theory as well as practice, right? Like the bank account and these kinds of things. So my take, and I think this is the adult take, and I think.
00:14:00.162 - 00:14:04.602, Speaker E: It'S easy for people on Twitter or, like, other things that everyone always has opinions.
00:14:04.658 - 00:14:10.578, Speaker D: But like I said, we build the best types of stable coins. And so for the dollar peg, stable.
00:14:10.626 - 00:14:22.954, Speaker E: Coins, the fact of the matter is, and again, I would love to debate anyone. I would love to talk to anyone, I would love to, in good respect, have a serious debate.
00:14:22.994 - 00:14:29.970, Speaker D: But any way that I look at it, it's impossible to peg a dollar stable coin at scale if your goal.
00:14:30.002 - 00:14:31.626, Speaker E: Is to get to hundreds of billions.
00:14:31.650 - 00:14:34.266, Speaker D: If not trillions of market cap.
00:14:34.410 - 00:14:38.836, Speaker E: In all seriousness, in the next five to ten years, without having at least.
00:14:38.900 - 00:14:44.140, Speaker D: One, one single real world asset, and that's their deposits of the Fed debt.
00:14:44.172 - 00:14:54.052, Speaker E: Of the US government or just wrapping another fiat coin that has those things. And so we don't want to wrap another fiat. We don't want to be something where.
00:14:54.148 - 00:15:05.952, Speaker D: The closest thing we can get to off chain is essentially by having to entirely rely. We might still have a large amount.
00:15:05.968 - 00:15:07.440, Speaker E: Of fiat coins and on chain swap.
00:15:07.472 - 00:15:13.928, Speaker D: Facilities like curve and deep liquidity and in these kinds of places, but we don't want that as our only option.
00:15:13.976 - 00:15:18.176, Speaker E: That is not how fracs can end up becoming in the next five to.
00:15:18.200 - 00:15:29.816, Speaker D: Ten years, in the hundreds of trillions, if not hundreds of billions, if not billions. Right? And so really, that's the only way you can. You can actually be the top 1st.
00:15:29.880 - 00:15:32.484, Speaker E: 2Nd, 3rd rank, uh, dollar peg, stable coin.
00:15:32.524 - 00:15:34.276, Speaker D: I'm willing to talk to anyone to.
00:15:34.380 - 00:15:36.140, Speaker E: Uh, and debate them if they have any.
00:15:36.212 - 00:15:37.060, Speaker D: Any views on this.
00:15:37.092 - 00:15:41.244, Speaker E: But as. As one of the. Like I said, we do research on.
00:15:41.284 - 00:15:43.212, Speaker D: Building the best types of stable coins.
00:15:43.348 - 00:15:46.364, Speaker E: Uh, no matter how we do them. In fact, when we talk about frac.
00:15:46.404 - 00:15:48.436, Speaker D: Ether, it'll be important because there's.
00:15:48.460 - 00:15:50.572, Speaker E: There's analogs to this, right, which is.
00:15:50.748 - 00:15:59.524, Speaker D: You always need whatever you're going to pick to. If you're trying to be the, uh, largest issuer of currency, either in.
00:15:59.564 - 00:16:01.636, Speaker E: In, like, the digital realm, which is.
00:16:01.660 - 00:16:16.548, Speaker D: Stable coins, or in the real world or whatever, you need to become the closest thing to the risk free assets, okay? Right now, that risk free asset is like USDC on chain, okay?
00:16:16.596 - 00:16:16.756, Speaker B: That.
00:16:16.780 - 00:16:21.356, Speaker D: That risk free asset is USDC. People like to talk on Twitter.
00:16:21.420 - 00:16:24.244, Speaker E: How will they. What if they, you know, black this blah, blah?
00:16:24.404 - 00:16:26.172, Speaker D: And it is true. It's not.
00:16:26.188 - 00:16:26.644, Speaker E: It's.
00:16:26.684 - 00:16:32.882, Speaker D: It's not wrong to worry about it and we should worry about it, but no one ever comes up with anything.
00:16:32.938 - 00:16:39.066, Speaker E: They say, oh, look at. Look at LUSD, which has, like, a fraction of. A fraction of a fraction of the.
00:16:39.090 - 00:16:42.026, Speaker D: Market cap of like, dai and fraxed.
00:16:42.130 - 00:16:48.210, Speaker E: And things like that. Or look at this random, decentralized, like, cute peg of something.
00:16:48.362 - 00:16:53.810, Speaker D: If there's no actual data, there's no actual thing.
00:16:53.882 - 00:17:02.618, Speaker E: Unless there's some kind of super secret, uh, stability mechanism that has never been invented, uh, and some kind of new crypto, you know, way of doing things.
00:17:02.666 - 00:17:05.610, Speaker D: Which we're exploring certain things, but like.
00:17:05.642 - 00:17:12.730, Speaker E: Like the. The bam. The bam stuff that. That we're talking about. And maybe we'll have time to, uh, talk about that.
00:17:12.762 - 00:17:18.530, Speaker D: Lowers the exposure, but it's not possible. Has actually came up with, like, a.
00:17:18.642 - 00:17:20.226, Speaker E: Real way to defeat the. This.
00:17:20.290 - 00:17:21.714, Speaker D: The famous stablecoin trilem.
00:17:21.754 - 00:17:21.906, Speaker A: Right?
00:17:21.930 - 00:17:28.633, Speaker E: I think we kind of talked about it on the last time, uh, I was on, uh, blood crunch. Or maybe I also talked about it.
00:17:28.673 - 00:17:30.721, Speaker D: A few other times that there's just no way.
00:17:30.777 - 00:17:35.361, Speaker E: And so we're not going to at least not know yet. I'm not saying there's, like, mathematically impossible.
00:17:35.417 - 00:17:37.881, Speaker D: But no one has come up with a good solution.
00:17:37.977 - 00:17:42.953, Speaker E: Everyone likes to complain about, you know, fiat coin, uh, exposure, and, and, and.
00:17:42.993 - 00:17:47.001, Speaker D: They'Re right, but they still continue to use USDC because you.
00:17:47.017 - 00:17:49.545, Speaker E: You can't use something like LUSD at scale, right?
00:17:49.569 - 00:17:54.392, Speaker D: It's. It's wobbly to a couple cents. It also uses Chainlink Orable.
00:17:54.448 - 00:17:59.320, Speaker E: So it's like, oh, it's really like decentralized, sure. But, like, it only uses ETH, but.
00:17:59.432 - 00:18:01.048, Speaker D: It still uses chainlink orable.
00:18:01.096 - 00:18:01.616, Speaker E: So, like, if.
00:18:01.640 - 00:18:04.608, Speaker D: If we didn't use USDC, people would.
00:18:04.696 - 00:18:07.280, Speaker E: Be saying stuff about the chainlink Oracle. Right?
00:18:07.392 - 00:18:10.200, Speaker D: Or like, if LUSD actually could be.
00:18:10.272 - 00:18:15.296, Speaker E: Larger in market cap rather than 100 million or something, it would be even more unstable.
00:18:15.360 - 00:18:15.632, Speaker A: Right?
00:18:15.688 - 00:18:18.070, Speaker D: It's a couple cents off and on peg.
00:18:18.142 - 00:18:20.830, Speaker E: It's wobbly. Two plus minus couple cents.
00:18:20.862 - 00:18:26.582, Speaker D: Right? There's other stuff, too. The thing is, there's just no way.
00:18:26.718 - 00:18:30.518, Speaker E: To get to the major leagues in.
00:18:30.526 - 00:18:35.086, Speaker D: Terms of size without having at least r1 world asset.
00:18:35.110 - 00:18:36.142, Speaker E: And so what I actually like to.
00:18:36.158 - 00:18:38.634, Speaker D: Talk about is the opposite direction.
00:18:39.294 - 00:18:40.950, Speaker E: If real world assets are like a.
00:18:40.982 - 00:18:48.494, Speaker D: Big thing, does it make sense to have a stable coin that has many.
00:18:48.654 - 00:18:50.910, Speaker E: Real world assets, like the way that.
00:18:50.942 - 00:18:55.726, Speaker D: Makerdao is going, or only have r1 world asset?
00:18:55.750 - 00:18:58.598, Speaker E: And so I think that's actually another interesting conversation.
00:18:58.766 - 00:19:00.542, Speaker D: Frax is taking the other approach.
00:19:00.678 - 00:19:08.446, Speaker E: We're not actually. Originally we were thinking of exploring a lot of these different real world assets, like Tesla loans, different lending to different banks and all this stuff.
00:19:08.510 - 00:19:10.094, Speaker D: Totally not doing that anymore.
00:19:10.174 - 00:19:12.534, Speaker E: This is not the avenue that we're going towards.
00:19:12.654 - 00:19:28.030, Speaker D: We just want r1 world asset. That r1 world asset is deposits on the Fed's ledge. That's the only real world asset. Everything else, we're going to be entirely on chain.
00:19:28.182 - 00:19:32.814, Speaker E: Entirely our Amos, that algorithmic market operation.
00:19:32.894 - 00:19:37.174, Speaker D: Contracts then manage liquidity on is like curve, uniswap, etcetera.
00:19:37.334 - 00:19:40.830, Speaker E: Also changed the lending liquidity on Frax lend.
00:19:40.902 - 00:19:42.806, Speaker D: So they mint fracs to be borrowed.
00:19:42.830 - 00:19:44.878, Speaker E: In certain pairs that pass governance boats.
00:19:44.926 - 00:19:51.902, Speaker D: Very similar to makerdao CDP system, increasing and decreasing the lending ceiling. What's more important, I think, is actually.
00:19:51.958 - 00:19:56.598, Speaker E: Talking about the philosophy and the idea of why are you taking the r1.
00:19:56.646 - 00:19:59.910, Speaker D: World asset view rather than the multi real world asset.
00:19:59.942 - 00:20:02.750, Speaker E: And so for that, actually, as we.
00:20:02.782 - 00:20:16.044, Speaker D: Thought more and more about it, if you think about making loans to private entities, which is the real thing is of real world asset, it means lend.
00:20:16.084 - 00:20:21.460, Speaker E: To a bunch of random stuff, right? And I don't mean random isn't bad. I mean private banks, private businesses.
00:20:21.492 - 00:20:21.660, Speaker B: Sure.
00:20:21.692 - 00:20:24.980, Speaker D: There's a lot of private businesses that are very safe, right?
00:20:25.012 - 00:20:29.956, Speaker E: Like Apple, Microsoft. There's really not a lot of chance that Apple is going to default on.
00:20:29.980 - 00:20:57.564, Speaker D: Instead or something, right? But the thing is, if you think about what entity's job there is to lend to these things, it's the private sector. They're commercial banks. Notice how central banks don't lend directly to Apple, to Tesla, to these kind of things, right? They create the money, right? And then they give it to commercial banks.
00:20:57.604 - 00:21:00.076, Speaker E: They technically, they lend it with reverse.
00:21:00.100 - 00:21:02.058, Speaker D: Repo agreements or they actually just, you.
00:21:02.066 - 00:21:05.570, Speaker E: Know, all of the stuff that's out of scope to talk about here, right?
00:21:05.602 - 00:21:17.794, Speaker D: And then the banks actually go and lend it to Tesla, Apple and all of these like mortgages and these kinds of things. We don't want to be the commercial bank. We don't want fracs to be in.
00:21:17.834 - 00:21:21.482, Speaker E: Place of the commercial bank. We want to actually be the closest.
00:21:21.538 - 00:21:32.756, Speaker D: Thing to the central bank of Defi. Of the digital economy, right? The thing is, when everything bad happens.
00:21:32.780 - 00:21:36.784, Speaker E: Like, right when there's a crisis there, when there's like a liquidity crunch, right.
00:21:37.444 - 00:21:51.908, Speaker D: Everyone flees to the risk free asset or the closest thing to the risk free asset. This is just a fact, right? This is an economic fact. On chain. What is that? That's USDC, right?
00:21:51.956 - 00:21:54.516, Speaker E: Like we call it Spada spades.
00:21:54.540 - 00:21:59.624, Speaker D: It's USDC, right? It's not fracs yet. It's not dai.
00:21:59.704 - 00:22:02.048, Speaker E: It's not like tether, it's USDC.
00:22:02.096 - 00:22:06.504, Speaker D: Currently, the general consensus is that it's USDC and they've done a great job.
00:22:06.544 - 00:22:09.928, Speaker E: And recently they have Blackrock managing all.
00:22:09.936 - 00:22:14.280, Speaker D: Of their treasury assets in a money market fund that is only accessible to.
00:22:14.312 - 00:22:17.016, Speaker E: Them, that buys reverse repo agreements from.
00:22:17.040 - 00:22:22.744, Speaker D: The New York Fed's trading desk. It's a very good operation. That is the risk free thing other.
00:22:22.784 - 00:22:24.856, Speaker E: Than the issue with the blacklist and.
00:22:24.880 - 00:22:44.376, Speaker D: Stuff, which we should talk about. Not at all denying any of that, right? But you're always going to end up wrapping the closest thing to the risk free asset. There is no. At scale. There's no exception. There's no exception.
00:22:44.520 - 00:22:49.816, Speaker E: If you end up doing some of these riskier loans that can default like.
00:22:49.920 - 00:22:52.380, Speaker D: The can default but likely, probably won't.
00:22:52.412 - 00:22:57.564, Speaker E: But you never know. Tesla to these other banks and stuff like the makers doing, which is awesome.
00:22:57.604 - 00:22:58.780, Speaker D: They're more profitable, right?
00:22:58.812 - 00:23:08.664, Speaker E: Risk adjusted. That's why you get a higher interest rate than the risk free rate at the Fed on the interest, on reserve balances or reverse repos.
00:23:08.964 - 00:23:20.716, Speaker D: But everyone will flee to the closest thing to the risk free asset. Worst amount of, or you as the.
00:23:20.740 - 00:23:23.012, Speaker E: Riskier stablecoin issuer like Dai, and currently.
00:23:23.068 - 00:23:32.860, Speaker D: Like fracks, you end up having to wrap the closest thing to the risk reasset. That's just a fact. And so we don't try to deny.
00:23:32.892 - 00:23:35.412, Speaker E: It, we don't try to market our way out of it.
00:23:35.428 - 00:23:52.584, Speaker D: We try to solve it in a very unique thing too, that we think that no one else is doing. And so we have some stuff we're working on. Like I said, we take a r1 world asset approach. The r1 world asset again is deposits.
00:23:52.624 - 00:23:54.760, Speaker E: At the Fed or reverse repo.
00:23:54.792 - 00:23:58.804, Speaker D: Fed is the only counterparty or close to it circles pretty close, actually.
00:24:00.664 - 00:24:03.192, Speaker E: We're not going to loan to renewable.
00:24:03.248 - 00:24:10.844, Speaker D: Energy or whatever, or some other banks and stuff. It's too difficult to assess that risk. That's what a commercial bank does.
00:24:11.144 - 00:24:12.684, Speaker E: We're not interested.
00:24:12.928 - 00:24:15.656, Speaker D: And being in a commercial bank, stable.
00:24:15.800 - 00:24:17.844, Speaker B: That'S what maker is trying to do, I suppose.
00:24:18.264 - 00:24:30.044, Speaker D: I think so. And it's, let me be frank, it's profitable. You take higher risk and you get higher yield, so there's nothing wrong with it.
00:24:30.544 - 00:24:32.592, Speaker E: And makers doing a good job at.
00:24:32.648 - 00:24:35.564, Speaker D: Doing that thing, we're not going to compete with them.
00:24:36.224 - 00:24:39.256, Speaker E: We're not going to try to lend.
00:24:39.360 - 00:24:41.374, Speaker D: To real world assets that, so like.
00:24:41.414 - 00:24:43.030, Speaker E: Then they can be like, well, makers.
00:24:43.102 - 00:24:44.926, Speaker D: Giving us die at like, you know.
00:24:44.950 - 00:24:46.582, Speaker E: Like 5%, can you give it to.
00:24:46.598 - 00:24:52.222, Speaker D: Us at 4%, uh, fracs and stuff? We're not going to get into that at all, but it's not something we're interested.
00:24:52.318 - 00:25:12.226, Speaker B: Does that mean the end state for fracs will, you know, look more like, you know, a circle or paxos where you have, you know, licensed agreements with all these banks and custodians? Or is that kind of, uh. Or I guess from what you're saying, it sounds like you will be the decentralized central bank that interacts with entities like that versus becoming an entity like that one entity.
00:25:12.410 - 00:25:17.506, Speaker D: The goal is very, very simple way for the Frax dao to.
00:25:17.650 - 00:25:22.138, Speaker E: Again, we're trying to keep it very, very clean in terms of the vision.
00:25:22.186 - 00:25:32.826, Speaker D: Here, which is where we'll be wanting to see the Frax dao, there will only be one thing off of the blockchain or the FXS token holders and.
00:25:32.890 - 00:25:35.738, Speaker E: The governance votes and stuff to actually.
00:25:35.906 - 00:25:44.402, Speaker D: Manage its r1 world asset relationship, not 50 counterparties. In fact, thats one of the main issues. One of the main issues is that.
00:25:44.578 - 00:25:46.642, Speaker E: The current way that the traditional financial.
00:25:46.738 - 00:25:57.922, Speaker D: System works is that you almost literally legally have to go through ten middlemen. Legally you cant have an account of the Fed.
00:25:57.978 - 00:26:29.716, Speaker E: Trust me, we understand how impossible, uh, it might sound to get the fed master account or some kind of repo facility or something like that. But you need to go through, you need to either be like a sec registered money market fund, uh, you need to be either like a systemically important bank, uh, to be like a counterparty there. And then you need to either. If you, if you don't do that right, then if your first counterparty is one of those things, right, then you have like a broker that, then if you have t bills like, then they.
00:26:29.740 - 00:26:30.716, Speaker D: Hold your t bills too.
00:26:30.740 - 00:26:37.292, Speaker E: And then you're like well let's have a trust. And so it's like creditor protected in case like one of these things goes bankrupt or something.
00:26:37.348 - 00:26:39.548, Speaker D: So that you hold the assets for.
00:26:39.596 - 00:26:42.068, Speaker E: Your users, which are the stable coin.
00:26:42.116 - 00:26:43.692, Speaker D: But now there's a third layer, fine.
00:26:43.708 - 00:26:50.524, Speaker E: It protects it from two at the bottom. Now you interact with trustees, like you're saying the token holders are talking to trustees, I guess, or whatever, I don't know.
00:26:50.564 - 00:26:50.908, Speaker D: Right.
00:26:50.996 - 00:26:52.716, Speaker E: And so then there's like the layer.
00:26:52.740 - 00:27:03.888, Speaker D: Above that, and then we want to just have the whole stack. Simple. That's going to be the goal for this year. That's on the roadmap for 2023.
00:27:04.056 - 00:27:34.974, Speaker B: And speaking of roadmap, I think we can go on and on with the stablecoin part of things, because there's a lot of big topics that we can discuss, and I do think it's the most important vertical in crypto. But I think we do have to move on to liquid staking, because that's something that a lot of people are talking about today, especially with the recent price moves in all of these liquid staking protocols. So one of the things that people are really excited about is Frax ETH. So just to give some context to listeners, what is Frax ETH and how does it work?
00:27:35.434 - 00:27:58.962, Speaker D: Yeah, so frax ETH is an ethereum pegged stablecoin. So one frax ETH, frx ETH is pegged to the price of one ethanol. It does not accrue rewards, it does not accrue any interest. It's just an ethereum pegged stablecoin, and it's always backed by at least one ETH.
00:27:59.018 - 00:28:04.026, Speaker E: So there's no like weird thing mechanism or it just is always just backed.
00:28:04.050 - 00:28:07.666, Speaker D: By at least one. Now, why did we do this?
00:28:07.690 - 00:28:09.370, Speaker E: And why did we build it like this?
00:28:09.442 - 00:28:19.372, Speaker D: There's a second token called staked frax ether, which when you mint your frax ether stablecoins, by depositing one ETH, you get one frax ether stablecoin out.
00:28:19.468 - 00:28:25.420, Speaker E: You can go and deposit your ETH stablecoin in the staked frax ether vault.
00:28:25.452 - 00:28:32.252, Speaker D: And you get out s frax ETH tokens. And those are the things that they're interest bearing.
00:28:32.348 - 00:28:34.876, Speaker E: Those get all of the rewards of.
00:28:35.020 - 00:28:38.064, Speaker D: The proof of stake validators that currently.
00:28:38.484 - 00:28:43.412, Speaker E: Run by the Fracz team. We have a roadmap to decentralize those. Kind of similar to rocket pool, but.
00:28:43.428 - 00:28:45.194, Speaker D: A little bit different mechanism.
00:28:46.374 - 00:28:47.982, Speaker E: It's going to be out a little.
00:28:47.998 - 00:29:02.334, Speaker D: Bit after Shanghai, but the economic innovation here is building this out like a stable one. So the frax ETH token does not accrue any interest when you mint it. Then you can decide what to do with it. As more and more places end up.
00:29:02.374 - 00:29:05.206, Speaker E: Having integration with frack seeth that maybe.
00:29:05.230 - 00:29:07.014, Speaker D: They'Ll replace wheat with it, for example.
00:29:07.054 - 00:29:11.886, Speaker E: Or maybe there'll just be like curve pools and things like that. We obviously launch with a pretty big.
00:29:11.910 - 00:29:13.806, Speaker D: Curve pool that we support, just like.
00:29:13.830 - 00:29:16.278, Speaker E: How fracs is everywhere on curve and.
00:29:16.406 - 00:29:19.838, Speaker D: On stable swaps and these things. So then you can decide.
00:29:19.886 - 00:29:21.278, Speaker E: You stake it in curve for like.
00:29:21.326 - 00:29:26.718, Speaker D: About a 10% apr, or do you stake it in the pos world? It's almost the same risk free, right?
00:29:26.806 - 00:29:31.318, Speaker E: Like the Pos vault, it's still just the PoS rewards, right?
00:29:31.406 - 00:29:34.270, Speaker D: Curve, minimal smart contract risk as blue.
00:29:34.302 - 00:29:36.374, Speaker E: Chip as it can possibly be, right?
00:29:36.454 - 00:29:41.360, Speaker D: Frax ETH paired with ETH, no il, right? Like, basically it's pegged to the same thing.
00:29:41.542 - 00:29:45.940, Speaker E: No risk there. It's almost the same as the risk free rate. What happens is the interest rates get arc, right?
00:29:45.972 - 00:30:08.034, Speaker D: You have to decide where to deposit your ETH stable point. And what happens is the actual vault acts as essentially the risk free rate of the fed, right? Like, if we're the issuers of this, this fraxed stablecoin. So it's similar to dollars, right? The risk free rate that we offer is in the Pos vault.
00:30:08.164 - 00:30:14.190, Speaker E: Whatever is the proof of stake rewards, they all get distributed to the POS.
00:30:14.262 - 00:30:21.662, Speaker D: Vault minus a small fee for the protocol. Then when you have your frac seed stablecoin, you can decide, do I want.
00:30:21.678 - 00:30:34.654, Speaker E: The risk free rate, which is the POS reward yield, or do I want somewhere like curved? There's places in balancer that are starting to integrate it. There's other amms, there's other projects that are starting to integrate.
00:30:34.694 - 00:30:37.534, Speaker D: In fact, there's polygon projects and stuff.
00:30:37.874 - 00:30:40.738, Speaker E: Are starting to integrate it. So there's going to be a fraxy.
00:30:40.866 - 00:30:46.186, Speaker D: Way to bring it up to Polygon soon, right? Using the ferry system that we've deployed.
00:30:46.210 - 00:30:47.762, Speaker E: As well in 2022.
00:30:47.898 - 00:31:06.318, Speaker D: And the idea here is the stablecoin is the thing that's pegged to one ether, and that is basically the actual money. The unit, the thing we are trying to get people to replace, we've, with.
00:31:06.486 - 00:31:12.630, Speaker E: That, we're trying to get amms to use Frac ether, and we're trying to.
00:31:12.662 - 00:31:22.230, Speaker D: Basically change the unit of accounting everywhere to Frac ether. And we have extra incentives and these kinds of things.
00:31:22.262 - 00:31:30.182, Speaker E: In fact, there's going to be a Frax ether base pool system, which anyone that actually pairs with Frax ether, the same kind of thing we have for.
00:31:30.198 - 00:31:46.532, Speaker D: Frax BP, they get a part of the incentives. It's almost like a proportional interest rate, right? That's proportional to how much you're using the Fraxie stablecoin. Same idea we have, the Frax BP, which is the dollar pegged stablecoin system.
00:31:46.588 - 00:31:47.372, Speaker E: Like that. Right?
00:31:47.468 - 00:31:49.904, Speaker D: And this is pretty powerful, if you think about it.
00:31:50.524 - 00:31:54.716, Speaker E: What is the measure of use of.
00:31:54.740 - 00:32:17.460, Speaker D: A currency by an issuer, right? The actual measure of use is how much spot demand do people actually have for your currency? What that means is how much do they have in their wallet holding it as a spot, right? They're. They're not expecting you to give some amount of interest rate for you to.
00:32:17.492 - 00:32:18.676, Speaker E: Hold that thing, right?
00:32:18.780 - 00:32:27.372, Speaker D: And so just like, for example, USDC, they don't incentivize anything, right? They literally don't incentivize anything. People hold it, they use it for.
00:32:27.468 - 00:32:30.044, Speaker E: Payments, and they use it for paying salaries of treasury.
00:32:30.084 - 00:32:42.388, Speaker D: They use it for investments, all these things. You have to be able to create a project where eventually that happens with your issued liability, right? That's the ultimate final way.
00:32:42.516 - 00:32:49.020, Speaker E: Uh, any of this stuff, whether it's. It's Steve, whether it's frac seith, whether it's all of these things, that's going to be the.
00:32:49.092 - 00:33:18.406, Speaker D: The, you know, LSD that wins. I like to call it an ETH pack sibling. Now, you can see why we separated. We need at least one token where eventually holding it will give you 0% interest so people can actually hold it spot. So all of the LSD's that essentially pay an interest rate because they're essentially a yield product, they will never be able to benefit from spot demand.
00:33:18.530 - 00:33:23.342, Speaker E: Anyone that holds their, their actual like Steve WReath and all these things that.
00:33:23.358 - 00:33:23.998, Speaker D: I love the project.
00:33:24.046 - 00:33:27.294, Speaker E: So we're obviously going to have a lot of pools with them.
00:33:27.374 - 00:33:29.974, Speaker D: The more yield, the better for all of our growth, right?
00:33:30.014 - 00:33:31.710, Speaker E: So you know, better than anyone, I'm.
00:33:31.742 - 00:33:42.142, Speaker D: A very positive sum person in terms of like the best thing is everyone growing together and wealth being created rather than trying to lower people's market share, right?
00:33:42.238 - 00:33:43.654, Speaker E: You know, the main thing that we.
00:33:43.694 - 00:33:48.064, Speaker D: Always think about is how can we grow and how can everyone else grow.
00:33:48.484 - 00:33:51.180, Speaker E: Rather than how can we increase the.
00:33:51.212 - 00:33:58.084, Speaker D: Distance between us by pushing people down. We want to push everyone up. But the issue is, and I think.
00:33:58.244 - 00:34:01.268, Speaker E: It'S an easy fix, they just have to think about it like a stable.
00:34:01.316 - 00:34:22.983, Speaker D: Coin issue or what the issue is they can't get any organic demand for every single steed someone holds Lido is forced to pay them the exact same rebasing rewards, right. That no organic demand for Steve benefits Lido, right.
00:34:23.063 - 00:34:24.335, Speaker E: If you think about, if you put.
00:34:24.359 - 00:34:33.375, Speaker D: This thought experiment in your mind, but with frax ETH, that's not true. There's two tokens. The staked Frax ETH volt token, which.
00:34:33.399 - 00:34:39.463, Speaker E: Is the one that's accruing interest at the risk free rate from the Pos rewards that get sent there.
00:34:39.583 - 00:34:45.143, Speaker D: And then there is this other one that has 0% interest. If you just hold Frax ETH, right.
00:34:45.183 - 00:34:51.719, Speaker E: You'Re using it to send ETH to people or you're using it to market make in an ammper or something like.
00:34:51.751 - 00:34:57.791, Speaker D: That, you earn 0%. Although now obviously for a long time.
00:34:57.847 - 00:35:02.503, Speaker E: For a couple years, I assume you'll earn something because we have to jumpstart.
00:35:02.543 - 00:35:04.935, Speaker D: The whole ecosystem for at least two.
00:35:04.999 - 00:35:08.912, Speaker E: Three, maybe three and a half, you know, some who know, we'll take a.
00:35:08.928 - 00:35:23.200, Speaker D: Look at four years holding the frac ETH. One will also obviously have a bunch of incentives. But eventually, if it's going to be used as money, it needs to actually be used with, with getting paid 0% interest.
00:35:23.272 - 00:35:28.000, Speaker E: Otherwise there's, there's no, there's no demand, right? Like if imagine people can think about.
00:35:28.032 - 00:35:37.922, Speaker D: This much easier with dollar peg, stable coins, right? You'll see that only USDC and tether and dai dai has a very good spot demand.
00:35:37.978 - 00:35:41.170, Speaker E: Actually fracs is starting to finally get it too but with, you know, with.
00:35:41.202 - 00:35:42.474, Speaker D: All the blood, sweat and tears of.
00:35:42.514 - 00:35:43.290, Speaker E: Work that we've done.
00:35:43.322 - 00:35:51.490, Speaker D: But like, no one holds any stable coins spot other than the extremely established ones.
00:35:51.522 - 00:36:01.474, Speaker E: They're either trying to get some yield on it or dumping it after getting a loan. Right. They're, they're selling it immediately into, into the market, which might lower the peg, right?
00:36:01.934 - 00:36:05.070, Speaker D: But USDC die a little bit.
00:36:05.102 - 00:36:05.406, Speaker E: Fracs.
00:36:05.430 - 00:36:27.046, Speaker D: Fracs is slowly getting up there. But USDC and Thai on chain, they have a lot of organic spot demand, which is just another way of saying people hold it idle and they use it as payments and they don't expect to get paid an interest rate. They're getting paid 0% on it by the issuer. That is, that is the only way.
00:36:27.070 - 00:36:28.198, Speaker E: To measure organic demand.
00:36:28.246 - 00:36:30.272, Speaker D: So that, that's actually what led us.
00:36:30.288 - 00:36:33.896, Speaker E: To the design of fraxieth and why we, we think about it like an.
00:36:33.920 - 00:36:41.312, Speaker D: ETH stable coin, why we built it like that. And lo and behold, we are the fastest growing, you know, LSD, if you.
00:36:41.328 - 00:36:51.160, Speaker E: Want to call it that, in that category. I mean, it's, we're just, you know, like, obviously it'll be harder and harder to grow as we get to, like lido size or close to it or something like that. Right?
00:36:51.192 - 00:36:53.256, Speaker D: It's going to take months to get.
00:36:53.280 - 00:36:55.236, Speaker E: Into the hundreds of thousands of, of.
00:36:55.260 - 00:36:56.460, Speaker D: Staked ETH work, right?
00:36:56.492 - 00:37:03.860, Speaker E: About 60 or 70,000 staked right now as we talk, we're already like the.
00:37:03.892 - 00:37:26.178, Speaker D: Fourth or something largest LSD. And the reason is we have a very elegant and the most capital efficient model. A lot of people get confused. When we first launched Fracsafe, people were really confused. And it's okay because they don't think like currency issuers, which is fine, uh, but they were thinking like, why? What, what's the point?
00:37:26.226 - 00:37:28.498, Speaker E: Like, okay, I. All I'm going to have is that.
00:37:28.586 - 00:37:31.898, Speaker D: S fraxy, the state proxy, their token from the vault.
00:37:31.986 - 00:37:35.058, Speaker E: Why does Fraxis need to exist? Why are they making it so complicated?
00:37:35.106 - 00:37:55.106, Speaker D: Why is this so stupid? In fact, it's not more complicated. It's actually more capital efficient. It's better for growth. And it allows us to measure the organic demand of frac seed as a currency rather than as a, you know, a proof of stake farming project, right?
00:37:55.130 - 00:37:59.010, Speaker E: Like, we farm. We farm the proof of stake yield and we give it to you. And that's what we do.
00:37:59.042 - 00:38:01.586, Speaker D: We don't do that. That's not the reason we built this.
00:38:01.610 - 00:38:10.650, Speaker E: Because we thought it was cool to be just another LSD. Like a lot of people are going to launch LSD projects, right? Get, getting closer and closer to withdrawals because it's going to be the trendy.
00:38:10.682 - 00:38:11.922, Speaker D: Thing to do, right?
00:38:11.978 - 00:38:13.386, Speaker E: And, like, there's going to be hype.
00:38:13.410 - 00:38:15.582, Speaker D: For their tokens and stuff, and, and that's fine.
00:38:15.658 - 00:38:17.238, Speaker E: But we didn't launch it for an LSD project.
00:38:17.286 - 00:38:22.014, Speaker D: We launched it to launch a fracs ether pegged stablecoin. That's.
00:38:22.054 - 00:38:23.118, Speaker E: That's the reason we launched.
00:38:23.166 - 00:38:26.878, Speaker D: Obviously, we have the best validators.
00:38:26.966 - 00:38:28.774, Speaker E: We're working on validator technology.
00:38:28.894 - 00:38:32.878, Speaker D: That's what they're backed by. That's what pays for the risk free rate, right.
00:38:33.046 - 00:38:43.368, Speaker E: Our validators right now are the best rated on rated network and other validator scoring sites. And we're constantly working on it, of course. So, like, we do have a liquid.
00:38:43.416 - 00:38:56.960, Speaker D: Staking kind of service. But like I said at the beginning, if you want to understand why we're building all of these things and why it doesn't require, like, siloed attention there.
00:38:57.032 - 00:39:01.672, Speaker E: Like, it's not like there's like all these islands of projects like Frax Lender.
00:39:01.768 - 00:39:06.760, Speaker D: Frax ether and Frack, they're all the same thing. They're all built like currencies.
00:39:06.952 - 00:39:15.032, Speaker E: And so if you go back to what we're just saying about, like the fracs dollar Pec stablecoin, and the r1.
00:39:15.088 - 00:39:32.204, Speaker D: World asset model deposits at the Fed, if you think about it, the structure of that, exactly the same. The yield on the Fed deposit is like the proof of stake yields, kind of stake. The dollars that the Fed, you get.
00:39:32.584 - 00:39:38.764, Speaker E: The positive, the dollar, and then that.
00:39:38.804 - 00:39:44.064, Speaker D: Income comes to the fracs balance sheet, that goes to the fracs dow.
00:39:44.564 - 00:39:47.828, Speaker E: And then you can either figure out.
00:39:47.836 - 00:39:48.828, Speaker D: What to do with the income.
00:39:48.876 - 00:39:50.732, Speaker E: You could create a Volt or the.
00:39:50.748 - 00:39:54.172, Speaker D: Frax BP system or whatever, same exact structure.
00:39:54.228 - 00:39:57.924, Speaker E: And then the dollar back stablecoin, that has a 0% rate, if you hold.
00:39:57.964 - 00:40:09.432, Speaker D: That zero interest, it's same structure. Everything is. Is built as if we issue money. That's, that's the overarching concept of everything we're doing.
00:40:09.528 - 00:40:51.420, Speaker B: And there's a lot for listeners to digest. So I want to make sure they understand this part is very important. So, just to synthesize here, the major difference that frax ETH has with other so called liquid staking derivatives or lsds, like lido and rocket pool, is that you guys also issue a synthetic ETH, which is frax ethan. Whereas for lido, for rocket pool, if I use them, I just take my actual ETH, I deposit, I get my staked ETH in return or my rocket ETH. Whereas for eat, for frax, I can actually mint a synthetic frax ETH. And then if I want to, I can also turn it into state phrax ETH and earn that yield. And the difference is, you guys basically capture the market demand for spot ETH, not just state ETH as well.
00:40:51.420 - 00:40:54.600, Speaker B: Is that kind of a correct synthesis of why you guys did this?
00:40:54.772 - 00:40:55.888, Speaker D: Perfectly said, jason.
00:40:55.936 - 00:40:58.444, Speaker E: I mean, you're a central bank, right?
00:40:59.624 - 00:41:05.344, Speaker D: We try to capture the monetary demand of the monetary premium that we hopefully.
00:41:05.384 - 00:41:08.424, Speaker E: Create as fracs either permits the ecosystem.
00:41:08.464 - 00:41:35.136, Speaker D: You can't capture monetary premium of something if you're paying your risk free rate to every single person that is possibly touching your token. And in fact, it's not like an irreversible mistake. In fact, it's very simple to fix. You just create an un rebasing wrapper or something. Lido just has to do that, and then they'll have a non rebasing one. But they're going to have to, every.
00:41:35.200 - 00:41:38.352, Speaker E: Part of their economics, they're going to.
00:41:38.368 - 00:41:40.832, Speaker D: Have to think about it like a currency.
00:41:40.888 - 00:41:43.104, Speaker E: Maybe they don't want to do that. They're probably not interested.
00:41:43.264 - 00:41:45.776, Speaker D: They have the largest market cap.
00:41:45.800 - 00:41:50.780, Speaker E: So maybe we need to actually start, stop thinking like this and do it like that. I don't know.
00:41:50.812 - 00:41:56.972, Speaker D: But this has worked very well for us. It works well for central banks in.
00:41:56.988 - 00:42:09.540, Speaker E: Terms of getting currency widely adopted. The structural mechanics of the economics are the same, right? People say crypto is speedrunning economics. They're just discovering the same exact economic.
00:42:09.652 - 00:42:11.436, Speaker D: Rules, but really, really fast.
00:42:11.580 - 00:42:13.556, Speaker E: And I think there's a certain truth to that.
00:42:13.660 - 00:42:21.122, Speaker D: If you build the right kind of structural economics and don't get things disastrously.
00:42:21.178 - 00:42:24.186, Speaker E: Wrong, like starting with 0% cr, like.
00:42:24.210 - 00:42:36.978, Speaker D: Luna, you can do a lot of good things, right? And so I think everything we're building is from the first principles of how does it work as a currency if we're right?
00:42:37.026 - 00:42:46.694, Speaker E: I mean, like I said, people wrong. Actually, the right way to do it is light of, like, rebasing, um, having validator rewards, update to Steve tokens every day or whatever.
00:42:46.814 - 00:42:51.222, Speaker D: Um, but if we're right, we should be able to be continually the fastest.
00:42:51.278 - 00:42:55.286, Speaker E: Growing, uh, you know, lsd, and, uh.
00:42:55.350 - 00:42:58.606, Speaker D: Benefit from the monetary premium that frax ether gets.
00:42:58.750 - 00:43:12.594, Speaker B: So, just to clarify, for frax ETH, not the stake, frax ETH, for frax ETH, it's one to one backed by ETH deposit in a vault, right? It's, uh, it's. It doesn't have any kind of fractional reserve. Like, you guys don't take part of the ETH and stake it or anything like that? No.
00:43:12.634 - 00:43:13.786, Speaker E: So it's. No, we don't.
00:43:13.810 - 00:43:15.106, Speaker D: It's 100% cr.
00:43:15.210 - 00:43:25.122, Speaker E: Some of it has a curve amo, which is basically just backed by ETH and the lP. So it's basically the same thing. So right now, there's no withdrawals. So one of the things we did.
00:43:25.138 - 00:43:29.290, Speaker D: Is we designed a curve ammo, right, which basically takes some of the ETH.
00:43:29.322 - 00:43:31.514, Speaker E: That people deposit to mint practice ETH.
00:43:31.594 - 00:43:33.562, Speaker D: And then just lp's it in the curve.
00:43:33.658 - 00:43:35.490, Speaker E: And so that's 100% cr as well.
00:43:35.522 - 00:43:37.686, Speaker D: Because in order to ever actually get.
00:43:37.810 - 00:43:43.126, Speaker E: One frac seeth out of that curve, we have to put in one ETH, or you sell one frac seeth, and then you get out one of the.
00:43:43.150 - 00:43:45.554, Speaker D: ETH that's lp'd in there, so stays the same.
00:43:45.854 - 00:43:48.798, Speaker E: So it's 100% cr, and, in fact.
00:43:48.926 - 00:43:53.462, Speaker D: It'S actually technically higher cr than something.
00:43:53.518 - 00:43:55.350, Speaker E: Like lido and stuff, because all of.
00:43:55.422 - 00:44:05.276, Speaker D: Their ETH is staked in the validators. But only around 90% of our ETH is staked in our validators. The other ETH is liquid.
00:44:05.340 - 00:44:08.908, Speaker E: Right? It's the thing that's churning the, uh, in the amo for the.
00:44:08.956 - 00:44:10.140, Speaker D: The curve pool.
00:44:10.212 - 00:44:12.068, Speaker E: Right? Which is why, actually, if you look.
00:44:12.156 - 00:44:19.564, Speaker D: At the historic performance of frac seat, albeit it's much smaller than steeth, of course, but it is ruler flat.
00:44:19.644 - 00:44:22.036, Speaker E: It is 0.999. Like the.
00:44:22.060 - 00:44:27.516, Speaker D: The peg is exactly correct. It's never deviated, uh, even as it's grown, right?
00:44:27.540 - 00:44:32.658, Speaker E: It's. It's grown, like, parabolically. The peg is not deviated. People out of, like, dumped it, and it's, like, depegged or anything.
00:44:32.786 - 00:44:34.506, Speaker D: It works quite well.
00:44:34.530 - 00:44:40.386, Speaker E: And obviously, when withdrawals open, nothing needs to be said, right? Everyone can withdraw that.
00:44:40.410 - 00:44:44.026, Speaker D: And there's basically infinite liquidity. You just undo all the validators, and.
00:44:44.050 - 00:44:46.426, Speaker E: People get one to one ETH. Four for fracks ETH.
00:44:46.450 - 00:44:58.480, Speaker D: So, in fact, I would actually say not only is it always 100% backed by one ETH, at least, it's actually more liquid than all the other liquid.
00:44:58.512 - 00:45:00.232, Speaker E: Staging derivatives, because part of it is.
00:45:00.248 - 00:45:11.204, Speaker D: In a liquidity ammo until withdrawals open, right? And so some of the ETH is actually getting curve fees rather than proof of stake.
00:45:11.824 - 00:45:27.878, Speaker B: And speaking of validators as well, I think one community question was, how are you guys handling validator distribution right now? Because as we understand it, it's a little bit more centralized than lidarbu at this stage. So you guys are running the validators. Is there a plan to kind of decentralize that? And what does that roadmap look like?
00:45:28.046 - 00:45:28.734, Speaker D: Yeah, of course.
00:45:28.774 - 00:45:30.550, Speaker E: So right now, the, the frac score.
00:45:30.582 - 00:45:36.022, Speaker D: Team runs the validators. They're on commodity hardware, geo distributed across continents.
00:45:36.158 - 00:45:42.422, Speaker E: Uh, we have professional stack of managing them, load balanced, perfectly isolated.
00:45:42.478 - 00:45:44.334, Speaker D: It's not like some kind of, I.
00:45:44.374 - 00:45:55.080, Speaker E: Think people know by now from the amount of, uh, work we do in ship. And like, we, we've never had any kind of security issues with smart contracts or anything. We have the highest standards in terms.
00:45:55.112 - 00:45:57.192, Speaker D: Of security, but we run them. Yes.
00:45:57.288 - 00:46:15.964, Speaker E: The frack support team manages the validators. We do not anticipate that being the end goal to just run it like you would see Coinbase or binance running it as just a person in the organization or team that manages all of these things.
00:46:16.384 - 00:46:21.488, Speaker D: We anticipate basically allowing anyone to come and run validator.
00:46:21.536 - 00:46:22.496, Speaker E: The way we do it will be.
00:46:22.520 - 00:46:24.560, Speaker D: Slightly different than rocket pools.
00:46:24.592 - 00:46:30.288, Speaker E: I really like rocket pools, actually, the, the mini pools and being able to spin up your, your own validators for.
00:46:30.336 - 00:46:39.192, Speaker D: As capital efficient way as possible. So right now they put 16 ETH, I think they're thinking of lowering it to, I believe, four ETH something last.
00:46:39.208 - 00:46:40.504, Speaker E: Time I ship, which is good because.
00:46:40.584 - 00:46:42.704, Speaker D: If you get slashed, you get ejected.
00:46:42.744 - 00:46:42.944, Speaker E: Right.
00:46:42.984 - 00:46:48.780, Speaker D: So you don't need to actually put up 16 or even 32 to get.
00:46:48.812 - 00:46:50.212, Speaker E: Some ETH delegated to you to run.
00:46:50.228 - 00:46:54.884, Speaker D: A validator, because if you get slashed, then you get removed from the queue.
00:46:54.924 - 00:46:57.732, Speaker E: So you only need to put up as much collateral as it takes for.
00:46:57.748 - 00:46:59.828, Speaker D: You to have a really bad slashing.
00:46:59.916 - 00:47:00.332, Speaker E: Right.
00:47:00.428 - 00:47:03.796, Speaker D: We're going to do it slightly differently and we'll announce how we're going to do it.
00:47:03.820 - 00:47:06.524, Speaker E: But people will be able to essentially.
00:47:06.644 - 00:47:16.782, Speaker D: Borrow, if you will, through a modified fracs lend lending pair the ability to borrow the right to run a validator.
00:47:16.838 - 00:47:23.582, Speaker E: So it's actually going to be very interesting. Again, it's going to use our infrastructure that we've already built to continually just.
00:47:23.638 - 00:47:26.142, Speaker D: Aid improving the stable coins that we.
00:47:26.158 - 00:47:30.286, Speaker E: Have, frax ETH being one of them. Now, one thing I do want to.
00:47:30.350 - 00:47:33.214, Speaker D: Mention again, Lido is the top dog.
00:47:33.334 - 00:47:36.630, Speaker E: And so obviously maybe they're the ones doing it right.
00:47:36.662 - 00:47:49.432, Speaker D: But for example, I don't think any LSD currently is as decentralized as people like to talk on Twitter. For example, Lido has a whitelist.
00:47:49.568 - 00:47:54.352, Speaker E: In order for you to be a lido partner, you have to identify yourself, you have to Kyc yourself.
00:47:54.408 - 00:47:57.240, Speaker D: They always control the entry point in.
00:47:57.352 - 00:48:10.302, Speaker E: You being able to actually become a validator. They can say next year. Our community rules of being super awesome.
00:48:10.398 - 00:48:14.366, Speaker D: Include not doing x, y or z right now.
00:48:14.430 - 00:48:18.878, Speaker E: That's, now, if Lido had 100% of the stake right now, that's literally becomes.
00:48:18.926 - 00:48:23.190, Speaker D: Essentially a way to exclude people from.
00:48:23.222 - 00:48:25.206, Speaker E: Running lido validators if they have a.
00:48:25.270 - 00:48:34.222, Speaker D: Vast majority of it. Personally, I don't think this is a problem because no one is going to get anywhere between 51% to 66%.
00:48:34.318 - 00:48:36.898, Speaker E: You need two thirds to completely destroy everything.
00:48:37.046 - 00:48:47.402, Speaker D: And I know Lido has close to a third, and obviously the third, again, is distributed for their partners. They're the ones that they've whitelisted KYC.
00:48:47.458 - 00:48:48.410, Speaker E: And things like that.
00:48:48.442 - 00:48:52.362, Speaker D: And obviously it's better, clearly, that different.
00:48:52.418 - 00:48:55.514, Speaker E: People have different partners, have different amounts of stake.
00:48:55.554 - 00:49:12.970, Speaker D: But I. We're going to try to shoot for a more permissionless end state, right? I like rocket pool. I like the fact that it's more permissionless. It's not a white list. Obviously, Lido's the most, again, capital efficient, right?
00:49:13.082 - 00:49:17.050, Speaker E: And so, like, they, they have, they started first and they're also in the lead.
00:49:17.082 - 00:49:21.522, Speaker D: They're growing faster than, than rocket pool. So it's a lot of, you have.
00:49:21.538 - 00:49:27.274, Speaker E: To actually weigh a lot of what values you stand for, like what you're actually interested in, right?
00:49:27.314 - 00:49:35.412, Speaker D: Because if every single person that wants to run a node on rocket pool has to give for ETH, right, or.
00:49:35.468 - 00:49:37.504, Speaker E: However much, right now it's still 16.
00:49:37.804 - 00:49:40.364, Speaker D: That'S more expensive than Lido.
00:49:40.404 - 00:49:41.500, Speaker E: That just says, hey, we're just getting.
00:49:41.532 - 00:49:45.260, Speaker D: A bunch of ETH deposited and minting Steth.
00:49:45.372 - 00:49:50.692, Speaker E: Do you want to, like KYC or organization and run a data center or something and run our validator?
00:49:50.788 - 00:50:02.434, Speaker D: They don't have to put up 16 ETH per validator. So this is much more capital efficient, right? And so you have to weigh all of these different things, and it becomes.
00:50:03.014 - 00:50:04.606, Speaker E: It'S really easy for people on Twitter.
00:50:04.630 - 00:50:07.334, Speaker D: To just have, like, crazy opinions, like.
00:50:07.414 - 00:50:14.814, Speaker E: Like how crypto Twitter is. Oh, this is so decentralized, this is so centralized. This is such rubbish and stuff.
00:50:14.894 - 00:50:21.198, Speaker D: But they're hard decisions, because on one hand, some of the decisions help you compete better, right?
00:50:21.246 - 00:50:23.480, Speaker E: Make you more capital efficient, make you.
00:50:23.552 - 00:50:25.624, Speaker D: Capture market share faster.
00:50:25.784 - 00:50:32.624, Speaker E: Others are about continuing to have the crypto ethos. And, like, our long term is to.
00:50:32.744 - 00:50:40.064, Speaker D: Continually make products that match as close to possible while keeping the trillion dollar.
00:50:40.104 - 00:50:50.152, Speaker E: Vision of stable coins and seeing that as an opportunity in the 510 year period with that reality of actually needing to make some kind of compromises.
00:50:50.208 - 00:51:27.560, Speaker B: Right. And as a user myself, I always find myself thinking of the risks of different products when I use them in Defi. One thing that I thought was quite interesting is that all of the different LSE protocols seem to have different approaches to handling slashing. So, for Lido, for instance, I think if you deposit your ETH and your validator does something weird and they get slashed, you basically, I think you lose all of your ETH. And I believe the loss is socialized across all the ste holders. But I think rocket pool might do something different. How does Frax handle slashing risk? So if I, as a depositor, I put some ETH, I put some fraxied into stake.
00:51:27.560 - 00:51:31.044, Speaker B: Fraxie, the validator gets slashed, what happens to me?
00:51:31.584 - 00:51:32.008, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:51:32.056 - 00:51:41.976, Speaker E: So there's two bars to answer one. First of all, yeah. That is how Lido works. That's also why they need to Kyc, to make sure if someone messes up.
00:51:42.000 - 00:51:44.716, Speaker D: They can be like, hey, you screwed up.
00:51:44.740 - 00:51:46.452, Speaker E: We had slashed majorly, and now we.
00:51:46.468 - 00:51:52.388, Speaker D: Have to socialize it. Right. Rocket pool forces you to put up collateral.
00:51:52.436 - 00:51:52.596, Speaker A: Right?
00:51:52.620 - 00:51:56.028, Speaker D: So if you mess up, there's more than enough ETH for them to take.
00:51:56.076 - 00:51:58.108, Speaker E: From you and say, you messed up.
00:51:58.196 - 00:52:10.620, Speaker D: Here's the validator, here's the proof on chain. Currently, Fracs is two things. One is, so we take a 10%, the protocol takes a 10% cut similar to Lido.
00:52:10.732 - 00:52:25.148, Speaker E: 2% of that always gets put to the side to, like, an insurance fund for, like, slashing or performance. And it's already being accrued. Right. And separately, it's not being used to risk or, like, lose or something. It gets put aside for slashing insurance fund.
00:52:25.276 - 00:52:38.650, Speaker D: And the second part is, yeah. So after anyone can. Can run a validator, there's going to have to be some kind of system where they get you either liquidated. Right.
00:52:38.682 - 00:52:40.882, Speaker E: If it's like a loan. Remember I called it kind of a.
00:52:40.898 - 00:52:42.906, Speaker D: Modified fraxel and pair, where you come.
00:52:42.930 - 00:52:47.930, Speaker E: And you say, I want to run a validator from the balance sheet of.
00:52:47.962 - 00:52:50.898, Speaker D: All of the fracs ether collateral.
00:52:50.946 - 00:52:51.130, Speaker E: Right.
00:52:51.162 - 00:53:00.506, Speaker D: That people are depositing ETH one to one. Right. And you have to put up some amount of collateral, and if you get slashed, your LTV changes.
00:53:00.570 - 00:53:00.986, Speaker E: Right.
00:53:01.090 - 00:53:06.388, Speaker D: Every validator will have some kind of LTV, and they will be paying out.
00:53:06.516 - 00:53:10.060, Speaker E: Some kind of rate to lenders. So lender, the largest lender is probably.
00:53:10.092 - 00:53:21.972, Speaker D: Going to be frax ether with all of this stake that they have to be able to lend. Right. Other people can come deposit ether in that. And so if you're a validator, you.
00:53:21.988 - 00:53:24.204, Speaker E: Have to always make sure that your.
00:53:24.244 - 00:53:31.572, Speaker D: LTV, so to speak, right? If you get slashed, you lose some heat, your LTB is good, otherwise you.
00:53:31.588 - 00:53:48.516, Speaker E: Get liquidated, which means that ETH in there gets taken. The thing people are lending and risking for the yield you're paying and some ETH that you deposit, and then you get ejected from the queue. Obviously you lost some ETH as well, which is what gets replenished from the ETH that the protocol takes from you.
00:53:48.540 - 00:53:56.116, Speaker D: So in order to run a permissionless validator, you do have to put, obviously, collateral, just like rocket pool, right?
00:53:56.140 - 00:53:58.124, Speaker E: And for us, we're thinking of it.
00:53:58.164 - 00:54:01.316, Speaker D: More again, like a over collateralized loan.
00:54:01.380 - 00:54:02.580, Speaker E: In fact, it's kind of like a.
00:54:02.612 - 00:54:12.124, Speaker D: Modified fracs lend pair where every validator kind of has their own unique, isolated lending term sheet, so to speak.
00:54:12.164 - 00:54:13.092, Speaker E: So like, if you want to run.
00:54:13.108 - 00:54:15.452, Speaker D: A validator, you can come and be.
00:54:15.468 - 00:54:19.788, Speaker E: Like, okay, my validator address is like, you know, zero x blah blah blah.
00:54:19.956 - 00:54:26.140, Speaker D: I'm paying a yield of 12% or whatever. And who wants to lend to me?
00:54:26.172 - 00:54:41.092, Speaker E: Well, people are going to have to make the risk, right? And you're going to have to put some collateral yourself, right? Again, similar to rocket pool. And then people deposit their youth to earn some of your POS yield. You can even jump started with other kinds of token incentives if you want.
00:54:41.108 - 00:54:42.300, Speaker D: So it's actually a very, very cool.
00:54:42.332 - 00:54:48.180, Speaker E: Way for other daos to run parts of their validators. It's actually going to be very interesting.
00:54:48.332 - 00:54:49.660, Speaker D: It's not finalized yet.
00:54:49.692 - 00:54:59.540, Speaker E: So again, I usually don't like to say exactly how things work because then if we change some of it, people will be kind of disappointed. They'll be like you said on this podcast, because like, exactly like that.
00:54:59.652 - 00:55:06.428, Speaker D: We're still designing it. But again, the goal is to have the best way for daos, projects and.
00:55:06.516 - 00:55:09.940, Speaker E: Individuals in their homes and things globally.
00:55:09.972 - 00:55:13.596, Speaker D: To just be able to run all leaders. And the way you do that is.
00:55:13.700 - 00:55:16.460, Speaker E: Essentially borrowing the right to have it.
00:55:16.492 - 00:55:19.534, Speaker D: From lenders and then paying them an interest rate.
00:55:19.574 - 00:55:31.126, Speaker E: Well, where does the interest rate come from? Comes from you, from your validator earning rewards, or if you're a project or you want to pay extra token rewards and other stuff other than the ETH you earn, you can do that too.
00:55:31.150 - 00:55:32.534, Speaker D: You could pay the interest to the.
00:55:32.614 - 00:55:35.394, Speaker E: Fraxlin pair in the tokens.
00:55:35.934 - 00:55:36.478, Speaker B: Got it.
00:55:36.526 - 00:55:37.094, Speaker E: That's very clear.
00:55:37.134 - 00:55:59.884, Speaker B: Thank you for that. And I guess one last question on the Frax ETH part before I move on to the final part is so currently staked, ETH is offering the highest yield out of all these protocols. You guys are offering, I think 10% or so with this convex mechanism. Can you explain a little bit about how that works? And is there a plan to diversify the reliance on convex subsidies?
00:56:00.624 - 00:56:02.320, Speaker E: Yeah, two things.
00:56:02.392 - 00:56:13.440, Speaker D: One is the yield is obviously based on the principle that we talked about, is when you mint Frax ether, you have to decide, do you want to.
00:56:13.472 - 00:56:20.884, Speaker E: Lp it and curve, or do you want the risk free pos yield rate, which is the central bank's interest rate?
00:56:21.574 - 00:56:27.398, Speaker D: And if you think about it, what would have happened if we did not have this system?
00:56:27.486 - 00:56:30.070, Speaker E: Everything was like a rebasing token.
00:56:30.102 - 00:56:40.454, Speaker D: Like Steve, every LP in curve would also get the risk free rate. And basically no one would even stake.
00:56:40.574 - 00:56:45.910, Speaker E: In this pos vault, because you first stake it and then you have to go put it there, otherwise you're missing out.
00:56:45.942 - 00:56:51.562, Speaker D: Right. In fact, this actually makes liquidity cheaper because you have to decide whether you.
00:56:51.578 - 00:56:56.082, Speaker E: Want to get paid for providing liquidity or you want to hold the vault token.
00:56:56.178 - 00:57:02.106, Speaker D: And so we're actually able to provide the more sustainably. Obviously, as we get rove more and.
00:57:02.130 - 00:57:03.858, Speaker E: More, we have to actually get frax.
00:57:03.906 - 00:57:06.346, Speaker D: Ether, the stablecoin, to be used in.
00:57:06.370 - 00:57:11.074, Speaker E: Different places, to be used instead of wheat, to be used on other chains and things like that.
00:57:11.114 - 00:57:14.814, Speaker D: Otherwise the yield will drop, right?
00:57:14.854 - 00:57:15.854, Speaker E: I mean, that's the thing.
00:57:15.934 - 00:57:25.914, Speaker D: They'll drop to similar performance to Steve. Right, because it might still be marginally better for a long time, just because.
00:57:26.534 - 00:57:35.126, Speaker E: Obviously the curve and convex five wheels are good, and we put a lot of time into that. But there's no way, without getting monetary.
00:57:35.190 - 00:57:44.748, Speaker D: Premium, you can keep these kinds of aprs other than the fact that, uh, you, you need people basically using it, right?
00:57:44.836 - 00:57:45.916, Speaker E: And, and so, like, one of the.
00:57:45.940 - 00:57:48.348, Speaker D: Main things is we don't try to over promise.
00:57:48.396 - 00:57:50.588, Speaker E: We don't try to like, do anything unsustainable.
00:57:50.636 - 00:57:52.588, Speaker D: In fact, like we're talking about at.
00:57:52.596 - 00:57:56.324, Speaker E: The beginning of the podcast, 2022 came and went.
00:57:56.484 - 00:57:59.012, Speaker D: We're still here, stronger than ever, right.
00:57:59.068 - 00:58:03.956, Speaker E: And, and continue to ship. And, uh, our incentives are sustainable.
00:58:04.020 - 00:58:05.204, Speaker D: They're, they're healthy.
00:58:05.324 - 00:58:07.668, Speaker E: We, we budget them based on the.
00:58:07.796 - 00:58:09.764, Speaker D: Revenue that the Dow makes and, and.
00:58:09.804 - 00:58:16.500, Speaker E: The amount of, you know, CVX tokens. We have other tokens. We have the, you know, protocol on liquidity and everything like that.
00:58:16.532 - 00:58:23.264, Speaker D: So we don't over promise. 10% might sound kind of like the.
00:58:23.564 - 00:58:26.196, Speaker E: New coming of anchor for like LSD's.
00:58:26.220 - 00:58:29.540, Speaker D: Or something, but it's like, but it's not. It sounds great.
00:58:29.572 - 00:58:30.716, Speaker E: And so it's, people are saying I'm.
00:58:30.740 - 00:58:33.944, Speaker D: Staking it in, it's fully backed by ETH.
00:58:34.244 - 00:58:36.500, Speaker E: And I'm here telling you it's obviously.
00:58:36.532 - 00:58:49.122, Speaker D: Not going to be like that at scale, right. At like billions of dollars of ETH. It, it won't be 10%, it'll be closer to Leidos. But that's not bad. It's to sense the same thing as steep.
00:58:49.218 - 00:58:57.058, Speaker E: We're not trying to over promise and being like we're static. We're going to keep it at 10% and we're going to this and that and we're going to mint tokens and.
00:58:57.146 - 00:59:00.786, Speaker D: No, I mean, the way that we have this thing growing is that we're.
00:59:00.810 - 00:59:14.878, Speaker E: Able to capture monetary premium, we're able to split the interest rate for providing LP or just POS rewards. Makes it double as capital efficient, work small compared to Lido, even though we're the number fourth or something.
00:59:15.006 - 00:59:26.622, Speaker D: LSD, as it becomes the size of something like Lido, it'll probably approach closer to Lido. But so what then? It's basically like steep.
00:59:26.798 - 00:59:57.414, Speaker B: Definitely. And I'd love to go on and on about liquid staking because there's a few more questions that I think has as well. But I think we have to move on to the last part for the purpose of time. And this is more of a general question for you, which is what are the major initiatives to increase adoption for fracs, especially given what happened last year with UST and a lot of the loss of trust in crypto people just running back to fiat coins. How do we introduce that trust back and how do we bring people back?
00:59:58.404 - 01:00:00.852, Speaker E: Well, yeah, I mean thats a good.
01:00:00.948 - 01:00:03.492, Speaker D: Thing to bring up because like I.
01:00:03.508 - 01:00:05.476, Speaker E: Said, at the end of the day.
01:00:05.500 - 01:00:11.584, Speaker D: The closest thing to risk free in terms of the dollar peg stablecoin is.
01:00:12.244 - 01:00:15.268, Speaker E: Well run fiat coins, right.
01:00:15.316 - 01:00:19.620, Speaker D: Well run transparent audited things that are.
01:00:19.692 - 01:00:21.828, Speaker E: Closest to Federal Reserve deposits.
01:00:21.876 - 01:00:25.004, Speaker D: So I think when fracs is under.
01:00:25.044 - 01:00:36.540, Speaker E: Percent cr, it is as close to risk free as we can possibly get. Again, not obviously risk free, but it basically becomes the same risk profile as.
01:00:36.572 - 01:00:45.420, Speaker D: USDC, which is the de facto closest thing to risk free crypto has. I think that will speak for itself. Now, the other stuff like Frax ether.
01:00:45.492 - 01:00:47.156, Speaker E: And things, you can think of those.
01:00:47.220 - 01:00:50.744, Speaker D: As decentralized stablecoins that will never touch.
01:00:51.194 - 01:00:52.698, Speaker E: A fiat bank account or anything.
01:00:52.746 - 01:00:53.002, Speaker D: Right.
01:00:53.058 - 01:00:55.642, Speaker E: Like I said, a lot of stuff we build is with the crypto ethos.
01:00:55.698 - 01:01:06.674, Speaker D: But with the reality of the structure of economics at scale. Right. And so frax ether totally sound, it's entirely, entirely contained, right?
01:01:06.714 - 01:01:08.442, Speaker E: It's entirely backed by ETH, which is.
01:01:08.458 - 01:01:12.274, Speaker D: The thing it's pegged to. There should never be any scenario in.
01:01:12.314 - 01:01:24.374, Speaker E: Any case where frax ether requires like real world assets, right? Or anything, or even like, for whatever reason, you know, having KYC features that are like gated or things like that, right?
01:01:24.494 - 01:01:31.070, Speaker D: And the fracs, dollar peg, stablecoin, I think people will feel better and better.
01:01:31.222 - 01:01:35.166, Speaker E: Every month using them and using that.
01:01:35.190 - 01:01:41.054, Speaker D: As like things in fracs, VP and everything and just holding it idle, the safer it gets.
01:01:41.094 - 01:01:43.734, Speaker E: The. It's already extremely safe. It's never broken.
01:01:43.774 - 01:01:45.702, Speaker D: It's pegged.
01:01:45.702 - 01:01:50.566, Speaker E: Been the most reliable on chain stable coin like Dai.
01:01:50.750 - 01:02:05.174, Speaker D: But I think in order for it to be in the conversation with things like USDC, like tether, like BuSD, it's going to have to be 100% cr, it's going to have to have r1 world asset.
01:02:05.334 - 01:02:08.074, Speaker E: And again, that real world asset is.
01:02:08.694 - 01:02:11.714, Speaker D: Closest thing to deposits on the Fed's ledger.
01:02:12.184 - 01:02:15.960, Speaker E: And I think that'll speak for itself if we can execute on that.
01:02:16.072 - 01:02:18.496, Speaker D: I think fracs will be essentially like.
01:02:18.520 - 01:02:22.672, Speaker E: USDC but without the blacklist.
01:02:22.768 - 01:02:28.608, Speaker D: So it still will be a structural, non custodial, stable coin.
01:02:28.656 - 01:02:32.520, Speaker E: And so we're going to describe how that's going to be able to be.
01:02:32.552 - 01:02:38.844, Speaker D: Possible with the way that the real world collateral for the Fed deposits and things like that.
01:02:39.464 - 01:02:52.484, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And I think that's an amazing note to close us on. So we'll link the 2023 roadmap to our listeners below. And for people who want to keep up to date with you, with fracs, as always, what are the best channels for them to do this?
01:02:52.864 - 01:03:01.136, Speaker E: Yeah, of course, I'm always on Telegram, the Frax, Telegram, fax, finance that. Twitter is the same for me.
01:03:01.200 - 01:03:04.056, Speaker D: Telegram and Twitter is basically where I.
01:03:04.080 - 01:03:08.720, Speaker E: Am around the clock. I'm working. And have the telegram tab and Twitter.
