00:00:28.064 - 00:00:31.976, Speaker C: This episode is also brought to you by Periswap. Stick around to learn more.
00:00:32.120 - 00:00:48.672, Speaker D: Beta Finance is building a permissionless protocol for people to easily short overheated tokens, now incubated by Alpha Launchpad and Binance Launchpad Beta recently got a lot of attention by allowing users to short NFT, which is a fractionalized NFT of a doge painting.
00:00:48.808 - 00:00:50.680, Speaker B: So there's a lot of interesting things.
00:00:50.712 - 00:01:24.036, Speaker D: To unpack here in this episode. I'm very excited to be joined by founder Alan to talk about the importance of shorting in Defi, how beta works, competition for beta, including Rarifuse Sushi's kashi and other protocols, as well as minor extractable value when you're shorting on chain, there's a ton of valuable information Alan drops in this episode, and we go into the weeds about how the protocol works, as well as its trade offs as well. So make sure you listen till the very end. And if you haven't already, make sure you subscribe to the show on iTunes, Spotify, or your favorite podcast platform as well.
00:01:24.170 - 00:01:30.232, Speaker E: All right, I'm super excited to talk to the founder of Beta Finance, Alan, finally to have you on the show. So welcome.
00:01:30.328 - 00:01:33.520, Speaker B: Thanks, Jason. Really excited to be here and talk to you all today about beta.
00:01:33.632 - 00:01:47.024, Speaker E: Yeah, so a lot of stuff happened for Beta in the past week, but I'd love to, before we even dive into any of that, we'd love to dive into your background and kind of your story. So you started at MIT, you were a genius there. And how did you get into crypto?
00:01:47.104 - 00:02:07.024, Speaker B: Genius is a bit of an overstatement, but yes, I did both my bachelor's and master's in eecs at MIT before starting, and I first got my exposure to crypto in the fall of 2018 when MIT offered their first decentralized systems class. And there I got exposure to blockchain.
00:02:07.064 - 00:02:09.592, Speaker F: Development and blockchain research for the first time.
00:02:09.728 - 00:02:33.344, Speaker B: But we were mostly focused on researching bitcoin and so I actually worked on stacks instead of Ethereum at the time, but I slowly made my way over to the light side from the dark side and started working on Ethereum dapps and developing my slitty skills. And then eventually I felt comfortable enough to start beta.
00:02:33.684 - 00:02:34.092, Speaker F: Got it.
00:02:34.108 - 00:02:43.732, Speaker E: That's awesome. I guess before we dive into how it works and all that, what exactly is beta? And what was the inspiration for starting this specific project?
00:02:43.908 - 00:03:08.956, Speaker B: Yeah, so beta finance is a cross trade, permissionless money market protocol for lending, borrowing and short selling crypto assets. And what we've done at beta is we've created, created an integrated, one click short tool that really enables all DeFi users to easily initiate, manage and close their short positions. And additionally, anyone, anywhere at any time, can also create money markets for a.
00:03:08.980 - 00:03:13.172, Speaker F: Token, automatically unlocking new potential asset utilization.
00:03:13.348 - 00:03:17.580, Speaker B: Without having to go through the team or governance in order to create this.
00:03:17.612 - 00:03:20.544, Speaker F: Money market for lending and borrowing in the first place.
00:03:20.984 - 00:03:23.216, Speaker B: And kind of the inspiration for why.
00:03:23.240 - 00:03:24.832, Speaker F: We created beta in the first place.
00:03:24.968 - 00:04:10.826, Speaker B: Was that I personally am a heavy defi user. And when I was trying to initiate short positions before, I found the experience very unintuitive as well as disjoint. So it required interactions with multiple protocols. You had to manually manage all your positions. It was difficult to close your positions because you had to keep track of all the values explicitly, like the variable apys, the variable prices, figure out when your position was about to go underwater. And it really just kept me awake at night. And so I really thought that also shorting was an extremely important feature or tool in traditional finance that was missing in decentralized finance, because it really prevented people from taking the opposite side of the trade.
00:04:10.826 - 00:04:17.758, Speaker B: And so we saw a lot of projects, especially this past year, where there was like a huge run up in the token, only for it to come.
00:04:17.806 - 00:04:20.794, Speaker F: Crashing down due to something like a fire sale.
00:04:21.134 - 00:04:26.126, Speaker B: I really wanted to spearhead a way in which we could allow people to.
00:04:26.150 - 00:04:27.502, Speaker F: Take the opposite side of the trade.
00:04:27.558 - 00:04:29.454, Speaker B: Earlier, such that there was a more.
00:04:29.534 - 00:04:32.078, Speaker F: Healthy value accrual of the token, rather.
00:04:32.126 - 00:04:52.024, Speaker B: Than it just skyrocketing to something overvalued and then crashing, making it really hard for the project to recover in the long run. And I think by also facilitating greater stability in DeFi, it'll also lead to more healthy mainstream adoption by both retail and institutions, because it'll be safer for.
00:04:52.064 - 00:04:57.272, Speaker F: Them to interact with DeFi and invest in different protocols.
00:04:57.448 - 00:05:22.896, Speaker E: Yeah, I think the point that you made about how clunky it is to short assets in DeFi is so pertinent. Because right now, if I want to short anything, I got to go on AAVE or compound to borrow an asset, and they might not even have that asset, first of all. And then I got to monitor my collateral ratio, and then I got to go to like sushiswap or Uniswap to sell that token in order to complete that short leg. But from what you're saying, it sounds like beta lets you do this all in one single place, is that right?
00:05:23.000 - 00:05:36.544, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. So that's like a big reason why we also built the permissionless money market feature. So first and foremost, we developed beta with a short selling framework in mind, and that kind of differentiates us from.
00:05:36.584 - 00:05:38.844, Speaker F: Other money market protocols that are in the space.
00:05:39.144 - 00:05:41.360, Speaker B: And because, as you mentioned, there's limited.
00:05:41.432 - 00:05:43.672, Speaker F: Options on like AaVE and compound, et.
00:05:43.688 - 00:05:52.160, Speaker B: Cetera, because of the way the risk is structured, it prevents you from actually having access to the tokens of interest that you want to shorts.
00:05:52.352 - 00:05:52.792, Speaker F: Got it.
00:05:52.808 - 00:06:07.784, Speaker E: And I love to talk about the user lifecycle of using beta. Let's start with the borrow part. When I go on beta, what types of assets are available for me to short, and if I want to initiate that borrow, how does it work from the user side?
00:06:07.904 - 00:07:31.744, Speaker B: Yeah, let's take the NFT market, for example. But in the end, any token that has a uniswap v three ETH pair is able to be initialized as a beta money market and then immediately able to be shorted. For example, what that looks like is if you go onto our dapp, you'll be able to click our short button, which takes you to our one click short tool. What you do is you post collateral, um, so either stablecoin or ETH currently, and you just select an amount that you want to short, and then you execute the, um, you initiate the position by clicking a simple button. But what happens under the hood is that we'll actually borrow the token that you want to short from the respective money market, swap it through an integrated Dex, so either uniswap or Zushiswap, um, to the collateral token, and then once it's swapped to the collateral token, it'll be locked in that position on your behalf for you. So when you want to come back later down the road and close out your shared position, you're able to also immediately pay with the borrow token rather, I'm sorry, with the collateral token rather than with the shorted token itself. So this saves you the step of having to swap back to the underlying token to repay your debt.
00:07:31.884 - 00:07:47.664, Speaker E: Got it. And let's talk about a shorter's nightmare, which is when prices run against you when you're short. So let's say that I'm short a certain coin that I'm bearish on, it starts going up against me and I begin to be liquidated. How does the liquidation process currently work on beta?
00:07:47.784 - 00:07:56.608, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's very similar to Aave and compound, where liquidators are at most able to liquidate half of a position.
00:07:56.696 - 00:07:57.324, Speaker F: Currently.
00:07:58.384 - 00:08:35.100, Speaker B: Currently. We also have a script that helps monitor for positions that go underwater, as well as an internal tool, that internal front end, that we use to monitor all positions. But we'll also try to be making this live soon so that our users are able to see the health of various positions on our protocol. We've also been working with external third parties who run bots, liquidation bots on Aave and compound as well, just to really ensure that, um, the protocol stays healthy and that the positions don't go underwater.
00:08:35.252 - 00:08:45.660, Speaker E: And I'd love to kind of touch on this point about minor extractable value as well, because, you know, for Aave and compound, if you see people borrow on chain, they might be borrowing for a multitude of reasons, right?
00:08:45.692 - 00:08:45.812, Speaker F: They.
00:08:45.828 - 00:09:05.116, Speaker E: I could be borrowing comp token to participate in governance, or I could be borrowing, you know, Aave tokens to go stake. But with beta, if you see someone borrow on chain, they're really doing it for one thing, which is to sell it to short it. So is it possible for people to kind of see that borrow happen and then front run that by selling the token in advance? How do you think about that?
00:09:05.260 - 00:09:17.356, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really interesting question. So I will caveat this, saying that people are still decently significant borrow activity on our protocol. But yes, shorting is also a very.
00:09:17.460 - 00:09:20.508, Speaker F: Significant portion of the activity on beta finance right now.
00:09:20.676 - 00:09:49.364, Speaker B: And so in terms of people front running these transactions, we haven't seen that sort of activity yet. But we are kind of like, curious about whether or not this will take place in the future. Because front running a short is kind of like hard to do, hard to evaluate whether or not that'll be profitable in the long run, because now you're introducing more risk. When they're trying to initiate a position, it's not a clear cut.
00:09:49.484 - 00:09:51.652, Speaker F: This will result in a positive ev.
00:09:51.748 - 00:10:12.454, Speaker B: For the front runner. Usually these positions are held for about one to two days, is what we're seeing right now, before they're getting closed. And that's a bit too long for these front run bots to guarantee that they'll be able to extract value by front running these trades.
00:10:12.874 - 00:10:33.626, Speaker E: I see. I guess these bots have to have a market view as well. The price will go down, so it's not just front running. You also actually have to have a short bias to do this if it's one or two days. That's really interesting. I didn't think that, and I'd love to talk about what's happened so far. So obviously beta Finance just launched not too long ago and the token just got listed as well.
00:10:33.626 - 00:10:46.554, Speaker E: And what I thought was interesting was you guys chose to launch first on Alpha Launchpad. So there's dozens of launchpads out there, both centralized and decentralized. What was the reason for going with Alpha? And what do you get out of the Alpha launchpad?
00:10:46.674 - 00:10:58.272, Speaker B: Yeah, so the reason why we're distributing some tokens through Alpha Launchpad is because beta Finance is actually the first incubator project of Alpha Launchpad. So I actually was connected with one.
00:10:58.288 - 00:11:00.216, Speaker F: Of the co founders from Alpha Nepoon.
00:11:00.320 - 00:11:03.576, Speaker B: Who is two years my senior at MIT. And that's kind of how I got.
00:11:03.600 - 00:11:08.168, Speaker F: Introduced to Alpha in the first place. Huge respect for the Alpha team as well.
00:11:08.296 - 00:11:22.158, Speaker B: And so they actually started working with me before I had launched the product in the first place. And one of the conditions of being an incubator project and being introduced to great investors like Spartan, connected with a.
00:11:22.166 - 00:11:24.646, Speaker F: Lot of partners in the space as.
00:11:24.670 - 00:11:28.870, Speaker B: Well, is that we give them some of our token supply that they will.
00:11:28.902 - 00:11:31.554, Speaker F: Then redistribute to alpha stakeholders.
00:11:32.254 - 00:11:33.838, Speaker B: And so that's kind of the reasoning.
00:11:33.886 - 00:11:35.678, Speaker F: Of why we were doing Alpha launchpad.
00:11:35.726 - 00:11:47.966, Speaker B: In the first place, is because they have provided a lot of value into kind of driving the initial success of beta, as well as advising me on a lot of PD and strategy and.
00:11:48.030 - 00:11:49.994, Speaker F: Product market fit problems.
00:11:50.374 - 00:12:10.658, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Alpha as well as listeners of the podcast would know. And I think it's really clever how stakers of the Alpha token gets tokens from all these different launchpad projects. I'm curious whether you guys discuss other synergies as well. Will beta be plugging into existing alpha products in other ways as well, or is it currently just incubated and launched on the launchpad?
00:12:10.806 - 00:12:21.834, Speaker B: Yes. So we do have plans to integrate with the alpha hemorrhoid product. For example, maybe there are some interesting delta neutral farming strategies that Alpha could.
00:12:21.874 - 00:12:24.834, Speaker F: Employ by using beta as well as.
00:12:24.914 - 00:12:58.248, Speaker B: Maybe you want to now take leveraged short positions. Alpha's technology could also help integrate into initiating such things. And so these are some of the few points that we've been exploring, but we're mainly targeting these partnerships to go live. Maybe like Q four of this year or late. Sorry, late Q four of this year or maybe Q one of next year since we really want to be sure that there are no bugs with integrations with other protocols. And so you need to do a.
00:12:58.256 - 00:12:59.624, Speaker F: Lot of testing for that.
00:12:59.744 - 00:13:14.338, Speaker E: Yeah, definitely. I think it was maybe one or two months ago there was this first asset that was listed on beta for borrowing and shorting, which is a fractionalized NFT of a dog painting. So can you explain what that is and kind of how that came to be?
00:13:14.426 - 00:13:40.072, Speaker B: Yeah, it was super exciting because at the time we launched nfts, that kind of exploded. Right. It was kind of like NFT summer. We were in a super cycle and there was a lot of talk about like how would you be able to shorten NFT because of the over speculation in the space. And there was a lot of news articles about people saying like, oh, we are going to develop something that allows you to shorten NFT. But at beta we were like, we.
00:13:40.088 - 00:13:41.936, Speaker F: Can actually do this right now.
00:13:42.080 - 00:13:48.608, Speaker B: And so actually just a few days after we launched, we had kind of like hit the ground running and decided.
00:13:48.656 - 00:13:51.512, Speaker F: That we want to onboard NFT as.
00:13:51.608 - 00:14:08.546, Speaker B: Kind of the first volatile or risky asset that is on beta finance and enable people just like really short an NFT for the first time. And so beta finance is actually the first protocol in DeFi that users were.
00:14:08.570 - 00:14:10.986, Speaker F: Actually able to shorten NFT for the first time.
00:14:11.090 - 00:14:14.434, Speaker B: And that's really exciting because it shows.
00:14:14.474 - 00:14:16.402, Speaker F: That beta is able to tolerate risky.
00:14:16.458 - 00:14:32.390, Speaker B: Assets and opens up a whole new suite of tokens that you are now able to give asset utilization to and earn interest to. Because previously there's no way for you to stake an MFT token and earn interest.
00:14:32.542 - 00:14:33.838, Speaker F: You could either just hold it in.
00:14:33.846 - 00:14:40.086, Speaker B: Your wallet or sell it. Those are not great options. You want to be earning additional yield.
00:14:40.150 - 00:14:42.354, Speaker F: If you're a long term believer in the token.
00:14:43.134 - 00:14:46.934, Speaker B: That was a really cool thing that we were able to do and hopefully.
00:14:46.974 - 00:14:50.150, Speaker F: We'Ll be able to show the community that we're able to do a lot more as well.
00:14:50.222 - 00:14:50.574, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:50.654 - 00:14:59.820, Speaker E: Currently the shorting is only for ERC 20 standard tokens. You're not shorting the actual NFT, but the fractionalized and fungible pieces of the NFT.
00:14:59.892 - 00:15:09.772, Speaker B: Right, exactly. So the fractionalized tokens are kind of like a proxy for the value of the NFT. And that's what you're able to short.
00:15:09.908 - 00:15:54.882, Speaker C: Now before I continue, I'd love to share one of my favorite products in crypto with you. Now whenever I want to trade a token instead of going to uniswap sushiswap Bancor one by one to see where I can find the best quote, I just go to paraswap to scan for the best price anywhere because per swap aggregates all the popular Ethereum dexs and saves me a ton of time and headache in finding where I can trade something for the best price and lets me trade in one place. Now the cool thing is theyve also integrated with Ledger live as well, meaning I can now swap at the best prices directly from my ledger wallet. So seriously, if youre a Defi trader and youre worried about the security risks of centralized exchanges, but you also dont want to scour dozens of dexs just to find the best price, you have to check out Periswap. So head on over to Paraswap IO.
00:15:55.058 - 00:16:32.758, Speaker G: Blockcrunch this episode is also sponsored by the Hbar foundation. Now one to two years ago I was often skeptical of layer one ecosystems outside of Ethereum. And then in the past twelve months I noticed billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of users flocking to new chains left and right. Then I realized there's an actual market gap being filled. And one of those newer networks is Hedera Hashgraph. Hedera is an enterprise grade public network with its own crypto asset called HBAR, and the Hbar foundation has launched with an initial budget of $2.5 billion to provide builders with the funding and ecosystem support needed to quickly build and deploy new applications.
00:16:32.758 - 00:16:44.942, Speaker G: The HbAR foundation is eager to find builders in DeFi nfts, gaming, and all sectors in crypto. So if youre a developer or creator with an idea, visit hbarfoundation.org to learn more.
00:16:44.998 - 00:17:28.456, Speaker H: Id love to talk a little bit about notional if youve followed the show for long enough, you know Im pretty excited about fixed rate products. Notional finance is the leading fixed rate borrowing and lending protocol, and theyve just released a major upgrade. With notional, you can not only borrow and lend at fixed rates for up to one year now, but liquidity providers also have a pretty good opportunity. Thanks to an integration with compound and a liquidity mining program, LP's can actually earn interest, liquidity fees and token liquidity mining incentives as well. Weve talked with Teddy from Notional recently, and as a happy investor as well, I've been pretty impressed with how the team is building this critical infrastructure that will help onboard the next billion users to DeFi. So you can check it out today at Notional Finance blockcrunch.
00:17:28.560 - 00:17:53.286, Speaker E: And I'm curious, how do you convince projects to work with beta if you're allowing people to short their tokens? Because shorting is a really important piece of the market, but there's always this instinctive aversion to shorting. It's seen as evil. It's dumping our token price. How do you convince projects to, I guess, seed liquidity on beta? Or do you even need their permission to have their assets listed?
00:17:53.390 - 00:18:47.264, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think this is a pretty common misconception that a lot of people in Defi have about shorting, that it's some evil tool. But really if you kind of take a look at what its main purpose is, which is to prevent over speculation and allow for kind of like healthier price value accrual, then it's beneficial for long term token holders. Because if say your tokens are perhaps like locked, for example right now, and it suddenly spikes like 1000 x and you're unable to sell, but then like the price dumps, in the long run the token is just kind of unable to reach back to those levels even though it is worth that much like maybe two, three years down the line. Um, so that's like one benefit of shorting, which is allowing people to um, kind of mitigate the volatility and allow.
00:18:47.304 - 00:18:49.328, Speaker F: For a healthier value accrual of the token.
00:18:49.456 - 00:19:16.874, Speaker B: But shorting also introduces a lot of interesting like hedging strategies as well for token holders. So for example, um, as I mentioned, say for example, when you stake a token, there's like a certain unlock period, right? Like I know, for like Solana it's like seven days, right? For perp it's also like seven days, I believe. And so perhaps you want to sell the token immediately, but you're unable to.
00:19:16.914 - 00:19:19.346, Speaker F: Because there's this unstaking period like on.
00:19:19.370 - 00:20:02.518, Speaker B: Beta, you're now able to borrow, say the token and sell it at that premium price and then pay back your debt seven days down the road. Additionally, there's other things such as Dex X arbitrage that are now possible with beta that weren't possible before, as well as basis trading and delta neutral yield farming, as I mentioned before. So these are ways in which we see us driving more asset utilization for tokens that benefit these token holders. Because if you're a long term holder, you're able to earn additional APY by lending and also now have the opportunity to hedge your risks.
00:20:02.686 - 00:20:25.150, Speaker E: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And I just can't remember how many times I've staked the token. And the rewards have either a year long vest or the tokens are locked up for a few months and sometimes the price spikes. And I do want to mitigate the volatility of my returns over time. And this would be a very useful tool. And actually, on that note, would you guys plan to enable staked assets as collateral as well?
00:20:25.262 - 00:20:28.262, Speaker B: Yeah. So you're talking about things like Lido finance, right?
00:20:28.318 - 00:20:30.776, Speaker F: Like state Lido, maybe like state owned.
00:20:30.910 - 00:21:06.280, Speaker B: Yeah. These are assets that we're actively exploring as well to be used as collateral. It just takes some time for us to evaluate the risk framework, but we do see that there is a path to onboarding these assets, and we're really excited for it because it seems that a lot of users are diamond hands, these kinds of tokens, and want to use them as collateral in order to gain exposure to other assets or use them as collateral to short other assets. And so we're actively exploring that.
00:21:06.392 - 00:21:07.044, Speaker E: Just.
00:21:07.384 - 00:21:09.088, Speaker B: It's a bit complicated right now, so.
00:21:09.136 - 00:21:11.000, Speaker F: Need to take some more time to evaluate.
00:21:11.112 - 00:21:11.504, Speaker A: For sure.
00:21:11.544 - 00:21:13.704, Speaker E: For sure. And in terms of the lender profile.
00:21:13.744 - 00:21:13.896, Speaker F: Right.
00:21:13.920 - 00:21:38.890, Speaker E: So for people who are providing liquidity to the pools, it's all on chain and kind of permissionless, so it might be hard to tell. But do you have a rough sense about what profile these people are? Are these kind of long term holders who really just want to earn a yield and they don't care that their assets are being borrowed to short, or are these kind of more, I guess, more tactical type of traders or these foundations that have a lot of tokens on hand? Is there a general profile of lenders on the platform?
00:21:39.042 - 00:21:46.866, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's hard to say because I've analyzed the wallet addresses before, but you don't really know who is the.
00:21:46.890 - 00:21:49.242, Speaker F: Entity behind these wallet addresses?
00:21:49.378 - 00:22:24.850, Speaker B: Could be the same person, the same group, et cetera. I have seen that similar to most DeFi protocols, the majority of capital is from whales, mostly because they're able to contribute millions, ten millions of dollars for lending. But I have seen that most capital stays on the protocol for a while. For example, over the course of phase one, we had about like 10,000 deposits from, I'm sorry, 10,000 unique addresses deposit.
00:22:24.882 - 00:22:30.634, Speaker F: On the protocol, and only about like 1000 withdraws over the course of phase one.
00:22:30.794 - 00:22:32.186, Speaker B: So we are seeing like, the majority.
00:22:32.210 - 00:22:34.054, Speaker F: Of deposits stay on the protocol.
00:22:34.354 - 00:22:43.242, Speaker E: Got it. And you speak about phase one, which implies that there is a phase two. So can you talk a little bit about what's in store for us and phase two for beta as well.
00:22:43.338 - 00:22:59.362, Speaker B: Yeah, so phase two actually released a few days ago. And with phase two, what prime is the active liquidity mining program as well as our permissionless money market listing feature. So currently people are able to list markets permissionlessly as long as there is.
00:22:59.378 - 00:23:01.818, Speaker F: A uniswap v three to app and.
00:23:01.906 - 00:23:06.466, Speaker B: We'Ll have a full guide that kind of walks through this process for our.
00:23:06.490 - 00:23:08.714, Speaker F: Community student on this as well.
00:23:08.874 - 00:23:10.626, Speaker B: And then in addition to this, we.
00:23:10.650 - 00:23:12.834, Speaker F: Also have the active liquidity mining program.
00:23:12.994 - 00:23:21.764, Speaker B: So what this means is now people are able to earn beta rewards by lending, borrowing and shorting on the DAAP.
00:23:21.884 - 00:23:22.252, Speaker F: Got it.
00:23:22.268 - 00:23:34.284, Speaker E: And I also love to talk about this point about permissionless listing, which you touched on earlier. So what do you think people will list in the future? And why is permission listing such an important concept?
00:23:34.404 - 00:23:45.076, Speaker B: Yeah, so permissionless listing is important because previously we've seen like it's a very complex like time intensive process in order.
00:23:45.100 - 00:23:47.944, Speaker F: To onboard and ask onto existing money market.
00:23:48.364 - 00:23:50.388, Speaker B: And because of this, this prevents like.
00:23:50.436 - 00:23:52.224, Speaker F: Most tokens from being listed.
00:23:52.684 - 00:24:04.220, Speaker B: And so we want to kind of like bypass this and allow people who wanted to create a money market for their token do so automatically. And so you can imagine like long tail assets that would never really be.
00:24:04.252 - 00:24:06.324, Speaker F: Able to go on AAVE or compound.
00:24:06.404 - 00:24:08.716, Speaker B: Or also like list on a centralized exchange.
00:24:08.820 - 00:24:10.956, Speaker F: Like now they're being able to have.
00:24:10.980 - 00:24:17.354, Speaker B: A money market on beta finance. And so this unlocks a way for them to naturally have a way for.
00:24:17.394 - 00:24:19.642, Speaker F: Their token holders to stake their assets.
00:24:19.818 - 00:24:49.300, Speaker B: In order to earn yield rather than just letting it sit in their wallets. And so you can imagine that tokens that are more volatile, such as maybe like index tokens that are having more trouble getting listed on AAVE and compound, as well as new and up and coming projects that are just being created the same way that they always create a uniswap ETH pair in order to facilitate liquidity on a Dex.
00:24:49.412 - 00:24:51.252, Speaker F: We want them to also be creating.
00:24:51.308 - 00:24:55.820, Speaker B: A money market on beta finance in order to facilitate lending and borrowing of.
00:24:55.852 - 00:24:57.012, Speaker F: Their token as well.
00:24:57.148 - 00:25:28.560, Speaker E: Got it? Got it. And you speak about these other projects as well. So I think it's a great segue to talk about the competition in this space. And there's so many ways to tackle this question as well, because for the shorting side you have trading protocols like perpetux, and then for the borrowing side you have compound and aave, you have things like Ram refuse and sushi kashi. I think that the most pertinent one is probably the permissionless borrowing pools. So can you talk about what differentiates beta from things like rarifuse or sushikashi?
00:25:28.672 - 00:25:47.108, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So rarifuse and sushikashi have different kind of risk models from beta rarity. Fuse uses an isolated pool model and sushi uses an isolated pair model, while we use an isolated chiral model. And so what that means is with rarifuse, you can imagine it as like.
00:25:47.156 - 00:25:49.532, Speaker F: Multiple mini compound markets.
00:25:49.668 - 00:25:55.148, Speaker B: But what this results in is there's like a lot of fragmentation in terms of like, the lending APY, as well.
00:25:55.156 - 00:25:58.196, Speaker F: As like, where liquidity is on the protocol.
00:25:58.300 - 00:25:59.836, Speaker B: Like, you have to navigate to different.
00:25:59.900 - 00:26:02.864, Speaker F: Pools in order to say like, borrow USDC.
00:26:03.574 - 00:26:56.840, Speaker B: As like, different pools will have variable lending APY. And I've seen that differentiate as much as 30%. Like, one Rari fuse pool had like 30% APY on USDC at one point, while another had like 2%. And so as a lender on Rari, you're concerned about where you have to like move your assets all the time in order to maximize your yields. And the same problem exists for, like, sushis Kashi, because there's like this fragmented pair model, I'm sorry, isolated pair model, it results in a lot of fragmentation. So you can see you might have like a USDC die pair, ETH die pair, a USDC perp pair, a USDC alpha pair. And what this results in is there's a lot of different apys for the USDC token, depending on which pair you've.
00:26:56.872 - 00:26:58.764, Speaker F: Deposited your liquidity into.
00:26:59.264 - 00:27:06.920, Speaker B: And then again, you have this problem of having to move your tokens around all the time, which results in a lot of gas fees and is not.
00:27:06.952 - 00:27:08.568, Speaker F: Really feasible as a lender.
00:27:08.736 - 00:27:11.080, Speaker B: And in comparison, on beta, we only.
00:27:11.112 - 00:27:13.600, Speaker F: Have one pool for lended tokens.
00:27:13.712 - 00:27:31.436, Speaker B: So as a lender, you always know that you're earning the maximal possible yield on your tokens as well. And on the flip side, you can think of this as very similar for the borrower, where they have to evaluate which pool or which pair they should borrow the token from in order to.
00:27:31.500 - 00:27:33.788, Speaker F: Minimize the amount of interest that they have to pay.
00:27:33.916 - 00:27:54.596, Speaker B: Whereas on beta, you know that you're earning the maximal possible. I mean, you're paying the minimal possible borrow apy on those tokens. And this also makes it easier to track when you're, things, say, when you're doing like a short position, because there's greater liquidity in this pool, rather than having this like fragmentation of liquidity that.
00:27:54.620 - 00:27:56.826, Speaker F: You see on rarifuse and sushikashi.
00:27:56.940 - 00:28:14.918, Speaker E: Yeah, thanks for the breakdown. And speaking of one pool, obviously compound and AavE is a bit closer in their kind of borrowing or lending model to beta, and in that every asset is one singular pool instead of kind of in different pairs or separated markets. So what differentiates beta from compound and aave today?
00:28:15.006 - 00:28:19.798, Speaker B: Yeah, so this comes down to the collateral model. AAVE and compound use a cross collateralization.
00:28:19.886 - 00:28:23.254, Speaker F: Model while beta uses an isolated collateral model.
00:28:23.374 - 00:28:27.814, Speaker B: And that's really what allows us to on board more risky assets while they're.
00:28:27.854 - 00:28:29.046, Speaker F: Unable to do that.
00:28:29.190 - 00:29:12.740, Speaker B: And so, for example, as you know, with compound, you can select multiple assets to use as collateral, and compound will automatically, like, liquidate your collateral if your position goes underwater. But this also results in a problem where like, say, if your position goes like majorly underwater in a short period of time, like, say, your token that you borrowed like three x's in value in 30 minutes, which might be common for a token such as shiba, and suddenly you're very, very underwater. And the price, oracle wasn't able to pick that up in time, then not only would say your ETH be liquidated.
00:29:12.852 - 00:29:16.220, Speaker F: But also all your USDC, all your.
00:29:16.252 - 00:29:18.132, Speaker B: Dai, all your other collateral that's on.
00:29:18.148 - 00:29:20.180, Speaker F: The protocol could be liquidated as well.
00:29:20.332 - 00:29:22.460, Speaker B: And so this kind of exposes you.
00:29:22.492 - 00:29:25.796, Speaker F: To unlimited liability, whereas on beta you.
00:29:25.820 - 00:29:28.476, Speaker B: Have a limited liability, meaning that only.
00:29:28.540 - 00:29:30.572, Speaker F: The amount of collateral you associate with.
00:29:30.588 - 00:29:35.692, Speaker B: A position is liable to be liquidated. All the other collateral that you have.
00:29:35.708 - 00:29:38.036, Speaker F: On the protocol is safe from liquidation.
00:29:38.220 - 00:29:40.156, Speaker B: And so we really limit the liability.
00:29:40.220 - 00:29:42.684, Speaker F: Of the user in terms of risk.
00:29:42.844 - 00:30:16.420, Speaker E: Yeah, that's really clever. And I think that that's a huge topic in centralized exchanges as well, where binance began with isolated margin for different positions, and then FTX came along and championed this kind of cross collateral model. And it seems like there's a specific type of use case for both types of collateral colorization models. So this is really interesting to break down. And finally, touching on the point about the protocols that people can use to short today already. So things like perpetual protocol or DyDx users are already using those things to short crypto assets. So why should they use beta as well?
00:30:16.532 - 00:30:49.226, Speaker B: Yeah, so Dydx perpetual, they're both, um, shorting future futures or like perpetual futures contracts. And so that's more of like a proxy to the underlying token rather than actually having a direct impact on the price. And whereas on beta, you're actually spot selling the token, so it will actually be sold on a Dex and have an impact on the price to decrease it, rather than just like trying to like kind of speculate on what direction the token is moving, as is the.
00:30:49.250 - 00:30:51.970, Speaker F: Case with DyDX as well as perp.
00:30:52.122 - 00:30:57.602, Speaker B: And additionally being able to short a perpetual futures contract, we still need a.
00:30:57.618 - 00:30:59.922, Speaker F: Robust price feed on the token, which.
00:30:59.938 - 00:31:13.866, Speaker B: Is why we don't see them with all the tokens that are available in DeFi to be shorted. As a perpetual contract, we mostly see the same tokens that exist on centralized exchanges to be shorted exist on perp.
00:31:13.930 - 00:31:16.226, Speaker F: And dy DX to be shorted as well.
00:31:16.370 - 00:31:29.574, Speaker B: And so there are additionally a lot more options for what tokens you can short on beta finance compared to these perpetual features, or, sorry, compared to these like futures derivatives protocols.
00:31:30.154 - 00:32:04.026, Speaker E: Got it. Yeah, that seemed like for Perp and DyDX they're focusing more on kind of large cap liquid pairs. But if we want to go into the long tail of assets that have a tendency to have exponential runs, which in turn makes it more attractive to short, we might have to go to beta finance. So this makes a lot of sense. And I think in the last part of our discussion, I'd love to zoom out a bit and just look at the future of beta as well. So can you, to the extent that you're comfortable, talk a little bit about major developments that are on the pipeline or features that you're most excited for in the future?
00:32:04.210 - 00:32:36.938, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So we're still very early right now in terms of the product development at beta Finance, and there's still so much left to do. But ultimately you want to become the money market protocol, the permissionless money market protocol for lending, borrowing and shorting assets. So if anyone wants to thinks about shorting some token in Defi, they'll think of beta finance. And as I mentioned, just as everyone who creates a token must have a uniswap or CGSwap pair, we want there to be a beta finance money market.
00:32:36.986 - 00:32:38.338, Speaker F: For that token as well.
00:32:38.506 - 00:33:31.516, Speaker B: And for now, what we've done is we've built these new financial legos in DeFi that have opened up a lot of opportunities for expansion and extension of new products. And so some of the improvements we have in the pipeline for the protocol are, for example, improving the risk configuration, the insurance pool, the interest rate model, etcetera, as well as on the front end Dapp, incorporating things like alert notifications, onboarding more assets of interest to the main page, incorporating better Dex aggregation for splitting swaps for larger trades, et cetera. And we're also looking to launch on additional chains or L2 s where gas fees are lower in order to facilitate higher frequency of trading activity as well as make it more accessible to the smaller user. And aside from these, we think there are some interesting, say, derivative products that.
00:33:31.540 - 00:33:32.836, Speaker F: Could be built on top of beta.
00:33:32.860 - 00:33:44.340, Speaker B: Finance, such as a delta neutral farming product or a basis trading tool. And we think that these would be interesting ways to leverage the underlying financial.
00:33:44.412 - 00:33:45.820, Speaker F: Legos that we built right now to.
00:33:45.852 - 00:33:53.064, Speaker B: Build kind of like a higher level abstraction protocol such as what we see with, say, ribbon finance.
00:33:53.414 - 00:33:55.518, Speaker F: Um, been built on top of a.
00:33:55.526 - 00:34:04.286, Speaker B: Lot of option protocols such as like oped. And so, yeah, we have a lot of ideas for where bidding finance will go in the future, and these are just a few of the ones that.
00:34:04.310 - 00:34:05.766, Speaker F: Are in our focus right now.
00:34:05.910 - 00:34:16.430, Speaker B: But there's still, like many years to come for our products and we hope that everyone in the community joins us as well as stays along with us for this journey. Yeah.
00:34:16.462 - 00:34:27.795, Speaker E: And on that note, I think that's a great segue to talking about how can people stay up to date with beta finance. So if they want to follow you or try out beta Finance, keep up to date with the latest. What are the best channels for them to do this?
00:34:27.899 - 00:34:36.211, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So our website is betafinance.org and you should go to our Twitter, which is beta Finance.
00:34:36.347 - 00:34:38.619, Speaker F: We post all our main announcements through.
00:34:38.651 - 00:34:46.203, Speaker B: Twitter first, as well as we have a link tree to all our website links as well as our social links.
00:34:46.243 - 00:34:49.131, Speaker F: For you to stay updated through other social channels as well.
00:34:49.267 - 00:34:53.387, Speaker E: Sounds good. Well, this has been wonderful. Thank you so much for taking the time, Ellen. This is really fun.
00:34:53.475 - 00:34:55.036, Speaker B: Thanks, Jason. It's been great speaking with.
