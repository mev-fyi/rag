00:00:00.360 - 00:00:32.525, Speaker A: Here in our market, Deepin is just far and away a better way to skin the cat than trying to do it in a centralized way. You're getting the coverage much faster. You're getting it actually in a more sustainable way. One of the things we get a lot about feedback from our Web2 customers is they really like the fact that if there is a coverage gap that they can fill it, they can add a node and that node will seamlessly, automatically be added to the network. And they don't have to do anything, they don't have to think about it. We get questions like, well, what do I do to need to activate it? Guess what? You don't have to do anything to activate it. You put it there.
00:00:32.525 - 00:00:40.333, Speaker A: 24 hours later, if you installed it correctly, it will be in service and running. I didn't touch anything. The customer didn't touch anything. It's all automatic.
00:00:40.429 - 00:00:43.029, Speaker B: Web3 offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:43.077 - 00:00:44.861, Speaker A: Our job is to buy great tech at great prices.
00:00:44.933 - 00:00:47.517, Speaker C: AI is also libertarian right enable use.
00:00:47.541 - 00:00:48.837, Speaker B: Case that people haven't been able to.
00:00:48.861 - 00:00:52.965, Speaker A: Do today, the next hundreds of millions of players, they will come to the market through mobile.
00:00:53.045 - 00:01:29.433, Speaker B: My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next 12 months is blockcrunch is not a licensed financial advisor and is purely for informational and entertainment purposes only. All opinions are personal and the show may discuss assets that the host or guests have positions in or may be actively buying or selling. All investments carry risk, so consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions. Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the blockcrunch podcast. I'm your host Jason Choi. I'm the co founder of the prop investing vehicle Tangent. Now one of my main thesis at Tangent is that crypto is actually not that good for many things.
00:01:29.433 - 00:02:13.771, Speaker B: It often makes apps clunkier, it makes them more expensive, and compared to Web2 apps, they're often very difficult in onboarding new users. Now, however, there's one thing that is uniquely good for crypto and that is coordinating hardware and resources. Now in fact, if you drill down to first principles, that's exactly what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is little more than a network of computers coordinated across many countries to cooperate in maintaining a digital store of value over many, many years. And that concept of coordinating hardware is what I think can be extended to many other use cases. Now, over the past few years, some investors have started to call this D pin, short for decentralized physical infrastructure. And Tangent has been quite active in investing in this vertical.
00:02:13.771 - 00:03:07.187, Speaker B: And one company that took this concept of depin, applied it to a real world problem and is actually making money doing it kind of behind the scenes is called Geonet, which Tangent is an investor in. Now Geodnet is building the world's largest real time kinematics network. We're going to dig into exactly what that means, but just to give a little bit of context, many of us probably use GPS every day. I use Google Maps every single day to figure out where I'm going because I'm horrible at finding directions. Now to put it simply, what Geonet is building is a network that improves the accuracy of GPS by a hundred x. It might not be very relevant for people like me, but apparently for massive industries like agriculture, drones, self driving cars, robotics, it's a crucial use case. So to figure out how they're doing this, how big this opportunity is, as well as really grill down to some of the common ailments with Deepin networks, I'm really excited to have their founder Mike Horton on the show today.
00:03:07.187 - 00:03:51.813, Speaker B: Now as a disclaimer, Tangent does hold God tokens, which is the native network token for Geodnet. Hey everybody, welcome back to another episode of the blockcrunch podcast. Now one of the main thesis that I have at Tangent, which is my prop investing vehicle, is that crypto is actually not that good at many things. It often makes apps clunkier, it's more expensive than many free web2 apps as a backend and onboarding is quite difficult. However, there's one thing that is uniquely good at and that is coordinating resources and hardware. In fact, if you drill down to first principles, Bitcoin is little more than a network of computers coordinated across many countries to cooperate in maintaining a digital store of value over many years. And that concept of coordinating hardware is something that I think can be extended to many other use cases.
00:03:51.813 - 00:04:26.811, Speaker B: So a lot of people over the past few years have called this phenomenon dpin, short for decentralized physical infrastructure. And one company that took this concept of depin, applied it to a real world company, real world problem, and is actually making money doing it is geodnet, which Tangent is an investor in. Now Geodnet is building the world's largest real time kinematics network. Now many of us use GPS every day. I use GPS every day on my Google Maps or when you're driving. Now to put it simply, Junet wants to improve the accuracy of your GPS by 100x. So today to figure out how they're doing this, you know why crypto is involved here.
00:04:26.811 - 00:04:33.843, Speaker B: I'm really excited to have their founder, Mike Horton on the show. And as a disclaimer, Tangent holds geo tokens. So, Mike, welcome to the show, man.
00:04:34.019 - 00:04:35.923, Speaker A: Thank you, Jason. Great to be here.
00:04:35.979 - 00:04:54.775, Speaker B: Absolutely. Now, I know most listeners are probably not familiar with terms like RTK or gnss, but you've built a career in that field. Field. So can you kind of start by giving us some context about what is the problem you're tackling and kind of maybe a little bit of backstory about your career as well and how that led you to this point?
00:04:54.855 - 00:05:17.417, Speaker A: That sounds great, Jason. So, yeah, we all take for granted sometimes certain technologies in our life, and I think GPS is one of those. There was a time before GPS and digital maps, and it kind of sucked. So GPS is an amazing marvel. It consists of satellites that are in orbit that transmit signals. And there's not GPS is actually just the US satellites. They're European satellites.
00:05:17.417 - 00:05:45.139, Speaker A: There's Russian satellites, Chinese satellites. India's building a constellation. Japan has a constellation. So there are a lot of these satellites that are used to help you find out where you are. And there are a lot of technical challenges in making this whole system work. And we don't have to get into all the details, but let's just say one of the key things is there are a bunch of error sources in these signals. And some of those error sources to be corrected need what are called ground reference stations, terrestrial reference stations.
00:05:45.139 - 00:06:16.475, Speaker A: And that's what Geonet is building. It's building and has built the world's largest reference station network. And those reference stations are what allow for this marvelous accuracy improvement. So you may be familiar when you're downtown or when you're under a tree or just anytime you're using GPS. It kind of knows where you are to within 10, 20ft, 2 or 3 meters. What GeoNet does is let that position be as accurate as about the size of a golf ball. So basically, 1-2 cm in x, y and Z and Z is very important in some applications.
00:06:16.475 - 00:07:11.681, Speaker A: And to do that, you have to put these reference stations up. It's like a little antenna you put up on your roof that forms kind of a sensor network that pulls down, sort of scrapes these satellite signals. And Geonet then processes that and redistributes that through its back end as a correction stream that enhances the accuracy of your phone, your car, your drone, industrial equipment, all kinds of applications, which I'm sure we'll get into. I've been in the space of navigation and positioning and kind of autonomous systems that use these types of sensors my whole career. I started a company right out of college called Crossbow Technology, was a pioneer in actually navigation for things like drones. I built that business up, sold it, it was a really nice successful exit. Sold part of the business to a company in China and then another part of the business to an aerospace company in the US and that worked out really well.
00:07:11.681 - 00:07:23.353, Speaker A: So I have a real passion for the thing, for the space, and that's kind of still working. My whole career has been working on that. Still working on many things in the navigation and localization space.
00:07:23.409 - 00:07:49.173, Speaker B: Before I get started, I'm grateful for aptos for sponsoring the show and letting us continue to make this free content for all. So here's Jerome from aptos to tell us a little bit more. Jerome aptos has experienced tremendous growth this year, having doubled its daily active addresses to serving approximately 150,000 users every day and also tripled its TVL to nearly 400 million as of this recording, according to Defi Llama. So can you walk us through Aptos ecosystem and what contributed to this growth?
00:07:49.229 - 00:08:31.224, Speaker C: So what truly sets aptos apart is the builder focused technology. The aptos foundation works really hard to give developers the guidance and support that they need throughout their building process. The Aptos ecosystem is rich with tools, including the recently relaunched aptos Documentation Experience plus aptos Learn, a robust grunts program to help builders take their ideas from zero to launch, and a solid tech foundation that helps developers turn their innovative ideas into reality with ease. Another unique aspect about the aptos ecosystem is how dynamic and inclusive it is. We want to support developers from all over, whether you're a Web2 corporate Web3 native or a budding Web 2.0 enthusiasts. To help Web3 break out of these 20,000 or so devs that the industry has to date, since the start of 2024, nearly 10 million new users have joined Aptos.
00:08:31.224 - 00:08:42.633, Speaker C: At the end of June, Aptos transactions hit over 10.5 million, surpassing a major milestone with over 1 billion total transactions in the network. The milestone underscores the adoption of aptos by a vibrant community.
00:08:42.729 - 00:08:58.019, Speaker B: Thanks, Jerome. Now back to the episode. I'm actually really curious just from a personal level, because it's such a specific problem to get into, but you've been obsessed with this problem for such a long time. You know, what was the initial thing that got you interested in and made you decide, hey, I'm going to do navigation and spend my whole career on this?
00:08:58.147 - 00:09:19.785, Speaker A: Well, actually, so I got into navigation back in college at UC Berkeley. I had really cool advisor, Professor Richard Newton. He was a dean of engineering at UC Berkeley. And he got me onto the idea of actual virtual reality. And he's like, look, you know, people to design computer chips are going to, this is in like 1995. Okay. So he was way, you know, there's early and then there's really early.
00:09:19.785 - 00:10:09.969, Speaker A: He was really early. But people are going to dawn virtual reality glasses to design computer chips and you need to be able to track them very precisely so that they can look around in the space and design things and need this head tracking. And that's what got me into the field of positioning, trying to build head tracking. That led me, that was so early, but that led me into this sort of field of navigation and did quickly when I left school, started this company, Crossbow, that became very well known for building navigation systems, particularly for drones and for early phases of autonomy. Things like actually you may not realize it but like tractors have had semi autonomous capability far longer than cars have because there's a more, there's a bigger payback in farming. So that pioneered that technology, built up that business and that's how I got into it. And there's just a lot of technical challenges.
00:10:09.969 - 00:10:48.267, Speaker A: It's a very deep problem. And one of those problems is this issue with ionospheric and tropospheric errors that cause distortion in the satellite signals when they go from space to earth. And no one's really been able to solve it because it requires a lot of infrastructure. And this is where the miracle of blockchain and deepin really comes in, is it is a great way to build infrastructure quickly and incredibly capitally efficiently. And that's what geodnet has really leveraged to very quickly become the world's largest such network and being used by tons of people every day. And it's just been an amazing ride so far.
00:10:48.371 - 00:11:32.511, Speaker B: Yeah. And I gotta admit, before I started looking into Geodnet, I was completely foreign to this concept of, you know, how GPS even work or how these RTK networks which help refine gps, I didn't even know they existed. And then when I read into it I realized there's a lot of massive industrial use cases from what you're saying. There's drones, there's agriculture, which we'll dig into later, self driving cars. And as these secular trends take off as well, the market's gonna grow bigger. And I think one of the reports that I read mentioned that the current market is already a $3 billion kind of opportunity and that's only gonna get bigger so I'm quite excited about that when I first saw that. And I also know that, you know, before Geonet, when you were first trying to kind of experiment with this idea of building out this network, you probably explored different web2 rails first before you arrived at crypto.
00:11:32.511 - 00:11:39.415, Speaker B: So you know, what were the challenges you faced when you were maybe trying to build something like geodnet outside of crypto and what led you to blockchains?
00:11:39.575 - 00:12:02.911, Speaker A: Yeah, so we did look into doing it in web two. We even made a bit of a progress on that front. And we investigated things like American Tower, Crown Castle, which are cell tower operators. Could we put these stations there? Does extremely expensive and time consuming. And then we looked into like public storage, you know, the self storage units. They're all over the United States. That turned out to be quite expensive.
00:12:02.911 - 00:12:42.701, Speaker A: But you know, we thought it might make some sense. So we did some work towards negotiating leases with these guys. But we realized it would take forever and it isn't. I mean you have to pull your own Internet, you have to get permits. They want it, they want to have a city inspector come on every location and they want drawings for each, each and every location. So you know, you're talking 5, $10,000 of upfront cost per location and another, you know, 5,000 ish a year in rent to do this type of scalable solution. And frankly, you know, that's just not, that's to build out a network of 20, 30,000 nodes which we'd like to get to in the next year or two.
00:12:42.701 - 00:13:19.905, Speaker A: I mean, you're talking about, you know, billions of dollars of capital equipment and capex to do that. And that maybe for something like 5G can be justified and people do that in a centralized way. But when you think about the markets that we're after, a lot of them are developing and so you have a chicken and the egg problem. And what Deepin is really doing is solving that. And then it's giving us a tremendous first mover in moat to build out this infrastructure in a way that's never been built before. And enabling applications like ubiquitous use of drones, consumer robots, better ADAS systems and automobiles. Just a ton of stuff.
00:13:20.285 - 00:13:47.747, Speaker B: Yeah. And I want to make sure our listeners fully understand what you guys are trying to do. So according to the Block Explorer, now there's I think 9200 devices for Geodnet live in 124 countries. So I'd like to go to the point of view of one of these node operators. You know, let's say I go on a Geonet website. I purchased one of those antennas that you just showed on screen and then I set it up. What happens, what happens to the data? How do I get paid through that? What is the whole lifecycle?
00:13:47.851 - 00:14:35.357, Speaker A: Yeah, so the first thing before you buy the node, you should check the geodnet console map to see if you have a good spot to deploy it. We divide the world into hexes and there's a definite first mover advantage into a hex. If you've got the node and you set it up and it's well established, you can earn what we call a location nft which will preserve your right to mine that location at the full rewards rate. Whereas if multiple people come into the hex later, they're going to split rewards. So it's really great to first figure out, hey, do I got a spot? Where is the hex? Already got a couple miners in it. Is there already a location NFT holder? Then maybe you don't want to mine that location, but if you have a good spot to put it, yeah, you purchase the equipment from one of the Geonet distributors. There are about 13 of them and they have hardware and can get it to you quickly.
00:14:35.357 - 00:15:13.680, Speaker A: Then you set it up. It needs to be on a rooftop, a clear sky view, stable Internet, stable power, doesn't use a ton of data, but it does need to upload data continuously and so you need to have that stable Internet connection and it uploads about 10 to 15 gigabytes a month on a second by second basis. And our customers really value consistency of data flow because it is a real time solution. So that's critical to your earnings. You'll start earning tokens, the current schedule. If you have a good performing station in your hex and you're the first mover, have this location NFT. You'll earn 24 tokens per day.
00:15:13.680 - 00:15:46.543, Speaker A: Current token price is $0.15. You can do the math. Stations cost about $700 so it's a decent to quick ROI depending on your point of view. And you know the network, as people use the network, the services are paid for in fiat, but that fiat is immediately converted to God tokens. So it's effectively buying back God from the open market all the time as people use the service. And 80% of that buyback is burnt, meaning it's pulled out of circulation. So it's a very strongly deflationary protocol.
00:15:46.543 - 00:16:13.845, Speaker A: We also have an annual halving. So as the network grows we're very mindful of, you know, having too much inflation. This is a very long term project that people want this network to be there for decades to come. The users who use these types of services are there very much for the long term. And so it's really important that we have the tokenomics set up in a way that's going to create stable growth. And we've tried very hard to design the protocol in that way.
00:16:14.265 - 00:16:45.287, Speaker B: And I really love it when businesses kind of come to crypto because of commercial necessities and not because they want to build something in crypto. And I think Geonet is really an example where you guys looked at all of the Web2 alternatives and just from cost perspective it just made no sense to do this in Web two. And I also love that you guys even explored the idea of NFTs to secure the locational rights for node operators. So you kind of already touched on this question, but what parts of the Geonet network actually lives on the blockchain today? Do we really need a blockchain for the network to operate?
00:16:45.351 - 00:17:38.923, Speaker A: Yeah, and I'd like to highlight there's an operational cost benefit, there's a sustainability benefit and there's also a speed benefit trying to deploy infrastructure, particularly in the western world where a lot of the market is for these services today. Super slow and time consuming. And the deep end has really shown that you can build real world infrastructure quickly. And this is like, you know, it's like roads, you build infrastructure and business comes. And so I think that that should not be lost upon people that this is real physical infrastructure, it's a real moat and it really creates a lot of downstream economic opportunity for people who build on top of Geonet or who just use geography in their business. And I think people really see that and have come onto our network in terms of using the blockchain. You wouldn't be able to build a Deepin without blockchain.
00:17:38.923 - 00:18:46.497, Speaker A: So this is really nice that this infrastructure has been built to sort of secure and allow Deepin to exist. And we're using a lot of different aspects. We use obviously the token system and the blockchain to distribute rewards to people. And we're distributing rewards on a daily basis, which is if you were to try to do wire transfers to 124 different countries and 9,000 or you know, call it 5,000, say average person has two miners maybe in two locations, but whatever, you know, between five and 10,000 people every day. I mean your costs and would be absolutely astronomical to try to transfer that kind of payments across the world to people for, for running these stations. On top of that we Use a location NFT to really secure the geometry of the network, to ensure that we have a well structured, well formed network. A network that's got a whole lot of concentration of nodes in one area and then nothing anywhere else or big gaps that is exponentially less valuable than a well formed, well structured, robust network.
00:18:46.497 - 00:19:25.081, Speaker A: And that is very top of mind for customers is what is the coverage, what is the redundancy? And we address that better than any network on the planet today. So that's a huge, huge selling point for us. And the NFT system I think has really encouraged that. And then another aspect that we use is staking. And we use staking to create highly incentivized regions and to essentially lock some amount of tokens to allow a region to have more token incentive in the early days to promote coverage in places that are harder to cover. We need that even coverage that's crucial. And there are locations and areas that are just simply harder to deploy to.
00:19:25.081 - 00:19:45.199, Speaker A: And so we need a decentralized way to create a dynamic balance in the rewards. And we don't want to just try to do that through fully centralized planning. That's not the right way to do it. We need to let the market respond. And staking gives us a mechanism to do that. And we call those our staked super hexes. And that has worked extremely well as well.
00:19:45.199 - 00:20:03.891, Speaker A: So we're using a blockchain in many different ways. And of course when the service is used, tokens are acquired to use the service. So that I think really the whole business is run on the blockchain. And from a fundamental point of view, without that technology you would not be able to do geodnet.
00:20:04.043 - 00:20:20.913, Speaker B: Yeah, so we talked about the customers a few times. So I'm curious, like, who are some of the examples of big buyers for this type of data that these geonet antennas are providing? Is it like, you know, is it GPS providers? Is it agricultural use cases? You know, what are some, some, some of the things that you can help highlight?
00:20:20.969 - 00:20:37.369, Speaker A: We can start off with drones. That's a pretty neat application. So all DJI enterprise drones support rtk. We have a lot of users who use DJI drones. We recently were just at the Drone Show Commercial UAV Expo in Las Vegas. We had two customer announcements there. One of them was Propeller.
00:20:37.369 - 00:21:27.037, Speaker A: They do a lot of, provide a lot of equipment and services for people who run drones on construction sites to monitor the progress of construction. Very successful business. We also do a lot of work in agriculture, you mentioned that. So we have a partnership with several different Companies that sell, including, I mean all the top three tractor makers, have tractors that will work with the Geonet network. And we recently have a announced a partnership with the usda. USDA installed a node, validated that it works well and is now working to show smaller farmers who've maybe not had access to precision farming equipment the benefits of using precision technology to reduce input costs, save labor. And the fact that this network can be, you know, the nodes can be installed by the farmer themselves is a big help.
00:21:27.037 - 00:21:51.139, Speaker A: We have a dealer in North America that sells a lot of precision ag equipment. They've installed about 200 nodes in the last season and help bring coverage to a lot of rural locations. So that market has gone super well. Automotive. As we talked about, these automated driving assistance systems, that's adas. ADAS do use a lot of sensors. They can use a radar, a lidar, cameras.
00:21:51.139 - 00:22:43.241, Speaker A: GNSS is also a very important sensor, especially for areas where there's no HD maps and things like that. They will use high accuracy GNSS to stay in lane and to provide better control inputs because you know, three, five meters of air to a self driving system or to even an assisted driving system is way too big. So we have a great partner there and a company called Binav which is supplying a lot of the modules into that marketplace. They're like a tier 2 automotive supplier and we've been very successful in building up that relationship. IoT is a huge field. We sell through Quetel which is the world's largest maker of IoT modems and IoT modules and they have been a long term geodnet partner in the space of mowers. We have Verde AI that's launching a consumer oriented RTK mower.
00:22:43.241 - 00:23:20.131, Speaker A: We have Sensory Robotics that's servicing commercial landscapers with fleets of robots. We also have partners in survey and then we do sell data on a wholesale basis back to other market participants, other companies in the GNSS ecosystem, including four semiconductor companies that make GPS chips. So it's a pretty broad range. I think we have over 30 signed business partnerships. A lot of those are just starting to monetize. So I think we have, you know, pretty proven track record now that people like our product and that it is filling a really important need in the GPS community.
00:23:20.323 - 00:23:58.737, Speaker B: Yeah, it's actually really rare to hear that in crypto because the crypto economy is so circular that a lot of the paying customers are just other crypto companies paying crypto info projects. So to hear that there's like 30 customers and I think from what you mentioned there's drones or self driving cars, there's agriculture. It's actually very unprecedented in crypto and quite exciting to hear. And the one thing you mentioned just now is that to use the network you do require the token. I'd imagine that for some of these companies that might not be very open to crypto at all. It might be difficult for them to go on an exchange or go on a decentralized Exchange, buy the GeoToken and pay for the network. They might try to pay for things with the corporate credit card or just a bank wire.
00:23:58.737 - 00:24:00.033, Speaker B: So is that still supported?
00:24:00.089 - 00:24:40.553, Speaker A: It's still supported, but it's supported through our Web2 partners. So you can think of the GEOD business model as B to B to C or B to B to professional end user. So the foundation engages with parties that are essentially resellers or wholesalers of the data, or wholesale users of the data. And that makes that problem a lot easier. Even then we've had to help customers get through that and we see that as reasonable at this time. But we will get everything fully decentralized in 2025. We've built now a decentralized piece of software that lets people who don't have any capability or any knowledge at all to just accept PayPal payments on their website.
00:24:40.553 - 00:25:12.115, Speaker A: So I'm selling a drone and I want to include RTK subscription. With the drone they can have a button that's buy geodnet. It will then transact through PayPal and then call the Uniswap API to buy back the tokens. And they can run that all on their own premises. So that's something we haven't gotten that fully integrated yet. But we're doing everything we can to make that barrier as low as possible people while still preserving the decentralization. And you know, I think not all Deepen projects have different views on full decentralization.
00:25:12.115 - 00:25:55.591, Speaker A: We do want to get to 100% full decentralization certainly by the end of 2025. I think it's very important to establish that the censorship resistance and the long term security of the protocol I think is actually much stronger and in a fully decentralized manner. And it's actually a benefit to our customers in the sense that it creates additional trust that this is like DNS, right? DNS is a great example of a decentralized protocol that really powers the whole Internet. We see our protocol as powering GPS and powering next generation GPS services. People do not really want that to be in a centralized format. And so I think that Full decentralization is a very important part of our roadmap.
00:25:55.703 - 00:26:30.965, Speaker B: Therein lies another opportunity for the founders listening as well, I think payments and an extraction of payments for businesses that allow protocols to accept fiat payments and then convert that fiat payment to the native protocol token. That's something that I think is untapped or at least underserved for a lot of businesses that we talk to as well. Now, Mike, you mentioned a lot about other depin projects. I'd like to zoom out a bit and talk about just depin as a concept, as a whole, because one of the common critiques for DePin is that the networks often are used to bootstrap supply side. Right. You mentioned that it's cheaper to bootstrap supply side. And a lot of the networks do this with token incentives.
00:26:30.965 - 00:26:47.645, Speaker B: And because the costs for node operators are denominated in dollars, they're basically forced to sell the token continually. So this basically means a lot of the Deepen networks are not very sustainable from an economic perspective. So how do you think about the sustainability of GeoNet?
00:26:47.765 - 00:27:20.193, Speaker A: Deepen projects have getting smarter. So I think that there has been an evolution and I think there was too much supply too quick, without enough paying attention to the demand side. And that was probably pushed on by certain market dynamics and things. But there's been a lot of learning. And geodnet, I think, has been at the cutting edge of helping pioneer more sustainable tokenomics in Deepen. And we think that's super critical. We need the network to operate for a long time and for decades.
00:27:20.193 - 00:27:56.931, Speaker A: And so it needs to be sustainable. I think that, you know, so you gotta design the tokenomics. Well, I think that if you look at the way Web2 companies did this, and I know, I hate to kind of go back in time, but the basic strategy of building up something like an Airbnb is you build a little bit of supply, then you build a little bit of demand, you build a little bit of supply, you build a little bit of demand. Takes a little bit of time, but it is network affecting. It is spiraling. The more, you know, great properties that are on the market in a certain city, the more people want to come in and stay in Airbnb. And then that creates an economic cycle and then expands, I feel a little bit.
00:27:56.931 - 00:28:35.035, Speaker A: Geodnet has designed its tokenomics to be a little bit closer to that than, let's just fricking, you know, build as much supply as possible without any demand. We've been cognizant of that. We've, you know, structured the Network in a way to create reasonable coverage. And we've been fortunate that the markets where Deepen is the strongest, which is Western Europe, even some of Eastern Europe's been incredibly great for us, Turkey, Romania and then the United States. These are the early adopters of Deepen. This is also where the biggest market needs are in the correction services. Right now in the US is an incredible market need.
00:28:35.035 - 00:29:05.269, Speaker A: So that's been nice because as we've built up supply, we've also had the demand there to build up. And I think some deepen networks may face a steeper climb in that where it's harder to kind of, you've got to have all the infrastructure before there's any demand. But to the extent possible, I think it's good to follow that model. Build up some supply, build up some demand, build up some supply, build up some demand, and pretty soon, before you know it, you know, in two years now we have the biggest network on earth and we have a great backlog and pipeline of customers to use it.
00:29:05.317 - 00:29:39.593, Speaker B: Yeah, and I'd love to drill down a bit on the unit economics perspective because another common question that people have for deepen networks is how can a decentralized network possibly offer lower costs in terms of services to end users than centralized companies? Because Business 101, we were taught back in business school is this concept of economies of scale. Once you have a big centralized company, you can offload a lot of the initial capex. So can you briefly go over that concept of economies of scale versus efficiency gains in decentralization and does geodnet offer a cheaper service than centralized incumbents? And if so, how is that possible?
00:29:39.729 - 00:30:19.243, Speaker A: Operating cost of GeoNet is just much lower than the centralized and that comes from the fact that you need geographic decentralization. So I think Geonet fits into a class at Deepin that fundamentally needs decentralization. You cannot have. If I put 100 nodes on one roof, it's absolutely useless. I have to have this physical decentralization. I think those networks that have a geospatial element, such as Geonet, such as maybe a mapping network, such as maybe some of the DY projects, I do think they have structural advantages over the centralized competitors that are super sustainable. If you look at something like GPUs, it's harder.
00:30:19.243 - 00:30:52.949, Speaker A: I don't understand that market as well. I haven't studied it super well. I know there's value propositions there, but they're a little bit less intuitive because I do think, yeah, I mean, if you're building a day There's a real reason to build a data center. There's a reason people do that, to get all the network bandwidth between all the machines. So that's something to think about. Where I think that question, it's less obvious and you have to dig into the subtleties more here in our market, Deepin is just far and away a better way to skin the cat than trying to do it in a centralized way. You're getting the coverage much faster.
00:30:52.949 - 00:31:14.359, Speaker A: You're getting it actually in a more sustainable way. One of the things we get a lot about feedback from our Web2 customers is they really like the fact that if there is a coverage gap that they can fill it. They can add a node and that node will seamlessly, automatically be added to the network. They don't have to do anything. They don't have to think about it. We get a question like, well, what do I do to need to activate it? Guess what? You don't have to do anything to activate it. You put it there.
00:31:14.359 - 00:31:33.343, Speaker A: 24 hours later, if you installed it correctly, it will be in service and running. I didn't touch anything. The customer didn't touch anything. It's all automatic. You put it in and if somebody moves a node, it will be automatically, instantly removed from the network. So all this stuff is automated through the protocol. That's kind of like the analogy of DNS.
00:31:33.343 - 00:31:51.235, Speaker A: It's kind of this marvelous piece of infrastructure that just works and that creates. It's just a huge advantage over trying to do a centralized deployment and a centralized commissioning of nodes. It has major structural cost coverage capability advantages over the traditional solution.
00:31:51.775 - 00:32:21.719, Speaker B: Yeah. So interesting that the business necessity in this case requires decentralization. Like you mentioned, not all deepen networks are created equal. I think a lot of the networks might actually benefit from being a little bit more centralized, but not in the case of geospatial networks. And I find that quite interesting because There is a Web2 company that is a centralized company, as far as I know, called Trimble, that seems to be tackling a similar issue as well. So how is a centralized company tackling this geospatial problem differently than something like Geonet?
00:32:21.847 - 00:32:46.765, Speaker A: Yeah, so what they try to do is they install receivers, they rent locations. Some of the locations will be like at their dealers. It's been super hard to scale for those networks. We did a study. There are three major traditional Web two companies in the space. There's Trimble, Hexagon, which owns a company called Leica, and Novatel, both which are in it, and Topcon. We've studied their networks and they've worked at it for a long time.
00:32:46.765 - 00:33:19.475, Speaker A: So they have a lot of nodes. They each have about 5,000 ish nodes out there, roughly speaking. But if you look into a lot of these networks because they've been deployed over so many different years, there can be variations in what kind of receivers they have in different locations and antennas. There's a lot of non idealities that have come and it's just taken a very long time and been very expensive. And there's an inflection point also going on in the market. There's a lot more demand. I mean we're coming up on an age where I saw Elon Musk quoted the other day saying there are going to be 20 billion robots.
00:33:19.475 - 00:34:01.929, Speaker A: And I think there's some truth to that. I think we all have like what, five iOS or Android devices, depending on which camp we're in per person. You're going to have a bunch of robots, you're going to have this sort of autonomy age is coming and geodnet's there to serve it. So there's an inflection point in demand, there's an inflection point in the need for coverage and capacity of these networks to support all the different customers and use cases. And so there's a big element of timing. The geodnet is building this infrastructure at the right time in the market cycle to really kind of light the fire behind a lot of these autonomous applications. I also mentioned augmented reality and some of the things that people are going to do on smartphones going forward.
00:34:01.929 - 00:34:32.683, Speaker A: We power some pretty cool experiences on the smartphone. We have a mobile SDK coming out towards the end of the year that will allow people to integrate into traditional apps like Uber and Lyft, but also new kinds of gaming applications where you can really take advantage of the high precision geospatial spatial location. We recently created a partnership with Animoca Brands that that will help, you know, leverage that SDK into actual Web three gaming experiences that can take advantage of super precise location for geocaching, for move to earn type of things.
00:34:32.739 - 00:34:55.807, Speaker B: Just a lot of cool stuff that's exciting. And speaking of these partnerships, the one you mentioned that I was quite interested in was the partnership with U.S. department of Agriculture. So I think for people outside of the US you're probably your only contact point of USDA is probably when you buy stakes. You see that label kind of certification from usda. But what are they looking for with Geonet? Like what are they doing with you guys?
00:34:55.951 - 00:35:39.413, Speaker A: Yeah, so they Reached out to us, put up a node. We helped them connect with another company that provides an automated steering kit that they've tested out. Their primary focus, we're working with the Small Farms Research center and their primary focus is to enable smaller farmers, in terms of the amount of land that they're managing, to actually benefit from precision agriculture. So in the United States, about one third of farmers use precision agriculture. That could be automated drones for spraying, it could be auto guidance systems for harvesting all different types. Spraying is a very, very typical application to use automated guidance. These systems have been pretty expensive.
00:35:39.413 - 00:36:12.705, Speaker A: With geodnet that becomes very economical. And so they're looking to see more farmers adopt these precision agricultural practices. And Cgonet is something that's making that more accessible. Give you a comparison retail price for a professional Geodnet subscription, $400 per year. This is for professional applications, not sort of consumer ones. Competing services are five to even up to 10 times as expensive in the United States. So it is a big enabler to bring the cost down.
00:36:12.705 - 00:36:41.637, Speaker A: And these practices are sustainable. They use less chemicals, they use less labor. So these are all things that the government wants to encourage and they're going to go through. The announcement was just the first step. There's some follow on steps that will be happening later in the year that will help actually make it even easier for farmers to see the benefit of it. And there'll be some, some data that comes out and some other activities are going on that we're really, really excited about. We've had great traction even without USDA support.
00:36:41.637 - 00:37:21.375, Speaker A: We've already had tremendous traction in ag in the United States, in the central part of the United States, the Southeast, and also in California. We've also had very good traction in ag in Europe and in Eastern Europe. So this market is one that I think is more cost sensitive than I even realized going in. There is a lot of cost sen sensitivity there and there's a lot of desire I think in that market to kind of take a bit more control of the solutions so that they're not completely dependent on, you know, paying a subscription fee. And this is the, this is sort of the structure that's provided to you. You have to do it this way. That isn't really what we're seeing in the ag market.
00:37:21.375 - 00:37:56.549, Speaker A: We're seeing a lot of guys who actually want to participate. NGO now run the station at their farm. That that gives them an actually an additional sense of trust in the data because they're using the machines in automated ways. If the machine goes off the rails, it affects their, can damage their crop. So it's a pretty mission critical part of their operations and having that decentralized solution, they really, really like it. There's a number of videos on our YouTube channel, interviews with actually some of the farmers themselves talking about it and you can really see that they really like it. They really, really like it.
00:37:56.687 - 00:37:59.737, Speaker B: And I guess switching over to the crypto native side a little bit.
00:37:59.801 - 00:38:00.001, Speaker A: Mike.
00:38:00.033 - 00:38:10.089, Speaker B: So I noticed that you guys are built on Polygon. I'm curious like how that came to be and have you guys explored other chains as well? What are the considerations that go into deciding where do I build this deepen network?
00:38:10.257 - 00:38:45.709, Speaker A: Well, I think for us Polygon made a lot of sense. It was low cost and reliable and those are the two kind of most important aspects we want. The service to the blockchain is incredibly critical part of the infrastructure, but not one that we want to think about very much. So the cost, speed, reliability and Polygon has fit that bill. Now meanwhile, I think Solana has developed an incredible deepen ecosystem with some great network effects. There's a number of projects that are being built in Solana that want to use geodnet for proof of location. Wingbits is a good example that we're working with them.
00:38:45.709 - 00:39:23.927, Speaker A: We're going to have a dual node that tracks, does flight tracking as well as rtk. Natix is another project that we're working a lot with that's also on Solana. So these projects that are in Solana, they need to use geodnet, they need to burn Geodnet tokens. So it's much more convenient to be in that network. So we are at token 2049. We'll be opening up a bridge through wormhole to allow people to do what's called a native token transfer NT NTT protocol back and forth between the God on Solana and God on Polygon. So we'll be in both ecosystems.
00:39:23.927 - 00:39:44.135, Speaker A: We'll actually be the first protocol to use to do a Solana to Polygon bridge with NTT through wormhole. So that's going to be really flexible. It's the most modern protocol on wormhole for doing the bridging and we're really excited to see that start. Just we're in beta with it, we'll be shipping it very.
00:39:44.295 - 00:39:54.351, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And now the last question I have for you for Mike. So you teased some of these just now, but what are the biggest upcoming things that people should be looking forward to for GEO Net in the coming year?
00:39:54.463 - 00:40:33.783, Speaker A: Yeah, certainly the bridge to Solana I think is going to be super exciting partnerships with some of the other Web three people in deep end, Rover, Wingbits, Natix, a couple more brewing along are going to help cross pollinate some of these deep ins together. That's really cool. Definitely. Gaming, I think is a major category, location based gaming, augmented reality gaming, where you're marrying the physical and the digital world together and you want to do that in a shared way. Location accuracy, actually it's not intuitive at first, but think about it for a second. If I put something in a certain location, I want someone else to be able to find it. That location needs to be the same for both participants.
00:40:33.783 - 00:41:05.261, Speaker A: If I want to look, if I want to put a digital, a virtual thing in the real world like a Pokemon, Precision matters. And I think that that is going to be a really cool space. And then of course I come back to the robots. I think robots are a fix to explode. We're engaged with a ton of different companies in robotics and I really, I think they and themselves, these robots are green. They provide an ROI to the, to the buyer of them. They reduce manual labor.
00:41:05.261 - 00:41:13.117, Speaker A: And I think the time is really ripe now for a lot of innovation in robotics and Geodnet is going to be a major player in that.
00:41:13.261 - 00:41:39.071, Speaker B: I'm really excited because Geodnet is kind of usually thought of as a GPS thing, but then if you really dig into it for people who go through some of the materials and some of the interviews you've done, it's actually an intersection of so many different secular trends that are going to shape the future. Future with anything from drones to robotics. So I'm really excited to see where Geonet goes next year. And for people who want to follow you or follow Geonet, what are the best channels for them to do this?
00:41:39.143 - 00:41:57.201, Speaker A: Yeah, X is great. We post all the time. So we're at Geonet and then we have a great YouTube channel that we are publishing videos. We try to tell the story through our customers. So we like to go. And customers like to also talk about Geodnet a lot. So.
00:41:57.201 - 00:42:18.101, Speaker A: So because I think a lot of the customers in Web2 find the whole thing quite amazing and quite marvelous that this is providing such a great value and service to them. So we do do a lot of videos with customers and I welcome people to follow our YouTube channel. We're putting quite a lot of new content out on a weekly basis.
00:42:18.293 - 00:42:39.203, Speaker B: Absolutely. Well, thank you so much for coming on, Mike. This has been very fun. Hey there, Jason.
