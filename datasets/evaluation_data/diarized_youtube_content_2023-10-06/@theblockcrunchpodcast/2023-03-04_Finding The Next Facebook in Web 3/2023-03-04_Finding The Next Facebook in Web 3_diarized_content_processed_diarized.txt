00:00:00.240 - 00:00:44.474, Speaker A: Can you design a system that creates some sense of a moat that prevents people from just working the protocol and getting the liquidity of a marketplace onto the consumer side and the creator side of a social application? I would say the answer is probably yes. I just haven't seen anything interesting in that area yet. Then the second question for founders is, can you actually use web3 rails or the design space of web3 in a way that's actually net new and not just reaching feature parity and being built on a decentralized stack? My gut tells me, Jason, that the answer to those two questions is out there. We will see some really interesting experiments in web3 social that doesn't mean that they exist today, and it certainly doesn't mean that it's never going to happen.
