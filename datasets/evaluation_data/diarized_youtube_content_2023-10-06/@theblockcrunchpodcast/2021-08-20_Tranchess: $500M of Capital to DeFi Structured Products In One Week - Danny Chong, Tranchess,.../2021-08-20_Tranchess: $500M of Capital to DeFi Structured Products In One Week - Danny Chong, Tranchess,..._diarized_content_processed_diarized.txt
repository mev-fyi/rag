00:00:00.800 - 00:00:14.790, Speaker A: You're now listening to Alpha Leak, a podcast mini series highlighting the most under the radar projects and developments in crypto, and this series is brought to you by the Blockcrunch podcast. I'm your host, Jason Choi. I'm a general partner at Spartan Capital and an active Defi angel investor.
00:00:14.902 - 00:00:16.222, Speaker B: Nothing on this show should be construed.
00:00:16.238 - 00:00:27.234, Speaker A: As financial advice, and my guests, myself and my employer may hold positions and assets discussed on the show. And if you'd like for your project to be featured on this series, reach out to me on Twitter mrjasonchoi.
00:00:28.044 - 00:00:34.704, Speaker B: This episode is also brought to you by Periswap and Solana, two of my favorite projects in crypto. Stick around to learn more.
00:00:35.004 - 00:01:01.824, Speaker C: Those of you who follow the show know that I am really excited about new types of financial products in DeFi, and products such as tranche funds yield products are especially bringing over more sophisticated products from the legacy financial world and as such have the potential to draw in new types of users. So today I'm very excited to talk about one of these projects called Tranchess, and I'm very excited to have Danny from the tranchess project on the show. So Danny, welcome.
00:01:01.904 - 00:01:13.944, Speaker D: Thanks very much, Jason. Very happy to be here today on Blockcrunch podcast. Yeah, it's great to be here. And to be honest, I've listened to quite a bit of your previous podcast and looked through your tweet. It's awesome.
00:01:14.064 - 00:01:31.224, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you so much for the support. And I know you had a really extensive career in traditional finance before crypto as well. So before we kind of jump into this world of tranche products and what tranche's actually is and how it works, can you give it a sense of who you are and how did you end up doing tranche?
00:01:31.524 - 00:02:12.924, Speaker D: Sure. So a bit about myself. I've worked across investment banks over the last 16 years in the likes of UOB, BNP, Paribas, Sokjan, primarily in roles such as sales, trading and management of teams across Asia Pacific. I was trained as an electrical engineer, had also led a team of programmers to build a structured product platform API during my stint at SocGen. I actually like doing that, so you can call me a gig in that sense. I like to put defi concepts with tasks and combine them. Hopefully with my knowledge and experience and financial products, I'm able to improve continuously the offerings on defi and of course tranchess.
00:02:12.924 - 00:02:14.632, Speaker D: That's why I'm here today.
00:02:14.808 - 00:02:41.778, Speaker C: Awesome. And I'm really excited to dive into tranche because now, per my understanding tranche is a tranche fund protocol. And now, without diving into the protocol, I know a lot of guys who are not in traditional finance who didn't have that experience that you have. They may not know what a tranche actually is. Some of them may have heard the term from movies like the big short. But can you kind of help us define what a tranche is and maybe give us an analogy or an example as well?
00:02:41.976 - 00:03:12.860, Speaker D: Sure. To start, the word tranche is a french word that refers to a portion or a slice of something. In finance terms, if you look at it, it refers to a portion of a fund or so called a sub fund. A fund is often split into tranches to offer different risks and returns. And that's exactly what we have on tranches as well. Namely, that is the bishop and rook tranche. Just to give a bit of insight, it would be really tough for me to give an example of tranche in daily life.
00:03:12.860 - 00:03:50.108, Speaker D: I would have to go into the finance part of things. But let's not look at it at this point. Let's look at it by comparing it to a chocolate cheesecake. So you can imagine how a chocolate cheesecake looks like chocolate on the first layer with cheese and sponge on the lower layer under the hot sun, which you can look at it as a special event or something that happened. Chocolate, which is the sweeter tasting one, a better return, will definitely melt first. The cheese and the sponge layer that is below will stay solid and less impacted by the sun or barely impacted by the sun. So there you have it.
00:03:50.108 - 00:03:57.284, Speaker D: One event of the hot sun, two outcomes from the same cake. That's how I actually look at it.
00:03:57.404 - 00:04:30.796, Speaker C: That's a really great analogy, and I've never heard anyone put it that way. And it makes a lot of sense because the chocolate part is. Is the higher return part, is the tastier part, but it's also the riskier part, because in the event of a risk event, if there's a hot sun, as you mentioned, it does get melted first. So it's very similar to how legacy tranche funds work. And just to give listeners a sense of what tranche is, it's inspired by these legacy tranche funds. And today, users can do a few things with tranchess. They can mint a bitcoin exposure and then tranche out two separate products based on that exposure.
00:04:30.796 - 00:05:01.024, Speaker C: So there's a few tokens at play here. So first is the main token called Queen. So that's the token that tracks bitcoin price. And then queen itself can be split into two tranches called Bishop and Rook. So Bishop is a USD yielding product, the more kind of stable and low risk product. And then Rook is the levered exposure to bitcoin, which is the higher risk and potentially higher return product as well. So I love to talk about these products one by one, starting with Queen, which is the main product that tracks bitcoin price.
00:05:01.024 - 00:05:04.272, Speaker C: So what types of people will go and mint queen today?
00:05:04.368 - 00:05:38.834, Speaker D: So typically, users who are long bitcoin or intend to go long bitcoin will be considering queen. Well, because these users are generally searching for you. If I have to look at bitcoin nowadays, they don't have much options to be able to farm you anywhere. Currently, Queen actually offers an attractive apY. You can look at it on tranche.com. We have just printed our API online. The yield comes in the form of tranche governance token, which is chess, and currently traded in Pancakeswap.
00:05:38.834 - 00:05:51.114, Speaker D: I think that's it. People who generally want to go long BTC for now, we will have further underlying. I will go into that later on, but BTC at this moment.
00:05:51.654 - 00:06:03.630, Speaker C: Got it. So say I have a bunch of cash and I want exposure to bitcoin. Instead of just buying bitcoin, I can actually mint this queen token and then get that bitcoin exposure and also on earn a yield on top. Is that correct?
00:06:03.782 - 00:06:10.834, Speaker D: That's correct. If you actually create queen, that will definitely be giving you a handsome yield at this point today.
00:06:11.334 - 00:06:42.478, Speaker C: And this yield, it's interesting because this yield is denominated in the native token for the platform, which is another token called chess. And this is a governance token, the actual token that accrues the value from the usage of the tranche products for tranche. So as you mentioned today, users are incentivized to min this queen token rather than just hold bitcoin because they can get the same exposure plus this inflationary reward from the protocol. Now, what if this inflationary runs out? And what will incentivize users to keep using queen then?
00:06:42.566 - 00:07:16.962, Speaker D: I wouldn't really look at inflationary reward running out. I don't think that is kind of like where we are aiming to go or hoping for that to happen. So, first of all, I think we can look at it in a few ways. Chess tokens are distributed according to a schedule over four years that prevents inflation from sweating. It's not a lump distribution of chess token. It's actually over four years as of today. You can also see a lot of active interest in terms of TPL coming through tranches using tranches to get queen, as well as to split into Bishop and rookie.
00:07:16.962 - 00:07:38.968, Speaker D: The protocol will also continue to get income from various transaction earnings. Now, tranche has started with BTC as the first underlying, but there are definitely plans to have more underlyings as well as well as to go into multi chain. These plans would serve very well to serve the chess token and allow users keen to embark on this journey with us to benefit in the progress and as well in the long run.
00:07:39.096 - 00:07:52.456, Speaker C: Got it. So basically, the argument is that instead of just getting native exposure to any asset, you can get the same exposure and on top of that also get a yield. And that's kind of what incentivizes people to come in over the long term, right?
00:07:52.600 - 00:07:53.604, Speaker D: That's correct.
00:07:54.464 - 00:08:22.114, Speaker C: Got it. And I'd love to kind of dive into the tranche product itself as well. So, as with all tranche products, there is a tranche that offers lower returns, but also lower risk, and a high return tranche that carries higher risk and maybe higher returns. Now, in this case, the lower return tranche is bishop and the potentially higher return tranche is rook. So let's start with bishop here. When I mint a bishop token, where does my yield come from and what is my risk?
00:08:22.234 - 00:09:11.882, Speaker D: So, bishop, just to explain, will be the tranche that is risk free. Or rather, it is the tranche that has a value that is similar to the USD stable type of coins. It is also the tranche token that earns the most chess tokens in terms of ratio. The chest token distribution weightage in terms of Bishop Queen root will be four, three, two respectively. What this means is for every bishop that you hold, you will get four chests as according to what we have in the white paper, queen and rook will then get three and two respectively. How do you actually get bishop? So you have mentioned before, bishop and rook can be tranched from queen. So that is actually what one of the ways in which you can actually get a bishop from queen, you can actually split into 0.5
00:09:11.882 - 00:10:03.798, Speaker D: bishop and 0.55 rook. So when that happens, you will want to cast away or sell away your rook and purely just get in the form of bishop over our swap. Second way, you can actually directly purchase Bishop using USDC from our swap as well. Now, essentially because Bishop is lending BTC risk to rook, it will also, on top of chest tokens, get interest payment from rook. The interest rate currently that we have is Venus borrow rate plus community decided interest rate, which can range between zero to four depending on the vote. Any holder of vechest will be able to vote on the weekly additional interest rate of zero, two and four.
00:10:03.798 - 00:10:11.838, Speaker D: Just also to mention I guess we didn't really speak about this earlier on Vechest is what users get for locking chest tokens within the protocol.
00:10:11.966 - 00:10:58.092, Speaker B: Now before I continue, I'd love to share one of my favorite products in crypto with you. Now whenever I want to trade a token instead of going to uniswap sushiswap bancor one x one to see where I can find the best quote, I just go to Paraswap to scan for the best price anywhere because per swap aggregates all the popular Ethereum dexs and saves me a ton of time and headache in finding where I can trade something for the best price and lets me trade in one place. Now the cool thing is theyve also integrated with ledger life as well, meaning I can now swap at the best prices directly from my ledger wallet. So seriously, if you are a Defi trader and youre worried about the security risks of centralized exchanges, but you also dont want to scour dozens of dexs just to find the best price, you have to check out Periswap. So head on over to Paraswap IO blockcrunch.
00:10:58.228 - 00:11:41.912, Speaker A: I'd love to also talk about our sponsor Solana, a high throughput layer one blockchain. Now, in the past few months I've probably talked to two dozen teams building exciting new projects on Solana, and this is probably why. First, it's incredibly fast with 50,000 transactions per second. 2nd, it's cheap with average fees less than a cent per transaction. That means developers can deploy contracts cheaply and also not have to worry about their apps not being composable with others, as Solana does not use any type of sharding or fragmented L2 systems. Most importantly, Solana is censorship resistant with over 950 validators today. So if you're interested in building fast, scalable blockchain applications, or want to test out the existing ecosystem of Defi applications and more, go to solana.com
00:11:41.912 - 00:11:43.000, Speaker A: blockcrunch.
00:11:43.112 - 00:12:10.164, Speaker C: So it sounds like holders of Bishop tokens, which is this kind of USD yielding tranche. They have two sources of yield. One is the inflationary rewards from the protocol from chess token. The other is the interest paid by the high risk tranche which borrows from the low risk tranche. So today, which ones of these avenues of yield is higher for holders of bishop? Are they earning more from the chest token rewards? Are they earning more from interest today?
00:12:10.904 - 00:12:32.348, Speaker D: As of today, if we look at APY and also the rate is which being given from rook, we will definitely have currently the chess one being higher, chess EU being the highest one currently. It moves quite a lot recently because we have increasing TVL. I think one can go to the website and check it out.
00:12:32.476 - 00:12:40.356, Speaker C: Got it. And is the intention over the long term for maybe the interest to be higher than the inflationary rewards?
00:12:40.540 - 00:12:54.554, Speaker D: It will definitely be maintained at the current level or it really depends on how much TVL that we have. We don't plan, we don't kind of influence, but I believe that at this juncture from where we are seeing it should be higher.
00:12:55.254 - 00:13:14.194, Speaker C: Got it. That's really interesting. And I also love to talk about rook as well, which is the levered bitcoin exposure, because in the documentation it's described as a no liquidation leverage on bitcoin. So how does this work exactly? Like how do people, how are people able to get levered exposure without liquidation?
00:13:15.714 - 00:13:48.660, Speaker D: That's a good question. To explain further on Rook, it is the leverage token of the protocol. Currently the ratio for leverage is around two. So basically, just to explain on this part, if Queen, which is a tracker of BTC, goes up by 0.5, root will go up by one. It's little known we don't really broadcast this, but staking of Root will also use chest tokens. Now, also, similar to what we hear from Bishop, there are two ways to get rook.
00:13:48.660 - 00:14:32.584, Speaker D: One which is via queen split, you sell bishop in the swap and you get pure rook. Or else you go to the swap and use USDC to actually purchase Rook to get your rook. Rook essentially is getting its leverage from bishop and hence we need to pay interest. I think we discussed this before, and this is done on a weekly basis. This will be decided by the community on a zero to 4% what is going to be added on top to the Venus borrowing rate. I think we are often compared to the likes of Terps in general. So if I have to draw a comparison, one, there is no need for margin maintenance in terms of difference, and two, there is no false liquidation.
00:14:32.584 - 00:14:57.444, Speaker D: The reason why there is no false liquidation is because because there is a rebalance mechanism that kicks in when root reaches nav 0.5. That's obviously when BTC goes much lower. And I will not go into details because it gets a bit technical from here. For those who are actually keen to look at the rebalance mechanism, may I just recommend that you go to the documents@trancheats.com for more information.
00:14:57.824 - 00:15:15.204, Speaker C: Got it. Actually, on that point, there are also other tranche protocols in defi lately that offer different types of exposure. Two of these, I think big projects are Barnbridge and Saffron. So can you help us highlight the main differences between tranches and these products?
00:15:16.144 - 00:15:59.886, Speaker D: Sure. So we've heard of ourselves being compared to Boundbridge and Saffron before, so it's not really a big surprise that you're asking this today when we are looking at comparison. I guess we need to break down and look a bit deeper into the specific products being offered each protocol. So one, if I look at Saffron and Banbridge smart u, they are basically debt aggregators, which is completely different from us. The users decide what risk they want to take on platform defaults for the likes of AavE finance account. The higher the returns, the higher the probability of default for the tranche you select to participate in. And that's the debt aggregator part, completely different from where we're offering.
00:15:59.886 - 00:16:50.502, Speaker D: Number two, Bond Bridge smart Alpha, I guess, is the closest comparison to where tranches is offering in the sense that we both can choose the kind of underlying to track, be it BTC, Ethereum and so on. That's where I can see the similarity. But that's also where I can see physically at this point to compare what we have because I think the project is not yet completed. Maybe I'll also add the fact that the uniqueness of Tron chess lies in the fact that it is a single fund that offers tranche that is zero market risk and also one that's leveraged. It has also a unique swap market that offers a twock trading. If we look at tranches in totality, I would say it is in a class of its own and it's not really comparable in that sense. We are not just comparing by single product basis.
00:16:50.678 - 00:17:12.594, Speaker C: Got it. And actually this is something that I also wanted to ask just now, which is for me as a deFi user, if I say want to get levered exposure on bitcoin, I can go to Dydx today for instance, and use their bitcoin perpetuals and go levered long. So how would that be different from kind of going levered long on bitcoin via rook?
00:17:13.214 - 00:17:54.018, Speaker D: Okay, so that's what I've highlighted just now. Basically if you go into perks at DyDX, we don't really want to compare, but you know, like I think they are the same as a lot of perks in general. But first of all, there is no such thing as the initial margin. There is no margin maintenance. And of course because of how we are in terms of the ecosystem, there is also, no false liquidation. I think we highlight the fact that once bitcoin actually goes to a much lower level from here, maybe, say, 25%, there will be a rebalance mechanism that kicks in that prevents any form of a false liquidation.
00:17:54.186 - 00:18:07.294, Speaker C: Got it. And I guess the trade off here would be for DYDX or for any kind of perpetual protocol. You can set your own degree of leverage, whereas tranche kind of defines the leverage for you, right?
00:18:07.994 - 00:18:19.974, Speaker D: That's correct. We don't really want to move it. Too aggressive. And I think this is currently a level which is also decided by the ratio between bishop and rook.
00:18:20.714 - 00:19:14.234, Speaker C: Got it. Okay, that's really interesting. So, I guess for very active traders, that may switch between one to ten x leverage and trade in smaller timeframes using kind of perpetual trading protocols makes more sense for leverage exposure to bitcoin. But for more kind of passive investors who just want a higher risk exposure to bitcoin, then something like tranche has makes a lot more sense to them. And I'd love to kind of zoom out a little bit as well, because now, obviously, tranche products allow more sophisticated players to express different market views with different instruments, as I just described. And assuming the goal here is to tap into these more sophisticated users and maybe even tap into legacy finance, how big is this opportunity, especially for people who may not understand or may not be familiar with the tranche products market, how big is this market, really?
00:19:15.454 - 00:19:51.274, Speaker D: So that's an interesting question. I wouldn't really look at more of, like, tranche products per se, but I will be looking at DeFi market, because that's actually the whole market that we are looking at and versus what are the kind of assets that's under management. So I was looking through a bit of history, DeFi, how it has grown. I think we look at numbers such as it clocked 11 billion last October, and it was 20 this January. It reached a high of 87 billion or so this June. Maybe it's around 60 billion as of now. As we speak.
00:19:51.274 - 00:20:13.470, Speaker D: Now, the global assets under management, according to a report that is written by PwC, currently that amount of assets under management is 120 trillion. So if I have to compare, like, for like, I would say that there is a lot of growth space in DeFi compared to third five where assets are under management.
00:20:13.662 - 00:20:25.374, Speaker C: Got it. Got it. So the goal is to kind of tap into the whole of Defi. And what do you mean when you say that? Is it to create, I guess, these tranche exposure to all the Defi tokens?
00:20:25.874 - 00:20:41.934, Speaker D: Rather, we are saying that we are product that's meant for the defi market. We do not kind of like being aggressive in what we're trying to offer. We are there to allow DeFi users of any types to come and use our protocol.
00:20:43.334 - 00:21:18.664, Speaker C: Got it. And actually, on this point about DeFi, I'm assuming that, well, at least I think one of the strong points about creating tranche products is that it appeals to folks in the legacy market as well who want more options to express their different views. So assuming that one of the goals, eventual kind of endgame, is to tap into this wider market beyond just crypto natives, how am I trying to do that? Is it through kind of partnering with banks or integrating with things like fire blocks or. What's the thinking here?
00:21:18.744 - 00:22:14.844, Speaker D: Well, we are open to all sorts of possibilities, but we are also very pragmatic in our approach. We are more focusing on currently working towards our next underlying and perhaps going multi chain if we have to look at current market. Not all banks are also ready to take on defi risk, given some are not even allowed to do any crypto related business at this juncture. There are others that's just venturing into BTC risk management via CME futures at this point, not directly holding on to crypto assets. But of course this could quickly change given that we have seen a lot of interesting news coming from so called traditional finance. We are also seeing more banks entering into the arena. If I can quote a few of the latest news that we've heard ct announcing setting up of a digital assets group within wealth management division, JPMorgan.
00:22:14.844 - 00:22:46.876, Speaker D: Just on last Friday we saw news is ready to give all wealth clients access to crypto funds and they are actually looking into funds provided by the likes of grayscale investments. So if I have to look at it in terms of collaboration, perhaps wealth management arm of banks or external asset management firms definitely looks like an interesting Runway for collaboration. We look to focus currently, however, still on building up our functionality on the platform to make sure everything is in sound and good order before we move externally to pitch our protocol.
00:22:47.020 - 00:23:34.324, Speaker C: Got it. That makes a lot of sense and that's one of the things that I think people tend to overlook is the fact that the market beyond just crypto natives and DeFi is so much larger and there's a lot of market expansionary potential in bridging over to some of the legacy markets. And I think a lot of people have concerns that this by centralized defi, but I don't think those concerns are really well founded. But I'm really excited to see where verticalization would bring us. Well, daddy, thank you so much for coming onto the show today. I think we had a much better understanding of not just tranche products, but also how tranches works and what types of people it appeals to. So for people who want to really dive into the nitty gritty about Queen Bishop Rook and how all these different tokens fit together, what are the best resources for them to go to?
00:23:35.184 - 00:24:02.976, Speaker D: Sure. So, like, as I mentioned before, documents on chess.com will definitely be good. If you like to have a bit of sense splitting into particular focus, like what is queen able to do? Or you would like to have an overview of where tranches is or what it's going to do. You can also look at our medium articles that is being launched on a bi weekly basis. We have new articles coming out.
00:24:03.120 - 00:24:06.568, Speaker C: Awesome. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show, Danny. This is really fun.
00:24:06.736 - 00:24:09.904, Speaker D: Thanks very much, Jason, and very much for your time on the show.
