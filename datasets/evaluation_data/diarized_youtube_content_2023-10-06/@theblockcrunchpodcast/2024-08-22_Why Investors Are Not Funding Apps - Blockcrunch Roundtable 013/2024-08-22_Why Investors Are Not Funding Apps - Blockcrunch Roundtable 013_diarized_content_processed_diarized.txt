00:00:00.320 - 00:00:22.129, Speaker A: Truth is, VCs are pretty AP like when things take off, they invest in them. Axie took off and VCs poured a billion dollars into crypto gaming, which is very much an application, but roughly that billion dollars has pretty much nothing to show for it. So I find this idea that VCs invest in something and the whole industry shifts is just like the wrong way of looking at it. Web3 offers a brand new petri dish.
00:00:22.177 - 00:00:23.945, Speaker B: Our job is to buy great tech at great prices.
00:00:24.025 - 00:00:26.513, Speaker C: AI is also libertarian right Enable a.
00:00:26.529 - 00:01:03.571, Speaker B: Use case that people haven't been able to do today. The next hundreds of millions of players they will come to the market through mo. My personal reason why I could be bullish in the next 12 months is blockcrunch is not a licensed financial advisor and is purely for informational and entertainment purposes only. All opinions are personal and the show may discuss assets that the host or guests have positions in or may be actively buying or selling. All investments carry risk, so consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions, alright? Hey everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the blockcrunch Roundtable. I'm once again joined by my co host Sanat from Dragonfly.
00:01:03.571 - 00:01:39.744, Speaker B: I'm your host Jason Choi from Tangent. Now recently there has been a big discussion about whether VCs are overfunding infra and not enough apps. And this conversation really started from a recent conference in crypto. And this has taken to Twitter where everybody seems to be discussing whether we should be funding infra or apps for the past few weeks. So just to give some context about what's happening right now, so there has been a lot of massive fundraises for infrastructure projects in crypto. So these are things like layer ones or L2s. So just to give an example, Bara Chain, which is a new layer one that has yet to launch, they raised $100 million.
00:01:39.744 - 00:02:50.419, Speaker B: And there's another layer one called Monad that raised $225 million in funding to build also another layer one. Now neither of these are live yet. Now at the same time, Poly Market, which has since become the largest prediction market in the world with $300 million from users betting on the election outcome in the U.S. they raised a relatively small $45 million from Peter Thiel and others and also Forecaster, one of the most used applications in Crypto, with about 75,000 daily active users, raised $150 million. So a lot of people are starting to ask the question, why do unproven and unlaunched infrastructure projects with hundreds of competitors seem to be raising so much more money and getting so much more attention than applications that are actually live and market leading in crypto, whether this is correct, whether this is good and to investors, are there, is there more alpha to invest in apps than infrastructure? These are all things that we're going to tackle today. And before you start, just as a disclaimer, nothing we discuss on this show is financial advice and our views are only our personal views and not reflective of our respective companies. So Sanat, I know you have a lot of strong thoughts on this since we discussed about this outside of the show as well.
00:02:50.419 - 00:03:05.029, Speaker B: But before we even dive into infra versus app, whether we should front info, whether we should build apps, do you know what was the thing that brought you into this space? Right. If you zoom out and think about what is crypto actually for in the long term, what is the mission that kind of excites you?
00:03:05.117 - 00:03:33.831, Speaker A: Mission that excites me is permissionless value creation. Like the analogy breaks down if you push it too hard. But I do think the way that the Internet made it possible for anyone in the world to share information with anyone else in the world, and we built billions of dollars of hundreds of billions of dollars of value on top of that, I think crypto makes it possible for anyone to utilize digital scarcity and create digital value. And I'm still 100% on board with that thesis.
00:03:33.903 - 00:03:59.673, Speaker B: Before I get started, I'm grateful for aptos for sponsoring the show and letting us continue to make this free content for all. So here's Jerome from Aptos to tell us a little bit more. Jerome aptos has experienced tremendous growth this year, having doubled its daily active addresses to serving approximately 150,000 users every day, and also tripled its TVL to nearly 400 million as of this recording. According to Defi Llama. So can you walk us through Aptos Ecosystem and what contributed to this growth?
00:03:59.729 - 00:04:49.931, Speaker C: So what truly sets aptos apart is the builder focused technology. The aptos foundation works really hard to give developers the guidance and support that they need throughout their building process. The aptos ecosystem is rich with tools, including the recently relaunched aptos Documentation Experience plus aptos Learn, a robust grants program to help builders take the ideas from zero to launch, and a solid tech foundation that helps developers turn their innovative ideas into reality with ease. Another unique aspect about the Aptos ecosystem is how dynamic and inclusive it is. We want to support developers from all over, whether you're a Web2 corporate Web3 native or a budding Web2 enthusiast, to help Web3 break out of these 20,000 or so deaths that the industry has to date, since the start of 2024, nearly 10 million new users have joined Aptos. At the end of June, Aptos transactions hit over 10.5 million, surpassing a major milestone with over 1 billion total transactions in the network.
00:04:49.931 - 00:04:53.155, Speaker C: The milestone underscores adoption of Aptos by a vibrant community.
00:04:53.235 - 00:05:48.121, Speaker B: Thanks, Jerome. Now back to the episode. You know, a lot of the earlier folks, I think, who joined maybe before 2017, they really joined for libertarian ideals or cypherpunk ideals, which is this idea of self sovereignty where you own your own assets, you have a parallel financial system with its own monetary policy that is not controlled by the Fed or controlled by any central banks. So I know some people from that camp believe that any of the apps that we see, like all the meme coins, everything, is just an accelerationist way to get people to set up a wallet and use crypto for the first time. And that all roads lead back to Bitcoin and Ethereum. And as long as we can kind of Trojan horse this cyberpunk ideology in the apps, any apps go. Is that a view that you hold as well, or do you think that these apps can actually become kind of large sustainable businesses or are they just kind of a distribution channel for, you know, Ethereum, for Solana, for Bitcoin?
00:05:48.273 - 00:06:32.787, Speaker A: Maybe a couple of points. One, I think it's worth holding on to the ideology and I do think, but I think a lot of the speculative based apps can be real strong businesses. I mean, centralized exchanges and crypto are excellent businesses by any metric by which you judge businesses, and those thrive on speculation. And so I am not someone who thinks speculation is just like a Trojan horse. The second thing is that I think as an investor, whether you like it or not, it behooves you to kind of be willing to change your mind. And so everyone who read bitcoin, who read the bitcoin white paper and came into Ethereum, was obsessed with the idea that we would use Bitcoin and Ethereum as money. And the truth is we use stablecoins as money.
00:06:32.787 - 00:06:59.757, Speaker A: Stablecoins have found immense product market fit. There's like hundreds of billions of dollars of them. They're used, of course, for crypto speculation, but they're also used in countries like Turkey to make payments. And so I think it's very important to be nimble on your feet. And like, there is a class of person who hates stablecoins. I know there are like truly crypto people who hate stablecoins because they think we should all be paying with Bitcoin and Ethereum. And the truth is users don't want to pay with Bitcoin and Ethereum, but users really love having a digital dollar.
00:06:59.757 - 00:07:12.341, Speaker A: And I think that's the kind of paradigm shift that not a lot of crypto investors expected. But once you see it, you have to be willing to change your mind because at the end of the day, none of this stuff matters if users don't want what you build.
00:07:12.413 - 00:08:03.711, Speaker B: Yeah, I Remember back in 2018, there were investors who are quite prominent in the space and they were basically of the opinion that, okay, if stable coins are the most exciting things to come out of crypto, then we would have failed. But then a few years later, I think the tune has really changed because it's really proven itself to be the big use case. And like you said, it's not just a Trojan horse. I do think that stablecoins, like the first time some of my friends outside of crypto use stablecoins, they are introduced to the concept of owning your own assets, having a digital wallet, buying ETH for gas, and then kind of understanding what eth is and understanding what gas is. So there is that Trojan horse element where you're forced to learn about crypto, what it stands for, how to use it when you use stablecoins. But the utility alone is kind of warrants its own standing as an application, which makes a lot of sense. Yeah.
00:08:03.711 - 00:09:03.147, Speaker B: So the reason why I asked this is because I think the question of app versus infra ultimately is a philosophical one. Right. It's whether do you want to just build applications in order to distribute this cypherpunk ideology, and it doesn't really matter what the application is, does it matter whether they last in the long term? And the other camp would be I really think these applications could be sustainable businesses in the long term. That's why I want to bet on them. So one of my initial suspicions was that because there hasn't really been a very clear use case for crypto applications beyond maybe a few small ones and maybe stablecoins, that a lot of long term investors take the view that these applications have a very short lifespan and they're really mostly useful as a distribution channel for this kind of cypherpunk tech, and we're not really trying to invest in these applications for the long term. Is this something that you feel as well or why do you think there isn't a lot of investments in applications?
00:09:03.291 - 00:09:38.579, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the truth is that when people have this conversation, they sometimes one bring a very ideological bend to it. Like VCs should be doing this for the good of the industry. And the truth is VCs are pretty AP like when things take off, they invest in them. Axie took off and VCs poured a billion dollars into crypto gaming, which is very much an application. And that billion dollars, I'd say there are of course a handful of exceptions. Pixels is doing well, Ronin is doing well. But roughly that billion of that billion dollars has pretty much nothing to show for it.
00:09:38.579 - 00:10:24.455, Speaker A: So I find this idea that VC is kind of like this idea that VCs invest in something and the whole industry shifts is just like the wrong way of looking at it. I think VCs are also ultimately price takers and they only make money when the market responds to the investments they make. And so they're not making money on the gaming side, but they still invested in it because they saw it taking off and they believed it would take off. So VCs invest in things when they look like they take off. I think if you look at the top hundred coins in crypto right now, it's probably like 90 of them are what we call infrastructure layer ones, L2s, smart contract platforms, stuff like that. And unfortunately right now the valuation cap for that class of investment is a lot higher. And so for better or worse, I think there are tons of Defi products I love.
00:10:24.455 - 00:11:06.013, Speaker A: I think AAVE is a great product, I think Lido is a great product. The truth is the valuations are low for these products. And at this point, those valuations are not set by VCs. Those valuations are set by the public market. And so when people talk about why can't an application raise a $225 million round? Well, $225 million rounds happen at 2, 3, $4 billion valuations. And it is hard to index to an outcome because to give you a specific example, we looked at a Defi deal recently that was in the high hundreds of millions of dollars. And one of the things we spoke about was like, look, this team would have to both beat its competitor and Defi would have to re rate such that all Defi tokens traded at three times their valuation.
00:11:06.013 - 00:11:46.545, Speaker A: And that's many layers of risk for us to take. And if you look at the other side of it, Solana just completed a four year cycle. This is when VCs vest, this is when VCs actually pay. This is the kind of timelines VCs are actually playing on. And Solana is worth $80 billion. I mean like I would think that if you're a VC and you're like, okay, we funded a bunch of eth killers and the winner in that eth killer category is worth $80 billion, the most obvious signal the market is telling you is that fund more of these things. Like fund, you can fund five of them at $1 billion valuations and if one of them hits $80 billion, you'll make a ton of money.
00:11:46.545 - 00:11:57.757, Speaker A: And so I think it's always funny to me how ideological these conversations become. And for things to shift, the public market has to want different tokens as well.
00:11:57.901 - 00:12:27.219, Speaker B: The calculus is really financial. It's basically the price is big enough if you manage to get the next big L1, but the price may not be that big if you bet the next biggest exchange. Because like you said, if you look at Uniswap, which is the leading exchange by far, they're $5 billion. Right. And then you look at something like Cardano, who uses Cardano, but it's $14 billion with nothing. So yeah, I think you're right. I think it's really a financial decision for VCs.
00:12:27.219 - 00:12:27.725, Speaker B: Right? Yeah.
00:12:27.776 - 00:13:07.837, Speaker A: I think in some sense, you know, VCs are here to return capital to LPs. Sometimes it's unpleasant to say it and I don't blame people. VCs also like to sound like ideological thought leaders on the timeline a lot, but they have fiduciary duties to their LPs and so they make investments that they think will make money. And I think the truth is like people also index very much on big rounds, but lots of classes of applications get funded and have interesting outcomes in crypto. Stablecoins get funded, you have a new stablecoin idea, someone will fund you. Defi applications still continue to get funded, Telegram bots are continuing to get funded and print crazy sums of money. There are teams like Pump Fund that have generated $40 million in revenue.
00:13:07.837 - 00:13:24.565, Speaker A: So maybe there are different business models, different ways of structuring those deals. And we like, we over index on the multi hundred million dollar at multi billion dollar valuation L1 round. And I'm not sure we're going to see a ton of those for applications until it's clear that there is an $80 billion outcome.
00:13:24.645 - 00:13:36.301, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think I've always taken the view as an investor that I try not to be too opinionated when it comes to infrastructure projects. But first of all, because I think a lot of the low level technical trade offs are beyond my comprehension.
00:13:36.333 - 00:13:36.477, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:36.501 - 00:14:09.505, Speaker B: Like when Solana was first racing talking about proof of history and all that. I think maybe like 10% of the people who read the white paper fully understood the whole thing. But if you look at just the outcomes of the class, the vintage of L1s that raised at that time, near Avalanche Solana, there was one that kind of failed. I think on Oasis, you know, if you just bet on all of them, you probably ended up doing quite well. But then on application side, I try to be very opinionated, just because the tech, I think, matters a little bit less. Right. For L1s, at least.
00:14:09.505 - 00:14:56.345, Speaker B: It seems like regardless of your adoption, the market is able to spin a narrative mostly around the technical differentiation. Right? This is Solana, but with this and this. This is Ethereum, but with this and this. Whereas for applications, you can't really dream your way to a big valuation, right? You, you have very tried and true metrics. Things like daily active users retention, you know, things that people have used in web2 for decades already that you can't really fake. So if you launch an application, it looks really nice and this is like, you know, uniswap, but with like this and this order matching, it's nicer, but you have like two users, then the market will call your bullshit out on it. So in that sense, I try to play the game and just try to be very, very opinion with applications and really focus on the distribution side versus the tech side.
00:14:56.345 - 00:15:07.617, Speaker B: Is this something that kind of, you know, mirrors your approach to thinking about infra or app as well? Or is it kind of, you know, a similar approach? I just look at the founders, you know, whoever is good, we're going to invest.
00:15:07.721 - 00:15:44.605, Speaker A: So the first thing I want to tell you is that for what it's worth, Oasis trades at $800 million. I mean, it's just, it's just worth considering that like it's a chain that none of us have used or spoken about, I think so. A couple of things. People are very. People seem to think that the death of infrastructure is coming because a handful of layer ones and L2s launched at pretty low valuations relative to the last round they raised at. This is a thing that happened. But I think this is more a sign that there was probably a period in crypto where if you just did infra deals, you made money because Oasis trades at 800 million.
00:15:44.605 - 00:16:37.945, Speaker A: But the truth is the founders know this now and the investors know this now. And so layer one and L2 projects get bid up to very high valuations, which I think means that increasingly it's not like all of these deals will make money. In fact, most of them will lose money. But because there is still a chance at making a Solana, VCs will continue pouring money into it. I think the second thing, the point you made is very valid that it is in many ways it's either more challenging or at least requires a different skill to be a good application layer investor. Like Consumer Social is an example of a category where it requires taste in a way that understanding infrastructure does not like. And one thing I think of pretty often is that if you're a lazy investor, it's a little easier to invest in infrastructure in as much as like.
00:16:37.945 - 00:17:34.055, Speaker A: There's this framework that Amazon uses a lot of like what will not change in 10 years. And for example, the thing they love talking about is that people will want cheaper and faster shipping. And so you can do things that make shipping I think effectively if you look at the last 10 years of crypto or at least since the launch of Ethereum, if you make the bet that people will want faster, cheaper, secure block space, you can actually make it on a 10 year horizon. And in that framework you can make a lot of interesting investments. I think the challenge with applications is that like to give you an example, right now it is like we're in peak meme coin season and so we're seeing venture deals that are adjacent to meme coins happening. Teams like Pump Fun get funded, Telegram Bots get funded. But the thing that scares me is that two years ago we had NFT mania and three years ago we had Defi Yield Farming mania.
00:17:34.055 - 00:18:14.549, Speaker A: And so you had to have really good market timing or have a very strong perspective on what happens in the next three, four years in the application layer to get these investments exactly right. And when you get it wrong, it can be very expensive. Like people talk about, like people love talking about the Berachain and Monad rounds. OpenSea raised a billion dollars at a $13 billion valuation roughly like three years ago. And all of those investors are underwater and so they are paying the price for it. And so I agree with you that application layer investing does take a different kind of skill, particularly when you're doing later stage more expensive deals.
00:18:14.677 - 00:19:06.685, Speaker B: It seems like the problem isn't with kind of VC selecting what to invest. Like you said, it's really kind of what the market is rewarding, right? I think VCs, at least the sharp ones are really just playing the game where if the market is telling you that hey, if you win this game you get an 80x but if you win the app game, you win like a 3X, then obviously everyone will flock to the first one. So I guess that leads to the question, why is the market constantly buying infrastructure over applications? Is it also a similar reasoning whereby, hey, ethereum is worth $380 billion? If we can get like 10% of this, we get a $38 billion outcome. So let's just bit infrastructure. So if that is also the rationale that people are using, then how do we get out of this loop? Like, how do we do? Well, first of all, do you think we should get out of this loop? Do we need to fund more infra or should we fund more apps? And if we do, then how do we get out of this loop?
00:19:06.765 - 00:20:17.307, Speaker A: Maybe the strongest counterargument is that it feels like you can't have in some sense, if you believe that some of the reason that ETH is worth as much as it is and Solana is worth as much as it is, is that it has like these valuations don't make any sense if you try and DCF them out relative to fees. So I think people are believing that these assets have some class of moneyness, some class of being good digital collateral stores of value, whatever the thing you want to call it is. It's hard to imagine that we're going to have 15 of those. And so maybe that's the strongest counterargument versus continuing to back Ethereum killers, Solana killers, whatever the kind of current terminology is. Again, like, I think it's interesting, you know, we're a pretty large fund and we invest a bunch in the application layer and in the infrastructure layer. And I just don't think we ever wake up and are like, hey, do we need to be investing more in the application layer or more in the infrastructure layer? Like, when we see a deal that excites us, we do it. I think it is true that application layer valuations defi is a good example.
00:20:17.307 - 00:20:47.525, Speaker A: Like DEFI valuations feel low relative to the product market fit they have versus infrastructure. I think this is just true. The fact that LIDO trades at something like 3 billion and Oasis trades at 1 billion. There is a part of me that's like, I have no idea why that happens because Oasis, no one uses it ever, basically. So this is kind of a long winded way of saying that. I think at least we're in a privileged position where we can back infrastructure. We're privileged to have invested in polymarket recently as well.
00:20:47.525 - 00:21:30.635, Speaker A: We can back a bunch of applications. But roughly, I think the takeaway is mostly what you said where venture is following the market in some sense. And for venture outcomes, for big venture outcomes, eventually they have to sell to public market investors. So the public market also has to shift its perception and I don't really know what that takes. The best argument I have is that application layer tokens need to look more and more like equity and there's been regulation that's prevented that and maybe that shifts. But it's a pretty big mystery. Like the layer one and L2 premium is a pretty big mystery.
00:21:30.635 - 00:21:32.859, Speaker A: I won't say I understand it perfectly.
00:21:32.987 - 00:22:24.735, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a big reason why the liquid market, like let's say retail guys at home just buying coins prefer L1s or infrastructure over applications is also because valuations are a reflection of are forward looking, right? They're basically a projection of the dream, how big the dream can be. And for applications we really haven't had a big dream yet. And I think the best case study is actually bnb, right? The Binance token, when there were only a fee token for Binance whereby you know, you buy the token, you put it in your account, you get a discount when you trade on Binance. And I think part of the revenue, I think it was like 20% or so are used to burn the supply every quarter. It was very much like a quasi equity for Binance back then. The valuation was nowhere where it is, I think it was like approaching top 10. But now it's the fourth largest crypto asset.
00:22:24.735 - 00:22:59.115, Speaker B: And you know, if you exclude stable coins, if you exclude tether, it's the third biggest coin after Ethereum. It's even bigger than Solana. And you know, I don't hear a lot of people talk about BNB these days but what they did was basically they created the Binance smart chain, right? They basically increased the size of the dream. Hey, this is not just an exchange coin anymore, it's also infrastructure. And over time the narrative became, hey, we're not just, you know, just another Ethereum, we're a cheaper one. And you know, we are the hot bet for all these more Degen apps and we're kind of very Asian focused. So they started to kind of compound on the size of this dream which allowed them to get the valuation.
00:22:59.115 - 00:23:49.875, Speaker B: But if you think about like individual apps, most applications are basically, you know, single dreams, right? It's like Uniswap, we're going to be the biggest exchange and that's it, right? It's not as sexy as saying hey, we're going to build the world computer or the underlying infrastructure for all Deepen networks. So there's an element of kind of smokes and mirrors and kind of narratives which I wonder whether it was self correct over a high enough time frame. But there's also, I think a lot of applications are also kind of facing this uphill struggle where to be very good at what they do to dominate the market, they need to be very focused. And focused dreams are not big dreams, which is very hard to sell to the retail public. So I think one way that that could resolve is the introduction of sophisticated capital. Right. So right now we have institutional capital coming into this space through Bitcoin and etf.
00:23:49.875 - 00:24:27.455, Speaker B: So majority of the institutional capital is still participating either in those ETFs or in venture. So in private markets there's not really a lot of sophisticated discretionary and directional liquid funds from TradFi that are participating in anything below, like say the top five. So that's why the price discovery and valuation methodologies are all still very kind of retail and there's no consensus on it. I suspect when the market kind of matures, people will start to realize actually some of these layer ones should not be valid at what they are. And some of these applications are way undervalued. So that ARP could be close. So it could self correct in that way.
00:24:27.455 - 00:25:10.205, Speaker B: But before we kind of talk more about the market dynamics, let's zoom in on the apps a bit because I read a recent tweet, I forgot who is from, but someone pointed out that there's only two viable business models in crypto apps today. Number one is you accrue a bunch of TVL and you charge a V, you charge a fee on the tvl. And number two is you offer some sort of service. Right? So if you're L1 or L2, you're selling blocks or block sequencing. If you're like a decentralized exchange, you're ordering transactions, you're fulfilling transactions and then you charge a fee on this service. So this is most exchanges, even NFT exchanges, MEV protocols or blockchains. So do you agree with that? Are those like the two big business models you've seen?
00:25:10.325 - 00:25:52.875, Speaker A: Roughly, yes. Actually it kind of ties in. Like at the beginning of this podcast I said the reason I think crypto is interesting is because you get permissionless value creation. Permissionless value creation and digital scarcity means you can create assets. Which means the most interesting businesses that will be created in crypto are marketplaces to trade those assets, places to create new assets like pump fund or places where you can do novel things with Those assets like Athena and Lido. So yeah, I mean this is like unsurprising to me actually that these are the business models we've landed up with. And I am, I think we will continue to see more businesses of this class because I think crypto's greatest strength is in permissionless creation and trading of new digital assets.
00:25:52.995 - 00:26:39.077, Speaker B: I think the interesting case study here for a project that used one of these business models is FriendTech. Right? So FriendTech effectively created a digital chat where you can buy a key for someone and join their private chat and chat with that. So if you like this influencer, you can buy their key for, I don't know, 0.5 eth, and then you join this private chat with direct access to them. But the way they monetized is actually they charge a fee when you buy these keys, but also when you trade the friend token, which is, to be quite honest, you know, not, not. I don't think there's a lot of use case to the token, but just from dominated just from kind of monopolizing the venue in which you can trade the friend token. Because they didn't allow the friend token to be traded on other exchanges, only their own, they were able to make $20 million in fees.
00:26:39.077 - 00:27:30.269, Speaker B: Like this is actual revenues paid by users to trade this token to speculate on fe their launch in August last year. But at the same time, if you look at the market cap of the friend token itself, it's clear that none of this value has really accrued to the token because it's trading at a market cap that's under the revenue that they've made. Right. So they're worth $17 million today as one of the highest profile projects and they made $20 million in fees. So there's a disconnect between these business models, these fee taking business models that allow the founders and whoever holds the equities, right, you know, VCs, founders themselves to get rich. But for the quote unquote community who want ownership in the protocol, who buy the token, there's a big disconnect there. Is this a common issue you've seen in applications as well or is this quite unique to FriendTech?
00:27:30.357 - 00:28:27.865, Speaker A: No, it's definitely an issue. I think there's the polite explanation for it, or the kind of one, if you believe people are all good natured, is that it's the, it's the US regulation that actually, which, which is a fair point, it is actually very risky to start distributing revenue back to token holders because then you fall bang into the crosshairs of the sec. I think this is true and remains like a pretty real challenge. But I also think it's plausible that the application layer lends itself to more equity based businesses than we realize. I think that's very possible. Of course Binance has a token, but Bybit kind of has a token, but a bunch of like the other, like crypto exchanges make a ton of revenue. And it's not like all of that flows back to token holders.
00:28:27.865 - 00:29:09.473, Speaker A: A lot of it actually flows back to equity holders. You're seeing the same thing happen with Uniswap. Like Uniswap is charging a 15 to 25 basis point front end fee on all trades going through their front end. They're making a ton of money and none of that money is accruing to uni token holders. And so I think this is a common challenge. And in some sense it's unclear to me that like crypto, we started crypto with this ethos of airdrops and distributing value evenly and opening it up. But I think between regulation and just general financial incentives, it's unclear to me that we should definitely expect application layer revenue to flow down to the community.
00:29:09.473 - 00:29:12.593, Speaker A: Like it's plausible that it doesn't and life goes on.
00:29:12.689 - 00:30:03.969, Speaker B: Yeah, it's actually quite disheartening because basically, yeah, I guess regulation has been a big, big handicap for founders in this space. Right. And I think it really just comes down to having simpler frameworks for asset issuance and having different rules for unique rules created specifically for crypto that fits the flexibility and the demands of crypto and then trying to retrofit securities frameworks. Because if every single startup needs to apply for, you know, a securities license before they can issue their own token, they're just going to spend their entire venture round and the first four years doing it. And there have been examples of projects that did this. And in our previous job we actually worked with one of them called Stacks, where they registered with the SEC for their offering and we saw firsthand how cumbersome it is. It was, you know, it's not something that you send in a form, you wait a few months and it's done.
00:30:03.969 - 00:30:36.481, Speaker B: Right. It goes on for years and years, hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and reviews. And even then you have a lot of handicap about what you can or cannot do. So that basically just is out of the question for any crypto projects. So I don't know if that will change, unfortunately not at expert or regulations. But I do think you're right and that that is the biggest handicap. And just to put things in serious context as well, for Uniswap, I think in the past 365 days, so a year they made $844 million in fees.
00:30:36.481 - 00:31:00.055, Speaker B: Right. Even things like AAVE, they made $270 million in fees. MakerDAO made like $274 million in fees, all according to Token Terminal. So these are not inconsequential numbers. Apps are actually making a lot of money. It's just that, you know, a lot of, a lot of this distributed back to holders. But if I remember correctly, I think Maker actually does burn part of the supply with the revenue.
00:31:00.055 - 00:31:00.415, Speaker B: Right?
00:31:00.495 - 00:31:03.887, Speaker A: They do, they do. I'm also forgetting the exact mechanics, but.
00:31:03.911 - 00:31:09.135, Speaker B: Is this just, you know, do they just not care about regulations or do they have like a unique structure? Do you know what's going on there?
00:31:09.295 - 00:31:18.503, Speaker A: There's something they do that like there's a die component to it as well. But yeah, I think there are just teams that care less about regulations and teams that are very regulation sensitive.
00:31:18.599 - 00:31:50.385, Speaker B: Yeah, it does seem like regulation is the thing that keeps on mucking up the incentive alignment in crypto. Like even with ICOs. Right. I think ICOs were the best incentive alignment for holders and the long term success of a project, especially if correct vesting implemented. But because it was abused by scammers, it was regulated away. So now we end up with this weird points farming thing where it's really hard to discern which of the points farmers are actual users you want to engage with or which are just mercenaries that would go to the next one. So yeah, I think we've probably diagnosed one of the key problems here, which is regulations.
00:31:50.385 - 00:31:57.381, Speaker B: I also know you wanted to talk a little bit about Tether as well because they had a killer, killer year mostly.
00:31:57.413 - 00:32:14.105, Speaker A: I think when we talk about the application layer, we're very obsessed with token based businesses. But there are lots of successes. Like in some sense Tether is a success on the application layer and it may be the best business ever in crypto. There was a chart recently that showed that they made $45 million per employee in the first quarter.
00:32:14.725 - 00:32:18.815, Speaker B: Per employee. Oh, Jesus Christ. How big are they?
00:32:18.975 - 00:32:36.343, Speaker A: I'm forgetting, I think they make like 4 billion. I think they're like 40, 50 people. It's the world's best business, right? They don't do anything. They just take your money and they put it into the bank and then they earn all the interest on it. It's literally like among the world's best businesses. And we don't talk about these outcomes, but they're real. And so I mean there is venture funding in tether killers.
00:32:36.343 - 00:33:20.785, Speaker A: Like that's a category because venture capitalists realize that there's a big outcome here. I also think increasingly a place to pay attention to is really monetization of front ends. Like when we talk about the application layer in Defi, we traditionally think of the AAVEs and lidos and uniswaps of this world. But when we think of the protocols themselves, but we are seeing a ton of teams making very significant amounts of revenue just by being the front end by which people access DeFi. So Bonkbot has made $70 million all time revenue, which I think is shockingly high. I think most L1s and L2s haven't made that pump fund has made $42 million since they launched. We already know MetaMask makes hundreds of millions of dollars.
00:33:20.785 - 00:34:04.895, Speaker A: Uniswap is on tact make hundreds of millions of dollars with their front end fee. And so I think increasingly founders in Defi should think about the fact that there are lots of actually price insensitive users when they're buying these assets. And so I actually think it is worth looking at very strong revenue based businesses that just monetize via trading fees or MEV and build a really good UI and UI UX to access DeFi. Like I think we should expect to see more and more. We should expect to see more and more value accrete to that layer. Now, whether there is a token play there, I know some of the telegram bots have tokens. I don't know how the relationship between Bonkbot's revenue and Bonkbot's token.
00:34:04.895 - 00:34:21.109, Speaker A: I don't know if this accrues to tokens. I don't know if these businesses look a lot closer to Robinhood. But in general I think that's a place where it's underrated how much money telegram bots make. And I feel like people just don't talk about it because it's kind of this weird category of crypto.
00:34:21.277 - 00:34:56.352, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess there was a narrative at one point where people were buying these tokens and running them up. But I think that the broader point here is still in order to have a valuable token and a sizable outcome as an application, you need to make these revenues, you need to create a product that the market wants and will pay for and will use consistently and you can retain these users. And that's a lot, lot harder than, you know, building an infrastructure project with like 3 users but just cooking up Good marketing and convincing people that this thing has like 2% shot of becoming Ethereum. That's why it should be at least, you know, a few hundred million dollars.
00:34:56.408 - 00:35:51.849, Speaker A: I don't disagree, but the only counterpoint I'll make is that right now those projects actually raise at hundreds of millions and billions of dollars. And then if they're unsuccessful, they end up having valuations that look very similar to where they raised that. Like that is kind of a trend we've seen over the last year, which means that maybe there is still a way for founders to get rich, but at least outside investors and aren't making a lot of wealth on these teams that are shooting to be Solana killers but kind of fail just because the valuation is a few hundred million dollars or one billion dollars. Because that is where the fundraisers are happening. And I mean, I don't think anyone would say Solana doesn't work hard, right? Like that team has, in Anatoly's words, loves eating glass. They've worked extraordinarily hard, came back after ftx. Anatoly is on my timeline every day talking about what the future of Solana will look like, how they're going to add asynchronous execution, how they're going to deal with State Plot.
00:35:51.849 - 00:36:23.489, Speaker A: Like he is like a 99th caliber founder who is still working very hard to make sure Solana wins. And so I think people like writing off infrastructure successes, but when you ignore the outcomes that are like, oh, this thing trades at a few billion dollars and there are no users and kind of focus on the ones that really do win, like Solana, I think you do have to point out that the Solana team deserves their success. Well and truly deserves their success. And I think there's like almost no team in crypto that could have done what they've done over the last four year cycle.
00:36:23.597 - 00:37:30.305, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't disagree. I think there's probably like 5 or 10 L1s or L2s that deserve their valuation when I look at how the market is pricing them. But then there's probably a hundred L1s, like ghost L1s with like two users that I have no idea why they're trading where they are. And I don't want to name specific ones. But just go on Coingecko and scroll through the top 200 and listeners can tell us, how many of these chains have you actually used? How many of these chains do you know people who use them who are still valuable at at least like $300 million? And you know, I Always think about the question, who is actually making money in this game? Because I thought this ARP would close this, this, this L1 premium kind of fat protocols thesis was extremely profitable in 2017 during ICOs when majority of the ICOs were L1s and there was no vesting. So you, you know, bid an ICO at like 30 million, they list at a billion and instantly you cash out. So there was a lot of cases like that that we saw and then that became a little bit harder in the subsequent cycle in 2020-2021 where you start to have more standard venture rounds where your tokens are locked for two to four years.
00:37:30.305 - 00:38:15.749, Speaker B: So you actually have to work with the team. You can't just like flip it and then. But then the valuations are still quiet, you know, reasonable. I think Solana's first round, if I remember correctly, it's definitely in the eight figures, probably like 30 to 50 million dollars. But then now the first round for L1 stick for this cycle would be like 500 million already. So I think the arb is closing like nature is healing. So over time if VCS start to realize that, oh shit, we're actually not making that much money backing on Infra, like we're, we're maybe making 20% profit on infra that does, you know, you know, relatively well, but not like Solana level, then they might have to kind of be forced into different lanes and whichever fund goes first probably gets to reap some of the biggest rewards.
00:38:15.749 - 00:38:51.219, Speaker B: And we already see some of the funds that are very application focused that have bet on some of the biggest winners of the cycle. So OpenSea, polymarket forecaster, the one confirmation was one fund that did all three of them years ago and they very, very much focused on the application side. But I'm curious whether there is a chicken and egg problem here. Do you think we have good enough Infra to support an application that will eventually bring on millions of people? Or do we just need an app that can actually bring on millions of people to warrant that type of infra?
00:38:51.307 - 00:39:34.405, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's tricky. There are like to take Polymarket as an example, I think Polymarket, the actual trading right now is capable of being handled by blockchains. But if we were to assume Poly Market starts bringing in a ton of high frequency traders, a ton of news traders and it starts becoming more and more complicated, then it is going to be tricky to move it on chain. I was listening to the CEO of Wintermute do a podcast recently where he said everyone who thinks most Trading will be done on chain is completely delusional. It's just not going to happen. The laws of physics prevent this. And so I think we have pretty good infra like we really do.
00:39:34.405 - 00:40:32.907, Speaker A: I also think there are specific infrastructure problems that need to be solved which is that sometimes when you try and make deposits to Poly Market you get confused by which stablecoin provider you're using. And they've actually just launched a new fix that lets you both deposit with stablecoins and use different networks. And so making onboarding flows which doesn't feel necessarily like infrastructure be a lot more seamless is one part of infrastructure as well. And so I think there are smaller things to make the UI UX better that are worth investing in. I also think it is like I'm pretty comfortable making the bet that infrastructure will like we need more high performance infrastructure in the next five to 10 years. Like I really feel quite comfortable assuming that, you know, ethereum worked in 2020 for DeFi and then it kind of stopped working. Like it really ran out of scale and then we built a bunch of roll ups and we had higher performance chains like Solana.
00:40:32.907 - 00:41:01.757, Speaker A: But even those run into scaling issues these days in various ways. And I think you can just expect that like if you think crypto will grow, demand for block for higher performance, secure compute and block space will grow. So I do think it makes sense to continue backing infrastructure that gets more and more powerful. But I think it's also worth paying attention to what are the specific hurdles that infrastructure builders face and how can we fix those specifically.
00:41:01.861 - 00:42:30.585, Speaker B: Yeah, and I do think that if you zoom out, it is actually less cynical than crypto Twitter will have you believe as well as far as the arc of infrastructure goes. Because if I think about the infra that were raised that were raising back in the initial kind of ICO or 2018, 2019 cycle, a lot of the pitches that I got were differentiation based on very kind of crypto native features. What I mean is like instead of thinking about okay, how do we build a chain so that you can build a real time or FTX feature, parity exchange, they're thinking about okay, how do we make it so that, you know, we can have different committees on the chain to kind of, you know, have a unique governance type of model. So they're thinking from the lens of like how do we create an interesting cypherpunk experiment instead of how do we build something that is production ready for application developers. That wasn't even part of the conversation people were just discussing okay, what are the best ways to auction off block spaces? Should we do some sort of auction type model with polkadot and so on? And then now the conversations with infrastructure founders are very different. It's more along the lines of, hey, we have developers that want to build this social application that is going to require 100,000 transactions throughput per second, but no one else is being able to handle this, so we have to build something there. So I think the framing of how to build infra and what we're building the infra for has changed throughout the years.
00:42:30.585 - 00:42:37.729, Speaker B: And that's actually very optimistic because that means that people actually want to build in crypto. So I think that's, that's quite interesting.
00:42:37.817 - 00:43:42.635, Speaker A: I think just one thing I would add there is that application layer builders and infrastructure builders should spend a little more energy thinking about things that can happen on chain that can't happen off chain. So I think a good example of this is Pump Fun and the recent rise of meme coins on Solana, where Solana Dex volumes are now almost triple those on Ethereum, I believe is actually fascinating to me because all of it is in meme coins, of which I think there are Thousands and almost 3,000 created every day these days on Solana. And the fascinating thing to me about that is that centralized exchanges don't have an answer to that. Like the Binance and Pibits and coinbases of this world cannot credibly create 4,000 assets in a day and create a trading venue for them. And that's just kind of the magic of what you can do on chain that you can't do off chain. And there are unique problems to be solved there, like, okay, how do we do liquidity for this? How do we do liquidity for these assets? And Pump Fun actually does a great job of kind of socializing the cost of that liquidity over all the early buyers. Because if you buy on the bonding curve, your money is eventually used to seed a radium pool.
00:43:42.635 - 00:43:55.131, Speaker A: But I do think it's worth spending a lot of time. Like what can be done uniquely on chain that cannot be done off chain tends to lead to much more interesting outcomes, in my opinion.
00:43:55.203 - 00:44:24.247, Speaker B: Yeah, and that is one of the three pillars of our thesis attention as well. Just build shit that you can't do off chain. And as you were saying that, that kind of gave me another thought as well. I wonder if the future of applications in crypto will almost exclude VCs and doxed founders just because of the regulation thing. It's incredibly hard, like you said. To launch any type of value accretive token in a regulated way. So what would end up happening is probably a lot of founders will become anonymous.
00:44:24.247 - 00:44:54.029, Speaker B: So like Razor for Friendtech is already a good example of this. But I don't know if Razer doxed himself to. I think Paradigm was their biggest investor. I don't know if they dox themselves to the paradigm. But most venture funds, we also have compliance departments for good reason to not allow you to invest in just founders when you don't even know who they are. So maybe a lot of the VCs will actually be not able to actually invest in that kind of cohort of founders. And you know, we've invested in anonymous founders before in our previous jobs and you know, to do kind of mixed effect as well.
00:44:54.029 - 00:45:05.167, Speaker B: So I wonder if it's just going to become a very cyberpunk thing where the most used applications are all just launched by anons and they're community funded because they can't raise a single dollar from regulated entities. Now is that a potential outcome you see as well?
00:45:05.231 - 00:45:33.001, Speaker A: I think that's a potential outcome. I think the other outcome that I think you shouldn't underrate is just that a lot of this regulation pressure comes from America and if you are like if your company is based entirely outside the US and does not have an American nexus of any sort, it makes it much more challenging for the US government to go after you. And so in some sense maybe it moves to being Anon and cyberpunk, maybe it just moves out of America, which I would love.
00:45:33.073 - 00:45:42.817, Speaker B: They all moved to the Bahamas and I guess time zone wise, I don't know if Bahamas is actually still pretty bad for us time zone wise, but these less EST time zone calls would be good.
00:45:42.881 - 00:45:55.593, Speaker A: I mean I do think places like Singapore and Dubai are far more open to these classes of business and are far more thoughtful with the kinds of regulation they are thinking of making than the US but also maybe Trump gets elected and all of this changes. So what do I know?
00:45:55.689 - 00:46:34.353, Speaker B: Yeah, so the elections is actually a big big part of this as well. And I was talking to Ilya, the founder of near recently on this show as well and one thing he mentioned was they are going to create AI bots on chain to allow people to create applications with natural language. So imagine ChatGPT where someone like me, I just go in and type hey I want a dex like uniswap. But instead of a typical kind of AMM curve we do this and this and this and it just codes it out for you and ships that out for you. So that becomes the future where apps can easily be written and iterated upon by AI. Then we need more infra instead of app. Thesis might actually be correct.
00:46:34.353 - 00:46:43.249, Speaker B: Right, in that we don't even need people building apps if we have AI, which is writing apps for us, but we do need people kind of creating this infrastructure. What do you think about that?
00:46:43.417 - 00:46:45.085, Speaker A: I believe it when I see it.
00:46:47.265 - 00:47:21.911, Speaker B: Very typical silent answer. I like that. Yeah, it is pretty far out. But that would be interesting to see and I think to wrap it up, just to kind of give an overview of where the money is actually flowing. Since a lot of people are debating whether we should invest in infra, whether we should invest in apps, and some people are saying we are investing in more apps. I saw this report by Galaxy that I will link in the show notes below that was basically showing the number of deals that were done in apps versus Infra. And I think the way they define infra and apps are a little bit, you know, wonky.
00:47:21.911 - 00:47:46.845, Speaker B: So I'm not going to take into exact numbers, but there were like two big applications that raised that, that, that kind of put a dent in this thesis that, hey, no one's funding applications because people are so like Forecaster, we talked about it in the beginning. They raised $150 million round. And then there's this one called Zentry as well, which is kind of like a layer four games that that raised. Have you seen that thing before?
00:47:46.975 - 00:47:53.285, Speaker A: I had not. I saw it in the show notes and I kind of looked it up. But clearly I'm just out of the loop on this category, I suppose.
00:47:53.705 - 00:48:22.415, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's interesting. So if we break it down by a share of VC capital invested by category, like in the last quarter alone, 24% of that is in web3nft, metaverse, DAO gaming. And so this includes both Zentry and forecaster. And then 15% is in infra and then 12% in layer one, 7% in L2. So you have add all those together. The disparity is actually not that big. It's like 35% in infra and 24% in applications.
00:48:22.415 - 00:48:30.180, Speaker B: Did that surprise you to see that the gap? Because on Twitter alone you would have thought, okay, application would be like 1% and infra would be like 99.
00:48:30.234 - 00:49:10.115, Speaker A: I'm actually less surprised because I know that VCs are dying for application layer outcomes. Like if you saw, if you show any amount of growth in a new application, you will get funded because there is lots of blue ocean territory. And I really think CT has memory hold how much money crypto venture capital has put into gaming. Like we went really hard, there was a lot of Dow tooling investment also but gaming just like was unstoppable. Metaverse and gaming stuff. And like I said I am hopeful for that sector but it's been some time and we haven't seen particularly successful outcomes. And so I actually expect that funding to slow down.
00:49:10.115 - 00:49:48.427, Speaker A: But I think CT kind of thinks that CT sometimes kind of imagines that VCs sit in this cabal boardroom and decide what the industry is going to look like in the next three years. And that's just not how it works. Like if gaming takes off, venture capitalists will pour a bunch of money into gaming. We saw honestly Farcaster's growth relative to any credible Web2 social network is is paltry. It rounds to zero and yet it's able to raise $150 million because we actually are dying to see large outcomes in the application layer. And so I know that you show the slightest amount of growth in the application layer, VCs will invest.
00:49:48.531 - 00:50:15.831, Speaker B: Yeah and I think that's a good note to end us on. We are all looking for applications and we are actually putting money into applications. If you look at the share of venture capital, is it enough? Maybe. But I do think that there are a lot of things that are outside of the hands of the market. Right. In terms of like regulation, in terms of the fact that the layer 1 outcomes are bigger that I do think will solve over time. So I'm pretty I'm very, very bullish on the future of applications in crypto.
00:50:15.831 - 00:50:52.759, Speaker B: So we'll continue pouring money in and we'll see how it goes in a few years. So I know a lot of listeners at home probably have strong thoughts about this topic as well. So if you have any questions, just reach out to us on Twitter and we'll see you in the next episode.
