00:00:02.120 - 00:00:08.754, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Blockcrunch podcast, the go to podcast for investors and builders in crypto.
00:00:16.894 - 00:00:23.234, Speaker B: This episode of the Blockcrunch podcast is brought to you by coin, flex and Periswap. Stick around to learn more.
00:00:23.854 - 00:01:02.554, Speaker A: Hey, everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Blockcrunch podcast. Now, if you've been following my show for a while, you know that I'm pretty excited about the financialization that's happening on nfts because I think it's a combination of DeFi, which is my favorite vertical in crypto, and also nfts, which is one of the things I'm most fascinated about lately. So I'm really, really excited to have Steven Young, the co founder of Nifty Fi, which is an NFT lending platform that lets people borrow against their nfts. Now, just to give you a little background here, since 2020, Nifty Fi has underwritten more than 5000 loans and recorded more than 80 million in cumulative loan volume. So that's pretty sizable. And it's one of the more exciting projects in the NFT financialization space.
00:01:02.554 - 00:01:05.334, Speaker A: So I'm really excited to chat with Stephen. So welcome to the show.
00:01:05.754 - 00:01:25.558, Speaker C: Hey, Jason, thanks really very much for having me. Super excited to chat to you. Actually, since we released those stats, we're now on 128 million in loans and 128 million volume, over 7000 loans. So stats have moved on since two months ago. Really. It's been, been a crazy ride.
00:01:25.726 - 00:01:36.834, Speaker A: Yeah, that's amazing. And we're definitely going to dive into just how you achieve that growth. But I guess going back to day one, Red Steven, how did you identify the opportunity for Nifty five? Why did you decide to work on this specifically?
00:01:37.374 - 00:02:18.112, Speaker C: Yeah, so I spent most of my career building fintech solutions. So either asset managers, finance, so I was kind of very familiar with the traditional finance space, got very deep into crypto 2016, 2017. Couldn't get the asset manager I was working for to take that seriously at all. So left to go find an exchange. I was there for a little while and basically realized exchanges are just centralized financial service providers that are selling tokens instead of stocks. It was very similar, lots of regulation. It's the same kind of business.
00:02:18.112 - 00:03:01.074, Speaker C: So I really wanted to do something that was properly decentralized, really kind of had that decentralization ethos. And then, so that was the one part of it. The second part of it was I've been an artist my entire life. So I've been painting and drawing, doing generative art, and really kind of a high school the choice for me was between software developer and artist and it was easy to pay the bills as a software developer, so decided to go down that route. So, yeah, so that kind of gives you a little bit of background. And then my original co founder Mads, so he, I've invested in his startup, which were years ago, so we knew each other very well. And he's been deep into the NFT space since day one.
00:03:01.074 - 00:03:54.714, Speaker C: So 2017 cryptokitties days deep, deep, deep into the space. Was one of the largest breeders of cryptokitties at one point, you know, has a few thousand cryptokitties and has been kind of buying and trading nfts since you could get autoglyphs for less than two ether and punks for free. So he basically, I gave him a call and was like talking to him a little bit about the Ethereum markets and thinking about taking out a maker CDP. And then he basically said to me, well, you know, what I really want is I'd like to leverage my cats to long Ethereum. And so we started talking about that and just did a quick little brainstorm to say, well, what would that look like? And then two weeks later we had the first version of the smart contract and four months after that we went live with the first version of the protocol.
00:03:54.834 - 00:03:57.770, Speaker A: So it was really 2018 or that.
00:03:57.802 - 00:04:15.574, Speaker C: Was we started the conversation 2019 and then I started building the contract in like Jan 2020, Jan, Feb 2020 and then launched the first 1st public loan was in end of May 2020.
00:04:16.154 - 00:04:37.374, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. You guys really captured that NFT way very, very early on. And I'm curious, like in terms of NFT lending and borrowing, right now I really see two types of projects, right? There's projects like Nifty five that lets you borrow against your nfts, but there's also projects that let you borrow the actual nfts. So I'm curious, how did you evaluate these two market opportunities when you were first deciding to start Niftyfi?
00:04:37.684 - 00:05:08.376, Speaker C: Yeah, so that's actually quite a very interesting question. So I think so, first of all, let's roll back a little bit. So 2020, there weren't that many nfts that actually had a use, right? Like bored apes weren't around it. You couldn't get into like fancy yacht parties if you owned a bored ape. You know, like the whole like craziness that's with Sky Maven and axie Infinity. Like that hadn't really happened yet. They hadn't quite cracked that play to earn model or at least the guild model.
00:05:08.376 - 00:06:10.574, Speaker C: So back then there was less need to rent an NFT. And then the second thing for me that was when you're doing a loan, you can treat all nfts essentially the same because of the ERC 721 standard, they all have a transfer function and a, you know, so I could treat all nfts basically the same. That where they differ was kind of in figuring out what the valuation is and from having a peer to peer model that then gets pushed onto the lender side. Whereas if you want to do rentals, to do a rental, the current rental models mostly are deposit some collateral, some type of crypto, and then you get the person's NFT, and if you don't give it back, you lose your collateral. And for me, I think that's interesting. But I think the real model is being able to keep ownership of the asset, just rent out usage of that. And to be able to do that, you have to.
00:06:10.574 - 00:06:52.186, Speaker C: It requires custom work for every NFT project because how they're being used in that ecosystem differs from each project. So how you would use assets from Wolfgang are very different to how you would use assets in Decentraland, which is also very different from how you would use something in axie infinity. So you can't just have one generic rental contract that works across all platforms. So that was kind of what was appealing to me. I could build something where we could treat nfts at the standard level as the same and then kind of grow the market that way without needing to have new development effort. Every new project that we want to.
00:06:52.210 - 00:07:05.924, Speaker A: Support, that makes a lot of sense. And we're going to dive into how you select what projects to whitelist later on. But just to make sure that listeners follow along, what type of assets can people borrow on Nifty five right now and what kind of collateral can they use today?
00:07:06.304 - 00:07:37.990, Speaker C: Yeah, so on the collateral side, we've got about 120 projects that are whitelisted. Most of the volume is kind of really in the top ten of those projects. And to give you a sense of what those are, it's board apiad clubs. Cryptopunks is number one. There are, let me just look here again. So, yeah, wrap crypto punks, portape mutant apes, Zuki doodles, Vfriend, Clonex, world of women. They're kind of art blocks.
00:07:37.990 - 00:08:14.394, Speaker C: They're kind of the top ten projects over the last month, and most of the volume sits there. And then there's a lot of these kind of long tail assets. There's quite a lot of loan volume on, but they, the lower value loans. So sandbox land is, we've done the most loans on sandbox land, but they're kind of in the one to two ether range, whereas the crypto punk loans are 7 million, $8 million, some of them. So by the number of loans, the cheaper assets are competing, but in total volume, they're not quite.
00:08:15.294 - 00:08:29.414, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. And I think that brings me to my next question, which is the typical loan duration right now in FT five, I think, or 714, 30 and 90 days. So what are the borrowers doing in those periods? Like, why would someone need to borrow something for like seven days?
00:08:30.074 - 00:09:23.064, Speaker C: Yeah, so it depends a little bit on the, on the actual person's strategy. So everything from, so somebody was on a margin position on some other, like either Dex or centralized platform, they're getting margin called. They need some liquidity quickly, but they don't want to sell their nfts. So they'll take out a loan, cover their margin call, and then kind of, then they have extra seven days to move other things around to pay. Other people are doing it specifically to do leverage trades. So I know somebody, for example, who takes out a loan using his assets, then goes and trades that at leverage on a central exchange and then hopes that it goes his way. Other people are using it as part of this strategy in the broader play to earn ecosystem.
00:09:23.064 - 00:10:07.670, Speaker C: So one of our users is a really big wolf game player. He's figured out like a pattern that works for him. He's got a bunch of apes. So basically uses his apes to get some capital to put to work inside Wolfgang. And he knows he can produce a higher yield in Wolfgang than he is paying on interest for his loan. So basically taking out a loan and then doing an active strategy in some other kind of play to earn the game, then, you know, there's other things like people just needing money for day to day stuff. So one of our users got a people for $1 in the original sale in the Beeple, everyday sale.
00:10:07.670 - 00:11:10.138, Speaker C: Then lockdown happened, needed some cash, managed to take out a 50k loan on that people and that like, allowed them to tide over the period when kind of things were tough. And then just the other day we had somebody who wanted to donate a four x four to Ukraine, wanted to do it straight away, was getting a bonus at the end of the month, but had a doodle. So he used the doodle to get collateral to take out a loan to pay for the four x four, to take it to the Ukraine and then pay that back later when he got the other cash coming in from other sources. So really it's a little bit of everything. The other big one is people who are just traders who, they bought nfts early, like the NFT rich but crypto poor. So they want to be able to take advantage of opportunities in the market. So some of them will just literally take out a 90 day loan and just roll it all the time so that they just, they've got the cash available so they can jump on opportunities when they see them.
00:11:10.138 - 00:11:15.706, Speaker C: So it varies a lot by different users, but those are the main ones, I'd say. Yeah.
00:11:15.730 - 00:11:57.964, Speaker A: And that makes a lot of sense because nfts are always so illiquid that to monetize them, there's no easy way to do it. You can fractionalize them, maybe, but arguably fractionalization hasn't really taken off. So this idea of like, lending them out and then borrowing against your nfts and using the capital to earn a yield makes a lot of sense for, especially the Defi degens out there. And I guess on that point, I noticed that, you know, for the shorter term loans, the average APR recently is, I think, about 900 ish percent, which comes down to effectively like two to 3% for a ten day loan, for instance, and longer durations around 90%. So these aprs, to me, at least on paper, seems quite high. So I'm curious, how are people setting these rates? And do you expect them to go up higher over time or lower over time?
00:11:58.264 - 00:12:33.698, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think there's a lot of nuance missed if you're just looking at the averages. So to give you an idea, we did two $8 million loans on 205 crypto punks in the last 30 days. Both of those were kind of sitting at the ten ish percent APR, so. But that's lower LTV. So LTV is low into value. So basically those people borrowed 30% of the total value of the punks and got a 10% APR for that.
00:12:33.698 - 00:13:26.398, Speaker C: If you want to borrow 60% of the total value, you're going to pay a higher APR because then the risk is higher on the lender that the market dumps, and then they basically get defaulted on because the asset isn't worth as much as the loan anymore. So higher LTV, the higher your APR, and then the same with different projects. So punks and apes and autoglyphs tend to easily get below 20% aprs. Newer projects where it's a little bit more volatile, there hasn't been this long history of it retaining value through different, I'd say long history, like long history in NFT space, in NFT time, but they don't have a history of retaining value. So again, the risk is higher that that asset is going to drop in price. So you also tend to pay higher ltvs there. And then the, I mean, aprs.
00:13:26.398 - 00:14:29.124, Speaker C: And then the other thing which you, which you did mention is longer term loans tend to have higher aprs, lower aprs instead of shorter term ones, which is a little bit the opposite of you would normally see in the market, because the longer the loan, the more the risk is, actually. But for a lender, those seven day loans is the amount of work to value these assets and check that, making sure that you're giving a good offer, it's just not worth it for them to do if they're only making 0.001 ether on that actual loan. There's a little bit of like a floor price of how much, what's the minimum somebody will take the effort to actually value the asset for. And that's why you see the shorter term loans tend to have a higher APR. But I think you'll see then it'll drop, I think, down to like 90 days. But I think once we start doing 180 or 360 day loans, you'll probably start seeing the APR kind of increasing again on the higher end of those loans.
00:14:30.034 - 00:14:48.570, Speaker A: And on the point about liquidations, right now, I think the default rate on Nifty five is about 10% only. So how do defaults happen? Is the collateralization ratio set by each person, or do you have a general percentage where if it drops by, say, like 30%, we're going to liquidate you? And if that liquidation happens, how does it work?
00:14:48.722 - 00:15:47.034, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think this is a very key design decision that we made from the start, and it's worth understanding. And it's also one of the reasons I think it's going to be harder, excuse me, to do amm style, peer to protocol loans in the NFT space. So as a collector, you don't want to run the risk of being liquidated when there's an adverse market event. Right. So if you think about it in terms of, say, you've got ethernet and you've got a maker loan, and you get liquidated in that you might not have the cash, but when you get the cash again, you can always buy back more ether. If you get liquidated, say you've got a alien crypto punk, and then you get liquidators on the alien crypto punk. There's no guarantee that you could ever buy that asset back again because there's so few of them, once people have them, they don't really want to sell them.
00:15:47.034 - 00:16:22.144, Speaker C: It's a very for big collectors, running the risk of being auto liquidated is a very, very scary thing for them to do. So the way our loans work is that they are fixed period loans. So we don't keep track of your collateralization ratio at all. There's no oracles we don't. We like as a platform. We actually have no idea how much the asset is actually worth. All we do is we get an offer from a lender to say, I'll give you ten ether over 90 days at a 50% APR.
00:16:22.144 - 00:16:55.254, Speaker C: But what that means then is the borrower always has the choice to decide if they want to pay back the loan or not. And in default only happens if your loan period is expired and you haven't made the actual payment. And after that period of time, then the borrower, I mean the lender, can default on that asset and they would execute a manual transaction to move it out of our escrow wallet into their personal wallet. But that can only happen after your agreed upon loan period has expired.
00:16:55.834 - 00:17:24.045, Speaker B: Before I continue, I'd love to share more about a later sponsor, Coinflex. Now, Coinflex is an exchange that's been around for a while. They're actually doing $1.5 billion in daily trading volume right now. Recently, their team reached out and walked me through their latest product, the AMM plus. In short, it lets anybody earn fees as market makers on the Coinflex exchange simply by depositing their assets. As of this recording, the seven day in range average for ETH AMM pool depositors is 82%.
00:17:24.045 - 00:18:02.060, Speaker B: So how does this work? If you're familiar with how other amms out there work, this is very similar. You can basically select what price range to provide liquidity for, and the UI even shows you your risk under different scenarios. I also love that they have this cross collateral system, so you can market make in any market you want using pretty much any collateral you have. If you know how to manage your risks, you can even access up to ten x leverage while providing liquidity. So this is one of the most creative ways I've seen a company borrow elements from Defi in a centralized exchange setting. So I highly encourage you to check it out@coinflex.com. Amm now I'd like to take a moment to talk about our sponsor, Paraswap as well.
00:18:02.060 - 00:18:31.530, Speaker B: As you know, Paraswap is one of the best places to execute any trades in DeFi if you want to find the best prices and best quotes for any token trades, just go on Paraswap IO, and the router will immediately help you find the best execution across different exchanges. Now what's more interesting is that recently they just had a massive update, which is gas refunds, meaning stakers will get their gas rebated to them in the form of PSP tokens. Now this brings your cost for transacting on Paraswap down even further. So I'm super excited to share this.
00:18:31.562 - 00:18:32.618, Speaker A: Update with the community.
00:18:32.746 - 00:18:38.594, Speaker B: And if you're interested, check this out for yourself. Go on over to Paraswap IO blockcrench to learn more.
00:18:39.414 - 00:18:42.634, Speaker A: So there's no auto liquidation, no concept of oracles at all.
00:18:43.134 - 00:19:08.334, Speaker C: Exactly. Just because people don't want to be exposed to this risk of being auto liquidated, because some people will, they'll be willing to pay even if the asset is now worth less than the original loan, because they have emotional connections to it, like they believe in the long term, they're not sure that they can be able to get the asset back. So the decision is always on the borrower to decide do they want to default or not.
00:19:09.234 - 00:19:20.414, Speaker A: And have you, I guess, experimented with Oracle models before? Have you seen anything that's promising? Is that a direction that you want to push towards eventually, or is this p two P model going to be the way to go?
00:19:20.714 - 00:20:16.054, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think the way that we see it, and we already seeing this happening, is our system allows you to do programmatic offers, so you can run a bot that goes and looks at new listings, goes and does some kind of auto evaluation, and then makes an offer based on that valuation. So really we see us as the execution platform on which you settle these loans. But other people can run automated lending strategies just by interacting with us at a programmatic level. So we've got one liquidity provision, DAo, that is six different bots running all kind of running slightly different strategies to find out, to kind of like maximize the yield. So that's kind of how I see it. I see liquidity providers either who specialize in specific assets or who have some kind of machine learning capability to kind of build strategies.
00:20:16.054 - 00:20:55.564, Speaker C: And then ideally, what we end up being is the platform on which these different pricing strategies compete to get the loans that are out there in the market, which should then over time, reduce the APR as more and more people are competing to make offers. And then as a lender, I mean, as a borrower, it's quite appealing because instead of getting a single offer that's calculated based on some fixed formula that's built into the smart contract. You get multiple competing offers from multiple lenders, all running slightly different strategies, which means you got more choice in picking the exact terms that suit you.
00:20:56.104 - 00:21:08.424, Speaker A: Got it. So it sounds like the efficiency of the market is coming from external sources and there's already parties that are organizing as daos to ArP potential opportunities to create these more efficient lending and borrowing.
00:21:08.464 - 00:21:10.432, Speaker C: Right, exactly. Exactly.
00:21:10.608 - 00:21:25.978, Speaker A: That's fascinating. I actually spoke to the DAO that's doing this, but I think that's alpha for another day that I'm not going to leak on this episode yet. But that was a really, really interesting conversation. And I guess on the point about collateral as well. So you mentioned you guys whitelisted, what was it, 120 projects right now?
00:21:26.176 - 00:21:26.598, Speaker C: Yep.
00:21:26.646 - 00:21:30.954, Speaker A: And how do you guys choose which projects to kind of whitelist?
00:21:31.254 - 00:22:17.164, Speaker C: Yeah, so there's a couple of things that we look at. So we, so really, for us, there's no point listing an asset that nobody will take risk on making a loan. So given like a few things that are just true about Ethereum right now is gas fees are just very expensive, especially gas fees for anything to do with nfts because it's just expensive to transfer in NFT. And then if you think about doing a loan, you need to move some ERC 20 from the lender to the borrower. You need to move the NFT out of the borrower's wallet into the escrow account. When you repay, you have to move it back out. So there's quite a lot of kind of movement that's happening there, which means there's quite a significant chunk of gas as part of that transaction.
00:22:17.164 - 00:22:58.006, Speaker C: So loans under 0.5 ether really don't make much sense because you're paying more in gas than you are actually kind of getting as part of the loan. So, yeah, so that's the one part of it. And then, so we're looking for assets kind of in the, you know, two etherish floor price so that you can actually make, make loans. Then we want to see existing history. So you want to make sure that if the lender gets a default, they can actually sell the asset. So are they, you know, is there secondary market happening? So we typically look for at least 1000 ether in trading volume.
00:22:58.006 - 00:23:21.034, Speaker C: And then the other thing that we'll do is we'll just check the smart contract, check that there's nothing kind of dodgy going on, make sure it's the original one. So we don't want to have people mint a fake punk contract and then going to go list fake punks and kind of steal money that way. So some of it is just due diligence and the other part of it is just picking assets that actually make sense as collateral on the platform.
00:23:21.634 - 00:23:25.426, Speaker A: And there's a really interesting flywheel effect that's introduced here for the NFTs.
00:23:25.450 - 00:23:25.586, Speaker C: Right.
00:23:25.610 - 00:23:50.664, Speaker A: So if your NFT art grows to a certain value above a certain floor where you're approved or whitelisted by Nifty five, suddenly there's markets around it, there's more liquidity around it, there's more ways to monetize it versus just selling. So there's less intensive to sell. So these NFTs become even more and more valuable. So it sounds like the average NFT holder should want Nifty five to whitelist their assets because it helps with that kind of flywheel.
00:23:50.834 - 00:24:40.054, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. So the better collateral the asset is, the more valuable it is because you can now leverage it without having to necessarily sell it. So, and we actually even seeing certain NFT projects using the quality of the asset as collateral as a way to support price. So we've got collections, daos that are actively making offers on their assets so that they ensure that those asset owners have a good lending experience, which makes it better collateral, which supports the price of the actual NFT. So I suspect over time you're going to see more and more projects like thinking about secondary market liquidity and lending and collateralization as part of their strategy to drive value to actual the projects that they're using.
00:24:40.554 - 00:25:15.334, Speaker A: I see, yeah, NFT projects, if you're out there listening to this, this is your growth hack, right? Provide liquidity for your lending markets so you create more value. That's really amazing insight. And Steven, you mentioned earlier about this point about p two p models versus p to pool. And I think one of the initial skepticisms people have about Nifty five's model is that everything is peer to peer. Every single loan is customized versus what they're used to in DeFi, where you just lend to a pool or borrow from a pool, don't need to worry about that. Is there a possibility that Nifty five could do something similar to p to pool or is that model just fundamentally unattainable?
00:25:16.834 - 00:26:06.072, Speaker C: I think that there's some fundamental problems with peer to pool. So I think it's very difficult to actually have a model that can give you non floor loans on a collection in the peer to pool kind of contract. So you basically, you know, it's difficult to get the maximum value out of your alien crypto punk, which is multiple million dollar asset, versus a floor crypto punk in those protocols, because they, all of the loans are just based on floor assets. So that's the one part. Second part for me is that we spoke about earlier, these auto liquidations. Just as a, as a collector, I would be super nervous using any of my favorite pieces as collateral in a protocol where I could get liquidated. So there are ways around it.
00:26:06.072 - 00:26:44.828, Speaker C: Like JPEG allows you to buy insurance. So I do think that there's, you can mitigate some of those issues. But I think the core thing to kind of the reason amms are better for fungible tokens are because they are fungible. So you can have these highly efficient protocol like markets, because you can treat every ERC 20 the same as every other ERC 20. And by definition, that's not what an NFT is. So part of what we say internally is like what a lot of those things depend on is taking the n out of the nfts. Right.
00:26:44.828 - 00:27:37.972, Speaker C: So you making non fungible tokens fungible again. So I think that that's a fundamental problem. But I do think there's probably a place, there's going to be some assets that this makes sense for. For certain use cases it makes sense, but I think that the most important thing is why are people saying that? So they're saying that because, you know, you might have to wait a long time to get an offer on your, on your asset, but you've got a, you know, top 15 or top 20 asset. With all of these people running bots, you normally get at least one or two offers within like less than an hour of actually listing. And I think as the market goes bigger, it kind of, you know, it just gets faster. And if you list something like a crypto punk or a bought ape, you will get, you know, in the first 2 hours, you'll get five to ten different offers that you can accept.
00:27:37.972 - 00:28:24.416, Speaker C: So I think it all depends on what is the problem people are trying to solve with an Amm. And for me, I think the core problem, there's two things. It's like being able to passively get exposure to these lending markets. So that's on the lender side, but on the borrower side, it's just about having an instant offer. So I think there's lots of ways to have instant offers in a peer to peer model that are way less complex than a peer to pool model or a peer to contract model. And then the passive yield is slightly different. But the way we're seeing that happening is, like I was mentioning earlier, we've got liquidity provision daos, and then you can buy into the liquidity provision DAO and then the DAO itself manages the loans and you get a passive yield that way.
00:28:24.416 - 00:28:54.888, Speaker C: So it just lifts the kind of pooling of funds like one level up on top of us. So the way I see it developing is daos that are putting liquidity that then build automation strategies to make that capital act super efficiently, and then multiple daos competing with different strategies for the same loans, which I think over time will mean that you'll get much better terms on a platform like us than you could get from an ammo.
00:28:54.996 - 00:29:41.654, Speaker A: Yeah, and I'm actually quite bullish on the idea of these daos as well because they're almost unbundling venture funds. Whereas in DeFi, a lot of hedge funds have liquidity provision as one of the value adds and that's how they get allocations and deal access. In the future, it could be liquidity provision daos offering NFT projects. Hey, if you give me say like 5% of the pre mint, I'll just provide liquidity for you and Nifty five and they can potentially compete with venture, venture funds like myself. So that's something that's really exciting, especially whenever I see things that could disrupt myself. I'm super excited about it. And I guess, are there any structural risks that you see the market posing to Nifty five? For instance, with some NFT projects or some games, we're seeing them offering borrowing and lending in game.
00:29:41.654 - 00:29:58.720, Speaker A: So in NFT worlds, for instance, they allow people to lend out their own nfts. They're not allowing people to borrow against nfts yet. But is there a risk that most games realize, wow, there's a lot of value being captured by Nifty five? Why should we leak this to them? Why shouldn't we build our own markets in house inside the game itself?
00:29:58.872 - 00:30:58.770, Speaker C: Well, look, so I think something to bear in mind about Niftify is that we both adapt in a protocol, so you can interact directly with us via our API, never touch our front end. So that's the one thing. If you're a protocol or a game and you've got a whole bunch of game mechanics to build, do you really want to go build all the lending functionality yourself too? Because it is quite complex, like being able to claim airdrops. And you know, there's a lot of stuff that you need to do to make a really good NFT learning experience for borrowers. So I do think there's probably going to be some people that decide to build it on their own. But, you know, our ideas to is it essentially become the stripe for NFT financialization, right? Like if you, if you're doing an e commerce site, you don't go build a payment processor. You know, you just plug in a payment processor because your main, like, gig is selling the thing.
00:30:58.770 - 00:31:46.062, Speaker C: It's not, it's not about processing payments. So I think that that's kind of generally the strategy there. You know, like, I do think there's, the market's so new and things are going to change so much that, you know, we're going to have to, you know, finding product market fit is an ongoing battle because as things change and things evolve, we're going to have to keep evolving with the market, but we're very focused around that. And then the other big thing that's quite difficult and probably more difficult even than the technical side of it is actually creating a market with enough liquidity and enough demand. We actually get an offer within half an hour, an hour of listing. It's like, it's a very tricky problem to do that whole chicken and an egg. You got the borrowers but you don't have the lenders.
00:31:46.062 - 00:32:10.646, Speaker C: You got the lenders, but you don't have the borrowers. And to foster that, I think, is quite difficult. So that would be the other benefit that you get from us. If you connect to us directly inside your game, you get access to all of our liquidity pools. You get access to these daos. You've built integrations with us who are putting capital to work. So it's more than just the functionality, it's also the market around it.
00:32:10.646 - 00:32:13.594, Speaker C: So for me, that's one of our key strengths.
00:32:14.094 - 00:32:22.274, Speaker A: And speaking of that, since it sounds like that's a huge part of the network effects for Nifty fi. How do you find these daos? How do you find these people to build these bots to begin with?
00:32:22.894 - 00:33:08.604, Speaker C: Yeah, so some of them just find us. Some of them we kind of worked with some of our community members. We're founding members of the DAO. We are constantly talking to, to all of the collector Daos or the liquidity provision daos. So we're really kind of trying to build that out. At the same time, we're also getting big institutions, so we've got big centralized players in Asia, us all kind of trying to figure out, okay, how do we get into this space? So I think it's daos but then there's also individuals. So we also spend a lot of time making sure that we speak to kind of people with the capital and the time and expertise to make these.
00:33:08.604 - 00:33:29.460, Speaker C: You know, our biggest lender is actually an individual who manually does loans. Right. So just one guy? One guy, yeah. And they've made one over a million dollars in the. Since November last year in interest on our platform. So. So those people are also part of it.
00:33:29.460 - 00:34:14.674, Speaker C: I do think like the big scale obviously comes from Daos because it's easier to, to kind of pool large capital. Large amounts of capital suck in lots of talent, get people to build bots and all of these kinds of things. So over time I think more of the lending volume will move to kind of professional players, and that's either daos or private entities. I think on the lending side it's mostly going to be individuals and collectors. But I also see on the borrowing side, but I also see like these people, like Flamingo or pleaserdao, you know, it's like they're sitting on massive amounts of capital locked up in these super high value nfts that they own. And at some point they're going to want to be able to leverage that capital. So I just also see things going on there.
00:34:14.674 - 00:34:51.824, Speaker C: But in general, it all happens in our discord. We spend a lot of time speaking to people. Other people have already spoken to introduce us to people. So lots of media, networking, and really most of it is actually just to understand what are the people using it for? What's not, why can't they use it? Can we build something that would work for them? So it's a little bit of that too, like understanding how the markets develop over time and the needs of these people change as they become more professional, we have to stay on top of as well. So as a side effect of that, we meet all of these people. Really?
00:34:52.524 - 00:35:05.644, Speaker A: Got it. Got it. That's super interesting. And I guess given that lenders seem to be making a lot of capital, I'm surprised to find that the number of borrowers I think is almost double that of lenders. What is the reason behind that?
00:35:06.384 - 00:35:57.912, Speaker C: So I think it speaks a little bit to what I was saying earlier. So what we're seeing is that the lending side of the market is consolidating because there's quite a lot of advantage to being able to a pool a lot of capital and be like building up experience on what does a good offer look like? What's the strategy? How do you know? Looking at other people's offers where do you put your offer. So there's a little bit of edge just in terms of experience. So we'll see. When people start getting good at it, they start kind of pushing up the rankings quite quickly on the lending side. On the borrowing side, it's a little bit less around being a pro. It's more about lots of different people have these assets and for different reasons at different time, they need an actual loan.
00:35:57.912 - 00:36:26.704, Speaker C: So it kind of makes sense that you like as a borrower, every now and then you need a loan. As a lender, once you figure out a strategy that can make you a lot of money, you just like going in there trying to do more. So we see, like, more professionalization and consolidation on the lender side spreading out and becoming more acceptable for people who aren't super pro NFT or finance people to actually take out their loan. So that's kind of my take on that.
00:36:27.124 - 00:36:47.622, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. And I guess for the last part, I'd like to zoom out a little bit, Stephen, and kind of look at where you, you think things are headed. So right now, I think you mentioned there's about $120 million in loans generated. What will bring the next billion? Like, what is it the growth of games? Is it art collection or what do you see as the biggest tailwinds for you guys?
00:36:47.798 - 00:37:24.878, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think. I think there's a couple of things just to kind of bear in mind and just to have a sense for how tiny the market still is and, like, where we started. Okay, I'm just going to give you some sense of growth. Right. So for us, we did in all of 2020, we did $300,000 in the whole of 2020. So far this month, we haven't had a single day where we did less than $300,000 in 2021, we did 40 million in total in 2022.
00:37:24.878 - 00:37:53.458, Speaker C: So far we've done 87 million in loans. So we're starting from a very low base. So that's point number 1. Second point is, if you add up all of the loan volume for lending in the NFT space, it's around about 0.5% of the total NFT market. Typically you're seeing ten to 30% penetration of lending markets into mature markets. Right? So.
00:37:53.458 - 00:39:18.786, Speaker C: So even if the NFT market doesn't grow, the lending market still has 20 x to go. And then, you know, as I'm sure you like also buying this thesis, NFts are just going to be giant going forward, you know? So I think if you look in the real world, there's way more of the total value in the world is locked up in non fungible assets than in fungible assets. And I think over the course of the next five to ten years, you're going to see that flipping happening in the crypto space as well, where the total value represented by NFTs is going to surpass the total value that's represented by fungible tokens. So if you put those three things together, I just think that the size of this market is just so gigantic and there's so much work to do to just educate people that you can actually now use this image of a, like an ape to do real world loans for significant sums of money and it's safe. So I think there's a lot of education kind of happening in there. So I would just say if the NFT market just keeps doing what I'm pretty sure it's going to be doing, and people become more aware that NFTs are also financial assets that you can use to kind of do stuff in the real world. I just, I think that's going to be enough to grow the markets.
00:39:18.786 - 00:39:35.294, Speaker C: And then for us specifically, our job really is to make sure that we stay on the front lines and speak to people and make sure that we evolve our product to meet the needs of collectors and lenders as the market develops and changes.
00:39:35.994 - 00:40:03.724, Speaker A: Yeah, this is super exciting because we're only talking about mostly like, digitally native art and game assets. We're not even talking about real world assets whose ownerships are tied to NFTs. So who's to say that I can't use an NFT, which is actually a claim on my house on Nifty fi? So I'm super excited about this market as well. And I'm sure a lot of listeners are desperate to learn more. So as a final part, Stephen, for people who want to follow you and understand more about what you're working on, what are the best channels for them to do this?
00:40:04.224 - 00:40:34.032, Speaker C: Yeah, you can. So Twitter is probably good. So our handle is there's a link on there to join our discord. That's probably the best place. Got a bunch of ambassadors, lots of borrowers and lenders who are very happy to help new people kind of come along the journey and. Yeah, and then our website is nftfi.com, so feel free to check that out and jump in the discord and people will help.
00:40:34.208 - 00:40:38.364, Speaker A: Sounds good. Yeah, I'm super excited. Thank you so much, Stephen, for coming on. This has been a delight.
00:40:38.784 - 00:40:39.984, Speaker C: Awesome. Thanks for having me, Jason.
