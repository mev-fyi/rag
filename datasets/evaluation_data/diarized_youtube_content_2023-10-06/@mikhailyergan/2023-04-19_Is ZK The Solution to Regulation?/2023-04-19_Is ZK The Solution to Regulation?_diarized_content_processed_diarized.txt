00:00:00.250 - 00:00:37.480, Speaker A: Welcome back to Network Spotlight. I am Mikhail. Why do we need zk technology in the world of privacy? Let's answer this question and more on today's show. Dylan is the CTO of Zero X KYC, which is a private ZK identity verification service on chain. They're working to help DAos avoid OFAC sanctioned countries and find the middle ground between preserving privacy and regulation. Please like comment and subscribe to support the amazing guests on the show. Let's jump right in.
00:00:37.480 - 00:00:47.706, Speaker A: Thanks so much for joining me on the show. How are you doing?
00:00:47.808 - 00:00:51.600, Speaker B: I'm doing great. Doing great. Pleasure to be here. Thank you.
00:00:51.970 - 00:01:05.790, Speaker A: Absolutely. It's great to. Great to have you here. Now, Dylan, I know that you work with Zero X KYC, so just for the listeners out there, what exactly is Zero X KYC?
00:01:05.950 - 00:01:35.500, Speaker B: Yeah, so zero X KyC is a private AML KYC solution. So what we allow protocols to do is to verify their users that they are not OFX sanctioned, that they are over 18, and that their web3 wallet is not on any known fraud wallet lists. And we do this by putting this on a soul bound token and minting a zero knowledge proof onto that soul bound token, signaling that that user is okay to interact with.
00:01:36.590 - 00:01:54.574, Speaker A: Now, for a user, why is this type of technology so important? Because I want to figure out why is it so important from a business standpoint and then also for just a user that's in retail?
00:01:54.702 - 00:02:33.358, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. So at the moment, regulations in web3 are not there per se. But for example, let's say you're a Dow and you have payouts. At the moment, you are still compliant with AML rules and you are running the legal risk of paying out sanctioned individuals. So we provide a solution for those Daos. Let's say it be a work dao where you close tickets and after the ticket is closed, you then get a payout. Before payout, that dow needs to know that they are not paying out a sanctioned individual and that they actually can pay you out.
00:02:33.358 - 00:02:42.080, Speaker B: So through our service, we do the verification, we mint the soul bound. If that user has a soul bound, you can pay them out.
00:02:42.470 - 00:02:51.506, Speaker A: So what are the implications of interacting with somebody that is sanctioned? Yeah.
00:02:51.528 - 00:03:12.410, Speaker B: So you run the legal risk of literally going to jail. So if you're interacting with sanctioned individuals, with terrorists, money launderers, et cetera, et cetera, if your DAO is registered in the EU, UK, us, et cetera, you are running the legal risk of actually going to jail.
00:03:13.310 - 00:03:27.360, Speaker A: Now, personally, I've never set up a Dow before, so maybe you can shed some light on this. But if a DAO is fully decentralized, there's not one specific individual that you can go after. Right.
00:03:31.090 - 00:03:44.866, Speaker B: At the end of the day, there are implications and ways to track back the Dow and the users that would have set up that Dow would be liable for the actions of that dow at the end of the day.
00:03:45.048 - 00:03:56.546, Speaker A: So are there currently, like, have there been cases like that where individuals within a Dow have been held responsible from a legal standpoint? Just curious.
00:03:56.658 - 00:04:34.082, Speaker B: Yeah. So in terms of dows, not necessarily, but probably the most biggest one. And actually what our solution came out of is tornado cash. So tornado cash is a massive, massive event in blockchain space. That was actually very relevant topic at the time of our inception, actually. So we came out of a hackathon where tornado cash was like a massive, massive topic, and it stemmed out of the idea of how could we have avoided a tragedy like tornado cash. So obviously, Tornado cash wouldn't have existed if they did.
00:04:34.082 - 00:04:55.340, Speaker B: Normal KYc, but also not doing any KYc led to tornado cash. But this middle ground solution where you can have the users be KYC'd and know that you are able to interact with them on a protocol level, but then still maintaining the actual privacy of the user, this is this middle ground that would have totally prevented a catastrophe like that.
00:04:55.870 - 00:05:11.102, Speaker A: And so I know that zero knowledge technology is essentially providing that middle ground. So can you explain what exactly is ZK? Why is it so important? Why is there so much hype in the industry about it?
00:05:11.236 - 00:05:57.898, Speaker B: Yeah. So ZK, on a very simple level, in like one, two sentences, basically allows you to get a yes or no answer whether some sort of underlying input is true without revealing what that data is. So this is very important because it allows privacy protocols like ourselves to exist. But also a lot of the hype in crypto with ZK is because it allows things to scale a lot further. But I'll talk more just on the privacy aspect of it because that's where we're coming from. Yeah. So we basically use ZKs to maintain the privacy of the user and not put any personally identifiable data on the blockchain.
00:05:57.898 - 00:06:09.060, Speaker B: So just with a check mark or a soul bound of ours, you are able to interact with a user based upon a simple check.
00:06:10.710 - 00:06:29.082, Speaker A: What do you think is holding us back as an industry in terms of finding that middle ground? Because on one hand you've got regulation, and then on the other hand you got people that wanting to preserve their privacy. What's holding us back from finding that mutual beneficial? Yeah.
00:06:29.136 - 00:07:41.162, Speaker B: So I like this question because we are kind of of that thesis to find that middle ground. So I don't believe web3 can be scalable. Maintaining the old ways of everything is anonymous, everything is totally, totally decentralized in a real world scenario. This doesn't scale, first of all, but also there's many, many legal issues and things coming up like this. But also the world of web3 where it's fully regulated and we get into central bank digital currency area, it's on the total opposite side of the spectrum where we want to be this middle ground where once regulation comes, we tweak a few things to know what regulation means, essentially, and we are the provider for everybody, basically. So we want to be that protocol where once we know what those regulations are, because we don't really know what they are, but we're still building something from the start that is useful. When those parameters come into play, we'll tweak our solution and we are ready to go, essentially.
00:07:41.162 - 00:08:32.970, Speaker B: And also, there's something that I didn't talk about yet, which is the uniqueness verification side of our product. So also, beyond just like the sanctions and AML checks that we do, we also have a side of our product that is just uniqueness verification. So extremely web3 friendly has nothing to do with your web two, identity. So based upon a biometric scan, so I'll call it a selfie, we can know that it's the same user across wallets. So this now helps with problems in web3, like, for example, civil attack resistance. And we know that it's one user, one vote, one user, one airdrop, one user, one giveaway. Because for giveaways, for example, it's just absolutely botted.
00:08:32.970 - 00:08:45.090, Speaker B: So your $5,000 giveaway can have the customer acquisition of ten to 15K, rather than having the customer acquisition of like $200, just because people are professional boughters.
00:08:46.730 - 00:08:53.506, Speaker A: I see. So it sounds like it would clear up a lot of the issues for a lot of the projects, essentially.
00:08:53.618 - 00:09:01.260, Speaker B: Yeah. Everything from Dow governance to giveaways, basically everything in between as well. Yeah.
00:09:02.350 - 00:09:16.686, Speaker A: So tell me about how much legal support are you having to have in order to build this out, because you're in the thick of things when it comes to everything that's happening on the regulatory front.
00:09:16.788 - 00:10:11.534, Speaker B: Yes, absolutely. So actually, we have an amazing investor advisor who is on our cap table, who is a regulator in the UK, so he has extreme knowledge on the space. We have amazing lawyers who are working on our terms and service and privacy policy at the moment. And yeah, we've had meetings with people who have lobbied the US government in terms of regulation, and we know for a fact that DeFi regulation is coming. It's just a matter of timing. Mean, it's definitely a big regulatory and legal. There's this overarching legal and regulatory aspect of it, but on our end, we've tried to do everything.
00:10:11.534 - 00:10:26.180, Speaker B: For example, in terms of data risk, our data risk is extremely low just because of how we set up our infrastructure. We store no Pii on chain, et cetera, et cetera. So we've definitely made the steps to be secure on that front.
00:10:26.630 - 00:10:43.898, Speaker A: Being that you guys are so in tune with what's happening on the regulatory front, what do you anticipate? Obviously, nobody knows what will happen, right? It's all guesses from here, but what you've seen transpire, what do you think will happen here within the next year or so?
00:10:44.064 - 00:11:24.710, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely think regulation is needed. First of all, just to avoid all these web3 catastrophes, from FTX to tornado, cash, everything in between. Right. There definitely needs to be some sort of regulatory action for things to legitimize how we all want them to. Right. And in that, I don't think it's as dystopian as people think, or it isn't as bad to expect. Total anonymity is almost like a dream in today's world.
00:11:24.710 - 00:11:56.050, Speaker B: Even the most secure tor browsers and all this stuff, they've all come to play in terms of the removal of those principles. And it's just a matter and a natural state of going forward, in my opinion. I think the space will move forward, regulation will go forward, things will move on as usual. New beautiful things will come out of it, and, yeah, we just need to keep ourselves secure at the end of the day and we keep it pushing.
00:11:57.190 - 00:12:18.826, Speaker A: Do you think that there will be a certain group of individuals that may push back on the regulations and of course even more decentralized and privacy preserving protocols? And if so, is it always going to be this cat and mouse chase, so to speak?
00:12:19.008 - 00:12:54.414, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there will always be purists. I think it's great to be honest. In a perfect world, it works in theory, everything, it makes sense. And I do believe that there is definitely going going to. To be pushback, but that's what the real world is based on. If you don't push back, then the regulations go full fledged to the point you don't want them to be. So we need to kind of find this middle ground where it makes sense in terms of legitimizing the industry, but it doesn't ruin the merits that helped build the entire infrastructure.
00:12:54.414 - 00:13:07.960, Speaker B: Right. So this is exactly where we want to position ourselves as Xerox KYC. We want to be that middle ground layer that preserves privacy while still complying with regulations. Eventually, yeah.
00:13:08.590 - 00:13:28.574, Speaker A: Different countries vary in terms of their appetite for risk. In terms of regulations, where do you see the countries that are the most privacy preserving versus the other way around? Where do you see zero x KYC thriving the most?
00:13:28.692 - 00:14:21.978, Speaker B: That's an interesting question. So even with the setup of our system from, I don't want to go too much into it, but even in how we were setting up our zero XKYC KYC flow, we've had to disclude some documents, like, for example, nigerian IDs. They don't have the security features that we need in place to not be vulnerable to attacks, for example, because these things are extremely easy to replicate, fake, et cetera, et cetera. Like you're saying, different countries have different risks. So even in just the IDs, there's already a difference. So we've had to only accept IDs with strong security features. There's countries that are super accepting to crypto.
00:14:21.978 - 00:14:32.980, Speaker B: Some countries are a little bit more hesitant. We're a company. All our servers are in the US, et cetera, et cetera. And we work from us and we branch out.
00:14:34.390 - 00:14:55.180, Speaker A: There's a lot of talk about a lot of US companies leaving the United States because of the regulatory landscape at the moment. What are your thoughts on this? Are we going to see more and more businesses leave the United States? And what's zero X KyC stance on?
00:14:56.110 - 00:15:09.790, Speaker B: I mean, I guess we'll see how things go. I know people are leaving, but we'll see where the better option becomes long term.
00:15:11.090 - 00:15:39.754, Speaker A: Yeah, it's still very early, and hopefully there's enough time for United States to provide some more clarity on that front. So let's just say I'm a dao and I am interested in using your services. Can you walk me through what a typical journey is like? Where do people start? Yes, please. That process.
00:15:39.952 - 00:16:03.674, Speaker B: Yeah. So perfect. So I like this question. I'm on the tech side, so we've built the solution to be extremely easy to integrate. The process to integrate with us is literally just, let's say you're about to pay out a dow. It's as simple as token gating that payout. So you token gate that payout, you redirect the user.
00:16:03.674 - 00:16:48.910, Speaker B: So at the moment, it's a redirect to our app. The app then goes through our flow. So you scan your ID, you get the ZK, the soul bound at the end of it, and then you're redirected back to the app that you came from. We're working on an SDK, so we'll actually be modular in our SDK, so it's even easier to integrate. But at the moment, it's as simple as a token gate. You token Gate a payout, you token Gate a proposal, you token gate anything that you can think of in terms of actions, you just token gate it. And once the user has our soul bound, you can verify the soul bound on chain with our verifier contract, and then that user is then active.
00:16:50.450 - 00:16:56.500, Speaker A: Got it? And how many users? Well, I should say, how many businesses are you currently working?
00:16:59.830 - 00:17:23.690, Speaker B: So our first integration is going to be with Aragon, Dow. So we're building a plugin at the moment. So basically a modular plugin. So either the uniqueness or the sanctions, check the sanction. AmL check, it'll be a plugin directly in Aragon. But we're launching next week. So we're officially launching, launching next week.
00:17:23.690 - 00:18:20.410, Speaker B: At the moment we're behind a username and password. So basically family and friends, kind of like beta launch, but we're launching to the public on Testnet next week, on Thursday. And yeah, we will still have many launches as we go on until we eventually get to mainnet. But we have partners from workdows to Dow governance to even web3 risk scoring protocols where we provide a data point to actually lower a user's risk. Because at the moment, a lot of the data points can only increase risk of a wallet. But if you see a zero X Kyc on that user's wallet, you know that they are okay to interact with on the web two side, which actually dramatically decreases that user's risk.
00:18:21.170 - 00:18:28.382, Speaker A: So you mentioned that you're going to have a lot of different launches coming up. So what does your roadmap look like?
00:18:28.516 - 00:19:08.346, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so I talked about the uniqueness verification. So we're building that to be launched next month. Officially we have it out of the box, but we're just like tweaking things after that. We really want to comply with some of the account abstraction standards that have come out. So like picture this, you take a biometric face scan like that you would for our uniqueness verification that would generate a wallet for you. You have an account abstracted wallet at the end of that.
00:19:08.346 - 00:19:51.450, Speaker B: So we really want to kind of make the entire user journey very seamless. We also have an idea to integrate governmental SDKs so, for example, passports and IDs in the EU already have this, where you can literally scan via NFC chip and get perfect data. This is perfect governmental data and unhackable, et cetera, et cetera. We want to integrate an NFC technology. The reason why we're not using that as a start, it's very new. People aren't used to doing these kind of scans, et cetera, et cetera. People are more used to just taking a photo of their passport or ID.
00:19:51.450 - 00:20:09.550, Speaker B: But this technology allows for things like signing of digital documents, et cetera, et cetera. It gives us a huge push in that direction. But the main things we're working on are uniqueness, verification, and then the account abstraction. Those are two that are actively being developed on at the moment.
00:20:09.620 - 00:20:15.502, Speaker A: Yeah, amazing. So where can people follow along on your journey?
00:20:15.646 - 00:20:46.730, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So you can follow us on our socials. So we're most active on LinkedIn or on Twitter. We also have a newsletter directly on our zero XKYC ID landing page, so you can just enter your email. Keep up to date with our journey before it gets posted. We keep our family, friends, investors up to date more than we do when we push it out to socials.
00:20:48.110 - 00:21:33.370, Speaker A: That's great. And thanks again for taking the time to talk today, because I think that what you're doing, you and your team, is extremely important for the industry as it helps us to find that middle ground. I think most people agree that some regulation is needed by how much everyone has a different opinion. Finding that middle ground is certainly key and I think the better job you guys do from a technology standpoint, user UX standpoint, I think that will only help increase the overall adoption of the industry. So you guys are doing really important work. Thank you for all that work and any parting thoughts for the listeners.
00:21:34.990 - 00:22:03.520, Speaker B: I just really appreciate also to be on this podcast and share what we're building. I'm glad you see the vision. And yeah, just to everybody listening, let's just keep building. It's been a bear market for a while. It seems like it's pushing a little bit better at the moment. Who knows how that goes in the end? We just need to keep building things that legitimize this space and yeah, let's just keep building.
00:22:04.450 - 00:22:07.058, Speaker A: Keep voting indeed. Thanks a lot, Dylan.
00:22:07.154 - 00:22:07.540, Speaker B: Thank you.
