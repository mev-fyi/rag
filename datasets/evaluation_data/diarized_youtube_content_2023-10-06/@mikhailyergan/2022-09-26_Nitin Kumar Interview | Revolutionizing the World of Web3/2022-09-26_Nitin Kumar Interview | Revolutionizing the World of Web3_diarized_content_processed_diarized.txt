00:00:00.490 - 00:00:33.974, Speaker A: Welcome back to network Spotlight. I am your host Mikhail. On today's show I have natine Kumar of Z blocks. Natine is on a mission to help web two companies transition into web3. We talk about his background, the importance of looking at historical patterns and what the future holds for the crypto industry. Smash up the like, subscribe to the channel and enjoy the show. Hey Natina, how are you?
00:00:34.092 - 00:00:37.570, Speaker B: Eric, how good to see you. How's life treating you?
00:00:37.660 - 00:00:46.300, Speaker A: Oh goodness, it's fast paced, just like crypto. It's been great. How was everything on your end?
00:00:46.670 - 00:00:48.890, Speaker B: All good, same thing, fast paced.
00:00:49.310 - 00:00:54.700, Speaker A: Yeah, wonderful. Have you been doing any traveling lately? Conferences, anything like?
00:00:55.010 - 00:00:58.880, Speaker B: Just got back from the west coast. There's a whole bunch of conferences in New York next week.
00:00:59.490 - 00:01:01.018, Speaker A: You're going to be at Missari?
00:01:01.114 - 00:01:02.174, Speaker B: Yeah, are you coming?
00:01:02.292 - 00:01:02.960, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:03.410 - 00:01:04.974, Speaker B: Okay, let's catch up there.
00:01:05.092 - 00:01:22.920, Speaker A: Absolutely, let's meet for sure. I appreciate you taking some time to chat today, Natine. I know you're a really busy guy, and just looking at your background, it's pretty extensive, so can you give a quick introduction about what you do?
00:01:24.490 - 00:02:09.560, Speaker B: So I've been in business for about a quarter century. I'm an enterprise software guy, bread and baked early crypto guy as well. I've been in bitcoin since 2013 and then subsequently into other all coins have run very large PNLs, billions of dollars, managed tens and thousands of people, then came into the small world with startups, have had a couple of exits. Now in a very interesting web3 journey, which is called Z blocks, we build on something called z Byte and we call ourselves the easy button that is clicked for enterprises to come from web two to web3 on a low code, no code platform. That's about me in a nutshell. And then we can get into more details about anything that you need to know.
00:02:09.930 - 00:02:17.400, Speaker A: Yeah, and I saw your educational background is pretty extensive as well. I think you went to Harvard Business school, is that correct?
00:02:17.770 - 00:02:32.350, Speaker B: So I've been to a number of schools in my career. I've done a number of certifications, including courses at Harvard and NCIAd, and I'm an engineer by training and have played in a lot of new cutting edge technologies.
00:02:33.010 - 00:02:47.150, Speaker A: So let's take a step back because I want to learn how you got into the entire business mindset as a kid. Were you always an entrepreneur? Is this something that you've always enjoyed? How did you get into entrepreneurship?
00:02:47.310 - 00:03:16.182, Speaker B: So I've always built something right in my career and change is the only constant in my life. And I grew up changing many schools in many places. Being a military kid, so that kind of got into my operating model as I was growing up. So when you peek at something, I cut my teeth. My first part of my career was in cybersecurity. Once I peaked there, I kind of moved into more management consulting, strategy and M a. Once you peaked there, I moved more into the startup world and entrepreneurship.
00:03:16.182 - 00:03:41.940, Speaker B: So I love learning new things. Also, I have an important skill which is required for today, which is called unlearning. Right. And when you talk about entrepreneurship, I built a cybersecurity practice inside Hewlett Packard. Then I did the same thing in Deloitte. I built businesses inside FTI, and then I built and sold a couple of companies. So have the building mindset and kind of creating something.
00:03:43.030 - 00:03:54.342, Speaker A: And me coming from a cybersecurity background as well. Obviously, I'm in the web3 world, but at the time, I imagine it was still Web two. Web one, it was web one.
00:03:54.396 - 00:04:18.062, Speaker B: There was no CISO. It was to be the guy who took care of security. There was a fair amount of education that was required. Why? Cybersecurity is a thing, right? So I draw the parallel. Then you go into the cloud world. It was like, oh, what is this thing? Why is this even a thing? Why would I move from on Prem? And I see very similar market structure patterns to even Web three. Why is blockchain? Why should enterprise get into it? Why is web3.
00:04:18.062 - 00:04:32.130, Speaker B: So, we've seen that playbook in different industries and different eras, and as much as businesses have changed significantly, the behaviors to new technologies and all that remain fairly similar in terms of patterns.
00:04:33.110 - 00:04:46.200, Speaker A: That's a very good point you bring up, and I imagine this is a big reason why you decided to invest heavily into different courses around web3. Can you share a little bit about your experience there?
00:04:46.890 - 00:05:15.546, Speaker B: So, look, I was fascinated by what is going on in web3. And at that time, web3 didn't even have a terminology called web3. There used to be raw protocols. There used to be different dimensions of protocols. They used to be people who are building just for the sake of building a problem I'm trying to solve. So when the killer use cases really came, I saw two things distinctly. Well, one is the disruptive potential of NFT, and the second was Defi.
00:05:15.546 - 00:05:52.438, Speaker B: At that time, it was very clear to me that fintech is still built on the old guardrails, whereas Defi was new and NFT was a killer use case. We also invested heavily in taking NFT into the enterprise, and I wanted to get multi dimensional across all these and see why is x different from Y? Why is a certain project this way went into tokenomics. So over many years I sharpened my skill set and also gave myself the ability to read some patterns on what's coming, what can sustain, what cannot sustain. And I think web3 is starting to come of age. It's still early, but it's starting to come of age now.
00:05:52.624 - 00:06:34.458, Speaker A: I think most people see the use cases when it comes to deFi, especially when you look at some of the gaps that some of the banks have. When you look at DeFi and the entire landscape, it's pretty established. A lot of people understand the use cases, the advantages of DFI over legacy banking systems. But when you look at NFTs, maybe because it's still fairly new, most people in the mainstream world don't really understand it yet. They see it as 10,000 unique JPegs. Right? And why would I want to invest my money in that? What would you say from a use case perspective? Where is it heading? Where's the.
00:06:34.624 - 00:07:11.202, Speaker B: Absolutely, absolutely. So I think we live this narrative every day that it's a speculative gif. Same with cryptos and protocols, right? It's a matter of education. Now, if you look at NFT, it's nothing new. Mikhail, your fingerprint is nature's NFT, right? There's only one of it and there's only one of you. So the digital identity stuff is real and you can make a lot of use cases just related to the identity, but I'll spare you that for a second. Right, let's go into the enterprise today, and if you look at NFDs, they play a number of different applications and unique aspects.
00:07:11.202 - 00:07:55.314, Speaker B: One of the things that Zblox is doing is that we are taking NFDs into campaign management in the chief marketing officer organization. So think about today what happens. A campaign is run with email IDs and then you have intermediaries like the big platforms of web two, and those algorithms kind of reach you. But the brand, for the brand, it's very opaque. How they reached you, what did you do? Do you actually share or not? And these are very expensive campaigns because the intermediaries kind of control the market structure and they take a lot of toll. Now imagine that there's a pick your favorite airline or hotel or something, there's a campaign coming in and there's an NFT. If you click it and claim it seamlessly under the hood with the zblux mechanism, there is a wallet open.
00:07:55.314 - 00:08:21.306, Speaker B: The brand now has a direct relationship with them. You tell them you like sushi or you'd like to go to this concert or that magician. They can give you offers, they can ask you, hey, can you fill this form? Can you tell me something about it? And they can actually compensate you there. It's a game changer. So the CRM now gets into what you call as an orm owner, relationship management. That's the wallet owner. Okay, so that's one use case that we're looking at.
00:08:21.306 - 00:08:47.346, Speaker B: And if you look at the news today, you have Starbucks and Adidas and Nike and all these guys trying to look at Orm in various ways. But the brand has a direct relationship with the consumer, not via the big web, two intermediaries. So that's a paradigm shift. The second part also, again, gets into retargeting. Let's say you have a cell phone, right? A big telco company sells your phone. I know who exactly you are. I have a contract with.
00:08:47.346 - 00:09:17.546, Speaker B: You're a customer, but you sell it to somebody else in the secondary market, all the data is gone. Right? So if the phone has an NFT, who owned it, what date was it refurbished, what was the warranty, information, et cetera, et cetera. When your customer relationship ends, the NFT gets transferred to the new owner. I still have data. I can retarget the owners and incentivize them to buy the warranty. So there is a lot of that stuff that's happening. Industrial IoT or large hardware equipment.
00:09:17.546 - 00:09:39.160, Speaker B: You can have NFDs on condition monitoring on the health of the equipment when it was serviced, what technicians. All the data kind of resides on the blockchain and is immutable. So NFDs have got a lot of use cases like that. And these are things that are more relatable to people. And enterprises are starting to adopt these in many different ways.
00:09:41.530 - 00:09:52.570, Speaker A: In regards to zblocks, you're essentially providing these abilities to the enterprises that are wanting to practice these types of activities. Right. In terms of engagement.
00:09:53.550 - 00:10:21.410, Speaker B: Correct. So zblocks is built on the world's first decentralized platform. That's called z byte. We have the dplat pro. The Dplat Pro has a number of integrations into the enterprise systems like CRMs, active directory authentication and whatnot. We got about a 40 to 50 connector area right now, which is improving every day. We also have a mechanism by which enterprises do not have to pay L1 fees in crypto.
00:10:21.410 - 00:11:01.518, Speaker B: Enterprises are reluctant to have crypto on their balance sheet today. So we have a fiat enabled feature that can deliver value there. Our platform is kind of agnostic. It's low code, no code. You don't need to understand rust, haskell solidity, or hire very extremely complex technical resources to do that. It's low code, no code, and I think those kind of things make it very simple in terms of dragging and dropping and building multiple use cases on the dplat. Our Orm use case or the campaign management is the beachhead that we are building to get the enterprises seated in.
00:11:01.518 - 00:11:23.318, Speaker B: But people are going to build a number of different things on their own. They're going to build rights and royalty management, they can build consortiums, they can build carbon tracking supply chain. The DPlAt is the one, DPlat Pro is the one that goes into the enterprise and they can get drag and drop and build many, many use cases or Dapps on it.
00:11:23.484 - 00:11:38.902, Speaker A: So essentially it's a platform where, let's say I'm your client, I'm a business where I can drag and drop specific tools in order to create a final product that is catering to my clientele. Essentially.
00:11:39.046 - 00:12:22.220, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It can be an internal function, it can be revenue enablers and campaign management, it can be automation of simple processes through smart contracts. It can be consortiums that link many different entities that require transparency and immutability. It's a number of different things that drive the enterprise to adopt this at a fundamental level. Or even enterprises don't want to miss out the web3 journey if you take the large part of a fortune thousand sample size, many were late adopters into ecommerce. There was some velocity that came in and people embarked on the cloud. Even the adoption of mobile was even faster than that.
00:12:22.220 - 00:12:36.480, Speaker B: I think Web three will not take 25 years to get into the enterprise. It'll be sooner, but it still requires a lot of education, patience, perseverance and educating people on why web3 is important for them.
00:12:36.930 - 00:12:48.546, Speaker A: So essentially you're taking these web two companies that are curious about web3 and you are shortening the learning curve, so to speak, making it easier for.
00:12:48.568 - 00:13:32.846, Speaker B: Them to convert, to shorten the learning curve, remove the regulatory burden, reduce the technical complexity and provide resources and education. As I said, we call ourselves the easy button to click to come from web two use cases to web3. We also don't believe that Web three will rip and replace web two overnight. I think there are many use cases that are very suitable to come into web3, and enterprises should take advantage of that. There are a number of use cases that are not ready for web3. You don't need a decentralized zoom and a decentralized slack and a decentralized teams or things like that. So use web3 where it makes sense largely when you have a significant asset base that is unmonetized and you can use the power of the community.
00:13:32.846 - 00:14:01.260, Speaker B: Those use cases are no brainers. Right. You could actually monetize dead assets or latent assets on your balance sheet that is inside. Use the power of the community and kind of monetize it in a very different way in a new, different business model, and it opens up new revenue streams for enterprises and they're not educated enough to take advantage of that. But I think the journey has already started. Web three is real. You yourself have been around in this, and there's a lot of change, even in the last three, four years.
00:14:01.710 - 00:14:17.200, Speaker A: Absolutely. You touched on regulation. I'm very curious to know, as you are catering to these clients, where do you see regulation play in all of this? Because every country has different perspectives on that.
00:14:17.570 - 00:14:48.790, Speaker B: Look, yeah, I mean, I'm more operative in the US and european markets, so I can give you a better perspective. There is a lot of regulatory ambiguity here, and I'm hoping that the regulatory bodies are going to work and give us some clarity. There are tokens that are just published for speculative value. There are tokens that are not adequately decentralized. There are tokens that need to exist. And these, I think, will come under a lot of regulatory scrutiny, and rightly so. If you have a true utility of a token, it is achieving something.
00:14:48.790 - 00:15:44.034, Speaker B: It's a sovereign currency off the platform or an ecosystem. I think people are still understanding what that is. Now, the main thing is that there is also nuances like people like yourselves help with in terms of the security and the code and whatnot, whether there are rug pools possible, whether it's centralized enough. Also, like our CTO adequately says, appropriately says, right, this is the first time legal counsel is part of our architecture team on where the wallet is, where the tokens are, who holds it, who doesn't. So there needs to be a fair amount of detailing and transparency in this that can explain to the enterprises and the regulators on what is possible, what is not. There is still some ambiguity that we will have to continue to walk through and educate people. But trying to take a token force, fit a utility on it, those kind of things will not go well in the future.
00:15:44.034 - 00:15:56.862, Speaker B: In the past, you may have gotten by it. In the future, it's going to be more difficult to justify. So you need to have a real project with a real use case, solving a real problem, requiring a real token, with a real utility, do you see that?
00:15:56.996 - 00:16:04.690, Speaker A: Because regulations are going to constantly evolve. Do you see your company evolving along with the regulations?
00:16:05.190 - 00:17:01.922, Speaker B: See, to the best extent that there's regulatory clarity. We have done everything to do things right and by the book, including hiring the right legal counsel who are extremely well known in the industry. We're partnering with people like yourselves who will help us kind of get our act together on the auditing side of our code and whatnot. So you need to make the right investments and create the right transparency. And yes, if regulation evolves, we adapt with the regulation. Ultimately, you operate in a regulatory environment, even in your daily life, right? I mean, if you look at the media or telecom or retail, there are all different kinds of regulations there, energy or healthcare, and there are good regulations and bad regulations. I think good regulations are good for crypto and an unregulated market is never going to happen, although many people would desire that.
00:17:01.922 - 00:17:09.574, Speaker B: I think there has to be the right regulation for the right reason. And good regulation will bring in more adoption and more growth. Yeah.
00:17:09.612 - 00:17:51.042, Speaker A: There's certainly some uncertainty right now from a regulatory standpoint, around coins around, at least in the US government, who's going to be managing these cryptos. Is it a security? Is it not? But one thing is for sure is that right now there's a lot of talk about there being an entire global recession, right. And although we are focused on technology and more of the fundamentals and where things are headed from a technology standpoint, but in a short term, there's obviously some market cooling off. Right? Do you have any thoughts in terms of how long this global recession will last if we're in a global recession? Any thoughts on that?
00:17:51.176 - 00:18:05.186, Speaker B: Arguably, we are already in a global recession. Right. All the data, in fact, indicates a slowdown. Inflation is not slowing. So macro is going to be difficult. We're in unusual times. We just came off a pandemic.
00:18:05.186 - 00:18:52.402, Speaker B: There is one or arguably two wars now going on in the world with Armenia and Azerbaijan, and it's an aberration environment. There is obviously the geopolitical factors at play, and there is macro at play. Crypto, bitcoin or other web3, whatever definition you call it, has never been tested through these lows, ever. So this is going to be different. Now, I don't have a crystal ball, but looks like this is going to be some short term pain here from a macro standpoint. And businesses will respond to that in very many different ways, be it headcount reduction or cost reduction or whatnot. At the same time, in the last two recessions, we've seen that investments have gone when they've gone in the right places.
00:18:52.402 - 00:19:13.440, Speaker B: Mega unicorns and highly valuable companies have evolved for the next decade. So the resilient will become more resilient and the not so resilient will have testing times here. So if you're built for value, you're going to last. If you're built to adapt, you're going to last. If you carry the bad habits from the past, it's going to be very stressful in these times.
00:19:14.130 - 00:19:38.438, Speaker A: One thing that I'm noticing within the first 15 minutes of our conversation is that you pay a lot of attention to history. You look at in terms of what we've gone through history, whether or not history will repeat itself. And it sounds like you very much think that history does repeat itself, and a lot of times it may look a little different, but if you zoom out a little bit, it's very similar story.
00:19:38.524 - 00:20:23.790, Speaker B: I actually believe slightly differently. I believe there are patterns in history that needs to be understood for context, just for context on why certain things are a certain way and if there are patterns. But I do not believe that we need to learn anything from history to go repeat it. I think that would be a misguided step for many people. It's like catch the patterns and see what is applicable today. And what history teaches you is context. Even if you look at our careers, right, if you have changed one, two, three jobs, there is actually a 0% probability that what made you successful in one era, in one job, you can replicate in another company, but there are patterns there, right do's and don'ts that you can bring in, which becomes your so called expertise.
00:20:23.790 - 00:20:36.470, Speaker B: And in this era, I think your experience is not that relevant. Your expertise to create something new is relevant. But if there are patterns in the past that don't change, they don't change. You need to sort of see how you can create value from it.
00:20:36.620 - 00:20:49.420, Speaker A: What are some of the historical events that you've studied before to help you in terms of understanding what may happen in the future?
00:20:50.130 - 00:21:50.702, Speaker B: Look, there are pretty obvious structural and functional aspects to it. Now, if you look at technology and macro, those are the two things that we've discussed on this call. All technology adoption has gone through a certain curve and certain ecosystems have to evolve beyond that, right? If you look at a cloud transition, cloud really started to get adopted when you had dev tools, you had communities, you had services, you had all ecosystems woven for the enterprises to make it easy. Okay, web3 is going through a similar cycle because web3 people are building for web3. The day you have ecosystems, connectors, integrations, services and all that come in, adoption becomes easier. And through each era, ecommerce, Internet, cloud, mobile, the cycles have become shorter and that is going to pan out. That's on the technology side, on the macro side, we have a design of certain design at play.
00:21:50.702 - 00:22:31.686, Speaker B: If you look at the US markets, we're very indexed on the petrol, right? And our ability to produce cheaper and lower cost assets have gone right. They've been all outsourced to lower cost countries at the turn of the century or before. So we have a real estate market here, we have equities. That is what brings in money. And the design of our economy is that we trade our appreciating assets to get depreciating assets from other parts of the world. Hence to continue that design, your equity markets and your real estate, et cetera, have to stay attractive and have to have an upside. Otherwise the design gets disrupted.
00:22:31.686 - 00:23:01.590, Speaker B: And this design has been its place since the second world war occurred. So if you piece two and two together, this recession will end and the equilibrium in the global economy has to sustain itself. Right or wrong, whether the macro forces of history are applicable today is very debatable. But that equilibrium, if disrupted, I think will cause serious upheaval. So if you piece that pattern together, I think those recession too will end. Like many other recessions.
00:23:02.170 - 00:23:21.242, Speaker A: You're a man that wears multiple hats. Aside from Zblox, you're also an executive chairman and core founder of Merge Flow, if I pronounced that correctly. There's some other entities that you're part of, a chairman. So can you touch a little bit on what you're doing in other areas because you got your hands on a lot of things?
00:23:21.376 - 00:24:11.840, Speaker B: Yeah. So bulk of my time is spent on zblocks, right? I have very good management teams there. I am the co founder of something called Merge Flow, which is a product like growth product, which is making m a integration easy in a very bottom up motion like box and Dropbox and all that. So if you take a common theme between all of these ventures that I'm involved, it's all about taking the complex and making it simple, right? You don't need a large enterprise salesforce to go and do the mating dance with many different buyers in the enterprise. You do it simply in a bottom up motion with Z blocks. It's fairly straightforward, become the easy button. It's all about removing complexity from very complex concepts and decomposing it, making it easier for people to understand and easier for people to use.
00:24:11.840 - 00:24:27.940, Speaker B: That is my thematic journey from now to the foreseeable future. As I told you, like you, I came from the cyber world and it's a very complex world, so lived my complexity. I understand the patterns there, trying to make things simple for people.
00:24:28.470 - 00:24:42.310, Speaker A: So simplicity is going to be the key for adoption, for mass adoption. So where do you see just crypto in general? Where are you seeing this technology? Where are we headed?
00:24:43.210 - 00:25:00.666, Speaker B: No, I think we will evolve ecosystems, right. Web three and web two have got both maxi views. Right. Web two think crypto is a scam, and web3 thinks all centralized entities. And web two is evil. I think they're both taking a deep breath. That is the era right now.
00:25:00.666 - 00:25:27.240, Speaker B: Previously it was that maxi thing. Web two doesn't want to miss out on the exponential effect of web3. Web three is learning that, oh, web two is not going away. And web3 also has shortcomings like web two. Right? So I think the reconciliatory era and the introspection era is where we're in. When they both come together, you will see exponential effects from this technology with, for example, your valuations will have both ARR and tokens. Today you don't have them.
00:25:27.240 - 00:25:52.720, Speaker B: And that will unleash at the end of this, whatever you want to call it, recession, bear market, tear market. There's many terminologies. I think this is that era when people are going to come together. Web two will learn to accommodate web3 and web3 will start building for web two also. And that will create simplicity and ecosystems and maturity. It's the mutual acceptance era right now.
00:25:53.410 - 00:26:06.740, Speaker A: So in other words, in the future, you see a world where Web two and web3 work together, not necessarily where technology moves completely into a web3 world.
00:26:07.190 - 00:26:43.094, Speaker B: No, this is inevitable. It will coexist in peace. If you look at even the traditional companies like Nike added as et cetera, they've started to harness the power of Web three and they're starting to go into creating exponential returns. And if you google them, there's millions of dollars of revenue and numbers in very short period of time. So it's beneficial for them as well as their ecosystem. They're also being very cognizant that the communities need to be rewarded. They've got 100 years of history, data, money, et cetera.
00:26:43.094 - 00:27:07.846, Speaker B: So it's not a flip of a switch. It will be a dial in the change. If you look at Web three, there are people who are kind of building for the enterprise now. I mean, people like Avalanche have enterprise use cases. There are blockchains like Hedera, which are enterprise focused, and they have kind of worn that hat. There will be d five players, there'll be other players. Can a 3 trillion market accommodate not the 3 trillion now.
00:27:07.846 - 00:27:36.554, Speaker B: It's like 1 trillion ish in the crypto world. Can it accommodate 20,000 cryptocurrency coins? The short answer is no, right? Never. So there is going to be survivors who thrive, and there's going to be people who get washed out. Right. And then you have many layer ones that have no adoption. You have many dfI that have no transactions. Chances of them surviving are very challenging because to operate web3 is not cheap.
00:27:36.554 - 00:28:07.350, Speaker B: You need a lot of money. That generates a lot of awareness, that generates a lot of community, that generates a lot of rewards. It's not an easy thing to have a sustainable web3 ecosystem which is not well funded. And your funding Runway is to build that ecosystem. They build on it. Your protocol accrues the value and that builds the market share. If you arguably look at those, the number of coins have not shrunk, but a market share is one third from a year and a half ago.
00:28:07.350 - 00:28:44.514, Speaker B: It's going to be very challenging for many players to withstand that. So as I said before, real projects, real value, real utility, and your ability to build an ecosystem, the narrative is that the bear market is for building, which is kind of very misguided. Right. I mean, what do you do in a bull market? Speculate you should continuously build bull market or bear market. And I think that is the beauty of the free market. They're brutal and they put everybody in place. If you don't have adoption, the very same projects that could not execute in a bull market have a very little chance to execute in a bear market.
00:28:44.514 - 00:28:55.160, Speaker B: So the verdict on that will play out in this cycle, there will be a lot of people washed out, but those who remain are going to be much stronger and much more resilient than their own past.
00:28:56.570 - 00:29:36.520, Speaker A: Yeah, you bring up something that I think a lot of times gets overlooked when I talk to projects and they want to do a security audit. I mean, security audits are not cheap. And the fact that people are looking and investing in something like that during this bear market really says a lot to their ability to have enough assets to be able to afford something like that. And you could probably take a whole entire course on how to survive during the bear market. But in a brief, short summary, how do you get to a place where you can have enough for the Runway during the bear market?
00:29:38.170 - 00:30:14.202, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think this is again, the more execution and strategy you have in the bull market will create resilience for the bear market. I think there's a lot of people that have raised a lot of money. They will get through a few months, right? Otherwise, I don't know whether they'll get through a few years. The question is that, how much do you need to continuously feed the beast to create an ecosystem? There are projects who've been launched in like 20 17, 20 18, 20 19 that have no ecosystems, right. If you go on a Mazari or something like that, you can see how many users are there. It's very transparent.
00:30:14.202 - 00:30:41.206, Speaker B: And I have run some data. What come back to me is that, interestingly, what has grown is Solana, even Ethereum is flat. Flow has grown incredibly. Everyone else has shrunk in terms of their users, right? So if no users, less value to the protocol and no ecosystem and all that coming in, it's a zero sum game. So you got to raise gargantuan levels of funding to sustain. And now the macro is against you. So previous bear market macro was not against you.
00:30:41.206 - 00:30:50.658, Speaker B: Could still raise funds with that funding drying up and you're not able to build ecosystems. Let's see. It's an unusual environment.
00:30:50.854 - 00:31:12.190, Speaker A: Very unusual. We haven't really seen a recession of this type either. And you mentioned Solana. Interesting to see what will happen. Obviously, they've experienced a few pitfalls. Interesting to see if projects will still have that confidence in them to move forward in development.
00:31:12.350 - 00:31:48.922, Speaker B: There is always two schools of thoughts, right? Particularly on layer ones for cryptos. Is the technology robustness important? Yes. What good does a technology robustness do if nobody is using it, if there is no ecosystem? I think to build that ecosystem is way more challenging. And you heard about Metcalf's law and lindy effect and users, and that's what gives the valuation. Solana is unusual, right? I mean, there are technical limitations, but there's like thousands of dapps built on it. It's got the ecosystem to sustain. Now, this doesn't look like a strategy issue where they don't know how to build an ecosystem.
00:31:48.922 - 00:32:31.258, Speaker B: Obviously they're well funded and all that. This looks like an execution issue to fix the underlying shortcomings of the technology. Execution issues are a lot easier to fix as opposed to the build the market, build a sustainable ecosystem and all that stuff. So if I have to, I'm a betting man and I had to bet on it. I think it's a matter of time where those technical execution issues may get fixed. But if there are technically solid projects which have no traction and nothing is built on them, I think that problem is going to be very challenging to address in a bear market. Market issue.
00:32:31.258 - 00:32:41.230, Speaker B: Right. So if you want to take a bet between market risk and execution risk, I would still take a bet on the execution risk because it's easier to solve.
00:32:42.130 - 00:32:50.850, Speaker A: And Tina, always appreciate the perspective. Man of wise words. Thanks a lot for taking the time to chat. Any parting thoughts?
00:32:51.350 - 00:33:22.090, Speaker B: No, I think parting thoughts for everybody is that take a look at the macro. There are always opportunities that come in here, right? There is a recession, a war, an unusual recession. Signature. And also question yourself on where value can be created in this market. There are plenty of opportunities build for value. Forget the speculation and PR and press releases and chasing that. I think if you build value and you produce something, PR and press releases are an outcome of that.
00:33:22.090 - 00:33:35.650, Speaker B: Right. Your value is not an outcome of PR and press releases and marketing propaganda. So it's something people need to focus on. And if I were to spend dollars in X and Y place, it's very clear where dollars need to be spent.
00:33:36.230 - 00:33:38.580, Speaker A: Absolutely. And where can people find you?
00:33:39.910 - 00:33:58.840, Speaker B: You can follow me on LinkedIn. That's the easiest place. I am on Twitter, but I'm not very active there, so LinkedIn is the easiest place. And if you have any questions or thoughts or suggestions, I'm always open to those. And I will be at the Mizari main net, so please reach out. Would love to meet people.
00:33:59.450 - 00:34:13.102, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And I'll be there as well. Looking forward to having some tea, coffee, and it's going to be a great event. Looking forward to that in New York. And Tina, always a pleasure. Thanks so much for the time and looking forward to seeing you soon.
00:34:13.236 - 00:34:15.246, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you, Mikala, I appreciate it.
00:34:15.348 - 00:34:16.090, Speaker A: Cheers.
00:34:16.250 - 00:34:16.700, Speaker B: Take care.
