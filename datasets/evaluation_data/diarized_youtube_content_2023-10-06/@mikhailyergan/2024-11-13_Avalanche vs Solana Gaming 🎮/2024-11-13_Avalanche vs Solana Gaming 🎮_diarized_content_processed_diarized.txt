00:00:00.320 - 00:00:04.525, Speaker A: Hey you, do you like playing video games? Then you better listen up.
00:00:05.065 - 00:00:13.737, Speaker B: What chains do you think would really are really set up for success when it comes to gaming, either from community perspective or from a technical perspective?
00:00:13.801 - 00:00:34.749, Speaker A: I would say Avalanche is probably my leader in that segment currently. I would say it's closely. It's close with Solana and Immutable X. I would say Avalanche is doing a great job because of the Layer one subnet infrastructure that they've built. It's really easy. We, we saw that with Godzilla. They launched the Guns Network.
00:00:34.749 - 00:00:55.685, Speaker A: It's performing great as intended. Beam another close partner of ours, another gaming subnet that's on Avalanche. So Avalanche, I think, is really doing well in that sense. Solana, Star Atlas and others that are building and Solana has such high throughput and speed. The blockchain is reliable when it's online.
