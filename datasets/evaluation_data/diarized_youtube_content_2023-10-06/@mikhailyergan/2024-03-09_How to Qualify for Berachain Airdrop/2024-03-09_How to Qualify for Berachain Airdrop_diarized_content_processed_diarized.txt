00:00:00.320 - 00:00:30.486, Speaker A: Doing that will make you a lot more eligible for the airdrop and maybe get you some bonus. It just takes maybe 15, 20 minutes and you're doing one step above and beyond like probably the other tens of thousands of people who are farming this airdrop. The fact that you're doing this is probably more valuable for Vera Chain because it may indicate that you're looking at potentially building decentralized app. So they probably should give a a bigger chunk of the airdrop to people who do something like that.
00:00:30.558 - 00:01:05.300, Speaker B: On this channel we go deep. How deep? Berichain deep. Have you heard of this chain? Bar chain is a high performance EVM compatible blockchain built on proof of liquidity consensus. They've been generating a lot of buzz lately and on this episode I'm going to show you how to maximize your chances of qualifying for a bar chain airdrop. If you like me coming to you with these insights, please hit the like button and subscribe to the channel. It'll help support the show and my guests. Now let's listen to crypto rookies talk about how to maximize your chances of a bear chain airdrop.
00:01:05.300 - 00:01:11.152, Speaker B: Why he thinks this is the winning strategy and what's the overall hype around Bear chain?
00:01:11.296 - 00:01:55.390, Speaker A: I wrote a post that you can basically deploy a smart contract a token on the beretchain and then you can create a liquidity pool for the token to be traded. That's all on the testnet so it costs nothing. But the fact that you are able to deploy your contract is very likely to increase significantly your chance of getting a significant airdrop and I think that that's pretty rare that you like people who are not programmer can do that. But third web made it pretty easy to deploy. You follow the step like there's a ready to deploy contract that is already kind of pre made. You select a token contract. 3rd web enable you to deploy more than just token contract, but in this case that's what you would do.
00:01:55.390 - 00:02:27.090, Speaker A: Click deploy. Now you just put the name of the token that you want to create. It could be a test token, it doesn't matter. You put a symbol, a description, you put an image and then you put the recipient wallet will be auto generated and the network will be also auto generated for verachain. And then once you deploy after that the contract has been deployed. But then you have to mint a certain amount of token. I put let's say a billion token, but it could be any number.
00:02:27.090 - 00:03:06.800, Speaker A: Then they will end up showing into your metamask wallet. As long as you're on the Berachain network. And after that you go to the bear chain pool itself and then you can create a liquidity pool and then you select your token. So you have to go look at your transaction. So when you deploy the contract you got a transaction hash. So you can go look up your transaction hash and basically get the contract address of the token you created. And after that you can basically paste the address of the token here.
00:03:06.800 - 00:03:42.100, Speaker A: So then you'll be able to make a pair of tokens and then Berachain, it's mostly ONI that you would use, but you could also make a pair with Bera if you prefer. But you can make a pair with any of those tokens that are available on the network. But the ONNI is the one I pick personally. And then you put it's in your own token that you created with the contract address and then you just inject a portion of the token onto the liquidity pool. And then anybody that is participating on the testnet will be able to transact to sell and swap your token. Basically.
00:03:43.960 - 00:03:53.380, Speaker B: What'S the incentive here for Barachain to get regular users to deploy smart contracts in order to qualify for the Airdrop?
00:03:54.360 - 00:04:20.968, Speaker A: But in this case it's just like Ethereum. The value of Ethereum is the ability of anybody to deploy a smart contract as a decentralized app. This is the same thing you deploy your token in the case of Third Web. The token is very simple. It's just a normal token with nothing fancy. But anybody can create something more fancy. We talked about Bittensor and Corcell.
00:04:20.968 - 00:05:01.770, Speaker A: Core Cell is a decentralized app, like a decentralized smart contract on top of Bittensor. This is the same thing. Any project that is building something on top of Ethereum could could decide to take their smart contract and deploy it on the Beretchain instead. And I think the more you do that and the more users you attract, they have to pay transaction fee in the Berachain token like Bera. So that makes valuable network effect for Berachain to get more exposure to the market by having other people the develop smart contract on top of it. So that's the incentive.
00:05:02.430 - 00:05:04.970, Speaker B: Why is there so much excitement around this chain?
00:05:05.950 - 00:05:59.650, Speaker A: They just raised a lot of money from VCs. So typically that implies that the Airdrop might be of a good size. For me, the chain itself doesn't super attract me to be honest. But I'm active almost every day participating on the Testnet activities to qualify for the Airdrop. I think most of the users that are doing that task to qualify for the airdrops are very unlikely to deploy a smart contract. That's why I think doing that will make you a lot more eligible for the airdrop and maybe get you some bonus. So that's why I think it's a good idea to just this because it just takes maybe 15, 20 minutes and you're doing one step above and beyond probably the other tens of thousands of people who are farming this airdrop.
00:06:00.710 - 00:06:09.530, Speaker B: I see. So if you were to create the optimal plan, it would be to farm Vericain and then also to deploy a smart contract.
00:06:10.470 - 00:06:39.900, Speaker A: Yes. And I think the deploying the smart contract, maybe you just do it once, that's fine. But I think the fact that you're doing this is probably more valuable for Barachain because it may indicate that you're looking at potentially building decentralized app. So they probably should give a bigger chunk of the airdrop to people who do something like that because they want to incentivize more developers to build on top of Barachain because ultimately that's what's going to drive more adoption.
00:06:40.720 - 00:06:50.976, Speaker B: So they haven't specifically said that, hey, if you deploy smart contracts on our chain, you're just thinking in terms of like what would be the likelihood, right?
00:06:51.048 - 00:06:52.080, Speaker A: Yes, exactly.
00:06:52.240 - 00:06:57.020, Speaker B: So if they've raised so much money, you know, what's the actual potential growth here?
00:06:58.040 - 00:07:42.808, Speaker A: You know, like we talked about Menta, we talked about, yes, Celestia, Jito, all of those were to me overvalued. But the price, like for example of Celestia still went up quite a lot since it launched. So it's not a death sentence as long as the VC don't cash out and sell on the market too much. It's not going to kill the project necessarily if they're a long term thinker. So I saw that Beratchain raised $42 million Serie A on a $420 million valuation. So that probably gave them some token warrant. But it's like the reason necessary.
00:07:42.808 - 00:07:59.096, Speaker A: So that was in equity. So that's why I think, I don't know why we're so interested. Again, for me, this chain, I don't see what's so interesting about it, to be honest, but I think that's a lot of money.
00:07:59.168 - 00:07:59.832, Speaker B: Yeah, I hear a lot.
00:07:59.856 - 00:08:08.456, Speaker A: And a lot of the ones that raise that much still do kind of well until they become forgotten a few years later. So short term, I think it should be good.
00:08:08.528 - 00:08:23.120, Speaker B: Thanks for tuning in. Be sure to check out the description of this video as I have included the instructions that crypto rookies went over.
