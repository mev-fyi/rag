00:00:00.090 - 00:00:01.120, Speaker A: How have you been?
00:00:01.810 - 00:00:34.066, Speaker B: Good, man. Good. What's really hard is the last two weeks have been moving country, and that time of not being at the computer and working is really frustrating. I didn't realize how much of a workaholic I was because it was stressful not being able to beaver away and build. But, yeah, apart from that, now I've got my desk. I've got this beautiful standing desk now. Sitting, standing desk.
00:00:34.066 - 00:00:38.226, Speaker B: So I'm ready to roll again and I'm back at my good spot.
00:00:38.418 - 00:01:24.280, Speaker A: There you go. It's always bittersweet, right, when you take time off because on one hand, you kind of need that space and time away, but on the second part of that, you almost have this sense of anxiety of everything that you need to do while you're away, especially if you've got a ton of stuff to get to, which everyone's talking about it being a bear market. And things are kind of quiet and boring on the market side. But I tell you, the industry folks are super busy. Like, I go to conferences, everyone's busy. Everyone's building relationships, collaborating, focused on the tech. What's been keeping you busy right now?
00:01:25.290 - 00:02:35.266, Speaker B: Well, yeah. And just to add to that quickly, the bear markets are really where the crappy projects get weeded out because they, they didn't plan properly or they, you know, they're not, or the scams just aren't there as prevalent and, and really, as an, as a person that's looking as a, as someone that's looking for deals in the space, this is the time when it's boring. This is the time to find those good projects because it allows you to basically not have these massive hype trains that fog reason because we're all human. And when 50 humans are going this project, you tend to be a bit more like, oh, yeah, I've got it. Whereas that shouldn't be how it goes. It should be like, where's the hole in the market? What's needed? What's a problem that needs to be solved? And oh, look, these people are beavering away building something really interesting that's solving a problem that I think will be quite big. Plus, wow, it's probably at a cheap rate right now because the markets are bare.
00:02:35.266 - 00:03:04.934, Speaker B: So now's the time to actually accumulate the bull. Markets are times to watch what you've accumulated rise, hopefully. But really, bear markets are interesting like that. And it's funny with investments, I see it all the time where people are like, crypto, nah, it's over. But then if something's on sale like a pair of jeans. They're like, oh, I've got to buy those jeans. They're on sale, 50% off.
00:03:04.934 - 00:03:15.900, Speaker B: Of course I had to buy it. Whereas with crypto it's like something might be 50% down and they're like, oh, no, it's just down, it's dead. It's a total different mentality, isn't it?
00:03:16.350 - 00:03:31.600, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you feel like for those folks that are in the industry building, does the same stay true for them as it does for investors? Is now a good time, the best time to build?
00:03:33.570 - 00:04:31.810, Speaker B: It's a very hard time to raise capital and that's the only thing for builders. If you can have enough capital to basically just start and build an MVP, then it's a good time if it's something that's not needed. But if you're raising capital either from the crowd or a VC, I find that the bear markets are harder. Of course, if you've already had a good exit somewhere along the line in your career, then you've probably got connections with capital that will make it easier. But if you're a fresh kid from uni that's building something really cool, it will be harder in the bear market to find capital. And it really goes to show, like, a lot of people think that VCs are the smart money, but man, they are just as dumb as a lot of. Not all VCs, but a lot of VCs are just as sort of follow the crowd mentality as retail investors.
00:04:31.810 - 00:05:01.190, Speaker B: As soon as there's a bull market, they're all jumping on everything, not even looking at the pitch deck. He invested. So why I will, it's really interesting because I always grew up thinking VCs are really intelligent, they really fine comb everything and it's not like that at all. And a lot of family officers who are the people that feed money to vcs get bitten by bad VCs.
00:05:01.350 - 00:05:37.880, Speaker A: But yeah, more and more VCs that I talk to, I feel like it's more about the team than it is about the tech. I mean, don't get me wrong, the tech is very important, but a lot of times these VCs are investing in the actual team. The chemistry of the team. I know some folks that, they went to school together, they grew up together, and you know that team chemistry is going to be solid. They did a good job of raising funds in the previous bull market, but I feel like that's half the battle, right?
00:05:38.410 - 00:06:34.620, Speaker B: Yeah. As an investor, if I put my investor hat on, it's definitely a part of the puzzle. The team, but you can't be all team, because then you head towards nepotism, which inevitably happens as well, meaning you just sort of invest in people that you know. And a lot of the time, you don't know the best of the best. Maybe you do, then you're lucky. But it's about really, it's the same when you hire as a builder, when you're hiring other talent to join the team, you have to be able to see very clearly the person, the type of person, the skill set, but also, are they kind? Are they nice, are they good people? And all of this is a dark art, isn't it? Trying to figure out a person that you don't really know, but you need to feel that vibe. And that's where I think this human intuition still comes in a little bit.
00:06:34.620 - 00:06:50.560, Speaker B: But I think the tech also plays a very important role. So it's a balancing act. Like, they've got to be solving an idea, and they've got to have the right team, and it's got to be the right time.
00:06:52.130 - 00:07:20.940, Speaker A: Well, you certainly understand the importance of building relationships. Just recently I was on your show for international Defi Day. That was quite an event that you and your team put on. I mean, that was amazing. You had high caliber professionals in the industry coming on, and everybody was sharing about their project. How has that event translated to meaningful relationships for you?
00:07:22.510 - 00:07:48.914, Speaker B: Well, there's these little subtle things of respect as well. If you invite someone on and they're nice to you or they come on time, like little things like that, but also just the fact that people would come on and share what they're doing. And I think this is. Sorry, I've got a new puppy here. Grabbing bits of. Know.
00:07:48.952 - 00:07:59.042, Speaker A: The last episode I did with Kobe, he had his cat, which attacked his desk. So, listen, bring on the animals.
00:07:59.106 - 00:08:07.710, Speaker B: All of them. Yeah. Well, this one here is a fresh little Dobie.
00:08:07.810 - 00:08:10.602, Speaker A: Yeah, it looks like a troublemaker. Cute dog.
00:08:10.656 - 00:09:01.820, Speaker B: Yeah. What were we saying? Yeah. How did it change? Well, I started a startup called Voltoro, which was the very first bitcoin exchange to deal with physical gold and bitcoin and I launched it in 2015 and built it in 2014. And we got into the Techstars accelerator program, which is this large north american accelerator. And one of the big things that they taught us there was give first. The mentality of give first and meaning like you're doing. You're inviting other people in to talk about their projects, and through that, relationships start to build.
00:09:01.820 - 00:09:57.254, Speaker B: And I think it's a really great mentality to have for any builder to go out there and help others first. And that's how you gain that network. I think International Defi Day was really about for me, seeing blockfi, seeing Celsius, seeing these centralized authorities. And FTX, of course, basically stealing billions of money through either ineptness or badly run companies or straight out scams that we need to head more towards. DeFi, the true regulator and FTX, for instance, FTX was highly regulated. It wasn't like it was operating in a totally unregulated market. It was highly regulated.
00:09:57.254 - 00:10:50.554, Speaker B: And so if a scammer wants to scam, they just go around the regulations. They say yes to the regulator, they show the regulator what they want to see. You can't do that with DeFi. With true DeFi, you write the regulations in math, and the math sits there and it's readable by people like yourself and companies like Certec, who will then translate it to readable English for the consumer and say, this is what the regulations say in this smart contract, take it or leave it. And that's why I really wanted to take that moment to celebrate Defi and to all my bitcoin Maxi friends who go on about like, oh, it's scam coins. Everything on Ethereum is a scam. Ethereum allowed for the first time to have a true decentralized exchange.
00:10:50.554 - 00:11:23.814, Speaker B: What uniswap had built to rethink the order book and develop these liquidity pools, it was absolutely extraordinary. And it was really the birthing of getting away from centralized authorities. And this was the whole point of bitcoin in the first place. And bitcoin serves great purposes. And it was my first love. So it's always up there. But we shouldn't look at other technologies and put it down because there are scams in there.
00:11:23.814 - 00:12:05.410, Speaker B: I mean, gold's been around for 5000 years. There's an infinite amount of scams running on the gold stack, so to speak. And so, yeah, like International Defi Day was really all about celebrating getting things back to smart contracts rather than. Obviously, maybe there's regulation. Human regulations might play a part of the puzzle here as well. But the main thing that I see stopping scams is education. Teaching people the things like what you're doing here is teaching people what to look out for, how to spot things that might not be kosher.
00:12:05.410 - 00:12:20.250, Speaker B: And then secondly, the math, having actual regulation hard coded, two plus two is always four. It's never five. And that's why it's just so powerful.
00:12:21.470 - 00:12:47.940, Speaker A: I want to challenge you on something for a moment. So when it comes to DeFi, obviously a lot of this is ran on smart contracts and on the security side, every once in a while you find that there are certain privileges that are not renounced, so there are certain centralized components. Do you still consider that to be defi? I mean, how do you view that?
00:12:49.430 - 00:13:35.474, Speaker B: Absolutely. It's something that I've struggled with a lot, especially running a centralized exchange for so long. How did we never get hacked at that centralized exchange? How did we launch in 2015, still going today, and never had a hack yet. Every day they're trying all around the world, these hackers, and basically it was secrecy. Nothing is told, everything is a small team, and that's one profile you can use. The other profile is fully open source and letting thousands of people try to penetrate, which is, I think, a more advanced level. But to go from the mentality of a centralized exchange to a full open dow is really hard.
00:13:35.474 - 00:14:26.846, Speaker B: So first of all, switching that mentality, second of all, absolutely, but decentralized, what you said is absolutely true. There's hardly any dows that I could say are truly decentralized, but it is a scale. So if there is, some would say that bitcoin is more decentralized than Ethereum. But it's kind of like, how can you quantify that? Well, you can look at miners and see how centralized these pools are and how many pools there are. Well, with bitcoin, there's not that many pools. There's like eight pools and four of them control the vast majority. With Ethereum, it's now through the proof of stake, it's more exchanges that are the pools.
00:14:26.846 - 00:16:02.902, Speaker B: So that's fairly centralized with dows. On the dow front, you have the treasury, which is the centralizing component apart from upgradability and things like that, where you can push an upgrade to a contract, but usually even an upgrade to a contract, usually best practices would be that the user has to then switch to the new contract because you can't change the old one that easily. I mean, maybe you could, you'd be better off knowing about that. But I feel like, for instance, our smart vaults on the standard, if people lock up funds into those smart vaults and borrow against them, if we upgrade to a new smart vault with new functionality, people need to actually sign a transaction to move that debt over to the new vault contract. So there's a bit of, we as a group of developers can't just push something onto everybody instantly. Well, I hope that should be the case for most contracts, but also Treasury, I think, is a big one. How do you as the team step away and allow the down? There's great steps forward, like with OSnap, a lot easier to control multi sig safes with the vote of the crowd, so people can start to put proposals forward, have a vote, and then the vote, if it triggers yes, will trigger the multisig so that the founders can start to move away and start to autonomize.
00:16:02.902 - 00:16:14.770, Speaker B: Because the whole autonomous organization part for true decentralization needs to be autonomous, and I don't see that many that have gone the full autonomy route.
00:16:15.450 - 00:16:43.920, Speaker A: It's certainly difficult to add. With that in mind, do you think that there is a place for centralized applications where maybe perhaps they're a little bit more user friendly and for that reason they act as a gateway into crypto? Or do you believe that we can reach a place where we can have full decentralization without compromising the user experience?
00:16:46.370 - 00:17:28.890, Speaker B: I think we can, but it's a long way off. We're a very long way off. And the biggest issue is that it just takes one project to get big and then make a bad decision. For instance, USDC big project. Let's leave the fact that it's centralized Sablecoin out. But they launched on Arbitrum rather than taking time to write a contract where bridged arbitrum becomes fungible with natively minted. Sorry, bridged USDC becomes fungible with natively minted USDC.
00:17:28.890 - 00:18:27.326, Speaker B: It's now this. Like on Arbitrum, you've got USDC E, which is bridged arbitrum from Ethereum, and then you've got USDC, which is natively minted as the ticker symbol. And that sort of stuff is just so confusing to people. And without solving some of these core wild west style decision making that's out there, I think we're going to find it hard to get grandma friendliness into the truly decentralized space. And there is always going to be a spot for the coinbases of the world because they focus on absolute ease of use. And this goes to the dichotomy of security versus speed and ease. Right? And anyone that's tried to secure their own keys knows that.
00:18:27.326 - 00:19:31.534, Speaker B: Well, if you're building an offline wallet with an air gap and all of the good stuff there, where you're generating the seed really with as much entropy as possible, if you screw that up a then you've lost your tokens. If you make it too complex and give it a year and your fallible human brain forgets how you to restructure what you've set up because you've made it too good, then you lose your coins. Whereas the ease of use on a centralized thing where you allow somebody else to deal with all those hassles, is, I think, always going to be there, unfortunately. So while we can strive towards decentralization, which is the absolute goal for myself personally, and I know for a lot of other projects, I'm not going to be deluded and say Coinbase should go away. Like, it's terrible. It's not. It serves a purpose.
00:19:31.534 - 00:19:47.510, Speaker B: It helps people that aren't technically ready or aren't emotionally ready enough to deal with those butterflies in the stomach every time they click the send button. Did I do it right? Yeah, I did it right. Okay. I can see on the chain.
00:19:48.810 - 00:20:11.520, Speaker A: Yeah. Speaking about decentralization, when I was at permissionless, there's a gentleman, we got to talking, and turns out he works for the IRS. And then he asked me a very interesting question. He said, why do people here care so much about decentralization? So I'd like to ask you that question.
00:20:13.590 - 00:21:14.980, Speaker B: Well, if you look through history at the banking sector, it. It has gone. Humans have a really great knack of finding ways of feathering their own nests over other people. And then banking families and private families have really found a way to make things that don't make too much economical sense legal, like fractional reserve systems, and then get very comfortable in the corridors of power to moat themselves through regulations. So you can have bad. When I say corrupt, I don't mean corrupt people. I mean just a corrupt system where the system just long term, like you could say musical chairs, is a corrupt game.
00:21:14.980 - 00:22:18.022, Speaker B: In the same manner, like, there's not enough chairs for everybody, so the system just breaks. Someone fails, someone drops out all the time. In that way. The fractional reserve system is just a corrupt system where you start to enrich others, and then you can create wealth out of nowhere. Ask interest for that wealth that you've created out of nowhere. And just like Terra Luna, who created wealth out of nowhere, eventually it'll fail. The trouble with centralization is that you get the ability for a megalomaniac to take control of a certain power structure, whether that's a financial power structure or whatever it is, and tilt it towards their own benefit rather than the benefit of we the people.
00:22:18.022 - 00:23:29.038, Speaker B: I don't want to sound too, like, too commie or anything like that, but you want to try and help as many people as possible, having the best system in a society for money. So I find decentralization in terms of money is a great way to separate money and state, because state is fundamentally that centralization force. And the state has jumped in bed with private actors in the banking sector sector to create federal reserve systems globally. And so by decentralizing that, I feel that we can remove that centralized problem that's on the massive macro. But if you zoom into something like FTX, we've seen multiple cases of fraud and of problems with centralized authorities. Now some would say, well, we've seen many smart contracts being hacked or rug pulled and all the rest of it. So it's definitely not a panacea, but I think it's the right way to go moving forward.
00:23:29.038 - 00:23:59.290, Speaker B: And it's a combination, like we said earlier about education, but educating the consumer as well as great services like certec delivers with auditing and structuring as well as other auditing companies. Just time for people to understand this technology a little bit more and make it more user friendly.
00:24:00.270 - 00:24:17.230, Speaker A: Yeah, you mentioned USDC earlier in the conversation and you also had touched on terra Luna. So if both have their limitations, clearly with Terra Luna, where do you feel like, what is the right solution for a stablecoin?
00:24:19.090 - 00:24:58.074, Speaker B: Well, I'm biased here, but I feel that we've really gone towards trying to build the better solution. I don't like the fact know Terra Luna talked about capital can now, no one needs to lock up funds to create a stablecoin. So that's very capital efficient. But when it crashed and burnt billions of dollars, that's very capital unofficient. You've destroyed so much value. I look back at the gold standard at the first thing. I don't actually think that's the perfect way.
00:24:58.074 - 00:26:31.382, Speaker B: Because now you've got a centralized authority holding a bunch of gold and issuing debt on that gold as certificates, whether that's a creditor lending it to the vaulting facility and the vaulting facility issuing a certificate, or a state that can say, well, this paper always redeems in gold. Either way, you're manipulating the price of gold by saying one paper is always equal 1 gram. So now you're sort of manipulating gold. And this is actually what caused a lot of, well, some could say the Great Depression is because there was no incentive for new miners to find new gold sources because it was always going to equal one. There was no speculative uprising gold, it was always going to equal $1, so why look for more? So the gold standard, while being good at, hey, you've got this real world asset, you've got this rare asset backing paper. So that side of it was great, but the other side wasn't. What is really great about the crypto space and about the DeFi space is allowing anybody, thousands, millions of people, to lock up rare numbers, rather than rare metals into, meaning ethereum or Arb or link or, you know, some of these blue chip proper tokens, bitcoin wrap, bitcoin, of course, lock up that into a smart contract that they control, not a central, not anybody else, they control that.
00:26:31.382 - 00:27:50.580, Speaker B: Lock it and start to create debt from that, while leaving a buffer of collateral above. That, I think is, I think is the closest to perfect money that I can think of, because I think bitcoin is very close to perfect money, apart from the fact that it's highly volatile. But allowing you to lock up bitcoin at like 150% collateral, let's say, and then issuing yourself, let's say, you lock up 100 and you borrow 50, and you allow the volatility in there through that over collateralization, issuing that as debt, and with the standards at 0% interest, which then gets rid of the whole usury nonsense that we see in money creation, is, for me, really close to perfect money. You have a stable currency. Yes. Currently it's pegged to, like, us dollar or euros or indian rupee or other things. But I think we can go a step further and later on and say, well, we can peg this to indices, or we can start to have money that's pegged to gold again, but backed by rare crypto numbers.
00:27:50.580 - 00:27:56.260, Speaker B: So, yeah, that, to me, is the perfect money, I feel.
00:27:56.630 - 00:28:16.060, Speaker A: And you mentioned that this is something that you're working on at the standard. Can you shed a little bit more light about what exactly is the standard? What is it that you're trying to accomplish? You mentioned that there are certain gaps in Defi, and the right products and solutions will fill those gaps. Well, would have loved to learn a little bit more about what that.
00:28:16.990 - 00:29:05.686, Speaker B: Great. Well, yeah, so the standard came from initially, when I got asked, because I've ran this bitcoin physical gold exchange, many people were always confused, is it tokenized gold? And it wasn't. It was just allocated bullion sitting in a high security vaulting facility. It was fully insured, fully audited, but people would buy fractions of bars and then they could get it delivered out to them if they wanted to, or if they bought the whole bar, or they could convert it into. Anyway. I got asked to give a talk at Labicomf in 2019 about stablecoins, and because the gold wasn't tokenized, but it was still stable. That's the whole point of Altoro.
00:29:05.686 - 00:29:48.650, Speaker B: It was like you could take profits and have it in something stable, even though it wasn't a token. So I gave this talk and basically warned people about centralized stablecoins and algorithmic stablecoins, saying that there's going to be a huge algorithmic stablecoin. It's going to get very big because it has got this air of capital efficiency, and then it's going to die because they always die. And it wasn't like I had some magic ball or some sort of foresight. It was basically because I'd seen it before. I'd been in this industry for long enough. I'd seen bitshares from Dan Larimer collapse, I'd seen multiple tries of purely algorithmic stablecoins collapse and die.
00:29:48.650 - 00:30:40.070, Speaker B: And it sucks when it happens because it's a good enough dream, but it effectively doesn't work. So after that conference, I went home and started to really think about what the best stablecoin would be. And yeah, like I said, the best stablecoin is allowing anybody to lock up their own crypto into a smart contract. They don't need to trust a central authority like a bank or blockfi or anything, and then borrow mint new stablecoins from that value. But then the next thing was, okay, well, there's already like makerdao out there doing this sort of thing, so how can we make that better? Well, I had a debt be liquidated and I felt so locked in. And we saw the problem with locking in things. Even with.
00:30:40.070 - 00:30:58.906, Speaker B: Well, someone could say this was the downfall of Celsius. They bought too much staked ETH, which was locked in. They couldn't. Three arrows capital locked in, they couldn't do anything with it. So as a borrower, it's very, very important to have some sort of flexibility with your collateral. Even though it's locked. Yes, it might be locked.
00:30:58.906 - 00:31:57.370, Speaker B: So with the standard, you can put Ethereum wrapped bitcoin, arb link and pax gold into one smart vault. So you can have a whole portfolio of different cryptos in one smart vault. Issue yourself debt, and let's say the market turns, china bans crypto again, and everything's bleeding red in the market. Well, what might not be is tokenized gold, because gold is still a rare asset, but it's sitting on a different train track. We've all seen it. Bitcoin goes down, the whole market's red, bitcoin goes up, the whole market's green, apart from the OD outliers. Right? So being able to trade your locked collateral, let's say you've got some ETH, it's going red, it's heading towards collateral, like your vault being liquidated, you can take that and swap it within the vault to tokenized gold.
00:31:57.370 - 00:33:00.518, Speaker B: And then if the market turns and goes back green, you can trade it back into that same amount of value, back into like link or something that you feel is going to go up. The ability to sell debt and collateral, sell these smart vaults as an NFT, I was playing around with NFTs before they were called nfts, that they were called colored coins on bitcoin years ago. And we were throwing around ideas in the community about how you could use these products in finance, as well as like using door locks and stuff like that. Like other things with the standard. What happens is when you lock up funds into a smart vault, that smart vault issues a dynamic NFT. And the dynamic NFT basically is an SVG file, so it's not a pixel file, and it pulls data from the blockchain in real time and displays it in the image. So it'll display in the image like, okay, this person's got one ETH locked up, 0.5
00:33:00.518 - 00:33:52.280, Speaker B: Arb and whatever else, and tell you the euro value for the Eurovault, and then tell you how much debt has been taken out against that. And then you can actually just sell that to somebody, and someone can buy that debt and collateral, pay off the debt and remove the collateral that's worth more. So it's a great way of, let's say you've taken out a huge debt, you've bought a car, you've lost your job, you've got a bunch of collateral sitting in there, but you need liquidity. You could just go onto opensea and sell that. Someone will buy it and give you some liquidity for that debt and collateral. So that's also a really interesting use case. Funny thing was, we developed this, and then I read a blog post from someone at Metamask who had been analyzing large hacks in the space.
00:33:52.280 - 00:35:02.490, Speaker B: And it turned out that a lot of these OGs were getting their seed phrases stolen. And the common denominator in all of that is they all had it in Lastpass. And Lastpass a year earlier, had been hacked, which was a password management, data storage, encrypted storage space, and they'd been hacked. And they said, oh, don't worry, every vault, what the hacker got, these blobs of data are all encrypted, but the only thing not encrypted was the email associated with that blob. So the hackers have meanwhile been spear phishing or basically been looking for OGs in the crypto space, taking that blob of data and brute force, cracking weaker passwords and busting it open, stealing the funds. And so I thought, I have some test wallets that I had in Lastpass. Slowly, over time, test wallets become like real wallets because the value goes up and you keep on just using it, which is probably not a good idea.
00:35:02.490 - 00:35:27.742, Speaker B: But anyway, I thought, let's close some debts. So I went over and I had to close a liquidy debt. I closed a maker debt, but it sucked because I had to pay off the debt at a loss because Ethereum had gone down. I was like, pay off the debt, all right. And then I had to withdraw to another transaction to withdraw to my wallet. Then I had to move that wallet over to a new uncompromised seed, load it back up, reborrow. It was a big hassle.
00:35:27.742 - 00:36:09.794, Speaker B: I went over to the standard, dogs got. I went over to the standard, I have like 25 different vaults. I went over to OpeNC, I select all of those NFTs and just sent them in one transaction all over to a new seed. That was just for me, a beautiful use case of something that we hadn't designed for. But it was a great way to, if you feel your seed has been compromised or looked at, you don't need to go and close all your debts and repay them and do all this nonsense. You just send that debt to a new seed and hey presto, you're secure again. So that's just a little bit of the standard.
00:36:09.794 - 00:37:05.960, Speaker B: The last thing about the standard, apart from collateral management and these NFTs, is that we will be releasing. We started off with euros, which is a euro based stablecoin, and next we'll be launching USDs for USD standard, and then indian rupee, great british pound, canadian dollars, australian dollars, and just going through the gamut of the main fiat. So we really want to build a decentralized stablecoin ecosystem and hopefully build an effects market based on that, that will allow people to start to deal with. The effects market is literally the most liquid market in the world. So it should definitely come all on chain as fast as possible as far as I'm concerned. So yeah, that's what we're aiming towards.
00:37:06.570 - 00:37:32.062, Speaker A: Amazing. Being that you are working on a stable coin. There's obviously in Capitol Hill a lot of conversations about the regulatory aspect in Europe. You have, Mika, I believe do you keep those things in mind as you're navigating these waters, or do you feel like being that you're in defi, that's not something that you should really be concerned about.
00:37:32.196 - 00:38:34.338, Speaker B: I spend a lot of time with regulators, with the centralized exchange that we build, and I think there's a definite need for regulators when it comes to centralized authorities like FTX. They need some sort of authority to say, look, if you mess around, you're going to go to prison or there's going to be some sort know. If it's not prison, there has to be some rule set that is good saying that the gold industry is self regulated in the UK by a regulatory body that is non enforcing. But it means that if you follow their rules, you can put the. There's too many acronyms in the world. The London Bullion Market association, stamp onto your product. If you're dealing with gold right, you follow the rules and you can put that mark on your stamp, on your product or service.
00:38:34.338 - 00:39:40.710, Speaker B: So I do think there's a case for regulation, whether it's voluntary or not. But when it comes to DeFi, like I said, we're creating software that allows people to lock up their own assets and have full control of their own assets and then mint from themselves. Mint, a thing that happens to track fiat currency. I feel like there's nothing really that regulators can do with that. What we can do is say as an industry, we are only going to support. We're going to support projects that are truly audited and the best practices, just like the London Bullion Market association, we should be focusing on best practices for people to go towards. Oh, look, Makerdao is working on a thing.
00:39:40.710 - 00:40:12.270, Speaker B: They have these best practices. One bad thing is that they allow USDC to be a collateral. So that's maybe something a tick because nothing's perfect in the space, but allowing a consumer to see and understand the risk profile of these projects is really important. And the true regulator, the true arbiter of rules, should be maths and should be the smart contract, in my opinion.
00:40:13.810 - 00:40:41.980, Speaker A: Yeah, and thanks for sharing that, Josh. There's a lot of folks that are building in Defi and many of them, most of them have really good intentions and many of them wouldn't even show their face. But you're out there, you're showing your face, you're educating people. And I think that the industry needs more people like that. So appreciate you coming on. Where can people follow along your journey and the standard?
00:40:42.990 - 00:41:10.210, Speaker B: Yeah, well, just head over to thestandard IO and you can also follow us on Twitter, which is thestandard underscore IO. And me personally, I'm at J. Shigala, which is my name. So j S c I g a l a on Twitter and you can follow my mad ramblings on there anytime.
00:41:10.710 - 00:41:16.980, Speaker A: Wonderful. I'll be sure to include those links in the description and any parting thoughts for the.
00:41:18.870 - 00:41:56.640, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, my parting thoughts is don't let the media. I know a few people just that missed out on bitcoin because they listen to people saying it's this, it's that, it's for drug dealers or it's just negative, negative nellies just constantly saying bad stuff. Use your own mind. Look for actual problems being solved and look for good teams like we mentioned before. And use this bear market for your advantage because bear markets are where you pick up, you buy when there's blood in the streets, as they say.
00:41:57.890 - 00:42:08.310, Speaker A: That is what they say for sure. Josh, this was a real pleasure. Thanks so much for coming on and sharing about the standard and just talking defi. It's always a pleasure to connect with you.
00:42:08.460 - 00:42:10.020, Speaker B: Thank you, Mikhail. Thank you very much.
