00:00:19.652 - 00:00:21.454, Speaker A: Create a system that's based on.
00:00:21.492 - 00:00:22.606, Speaker B: Trust and susceptible to.

00:00:25.370 - 00:00:26.134, Speaker B: And that's why.
00:00:26.172 - 00:00:27.894, Speaker A: We'Re trying to create something that is.
00:00:27.932 - 00:00:28.854, Speaker B: Accountable for people.
00:00:28.892 - 00:00:29.814, Speaker A: 100%.
00:00:29.932 - 00:00:32.374, Speaker B: That is 100% clear as to.

00:00:46.242 - 00:00:48.214, Speaker A: Which is how these things are supposed to be built.
00:00:48.252 - 00:00:48.966, Speaker UNK: I think a lot of people are.
00:00:48.988 - 00:00:49.898, Speaker A: Creating centralized.
