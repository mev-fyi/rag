00:00:00.360 - 00:00:09.318, Speaker A: There are some early stage projects I want to keep on your radar. Last time I talked to Max of Archway, I asked him to name a few projects that are on his mind.
00:00:09.446 - 00:01:05.316, Speaker B: And I actually do really like union's vision quite a bit and what they're trying to do. So I'd say that's a really cool and super strong team, both technically and from the people I've worked with on business development side and marketing side have been great as well. So I would say union for sure. Another, I guess is high yield. So they're actually currently on Avalanche and they're real world asset product. They're a team that I've known for a while, the Lydia Labs team. They built out liquid finance on archway and so good relationship with them and yeah, that's a product I think is really cool where basically they've established partnerships with different banking rails to allow them to actually tokenize treasuries and other actual government basket and asset backed securities from off chain and basically get them on chain tokenized so that you can invest in those, basically earn five whatever plus percent on your assets through government backed securities, which is really cool.
00:01:05.316 - 00:01:30.104, Speaker B: Or asset backed securities, I should say. So. That to me is a really cool product. Only on avalanche now, we're working on some things to make it possible for potentially beyond Archway, so we'll keep you in the loop on that. Ambulance finance is doing some auto repaid loans. That's pretty interesting. I think they're going to be deployed on neutron, their team that we actually initially onboarded to Archway, and we're hoping they'll deploy there as well eventually.
00:01:30.104 - 00:01:31.272, Speaker B: But really cool product.
00:01:31.328 - 00:01:45.584, Speaker A: So after the recording, I decided to do a little bit of digging to help you understand these three projects. Do keep in mind that I have no affiliation with these projects and they are very early stage and may be very risky. So do your own research.
00:01:45.704 - 00:01:47.496, Speaker C: But here's a head start for you.
00:01:47.560 - 00:02:16.944, Speaker A: Before I dive in, please take a moment to hit the like button and subscribe. It'll help support my guests and my show. We're inching closer to that 1000 mark. Thanks so much for all of your support. First, let's start with amulet finance. Imagine you have a piggy bank that pays you a little money every day for just keeping it filled. In the case of amulet finance, this piggy bank is like staking tokens in a cosmos ecosystem, a process where you lock up your digital coins to support a network's operations and security.
00:02:16.944 - 00:02:50.984, Speaker A: Here, you can also get a loan based on the future rewards of your estate coins are expected to earn, and this loan pays itself back over time from those same rewards. The platform is supposedly designed to be very secure without holding onto your coins directly. To make sure that there's safety and simplicity in using your digital assets. This way you can use the money without waiting for the rewards to come in slowly, making your investment work harder for you. Currently it is in testnet and there are many incentives to participate early.
00:02:51.144 - 00:02:52.704, Speaker C: First, set up a wallet.
00:02:52.824 - 00:02:56.464, Speaker A: Before you start, you'll need to create a wallet compatible with the testnet such.
00:02:56.504 - 00:02:58.568, Speaker C: As Kepler or leap.
00:02:58.696 - 00:03:38.692, Speaker A: These wallets will allow you to interact with amulet dashboard and manage your testnet tokens. Then visit amulet testnet site, agree to the terms and connect your wallet. Once connected, you can claim Testnet, atom and neutron tokens. These tokens are used for testing purposes on the neutron and cosmos testnets without risking real assets. After claiming your tokens on the Cosmos hub testnet, youll need to bridge these to the neutron testnet. This involves transferring some of your atom tokens to cover future transactions and utilizing the rest for testnet activities. Youll want to explore amulets features with your testnet tokens.
00:03:38.692 - 00:04:40.076, Speaker A: You can stake your atom so you can lock your testnet atom to participate in network security. You can also get 50% of your staked atom in advance, which self repays from your staking rewards. Then monitor and manage how your advance decreases as rewards accrue or repay early using your tokens. Amulet also offers features like one click advance where you can instantly stake Atom and receive an advance in one click mint to convert Atom into Am Atom without staking. Then you also want to engage with the amulet finance, Telegram and discord communities to connect with other testers, ask questions and share your experiences. Keep in mind that the site says the smart contracts have been audited by Oak security, but at the time of this recording, I don't see the actual report, which I'm not a big fan of. But that's not to say that there's not a report, and it's not to say that there's alarming issues here.
00:04:40.076 - 00:05:21.276, Speaker A: Next up is Highyield. Highyield is a platform that connects web3 natives to traditional capital markets. It allows users to invest in different assets like treasury bills, corporate bonds and equities through a process that involves depositing USDC, converting it to USD, and purchasing assets. These assets are then held by a custodian tokenized and the tokens are given to the investor. Highyield manages the full cycle from KYC verification to asset tokenization. When I talked to Eric, who is the head of Defi at Avalanche. He told me theyre really focused on onboarding tradfi into the world of blockchain.
00:05:21.276 - 00:06:18.758, Speaker A: Last year, Avalanche invested 50 million into a new initiative, Avalanche Vista, which had a goal of enhancing asset tokenization on its network. This fund was allocated to purchase different tokenized assets, including equity, credit, real estate, commodities and blockchain native assets, so there is a strong commitment to integrate real world assets into decentralized finance. Last but not least is union union enhances interoperability across various networks using advanced zero knowledge cryptography and consensus verification. Its goal is to promote secure and efficient cross chain interactions. A few things to keep in mind here by using advanced ZK cryptography and consensus verification technologies. This allows for seamless asset transfers, NFT transactions and decentralized finance operations across a variety of blockchains. The second point is the scalability.
00:06:18.758 - 00:06:38.754, Speaker A: Union supports a wide range of execution environments and is designed to scale up to thousands of networks. This promotes horizontal scalability, which is very critical for supporting the growing demands of blockchain applications and services. Another point is by using ZK Proof's union, make sure that transaction details and.
00:06:38.794 - 00:06:41.290, Speaker C: User data are kept private, which is.
00:06:41.322 - 00:07:14.246, Speaker A: Supposed to enhance the security. The platform is designed to support reliable communication between blockchains without having to rely on trusted third parties or oracles. They're pretty active in the community partnering up with Polygon, which emphasizes the commitment to community driven growth and development. They also have a testnet that you can participate in. There are potential rewards. Unions incentivized campaigns often offer token rewards for active participation and contribution to network's development and stress testing.
00:07:14.360 - 00:07:17.458, Speaker C: Details of these type of rewards are.
00:07:17.506 - 00:08:01.222, Speaker A: Usually announced closer to the campaign launch or mainnet launch events. Testnet validators might receive Testnet tokens as part of their role in maintaining and securing the network. This not only provides practical experience, but may also align with the potential rewards depending on the specific contributions and roles undertaken through the testnet phase. Overall, Union has a compelling value proposition for participants interested in the evolving and sometimes complex landscape of blockchain interoperability. For those looking to dive deeper or participate in the testnet, stay engaged with union's official communication channels such as their website and also their discord. I'll be sure to provide those links as well.
00:08:01.278 - 00:08:06.798, Speaker C: So there you have it folks. Three projects that are very early stage, but they best way to create life.
00:08:06.846 - 00:08:09.494, Speaker A: Changing wealth is to be educated and.
00:08:09.574 - 00:08:10.846, Speaker C: This is a good place to start.
00:08:10.910 - 00:08:27.774, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on these three projects? Leave a comment below or if there are any other projects you want me to do a review on, hit me up and let me know. Also, I will be attending consensus 2024, end of May. If you're attending, please reach out. We'd love to connect. I'm Mikael, and I'll catch you in the next video.
