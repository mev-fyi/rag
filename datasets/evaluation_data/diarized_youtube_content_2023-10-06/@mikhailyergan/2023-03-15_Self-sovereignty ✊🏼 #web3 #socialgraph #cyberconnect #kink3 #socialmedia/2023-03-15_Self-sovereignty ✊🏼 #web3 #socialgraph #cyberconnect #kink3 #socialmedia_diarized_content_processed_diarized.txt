When I want to export my Facebook friends to different applications, there's currently no way to do that. So Cyberkinet itself is really trying to provide that data layer that's publicly accessible and really follows the own there the user sign up. So imagine when you log into any platform, you can directly log in with your cyber connect profile, and then you don't have to fill in any other information. And your followers, your friends, your previous contents are always available in a different application, their relationship stored on chain. And then those applicants don't need to bootstrap the start period where they have to ask you to onboard all your friends, all those kind of stuff.
