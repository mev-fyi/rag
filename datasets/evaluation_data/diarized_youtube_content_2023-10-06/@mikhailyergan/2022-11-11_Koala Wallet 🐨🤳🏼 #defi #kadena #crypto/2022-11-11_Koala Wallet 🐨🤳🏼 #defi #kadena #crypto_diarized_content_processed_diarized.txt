00:00:00.330 - 00:00:39.240, Speaker A: That's where we really plan on separating ourselves from a typical wallet, where you're just send, receiving and storing and really allowing users to have a multi tool. Just like if they're using WeChat or other conclusive platforms to manage their day to day lives of texting calling. This is where we see their financials going. This is where we see their asset control. That one day they won't be opening their fidelity account, that they'll just be going right to their wallet, where they themselves are in charge of their own finances and can control it really seamlessly in one place. So unfettered access to a bunch of different applications around web3, a lot of buzwords, but we're actually doing it in Koala Wallet, and we've actually started already with a few partners right inside.
