00:00:01.050 - 00:00:02.778, Speaker A: Oh, baby.
00:00:02.954 - 00:00:24.094, Speaker B: All right, guys, mikhail coming in with crypto. Grady. Grady, you are one of the most energetic, optimistic guys that I know, and I think right now where we are with the current market conditions, it's exactly what we need. So I appreciate you taking the time to hop on and just chop it up.
00:00:24.212 - 00:00:43.740, Speaker A: Mikhail, are one of my favorite human beings on the planet of earth. I love you, man, love what you do. I love your vibe. There's a lot of potential with you. You keep it up, you keep doing what you're doing, there's no telling where this can go. I'm a believer in mikhail, baby, let's go.
00:00:44.270 - 00:00:59.360, Speaker B: I appreciate that. Grady, let's jump right in. All right, so I know that you are big on gaming. There are certain games that you've been playing on your channel, which, if you want to give us a quick plug, what that is.
00:00:59.730 - 00:01:27.270, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting. I was really just more of a crypto guy, crypto believer that turned into a big time DFI guy. And I noticed my kids, I've got five kids that I know of, and pretty sure it's just five, I promise. Okay. And they're playing all these games all the time. I'm like, guys, you can be playing all these play to earn games out there.
00:01:27.270 - 00:02:10.710, Speaker A: So I was trying to get them into it, and in the process, it got me into the games to help try and get them into the games. Okay. And I had made some crazy games from Axie Infinity and a lot of different games out there. Back in there was like a little gaming bull run that happened out there a couple of few years ago and killed it and was trying to get my kids into it. Well, and then I was really into like, fate and arena some of those games and got my kids into it some. But keeping their interest is a whole nother thing. But my main thing is that I've always wanted to find that next phenomenal 1000 x gain in crypto.
00:02:10.710 - 00:02:55.346, Speaker A: And the way my thought process worked with it is, hey, I want to find those teens with strong core fundamental values, core values of the golden rule. Not looking at the five minutes in front of their face trying to make a quick buck, not money driven. They're out there, they've got a vision and a passion and a why that's driving them. They're trying to solve a problem or fix something or have some amazing new technology or new innovation to make. Crypto, I believe, will become kind of like the Internet is today, kind of like cell phones are today versus 20 years ago. It's been quite a change in a short time. And that's what I see.
00:02:55.346 - 00:03:46.034, Speaker A: Crypto changing finance as we know it in all facets of our lives, in so many ways, in blockchain, okay? And so wanting to find what's the next phenomenal project out there, the phenomenal team that's grinding with the 1000 X game, of course, looking for that, but also for the tech itself and get in on that. We all wish we were in bitcoin when it was at a penny, when bitcoin was at a dollar. We wish we're in there. Well, what's another one that's going to be coming up and be a winner long term? Okay. And so I've always been on this hunt to find these awesome projects and these awesome teams. And I was really getting familiarized with gaming being, okay. This is going to be a sector where crypto becomes real world utility, real world mainstream.
00:03:46.034 - 00:04:31.538, Speaker A: That's like simple and a no brainer versus people playing Call of Duty. They put in hundreds, thousands of dollars, and then they don't own the NFT, they don't own any of it, they don't control any of it. And it's like, okay, crypto gaming is going to be one of the front runners here to overtake our traditional system out there. That's an obvious one to me. Well, this is kind of how this evolved. I find this team Defi kingdoms, and I'm like, after years of being on crypto, this team is out here doing weekly Amas and they're really transparent and they seem to have the strong core values. Then you dig deeper into the team.
00:04:31.538 - 00:05:15.630, Speaker A: They're big brains, they're sharp. Now, here's what almost all crypto projects, they can't get out of their own way when it comes to messaging, communication, marketing, like, can't. It's like they don't get it and it's a disaster. Okay. Except like Cardano, there's know, I guess Vitalik Butyrin is all right with Ethereum. He doesn't get in his own way at know. But besides that, I can't hardly think of a project that can even help themselves from getting in their own way and just shooting themselves in the foot when it comes to messaging, marketing and how to juggle that properly.
00:05:15.630 - 00:05:54.970, Speaker A: And so I noticed that even though Defi kingdoms does their weekly amas, so they're better than most right off the bat when it comes to that, but still couldn't get out of their own way when all this Fud came against them in May or late April of 2022. And all these people were accusing frisky Fox of being a rug pull and this, that, and the other. And I just knew, no, it's false. And the team did not get in front of the Met, and it went all the way up to George. George just reported on the news. He was saying, doesn't look like D Five Kingdoms is going to survive. I think they're saying Frisky Fox is a rug.
00:05:54.970 - 00:06:31.478, Speaker A: George said all that, and he said it multiple times. He's like, I'm getting out of DFI kingdoms. And that just further. It's like a 99% exodus out of the ecosystem. And I'm like, you know what? This is like the best project I've ever seen in crypto when it comes to sort of what I'm looking for as far as big potential, they're doing breakthrough things. They've done things such as you can now combine two nfts, bridge them, cross chain in one transactions, and separate the two NFTs. You can add the pet to the hero.
00:06:31.478 - 00:07:04.734, Speaker A: Now you can add equipment to the hero. Things like that never been done in crypto. For example. They're just doing several things like that that we haven't really seen before, and big vision, all kinds of potential. They've got wisdom gaming out there, partnered with them, actually, like a part of the team, part of their team and part of Wisdom's team. They're developing out the PvP, pve crafting system, traveling systems, so much going, and big vision. They've had a lot of the Harmony bridge hack almost killed them, but they didn't die.
00:07:04.734 - 00:07:42.880, Speaker A: They keep grinding. And so that's kind of what I look for in crypto is I like to methodically deep dive into projects, and so it doesn't have to be, but it kind of turned into where, I guess I'm a gaming guy and that I am, but it's really, I mean, my roots, a lot of my roots are Defi, as you know, there's so many good projects out there that I still don't know very much about, that I want to learn and support the good guys out there, like Mikhail himself, our man. I love it.
00:07:43.590 - 00:07:59.666, Speaker B: I appreciate that. A lot to unpack there. So you mentioned that Defi kingdoms, you're obviously very passionate about the project. You stuck with them through thick and thin. Why isn't what they're building, why isn't that easily replicated?
00:07:59.778 - 00:08:52.822, Speaker A: Well, right now, through the bear, all we've seen is most projects have to close their doors, they run out of money, but there's been a lot of copycats, Defi Kingdom's copycats and similar. There's one recently that I was also into a little bit called Mind games, and that one just shut its doors because the token was the token they needed. They needed the value of the token to hold up because that was how the team was getting funded. So they're relying on their token, trying to bring demand for the token, while at the same time being in a spot where they're forced to sell the token that's allotted to the team to fund the team. Well, the token just kept crashing. Crash, crash, crash, crash, crash, crash. Till they ran out.
00:08:52.822 - 00:09:57.526, Speaker A: It was like the devs went from getting paid like $1,000 a week to $15 a week, and then eventually they had no treasury and closed the door and it was like, what the heck? So it's hard. You got to be super innovative to stay ahead of. How can this sustain itself? How can the tokenomics sustain? How can the team and the treasury sustain itself to where they can continue to develop and innovate? And that's like, the details there is very difficult, fine tuned, and you have to do it right. And most of the time, it's not one. And that's another reason why with Defi kingdoms, they've got this guy, Hubert Cumberdale, baby, and big brains and dreamer, who was executive at, you know, before being with the team. Just so many dream team type guys in there developing and the devs, and so it's hard. And even then, it's still a risk.
00:09:57.526 - 00:10:22.690, Speaker A: They've almost died. That project almost died multiple times after the Harmony bridge hack because they were on the harmony blockchain. And it's amazing that they've even survived this long. But now we're seeing all these partnerships they're making big time. We're anticipating, we're hoping, we're praying they're going to be on the next crypto gym TV show, which is one of my most bullish projects as well. The hourglass weight community is phenomenal. The weight token.
00:10:22.690 - 00:11:02.830, Speaker A: And I love jet with the next crypto gym. Everything going on there, man, I'm so pumped for that. Everything. Gosh dang. There's a lot of people trying to duplicate it, but what they're doing has never been done before. They're blazing trails in the crypto space that we haven't seen, and you can try and duplicate that to an extent, but it takes a lot to wrap your mind around that entire ecosystem and everything they're doing. And I haven't seen anybody able to duplicate that yet, but it's possible, I suppose.
00:11:04.150 - 00:11:27.560, Speaker B: Well, I'm curious to know from you, because you play a lot of games and there's other factors that you look at how much of your judgment of a game is the actual gameplay experience versus what's happening on paper. Right? Like the tokenomics, the price, like all those other factors that go into crypto. What would you say?
00:11:28.330 - 00:11:48.286, Speaker A: That's a great question for George's channel. Cryptos, RS plus that we're both doing. We're both excited for. All right, we're going to be doing the gaming section of the channel and we're going to be pitting two games against each other that are similar every week or that's the goal. It's a lot of work. We'll see. Hopefully we can do one a week.
00:11:48.286 - 00:12:18.310, Speaker A: We'll see on that. Maybe two or three a month might be more realistic and we might try and do like a gaming news section or something. We'll see on that. The first thing we look at is number one, tokenomics, token utility and upside. Number two, NFT, cost and entry to enter the game. And NFT, utility and supply versus value, the potential upside for the NFTs. Number three, we look at, okay, this team's social score.
00:12:18.310 - 00:12:42.954, Speaker A: Most all teams are probably going to get low grades on this. Marketing, messaging, communication, I. E. Their social score. That's number three. Number four, the team's partnerships, finances, treasury and backing and sustainability, essentially. Is this thing sustainable? Okay, number five is the gameplay and number five is the most important part, the gameplay.
00:12:42.954 - 00:13:15.270, Speaker A: But we know there's a lot of people out there that aren't necessarily interested in getting in there and playing the game. Being a pro at the game or whatever it is, I do it some. I definitely have my plate full with dragons crossing, for example. They have a seasonal play and I love that game. So I'm a huge dragons crossing bull and nobody knows about it. It's like a little gym tucked away in crypto. Phenomenal team, huge big brains.
00:13:15.270 - 00:13:48.470, Speaker A: The game came out day one, fully playable, ready to go. On day one, there's no token, so you don't got to worry about the team needing to rely on the token for the pump and dump things. And it's a sustainable model long term. As long as there's people playing, there's not people playing. It's not sustainable. And it's so big brains and it's one of the most addictive, if not the most addictive, web three game out there currently at the moment is Dragons crossing. You enter into seasonal play.
00:13:48.470 - 00:14:27.460, Speaker A: And I played that game, okay, because I've got 43 heroes now. I played that game for 55 hours straight. I stayed up two nights in a row and a full day. And between those two I was playing, it was like this five day period that was nuts. And I went two straight nights without sleeping playing this game straight. Have you ever heard of that? I was wondering, hey, I need to flex about this a little more. What game has caused somebody to do that that anybody can think of? Well, Dragons crossing did, and I ended up being the most profitable of season two.
00:14:27.460 - 00:15:21.650, Speaker A: And I should have been even a lot more profitable. That's a different story in the game. And it's just fun getting my kids into it and stuff. So that is the most important thing is the gameplay itself. But all these other things are super important for a project. Could a gaming project survive if it was horrible tokenomics, horrible NFT cost and value, and a bad team when it comes to messaging, marketing, communication, their social score? And if they had no partnerships and not a whole lot of treasury and backing, if just based off the fun gameplay alone, could that sustain itself? The answer is yes, it could. And it could still go big and be big, but it's unlikely.
00:15:21.650 - 00:15:57.998, Speaker A: So all these things, all these five criteria are super important. Don't have to have them all, okay? But the most important one out of the five, obviously, I would say for games, is the gameplay itself. And so that's why we're bringing on the gurus of games. If I'm not a guru of the game, I'm bringing somebody on who is. And then I'm a slow, methodical guy. So I won't become a guru overnight of a game either. I like to do more of a methodical, deep dive into things, and I'm always trying to learn and grow, but that's kind of what we're looking for.
00:15:57.998 - 00:16:30.200, Speaker A: And most of these games, I'm just not going to have time to play them. But I'm still interested in maybe owning an NFT, if it's worth owning, if it has the potential upside to raise in value and or the token if it's got like Axio Infinity. Got in there $0.50, started selling at $79 per token, then started, sold some more to 100 and 120, and then sold all the way out of Axio Infinity when it was right at $165, believe it or not.
00:16:31.870 - 00:17:03.620, Speaker B: Brings up a really good point, Grady. So you obviously play these games because you love the gameplay, but there is a certain investment element to this, right? You want to see the token, like you say, ten X, 100 X, whatever the case may be. Do you think that that type of mentality, do you think it hinders our ability to change the narrative for web three gaming and its focus being around the actual gaming experience?
00:17:04.230 - 00:17:26.460, Speaker A: No, I would say if anything, it just broadens the horizon, broadens the potential. Just imagine if, like, I've never played Clash of Clans or Call of Duty with all these big games. Okay, but imagine if there is upside. I could buy their stock maybe, right? If it's a public company or something. Can I buy the stock? Can I do that?
00:17:27.870 - 00:17:29.498, Speaker B: Call of Duty? Absolutely, yeah.
00:17:29.584 - 00:17:34.734, Speaker A: Call of Duty. I can go to the stock market and buy some Call of Duty shares. I don't know. I'm not a stock guy.
00:17:34.772 - 00:17:40.858, Speaker B: Activision. Yeah, you can buy Activision, which is a company that makes Call of Duty.
00:17:40.954 - 00:18:12.254, Speaker A: So I'm not playing the game, but I'm investing in the potential upside of the game. And that just brings more exposure to the game. Like with DFI kingdoms that did something like a 10,000 x in a very short, like in a matter of months. Like a couple few months. Okay, back, it's about two years ago now. They're coming up on their second birthday. Defi Kingdoms is, well, most of the people were coming in there for the Defi aspect of it because that is a robust ecosystem.
00:18:12.254 - 00:18:40.340, Speaker A: First and foremost. It's a DeFi platform and they're a blockchain. And they can support other games too coming on. So other developers, third party developers like crazy. They're developing games right now as we speak on Defi Kingdoms, the DFK chain and avalanche subnet. Okay. So they do so much that subnet, by the way, is doing something like 3 million transactions per day and just doing awesome.
00:18:40.340 - 00:19:02.914, Speaker A: And it's a fraction of a penny each transaction. And it's like doing well. That's like a good sign for avalanche. And the subnet is phenomenal. So I would say I wasn't playing DeFi, I wasn't owning heroes. I wasn't summoning heroes when I first came in. I was just in the creating liquidity.
00:19:02.914 - 00:19:30.194, Speaker A: I was a defi guy. But then I started diving a little deeper into the ecosystem. I'm like, oh man, I need to buy up a couple of heroes. And then now I own over 2000 heroes and 19 gen Zeros in that ecosystem. And so I would say it just brings more exposure. Then you can treat Dfi kingdoms as Dfi. Even if you're not playing the game.
00:19:30.194 - 00:19:52.566, Speaker A: You can buy up an army of heroes you can get with a bodding service like DFK helper. There's third party bodding services that are awesome. And the DFK helper is kind of becoming the main one. Zellies is out there. He's doxed. We know where he lives and he is just front and center. He's like one of the biggest defi king of bulls.
00:19:52.566 - 00:20:27.430, Speaker A: He's on everybody's stream. So he's got an automation, full blown automation service that you can farm the items in game items with your heroes and then you can just sell them, you can dump them. And at times it changes fast. The ingame economy changes fast, okay. Because the ecosystem is evolving so fast. Like every other week we get a new update in the game of the developers. They're developing stuff out so fast in there.
00:20:27.430 - 00:21:11.780, Speaker A: And so once the game launches Pve. PvP and crafting, there's going to be phenomenal mind blowing gains in the in game items too. Things like tiers, we've already seen this year, tiers have, they were up at one point they had like 50 x the tiers, which are an item you almost need everything in the game for stamina, potions and all the potions, the stones. And so you're trying to get these awesome heroes for PvP. So you're going to have people just wanting to play pvp. They're just going to want to come in and buy the best heroes they can and compete because it's going to be esport level game. Then you're going to have people farming for the items that those players need.
00:21:11.780 - 00:21:40.290, Speaker A: And the players aren't going to be as concerned about the cost of things. They're just wanting to have fun, play the game and compete. You're going to have people farming for items. You're going to have people farming trying to make the best heroes, which is like a science. Summoning and dark summoning and trying to make these awesome PvP monsters. And then they try and make the awesome PvP monster and then sell it. You got people farming for items.
00:21:40.290 - 00:22:13.670, Speaker A: And there's so many different things you can do in the ecosystem. There's guilds, there's lands, the huge utility. There's crafting. Okay? There's going to be people focusing on crafting items, all these different things. And there's just going to be people providing liquidity for the d five protocols. And so there's a huge range of things you can do in that ecosystem without necessarily having to play the game. And I think that's going to be the case with a lot of web three gaming.
00:22:13.670 - 00:22:33.600, Speaker A: There is going to be those web three games like Dragons crossing, where it's just simple. It's a game, you get in there and play. It's not esport level, but it's super fun and addictive and there's nothing else to it. You go compete. It's a seasonal play, there's a leaderboard, and you try to win the season, you make money doing it. Or there's winners and losers. It's that simple.
00:22:33.600 - 00:22:51.586, Speaker A: And it's kind of like a draft team's style. There's a rake. That's how the team makes money, that's how it sustains. And you hope to find NFTs too, that are super rare. But you find those NFT spell books or summoning shards. You can sell them, you can summon new heroes. Not very many.
00:22:51.586 - 00:23:14.010, Speaker A: There's hardly any. And that's kind of simple. And there's other games like that too. But I think a lot of the games that I see coming out, there's going to be competitive players and then there's going to be people that might want to be involved in the ecosystem of the game to do other things besides just playing the game, but still be involved in the game. It's fun. We'll have all.
00:23:14.080 - 00:23:53.666, Speaker B: So it sounds like you think that just web three in general, we're going to have almost like different tentacles. You have one that is specifically geared towards gameplay, which to me personally, I think is the hardest one to accomplish. It's the one that requires the most money because you're competing against all the Fortnites and the call of Duties of the world. And then you have these other games that are more of gamifying Defi. Right. Where it's not necessarily about the graphics, but more about just creating a fun way to make money, essentially. So we're almost finding like a divergence.
00:23:53.858 - 00:24:24.074, Speaker A: Yeah. Making that sustainable. There's not too many things out there that can sustain. What the last thing you just said, gamifying defi to make money. How is that sustained? There's winners and losers. It'll be a zero sum game in the end, most likely in those scenarios. But where defi kingdoms comes in is on the defi side and on all these, if they create demand for the earning token, the power token, you got to have to play the game of Defi kingdoms.
00:24:24.074 - 00:24:53.162, Speaker A: Well, that's also the token you earn in the dex. That's the earning token for the yield farmers out there. Okay. And that power token is also being burned as it's used in the game. If you hatch eggs, if you summon heroes, which there's a lot of that happens, like to the tune of millions of tokens, like I don't know how many per month are used for summoning and hatching eggs and dueling. There's duels, there's different things in the game. Those are being burned at high rates too.
00:24:53.162 - 00:25:39.286, Speaker A: So this is where Defi has problems with sustaining itself, because the earning token that you're getting from the yield, farming, where's the demand? You got to have heavy buy pressure to make it sustainable, otherwise they all die. All the Defi platforms die. Well, with gaming, when you're earning the power token, that has high demand, that's the only way it can really sustain. And I know there's innovative stuff happening though, like pancake swap. They're trying to, always trying to find more utility for the cake token, for example. But I haven't seen like how sustainable is that going to be, really. Maybe they figured out, and if it's really bullish, there has to be demand for that earning token.
00:25:39.286 - 00:26:13.730, Speaker A: And so that's where gaming paired with Defi is brilliant. But when you say you're worried about Roblox and that's the competition, it's Roblox and call of Duty and whatever, all these big games, well, to me it's like low hanging fruit. People are going to realize I'm not making any money. I can do the same thing and make money doing it potentially, right. It's like a no brainer. It's like it's going to happen. I believe web three gaming will overtake gaming as we know it.
00:26:13.730 - 00:26:21.960, Speaker A: Will it happen in two or three years? I don't know. Will it happen in ten years? Maybe. Will it happen?
00:26:23.210 - 00:27:07.942, Speaker B: The future is definitely bright. I think we're a little far further away from it competing, but I think we can compete in other levels, right? Maybe not necessarily from a graphics or storyline, but I think there are some other areas where we can attack. It's almost like a battle, right? It's almost like a battle. And I think that there are some areas where we could absolutely win. And I also say that all the things that you mentioned that make Defi kingdoms and some of these games really successful, I think having a conversation doesn't really quite do it justice. I think people need to actually watch you play it and they need to go check out your channel. So why don't you give us some parting thoughts about your channel and all the things that you're working on.
00:27:07.942 - 00:27:13.480, Speaker B: So that way we can have people get more educated about everything.
00:27:14.570 - 00:27:33.406, Speaker A: I'm so inundated into the Defi kingdoms ecosystem and dragons crossing. Ecosystems which dragons crossing. They were defi kingdoms OGs. So it's like those two ecosystems are pretty close knit. So I do a lot of coverage on that, but I'm not trying to just be. I'm wanting to know. I have Scott with Wagney games on.
00:27:33.406 - 00:28:06.840, Speaker A: I'm excited about. I'm other projects out know. I'm trying to have interesting content for anybody to watch at any time and not be overly occasionally still, uh, just exclusive coverage, long videos, even sometimes on Defi kingdoms or on. But, you know, I want to get into a mode. Mr. George is trying to get it through my 6th goal here. It's, like, hard to do, but have consistent daily short videos that aren't too long.
00:28:06.840 - 00:28:37.746, Speaker A: 30 minutes or less usually is the goal where I still might cover the different games. But anybody can watch, even if you're not into gaming, and still be interested at possible speculative plays. Because at the end of the day, we're here. We are here for the tech, for sure. I mean, I'm 100% here for the tech, and I believe in it. But we want to find those gems, those awesome gains, and not with meme coins. It's just weird to me.
00:28:37.746 - 00:29:12.598, Speaker A: But with phenomenal projects and innovation and technology, we want to find that ahead of time and be front runners and get in there on those good projects with good teams and good solid core values. So that's my main push of the channel, is finding those good teams, those good projects, whether it's gaming or not. It's got a gaming focus, for sure, my channel, but defi gaming, crypto in general. We've got the guys from row CFI coming on next week. I'm really excited about that project. They're at DeFi, and you're welcome to come on and join if you know.
00:29:12.704 - 00:29:26.658, Speaker B: Yeah, I know Chris in the game. Yeah. I actually introduced them to George from Cryptos RS. That was you. What's interesting is they're all part of the network spotlight community, so it's funny how it all comes back full circle. Yeah, absolutely.
00:29:26.744 - 00:29:35.874, Speaker A: You want to come on the show? I think it's Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. Central is when we're doing.
00:29:36.072 - 00:29:38.046, Speaker B: All right, I'll be there, Brady.
00:29:38.158 - 00:29:43.622, Speaker A: Well, Brady, listen, I'd love to get all things east, too. What's his name? The defi guy?
00:29:43.676 - 00:29:53.562, Speaker B: Yes. Justin, I think. Justin, I'm not mistaken. I apologize if I'm terrible with names. I should probably know his name, but yeah. Really good guy, for sure.
00:29:53.696 - 00:29:54.042, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:54.096 - 00:30:17.166, Speaker B: Brady, it was a real pleasure getting your perspective. I need to be educated more on gaming, and that's why I hang out with people like you. And you're just an overall good dude, so I appreciate everything that you do for the community. Definitely. We'll make sure to link your YouTube channel in the description. And really excited to see what you're doing with George and crypto's RS plus channel. Thanks so much for coming on.
00:30:17.166 - 00:30:18.250, Speaker B: It was a real pleasure.
00:30:18.410 - 00:30:20.460, Speaker A: I love you, man. Take care.
