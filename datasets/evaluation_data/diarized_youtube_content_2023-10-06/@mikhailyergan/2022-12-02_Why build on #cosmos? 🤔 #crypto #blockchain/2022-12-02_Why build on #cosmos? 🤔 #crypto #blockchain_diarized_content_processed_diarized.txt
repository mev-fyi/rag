00:00:00.250 - 00:00:38.070, Speaker A: The philosophy of Cosmos is completely open and probably that it takes more time, that it's less efficient. But it's very, very interesting to have something very decentralized, to have a community wide open. It's something very important for us and it's a deep value in OKP four. It's in our name, open knowledge protocol for everything and everyone. So, I mean, we have to choose the more open ecosystem, and Cosmos was completely dedicated to that. So it's something very important.
