00:00:00.170 - 00:00:32.806, Speaker A: Mikhaili here hanging out with Daniel, the security expert. Daniel, there's a lot going on right now. Defi is under attack. Curve finance. There's some meme coin that got exploited, and then of course there's the world coin that is not an exploit, but there's definitely polarizing opinions about what's happening on that side. So let's start with curve finance. This exploit, I want to say like 65 million.
00:00:32.806 - 00:00:51.280, Speaker A: I think last time I saw the liquidity got drained, 50% is what I saw. So clearly this is a huge problem, and it all has to do with Viper. What exactly is Viper and what can we do to keep it in mind for the future?
00:00:52.930 - 00:01:48.954, Speaker B: Viper is a programming language used to write smart contracts, similar to solidity, which I think most people are familiar with. Right. And I think the interesting thing is that with the language also comes a compiler. When you use solidity to write a smart contract on ethereum, you would use a solidity compiler. When you use Viper to write a smart contract on Ethereum, you would use a Viper compiler to turn it into opcode and then the virtual machine can read it, blah blah blah. And actually like this whole curve finance thing, the vulnerability was in certain versions of the Viper compiler, so smart contracts that were compiled with these versions had a bug, and this bug was exploited. And the curve finance code that made curve liquidity pools happened to be unfortunately vulnerable to this bug.
00:01:48.954 - 00:01:51.790, Speaker B: And this is how all the shenanigans occurred.
00:01:53.490 - 00:02:17.590, Speaker A: Okay, so I've never heard of Viper language. It sounds like this is EVM compatible. You said instead of writing it in solidity, which is the primary language that I'm familiar with, people are writing smart contracts in Viper. First of all, why was Viper even created? What can it do that you can't necessarily do in solidity?
00:02:19.470 - 00:02:51.342, Speaker B: Why are any programming languages created? I think it's just a matter of preference. So like solidity was mimicked after a language I think is the bane of all existence, JavaScript. Right? It's an awful language that I don't want to go into, but it's awful to me. That's a very polarizing opinion of itself. I'm sure I'm going to get flamed a lot. So Viper was created because that more mirrors Python, and so there's always this Python versus JavaScript thing going on. I'm more pythonic.
00:02:51.342 - 00:03:22.330, Speaker B: So people like Viper because it feels more like Python. At the end of the day, you're right, the compiler compiles everything into EVM compatible opcode. So it's just like if you like that certain syntax, you prefer it, it's more intuitive for you, you would use it. Viper is definitely not the majority of. It's not the majority language used. Most people use solidity. I think Viper represents, I want to say, 5% of all the code out there on ETH.
00:03:23.390 - 00:03:40.740, Speaker A: Yeah. Working in security, I get access to a lot of different githubs, and I have never heard of Viper, but apparently this compiler on curve curve is very popular on Ethereum, and so.
00:03:42.550 - 00:03:42.994, Speaker B: It was.
00:03:43.032 - 00:04:19.630, Speaker A: Brand new to me. But what you mentioned about solidity is something that I hear quite a bit from a lot of engineers, and for that reason, I think many of them prefer rust over solidity. And they say that anybody that is building in solidity, it's more of a business decision than it is a technical decision, because for whatever reason, again, I'm not an engineer, but rust makes more sense. So it sounds like people are trying to find other alternatives outside of solidity.
00:04:21.250 - 00:05:15.726, Speaker B: Yeah, solidity is kind of like, in my opinion, a yucky language. I don't know, but everyone's definition of yucky is different. Solidity has a lot of strange little keyword modifiers in every function definition. They have to be done in a certain order, and they all have their own different semantics. And maybe that works for some people's brains, but for me it's kind of like, look, I like code that is a lot clearer syntactically and reads more like, if somebody didn't even know how to code just by reading it, they'd get a decent sense of what it might do. I think that's a pretty successful kind of programming language where you sort of unburden the coder with a lot of engineering specific constraints. So solidity definitely doesn't do that.
00:05:15.726 - 00:05:20.210, Speaker B: So yeah, I would agree with most people who don't like it. I don't like it either. It's yucky.
00:05:20.790 - 00:05:31.990, Speaker A: So what do you think this means for other smart contracts that are built using Viper? I mean, should people just avoid it as a whole, or what do you think the feature holds for the language?
00:05:32.330 - 00:06:00.666, Speaker B: I don't think they should avoid it as a whole. I mean, yeah, there was a bug, right? And there was a bug in certain versions it was like 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0, right? And they're well beyond that version now. Do you lose all faith in the people developing the compiler because there was this one bug that happened? Probably not. If it occurs a lot, you might start questioning the team and being like, yeah, man, I can't trust that compiler anymore.
00:06:00.666 - 00:06:14.660, Speaker B: So I can't even believe that the stuff you say these certain functions do or certain modifiers do, I can't even believe it. If you get to that point, then yes, you drop it. But I think at this point it's all right. Right?
00:06:15.830 - 00:06:24.280, Speaker A: So this exploit, at the end of the day, as of right now, who are we putting the blame on? Who do we hold accountable for this?
00:06:24.810 - 00:07:05.300, Speaker B: That's interesting. That is actually an interesting question. I think I have a take of who you might want to blame. Well, there is some clamor on the Internet, so obviously I don't think you would say it's curve's fault because curve was relying on. So the vulnerability was inside of a reentrancy guard modifier that was built into the compiler or like the language. So you just trust the language. So you could blame the viper team for putting this bug in, in a crucial modifying capability in their language, right? You could blame them for that.
00:07:05.300 - 00:08:10.154, Speaker B: But I mean, that kind of stuff happens and I don't know what to say. If a company gets hacked, right, because of some software, a lot of times you can't blame the software company for the company's damages, right? It's just not done normally. One thing I saw is a lot of people are actually blaming certain security company for tweeting out this vulnerability before it was fully understood and fully addressed, right. And so I don't know if you saw that, but yeah, people were clapping at blocksec for doing it because blocksec had put out like, oh, there's this vulnerability, oh my God. And then blocksec seemed to embrace it. And even though this viral tweet that was like, you never tweet out vulnerabilities until they're remediated, right? They retweeted that just to double down and be like, yeah, I don't care, I'm going to tweet out vulnerabilities when I want. So some people are blaming blocksec for it, and there's an argument to be made for that.
00:08:10.154 - 00:08:45.090, Speaker B: Because what you saw was after the first victim got wrecked, an hour, 2 hours went by, and then you saw other people get hacked by this exact same thing, right? I think it was like jpegged first and then like an hour or more, an hour plus went by and then you saw alchemyx become victim to it. So there is something to be said for when there is a live vulnerability that's affecting many projects, you might not want to go public with it before you found a solution and protected the victims.
00:08:45.990 - 00:09:04.874, Speaker A: Yeah. And not to defend blocksec, but I will say just the auditing space. It's so competitive that the way that you build trust with the communities is being the first responder. Right. Being the first one on the scene. And there's a fine line there. Right.
00:09:04.874 - 00:09:19.280, Speaker A: Because you want to make sure you have all the right information when you're doing so. And that's kind of the risk that you take when you try to be first one on the scene to provide that kind of information.
00:09:20.050 - 00:10:09.642, Speaker B: Yeah, I get what you mean. It's a tough spot. I know in the traditional, in the non web3 world, a lot of these sort of security hunters, they have a policy which is like some kind of window. I know Google, Project Zero, they're constantly looking for vulnerabilities in code. They have some kind of policy, I forget how many days, but they give you either 30 days or 90 days where they'll privately disclose it to the company that has the bug and wait for the bug to develop a patch. But if you pass your deadline, they will out you publicly and just be like, yeah, there's a huge vulnerability in this widely distributed software, so everybody just run for your lives. So they kind of try to strike a balance.
00:10:09.642 - 00:10:45.610, Speaker B: I think eventually that'll be the case here too. Actually, given the amount of money that's at stake in web3 and DFI, I feel like it's even maybe more of a consideration to do something like that because we're talking like millions of dollars. It's a lot of money. Versus if there's a piece of software that's out there that's not controlling anyone's finances and they get compromised. Yes, there's a problem there, but it's arguably not as financially damaging.
00:10:47.070 - 00:11:13.300, Speaker A: Going back to your point about holding entities, companies, projects, whatever, responsible for this specific exploit. If we are to put the blame on, say, Viper, in their defense, is there a third party auditor that would audit language? Does it work that way? The same way third party auditor would audit a project?
00:11:15.050 - 00:12:02.526, Speaker B: There's no reason why they couldn't. Our last episode, we talked about the difference between an audit and, what do we call it? Security check, something like that. Security review, right. Yeah. There's no reason why you couldn't hire a security team to do a security review on your compiler or even do a pen test on your compiler, like some kind of large fuzzing campaign against your compiler or whatever, right. So yeah, it could definitely be done. It isn't done normally now, which is interesting because the compiler is an extremely crucial piece of software, as this incident has demonstrated.
00:12:02.526 - 00:12:23.126, Speaker B: Like imagine if you found some huge bug in solidity compiler, and now all these solidity based contracts are vulnerable. That would be like Armageddon for Defi. So, yeah, definitely. I think they should do everything they can to make sure that their code is secure.
00:12:23.318 - 00:12:40.350, Speaker A: Why do you think they hesitate? I have my opinions, and I think it has to do with the fact that no one's going to know this language better than me. So you're going to come in here, I'm going to pay you to audit this, but I also have to teach you about this language.
00:12:41.650 - 00:13:03.094, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good question. I can't really answer that. I think your hypothesis might be a good one. I think a lot of people do have this kind of hubris, which is sad, but I understand. You're like, this is my baby, I'm a tech guy, I know what I'm doing here. You're not a better coder than me. Right.
00:13:03.094 - 00:13:48.018, Speaker B: There's a lot of pride involved. So I think that with that kind of pride, people are reluctant and they don't want to spend money on something when they think they're the most intimate and familiar and they're the best at it. But that assumption has been proven wrong infinity times in the Internet world, right, since the Internet existed. And so I think people need to get away from that. I think the one semi good thing that happened in web3, and there's not, in my opinion, a lot of good things that happened in web3. One semi good thing that happened in web3 security, is there became sort of this pressure for smart contracts to undergo a security review. Right.
00:13:48.018 - 00:14:18.000, Speaker B: Where if they're not, they're kind of looked upon as being maybe not safe. And I actually think that's a good thing. And I think with the compiler stuff, you don't have that kind of pressure. Is anyone complaining that the solidity compiler has not been reviewed, the code has not been reviewed by 5 million organizations? No. But maybe that'll change with this Viper thing, although I doubt it. I think if it happens a few more times, yes, something will change, but it's going to need to happen at least one or two more times.
00:14:20.130 - 00:14:44.134, Speaker A: Potentially. Yeah, we'll definitely have to keep a close eye on that. And what happens. There was a white hat hacker that I think was able to retrieve about 5.4 million. So if there's anything that's positive, it's the fact that there are a lot of good people out there that are trying to fight the good fight. So we'll see what happens on that side.
00:14:44.134 - 00:15:19.780, Speaker A: Kind of transitioning a little bit. Something that is not necessarily an exploit, but has been a very hot topic lately is this project called Worldcoin. And it's been very polarizing. There's been a lot of great excitement and enthusiasm around it, but then there's also a lot of concerns around privacy, around scanning your eyeball. Essentially, it's like living in the future. Have you read up on Worldcoin and know much about.
00:15:21.190 - 00:16:04.340, Speaker B: I know, I know about the. Like, it's gotten a lot of buzz because it's Sam Altman's project and chat GPT has gotten so much buzz. So anything Sam Altman does next, which is worldcoin, is going to get a lot of buz. So, yeah, I know about it. It's basically like they use your iris to check if you're like this unique person. I think the TLDR of it is they are forcing you to do an iris scan to create a kind of account. And the idea is this raises the bar for account creation, right? Like when you're making accounts for the blockchain, there is no limit to the amount of accounts you can make.
00:16:04.340 - 00:16:21.270, Speaker B: There's nothing stopping me from making 1 million accounts, 1 million wallets. But I think the whole concept behind worldcoin is you are forcing someone to do an iris scan. So if you want to make 1 million accounts, you need 1 million pairs of eyeballs.
00:16:23.370 - 00:16:29.080, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay. What's the issue with having multiple accounts? Why would they want to limit you?
00:16:31.790 - 00:17:33.102, Speaker B: A lot of people believe erroneously. Well, I guess right now, when you see two accounts, you don't have any idea if this is one person or if this is two different independent parties, right? And you can try to guess by looking at their transaction history or whatever their behavior, but at the end of the day, you aren't totally sure. And this uncertainty creates a bit of a problem and limitation to innovation on blockchain. So if you cannot know that 1 million accounts represents 1 million unique people, then you couldn't do like a one to one vote where one account gets one vote, and that's like a fair election if you cared about different people's opinions, right? Because one guy could just make a million accounts and have a million votes. So that's the problem, right? There's always this talk about a civil attack. That's like a term that people use. And a civil attack is exactly that.
00:17:33.102 - 00:18:00.774, Speaker B: Somebody masquerading is like 5 billion accounts. To get 5 billion voices when it's really, just one voice. And because you cannot be sure that these people are unique, there's a lot of things you just can't do. Like dows. Right? Dows might have votes, but they vote based on how many coins you have. That isn't super fair. They might like to have votes based on just one person, one vote, but they just can't do that right now.
00:18:00.774 - 00:18:07.000, Speaker B: So worldcoin is hoping to take the first steps towards enabling something like that.
00:18:08.350 - 00:18:37.250, Speaker A: And of course, with that and scanning your eyeball, there's some privacy concerns that people have. So my next question is around preserving that privacy. And can they go through rigorous auditing and testing to make sure that they hold to the highest standards when it comes to privacy? Could you see Worldcoin becoming soc two compliant? Is that realistic?
00:18:38.870 - 00:19:14.154, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe. Sure, I could see that, but I don't know if they're going to. I know that with Worldcoin, there actually is a thing where they can store your iris image in their database. You can opt out of it, but you can also opt into it. So their plan right now, as far as I understand, is they are going to store a lot of people's iris images on their database. The volunteers that hopefully know they're volunteering, but maybe just check off a term and condition don't really know what they're signing up for. Right.
00:19:14.154 - 00:19:30.580, Speaker B: Like how many people read all the terms and conditions when they're agreeing to something? I bet you there's at least a few people, probably a lot more than a few, that have signed up to store their iris image in a database without knowing it.
00:19:31.590 - 00:20:01.110, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we learned from TikTok that a lot of people just opt into all the terms and conditions. Don't take the time to read those things. But I don't know. People in crypto are a little different, and so it will be interesting to see the success that worldcoin has with that in mind. And in terms of sovereignty, privacy, those tend to be a lot more important for those folks that are dabbling in web3. So we'll have to.
00:20:01.280 - 00:20:41.820, Speaker B: I think people in crypto are kind of, like, super paranoid about giving up any type of PIi. And I get it. I also don't get it. You know what I mean? I get it, but I also don't get it, because I think if you use the Internet, if you have a smartphone, you've lost that battle for privacy long ago. That battle has been lost if you're using a smartphone now in the traditional web, the battle has been lost. Now it's wonderful to have a dream that one day you're going to have a new Internet, and this new Internet is going to do so much better protecting people's data and everything. Cool.
00:20:41.820 - 00:21:01.550, Speaker B: But I guess what I'm trying to say is that day is not today. And I don't think people need to be freaked out about their iris images being saved somewhere if they have the gall to have a smartphone in their pocket.
00:21:03.330 - 00:21:50.990, Speaker A: Well, to be fair, I think there are some settings that you can create within, say, your iPhone if you do a deep dive into all of the things that we're given up in terms of privacy. There's a lot if you're signing up for just the standard iPhone, but there's a lot of content out there around setting up your phone where you are able to preserve your privacy. So a world of choices, there will always be choices and ways for you to opt out of those things that tend to hinder our privacy. So I think there will always be options, and because of that, there will always be people that are going to be against giving up and sacrificing their privacy.
00:21:51.490 - 00:23:14.970, Speaker B: I think my problem with that is you're right, there is an option of preserving your privacy, but it comes with an unrealistic amount of inconvenience, you know, so there is nothing technologically stopping us from being able to conveniently to give people the convenience of being always signed into their services without compromising their privacy in a way that they may not like. But that's just not a choice, right? That's not a choice. They're like, okay, you know what? You can stay signed out of all your accounts and, yeah, that'll be a lot more private. You could do private browsing and stuff and stay signed off to all your accounts, or you can be signed on, not have to type passwords every time you want to use something and all of that, and clear your cookie cache and all of that. But we're going to completely track your browsing history and curate all your news to make your life an echo chamber and just brainwash you to no end and make you this extreme person so that we can make our ads a little bit more impactful to your brain. I feel like that part, I don't like those choices. To me, that's not freedom.
00:23:14.970 - 00:23:29.534, Speaker B: I want the choice where I don't have to spend all my 24 hours typing passwords, and I also would like to not be brainwashed. So I'm waiting for that day, but I don't know if that day is going to come yet.
00:23:29.732 - 00:23:32.618, Speaker A: We pay for convenience. I think that's the bottom line.
00:23:32.804 - 00:24:07.290, Speaker B: Until we've completely thrown away the traditional Internet, I feel like that battle for privacy is already lost. So giving up my eyeballs right now. People's personal data has been stolen. I can't count how many times. And I don't know if you know this, but there was this database of lots of people's super valuable security investigation information that allegedly was stolen. And that stuff has everything about you. Forget about your eyeball.
00:24:07.290 - 00:24:17.646, Speaker B: What did you say to your neighbor, like, ten years ago? And so if they already have that information out there, what am I worried about? If people took a picture of my.
00:24:17.668 - 00:25:02.430, Speaker A: Eye, I think, yes, you're right. There will always be risks around your privacy. But the more information that we put in the hands of other individuals, the more likelihood that something's to go wrong. Social Security number, fingerprint, and now eyeballs. There's so many things you have to be on the lookout for, and consider that it just increases the risk, the overall risk. So that's my two cent on that. I think I need to do a little bit more research on worldcoin, but that's just my initial instinct that I'm not sure I would be comfortable using that.
00:25:02.430 - 00:25:24.260, Speaker A: I mean, with Chad, GPT, it's the same thing. You're typing in information that is very personal. Right. Even if it's as simple as, hey, you are a wedding planner. Help me plan for my wedding. What do I need to know? Well, you just gave up some information about what you have going on in your personal life, so things that we don't necessarily pay attention to, like we're doing every day.
00:25:25.690 - 00:25:59.760, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you're right. And you're totally right about more information, more danger. Totally true. I guess maybe I'm thinking there's already so much information that at some point, there's a rate of diminishing returns on how much more I can give you. You've already got enough to clone me completely and masquerade as me and convince anybody that you're me. So if we're already at that point, giving you an eye picture is just, okay, just throw that on top of a giant pile of Pii that's already been out.
00:26:01.410 - 00:26:45.034, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see what the public reaction is. I mean, so far, like I said, it's been mostly positive, but transitioning a little bit. Daniel, the third topic that I want to cover with you has to do with something that's a little personal to me, which is baldcoin. They just. I believe rug pulled on base, which is a chain derived from Coinbase. And to me, I don't know if there's much to cover from a technical perspective, because it's been rug pulled. We talk about the importance of audits, the importance of KYC, all those things, but more about the implications on the branding of base and Coinbase.
00:26:45.034 - 00:27:08.230, Speaker A: Coinbase has a specific reputation in the space. We're all pooling for them to defeat the SEC, and they're kind of the good guys in the space. The most buttoned up brand that you can think of in crypto to have this exploit. What do you think that it does to the reputation of base and Coinbase?
00:27:08.730 - 00:28:09.670, Speaker B: It does not help the reputation in terms of, I don't know what you call it, a layman user or uninformed user, a retail user of web3. I think if you ask a complete normie that doesn't know about web3 or crypto very much, they've never heard of bald or base. Right? And then you've got some people that are sort of just like users of crypto that have been dabbling in investments, like regular people who aren't super technical. They've heard of maybe bald and base. And for those people, yes, they're going to seriously question, like, man, is Coinbase a bunch of jokers or whatever, right? But for people who are really informed, I mean, it was a rug pull. What do you want me to say? I don't think Coinbase ever promised that base was going to be different from any other l two. And an l two chain just hosts projects.
00:28:09.670 - 00:28:51.270, Speaker B: And if they're going to host projects without prejudice, then, yes, scam projects will be able to be launched on the chain. And it is what it is right now. Defi is this completely unprotected, just wild, wild west of software that handles money. So another rug pool. Big surprise. We've learned for the billions time now in Defi that humans can be greedy and if you let them get away with it, they might steal a few million dollars. Shocking.
00:28:51.270 - 00:28:56.520, Speaker B: I don't know what to say. I could have told you that way before bitcoin was ever.
00:28:57.690 - 00:30:14.000, Speaker A: I mean, and again, it's another exploit. But I think the bigger story here is the implications on Coinbase. And look, regardless, people are going to forget about it. But something to keep in mind is that a lot of these chains, l two s, that have a lot of buzz around them, especially in the very beginning stages, there tends to be a lot of malicious people that are building on top of it, wanting to take advantage of the fact that there is a lot of buzz, we've seen it with zk sync and we're now seeing it with base. I don't know if this is going to be a trend, but I think the reason why it made the news not to downplay exploits, those are always worth monitoring and talking about. But I think the bigger story here is what it means for base and what it means for Coinbase having these types of exploits, they have to have some type of influence on the branding, but people have a very short memory in the space as well. So that's the other side of the coin that a lot of people forgive and forget, and we'll see if this becomes a trend, but something to watch out for moving forward.
00:30:14.530 - 00:31:01.374, Speaker B: I mean, I think these are lessons. This is just one part of a hard lesson that I think web3 is learning, which I think is a good lesson, which is like, if you're going to be completely free, this is the kind of stuff that's going to happen, right? And people are like, oh, yeah, full freedom, all the capabilities, all the convenience, all the limitless opportunities for anybody under the sun. And yes, you're going to get scammers. So I think, what are you going to do about it, right? I think Coinbase could take the centralized view of reviewing every project that gets deployed on their chain. Couple problems there. One, extremely centralized. The whole community will hate them.
00:31:01.374 - 00:31:51.050, Speaker B: Two, it doesn't scale. Right? So really, maybe the answer is that these blockchains need to build some kind of security mechanism that seems fair into their chain, into their ecosystem somehow. What would that look like? No idea. Right. Maybe what you do is you create, like, I mean, these are like the dumbest ideas because I'm just thinking of them off the dome, right? But you create an oligarchy of security researchers that have to vote, that have to review and then vote for approval of a project before it gets actually deployed. There's a little bit of centralization there, but it's not fully centralized under one authoritative rule. There could be things like that, and maybe that's what you need to start requiring.
00:31:51.050 - 00:32:33.280, Speaker B: Maybe that is the kind of regulation that is needed. If you don't want the government regulating you, maybe you need to regulate yourselves. And maybe you need to create a regulatory body that does that. And that regulatory body should be as decentralized as possible, but it can never be fully decentralized, because just not everyone in the universe is a security expert. So maybe that's something that people need to start considering. Maybe that's what is going to win the L two wars, right? There's so many l two chains out there. Maybe the l two chain that actually builds in these kind of interesting features can somehow stand out amongst all the l two s out there.
00:32:34.290 - 00:32:52.210, Speaker A: I know that base is its own separate entity. It's not technically affiliated with the actual exchange. I just hope that the SEC doesn't use this. If this doesn't add just fuel to the fire in terms of their accusations against Coinbase.
00:32:53.830 - 00:33:17.126, Speaker B: Well, as far as I can tell, the SEC. I don't know if it's the SEC, but Gary Gensler doesn't seem like he has a. He seems extremely biased. So I think he'll use whatever he can to get what he wants. And I don't read his mind, I'm not him. So I don't know what his agenda is, but everything he's done so far doesn't look like he's looking for the truth. It looks like he has some kind of agenda.
00:33:17.126 - 00:33:29.120, Speaker B: I just don't know what exactly it is. So whether he's going to use this, it could. I think he could very well use it if he wants to, if he thinks it suits whatever purpose he's trying to drive towards.
00:33:30.210 - 00:33:32.320, Speaker A: Daniel, where can people find you online?
00:33:33.730 - 00:33:42.640, Speaker B: You can find me on Twitter. It's genster one one two. Jenster one one two. And my DMs are open for anyone and everyone.
00:33:43.570 - 00:33:48.038, Speaker A: Awesome. Always appreciate the feedback and the insight. It's great to have you.
00:33:48.204 - 00:33:48.740, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks.
