00:00:00.560 - 00:00:44.619, Speaker A: Now we reached the point of the conversation. Mike, that is my favorite part, which you come to me every episode with three different projects that have gone through series of funding. And today we're gonna start with, at the time of this recording, looks like bitcoin is currently at 67,000. But at one point we did touch 73,000 and came back down. And a lot of that is due to some of the uncertainty of the elections. Although the poly markets is saying that Trump is, there's a 60% chance of him winning, the reality is we still don't know and some of that uncertainty is being played into the actual market. So to discuss what's going to happen with bitcoin post elections and with the rest of the crypto market, I'm joined by Mike.
00:00:44.619 - 00:01:06.293, Speaker A: Together we are Mick and Mike. So we're going to go over what's going to happen on the crypto side. We're going to go over the funding rounds as always. And a little bit of news. Maybe Kraken is following Coinbase's footsteps. So with all that said, Mike, what are your thoughts about the market? Let's first say if Trump wins, right, and then we'll have another scenario if Kamala wins.
00:01:06.389 - 00:01:58.825, Speaker B: All right, this is my short term and long term prediction under both of those scenarios, right? So if Trump wins, I think you're going to see like a massive, massive jump in price in bitcoin and a lot of bitcoin. First it's going to, you know, it's going to, it's going to take a nice jump. But then I think I've said before that both candidates are going to gravitate towards the middle where Trump has made all these promises, right? He's made all these promises to have like a bitcoin reserve on the government's balance sheet. And you know, he's doing this world, world liberty and you know, he's getting very involved. He made all these great promises. So I think bitcoin's going to take that short term bump. But over time I see a lot of the promises that he made not coming to fruition.
00:01:58.825 - 00:02:38.245, Speaker B: So I think as that happens, the price will kind of normalize a little bit. All right, that's, that's my, that's my take now with Kamala, Kamala wins. I think we see in the short term people are going to be a bit more bearish. The price is going to drop. The price of bitcoin is going to drop down a little bit due to that bearishness. But I think that over the Long term, we, we're going to see that she's going to certainly be friendlier to crypto than the current administration. And, you know, Gary Gensler is going to be done and we're going to have more education.
00:02:38.245 - 00:02:57.845, Speaker B: I think a crypto friendlier SEC commissioner, and then it'll eventually recover. So now net Net, I don't know. Net Net. I still think probably Trump, a Trump win is going to be better for crypto, but that's how I see it kind of diverging and then normalizing towards the middle.
00:02:58.305 - 00:03:42.665, Speaker A: I think that I'm not 100% sure that Trump will be able to hold all those promises. I hope he can. But I do think that in both instances, there is going to be an overreaction in one way or another. In the short term, I do think that for, like, the altcoin market, that Trump is more likely. I think he's better. Just because it appears as though the Republicans tend to be a little bit more like hands off from a regulatory perspective. Not to say that they're not going to, you know, focus on regulation, but I think that Bitcoin Ethereum will do better than the rest of the market under a Kamala administration.
00:03:42.665 - 00:04:12.843, Speaker A: And I think under a Trump administration, I think Bitcoin Ethereum could do just as well. But then you can, you could probably also add the altcoin market. So I think the biggest difference here is whether or not the altcoins are going to be successful or not. And I think a lot of that depends on what's going to happen, whether it's Trump or Kamala. But what's interesting that you just said was that you think that Gary Gensler would be gone under a Kamala Harris administration.
00:04:13.019 - 00:04:49.265, Speaker B: 100%. 100% under either administration. Right. There's no doubt he's gone obviously under Trump, but I think he's absolutely gone under a Kamala. And I think that will be very bullish. I think, just in general, I don't know who's kind of playing marionette behind the scenes, but he's obviously public enemy number one for crypto. And yeah, I feel extremely confident he is absolutely gone under both administrations.
00:04:49.975 - 00:04:56.035, Speaker A: Well, I know you're in the D.C. area, so maybe there's something, you know, that the rest of us don't.
00:04:57.615 - 00:05:04.595, Speaker B: No, I don't. There's no, no insider information here. Just, just a strong feeling about that.
00:05:05.255 - 00:05:38.559, Speaker A: Well, you know who else has a strong feeling? That is definitely Michael Saylor of Microstrategy. He doesn't care what direction, like who's in the White House what direction Bitcoin's going. He is buying regardless and looks like he's raising $42 billion to buy more bitcoin. I mean at some point you got to wonder what exactly is motivating him here. He just keeps buying and buying Bitcoin and it's almost like a race between MicroStrategy and BlackRock at this point.
00:05:38.647 - 00:05:46.007, Speaker B: Yeah. Who's the better ETF, right? There's a good argument there. Right. MicroStrategy is actually an ETF.
00:05:46.071 - 00:06:30.675, Speaker A: So yeah, people buy micro strategy to essentially have a more aggressive portfolio like playing into the whole bitcoin narrative. And along those lines, if you dive deeper into the web3 world again people don't really pay too much attention to what's happening in the elections. You're seeing moves like these, which you have to be bullish regardless. So Stripe's $1.1 billion acquisition target Bridge buys Web3 wallet platform Triangle and from what I see here Mike is that you're essentially are able to create your own stablecoin and use it for like pretty much any project is. Am I understanding this correctly?
00:06:31.455 - 00:07:18.841, Speaker B: So Bridge, it essentially allows like anyone to integrate stablecoin capabilities into their products. Right. It also allows them to issue their, their own stable coins. But I think the key thing is like, is kind of like how Stripe was able to really streamline the process of integrating kind of any payments into your app or E commerce site. Bridge allows anyone to do that with stablecoins with those, with those crypto rails into their product. So obviously accepting payments is the biggest use case there. So it's just a perfect really marriage with Stripe and if you take it just proves that a couple of things.
00:07:18.841 - 00:07:53.076, Speaker B: One, Stable Coins is the killer use case for crypto right now. Right. It's not sexy. It's not like crypto and AI like crazy shit being built. It is just this thing that people need to send money to each other to give access to stable currency across the world. Cross border payments. So massive, you know, massive use case, massive market and it, you know, the bridge, Bridge was only around for two and a half years before they got bought by Stripe for $1.1
00:07:53.076 - 00:08:21.719, Speaker B: billion. You know that's pretty awesome though. You know, it's the largest crypto acquisition to date and just kind of goes to show that you know, and this, you know, Stripe used to Stripe dabbled in crypto a little bit and then they backed off. Didn't, didn't really see, they didn't really see the value and now they Just went huge into crypto. So when you have, you know, one of the largest, you know, private companies that. And payment processors in the world and are picking up a crypto company, you know, that's a. That's a pretty big deal.
00:08:21.719 - 00:08:23.155, Speaker B: That's. That's huge for our industry.
00:08:23.855 - 00:09:06.341, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I imagine with Stripe getting on board, I mean, it's just another way for us to onboard new users. Right. The traditional Web2 users. And I think something else that is also interesting in terms of onboarding new users is, you know, I saw this that came through is that Kraken chooses Optimism for its new Layer 2 network. And for those that don't know, Base is also utilizing optimism. And so we, we talked about this before, Mike, that the OP stack seems to be very enticing for a lot of these exchanges that are trying to build out their way or twos. But it looks like they're following Coinbase's footsteps.
00:09:06.341 - 00:09:07.597, Speaker A: Kraken is.
00:09:07.781 - 00:09:36.353, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a few layers to the story that are pretty interesting. One, we talked a little bit about kind of every DAP or popular DAP or application or exchange having their own L2. Right. You see a lot of, you know, even centralized or decentralized. Right. You talked about Coinbase with Base cracking with Inc. Yeah, I think some of the.
00:09:36.353 - 00:10:43.093, Speaker B: Some of the other centralized exchanges, you know, obviously finance had B and has been B chain and, you know, those L1s, but, you know, and Uniswap has uni chain. So you've got this, like, everyone wants to kind of own their own stack. And, you know, I think that's a movement that we're going to continue to see just people, just these popular apps will just be able to control fees, be able to onboard new people. And I think that's definitely a good thing. Another kind of interesting fact of this was that the Optimism foundation actually paid a ton of OP or dedicated a ton of OP tokens to Kraken for building on their chain. So it was 25 million OP tokens they allocated to this, I think, earlier. They originally signed a deal earlier this year, and I think they were worth like $100 million earlier, but more recently it was like 42.5
00:10:43.093 - 00:11:13.327, Speaker B: million. So it's this kind of like. Yeah, we talked about, you talked about like op, you know, optimism, getting a ton of traction and getting a lot of people to build on their chain. Are they paying people to build on their chain? You know, it's there. There's obviously a value there. Right. Because they will get sequencer Fees from these other L2s, and I don't know what the number, the amount that base has, has paid them, but, you know, base is like printing money.
00:11:13.327 - 00:11:30.565, Speaker B: So. So optimism is getting a piece of that. So there's obviously value there. But, yeah, you know, like, that's. The grants will get paid out over time. So it's not just 25 million op tokens, like, handed over. But, you know, that's a pay to play kind of interesting strategy there.
00:11:30.565 - 00:12:11.005, Speaker B: So, yeah, you know, and another layer to it is that, you know, Polygon was paying a lot of, like, traditional companies, like I think like DraftKings and Disney and Starbucks and Nike to do these kind of partnerships. And the chief growth officer at Polygon was cutting these deals, and he's now the chief growth officer at op. So bringing that strategy, that pay to pay strategy over from Polygon to optimism is kind of interesting. Another layer to the story.
00:12:11.435 - 00:12:39.773, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, I love seeing these partnership announcements when there's, like, traditional companies jumping in. You know, we all get excited, right? Us that work in crypto, that, you know, invest in crypto, we get all excited. But I have yet to see anything that actually has, like, tangible traction, like when you go out into the real world to actually, like, see it play out. I have yet to see that. And that's. I don't know, I wonder sometimes why that's the case.
00:12:39.773 - 00:13:09.979, Speaker A: I don't want to make any assumptions that it's just all for the marketing and there's really no utility behind it. But, you know, I know, like the Starbucks program, I believe that was canceled. I don't know if that had any legs. A lot of people got excited about that when. When Polygon and Starbucks partnered up. But, you know, I don't want to. I don't want to beat down Polygon because they've had it rough, this market, and I still think that they can make a turnaround.
00:13:09.979 - 00:13:15.655, Speaker A: And I'm just saying I would love to see some of these partnerships actually play out in real life.
00:13:16.795 - 00:13:47.625, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I agree with you. I don't think anything came out of those. Right. Maybe they're still working on it behind the scenes, but I think it was just a big marketing. Marketing push there that nothing has come to fruition, at least not yet. So. But, you know, I mean, long term, you know, I'm a firm believer that, you know, blockchain will be kind of in the background for every application in, you know, maybe sometimes the user won't even know that blockchain is powering the application.
00:13:47.625 - 00:14:09.727, Speaker B: That they're using. So you know, that's, that's kind of the long term vision. But certain, and certainly these, these partnerships are, you know, with, with Web two companies are a positive move towards that. But yeah, so far it hasn't seemed like any real progress has made to realizing that vision. It's mostly just been just kind of marketing ploy.
00:14:09.791 - 00:14:41.107, Speaker A: There is some bad news to share. Some of it is just bad news and some of it is a little bit of drama. I'll start with the bad news is DYDX consensus. They've been going through some layoffs lately and it's kind of strange in terms of the timing of it all because it's end of 2024. You know, we talked about October and now we're in November and before you know it, it's 2025. And that's really when the market goes up. We're in this, if you believe in the whole like four year cycle.
00:14:41.107 - 00:15:29.897, Speaker A: Right. And so it's kind of strange timing. Why some of this is happening with consensus I kind of understand because they're, they're under some legal scrutiny which, you know, maybe that'll subside a little bit once, you know, once we know who the president is. But you know, with dydx, I mean, I'm wondering if some of this is simply because we're entering a new phase of the market and the type of personnel that you need on your team is just, it's going to be different. You know, you're, you're maybe going away from the traditional engineers. If you're a Web3 project, right, and you're maybe wanting to focus more on business development, marketing, you know, you need to do more of that go to market strategy. So I'm wondering if this is just like a shifting of priorities versus oh, we're doing really bad, we need to lay off 35% of our people.
00:15:29.897 - 00:15:31.085, Speaker A: What are your thoughts?
00:15:31.825 - 00:16:23.539, Speaker B: Yeah, both happened on the same day too. So it's pretty interesting timing. But I think the big thing was at least on the DYDX side that was that their founder, Antonio Giuliano, he had left for I believe five or six months and then he recently returned to, to, to lead the company again. So yeah, I think he probably just saw and I think while he was away they actually had a pretty tough time. I think they lost a little bit of market share and I think, I think that, you know, he, he probably just saw some things that had changed over the last few months. You know, had a, had some time to take a Step back and just, just assess what. And realized that they needed to make some changes.
00:16:23.539 - 00:16:53.431, Speaker B: You know, there are no details on exactly like who got, who got laid off or what departments got hit the hardest. But yeah, there has to be. You know, there's just this. Maybe there was this just seeing, like you said, a kind of a new environment they need to operate in that the team didn't quite fit what he saw. The team needed to be moving forward. So. But yeah, you know, when you talk about consensus, they laid off 20% of their staff, which is pretty, pretty hefty.
00:16:53.431 - 00:17:25.016, Speaker B: I think it was almost 200 people. Again, don't know exactly who got, what departments got hit the hardest. But yeah, I think, I think a lot of those, those battles with fcc, I think they're suing the SEC to support the fact that ETH is not a security. And yeah, I mean, I think legal battles will always be tough on the budget. And it looks like they had to make a move to make sure that they had enough funds to fight that battle.
00:17:25.200 - 00:17:53.563, Speaker A: That's the frustrating part about crypto. Right. Because a lot of these companies that we're familiar with that are giants in web 3 are not giants relative to the traditional world. And so all they're doing is spending their money fighting legal battles. It's just not fair where, you know, at the end of it all they're like, oh, okay, yeah, we'll just go ahead and drop this case. Meanwhile, they spent millions of dollars just trying to fight this case. So it's, you know, it's definitely not fun for, for, for Web3.
00:17:53.563 - 00:17:54.891, Speaker A: The other part that.
00:17:55.003 - 00:18:43.555, Speaker B: Well, I think, I think kind of like the, probably, probably the analogy could be like when maybe when Uber was earlier on and they were kind of battling with like the taxi commissions. You know, I don't know how tell you exactly how large Uber was when they were started fighting these battles or Airbnb as well, you know, fighting with like the real estate, the real estate industry. So, like, I think you can kind of draw parallels there with like, look, we're building something really innovative and, you know, that ruffles some feathers. And yeah, you have to kind of keep in mind that you're going to fight some legal battles to provide your pathway to winning some of these markets.
00:18:44.095 - 00:19:15.733, Speaker A: Yeah. And something else that also is not a great look is you shared this with me and I was trying to follow along the story. This is the part where I said it's more dramatic. This is a very unique story that's coming out where I guess this is Hannah. And she was drugged by a partner at DWF Labs. And DWF Labs, for those that are not familiar, is they're a very reputable institution. They're a market maker.
00:19:15.733 - 00:19:30.925, Speaker A: They're a vc, if I'm not mistaken. So they are. They have a very strong reputation in Web3. So. And then this story comes out. Drop us the details, Mike. What's going on here?
00:19:32.465 - 00:20:18.159, Speaker B: Yeah, just, you know, going through the tweet thread and, you know, some other things that were mentioned on Twitter. Yeah. So a partner at DWF Labs pursued a Web2VC named Hannah, like, offering her a job opportunity. And I think, you know, she, she was a web2VC and she was interested in getting into crypto. So, you know, she entertained, entertain this, this guy and you know, he, while she was going, they were, they were having a drink somewhere and while, while she was going to the bathroom, he was caught on closed caption tv, you know, you know, spiking her, spiking a drink. And, and then, you know, he kept kind of pushing, you know, asking her to go to his hotel, hotel room. And like, this is such a terrible look.
00:20:18.159 - 00:21:25.893, Speaker B: Like, I mean, okay, I don't think this, this, this. Doesn't this only happen in crypto, let's be clear, right? Like, this happens any time when there's someone in like a position of power in any industry. And it's, I mean, this is a terrible look for everyone. But, you know, especially for like a, an industry like ours where there's just, you know, for better. You know, there's like, there's scams and there's just, you know, all the bad stuff that comes with this, like, kind of open, permissionless industry. It's just an extra bad look for crypto, right? So I mean, this, and also, I think it's also a result of there being so many more males in crypto than females that, you know, this stuff like, this probably happens more often than is actually, is actually reported. And, you know, anytime this happens, like, it should be reported.
00:21:25.893 - 00:21:41.629, Speaker B: Absolutely. Like, we shouldn't have to capture this stuff happening on CCTV for it to get reported. Right. Like, it should be out there, it should get reported. So it is a bad look all around. And it sucks to be, you know, affiliated with, like, you know, with stuff like this.
00:21:41.797 - 00:21:55.885, Speaker A: Now we reached the point of the conversation. Mike, that is my favorite part, which you come to me every episode with three different projects. I have gone, gone through a series of funding, and today we're going to start with gelato.
00:21:57.265 - 00:22:28.865, Speaker B: Yeah. So gelato is a roll up as a service platform. They raised 11 million in a Series A Plus round led by HackVC, participation from Animoca, IOSG Block, Celery and some others. So Gelato streamlines the creation of rollups L2s. They actually helped Kraken create their L2 Inc. Which we talked about before. They want to be the kind of the go to platform for anyone to launch their own chain.
00:22:28.865 - 00:22:58.729, Speaker B: They make it very easy and like we're talking about there's going to be. The thesis is that every popular DAPP is going to have their own chain. And if that thesis proves correct, Gelato is going to be very busy and very successful because they'll be able to help these, these dapps launch their own chain. So yeah, yeah, I think they've been getting a lot of traction and I think they'll continue with these trends of app chains in the future.
00:22:58.777 - 00:23:08.765, Speaker A: I guess we're still in this phase where infrastructure is still extremely important and gets a lot of traction in terms of the funding.
00:23:10.665 - 00:23:51.335, Speaker B: Yeah, I still think so. Right. I think, I think both things can be correct where yes, we need more apps to be built and you know, for consumers and end users but also I think that there's still a lot of infrastructure that still can be built. And you know, I mean our thesis at Deep Ventures is that like you know, maybe we're, maybe we're a little bit of past like the kind of generic L1s, L2s and we need a little bit more use case specific infrastructure but certainly you know all that's grouped in infrastructure and there's, and there's a lot of opportunity to still build better infrastructure.
00:23:51.955 - 00:23:59.095, Speaker A: And speaking of building Citria, I think I'm pronouncing it so you can pretty much build anything on Bitcoin. What is that about?
00:23:59.395 - 00:24:51.697, Speaker B: Yeah, more infrastructure. Right. This is, this is an ZK roll up on, on Bitcoin Citria they raised 14 million in a series A around led by founders fund and Maven11 Capital. Marana Ventures and a bunch of angels also participated. Yeah, Bitcoin, I mean again that's another area of focus for Deep Ventures is the bitcoin ecosystem. And you know there's, they built a ZK roll up essentially on Bitcoin and you know that that development environment has absolutely exploded in the last a year and a half or so since, since Ordinals were launched in about early 2023. And it is look like just bitcoin has very interesting properties, attractive properties for builders.
00:24:51.697 - 00:25:45.855, Speaker B: There's you Know, it's obviously the OG blockchain with the largest market cap. So that's very attractive for builders to get there. If we can unlock of, you know, a couple of trillion dollars of Bitcoin, you know, and with it, you know, I think we can get people instead of like miners, you know, selling their bitcoin, like they can stake it and get, you know, get, anyone could stake and get yield from it. But you know, that relieves a lot of the sell pressures that miners create. So you know, all this defi, all this infrastructure is being built on Bitcoin. Now whether you build an L2 like Citria, there are many other L2s out there, or you're building meta protocols directly on the L1 chain. There's a lot of design space there and there's just a ton of activity happening in the bitcoin ecosystem and it's really exciting.
00:25:46.395 - 00:26:00.447, Speaker A: Yeah, and also around Ethereum too. For anybody that's thinking that, oh, Ethereum is dead, there's still projects out there that are raising $30 million. I mean, that's a hefty penny there.
00:26:00.551 - 00:26:59.155, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean like there's anyone who says that is just like they, they're, they're gonna, they're gonna have egg in their face. Like, look, obviously a lot of, you know, we've talked about a lot of like deep in projects building on Solana, but you know, interesting, right? GLOW Labs is, is a, is a deep end project, you know, solar energy platform. They raised 30 million. The round was led by Framework and Union Square Ventures. So two heavy hitters in the industry. And this is kind of another one of. They've already built these existing solar farms and then now they're bringing a lot of that utility to the blockchain, right? So they reward solar farms on their network with GLW tokens in exchange for their output and as well as they, they give them like USDC for, for the carbon credits.
00:26:59.155 - 00:27:25.335, Speaker B: So you know, a very, you know, very cool, very cool energy depend on Ethereum. And they're going to use a big chunk of this to, to expand their solar farms to India. So, you know, more, more of that power getting onto, into their network and, and incentivizing it with, with, with crypto, which is, you know, what we love to see, having, having crypto be that incentivization layer across any use case in the world.
00:27:25.955 - 00:28:12.905, Speaker A: Last week I was talking to Patrick, who's a regular on my channel, and he was talking about the next move that he's personally thinking about after the Whole bull market in 2025. And he's looking at energy because with this whole AI rise, you're going to need energy to power all of that AI solutions. And so he started looking at, you know, where is energy the cheapest around the world? And even thinking, okay, maybe even from like a solar energy perspective. So along those lines, you know, your article about GLOW and their race is coming at a time where I'm kind of putting the pieces together here and wondering, like, maybe so where energy is something that we're going to see a lot of traction around here in the near future.
00:28:13.285 - 00:29:27.515, Speaker B: 100%. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, was at a conference here in D.C. and I asked him a question about that. I said a lot of energy providers, when they have excess energy, will flip a switch and dedicate that energy to my bitcoin, right? Because there is a very liquid market there and, you know, and they can use that energy to be very profitable. And I asked them, I said, is there going to be like a liquid market for dedicating energy to AI, right? You got excess energy, flip a switch, and now you can use that energy to, you know, power AI inference or AI model training. He didn't quite answer my question to my satisfaction, but like to think that if that were to happen, it's going to happen on crypto rails, right? It's because that's where you get that liquid market. So I think there's going to be another intersection of crypto and AI in that liquid energy market.
