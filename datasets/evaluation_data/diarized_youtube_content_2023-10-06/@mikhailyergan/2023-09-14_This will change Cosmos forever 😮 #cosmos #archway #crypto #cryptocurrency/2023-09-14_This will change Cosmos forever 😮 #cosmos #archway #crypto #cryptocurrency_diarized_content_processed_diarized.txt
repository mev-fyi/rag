00:00:00.330 - 00:00:56.640, Speaker A: Another big initiative is the snaps. I think that will be ultimately one of the biggest factors for bringing TVL and users from Ethereum or the L two s over to the cosmos. Because right now the experience of going from like metamask to then wanting to come to cosmos is not very user friendly. You're going to have to go be required to go spin up a wallet in the cosmos that is supported. So a leap or, or a Kepler or what have you, and then you're going to have to go bridge over your assets, pay fees, get it into the cosmos and then start your journey. And that is not necessarily the best way to get a new user, especially when you're not offering something super exclusive to them. So by getting snaps where they don't even have to download a wallet and they can access it just by doing a drop down on their current metamask and that's enough for them to start interacting thing that now becomes an onboarding experience that at least some users will be willing to try.
