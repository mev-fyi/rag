00:00:00.090 - 00:00:03.520, Speaker A: Is now a good time, the best time to build?
00:00:04.130 - 00:00:45.270, Speaker B: It's a very hard time to raise capital, and that's the only thing for builders. If you can have enough capital to basically just start and build an MVP, then it's a good time if it's something that's not needed. But if you're raising capital either from the crowd or a VC, I find that the bear markets are harder. Of course, if you've already had a good exit somewhere along the line in your career, then you've probably got connections with capital that will make it easier. But if you're a fresh kid from uni that's building something really cool, it will be harder in the bear market to find capital.
