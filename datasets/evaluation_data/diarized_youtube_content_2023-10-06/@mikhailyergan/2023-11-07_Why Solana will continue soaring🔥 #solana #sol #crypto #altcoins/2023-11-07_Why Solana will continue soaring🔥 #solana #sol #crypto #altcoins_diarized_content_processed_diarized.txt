00:00:00.090 - 00:00:43.860, Speaker A: It's one of the most impressive things I've ever seen. With the AWS announcing their Amazon, not everyone's going to love it because they're going to say, hey, x amount of validators run on here. It's centralized, but ultimately you need to have options for everybody. Some people want a very, very reliable, high quality provider that they know has redundancies and can count on and will be able to refund them money if something goes wrong. Will always have what they need in stock versus a decent centralized company that might be cheaper or something, but has trade offs as long as they don't go the route of you have to use AWS to build on Solana and require it. I don't see how this impacts anything other than just providing a great partnership and more options to your builders. And that's what matters to me, at least.
