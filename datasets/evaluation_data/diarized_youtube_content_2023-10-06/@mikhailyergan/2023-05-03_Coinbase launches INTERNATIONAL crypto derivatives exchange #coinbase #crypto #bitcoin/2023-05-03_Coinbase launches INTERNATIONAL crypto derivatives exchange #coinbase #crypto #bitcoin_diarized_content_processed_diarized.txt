00:00:00.090 - 00:00:08.286, Speaker A: Coinbase receives a well notice from SEC, and it took the company on surprise because they were having good conversations. They send a.
00:00:08.308 - 00:00:09.034, Speaker B: Lot of letters.
00:00:09.082 - 00:00:19.630, Speaker A: To SEC. One of the things that SEC said in 2021 is that the crypto exchange, decentralized crypto exchanges, they need to register under SEC, but there is no way to do it.
00:00:19.700 - 00:00:25.142, Speaker B: So Coinbase sent them a letter asking how to do it, and they received no response from SEC.
00:00:25.316 - 00:00:27.814, Speaker A: And then instead of the response, they.
00:00:27.852 - 00:00:29.458, Speaker B: Receive a wells notice.
00:00:29.634 - 00:00:32.694, Speaker A: And generally speaking, the wells notice just.
00:00:32.732 - 00:00:33.606, Speaker B: Say, hey, you.
00:00:33.628 - 00:00:34.450, Speaker A: Are trading.
00:00:34.530 - 00:00:41.126, Speaker B: Securities. Watch out. And they then Coinbase asks and okay, tell me.
00:00:41.228 - 00:00:42.578, Speaker A: Which securities I am trading.
00:00:42.594 - 00:00:51.980, Speaker B: On so I can unlist them or try to make them register it. Then register myself as I already asked it to you how to do, and you didn't answer.
