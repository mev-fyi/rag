00:00:00.880 - 00:00:59.501, Speaker A: All right, welcome everyone. Today we're going to do a dive into sui. We'll explore whether or not it can continue its new all time highs in the upcoming bull run. We'll analyze some past market benchmarks, especially on Solana's side, and analyzing Solana's peak performance last bull run and look to see how Sui can do something similar this cycle. I'll also cover some projections and recent trends that could push the overall market to new heights. So let's jump in. So to start, let's take a look back at Solana's past performance during the bull run when the total market cap hit around 3 trillion in late 2021, Solana managed to capture about 2 1/2% of that share, peaking at a market cap of about 74 billion.
00:00:59.501 - 00:01:56.719, Speaker A: This made Solana one of the biggest winners last cycle, not just in the price, but also in terms of developer activity and ecosystem growth. Now, what if Sui could capture half of the market share Solana achieved in the last bull run? I think this is a realistic expectation just given the recent success that they have had. And there's also some similarities in terms of being labeled as a VC coin. There's definitely some similarities there with the perception of Solana last cycle. So what I did was I'm assuming a 10 trillion total crypto market cap this bull run, which Standard Chartered has projected as a possibility by 2026. Honestly, I think it would happen sooner because by 2026 I anticipate US being back in the bear market. But I'll share an article where it goes a little bit more into that.
00:01:56.719 - 00:02:40.141, Speaker A: But this would give Sui a market share of about one and a quarter percent. So that translates to a market cap of about 123.5 billion. Just so you guys can see where I'm coming up with these numbers again, this is a recent article that came out about Standard Charter sees total crypto market cap climbing 5x to 10 trillion by 2026. Based on current projections, I think that hitting 10 trillion should not be a problem. But again, I'm trying to be conservative when it comes to these estimations. Now, given that this total market cap is going to be about 123.5
00:02:40.141 - 00:03:13.305, Speaker A: billion for SUI, assuming that it can do half of what Solana did. Now we can calculate what the target market cap would mean for Sui's price. Sui's current market cap is 9.44 billion and a price of 3.32 and a price of $3.32 at the time of this recording in US dollars. Reaching a market cap of 123 and a half billion would bring Sui's price to around $43.43.
00:03:13.305 - 00:04:06.939, Speaker A: Assuming the supply remains stable from today's price, this would give a 13x increase. A big reason why I do manage the expectations of Sui and not saying that I can 100% replicate what Solana did was because of the evaluation that Sui received when it launched. So there was a lot more room for Solana to grow than Sui. So I'm taking that into consideration when creating these projections. So is Sui positioned for new highs? I conclude that Sui has a compelling case for reaching new highs in the upcoming bull run. With a projected market cap of 123 and a half billion, the potential price of SUI could reach 43.43, which would represent a 13x increase from the current levels.
00:04:06.939 - 00:04:39.405, Speaker A: As long as they can keep getting big news such as this Vaneck launches Exchange Traded Sui Offering in Europe I feel like the sky's the limit.
