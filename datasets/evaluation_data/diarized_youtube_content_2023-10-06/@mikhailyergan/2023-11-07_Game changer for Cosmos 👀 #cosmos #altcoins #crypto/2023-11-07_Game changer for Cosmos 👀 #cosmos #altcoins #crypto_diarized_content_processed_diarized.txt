00:00:00.170 - 00:00:42.102, Speaker A: To say that Coinbase is a cheaper option. That says a right, right. Because it's not like cheap, it's just cheaper. And I think noble can really help with that. And I was actually on a space with the noble team yesterday. They're talking about this is getting access to retail and users to be able to mint USDC so that it's not just like institutions and large buyers like you could actually mint it from natively on whatever chain it's like from Archway. I could natively mint USDC and I wouldn't have to pay any fees other than I'm sure there's a transaction fee that could be similar to Coinbase and then there wouldn't be additional fees on top of that because they can just do the native minting so there is no bridging, there's no real costs outside of whatever fee they want to charge for you to utilize it.
00:00:42.102 - 00:00:51.180, Speaker A: So that I think will be huge for the cosmos in general. Just to get more ways to onboard and offboard your fiat, help me.
