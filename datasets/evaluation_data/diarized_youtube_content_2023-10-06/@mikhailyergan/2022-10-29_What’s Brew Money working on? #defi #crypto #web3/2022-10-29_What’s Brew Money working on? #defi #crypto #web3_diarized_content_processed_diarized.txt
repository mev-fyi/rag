00:00:00.170 - 00:00:41.750, Speaker A: We are planning to introduce more protocols available on polygon chain to start with. Like, one of the major ones is essentially enabling matic staking through stator labs. So users can come in and either move matic or buy matic and stake them in a single flow and grow them at like. I think currently the kind of yield you can get is like five and a half percent on your matic staking. Plus if they want, you can boost it by providing liquidity into a liquidity PD pool and get like up to 15% apr on them. So that's one thing that we are doing. The next few set of things that we are planning to do is like, okay, we are trying to figure out a solution for how we can make the wallet management or the Ctraz management simpler and more secure.
00:00:41.750 - 00:00:57.450, Speaker A: We are absolutely a huge fans of what Argent has done and now a lot of other wallets are doing, which is around social recovery. So we are trying to figure out that is there a way we can build something similar for our set of users? Catch the full interview on YouTube and don't forget to comment like and subscribe.
