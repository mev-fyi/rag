00:00:00.120 - 00:00:03.662, Speaker A: I know, I know I'm crazy, but I think that there is a chance. I think right now is probably the.
00:00:03.678 - 00:00:08.606, Speaker B: Chance ton and telegram probably outperforms I'm very excited about.
00:00:08.750 - 00:00:12.234, Speaker C: I might get hung for this, but my second hot take is.
00:00:14.734 - 00:00:44.564, Speaker D: All right everyone, welcome. We've got an all star lineup of panelists of VC's and researchers. Where are we in the market? What narratives are we all looking at? We're going to get their thoughts. First, just a few quick disclaimers. None of this is financial advice, and my work here is separate from my work at Certic. Let's go ahead and get started with the introductions. First, I have Mirza who's the general partner at Vessel VC.
00:00:44.564 - 00:01:35.628, Speaker D: He's also head of business development at Injective. I also am joined by Sumir, who is an investor at Artichoke Capital, early investors in movement Labs, Dydx and Monad, to name a few. Ting, who is a researcher and writer at chain of thought, previously at Doefi Digital, which is trusted by big names like Coinbase, a 16 z and blockchain capital, as well as David, who is the research partner at Anagram, previously at Binance Labs and consensus. Welcome, gentlemen. So let's go ahead and get started on a macro level. Looking at the current market conditions, we're seeing that things are headed sideways. A lot of folks say sell and may go away, and we're in June and we're in the same boring state, so to speak.
00:01:35.628 - 00:01:47.028, Speaker D: The Fed decided to predict and say that maybe there will be one rate cut maximum. What are your thoughts about what's happening from an overall market perspective? David, I'll start with you.
00:01:47.156 - 00:02:24.566, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you're spot on. I think this cycle the Fed raised rates like eleven times, but eight out of the last nine, they opted to hold steady. And now the overall prevailing sentiment is that it's probably going to hold that way and maybe tick down, but no time soon and not super, super substantially. I think this is also true because inflation last month, I think, was around like 3.53.3%. So it seems like it's a little bit more under control. And obviously all this basically impacts the cost of borrowing, cost of investing, purchasing and savings. And so I think all that to say, we're in a much better spot now than we were, say, twelve months ago.
00:02:24.566 - 00:02:56.764, Speaker A: And I wouldn't say we're fully risk on, but I think that the fears in the markets around just like this, inflation is out of control, have been quelled a bit. We're not fully there yet. But I think that again, we're in a much better spot than we are now. And you kind of see that in the market with some rebounds. Some of that was driven by bitcoin ETF's back in January. The prospect of Ethereum ETF's, both of those corresponding assets responded pretty well. But I think all those things combined are pushing us in that right direction.
00:02:56.764 - 00:03:00.264, Speaker A: But again, we're still not there yet, but making progress.
00:03:00.924 - 00:03:24.286, Speaker D: I feel like people are expecting more. They're looking at the ETF inflows that were in March and we were at now. We have more inflows now, and yet the price of bitcoin is not even as high as it was in March. So it's a very interesting dynamic of what's happening. Ting. I'd love to hear from you because you're on the other side of the world. Most of us here are in North America.
00:03:24.286 - 00:03:27.514, Speaker D: But what is your take on what's happening from a market perspective?
00:03:29.214 - 00:04:15.674, Speaker E: Yeah, I think from a macro perspective, I think David has really outlined most of it. I think crypto is very much all about liquidity, is very sensitive to liquidity, and the good news is that I think we are pretty much, we've gotten over the very big hump that led to that very big sell off in the last one or two years, and I think now we're in a much better state. I think looking forward, we have a few things that we can definitely look forward to. I think we're definitely probably going to get one rate cut this year. But I think depending on how the macro data goes, I think we could. I think the Fed's also kind of like waiting and seeing and seeing maybe potentially in the later part of this year, if things soften a little bit, maybe you could even get a little bit more. So I think there's a lot of potential upside surprise around these things.
00:04:15.674 - 00:04:53.684, Speaker E: And I think what's interesting is that the impact on the crypto markets has been very much driven by these institutional flows. So I think the story this year is the bitcoin ETF. I think everything has really stemmed from that. I think there hasn't been a huge amount of flows and interest into many of these other sectors, and that's why I think many of the altcoins tend to be lagging a little bit. And also just because we have so many of these tokens now and many of them launched in the last couple of months with very high fdvs, I think it makes it a very, I would say a very unique market that's actually quite different from the previous cycles.
00:04:54.704 - 00:05:06.444, Speaker D: Thanks so much, Ting and Mirza. I'd like to get your thoughts because your perspective is interesting because you do kind of work on the altcoin side. You're part of injective. So I'd love to get your perspective on what's happening in the market.
00:05:06.624 - 00:05:52.924, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. I think Tang and David are absolutely correct. I'm not going to delve too deeply into the numbers. I think one big confounding variable or a couple are one, there's an election coming up, which I think might actually incentivize a lot of people to wait and see until we figure out whether Trump or biden are winning, because I think the market will react very differently based on who wins in terms of rate cuts. Maybe we're all on the same page here, but even if we get one more rate cut, I feel like a lot of it is baked into the market. So I actually don't think rates will impact crypto this year as much as we think, just because either the Fed will hold things steady or there might be one cut, which I think people already expect. So I don't think you're going to see a rally driven by the Fed.
00:05:52.924 - 00:06:42.678, Speaker C: There are a couple of other things. So one is, I might get hung for this, but there's no real catalyst this cycle, right? Like, yes, we have good institutional adoption because of the ETF, but there's no real retail flow, right? The prior cycles we had nfts, we had metaverse, we had all these sort of narrative driven sort of markets. I think last cycle we had Defi and then thought by nfts and then gaming this cycle, we don't really have anything. Yes, people could argue we have memes, but I could also argue we have memes every cycle. So that is one part that I personally don't even have an answer to. It's like, what's really going to lead to this amazing rally? Because you guys are absolutely right, institutional inflows are increasing, but yeah, things are holding steady, right? Because there's, there's a lot of sell pressures from places we don't see. There's no real retail in the market.
00:06:42.678 - 00:07:25.834, Speaker C: Which means, yes, all these new tokens are launching and driving attention, but people are just swapping bags, right? They're, they're selling one thing to get onto the next thing. It's not like net new money coming in. And also on top of that, there's a couple other sort of factors, whether it be FTX continuing to sell off, whether it be a lot of these foundations, because of these high fdvs, have made a ton of money, so they're selling off. So even though we have good institutional inflow, there's a lot of sell side factors we haven't really accounted for. So I think the market dynamic for crypto, yes, it always lags behind stocks, but I don't think it changes unless we have sort of these like major callus, whether it be narrative driven, et cetera. From the retail side.
00:07:26.494 - 00:07:44.206, Speaker D: It's interesting that you said that we're not really seeing a big narrative, and a lot of people may argue with that because you have deepen, you have AI. I know ting. You go deep into both of those topics, really. Sameer, what are your thoughts about what these gentlemen are saying about the market?
00:07:44.350 - 00:08:23.596, Speaker B: Yeah, I think across the board, I agree as well in terms of the narrative side. Just to piggyback off of that idea, very quickly, there are narratives going on right now. There is the whole deep end AI. There are new l ones, l two s coming out. But at the end of the day, most of that's infrastructure. You can build all the infrastructure in the world, but then if you're not getting some sort of big consumer adoption back to the end user of getting them excited about being in web3 for whatever purpose, in DeFi summer, we had DeFi, then we had nfts, and that was very exciting because regular people could onboard get into all of these unfamiliar ideas and learn a lot more about the ecosystem and then get cross sold into different opportunities within web3. But like Mirza mentioned, there isn't sort of that main catalyst that we have right now.
00:08:23.596 - 00:08:59.434, Speaker B: There isn't any new fundamental technology that's getting consumers very wowed and awed by what web3 has to offer. What web3 has to offer right now that's getting us wowed. And odd is new infrastructure, which is great, but you still have to try and rely and try to look for consumer applications at the end of the day. So I think I echo with what the rest of the panel has here to say about the market currently. Obviously, we are in an election year, and historically, there has been some precedents for markets performing better around, I think, 83%, 19 out of 23 election years since the S and P opened have returned positively. So there's that angle going for it. But at the same time, rate cuts are priced in.
00:08:59.434 - 00:09:05.066, Speaker B: At least you would assume that they are. And you're kind of seeing this kind of trickle down back to projects at the end of the day.
00:09:05.090 - 00:09:05.226, Speaker A: Right.
00:09:05.250 - 00:09:46.624, Speaker B: Like they're also trying to time, especially for the infrastructure projects, when TGE would be best. And so you're seeing a lot of initial TGE's before the announcements in the past two days from the Fed looking at September, looking at October, looking at q four of this year. So people are still kind of doing that. But now that this news has come out, now that we know that there's not going to be that many rate cuts and that the economic environment is probably going to be risk off for a while, it's going to be interesting to see what some of these new products end up doing with regards to when they release a token because of liquidity inflows and liquidity outflows. Bitcoin ETF at $200 million of outflow, one of the biggest outflow days over the past week. That's a mini signal to you to show that things are maybe not as hot as they were come March when the ETF was actually first released.
00:09:47.574 - 00:10:06.714, Speaker D: Yeah, BlackRock seems to be holding strong, right? I mean it's really the other ETF's that are selling off. But I believe from what I saw, BlackRock are still hodling. So is it going to be the price action of bitcoin that's finally going to drive the retail market or are we looking for some amazing application to show up? And Mike Mears has said we need some kind of retail or narrative. David, what do you think?
00:10:07.294 - 00:10:40.496, Speaker A: Yeah, just to add some other points before we kind of switch that I think spot on about the presidential election. That is kind of like a traditional macro indicator that will definitely impact policy moving forward. But the other thing too that tails into this. There's Europe's, the mica, the markets and crypto asset regulation upcoming in two weeks, I think. And the month that's going to have a big impact on european stable coins. We've already seen people, stablecoin issuers pack it up. They were based on european denominator stablecoins and they've left finance, for instance.
00:10:40.496 - 00:11:26.786, Speaker A: That's a big impact in the EU and also around, there's no marginal retail buyer at the end of the day. One of those things is not only do we have inflows of DC capital and all these new projects launching tokens, we also have older ones that are unlocking at a pretty accelerated rate. We have arbitrum and Starknet are one of the big ones unlocking. There really isn't that retail marginal buyer to fill those unlocks, to fill that bid in the market. So then you also have tokens that are inflating like look no further than something like a world coin, which is like 11 million a day. There's all these unlocks, there's all these issuance issues, but again, there's no marginal buyer. I think the marginal buyer comes in once the institutional buyer comes in, and I think that will be driven by ETF's.
00:11:26.786 - 00:11:53.698, Speaker A: It's a very boring answer, it's a very vanilla answer. But I think that retail follows institutions. But until then, I think you have a lot of bleeding out on existing, existing projects that raise a ton of money and now have these linear unlocks for the next three, four, five years that there really isn't any demand. On the demand side, there's going to be a lot of supply, but there's not a lot of buying demand right now. So I think until institutions step in, we're going to see a lot of downward pressure on a lot of projects beyond bitcoin and ethereum.
00:11:53.866 - 00:12:11.566, Speaker D: The retail is not necessarily buying these unwalks. Do you feel like some of this has to do with Eigenweigher? And they made. They made the news recently about the way that they handled their airdrop. And a lot of people are feeling like it's vc's versus retail. Is there a bad taste in their mouth from what happened there?
00:12:11.750 - 00:12:42.144, Speaker A: I wouldn't say it's Eigen layer adjacent. I just think that there aren't many objective functions for these tokens. Nobody cares about Dao governance. Voter apathy is an all time low or all time high unless it's the uniswap fee switch. Nobody really cares to participate unless there's a function for the token. I don't think there's going to be a huge demand. Until then it's all speculative or you have some other exogenous factor like the ETF, like bitcoin and ethereum can now get sucked up into an ETF and that can impact market supply or issuance, et cetera.
00:12:42.144 - 00:13:20.530, Speaker A: There isn't anything like that right now for any other tokens. I would say that in fact, once Eigen layer does come to full form and they do launch main net and all these avss that are will potentially be vying for crypto economic security. If they can pull that off and the tooling is right, it's easier for devs to build on there, it's easier for projects to deploy. There will be some sort of functionality for the token and that could tie into people actually wanting it. But I think it all gets tied into like, there's not many things you can do with these tokens other than, like, stake. And most of these tokens have very high issuance rates, so you kind of get inflated away when you do stake. So, long story short, I think there needs to be more syncs and more functions for these tokens.
00:13:20.530 - 00:13:25.974, Speaker A: Otherwise, I think they continue to kind of suffer a bit. But I don't necessarily see it as an Eigen layer, like VC thing.
00:13:27.094 - 00:13:28.030, Speaker D: Thanks, David.
00:13:28.142 - 00:13:54.646, Speaker C: Yeah, I think Eigen Lair. Yes. Do I think they botched airdrop? Absolutely, yes. But at the same time, I'd argue, I've never seen any project do an airdrop where everyone is happy. I don't think that's ever happened in the history of time where you do an airdrop and all of retail is like, oh, my God, this is the greatest airdrop ever. Arguably, maybe Uniswap was, because that was a surprise back in the day, and it just randomly happened when airdrops were not a thing. But everyone just expects airdrops now.
00:13:54.646 - 00:14:25.260, Speaker C: And I would even argue, even if Eigen layer had given the airdrop amounts people wanted, et cetera, are most of the people going to hold, or are they just farming to sell? Right. So would it really have driven a lot of great market sentiment? I don't think so. I think the airdrops have sort of. Yeah, I'm going to get hung for this one, too. I think airdrops have, like, ruined this industry. I think it's such, so pervasive, it's so bad. At least back in the day, you could argue that icos were bad, but at least you knew what you were buying.
00:14:25.260 - 00:14:52.366, Speaker C: It's like, hey, I know what I'm getting into. Airdrops are almost like playing the lottery, and no one's ever happy. Projects, obviously are incentivized not to give that much airdrop because they think everyone's going to sell it, but everyone just expects it. Now, if you don't do an airdrop, I remember Sweden and do it, and the community hated them for it. It's like, you have to do it, but even if you do it, no one's happy. So it's almost like a lose lose situation. I don't think airdrops are going to be what drive retail.
00:14:52.366 - 00:15:13.914, Speaker C: Like, maybe it will drive airdrop farmers. And I have a bunch of friends across Asia, across, like, America Latam, who we're just farming these airdrops. They'll buy out entire click farms. So you're not actually getting real retail. It's just a bunch of actual whales who run these click farms. That are actually getting the airdrops. So I don't think airdrops actually even bring in marginal retail.
00:15:13.914 - 00:15:25.204, Speaker C: So, yeah, that's my answer. I think, yes, you could fall Eigen lair, but I don't think it's like an Eigen layer only issue. I think it's an industry wide issue around airdrops.
00:15:25.324 - 00:16:01.200, Speaker D: I used to work for a radio station way back in the day, and everywhere I would go around the city, there were certain people that would want to come and get free stuff. We would call them prize pigs. So I wonder if it's like, very similar. You have like the airdrop farmers where they're not necessarily loyal to that application or to that network. They'll come in, they'll get the reward, and then they're off. Right? Because the whole incentive of having the airdrop is to get people to be incentivized to actually use the application. So, to your point, Mirza, maybe somewhere down the line, it's not always 100% effective.
00:16:01.312 - 00:16:46.268, Speaker E: So I think the main problem right now is just that there isn't any new capital outside of the institutional flows into bitcoin and hopefully ETH in the coming months. There isn't a lot of new participants. And the main reason is because there isn't anything fun or cool that you can actually really do this time. And actually, this is the thing that makes me the most worried about the current cycle. So I think we can see a lot of info through all these ETF's, but at the end of the day, we don't come up with any useful applications that people actually want to use beyond just purely for speculation. Then I think we. I think, like all of the things that we're doing right here, all of the price increases we've seen over the last couple of months, and I think that's pretty much been very unwarranted.
00:16:46.268 - 00:17:10.250, Speaker E: So we really need to see something new, something creative to really come into the space. I think Suma mentioned that a lot of what was being built in the least couple of months have been very much like infrastructure projects. And those are things that. These are things that retail doesn't get excited about. It's not interesting. It's potentially cool for people who technical and want to read and understand more about the space, but most people don't care. Most people want something fun to do.
00:17:10.250 - 00:17:46.714, Speaker E: So I was actually pretty excited about NFTs for a while. I thought that could be a very big thing that actually brings in a lot more people in the space. But it seems that it's been languishing a little bit and we're still waiting for that next big consumer app to come. And then I think that's when the next leg for crypto in terms of user adoption could really come from. I was excited about crypto gaming. I think that still can be the one of the drivers to bring in. But I think unfortunately so far it's been middle of the year almost and we still haven't seen that sort of breakout web3 game with lots of organic users who aren't just paying to farm some kind of token yet.
00:17:48.094 - 00:18:26.124, Speaker D: Thanks, ting. And to your point, on the social side, David, I saw recently you put out a post about Friendtech. They announced that they are launching a chain, I believe all of a sudden their user base skyrocketed, which I'm not surprised because that project in general seems to be very volatile. They had a drop of 94% in their users and now they're all seem to be coming back after this announcement. So it would be interesting to see if that could potentially be the catalyst on the social side. But Sameer, just to wrap up the last question about retail and them being kind of missing in action, what are your thoughts on that?
00:18:27.314 - 00:19:09.700, Speaker B: Yeah, again, I think like Tang, you know, I was also very interested in NFT. Boom. I used to work for like a web3 gaming like affiliated startup as well. And within that space I had a lot of precedent and a lot of ambition for the way the web3 gaming was going to be going. And especially how NFT technologies in general, not collectibles or pfps, but how the technology could be enabling for a lot of different use cases within gaming, but then also like brand loyalty and tokenization of various assets. Those were all very promising and all very hyped up when they first came out and began to gain hype and gain momentum. But then on the tail end of things as that hype died down because there was less actual utility, less actual applications that people could use.
00:19:09.700 - 00:20:12.152, Speaker B: We're now in this awkward waiting point of, okay, given bear market conditions or sideways market conditions, it's the best time for people to be building. We all know that and we're just hoping for that North Star, that one or two companies that can take the reins and lead with either a new game or their new perfect use case, or you have legacy web, two brands that start to enable and integrate this technology. Stuff like that will bring in retail along with what the rest of the panel has echoed. Mirza and David, they talked about institutional inflows and how ETF's will typically be a big catalyst event for bringing a lot of people in crypto monetarily. But then on the application side, on the actual use case side, this can bring a lot of people in and then have the monetary sort of as a second backing or a next level of understanding, not necessarily to be the prime motive. With airdrop farming and with airdrops, that's become the prim motive, right? Because like tank said, people aren't interested in infrastructure. They don't really care about it unless it's for like a sort of, excuse me, technical understanding and like, you know, fascinating over the technology or fascinating over what's going on in the space.
00:20:12.152 - 00:20:59.816, Speaker B: But for the most part, for the average consumer, theyre going to be interested in infrastructure because of the propensity for an airdrop. And then once the airdrop is done, the community will hopefully stay for the developers that are on there, but for the regular retail, theyll just keep branching over and moving on from next airdrop to next airdrop. And then you get a big cycle of the other airdrops that happened a year or two ago or several months ago having unlocks that happened, and the price just keeps dipping and people start to lose interest. So you go through this cycle right now. Right now, I believe that we are on the crusp of waiting for the next catalyst, waiting for the next couple companies that are driving consumer adoption to bring in a lot of people, and at the same time, hoping that the macro picture will kind of ease up a little bit. The propensity and appetite for risk on assets will come back, and then we can start to see things pick up from there. But it might take some time, and.
00:20:59.840 - 00:21:28.536, Speaker D: Maybe it'll be the Ethereum ETF, obviously, that got approved, but we still haven't seen that on the market. So perhaps, maybe that could be a catalyst, and maybe we'll see other altcoins join that movement. A lot of networks are trying to prepare for institutions. You've got Solana. It can now trade PayPal, USD. Mirza, I saw that you recently posted that injective. Is it the same? So a lot of networks are trying to prepare for institutions, and maybe that's their strategy in trying to prepare for the next ETF.
00:21:28.536 - 00:21:37.234, Speaker D: So I'd love to hear from you all. What are your thoughts on the next ETF approval after Ethereum? What do you think it would be? David?
00:21:38.614 - 00:22:13.722, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the million dollar question. I think that one signal to me, and this is completely conjecture of me, just kind of guessing. There's no insider knowledge or anything. But I think that one clue to me is that a lot of the main issuers that got approved for the ETF's were all bitcoin. Most of them were also bitcoin issuers. So I think that if you kind of look at that paper trail where they're focused in the market might give you a clue. If you look at some of the institutional flows beyond, like Ethereum and bitcoin, they're very paltry, they're not significant.
00:22:13.722 - 00:22:50.544, Speaker A: But I think Solana is probably like the third or fourth. And so my guess would be something like that, just given that institutions out of anything else besides bitcoin, Ethereum, and again, they're not big inflows at all. They're pretty trivial. It's like 30 million on the year, 40 million on a year, but it signals that they are interested, and they have been steady the last couple months. They've been like little 3 million here, 4 million here weekly inflows, but they are Solana. So if I had to guess, I think that given the current group of issuers, I think that they probably favor Solana more so than some of the others. But again, purely a speculative guess.
00:22:51.084 - 00:23:05.654, Speaker D: Well, I also know that you do a lot of research into Solana, so that's kind of like your bread and butter, Mirza. Do you have any other opinions on this? Obviously, you spend a lot of time working on injective, and you're trying to bridge that gap between web3 and trab five. What are your thoughts on that?
00:23:05.954 - 00:23:49.324, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I agree. I think Solana is probably top of the list. I think there are a couple, again, confounding variables that might derail any ETF, not just for Solana, anyone else. Because if you look at the cycle for cycle, meaning how long it took for bitcoin or ethereum to get that ETF, they went through many different processes, and also it was declared to be a commodity. Ethereum was declared to be a commodity, and only after did they get an ETF. Solar right now is part of, alongside many other altcoins, I should say part of many ongoing investigations. So there hasn't been this declarative moment where the government, Sec or CFTC came out and said that, hey, Solana is a commodity, etcetera.
00:23:49.324 - 00:24:24.544, Speaker C: And this is not me calling out Solana or anything. The same thing with ripple, they're still ongoing with fines, et cetera. So while I think something like a Solana or a ripple or maybe even a litecoin, right, who knows, based on, like, market cap and staying power, like, who's been here a while? It could be anyone's guess. Do I want it to be something like a Solana? Yeah, because I think some of these other projects are arguably not doing as much as Solana in the department, but I think it won't be that soon. Even if you look at Ethereum, it took years. Bitcoin has taken nearly a decade, I would argue. So, yes.
00:24:24.544 - 00:24:41.804, Speaker C: Solana, I know, is starting to have conversations similar to every other major alwann or network that's doing anything in institutional work. I think it might be a while before we see the next one is my slightly bearish take. I'm not sure if we will see any TF or any other altcoin this year. Just my guess.
00:24:42.224 - 00:24:49.874, Speaker D: A lot of people argue that it could be not until 2025, maybe after the election, perhaps, but, ting, what are your thoughts on that?
00:24:50.894 - 00:25:38.394, Speaker E: Yeah, I say I generally agree with everyone, especially Merza. I think there isn't any clear path to getting an ETF approved right now. I mean, under the current regulatory regime, I think, and what we've seen happen with the bitcoin ETF, it appears that first you need to have some kind of futures ETF product that's on the market, and then after that, you need to get the cryptocurrency declared as a commodity and not security. And then I think once you fulfill these two conditions, then it appears that you get that chance to get an ETF approved. And that's what happened with bitcoin and what happened with Ethereum. So if we were to follow the same pathway that these two tokens took, I think it's going to be a very long time before we see the next ETF. I mean, spot ETF actually can approve.
00:25:38.394 - 00:26:00.904, Speaker E: What could happen is that after the elections, we might get some kind of regime change. Hopefully, the new regime regime is a lot more friendly towards crypto, and they could start to institute some ways that certain cryptocurrencies and tokens can actually get listed as spot ETF's. And that might actually make the process easier and quicker. So I think we have to see what happens later this year and if any of that software changes.
00:26:01.724 - 00:26:17.482, Speaker D: Yeah, there's a lot of talk on X about if Trump becomes president, how bullish he is supporting bitcoin miners. And it's also kind of forcing the Biden administration to also start looking at crypto. They're considering taking crypto donations, else taking.
00:26:17.538 - 00:26:50.124, Speaker B: Crypto donations, but at the same time have regulatory considerations and concerns with Coinbase. It's such an interesting point of contention, isn't it? No, I think, like, yeah, obviously Trump coming in. Trump is trying to maintain a very bullish stance on crypto and trying to get all of crypto aligned with his angle. I won't get political here whatsoever, but I think I'll just echo off of what everyone here has said. I mean, Amir's especially. Right, like, injective is one of the prime new networks trying to onboard for Tradfi, trying to onboard for trading and sort of those. Those sorts of applications.
00:26:50.124 - 00:27:43.030, Speaker B: Solana is also doing the same thing, securitize, Ondo. They all have USDY or USG on the network, so you're seeing things like that. But at the same time as having those sorts of applications in Tridfi introduced onto networks, Solana is also the prime network for meme coins at the moment. So reputation matters at the end of the day. And I think the reputation that bitcoin and ethereum have established, being the incumbents and being so old at this point, been around for a while, a lot of institutions get the time to run their backtesting. To understand the asset class in its entirety means that the propensity to have ETF's come upon that from a risk based standpoint, makes a little bit more sense than something that's potentially inherently more volatile, has a little bit less history going behind it, and has seen a lot and a lot of adoption within the web3 space, but they're not necessarily doing a lot of things within web two or blockchain adoption. Just globally.
00:27:43.030 - 00:27:55.794, Speaker B: Just internationally, I'd say. So it is a very hard question. I think I'd echo the same sentiment where Solana would be like the next logical ETF to come about, but at the same time, it will take a few years.
00:27:57.654 - 00:28:34.516, Speaker D: Yeah. The only thing that Solana has going against it is from a regulatory perspective, I think. Mirza, you also mentioned this earlier, that technically it's already been deemed as security. Now will they change their mind? Perhaps? Right? Because with Ethereum, we didn't really get a clear answer from Gary Gensler originally, and now, obviously, all systems go. So that remains to be seen. But for now, we can at least have fun talking about the narratives. Right, once that Ethereum ETF takes off, like, what could be the next narrative that you see doing really well? Obviously, you guys spend a lot of time researching right now, so I'd love to hear your thoughts on what is it that's really catching your attention right now.
00:28:34.516 - 00:28:35.984, Speaker D: David, I'll start with you.
00:28:37.684 - 00:29:18.460, Speaker A: Yeah, another. Another million dollar question. I think around in a very general sense, user accessibility and user experience and some of the things that are paving the way, like we got account abstraction like this cycle, I guess, which makes things very, very easy and abstracts away a lot of the friction for an end user. It makes interacting on any blockchain or any EVM blockchain pretty seamless and allows application interactions to be one click, et cetera. You pair that with something intense. A lot of different people are building intense networks which can be considered as almost limit orders on any function or any action you want to get. These can be pretty powerful and again allows you to do very one click things.
00:29:18.460 - 00:30:03.830, Speaker A: For instance, you could do something like there's a million different restaking protocols. How do I choose between one that offers the best rates? You could type that into an intense engine and literally one click and it gets it done. That's not very groundbreaking, but I think it paves the way for very accessible end user functions and end user features that to me gets me very excited. There's also incoming Uniswap v four, which adds hook mechanisms and all the singleton function and all these different efficiencies that make buying and trading a lot easier. At the end of the day, one of the main ethos of web3, and while we're all here, is moving away from centralized entities and into decentralized ones. This makes interacting with Dexs super, super easy. My mom or dad is never going to touch uniswap the way it is, or any Dex for the matter.
00:30:03.830 - 00:30:45.706, Speaker A: But now you could have that functionality built within a wallet. You could open your metamask and literally type in something to do some sort of function account abstraction intents. And then connecting with v four hooks can give you back a way better price than you can get now and a way easier way to do it. Those are top of mind to me, which makes things really easy for the end user and I think can help push retail coming back, because now they can do things other than just watch, trade or speculate on an NFT. They can actually do things like hey, I don't want to use Robinhood anymore, I want to use again, uniswap or whatever, or pancakeswap, whatever it might be. Now. It's really, really easy for me to do it now I can type in these otherwise complicated functions to find the best price and search the market to give me that most optimal action in what I'm trying to do.
00:30:45.706 - 00:31:10.624, Speaker A: Those are the things that get me really, really excited right now in terms of on the vc side, they are a little bit overheated. Everyone's building in intense spaces. A lot of different intense projects have raised lots of money, which gets me a little bit leery. But I think, end of day, they are some of the best engineers and builders I've seen in this space from, like, a technical perspective. So I think we're in good hands, and I think that that next step, that next iteration really gets retail in a very meaningful way.
00:31:12.164 - 00:31:16.824, Speaker D: Earlier, you mentioned restaking. Are there any specific teams that are catching your attention right now?
00:31:19.024 - 00:31:47.880, Speaker A: I think it's interesting that Eigen layer acquired Rio. That was an interesting mechanic. In terms of restaking, I really like puffer. I think that the team there is, they're NASA scientists at the end of the day, and they've built ethereum public goods. They're very close with Justin Drake, Ethereum foundation. So I think that they also unlock at home staking. They make it so you can do something like two eth or less, and that level gets kind of, like, trimmed down, so it unlocks.
00:31:47.880 - 00:32:10.348, Speaker A: You no longer need to go to, like, I don't have to semi ethelido. I could all do it through puffer in a much more safe, I guess, more decentralized way and not contribute to, like, economic security risks on Ethereum. But I can do it at a very, very low stake than otherwise possible. So, puffer, to me, like, they're technically sound. They're very. I mean, a lot of the rest taking things are very smart. Puffer is very smart, but they also build public goods, the two of those.
00:32:10.348 - 00:32:11.544, Speaker A: I like that marriage.
00:32:12.324 - 00:32:16.704, Speaker D: All right, so, puffer, put that on my radar. Thanks, David. What about yourself, Mirza?
00:32:17.844 - 00:32:50.126, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I'll, first of all, agreed with everything David said. Very fascinated by intents. I think some of the work that anomal is doing, especially because they come out of the cosmos ecosystem, which I think I know the best, like, out of other ecosystems, I think it's very cool. So I think it can actually unlock a lot of value. I think the way I want to approach the question is, what's going to get real users or retail in? So I think the first access point is really the wallet, right. Which I think phantom is starting to solve. We're seeing it continuing to trend in app stores.
00:32:50.126 - 00:33:21.876, Speaker C: Telegram's actually doing really good work with the ton wallet. So that's actually the first point of contact with crypto, which I think people have been trying to solve since the start of crypto. It's okay. We need to make it easier. Will this, like, I don't know, drive up markets? No, but it will actually give users a way to get into products much more easily. Now, what are these products that I think people will be using once they get in via account abstraction or these wallets? A couple of things. I think crypto, if you really want to hone in on it, is about people trying to make money.
00:33:21.876 - 00:33:55.104, Speaker C: We saw that every cycle. Whether or not you think it's DeFi or NFTs, it was just people either speculating or making money from yield. So I'm very curious about these new yield networks that are coming up. I think Athena network, for instance, has interesting promise. Different forms of yield generation that are easy for people to understand, that seem relatively stable. Hopefully doesn't turn out like Tara, of course, is what we're all hoping. But yeah, some of these things will be good, right? Because if you think about a user trying to come in, they come in by the wallet, they automatically see good yield opportunities.
00:33:55.104 - 00:34:22.988, Speaker C: They're getting to trade at much lower cost, which networks like Solana, networks like injective are trying to solve. It makes it much easier for actual users or retail to drive an adoption. So I think it all has to work in a concerted effort. So, on the back end, yes, infra. I think we're doing well in infra, I think. Right. In terms of lowering costs, making speeds better, would the end user really care about much more than that? Probably not.
00:34:22.988 - 00:34:40.969, Speaker C: They just care like low fees, fast feeds. Sorry, low fees and fast feeds. After you achieve that, then you have the wallet access point. After that, you need good yield. And then what's going to drive real retail frenzy? I don't think it's going to be memes. I think memes are transitory. I think they'll always be there.
00:34:40.969 - 00:35:26.374, Speaker C: But I don't think it's enough nfts. I'm not necessarily sure if they're going to make a comeback for now, at least not until crypto prices do better. And then people start to speculate on nfts. Again, I'm very curious about asset tokenization because I think that actually holds a lot of promise, because a lot of retail users, maybe not us in the US, but especially internationally, don't get access to things like stocks. They don't get access to commodities in the same way. Terra, back in the day was trying to solve some of this with products like Mirror, which obviously got dinged by the SEC, but products like that are emerging again in a much more regulated manner. So once we have the better access points and we have better asset tokenization, and better yield, I think you will see real users and real retail frenzy.
00:35:26.374 - 00:35:34.974, Speaker C: So I think basically the TLDR of my answer is we have a bunch of different narratives combined. I don't think it's going to be one narrative alone that's going to really pick up the market.
00:35:35.834 - 00:36:20.750, Speaker D: To your point about asset tokenization coming back, I do tend to agree with you. I was talking to a team that are doing that. They're basically a decentralized CME and they're trying to be as regulated as possible. But they are a Dex, which I thought was a very interesting take because usually the two don't necessarily go hand in hand. But now we're starting to see teams that are trying to be decentralized that are still keeping the regulatory aspect of it top of mind, especially when you're dealing with institutions and trying to bring them on board. You also mentioned something earlier about Tawn Telegram and the ease of onboarding these users. I think I saw for daily active users they surpassed Ethereum.
00:36:20.750 - 00:36:30.074, Speaker D: So I guess my follow up question to you, Mirza, is are we starting to see this divide between Ethereum and some of these other chains? Will Ethereum no longer be the retail chain?
00:36:31.454 - 00:36:57.404, Speaker C: I'll never say that just because I've been in crypto for so long and I'm just married to Ethereum in like a deep way. Injective actually started on Ethereum back in 2018 before we started building our own chain in cosmos. Yes and no. I think a lot of new retail that's coming in without a doubt. They're onboarding by a Solana. They're onboarding via Telegram. They're onboarding by all of these new nifty l ones, like, let's say swe or injective or aptos.
00:36:57.404 - 00:37:51.754, Speaker C: Right? That's all cool. I don't think you can go against Ethereum. Sure, maybe net new retail isn't automatically coming onto Ethereum, but I think Ethereum still has the most mind share out of any other major project, just because all the institutions, all the inflow, in my opinion, all of it is either on bitcoin or Ethereum. Solana is still a distance second, a distant third, and then every other alt l one is buying for like that fourth or fifth spot. So I think, yes, maybe you don't see the same level of retail frenzy on Ethereum as you did in like defi summer 2020 because networks like Solana have emerged. But I think a lot of net new retail does come onto Ethereum because most of these major protocols that you see whether it be restaking, whether it be things like Athena, whether it be things like any new announcement. You see almost all of the time, it's still on Ethereum mainnet or Ethereum adjacent l two or ethereum aligned protocol.
00:37:51.754 - 00:38:04.458, Speaker C: Right. So I don't think you will see a world in which Ethereum doesn't exist, is my opinion. And I say this as someone who, like, lives and breathes objective. I think like Ethereum alignment and Ethereum staying power is important for the industry.
00:38:04.586 - 00:38:33.944, Speaker A: I was gonna say real quick to add on that time angle, I think one of the reasons right now, and like I think Mirza kind of alluded to it was like, right now, the tan wild is very easy to use. They've just onboarded native tether. There's almost 500 million tether on the space right now circulating. So now 900 million users potentially can send borderless payments free between, I don't know, 100 countries or something. And that's a huge unlock. But from the developer angle, what I've seen is that it's not easy. I won't say it's difficult, but it's not easy to build on time right now.
00:38:33.944 - 00:38:58.368, Speaker A: Some of the cataloging and the tooling are not great. And so a lot of projects I've seen in the space have been building L2s and evms that go to Ethereum. No surprise. So I think that is one pain point that the time ecosystem will need to flesh out, and it does kind of point back to Ethereum. So right now, the user experience just maybe not web3 people, like Web 2.5 people all have access to telegram. They have the wallet, they can send payments.
00:38:58.368 - 00:39:16.204, Speaker A: But the people building the Dexs, the more mature borrowing and lending, all these sophisticated protocols that don't really exist yet on time, they're kind of leaning back toward Ethereum. So I think it'll be interesting to see how that plays out and how time becomes EVM adjacent. Or if it does, my sense is it will be. But we're still really early in that design space.
00:39:16.944 - 00:39:32.004, Speaker D: Tang, what are your thoughts on the narratives? Because you put out a lot of content on X, around Deepin, around AI. You have your own research that you do. You write a lot about these narratives. What are your thoughts on what's happening on that front?
00:39:33.304 - 00:40:25.830, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think my personal mind space has been a lot on AI, both within and within crypto and also outside of crypto. I think it's very clear to everyone that AI as well as crypto, are probably the two biggest technology paradigm changes for this decade and potentially the next few decades as well. And I think there's going to be a natural intersection between these two very powerful technology changes. I think for sure today, I think we're in a very nascent stage on the crypto AI intersection. Many projects are slapping on AI without actually really understanding the real use case or value of having it on. And they're using it as a narrative to drive interest or drive fundraising for them. The very legit projects are mostly like infrastructure projects.
00:40:25.830 - 00:41:19.784, Speaker E: They are building for allowing verifiable inference to happen, and it would take a while for these infrastructure to actually be built and be used. But I think what's very important to me is that I think fundamentally, the idea is very important, is key. AI is very clearly a very centralizing force. We can see that most of the companies that have the best models, like OpenAI, Amazon, Google, these are all very big, large central companies. And we do need a decentralized force to actually give us a chance to have AI be democratic, be open, and be fair as we advance in this stage. So I think that's something that, to me, from a philosophical point of view, is very important. I think the other thing that's also very clear is that the narrative around crypto and AI is going to continue over the coming months, coming years.
00:41:19.784 - 00:42:11.774, Speaker E: I don't think it's ever going to stop because there's just so much changes and developments in the AI space outside of crypto, and a lot of these headlines and attention will seep back into the crypto space as well. So I don't see it as a narrative that is going to die off anytime soon. And the interesting thing is that there are very few crypto tokens that are actually available for people to softly buy today. There's been a lot of talk about Tao and bitten, sir. Just this week, I think we had a few of these very big, decentralized GPU marketplaces like Ionet and ATA also launch tokens. And I think it's going to be interesting as people start to see this narrative and start to be interested in this narrative, they realize that there actually aren't a lot of tokens to actually invest in on the AI side of things. And that makes it, I think, an interesting spot for someone who's looking at participating in this space.
00:42:12.794 - 00:42:43.212, Speaker D: Yeah, the AI tokens, they kind of get a label of being a meme token in a lot of ways because to your point, ting, they just slap on the AI word and use that to more of like a marketing technique. But bittensor I do like bittensor. I think they have some really interesting applications. I played around with Corcell, which I think you wrote about a few times. It's a decentralized chat GPT. Essentially. It's a little bit slower than the chat GPT that we're all used to, but I think that there's a lot of potential there in.
00:42:43.212 - 00:43:09.424, Speaker D: And to your point, I think the decentralized AI is very much needed in terms of creating economic stability versus the centralized version, where it's essentially designed to minimize job opportunities. So certainly AI is a large part of the future. And so I'm looking forward to staying in contact with you and learning more about your thoughts. Samir, what do you think? Last but not least?
00:43:10.034 - 00:44:32.846, Speaker B: Yeah, no, of course. And again, to just right off of the back of the great other panelists that we have here, AI is great, both on the infrastide and the consumer side. I personally am very excited for the rise of relative AI and autonomous agents. Whether that pertains to things like trading, whether that pertains to things like managing portfolios or just overall running rudimentary tasks or outsourcing a lot of things, I think that's a great entrance for a lot of regular consumers into the space if they can go and trust and see some kind of history based on some agents and see how easy it is to use, because I think fundamentally people are just lazy with the rise of chat GPT, taking over essays and all of education and writing your emails for you, that the PMF is already there and that people would love a solution like this. So I'm going to try and apply AI to whatever I possibly can, and if that's going to get me into web3 and potentially bring me some money, then yeah, sure, go for that, apart from the AI space. So I'm very excited about Deepin, and I think the way to look at Deepin is sort of threefold, right? There's the bespoke deep ins that you can normally look at, which are like the big overarching networks, like the heliums of things. Andrina is another example, another Deepin company that's doing wireless networks for buildings across the nation, purpose driven deep ins, which are stuff that can use generic hardware that don't necessarily have a lot of hardware constraints.
00:44:32.846 - 00:45:24.072, Speaker B: But companies like render is a great example where they do 3d rendering. And they were like, I guess deep in. Before Deepin was a big narrative and a thing. And then lastly, if you look at the commodity deep end, so the decentralized GPU networks all of that stuff. The combination of these three can help bring a lot of adoption, can help bring a lot of interest into the space, because when you have decentralized networks that are providing so many different use cases, all of them, well, not all of them, but a good amount of them will probably have some element of a token behind the network, some sort of economic incentive or some sort of node to help run that and process things on that network. If you have people that are getting onboarded, for example, into a wireless network or a mobile network for that particular purpose, and there's some economic incentives associated with that, either you get to share your bandwidth, or you get to participate from different nodes and get some sort of token reward from that. That's a great way to onboard into crypto.
00:45:24.072 - 00:46:33.810, Speaker B: I think that from there, you can start to learn a bit more, and you can start to learn and see what you can do with these assets. You can then tap into defi and start to look at, okay, how can I actually make everything that I'm doing here the most capital efficient it possibly can be? And then you start to go down the rabbit hole from there to go back very quickly to the earlier point about Ethereum and so on. I think Ethereum is so tapped in and so ingrained into every part of most onboarding flows that we see within crypto, whether that's from exchanges or whether that's from wallets. And so you will always sort of get that as a big entry. But if you start to then change the entry point and change the onboarding flow of how people get to know about crypto, or like different aspects about crypto and onboard onto it, whether it's through the deep end angle, whether it's through the tradfi buying securities on chain angle, because you can't do that within your own country, or whether it's through the autonomous AI agent angle, here we're just seeing a bunch of different onboarding paths for people into crypto, as opposed to just the regular monetary incentive of let me go download Coinbase, so let me go download finance as an exchange, and let me go and try to trade from there. These are where you start to see actual very cool use cases that extend beyond the monetary incentives and beyond that capital appreciation part. So a lot of things to look at, it's multifaceted.
00:46:33.810 - 00:46:54.454, Speaker B: There's never going to be one single narrative. Meme coins are going to be transcendental. As Mirza said, meme coins always suck up a lot of liquidity and get a lot of attention when there's not much other things happening. That's what we're seeing right now. Eventually, when some of these other networks, when some of these other AI agents and companies take off because of the development that's going on through them, then hopefully we get to start to see a shift in where liquidity moves because that's where attention starts to go.
00:46:55.434 - 00:47:00.694, Speaker D: Sameer, you mentioned on the deep end side, are there any specific names that you're looking at right now?
00:47:02.594 - 00:47:39.256, Speaker B: So there are like a few companies that are raising at the moment. I mean like one deep end port code that we have is called Protea Labs decentralized compute network, but running for AI models. There's a ton of those out there. They have a very, very big network of h 100s, which is a hard commodity to come by these days. I mentioned very briefly another company called Adrena. They're doing really cool stuff on the wireless network space for basically allowing people to use their spare bandwidth and share that bandwidth with others to save on wireless network costs, both from a landlord real estate perspective, but then also from a consumer perspective, if you have a house, set up an antenna and go from there. But a lot of these are still very hardware intensive.
00:47:39.256 - 00:48:14.814, Speaker B: The barrier to entry is a little bit difficult and it's going to be a slow moving process regardless, with any new technology that's trying to disrupt incumbents, whether that's in the wireless network space, whether that's in the compute space for running AI models, generating AI agents, or whether that's in very bespoke 3d modeling, 3d rendering, VR, ar, all of that stuff to support those applications, like with the vision pro coming out, there's so many different things to look at here. And so there's a lot of exciting new companies trying to innovate in each of those spaces and named a few names. But regardless, always keeping an eye out and always just trying to see whats out there and see what we can support best.
00:48:15.114 - 00:48:34.234, Speaker D: Preston, my last question is just want to have a little bit of fun with this one. What is your bold prediction for the rest of the market? It could be about meme coins, it could be about whats happening on ejectiv or whats happening on Solana, anything thats top of mind that you think. You know what? I know I may sound crazy when I think this, but theres a chance.
00:48:34.274 - 00:49:06.466, Speaker A: That this could happen to me. One thing that jumps out is I think there will be a competitor to some of the incumbent stablecoin providers. Tether dominates the market. They have 70% of all market share maybe 72 now. And then there's USDC, but I think that there is some incoming challengers. One of them that gets me really excited is M zero, which raised a ton of money from Pantera the last few rounds. But they're building basically any institution that can get white labeled, can submit a collateral asset to the protocol and then mint the stable coin.
00:49:06.466 - 00:49:43.656, Speaker A: The idea is that it doesn't become fragmented. All these institutions, like a Goldman or a Citi or whoever, hedge funds, they can mint, they get white listed, they can mint these assets that are ubiquitous and that they're not fragmented, and then they can deploy them. So that, to me, gets me really, really excited. It has a flavor of the centralization that tether doesn't have and it has a little bit more stringencies that maybe are, sorry, it's a little bit more decentralized than USDC, but it has a little more stringencies that tether might not have. And then you have another one called Yala, which is building on bitcoin. We looked at a ton of different projects in the space that are building on bitcoin. Like a lot of the L2s, I think they're very interesting, but I think the use cases might be limited.
00:49:43.656 - 00:50:03.602, Speaker A: To me, the big unlock for bitcoin, a lot of people don't want to sell it. They've had it for decades or like a decade plus. They don't want to sell it, but they want to get some form of liquidity from it. I don't think the L2 path to me is that interesting. I think that happens, but it's not like the volume that everyone thinks. To me, the unlock is the initiation of a stable coin. And Yala is one of the better designs I've seen in the space.
00:50:03.602 - 00:50:23.934, Speaker A: It's very similar to how maker works, but long story short, it allows you to keep your bitcoin and mint stable coins that go back to that, that are linked to that asset as correlated capital and then spend it however you want another opportunity. So the incoming incumbents to tether, USDC, and then unlocking bitcoin, stablecoin liquidity, are super, super interesting to me.
00:50:24.474 - 00:50:27.338, Speaker D: Tether is ginormous though, so it's going to be hard.
00:50:27.386 - 00:50:34.104, Speaker A: I know, I know I'm crazy, but I think that there is a chance. I think right now is probably the chance. If it doesn't happen now, then it's probably forget about it.
00:50:34.924 - 00:50:42.944, Speaker D: Well, that's why it's a bold prediction, right? So I love it. Love it, David. And you have the alpha to back it up. So thanks so much for sharing. What about you, Mirza?
00:50:43.964 - 00:51:16.082, Speaker C: Yeah, hot takes, right? No, I like David's take too. Another cool stable coin I really like is called agoric. Sorry, Agora. I think. I think that one can be quite cool as well, just because it's made by one of the members of the Vanak family. And I just think it's very cool to see people try to go up against Heather or circle a couple takes. I think the first one is, I think people have been so obsessed with EVM that people forget that other vms have succeeded and are succeeding, such as the Solana VM, in my opinion.
00:51:16.082 - 00:52:05.176, Speaker C: So I think you'll see a rise of sort of this multi VM world where, yes, I think EVM will continue to dominate, maybe in the the current paradigm we're in, but you will see interesting applications emerge on other VM layers, whether that be SVM or WASM for Cosmos or even move that you couldn't necessarily do on EVM. So I think you will see that, and I think you'll see people call us around the fact that a multi Vm world can exist similarly to how you have iOS and Android, and both of those can coexist and you have different user bases for each one. My second hot take is, I think, bitcoin l two s are just a narrative. I still, to this day, don't know why we need so many of them. I think it was mainly like an airdrop farming tactic. None of them really had much staying power. Yeah, I know I'll get a lot of pitchforks for that one, but.
00:52:05.176 - 00:52:35.990, Speaker C: Yeah, I just don't get it. I don't know why that's necessary. I guess the next one is, I think as election cycles approach, you'll see prediction markets make a huge comeback again. That's why you see, like, just people betting on who's going to win, et cetera. I think that's going to become much easier. I think you'll see that embedded into wallet interfaces such as, let's say, event on or phantom, because I think that might actually drive a lot of regional traction. I think in the normal world, you see a lot of money being spent on draftkings and sports betting and etcetera.
00:52:35.990 - 00:53:19.912, Speaker C: You haven't really seen that emerge on chain in a big way. Some have come and gone, but nothing that has sort of stayed its power. And my last one is just because this is near and dear to my heart, is around perps. So I think perps had a huge moment in 2020. Since then, we haven't seen a lot of innovation around perps, but I think this year you will see people starting to long and short, even meme coins or like 100 x leverage short, like Biden or Trump winning the election. I think that will actually drive a lot of Degen retail frenzy and I think we'll start to see products along those lines. So election adjacent products prediction markets per people being able to long and short iggy azalea tokens, I think that'd be cool.
00:53:19.912 - 00:53:29.488, Speaker C: And I think whether or not you're a fan of it, I'm not sure, but I think it will drive retail traction in a way we might not have seen before.
00:53:29.656 - 00:53:56.924, Speaker D: And it's hard to hate that narrative. It's hard to dislike meme coins when they are the reason why a lot of retails do come into crypto. And even if it's just investing in a dumb token, they lose all their money. If it's a gateway for them to learn about the actual technology and all the amazing stuff that's happening, then I feel like it, in a way it serves its purpose, although sometimes it's an expensive way to learn. But yeah, good takes Mirza. How about you, Ting?
00:53:59.224 - 00:54:28.634, Speaker E: Yeah, a lot of interesting things here. I'm just going to be very brief. I think two things come to my mind. One is that I think ton and telegram probably outperforms Solana, at least from a price perspective. I think it comes from a very different place that we are very used to. It takes a very different approach in terms of the kind of products that enables, and I think it's this very left view thing that enables, that potentially allows it to create some very creative and very interesting soft products. So I think that's one.
00:54:28.634 - 00:55:10.998, Speaker E: I think the other is, I think we're going to see a comeback of older previous cycle projects that basically have most of the tokens already unlocked. And these are going to outperform the current new projects that are the typical high ftv, low float kind of like tokens. So these will be potentially things like, say, the very OG ethereum defi projects. I think arweave is very interesting because recently it's also come back and is launching this AO computer, which is this new way of doing things using parallel computing, but not in the typical shared global state. So that manner. So I think that's also very interesting to see some of these old projects actually come back to life again.
00:55:11.126 - 00:55:23.294, Speaker D: Yeah, I want to thank you all for taking the time to talk about different narratives, where we are in the market. It was a really fun conversation. You guys put a lot of hard work into your research, and I'm looking forward to having you back on eventually, so thanks so much.
