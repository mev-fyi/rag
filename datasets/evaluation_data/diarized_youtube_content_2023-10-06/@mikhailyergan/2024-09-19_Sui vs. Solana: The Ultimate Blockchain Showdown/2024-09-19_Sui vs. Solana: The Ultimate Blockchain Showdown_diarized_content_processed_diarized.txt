00:00:00.320 - 00:00:39.805, Speaker A: Over the past few years, we've all witnessed the massive success of Solana. It became a top layer one blockchain in what appears to be record time, thanks to innovations like DEFI NFTs and the scalability. But today we're going to ask the big question. Can SUI replicate this success or will it fall short? Let's discuss before we dive in. None of this is financial advice. Always do your own research when making investment decisions. And as always, my work on this channel is completely separate from my work at Certik, so all views are my own.
00:00:39.805 - 00:01:21.995, Speaker A: Now. Both blockchains have ambitious goals, but they're at different stages. And so, for the purpose of this presentation, we're going to explore how Sui, 16 months after its launch, compares to where Solana was at the same point. Can Sui match Solana's rise or are the challenges just too great? Let's dive in first from a timeline comparison. As we know, Solana launched in March of 2020, and by late 2021, it was already making a lot of headlines in the market. Sui, however, is much younger. Launched in May 2023.
00:01:21.995 - 00:02:11.685, Speaker A: We are now comparing these networks at a similar stage of growth, around 16 to 18 months in. Solana's early success was driven by its proof of history innovation enabling fast transaction speeds. Sui, on the other hand, is leveraging its object oriented architecture for parallel processing and scalability. This difference in approach could be a differentiating factor in the way that they grow. So let's take a look at the total value locked, a critical metric for evaluating the value flowing through decentralized applications. Solana hit an impressive 10 billion in TVL within the first 18 months. A lot of that was driven by Defi explosion.
00:02:11.685 - 00:02:50.113, Speaker A: Sui, on the other hand, at 16 months, has about 327 million in TBL. While smaller, it's a significant start given the different market conditions that we're in right now. Some key innovations that make both of these blockchains unique. So, on the Solana side, with their proof of history, that allowed Solana to process thousands of transactions per second. But. But as we all know, it also experienced many network outages. Sui, as mentioned, uses its object oriented architecture to process transactions in parallel.
00:02:50.113 - 00:03:24.657, Speaker A: That makes it scalable for things like gaming and defi. Solana emphasizes speed, while Sui is more focused on scalability and security. Both ecosystems have experienced strong growth, but in different areas. For Solana, projects like Serum and Raydium were crucial in powering its early defi boom. Now, keep in mind, again, we're talking about Solana during its Infancy days. We're not talking about Solana right now. Sui, meanwhile, is focusing on tools and DEFI for scalable user friendly growth.
00:03:24.657 - 00:04:11.421, Speaker A: They have the Sui name service which makes blockchain more accessible, while Cetus, a leading Defi protocol on sui, is driving liquidity provision on the platform. So it appears that SUI is building a foundation that is similar to how Solana built its early Defi dominance. From a tokenomics perspective, both networks have faced challenges. For solana, they allocated 25% of its tokens to early contributors. That caused concerns about sell pressure, but its 2021 DeFi boom really helped offset those fears for SUI. With 14% allocated to early, investors experienced a major unlock of 83.88 million tokens on September 3, 2024.
00:04:11.421 - 00:04:49.655, Speaker A: So far our sell pressure has been minimal. In fact, you know we've seen the increase in the price of Sui. There could be some strategic holding by investors. Both chains have had to carefully manage their releases to maintain market stability. As far as the price goes, we're seeing two different stories here. Solana experienced a 50x surge during 2021. They jumped from about $5 to over 250 and again a lot of that was driven by DEFI and NFT boom, while SUI saw a more modest 50% increase in August 2024.
00:04:49.655 - 00:05:26.105, Speaker A: Much of that was boosted by the grayscale SUI Trust and other developments. While slower, sui's growth has been more steady and sustainable. Solana saw explosive early demand while SUI is taking a more gradual approach. The other thing to note here is about the key partnerships. Solana obviously faced a lot of turmoil with their collaborations with ftx. SUI has secured partnerships with Grayscale, launching the SUI Trust. So there's a lot of similarities here.
00:05:26.105 - 00:06:21.225, Speaker A: Obviously I'm not comparing grayscale to ftx. We don't really know what the future holds. But both have made strides in securing partnerships. So the big question remains, can Sui replicate Solana success? Solana grew rapidly back capitalizing on DeFi and NFTs, though it faced significant technical challenges, while Sui, growing more slowly, is building a solid foundation in GameFi and DeFi, with an emphasis on scalability and user accessibility. So whether SUI can match Solana's rise remains to be seen, but its strategic partnerships and focus on growth areas like Defi suggest it's on the right path. Thanks so much for joining me in this deep dive into Solana and sui. I'd love to hear your feedback on this new format, so please leave a comment below with your thoughts.
