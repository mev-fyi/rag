00:00:00.250 - 00:00:20.654, Speaker A: The difference between the projects that fail and the project make it are that the project that make it persisted. They stuck around. They did the work, you know, and so that's why we're here through the bear market. I mean, it's it's been a very difficult time to raise funds to do some of the things that we've had to do, but we're in it. You know, we believe in what we're doing. What we're doing needs to occur. Somebody has to create a catalyst for change of sustainability in the market.
00:00:20.654 - 00:00:35.830, Speaker A: We can't keep turning over products like this and asking institutional investors to take it seriously. So we sat down and we went through with a fine tooth home and found all of the points where we felt like we had to add redundancies or fail safes, different things, to make sure that this is 100% safe and not exploitable.
