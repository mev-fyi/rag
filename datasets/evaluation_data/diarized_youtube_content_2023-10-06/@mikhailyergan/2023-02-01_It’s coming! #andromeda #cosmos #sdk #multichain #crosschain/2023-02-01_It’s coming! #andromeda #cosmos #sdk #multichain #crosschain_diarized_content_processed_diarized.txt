00:00:00.090 - 00:00:51.980, Speaker A: Andromeda is really like. Everyone knows about the Andromeda system. It is a completely new, large scale project that is going to be game changing for the crypto industry and specifically inside the cosmos ecosystem. We're bringing together a new paradigm for developers and builders, and it will eventually mean for projects and companies that will have to have a new understanding of what can be done, and we'll make it easier for them to understand that at a technical level. I'm going to pass it off to Brendan to talk about what that really means at the technical level. From the business level. It means that finally businesses are going to be able to understand web3 and what business opportunities they have of the Andromeda operating system.
