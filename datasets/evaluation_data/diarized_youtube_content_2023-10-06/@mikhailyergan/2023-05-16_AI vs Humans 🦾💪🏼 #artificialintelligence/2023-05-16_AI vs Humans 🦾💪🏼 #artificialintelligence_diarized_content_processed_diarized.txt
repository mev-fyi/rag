00:00:00.170 - 00:00:04.794, Speaker A: So do you think that AI could ever replicate human intelligence?
00:00:04.922 - 00:00:34.050, Speaker B: Machines or AIs, they are useful tools to help us solve problems, but they're not going to have their motions attached. And I don't think they'll ever have the creativity that we as individuals input into anything that we do, the understanding. To be honest, I think we're far from it. I don't think they'll ever be able to replicate humans. They'll be more useful to humans, as in being able to simplify our lives and processes.
