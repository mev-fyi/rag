00:00:00.250 - 00:00:03.038, Speaker A: I like those glasses, by the way. I don't feel like.
00:00:03.124 - 00:00:06.458, Speaker B: Do you wear glasses? I feel like this is the first time I'm seeing you in glasses.
00:00:06.554 - 00:00:20.634, Speaker C: Yeah, it's definitely like a newer thing. I've not been, like, a glasses guy. I used to be a glasses guy, did contacts for a long time, and now I just kind of do both. Whatever I'm feeling that day, I literally.
00:00:20.682 - 00:00:25.670, Speaker B: Just switched out my glasses for contacts. So we just did the swapper rue.
00:00:26.490 - 00:00:29.798, Speaker C: There it is. I just need to get my camera set up a little better, though, because.
00:00:29.804 - 00:00:32.726, Speaker A: I don't like where it's trying to.
00:00:32.748 - 00:00:37.794, Speaker B: Read all the messages in your background. A box as rewarding as an archway.
00:00:37.842 - 00:00:38.242, Speaker A: Dap.
00:00:38.306 - 00:00:42.170, Speaker B: Oh, nice. Okay, so you guys are coming out with some swag?
00:00:42.510 - 00:00:51.306, Speaker C: We actually are, but that's not exactly what that is. We're actually building out, like, a merch store that we're going to have in.
00:00:51.328 - 00:00:54.186, Speaker A: House to list and buy merch.
00:00:54.298 - 00:01:00.154, Speaker C: But this is actually just like, something they sent to some of the core contributors as, like, a thank you after we launched.
00:01:00.202 - 00:01:06.206, Speaker A: So there's like a water bottle, a hat, a couple of t shirts, socks.
00:01:06.238 - 00:01:08.786, Speaker C: And even things like little trinkets, kind of like this.
00:01:08.888 - 00:01:12.354, Speaker A: It's like gold archway token. Nice. Yeah.
00:01:12.392 - 00:01:19.334, Speaker C: Just some minor stuff to show some love to us, to the guys who are grinding for the last guys and girls who've been grinding for the last.
00:01:19.372 - 00:01:20.854, Speaker A: Couple of years on this. Yeah.
00:01:20.892 - 00:01:43.280, Speaker B: And I'm sure it's probably no slowdown. Right. We're seeing an uptick in the market. I think last time we talked, I think we were, like, in the mid 20s. Now we're in the believe. How has that been going for you? With the market picking up? Does that mean you have more work to do?
00:01:43.970 - 00:01:54.458, Speaker C: Yeah, no, it definitely means a lot more work, and it's noticeable in engagement, but also just the amount of teams who are now reengaging with protocols.
00:01:54.554 - 00:01:58.222, Speaker A: I've had numerous protocols or application teams.
00:01:58.286 - 00:02:08.902, Speaker C: Reach out in the last, I'd say a couple of weeks to kind of reengage on all sorts of things, whether it's partnership or grants, what have you. But, yeah, there's definitely that renewed interest.
00:02:09.036 - 00:02:10.374, Speaker A: Is kind of back.
00:02:10.572 - 00:02:12.582, Speaker C: Whether it's temporary or not, I don't know.
00:02:12.636 - 00:02:22.554, Speaker A: But anecdotally, I've had a few friends who have not mentioned much of crypto in the last four or five months who are now kind of talking about.
00:02:22.592 - 00:02:23.850, Speaker C: It again, which is a good sign.
00:02:23.920 - 00:02:30.554, Speaker A: Because they were involved quite a bit and then kind of slowly stepped away as it got pretty bad.
00:02:30.752 - 00:02:35.306, Speaker C: But I still have not heard any of my normal friends who don't touch crypto.
00:02:35.338 - 00:02:37.838, Speaker A: Really? They haven't mentioned anything yet, which to.
00:02:37.844 - 00:02:39.434, Speaker C: Me is like a huge green flag.
00:02:39.482 - 00:02:42.334, Speaker A: Because if the main public isn't already.
00:02:42.372 - 00:02:44.618, Speaker C: Talking about, oh, wow, bitcoin's flying, even.
00:02:44.644 - 00:02:55.746, Speaker A: Though it's up, like, two x from its lows, and even, what? It's probably up 5% over the last 14 days, whatever, last month, and no one says anything. That's good.
00:02:55.848 - 00:02:57.474, Speaker C: That means that we're not at the.
00:02:57.512 - 00:03:00.750, Speaker A: Euphoria stage, even though my timeline feels like it.
00:03:00.840 - 00:03:03.426, Speaker C: And maybe it's because the cosmos has kind of just been on a tear.
00:03:03.458 - 00:03:10.598, Speaker A: As well, but I think it's just because my timeline is made up of all the people who've been active here the last year while it's been dead.
00:03:10.774 - 00:03:17.930, Speaker C: And yet the normal users who are casual still have no idea that the market's kind of rebounding.
00:03:18.350 - 00:03:30.480, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree that once it gets to the point where you're getting a phone call from somebody that never talks about crypto, that's when you start pulling out.
00:03:32.450 - 00:03:42.674, Speaker C: Seriously, though, it's hard, because I remember last run towards the peak, I was getting so many top signals everywhere. It was so obvious that it was a top.
00:03:42.792 - 00:03:51.414, Speaker A: But you mean outside of the technical analysis, right. Qualitative, I'd say.
00:03:51.452 - 00:03:54.470, Speaker C: Like, just people talking about bitcoin.
00:03:54.970 - 00:03:56.406, Speaker A: People are saying, my grandma asked me.
00:03:56.428 - 00:04:00.294, Speaker C: About bitcoin type stuff that was actually happening where I was having people.
00:04:00.332 - 00:04:02.610, Speaker A: I'm like, you don't even know how.
00:04:02.620 - 00:04:09.530, Speaker C: To download an app. What are you worried about crypto? This isn't relevant to you. Why is this even on your radar?
00:04:10.190 - 00:04:12.094, Speaker A: But I kind of took it as.
00:04:12.212 - 00:04:13.642, Speaker C: Oh, this is adoption.
00:04:13.706 - 00:04:18.798, Speaker A: This is what adoption looks like. It was hard to separate the two.
00:04:18.884 - 00:04:20.206, Speaker C: Is this a top signal, or is.
00:04:20.228 - 00:04:28.574, Speaker A: This adoption, like the Super bowl commercials? Clear, top signal in hindsight. But at the time, I was like, holy crap.
00:04:28.702 - 00:04:30.158, Speaker C: We're to the point now where we're.
00:04:30.174 - 00:04:32.206, Speaker A: Putting these on the Super bowl commercials.
00:04:32.238 - 00:04:37.278, Speaker C: And people are okay with that? They're not, like, immediately going to like, oh, this is criminals.
00:04:37.374 - 00:04:43.366, Speaker A: This is illegal. It's like you have Tom Brady being like, no, this is legit. So I was like, wow, maybe we.
00:04:43.388 - 00:04:45.570, Speaker C: Are actually just getting adoption. It's not top signals.
00:04:45.650 - 00:04:46.520, Speaker B: We made.
00:04:48.330 - 00:04:53.782, Speaker A: Very wrong with every cycle.
00:04:53.846 - 00:04:58.282, Speaker B: I think there's a learning experience. And to your point, I think looking.
00:04:58.336 - 00:05:03.494, Speaker A: Back at what we went through, in.
00:05:03.552 - 00:05:32.546, Speaker B: A lot of ways, we were excited. Right? Like, you feel proud because you're. You're part of this movement. And you. You see these commercials when you're gathered around with your friends watching the Super bowl and nobody's in crypto except you. You just feel like a proud dad, right? Yeah, but, yeah, definitely a signal. And actually, I saw a kraken commercial on a football game the other day, so I'm already nervous.
00:05:32.738 - 00:05:33.094, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:05:33.132 - 00:05:35.106, Speaker A: And it kind of feels like it's.
00:05:35.298 - 00:05:37.094, Speaker C: Like we're right in that tipping point.
00:05:37.132 - 00:05:39.286, Speaker A: Of like, is this the beginning of.
00:05:39.308 - 00:05:40.682, Speaker C: The next bull run, or is this.
00:05:40.736 - 00:05:45.098, Speaker A: Kind of another choppy kind of step.
00:05:45.184 - 00:05:53.326, Speaker C: In that right direction? But we're going to have a chop right back down to a lower level. Because if there's one thing you learn in general about this space, it's like.
00:05:53.348 - 00:05:55.962, Speaker A: History, especially in crypto.
00:05:56.106 - 00:05:58.346, Speaker C: It rhymes, but it does not repeat.
00:05:58.458 - 00:06:02.270, Speaker A: So this bull run, if it's coming.
00:06:02.340 - 00:06:14.498, Speaker C: It'S like there's going to be something else, a different narrative, a different sector that's going to go off. And it's like you can't just assume it's going to be all the layer ones or all whatever it was last cycle. So it's interesting because it's hard to.
00:06:14.504 - 00:06:16.754, Speaker A: Tell sometimes if it's like, hey, is.
00:06:16.792 - 00:06:20.834, Speaker C: This just like a bull trap? Or is this like a changing in the guard?
00:06:20.882 - 00:06:23.510, Speaker A: And there's actually a new narrative now.
00:06:23.580 - 00:06:25.366, Speaker C: That people are willing to invest into.
00:06:25.468 - 00:06:27.320, Speaker A: Which will drive the next bull market.
00:06:28.010 - 00:06:35.194, Speaker C: So that's the thing. I'm just trying to figure out what is that next narrative? Because it seemed like social Phi was kind of the narrative for a little.
00:06:35.232 - 00:06:37.980, Speaker A: Bit, but it kind of faded out pretty quickly.
00:06:38.510 - 00:06:40.154, Speaker C: And now it's just kind of back.
00:06:40.192 - 00:06:44.926, Speaker A: To what will the next catalyst be? Or maybe there doesn't need to be.
00:06:44.948 - 00:06:50.218, Speaker C: A specific one because it's something like regulation, because of what happened with SPF recently.
00:06:50.314 - 00:06:52.158, Speaker A: To me, that's a huge win for.
00:06:52.164 - 00:06:54.414, Speaker C: The entire crypto market because it shows.
00:06:54.612 - 00:07:00.514, Speaker A: Hey, first off, we agree this is a bad actor. And two, if this was actually on.
00:07:00.552 - 00:07:04.338, Speaker C: Chain like we see blockchain working, this actually wouldn't have been possible because we.
00:07:04.344 - 00:07:08.134, Speaker A: Would see where everything was going. So to me, it's like having him.
00:07:08.172 - 00:07:13.794, Speaker C: Be found guilty and put in prison and punished for circumventing what makes blockchain.
00:07:13.842 - 00:07:29.706, Speaker A: Great, and also for just committing straight fraud, taking crypto out of it, and just saying this is fraud, to me, means a lot, because now you can separate FTX from blockchain and what actually is happening to decentralize anything like an.
00:07:29.728 - 00:07:34.970, Speaker C: Asset or even just have self custody on that he got punished.
00:07:35.310 - 00:08:10.250, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. And to your point, what he was doing, that wasn't necessarily blockchain. He supposedly was regulated, but everything that he was doing malicious was in the background, and nobody could really track that. Versus Elizabeth Warren is blaming crypto for a lot of the war crimes in terms of funding terrorism. And somebody looked at the on chain data, they're like, well, actually, you're way off. But she doesn't know how to look at that kind of information. Right.
00:08:10.250 - 00:08:20.406, Speaker B: She doesn't understand how transparent and open blockchain technology is and how everything can be verified just by looking at it.
00:08:20.528 - 00:08:30.746, Speaker C: No, to your point, I've seen similar statistics where it shows all on chain activity versus known criminal activity, and it's.
00:08:30.778 - 00:08:33.342, Speaker A: Like fractions of a percent or maybe.
00:08:33.396 - 00:08:47.954, Speaker C: A percent or two. And it's like, well, yeah, that happens in any sort of remittance platform. There's going to be laundering, period. It's like if we cared about laundering money that much and ways of doing it well, it's happening in our regular banking system. We literally have some of the biggest.
00:08:48.002 - 00:08:52.520, Speaker A: Institutions in the banking system helping them.
00:08:52.970 - 00:08:58.566, Speaker C: Circumvent anti money laundering laws. It's like Deutsche bank has been busted.
00:08:58.598 - 00:09:07.610, Speaker A: Like, how many times? For financing all sorts of money laundering activities, or Wells Fargo.
00:09:07.950 - 00:09:11.642, Speaker C: These are major banks who have committed these crimes over and over again.
00:09:11.776 - 00:09:13.582, Speaker A: It's known, yeah, we paid a fine.
00:09:13.636 - 00:09:14.574, Speaker C: Sorry about it.
00:09:14.692 - 00:09:16.894, Speaker A: And that's just like you keep moving.
00:09:16.932 - 00:09:18.734, Speaker C: On to the world, but we draw.
00:09:18.772 - 00:09:22.266, Speaker A: The line of crypto, where it's actually verifiable and traceable.
00:09:22.458 - 00:09:23.906, Speaker C: If you're the government, you should be.
00:09:23.928 - 00:09:26.050, Speaker A: Hoping people are money laundering on chain.
00:09:26.550 - 00:09:28.398, Speaker C: Because it'll be the easiest investigation you've.
00:09:28.414 - 00:09:30.130, Speaker A: Ever had on money laundering.
00:09:32.470 - 00:09:35.620, Speaker B: If it's like bitcoin, right? I mean, obviously not getting.
00:09:37.850 - 00:09:44.914, Speaker A: In my opinion, Monero is the only way you're going to be able to transact privately.
00:09:44.962 - 00:09:47.374, Speaker C: And money launder in a way that's.
00:09:47.442 - 00:09:53.334, Speaker A: Not very easily identifiable. Outside of that, there's so many vulnerabilities.
00:09:53.382 - 00:09:57.846, Speaker C: And so many different privacy protocols, even with secret network.
00:09:57.878 - 00:10:14.286, Speaker A: Right. They had that white hat kind of hacker that basically broke open the enclave for all data pre, the patch they recently put on. So basically, there's an SGX enclave, which is like hardware that they were able.
00:10:14.308 - 00:10:15.678, Speaker C: To break, which then allowed them to.
00:10:15.684 - 00:10:18.110, Speaker A: See all past data, like unencrypted.
00:10:18.190 - 00:10:20.034, Speaker C: So now you can literally say nothing.
00:10:20.072 - 00:10:23.586, Speaker A: Before Xdate was private. Right? So I feel like a lot of.
00:10:23.608 - 00:10:29.378, Speaker C: These protocols have these type of vulnerabilities. They're just not exploited yet. But when the time comes where the.
00:10:29.384 - 00:10:31.894, Speaker A: US government wants to, they're probably going to exploit them.
00:10:32.012 - 00:10:36.054, Speaker C: Monero is kind of unique in the sense, like, the government's been trying for a long time.
00:10:36.092 - 00:10:45.658, Speaker A: It's just they can put together some pieces. Like if you're sending chunks of stuff across in the same amount, they can.
00:10:45.664 - 00:10:50.794, Speaker C: Start to piece together different things, like the bytes and size of packets, things.
00:10:50.832 - 00:10:53.214, Speaker A: Like that, to try and figure stuff out.
00:10:53.332 - 00:10:54.654, Speaker C: But even then, it's like you can.
00:10:54.692 - 00:11:00.446, Speaker A: Get close, but you can never verify. So to that point, unless it's on.
00:11:00.468 - 00:11:11.454, Speaker C: Monero, you're really just making it really easy for people to track you down. You're almost like giving the government a layup when that time comes. So I'm not sure why government is becoming smarter and smarter.
00:11:11.502 - 00:11:12.002, Speaker A: Right?
00:11:12.136 - 00:11:19.218, Speaker B: The founders of Safemoon got busted. The government is getting smarter. They're beefing up their departments.
00:11:19.394 - 00:11:20.838, Speaker A: They're catching up.
00:11:21.004 - 00:11:23.446, Speaker C: Yeah. And they're going after actual criminals, like.
00:11:23.468 - 00:11:25.190, Speaker A: The people who just blatantly.
00:11:27.770 - 00:11:30.406, Speaker C: Did fraud. There's no other really way to put.
00:11:30.428 - 00:11:33.994, Speaker A: It, because there was no actual point.
00:11:34.032 - 00:11:35.498, Speaker C: Where they were trying to run a real business.
00:11:35.584 - 00:11:42.974, Speaker A: It was like, hey, how fast can we, like, with safemoon specifically, they were internally talking about like, hey, how soon.
00:11:43.012 - 00:11:44.350, Speaker C: Should we rug the.
00:11:44.500 - 00:11:49.054, Speaker A: Like, how soon should we pull the money? And, like, that, to me, is just.
00:11:49.172 - 00:11:51.166, Speaker C: So malicious that you have to go.
00:11:51.188 - 00:11:58.290, Speaker A: Punish them, especially when they do what Safemoon did, which was become a public.
00:11:58.360 - 00:12:01.090, Speaker C: Figure for crypto at one point. They're one of the most talked about.
00:12:01.160 - 00:12:03.634, Speaker A: Especially in social media.
00:12:03.832 - 00:12:07.166, Speaker C: They were just getting a lot of traction from influencers. I'm sure they're paying them to tweet.
00:12:07.198 - 00:12:09.682, Speaker A: About it, and then therefore, you're getting a lot of retail.
00:12:09.826 - 00:12:11.078, Speaker C: And this actually brings me back to.
00:12:11.084 - 00:12:12.870, Speaker A: What I was saying before with top signals.
00:12:13.290 - 00:12:15.414, Speaker C: Two of my friends who, they're just.
00:12:15.452 - 00:12:19.954, Speaker A: Like the least crypto friendly people ever.
00:12:20.012 - 00:12:23.638, Speaker C: They, one don't understand it. They don't really mess with it, don't.
00:12:23.654 - 00:12:27.260, Speaker A: Really get the purpose, but they bought safemoon. I'm just like.
00:12:29.070 - 00:12:32.234, Speaker C: What kind of research are you doing? What's going on in your brain that.
00:12:32.272 - 00:12:43.850, Speaker A: Led you to, you don't like anything about crypto, but this is the one. And that's kind of like what I was talking about earlier, where those are like the normies. And when they start hearing about it, it's like a top signal, but it.
00:12:43.860 - 00:12:46.354, Speaker C: Also just shows how much marketing and.
00:12:46.392 - 00:12:49.634, Speaker A: Influence can actually trick people, especially the.
00:12:49.672 - 00:12:51.698, Speaker C: Not educated retail, into buying some of.
00:12:51.704 - 00:12:53.950, Speaker A: The most obvious scammy coins.
00:12:54.110 - 00:12:56.226, Speaker C: And now you see, thankfully, they're getting.
00:12:56.248 - 00:12:58.454, Speaker A: Busted for it because this was about.
00:12:58.492 - 00:13:14.426, Speaker C: As blatant as a scam as I've ever seen done in plain sight. And then you even have people like Coffeezilla, the YouTuber, who've done six or seven videos on this scam with on chain analysis showing exactly what happened and interviewed the founders, where they basically admitted to a lot of it.
00:13:14.448 - 00:13:17.034, Speaker A: So I was like, why is this.
00:13:17.072 - 00:13:25.694, Speaker C: YouTuber doing all the work? Where are the agencies? Where are they? Why aren't they doing this digging? And maybe they are, right?
00:13:25.892 - 00:13:27.982, Speaker A: But it was almost a year where.
00:13:28.036 - 00:13:30.174, Speaker C: There was hard evidence against them, and.
00:13:30.212 - 00:13:32.318, Speaker A: They'Re just kind of waiting to pursue it.
00:13:32.484 - 00:13:35.458, Speaker C: But I'm glad they did. Ultimately. I'm just glad they did.
00:13:35.624 - 00:13:48.450, Speaker B: We're still ways away from having a very organized way to go after these bad actors. Even if you just. Look, I work in the auditing industry, right. Security auditing.
00:13:48.530 - 00:13:54.054, Speaker A: And it's definitely needed. Right. But do we have anybody that is.
00:13:54.092 - 00:13:56.390, Speaker B: Really telling us what we need to look out for?
00:13:56.540 - 00:13:57.154, Speaker A: We don't.
00:13:57.202 - 00:14:23.478, Speaker B: Right. It's all based on reputation. Reputation of the security firm. If you think about an auditor, for instance, there's auditors for restaurants, right? You get like a health inspection check. You either pass or you fail. Well, that, I'm sure there's a government body that facilitates all that and tells you, okay, here's where you qualify. Here's where you don't.
00:14:23.478 - 00:14:38.078, Speaker B: We don't have that yet in crypto. And, I don't know, maybe eventually we'll get to almost like, here is a checklist. It needs to meet all these criteria, and then that gets pushed to the security firms.
00:14:38.174 - 00:14:53.530, Speaker C: Yeah, well, we need a framework, is what we need. Actually. Kind of funny you brought that up. My previous job, not right before I joined file apps, but even prior to that, my first role out of college was actually an auditor for financial statements for public companies.
00:14:53.600 - 00:14:55.706, Speaker A: So I was a CPA, worked at.
00:14:55.728 - 00:15:02.686, Speaker C: One of the big four firms doing audits of public companies. And, yeah, to your point, it's like the regulating bodies were either like the.
00:15:02.708 - 00:15:06.522, Speaker A: AICPA or the SEC, or the PCAOB.
00:15:06.586 - 00:15:30.594, Speaker C: Is the public company accounting oversight board. So they would be overseeing the public companies, AICPAs over private companies. And the SEC is like the enforcement. Right. So we kind of need something like that, like the PCAOB or the AICPA for blockchains that are very specific to blockchains because they're not like any of the other types of assets or some of these other securities.
00:15:30.722 - 00:15:32.422, Speaker A: Whatever that we've had before.
00:15:32.476 - 00:15:34.662, Speaker C: They're kind of their own class of asset in my eyes.
00:15:34.716 - 00:15:42.074, Speaker A: So I think we have to kind of develop new framework so that auditors have something to go off of to.
00:15:42.112 - 00:15:44.666, Speaker C: Verify certain things that we all can.
00:15:44.688 - 00:15:50.010, Speaker A: Agree are important so that they can attest to them in a way that's actually meaningful.
00:15:50.910 - 00:15:53.266, Speaker C: It's just difficult, especially with smart contracts.
00:15:53.318 - 00:15:57.918, Speaker A: And blockchain, because they can change over time. Like if you want to upgrade a.
00:15:57.924 - 00:16:05.694, Speaker C: Smart contract or if you need to change something that requires an audit every time you change the code. Otherwise that audit is not meaningful anymore.
00:16:05.742 - 00:16:07.794, Speaker A: Because it's on stale code.
00:16:07.912 - 00:16:09.154, Speaker C: So that's a big piece of it, too.
00:16:09.192 - 00:16:11.586, Speaker A: It's just like there's no efficient way.
00:16:11.608 - 00:16:18.982, Speaker C: To do it with people constantly updating things and there's no specific things you should be looking for or checking for.
00:16:19.036 - 00:16:23.686, Speaker A: That are like standard. So you can't really compare across ten.
00:16:23.708 - 00:16:27.446, Speaker C: Different auditors and see who's providing the best opinion or who's most accurate, because.
00:16:27.548 - 00:16:32.218, Speaker A: It'S not a lot of things to compare benchmark against. So I do think that's probably one.
00:16:32.224 - 00:16:45.818, Speaker C: Of the biggest gaps. And I'm hoping this kind of legal stuff going on is going to lead to regulation and ways for us to get comfortable around blockchain audits and smart contract audits so that we can rely.
00:16:45.834 - 00:16:47.886, Speaker A: On these companies a lot more and.
00:16:47.908 - 00:16:56.914, Speaker C: Aren'T subject to just reputation where the reputation might be not warranted. Maybe they're just known, but they don't do great work.
00:16:56.952 - 00:16:58.500, Speaker A: That's something people should know.
00:16:59.030 - 00:17:36.762, Speaker B: Yeah, I think regulation is definitely taking the spotlight right now. Even if you look at Turkey, they suffer from massive inflation and they've been on the faft black or gray list for quite some time now. And they're trying to pass a crypto legislation to salvage that. And even I think in UK, they're trying to pass new rules and regulations. And recently I saw bitco that got approved in Germany, the crypto custodian.
00:17:36.906 - 00:17:42.206, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm familiar with Bitco. I had not heard that. But that is good news that they.
00:17:42.228 - 00:17:50.686, Speaker A: Are willing to work with certain companies. I know UK passed some pretty strict laws on crypto.
00:17:50.878 - 00:17:55.006, Speaker C: I think Germany was similar. So it's good to see that they're.
00:17:55.038 - 00:17:59.054, Speaker A: Just trying to enforce it in a way that's official.
00:17:59.182 - 00:18:00.246, Speaker C: It sounds like as long as you.
00:18:00.268 - 00:18:01.922, Speaker A: Come to them with the proper documents.
00:18:01.986 - 00:18:21.450, Speaker C: And support for what you're trying to do, they'll consider it. And that's good news because. Yeah, I understand that a lot of the ethos of blockchain is decentralization, but ultimately having some regulation over it is, in my opinion, going to help everyone. It's going to be a net benefit. What we need to avoid is over regulation.
00:18:21.870 - 00:18:24.800, Speaker A: Like I think a lot of people would say we have in our current.
00:18:25.970 - 00:18:31.674, Speaker C: Taxation system a lot of overregulation. So finding that happy medium of protecting.
00:18:31.722 - 00:18:35.460, Speaker A: Investors but not handcuffing retail would be nice.
00:18:36.470 - 00:18:49.750, Speaker B: Yeah, and just going back to my point, Max. So Bitco has obtained a crypto custody business license from the german Federal Financial Supervisory authority. So the license was issued on October 24.
00:18:51.530 - 00:19:02.074, Speaker C: That's a win. We'll take any win we can get in this space because it's just we need to continue to move forward, especially working with the government bodies. That's the number one way to get.
00:19:02.112 - 00:19:06.102, Speaker A: Adoption is get one the actual countries.
00:19:06.166 - 00:19:08.378, Speaker C: And nations to want their citizens to.
00:19:08.384 - 00:19:10.538, Speaker A: Use it because they don't want you to use it.
00:19:10.624 - 00:19:12.460, Speaker C: They will make it as difficult as possible.
00:19:12.990 - 00:19:15.546, Speaker A: So step in the right direction for Germany.
00:19:15.578 - 00:19:17.022, Speaker C: And I know they're really innovative place.
00:19:17.076 - 00:19:25.642, Speaker A: And they're going to need a new industry in the next probably couple decades here with their manufacturing industry kind of dwindling.
00:19:25.786 - 00:19:26.978, Speaker C: And that was as far as I.
00:19:26.984 - 00:19:30.242, Speaker A: Know, like their main GDP driver for a long time.
00:19:30.296 - 00:19:36.114, Speaker C: So this could be an opportunity for them to really embrace blockchain and crypto and maybe create a whole new industry.
00:19:36.242 - 00:19:37.590, Speaker A: For the next generation.
00:19:38.250 - 00:19:42.582, Speaker B: Yeah, I know that they've always had very talented engineers and I feel like.
00:19:42.636 - 00:19:46.438, Speaker A: This is the difference between what's happening.
00:19:46.524 - 00:19:57.638, Speaker B: Now like leading up to the next bull market versus what happened last time. I feel like more companies and projects are being proactive when it comes to regulation.
00:19:57.814 - 00:19:59.500, Speaker A: I heard that.
00:20:00.690 - 00:20:30.582, Speaker B: I think it's called backpack, which is a pretty popular Solana project, actually. They're coming out with a fully regulated mean. There's so many great things that are happening even outside of regulation. A lot of things that are happening within Solana ecosystem. They just made an announcement about partnering with Amazon and you can kind of look at it from two different lenses. Right?
00:20:30.636 - 00:20:33.574, Speaker A: Like the people that are fully all.
00:20:33.612 - 00:20:37.142, Speaker B: About decentralization, they may not necessarily like.
00:20:37.196 - 00:20:40.054, Speaker A: That, but in terms of just increasing.
00:20:40.102 - 00:21:11.540, Speaker B: Adoption, I think we can both agree that from that lens it is a pretty good thing. And then also just like helping more game developers focus on gaming and kind of not have to worry about these nuances of working with a blockchain so they can focus on building just amazing games. Solana is like number two behind Ethereum when it comes to NFTs. And so if they can help and support more builders on the gaming side, I imagine that's going to get even.
00:21:13.910 - 00:21:18.466, Speaker C: I mean, I feel like Solana has done a fantastic job of how they've.
00:21:18.498 - 00:21:22.374, Speaker A: Done their, really business development, because after.
00:21:22.412 - 00:21:24.534, Speaker C: The FTX collapse and everything that happened.
00:21:24.572 - 00:21:27.960, Speaker A: With mean Solana should have been done.
00:21:28.490 - 00:21:31.058, Speaker C: I am shocked that it survived.
00:21:31.154 - 00:21:33.366, Speaker A: But because of that, that's why I'm.
00:21:33.398 - 00:21:36.314, Speaker C: Confident that Solana is going to be a major player in this next bull run.
00:21:36.352 - 00:21:38.266, Speaker A: It's like the amount of conviction they.
00:21:38.288 - 00:21:42.622, Speaker C: Must have to survive that and now to be leading the market pretty much.
00:21:42.676 - 00:21:49.870, Speaker A: In terms of adoption and growth, it's honestly one of the most impressive things I've ever seen.
00:21:50.020 - 00:21:51.566, Speaker C: And then, yeah, to your point, with.
00:21:51.588 - 00:21:55.178, Speaker A: The AWS announcing their Amazon, not everyone's.
00:21:55.194 - 00:22:02.306, Speaker C: Going to love it because they're going to X amount of validators run on here. It's centralized, but ultimately you need to.
00:22:02.328 - 00:22:04.322, Speaker A: Have options for everybody.
00:22:04.456 - 00:22:21.286, Speaker C: Some people want a very reliable, high quality provider that they know has redundancies and they can count on and will be able to refund them money if something goes wrong. We'll always have what they need in stock versus a decentralized company that might be cheaper or something, but has trade offs.
00:22:21.318 - 00:22:25.882, Speaker A: Right. So ultimately, there needs to be options.
00:22:26.016 - 00:22:27.258, Speaker C: As long as they don't go the.
00:22:27.264 - 00:22:32.590, Speaker A: Route of you have to use AWS to build on Solana and require it.
00:22:32.740 - 00:22:36.922, Speaker C: I don't see how this impacts anything other than just providing a great partnership.
00:22:36.986 - 00:22:43.598, Speaker A: And more options to your builders. And that's really ultimately what matters to.
00:22:43.604 - 00:22:47.086, Speaker C: Me, at least, I think, to most builders as well. Yeah.
00:22:47.108 - 00:23:16.346, Speaker B: Solana is interesting because there's not that many chains that have been tested, battle tested before and that have come out on the positive side of it. And I guess it remains to be seen whether or not they can reach that peak that they've experienced last bull run. But do you feel like, because I know you're very much entrenched in the cosmos ecosystem, do you feel cosmos has been tested in that kind of way?
00:23:16.528 - 00:23:17.450, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:23:17.600 - 00:23:22.926, Speaker C: Yes, big time. I mean, Eric, that was huge. I don't know the numbers on it.
00:23:22.948 - 00:23:27.614, Speaker A: But UST was getting paired against all.
00:23:27.652 - 00:23:31.646, Speaker C: Sorts of assets across the cosmos ecosystem. I know osmosis had a ton of.
00:23:31.668 - 00:23:39.060, Speaker A: Ust on there in their LPs and a lot of projects actually raised in.
00:23:40.390 - 00:23:42.580, Speaker C: I mean, I think the cosmos has.
00:23:43.030 - 00:23:49.558, Speaker A: Pretty much faced the same, if not worse, than what FTX did. Because at least with FTX is like.
00:23:49.644 - 00:23:57.046, Speaker C: A lot of the collateral is locked or stuck until they kind of figured out through either liquidations or bankruptcy, where.
00:23:57.068 - 00:24:04.780, Speaker A: It was going with terra Luna, it was just like a straight bank run, like exit liquidity to the bottom.
00:24:05.470 - 00:24:11.834, Speaker C: And so that really tested not only terra, but the entire cosmos ecosystem because it brought the entire ecosystem down with.
00:24:11.872 - 00:24:17.118, Speaker A: It due to how much UsT and Luna exposure all these chains had.
00:24:17.284 - 00:24:27.858, Speaker C: So that, to me, was like the ultimate sign that there's a lot of resiliency in the cosmos ecosystem as well. And also a reason why I think that in general, there's going to be a handful of cosmos chains that are.
00:24:27.864 - 00:24:29.458, Speaker A: Poised for this next bull run.
00:24:29.624 - 00:24:41.430, Speaker C: Strictly because of that. We've seen that it can survive one of the biggest black swan events you can imagine, continue building through a market where there's almost no inflow of money, and come out the other side with some really innovative products.
00:24:41.500 - 00:24:47.160, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think Cosmos has been tested just as much as anybody in this space, to be quite honest.
00:24:48.010 - 00:25:05.102, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. And I'm also excited about some of the innovation that's happening there. I heard about one of the projects, they were trying to come up with a defi solution for you to leverage your bitcoin to utilize that. I've actually posted it in the community.
00:25:05.156 - 00:25:10.030, Speaker A: I don't know if you. Was it that article before? Was it nomic?
00:25:10.690 - 00:25:16.590, Speaker B: That sounds familiar. Yeah, because I want to say onyx, but I know that's the Morgan network.
00:25:16.750 - 00:25:22.194, Speaker A: So there's nomic, which is like nom, and then they have the NBTC, which.
00:25:22.232 - 00:25:37.222, Speaker C: Is like, I think, a representative of your bitcoin on Cosmos. And then there's Babylon, which is doing bitcoin timestamping to add security to the networks, to the cosmos, proof of stake networks. And then I think they're also doing.
00:25:37.276 - 00:25:40.106, Speaker A: Something with staking as well, where I.
00:25:40.128 - 00:25:45.820, Speaker C: Believe you can probably stake your Babylon token, assuming they'll launch one, or they have to, because they're layer one.
00:25:46.270 - 00:25:48.730, Speaker A: And then I think you can earn.
00:25:49.070 - 00:25:51.258, Speaker C: Sats like you would on nomic, which.
00:25:51.264 - 00:25:56.762, Speaker A: Is similar, where I believe you stake your nom and then you earn bitcoin.
00:25:56.826 - 00:26:04.734, Speaker C: From the fees collected as people deposit their bitcoin into the platform. So nomic is actually a really interesting idea I've been following for probably almost.
00:26:04.852 - 00:26:06.500, Speaker A: Year and a half, two years now.
00:26:07.270 - 00:26:27.926, Speaker C: And they've had, I think, two or three airdrops along the way, maybe even a fourth. But yeah, they're just going live within the last week, I think they started to get NVTC listed on Kujira, and I think they just went to mainnet as well, for nomic. So I'm really excited about that platform, see how it works and see if it gets adoption, because if we can.
00:26:27.948 - 00:26:33.370, Speaker A: Bring native bitcoin to Cosmos in a way that's huge.
00:26:33.440 - 00:26:37.370, Speaker C: I mean, that, to me, changes a lot of things, and it creates more yield opportunities.
00:26:38.030 - 00:26:38.442, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:38.496 - 00:26:44.814, Speaker C: In general, I just think what they're doing is very innovative. It's just whether or not it will work and whether or not people will.
00:26:44.852 - 00:26:47.118, Speaker A: Adopt it, because I know currently, I.
00:26:47.124 - 00:26:56.254, Speaker C: Think the fee is like 20% to deposit bitcoin. I don't know many people willing to take a 20% haircut to deposit bitcoin into anything.
00:26:56.372 - 00:26:58.466, Speaker A: So it's going to be difficult for.
00:26:58.488 - 00:27:02.814, Speaker C: Them to get adoption until they can work out a more reasonable fee, in my opinion.
00:27:02.862 - 00:27:09.398, Speaker A: But I think initially, they want it to be really high, to basically just test it out and prevent tons of.
00:27:09.404 - 00:27:12.418, Speaker C: People from utilizing the protocol before it's.
00:27:12.434 - 00:27:14.066, Speaker A: In a point where they feel comfortable.
00:27:14.258 - 00:27:17.350, Speaker C: Hosting millions of dollars of bitcoin.
00:27:18.190 - 00:27:25.210, Speaker B: What do you think will happen to Defi overall once we get an approved spot bitcoin ETF?
00:27:27.310 - 00:27:30.266, Speaker A: I mean, I don't see how it.
00:27:30.288 - 00:27:32.926, Speaker C: Wouldn'T do anything but benefit us in.
00:27:32.948 - 00:27:35.246, Speaker A: General, because what it will do is.
00:27:35.268 - 00:27:37.534, Speaker C: It will now give public companies and.
00:27:37.572 - 00:27:40.638, Speaker A: Large institutions an avenue and a reason.
00:27:40.724 - 00:27:43.326, Speaker C: To get exposure to bitcoin and in.
00:27:43.348 - 00:27:47.426, Speaker A: A way that they can. So I think that right away is.
00:27:47.528 - 00:28:16.554, Speaker C: Going to help a lot with bringing new liquidity into the market is because now they can essentially acquire it in a way that's much safer than kind of what they're trying to do with. What is it called, DCG. I can't think of the grayscale. So basically what they were trying to do, I just think that going with an ETF makes a lot more sense, and then you can actually back it, which is good. It means it has to be acquired so they can back the ETF. Right.
00:28:16.592 - 00:28:53.350, Speaker B: So I think what people get excited about is the fact that these institutions need to actually hold the bitcoin on the balance sheet. Right. So they need to go out and actually buy it. But in terms of some of these DeFi protocols, do you think that these institutions, are they going to be concerned about staking and wanting to do all these things, or do you think they're going to say, you know what, I don't want to deal with the legal stuff. I'm just going to park my money in a bitcoin ETF or potentially even an Ethereum ETF? Right. There's really talks about that.
00:28:53.500 - 00:29:02.486, Speaker A: I imagine we'll get all the major tokens on ETF eventually, but yeah, I.
00:29:02.508 - 00:29:06.186, Speaker C: Feel like they'd probably rather just do the ETF because to your point, they don't want to manage it.
00:29:06.208 - 00:29:11.946, Speaker A: And that's just going to be the fact of the matter across pretty much any company, no one wants to manage.
00:29:12.048 - 00:29:15.614, Speaker C: That type of especially that much money all the time.
00:29:15.732 - 00:29:18.190, Speaker A: So if you can have it basically.
00:29:18.260 - 00:29:22.926, Speaker C: Offloaded to someone else or to a service, that's probably what they're going to do. Or if you can just avoid it.
00:29:22.948 - 00:29:26.640, Speaker A: Altogether and just get the exposure, that's the route they'll go.
00:29:27.670 - 00:29:34.146, Speaker C: I could see a lot of them still just doing what they do now, which is working with teams like Coinbase or fireblocks or some of these other.
00:29:34.168 - 00:29:39.234, Speaker A: Custody providers to basically host all of their assets on their platform and then.
00:29:39.272 - 00:29:40.166, Speaker C: Let them deal with it.
00:29:40.188 - 00:29:42.406, Speaker A: So, like with Coinbase, they'll probably give.
00:29:42.428 - 00:29:48.002, Speaker C: You, let's say you have ethereum, they might give you two or 3% yield, and then they'll actually stake your underlying.
00:29:48.066 - 00:29:52.290, Speaker A: Collateral and earn from the 7% and.
00:29:52.300 - 00:29:56.358, Speaker C: They'Ll just take that kind of delta as their profit. So I would imagine that's how it's.
00:29:56.374 - 00:29:58.378, Speaker A: Going to end up working for the most part.
00:29:58.544 - 00:30:00.398, Speaker C: And then ETFs will be for the.
00:30:00.404 - 00:30:03.086, Speaker A: People who are a little more, I.
00:30:03.108 - 00:30:04.846, Speaker C: Guess, want to be really hands off.
00:30:04.868 - 00:30:07.920, Speaker A: And just custody and own the.
00:30:09.570 - 00:30:26.286, Speaker B: Because you touched on exchanges. Personally, I use Coinbase just because it's the most buttoned up for on and off ramp. Is there? Oh, you use Coinbase as well? Well, I guess there's really not that many choices these days. Right? Like Kucoin?
00:30:26.398 - 00:30:27.720, Speaker A: I don't think you can.
00:30:28.170 - 00:30:30.040, Speaker C: I used to use Kraken, but then.
00:30:31.210 - 00:30:35.206, Speaker B: You can't use Kucoin if you plan on not, I believe.
00:30:35.388 - 00:30:45.478, Speaker C: Right. And that's pretty much all of them now is like, you pretty much have to KYC for almost any platform, and if you're United States resident, you're going to be excluded from using it, except.
00:30:45.494 - 00:30:49.014, Speaker A: For the few that are us, I guess, regulated.
00:30:49.062 - 00:30:57.166, Speaker C: So like, I think binance us was, but that's no longer, as far as I know. And then kraken again, I'm pretty sure.
00:30:57.188 - 00:31:01.246, Speaker A: They shut down us users as well.
00:31:01.348 - 00:31:02.494, Speaker C: So I think it really is just.
00:31:02.532 - 00:31:06.126, Speaker A: Coinbase, like the only real exchange you.
00:31:06.148 - 00:31:08.320, Speaker C: Can buy from that I would consider.
00:31:09.250 - 00:31:11.618, Speaker A: Know trustworthy enough to recommend to a friend.
00:31:11.784 - 00:31:13.554, Speaker C: And so that's pretty much where I.
00:31:13.672 - 00:31:15.858, Speaker A: On ramp all my fiat at this point.
00:31:16.024 - 00:31:20.866, Speaker C: I would love to move to things like Kado or some of these other direct fiat on ramps.
00:31:20.898 - 00:31:24.066, Speaker A: But unfortunately, it's just like the costs.
00:31:24.178 - 00:31:25.814, Speaker C: Don'T make a lot of sense because.
00:31:25.852 - 00:31:28.854, Speaker A: You'Re paying anywhere from ten dollars to fifteen dollars, right?
00:31:28.892 - 00:31:40.814, Speaker C: Where I can pay 299 on Coinbase, buy as much as I need, and then they'll give me a free transfer off. Especially if you're using like atom as your asset. It's going to cost you a couple of cents to send it and you pay 290 had to acquire it.
00:31:40.852 - 00:31:45.550, Speaker A: That's much cheaper than going through an onboarding service where you're not only taking.
00:31:45.620 - 00:31:50.206, Speaker C: Slippage on your actual onboard, if you're doing it through osmosis, but then you're paying a fee on top of that.
00:31:50.228 - 00:31:55.746, Speaker A: And it's like, again, I'm not trying to give up 1015 percent just to.
00:31:55.768 - 00:31:57.106, Speaker C: Get my money on the platform.
00:31:57.208 - 00:31:59.710, Speaker A: That's not ideal.
00:31:59.870 - 00:32:04.354, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, to say that Coinbase is a cheaper option, that says a lot, right?
00:32:04.472 - 00:32:49.380, Speaker C: Because it's not like cheap, it's just cheaper. And I think noble can really help with that. And I was actually on a space with the noble team yesterday. They're talking about this is getting access to retail and users to be able to mint USDC so that it's not just like institutions and large buyers. You could actually mint it natively on whatever, like from archway. I could natively mint USDC and I wouldn't have to pay any fees other than I'm sure there's a transaction fee, but that could be similar to Coinbase and then there wouldn't be additional fees on top of that because they can just do the native minting. So there is no bridging, there's no real cost outside of whatever fee they want to charge for you to utilize it.
00:32:49.380 - 00:33:17.740, Speaker C: So that, I think will be huge for the cosmos in general, just to get more ways to onboard and offboard your fiat that don't require centralized exchange, although you're essentially using a centralized entity in circle, but it's being distributed through noble. So I don't know what that really does for decentralization, but it does create a cheaper way to onboard, which is ultimately what we're kind of talking about.
00:33:18.190 - 00:33:34.400, Speaker B: Why do you think know, we've had this little mini bull run and all the major coins have been going up for the most part. Obviously, Salana has been going up by far, but Cosmos hasn't really been moving much.
00:33:35.190 - 00:34:00.234, Speaker C: I mean, Adam has not moved much, but the cosmos kind of has. Honestly, a lot of the smaller caps in the cosmos are probably up 20% to 30% over the past couple of weeks, maybe the past month. So the cosmos actually has been slowly moving quite a bit, although Adam has not. And I think that's a lot of things. I think it's the turmoil happening within.
00:34:00.352 - 00:34:03.706, Speaker A: Just the hub with the different kind.
00:34:03.728 - 00:34:30.306, Speaker C: Of core contributing groups having different opinions. I think a lot of it has to do with high inflation and people realizing that high inflation isn't necessarily a benefit to your asset. And then also the amount of funding that they've provided to teams in Adam that I imagine they have to offload in some way to fund their operations. So you kind of take all that together, and I think that's why Adam has kind of struggled to keep up.
00:34:30.328 - 00:34:31.460, Speaker A: With the rest of the.
00:34:32.070 - 00:34:41.638, Speaker C: But, like, the actual ecosystem of Cosmos SDK chains is actually doing really well. I mean, I think I've seen a.
00:34:41.644 - 00:34:46.022, Speaker A: Lot of the smaller kind of real.
00:34:46.076 - 00:35:18.866, Speaker C: World use case type applications have really taken off, like Jackal with private storage, like private cloud storage. Akash has taken off a bit. We've seen decenter, a decentralized browser that has taken off. So we've seen a lot of these smaller caps kind of make their run. But, yeah, I'd say Adam was just kind of its own beast. And I think that's also what's impacting it, is osmosis. So osmosis actually recently just had a pump, I think within last day.
00:35:18.866 - 00:36:29.800, Speaker C: But prior to that, they were also slowly kind of grinding down. And that pulls down a lot of the cosmos assets as well, because they're all paired against osmosis. Osmosis is the largest liquidity provider or paired largest liquidity provider for almost every pair in the cosmos, and most of them are paired against osmosis. So an osmosis goes down, it kind of drags everything with it. So that would be my assumption as to why they haven't outperformed or performed up to the rest of, I guess, the space. But I guess that's just kind of, they're going through some unique situations right now, whereas the broader market, I think, is kind of all in the same page of, hey, we've been in this bear market for almost two and a half years. It's starting to seem like the economy is in a spot where it could tank or that we could even go to war, which then people start to flee to safer classes of assets, which bitcoin, I guess, to some people, would be considered safer than holding it in their bank, or if they think inflation is going to outpace what they could do just by holding bitcoin so I think there's a lot of macro things that have led people to start to put more money into the market.
00:36:29.800 - 00:36:50.074, Speaker C: And, yeah, I just don't know if that's going to be a constant for the next six months to really have a true bull run take off or if this is just more or less people reacting to all this major news coming through and then ultimately two, three weeks from now, we kind of settle back down to where we were. It may be even more downside.
00:36:50.122 - 00:36:50.750, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:36:50.820 - 00:36:56.066, Speaker C: It's totally plausible. It does seem very euphoric across the board right now.
00:36:56.248 - 00:37:05.378, Speaker B: You even look at the fear and greed index, I want to say it's like three, four of the way. Like, full on greed. I'm like, really?
00:37:05.544 - 00:37:29.914, Speaker C: At 34, right. But it feels that way to me. I can tell you from my personal sense, I have felt the need to really want to put more capital in, but I'm trying to be disciplined, knowing, hey, I've been doing this for the past 612 months, preparing for this. Now is not the time to double down. Right. I'm also not really selling much because.
00:37:29.952 - 00:37:32.730, Speaker A: I don't think this is the peak.
00:37:33.310 - 00:37:52.850, Speaker C: But I do think we could have some retracement. So it's like I'm just kind of being patient, but I'm not actually putting more in at this point. Kind of let it run its course for a little bit and, yeah, just kind of see where it goes. Because I hear you on the fear and greed side of things. I feel very greedy right now, which is typically when they say you should be fearful.
00:37:53.510 - 00:38:54.550, Speaker B: The other night, I was kind of, like going through my telegram, and all of a sudden I felt overwhelmed with so many things going on in the news about these conferences and all these amazing things that are happening which I'm not attending or prices going up to your point, I'm just kind of, like sitting on my hands right now, and I felt like this anxiety or just this fear of I'm missing out. The world is just like moving on without me and I'm just going to get left behind. How do I check myself? Why am I feeling that way? And I think a lot of times we don't really focus so much about the mental state of people that work in crypto or investors. It's like a whole other topic that we could probably have. But there's just so much that goes on in our heads right from day to day just working with crypto.
00:38:55.770 - 00:39:45.990, Speaker C: No, I definitely feel that because, yeah, there's times where when a lot of news is coming out or big events. It's like a whirlwind. You're trying to keep up with everything that's going on. It's like changing your view for the future of like, oh, is this a really bullish sign? Should I be reconsidering if I should be deploying right now? Or, hey, is this going to change my thesis? Does this actually make me think maybe this is more of a temporary rally and not really the start of the next bull run? So every day I feel like my mind's kind of swaying between the two based on all this different news and this whirlwind of things coming out to the point where, yeah, it's hard for you to put your finger on. It's like, hey, are we in the bull run? Are we not? Should I be deploying? Should I be selling? And then you just kind of feel stuck. And whatever way it goes, you're going to feel FOMO. It's like, I should have sold, I should have bought.
00:39:45.990 - 00:40:11.950, Speaker C: So, yeah, I guess maybe not unique to people in the space, but it's unique to me in the sense that I've never had a role where I've been so directly tied to a volatile market like this. So it's quite interesting, the emotions that come with it and the highs and lows of even a day going up versus going down, or significant good news coming across the wire versus bad news. It's pretty wild.
00:40:12.370 - 00:40:23.890, Speaker B: So, specifically to Archway, how has it been since you guys launched and how has this uptick in the market? How has that impacted your day to day? Specifically in regards to Archway?
00:40:24.790 - 00:40:43.546, Speaker C: I mean, the only real noticeable effect is there's more people participating in chats and tweeting about the protocol, asking me questions about the protocol, or trying to figure out how they can get more involved. So it's notable in that sense. But what I also noticed is just that there's a lot of issues that.
00:40:43.568 - 00:40:46.986, Speaker A: We need to kind of solve now.
00:40:47.088 - 00:40:50.686, Speaker C: So that when we truly get into the bull run that we're prepared for.
00:40:50.708 - 00:40:52.110, Speaker A: That type of activity.
00:40:52.610 - 00:41:05.262, Speaker C: Things like just having more liquidity across the ecosystem for people to buy arch, getting more access to it, I think is huge. And then also just providing yield opportunities.
00:41:05.326 - 00:41:07.842, Speaker A: On chain, on archway to give people.
00:41:07.896 - 00:41:39.674, Speaker C: A reason to come and not only acquire arch, but then utilize it and participate in our ecosystem of apps. So there's some things that I know the protocol has to improve in order to truly be ready for an influx of new users and capital. And this kind of run we're on right now has kind of opened my eyes to some of the things we can do to assist on that. And I think things like the liquidity council that we established will start to alleviate a lot of those issues on the liquidity side. And then we're also talking to quite.
00:41:39.712 - 00:41:43.406, Speaker A: A few different layer ones to provide.
00:41:43.588 - 00:41:54.946, Speaker C: Token swaps on each other's dexes or what have you, so that there is more liquidity for each token and they're across different chains and dexes. So you have arbitrage opportunities, exposure to.
00:41:54.968 - 00:41:56.946, Speaker A: New users, and just.
00:41:56.968 - 00:42:13.618, Speaker C: Yeah, generally more people aware of what we're doing. Even if they're on osmosis or if they're on injective or kujira, they can still get exposure to arch or even earn yield from arch on a kujira through a bo liquidity pool.
00:42:13.714 - 00:42:17.678, Speaker A: So I think just getting more distribution.
00:42:17.794 - 00:42:20.234, Speaker C: Of arch and then really just getting.
00:42:20.272 - 00:42:24.714, Speaker A: Our own ecosystem properly, the proper amount.
00:42:24.752 - 00:42:34.078, Speaker C: Of depth and liquidity would really kind of unleash the ability for people to really come participate from the retail side, either as a speculator or as a.
00:42:34.084 - 00:42:36.414, Speaker A: User of the mean.
00:42:36.452 - 00:43:05.078, Speaker B: Definitely better to learn these lessons now, right? Versus once we get back on the high horse here, it'll be a little bit tougher. Max, always appreciate you coming on, man. Always enjoy our conversations, whether it be about touching on archway or cosmos, or just the market as a whole. Always appreciate you and any parting thoughts for the listeners. And where can people connect with you, by the way?
00:43:05.244 - 00:43:11.394, Speaker C: Yeah, well, first off, appreciate you having me on and the feeling is mutual. I love these discussions. I like being able to just casually.
00:43:11.442 - 00:43:13.082, Speaker A: Kind of talk about all the things.
00:43:13.136 - 00:43:14.538, Speaker C: Happening because there is a lot of.
00:43:14.544 - 00:43:19.370, Speaker A: Them and there's not many people who are as ingrained into it or interested.
00:43:19.440 - 00:43:27.546, Speaker C: In it as the people in this space. So appreciate you hearing me out and listening. And as for your question parting thoughts.
00:43:27.578 - 00:43:30.186, Speaker A: I would just say check out what's.
00:43:30.218 - 00:43:52.518, Speaker C: Going on in arche. We have a lot of things going on. We are hosting a quadratic funding round for some of our applications with Dorahacks, and we're also working with a few other teams to try to incentivize just new users to come in, utilize the protocol, utilize the applications, and they can earn arch from it. So check out the archway, Twitter or the discord if you want to get.
00:43:52.524 - 00:43:53.926, Speaker A: More information on some of that.
00:43:54.028 - 00:43:55.094, Speaker C: And if you want to find me.
00:43:55.132 - 00:43:58.150, Speaker A: You can go find me on Telegram at cryptocem.
00:44:01.470 - 00:44:07.930, Speaker C: And that's the same handle on all social media. So whether it's Twitter, telegram, discord, it's always at cryptocem.
00:44:09.390 - 00:44:12.950, Speaker A: And yeah, always willing to answer questions.
00:44:13.040 - 00:44:18.880, Speaker C: Or set some time to talk with anyone who's interested in either. Building on archware. Just wants to connect.
00:44:19.250 - 00:44:21.838, Speaker A: For whatever reason, I'm always trying to.
00:44:21.844 - 00:44:24.526, Speaker C: Expand my network and meet new people, so. Pretty open.
00:44:24.708 - 00:44:27.946, Speaker A: Just shoot me a DM. Pretty much always respond.
00:44:28.138 - 00:44:34.510, Speaker B: I got you. Yeah, I'll make sure to include the links in the description. Thanks so much for your time, Max.
00:44:35.050 - 00:44:51.780, Speaker A: I appreciate you, man. Take it easy. You have.
