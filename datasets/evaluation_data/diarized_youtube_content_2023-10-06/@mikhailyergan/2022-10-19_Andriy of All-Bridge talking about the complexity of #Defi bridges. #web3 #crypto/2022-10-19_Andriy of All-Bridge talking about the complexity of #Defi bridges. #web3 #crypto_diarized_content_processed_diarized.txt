00:00:00.170 - 00:00:32.402, Speaker A: Now, let's say you want to connect Binance to near protocol. What do you do? In this case, there is no simple answer because near protocol has rainbow breach of its own, which connects Ethereum to near, but it's not connecting binance chain to near. And it gets even more complicated when you try to think about all of those non EVM chains that are out there, because finding the breach from one Vem chain to the other one, it is relatively easy for the reason that it is pretty much the same solidity contract that you redeploy.
