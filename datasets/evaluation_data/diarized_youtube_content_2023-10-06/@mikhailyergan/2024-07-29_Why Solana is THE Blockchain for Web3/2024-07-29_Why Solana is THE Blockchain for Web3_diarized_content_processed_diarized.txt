00:00:00.400 - 00:00:14.770, Speaker A: I honestly think based on what I've seen with, like, eth in the past where, like, we have that awareness phase and then, like, defi Summer or, like, you know, like a 2017 ICO season, that's kind of what it feels like we're in right now with Solana.
00:00:17.390 - 00:00:40.256, Speaker B: So we discussed where we are in the market. We discussed what we should be doing right now, which is accumulating. Let's go through your list now and dissect some of these chains and some of the numbers that you have, because you not only talk about what altcoins you like, but you also talk about what point you would want to buy them. And so I want to go through that list and try to get an understanding of how you came to those numbers.
00:00:40.408 - 00:01:09.910, Speaker A: Okay. Sure. All right, so this is the post. So, yeah, basically it goes through a bunch of assets. The assets chosen here are mostly BTceth and all l one s. There's a bunch of other assets, like some defi assets that I like at the bottom. But the majority of the things you want to focus on right now, I would say, are, like, BTC ETH and L1 S, because those are shoo in guarantees to be around.
00:01:09.910 - 00:01:44.962, Speaker A: That's what you want to look at first and foremost with, like, choosing something you need to. When you choose an asset, you need to make sure it's going to be in the next bull run. As long as it's in the next run, you're going to be up money, like almost like 90 something percent. You're going to be up some amount of money. If you just choose any of these major assets, the smaller assets, there's just a million things that can go wrong with them. The teams could decide to stop, let's say the bull run, contrary to popular belief, we don't have to have a three year cycle. Exactly.
00:01:44.962 - 00:02:08.106, Speaker A: Let's say we don't have a real bull run, like a crazy ten x plus in market cap bull run for five to ten years. But we do have it, say, like six or seven years. Six years post, like 2021. So say 2027. That's when it happens. There could be some project that you like that they just stopped working on it because they get bored or they run out of money. Right.
00:02:08.106 - 00:02:54.228, Speaker A: So I'm choosing things where I know they have, like, the money, the community, they have everything in place, and they'll almost definitely be around as long as there's no major terra Luna like, events that happen here. Yeah. So the. The way that I'm coming to, like, I have, like, the bottom, like, what the actual bottom is. And then where, like, a good buy would be. The first thing to, like, note about the prices is that, like, we have never gone below, like, when we have a bull bear, like, 2021, 2022, when we have, like, a bear market in the following neutral period or pre bull period, we never go below, like, how bad it got in the bear. Like, the actual bear market is as bad as it gets.
00:02:54.228 - 00:03:26.692, Speaker A: Like, the bear market. That's the. In the following year, after a bull run, you hit, like, the bottom of the bottom in terms of prices. So that kind of gives you an idea of, like, where is the bottom here? Like, let's just use Avax because it's the first l one I have on the list. You can see like that after this big boom here, it drops down, right. Things got the most bearish in this period, say, December 2022. And I think we hit about ten dollars, eight to ten dollars in here.
00:03:26.692 - 00:04:09.558, Speaker A: That turned out to be the overall. Sometimes we went a little higher to $20. But then when we go back down and we have a little bearish period, 2023, which I would consider a neutral period, we hit this bottom again of dollar eight to dollar ten that we hit in the bear market. Arguably we could have went a little lower because there's a bit of inflation in terms of market cap. We did go lower, a tiny bit lower. You can get an idea of the bottom by looking at that. Then as far as an actual good price to buy, you just look at the bottom, say the bottom is dollar eight.
00:04:09.558 - 00:04:32.720, Speaker A: The top here is dollar 54. Now we're sitting at like 30. It's very unlikely that you're actually going to snipe it at like eight or $10. So I wouldn't really try. But in that ten to $20 range is where you're eyeing, and we can go back there. We almost just did. If we make the chart a little bit smaller here, we went to, like 20.
00:04:32.720 - 00:05:01.920, Speaker A: We almost dropped in the $20 range, which I would consider like sub 22 or so. I think I put 22, 23. Yeah. So this good buy range, I would buy at anything in this good buy range. I actually did buy in this buy range when, after I did this post, we did drop into this good buy range for almost all these assets on the list. And I actually did buy a bit, which was hopefully pretty decent as far as, like, long term buys, but. Yeah.
00:05:02.300 - 00:05:13.610, Speaker B: How many of these good buy zones are still active? Because we obviously had a. Had a little run the last week or so. How many of these are still in play.
00:05:14.990 - 00:05:47.608, Speaker A: We're slightly above, like the good buy range, I think, for almost everything. Like, say, I put like under thirty five cents and we're at like $0.37. So, like, the thing I would keep in mind is, like, if you buy now, you're just not, you're not going to be buying, like, if you buy at $30 Avax, right. You'll probably be up in the, like, you'll be up in the next, even the next bull period. We should go into like the thirties. And especially in the next bull run, we will break out of, you know, the thirties into like the forties and beyond. But you're not going to be buying the bottom if you're buying $30 Avex.
00:05:47.608 - 00:06:14.496, Speaker A: Like, you're just not. We naturally do these, like, fluctuations, like sine wave fluctuations every few months in crypto, and we will drop, say, like to 2020, $2 or like $15. We will go into that range and then we will come back up and maybe push up to like 35, 37. That's just natural crypto fluctuations. So, yeah, like, but you don't always need to buy the bottom. Sometimes just accumulating, like maybe dcaing. Right.
00:06:14.496 - 00:06:44.750, Speaker A: Is what I recommend. Sometimes just putting a little in just to get your foot in the door and some of these assets. So, yeah, I wouldn't rule out like something like, say at like $0.37 because it's new or like, let me see what sui is at. Yeah, $0.81. Yeah, it's like, just everything is just outside the range. Like, me personally, I would take the majority of my money and have it in USDC and be trying to wait a little bit to enter, but just a little bit.
00:06:45.370 - 00:07:14.370, Speaker B: How do you view some of these earlier altcoins, like Aptos, Sui, and the amount of tokens that are actually circulating right now versus how much are not unlocked just yet? Does any of that scare you? I know that Solana was in that stage last cycle, but now it's a lot safer. So you almost have to bet that these altcoins are going to be around the next few bull cycles, right?
00:07:16.350 - 00:07:51.670, Speaker A: Yeah. Actually, coinmarketcap just did something really useful. They just implemented a feature that has, where you can see the token unlocks. And I thought this was incredibly useful for users because you can kind of click this and you can see how much is locked, how much is unlocked. You can basically see everything on here and you can see when the unlock events are coming. You can see exactly how much is being unlocked on what date, and actually it does scare me. And the way some of them do unlocks, like, for instance, arbitrum.
00:07:51.670 - 00:08:07.890, Speaker A: I like arbitrum, and I think it's great and really fast, and it's just useful and all that. Right. But in terms of. So tech wise, it's fine. In terms of tokenomics, though. Oh, they just had the largest unlock. Look at this.
00:08:07.890 - 00:08:25.320, Speaker A: Look at the size. So you can see what happens when there's an unlock. Arbitrum is probably the best example. They had, like, almost a $2 billion unlock, and they're. Or no, it was a $1 billion unlock, and their market cap was already 1 billion. So they doubled their market cap with the unlock temporarily. And look what happens in this case.
00:08:25.320 - 00:08:41.394, Speaker A: Let's go to the all time graph. Okay, so what happens is, like, the price can be kind of trending up. Trending up. And then here's where the unlock happens. Now, this is not a price graph. This is a market cap. Graphite.
00:08:41.394 - 00:09:00.270, Speaker A: So, when an unlock happens. So, yeah, it was, okay, $2 billion. Right? And then suddenly, it instantly goes to, oh, so it was a $2 billion market cap, $2 billion unlock. Suddenly the market cap doubles. Right. But the price at this exact date, it does not double. The price actually doesn't move at all when there's an unlock.
00:09:00.270 - 00:09:39.304, Speaker A: And to kind of compensate for all those new tokens that are added into circulation, what ends up happening to the price, which was, like, sitting at $2, is a ton of people, because you can't just increase a coin's market cap by just, like, putting a bunch of new coins into circulation. What ends up happening is some percentage of those users is going to sell, of course, and that destroys your price, but it actually keeps market cap the same when all that selling occurs. I know it sounds weird. So, like, what ends up happening is, look at this. Like, Arbitrum's market cap before and after the unlock is exactly the same. But if you had arbitrum. Right, so at 2 billion, and it's about 2 billion still.
00:09:39.304 - 00:10:01.340, Speaker A: But how the holders get screwed over here is it was $1.60 or, you know, $2, and then now it's at $0.78. So, like, by doubling the market cap, you have the price. That's really scary for holders, and it's totally avoidable. And you could be looking. So you need to be looking at these token unlocks. Like, it's.
00:10:01.340 - 00:10:18.140, Speaker A: I wouldn't even hold arbitrum because of the way they structured their unlock events like that or the way they did that one in particular that was just too much. Maybe they didn't predict that the coin would be worth such a high market cap. I don't know, but, yeah. So definitely something to look out for.
00:10:18.720 - 00:10:30.978, Speaker B: So if you're looking at arbitram or you like the tech, you like the partnerships that they're forming, I mean, are you at this point just waiting for more of the unlocks and waiting for that digital asset to mature before jumping in to.
00:10:31.104 - 00:10:40.694, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. You can just wait until all the unlocks are done, and then once that happens, you're pretty much safe to enter if you like the tech. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing with arbitrum.
00:10:40.862 - 00:11:06.806, Speaker B: So in this also, a good question here, then, is, since you're a founder, how do you navigate this? Right. Because on one hand, you need money in order to develop the smart contracts. You're a developer yourself. You're a founder. So how do you view all of this? Like, you don't want to screw over the people that are investing in your token. So how are you viewing this? Like, how do you structure your unlocks?
00:11:06.998 - 00:11:34.784, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I'm actually doing this exact thing right now. That's a good question. And it's complicated. What you're weighing in your head is, how fast can I grow my coins? Market cap. So the market cap is the overall growth of the project. Right. How fast can I grow it? And then you want to kind of put the unlocks, like, let's say you think you can, like, get your coin.
00:11:34.784 - 00:12:02.832, Speaker A: Like, basically you want. You want the growth of the coin to outpace the speed of unlocks. And if you can do that, then you'll have overall growth. If you're unable to. If you put your unlocks, like, all in a really short area, like, you're like, oh, I want everyone to have their tokens, like, within a year, and you unlock all of those tokens in the first year, there's no way you're going to outpace that. You're just not going to. Almost definitely, unless you really hit it big.
00:12:02.832 - 00:12:39.890, Speaker A: But you can't bank on that. As a founder, what I'm doing is I'm structuring it so that the unlocks are monthly. There's not any one gigantic unlock that could screw people over, potentially. So monthly unlocks. So it's kind of balanced and over, like, either two year or three year period. Yeah. So as long as you're willing to commit to working on a project long term, I think, like, two years or three years is a reasonable timeframe for unlocks, and it's possible, assuming you raise money and investors have tokens and such.
00:12:39.890 - 00:13:09.642, Speaker A: And if you're the team, as long as you're not doing a huge amount of selling, arguably you don't want to do any selling. If your price is having some issue, if your price is having some issues with the investor unlocks, you don't want to sell it all because then you're going to just add fuel to the decreasing fire. You have to be very careful with how you structure this over a long period of time is the way to do it.
00:13:09.826 - 00:13:32.660, Speaker B: Let's go back to that list. So you have, like, avalanche. You have say on there, aptos. Let's see. Sui. So you like the move language. What is it about this new technology that you really like? Because there's really not a lot of development happening just yet.
00:13:32.660 - 00:13:57.750, Speaker B: We just got done talking about where are the users, and they're mostly on Ethereum. Solana maybe avalanche a little bit. But those altcoins, like, those networks, like Aptos, Sui, while they seems to be very promising from a tech perspective, I hear great things about Sui and how their UX experience is, like, amazing. But how are you viewing these from, like, a development perspective?
00:14:00.290 - 00:14:57.514, Speaker A: So with these ones, these are kind of all in the same phase of, like, they haven't even gotten their, like, awareness. Like, oh, wow, there's a million users downloading wallets type thing. They haven't had that yet. They're just in their, like, small, tight knit, niche community phase of, like. And they have a small group of niche builders I kind of have seen, say, and Sui as kind of the main ones, the main new, like, 2024, like, golden boys of, like, a building right now. And I wouldn't be, like, the reason I put all these on here is sometimes it's tough to tell exactly which one will win, like, right now, when there's really only a bull run happening on what I would call Solana's sole bull run. So I think establishing a portfolio with a little of all these l ones is just a good idea.
00:14:57.514 - 00:15:17.180, Speaker A: That's it. If you gamble on a single l one, like you say, I love Aptos or Sui, and you just kind of go all in on it, you may be missing out on, you may be missing something that may end up erupting in the future. I think spreading out amongst the l one s is definitely the way to go here.
00:15:17.720 - 00:15:39.360, Speaker B: Yeah, got it. Your list is pretty thorough and long, and we haven't even touched on Defi, which I want to get to in a future episode. Yeah, but last question. For you, Tyler, based on what we discussed, the networks that we touched on, the altcoins that we discussed, what is your bold prediction for the rest of 2024?
00:15:40.940 - 00:16:23.312, Speaker A: Bold prediction. All right, so I think that we could very well see a real boom on Solana. I guess it's good. I pulled the graph up. A real boom, like, where you see how we, like you initially boom up here, and then you kind of go sideways a little bit, and then you have this huge push up. I honestly think, based on what I've seen with, like, eth in the past, where, like, we have that awareness phase, and then, like, defi summer or, like, you know, like, the 2017 IcO season, that's kind of what it feels like we're in right now with Solana. There's, like, this, like, celebrity attention that's kind of coming in.
00:16:23.312 - 00:16:49.440, Speaker A: There's, like, meme coins. It feels very much like we are in a, like, bull summer almost. And I would not be surprised if we see, like, solely on Solana. Like, the other l ones will benefit from it, and they will rise as well, of course. But Solana, I think, really will be, like, the leader here in potentially pushing to, like, 300, 400, maybe 500. I wouldn't. 500 is really bold.
00:16:49.440 - 00:17:11.882, Speaker A: I would just say, like, 300, maybe 350. I think we could see that. And a really hard push up and a really big explosion of, like, maybe more celebrities getting involved or more attention or more dapps or more infrastructure. All of that kind of just culminating into a huge push. That's what I'm feeling right now. And I'm not some Solana. I like Solana.
00:17:11.882 - 00:17:16.550, Speaker A: I'm not, like, this huge Solana fanboy or anything. I'm just going based on what I've seen in the past.
00:17:17.180 - 00:17:42.920, Speaker B: So Solana right now is pretty much like a retail chain, right? You got a lot of meme coins on there. You've got some deep end plays as well, like, some infrastructure plays. But if you're trying to front run the Solana narrative, you're looking at the Solana ETF potentially getting approved. Who knows? But if you're sold on Solana and you want to front run that narrative, what applications? Like, what kind of projects are you looking at on Solana?
00:17:44.840 - 00:18:32.394, Speaker A: Yeah, so Solana's situation is a little bit interesting. It's mostly like, if you want to make money short term, it's meme coins, believe it or not. And even if you're not into them, it's kind of like you need to know someone or have connections, and you need to get in early, you kind of want to look at, like, meme coins that have big communities because they are going to, like, there are meme coins that are going to like a billion dollar market cap. But in terms of actual building the stuff that, like, that I actually really like and look for. You have things like Jupiter. Like, think about, like, who is building the infrastructure for all of this? Like, what do meme coins need? Well, they need liquidity, so maybe there will be some defi farming apps that kind of spawn up. We've seen this in the past on Ethereum.
00:18:32.394 - 00:19:07.080, Speaker A: Like, they, they may need lending or just coins that, like, anything on Solana in general, there could be lending platforms where people lend out their soul, and then you can kind of, like, you can gamble essentially on Sol by shorting or longing it and doing that with some of the larger sole assets as well. So these things are being built on sol, like, this infrastructure. So looking for these dapps and things, it would be a good idea if you're trying to take advantage of what potentially could be coming.
00:19:08.780 - 00:19:17.920, Speaker B: So are there any specific applications that are appealing to you right now? You mentioned Jupyter. You like Jupiter over radium.
00:19:18.900 - 00:19:43.122, Speaker A: Yeah. Radium is kind of unusable, and I've had such laggy, like, it's. Yeah, I can't even go into, like, serious detail about it, but, like, I. I've tried launching, like, coins on radium, like, for fun and such, and, like, things like, you can't even, like, add or remove, like, your liquidity if you wanted to. Like, uh, like, it just won't even appear there for some reason. Uh, you'll. You'll go to make a buy in.
00:19:43.122 - 00:19:56.866, Speaker A: Like, just things won't work even though you set all the settings right. It's. Yeah, radium is just. It's not the way to go. I don't know why it has such issues, but it does. Uh, so a lot of people are coming up with, like, other solutions. I forget there's, like, another name that people use for.
00:19:56.866 - 00:20:39.074, Speaker A: It's like this strange website. Anyone who's active on Solana will know exactly what I'm talking about, but they use it for trading really fast, and it's really a much better trading platform than either radium or Jupiter. But I use Jupyter. Personally, I think it's good. I don't even have any specific applications in mind, like, on Solana to look at. Like, I'm not a Solana ecosystem expert. I do have, like, a list of, like, a list of them somewhere in my notepad of like Solana Defi apps that I like and that I, like, look at, but I wouldn't say, like any are specifically standing out to me.
00:20:39.074 - 00:20:51.994, Speaker A: Someone who's, like, really active on Solana or building on Solana would have a much better, like, I would. I would seek to ask someone, like, someone that I know that is really active on Solana about this, rather than, like, advising on it myself, you know?
00:20:52.162 - 00:21:22.854, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe that's one of the reasons why Ansem is gaining so much popularity, because he kind of rose up with Solana. But, Tyler, this was very interesting because you were kind of, like both sides of the coin, so to speak, no pun intended. You're an investor, and also you are a builder. So you look at it from both angles, which is very unique as a guest on the show. So this was very worth the time. And like I said, I want to have you back on to talk about Defi. Maybe we can dive deeper into those applications that you really like on Solana.
00:21:22.854 - 00:21:37.730, Speaker B: And then also, we haven't even scratched the surface about wano finance and sapient growth. So I would certainly love to dive deeper into that. But where can people, if they want to follow along on your journey as a builder, as an investor, where can they find you?
00:21:40.070 - 00:22:02.378, Speaker A: So, yeah, the two things that I'm kind of working on are lotto finance is a. It's a, like, unique. We built this, like, lottery token where I. A entire lottery is built into this token. It's the first ever lottery token. And the way it works is Tuesdays and Fridays at 08:00 p.m. ten tokens are pulled from.
00:22:02.378 - 00:22:26.260, Speaker A: If you hold lotto, ten tokens are pulled from every lotto holders account automatically pulled together. And then all of it is just given to one random user. So it's the only token in the whole space that you can hold, and the price doesn't even need to change. And you can make a huge amount of lotto but money, because you can just sell it right if you win. So that's kind of how it works. And you can go to Lotto finance to take a look at that. We're building, like, lotto V two.
00:22:26.260 - 00:22:53.136, Speaker A: It's still on testnet right now, but will be coming out in the coming months. And then kind of the other thing that I work on is sapient Pro. It's a crypto development company. We do all sorts of dev. We do, like, e commerce as well. But if you're building crypto apps, I like to apply my expertise to helping people build. And, yeah, we do everything from NFTs, Defi, all of that.
00:22:53.136 - 00:23:09.908, Speaker A: We build from scratch. We can help you. We have everything. We have all resources to make it happen. We have designers. We can help take your project from idea to implement it and launched. I have a bunch of connections as well to help with that and all that.
00:23:09.908 - 00:23:10.720, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:11.380 - 00:23:14.188, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah. I'll be sure to include the links in the description.
00:23:14.324 - 00:23:14.900, Speaker A: Yes.
00:23:15.020 - 00:23:16.692, Speaker B: There's something else you wanted to add.
00:23:16.836 - 00:23:19.972, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And the website for that is sapientpro.com. that's it.
00:23:20.036 - 00:23:25.520, Speaker B: Sapientpro.com. yeah. I'll be sure to include that as well. Thanks again, Tyler. So this was a lot of fun.
00:23:25.940 - 00:23:27.220, Speaker A: Yeah. Thanks for having me on. Mikael.
