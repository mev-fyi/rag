00:00:00.170 - 00:00:29.158, Speaker A: This is from multichain. We don't know if it's all true, but Multichain said their CEO was arrested or taken into custody by the chinese government. And even though they use multi Sig protection on the chain, he had control to all of the signatures of the multi Sig. I'm kind of simplifying, okay. It really was something like he had control of all the nodes through a personal cloud account or whatever. But, like, essentially, even though it was supposed Multisig, he could just do whatever he wanted. He had that much power.
00:00:29.158 - 00:00:43.140, Speaker A: The funny thing is, because he controlled it through this personal cloud account, the engineers didn't know how to get in. So once he was arrested and couldn't go log in and do stuff, the engineers couldn't make a lot of mods, they couldn't do much.
