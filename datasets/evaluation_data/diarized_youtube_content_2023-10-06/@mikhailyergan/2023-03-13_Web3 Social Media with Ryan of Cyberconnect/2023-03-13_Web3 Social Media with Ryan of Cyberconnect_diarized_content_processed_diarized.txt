00:00:00.490 - 00:00:48.502, Speaker A: Welcome back to Network Spotlight. I am your host, Mikhail. For those that don't know me, I am the founder of network Spotlight Elites, which is a community of VCs and founders in Web Three. I also have this YouTube channel where I provide a platform for entrepreneurs to be able to educate their community about what it is that they are building. On today's show, I will be talking to Ryan of Cyber Connect, which is a social graph protocol that aims to give users ownership and utility of their social graph data. It offers a web3 social graph module for developers. Cyber Connect is also powering link three, which is a web3 native social platform built on top of cyber connect protocol.
00:00:48.502 - 00:01:25.270, Speaker A: Lots to go over. I think you'll enjoy the show. Please subscribe to the channel like the video show support for our founders and let's begin. Welcome to the show, Ryan. It's nice to finally connect. I know we've worked before in the past together, but it's nice to actually put a face on a name and have an opportunity to sit down and have a conversation with you. I know you've been busy with cyber Connect, so let's just jump right into it.
00:01:25.270 - 00:01:27.510, Speaker A: What is cyber Connect?
00:01:27.660 - 00:01:53.810, Speaker B: Yes. Well, thanks so much for having me here. Cyber Connect is a social graph protocol where we want to give back the data sovereignty to users and that kind of enables developers to prepare for mass adoption and network effect within this social space where they can build on top of those social connections social data to enable their applications to be more engaging.
00:01:54.710 - 00:02:01.060, Speaker A: So why is the social aspect of web3? Why is that so important?
00:02:02.310 - 00:02:56.662, Speaker B: Well, a couple of things. One thing that it comes from my background, I've been working in social for quite a while now. My last two startups are also in the web3 social space. I think one biggest reason why social is really important at this moment is a lot of technological transitions happen when people actually like, when the tech hits massive scale, like DeFi is really fun. However, it only touches those amount of users that care about trading, that care about speculating. It's kind of similar back in the day when mobile was just beginning, where people are designing a lot of e commerce stuff. But what really brought e commerce to mass adoption is actually those social elements where Facebook, Instagram actually took off.
00:02:56.662 - 00:03:53.798, Speaker B: Everybody now are on a different platform that is just widely adopted. And then the other aspects those technology brought can be spread out a lot faster. I think this is what we observed before and now I think social can really onboard a lot more users into web3 in general and then they can start doing all kinds of stuff that's already being played out, like DFI, like NFT communities. And at the same time, I think social in general has been very. We have seen a lack of innovation in social, or a lot lack of trust as well. People always talk about how they are not comfortable with sharing all the data, how they are not able to really see new innovation or new applications come around where they can enjoy a better user experience. They are actually literally stuck with the same application they've been using for at least ten years now.
00:03:53.798 - 00:04:17.840, Speaker B: Let's say Instagram or Facebook. It's even more than ten years. So, yeah, just all kinds of different directions that all points back to, I think this is the right moment to do it, either for web3 onboarding or for the traditional social networks in general. I think there needs something new to bring more innovation into the space.
00:04:18.850 - 00:04:37.878, Speaker A: You mentioned that prior to cyber Connect, you've started two different companies all around social community. Can you tell me a little bit about those startups and where did you leave off with them?
00:04:37.964 - 00:05:50.974, Speaker B: Yeah, so I started my first startup, 2013 2014, which was into social. Back at the time, a group of my friends were our co founders, were thinking everybody is posting just nice photos on Instagram, posting those either highly filtered, photoshopped nice photos of them doing adventure stuff, or they're showing off their workout out and all kinds of stuff. They're just very small aspect of people and doesn't really look that real, and it creates like a strong barrier for anyone to post stuff or interact with their friends. So what we did was pretty much be real, but back in 2013 and 14, so people had to post something more natural, more spontaneous, and they have to interact. They turn on both cameras to take a selfie as well as like a photo of someone they're hanging out with. That was back in 2013 14. I exited earlier, but then the company still went on, and I think they're still working on in the same area.
00:05:50.974 - 00:06:59.534, Speaker B: And my recent company, my last company was called Lino Network and Dlive, which we were targeting content creators and helping them monetize better through crypto, was back in 2017. And we built everything, we built our own blockchain on Cosmos to support the kind of transaction that we want, like the specific transaction for content. Like when people create a post, when people donate on a post, when they subscribe to a post, or subscribe to a content creator, those transactions all happen on chain, especially those monetary ones, like the donations. And then we have an incentive model, or like the token inflation model, where there is a constant reward that's rewarded to the best monetized content. It's like giving out block rewards, but based on how the contents are perceived. I think the thing that we did really was interesting was we had PewDiePie as our streamer. So PewDiePie was still is the top YouTube streamer or YouTube YouTuber on the planet.
00:06:59.534 - 00:08:31.178, Speaker B: And PewDiePie in 2019 did an exclusive deal with us, streamed a whole year on Dlive, and we had more than 1 million daily active, and we onboarded about like 30 million people into a cosmos based wallet. And we transact more than a couple of millions every month at the time. And that company got acquired, but it got acquired by Bittorrent, by the way. The biggest takeaway from that is we saw how content creators, especially YouTubers and streamers, they only get like 30% of whatever that's going through the platform on Twitch or YouTube. At most, they can get like 50 or 70 if they're like a huge partner. But we see the monetization problem and the distribution problem where a lot of them are getting the channel getting canceled back the time there's like doctor disrespect or these are the old days, but we've seen this problem and we tried out in a crypto way, and it works really well in that extent. And we help support a lot of smaller creators that are in Venezuela, in Turkey, and they can get a global audience by taking those donations and subscriptions not only just from their own country, but from a global audience through the blockchain that we're designed so they don't have to transact in those banking system, but instead directly on chain.
00:08:31.178 - 00:08:37.460, Speaker B: But, yeah, that was the two experience that led me somehow to creating cyber connect.
00:08:37.830 - 00:08:48.962, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay, so that was like your first dive into crypto, and then from there you said, hey, I think that we can make this an even better solution.
00:08:49.106 - 00:08:49.462, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:49.516 - 00:08:52.920, Speaker A: And then you jumped into creating cyber connect.
00:08:54.250 - 00:10:14.340, Speaker B: Yes, just a little background on cyber Connect. My last company got acquired. We're just playing around and just observing web3, or like back DFI summer from the outside and just dabbling into it. One biggest observation was a lot of stuff happened on a lower protocol level, but on top of a common computing, which is most likely a UVM compatible compute environment, which is very different from what we did before we built our own blockchain on Cosmos, which we had our own validators, and it's like, not a generic or generalized computing environment. You don't have a lot of interaction with other third party developers. So that's how we take part of what we built before, and we want to just focus on building a social graph that is like a common data layer for developers to build on and leverage the same EVM that people are already familiar with to provide infrastructure for developers to build and for users to own their data. Just focus on that kind of layer instead of building out everything like what we did before.
00:10:14.870 - 00:10:30.600, Speaker A: Do you see a future where you could potentially expand beyond just EVM? Because you obviously have experience within Cosmos. What are your thoughts on what's happening on that side of the crypto world?
00:10:32.010 - 00:11:04.130, Speaker B: I wouldn't say I have the most up to date information about non EVM chains anymore. I'm still observing Solana and Cosmos. However, I think it's more about the developer community where they have this shelling point. If people all come to EVM, then no matter, there's different problems with EVMs. But we'll stick to EVMs for now and expand into Solana and Cosmos when time allows.
00:11:04.790 - 00:11:27.560, Speaker A: So let's talk about cyber connect in a little bit more detail, like what are some of the features that people can expect when they use this platform? And I have a few other questions that I want to ask about mainstream social platforms, since you have a lot of knowledge about that. But let's just start with some of the features that we can expect from cyber connect.
00:11:28.410 - 00:12:37.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm sorry, I spent so much time on my past experience. So cyber connect, really, it is a social graph protocol. So what that entails is really providing all the infrastructure for developers to build a full fledged social application. So normally a social network or social platforms are content fees or communication platforms where everything is surrounded around user identity or user profiles. Right? Like, you sign up for a new social platform, you either sign up for a new account, filling all your data, your bio description, your interest, and then you start interacting with other people through content, through community posts, through all kinds, or sometimes through messaging. And then that user to content or user to user kind of relationship is what really makes those social platforms valuable, and they can leverage those data to do other stuff or empower other platforms. Cyber Connect is trying to build that data layer in a self sovereign way.
00:12:37.054 - 00:13:45.438, Speaker B: So users own their own data, so nobody else can forge any data, or nobody can take away the access to their data when they want to export. Like when I want to export my Facebook friends to different applications, there's currently no way to do that. So Cyberkunt itself is really trying to provide that data layer that's publicly accessible and really follows the owner, the user sign up. So imagine when you log into any platform, you can directly log in with your cyber connect profile, and then you don't have to fill in any other information. And your followers, your friends, your previous contents are always available in a different application. And then those applications can sometimes skip the bootstrapping period where these users already are very profile rich, and then they have all their relationships stored on chain. And then those applications don't need to bootstrap the start period where they have to ask you to onboard all your friends, all those kind of stuff.
00:13:45.438 - 00:14:38.934, Speaker B: And because it's on chain, all the contents are monetizable and they're already tokenized. You can set up rules that's running in our middleware. So you can monetize your content by allowing people to mint a copy or collect a copy of your content, or in other ways. Like you can set up some crowdfunding content where you want people to raise funds directly. Or you can create communities around how only these kind of people can subscribe. To me, let's say if you want to create a board ape yacht club community, you want to set up a profile that only allows people with the board ape to subscribe to you and you can create exclusive content that only does your subscriber. Those ape holders can view those content.
00:14:38.934 - 00:15:23.220, Speaker B: So it really enables on chain programmability and monetization through this also shared database that's being used by different applications to put them into specific words. So there is the cyber kind of CC profile, what we call cyber kind of profile. Everyone owns a profile which comes with a username, comes with the basic metadata, and also avatar. And then there is the social graph. That's a set of smart contracts that ties those data back into a profile, like your post, your subscribers. And then there is what we are building on the peripheral, like the API engine, and then other stuff that we're still planning out.
00:15:25.130 - 00:16:23.960, Speaker A: I imagine starting a whole different social platform, because a lot of this has to do with human behavior, right? You have to really understand what makes people tick, what makes people be engaged. I imagine it's a very difficult, tall order. But I love the fact that you're tackling this, because right now, before social media, we didn't have anything. And then we had a few years where people have learned how to behave and think when it comes to these social platforms. And then we had these online dating platforms, right, where at first it was kind of considered almost like desperate. And then everybody was very much felt like it was normal to swipe right or left. How do you get to a place where this type of platform is the norm.
00:16:23.960 - 00:16:37.690, Speaker A: Is it an educational aspect? Is it more from a user experience standpoint, what's the main catalyst for creating this kind of adoption?
00:16:38.590 - 00:16:49.920, Speaker B: Yeah, why would you choose a different social platform? Is there a reason why you might want to migrate to a different platform?
00:16:51.730 - 00:17:18.774, Speaker A: If I'm not satisfied with my existing platform, then I think that opens up the door for, okay, what are my other options? Right. I wonder if when you talk about monetization, right, people monetizing, people automatically think, okay, YouTube, you can monetize that. Maybe they don't understand that they're only collecting, like you said, 30% of the revenue.
00:17:18.902 - 00:17:19.386, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:19.488 - 00:17:39.710, Speaker A: And there's an opportunity to kind of quote unquote, cut out the middleman. Right. Which is essentially what blockchain technology does through the use of smart contracts. So is it just a matter of education to help them understand that? Or what do you think is going to take for that mass adoption?
00:17:40.290 - 00:18:27.054, Speaker B: Yeah, I think your answer to that kind of also is what I was trying to answer, really. We have to find a product market fit where that's something. You can't just say, oh, because there's a mistrust among Twitter or Facebook that people are just going to stop using it, but more like there's something missing and this new platform is actually providing. And that's more concrete than just trust. Maybe it could be. You can't just put a decentralized anything to work, right? You can just say, oh, this is a decentralized Uber and let's use this different Uber. Or like this is a decentralized Twitter, a Twitter clone that lives on blockchain and we can all just use it.
00:18:27.054 - 00:20:13.540, Speaker B: It fundamentally has to solve something. And the way we are seeing it, Cybercun only provides the infrastructure layer and finding the product market fit on the product level or like a more customer accessible level is what we've seen either going through some niches that only the crypto community, focusing on the crypto community, the crypto tweets or those content can be a strong influence to have people migrate off of existing platforms and then take off from those niches to other areas where we get more recognition. But then another route would be, as you said, like monetization. We've tested this before with my last company as well as a lot of monetization models are enabled naturally by tokenization, like a lot of NFT communities, a lot of those governance model or just in general sponsorships on Gitcoin. There are various ways that crypto already enabled monetization and if we can help creators specifically do that and do it better than what web two companies are doing, then that could be a catalyst to wider adoption. And yeah, just to add on, on top of cyber Connect, we did build our own product that's called link three. So link three is a web3 native social network that's like a LinkedIn plus eventbrite or like Facebook profile, Facebook pages plus Facebook events back in the days when they were still early.
00:20:13.540 - 00:21:14.270, Speaker B: So everybody can sign up specifically for the crypto users. They can sign up for a profile with their wallets, acquiring a CC profile under the hood, and they can start linking up their crypto experiences, their crypto assets, their organization, what they've contributed to. Like very crypto focused group of people display their experience, or most likely professional experience. So if you visit link three two, Ryan, you'll be able to see everything that I've done before, also in my podcast before. I'll put this interview as well on there. So it's like a more really crypto focused group of people and then for organizations. So if you go to link three two, Cyber Connect, you can see the organization profile, and organizations can create web3 events, which is like AMA Discord Discord channels to encourage people to organize those events where you want people to sign up for joining a Twitter space or AMA.
00:21:14.270 - 00:22:05.560, Speaker B: And then based on some requirements, like if they stay at least 20 minutes, 30 minutes, you can distribute them proof of participation or what we call west token. That's inside the cyber kind of protocol. In that way, link three kind of becomes a platform for a lot of the. We have more than 1400 organizations on link three that's using the organization profile as well as the event hosting feature. And they can always target those group of web3 users who are looking for new projects or new opportunities to contribute. Yeah, that's kind of our approach to how to build something that's unique and fits a specific need.
00:22:06.570 - 00:22:31.100, Speaker A: That's interesting in regards to link three. So I'm assuming these mainstream social media platforms like Twitter, like Discord, I guess you can utilize specific APIs, right, to integrate with them, and then that way you're able to, essentially the two platforms are able to communicate with each other, is that correct?
00:22:31.730 - 00:23:18.342, Speaker B: Yeah. I can walk you through like a specific example for one of the biggest use cases for link three is hosting Mas or events. Normally you would be hosting MA on Twitter space where you can only let your Twitter followers kind of know that. And if they set up like a reminder or if they see like, you have a scheduled upcoming space, they can set a reminder themselves, or if you're actually in the MA, they can come join. But then there is no way of first giving them the opportunity to sign up ahead of time. There's no way for them to show that they actually were part of this AMA or they actually came or not. And there is no way of the organizers to show appreciation directly.
00:23:18.342 - 00:24:29.460, Speaker B: Like, oh, I can kind of recognize these people are early in my early community calls or in my product updates calls, or just like normal Mas. All of this Twitter related data are only on Twitter. There's no way of, I want to drop an NFT to all the people who actually came to my Twitter space. So we kind of integrate that into the link three product where users sign up like RSVP on link three, and by linking up their Twitter with their address during the MA, during the Twitter space, our bots will observe whether those people actually showed up, whoever they signed, like whoever that signed up, did they ever show up? And if they did, they can come and claim that they were part of it. So that's how we're leveraging those APIs and also providing extra functionality to the organizers. Sometimes they always have this demand of trying to issue NFTs or trying to reach those wallet addresses, not only just on the Twitter account.
00:24:31.110 - 00:25:13.780, Speaker A: So, so it sounds like Twitter, which is considered to already be somewhat of a crypto centric platform, but you're taking it a step further by really targeting these crypto communities. And you can do things like rewarding participants with an NFT, or you can just really be more target specific because everybody on this platform, link three, has an idea of what crypto is. So if you're hosting like, Twitter spaces, for instance, and they're revolved around blockchain technology, then you can leverage link three to kind of target that audience a little bit better.
00:25:14.470 - 00:26:10.990, Speaker B: Yes. Right now, if you go on link three, there's probably a couple, probably 200 events that's scheduled for the upcoming week or month. And users can just look through all these different events that's going to happen eventually on Twitter or on discord, but they can browse what kind of organization they're interested in, what kind of topic they're interested in, and they can just rsvp through that. And organizations have a better view of, oh, these are the demographic. All my audience that actually came are ape holders, or they're a punk holder, or they're interested in knowing more on arbitrum because their on chain data shows that they are playing around with arbitram and stuff. You get more dimension than just a Twitter because Twitter is only on the traditional social side, not really on the web3 interoperabble data side. There is no way for people to link up a wallet to a Twitter.
00:26:10.990 - 00:27:26.486, Speaker B: But yeah, link three is a product we built first to solve a problem that we see in those communities where they are having a hard time trying to organize those events and having a channel to distribute those events as well as those functionality. As you said, like the rewards and stuff. At the same time, all the link three data are written on csyrokin protocol. So now we are opening up this opportunity for people to build, like, we are really welcoming people to build into this ecosystem and leveraging those data. We already have 130,000 profile holders, cyber connect profile holders, and we have, as I said, 1400 organizations already using link three. So all these data, all these past experience, like, past history of users interacting with these organizations and link three events can be leveraged to build other social platforms. It could be a content specific platform, like someone can build a Twitter clone or someone can build, like, a community, a Dow community tooling that based around users history of interacting with those organizations on link three, because all the data lives on a shared data layer.
00:27:26.486 - 00:28:00.040, Speaker B: And yeah, speaking of that, we are actually hosting a hacknel right now that's going from February the 7th to march the 13th, where we invite a lot of developers to build on top. Currently, we have about 50 to 60 developers that's actively building, and users can expect some new product coming out of cyber Connect ecosystem after the hackathon ends. So not only link three is the only product, link three will not be the only product that lives on cyber Connect.
00:28:00.650 - 00:28:06.258, Speaker A: And I'm assuming you're going to post these updates on the cyber Connect Twitter profile.
00:28:06.434 - 00:28:12.490, Speaker B: Yes. Please follow. Please follow up on Cyber Connect's Twitter.
00:28:13.070 - 00:28:45.810, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I'll make sure to include the links in the description. Question for you, Ryan. So, Elon Musk, he's kind of like crypto, very volatile, right. In his thought process, is there a scenario where, let's say tomorrow, he says, you know what, we don't want these integrations to be available anymore. And what would happen to, say, link three if that was to transpire?
00:28:47.510 - 00:29:19.550, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. And we are actually seeing a lot of restriction from Twitter APIs all the time. And that's one of the reason why we are building a universal, accessible layer. Right. Like, as I said, if Twitter is entirely built on top of a decentralized social graph protocol, that there wouldn't be anything like API restriction or censorship. Everybody's seeing if they're building anything related to Twitter, they're seeing restriction on their API all the time. There is little we can do.
00:29:19.550 - 00:29:52.700, Speaker B: If they shut down the entire API, probably a lot of the products in crypto space that involves Twitter are not going to be able to operate if they shut down the API. However, I think that could create more potential for people to build on a shared data layer. That's what we're cyberkinet is building. So already people can build an entire Twitter clone on top of cyberkinet, where the data all lives on chain and lives in a public, accessible place.
00:29:55.150 - 00:30:50.460, Speaker A: Play along with me in this scenario. Let's say I am a very negative person, to say the least. I'm putting out a lot of bad information, information that if I was on Twitter or other platforms, most likely it would get me banned. But because link three is decentralized, I don't really have any fear. So I'm just letting all out, right? I'm putting all that information out there. From your humble opinion, what do you do in that scenario? Is it because it is decentralized? Like, do you allow me to express myself in whatever way I want to, or do you step in and provide some kind of restrictions there?
00:30:51.730 - 00:31:46.558, Speaker B: That's a great question. I think constant moderation is always one of the hardest problem for any content focus or social media type of platforms. The protocol itself is really enabling more possibilities like data, like data, interoperable kind of design space, but not encouraging people to leave just very negative or just wrong false facts in a decentralized way. Moderation happens on upper layer. The protocol itself is really providing the data accessible, but not caring about the content itself. But applications built on top have the responsibility of doing content moderation because the platforms are actually still abiding to the local laws. Right.
00:31:46.558 - 00:32:19.594, Speaker B: It's like uniswap as a protocol. It lives on universally accessible ethereum network, but then uniswap or a lot of these dexes, their trading application or the front ends are still under the same laws that governs other centralized exchanges, if that makes sense. So it's on different layer, and we still got to do all we were doing in web two to prevent contents from being just terribly wrong. Right.
00:32:19.632 - 00:32:33.200, Speaker A: So it sounds like what you're saying is you're providing a more decentralized option, but at the same time not so decentralized to where it's an animal that's out of control, got a mind of its own.
00:32:33.890 - 00:33:02.934, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. Technological advancement only provides optionality, but those optionality still has to live in the same space that governs every other platform. So you can't just build a platform where everything is false or everything is negative. That's not providing any value.
00:33:03.052 - 00:33:58.522, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that in some business models, it absolutely makes sense to kind of draw the line. I come from a security world, and when I work with a lot of clients, one of the most common vulnerabilities that we come across is centralization. And that's because a lot of projects, the way they're designed, they're not designed to be 100% fully decentralized, although I think there are some great use cases where you need that. But I think that in some cases, I guess in order to fulfill their business model, there are certain privileges you can't just renounce to a dow. Right. And so I like the approach also, because in order for us to transition into more of, like, a web3 model, you can't just go like, zero to 100.
00:33:58.576 - 00:33:58.794, Speaker B: Right.
00:33:58.832 - 00:34:31.810, Speaker A: You kind of take it like, step by step and sounds like you're transitioning people from where we are currently to one step at a time, which is the ability to maintain sovereignty, the ability to monetize your data, and all these other things that you talked about in regards to link three. So I'll make sure to include the links in the description. Ryan, it was a real pleasure to talk with you. Any parting thoughts for the listeners?
00:34:33.350 - 00:35:21.742, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one thing is for all the listeners, I think now it's the best time to really get involved in web3 social, because, as I said, a lot of the timings are pointing to this year or the coming year to be the prime for a lot of the web3 social protocols and as well as a lot of different experiments. Just be sure to check out what we are building here at cyber Connect, as well as all the projects that's going to ship on top of cyber connect. So you can have an experience directly interacting with those products. Or if you're a builder, please consider incorporating some of the universal social graph that we are providing to your. Yeah, thanks again for this opportunity.
00:35:21.876 - 00:35:29.330, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for coming on, Ryan. And I'll be sure to also include the video and network spotlight. And, yeah, it was a real pleasure to chat.
