00:00:00.170 - 00:00:02.190, Speaker A: Been going really well lately, for sure.
00:00:02.260 - 00:00:12.718, Speaker B: Things are starting to come together. We're getting more listings on both decentralized and centralized exchanges. We actually just had another centralized exchange last night, which was really cool. And then, yeah, just talking to a.
00:00:12.724 - 00:00:16.046, Speaker A: Lot of different teams across the ecosystem who are more willing than I'd say.
00:00:16.068 - 00:00:24.154, Speaker B: Before to bring liquidity over and paired against arch or paired against staples we have on, you know, like astrobalt or other platforms on archway.
00:00:24.202 - 00:00:31.270, Speaker C: So today, going to share with you a project you should put on your radar. It's a project you likely have not heard about.
00:00:31.420 - 00:00:32.742, Speaker D: Not yet, at least.
00:00:32.876 - 00:01:03.040, Speaker C: How do I know about it? Because I work in web3 security. But I would like to point out two things. At the time of this recording, I am not an investor in archway. In fact, archway is not available to the US residents. And two, my work on this channel is separate from my work at the security firm. Some of you know which one that is. If you like learning about early stage projects that have interesting tech, hit the like button, subscribe to the channel and share with your web3 friends so that they can learn too.
00:01:03.040 - 00:01:25.266, Speaker C: This is Max of Filabs. Filabs is the core contributor to Archway and L One in cosmos. The platform is structured to be developer focused, recognizing the pivotal role developers play in driving value. This type of incentive attracts talented builders. One in particular that has been catching my attention is astrovault.
00:01:25.378 - 00:01:35.466, Speaker B: One thing I just realized immediately was that there's a massive issue with token allocations, tokenomics, and how people are designing their basically token economy to never be.
00:01:35.488 - 00:01:38.838, Speaker A: Profitable or to really not have a clear path to sustainability.
00:01:39.014 - 00:01:43.018, Speaker B: So I would say about almost two years ago, Eric had kind of come.
00:01:43.024 - 00:01:49.966, Speaker A: Up with this concept and was kind of pitching it around the cosmos, trying to get it. I think originally was going to be built on secret. There just didn't work out in terms.
00:01:49.988 - 00:01:51.614, Speaker B: Of funding, timing, resources, everything.
00:01:51.652 - 00:01:55.374, Speaker A: So they were kind of looking for a new place to land and I was already talking to their team and.
00:01:55.412 - 00:01:59.634, Speaker B: Archway came along and they had really cool concept. I really bought into the idea of.
00:01:59.672 - 00:02:01.762, Speaker A: The application layer being what drives value.
00:02:01.816 - 00:02:03.218, Speaker B: And then that the developers need to.
00:02:03.224 - 00:02:04.162, Speaker A: Have it while you're sharing it.
00:02:04.216 - 00:02:05.874, Speaker B: So the overall ethos kind of made.
00:02:05.912 - 00:02:07.714, Speaker D: Sense to me with it being like.
00:02:07.752 - 00:02:17.158, Speaker A: A very economically focused but also developer focused chain. And I thought it made a lot of sense for Astrovalt and so did Eric. So that was kind of the original connection, almost was.
00:02:17.324 - 00:02:18.678, Speaker B: We saw this chain that aligned in.
00:02:18.684 - 00:02:19.222, Speaker A: A lot of ways.
00:02:19.276 - 00:02:21.126, Speaker B: They had a really strong team and.
00:02:21.148 - 00:02:29.910, Speaker A: Eric had this really cool project that would work well. So they kind know joined forces. And so I've actually been a proponent of their decks even before it was called Astrovault.
00:02:29.990 - 00:02:39.470, Speaker C: Max has been a fan of Astrovault for a while now, but what is so special about this decentralized exchange? Pay close attention to what Max has to say.
00:02:39.540 - 00:02:45.118, Speaker A: It's actually a very similar model to what it's almost.
00:02:45.204 - 00:02:49.294, Speaker B: If you really break it down, it's very, very similar. The difference you kind of would notice.
00:02:49.342 - 00:03:08.262, Speaker A: Is on astrovault you have x assets, or like derivatives that will show you they're basically your voucher to redeem your state collateral. Whereas on Coinbase, instead of them giving you a voucher, they just give you the liquid tokens like Adam, but they just give you 5% APR because they're staking the underlying and they're taking the difference.
00:03:08.396 - 00:03:08.838, Speaker D: Right.
00:03:08.924 - 00:03:11.786, Speaker A: But what they're not doing is verifying with the user that they have the.
00:03:11.808 - 00:03:17.226, Speaker B: Right to pull these out. So that's why you'll see withdrawals paused on Coinbase here and there, because they.
00:03:17.248 - 00:03:20.486, Speaker D: Just don't have the liquid assets to let people withdraw.
00:03:20.518 - 00:03:40.334, Speaker A: So they have to wait, they have to unstake, they have to bring in liquid assets. So with, at least with astroball, because it's on chain, you can monitor these things and you can see verifiably that your staked assets are actually staked to the native network. So one thing I think that they do with these x assets is just a lot more visibility into the model and into what's actually backing the liquidity.
00:03:40.382 - 00:03:41.326, Speaker B: That is in these pools.
00:03:41.358 - 00:03:43.886, Speaker A: Right, and these derivatives, because ultimately you're.
00:03:43.918 - 00:03:44.946, Speaker B: Only getting that once a quarter from.
00:03:44.968 - 00:03:47.218, Speaker A: Coinbase via their ten Q and then.
00:03:47.224 - 00:03:49.522, Speaker B: Annually with their ten K that they file with the SEC.
00:03:49.656 - 00:03:52.166, Speaker A: So I think that's where it's like.
00:03:52.348 - 00:03:53.286, Speaker B: We need to take more of these.
00:03:53.308 - 00:03:59.814, Speaker A: Web two concepts that work like Coinbase, like a real business model that is profitable and bring it on chain. And the only difference is the fees.
00:03:59.862 - 00:04:01.478, Speaker B: And the staking rewards are split amongst.
00:04:01.494 - 00:04:03.590, Speaker A: The LPs instead of just Coinbase.
00:04:03.670 - 00:04:41.810, Speaker C: Max compares Astrovault to Coinbase, pointing out that Coinbase, with a chance of pausing withdrawals due to a lack of liquid assets, lacks the transparency that Astrovault provides through its use of x assets. For clear collateral redemption, he suggests bringing successful web two models onto the blockchain, and emphasizes Astrovault's transparency, enabling users to easily monitor and verify their staked assets, unlike Coinbase's less clear quarterly and annual reporting. But we know how easy it is to use Coinbase. What about Astrovault?
00:04:41.970 - 00:04:48.274, Speaker A: So I think there's a couple of things. Like one, creating an easy on ramp is, number one, make it easy for someone to get into your protocol.
00:04:48.322 - 00:04:53.638, Speaker B: And I think they've done a really good job with that. So they've set up like fee grants. Like if you bridge over, let's say.
00:04:53.644 - 00:04:58.726, Speaker A: Like one atom, I think the minimum is 0.5. It'll actually fee grant you a small amount of arch so you can make.
00:04:58.748 - 00:05:01.534, Speaker B: Your first transaction on their and you don't have to go anywhere to do that.
00:05:01.572 - 00:05:06.394, Speaker A: So as long as you bridge in that atom, you'll have the arch for gas so that you can swap that atom into arch.
00:05:06.442 - 00:05:09.178, Speaker B: And now you're ready to go be in the ecosystem.
00:05:09.274 - 00:05:20.354, Speaker A: They'll have the same thing with USDC through Noble. So those are like big pieces just to onboard users and make it easy to get into the ecosystem and start using applications. But ultimately with Astrobal, they're going to.
00:05:20.392 - 00:05:25.266, Speaker B: Have more of like a hardcore user base, right? They're going to have the more hardcore defi user base, I should say.
00:05:25.368 - 00:05:26.786, Speaker A: So I think they're kind of aiming.
00:05:26.818 - 00:05:30.854, Speaker B: At a different demographic because they're really.
00:05:30.892 - 00:05:35.506, Speaker A: Looking for one protocol teams. So like actual layer ones who want to provide liquidity.
00:05:35.618 - 00:05:40.486, Speaker B: So almost like institutional you could frame it as, right, because what they're trying to do is take dead capital and.
00:05:40.508 - 00:05:46.310, Speaker A: Bring it over to the exchange, utilize it, make it. So now it's securing the native networks.
00:05:46.390 - 00:05:48.138, Speaker B: Because if you take some of your.
00:05:48.144 - 00:05:49.594, Speaker A: Community pool and you bring it over.
00:05:49.632 - 00:05:50.730, Speaker B: Let'S say just to make it easy.
00:05:50.800 - 00:05:52.426, Speaker A: Atom, they bring over some atom from.
00:05:52.448 - 00:05:54.814, Speaker B: The community pool, they put it on astroval, right?
00:05:54.932 - 00:05:56.986, Speaker A: So now Astroval will stake that underlying.
00:05:57.018 - 00:05:59.338, Speaker D: Atom to the atom hub and you'll.
00:05:59.354 - 00:06:02.234, Speaker B: Get your x asset as your derivative asset.
00:06:02.362 - 00:06:11.634, Speaker A: So what they're doing is now securing the atom network. They're putting more atom bonded to the network, further securing it. Meanwhile, you're still letting the users use.
00:06:11.672 - 00:06:14.238, Speaker D: That derivative asset to continue to trade.
00:06:14.254 - 00:06:25.926, Speaker A: It and do things with it and get more capital, efficiency, knowing that you're actually earning from it still. Because if you're in these pools, you're earning those emissions, they're going to the LPs. So it's really just allowing people to.
00:06:25.948 - 00:06:29.862, Speaker B: Further incentivize and utilize their derivatives while.
00:06:29.916 - 00:06:32.974, Speaker A: Still securing the native network, which to me is great utility.
00:06:33.042 - 00:06:52.442, Speaker C: To sum up, astrovault prioritizes user friendly onboarding with fee grants, targeting a dedicated deFi user base and incentivizing the use of derivatives to secure native networks and enhance capital efficiency. All right, Max, what about other integrations on Archway? Anything really interesting worth sharing?
00:06:52.586 - 00:06:54.638, Speaker A: One thing I saw recently, actually, yeah.
00:06:54.644 - 00:06:55.486, Speaker B: I'd say one thing I saw pretty.
00:06:55.508 - 00:06:57.406, Speaker A: Recently was cool, is mempools.
00:06:57.518 - 00:07:00.002, Speaker B: They do like on chain alerting, event.
00:07:00.056 - 00:07:02.626, Speaker A: Alerting for on chain events and things like that.
00:07:02.648 - 00:07:05.986, Speaker B: And they've been integrated, I think, with a few different chains, but certainly with.
00:07:06.008 - 00:07:11.462, Speaker A: Archway and a lot of our wallets. So you can get push notifications to your phone. But what I think is really cool.
00:07:11.516 - 00:07:16.374, Speaker B: Is that they're actually adding a feature to basically it's called ZK automate, and.
00:07:16.412 - 00:07:21.362, Speaker A: It really is using ZK to run automated event triggering.
00:07:21.426 - 00:07:24.458, Speaker B: It's similar to like a cron job, but what's really unique is that it.
00:07:24.464 - 00:07:26.346, Speaker A: Can be done codeless, so you can.
00:07:26.368 - 00:07:28.618, Speaker B: Kind of set up workflows with kind.
00:07:28.624 - 00:07:30.586, Speaker D: Of drag and drop and putting it.
00:07:30.608 - 00:07:35.214, Speaker A: Out into a workflow and then creating the actual underlying code to run it.
00:07:35.252 - 00:07:39.054, Speaker B: So even a non developer could build out strategies. And this could be something as simple.
00:07:39.092 - 00:07:41.434, Speaker A: As auto compounding or restaking.
00:07:41.482 - 00:07:43.674, Speaker B: It could be as simple as collecting.
00:07:43.722 - 00:07:45.918, Speaker A: Rewards, swapping them and then sending them.
00:07:45.924 - 00:07:52.290, Speaker B: To a different chain, swapping them to a different asset. So then it opens up this possibility for arbitrage strategies and all these different.
00:07:52.360 - 00:07:55.170, Speaker A: Things you can do just by automating events on chain.
00:07:55.750 - 00:07:56.738, Speaker D: And then on top of that, what.
00:07:56.744 - 00:07:57.558, Speaker B: I think is really cool is the.
00:07:57.564 - 00:08:00.406, Speaker D: Zk side, because then it protects at.
00:08:00.428 - 00:08:02.338, Speaker A: Least like pre execution like strategies.
00:08:02.434 - 00:08:04.866, Speaker D: So you can basically have a strategy.
00:08:04.898 - 00:08:07.126, Speaker B: That is not public to everyone, so.
00:08:07.148 - 00:08:09.270, Speaker A: They can't just copy trade you, or steal it.
00:08:09.340 - 00:08:10.406, Speaker D: But what you could do is then.
00:08:10.428 - 00:08:12.714, Speaker A: Allow them access to it so that.
00:08:12.832 - 00:08:15.674, Speaker B: You can earn from it, basically monetize your own strategies you're building.
00:08:15.792 - 00:08:19.226, Speaker A: So I think that's a really cool use case in general, is just being.
00:08:19.248 - 00:08:23.686, Speaker B: Able to create automated workflows. Whether you're running a business on chain.
00:08:23.718 - 00:08:27.278, Speaker A: Whether you're a protocol team trying to manage a treasury, or you're just a.
00:08:27.284 - 00:08:29.738, Speaker D: User trying to automate daily tasks, it's.
00:08:29.754 - 00:08:32.698, Speaker B: An amazing tool for that and allow anyone to basically be able to do that on chain.
00:08:32.714 - 00:08:34.426, Speaker D: And I think that's huge for setting.
00:08:34.458 - 00:08:43.086, Speaker B: Up more, I guess, user friendly ways of interacting. And it creates on chain activity, which is ultimately what drives value, at least archway.
00:08:43.278 - 00:08:59.798, Speaker C: What's cool is that it adds a layer of protection so that your strategies aren't easily copied by others. This feature streamlines on chain activities and ultimately contributes to the overall value of archway. Another reason to like the chain. Now, Max mentioned ZK automate.
00:08:59.894 - 00:09:02.378, Speaker D: I hear about zk a lot, but.
00:09:02.464 - 00:09:43.938, Speaker C: Not a lot around cosmos. First, let's take a look at what ZK is. In zk row ups, the term zero knowledge refers to the use of zero knowledge proofs for on chain transaction verification without requiring interaction or trust. Zero knowledge proofs are cryptographic proofs that can demonstrate a statement's truth without disclosing any information about the statement itself. Zk technology is going to play a critical role in the next bull run because we're trying to find a balance between preserving the privacy and also understanding who the users are from a regulatory perspective. But do we have this type of technology in cosmos?
00:09:44.034 - 00:09:47.894, Speaker A: In the cosmos, it's definitely being worked on, but it's not as prevalent. I know a few teams working on.
00:09:47.932 - 00:09:57.494, Speaker B: Different zk type projects. Like another cool one is fairblock. I've been talking to Payman, who's one of the co founders of Fairblock, and they're actually building, I think, a module for the SDK.
00:09:57.542 - 00:10:03.294, Speaker A: But it basically provides mempool privacy, or like pre execution privacy, so at least.
00:10:03.332 - 00:10:09.326, Speaker B: It prevents front running, so you could trade on know without being front run or sandwich attacked or what have you.
00:10:09.348 - 00:10:11.802, Speaker A: So even just like having certain protections.
00:10:11.866 - 00:10:14.106, Speaker D: Like, adding a module that can encrypt.
00:10:14.138 - 00:10:25.250, Speaker B: The mempool prior to transaction, is a huge benefit to the cosmos and really helps prevent a lot of the stuff we see with MeV happening on Ethereum. So, like, Fairblock's a really cool one, and they're using zk as well to do that.
00:10:25.400 - 00:10:30.406, Speaker A: So there's definitely projects being built that will utilize ZK. A lot of the privacy projects will.
00:10:30.428 - 00:10:32.198, Speaker D: Probably incorporate it more, but there's a.
00:10:32.204 - 00:10:37.506, Speaker B: Lot of value to ZKPs, even outside of just using them for a privacy chain.
00:10:37.618 - 00:10:39.506, Speaker D: You could eventually use ZKPs.
00:10:39.698 - 00:10:41.206, Speaker B: There's another product that's actually being worked on.
00:10:41.228 - 00:10:43.162, Speaker A: Now, if I say that to basically.
00:10:43.216 - 00:10:45.882, Speaker B: Verify KYC, you basically have to have.
00:10:45.936 - 00:10:48.154, Speaker A: A third party who's going to house.
00:10:48.352 - 00:10:53.910, Speaker B: The records, and then they will basically verify via zk proof that you qualified.
00:10:53.990 - 00:10:56.186, Speaker D: For whatever criteria was selected.
00:10:56.298 - 00:10:59.002, Speaker B: Assuming you passed, then it just gives them the result that it was verified.
00:10:59.066 - 00:11:03.146, Speaker A: That it was correct and you're passing KYc. So now there's a way for decentralized.
00:11:03.178 - 00:11:05.726, Speaker D: Protocols to build KYC and AML directly.
00:11:05.758 - 00:11:08.306, Speaker A: Into their interface without actually getting the.
00:11:08.328 - 00:11:13.346, Speaker B: User data or like putting the user data at risk. The user can basically just verify that.
00:11:13.368 - 00:11:15.906, Speaker D: What they said is true without having.
00:11:15.928 - 00:11:17.922, Speaker A: To give that information to the actual protocol.
00:11:17.986 - 00:11:23.846, Speaker B: So it's very interesting from a user security side, and also just something I.
00:11:23.868 - 00:11:31.078, Speaker A: Think is much needed in this space is the ability to comply with regulations and do things like KYC from the.
00:11:31.084 - 00:11:32.438, Speaker B: Front end so you can protect yourself.
00:11:32.524 - 00:11:35.602, Speaker A: As an application owner or a builder.
00:11:35.746 - 00:11:52.140, Speaker C: Tons of amazing stuff happening in Cosmos on archway. You're a builder considering building on archway.
