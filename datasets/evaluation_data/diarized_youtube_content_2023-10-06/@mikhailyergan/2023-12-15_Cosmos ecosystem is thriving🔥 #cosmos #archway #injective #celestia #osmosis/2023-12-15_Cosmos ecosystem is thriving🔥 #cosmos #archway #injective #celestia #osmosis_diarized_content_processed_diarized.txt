00:00:00.250 - 00:00:41.478, Speaker A: I mean, I think the cosmos has pretty much faced the same, if not worse, than what FTX did. Because at least with FTX is like, a lot of the collateral is locked or stuck until they kind of figured out through either liquidations or bankruptcy, where it was going. With terra Luna, it was just like a straight bank run, like exit liquidity to the bottom. And so that really tested not only terra, but the entire cosmos ecosystem, because it brought the entire ecosystem down with it due to how much ust and Luna exposure all these chains had. So that, to me, was like, the ultimate sign that there's a lot of resiliency in the cosmos ecosystem as well. And also a reason why I think that, in general, there's going to be a handful of cosmos chains that are poised for this next bull run. Strictly because of that.
00:00:41.478 - 00:00:54.940, Speaker A: We've seen that it can survive one of the biggest black swan events you can imagine and continue building through a market where there's almost no inflow of money and come out the other side with some really innovative product. So, yeah, I think cosmos has been tested just as much as anybody in the space, to be quite honest.
