00:00:00.250 - 00:00:59.980, Speaker A: So if you can use something like web free, which traditionally is very good at connecting suppliers, buyers and moving intermediaries, then why not do that? And we're doing that in a different way to maybe some other refi players in the ecosystem. They're moving towards decentralization a lot quicker than we intend to, because it's much harder to convince existing market players, existing buyers of carbon credits, to move into this new space, to move into this new innovative space without offering them the comfort that the existing market offers them. So we have to be pragmatic. We have to move in steps. And if that means moving towards decentralization in a year or two years, once we've built out that market, once we've made some of market access, trust us on both the supply and buy side, then that's what we'll do. Close.
