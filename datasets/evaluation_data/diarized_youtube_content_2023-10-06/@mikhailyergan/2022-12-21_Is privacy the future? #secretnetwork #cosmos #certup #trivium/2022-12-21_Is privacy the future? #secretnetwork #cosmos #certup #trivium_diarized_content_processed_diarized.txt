00:00:00.090 - 00:00:59.900, Speaker A: Trivium specifically is trying to modify existing systems for certifications and diplomas and other important documents. So things I think that we're really seeing a trend of bringing in web3 and blockchain to modify the rest of the world's infrastructure, rather than just very closed systems of D and NFTs that we've seen before. And part of this is because of advents in privacy in blockchain, like, for example, with the secret network. A lot of this stuff wouldn't be possible without the privacy that secret network provides. And we're only going to see that accelerate as other projects and protocols start coming out with their own privacy solutions as well. We're going to see more and more projects be able to make complex applications that wouldn't have been possible in earlier stages of blockchain development. Close.
