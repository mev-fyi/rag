00:00:00.400 - 00:00:16.370, Speaker A: The week before FTX crashed, and we didn't even bat an eye when that happened. And frankly, there's a lot of projects from other ecosystems coming to Solana. I know that firsthand because, you know, our Dev shop is doing a lot of those portings from other ecosystems to Solana.
00:00:19.110 - 00:00:40.642, Speaker B: Today I'm joined by Jeff of WBA, who's no stranger to the channel. He's been here multiple times. In fact, back in March 2023, when Solana was trading at $20 and everybody gave up on the whole entire ecosystem, he was here telling us not to panic. And, in fact, he doubled down through his cohort. Jeff, welcome back to the show.
00:00:40.706 - 00:00:45.330, Speaker A: Thanks. Appreciate it. Always good to connect, my friend. Good to see you. Sorry, it's been a minute.
00:00:45.450 - 00:01:24.610, Speaker B: You always see things ahead of its time. Like I said, back in a year ago, over a year ago, you knew what was coming before anybody else did. And all of a sudden, it was a surprise to everybody. But for you, it was old news, because you knew what was happening on the development side. And they always say, follow the developers. And so that's why I have you on here, to tell us from a development perspective what's new, what's happening in Solana, what can we expect here in the next year or so? So let's start with the overall picture. Over the course of the last six months or so, what has changed in the Solana ecosystem?
00:01:25.430 - 00:02:07.870, Speaker A: The reason I was so bullish when we first came over, and frankly, we actually signed to do what we do over here the week before FTX crashed, and we didn't even bat an eye when that happened. So what's changed is what's rolled out. But what's the same is the culture and the community and the focus on the technology for the long term that drew us to Solana. You know, we really wanted to be in a place that we felt like we could set up a home and live for a long time. We didn't want to, you know, kind of be that renegade going chain to chain, trying to get a little bit of money here and there, just to stand up and institute and then move on to the next. That's just not how we're wired. None of us wanted to do that.
00:02:07.870 - 00:02:45.930, Speaker A: And so, you know, we wanted to pick a place, you know, and sit down some roots. And so we needed a community and a culture that fit us. And, you know, we're believers. We're people that believe that this is going to be world changing technology and way of life. And, you know, that this is going to be a place in a way that people interact. And we believe then, and we believe stronger every day that Solana is the place. And, you know, you ask why, you know, really smart people are here and really smart people who care about this community and the, the hard times have galvanized the people here.
00:02:45.930 - 00:03:16.860, Speaker A: Yeah, there's healthy competition. Yeah. Not everybody loves each other. There are some groups that there's some volatility in confrontation. But by and large, everybody has this conviction for Solana as a place for a certain part of the blockchain future, being important and impactful. That's what drew us. That's what keeps things moving forward, and we're seeing things coming out.
00:03:16.860 - 00:03:55.984, Speaker A: People from other environments always like to say, well, it's centralized because the hardware is expensive. Well, no, I mean, there's 3000 nodes, and the Nakamoto coefficient is the best. In blockchain. Everyone could define what centralization or decentralization is in their own definition. We feel really good about the decentralization of Solana now, and the fact that with another new client, with fire dancer coming out, which I can talk about in a minute, the more clients that are out there, the more people are using SVM. Again, another topic. I was just in a chat with a group of people talking about svms.
00:03:55.984 - 00:04:03.860, Speaker A: When I say svms, I mean off main net integration or implementations of SVM for other environments and other use cases.
00:04:04.990 - 00:04:19.486, Speaker B: And just to kind of like, add a little bit more context, SVM is Solana virtual machine, is that correct? Yeah, the same way we have EVM, which is ethereum virtual machine, and all the EVM compatible chains. You have something similar in SVM, which is Solana.
00:04:19.518 - 00:05:21.082, Speaker A: Yeah, and, I mean, I would caveat that with, it's very important that people who are not on Solana understand that the rolling out of, you know, what are essentially L two svms and SVM roll ups is not for the same reason that, say, EVM has them. EVM has them for scaling and trying to solve problems with performance and scalability. And that's where all of that came from. The use of the SVM in these different environments is more to have more fine grained control over some specific use cases, to be able to have permissioned environments, to have a roll up that is gaming specific. So you can tune that SVM specific to your use case, not because Solana has any performance cost efficiency problems. It's, we can take this technology and use it to have an environment somewhere else that is more specific. Maybe it's an enterprise use case or what have you? The other thing that's very different about the term SVM versus something like EVM is.
00:05:21.082 - 00:06:02.410, Speaker A: EVM is a very defined box with the. Everyone knows what those pieces in the EVM are. The SVM is nothing. When I talk about the SVM, and this is just me, this is, you know, because I work with that technology, I think everything from the bottom of the, you know, the program layer programs on Solana or smart contracts, bottom of the program layer to the metal is SVM. It's just everything that makes Solana run. Some people would say it's only what's called the TPU, the transaction processing unit of. Some people would say, no, you need the TPU and the TVU, which is the transaction validating unit.
00:06:02.410 - 00:06:43.450, Speaker A: Some people say you also need turbine, which is the propagation machine. Some people say you also need, you know, Cloudbreak, which is, you know, funneling content to the database. Some people think you need the database in there, too. So, I mean, there's a lot of different interpretations. And, you know, part of the reason that there's so much energy in this is that they're all really great pieces, and decoupling and maybe legoing them together for different use cases is really central to the ethos of the Solano ecosystem of, you know, let's iterate on good stuff and try to make something new that's really excellent for a specific use case.
00:06:43.870 - 00:07:30.518, Speaker B: So I want to take a real quick, Jeff, I want to take a step back, because the narratives. When you look at the narratives on Solana right now, and if you just look at on chain activity, you can even argue that, look, pump fund. That application alone has generated more fees than Ethereum as a whole. So there's a lot of great news coming out of Solana, but what are your thoughts on the fact that a lot of it is primarily around meme coins in that narrative? It doesn't necessarily help the developer on Solana, though, right? I know that deepen is another narrative that's really big within the Solana ecosystem. You've shared with me a lot of tools coming out for the gamers, but how come we haven't seen that? All we're seeing right now is the meme side.
00:07:30.574 - 00:08:00.582, Speaker A: Well, I mean, it also depends on where you're looking. I would say this. There's a group called Magic Block that just put out tooling where you're going to be able to play on chain games with real time, you know, real game experience. Well, you know, 20. You know, 20 gunshots in 20 milliseconds. You know, kind of thing that is, that is all coming. Some of that game stuff just takes a little bit longer to develop.
00:08:00.582 - 00:08:58.080, Speaker A: I mean, games take a long time, but that, you know, I would encourage people to look at magic block and what they're doing because that is changing the face of gaming on chain. And, you know, look, the public optics, especially on crypto, Twitter and stuff like that, it's going to always be about stuff that's, that's money centric, that's investor centric. That's what gets people fired up and talking. They talk about price action and meme coins and all that. And where I am, meme coins are 5% of what I see on a daily basis. DPIn is a much bigger innovation and for anybody, it's like, well, DPin helium network is making an impact in the cellular services world, not just on, in web3, but I mean, people are using helium, $20 a month, and then if you set up your own hotspot, you can actually get cellular service and Internet for free because you're earning. And that's happening.
00:08:58.080 - 00:09:34.294, Speaker A: I mean, people are using this all over the world. It seems like every other day there's another city that says we have helium service. And the service is akin to the t mobile service because they use their towers. Pretty sure they use their towers. I know they have some relationship there, but so, I mean, Deepin is big, you know, Hivemapper is another one that is basically Google Maps, where people can earn by helping map the world and keep track of traffic and things like that. These are real world use cases that are on Solana right now that people are using globally. So, you know, but they're not as sexy as my meme coin just pumped 1000 x and I made all this money.
00:09:34.294 - 00:10:00.842, Speaker A: Or my meme coin rugged. It's not as dramatic. You don't hear about it as much. It's like you turn on the regular news at night on television. You're not going to hear good news, you're going to hear crappy news, you're going to hear dramatic news that is emotionally polarizing to one end of the needle spectrum or another. You're not going to hear Johnny got straight a's and came up with a solution for some problem in his science class. You don't get that now.
00:10:00.842 - 00:10:49.460, Speaker A: Is Johnny making any less impact than, you know, the, you know, the cat that got rescued out of the burning of building? Of course he is, but people don't care about that. People want to see the exciting adventure that distracts them from their lives. So, look, meme coins are big and they are impactful. And anybody that says that they're, you know, fake or whatever, go to a card collection conference and tell me how busy and how wild and fanatical people who trade Pokemon cards or magic cards or sports trading cards, that's what memes are. You know, meme coins are these trading. They're tradables that have a value, and people are playing and having fun trading them, and that's what people are investing. It's like gambling.
00:10:49.460 - 00:11:20.310, Speaker A: It is like gambling. You know, I had a friend who said to me, you know, don't go into gambling like you're trying to win money, whatever it costs you to go play craps at a table on a casino boat, you're paying for the entertainment, people are paying for the entertainment. And if they make a couple bucks off it, great. That's how I feel about the meme coin thing. Yeah, it gets a lot of the optics because it is, you know, it's going to get viewers more than magic block is going to make your latency for playing their game better.
00:11:21.220 - 00:11:43.292, Speaker B: In a lot of ways. It's the environment that made it so that meme coins could thrive. You've got low transaction feeds, fast speed. So for retail users, that's amazing. What are some of the tools that are coming out on Solana? And then also to follow up with that, what narratives do you think would benefit most from those tools?
00:11:43.476 - 00:12:56.550, Speaker A: Look, every passing day, better developer tooling is coming out. Ethereum has foundry, which is this kind of one stop shop for developer tooling that really makes their lives better. And one of the things that a lot of us and Solana foundation is really helping is trying to aggregate all the best tooling into a kind of a suite like that. So that is something that's happening now that's being worked on. The aforementioned SVM. I was just in a chat before we got on a call where there's close to 200 people in this chat, all working on permission environments, permissionless environments, roll ups, use case specific roll ups, enterprise roll ups, gaming roll ups, etcetera. And again, just to try to take the power of Solana's technology and iterate on it and work to find a good product market fit to serve another pocket of the community and give a good user experience with fast transactions, inexpensive transactions, and a user experience with that type of product, that is unparalleled.
00:12:56.550 - 00:14:04.600, Speaker A: So this is big, this is coming, and then fire dancers coming. And if you haven't heard about fire dancer, fire dancer is being built by the team at jump, you know, the best high frequency trading technology builders on the planet have rebuilt the Solana validator purely in c to be more performant, but also to give us, depends on who you ask, a second or a third client. And that's going to make a huge difference. It's going to make the ecosystem faster, more robust, more stable. It is probably going to bring in more c developers who are going to say, you know what, I can write some programs and see, and I could do more and see because I'm not going to use rust. For me, it's about becoming a more secure, faster, more robust, stable for a long term viability play. And it's also about bringing developers in who want to build on this technology and being in an environment that is really fearless about, I'm going to try this, and if it doesn't work, fine.
00:14:04.600 - 00:14:30.344, Speaker A: I've got tremendous respect for the research focus of the EVM environment and the community they are. Research first, iterate second. I'd say Solan is we're going to research as we go, but we're going to try to build this stuff and see what works. And that's going to be part of our research, rather than let's research this out and get it down pat. Where we start to build, it's just different. One's not better than the other. It's just about fit what fits you personally.
00:14:30.344 - 00:15:16.020, Speaker A: So those are a couple of them. We are about to drop a big product from turbine, which is called Poseidon. Poseidon is a framework that we built and developed, or rather developed and built in that order, that allows developers to write Solana programs in typescript. So this will, you know, this is going to attract a lot of people who don't want to write programs in rust to the Solana ecosystem because they come with, you know, typescript. JavaScript is the most, the most used programming language in the world. So giving those people a framework that they can write programs, smart contracts that compile down to the Solana virtual machine, that's a pretty big one. So that's just within the next month that will be public.
00:15:16.020 - 00:15:59.180, Speaker A: So there is a lot of work. There's also a lot of product, and frankly, there's a lot of projects from other ecosystems coming to Solana. I know that firsthand because our Dev shop is doing a lot of those portings from other ecosystems to Solana. So it is busy. The other thing I'll say that I think is important is I'm a big fan of leadership, being a catalyst for the culture. Nothing resonates with me as an individual more than seeing a guy like Toley being transparent, authentic and available, and not afraid to engage anybody in a conversation. Say, this is who we are, this is what makes us great.
00:15:59.180 - 00:16:22.530, Speaker A: These are our awards. This is what we need to work on. This is what we're good at. And constantly pushing people to just make this your own, use it, try to make it better. Just that encouragement and him being in the trenches himself, it's just inspiring. I mean, the leadership in Solana is most resonates with me, and I think that's another big part of it.
00:16:24.230 - 00:16:56.008, Speaker B: And obviously you work very closely with the Sawana foundation, so you are very familiar with his character. Great to know. Going back to the tools that you mentioned, a lot of amazing stuff happening from a tech perspective. If you had to pick one vertical that you think would benefit most from this, obviously we know about meme coins. We are also familiar about deepen. But what other vertical do you think is poised to benefit most from this type of tooling that is getting ready to roll out?
00:16:56.184 - 00:17:46.680, Speaker A: Look, I think the big three in the short term, and when I say short term, I mean the next five years, which is actually long term in crypto, I think anything that's trading oriented is going to prefer a fast, cheap, smooth ux. I think gaming is going to benefit tremendously from things like what magic block and what Turbo is doing. Turbo is a game engine that's rost and that's Solana native and DPin. I think DPIn works really well just because, you know, it's. It's requires fast interactive response and return. You know, as far as other things, you know, I just. I hope that there's more stuff coming.
00:17:46.680 - 00:18:30.420, Speaker A: You know, I. A lot of people don't like how celebrities are getting involved in crypto with some of the meme coin stuff and some of the rwas and things like that. You know, Scottie pippen and, you know, own a piece of the game ball from game five. I love that any engagement that you can get from people in the spotlight, I think it's good. It's like any, you know, any attention is good attention when you're trying to grow. It just lets people know what's going on. I would say another thing that's happening, RCTO is working on it is native bitcoin on Solana that is very close to being rolled out.
00:18:30.420 - 00:18:57.670, Speaker A: And that's a big deal. I mean, people being able to trade and acquire and do things with bitcoin and Defi at Solana speed and cost is a really big deal for your native crypto users. But I'm always thinking about the people who aren't here yet. We tell our people in our cohorts, build for the people that aren't here yet, because you don't got to convince the ones who are to join. Build for people who are not here yet.
00:18:59.180 - 00:19:07.716, Speaker B: Amazing. Always. Always. Great, Alpha. I really appreciate it. Give us a quick rundown. What are you up to at WBA?
00:19:07.788 - 00:19:24.796, Speaker A: So we are. Look, we're super busy. So the salon arm of WBA is called turbine.com for our website, except it's not an e, it's a three. So. Turbin, three.com. we are in our 7th cohort.
00:19:24.796 - 00:19:59.296, Speaker A: We had the most applicants, the hardest entry assessment ever by a lot. We sat 107 cadets, our most ever before this was 61. We have been running an advanced builder program that's now in its fourth cohort. And we have the second half of a research and development program for ctos and senior engineers in Solana. And we're now diving into the SBM and rust at a level that, you know, we got 20 guys in there. There's probably not 20 guys working together anywhere in the space that are of that caliber. Our innovation lab is busy.
00:19:59.296 - 00:20:31.640, Speaker A: I mentioned Posad and we've shipped tools like lava and validate. And then our dev shop is quite busy. Our research arm is growing. Actually, tomorrow one of our graduates from the research arm is dropping a full report called Solana how it works. And it basically provides end to end with diagrams, explanation for many audiences exactly how Solana works from the time you log into your wallet until you get finality. So keep an eye out for that. It's going to be hosted in a couple different places.
00:20:31.640 - 00:20:44.920, Speaker A: If you check us out at Solana Turbine on Twitter, you will see it drop there. And it's, it really, it's. I'm incredibly proud because it's the product of our first research cohort and it's really pretty spectacular.
00:20:45.900 - 00:20:51.476, Speaker B: I'll be sure to include those links in the description. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks so much for hopping on. Looking forward to having you on in the near future.
00:20:51.588 - 00:20:52.820, Speaker A: Great to see you, my friend. Be well.
