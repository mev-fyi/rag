00:00:00.250 - 00:00:09.374, Speaker A: So I think it's not impossible. We see the price of pike network go ten to 20 times their current price. Five dollars to ten dollars, maybe.
00:00:09.492 - 00:00:17.678, Speaker B: Today we're looking at Pith network and how it's shaping the landscape of decentralized finance. Why is it important?
00:00:17.844 - 00:00:19.742, Speaker C: Why do you need to know about it?
00:00:19.876 - 00:00:22.494, Speaker B: Watch this entire video to get an.
00:00:22.532 - 00:00:25.254, Speaker C: In depth look into the project like.
00:00:25.292 - 00:00:29.526, Speaker B: And subscribe to the channel so that this educational content can get into the.
00:00:29.548 - 00:00:36.578, Speaker C: Hands of more people just like you. First off, what is pith network?
00:00:36.754 - 00:00:50.538, Speaker B: Pith Network is a decentralized oracle. Think of it as the backbone that connects the decentralized and centralized worlds, providing accurate real time price feeds for different assets.
00:00:50.634 - 00:00:59.790, Speaker C: What kind of assets? Assets like crypto, like equities, forex, or commodities.
00:01:00.210 - 00:01:07.266, Speaker B: Now, I know what you're thinking. Don't we already have Chainlink? Yes, Chainlink is the top dog in.
00:01:07.288 - 00:01:10.610, Speaker C: The industry, and clearly it's been doing.
00:01:10.680 - 00:01:14.386, Speaker B: Well over the last month or so, and a lot of that has to.
00:01:14.408 - 00:01:19.410, Speaker C: Do with the narrative around RWAs bringing.
00:01:19.490 - 00:01:23.526, Speaker B: Real world assets on chain. Many in the industry are working on.
00:01:23.548 - 00:01:24.758, Speaker C: That as we speak.
00:01:24.844 - 00:01:56.734, Speaker B: In less than a week, injective introduced the world's first interoperable RWA treasury product and became the first L1 outside of Salana to fully support spo assets. Hugely impactful for the future of RWAs. Yes, I definitely agree with Mirza. Not only is injective working on this, but other chains are as well. And chain link and other oracles will be needed in order to provide real data onto these chains. But before we get into the tokenomics.
00:01:56.782 - 00:02:00.350, Speaker C: Breakdown with Patrick, let's do a quick comparison.
00:02:00.510 - 00:02:21.386, Speaker B: Pith has over 380 price feeds. That's a lot more than chain link. More price feeds means data is sourced from a diverse range of providers, including major players in traditional finance and crypto institutions. This diversity reduces the risk of manipulation or inaccuracies associated with relying on a.
00:02:21.408 - 00:02:35.002, Speaker C: Limited number of sources. Pith also has a speed advantage that's important for folks like high frequency traders that need up to the minute data. Pith integrates with more blockchains.
00:02:35.146 - 00:02:52.914, Speaker B: In fact, they leverage wormhole, which is one of the largest bridges wormhole can bring. Pith price outputs as transactions to EVM chains, aptos, cosmos hub, and more. So they offer a broader scope of compatibility. They also have very innovative tokenomics because.
00:02:52.952 - 00:02:59.206, Speaker A: There'S a lot of linear vesting and some occasional, like, sharp step like this.
00:02:59.388 - 00:03:06.182, Speaker D: But this one is, there's no linear vesting, and it's pure, just staircase every year.
00:03:06.316 - 00:03:12.060, Speaker B: So Patrick sees a staircase unwocking of the tokens. But why is that so important?
00:03:12.590 - 00:03:17.642, Speaker A: In the middle of a staircase, there's not that much more selling pressure because.
00:03:17.696 - 00:03:27.646, Speaker D: There'S no unluck happening. So whoever can sell, it's basically just happening at some point, and then you.
00:03:27.668 - 00:03:29.070, Speaker A: Will have a long period of time.
00:03:29.140 - 00:03:37.054, Speaker D: Where there's not additional sell pressure necessarily. So that means that whatever price movement.
00:03:37.102 - 00:03:43.154, Speaker A: Is happening will happen kind of organically based on supply and demand at that point.
00:03:43.272 - 00:03:49.826, Speaker D: But you won't have a constant amount of new token that is unlocked.
00:03:50.018 - 00:03:52.214, Speaker A: That's much easier to predict from a.
00:03:52.252 - 00:03:57.754, Speaker D: Trader point of view, because if you have a linear vesting, then traders are.
00:03:57.792 - 00:04:00.774, Speaker A: Constantly fighting with some sort of pressure.
00:04:00.822 - 00:04:03.930, Speaker D: Of potential selling on an everyday basis.
00:04:04.270 - 00:04:06.442, Speaker A: So then it become hard for someone.
00:04:06.496 - 00:04:10.134, Speaker D: Who use technical analysis to have retracement.
00:04:10.182 - 00:04:11.882, Speaker A: And decide, okay, this is a price.
00:04:11.936 - 00:04:14.014, Speaker D: Point that I can count on, because.
00:04:14.052 - 00:04:26.846, Speaker A: The thing if you have a constant drip of new token hitting the supply, those chart may be affected a little bit. So in this case, it become a lot more predictable in a sense. So that's the advantage.
00:04:26.958 - 00:04:34.846, Speaker B: So there's not much selling pressure in the middle of the staircase. And for those day traders out there, much easier to predict because you don't.
00:04:34.878 - 00:04:37.734, Speaker C: Have a constant unlock. That's good to know.
00:04:37.852 - 00:04:43.766, Speaker B: But what if I'm still concerned about these unlocking periods at the beginning and the end.
00:04:43.868 - 00:04:45.494, Speaker A: In this case, for example, you see.
00:04:45.532 - 00:04:54.866, Speaker D: Ecosystem growth publisher reward. Those are different category of the unlock. And even though that there's a sharp.
00:04:54.898 - 00:05:06.302, Speaker A: Unlock, let's say at the beginning here, those two category are kind of under the control of the project. So they don't have to necessarily decide to sell everything at the beginning of the unluck itself.
00:05:06.436 - 00:05:08.702, Speaker D: They could decide to spread it over.
00:05:08.756 - 00:05:09.934, Speaker A: A period of time.
00:05:10.052 - 00:05:13.502, Speaker D: And I think the ecosystem growth is.
00:05:13.556 - 00:05:20.146, Speaker A: Representing in this case 52% of the entire supply. So the majority of the token of.
00:05:20.168 - 00:05:22.930, Speaker D: The supply is under the control of the project.
00:05:23.000 - 00:05:25.086, Speaker A: And if they see that they don't.
00:05:25.118 - 00:05:29.046, Speaker D: Find any proposal of new businesses that.
00:05:29.068 - 00:05:38.514, Speaker A: Want to build on the ecosystem and provide value, they don't have to release those tokens at all, even though the unlock is happening. So that doesn't mean they'll hit circulation.
00:05:38.642 - 00:05:41.878, Speaker D: And be part of the supply that is tradable.
00:05:42.054 - 00:05:55.214, Speaker B: Pith would not want to dump on themselves. That makes a lot of sense. And as Patrick mentioned, just because the unlock is happening, doesn't mean those tokens will be released. Here's another reason why Pith would not.
00:05:55.252 - 00:05:57.354, Speaker C: Want to have a large unlock.
00:05:57.482 - 00:06:37.626, Speaker A: If you have a large unlock compared to the trading volume. Like, let's say that in blue, the line is that if you have a small unlock versus your trading volume, let's say the unlock is only 1% of the trading volume. Then before the unlock happened, the price will be potentially going down, but at the same time, it's going to recover relatively quickly. And if you have a large unlock versus the trading volume, let's say your unlock is more than 100% of the daily trading volume, then the decline of price is greater. And at the unlock itself, you may experience some sort of a little bit.
00:06:37.648 - 00:06:39.914, Speaker D: Of a pump, but then it will.
00:06:39.952 - 00:06:52.666, Speaker A: Decrease again and your price basically suffer for longer. So typically you want to avoid the large unlock, but then sometimes it's not really easy to predict this in advance when you don't know what is your trading volume.
00:06:52.858 - 00:06:56.142, Speaker C: Last episode with Patrick, we discussed Celestia.
00:06:56.206 - 00:07:06.258, Speaker B: And the amount of VC funding that they have received. This will ultimately have a large impact on their unwox in the coming years. Highly recommend going back to check out that video.
00:07:06.344 - 00:07:14.530, Speaker C: I'll be sure to include that in the description. But what about pith network? How much did they raise and should we be concerned?
00:07:14.690 - 00:07:25.114, Speaker B: Well, as we can see here, there have been three investors, and it lists these investors, but in terms of the amount, we don't really know exactly how.
00:07:25.152 - 00:07:35.722, Speaker C: Much they have raised. That information is blank. It's a little bit cryptic, which personally, I'm not a fan of, but let's ask Patrick.
00:07:35.786 - 00:07:37.338, Speaker B: Should we be concerned?
00:07:37.514 - 00:07:41.566, Speaker A: What I could find is that there was three undisclosed round of funding in.
00:07:41.588 - 00:07:43.694, Speaker D: The presale, but we don't know how.
00:07:43.732 - 00:07:50.206, Speaker A: Much of the VC got enriched. But regardless, they only own 10% of the total supply.
00:07:50.318 - 00:08:05.190, Speaker B: Regardless of who the VCs are, they only own 10% of the supply, which does not pose as many risks during the unlocking period. This also means that it's okay that there's a large disparity between the market.
00:08:05.260 - 00:08:12.690, Speaker C: Cap and the fully diluted valuation, because ultimately we understand who owns these tokens.
00:08:12.770 - 00:08:15.874, Speaker B: As Patrick mentioned, 52% of the supply.
00:08:15.922 - 00:08:20.014, Speaker C: Belongs to the ecosystem. Now, to be clear, at the time.
00:08:20.092 - 00:08:30.540, Speaker B: Of this video, I am not an investor of pith. Use this information as you wish to make your own decisions like and subscribe to the channel and I'll catch you in the next video.
