00:00:00.170 - 00:00:43.414, Speaker A: Because it's on chain, all the contents are monetizable and they're already tokenized. You can set up rules that's running in our middleware. So you can monetize your, your content by allowing people to mint a copy or collect a copy of your content. Or in other ways. Like you can set up some crowdfunding where you want people to, you want to raise funds directly, or you can create communities around how only these kind of people can subscribe to me. Let's say if you want to create a board Ape Yacht club community, you want to set up a profile that only allows people with the board ape to subscribe to you, and you can create exclusive content that only does your subscriber. Those ape holders can view those content.
00:00:43.414 - 00:00:53.050, Speaker A: It really enables on chain programmability and monetization through this also shared database that's being used by different applications.
