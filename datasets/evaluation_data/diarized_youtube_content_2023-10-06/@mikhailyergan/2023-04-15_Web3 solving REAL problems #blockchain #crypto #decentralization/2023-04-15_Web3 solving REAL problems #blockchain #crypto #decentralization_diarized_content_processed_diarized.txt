00:00:00.250 - 00:00:43.010, Speaker A: I think the problem web two is the identity system. The identity is fragmented, which means user will have like multiple identities, including your Google account and Twitter account. They're not connected. Basically, you can never use one identity to use all applications in web two. But with web3, it's possible now because with Web three, like everything's on chain and your identity is decentralized and there is no way for others to prevent you using identity to use another application as long as you hold a private key, right? This makes this kind of web3 identity. A universal identity layer becomes possible in web3 by taking advantage of this universal identity layer. This is possible, but return the core nature of decentralization universal identity layer.
