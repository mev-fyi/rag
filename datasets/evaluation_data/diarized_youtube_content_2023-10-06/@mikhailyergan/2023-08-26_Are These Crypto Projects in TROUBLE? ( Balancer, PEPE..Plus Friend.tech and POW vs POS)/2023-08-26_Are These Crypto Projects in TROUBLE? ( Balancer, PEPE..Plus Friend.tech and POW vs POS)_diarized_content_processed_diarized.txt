00:00:00.090 - 00:00:22.254, Speaker A: I know you've been pretty busy with work related stuff, but have you been keeping up with the market overall? I feel like it's been kind of not going to say boring, but yes, the way the market conditions are, they're not necessarily because it's not volatile. There's really not much happening right now.
00:00:22.372 - 00:00:54.240, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. There isn't going to be much that moves the market, I guess, for a while, until a killer use case comes out for blockchain or until governments start to bring investor money in. I think if all of those ETFs get approved, I think that's going to be huge. But even then, I don't even know because there's been so much talk about already that maybe the price is baked in. No idea.
00:00:55.570 - 00:01:25.238, Speaker A: I think there are a few things, like on the tech side that are happening that seem to be pretty cool, which I haven't really been paying too much attention. So somebody told me about friend tech, and that seems to be the hottest app right now. Everyone is talking about it and how everyone is making money off of it. Are you on it or have you checked it out?
00:01:25.404 - 00:02:42.734, Speaker B: I checked it out, I looked at it and basically you create shares of yourself that you can sell, right. And then the shares, basically, I think there's some type of limit to how much speculation the shares can pop in price. So I think you can max out, I think, three e or two ETH per share or something like that. Honestly, I don't care. It doesn't seem like there's anything really good for the world that comes out of this significantly good for the world, I guess. I think it's cool to speculate on a person's personality, but I think what I like is if somehow buying a share of a person, you share in their success in some way, and that doesn't seem to be the case right now. Literally, what you're doing, if you're trying to make money off buying shares of someone is, you're trying to ask yourself, is some other person going to buy those shares at a higher price? Right.
00:02:42.734 - 00:03:12.460, Speaker B: And that's, to me, way too indirect of a way. That is the definition of speculation in mind. Right. It'd be cool if I could buy shares of some famous, let's say, actor or something, and then the proceeds of his career go to me, right. I have some type of dividend from how good he's doing, right? That would be cool, right. Then I could see myself wanting to invest in someone similar to how, I guess.
00:03:15.710 - 00:03:29.454, Speaker A: You'Re actually dividends. You want to be able to reap the benefits of making the right investment versus making an assumption or prediction that in the future, this share is going to be worth more.
00:03:29.652 - 00:03:44.500, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, exactly. I don't want it to be just straight speculation. I want it to actually be directly tied to the success or failure of the property of person I'm buying. Right.
00:03:46.810 - 00:04:04.780, Speaker A: How difficult do you think? I don't know the answer to this, but how difficult do you think it is to, from a financial standpoint, establish that? Like, if friend tech wanted to say, okay, if this is what our users want, we can certainly do that.
00:04:05.230 - 00:04:38.390, Speaker B: Super easy. I think it's already been done to a degree. Right. In a way, I think instead of buying shares of the person, you would just buy shares of some effort that the person is putting out. Like music, for example. Right. Someone could put out a song, and maybe the owners of the song could get some revenue from the amount of plays it gets or the quote unquote album sales, or how much streaming it's gotten.
00:04:38.390 - 00:05:18.062, Speaker B: I think that already is out there, and I think that that's intriguing to be able to be a part owner of a project, and they could simply do that with a person. Right. I mean, it's weird to do that with a person because just a person. Because then it's like, what defines my success or failure, right? Like, if I'm a good father, does that somehow benefit you guys? Right. So it would have to be something that I do that generates revenue. Maybe I sell a painting or I do my job. Maybe people get proceeds of my salary.
00:05:18.062 - 00:05:27.506, Speaker B: Can you imagine that? Kind of, like, however high up I get, people get more money based on my success in my career.
00:05:27.698 - 00:05:39.206, Speaker A: I just think it's weird that you use the father example. You're a dad. You send your kid up to his room and your kid goes, dad, you know what? I'm selling my shares.
00:05:39.318 - 00:06:01.760, Speaker B: Yeah. By doing that, everyone dumps your shares. Right? Because your bad fatherhood makes your bad reputation. Like, nobody wants to support you anymore. Right? So then your shares dump. So now I've got a financial incentive to be a good human being.
00:06:02.530 - 00:06:08.386, Speaker A: I don't know, it gives it a little bit of a black mirror vibe. A little bit.
00:06:08.488 - 00:06:26.520, Speaker B: Yeah. I think there was an episode of Black Mirror where it was like that you could socially judge people, and based on your rate, you got benefits. If you had five stars, you got better rental rates, and you could be part of certain communities and stuff.
00:06:27.550 - 00:06:56.420, Speaker A: Do you think that there are social implications of an app like this? This is what I'm thinking about. Because the success of it, whether this stays or not. I feel like we've already established that this is something that people gravitate towards, and so are we going to start? Does this promote judgment? Are we judging people more now?
00:07:02.230 - 00:07:41.440, Speaker B: Oh, man, my shares are worth one ETH, and your shares are worth no ETH. Your shares are worth two gwe or something. But it hasn't gotten to that point yet. But I think it could. For example, imagine some famous seedless celebrity went on friend tech and just nobody bought into them. It would be a joke, right? People would be like, oh, ha ha. That person that bench warmer on the lakers couldn't sell a single share, right? So I could see that happening if it blew up.
00:07:41.440 - 00:07:50.370, Speaker B: Yeah, people already do it with Twitter followers and stuff. People already say, like, oh, man, I got 15 mil. What, are you not even at one millia?
00:07:51.910 - 00:08:09.690, Speaker A: But do you think when you add, and this isn't fiat money, of course, but when you're adding a certain level of currency, does that intensify it, or do you think that likes and followers, that's also a form of currency.
00:08:10.510 - 00:08:16.060, Speaker B: It's all the same. It's basically a metric to rate how cool you are.
00:08:17.390 - 00:08:58.946, Speaker A: So the next question becomes, does the government need to get involved in something like this to ban it? Are we coming in and saying, hey, this is not really good for society and we're banning it? Or do we create nonprofit organizations that are for mental health and saying, hey, we should not be having these types of projects, or, I don't know, are there going to be serious implications from this? Or are we already kind of numb to this type of feeling because we have the Twitter followers and the likes?
00:08:59.058 - 00:09:45.030, Speaker B: I gravitate towards freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and people have always said, I'm super mean and too hardlined on it. I don't agree with censoring social media and whatnot. That's a very controversial position to take, especially because of things that have happened lately with the Capitol building, the Capitol riot, and all that. Right? But I really think that people need to take some responsibility to manage their life. Okay. If you don't want to be part of this rat race, then just don't. Don't let this type of stuff, like your number of followers define your depression.
00:09:45.030 - 00:10:18.980, Speaker B: And if you can't do that while being on Twitter, then don't be on Twitter. Use a ghost account, and just separate yourself from that. If you still want to read Twitter and you don't want to be judged by. So, no, I don't think the government should jump in. I think it should be a thing that parents can do to stop their kids from using it if they think their kids can't handle it. And when you're an adult, be a grown ass man and be responsible for your mental health.
00:10:19.750 - 00:11:05.806, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree to what you said. I think every household, parents, mom, dads, they're the ones that should be responsible for instilling the values and educating their children about everything in moderation, so to speak. But it is something to be mindful of because kids don't necessarily have the self awareness. So if this becomes very accessible for kids to utilize, which I don't know what that onboarding process is like. I don't know how user friendly it is. I think I saw an article somewhere that they need to work on there, like ux a little bit, but obviously it's not stopping a lot of people. I think it was.
00:11:05.806 - 00:11:11.474, Speaker A: What, how many users do they have? I think I read, like, maybe like 60,000 or something, or maybe even more than that.
00:11:11.512 - 00:11:11.954, Speaker B: Now.
00:11:12.072 - 00:12:07.874, Speaker A: It's probably more than that, but, yeah, not necessarily a security conversation, but definitely something that has been pretty top of mind lately. But on the topic of security recently, we saw that balancer, they found an exploit on eight different chains, I believe. And this isn't the first time that Balancer has had issues. I think back in 2020, if I recall, they suffered a hack. And this one, I don't know, it doesn't seem to be as bad because they were able to recover, like, 97% of the funds, but there's still, like, 2.8 million that's at risk since last I read. What do you make of what's happening with balancer?
00:12:08.002 - 00:12:46.686, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, it was a good news story. Totally. So really what happened was a white hat disclosed a vulnerability, a very serious vulnerability, inside of certain balancer based liquidity pools. Balancer did not tell anyone about it and just secretly worked to notify people that there was a problem. So they built kind of a website. You could put in your address or something, and they could tell you if you're vulnerable. Right.
00:12:46.686 - 00:13:15.580, Speaker B: You could put in your information. They could be like, oh, yeah, you're vulnerable. You better withdraw all your liquidity out of this pool. So they list it out like, here's these pools that are vulnerable. Get out of there as soon as possible. And they also tried to freeze the activity on a few of these pools because certain of them had these provisions where you could do, like, a multistick vote, and then they could have the power to freeze and only allow withdrawals. In the case of an emergency, which is what they called this.
00:13:15.580 - 00:13:44.900, Speaker B: And so, yeah, there's still some stuff vulnerable, meaning certain people didn't pull their money out of their pools yet. Right. And the reason that they couldn't get even more people to pull the money out of their pools probably is because they don't know how to notify all these victims. They can't just send them an email because they don't have the emails of all these victims. Right. With just a wallet address. So they just made the announcement and they're just giving them time.
00:13:44.900 - 00:14:15.978, Speaker B: I actually think that the balancer story is a really good news story for security because the way the whole thing was handled seems really sensible and responsible. Right, like you had a white hat hacker. That's a good thing. Somebody could have stolen all this money and instead went and told Balancer nicely. Hopefully Balancer gave him or her a huge bounty. Right, probably so. And then Balancer went and said, all right, let's just keep it a secret.
00:14:15.978 - 00:15:07.120, Speaker B: We're not going to go and just blast out this info because we don't want to get hacked. Let's give everybody time to be safe and let's just announce it on Twitter as clearly as we can. Create a really convenient user interface for people to just check if they're vulnerable, remove their money if they need, and once everybody has done all that and all the funds are safe, we'll release the details of the vulnerabilities to educate the community. I think that's super cool. And they didn't hide it. They didn't worry about them having egg on their face or having a vault and just secretly sweep it under the rug. In my mind, this is the way security white hat hacking and bug divulging, responsible bug disclosure should be done.
00:15:08.850 - 00:15:22.610, Speaker A: Okay, maybe I misread this, but in one of the articles, it talked about how this exposes the security risk of layer two chains. Is there anything that makes sense out of that statement?
00:15:25.910 - 00:16:28.940, Speaker B: Full disclosure? I haven't checked for updates today for the day of recording, so I don't know if they already released the vulnerability details, but I think as far as I can tell, when I checked last, which was yesterday, they had it. I don't know if they could even say that yet. Maybe all of the vulnerable pools were on L two chains, but I didn't check carefully. And also, even if they were, I think it's premature to say that it's an L two chain problem. If you don't know what the vulnerability was, you don't know, if it was just that they copy pasted a vulnerability when they launched those things in l two chains, or if it was like something specific to the l two chain architecture, and I don't think it was. So if that article is out there, unless they know stuff I don't know, I would be heavily skeptical to agree with.
00:16:30.750 - 00:17:14.710, Speaker A: I could also perhaps, maybe misread it. But I'll have to come back to you cool on that topic. So the other thing that I read today is there's a chain, I think it's called, let me tell you the name of it. There is a chain that I think they converted to being a proof of work chain, and they did it specifically for security reasons. So that kind of begs the question, are proof of work chains naturally just more secure than proof of stake chains?
00:17:15.930 - 00:18:03.846, Speaker B: I would say there is an argument of yes, I only say that, you know what? Yeah, I would say, like, I would argue no, you can't definitively say that yet. But if you had to choose one or the other, proof of work has been used for longer than proof of stake. However, proof of. So I think when proof of stake. When Ethereum moved over to proof of stake, there was a lot of clamor about that. But they've been on proof of stake for a little while now, and so far, no issues. But one year's worth of data is a lot less than ten years worth of data.
00:18:03.846 - 00:19:00.060, Speaker B: So I would say proof of work is, in my opinion, a little bit simpler to understand conceptually. And there is more of a clear cut, selfish incentive to behave, quote unquote. So if I had to choose one, I would choose proof of work. That being said, there has been no holes that someone has poked into proof of stake, and we haven't seen any real world incidents that attack the proof of stake. What do I want to call that, the proof of stake mechanism in any significant way other than finding a couple of bugs in the implementation? There hasn't been any issue with the general algorithm of it.
00:19:01.150 - 00:19:20.640, Speaker A: Yeah, because at first I thought maybe perhaps it is happening on the smart contract level. And so proof of work chains up to this point, I thought, don't have smart contracts, but technically bitcoin now does, right? With BRC Twenty s and.
00:19:23.490 - 00:19:29.246, Speaker B: Using proof of work, Ethereum smart contracts, and they were proof of work all the way.
00:19:29.268 - 00:20:10.378, Speaker A: Up until like a year ago, right? You got a good point there. Yeah. Interesting. Okay, so the other thing that I caught on the news was this whole pepe situation, which is kind of security related, but more of risk I saw that the developers of Pepe were secretly selling their tokens. I don't know if you caught glimpse of that, but now it's creating a lot of panic within the community. And that's why Pepe is down so much. Because I bring up Pepe, not because I think that from a technical standpoint, meme tokens should carry a lot of weight in discussions.
00:20:10.378 - 00:21:04.580, Speaker A: But I think there are certain tokens that we as the community pull together and say we're really excited about the potential of this specific meme token, quote unquote, making it, because at that point, they'll have enough money to maybe continue their development, like what Shiba Inu is doing with developing a game. And so I think that in some ways, people such as myself think that it would be great to change the narrative of meme tokens. And so a lot of people were looking at Pepe as one of those tokens that could potentially develop into a Shiba Inu and potentially continue its development. But I don't know if that's going to be the case with this recent news. So we shall see.
00:21:05.670 - 00:21:48.590, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's just one of a million examples of just how popularity doesn't equate to due diligence. People get behind something, and I think the mistake that some people make is like, oh, if everybody else is getting behind this, they must have done their due diligence. And so I'm going to get behind this too, because it's safe. Otherwise, could 100,000 people be wrong? Or like 100 million people be wrong? And the answer is yes, they can. So buyer beware. Definitely in crypto. Buyer beware.
00:21:49.090 - 00:22:09.590, Speaker A: Absolutely. Daniel, always a pleasure. Thanks so much for your insight. Last time we connected, I think it was around multichain. And to this day, I want to say that's probably my most popular video. So I contribute that to you and all the amazing knowledge that you bring to the channel. So certainly appreciate anytime you come on.
00:22:09.590 - 00:22:13.560, Speaker A: I know your time is very limited, so certainly appreciate that.
00:22:13.930 - 00:22:20.280, Speaker B: Well, thanks. I will be happy to be judged by the best performing video and not my worst. So cool.
00:22:20.810 - 00:22:26.630, Speaker A: Absolutely. And if people want to connect and ask questions, where can they find you?
00:22:26.780 - 00:22:34.910, Speaker B: You can dm me on Twitter. My handle is gen one one two. Jenster one one two. Always open to chat.
00:22:35.330 - 00:22:38.990, Speaker A: Great. I'll make sure to include that in the description. I appreciate your time.
00:22:39.140 - 00:22:41.930, Speaker B: Cool, thank you. Talk to you next time. Bye.
