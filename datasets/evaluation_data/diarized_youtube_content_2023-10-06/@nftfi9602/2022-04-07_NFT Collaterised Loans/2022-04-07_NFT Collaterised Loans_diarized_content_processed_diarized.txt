00:00:00.250 - 00:01:13.550, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the Niftyfi Twitter spaces. We do them approximately once a week, and we cover different topics. For those of you who don't know, what is niftify? It's a marketplace, peer to peer marketplace, where you can get a crypto loan against your nfts or offer loans to others against their nfts. So we've been around, and today we really wanted to talk about NFT lateralized loans in general and about our platform in particular, which is why we invited two guests who are our power users and very active members of our community, as well as Stephen, the co founder and CEO, is here as well. So what we'll do in the beginning is we'll just have a casual conversation between three of them, just covering several topics, going over the experiences so far. So, Stephen, I'm giving the floor to you. Let's roll.
00:01:13.710 - 00:01:14.466, Speaker B: Cool.
00:01:14.648 - 00:01:44.240, Speaker C: Thanks for the intro, Annie. Yeah. So, like Annie said, we do NFT collateralized loans. So what that means is you can use your NFT to get collateral as collateral for a loan to then do other stuff with. So to get a little bit of idea of what people use us for and how they use the platform, we invited metapunk. He's one of our bigger borrowers. So, metapunk, you maybe want to do a quick intro and then we take it from there.
00:01:45.810 - 00:02:47.202, Speaker D: An intro? Well, I guess the only intro that really makes sense for this audience is my relationship with NFT Phi, which has been really great. I started borrowing out my nfts, I don't know, maybe two months ago, two and a half months ago. And basically I'd heard about NFT Phi already, maybe five, six months ago. And at the time, I reached out to a few of my friends who were ogs in the space, and I said, you know, what is this? Do you think it's possible? And everybody screamed like, no, never put your assets in some contract, et cetera, et cetera. So there was a lot of security alerts, and I kind of just put it in the back of my mind until the moment arrived where I actually did need liquidity. I was in the process of negotiating a really important purchase, and it was a big one. And I knew I'd have to figure out a way to get that liquidity, and I could either get that money from where I was usually getting it.
00:02:47.202 - 00:03:22.860, Speaker D: So selling Tesla shares into euros and then sending the euros into my exchange and then changing that into eth, and then the eth, I could either do it that way or a new way. And so I went into the discord, the NFT five discord, and chatted a bit and tried to figure out how it all worked and try to get some security, some feeding of security, of safety regarding my asset. And I was told there that no asset had ever been compromised, which was very like. I was just like, wow, that should be the headline of the website.
00:03:24.610 - 00:03:24.926, Speaker B: For.
00:03:24.948 - 00:03:43.442, Speaker D: A person like me, right? That's my largest concern. I'm like, seriously? And I actually insisted. I remember it was with strawberry that I had that convo. And I was like, but nothing ever, not even a tiny NFT, not even a text. It's like nothing. Nobody's ever had an NFT compromised. And I'm like, okay.
00:03:43.442 - 00:04:13.594, Speaker D: So I tried it out with three or four smaller nfts, things that I knew I could pay back immediately, which I did. So I did one week loans. I paid back, I got the nfts back, and I said, okay, this works. And then that deal that I was making was right about to close. We got to the price where I was happy, and so I decided to plunge in and I loaned in. I think the first one I loaned in was my punk, the punk that I'm using right now. And that was a very large loan.
00:04:13.594 - 00:04:41.174, Speaker D: That was a 45 E loan, which is thank you to the lender. I'm very grateful that the lender has that liquidity to share and over 90 days. Hold on. No, actually, I'm wrong. I first loaned in my ape to make that transaction that I needed to make, which I did, and then I got my ape back, and that's when I said, okay, great. I put in a really valuable asset. Everything went fine.
00:04:41.174 - 00:05:09.274, Speaker D: I repaid my loan. It came back. So right now, I'm an NFt five fan. I think it's great for both the borrower mindset, which is mine, but also great for the lender mindset, which is not mine. But I've come to learn about having engaged with different NFt five people on discord. I've understood that lenders have a very different mindset than my own regarding how they invest, and that's been fascinating to learn from them. And for me, it's been a game changer.
00:05:09.274 - 00:05:22.260, Speaker D: It's a place where I get liquidity when I need it, and I need to be careful not to overstretch myself. But that happens in any leveraged system, and that's basically my intro.
00:05:22.950 - 00:05:34.950, Speaker C: Super interesting. Is it normally to kind of purchase new items to flip? Like, what do you normally do with the funds that you free up doing these loans?
00:05:35.770 - 00:06:17.266, Speaker D: Yeah, I actually tried that. Now, last week, where I loaned one of my nfts because I knew something was going to mint and I had the NFT necessary to be able to mint, I would be able to mint many of them and then sell them on secondary. I did do that and it did actually go okay in the sense that I made my money back. I haven't repaid the loan yet, but it's not what I'm going to do. I didn't feel comfortable. I realized that I was putting a lot of my gambler mindset in there and a bit of luck. So really, what I mostly use it for and what I'm going to go back to only using it for, in my case, is in a moment where I suddenly need liquidity.
00:06:17.266 - 00:06:45.920, Speaker D: There it is. I have my nfts up already up for collaterals. I get some offers and they're there. And at any instant, if all of a sudden somebody needs, you know, what nfts are like, somebody will put it something below 10% or 20% the floor price, and it's there and it's not going to be there for long. And I can spot it. Like that happened a few days ago with one of the wolves in wolf game. Somebody either mispriced it or just needed money very fast.
00:06:45.920 - 00:07:13.654, Speaker D: But it was mispriced not in terms of floor, but mispriced in terms of its rarity. So maybe the person didn't know, they didn't understand. I don't know. All I know is that there was an NFT at half the price. So I just accepted one of the loans on one of the NFTs I had collateralized, I had put up as collateral, snagged that wolf. It's mine now. If I want, I can just sell it for double and pay back the loan, or I can keep it and pay back the loan some other way.
00:07:13.654 - 00:07:48.034, Speaker D: But what I'm mostly using it for is immediate liquidity. Like, I need liquidity in five minutes or one day, and the NFT Phi gives that to me. And then I'm lucky enough to have 30 days, 60 days, 90 days to come up with that liquidity again to pay back. So far, I've never reached the end of the term on any of my loans. All of them I've given back, like days before or weeks before, because I finally come up with the liquidity and then I just pay back my loan and I can do it slowly instead of having to do it fast.
00:07:48.232 - 00:08:01.400, Speaker C: Yeah, that's very interesting. It's got an interesting strategy to keep them listed and then collect some offers so that you can accept them when you need it at short notice. How quickly do you typically get offers for the assets that you list?
00:08:02.090 - 00:08:52.278, Speaker D: Yeah, the offers are immediate, like literally within minutes. I also think it's given the nature of the assets that I choose to put up because I realize that a punk or an ape or a beeple, things like that, will have a lot more demand. But usually the offers to start being decent, it does take like a day or two. Like those first offers are lenders stretching their luck a bit. I would even argue that there's some insulting offers, but it's all anonymous and I'm not going to bother going figuring out who these people are. But there are people that go nuts and make offers that are just like senseless. But then in a day or two, there's usually one or two really solid offers and they stick around.
00:08:52.278 - 00:09:09.900, Speaker D: Sometimes they go away and then new offers come in, but there's always offers. And that's the liquidity part. You see, if I put up a piece now, even if I only need the money in like 45 days, I'm pretty sure that in 45 days when I go there, there's still going to be a few offers down there that I can just click on and get immediate with.
00:09:10.590 - 00:09:31.540, Speaker C: Very interesting. Yeah, so Arad's also joined now, and he's kind of more on the lender side. So Arad's been one of our earliest users, and he probably knows the platform about as well as I do by now. So, Arad, do you maybe want to give an intro on how you've got to know the platform and how you use it?
00:09:32.070 - 00:09:36.070, Speaker B: Yeah, hi. Took me a while to get connected here properly.
00:09:37.210 - 00:09:40.040, Speaker C: Twitter space is still not the smoothest thing in the world.
00:09:41.690 - 00:10:22.020, Speaker B: Yeah, my connection is not so good. So you got chopped there, but I'll introduce myself quickly. Yeah, I've been in NFTs for like, more than a year now, and I think I've used niftify. First time borrowing on an autoglyph back when they were, I don't know, maybe four k dollars each. I remember borrowing from my autoglyph thinking like, okay, this is my insurance. If it goes down, if it goes down to zero, then I won't repay the loan in 30 days because price went up like three x in a week or something. So I was like, this is my insurance.
00:10:22.020 - 00:11:18.502, Speaker B: I ended up repaying it. Saw that the platform is super dope, so I borrowed a few more times just to have liquidity to play around. To be ready whenever I see an NFT play or a DeFi play or whatever. I ended up using a lot of liquidity for DeFi launches to provide liquidity at the first week or so when the yield is highest. That's what I used my initial loans for. And yeah, like around six months ago, I didn't really need much liquidity anymore, and I started lending myself, which has been sort of like a hobby combined with an income stream combined with a passion that I have for the space. Anyway, it's been a lot of fun.
00:11:18.502 - 00:11:26.520, Speaker B: I've done, I don't know, a lot of volume and a lot of loans. I love the platform.
00:11:31.790 - 00:11:41.310, Speaker C: When you're making these loans, what's your strategy? Are you lending to get a yield, or are you hoping for a default? Or does the strategy kind of vary depending on the asset?
00:11:44.130 - 00:12:26.698, Speaker B: Right, so there's two different approaches here, and I'll tell you which one I go with. So you have the approach of treating it like an income stream. All you care about is the yield. Okay, wait. All you care about is the yield. And you tend to make, like, higher value loans with high interest rates. That's your offers, and you hope to make a good amount of income on that.
00:12:26.698 - 00:13:29.082, Speaker B: But you take quite a lot of risk because your interest rate tends to be higher and your loan amounts that you offer tend to be higher. Then you're way more exposed to the floor dropping down and the borrower choosing to default on you because the floor dropped quite a lot. So that's the first approach in my experience. Most of the lenders on Niftyfi right now, that's how they approach things, at least for my experience. My approach is sort of the opposite here, which I think not many people do that as far as I can tell right now, I usually just go for as low value as I can. If some lenders will offer 50% LTV, which is loan to value ratio, like 50% of what the asset is worth right now, then I'll try to push it and I'll try to offer like 20%. 15 depends on the assets.
00:13:29.082 - 00:14:08.730, Speaker B: 25 I'll offer these kinds of amounts and paired with a much lower interest rate because my hope is not to generate a super high income stream. My hope is basically to use liquidity that I don't use anyway. So might as well make some interest. But my main goal is to get distressed assets right. Basically very low risk, betting that the borrower might default on personal account, not because the floor went too low. It's not worth it for him. To repay.
00:14:08.730 - 00:14:15.680, Speaker B: But yeah, basically aiming for low risk but small chance for a big win.
00:14:16.290 - 00:14:25.570, Speaker C: Interesting. How has that been going? And then what do you do with those assets? Do you keep them or are you normally trying to flip them straight away afterwards?
00:14:27.510 - 00:14:35.940, Speaker B: I had two big defaults, I think, that were sort of like big wins. My knife flipped them both right away.
00:14:36.390 - 00:14:37.140, Speaker C: Interesting.
00:14:37.690 - 00:14:39.922, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not trying to take any risk.
00:14:40.066 - 00:15:06.202, Speaker C: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So then what you're saying is it's relatively low effort for you to do this. You're not using that capital anyway. It might be worst case scenario, you make a little bit of money, but in the best case scenario, you know that you're quite sure that even if the person defaults and the price drops, you're still going to be under the kind of floor value of that asset and you can still flip it for a reasonable price and reasonable profit afterwards.
00:15:06.346 - 00:15:44.598, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. And if we're talking about real numbers here, then my eth used to sit and is sitting, most of my liquidity is sitting at ave earning like, I don't know, 0.5% or some shit. I'm pretty prudent. I don't use high risk D five farms with like smart contract risk. So I could either get 0.5% or I could take some of it out and sure earn like 510 15% on loans.
00:15:44.598 - 00:15:49.930, Speaker B: Very low risk. And yeah, maybe some big wins.
00:15:50.350 - 00:16:04.580, Speaker C: That's quite interesting because normally people would think that dabbling in the NFT space is actually more risky than being in just kind of normal defi yield farm situation. But in your experience, you think it's actually the other way around.
00:16:07.030 - 00:16:08.740, Speaker B: Sorry, what do you mean?
00:16:10.630 - 00:16:28.774, Speaker C: I think normally people would have thought that lending out your ether against an NFT is more risky than just putting it in a green strategy or something. But you saying that if you kind of structure your loans, right, it's actually less risky than putting in those.
00:16:28.892 - 00:16:56.334, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah. If you know the market, if you have a good feel for the market and you don't go over your head with your offers, and you should be okay with most of lenders making better offers than you, most of the time you got to distinguish yourself with low rates. But yeah, if you know the market, it's very low risk. Like very low risk. And I'm not worried. The risk is low.
00:16:56.334 - 00:17:06.760, Speaker B: And on a smart contract level, as metapunk said, I definitely have my trust in the platform that's been running for a year and a half already.
00:17:09.050 - 00:17:21.900, Speaker C: Very interesting. And then, so how do you value these assets? Is it like any assets, do you specialize in some? What advice would you give to people who are thinking to start loaning on the platform?
00:17:26.190 - 00:18:13.558, Speaker B: I think most people want real data to tell them what's the real value, how likely is it to go down. But what I usually use is just my intuition from time the markets. I just take a look at the last sales price on Opensea. When was it, what amount? And yeah, just make my decision there with my familiarity on the asset. So that means, for example, with my approach, I don't do loans on collections that I'm not familiar with. I don't know the history of, I don't know the team behind them, et cetera. I don't want to make a prediction on their trajectory.
00:18:13.654 - 00:18:14.314, Speaker D: Not at all.
00:18:14.352 - 00:18:36.080, Speaker B: Like, even if it's a low risk, for example, world of women, cool cats. For a while, I wasn't comfortable with. Yeah, there's a few high volume collections that I just don't touch because I don't feel high confidence in my ability to actually go low risk and predict this stuff.
00:18:36.610 - 00:18:53.430, Speaker C: Yeah, that's quite interesting because what you're saying there is, it's not just the project, it's also your kind of skill set. And you need to be very self aware to know kind of where you've got the right feeling for what the market is like.
00:18:53.500 - 00:19:11.450, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. And I mean, there are very successful lenders, I think, that have the opposite approach. They just shoot and shoot. They look at the floor and they make offers constantly. I'm not sure how it goes for them, to be honest. I would be interested to find out.
00:19:11.600 - 00:19:35.640, Speaker C: Well, I get if you're making enough loans, then the kind of law of averages kind of comes into your favor. Right. So if you're only doing one or two loans and you're using your full liquidity on them, you could end up in a difficult position. But if you're doing 20 5100 loans spread out over a couple of months or so, then the risk of all of them defaulting is probably quite low.
00:19:37.770 - 00:20:07.358, Speaker B: I think not very much so, because when the market goes down, it drags everything down. That's true. So, yeah, kind of like cdbs and the housing market, like, oh, you have so many mortgages. What are the ods that all of them default, but when they default, they all default at the same time. So I guess we sort of saw that in the last two months where I think default rates shot up like three times or something like that.
00:20:07.524 - 00:20:48.630, Speaker C: Yeah, that's typically what we see. So we see when the market's going up, default rates are basically zero and everybody is super happy. But when the market turns or on the other side, if ether prices suddenly run up super fast and the NFT prices don't keep up with it, then we also see higher defaults and you can actually see a difference in the default rate in the Dai market compared to the ETH market because Dai is more stable and it doesn't move up and down. So default rates are significantly lower if you're doing Dai based loans. Cool. Awesome. This was a really great conversation.
00:20:48.630 - 00:20:55.760, Speaker C: Thanks Arad and metapunk for your insights. Maybe we do this again sometime. It's been a lot of fun.
00:20:56.130 - 00:20:57.326, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:20:57.508 - 00:21:28.418, Speaker A: Definitely. Thank you everyone who have been around and listening. Thanks for those who spoke and yeah, we'll meet you next time. Next week we will have another Twitch spaces scheduled on the 22nd. I'll provide more information about that. So follow us on Twitter and join discord to make sure you don't miss the next one. And yeah, thank you very much and have a nice evening, afternoon, morning, whatever you've got over there in the metaverse.
00:21:28.418 - 00:21:29.478, Speaker A: Take care everyone.
00:21:29.564 - 00:21:31.490, Speaker C: Bye bye everyone. Thanks. Cheers.
