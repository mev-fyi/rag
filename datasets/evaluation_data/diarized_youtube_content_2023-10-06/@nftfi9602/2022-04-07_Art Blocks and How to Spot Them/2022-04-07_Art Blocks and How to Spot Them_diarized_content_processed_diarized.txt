00:00:00.250 - 00:00:49.354, Speaker A: Thanks everybody, for joining us. This is an official niftify Twitter spaces. I am the strawberry Sith, and we're here with Vodr, aka syllogism, who runs creative and design for Niftify. And today we're going to talk about Artblocks a little bit. Artblocks is, aside from being a very recognizable, very well known, and very popular nifty project in the community in general, has also been doing extremely well in terms of loan volume on Niftify.com. And voter, if I'm not mistaken, he will take it away in just a second. But he's been getting really deep into artblocks in general, and if I dare say, has probably been doing very well there, much better than myself.
00:00:49.354 - 00:01:02.880, Speaker A: Anyway, if we're speaking in relative terms. And yeah, voter, why don't you tell us a little bit first about yourself for everybody that's listening in here for the first time, then tell us a little bit about your connection to artblocks and how you got into it.
00:01:03.750 - 00:01:21.862, Speaker B: Okay, well, I am a designer. I studied industrial design, and then I kind of worked in the States as an industrial designer. But I realized that I would have to pivot to something a little bit more digital if I wanted more flexibility in where I wanted to work.
00:01:21.996 - 00:01:27.550, Speaker A: Wait, just out of curiosity, what does an industrial design include for the uninitiated, myself included.
00:01:27.730 - 00:02:18.620, Speaker B: Right. So if you're an industrial designer, you design things essentially for mass production. So something that gets made using mass production, things like injection cereal box, that's more packaging design, but like a Dell computer case or a car or a toaster or anything that gets made in a factory with injection molding machines. So you have to know all the manufacturing techniques and how to use 3d CAD software, and then you sort of build. So I worked in Austin for a design consultancy, and we did a lot of stuff for Dell, like server cases and air purification units, and basically anything that gets made, cell phone, a car.
00:02:20.830 - 00:02:22.650, Speaker A: Got it. So if it's got a mold.
00:02:23.550 - 00:03:19.114, Speaker B: Yeah, not even. It's quite a wide field. There's loads of different manufacturing techniques as well. So, yeah, anyway, that's kind of industrial design. But I pivoted back into digital design, which I had done previously and then worked in sort of the tech finance space for a long time, actually worked with Stephen, and then he asked me to join Niftyfire at the beginning of the year. I've actually also, but purely for my own fun, used to make what was not really generative art, but digital art. I have a big background in flash I used to be a coder in action script, and a lot of that is making the kind of stuff that you see as generative art.
00:03:19.114 - 00:04:32.622, Speaker B: Now, we didn't really have a name for it and was mostly just for fun. Anyway, that's my background. What I like about art blocks is, firstly, I think the process is very clever. In the process of minting the transaction, I'm not going to give you a highly technical explanation because I don't know the highly technical. This is kind of my understanding of it is basically when your transaction gets processed, you get returned a hash, which is basically a bunch of random characters, but those characters are basically numbers, or it can be used as numbers for you to then in your code, use that hash to inform what your artwork is going to look like, right. So it's basically a seed. And that seed, you can then say, okay, well, the first part of the seed is going to inform this part of my code, like the color scheme, and the next part is going to inform the line width.
00:04:32.622 - 00:05:31.894, Speaker B: And the next part is going to inform, well, whatever your generative artworks features are, can then be informed by that. And then you can also set inside of your own code. Like, how often do you think this feature would occur or not occur? And it all goes onto the blockchain. So it has to be super small. I think that has to be under 18, I'm correct, which isn't that much code. Fortunately, they do allow you to use, I think, three js as an external library and P five js as an external library, which if you had to do everything from scratch, would be quite, I think, quite challenging. But yeah, so I got into Artblocks in a big way, really, because I started working for niftify and I'm the product manager there.
00:05:31.894 - 00:06:23.334, Speaker B: So I wanted to have a better understanding of what our customers were doing. And so I thought, well, let me start buying digital art. And I was lucky enough to sort of buy some pieces that at that time were quite undervalued and shot up in value. I got a subscape, which was a very sort of lucky find for me. And then I used what I made from selling that to sort of buy some more art. And that's when I was really just fooling around with it, just sort of buying and selling stuff. And then I got lucky with this piece and I was like, wow, actually, you can actually do quite well out of this stuff if you happen to buy the right piece.
00:06:23.334 - 00:07:36.638, Speaker B: And then I started taking it a little bit more seriously for people who don't know actually, in artblocks there's three different, I don't know, categories, I suppose you could say. There's Artblocks factory, there's Artblocks playground, and there's Artblocks curated. So curated is the most generally difficult to participate in. And I think obviously it's curated by the people at art blocks. So maybe they give a lot of input and they have a selection committee. I'm not sure what their process is, but it's definitely the most difficult and generally the most highly regarded playground, on the other hand, is for people who've already released on art blocks through curated and they want to do another show or another piece, but maybe not with the same degree of oversight as curated would entail. And then factory is much easier to distribute and sell on.
00:07:36.638 - 00:09:08.650, Speaker B: But you also get a wider range of, you get very good pieces released on factory and you also get some stuff that's not that good. So in terms of what I did to try and keep on top of the scene, I suppose is I found artists that I liked and then look at artists that they like. Follow them on Twitter, see who they're interacting with, see who other people they reference. Find out if those people are doing generate for art projects. Another way I think is there's a lot of people on different discord servers talking about projects that are interesting to them and stuff. So that's a very good way to also get a feeling not only for different projects, but how much enthusiasm there is around certain projects and people. Because often with art blocks, when they release a new artist, or they'll announce a couple of days before, or maybe a week or two before an artist is going to release something, they have a discord server and you can go there into upcoming projects and you'll see upcoming releases and often that'll be just one picture of the Genesis Mint, essentially.
00:09:08.650 - 00:09:43.430, Speaker B: And sometimes those mints aren't that nice. I actually miss out on a great drop because I looked at the initial mint, I think it was called Theopolis or something, just kind of these 3d buildings, and I decided not to participate in the minting. And then it really took off because actually the pieces were beautiful and the one that they had as their first piece was just, in my mind, really uninspiring.
00:09:45.450 - 00:10:24.820, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to ask you this first of all, because we jumped ahead a little bit, but of all the nifty products, sorry, but I was just going to set you up to get there, but it's good. Okay, my question is, of all the nifty projects, right? If you're fairly new to them. What stuck out at you about Artblocks, aside from the sale and loan volume between Opensea and Niftify? But was it the design or did you connect with something specific about it? Was the generative part about it interesting to you? What drew you specifically to that?
00:10:25.370 - 00:11:40.682, Speaker B: It was definitely the quality of the work that they were releasing, that you can tell that the stable of work coming out of curated is just generally of a very high quality. So they're obviously very well connected in the generative art scene. They're working with people who are well known throughout that community, and I think they're the premium brand, really, for generative art at the moment. So they obviously have that cachet. Honestly, what I liked about certain pieces, and I don't like all of the things that get released there, but what I like is, is it a strong piece visually? Is it something that you could imagine you would see in an art book and you don't think that would feel out of place? Like if you looked at a Fidenza or a subscapes or archetype, those are all visually very stunning, beautiful pieces of design, and that's really what I found compelling about them and would make me want to own those pieces.
00:11:40.826 - 00:12:02.482, Speaker A: Right. But for somebody that comes from design, who works in visuals and things like that, does it affect you in some way? That part of the art here is not. I mean, it is the visual, but the artist doesn't directly draw the visual, do they, the art?
00:12:02.536 - 00:12:16.662, Speaker B: No, they don't. That's the beauty of it, and it's genius of it. I'm actually working on my own generative art project at the moment, and it's incredibly difficult and a lot of hard work.
00:12:16.716 - 00:12:18.940, Speaker A: You are. Since when is this a new thing?
00:12:19.310 - 00:12:39.246, Speaker B: Oh, no. I've been doing it for the last two months, two, three months already. But I've written off a lot more than I should have because I'm very ambitious. I have a 3d project in mind. So now I have to learn three js, which is quite a challenge for.
00:12:39.268 - 00:12:42.000, Speaker A: Everybody on this Twitter spaces. I like it.
00:12:45.030 - 00:13:14.650, Speaker B: I think being able to generate a bunch of images with the only thing being an input hash and to make sure that those images are all sort of. They belong to the same family. You can recognize one Fidenza over another Fidenza. You wouldn't think that they're two different. You can see that they're part of the same family. But then some of them are visually quite simple. Some of them are incredibly complex.
00:13:14.650 - 00:14:16.846, Speaker B: And to do that well is really, I think that's a huge part of the challenge in making a compelling release of generative art like a series. And that's part of why I think generative art has taken off so much, because it's not that easy to do. In fact, it's incredibly difficult to do something compelling, visually compelling, and make something that 500 of them are being minted, and each of those 500 needs to be interesting and visual and part of the same family. But some of them can be very rare, and some of them can be very plain and what your distribution is of that. So that's why I think doing a good release could really take months and months and months of work, and is.
00:14:16.868 - 00:14:55.130, Speaker A: A good release in a second. I'm going to ask you about what everybody came here to hear, which is how to differentiate between something that looks or appears to be a solid drop that will also perform well afterwards, and what would be less so. But do you feel like a kind of precursor question, that the quality is dependent solely on the nifty itself? Or does it also have to do with other elements outside of it, for example, like the marketing or the reputation of the artist that stands behind it, their community, things of that nature?
00:14:56.270 - 00:15:28.758, Speaker B: Yes. I'd say if an artist has previously released compelling work, then it's more likely that they're going to be releasing high quality stuff. And even if they don't, the fact that they're a well established artist will add some degree of value to the work that a new artist wouldn't have, in my opinion. I also think. Sorry, what was the follow up on that question? Yeah, there's a lot of questions in there.
00:15:28.844 - 00:16:07.890, Speaker A: No, it's all right. I'll sort them out for everybody and I'll ask it in a second to set it up. I'll just share a short anecdote about myself when I look at art blocks. I remember art blocks when it just kind of started, and it was far simpler for me to differentiate between projects for me on a personal level. And FYI to everybody listening in, thanks again for being here. Hashtag, not financial advice, everything you're hearing. But for me, on the personal level, it's very difficult at this point to distinguish between project to project.
00:16:07.890 - 00:16:57.330, Speaker A: I know that some look better to me, and to others, it's subjective, but it's like it's all generative. And there hasn't been anything super innovative, save for a few examples that I've seen. So the two experiences that I've had with artblocks, and I've never tried it again, since the first was dynamic slices, which ended up being pretty okay. I'd say, though, I personally sold it way too early, but nobody knew that it was going to explode and do well. And that was just like generative art. It was like these circles and these slices, and you had a bunch of them. And how is that so different from every single other drop that's done on art blocks? However, the other one was far more recent, and that was beatboxes.
00:16:57.330 - 00:17:40.554, Speaker A: So beatboxes is a project done by zblocks, who have also done unigrids. Unigrids are performing very, very well, I think, if I'm not mistaken. And they did a drop, which I thought on the technical level was a remarkable achievement. They managed to create with Webxr full randomly generated 3d VR runes that you can actually access, like with VR goggles, with an Oculus quest or whatever, directly through the art blocks web page or through Openc. There's just a little VR bottom at the bottom. You click it and it loads directly in your VR goggles. Everything in there is randomly generated.
00:17:40.554 - 00:18:07.590, Speaker A: The size of the room, the lights, the beats, the music. There are certain rarer or more common effects. Like, one of the rare effects is this light ball that bounces around all sorts of cool, nifty stuff like that. And I thought that that was magnificent. Yeah. So I bought into that during the mint. It was extremely expensive, relatively speaking, and it could not be performing worse.
00:18:07.590 - 00:18:29.920, Speaker A: It's a conundrum to me. So the question here is, when you look at projects, drops that are being performed on art blocks, what are some of the things that you take into consideration from an investing standpoint, like things that you want to buy into, not just because they're pretty.
00:18:30.450 - 00:19:18.400, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. So definitely, I would say the visual part is very big consideration for me. The pedigree of the artist, like, have they released something before? How well did that do? Makes a big deal, is a big deal for me. The degree of enthusiasm around it leading up to it is also another factor. And then sometimes, I'll give you an example. One that got released was relatively recently, was this 3d project with a lot of amazing rendering, and it was all written sort of without any code, I mean, without any external libraries, and it sort of does this.
00:19:18.400 - 00:20:06.080, Speaker B: I'm just going to try and remember the name. Let me just quickly pop onto their server and have a look at what it was called. But I wasn't that impressed with it, to be honest with you. And then I think it minted out at eight e, and I didn't participate. Here's one of them. Let me just quickly sculptor, right? I don't know if anyone's familiar with it, but technically it was amazingly competent. I mean, to do what this guy did, like write a 3D Renderer is amazing, but visually, I didn't find it to be that strong.
00:20:06.080 - 00:20:57.998, Speaker B: And it minted out, I think, at about eight. And then I think you can pick them up now for four. So that's just something to be aware of, is sometimes people can get carried away about something and then the project isn't that strong. It's very hard to say why I think something is going to do well or not, but for me, it's almost entirely visual, to be honest with you. If I look at it and I think, wow, I'd like to have that on my wall, then I think that's a good piece. If I look at it and I'm like, well, it's got a bunch of stuff. Like, I looked at beatboxes and I didn't really want to participate in, all because I thought the graphics wasn't very good.
00:20:57.998 - 00:21:53.630, Speaker B: Because to do compelling 3d graphics with that amount of code is really tough. So visually, it's not going to be that strong. In terms of entertainment value, sure. But I don't think those. To me, that is not a compelling enough reason for me to buy into something like that. What I also would just recommend as a strategy for people who want to participate in minting and stuff is it's sometimes good to wait until the minting is done and then pick something up on the secondary market because it's often it'll be very close to what the project minted out at. So let's say the Project mints finish like the floor price for the mint, or the lowest price that the mint goes to is, let's say, two ether.
00:21:53.630 - 00:23:19.050, Speaker B: Then you'll see that there's a bunch of people who are going to try and flip those pieces immediately for like 2.5 ether or whatever. But a lot of those people won't have any idea of whether the piece that they have is good or not. I find with art blocks, rarity and the rarity guide is not the ultimate source of truth. It's really like, is this thing compelling visually or not? And that's something you just have to sort of, if you spend a lot of time looking at artblocks collections and you'll see, okay, well, this one's super expensive and this one is not so expensive, and they're both part of the same collection, then you can almost train yourself visually as to like, okay, well, this is good and this is not good. And why is it not good? Is it like, this one's got a better color palette or it's balanced out more? It's sort of all the things that you would learn if you had a basic education in design and art, like, what makes things visually strong or not strong. And you don't have to understand necessarily on a conscious level why something is good or not, but you can still appreciate it.
00:23:19.050 - 00:24:18.714, Speaker B: You can look at a good piece of design as somebody who's not a strong designer and you can think, wow, I really think this thing I'm looking at is very strong. Like, if you go to a website and it's really well designed, you might not be able to say why it's really well designed because you don't have that understanding of like, oh, there has to be a lot of negative space, there has to be a good amount of space around everything and everything has to be harmonious, except for your accent colors, which you don't want to use too heavily, blah, blah, blah, whatever. None of that stuff is. You're not going to know that theory. And you don't have to know that theory. You can just sort of look at something and it'll be more pleasing to the eye or not more pleasing to the eye. So if you want to know which pieces are going to do better, spend a lot of time looking through collections of previous projects and look at which ones commanded a higher price and which ones didn't.
00:24:18.714 - 00:24:31.700, Speaker B: If you look at, for instance, at Matt's who did subscates latest project, which is called meridian, look at the prices from high to low and.
00:24:35.190 - 00:24:35.794, Speaker C: You'Ll see.
00:24:35.832 - 00:25:14.130, Speaker B: Why the good ones are commanding those high prices. Now, what you could have done with Meridian was like, it minted out at six ether or five even. And then a lot of people put those pieces immediately on sale for 6.5 ether or seven ether, whatever, some people started panicking and put stuff that they didn't think was good for five ether. And actually that's a great opportunity to buy a nice piece because with the minting, you don't know what you're going to get. You just get whatever you get. And a lot of these flippers, they just want to make their 0.5
00:25:14.130 - 00:25:59.070, Speaker B: e or whatever immediately. And they don't actually look at pieces and say, oh, they're visually strong or not. So that's a nice way to get a nice piece post mint that I would recommend as a strategy for people. But it's really hard for me to say what is good is not good. It's ultimately, for me, it's visual. It's like, do I think this piece works? And also, how many of them are there? So look through the entire selection. Even if something looks really good, if there's a ton of them, it's unlikely that that one is going to be one of the more premium pieces in the collection.
00:26:02.870 - 00:26:08.340, Speaker A: Which one of the art blocks that you bought into did best so far?
00:26:09.430 - 00:26:48.846, Speaker B: Definitely subscapes. I bought subscapes right now. It's a very strong project, and I bought, participated in. I really like subscapes, and because of that, I follow Matt. He's got a newsletter, and in his newsletter, he talked about his new drop, and so I knew about it well ahead of time. I have a couple of friends who also buy stuff on discord, and we talk about stuff and whether or not we think it's going to be successful. But I did really well out of that.
00:26:48.846 - 00:27:36.442, Speaker B: And I actually also picked up a crypto just because somebody mentioned it on the server, and I did really well out of that. I know it's not art blocks, but, yeah, I actually think this meridian is a good long term hold. It's also by Matt, and the prices kind of come down a little bit. I'd say it's still on the very expensive side, but I think this is going to be one of those pieces that's going to stand the test of time and become one of the more highly valued collections in the long term.
00:27:36.586 - 00:27:41.600, Speaker A: And why is that? Specifically, the meridians, which I'm also trying to look up now.
00:27:43.990 - 00:28:22.270, Speaker B: So it's very hard for me to say. I just visually, I think it's stunning. It's got beautiful palettes. There's a lot of variation, but most of the variations are good. The artist himself has a good pedigree. He's released subscapes before, which did extremely well. And for me, it's clearly head and shoulders above a lot of the other projects.
00:28:22.270 - 00:28:50.630, Speaker B: I've read through a lot of his articles. He's clearly a very competent coder who's developed his craft to a very high level. And so I think he's going to be a superstar in the digital. Well, I think he already is, but I think owning one of his pieces is going to not be a bad investment over the long term.
00:28:50.970 - 00:29:21.360, Speaker A: Nice, man. I'm looking at them now. Yeah, what do I know? But the meridians weren't not my personal cup of tea. I can see the argument about the other one the subscapes. But I'm saying, like, so many of the art blocks projects are beautiful, right? How do you choose? A lot of it is subjective, but I don't know.
00:29:23.730 - 00:29:26.418, Speaker B: I don't know if so many of them are that beautiful.
00:29:26.584 - 00:29:35.860, Speaker A: I think a lot of them are beautiful. Like, if you go project by project, there's some pretty ones. Again, it's all subjective, right?
00:29:37.350 - 00:30:23.134, Speaker B: It is. I really was very enthusiastic about auto Rad, which was a factory release, and it didn't do that well. So I don't always get it right at all. But also, another one that I thought was really nice was rapture, which also didn't do that well. So it's a bit of a hit and miss, but ultimately, at the end of the day, it's also what you like. It is art. And like I said, I generally tend to buy things that I think I would like to own or would like to see on a wall somewhere.
00:30:23.134 - 00:30:39.530, Speaker B: Or another one I really like is a playground release called Rinskata, which I think is going to do well over the long term. If you look that up, it kind of like.
00:30:39.600 - 00:30:40.540, Speaker A: What was that last.
00:30:42.350 - 00:30:49.260, Speaker B: Rina Skita Rinascita.
00:30:55.380 - 00:30:59.490, Speaker A: Okay, what am I looking for here?
00:31:03.380 - 00:31:12.756, Speaker B: Well, I just like that series. I really like it. I think it's just a beautiful kind of abstract set.
00:31:12.858 - 00:31:21.290, Speaker A: Oh, I see it now by Stefano Pontieri. Right. Yeah, that's pretty nice.
00:31:22.300 - 00:31:53.376, Speaker B: So. And there's. Yeah, so there isn't like a. I mean, if I knew for sure each project that was going to take off, I'd be a multimillionaire, which sadly, I'm not. So I can't tell you necessarily, like, this is for sure going to be a success and this isn't. But a lot of it is visual. A lot of it is.
00:31:53.376 - 00:32:32.590, Speaker B: Has artists done stuff before that you've liked or has done well? And. Yeah, that's what I go on. I don't know. You never know what's going to do well unless it's clearly, like, for me, you don't like Meridian? I think it's beautiful, especially, like, the more expensive, like the. There's very interesting palettes that actually did incredibly well. Like, within a week, I think within two days or three days, one of them had sold for 200 ether already.
00:32:35.280 - 00:32:36.920, Speaker A: Jesus, that's a lot of ether.
00:32:37.000 - 00:32:52.310, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a lot of ether. So if you look at Meridian and you sort by highest lost sold, then you'll see the top pieces and there's really some very visually amazing stuff there.
00:32:57.000 - 00:33:26.530, Speaker A: Good stuff, man. I don't know. It sounds like you have found some sort of x factor way to vibe it out. Of course, it's not an exact science, like you said, but it's interesting to hear your perspective, like negative space, which is something that I would never consider in a million years because it's not the place that I'm coming from or that I'm familiar with, but that you do. So that's really curious and fascinating, I'd say, on how.
00:33:28.340 - 00:34:05.468, Speaker B: My sister is an artist and two of my brother in laws. I have three sisters, but my sister is an artist. Two of my brother in laws are artists. My mom was an artist. So I'm very like, when I go and visit my family, all they talk about is art. And so I'm used to looking at art and appreciating art, and a lot of things that I think would do well as an abstract painting are. I actually love abstract art.
00:34:05.468 - 00:35:09.984, Speaker B: So I've got a big collection of real life abstract art, and a lot of the pieces that you see from art blocks are of a similar caliber. So I think you wouldn't do too badly if you spent a lot of time looking through art history. Get yourself a couple of good coffee table books and look at the work of good abstract artists, and you'll find you've got to train your eye. That's probably the best thing I could say, is, like, it's art, after all. And if you want to speculate on art, you should speculate based on what you think is good art. And a lot of that is your ability to see that, to train yourself how to see good art is by looking at people who are the art masters and looking at their work and trying to understand why they did?
00:35:10.022 - 00:36:15.780, Speaker A: Well, indeed, words of wisdom can't say otherwise. What can give nifties in general, not just art, but also art specifically, more significance than the utility, the financial utility that you can bring with it, right? So it started with nifties in general and just the fact that people find value in them and you can buy and sell them, but now that you can actually leverage them and use them as collateral, it just makes them more significant, more real. Right. And that's why nifties are totally here to stay. But regarding the art specifically. Yeah, I mean, where else would you see that even in the traditional, in real life world, how often is artwork used as collateral? Right? How often would you go take a significant loan in order to do something, like, for your business or for your home or whatnot, and say, I have an artwork that's so significant, I'm going to use that as collateral. It's pretty wild.
00:36:16.760 - 00:37:29.790, Speaker B: Yeah. I have a big collection of actual physical art from relatively well known artists. But selling any of that, like, say, I needed to get $10,000 or whatever, would be really difficult because I would have to go and find a buyer. And it's really hard because at one stage, I was sort of moving apartments, and I have this super big painting, and I was like, well, maybe I should sell it. And it was. It's worth quite a lot of money, but the act of selling it was like a sort of a three month process of just finding a buyer. And I was like, okay, well, I didn't end up selling it in the end, but that, to me, is, I think, a big part of why NFTs as art are so much more are going to do so well, because you can unlock the value either by getting a loan in it or selling it again relatively easily compared to the traditional art market.
00:37:30.480 - 00:37:34.700, Speaker C: Hey, guys, it's Stephen. Can you guys hear me?
00:37:34.850 - 00:37:38.588, Speaker B: Yes, Steven, co founder.
00:37:38.764 - 00:37:40.624, Speaker A: Welcome, man. Have you been here this whole.
00:37:40.742 - 00:37:52.784, Speaker C: Sorry. Thank you. Yes. But my baby was sleeping, so I couldn't talk. But I was listening. I'm standing outside in the rain now. Isn't your baby jumping?
00:37:52.832 - 00:37:55.190, Speaker A: Interested in art blocks? What's going on over there?
00:37:56.600 - 00:38:07.290, Speaker C: Yeah, if I started talking about art blocks right now, my girlfriend would murder me. If I was still inside. I was just going to say.
00:38:09.660 - 00:38:11.130, Speaker A: Now he's gone, too.
00:38:13.100 - 00:38:39.808, Speaker C: Wait, I'm back. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? There we go. I was going to say, I think I agree 100% with everything bota said, but there's just one kind of like a couple of other nuances that you can kind of lie on top of that. So I think it needs to be visually strong anyway. Right. But then some things do outproportionately well compared to others. Right? So some of that is just fashion.
00:38:39.808 - 00:39:34.630, Speaker C: Something becomes kind of trendy, and because it's becoming expensive, everybody wants it doesn't necessarily mean it's significantly better than something else kind of that's done relatively well. So that is something that does happen. And then the other thing especially, he was talking about chromy squigglies. The other thing that matters a lot. If you look back in art history, you'll always learn about the first person who did something. It's not always the best examples of a specific movement, but the fact that they were the person who kind of broke through and was the first one to try a specific technique or think about things in a certain way does have significance, and I think that's why squigglies do really well. It's also why autoglyphs are such an important piece in this whole taxonomy of crypto art.
00:39:39.260 - 00:40:15.570, Speaker A: I was going to say, but, Steven, don't you think? It's not just you, but I'm saying, is there no appreciation for the technical side of the generative art? Because I understand that in the end, it's producing something visual and still art. Right. But I feel like art is everywhere, and that the generative part of art needs to have a little bit of extra weight. So when people do things that are more complicated with the generative art, for me, personally, that's more appealing, even though I think that the majority won't agree with me. But what do you think about that?
00:40:17.480 - 00:41:19.190, Speaker C: Well, I mean, you see this in kind of the traditional art world, too, right? There's certain artists who are famous for being technically extremely proficient and doing very precise techniques, and there's other artists where it's not so much about that. But I do think that, especially in generative art, I really think that the visual thing does outweigh the technical stuff quite a lot, because the technical stuff that has been done in a million other ways and in a million different places, it's not like moving things forward. You're just taking techniques and things that are used in games or websites or something else and then applying them in the art space. And that's kind of how I feel about it on the art blocks level. But I do think that there is. What you're trying to say is.
00:41:21.420 - 00:41:21.784, Speaker B: When.
00:41:21.822 - 00:42:20.356, Speaker C: Does the technology matter in the artwork? Right? Pretty much. Maybe that's, like a way to rephrase it. When we first had movies and film, the first few films, they were basically, they did a play, and they put a camera in the middle front row and filmed a play. And then it took them a while to figure out now that because we've got cameras, we can do panning shots and establishing shots and zoom in and do all of these things. When you watch film history, you'll see those first films where they started doing these things, and they'll be very important if you're trying to study the history of cinema. But that was when the artwork changed because of the medium, or was where the medium was part of the message. And for crypto art, I think the people who kind of represent that the most are, again, autoglyphs.
00:42:20.356 - 00:43:03.160, Speaker C: They were the first smart contract that did generative art. And then I think art blocks as a project was the first to do this idea of having Javascript that actually lives on chain and then you can reproduce the artwork. But then there's other people like, I think Def beef is quite interesting, his artworks that degrade every time they get sold. So he was the first person to do that. And that requires a blockchain and conceptually forms part of the artwork and you couldn't have done it if it wasn't the blockchain. And then I think it matters. The code in the blockchain is part of the artwork.
00:43:05.980 - 00:43:13.740, Speaker A: I dig it. Yeah, steven, or voter. Anything else to add before we wrap up for the evening?
00:43:18.480 - 00:44:38.340, Speaker D: I would say, and this is like keep, don't try and participate in every project, rather try and wait for a project which you think really speaks to you and you think is quite strong and try and get in on that. I do think there's a lot of people who are trying to create generative art right now. It's a bit of a fad at the moment, but I think that the really strong stuff isn't that common and you're seeing that now in the value that some pieces are having that get released. It's not like an amazing project gets released on odblocks every week or even every two weeks. So if you want to hold something for a long time that you think is going to pick up value over the long term, be patient and wait for a good project and try and either get one immediately on the secondary market. Another thing I've noticed, by the way, is often with curated and playground drops, is there'll be a lull a week or a few days after the release, like Meridian minted out at six. Then the floor immediately went in.
00:44:38.340 - 00:45:20.150, Speaker D: Two days it went up to 20 and it stayed there for a while. Now it's back to 15. So it's maybe a good time to get in if you have that kind of money. But when I just got into it after I sold my big piece, I bought a whole lot of stuff and that wasn't actually such a good idea. It's better to just think carefully about what you want to do and don't fomo into something because somebody else just made a lot of money. Because then you get emotional and when you get emotional you are going to make stupid moves and lose money.
