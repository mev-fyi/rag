00:00:00.410 - 00:00:02.538, Speaker A: It this is a quick video explaining.
00:00:02.554 - 00:00:04.750, Speaker B: The loan renegotiation feature.
00:00:05.330 - 00:00:07.406, Speaker C: Either the lender or the borrower could.
00:00:07.428 - 00:00:09.454, Speaker B: Start the renegotiation process.
00:00:09.652 - 00:00:14.266, Speaker C: The renegotiation process could be started from either in escrow or after the loan.
00:00:14.298 - 00:00:17.870, Speaker B: Is expired, but it has to be before the lender forecloses.
00:00:18.450 - 00:00:20.938, Speaker C: In most cases, the borrower will initiate.
00:00:20.954 - 00:00:24.042, Speaker B: The renegotiation, often because they want an extension.
00:00:24.186 - 00:00:25.880, Speaker D: So let's do that.
00:00:27.290 - 00:00:28.994, Speaker A: So even though this is a fresh.
00:00:29.042 - 00:00:31.862, Speaker B: Loan, you could renegotiate at any point.
00:00:31.996 - 00:00:34.146, Speaker C: So I'm going to renegotiate this loan.
00:00:34.178 - 00:00:35.846, Speaker A: And you'll see a similar form to.
00:00:35.868 - 00:00:42.874, Speaker B: Making an offer, except here you can only change the period and the repayment amount. So I asked for a couple more.
00:00:42.912 - 00:00:43.500, Speaker D: Days.
00:00:46.780 - 00:00:47.976, Speaker B: And then you can offer an.
00:00:47.998 - 00:00:51.288, Speaker E: Incentive, basically a fee paid by the.
00:00:51.294 - 00:00:53.676, Speaker C: Borrower to the lender to incentivize the.
00:00:53.698 - 00:01:01.390, Speaker E: Lender to accept the renegotiation offer. And additionally you can specify message.
00:01:14.740 - 00:01:15.104, Speaker A: Once.
00:01:15.142 - 00:01:16.656, Speaker C: You have decided on your terms.
00:01:16.758 - 00:01:18.596, Speaker A: You'll see a quick summary screen to.
00:01:18.618 - 00:01:21.492, Speaker B: Show you the current terms and your new offer terms.
00:01:21.626 - 00:01:23.780, Speaker D: So we send that over to the lender.
00:01:26.280 - 00:01:28.276, Speaker C: So let me switch my wallet here.
00:01:28.298 - 00:01:30.970, Speaker E: To the lender and show you what they will see.
00:01:32.380 - 00:01:35.000, Speaker B: So the lender will obviously get an email.
00:01:35.150 - 00:01:43.076, Speaker A: Then when they come to their asset, they will see this usual escrow panel. But now they also see the simple banner to say you've received a loan.
00:01:43.108 - 00:01:47.484, Speaker B: Negotiation offer and they can view the offer. So when you view the offer, you.
00:01:47.522 - 00:01:49.356, Speaker A: See it again, the summary that shows.
00:01:49.378 - 00:01:52.110, Speaker B: You how you'd like to change the loan and the message.
00:01:52.560 - 00:01:54.832, Speaker A: And at this the lender can actually.
00:01:54.886 - 00:01:57.824, Speaker B: Counter and say fine, if you want.
00:01:57.862 - 00:01:59.872, Speaker E: 35 days, that's all good.
00:02:00.006 - 00:02:03.090, Speaker A: But now the APR must be 20%.
00:02:06.760 - 00:02:08.470, Speaker D: Only if you pay more.
00:02:11.940 - 00:02:14.944, Speaker B: So the APR changed by 10% and.
00:02:14.982 - 00:02:18.364, Speaker A: You want a little bit more weath, but we can have the same repayment.
00:02:18.412 - 00:02:21.730, Speaker D: And the message so I sign this offer.
00:02:24.450 - 00:02:26.286, Speaker A: And what's interesting is even if.
00:02:26.308 - 00:02:28.366, Speaker C: I accepted the borrower's offer as at.
00:02:28.388 - 00:02:30.786, Speaker D: Ease, I would have to sign the.
00:02:30.808 - 00:02:33.390, Speaker E: Message and they would then still have to accept.
00:02:33.550 - 00:02:37.334, Speaker C: Even if I accepted their terms as it was, that's not enough to start.
00:02:37.372 - 00:02:40.006, Speaker D: A new loan that's still going to.
00:02:40.028 - 00:02:41.670, Speaker E: Bounce back to the borrower.
00:02:43.050 - 00:02:45.602, Speaker C: The way our contract works, the lender.
00:02:45.666 - 00:02:49.642, Speaker A: Always signs an offer and the borrower always needs to accept to make any.
00:02:49.696 - 00:02:56.650, Speaker B: Interaction with the contract. I'm going to go back to the borrower.
00:02:58.030 - 00:02:59.978, Speaker A: The borrower will see you've received a.
00:02:59.984 - 00:03:02.766, Speaker C: Loan renegotiation counteroffer and they can see.
00:03:02.788 - 00:03:07.934, Speaker A: The summary and the terms proposed by the lender. They will see the same date but.
00:03:07.972 - 00:03:16.260, Speaker D: With bigger payment amount and the same fee, as well as the message only if you pay more.
00:03:16.710 - 00:03:22.642, Speaker E: This is all a bit of a simplistic example, but I think you get it. The lender is fine with this.
00:03:22.776 - 00:03:26.546, Speaker D: So then he accepts the offer, they.
00:03:26.568 - 00:03:28.194, Speaker A: Can counter again, and it can go.
00:03:28.232 - 00:03:34.626, Speaker B: Backwards and forwards until everyone's happy. The borrower is the only one that.
00:03:34.648 - 00:03:36.994, Speaker A: Can ultimately accept the offer, which will.
00:03:37.032 - 00:03:39.740, Speaker B: Interact with the contract and amend the terms.
00:03:41.390 - 00:03:46.506, Speaker A: So you end up with this final renegotiate loan step except and you see.
00:03:46.528 - 00:03:49.050, Speaker B: The actual contract interaction dialog.
00:04:00.370 - 00:04:03.322, Speaker A: And now we can see the loan terms have changed.
00:04:03.466 - 00:04:05.306, Speaker C: So we are a 35 day term.
00:04:05.338 - 00:04:11.740, Speaker D: Period with 20% APR and that's loan renegotiation and.
