Open the Niftify dap and click on the connect wallet button located in the upper right corner. Currently, we support only the metamask wallet, and we recommend using Niftify on a desktop. Upon doing this, your metamask window will open, select the account you wish to connect and approve the connection. The Nifty Dap will then automatically recognize the contents of your wallet and display them in the get a new loans section.
