00:00:00.810 - 00:00:40.410, Speaker A: The official Twitter spaces coming to you from Niftify. My name is Annie. I'm the CMO here at Niftify. For those of you who don't know, Niftify is a marketplace where people can get crypto loans on their nfts or offer loans to others against their nfts. So if you haven't checked it out, please go and have a look@niftify.com. And join our discord if you have any questions or would like to talk to our community. The link to the discord is in our bio and Robin is here, so I will just invite him over as a speaker.
00:00:40.410 - 00:00:44.140, Speaker A: Hey, hello there. How are you doing?
00:00:45.230 - 00:00:56.960, Speaker B: Hello. I'm good. Sorry, I was just finishing up an editorial meeting with my defiant colleagues and getting on top of what we've got going on at the moment, which is, to be honest with you, a lot.
00:00:59.010 - 00:01:37.018, Speaker A: Yeah, I can imagine just covering what's happening, but just a tiny, small bit of it is already a lot. And yeah, I can imagine. How much stuff do you have as topics and subjects to cover? So, yeah, just everyone. Robin Schmidt is in the house. He's the head of video and multimedia at the defiant. So yeah, I'm a big fan personally. His videos are very good in terms of the right balance between knowledge and entertainment at the same time.
00:01:37.018 - 00:01:43.310, Speaker A: So I'm not even talking about the quality. So, yeah, thanks for doing this. How are you today?
00:01:43.380 - 00:02:47.570, Speaker B: Well, I'm good. Like you said, it's busy, but it's busy in the best possible way. It's been a very busy couple of weeks from all sorts of angles. You spend so much time talking about stuff that feels on the periphery, on a niche, and then suddenly out of the blue, there are these big movements. So, for instance, the working group in the US government talking about stablecoins and moving stablecoins really to the front of the agenda when it comes to thinking about how to regulate crypto. And then, of course, Facebook changing its name to Meta and really foregrounding its strategy towards moving into the metaverse and making something really that gives all of us something to unite against. I don't think any of us really believe that Facebook's intentions are in any way not driven by an ad revenue mean.
00:02:47.570 - 00:04:05.674, Speaker B: I don't want to sort of talk about data and privacy and anything else, but if you look at Facebook, if you search for meta on Google, they come up as an advertising company. They are an ad revenue driven company. And as such, their motivations have to be driven by more clicks, more eyeballs, more engagement more of the things that have kind of created the monster that they are. And so we have this responsibility to talk about a different financial system that's defi, a different kind of version of stocks and shares and that's alt assets and altcoins and this kind of thing. But then we also have governance through dows and then we have metaverses and we have nfts, which are a cultural component as well as a financial component, weirdly, as well, all of those different things, there are subjects and a specialty, all of them themselves. But at the defiant, we have to kind of be open to thinking about all of them. And this space was really designed to kind of think about how we could take an item that is designed to represent culture or represent your participation in a cultural movement or a cultural community and turn it into something that can act as a financial primitive as well.
00:04:05.674 - 00:04:24.160, Speaker B: At the same time. And I think that's what NFTFI has now proven, that it can do so beautifully and that just frankly, jaw dropping autoglyph loan that was delivered. You just blew my mind with that one. Annie, when you told me that, I was like, hang on, a.
00:04:28.370 - 00:04:45.922, Speaker A: Mean. To be. To be honest, it's very hard to grasp it. Right. It's like I was looking at the numbers. I was looking at the image. You understand what's going on and you can understand the whole concept behind it, but it's still unbelievable nevertheless.
00:04:45.922 - 00:05:00.540, Speaker A: Right. So just to give a bit of context to the audience here. So what happened last week was basically we had the record NFT loan, which was the first seven digits loan in the space.
00:05:03.250 - 00:05:05.806, Speaker B: How much was it? Give us the numbers.
00:05:05.988 - 00:05:16.500, Speaker A: It was 1,420,696.9 die. So that was the amount that the Borrower got.
00:05:17.350 - 00:05:26.840, Speaker B: That's insane. That was an NFT upon which the borrower was able to get $1.4 million, basically.
00:05:29.290 - 00:05:56.010, Speaker A: Yeah. It was a special NFT. It was autoglyph number 488. A rare one, but still, yes, it's beautiful. Once I get the time, I will pin the tweet on the top. So you can guys see what we mean and see the image as well of the NFT and the numbers and all the details. But yes, it's one NFT against that NFT.
00:05:56.010 - 00:06:16.902, Speaker A: That's the amount that the borrower. It's, as you said, it's hard to grasp. It's hard to really wrap your mind around it. But it's true. It has happened and I think similar things will be happening. It's always kind of very hard to believe the first one. Right.
00:06:16.902 - 00:06:39.340, Speaker A: So I think this is a proof of basically the whole concept that NFTs are not just JPEGs and NFTs people don't have the choice of either hold it in their wallet or sell it, or flip it and trade it all the time. There are other options and other ways to use the NFDs that you own.
00:06:39.950 - 00:07:31.242, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. That comes back down to one of the kind of principal ideas in this space, and one which we confront the whole time, which is this feeling of being helpless. I think a lot of us felt helpless the last two years because the macro conditions of the entire world were arranged in such a way that we simply couldn't do anything. And for some people, those restrictions are actually liberating. But for a lot of people, they're deeply stifling. And so when you own an NFT, a lot of people invest in them because they think they will go up in value and they will be able to sell them at a later date for more than they pay for them. But whereas in liquid fungible markets, a later date means whenever you decide to sell, and that's on you, with NFTs, that's often not the case.
00:07:31.242 - 00:08:27.534, Speaker B: You have to wait for someone to buy. And so there's this deep feeling of not being in control of your own destiny, of lacking the immediacy of being able to move when you want to move. And so a lot of these experiments around fractionalization of nfts and adding liquidity mechanisms to them have really been about rendering the value in the present tense. So it's not at some point in the future somebody will buy it? No, I can have it right now. And I think in the society that we live in, we're very accustomed to having things on tap all the time, ready at our fingertips when we want them. And so having to wait for someone to buy something and having to just sit tight and not having that liquidity in place, it's kind of awkward. So I have had this conversation with a few people where they said, oh, I really don't want to sell right now, because then I'll have to do this.
00:08:27.534 - 00:09:04.170, Speaker B: I'm like, well, maybe you don't have to sell. You could take a loan. And just the whole idea of indebtedness is quite alien and quite disempowering as well. But I think the longer you spend in Defi and the longer you spend in this space, you understand that borrowing is simply the opposite of lending. It's not a bad thing or a good thing. It's just a strategy. And so if what it offers you is the ability to take advantage of things that you wouldn't otherwise be able to take advantage of, then it's completely valid and you should sort of remove it of any negative associations.
00:09:04.170 - 00:10:12.032, Speaker B: So in that sense, what NFT Phi is allowing us to do is, for instance, if I were to take out a loan on my ape, the first thing I would do is just put it straight into anchor and stick it into a 20% savings protocol and leave it there for as long as I possibly could. But that's just a simple way of extracting some liquidity and extracting some benefits from that. So I'm curious, Annie, what was the process behind that loan? Who underwrote that loan? Because somebody has to take the other side of that deal. I want the money. But then somebody on the other side says, okay, yeah, if this goes bad and we get the autoglyph, we're okay with that. So who was it on the other side of it? So I guess we lost Annie and now it's on me to keep talking. You got a love space.
00:10:12.032 - 00:10:13.572, Speaker B: Annie, you there? You back?
00:10:13.626 - 00:10:24.280, Speaker A: Sorry, I was on mute. I didn't realize that. So hang on. Actually, I want to bring on stage Stephen. Stephen is our co founder and CEO.
00:10:24.620 - 00:10:25.640, Speaker B: Hey, Steven.
00:10:27.420 - 00:10:37.820, Speaker C: Hey, how's it going? Big fan of the Defiant, Robin. I have to just second any sentiment about how good your content is? I'm a big fan.
00:10:38.240 - 00:10:45.250, Speaker B: Thank you very much. Well, we provide a public service, we talk about stuff and then we do stupid accents on top of it.
00:10:48.580 - 00:11:25.070, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah. So you were asking about kind of how that deal came about and who the participants are. Some of the information, obviously, I want to kind of keep private, don't want to leak things that people aren't comfortable with. But I can say that the lender was a dao called metastreet who are essentially looking to become a source of liquidity for exactly this kind of thing across the NFT ecosystem. So kind of a platform neutral liquidity provider for big kind of high ticket loans in the NFT space.
00:11:26.560 - 00:11:53.076, Speaker B: Well, that's just baffling to me. There's a collection of people that say, you know what? We're going to step in and be underwriters of this lending process. And I guess they must have some value that they placed on the autoglyphs. And I don't know if anybody knows, but autoglyphs are the project that followed punks. So there was cryptopunks, 20,000, and then autoglyphs. Don't know how many of them there actually are, but not that many.
00:11:53.178 - 00:11:54.390, Speaker C: 512.
00:11:55.640 - 00:12:29.072, Speaker B: Extremely rare and extremely highly valued because of the lava labs narrative. And I guess you could think of potentially in the future me bits will start to see a similar kind of valuation as people buy into those because they can't afford autographs and they can't afford. So that, that lava labs blue chip prestige could be very valuable for a dow to invest in. But it's amazing that this can all happen trustlessly and permissionlessly as well. This has just kind of come about because entities decided that that's what they wanted to do.
00:12:29.206 - 00:13:28.950, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. And I think they definitely are dows that are collectors primarily, who then have an interest in the underlying assets. But there's also some of these dows are just people who, coming from Wall street, who did this at scale in the kind of real economy and are seeing the opportunity in the NFT space, which is really just massive. I think if you think about cryptocurrencies as Internet native money, I kind of think of NFTs as Internet native property rights, which I think is almost a bigger idea than Internet native money. So it's interesting to see how kind of these people who are kind of at the center of the traditional financial world are seeing what's happening here and starting to kind of become quite serious about doing a big play in these kind of spaces and kind of a similar capacity as which they play in the traditional financial system.
00:13:30.520 - 00:14:07.150, Speaker B: Well, I guess the market is pretty hot right now. NFts are, I mean, they're somewhat under the thumb, but really they're not. If you look at the kind of macro, there could easily come a time because this is the way of crypto, when that isn't the case and people are struggling for liquidity and people are struggling for underwriters, particularly on your side of things. What can you do to kind of keep your market interesting and keep NFTs as collateral? An interesting thing for dows like this to stump up the cash for.
00:14:07.520 - 00:14:39.508, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I mean, a lot of that's actually got to do with the quality of the asset. Really, all we are is kind of infrastructure to facilitate kind of putting these borrowers and lenders together. So everything we do kind of depends on the fact that we need these assets that are credit worthy. Right. If these assets weren't credit worthy and people didn't see long term value in them, they wouldn't lend against them. And autoglyphs are a great example. Their floor prices never really drop.
00:14:39.508 - 00:15:26.680, Speaker C: All you see is the floor price go up and then liquidity dries up for a while and then floor price goes up again, and then nothing sells for a while, and then floor price goes up again. And I think it's all about kind of the quality of the assets that are in the market. But I agree with you that things are, NFTs are like the flavor of the week at the moment, and that I think individual NFT prices might be high, but total NFT market size I think is still very. So I think that there's a difference between kind of short term speculative mania and the promise of a technology going forward in the long run to kind of be foundational to how this whole web three ecosystem functions.
00:15:27.980 - 00:15:44.476, Speaker B: Well, for sure. And there is the flip side to all of this, which is someone in NFTFI got caught out by taking a loan and then forgetting to pay it.
00:15:44.498 - 00:16:22.756, Speaker C: Back, is that, I mean, that was quite a strange whole transaction there because that loan was defaulted on and then immediately taken out another loan on the same asset, which then was default. That's kind of the second default was the one that kind of made it into the news. So either there was some kind of agreement between those people beforehand or the person just literally forgot about this asset and didn't repay it. Because the story there is somebody defaulted on an elevated deconstruction autoglob from art blocks.
00:16:22.788 - 00:16:23.988, Speaker B: Art blocks? Yeah.
00:16:24.094 - 00:16:56.804, Speaker C: The loan was three and a half ether, and I think the floor price on the day of default was 89 ether on that asset. It would have been very easy. Even if that person didn't have three and a half ether lying around, it should have been quite a simple matter for him to find three and a half ether to pay that loan. So there must be something else that happened in that situation. We're not really sure. But on the other hand, the price of that asset could have gone to zero and then the lender would have been stuck with it. Right.
00:16:56.804 - 00:16:59.510, Speaker C: So we see that happen quite a lot, too.
00:17:00.220 - 00:17:33.088, Speaker B: Yeah, I was going to ask you about that because there's no real valuation matrix for nfts right now, apart from the floor price. That's basically all we have to go off. And then we have these headline sales of things. But that's quite a difficult thing to place to create a business on. But I guess from your point of view, you're facilitating and then it's really up to the makers and takers to decide their appetite for the risk at any given moment.
00:17:33.254 - 00:18:14.350, Speaker C: Exactly. So for exactly that reason, NFT pricing is an unsolved problem. And my gut feeling says that it's probably going to stay an unsolved problem again, just because if you think about this core. So right now, nfts are used for collectibles, art, gaming, but really it's just a unique digital thing that you can own. And that can literally be almost anything. So I think it's going to be a very long time until you have some kind of machine learning model that can price any random digital object. I think that's quite a big lift for whoever tries to solve that problem.
00:18:14.350 - 00:19:11.970, Speaker C: Our theory really is that any asset that's worth using as collateral has a community around it who understands the value. And all we really need to do is put people in that community together, kind of match people who have excess capital with people who need some excess capital, who both understand the assets which they're using as collateral. So we kind of sidestep that whole pricing mechanism where in normal defi, you have like a price oracle and you get auto foreclosed if the collateralization ratio kind of goes out of whack. And what we are basically saying is it's an agreement for a specific time period. Both the borrower and the lender take a risk in that agreement. But we don't decide when these things need to be foreclosed. You just agree that you will repay this amount before a specific date.
00:19:13.220 - 00:19:14.450, Speaker B: Well, it's interesting.
00:19:15.060 - 00:19:15.520, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:19:15.590 - 00:19:16.624, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead.
00:19:16.822 - 00:19:41.016, Speaker A: No, since you mentioned the pricing mechanisms and all that stuff, I was just wondering, guys, do you think that it's way harder to do this with nfts because part of the value is emotional and can't really be calculated, and there is something intangible and not very straightforward to calculate and look into. Maybe that's part of the issue. What do you think about that?
00:19:41.038 - 00:20:11.972, Speaker B: Well, it's not that it's intangible, it's that it's non fungible. And that really is the point. You have this distinct uniqueness that is just entirely extrinsic. What do I value this thing as? There are different flavors of NFT. You've got ERC seven, two, one. You've got ERC 1155. And with ERC 1155, for instance, if you have a lost poet and you have a page, you can feed that page.
00:20:11.972 - 00:21:00.576, Speaker B: All pages are the same. It's semifungible. So you're kind of having this conflict between the uniqueness of non fungibility and then this extreme fungibilization of non fungible assets. Because that's the only way that you can really express trading or trading mechanics that allow people to kind of share them and sell them to each other. So that's really fascinating. But I'm sort of pushing against what you said, stephen, because I think when you say we're a long way off from having pricing mechanisms, I think, actually, necessity is the mother of all invention. And I think if you think this is something that we need, obviously people looked at nfts and said, we need liquidity.
00:21:00.576 - 00:22:09.560, Speaker B: And they started to come up with these quite crude mechanisms for building liquidity into them. But there are, even in defi right now, there are more and more interesting approaches being taken to things like, for instance, algorithmic stablecoins or a kind of version of a gold standard, but in crypto, which is Olympus and ohm. And I always find myself thinking, well, can we perform the same kind of thought experiments with nfts? Not to say that we can solve it, but, for instance, is such a thing as a stable nft a possibility? And so you start to think about, okay, well, what would that look like? And why we would even need it is a different thing. But if you can posit it and start to imagine it, okay, all of these PFP projects, though, in some way anthropomorphic, they're creatures. They're animals, they're people that we can identify with. And the problem that we have is liquidity. So what if you had an NFT that was called vermin, and this vermin had an elastic supply, and these things breathe like mfs.
00:22:09.560 - 00:23:15.632, Speaker B: There's constantly more vermin being produced. And so you incentivize people to become exterminators, and they keep the supply in check. But this thing is contracting, expanding, and contracting, expanding, so it effectively becomes a stable NFT with an elastic supply, what would you be able to do with it? Or similarly, if you had something like own, where you had an NFT whose base value could never sink beneath a dollar, but whose upper level could always be whatever it wanted to be? And so you start using the same game, theoretics, the three three, bonding, staking, or selling as owned. Now, I haven't figured all this stuff out yet, but I feel like unless we have those kind of conversations, how could we ever push what an NFT could be beyond simply, it either is fungible or it's not fungible. But what if it's both those things at the same time, but entirely consistent with what nfts are? I don't know what the answer is, but I'm always thinking about this stuff because I feel like we have enough smart people that if we ask those questions, something cool might come out of it. Do you know what I mean?
00:23:15.766 - 00:24:04.012, Speaker C: Yeah, completely agree. I think there's a difference between creating. So let's kind of stick to pricing first. I think there's a difference between creating something that can price a certain type of NFT versus something that can price any random NFT in the world, right. Because there's just so many of those, and so much of the value of them is subjective and speculative, and often it's new stuff that we haven't seen before, so it's hard to predict what they're going to do in the future. I don't think that it's impossible to have algorithmic ways to predict the price of subcategories of these nfts. And I think some nfts are just going to be just going to represent normal real world financial contracts, right? And those things are relatively easy to price.
00:24:04.012 - 00:24:53.308, Speaker C: You can look at this kind of cash flows and all that kind of thing. So I think it depends on what kind of asset an NFT is. And then I think your points around, I think you make two separate points, right? So I think the first one is around stable nfts, which I think is interesting. But I think the broader point that you make is more around the design space for nfts is just so massive and it's just so much we can do with it. And I agree with you. I think we've just barely started to scratch the surface of what this is going to look like. It still kind of reminds me of the early days of film, when essentially they would just do a play and put the camera in the third row from the front and film the play.
00:24:53.308 - 00:25:25.576, Speaker C: And it took a few years for people to figure out, hey, well, actually, we can do establishing shots and cutscenes and all these other things that now are kind of part of the canon of filmmaking. But in the beginning, we just did plays with a camera in front of it, and I think we're still in that stage of NFTs. I think the real crazy and weird stuff is still coming. And I think the next ten to 20 years, the same explosion we went to when we went from brochure websites on the Internet to what we have today, we're going to see in the.
00:25:25.598 - 00:26:41.680, Speaker B: NFT space, well, there's definitely some truth to that, but I think it will happen a lot faster from the world that I come in from decentralized finance. You just see everybody pinging off each other's ideas and really trying to solve these things that we've never really challenged before, we never really thought, well, what if we didn't do it like that? And I think that the thinking now starts to really go in that direction. I often see from paradigm, for instance, some interesting thought experiments. They came up with the floor perpetual for nfTs. So it was a synthetic NFT that tracks the floor price of a given project. Now it seems completely unworkable in real life, but I love the fact that they came up with it, the whole idea of a perpetual synthetic asset for nfTs, it's wild, but once you can build something like that, then it becomes composable. And once you add in composability and then you can bridge it over to any number of the top chains out there, then you've got this beautifully transitory, portable sort of asset that can really work for you, even when it's just sitting in a wallet.
00:26:41.680 - 00:27:34.064, Speaker B: It has so much to offer you that's beyond its face value. And then I suspect that the ties that you will then have to it emotionally will increase exponentially, because this thing is a companion. It helps you do things. And I don't see fungible tokens ever having that same kind of relationship with people. It's wild. And like you said, I'm all for this experimentation with financialization of nfts, because I do think it allows them to become these overnight working tools and assets that also kind of can be your peer. It's so much to wrap your head around, but we're building this stuff in real time.
00:27:34.064 - 00:27:37.584, Speaker B: And I think the more we talk about it and the more we expose it to people, the more they'll think.
00:27:37.622 - 00:27:38.096, Speaker A: Actually, you know what?
00:27:38.118 - 00:27:54.472, Speaker B: I've got an idea. And then maybe you could borrow this idea and this idea, and then suddenly you've got this incredible thing. I always use the example of alchemyx, which is self paying loans. Just the idea of a loan that you take out, and then if you hold it long enough, your only debt is time. That's beautiful.
00:27:54.606 - 00:28:31.380, Speaker C: I love that. Yeah. And we're already seeing kind of yield bearing nfts starting to crop up, right? And if you've got a yield bearing NFT, you can do an NFT loan that pays itself off, which I think is also super interesting. But I think the most interesting thing you were saying over there is kind of that emotional connection that people have to nfts. And it's kind of like nfts have this, they have not exactly the same, but a lot of the same economic power that you get from fungible tokens. Obviously, they're not as liquid. So that's like a trade off, but they've got this emotional connection.
00:28:31.380 - 00:29:31.924, Speaker C: If you lose your ape, for example, you're not going to care if you lose a random ether. And then later on buy back a different ether, you don't care, but you kind of build up this emotional connection with this asset. And in that sense, it's not really an asset, it's an artwork or it's like an expression of your personality. But then as a side effect, this thing also gains a huge amount of value and you can use it as collateral to kind of do stuff in your real life. So I just find that super interesting. I just recently bought a house and needed some kind of bridging finance for the deposit. And being able to use an NFT to get a loan to do that and not have to stand fill in a thousand forms and give my blood and my entire family history at the bank to get a loan is just the kinds of things it allows you to do in your real life while still enjoying the emotional aspect of these assets.
00:29:31.924 - 00:29:35.050, Speaker C: I think, for me, is one of the most exciting things about the space.
00:29:36.140 - 00:30:24.980, Speaker B: It definitely is. And as you rightly said, the ape that I have, I had so many, and believe it or not, I gave them away. I didn't even sell them. I gave them away and I still have one, and it's very dear to me, but it's going to my kids. And I'm thinking, well, would they sell it? Or would they be in a position to say, you know what, we need to pay for driving lessons, or we need to go to university, or we need to buy a house? Could that ape power that transaction? And even from this far out, you can say pretty much 100% certainty. Yes, of course it could. And once you get there, then you can start to build better NFT propositions, and you can start to build more interesting NFT propositions.
00:30:24.980 - 00:30:52.860, Speaker B: But it's such an efficient mechanism for carrying culture, identity, ownership, membership, so many other things. And like you said, you can embed other assets into an NFT. We were talking to the team from ASM and from fluffs last night about the AI component that they've built for NFT. So your NFT could be wandering around the metaverse selling tickets for you while you sleep. Same asset.
00:30:53.020 - 00:30:53.440, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:53.510 - 00:31:24.830, Speaker B: I mean, that is wild. And it could also be actively yield farming for you, or making sure that your loans don't get liquidated if you're doing stuff on anchor on the borrower side of the protocol. This is wild how on earth. Do I explain to my mum that that's what she can do with this quote unquote. Jpeg. Right click, save. That is a profoundly disruptive piece of technology.
00:31:24.830 - 00:31:35.068, Speaker B: These are assets with applike properties that even go beyond what apps can do because they've got AI built. This space is so crazy.
00:31:35.234 - 00:32:09.880, Speaker C: It's so crazy awesome. It's amazing. And really, for me, I think this is as important as kind of when property rights became enshrined in the nation state. All of a sudden we have like a post nation state, fully digitally native property rights for digital assets. The implications of that are just so mind bending. I think even anybody who's super bullish on the space, I think, is still underestimating how much this is going to change our lives kind of in the next few decades.
00:32:11.660 - 00:33:25.008, Speaker B: The funny thing is, my kids, for instance, they play a game where they build a treehouse, and every day they open a mystery box and they get certain materials, and they can then build new things on their treehouse, and they can use my phone, and they can make this thing grow up in the middle of the living room, and they can walk around it in ar. And I look at it and go, this is totally normal. But I now remember what I was doing when I was their age, and if I had looked at that, I would have gone, wow, this is the future. And of course, that gameplay element is absolutely normal. But then we're talking about finance, understanding, trading markets, understanding just simply peer to peer transactions, hosting your own keys, all of these kind of things. This seems very grown up, and yet something about the Zoomer generation, the gen alpha, they're just very comfortable with the notion of peer to peer trading, of anonymity, of so many of the things that I still find a little bit unusual about this space. But like teenagers, they don't care.
00:33:25.008 - 00:34:01.310, Speaker B: They're completely okay with all of that stuff. And I always worried that the financial component of what we talk about would be alien and off putting. But I suspect that teenagers are actually going to be way more game for this stuff and understanding it, and kind of piling financialization and numbers into this entertainment prospect than millennials will, and they'll get it much faster. And I'm kind of running my own experiment in house, in my own family to see what my kids do and how they pick it up, but they're so up for it. They love nfTs. They're like six and nine years old. They're like, yeah.
00:34:03.280 - 00:34:07.890, Speaker C: So you got your own metaverse portfolio managers in house.
00:34:09.540 - 00:34:30.550, Speaker B: I've got my own NFT sweatshop, just churning out 10,000 asset NFT projects, collectibles. We're just churning. I'm just waiting for my daughter to say, listen, I've got this idea for this 10,000 collection NFT series that I'm going to sell to my mates. And I'd be like, yeah, I'll fund it.
00:34:31.400 - 00:34:45.550, Speaker C: Isn't it amazing that you can do that kind of thing, right? You don't need anybody's mission. You can just go ahead and do it, like build a whole new IP franchise, kind of just with some mates on the Internet. It's amazing.
00:34:46.960 - 00:35:52.770, Speaker B: And who's going to stop you? That's the crazy thing. If you really want to do it, you go do it. It's the most terrifying thing, if you're a regulator to try and understand where are the protections, and then you suddenly realize that, well, there aren't any. And then as a parent, you suddenly realize, well, I am in fact, ground zero for educating my kids in how to converse with strangers on the Internet, in how to interact with anything that's asking them for money, in how to safeguard assets, but also in understanding that they have an incredible opportunity to do things in ways that the generation before them just simply couldn't or were denied or were unable to. And you have to take the pluses with the negatives. But what a weird, transitional, transformative time in society we're living through right now. And what a privilege to be part of it.
00:35:53.460 - 00:36:36.720, Speaker C: Yeah, 100% agree with that sentiment. Like Annie always says that she kind of moved away from DFI into nfts because nfts are crypto with a soul. And I do kind of feel that a little bit. So it is this cultural component, and all of a sudden having artists being able to kind of make a living and do what they're passionate about and not sell their time to kind of big corporations to do marketing for them. I really think it's amazing time to kind of be a tech technologist and also just for arts in general. And just the amount of creativity that's just being unleashed worldwide is just super exciting for me.
00:36:36.790 - 00:37:05.544, Speaker A: Yeah. And I would like to add to that because I think just to illustrate that point, we just can have a look at, and I haven't been in either of those two events. Right. I've just kind of observed it from whatever is coming to Twitter, from participants. Right. There was this big event around bitcoin in Miami, like, I don't know, half a year ago or something. And then there is this NFT New York.
00:37:05.544 - 00:37:53.770, Speaker A: And if you just compare, and then there is what's happening there in those two places, and the vibe and the energy and the impressions from the people who were there, it's a completely different thing. And that's where the difference is the cultural element of it, the energy and the philosophy and kind of the type of personalities that are in there. So there is so much creativity and so much, I don't know, like cozy, friendly community sort know atmosphere in the NFT space compared to Defi, at least based on my experience. I don't know, Robin, you've been in both, you've experienced both, so maybe we can get your observations as well.
00:37:54.620 - 00:37:55.370, Speaker C: Well.
00:37:57.420 - 00:39:11.490, Speaker B: I don't want to romanticize NFTs unnecessarily because I think there is a danger that we all fall victim to this kind of saccharine gushiness when it comes to this space. Because if people have had a hard time because of COVID and they're able to subsist thanks to selling some art in a way that they were unable to before, it can induce feelings of euphoria and excessive outpourings of sentiment about things, which I think is unhelpful. Actually, at the end of the day, Defi is crypto with a saber. It slashes and burns and cuts, and it is ruthless and it is brutal and code is law and that is savage and actually very grounding in so many ways. But also, if we remember last year, everyone got carried away with yield farms and everything else because they were just making money hand over fist. And that's because they were just, your gain is somebody else's loss, and that is the crypto markets. We just pile into stuff and enthusiasm gets the better of all of our better judgment, and that's okay.
00:39:11.490 - 00:40:29.336, Speaker B: But I tend to feel like the people who end up in NFTs are, as you say, more soulful or less cynical and can get burned pretty easily by all of that. So I try and keep an even mind about all of this. What I can say is, I see the best path forward is if you are feeling like Defi is not for you, then that is the greatest single reason you can find to go and explore it, like every single thing where you find yourself going, oh, I don't get it, I don't like it. Go there, because then you'll find much more kind of balance in your perception around the space because there's echo chambers everywhere. We all look for confirmation bias all the time because there's so much information asymmetry so the best thing you can do is not do that and actually run towards the things that make you scared and make you feel overwhelmed. And I can tell you this from just the pure, simple fact that each week I have to sit down and come up with the content that we're going to cover. And I go through everything that's been announced, all the different kind of protocols that are out there, and most of them I don't understand.
00:40:29.336 - 00:41:23.000, Speaker B: And so I then have to sit down and work my way painfully through the gitbooks and all the documentation, and I have to sit there and feel stupid for hours on end because I don't get it until the point at which I'm prepared to sit in front of a camera and tell people that I do get it. And that hard work, that homework, it forces me to confront the things that I would normally turn away from. And in the process of doing that, I gain a much better understanding and a much better grounding to have conversations about things. And it gives me that kind of circumspection to be able to say, this doesn't work. This does work. If Defi is baffling and confusing, start somewhere safe, like terra anchor protocol. And if NFts just look weird, take some time.
00:41:23.000 - 00:41:35.090, Speaker B: But all of those things, crypto rewards you if you put the time in. But you have to be contrarian, I think. Always run towards the things that make you the most scared and then you'll get the most out of it.
00:41:35.700 - 00:41:38.450, Speaker A: Really good point. Yeah, I agree with you.
00:41:42.560 - 00:41:48.732, Speaker C: Should we give some other people a chance to speak? I've been hogging the conversation for way too long.
00:41:48.866 - 00:42:15.850, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. If anyone wants to get on stage and share ideas, opinions, or have any questions, please feel free to send a request and I'll put you up on the stage. And just since we spoke about the record loan, I have pinned the tweet on top so you can have a look at how that NFt looks like.
00:42:22.860 - 00:42:25.704, Speaker B: Hey, meta. Hey, how you doing?
00:42:25.902 - 00:42:54.372, Speaker D: So super massive, congrats on the Defiant. It's obviously a show I have to watch every time you put some content up. You're amazing. And Steven, hello from South Africa and congratulations on NFT Phi. And I have a question for both of you. It's about timing, and I'm not putting pressure on you, I'm just very curious. So for supermassive, when would you say will be the time when you'll be able to use the.
00:42:54.372 - 00:43:12.040, Speaker D: I don't remember what it's called, but the suit. To be able to put your avatar as your image, what's your timing? And for Stephen, I'd ask you if there's plans and what will be the timing to get more than 90 day loans on NFT Phi?
00:43:13.820 - 00:43:28.990, Speaker B: I'll let Steven go first because that's a big question you just asked me. And also metapunk, you've got the ten KTF neo Tokyo background as your banner. I have so many questions about that. Steven, you go first.
00:43:30.480 - 00:43:53.960, Speaker C: Cool. Awesome. So on the 90 day loan. So part of that is just because we are launching v two of the protocol with a whole bunch of new features in there that's coming probably early December. We're just making sure that we kind of test everything thoroughly and that it's ready to go. But as soon as we go live with that, we will have kind of unlimited duration loans.
00:43:56.700 - 00:43:58.088, Speaker B: Wow, sounds good.
00:43:58.254 - 00:44:03.576, Speaker D: So next year we'll be able to have one year loans, two year loans, whatever it might be.
00:44:03.758 - 00:44:04.890, Speaker C: Yes, exactly.
00:44:07.680 - 00:44:36.950, Speaker D: Okay, thank you. By the way, I've been using NFT Phi for the last couple of was my name was Danny San on that discord live that you did about a week or two ago, and I asked about safety and security before I loaned my punk out. And I'm very happy. So if anybody's in the audience and they're pondering loaning, at least you have my antidote. I'm very happy and I've been doing good with that. So thanks again.
00:44:37.720 - 00:44:45.210, Speaker C: Awesome. Thanks, meta. It's good to know that we've got some fellow Africans using the platform. Super happy to hear.
00:44:46.540 - 00:45:40.152, Speaker B: Well, I think that just proves the point, doesn't it? There is no more valued asset in the NFT space right now than a punk. And so to have the confidence in a protocol to put it into a smart contract and lock it up for a period of time, that is the question that all of these blue chips will have to confront is like, can I trust the smart contract? Smart contract. Risk is, it's a hard one to quantify, and I don't think any of us really understand that. But we kind of have to take it upon ourselves to be the pioneers and take on those risks, but without putting ourselves at risk, then nothing advances. Nothing grows. To that point, though, meta, you were asking about a specific suit that I will be wearing. So the background to this is that we make films, and I say films rather than videos.
00:45:40.152 - 00:46:18.992, Speaker B: We do make a lot of content, of course, but what we try to make is films. We try to make content that is entertaining and is able to tell a story in as rich a way as we are able. But unfortunately, given the speed and pace that we have to make it, it's very difficult for us to leave the office and go anywhere else. So it's becoming increasingly clear that we need to bring the outside world in. And what we've discovered is that Unreal engine could be the platform for us to do that. And it opens up the world of real time. Ray tracing it open up the world of literally any environment that you might want to go to, is an asset pack that you can download.
00:46:18.992 - 00:46:54.624, Speaker B: And it's worth bearing in mind that ten years ago, most people will have heard of Beeple because he was creating asset packs. That was what Beeple was known for. It was assets for vjs. That's how you interface with Beeple. And then since then, he's become what we know now as one of the most significant crypto artists around. But now we can get scans from quicksall. And these are these incredibly detailed photorealistic scans of real world environments that you can just kit bash and create whatever environment you want, and people are creating them all the time.
00:46:54.624 - 00:47:36.844, Speaker B: This is a global community of people plugging into this massive games ecosystem. Never before was it a film tool. Now it can be. And so what we're seeing is this collision of nfts, metaverses and virtual production, because we had to kind of make do with whatever we could make in our own environments. So now I could film myself against the green screen and put myself on the surface of Mars or in a space station or in Tokyo with relative ease, and make it look pretty damn good. But in real time, that's a process that would normally have given you a massive post production headache. But now we can do it incredibly fast.
00:47:36.844 - 00:48:20.616, Speaker B: The next stage to that is to take pfps, these avatars, and allow them to come to life in a very high resolution, high production value context. But in real time, that respects the high turnaround, fast paced production environment that we are in, where we have to produce maybe one, two videos every single day. But I want them to be as good as they possibly can be. I want you to see the thumbnail and go, oh my God, what did they do this week? Unreal engine virtual production will allow us to do that. But the thing that we need is we need to be able to puppet these digital assets in real time. And that's why we ordered a mocap suit. And if you don't know what mocap is, it's motion capture.
00:48:20.616 - 00:49:09.820, Speaker B: It's Andy Circus Golem. That technology has come down in price to the level where we can actually build a motion capture studio ourselves. It's not free, but it's for a relatively small amount. And suddenly I could be telling you the story of me bits as a me bit, but make it look photorealistic and as if I'm just walking around the city of London. Or I could be a clone x and be walking around Tokyo telling you that story, but it wouldn't feel like anything clunky and weirdly post produced. It would just be me in a suit. But performing in real time to you from that is, that's not the future.
00:49:09.820 - 00:50:06.510, Speaker B: That's right now. And it's incredible just seeing how rapidly this unreal engine environment is being built out and being created. But that's where we're going. And I think what's going to really blow people's minds is just how valuable the asset that you buy is when you put yourself into it, when you add your own personality, your own distinctiveness, your own value creation potential into it, and then you pair that up with an AI that can emulate you and can do 50 60% of the job that you would normally do, but while you are sleeping and walk around the metaverse and present itself as you, or just be a proxy for you. I mean, those kind of things. That is really placing a very high ceiling on the value of PFPs and NFTs as a category that is still very virgin grand for now.
00:50:07.760 - 00:50:26.052, Speaker D: Yeah, I totally agree. You say it's the present. I think it is the future in the sense that if you're not doing it yet, then many others still have to wait. And that's why I'm asking when I know this is a tough question, because the technology is just reaching your hands and nobody else is doing it yet.
00:50:26.186 - 00:50:42.244, Speaker B: Oh no. It's a really easy question. As soon as I possibly can. So there's two components to this, one of which is, do I have a green screen? Yes. Do we have unreal engine? Yes. So really we could do it tomorrow, is the honest truth. We could do it tomorrow.
00:50:42.244 - 00:51:24.244, Speaker B: We haven't done it yet because we haven't honestly had enough time to production ready. The workflow, the Mocap suit itself, I have no control over that. I bought one back in August, still hasn't arrived. There is a global supply chain crisis, and that's the problem. Rococo that makes the mocap suits, because there's a few different manufacturers of mocap suits. Xsense is really the industry standard, but Rococo makes the kind of consumer level version they released a second iteration of that suit about a week ago. We immediately bought it, but again, it won't ship until January, and even then that's not guaranteed.
00:51:24.244 - 00:51:41.950, Speaker B: So I'm hoping that before Christmas we will have done our first broadcast with the Mocap suit. But again, it's contingent on the thing arriving. However, that doesn't deny us the opportunity to put me in Unreal engine and start doing virtual production. We could do that next week.
00:51:43.680 - 00:52:16.760, Speaker D: Okay, thanks both. I'll step down and supermassive, if you have any. I'm seriously into ten KTF. Like, seriously into it. So if you want to do a space of some time and ask away or dm me or whatever, feel free. I don't think this is probably the place to get into it, but it's absolutely fascinating, and it's the most fun discord that I'm a part of. It's just innovation that only a person like deeple could come up with.
00:52:16.760 - 00:52:26.040, Speaker D: It's beyond my best expectations. So I'm more than available to give you what's going on with ten KTF.
00:52:26.940 - 00:53:15.080, Speaker B: Well, if you don't know what ten KTF is, it's an ongoing narrative about this tailor called Wagmi Sam, and he might have or might not have been kidnapped by toads. But what I love about it is it's a slow burner. It's like you just take your time and you buy these crafting elements, so there's like threads and other things. But what ten KTF has done brilliantly is they've created a metacommunity. So they've done only ones. And apes, mutant apes, cool cats, they were all able to wrap their nft around an item of clothing or a backpack. So you saw these incredibly beautiful 3d renderings of your NFT wrapped as a backpack or as a pair of shoes.
00:53:15.080 - 00:54:06.860, Speaker B: And now we can craft our own items, but they're taking a really long time to deliver it. It's beautiful. I'm a big fan. I think it's just a kind of nice, sort of slow burning NFT project with a timeline, with evolution, with gameplay, but also the assets that come out, the other slides, high quality, and it allows lots of different projects to come and be part of it and intermingle and have conversations with each other. And I think that's one of the best things about the NFT space, is that whereas you see an enormous amount of tribalism in fungible tokens, like one ring to rule them all, one chain to rule them all, in nfTs, we see that a little bit but not anywhere near as much. And there's a lot of crossover and a lot of cross fertilization of ideas and that's so, so healthy.
00:54:12.090 - 00:54:15.080, Speaker A: Ok, I'm bringing Mitch up on the.
00:54:19.850 - 00:54:20.882, Speaker E: Hello, hello.
00:54:21.036 - 00:54:22.010, Speaker A: Hey, Mitch.
00:54:22.990 - 00:55:19.370, Speaker E: Hi. Good morning. If you are in the west coast, in the east, I really appreciate the talk. This is actually the first time I have looked into NFT Phi, also looked into defiant, and then I heard ten KTF. So I'm bullish this morning and I just want to say that I'm actually extremely interested in this narrative of ten KTF. I think you did a really good rundown and I think it really sets a tone for where I want to see the NFT space, which is sort of like these more long, drawn out narratives and expectations set by the team deployments iteratively over time. That really kind of pulls away from the instant gratification of buying low and selling high.
00:55:19.370 - 00:55:58.280, Speaker E: Which is not to say that I'm not involved with all of that. I definitely am still always actively looking for good alpha. But a project like ten KTF where you can build conviction through research, through gathering information with the community, and solving puzles in real time, this is the shit that keeps me up at night and this is what gets me up every morning. So I just got to say, I think you guys have really good taste in the NFT projects that you are following along with, and I'm excited to hear what other insights you all might have.
00:56:02.410 - 00:56:41.382, Speaker D: Let me just highlight that super massive was touching on and that I think is really like the core of it. Like last night, there were some clues and we had to go figure them out. And it's crazy because you've got apes with cool cats with on ones with penguins, with other projects, wizards and all of that. We're all cooperating and this has been the ideology behind it. The first thing was, how can we get. Apes are mostly in the ape community and cool cats are mostly in their community. And there's even animosity sometimes between these communities because at the end of the day they do compete at floor price level.
00:56:41.382 - 00:57:33.746, Speaker D: And ten KTF is just the beginning of somehow getting, at the moment, seven different projects. And last night we were, well, for all these weeks we've just been cooperating. It doesn't matter which community you come from, because in that community, we're just one community. And the next community to join, as far as we've been teased or we figured out in our clues, is going to be the gutter community. So the cats, et cetera, and then probably they're going to keep on just adding a new ten KTF here and there. And soon this will be a community of 100,000 or 200,000 different little communities cooperating altogether for one goal, which definitely was lacking because there is a competitive feel between projects, and in this community, it's diluted and it doesn't matter. Some of the profile picks are one ETH floor, some of them are 30 ETH floor.
00:57:33.746 - 00:57:39.240, Speaker D: But in ten KTF, we're all equals. Trying to figure out the next phase of what's going to happen.
00:57:41.930 - 00:58:32.022, Speaker B: Yeah, you've hit the nail on the head here, because 10,000 assets might seem like a lot, but if you think about penetration, then I don't know how many individual owners own apes, but it's maybe half. You can see that when the Matrix does a drop, it's 100,000 assets and it's still nowhere near enough the kind of level of penetration. It's essentially a bunch of islands like the maldives that you have to take a boat and paddle to the other one. And of course, they all become incredibly insular. Ten KTF meta communities. And of course, the metaverse itself is promoting cooperation, it's promoting dialogue. One of the worst narratives in crypto is hoddle.
00:58:32.022 - 00:58:57.778, Speaker B: Hoddle says clutch. Do nothing, say nothing, speak the same language and retain control over everything and be passive. That is just the worst thing you can say. Any government wants you to spend your money. They want you to be active. They want you to be circulating and sloshing and connecting and interacting with everyone. We've missed that.
00:58:57.778 - 00:59:22.746, Speaker B: And it quickly becomes a massive circle jerk in these PFP projects because everyone just goes, oh, I'm comfortable here. This just suits me. This feels right. And I think the more we can promote that sense of, you know what? We're just going to jam you and me, and you can be you and I can be me, and we can just kind of have this conversation about what on earth this all means. Oh, that's a cool one. Where did that come from? Them. That's where.
00:59:22.746 - 01:00:04.518, Speaker B: I think the NFT space has done a really good job of kind of cross pollinating culture and weird ideas, and it's so unthreatening, the whole thing, because if you think about bitcoin, it is a threat to the global economic system. NFTs are a threat to nobody. Nobody goes, oh, yeah, these nfTs, they're going to take down governments. I know. They're just a thing. It's just like the tv show that you love to watch and that makes them a lot more wholesome and a lot less worrisome in many, many ways. And I think that's why, personally, that's why I have so much more fun here.
01:00:04.518 - 01:00:10.200, Speaker B: The conversations tend to be a lot less political. Tend, I say.
01:00:11.710 - 01:01:51.080, Speaker E: Well, to your point too, right? I think you bring up just sort of that concept of hodling and not really engaging, right? It's a passive thing, whereas a project like ten KTF projects, like cyber cons, like mutant cats, perhaps even anything PoC does, it furthers engagement. It incentivizes you to basically engage with your NFTs in a way that keeps you interested, that keeps you staked, that keeps you invested, whether it be emotionally, whether it just be you want to crack the code. You are engaged with your NFTs in a way that perhaps six months ago you simply were not. And I think that's another interesting take with ten KTF and a model that I can definitely see becoming more of the meta as we move into this next phase of nfts. Is that how do we incentivize collectors to engage with their nfts and not even think about whether I should hold them or not, but more so, how do we keep engagement rate up so they're not even thinking about sort of like leaving and not participating, but rather they're active and working with a community. I think that's a really interesting set of things that we should think about, especially if you're going to create a project, is to incentivize collectors to actively engage with their nfts that they perhaps could not have done so in the past.
01:01:51.790 - 01:02:45.638, Speaker B: Well, listen, you've set up quite a few things there which sound very marketing e and very kind of businessy. And I understand where that's come from. So active and engagement and interaction, all these kind of things. And my observations from all of this are that these things either organically occur or they don't. And if you try and mechanically create them through various mechanisms, then inevitably they run out of juice. I think it's one of the things from observing how board apes grew up is that nobody sat down and said, listen, this is going to be the greatest community ever. We're going to actively position ourselves against me bit, and we're going to price ourselves as the people's NFT.
01:02:45.638 - 01:03:30.422, Speaker B: Nobody said that. They just went, well, this probably feels about right. And then they did it, and then people said, oh, well, you know, I really feel like my ape could be a coffee brand or a credit card that just happened organic. And so the moment we start to kind of say, well, we have to do this. We need this to happen, then I think you're already behind. Actually, one of the greatest things about dows and cryptocurrency is that they respect the fact that people have limited time and that the time they can give you one week might not be the same time they can give you the next week. So really what you're creating is soup, organic soup, primordial soup, and creating the conditions in which things can happen, might happen, could happen.
01:03:30.422 - 01:04:16.662, Speaker B: And then the rest of it's storytelling. And the best storytellers are always going to win. And what I think most people underestimate is you can tell one good story once, but to keep telling that story week in, week out, every day of the year, every week of the year, that's a mighty skill to have. And it's very quickly apparent who has that skill and who doesn't have that skill. Obviously someone like Steve Jobs, he had that, you know, tell me who in this space, and I won't accept Charles Hoskinson as the answer. So tell me who in this space has that skill? And there's not many. Not many at, you know, understanding who's there.
01:04:16.662 - 01:04:55.586, Speaker B: This is why I think Beeple is so incredible. The guy literally said, I'm going to make something every day. And he does. I have no idea how he does that. But that resilience to apathy, that resilience to his own shortcomings, just as someone, if you've ever made something or sat down and said, I'm going to make something, it's fucking impossible. But he does it every single day. That in of itself is just an almighty green flag for just going, okay, I'm willing to go with this person because I know above all else that they have staying power.
01:04:55.586 - 01:05:07.590, Speaker B: And when they commit to something, they commit, and it's going to happen. When we talk about engagement and all these kind of things, they feel very flawed as ideas.
01:05:10.730 - 01:06:17.600, Speaker E: I believe that we're talking about the same thing because you did mention conditions, right? Conditions to allow people to or allow that organic soup to form. And that's simply what I'm talking about here, too, with Beeple's project of ten KTF, whether he's come out with it or not, ten KTF in and of itself, gives you an incentive every single Thursday to tune in, gives you an incentive every single day to come into the community. So I believe we're talking about the same thing. And when I say engagement, I mean like mechanics, like staking mechanics, like voting for a dow. These are all really interesting conditions, as you said, to create that organic soup. And you really see projects that incorporate these conditions find greater success, in my opinion, of the 99% of projects that just don't really incentivize collectors to do anything versus the 1% that do. There's a real clear underlying sort of consistency with those conditions being met and a community being formed around them.
01:06:19.570 - 01:07:15.594, Speaker B: Well, the problematic thing is that if you say engagement is the metric, then people not engaging is sign of failure. And I don't necessarily think that is. It would be much more helpful if you could see who had read messages rather than necessarily who was engaging with them. Because I spend a lot of time lurking in discord channels, and I simply don't have time to be active or proactive. It doesn't mean that I'm not a participant in those communities. And so, as you rightly said, things like staking, we're in the NFT Phi chat here, and there are plenty of projects which right now are assessing whether or not they should have a token attached to an NFT. And there are plenty that have board apes, as they inevitably do, are leading the way with this discussion, having announced that they are considering a token.
01:07:15.594 - 01:08:13.710, Speaker B: Whether or not they go ahead with that under the legal framework or the legal context that they're in, it remains to be seen. But there are other projects which have know primarily. But of course before that, hashmarks with the naming token subducts, sewer rat social club have cheers. I mean, there's a bunch of them. Do those assets, do those tokens have any meaningful value if you're a lender in a protocol like NFT Phi? I don't know. And that's why earlier we were talking about a stable NFT, I feel like if you could create the conditions under which NFTs generate tokens, but they're not their own weird native token, but they're a universally agreed upon stable NFT with its own economic policy. Then for a project like NFT Phi, suddenly that becomes a lot more interesting from so many different perspectives.
01:08:13.710 - 01:09:14.018, Speaker B: And that's why I keep coming up with this thought experiment. Like if you know that an NFT created coin is probably the most shit of shit coins that you can create, and let's be honest about it, here it is. Unless it has explicit and fantastic utility, it is a shitcoin and it will have an illiquid market and you won't be able to trade it, and it has no meaning whatsoever. If you have a stable coin or a stable coin like asset, which is an NFT specific piece that could get really interesting. And then you can have, as we're talking about with ten KTF, an environment in which different protocols, different projects can talk to each other and collaborate, but they still have their own communities back home. If you have a universally agreed upon stable asset that can work across all different pfps, that really gets exciting. But of course, I'm just pulling this stuff out of my ass, so it could be completely unworkable.
01:09:14.018 - 01:09:18.600, Speaker B: But unless you put it out there, how would anyone ever think about it?
01:09:20.010 - 01:09:22.666, Speaker E: I love that model. And I agree with you too.
01:09:22.688 - 01:09:22.922, Speaker C: Right?
01:09:22.976 - 01:10:28.298, Speaker E: Without true deflationary mechanics of a token, making it, giving it utility, and allowing collectors to really use it in the ecosystem, which it's framed. Like you said, cybercoms is a great example. Cyberkongs, right now, you stake a cyber Kong, you receive ten bananas a day, and to help increase their network effect and the utility of that banana outside of the cybercons ecosystem, you can actually apply for your project to somehow incorporate the banana utility token, and then you can become a partner of Cybercons. It's actually a win win situation across the board, especially if you're a cyber cons or even a banana holder. So I really enjoy your take with the defi stuff. I'm actually quite brand new to it. I think the first project to really show me the potential of what DeFi can do is mutant cats, or even more so, PoC and his entire ecosystem powered through ash and all the mechanics there, through all of his collections.
01:10:28.298 - 01:10:31.760, Speaker E: So I'm quite brand new, and I'm interested to learn more, for sure.
01:10:33.090 - 01:11:26.062, Speaker B: Well, I think that kind of encapsulates the point, which is DeFi and NFTs are seen as these two separate things, but they're really not, and they really shouldn't be either. It's a pretty awkward analogy or metaphor, but we can think of the metaverse as this massive sandbox world that we can explore. And if you think of Defi as the engine of a car, the coach work around your car is your NFT. So the sort of the exterior skin, all the things that people see can be that, but Defi is fundamentally the engine. Without it, you don't, you know, free commerce, free trade is the ability to move around your environment. And then the metaverse itself is the map. But when you call it a map, it feels like a location, it feels like a place.
01:11:26.062 - 01:12:02.986, Speaker B: Whereas for me, the metaverse, the promise of the metaverse, is simply two things. It's ownership and agency. It's the power to choose your own destiny, and also the power to believe that the world revolves around you. That particularly millennials have grown accustomed to this idea that they must move from where they are to the big city where the jobs are, because otherwise they will become stagnant. In the metaverse concept, the value always rotates around where you are. So when you move, it goes with you. And it's the idea of being a snail and you carry your house with you.
01:12:02.986 - 01:12:26.898, Speaker B: But the best turbocharged snail you can possibly be. That's where the metaverse starts to become really interesting. And then your nft just is your shell, whatever. But it's a terrible, terrible analogy. And I'm always working on how to express it better. But that idea, know, the way we navigate video games. The character in the middle of the screen doesn't move, but the world rotates around you.
01:12:26.898 - 01:12:49.930, Speaker B: I feel that for me is what the metaverse is about. It's not. The world over there is where I should be. The grass is greener on the side. No, the grass is green right where I am right now. And all I have to do is move and then I add value to wherever I go. But I think there's a lot of deprogramming that has to happen for most people to even think that that might even be a possibility.
01:12:55.020 - 01:13:55.896, Speaker D: I just add two cent before about the engagement issue and also bring NFTFi back into the convo. Which is the reason that cryptopunk, my cryptopunk is my largest NFT exposure is exactly because larvae labs doesn't do anything. And then you have on the other extreme, let's say board AP yacht club or ten KTF, where they do a lot of things, right? There was an ape fest the other day. So that's literally hiring a yacht and getting 2000 people with djs and musicians and food and drink in New York together. It's the complete other extreme where the project does a lot. And I appreciate NFT five, for example, just the way I appreciate larvae labs. Because it seems to me that the mission is to really get out of the way and make the infrastructure for lenders and borrowers to be able to do whatever they need to do between them, to agree on dates, to agree on rates, to agree on the amount to be loaned.
01:13:55.896 - 01:14:28.280, Speaker D: And in the future there will be more options. But the more that NFT Phi is just the background and doesn't get involved. It doesn't make rules and doesn't limit things or tell people how they're supposed to do or not do the stronger it is, because it just shows the security of it. And that, for me, is the same philosophy of larvae labs. I'm glad that there's no real engagement with larvae labs and cryptopunks. They just made it. It's out.
01:14:28.280 - 01:15:06.310, Speaker D: People claimed it, people are selling it. They don't even collect royalties on the sales of crypto punks. And that's it. It's out there. And that, for me, makes it a safer asset than an asset where the founders or the devs are constantly innovating and doing things on top of whatever they're building, because at some point they could make detrimental mistakes. I mean, I'll use an exaggerated example, but imagine something really disastrous happened during apefest that would radically influence the price of board ape yachta, for whatever reason. So I think there's space for all of these agents.
01:15:06.310 - 01:15:55.044, Speaker D: Some are in the background, they don't do anything. Others are in the forefront, and they're extremely active in engaging, like, ten KTF. Some are somewhere in the middle. And I'm actually one of the. I think the few people that celebrates the fact that we have ten or 2030, 40 drops a day, because I see that as an explosion of innovation. I think it would be a very sad year if in 2021, we had had one project drop a week the way it was in the beginning of the year, and everybody would get excited about it, and then we'd move on to the next one. I think 2021 and maybe the next couple of years are just an explosion, and there's a million things happening, and some of them just somehow work out and show all the others things that they can do next.
01:15:55.044 - 01:16:13.160, Speaker D: Like the tokenization you were talking about, and board apes is now considering it. And q one of next year, maybe making it official, great. But that came because so many other projects before were able to innovate and come up with ideas that we can build on each other's ideas.
01:16:13.740 - 01:16:54.276, Speaker B: Yeah, board apes has innovated and led the way. Like the airdrop of the kennel club was definitely the thing that opened the doors for every other project to do a secondary asset. And then the consumables with the serums, I've seen a few different instances of that. Not most of them do a terrible job, but some of them do a really good job. And that idea of having a consumable asset that you have to decide, it's on you to decide how you deploy that. And the game theory involved in that, that's where nfts are vastly superior to fungible tokens. But of course, you got to be in it for the long run.
01:16:54.276 - 01:17:32.160, Speaker B: You got to be in it for a game that you're willing to pay. And I think everyone has to figure out their own risk profile for all of that stuff. But at the end of the day, if my asset is generating tokens at ten a day, can I truly consider that passive income? And the answer is absolutely not, and you shouldn't. And the project itself should never call it that. There is every chance that that token will be worth 98% of what it is worth now in two years time. And that's not in any way, shape or form the basis for any dialogue around passive income. It just simply isn't.
01:17:32.160 - 01:18:28.932, Speaker B: But again, from my perspective, on the side of DFI, stablecoins, the innovation around stablecoins, algorithmic or otherwise, absolutely 100%, makes this stuff very viable and very possible. Which is why I'm constantly trying to get more people from the NFT side of the block to look at DeFI and try and wrap their heads around it and not see it as a threat or see it as obscure or difficult because it has this financial engineering component allied to a cultural component I do think is an unstoppable combination. And so the more we can do to illuminate both sides of the argument for both sides of the argument is going to be helpful. I killed the room. Look at that.
01:18:28.986 - 01:19:01.840, Speaker A: That was a very uncomfortable post. Okay. Yeah, I'm just looking, I don't have requests yet. So once again, if anyone wants to jump on stage and share any opinions or ask any questions, here we are. And how are we doing time wise guys? Because we've been here for almost an hour and a half already. So just for me to understand where we're at.
01:19:01.910 - 01:19:09.970, Speaker B: Yeah, I made an NFT of the time that we started and now I've just issued it for a loan, so we can get.
01:19:10.900 - 01:19:16.550, Speaker A: Oh, sorry about that. Go ahead. Hello.
01:19:17.560 - 01:19:20.324, Speaker D: Hey, you need to unmute yourself.
01:19:20.442 - 01:19:52.110, Speaker F: Hi, how are you doing? Hey, I just kind of tailed Mitch into this conversation. Love the dialogue about engagement. And I think you guys kind of covered the spectrum pretty well. And I just want to touch on the two points. Right. I think the projects in terms of engagement that you guys were covering before, the projects that allow a wealth of ways to engage without forcing you to engage in order to show that you are invested in the project, are kind of interesting. Right.
01:19:52.110 - 01:20:59.172, Speaker F: And I know Mitch brought a pack. He would be like an obvious one, but one where I just don't have to sit there and kind of spam in order to partake in the project. This conversation actually inspired me to go and burn some pages and engage with my lost poet. But I also love the fact that we're talking about giving projects a range to be able to provide multiple collector experiences, and the reason why I think that's important. I think it was Danny that said that he likes the fact that there are 40 projects a day. I think that that's great too, because if we're so early in building this space out, giving developers an opportunity to try things out, fail, come back and create for the community is great because two, three years from now, when the space is more mature, we will have a better community and a better space because of that. Right? I just wanted to come in and just comment that the range of options that are being created for us on a daily basis, and the ability for the community to absorb these things and react to them is what's so beautiful.
01:20:59.226 - 01:22:19.230, Speaker B: About this time in the space. Well, yeah, I'm going to pick up on park because I spend more time studying and making a film about puck than any other subject that I've ever covered in this space. And off the back of it, one thing stood out for me, which was the more I dug into it, the more I dug into puck, what puck had done, what was going on, the more it became apparent that this was just a project of massive substance, whatever it was, and I didn't even end up knowing what it a. There was a degree of hard work and quality and just an engagement and a willingness to just push constantly beyond what ever Park's assumptions had been. And I had to respect that. I think some of what is said on Twitter maybe is excessive, but it's a high quality project all around. And I fully respect mean this NFT space can be overwhelming because there's so many projects coming along, and maximalism is both a good thing and a bad thing.
01:22:19.230 - 01:23:13.212, Speaker B: Bitcoin Maxis have had to fight everyone ridiculing them for longer than any of us. They've had to defend the position, and none of this would be possible without bitcoin. And so if you've been that human that was fighting for this and you've invested in that, to see that position or that work eroded, I could imagine would be quite difficult. But at the same time, maximalism is the path to monopolies, and it's the path to a kind of stifling of innovation. And that's exactly the opposite of what I think this space is all about, which is openness. It's not developer moats it's just an open lake of possibilities. And that's why you see eth maxis pitching themselves against bitcoin maxis.
01:23:13.212 - 01:24:28.970, Speaker B: But then suddenly the most incredible defi ecosystem sprouts up on terra, or it's on Kusama or it's on Solana, and they just won't go there because it doesn't fit their worldview that there could be something else that could be really interesting. It's very difficult to be that open minded to exist in that much chaos, that anything is worthwhile and could be great, because the comfort in knowing that you found the one and the place that you feel comfortable is very difficult to let go of sometimes, particularly in this space where everything is adversarial and it's attacking you constantly. You want to be comfortable and you want to be safe. And maximalism basically, is a defense mechanism to allow you to be safe and allow yourself to protect what you hold dear from everyone who's attacking you. But for me, it's the exact wrong, opposite approach. I embrace all the dumb, stupid ideas ever. I would like somebody on the street to tell me that I'm wrong, and I'd be very happy about that.
01:24:31.340 - 01:25:36.220, Speaker D: Well, if I could speak in defense of the bitcoin maxis, I would say that one thing we need to keep in mind is that bitcoin maximalists, just as you said, have been fighting this fight for the longest, and they're fighting it on both sides. They're fighting it with the other crypto native individuals, whether that be eth or now, the NFT gang or whomever. But most importantly, they're actually the ones up there fighting the crypto and the future, which is going to be more and more intense. I mean, let's remember that when China bans crypto, what happens in the news is it says China bans bitcoin. And so bitcoin maximalists are trying, in my view, to win a much bigger and much more important battle than the battle between which cryptos are better than the other. Like, okay, ETH has these benefits and bitcoin has those benefits, and we can go into that and you can build on it. And bitcoin is a store of value, okay, this is all great.
01:25:36.220 - 01:27:05.860, Speaker D: And then there's what was said before, that NFTs have some soul and culture and arts in it, and that's all nice, but we're all supposed to be fighting the biggest battle of all, which is how to become the money of the world, how to replace the financial system with Defi and with currency inflation, and we're getting a lot of pushback, and we're going to get more and more pushback. And Americans tend to be quite America centric, which is fine, but when we look at the rest of the world, we need to realize that this battle between bitcoin and the national money in that country is going to be fought in every single country. So even if bitcoin does win this battle in the US and regulators tone down and integrate it, this battle still needs to be had in Brazil, in Portugal, in India, in Australia, everywhere on the planet. And I see bitcoin Maxis very much on the defensive. True, but I also see them defending because there's a higher cause behind the whole crypto ideology, which ETh doesn't have to face. It's not very often we hear a congress person or a politician talk about ETH, let alone NFTs. They're letting that be because their battle right now is with bitcoin.
01:27:05.860 - 01:27:45.640, Speaker D: And bitcoin Maxis have to fight both ends. On one end, they're trying to show how solid we are and future oriented, and bitcoin is the way that we need to move forward towards regulators. And then on the other hand, they need to keep on defending themselves against internal attacks in the crypto sphere. And I think it's not valued enough what bitcoin has done and is doing for changing the world. Having said that, I'm also an ETH, Maxi, because I have nfTs. I'm a crypto punk, Maxi. I'm a Tesla maximalist by far.
01:27:45.640 - 01:28:14.928, Speaker D: I have no doubt that at some point, 20% of all vehicles sold per year will be Teslas. And you can be a maximalist on different things that seem to not agree with each other. But at the end of the day, when I look at the whole crypto verse before anything else, I'm a bitcoin maximalist because this is the bigger fight. This is the fight we really need to win altogether so that we can all grow.
01:28:15.094 - 01:29:09.328, Speaker B: Well, it's an interesting point you bring up there, because bitcoin has been the proxy for the entire crypto space. It is the guiding star by which everything lives and dies, and it's the massive weight in the market that bullies everything else into submission. When it moves, everything else moves in the opposite direction. And that's as it should be, has absolutely won its place to be there. The crypto punks are often compared to bitcoin because they're OG, they're old school, they're scarce, and they're owned by people. And they're incredibly valuable and difficult to acquire. I literally, in the last week, have suddenly become aware that bitcoin is no longer the pressing concern for the government.
01:29:09.328 - 01:29:52.960, Speaker B: Stablecoins are. And that's because were in Defi, and we have seen the stablecoin report produced by the government in the US to determine what they should do about stablecoins. And they believe that they're a systemic risk. They believe they're an existential threat to the hegemony of the US dollar, and rightly so. And then, of course, we're seeing central bank digital currencies like the DCEP in China spring up. The DCEP just announced that 10% of the chinese population are using a digital currency. Now, I would expect by the end of next year, it's 100% of China is using that currency.
01:29:52.960 - 01:30:26.704, Speaker B: This is real. This is not bitcoin. But bitcoin started this argument. Bitcoin absolutely 100% provoked this moment in time. And so I agree with you. We have to give bitcoin its due, and we have to respect bitcoin maximalists for having stuck it out against the most horrific criticism and the most difficult kind of times in the entire space when nobody was paying attention. And they just kept it going and they kept mining.
01:30:26.704 - 01:30:30.510, Speaker B: And it's difficult to imagine that.
01:30:32.240 - 01:30:32.748, Speaker C: If.
01:30:32.834 - 01:31:06.804, Speaker B: People stop mining, this thing just stops. It's not possible to run a network if people stop mining. But they did. They kept mining. And so we all live and die by the light of what bitcoin has achieved, and that demands immense respect. But we are now in a moment where defi, stablecoins are about to usurp the narrative. And I don't know how I necessarily feel about that, but in terms of the US government, they see stablecoins as a much greater risk than bitcoin.
01:31:06.804 - 01:31:17.800, Speaker B: Bitcoin is an oddity, it's a weirdness. It's on the balance sheet of Michael Saylor's company, but really, it's just a thing. It's like gold. It's not really. But stable coins, yeah, that's a big risk.
01:31:19.020 - 01:31:20.156, Speaker C: I just want to touch a little.
01:31:20.178 - 01:31:34.768, Speaker F: Bit on what both of you guys kind of said in terms of the maxis and the different camps. I kind of look at it as somebody who left crypto for a couple of years after I lost a whole lot in 2017 and came back.
01:31:34.934 - 01:31:35.650, Speaker B: And.
01:31:37.620 - 01:32:43.830, Speaker F: As a microcosm, and I love that you use punks as a proxy for bitcoin. And I would say board apes is a proxy for Ethereum with its utility in the NFT space. Right. The dialogue that happens between the two maxis and the public nature of the dialogue, when it's respectful, is actually, in my opinion, really good for the community, for growing the community and having that dialogue be present for people that are coming into the ecosystem, because people coming in new without knowing the history of bitcoin and knowing the future utility of some things in the eth ecosystem, and then all of the tertiary and some of the up and coming platforms, now they have a dialogue that's open for them to be able to quickly get caught up. They get all of the emotion behind why people believe in those and kind of like the hoddlers of those particular positions that they're in, and then they can help build from that for the new people to come. And so whereas it could be painful sometimes when I see a very thoughtful discussion between the two camps or multiple camps, it's kind of refreshing a little bit for me.
01:32:46.440 - 01:32:58.600, Speaker A: Yeah. Robin, I think before we got into the bitcoin discussion, you were mentioning that while we were speaking, you minted nfcs.
01:33:01.480 - 01:33:09.290, Speaker B: Well, during the spaces, I was minting nfts. I mint them in my sleep. I'm minting them constantly. I can't stop myself.
01:33:10.300 - 01:33:15.436, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Okay. Do you mind saying, what did you do? What exactly did you mean?
01:33:15.458 - 01:33:27.056, Speaker B: No, I didn't. I actually didn't. I've given myself an enforced ban on mentoring them just because I have so many now that I kind of need to take stock. The problem is that these communities are.
01:33:27.078 - 01:33:27.650, Speaker C: All.
01:33:29.380 - 01:34:12.700, Speaker B: Finding their own feet and also learning from each other and innovating in such weird and wonderful ways. And some of them are innovating in the minting process, and some of them are innovating in the breeding process, and some of them are innovating in the way they use consumables, but some are also much more defi focused, and they're building farms and taking individual components of things like loot and turn them into farmable assets and defi assets. So I try and keep on top of all of that because I'm just a general student of all of that stuff. And I think it's somewhere in the middle of all these things is like a bunch of really good ideas, and I think there's tons to be learned from them. But anyway, I have to jump onto another call.
01:34:12.770 - 01:34:50.492, Speaker A: Exactly. I was just saying it's so interesting that when we end up doing spaces and it flows and it ends up being a bit long, the maximum amount of people listening to these spaces is when we have to wrap it up. It's really interesting but the longer we go the more people we end up having. But yeah, definitely let's wrap this up. We will have more opportunities to talk in the future for everyone who was around. Thank you so much for hanging with us and listening to everyone else who spoke on the stage. We truly appreciate you.
01:34:50.492 - 01:35:28.164, Speaker A: Thank you Robin for your time. And just a last reminder, this was nifty. Five spaces we are a marketplace that helps people get crypto loans on their NFTs or offer loans to others against their NFTs. So make sure you follow us on Twitter.

01:35:28.164 - 01:35:32.900, Speaker A: Thank you so much everyone. Take care and have a nice day. Bye.
