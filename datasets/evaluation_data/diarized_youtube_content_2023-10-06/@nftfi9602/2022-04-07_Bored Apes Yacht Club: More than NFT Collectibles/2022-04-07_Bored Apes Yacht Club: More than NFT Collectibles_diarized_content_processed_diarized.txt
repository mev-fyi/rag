00:00:00.170 - 00:00:21.354, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. My name is Annie. I'm the CMO here at Niftify. This is Niftyfi's official Twitter spaces. We do this on weekly basis. For those of you who don't know what is niftify? It's basically a marketplace where you can get crypto loan on your nfts or offer a loan to others against their nfts. So join us on discord.
00:00:21.354 - 00:01:04.478, Speaker A: We would love to talk to you. If you have any questions or want to know more details, just go there. The link is on our bio and I think we have a very exciting conversation because not only it's about a very hot topic, which are the board apiact very exciting collectibles, and not only way more than collectibles, but today we have here with us Jim McNally, who is the OG collector, founder of NF 42, nameless Avastars, and now owner of the Apes rock band Kingship. So welcome, Jim. Welcome.
00:01:04.564 - 00:01:16.260, Speaker B: Thanks so much for having me. I'm excited to be on today. Yeah, thank you. I own the apes that are in the rock band. I don't think I have full ownership over the rock band itself.
00:01:17.590 - 00:01:20.898, Speaker C: Yes, fair point. But it doesn't sound as cool to say it that way, though, Jim.
00:01:20.994 - 00:01:26.390, Speaker B: I know my apes are in the band. All my apes are in the band.
00:01:27.550 - 00:01:43.418, Speaker C: Is that like having cyborg rock stars working for you 24/7 it's such a weird new concept for you to own these digital collectibles that are in a rock band that's kind of doing stuff independent of you.
00:01:43.584 - 00:01:53.440, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's kind of like an analogy to when you have, you're mining ethereum or bitcoin or something like that. You have machines that are working for you. My nfts are working for me.
00:01:53.970 - 00:02:13.960, Speaker C: Yeah, super interesting. Okay, so I thought maybe what we can do is take a bit of a step back and then just kind of talk through how you got into apes and how your thoughts on them have kind of evolved over time. Or did you always kind of see the value proposition in them for kind of what's happening now?
00:02:16.650 - 00:03:00.658, Speaker B: So apes was a boring Friday night. I balance my work and my collecting life. I usually favor work, but when I have some time to collect, it's usually on the weekends and in the evening. So I was looking around on Twitter for something cool to ape into that night, and someone posted a link and I looked at it and I have on chain ideals. I like my projects. I like my nfts to be on chain, and they hadn't done anything wrong. But they hadn't done a lot right as far as putting the NFT metadata on chain and the images were stored on ipfs.
00:03:00.658 - 00:03:30.746, Speaker B: But looking at the art I thought it looked really fresh. And so I decided to buy a few and I bought some. And I really liked the outcomes because they were immediate outcomes that by that time they were just instant reveal. And there were some cool apes in there and I was like, wow, these are pretty cool. I wonder if I can get more cool ones. And I did a few more, I did a few more and then eventually I saw that you could get a gold colored ape and so I decided to mint some more. By then I told Twitter that I was minting them and I posted in some discords and pranksy was awake.
00:03:30.746 - 00:04:05.900, Speaker B: So pranksy started creating some and then a bunch of other people started minting and then eventually it sold out. A couple of hours later. I think I had minted 420 by the time it was all said and done. And I just thought they were really cool. Like looking through my collection, they were really neat. So I started giving them out to people because I thought it would be a fun project for other people to be involved in. Ended up giving out, I think, well over 100 to different people and then ended up selling a few as the market was rising and now just trying to hold on to the remaining ones that I have.
00:04:07.550 - 00:04:46.150, Speaker C: Super interesting. Basically it was really just like the art was cool. You got into a bit of a chase for the golden think, you know, the strategy for board apes and punks are kind of very different. When did you kind of realize that? It seems to be that this kind of giving IP to the NFT holders has created something kind of special and unique with board apes. Do you think that's accurate? And when did you kind of realize that that was something that's going to happen with apes?
00:04:46.890 - 00:05:29.720, Speaker B: Dude, I'm so stoked for that part of it. I think that's one reason I wanted to support the project and was into it. My own project, avastars the year prior had come out and done a similar thing where you have the commercial rights to your avastars. You've seen like pranksy and Whale shark both use their avastars as their personal profile pictures and in commercial ways. So I was really stoked to see them carry this torch and continue it and be able to popularize this. So for me, this is one of the powers of NFTs that I love seeing played out and it was a reason I was able to go a little heavier on this project than I had on others in the past.
00:05:31.210 - 00:06:02.400, Speaker C: Yeah, it makes a lot of sense because it's like an entirely new way to monetize IP, right. Instead of normally. I guess what you do is you monetize the output of the IP, whereas in this case you're kind of enabling the people that are part of the project to monetize the output of that IP. But that in turn creates awareness and a want from the rest of the public to kind of be part of this project. It's really interesting.
00:06:03.190 - 00:07:11.800, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think it brings up an interesting emerging debate is know the crypto punks route, larva labs route versus the board apes route, where larva Labs gives you a limited license for your use of your things and still controls the IP, whereas the commercial IP is in the hands of the collectors in the case of board apes. And you have some people that think that it's going to be better for larvae labs in the long term because they're going to be able to control their ip and their brand more tightly and that apes are going to run into some issues because people will do things with the IP that may not look so great and reflect so great on the brand. So we'll have to see how this all plays out. I think that we need these different types of ownership of NFTs to play out so that we can understand the different opportunities and models. And so the thing that with kingship is exploring IP ownership and commercial ownership of the IP and being able to take any of my apes or anything that I own commercial ownership over in my collection. But in this case, it's these four apes, three board apes and one mutant right now.
00:07:11.800 - 00:07:59.720, Speaker B: And creating entirely new metaverse native music group, super group out of these nfPs. And the opportunities are amazing. And I think that even though right now board apes themselves have a high barrier to entry and now the mutants have started to, I think that's a reflection of people understanding the opportunity that they can potentially have something that could create a character in the metaverse that could be a superstar, and that there aren't limited number of these apes and mutants, and that there's a limited number of opportunities for that specific type of collectible to be used in that way. But I think there'll be other things that emerge as well that are equally as sought after in the long run.
00:08:00.730 - 00:08:22.170, Speaker C: Yeah. It's also interesting to think about what this is going to do for rarity. Right. So you could have a non rare ape that is famous and that will affect value. So it's quite an interesting kind of new dynamic, kind of fitting into bringing a new perspective into the valuation of these assets, too.
00:08:22.320 - 00:09:23.700, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that plays into a little bit of where I think NFTs will go overall around reputation as well. You could basically build up on chain or online reputation, like you're saying, around any of these entities, and then create value in that. I think we saw an early example of that, that he hasn't sold it yet, but, like, know making his avastar the brand, like, he instilled some value into that NFT token. It has some notoriety now so that it's worth more than its counterpart that doesn't have that same celebrity attached to it. So there's definitely that part of this reputational part to all of it that I think is extremely interesting. And that's, I think one of the cool opportunities as a collector that made me dive into the kingship thing is that I would still own the NFTs and could participate in the upside of the value that's gained in them through becoming celebrities in their own.
00:09:25.750 - 00:09:41.160, Speaker C: So can you tell us a little bit about how Kingship started? Right, was it something that you dreamt up? How did the whole process work and then how did you select which of your apes to put in there? Was there kind of any specific thinking around that?
00:09:44.560 - 00:10:23.364, Speaker B: The credit to Kingship goes primarily to Celine. Joshua, who's the executive over at 10:22 p.m. Which is a joint venture with Universal Media Group. 10:22 p.m. Is trying to be on the cutting edge of the music and web three space. And she came to me through Nick Adler Nicky ads on Twitter, who manages my NFT collection, like, represents my NFT collection, basically, and presented this really cool idea and basically said, here's the ideas I have. You have an amazing collection.
00:10:23.364 - 00:11:15.000, Speaker B: Let's talk about what apes to include and how this can play out. And really, it was a pretty easy process just going through and figuring out which apes we all liked for the band and then now developing personalities and their positions in the group and everything else behind them and starting to think about what an NFT metaverse native band looks like. So that's kind of where we are in the process at the moment, honestly, I'm providing the NFTs and some creative direction, but really trusting Celine to really spearhead this thing. She's got a really great and strong ideas about how to pull this off, and I'm just making sure it all feels right from an NFT and metaverse perspective.
00:11:16.540 - 00:11:31.630, Speaker C: Yeah, it's really interesting. Every couple of weeks I see something new happening where if you told me that it was going on six months ago, I just wouldn't believe you. It's so cool how often that happens in the NFT space. It's crazy.
00:11:32.640 - 00:11:40.690, Speaker B: It really mean. I don't know how to keep up with it all other than just to show up every day and be in it.
00:11:41.140 - 00:12:07.130, Speaker C: Yes, 100% agree. So I thought we could also open up the floor to some people. So if you've got a question, put up your hand. Welcome to kind of open the floor to other people. What else have you guys got cooking up with your collection? Jim? Are you doing much on that side or are you mainly focused around nameless and NFT 42?
00:12:07.520 - 00:12:41.620, Speaker B: Well, I mentioned Nick Adler kind of taking on the management of my NFT collection as far as looking for more opportunities like the Kingship one in the entertainment space and brands and other things. So he's handling a lot of that for me. I don't have a ton of time to collect myself right now. A lot of my collection is made up of things like board apes and things that came before board apes. I've dabbled here and there in some projects since then. We love the doodles.
00:12:42.360 - 00:12:42.736, Speaker C: Sup?
00:12:42.768 - 00:13:03.656, Speaker B: Ducks is great. There's some other projects that are hard to ignore. Cool cats. But I haven't collected any of those as heavily as I did with board apes. And then a lot of my collection is stuff before that, like art blocks and cryptokitties and my own project, avastars autoglyphs. I've got some crypto punks. I've got a bunch of me bits.
00:13:03.656 - 00:13:51.772, Speaker B: So a lot of my stuff is more legacy NFT than current NFT. I'm still kind of like everybody else, kind of waiting to see what that next board apes opportunity will be. I also have a lot of crypto art and NFT art from the likes of X copy and Hackathau and Giant Swan, Aketsa. Those are some of my favorite artists that I've collected in the space, and I have a pretty deep collection there around a lot of their stuff that I really enjoy having and I'm looking forward to displaying in my home on these new frames that are starting to emerge. So that's what I have right now. And then I'm just paying attention to what's coming in the space that's really interesting. I think we're going to see a lot of brands entering the space.
00:13:51.772 - 00:14:37.790, Speaker B: I know this because I am deeply involved with nameless and building out that I think we're going to see just a ton of interesting things come in to play here. I don't know if it'll be like Nike sneakers that I'm collecting as NFTs or it'll be skins and like a game that I'm playing that I'm going to be collecting. But I just think that really quickly we're going to see the real world merge with our world here over the next two years, probably. And I'm going to be excited to just have NFTs be a part of everyday life here in the near future. As far as collecting, it's harder to speculate now than it was before. And I had the benefit of being early like a few of my friends, and so don't want to ignore that.
00:14:39.600 - 00:14:46.190, Speaker C: Yeah. I must say, it is a little bit trickier to get your deals now. A lot more competition to buy stuff.
00:14:46.560 - 00:14:47.212, Speaker D: Yes.
00:14:47.346 - 00:14:48.430, Speaker B: The good stuff.
00:14:48.880 - 00:14:49.630, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:14:50.960 - 00:15:06.340, Speaker B: The trick there is trying to find the stuff that other people aren't paying attention to that is still good and those opportunities still do exist, but it takes more time and more. You have to be in that market, the markets all the time, to really understand when those opportunities emerge and you have to have the capital to execute.
00:15:06.680 - 00:15:07.910, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:15:09.160 - 00:15:21.448, Speaker B: One place that Niftyfi can help as well. Right. If you know there's a great deal out there to be had, you just don't have the capital. If you know you can get a loan on some of your assets and you're going to get that capital back, it's a good way to leverage your platform.
00:15:21.614 - 00:15:49.840, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. I mean, we've got some users that basically just keep loans open the whole time, just so they can stay liquid, so they can take an opportunity, so they don't have to wait to actually open the mean. Obviously, you need to be careful. Markets do turn on you. I think a lot of people are just used to NFDs only going up, but if you've been around long enough, liquidity dries up. Prices aren't always as stable as they are, so you have to be careful.
00:15:50.980 - 00:15:51.760, Speaker B: Yep.
00:15:53.220 - 00:15:56.710, Speaker C: Cool. So, Herb, you want to ask a question?
00:15:57.080 - 00:16:28.252, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me up. Jimmy is an absolute legend within the board ape community and at large, NFT Phi, doing such an interesting job of connecting NFTs to Defi and making that really through apes, I think, actually really cool and wanting to get educated. And Jimmy, I was curious. You've been in cryptokitties, the cryptokitty team. Part of it then forms doodles years later. How do you follow? Maybe devs or builders do you sort of follow individuals across projects and just seeing them develop in the space.
00:16:28.306 - 00:16:29.048, Speaker D: I'd be curious.
00:16:29.144 - 00:17:20.860, Speaker B: You've been here for a few years and then also with Avastars, probably one of the pioneers of a wide distribution of owners before board apes. And I'd love to get your take on sort of setting the foundation for what board apes became. Sure. So first and foremost, I'm very know there was a lot of people in cryptokitties, and then there weren't when the crypto winner set in and those of us that hung out and stayed there and were regularly speaking in the chats. We all eventually formed subgroups and got to know each other a little better. And one of those people is Jordan, who goes by poopy cat online sometimes, but his name's Jordan and he is one of the co founders of Doodles. So just know NFtFi.
00:17:20.860 - 00:18:14.784, Speaker B: I know Stefan's co founder Mads, and then pranksy is somebody that I know as well, who's done like NFT boxes and is a prolific figure in the space. And there's others I'm forgetting and leaving out at the moment who have done their own cool projects as well. But I've been fortunate to know these folks and to follow along. So while I didn't initially ape in and buy 100 doodles, I actually waited and saw what the market thought and bought some high profile doodles and things like that. It's good to be able to support a friend's project and everything else, but to see organic growth, another one is like, sup, ducks? Frankie Nines. He worked for NFT 42 for a while and worked on nameless this year and then did subducts and ended up being such a successful project. He is now rocking and rolling and doing that on his own.
00:18:14.784 - 00:19:06.364, Speaker B: And we love to support that. I think I've got about 20 or 25 subducts. I've been fortunate that the space was small and intimate, like kind of like a small high school for a while. And just by being in it, getting to know some figures in the space, that was definitely a fortunate development. Same thing with a lot of the artists that I mentioned previously before you asked the question or is getting to know them, and then what were you asking about Avastars? It really set the foundation for a wide distribution across the collection when we hadn't really seen that. And now with board apes, we think about sort of the large amount of unique wallets that own. But really, I think that's actually going back to Avastars is actually because of what we saw then.
00:19:06.364 - 00:19:48.632, Speaker B: But it took a while. It took maybe a year and a half. Well, there's a couple of factors there. One, Avastars community building was me, basically one by one, inviting people into the Avastars discord and telling them, this is what year, by the way, in case anyone doesn't know, I was building it in 2019. So started to invite people in in 2019 and then in 2020 when we did the early one by one. Yeah. So you tell people about what you're building and get them excited about it and then ask them if they want to join the discard gourd and follow along, and then cultivating relationships there, not just to get people to buy Avastars, but to get to know these people as well.
00:19:48.632 - 00:20:24.484, Speaker B: And then ended up getting people to believe in what I was doing. Whale Shark was a big supporter really early on, ended up buying, I think he still owns about 30 of the founders out of 100. So he really helped bootstrap the project. He believed in what we were building and helped make sure that market was successful through supporting and buying the earliest ones that we released. But there were others as well, the same people that I mentioned here also, Nate, Alex, and Carlini, also builders in the space. My friends. I knew I was forgetting people.
00:20:24.484 - 00:20:32.632, Speaker B: You guys are all ogs. Like, all of those people that you're naming were all in one chat group. You're saying one server, all texting each other.
00:20:32.766 - 00:20:33.160, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:20:33.230 - 00:21:21.556, Speaker B: So we all have supported each other through the years, kind of. Naturally. We are critics to each other's projects, and through that we help make each other's projects better and then end up being buyers ourselves, really. That was really interesting to get all that support, but it was interesting learning how to build a community that way. It takes so much work and we're able to get, like at a time. We had a similar distribution to crypto punks, but we have more avastars available. But then we kind of did a little bit of a shortcut to the system where we basically minted out the rest of Avastars because gas had gotten expensive and we needed to wrap things up so we could get to work on replicants, which is getting ready to launch.
00:21:21.556 - 00:22:13.000, Speaker B: I think it got delayed, but I think it's going to launch next week or the week after. But we basically ended up airdropping or making available to claim to the Vfriends community about 1500 Avastars. So they were able to go in, and if you owned a vfriend, you're able to go in and try to claim one Avastar per account that you owned a vfriend on from a snapshot we took, and that was a success. There was, I think, a temporary dip in the market price because of that, for people who wanted to take the easy win for a couple of decimal points of eth. But in the long run, that worked out really well. And we created avatars of 25,000 because we believe there was a future where 10,000 wouldn't be enough. We may still be a little bit early there, but I think that I'm really proud of the project itself.
00:22:13.000 - 00:22:48.368, Speaker B: I think in the long run, people will come to understand some of the things we did there. We avoided the gas war specifically for the most part, by making it a user curated collection. There wasn't just random mints where you could ape into 20 at once. You had to go out and pick the ones out you wanted before you were minting. There was some order to the madness, and that every Avastar that's created was picked out by a human. And somebody wanted that Avastar, rather than it just being randomly generated in itself. We came with commercial rights, just like board apes.
00:22:48.368 - 00:23:21.720, Speaker B: And we did a lot of things. We did the on chain svgs, we did on chain metadata. We did a lot of things that I hoped that would be echoed in other projects and starting to see that, even if it wasn't us, that directly influenced those things. As a collector, I'm happy to see those things in the space. And if Avastars happen to play a role in any of those things, then I'm really happy that it did that. But I still have, I don't know, 800, 700. 800 avastars myself that I bought with my own eth.
00:23:21.720 - 00:23:37.270, Speaker B: It was something I wanted. I made something I wanted myself, and I collect myself. So I still very much believe in that project in the long term, as well, as much as I believe in these other things, like board apes and crypto punks and things like that as well.
00:23:39.800 - 00:23:50.168, Speaker C: Yeah, I spent many hours scrolling through the Avastars feed, trying to hunt for legendary traits. So it was quite a cool experience.
00:23:50.334 - 00:23:51.450, Speaker B: Me too, man.
00:23:52.860 - 00:23:59.610, Speaker C: And I remember you guys had those bounties to find things that looked like certain people. That was quite fun.
00:24:00.540 - 00:24:38.308, Speaker B: Yeah, we had fun with it. A great community formed out of that. The person who's now running the Avastars brand, Quigbelt, she actually was just a fan of the community, who I one day randomly promoted to a moderator in our discord, and then ended up hiring her to run the community. And now she basically leads the brand. And then where Kitty is another community member who we ended up hiring, who's been building out the replicants function. She's also a fan of the project itself. So we've hired from within the community and provided jobs from the revenue from that project.
00:24:38.308 - 00:24:56.030, Speaker B: And Avastars is what bootstrapped everything else that I've done and nameless that exists now. The reason we were able to do that was because of the success of that project early on. So it's been really an amazing flagpole to have in the journey that we've begun here.
00:24:57.280 - 00:25:07.248, Speaker C: That's very cool. Can't wait for replicants to launch. Auntie, you've been waiting for a while. Yeah.
00:25:07.334 - 00:25:53.496, Speaker F: How's it going? Thanks so much for bringing me to the stage. It's been a really interesting conversation for me. One of the things that's always interesting is how we can add utility to these nfts. So I guess my question for Jimmy and Steven, or anyone else on the stage that wants to take the question, I'm curious, how do you see nfts evolving in the future in terms of. And I'm going to quote something you said earlier, Jimmy, in terms of your brand is your reputation. I wonder if there's a way to kind of leverage your reputation either on chain to inform your nfts, or vice versa. Your reputation in the real world to influence or inform your nfts on chain.
00:25:53.496 - 00:25:58.610, Speaker F: Do you think that there's going to be some sort of bridging? And if so, how do you think that's going to happen?
00:25:59.300 - 00:27:00.564, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I think an early example you can start to see would be there's a couple of different things in today's traditional financial worlds and things like that. You have verification of employment, you have verification of education, and just having a certificate that's owned by your NFT identity, or in your ethereum wallet that shows that you were employed, it was issued to you, whoever you are, there's identities kind of like can take on different forms, but to you, the individual, and you can confirm that this person has a college education, has worked at these three places in the past. They are who they represent who they are through these digital certificates. That's a form of reputation that you can carry with you through a digital identity now. So I think that's one simple example of how that could take place. But even just like, something we're doing at Tokensmart is starting to work on the educational component of being an NFT collector and being in the space.
00:27:00.564 - 00:27:33.550, Speaker B: And we'll offer certifications that come in the form of nfts for things like understanding your seed phrases and how to keep your wallet secure, and using Opensea and using metamask. And then eventually, as people start to hire in the space, which they already are, but they can start to use these certificates to say, look, I know how to do these ten things. Here's the NFT certificates that show, I know how to do those things. And through that, you have this reputational component that's attached to web three that starts to take shape. Is that somewhat of an answer, what you're looking for?
00:27:35.120 - 00:28:33.920, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, I think all of this is so emergent, personally. So I think that anything is a good answer, just because I think that it's all a matter of experimentation. One project that I really like is poap, as an example. It's like through your activity, participation, attendance, you get this poap. So I wonder, maybe in the future there is a way to use kind of a similar programmatic, I guess, utility to, as an example, board apes, right? So we're up here talking about board apes. Maybe there is a derivative project based on your activity in that community, whether it's like real world events or in the digital, in the metaverse, where based on your attributes of your participation, there is like a derivative NFT that you can mint that now is representative of that. That's the stuff that's really interesting to me, because I think that really creates a much more richer ecosystem.
00:28:34.580 - 00:29:22.370, Speaker B: I don't remember the name of the project, but there is a developer in the space that's playing around with some of this already. There was an NFT I minted that has to do, it's called time something. I'm sorry, I forget the name of it. I won't waste time on that. But basically it looks at the history of your account, and then based on factors of how many transactions you've done, how many NFTs you bought and sold, how many of certain things you have in your account, and all these different factors, it creates this timepiece that represents all of those things in a visual. So what you're asking about is absolutely going to exist. And right now we see that manifesting itself in the form of things like airdrops, like ens for participating in the platform and stuff.
00:29:22.370 - 00:30:24.244, Speaker B: Those things will eventually translate into be able to claim exclusive nfts and the like. And I mean, you see that already with airdrops and stuff, with like the board, ape, kettle, club, and then mutants the serums. So all these mechanisms can start to play out, and ownership becomes a powerful mechanism for the most popular projects that already have value attached to them. And then I think another reason that the speculation into board apes right now is, by and large, driven too, by the ape token that has been announced and is inevitable. We're not sure what it'll do yet, but Yuga Labs has killed it with everything they've done so far, and they've got some serious people involved. So I myself, as a collector and a holder of a lot of the apes and mutants and dogs, I'm wanting to hold on to them so that I can benefit from whatever this ape token will be. I kind of lost the point of the question, I think a little bit there, but I think there is a lot of experimentation to do.
00:30:24.244 - 00:30:57.600, Speaker B: And in some ways, like you said, there was no wrong answer to what I said. But I do think that it's a matter of people being motivated to go out and try these different new things. And the cool thing about what we built here, what we're building here in nfts and in the metaverse, is that it is permissionless. So we were able to set up a claim for vfriends holders to be able to come in and claim avastar just for holding a vfriend that was permissionless. I mean, obviously vfriends community went along with it. They loved it, Gary loved it. But we didn't need their permission to do that.
00:30:57.600 - 00:31:28.810, Speaker B: And people could take like, a board ape and cool cat and say, if you have a board ape and a cool cat, then you can go make this new NFT for my project and use the attributes from your stuff. We're in this really cool world where it's an open metaverse, and we can create things from the things that we already have. So far, we've primarily only seen that done within a project itself, like apes being able to create mutants, for example. But I'm excited to see how new stuff emerges around that idea.
00:31:29.660 - 00:32:26.910, Speaker C: Well, I think the OG crystals is also a good example, right? Where depending on which asset you've got in your wallet when you transfer it and you kind of grow different crystals, I think that's quite interesting. And then I think also just these things, because you own them, they actually can become useful in the real world, right? So we've had one of our users who bought a beeple, got it for one dollars in the original sale, kind of ended up being worth quite a lot more money, and then used that alone on that to kind of survive during COVID when people were on furlough. Right. So I think over time, these NFTs are going to become useful in the real world in ways that aren't necessarily directly kind of on chain or on protocol, but just that they kind of give people financial options that they didn't have before.
00:32:29.200 - 00:33:05.610, Speaker B: Absolutely. That's what I'm excited to explore here. And I also am conscious of the fact that there are these assets like board apes, and the ones that are being recognized as useful in that regard are being scooped up and coveted and held, and the value continues to rise on them for the time being, at least. So they're harder to get into the hands of everyday people who would benefit the most from those things. So we haven't fixed the whole social inequalities and inequalities that exist yet here, but it's an interesting new landscape to explore and to try to figure out how to get it right or at least get it better.
00:33:09.340 - 00:33:14.270, Speaker C: Cool. Awesome. So, blue cheese, you've had your hand up for a while. You want to go next?
00:33:15.680 - 00:33:46.928, Speaker E: Yeah. Thank you. There's just been a lot of great topics being reached on right now, and one of the aspects that I've noticed recently is basically everybody wants to get into their favorite project, mutants. That's an amazing thing. It's only going to go way higher. There's also other, going to be a lot of other projects that may have the same potential. Because postalone bought an ape, right? Jimmy Fallon bought an ape.
00:33:46.928 - 00:34:41.844, Speaker E: What's going to stop them from looking into other projects and buying more? Right now they're still learning, and we can see really, really early in everything that's going on. And one of the major disconnects is that, at least for someone like me, I don't know how to use Adobe after effects. I can't make an NFT otherwise, other than just minting it or I make music, I make clothes. So my goal is really primarily to focus how to be an artist and tie all of those things together, not only just having a basic NFT become a token or something, because we know that's the future. NBA games are going to have NFTs being sold as tickets, and there's just a lot of different aspects to be touched on. But an amazing thing that I just found out recently is that cool cats NFTs, you try to get a cool cat. Right now, it's pricey.
00:34:41.844 - 00:35:57.984, Speaker E: It's not v friends pricey, but it's pricey. That being said, something else that I've seen that's a verified account on OpeNC is when they sell nfts regarding to events that happen around the world. Now, there's a cat on there that I'm looking at specifically, that's only about zero point 17. What's the correlation between what does the future hold for having something like that and having something like an actual cool cat? I'm not sure, but because that's something that's affordable for me, I'm ready to go all in just on that, at least because it's something that I can afford to spend nfts on. And like I said, there's many other aspects to talk about regarding artists and how to make it be a little bit smoother for these artists to give or create this art to everybody, no matter what the price is right now. But the market that we're in is not people who can go out and just spend maybe even $70 plus the Ethereum gas prices on what they want, even if they just want it. And we're getting to a point where, as you guys all know, it's a technological future moving towards.
00:35:57.984 - 00:36:42.588, Speaker E: So you're either going to be able to do it and now people are going to have to stop playing the games that they play on PS four, Xbox, PC or not PC, I wouldn't say. But those regular councils that actually engage in these games where it cost you around $700 to get something like a full team of axes in order for you to start now really making income. Where people are doing this for their own families in different countries, it's a lot of different aspects to touch on. And everything you guys are saying are so beautiful, but it's the in betweens and it's a little bit of the disconnects. Not saying that anybody here is wrong and not saying that I'm right. It's just me, myself on the outside looking in. It's a beautiful thing.
00:36:42.588 - 00:36:55.296, Speaker E: That's why I can't even be mad. That's why this whole community, I heard somebody else saying there's not much politics being involved in the stuff that we're going on. That's because we all have a common goal. A lot of people, I think this.
00:36:55.318 - 00:37:28.670, Speaker B: Financial incentive, I think I agree with everything you're saying. But one way to look at this too would be like in the very beginning, when CDs came out, it was really expensive to own a CD player. And then over time that technology started to spread and to get better and also to get a lot more approachable by everybody. Until everybody had cds. And now we don't even do cds anymore. I think we're in that phase of NFTs and blockchain technology where it's very expensive to use right now. And so we see a lot more people that already have money that are in the space.
00:37:28.670 - 00:38:12.330, Speaker B: But it's important that we do make this type of technology available to everyone at all levels of socioeconomic class and income and everything else. It's just that right now we're so early in it that it hasn't translated over to that yet. I think once we have more affordable, I take that back to a certain extent. Topshot is pretty approachable. You can spend $5, $10 and get a pack of cards right now, right? And you can pay cash. So you start to see some of that, and they have over a million users now as a result. So there's some opportunities that are being created there for others to access as well.
00:38:12.330 - 00:39:06.124, Speaker B: But it is really exciting to think about a future where these sort of opportunities are available for anybody, where anybody can come in and potentially, and it does exist already to a certain extent, if you have really good art and you have some social skills and are able to market yourself, you can gain an audience and you can start to sell your art and artwork. OpeNC and other places provide tools to mint your stuff freely and not to have to spend any money to do those things. But to your point earlier, it is expensive. Sometimes that $70 minting fee is also going to come with a $70 gas fee, and that can be a hard pill to swallow. And then if you want to transfer an NFT to a friend, that could cost $50 or $70. And it's hard to think about sending a gift to a friend where you're paying $70 for shipping. That's not something you would normally do.
00:39:06.124 - 00:39:15.036, Speaker B: But here you are just sending a digital item, and it costs that much. So there's definitely a lot of problems that we need to solve there in order for it to be approachable by everyone.
00:39:15.218 - 00:39:16.430, Speaker C: Well, for sure.
00:39:17.460 - 00:39:17.872, Speaker E: Sorry.
00:39:17.926 - 00:39:49.128, Speaker C: I also think the other thing to just bear in mind is it can feel like it's too late now. It's over. Everyone's made a whole bunch of money, but we really are kind of where the Internet was like in the very early days. And there's going to be a lot of the projects that are kind of growing now aren't going to be around forever. A lot of other projects are. Well, I mean, they'll be around forever, but they might not be kind of popular or hold their value. Some of these projects are going to become classics, but I also think there's going to be lots of new things.
00:39:49.128 - 00:40:00.350, Speaker C: And we're so early in this design space, we're still going to see new things happening that we didn't think were possible on a regular basis for the next.
00:40:01.040 - 00:40:01.516, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:40:01.538 - 00:40:30.230, Speaker C: I think for the next decade we're going to see stuff. How long did it take us to go from brochure websites to what we have now? It's been 20 years of the Internet, and there's still new companies forming and there's still new opportunities happening. So I don't think you need to be despondent. I think if you're interested and you're going to spend time in the space and learn the skills you need to learn and build a network of people around you who kind of believe in what you want to do, I think there's opportunity for everyone still.
00:40:32.680 - 00:41:13.252, Speaker E: I completely agree with both of you guys because there's a lot of space for all of that. Imagine eventually it gets to a point where all the skills that you've learned in reality, you can now transfer to the metaverse. There's going to be a lot of different things that need to get done. What I'm seeing, though, is that there's three different aspects to what's happening. There's people that a lot of us that are in the community are trying to get in on profile pictures and jpegs and seeing how far where these companies are going to go. Another aspect is that companies at an investing level, they're not going to go do that. They may have somebody that can play around with that, or that's what they do on their free time.
00:41:13.252 - 00:41:50.672, Speaker E: What they're actually doing is buying up this space because we cannot exist in the metaverse without this space. That's one aspect of things. And none of them can buy up all the space. Like Microsoft just spent 350,000,000. Why wouldn't they spend more? Because they have people that are watching everything going on and they are understanding that they cannot just go in and buy it all up because the community is the market now. If the community looks at them the wrong way, they're going to die. There's going to be a lot of trial and errors, but that's why there's going to be maybe another 30 something months before they get everything together.
00:41:50.672 - 00:42:57.972, Speaker E: And even then, by the time they start feeling comfortable doing that, they're going to have a lot of trial and errors, just like we are now. The ogs in the space are winning for a reason. They've been in the space, and they understand everything that's going on right now, which is a beautiful thing. Those projects are the ones that are going to have longevity. But there's also another aspect of things, because people are still just playing in the metaverse and trying to figure out how to use these Ethereum apps and things like that and still turn that into a financial source of income rather than, or a place to financial security and possibly more, rather than just trying to spend what they possibly may not be able to afford on a profile picture. So it's a lot of different investment things going on at one level. So to tackle exactly how, we would like to make sure that we can either do two things, bring as many people into the NFT space as we can, which is going to happen organically, of course.
00:42:57.972 - 00:43:54.200, Speaker E: But then the other thing is, how do we get everybody to get on board or able to be in a place where they can invest into whatever project they like? Well, there's companies like Basi that are going to be creating coins. Atari is already going to be creating coins. They already have their own casino, Decentraland already has a pay to play game. Now, you may have to pay an NFT in order to camp on the casino and get payouts, but they're giving people more and more incentives to join the space. When you don't understand the space, that's when it gets really complicated. But if you tell one of your friends that, look, there's a game, it's better than Farmville, dude, you can go play and you can start making money, but it costs this much. That's where the people, normal people, will probably be like, I don't know, I could literally save that and buy groceries for a month or do whatever I need to do.
00:43:54.200 - 00:44:30.870, Speaker E: And I feel like it's that gap right there, because people are investing into whatever project they can invest through trying to just get a quick flip at this point, because a lot of people are doing this for financial investor incentive, but there are people like us right now in this space and that are continuously going to spaces because we want to see this entire project, all of the metaverse, go into the proper direction that it should be, because we understand what it's here for and what it can do for us. That's not everybody 100% agree.
00:44:31.240 - 00:44:45.210, Speaker C: Hopefully there's more of the good guys than the bad guys. I think we can just do our best. I also just want to give Magnet nine a chance. He's had his hand up for, I think, 20 minutes now. So magnet nine, do you want to have a go.
00:44:46.140 - 00:45:15.368, Speaker G: Hey, guys, good to meet you. Magnet nine here. Great to be on the panel with you guys. Certainly. I just found the inspiration recently to come out and share some of the journey with Twitter, get involved and make the contribution that way. Like many of you, it's been a journey, man. Luckily, via a prior journey back in 2017 before the big bull run got into crypto, fortunately.
00:45:15.368 - 00:46:12.320, Speaker G: And it's been an epic experience daily ever since. And yeah, really great to be here to make an impact. It's really amazing when you take note of how powerful a community, how important the community is. I'll never forget. I mean, one personal experience is like, during the bear market, I had my eye on lend when things were popping and then things pulled back and I just couldn't help but notice that lend was still building, right, and getting involved in that community. And initially it was like peer to peer lending. Like the first Dap or whatever version of maybe some of you remember of Lend, which is now Ave, by the way, was like a peer to peer lending protocol.
00:46:12.320 - 00:47:08.036, Speaker G: Just dap. And just watching the team reiterate, make updates, the community reviewing it, making suggestions, everybody having ideas. And then suddenly I noticed in the community, we were discussing the idea of lending pools because peer to peer lending, the volume was just too weak. It's like you made a request to fill a loan, and it's just like the thing would just sit there. So it's like, why not everybody just pull in together? And it's just amazing because out of that conversation, maybe the team had been thinking it already. But in one way or another, collectively, the lending protocol, lending pool protocol was born and aave evolved at a lend. And it's just quite amazing to reflect on.
00:47:08.036 - 00:48:00.600, Speaker G: But I just know how important community is and how much of an impact we can make just by getting on calls like this, just by getting involved in the communities, on Telegram, discord, wherever they're communicating with each other, every single day adds up to a lot. And I've definitely seen that. So utility is just such an interesting topic when it comes to NFTs. So excited about it. You see the first iterations of some of these cyber Kongs, but now they're the latest version. Like, you can see my profile pick there of a Kong, the VX Kongs. So excited about the utility to integrate into the sandbox, right? I think they're working on the build right now, the bridge to integrate into the sandbox.
00:48:00.600 - 00:48:39.328, Speaker G: I can't wait to use this guy in the game, and that's amazing. Utility, another utility that just really excites me, right? Everybody just got this utility. It's huge, right? Twitter is going to be verifying our pictures, right? Like verifying whether or not, if it's an NFT, like verifying it within your wallet, one of a kind. And that just gave utility to all NFTs out there. And I can't think of a bigger catalyst than something like that or an awareness campaign, right? That's this giant awareness campaign. And what other social media platforms are going to follow, right? Like the trend. And suddenly everybody's going to be aware of nfts.
00:48:39.328 - 00:49:18.044, Speaker G: I think they are now, but it's gained a whole nother realm of utility right away. There's so many capabilities. Another one, guys, that excites me just so you know, beyond just gaming, like sandbox, which is essentially very similar to what I'm going to say. But AR is interesting, right? Here's another huge catalyst is Facebook with Metaverse, with meta. But they've talked about AR. Well, things like OVR reality are super cool because download the app, man, and it'll blow your mind. You can literally visit the zoo in your front yard.
00:49:18.044 - 00:49:47.610, Speaker G: But they're doing cool things like treasure hunts and they're collaborating with NFT projects to go hunting for their nfts. Like if you collect a certain amount of diamonds, you get the chance to either win a prize or know like a real NFT or whatever. And dude, that's Pokemon go to the next level. And I'm so excited about stuff like that. So whenever I'm looking at some of these NFT projects, whenever I'm looking at teams, important. Vision is important, roadmap is important. Delivery is important.
00:49:47.610 - 00:50:11.200, Speaker G: What's the utility? Where are we going? You got to get started somewhere, that's for sure. But where are we going anyways? Guys, it's really a pleasure to be a part of this conversation. I feel very blessed to be here doing what we're doing, and I'm sure a lot of us have so much to contribute and I hope that we can all keep the momentum rolling.
00:50:12.100 - 00:50:23.312, Speaker C: Thanks, man. Appreciate it. Appreciate the sentiments. Yeah, we're all in this together. I think so. We also have autography. He's been waiting patiently.
00:50:23.312 - 00:50:24.550, Speaker C: Let's give him a chance.
00:50:26.680 - 00:50:52.664, Speaker D: Hello everybody. Artography. Thank you for giving me this chance. I wanted to say some things actually. I love this community so much. I'm academic person actually. First of all, in this first age of NFT, I was searching about copyright problems.
00:50:52.664 - 00:52:06.020, Speaker D: Maybe they might be a problem or should be in this topic, should be in the literature. Actually I was searching this after then other facts I thought about because physical galleries was like robbing the artists. First of all, the second one, this NFT opportunity give the people as the before speakers they probably mentioned about this, give a chance to explain, express themselves. It was huge movement actually and for the community. I was always following the ape and we have actually 93 55 ape with my friend. We didn't have that much money that time, so we decided to buy together. So he kept in his account and actually this is something I want to ask or I want to know your opinions.
00:52:06.020 - 00:53:00.548, Speaker D: I wanted to make ape, but another expression of ape actually. Is it bad for the community like ape community or is it like supporting the community? Because I was just scratching on the digital area. I wanted to just create this and show my support to this community because I already support this community. So I wanted to make a collection. It's like spin off because I also wrote a story for it because it's not like just a collection and it's finished. It's like continue. It was like that.
00:53:00.548 - 00:53:06.808, Speaker D: I just wanted to ask your opinions about this. Thank you for having me here.
00:53:06.974 - 00:53:26.130, Speaker B: Yeah, man. If it's based off the apes you own, go for it. I think that's the point of owning the commercial rights here is you can feel free to develop those characters however you see fit. And if you can build an audience around that and they want to support you by buying nfts based around the creative expression of that ape you own or those apes you own, then I think you're on the right track. Go for it, man.
00:53:28.020 - 00:53:31.330, Speaker D: Thank you so much. Thank you for giving me this idea.
00:53:33.060 - 00:53:41.510, Speaker C: Awesome. Cool. So other person who has been waiting for a while is manic. Did you want to ask a question?
00:53:42.680 - 00:54:37.044, Speaker H: Hey, what's going on? My name is Jesse, my artist's name is manic. And I just want to say I love this whole NfT space. I discovered it right after beginning of COVID and I feel like I found my tribe and basically bipolar was a big part of my life because I've been dealing it since I've been 16 years old, in and out of mental hospitals and drug rehabs and I lost touch with reality for a long time. I was locked in a state hospital, finally snapped out of reality, but it's been 16 years since I've gone through that. I discovered NFTs and I landed in a clubhouse room, NfT tips and from there I've just been on a journey and I've been creating art like a maniac. Teaching myself the blender. And I was already familiar with other graphic design programs, but I just love it.
00:54:37.044 - 00:55:04.750, Speaker H: And I'm just finally putting myself out there for just a long time, I was just listening, and I know to be successful, you got to put yourself out there whether you're uncomfortable or not. And each time I talk now, it's just easier. So I'm in here just listening, soaking up the knowledge. And I just wanted to introduce myself, just get familiar. My name is Manic and I'm here. I'm all in with this NfT stuff. And I have my art all over my twitter, so if anybody wants to check it out.
00:55:05.120 - 00:55:12.610, Speaker B: Glad you're here, man. I'm add and I'm also borderline bipolar as well. So just keep doing your thing. You're on the right track.
00:55:13.220 - 00:55:19.030, Speaker H: I definitely will. I can't stop. I love it. Thank you for letting me share.
00:55:19.640 - 00:55:42.830, Speaker C: Powerful message. Really appreciate it. Powerful message. Yuppie. How's it going, guys? Powerful message there. I'm also a little bit add, but I've had my coffee today, so I'm doing a little bit better, for sure. What's up, Jimmy? I actually talked to an NFT 42 recruiter a while ago, just about doing some cloud infrastructure for NFT 42.
00:55:42.830 - 00:55:54.412, Speaker C: And yeah, I wanted to see you at NFT NYC as well and just talking about all the different stuff with NFTs, but it's good to be in a space.
00:55:54.466 - 00:56:00.272, Speaker B: We'll be down in Miami at art Basel in a couple of weeks. We're doing a very cool event there.
00:56:00.406 - 00:56:00.912, Speaker E: Very cool.
00:56:00.966 - 00:56:01.776, Speaker B: Anybody's down?
00:56:01.878 - 00:56:36.092, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm doing some work with cool man coffee Dan, and he's going to be at art Basel, too. He's going to have some physical canvases and he's launching an NFT project called Cool Man's Universe, but bringing it back to board ape yacht club. One of my really good friends just got hired by them. He's a full stack developer. I've known him for years, and he's like one of the most talented guys I've ever worked with. And he just got hired at board ape Yacht club yuga Labs. So I think they're hiring the right people.
00:56:36.092 - 00:57:06.260, Speaker C: They're doing the right things. And one of the things that really blew me away about the apes was NftNYC. So many people jumped in line to get those wristbands, to get the merch. You saw the merch everywhere, and everybody's just signaling on the streets. Random conversations would start up just from that, but I actually went to the warehouse party. And I didn't know what to expect at all. I thought it was just going to be another little Catalina wine mixer where people were talking and stuff.
00:57:06.260 - 00:57:43.628, Speaker C: But obviously, you walk in, there's this giant stage, by the way, all of the design of the warehouse, the free food, the free drinks, the art on the walls, the neon signs, it was just executed perfectly. The vibes were right. And you see the big stage and you're like, what is going on here? This is obviously a concert, right? It's got to be a concert. And nobody knew this stuff, right? I think my budy knew. He told me like, oh, watch this, watch what's going to happen here? And I had no idea. Chris Rock Aziz on Beck. I love Beck.
00:57:43.628 - 00:58:25.708, Speaker C: And granted, that night he wasn't sounding the best, but he did play loser and that was cool. I mean, Beck, the strokes, the strokes killed it that night and I left before little baby went on stage. But if that's any indication of what the apes have in mind, if that's the type of stuff that they're using all their capital to do, it's like this is the community that you want to get involved in. If you like concerts, if you like experiences. I had no idea that's what we were in store for. And I'm just so bullish on the apes after that because they executed it beautifully. They had huge names, go on stage and make jokes and play good music.
00:58:25.708 - 00:59:32.340, Speaker C: And I just can't wait to see what they do with the bar in know it's just a rumor that they're going to go and create a bar in Miami, right? I don't think they've officially announced it, but I mean, why would they stop there? There could be a bar in Miami and a bar in LA, a bar in San Francisco and a bar in New York, you know what I mean? And it's like what happens when the utility of your ape becomes free vip access to that bar, restaurant, nightclub, whatever they do, right. Or the next concert that they have. What does that look like? What happens if you have a mutant or an ape or a dog? Right? I'm just so bullish on what they're doing. I feel like the board ape warehouse party was a glimpse into their vision of the future. And over the next few years, if they continue executing experiences and events like that, they could end up becoming so much bigger than we imagine, especially with a permanent residence like the Miami bar that's been rumored. So I'm super bullish because of all those reasons. For those reasons, I'm bullish.
00:59:33.480 - 01:00:01.784, Speaker B: Yeah. And, guys, I got to jump. But I echo everything that you just said. I also went to the event, and it was amazing. And I think this is also credit to both Yuga Labs and to Guy Osiri for recognizing a fruitful relationship between them. And Guy being able to leverage a lot of his relationships to be able to get people like Chris Rock and Beck to show up to that show and to put that on in such a spectacular way. So I got to jump.
01:00:01.784 - 01:00:12.800, Speaker B: But I am also very bullish on the apes. And I really enjoyed the time here today, Steven, and appreciate everything that you guys are doing in the space to make NFTs more liquid.
01:00:13.220 - 01:00:23.700, Speaker C: Awesome. Thanks, Jimmy. Really appreciate you coming on. Looking forward to seeing what else you got cooking up. So hopefully speak to you soon. Maybe we'll see you in Vegas at your conference.
01:00:24.200 - 01:00:27.124, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll talk about that again. Another space.
01:00:27.322 - 01:00:28.696, Speaker C: Very cool. Catch you later, man.
01:00:28.718 - 01:00:29.672, Speaker B: All right, see you guys.
01:00:29.726 - 01:00:30.196, Speaker C: Cheers.
01:00:30.308 - 01:00:31.508, Speaker A: Thank you. Bye.
01:00:31.604 - 01:00:34.010, Speaker C: Shout out eclectic method. Love you, bro.
01:00:40.700 - 01:00:51.996, Speaker A: Okay, cool. I think it was a very good session. Stephen, do you want to wrap this up, or do you want to take more questions? How do we go about this? We've been going on for a full hour.
01:00:52.098 - 01:01:14.848, Speaker C: I also have to jump, I think, but it's been awesome. I'm really looking forward to doing more of this. I just want to say thank you to everyone for joining and for kind of the love and the passion you guys are showing for the space. It's definitely shared from our side. Come check us out. Don't sell that. Nft if you don't have to get a loan on it.
01:01:14.848 - 01:01:21.864, Speaker C: See if you can hold it on for a little bit longer. Really appreciate your taking the time, and hopefully I see you soon, guys, again.
